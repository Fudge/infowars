[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  And thanks to Inventek, no one's going to cash in but me.
[00:04.000 --> 00:08.000]  They're going to help me get my invention off the drawing board and into the marketplace.
[00:08.000 --> 00:11.000]  I really need Inventek. What's that number again?
[00:11.000 --> 00:14.000]  1-800-313-6868.
[00:14.000 --> 00:15.000]  One more time?
[00:15.000 --> 00:22.000]  Call 1-800-313-6868. That's 1-800-313-6868.
[00:22.000 --> 00:32.000]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  You want answers?
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57.000 --> 01:18.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.000]  I tell you, I feel like myself again.
[01:21.000 --> 01:28.000]  For the last, I don't know, what is it, almost two weeks I have had the worst allergies of my lifetime.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  And I know I've been starting a lot of the programs discussing that.
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  I don't normally talk about, you know, how I feel or what my health is like.
[01:36.000 --> 01:43.000]  It's just so amazing to live in a city where everyone I know has horrible sinus headaches
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  and something that mimics a chest cold.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  And you talk to everybody and it wasn't like this in the past.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  You've got to ask yourself, what has changed? Why are allergies all over the country?
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.000]  But especially in Austin, Texas, known as the national capital, the worst place in America in the U.S.
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  for allergies. Why has it gotten so bad?
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  But so in the last week and a half or so, if I've sounded like a toad or been a bit grumpy, it's because
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  it's a strange effect that the allergies have had on me.
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  I guess when you feel bad, you make yourself go to work, you're a bit curmudgeoned.
[02:23.000 --> 02:26.000]  But I am honored to be your host and honored to be here.
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  And I am blessed that I'm going on a short vacation for part of next week to visit family.
[02:31.000 --> 02:39.000]  Maybe I can fully escape the allergies then, but I'm going to have Jack Blood and Bob Desi
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  in the days I'm out sitting in next week, so you definitely do not want to miss that.
[02:44.000 --> 02:54.000]  It is Thursday and it is the 11th day of January, 2007.
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  Still getting used to that. And obviously I want to have open phones today.
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.000]  I want to give you a chance to respond to Bush's lengthy speech that he gave last night.
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  I watched a lot of it. I was also working on a film while we had it on in the background.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  And we already basically had heard all of this propaganda spewed by his different surrogates
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  and his different handlers and his different front people.
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  But I've had a chance to read the transcript. I've got several audio clips of it.
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  I want to play, but I want to give you a chance on air all of you to respond to what George Bush has said.
[03:28.000 --> 03:37.000]  We've got one of the head spokespeople from World Can't Wait, a lady who basically destroyed Bill O'Reilly a few days ago.
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.000]  We've got one of the ladies who led the shutdown of the Democrats, a little press conference.
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  She's going to be joining us for about 30 minutes in the next hour.
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  Other than that, we're going to have wide open phones today.
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.000]  And we can talk about any issue, any news, story, anything you wish to discuss.
[03:58.000 --> 04:05.000]  You are welcome to call in at 1-800-259-9231.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  1-800-259-9231.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  But as I said, I will go over Bush's speech.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  Also, some news that's really sensational.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  It's so important and no one seems to be pointing it out.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  Well, it's in a few British papers, but it's a footnote.
[04:23.000 --> 04:40.000]  And that is that our government, our illegitimate criminal government, is openly funding in a takeover of Somalia the very warlords that killed our troops in 1993.
[04:40.000 --> 04:49.000]  The real agenda of the global elite in Somalia, neocons are backing the same warlords that slaughtered US troops in 1993.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  That's a story by Steve Watson up on infowars.net.
[04:52.000 --> 05:00.000]  Another one by Paul Watson that added the information that we got yesterday with our expert on Somalia we had on.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  Bush administration empowers Somali warlords who killed US troops.
[05:06.000 --> 05:16.000]  Bombing clears path for reemergence of Black Hawk down savages to cost of Somali people.
[05:16.000 --> 05:23.000]  So, we'll break this down, Bush's speech, what it really means.
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  We kind of had an epiphany this morning.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  And a lot more today. You don't want to miss this broadcast.
[05:28.000 --> 05:44.000]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, mighty film Terror Storm is complete.
[05:44.000 --> 05:52.000]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[05:52.000 --> 06:00.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[06:00.000 --> 06:12.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House appropriately disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police fortune, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[06:12.000 --> 06:18.000]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terror. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[06:18.000 --> 06:22.000]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[06:41.000 --> 06:45.000]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, it can't afford an underground shelter.
[06:45.000 --> 06:51.000]  So what do you do? Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:00.000 --> 09:09.000]  Now to the second segment of this live Thursday edition, the 11th of January, 2007.
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  So Bush gave his big speech, and I'm going to walk through some of that. We're going to play some clips of it later.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  We're going to have open phones.
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.000]  We've also got a BBC report about uranium killing troops. That's the headline.
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.000]  It's just unbelievable how much of this stuff that they've used.
[09:29.000 --> 09:42.000]  But there is a report here where the New York Times has got the headline, Democrats plan to fight expansion of troops.
[09:42.000 --> 09:48.000]  Democrats plan to fight expansion of troops. Now notice that.
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  They're going to fight the expansion.
[09:52.000 --> 10:04.000]  It doesn't matter whether there's 144,000 or 165,000, but they're talking about beefing it up to 22,000 plus.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  It doesn't matter. The troops are there. The war is ongoing.
[10:09.000 --> 10:16.000]  So everybody was asking why when the American people, 78% in major polls, and the polls are out again today showing similar numbers,
[10:16.000 --> 10:28.000]  why are they saying they're going to increase them, and why is McCain saying that, and why is the Iraq study group saying that's one of their five recommendations.
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  And then Bush is criticizing it.
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  And then Bush suddenly flip-flops and says, okay, I'm for it. I agree. I screwed up.
[10:36.000 --> 10:48.000]  And one, it puts it all into a political process now that de-partisanizes, if you could invent the word, takes the partisanship out of it,
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  at least for a lot of Americans who are just partisans.
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.000]  They don't care for attacking countries as long as it's the Democrats and Bill Clinton doing it.
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.000]  And so it's power sharing. Hey, we're sharing the power with the new Democrats.
[11:02.000 --> 11:11.000]  But really what this is all about is that by escalating the troops, it gives the Democrats something in a dog-and-pony show,
[11:11.000 --> 11:20.000]  in a good cop, bad cop stage, thespian theatrical event. It gives them some type of fight they can engage in.
[11:20.000 --> 11:28.000]  Because if Bush would have just left the troops at the same level, and this gets into the whole Machiavellian, you know, Byzantine workings of this,
[11:28.000 --> 11:37.000]  if they would have just left the troops at the same level, the Democrats would have, you know, had to demand that the war end of the troops be brought home.
[11:37.000 --> 11:46.000]  That's what the people are wanting. But by Bush surging, and that is not a surge, that's a drop in the bucket for what they would, quote, really need to pacify,
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  basically once resistance gets ahold, you just 5 million U.S. troops couldn't do it.
[11:53.000 --> 12:00.000]  In fact, that would make more targets. Actually, an escalation helps the insurgency.
[12:00.000 --> 12:07.000]  But again, that gets all off into military theories and schools.
[12:07.000 --> 12:15.000]  But that's what the real experts across the board are saying. This is worse. Even Oliver North saying more targets, not the right idea.
[12:15.000 --> 12:24.000]  So they're going to put more troops in, and the Democrats can then fight about that, and then Bush can pull them out in six months,
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  and they can claim he stabilized something, and just cut back on the amount of suicide bombings that our government's staging over there.
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  And it'll just drift off forever into this process.
[12:35.000 --> 12:44.000]  Look, they've said they're going to be there 30 years from now. They're building six giant permanent bases, and 30 plus smaller bases.
[12:44.000 --> 12:54.000]  And I mean, these green zone bases they're building have 50-foot walls, they're ringed with artillery, and they're luxury compounds on the inside.
[12:54.000 --> 13:02.000]  I mean, that one embassy is for 4,000 people, embassy staff, not just troops.
[13:02.000 --> 13:11.000]  And they've got their bars, their whiskey bars, their whores. They've got everything behind there, their bowling alleys, their swimming pools, their gyms, their discotechs.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  It's a sick joke.
[13:14.000 --> 13:21.000]  Meanwhile, the stated goal to dismantle Iraq, to deindustrialize them, to knock them back in the Stone Age,
[13:21.000 --> 13:29.000]  to exterminate their population, to engage in genocide, 3 million of them dead, is ongoing.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  Is ongoing.
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  And so that's why Bush is doing this search.
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  The surge, more than anything, is so the Democrats have something to fight against.
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  You see, we want to push him a step back, Bush, and he takes two steps forward,
[13:47.000 --> 13:53.000]  knowing we'll push him back a step, and he'll be right back where he wanted to be in the beginning.
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.000]  When I say Bush, I mean the people he fronts for.
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  So you read all these headlines about Democrats getting tough, Democrats to, you know, they're going to decide the course of the war.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  They teach Bush, they're in control now. And what is it?
[14:08.000 --> 14:15.000]  Deescalate, by standing up and resisting the 22,000 extra troops.
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  And really, it's not a deescalate, it's leaving and right where it was.
[14:20.000 --> 14:27.000]  The new Democratic leaders of Congress on Wednesday accused President Bush of ignoring strong American sentiment against the war in Iraq,
[14:27.000 --> 14:33.000]  and said they would build a bipartisan campaign against his proposed military expansion.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  See, they're against the military expansion, but they're not really.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  Hillary, Schumer, Lieberman, all of them.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  Oh, we need to go ahead and hit Iran. We need to go ahead and go into Syria.
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  Democrats continue to debate how assertively to confront Mr. Bush over his plan,
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  how Democrats said they would seek to attach conditions to the spending request Mr. Bush will send to Congress soon,
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.000]  and that those conditions have not met could leave Congress to limit or halt money for wider military operations.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  So that's just, again, a whole process that just confuses the public, means nothing.
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  We're going to fund the troops that are there, said Brendan Daley,
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  an aid representative, Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Speaker.
[15:15.000 --> 15:20.000]  Any escalation of troops will be subject to scrutiny. Oh, they're getting so tough.
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.000]  We will have hearings and we will set benchmarks that the President must meet to obtain his money.
[15:25.000 --> 15:31.000]  So they'll have big theatrical displays, kind of like the whole Clarence Thomas and Edith Hill thing,
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  and Democrats pointing fingers and acting tough.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  And the general Democratic population will be sucked in and brainwashed by it,
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  and the war will just roll on forever.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  Then there'll be some new terror attack right when Hillary or Whit Momney,
[15:45.000 --> 15:53.000]  it's a joke with his name, take power or Edwards or whoever, whatever,
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  a group member it is.
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.000]  And then, oh, see, the war was, I mean, the Democrats are saying,
[15:59.000 --> 16:10.000]  implement President Bush's 9-11 commission report, all the recommendations,
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  total police state on steroids, and then they act like,
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  we're getting Bush back, he didn't implement all of this,
[16:16.000 --> 16:22.000]  we'll show him total federalization of police, total checkpoints,
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  total domestic CIA.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  And it's the Democrats bringing forward draft legislation.
[16:29.000 --> 16:34.000]  It's all a big dog and pony show.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  Very, very serious.
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.000]  The good news is a lot of Democrats, a lot of conservatives, a lot of Americans aren't buying it.
[16:39.000 --> 16:45.000]  Meanwhile, I didn't talk radio this morning at the house and then driving over to the office.
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  And I heard the same thing on two different shows, exact same script.
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  I'll tell you what, we've got to stay over there.
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  If we don't stay over there, al-Qaeda will get all of our military equipment,
[16:55.000 --> 17:01.000]  we leave and use it to attack us, and they'll get all those nuclear scientists in Iraq again,
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.000]  and they'll nuke us, and we've got to stay over there.
[17:05.000 --> 17:11.000]  Or if we pull out, once al-Qaeda takes over Iraq, then we won't be able to reinvade.
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  That's word for word, two different hosts, exact same,
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  they've got to have talking point scripts they're being given.
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  I mean, it was, I was freaking out.
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.000]  I heard one thing at my house, I get in the car, turn to another guy, another national talk show host.
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.000]  He's the guy that sells the national sales tax as a fair tax.
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.000]  Really, they're going to keep both and bill you through your national ID card.
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.000]  Just watch.
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  And I mean, I'm listening to this, and it has no connection to reality.
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  That place is stone age.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  They barely have running water.
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  They have power in a few cities, a few hours a day.
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.000]  They're literally starving to death, hundreds of thousands a year.
[17:50.000 --> 17:56.000]  It is hell on earth, the most dangerous country in the world now, all by design.
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  That was the plan before they went in.
[17:58.000 --> 18:07.000]  And the strategy of tension, Balkanization, breaking them up, bringing them down.
[18:07.000 --> 18:15.000]  And, oh no, we've got to stay now because see al-Qaeda, everybody fighting our troops is al-Qaeda, didn't you know?
[18:15.000 --> 18:21.000]  Oh yeah, everybody over there who lost their mother, or their sister, or their brother, or their children.
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.000]  Everybody over there who lost their family members.
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  Anybody who, I mean, there's like five different factions, three big ones.
[18:28.000 --> 18:36.000]  Anybody who takes a pot shot at the troops, anybody who fights back, anybody who doesn't like their country being invaded,
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  and then being in literal hell on earth, and then people being carpet bombed,
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  and just the whole city's being leveled, ongoing.
[18:43.000 --> 18:49.000]  Anybody who does that's al-Qaeda.
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.000]  Just amazing.
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.000]  And these guys call into these talk shows, and you hear the listeners, the callers, they go,
[18:57.000 --> 19:07.000]  we've got to fight them in laws of fascism, and they're over there with them, and al-Qaeda's, and we've got to kill them all.
[19:07.000 --> 19:11.000]  They don't even know who the groups are, what's going on, the area's history.
[19:11.000 --> 19:17.000]  They can just barely say Islam-O-Fascist.
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.000]  And you can read to them on air, oh, here's the 83 Israeli plan.
[19:21.000 --> 19:28.000]  Here's the 2002 U.S. plan, to break it up in three parts, and to stimulate sectarian violence,
[19:28.000 --> 19:40.000]  and to destroy the region, and then to spread revolution system-wide to break down and weaken that entire area.
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  I mean, I hear the very same people call in going,
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  man, we sure taught them Somalis that I did.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  You've heard them.
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  We just hit them hard.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  I tell you, I love Bush.
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.000]  After what they did to our men in 93 under that traitor Clinton,
[19:58.000 --> 20:05.000]  I tell you what, I'm feeling real good right now.
[20:05.000 --> 20:08.000]  I mean, how foolish.
[20:08.000 --> 20:15.000]  The government funds the very warlords that shot down those helicopters,
[20:15.000 --> 20:18.000]  and the drug artrips of the streets, the very people,
[20:18.000 --> 20:25.000]  to go back in and make sure that country doesn't get on its hind legs, doesn't have a government.
[20:25.000 --> 20:31.000]  And by the time they're done with it, we'd blow away them people who've heard our trips.
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  No, our government hired them.
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  Hello, folks. Alex Jones here, introducing Prudent Places USA,

[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000]  This is the accumulation of power in Washington and bypassing the states over the last 50 years.
[22:03.000 --> 22:07.000]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass
[22:07.000 --> 22:12.000]  by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[22:12.000 --> 22:19.000]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[22:27.000 --> 22:33.000]  But all now, operators are standing by to receive your call.
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.000]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods,
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.000]  you are not correctly attacking the cancer,
[22:42.000 --> 22:46.000]  and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery,
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[22:53.000 --> 22:59.000]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die, with laced med inks, patented methodology.

[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  For more information, call 702-953-0267,
[23:19.000 --> 23:27.000]  or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.000]  Call 702-953-0267.
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[23:41.000 --> 23:46.000]  That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[23:53.000 --> 23:57.000]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments,
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement,
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  call 800-686-2237.
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[24:26.000 --> 24:47.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  We'll be talking about Bush's speech coming up in the next segment.
[24:50.000 --> 24:55.000]  We'll also take your calls at 1-800-2599-231.
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  The BBC and the Associated Press were reporting no al-Qaeda was
[24:59.000 --> 25:00.000]  killing the airstrikes.
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  They're also reporting that the al-Qaeda that they claim went into the country
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  went in there nine years ago.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  This is all admitted.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  There is no al-Qaeda, ladies and gentlemen, outside the CIA,
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.000]  Mossad, and MI6.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  It doesn't exist.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  It's the name of a computer file from the early 1980s for the name
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  for Muslim extremist groups controlled and funded by our criminal government.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  By the criminals that have hijacked our government.
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  Now, that's mainstream scholarly information.
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.000]  You can go find it.
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.000]  It's admitted.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  The government doesn't debate it.
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  But they know the general public, again, has no connection to reality.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  Criminals operate like this.
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  They know you're not paying attention to detail.
[25:43.000 --> 25:49.000]  They know that they can basically just put out simplistic terms
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  and archetypal images and that it works.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  It's just like Panama.
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  1989.
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  Remember, you heard, oh, the huge military invasion that had taken months to set up,
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.000]  by the way.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  A huge attack concerted, which they later admitted had been planned for months.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  Planned for months because that day they invaded.
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  That day they invaded, two women at a women's school college were kidnapped.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  Well, I have the video of the women going, no, US troops arrived here.
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  Right before the attack started.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  And so they were there to protect us.
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  We appreciate the protection.
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  Of course, they were totally ignorant.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  Those women were not kidnapped.
[26:28.000 --> 26:35.000]  It was all made up because Manuel Noriega, the history channel admits he was CIA drug dealer
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  and dealt drugs with the US government.
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  He started buying palaces, you know, $50 million palaces in Switzerland
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  and wasn't paying us cut and openly was threatening the Bushes to expose their drug dealing.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  And man, they set up the troops.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  They went in there and blew that place to Kingdom Come, Panama City.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  Killed tens of thousands.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  Of course, none of that was on your news, but we have all the footage of the Panama deception
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  and just dead bodies everywhere.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  Just jeeps just melted to the ground.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  People melted holding on the steering wheels.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  Lord knows what did it.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  And that was it.
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  I mean, that's how they operate.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  You've got a government that has developed stability.
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.000]  Women can walk on the streets.
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  Industry was starting to build up.
[27:21.000 --> 27:25.000]  And the warlords have been kicked out, so they ran to a nearby country.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  Had a big meeting in Ethiopia.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  The Ethiopians, U.S. back with the very same warlords.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  The very same.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  We had a guest on covering this yesterday, but it's in the news today.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  Well, these are the same warlord groups, but, you know, they're fighting Al Qaeda now,
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  so they're good.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  Al Qaeda.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  And then you read, oh, nine years since these supposed Al Qaeda guys traveled there.
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  And, oh, they're really British.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  And people are saying they're really British agents.
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  Just like the head of the 777 bombings, Rashida Swat.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  Remember, and he's MI6 admitted.
[27:56.000 --> 28:03.000]  He had the former FBI, just department's head anti-terror expert on to tell you that.
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  I mean, this is how they operate.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  They can just say, I mean, what's next?
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  France has Al Qaeda.
[28:09.000 --> 28:10.000]  Attack!
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  There were three Al Qaeda there.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  It's like Fallujah.
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.000]  Less than a dozen people hang and kill four contractors.
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  And so they literally level the entire city.
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  So next time there's a murder in, say, New York.
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  You know, what do you do?
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  You just level the whole city?
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  But again, they've been dehumanized.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  They're the Islamo fascists that want to kill us.
[28:33.000 --> 28:41.000]  No, they're people living at caveman level with their children with swollen belly starving to death with no medical care.
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.000]  Walking around out in fields with unexploded cluster bomb, bombless, blowing their legs off.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  Blowing their little feet off.
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.000]  And most of them still dream of America as some mythical, incredible, enchanted land
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  and run around going USA with little American flags.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  You scumbag neocon followers.
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  You don't care about our troops that got killed in Somalia.
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.000]  You just scumbag.
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  I mean, I think about it.
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.000]  These are admittedly the people that did this.
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  But by the time it gets on Sean Hannity.
[29:14.000 --> 29:22.000]  You see, because the national story is that it was three Al Qaeda operatives just went into the country and were hiding there.
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  So we had to blow it up.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  Attack three cities.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  Kill hundreds.
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.000]  And then, but that is enough.
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.000]  That lie isn't enough.
[29:33.000 --> 29:42.000]  Then, for propaganda purposes, they get on Limbaugh and Hannity and Beck and all the shows, Borts.
[29:42.000 --> 29:49.000]  And they get on there and they say, man, we just paid them back for what they did in 1993.
[29:49.000 --> 29:54.000]  And again, these people calling in going, I'm glad we're killing them Islamos.
[29:54.000 --> 29:58.000]  Hit them before they hit us, they can't find the Horn of Africa.
[29:58.000 --> 30:00.000]  They don't even know what that is.
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.000]  Bush thinks Nigeria is a continent.
[30:04.000 --> 30:07.000]  You know?
[30:07.000 --> 30:13.000]  No, it's 248 million people, the most populous African nation on the West Coast.
[30:13.000 --> 30:16.000]  And I'm not even some geography expert.
[30:16.000 --> 30:19.000]  I mean, they're just, you're idiots.
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.000]  And you think you're going to be free being that ignorant?
[30:22.000 --> 30:27.000]  We're on the march.
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[30:30.000 --> 30:35.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:35.000 --> 30:38.000]  Ted Anderson, Formatis, January 11, 2007.
[30:38.000 --> 30:45.000]  Gold 61180 ounce gold coins, 332.20, 318.65 per half, 159.32 per quarter ounce.
[30:45.000 --> 30:49.000]  That's 632.20, 318.65, 159.32.
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  1971, this encloses the gold window.
[30:52.000 --> 30:57.000]  Fiat currency, 1920s, the German mark explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[30:57.000 --> 31:00.000]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[31:00.000 --> 31:04.000]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[31:04.000 --> 31:07.000]  1998, gold jumps two thirds over the Russian ruble.
[31:07.000 --> 31:10.000]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[31:10.000 --> 31:15.000]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold.
[31:15.000 --> 31:16.000]  And other raw goods.
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  Could government let this happen?
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  Is it idiot backing how much will it lose?
[31:20.000 --> 31:23.000]  Midas has Nick Bereshev's report covering the loss of purchasing power.
[31:23.000 --> 31:27.000]  Fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities and gold oil relationship.
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[31:29.000 --> 31:33.000]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[31:33.000 --> 31:36.000]  That's 800-686-2237.
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.000]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  According to the CWC of the 43 million people who observed in the major wars
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War,
[31:45.000 --> 31:48.000]  1 million never made it home alive.
[31:48.000 --> 31:51.000]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.000]  or know a great soul who is currently serving our country.
[31:54.000 --> 31:57.000]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  who spend their lives protecting our freedom
[31:59.000 --> 32:02.000]  and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
