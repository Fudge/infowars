[00:00.000 --> 00:12.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.560 --> 00:20.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:20.120 --> 00:37.320]  Texas Alex Jones well it happened back on June of 2009 federal government told
[00:37.320 --> 00:46.640]  us that the economy was great almost two years ago it'll be two years coming up
[00:46.640 --> 00:54.260]  in a month or less than a month and every major street level indicator is the
[00:54.260 --> 01:00.000]  economy is in freefall the Japanese three weeks ago several days into the
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.600]  disaster at Fukushima told us everything was under control no radiation
[01:05.600 --> 01:12.800]  are low levels now they're reporting today the LA Times CNN 7.5 million times
[01:12.800 --> 01:18.360]  legal limit being dumped in the ocean the federal government's response is to
[01:18.360 --> 01:24.440]  basically try to block the release of state and local radiation monitor
[01:24.440 --> 01:30.280]  information in the United States and to have the Food and Drug Administration as
[01:30.280 --> 01:37.840]  well as the EPA not release numbers on the different types of produce that
[01:37.840 --> 01:44.200]  they're testing here in the US India who is basically on the other side of the
[01:44.200 --> 01:49.320]  world comparatively the way the winds are blowing it starts in Japan blows
[01:49.320 --> 01:54.560]  across the Pacific across North America across the Atlantic across Western
[01:54.560 --> 01:59.400]  Europe Eastern Europe the Middle East Central Asia Asia hits the subcontinent
[01:59.400 --> 02:06.640]  of India Central Asia and then you got to go back over into the Far East or
[02:06.640 --> 02:14.920]  Japan and India has banned banned bringing in any type of Japanese produce
[02:14.920 --> 02:19.640]  or fish don't hold your breath for that to happen here they tell you hey eat that
[02:19.640 --> 02:27.240]  core exit shrimp and they'll get a local person on from Louisiana going it's good
[02:27.240 --> 02:32.760]  go now you can get it it's good we got shrimp it's good for you I'm gonna eat
[02:32.760 --> 02:38.840]  it my kids gonna eat it gonna be good for you come on you know come on be peter
[02:38.840 --> 02:43.520]  but they say they're gonna do they help us out yeah they give us money for what
[02:43.520 --> 02:48.120]  we lost if we work a slave for them and get on down here this would be this core
[02:48.120 --> 02:54.120]  exit good for you good for you good to go to eat it I mean that's what's going
[02:54.120 --> 02:57.720]  on here and I feel sorry for the poor folks down always again or in South
[02:57.720 --> 03:06.040]  Texas or in Mississippi and they go out and they get people from far southeast
[03:06.040 --> 03:11.560]  Texas to go BP did the right thing they came in and helped us the shrimps good
[03:11.560 --> 03:16.680]  come on and get it a year later they test the shrimp and they're full of all
[03:16.680 --> 03:20.920]  sorts of toxins my whole point is our government is not gonna be like India
[03:20.920 --> 03:26.560]  they're gonna tell you bring in that fish bring in that Japanese seaweed bring
[03:26.560 --> 03:32.640]  in all the little vitals and things that they you know mix in at the sushi shops
[03:32.640 --> 03:38.880]  and have fun because it's good and you know they do the demographics they'll
[03:38.880 --> 03:43.560]  get some New York engineer on these TV ads with BP run the last six months or
[03:43.560 --> 03:49.240]  so going I'm from New York and I'm down here and the Gulf helping with my
[03:49.240 --> 03:54.320]  scientific research to make things better and I tell you the water is clean
[03:54.320 --> 03:57.960]  and the food is good all right I don't know how good of a New York accent I'm
[03:57.960 --> 04:06.880]  doing now oh man I I'm gonna cover all this news when we get back and we do have
[04:06.880 --> 04:16.080]  Peter Schiff joining us Ron Paul is of course joining us and then we also have
[04:16.080 --> 04:20.840]  Bernard von Nuthouse they want to confiscate a 7 million in silver coins
[04:20.840 --> 04:24.480]  they say look you're not allowed to print up silver coins in America and you're
[04:24.480 --> 04:27.840]  not allowed to criticize the Federal Reserve and so they found a federal
[04:27.840 --> 04:33.880]  jury of low-grade morons I mean they they got juries all the time sending
[04:33.880 --> 04:37.840]  people to prison for owning legal guns I mean they got juries in Texas you're
[04:37.840 --> 04:40.960]  found the legal shotgun in your home because some neighbor thought it was
[04:40.960 --> 04:45.440]  scary you're going to prison it doesn't matter so it's the same thing here I
[04:45.440 --> 04:49.080]  mean you got a general public that can't even tie their shoelaces they're
[04:49.080 --> 04:52.440]  like well you've seen the reports people trying to buy stuff with two dollar
[04:52.440 --> 05:02.880]  bills at stores get arrested all over the country Alex told you the government
[05:02.880 --> 05:07.560]  announced recently that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the
[05:07.560 --> 05:11.480]  millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps the
[05:11.480 --> 05:14.800]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[05:14.800 --> 05:18.440]  of us things seemed to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news
[05:18.440 --> 05:22.680]  either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition to
[05:22.680 --> 05:26.240]  converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a

[08:01.160 --> 08:09.320]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:16.560 --> 08:22.440]  we are live it is Tuesday the fifth day of April 2011 we have a jam-packed
[08:22.440 --> 08:27.800]  transmission or you lined up today political researcher and economist
[08:27.800 --> 08:32.280]  Peter Schiff who's been very accurate in his forecast in the economy will be
[08:32.280 --> 08:37.560]  joining us on the reports that the government has spent eight times its
[08:37.560 --> 08:43.000]  monthly revenue just last month also the looming government shutdown the same
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.360]  stunt that Clinton pulled back in the mid-1990s then congressman Ron Paul is
[08:48.360 --> 08:53.000]  going to be popping in later in the second hour and then Bernard von Nothaus
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.880]  who for decades had multiple collector memorabilia coin companies I remember
[08:58.880 --> 09:02.960]  seeing the TV ads actually when I was a little kid for his Hawaiian meant
[09:02.960 --> 09:06.960]  advertising coins and he put out the Liberty dollar it's got to be more than
[09:06.960 --> 09:11.680]  15 years ago and operated for 15 years and they came in confiscated seven
[09:11.680 --> 09:17.600]  million dollars in silver coins and gold coins and had a jury convict him of
[09:17.600 --> 09:22.600]  barter basically and the Associated Press basically has that statement and
[09:22.600 --> 09:28.600]  remember back in 1933 they told everybody they said turn your gold into
[09:28.600 --> 09:33.440]  the government we're gonna give you paper and most people refuse to do it but
[09:33.440 --> 09:36.840]  some did and then a year later they doubled the price of gold and people
[09:36.840 --> 09:40.960]  are like well then why do you say buy gold look I bought gold and silver and
[09:40.960 --> 09:44.720]  I'm not giving it up just like when the census people show up and say tell me
[09:44.720 --> 09:49.240]  what guns you own what stocks and bonds I say listen get off my front porch I'm
[09:49.240 --> 09:53.200]  gonna call the police for trespassing and I'm warning you get off my porch
[09:53.200 --> 09:57.880]  right now okay don't sit there with your baloney I happen to know the
[09:57.880 --> 10:01.360]  Constitution and if you don't stand up for your rights you don't have them
[10:01.360 --> 10:05.360]  okay the government's going to trample them if you don't stand up for them the
[10:05.360 --> 10:10.120]  government is a criminal enterprise both parties at the top are bought and
[10:10.120 --> 10:14.600]  paid for it's just that simple now here's the other news and and quite
[10:14.600 --> 10:18.800]  frankly this happens every few months where I read the news I go over the
[10:18.800 --> 10:25.560]  news and it is so off the charts horrible and there's so many facets of
[10:25.560 --> 10:30.400]  deception to break down I don't even know where to start it is now a hundred
[10:30.400 --> 10:35.360]  percent confirmed that radiation levels are dangerously high on the west coast
[10:35.360 --> 10:41.320]  multiple universities have picked up between 50 and 181 times safe levels of
[10:41.320 --> 10:48.200]  just one radioactive isotope of radioactive iodine and it is confirmed
[10:48.200 --> 10:51.960]  that the feds are basically telling people not at universities and state
[10:51.960 --> 10:55.840]  institutions not to report it and they're now not reporting it after they
[10:55.840 --> 10:59.960]  first put out numbers the last week and the feds are not releasing numbers and
[10:59.960 --> 11:03.920]  they're claiming that in Canada and the US most government radiation detectors
[11:03.920 --> 11:08.720]  have been quote switched off and I have that in my stack of news here today and
[11:08.720 --> 11:14.080]  there is no discussion or talk about testing fish from Japan or stopping
[11:14.080 --> 11:19.040]  imports of vegetables or fruits from Japan India and others are banning all
[11:19.040 --> 11:25.080]  imports from Japan of food and produce Toyota's put out advisories when you buy
[11:25.080 --> 11:31.240]  a Toyota now there may be radiation in the car that's about the only company
[11:31.240 --> 11:35.280]  actually trying to warn people a little bit or at least you tell them up front
[11:35.280 --> 11:38.520]  there could be some radiation here to cover their hind ends I think Toyota's
[11:38.520 --> 11:41.680]  got a great product I'm not here bashing them because it's a foreign company
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.920]  Japan's actually built more factories here than GM has in the last decade but
[11:46.920 --> 11:51.160]  that's going on I mean here's some of the headlines on that front and I've got
[11:51.160 --> 11:53.920]  all these guests coming up but I could talk for three hours just on this but
[11:53.920 --> 11:57.920]  such a big deal and it illustrates how corrupt the government is Japan's
[11:57.920 --> 12:03.920]  ocean radiation hits 7.5 million times legal limit that's LA times Japanese
[12:03.920 --> 12:07.640]  government admits seeing in radiation and water rushing into sea test
[12:07.640 --> 12:12.280]  millions of times over limit Japan radiation evacuees left in dark about
[12:12.280 --> 12:16.640]  life after shelters doctors don't want to treat them because they believe it's
[12:16.640 --> 12:19.600]  dangerous to even treat people that have been exposed this much radiation
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.720]  that's actually true but hey you signed on to be a doctor to be a nurse so even
[12:24.720 --> 12:28.160]  it's dangerous you know somebody's got some communicable Ebola you're supposed
[12:28.160 --> 12:34.160]  to treat them so very shameful there EPA to raise limits for radiation
[12:34.160 --> 12:38.920]  exposure all Canada turns off fallout detectors Mike Adams has got a report up
[12:38.920 --> 12:43.040]  at info wars dot com on this and he links to all the mainstream news where
[12:43.040 --> 12:46.720]  they just bury it and footnotes that they're raising the legal radiation
[12:46.720 --> 12:50.160]  exposure limit that way they can say well this isn't bad we've raised the
[12:50.160 --> 12:54.200]  limit kind of like back in 1991 they said to the troops well we told you don't
[12:54.200 --> 12:58.360]  use DU before but now we're saying it's good for you also government holding
[12:58.360 --> 13:03.640]  radiation data back IAEA gets info but public doesn't so the UN gets it the
[13:03.640 --> 13:08.240]  Japanese government's reporting but we don't and Japan says look dumping
[13:08.240 --> 13:12.440]  radioactive water into the ocean doesn't violate law even if it's 7.5
[13:12.440 --> 13:20.640]  million times safe levels and it just continues on from there and you better
[13:20.640 --> 13:28.720]  believe that we are not going to get any information out of the federal
[13:28.720 --> 13:34.560]  government on what's happening and they are running around basically now since
[13:34.560 --> 13:40.880]  the weekend when Berkeley with the state monitoring facilities there reported
[13:40.880 --> 13:49.120]  181 times safe radioactive isotope of iodine 131 in the water that now they've
[13:49.120 --> 13:53.520]  suddenly stopped releasing information so that's going on on that front the
[13:53.520 --> 13:56.720]  government here in the United States that is the government that's run by
[13:56.720 --> 14:00.920]  foreign banks the occupational government and that's where it is that isn't
[14:00.920 --> 14:05.440]  radio rhetoric okay we are captured we have been signed on to the banks debt we
[14:05.440 --> 14:09.160]  are debt slaves until we stand up and say we're not slaves wall street journal
[14:09.160 --> 14:13.120]  reporting FBI questions Libyans in the US ahead of what they could believe
[14:13.120 --> 14:18.200]  believe could be preparations for Gaddafi to strike back and then that'll
[14:18.200 --> 14:21.160]  be great for the criminals that run the government because they can just stage
[14:21.160 --> 14:24.760]  the events themselves or hope the Gaddafi does something as a way to take
[14:24.760 --> 14:30.600]  more of our liberties and grandstand as our saviors and expand wars again you're
[14:30.600 --> 14:37.840]  not supposed to call it a war also alberidae the former UN IEA chief is
[14:37.840 --> 14:43.560]  coming out renouncing the Zionist regime of Israel and saying that if there's
[14:43.560 --> 14:48.640]  any more attacks on the Gaza that borders Egypt and Israel that they will
[14:48.640 --> 14:56.680]  declare war on Israel so there is the US backed minion on record sent in a week
[14:56.680 --> 15:00.440]  before the rioting started to remove the old dictator is mubarak he's a front
[15:00.440 --> 15:04.640]  runner and upcoming elections and alberidae is probably just trying to
[15:04.640 --> 15:09.720]  score political points by saying they'll declare war on the Zionist regime so
[15:09.720 --> 15:15.880]  just more theater out of that continuing oil hits a hundred and twenty
[15:15.880 --> 15:21.000]  dollars after strike in Gabon the small African country you've also got the
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  French fully invading the eye of the country of ivory coast openly trying to
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.120]  install a new minion and backing up the rebels who are slaughtering people with
[15:32.120 --> 15:35.200]  machetes and machine guns in mass that's all confirmed but that's what the
[15:35.200 --> 15:38.840]  good guys do they have to intervene to make sure the slaughter happens like the
[15:38.840 --> 15:43.800]  UN in 94 and Rwanda entered thousand slaughtered under UN support continuing
[15:43.800 --> 15:47.600]  old prices at all time high in Britain and that means bad news for motorists
[15:47.600 --> 15:54.320]  and possibly for homeowners continuing the OPEC is saying no emergency meeting
[15:54.320 --> 15:59.360]  to try to cut prices and here's Reuters certainly backing up what Lindsey
[15:59.360 --> 16:03.640]  Williams said coming up on six months ago let me see October November December
[16:03.640 --> 16:10.560]  January February March yeah that's six months ago back in October said that his
[16:10.560 --> 16:15.320]  insiders were telling him it would go to $200 a barrel and now here is the
[16:15.320 --> 16:23.880]  Reuters headline oil could hit 200 to $300 on Saudi unrest and Yemen unrest but
[16:23.880 --> 16:29.520]  don't worry Fox News yesterday reported that the Yemen government is doing what
[16:29.520 --> 16:34.320]  it has to the machine gun crowds of protesters because if they don't al-Qaeda
[16:34.320 --> 16:38.440]  will come in in the power vacuum and take over Yemen but it's al-Qaeda
[16:38.440 --> 16:43.200]  publicly the core even the Wall Street Journal admits of the rebels against
[16:43.200 --> 16:48.280]  Qaddafi and the special forces US and British arming them but but never mind
[16:48.280 --> 16:54.480]  reality you know I listen to mainline neocontok radio I monitor it I skip
[16:54.480 --> 16:59.440]  around on the channels in the morning and at night when I'm driving and all
[16:59.440 --> 17:03.400]  they talk about is not the bankers raping us not the private Federal Reserve
[17:03.400 --> 17:08.280]  not the out-of-control federal government it's all just Muslims are going to get
[17:08.280 --> 17:14.400]  you Muslims are dangerous Muslims are evil Muslims want to murder you and
[17:14.400 --> 17:18.480]  undoubtedly out of a billion 300 million Muslims there are a lot of whack jobs
[17:18.480 --> 17:22.600]  and crazies maybe one two percent but that's in every group the issue is the
[17:22.600 --> 17:27.240]  Muslims are all stirred up because the globalist have used the US and Europe to
[17:27.240 --> 17:33.240]  put hundreds of bases in and around the Middle East hundreds of bases over a
[17:33.240 --> 17:38.760]  thousand US bases total outside the US but hundreds and hundreds of bases in
[17:38.760 --> 17:43.720]  and around constant invasions constant overthrows dictators being propped up
[17:43.720 --> 17:48.800]  dictators being removed new dictators being put in we didn't buy all of our
[17:48.800 --> 17:52.280]  oil or a lot of it from the Middle East they wouldn't have all this money to have
[17:52.280 --> 18:00.640]  all these weapons but this is all part of this clash of civilizations and just
[18:00.640 --> 18:05.480]  like they send an alberi to start saying war with Israel Zionists we're going to
[18:05.480 --> 18:10.120]  get you and the US government's putting him in and the US government Israel are
[18:10.120 --> 18:13.640]  locked at the hip and then Israel we will use those threats to crack down on
[18:13.640 --> 18:17.400]  freedom of the press in Israel and keep their warmongering going I mean look
[18:17.400 --> 18:21.040]  these military systems and these banking systems that use the military to
[18:21.040 --> 18:24.840]  control the countries whether it's Europe the US Israel or China for that
[18:24.840 --> 18:30.600]  matter they love the threat of internal insurrection as a pretext to crack down
[18:30.600 --> 18:36.440]  on everybody and to have no bid contracts and to have the lion's share of the
[18:36.440 --> 18:42.680]  economy pumped into defense and that's why this stuff's never gonna end you
[18:42.680 --> 18:47.400]  know you've got Glenn Beck and Limbaugh and all them talking about the
[18:47.400 --> 18:51.600]  communist talking about George Soros talking about the unions and how
[18:51.600 --> 18:57.160]  dangerous they are but then acting like they're the end all be all they're the
[18:57.160 --> 19:02.160]  people that caused the problem and if we just got rid of the welfare we wouldn't
[19:02.160 --> 19:07.360]  be bankrupt well I've done the math with countless top economists here we've done
[19:07.360 --> 19:11.040]  the math with Ron Paul here you could cut all the welfare all the pensions
[19:11.040 --> 19:19.480]  everything it won't pay a fraction of the 1.5 could quadrillion 1,500 trillion
[19:19.480 --> 19:23.800]  conservatively even the Washington Post admits it's 600 plus trillion it won't
[19:23.800 --> 19:30.360]  pay a fraction of that so they're just scapegoating all about unions and
[19:30.360 --> 19:34.080]  welfare moms and welfare queens and certainly there's abuse there and
[19:34.080 --> 19:40.160]  problems but it's rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic and I never hear
[19:40.160 --> 19:47.160]  these neocons talking about the banksters that financed Clinton Bush Obama I
[19:47.160 --> 19:52.880]  mean that's the issue you don't stop them none of it matters then I was on
[19:52.880 --> 19:57.480]  Tom Hartman's TV show last night and I'm gonna talk about that when we get back
[19:57.480 --> 20:20.560]  and then I got a bunch of other news and Ron Paul's coming up stay with us just

[21:08.600 --> 21:11.920]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[21:11.920 --> 21:17.240]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[21:17.240 --> 21:22.200]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling
[21:22.200 --> 21:25.760]  them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about
[21:25.760 --> 21:30.480]  70% of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our
[21:30.480 --> 21:34.280]  friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar
[21:34.280 --> 21:37.920]  will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their

[23:44.080 --> 23:47.000]  the liberties of the people than a standing army hi Ted Anderson I'm

[24:05.080 --> 24:13.960]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind six
[24:13.960 --> 24:18.920]  megabanks are above the law they are publicly allowed to launder drug money
[24:18.920 --> 24:26.520]  to own and run the drug aircraft to finance the weapons everything they're
[24:26.520 --> 24:30.320]  allowed to take the veterans death benefits it's all been stolen as of
[24:30.320 --> 24:36.480]  11 years ago they took the police the fire the teacher the private pension
[24:36.480 --> 24:41.400]  funds that were invested in derivatives they imploded it they stole your assets
[24:41.400 --> 24:48.880]  they got the Congress to sign on to the debt and now they're gonna hold the
[24:48.880 --> 24:52.920]  public hostage and say give us more taxes give us more government and then
[24:52.920 --> 24:57.880]  you might get part of your pension then they blame capitalism and the free
[24:57.880 --> 25:03.640]  market for it I saw an IMF report out today saying capitalism is outdated this
[25:03.640 --> 25:09.720]  isn't capitalism this is thieves criminals in there working with government
[25:09.720 --> 25:13.880]  so that they're above the law and so there's not a financially fair or level
[25:13.880 --> 25:19.280]  playing field to consolidate wealth but the mainline Republicans won't tell you
[25:19.280 --> 25:22.480]  that they tell you corporations are always perfect and good not when they're
[25:22.480 --> 25:26.920]  bigger than governments and operate above the law and write trade deals to
[25:26.920 --> 25:30.680]  shut down their competition that they're exempt from just like Obama and the
[25:30.680 --> 25:35.880]  insurance companies writing the insurance law to force you to buy their
[25:35.880 --> 25:40.440]  insurance and then to lower the quality of it and then they exempt all of
[25:40.440 --> 25:45.240]  Obama's minions from having to buy it true economic discrimination this is the
[25:45.240 --> 25:53.920]  system or in a fraudulent kleptocracy not socialism not even capitalism no
[25:53.920 --> 26:01.040]  just a criminal system and I was on Tom Hartman's TV show it's on free speech
[26:01.040 --> 26:05.640]  TV it's on RT that's a popular show Tom Hartman's a very smart you know
[26:05.640 --> 26:12.560]  mainline liberal guy and it was painful to be on his TV show last night and he
[26:12.560 --> 26:18.000]  because he was using sophomoric childlike deceptive ridiculous statements to
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.560]  make state nullification 10th amendment sound illegal and ridiculous he was
[26:24.560 --> 26:30.200]  saying well if Texas secedes I don't trust Rick Perry with nuclear weapons and
[26:30.200 --> 26:34.640]  I said a Texas isn't going to secede Perry's not a real secessionist
[26:34.640 --> 26:39.200]  nullification simply means under the 9th and 10th amendment that the states
[26:39.200 --> 26:45.360]  also in the Declaration of Independence can basically declare their just
[26:45.360 --> 26:49.560]  powers and when the federal government gets out of control and the federal
[26:49.560 --> 26:53.760]  government itself has been fully seized through globalism and all of these
[26:53.760 --> 26:57.440]  treaties they've signed with private institutions like the IMF World Bank
[26:57.440 --> 27:02.200]  World Trade Organization and so we need the states to take over to just get our
[27:02.200 --> 27:06.680]  country back and he would use sophomoric little statements about but we don't
[27:06.680 --> 27:11.160]  want Rick Perry with nukes to make his audience basically have the idea that
[27:11.160 --> 27:17.360]  some new civil war was coming it's not an adult discussion and it's not an adult
[27:17.360 --> 27:24.320]  discussion with Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh and people because they they
[27:24.320 --> 27:35.400]  narrow the spectrum of debate down to basically simplistic ideas that don't
[27:35.400 --> 27:40.520]  even begin to fully explain what's happening what's happening to America
[27:40.520 --> 27:44.760]  has been planned what's happening to America I told you 16 years ago was
[27:44.760 --> 27:48.240]  being engineered 12 years ago with economists when they got rid of Glass
[27:48.240 --> 27:51.960]  Stegel and created the derivatives which allowed them to go from fractional
[27:51.960 --> 27:56.520]  reserve banking where banks loan out $10 for every dollar of deposits to
[27:56.520 --> 28:03.600]  unlimited made-up financial instruments that were designed to transfer all power
[28:03.600 --> 28:09.080]  fraudulently through the Ponzi scheme to the international banking cartel and
[28:09.080 --> 28:13.160]  then when once they implode it which is now happening they hold everyone
[28:13.160 --> 28:17.280]  hostage and say give us even more power more control we're setting up a new
[28:17.280 --> 28:21.720]  Bretton Woods system George Soros is meeting today to get that job done as
[28:21.720 --> 28:26.280]  as the globalist engineer of the crisis and then offer the solution giving them
[28:26.280 --> 28:31.880]  even more power over every facet of society then they use the economic
[28:31.880 --> 28:35.480]  threat to consolidate the economic structure under their control even more
[28:35.480 --> 28:39.560]  and they use the manufactured terror threat you got a better chance of dying
[28:39.560 --> 28:43.760]  from a honeybee sting or dying in a car wreck they don't care they hype it to
[28:43.760 --> 28:47.120]  where we're taking your rights we're militarizing police we're setting up
[28:47.120 --> 28:51.360]  citizen spy brigades to fight Al Qaeda then you get the internal training
[28:51.360 --> 28:56.320]  manuals none of it has to do with Al Qaeda or Muammar Gaddafi or the Iranians
[28:56.320 --> 29:01.840]  it all has to do with gun owners real libertarians conservatives real
[29:01.840 --> 29:06.480]  anti-war activists anybody that this power structure on the left and right
[29:06.480 --> 29:11.840]  sees as a threat they're openly moving towards censorship of the internet
[29:11.840 --> 29:15.720]  they're openly talking about restricting free speech if it quote hurts
[29:15.720 --> 29:21.760]  military efforts they're openly trying to introduce us to an autocratic command
[29:21.760 --> 29:28.400]  and control anti-liberty system and they've been bankrupting us by design
[29:28.400 --> 29:35.920]  to make a servile debt slaves to this cartel and it's either us or the globalist
[29:35.920 --> 29:40.240]  it's that simple all right Peter Schiff is coming up to break down what's
[29:40.240 --> 29:44.120]  happening on the economy we're also got Ron Paul coming up popping in in the
[29:44.120 --> 29:48.920]  next hour and then we've got the gentleman who's been arrested for

[35:51.040 --> 35:57.120]  host of issues a it is being reported by cyber news service and others March
[35:57.120 --> 36:00.920]  madness US government spent more than eight times its monthly revenue in the
[36:00.920 --> 36:07.440]  month of March also the Liberty dollar folks has been convicted mr.
[36:07.440 --> 36:12.080]  Knuthoss and on top of that the feds are trying to forfeiture seven million
[36:12.080 --> 36:15.680]  dollars in silver and gold coins that they have and they're trying to push the
[36:15.680 --> 36:20.720]  idea that they can basically confiscate gold and silver this we have to stand
[36:20.720 --> 36:27.080]  together or hang separate. Peter Schiff is CEO and chief global strategist for
[36:27.080 --> 36:31.200]  Euro Pacific Capital Inc. Mr. Schiff began his investment career as a financial
[36:31.200 --> 36:36.880]  consultant with Lehman Brothers after having earned a degree in finance and
[36:36.880 --> 36:41.040]  accounting from UC Berkeley a financial professional for over 20 years he
[36:41.040 --> 36:45.920]  joined Euro Pacific in 96 and has served as president since January 2000 he's
[36:45.920 --> 36:49.840]  also contributing commentator for Newsweek International and serves as a
[36:49.840 --> 36:55.160]  economic advisor to the 2008 Ron Paul presidential campaign EuroPak.net is
[36:55.160 --> 36:59.560]  the website Peter thank you for joining us today well thanks for having me on
[36:59.560 --> 37:02.960]  Alex and in just to remind your audience you know my show immediately
[37:02.960 --> 37:07.600]  procedures show on this network now I'm on for two hours a day from 10 to noon on
[37:07.600 --> 37:11.560]  GCN absolutely excited to have you as a member of the team I've heard the show
[37:11.560 --> 37:16.000]  sounds great Peter so much to talk about Britain Woods 2 going on with
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.960]  Soros today IMF coming out saying capitalism has failed but this system
[37:21.960 --> 37:27.960]  of crony capitalism or inside corrupt mega banks getting government to
[37:27.960 --> 37:34.960]  basically make the public pay for their losses that's not capitalism is it no
[37:34.960 --> 37:40.320]  not at all capitalism works everywhere it's tried the problem is capitalism is
[37:40.320 --> 37:44.520]  often also is often infected with diseases socialism or statism that's
[37:44.520 --> 37:47.960]  what happens so whatever you mix capitalism with socialism and you
[37:47.960 --> 37:53.040]  create problems the politicians always blame the problems on capitalism and
[37:53.040 --> 37:57.400]  they ignore the fact that they were introduced by the socialist legislation
[37:57.400 --> 38:04.000]  that prevented capitalism from working that's what's happening and now we see
[38:04.000 --> 38:11.800]  the Democrats trying to sick the unions and people on other Americans that that
[38:11.800 --> 38:18.960]  want to see the budget cut what's your basic a political forecast on where
[38:18.960 --> 38:22.720]  this country currently is and where it's going well we're in a lot of trouble you
[38:22.720 --> 38:26.280]  know and and the country is going to get into deeper trouble because we
[38:26.280 --> 38:29.720]  continue to repeat the mistakes that created the problems in the first place
[38:29.720 --> 38:34.480]  and you know when we're trying they're trying to couch the argument of cutting
[38:34.480 --> 38:39.000]  back on government spending as somehow being anti workers because after all
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.840]  government workers are going to see their pay cut if we cut back on government
[38:43.840 --> 38:48.720]  but if we don't do that then we have to cut the pay of everybody in the private
[38:48.720 --> 38:52.960]  sector because we have to raise their taxes to continue to pay government
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.440]  workers more money than their bosses in the private sector are making so if you
[38:57.440 --> 39:00.600]  really want to be on the side of the working man then you've got to be for
[39:00.600 --> 39:04.880]  smaller government because the working man cannot afford the massive government
[39:04.880 --> 39:09.440]  bureaucracy that he's being forced to pay for right now well if you look at a
[39:09.440 --> 39:13.360]  lot of the super rich at the brokerage houses in megabanks that have gotten the
[39:13.360 --> 39:18.040]  you know the trillions in bailout money they're financing the George Soros
[39:18.040 --> 39:22.800]  crowds the unions on record to then put out numbers about five percent of the
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.880]  population has half the wealth and and basically the ultra rich many of them are
[39:27.880 --> 39:33.320]  trying to sick the uninformed blue collar folks some of them on the middle
[39:33.320 --> 39:38.600]  class who on average is really paying around 40% in federal income taxes so
[39:38.600 --> 39:41.900]  do you agree with me that basically you've got a lot of insiders who are
[39:41.900 --> 39:45.520]  ultra wealthy trying to scapegoat things on to the middle class well
[39:45.520 --> 39:49.560]  certainly you've got a small segment of the wealthy people who got their wealth
[39:49.560 --> 39:54.200]  through government subsidies or special access granted by government or through
[39:54.200 --> 39:58.680]  the central bank a lot of Wall Street bankers financiers are getting rich as
[39:58.680 --> 40:02.520]  the Federal Reserve helps them you know bleed the rest of the country but the
[40:02.520 --> 40:06.720]  vast majority of Americans who have wealth achieved it honestly they started
[40:06.720 --> 40:10.080]  legitimate businesses they didn't get special government breaks in fact they
[40:10.080 --> 40:13.600]  had to overcome all the obstacles and hurdles that the government put in their
[40:13.600 --> 40:17.800]  path they are the real heroes they create the wealth provide the goods and
[40:17.800 --> 40:21.120]  services provide the employment opportunities and it's unfair that
[40:21.120 --> 40:25.800]  they're getting tarred with the same brush and when you have the central bank
[40:25.800 --> 40:29.440]  doing what they're doing it giving capitalism a bad name it is it is
[40:29.440 --> 40:34.840]  stoking the fears of socialism and feeding this class war fear because the
[40:34.840 --> 40:38.360]  average Americans are getting poor the value of their wages the value of their
[40:38.360 --> 40:42.080]  savings is being destroyed by the government by the Federal Reserve and
[40:42.080 --> 40:46.520]  as they fall further and further behind they're looking for someone to blame and
[40:46.520 --> 40:51.800]  when they see in the media these Wall Street tycoons making a fortune it's
[40:51.800 --> 40:56.840]  very easy for the demagogues to come in and channel that rage and beat the
[40:56.840 --> 41:01.400]  drums for socialism get the rich soak the rich you know take their money and
[41:01.400 --> 41:05.080]  then of course once you go down that path there's no turning back because
[41:05.080 --> 41:09.560]  everybody everybody has somebody who's poorer than them who thinks they're
[41:09.560 --> 41:13.160]  rich and if you have the guy that's that's that's making a hundred thousand
[41:13.160 --> 41:16.200]  dollars a year wants to take money from the guy that's making a million dollars
[41:16.200 --> 41:19.280]  a year because he doesn't need all that money and make him pay his fair share
[41:19.280 --> 41:22.800]  well to the guy that's making 30,000 a year the guy that's making a hundred
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.440]  thousand a year he's rich and he doesn't need all that money either and then
[41:26.440 --> 41:31.040]  meanwhile we have General Electric, Google and a handful of other Fortune
[41:31.040 --> 41:36.800]  100 who help write the loopholes publicly in Congress they're paying zero
[41:36.800 --> 41:44.000]  tax or 2% tax or 2.5% tax and literally I've studied it they are the ones
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.960]  financing the big foundations at the universities teaching the young people
[41:49.960 --> 41:55.000]  that their future is based on wealth redistribution when the mega rich
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.760]  themselves have basically written the rules where they're exempt from this and
[41:59.760 --> 42:02.760]  meanwhile companies like General Electric would have been bankrupt if they
[42:02.760 --> 42:06.560]  didn't get bailed out and one of the reasons that they don't pay taxes because
[42:06.560 --> 42:10.360]  all the money that they lost during the financial crisis but of course they've
[42:10.360 --> 42:13.560]  been allowed to go bankrupt it would be a much different situation but meanwhile
[42:13.560 --> 42:18.640]  I own a small company my company Europe Pacific Capital I'm paying about 42 43%
[42:18.640 --> 42:22.760]  of my corporate income in taxes you know because I can't take advantage of all
[42:22.760 --> 42:26.400]  these loopholes and then whatever I you know my personal income I'm paying
[42:26.400 --> 42:31.040]  about 45% of what I earn in taxes and if they raise a much higher you know more
[42:31.040 --> 42:34.800]  than half my money is going to be stolen from me by the state and redistributed
[42:34.800 --> 42:39.120]  other people you know how much how long do they expect me to work if the
[42:39.120 --> 42:42.240]  government's going to take the fruits of my labor and how long am I going to go
[42:42.240 --> 42:46.280]  on employing people and paying these taxes if I'm turned into a into a surf
[42:46.280 --> 42:51.000]  and for those that don't know you can look this up China has much lower
[42:51.000 --> 42:56.080]  corporate income tax so do most other nations the United States has last time
[42:56.080 --> 43:03.120]  I checked one of the highest corporate income taxes in the world it's actually
[43:03.120 --> 43:07.080]  Alex the only country that has a higher tax is Japan but that's not actually
[43:07.080 --> 43:11.240]  true because you for people forget about the state corporate income taxes so if
[43:11.240 --> 43:16.440]  you have a corporation in New York or New Jersey or Connecticut or California or
[43:16.440 --> 43:21.360]  you know Chicago you're paying an income tax rate well north of 40% you know
[43:21.360 --> 43:25.160]  these other countries don't have the local income tax like we do they just
[43:25.160 --> 43:28.840]  have one income tax we have two and sometimes if there's a city income tax
[43:28.840 --> 43:32.680]  you got three yeah let me explain that to folks you know people say Texas is
[43:32.680 --> 43:37.320]  great because there's no state income tax but the truth is the last five years
[43:37.320 --> 43:44.440]  Texas has passed three new business taxes and they and they hit companies
[43:44.440 --> 43:47.200]  that start making over a hundred thousand dollars a year they have a
[43:47.200 --> 43:53.520]  franchise tax hospital district taxes several other taxes that now total
[43:53.520 --> 44:00.160]  federal tax corporate tax all the taxes I pay by the end of it I've got about
[44:00.160 --> 44:04.680]  40% to get to my employees and for equipment and things and then my
[44:04.680 --> 44:09.480]  employees all pay taxes Peter of course I mean I looked at my business
[44:09.480 --> 44:14.480]  Europe's you know my my brokerage firm the US government makes far more money
[44:14.480 --> 44:17.640]  from my brokerage firm than I do I mean certainly if you just take a look at the
[44:17.640 --> 44:21.120]  revenues that collects from me in my income tax but what about the income
[44:21.120 --> 44:25.200]  tax paid by over a hundred of my employees that you know because of me and
[44:25.200 --> 44:29.960]  then if you look at all the other fees and licensing fees and the government
[44:29.960 --> 44:35.000]  is making a fortune off of my business look at your cell phone bill I mean how
[44:35.000 --> 44:40.680]  many little taxes do they just add now to that I mean it's the water taxes the
[44:40.680 --> 44:44.320]  the trash taxes there's hundreds of these now now Peter in the time we've got
[44:44.320 --> 44:49.880]  left breaking down your prognosis of the economy it looks like everything you
[44:49.880 --> 44:53.720]  predicted five years ago is now happening the head of Walmart admits quote
[44:53.720 --> 44:59.080]  serious inflation is now starting more and more monetization of debt I mean are
[44:59.080 --> 45:04.320]  we now heading into that depression well yet you talk about taxation inflation is
[45:04.320 --> 45:07.640]  the most vicious form of taxation because people don't even realize they're
[45:07.640 --> 45:12.080]  paying it you know the government is blaming rising prices on speculators on
[45:12.080 --> 45:17.600]  foreign growth on the Middle East attention prices are rising because the
[45:17.600 --> 45:21.200]  government is printing money instead of taking money away from us in taxes and
[45:21.200 --> 45:24.720]  spending it they're robbing our purchasing power and when your purchasing
[45:24.720 --> 45:27.960]  powers robbed the way you see that is the price of everything that you need to
[45:27.960 --> 45:31.520]  buy is going up and this is what is happening and you mentioned you know
[45:31.520 --> 45:35.240]  earlier before you introduced me that in the month of March the government spent
[45:35.240 --> 45:39.280]  eight and a half times what it collected in tax revenues the lion's share of that
[45:39.280 --> 45:43.640]  money was going to repay maturing treasury debt and guess who how they
[45:43.640 --> 45:46.880]  were able to repay it by borrowing it from the Federal Reserve which bought
[45:46.880 --> 45:51.400]  about 70% of those new issues what is going to happen in a couple of months
[45:51.400 --> 45:54.400]  when the federal government has to borrow all this money and the Federal
[45:54.400 --> 45:58.160]  Reserve is not there you know either interest rates have to skyrocket to
[45:58.160 --> 46:01.480]  convince other people to buy or the Fed's gonna have to be back for QE
[46:01.480 --> 46:05.960]  through quick QE three but either way we got big big problems ahead I wanted to
[46:05.960 --> 46:10.120]  ask that question Europe for the first time in decades led with the
[46:10.120 --> 46:13.160]  announcement not the Fed that they're gonna go ahead and increase interest
[46:13.160 --> 46:16.880]  rates the Fed then followed and said maybe at the end of the year what is it
[46:16.880 --> 46:21.800]  going to do as interest rates rise why are they saying that's triggering further
[46:21.800 --> 46:26.120]  dollar devaluation well a they're not rising fast enough because just right
[46:26.120 --> 46:29.080]  raising interest rates by a quarter point here and a quarter point there
[46:29.080 --> 46:33.360]  ain't gonna do it you're still behind the curve the Fed has to get aggressive to
[46:33.360 --> 46:37.080]  fight inflation but the problem is it can't get aggressive because the entire
[46:37.080 --> 46:41.560]  phony recovery that we have going is built on a foundation of cheap money
[46:41.560 --> 46:45.720]  and cheap credit and if you take that foundation away the whole thing will
[46:45.720 --> 46:49.520]  implode so the Fed is in a box that if it wants to pretend the economy is
[46:49.520 --> 46:54.000]  growing it has to keep rates down and let inflation run out of control all it
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.320]  can do is lie about it pretend it doesn't exist and then when it shows up
[46:57.320 --> 47:02.720]  blame it on somebody else so what's the time frame here I mean you predicted the
[47:02.720 --> 47:09.680]  collapse of the phony and Freddie you you predicted what what happened in
[47:09.680 --> 47:15.360]  October of 2008 what's what's on the horizon and what's right down the street
[47:15.360 --> 47:18.760]  and what's standing right in front of us well I don't know exactly how much time
[47:18.760 --> 47:22.160]  we have I think you can measure it just a few short years and it might not even
[47:22.160 --> 47:26.520]  be that much time it might be six months I think a much greater financial crisis
[47:26.520 --> 47:31.360]  is coming you know what we had in 2008 was the was the overture the opera is
[47:31.360 --> 47:35.760]  only just begun and the reason it's going to be so bad is because of all the
[47:35.760 --> 47:39.520]  things the government did to save us from the pain they didn't save us from the
[47:39.520 --> 47:44.160]  pain they postponed it but made it much worse and I think you mentioned
[47:44.160 --> 47:48.120]  earlier about you know not house and how the government is you know trying to
[47:48.120 --> 47:52.800]  turn what he did into a counterfeiting or an act of terrorism if you look at
[47:52.800 --> 47:55.480]  what the government is doing they are laying the foundation for making it
[47:55.480 --> 47:59.680]  illegal to transit to buy gold and silver or sell gold and silver because
[47:59.680 --> 48:04.320]  what they said was that not house was a terrorist and what did he do right he
[48:04.320 --> 48:08.160]  didn't counterfeit us currency he created an alternative he tried to
[48:08.160 --> 48:13.480]  advocate using his liberty dollars instead of using us dollars he wasn't
[48:13.480 --> 48:17.640]  trying to confuse people over what they were he was he didn't try to create them
[48:17.640 --> 48:21.280]  so that he could pass them off pretending they were legitimate us currency
[48:21.280 --> 48:25.800]  his plan was he was saying US currency is no good it's gonna get inflated away so
[48:25.800 --> 48:29.960]  hold on to this instead and what the government says is that act the act of
[48:29.960 --> 48:33.680]  offering an alternative to the dollar makes you a terrorist well if he's a
[48:33.680 --> 48:36.880]  terrorist I'm a terrorist I got a precious metals company your Pacific
[48:36.880 --> 48:40.400]  precious metals I recommend that people buy gold and silver I sell gold and
[48:40.400 --> 48:44.960]  silver in my most recent newsletter I I wrote I recommended bar using gold and
[48:44.960 --> 48:49.680]  silver as a form of barter and so am I undermining the US monetary system
[48:49.680 --> 48:55.240]  no the globalist by devaluing the dollar by monetizing debt they're the ones
[48:55.240 --> 48:59.400]  that are doing it and so now now they're scared of alternatives that
[48:59.400 --> 49:04.160]  publicly challenged them and it's a very dangerous precedent absolutely the
[49:04.160 --> 49:08.520]  one who's undermining our monetary system is Ben Bernanke it's Congress
[49:08.520 --> 49:11.840]  they're debasing the money but what the government doesn't want is Americans to
[49:11.840 --> 49:15.240]  have an escape valve they don't want Americans to have an alternative they
[49:15.240 --> 49:18.720]  want to keep us bottled in that currency so they can keep stealing its value and
[49:18.720 --> 49:23.840]  this is shows you it's the camels nose under the tent you know first they go
[49:23.840 --> 49:27.640]  after this guy and then they expand it and eventually it's illegal to own it
[49:27.640 --> 49:31.560]  you can't because if you own if somebody owns gold they're undermining our
[49:31.560 --> 49:35.000]  monetary system after all they could have been saving in dollars I'm telling
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.960]  people to buy gold not to save dollars well I'm undermining our monetary
[49:38.960 --> 49:43.160]  system well the problem is it's already been undermined I understand that so I'm
[49:43.160 --> 49:46.640]  trying to get Americans to understand that if they don't want to be broke that
[49:46.640 --> 49:49.680]  they need to save something of real intrinsic value yeah the government
[49:49.680 --> 49:53.360]  doesn't want anybody doing well it's really simple let you yeah you've come
[49:53.360 --> 49:57.160]  out with a car that and we've come out with a car that works better has high
[49:57.160 --> 50:00.520]  quality we're telling people that a certain dealership has a record of
[50:00.520 --> 50:04.600]  selling cars that break down when you drive them off the lot and the car
[50:04.600 --> 50:09.360]  dealership has sent police to basically try to arrest us I mean that's really what
[50:09.360 --> 50:14.520]  it comes down to they don't want reality of precious metals getting in the way
[50:14.520 --> 50:18.520]  of their fraudulent system while you know goals at an all-time record high
[50:18.520 --> 50:23.160]  today finally Silver's at a new 31 year high and it's not like that we're
[50:23.160 --> 50:27.040]  trying to make cars and pass them off as these lousy cars that the government is
[50:27.040 --> 50:31.200]  making we are basically saying no the government's cars no good buy this one
[50:31.200 --> 50:35.160]  instead counterfeiting is when you if somebody counterfeits a hundred dollar
[50:35.160 --> 50:38.920]  bill they make it look exactly like a hundred dollar bill and they go and spend
[50:38.920 --> 50:42.440]  it and they hope the person thinks it's a legitimate a hundred dollar bill
[50:42.440 --> 50:46.920]  legal US tender that is not what anybody who is advocating golden silver
[50:46.920 --> 50:50.440]  ownership is doing in fact they're specifically stating that that money is
[50:50.440 --> 50:57.040]  no good stay there final segment coming up we'll look more at the economy

[51:05.720 --> 51:09.440]  that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the

[51:13.040 --> 51:17.200]  United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless all
[51:17.200 --> 51:21.360]  caused by the devalued US dollar while the mainstream media continues to ignore

[53:02.600 --> 53:06.440]  did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[53:06.440 --> 53:09.840]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[53:09.840 --> 53:13.640]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[53:13.640 --> 53:16.800]  seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[53:16.800 --> 53:20.720]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science
[53:20.720 --> 53:24.880]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[53:24.880 --> 53:29.760]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[53:29.760 --> 53:33.280]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[53:33.280 --> 53:37.080]  genetically modified in any way you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[53:37.080 --> 53:41.720]  full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[53:41.720 --> 53:52.520]  that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365
[53:52.520 --> 53:58.140]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[53:58.140 --> 54:02.360]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[54:07.600 --> 54:12.640]  so the private Federal Reserve teamed up with the government as basically
[54:12.640 --> 54:16.960]  destroyed the dollar devalued at their monetizing 70% of the debt that means
[54:16.960 --> 54:23.520]  Weimar Republic Zimbabwe Argentina and if you go back to 1933 they do not want
[54:23.520 --> 54:27.720]  to compete with gold and silver and as gold and silver continues its meteoric
[54:27.720 --> 54:30.560]  rise they have been trying to demonize it they've been trying to manipulate the
[54:30.560 --> 54:36.440]  market they're now failing against the laws of economics and we are just
[54:36.440 --> 54:40.280]  steamrolling into this crisis the very banksters that engineered this are now
[54:40.280 --> 54:44.920]  going to pose as our saviors and try to bring in even more controlled economies
[54:44.920 --> 54:48.560]  as the answer which never works it works for them not for the general public
[54:48.560 --> 54:52.600]  Peter how do we defeat these people well ultimately they're going to defeat
[54:52.600 --> 54:56.320]  themselves because that the whole economy is going to collapse around them we
[54:56.320 --> 54:59.760]  have to make sure that they get the blame for it that central banking and
[54:59.760 --> 55:03.880]  central government planning gets the blame all we've had is repeated doses
[55:03.880 --> 55:08.880]  of government stimulus the stimulus is the problem the stimulus is toxic that's
[55:08.880 --> 55:12.680]  why the government the country is so sick and we're not going to solve our
[55:12.680 --> 55:16.040]  problems with government stimulus we can't solve them until the government
[55:16.040 --> 55:19.600]  stops stimulating the problem is they never will because they don't have the
[55:19.600 --> 55:23.680]  political courage to take away the punchball because in order to get better
[55:23.680 --> 55:27.280]  we have to swallow some bitter tasting medicine we have to recognize that our
[55:27.280 --> 55:30.400]  economy is all screwed up we got too many people working for government too
[55:30.400 --> 55:33.880]  many people working in the service sector not enough people manufacturing and
[55:33.880 --> 55:37.160]  producing we got too many regulations we got too much rules we don't have enough
[55:37.160 --> 55:41.320]  savings a lot of things have to change and during that transition you know
[55:41.320 --> 55:45.520]  there's going to be winners and losers and the politicians don't want that
[55:45.520 --> 55:48.320]  because a lot of the losers are the ones that are voting these politicians in
[55:48.320 --> 55:51.440]  the office so they're just going to continue to pretend that they can make
[55:51.440 --> 55:54.600]  everything better with a magic wand that all we need is to print some more
[55:54.600 --> 55:57.920]  money to have some more spending and more stimulus and we'll solve these
[55:57.920 --> 56:00.920]  problems we're going to overdose on government stimulus they're going to
[56:00.920 --> 56:04.760]  kill this economy and and we're witnessing the beginnings of it right
[56:04.760 --> 56:08.960]  now I mean gold wouldn't be up $19 an ounce silver wouldn't be up almost 70
[56:08.960 --> 56:17.120]  cents today if if if what they were doing was working now are you concerned
[56:17.120 --> 56:20.800]  about this government shutdown the Democrats trying to hold people hostage
[56:20.800 --> 56:24.400]  if they don't increase spending now I'm concerned that it won't shut down I mean
[56:24.400 --> 56:28.080]  the government shutdown is the best thing that could happen to us because if the
[56:28.080 --> 56:30.880]  government doesn't shut down then the country is going to shut down the only
[56:30.880 --> 56:34.880]  way to save the country is to shut down the government and for spending cuts
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.360]  but we have a 1.6 trillion dollar budget deficit for this year and these
[56:39.360 --> 56:44.160]  clowns are arguing over whether we should cut that by 30 billion or 60 billion
[56:44.160 --> 56:49.560]  that's that's peanuts I mean you that's not gonna do anything with the the
[56:49.560 --> 56:54.000]  Republicans need to argue for real meaningful cuts in government spending
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.280]  because now even if they get what they want it's meaningless the whole economy
[56:58.280 --> 57:03.120]  is still gonna collapse exactly if we don't say no to the too big to fail
[57:03.120 --> 57:07.880]  derivatives model then then then everything else is just academic but
[57:07.880 --> 57:12.440]  but expanding finally on that to be clear about my point just like in October
[57:12.440 --> 57:17.640]  of 2008 the Treasury and Fed held the country hostage talked down the
[57:17.640 --> 57:22.240]  economy to cause that huge plunge to then get their bailout I'm saying they're
[57:22.240 --> 57:25.920]  gonna try to use a government shutdown as a way to hold us hostage to go along
[57:25.920 --> 57:29.080]  with it the expanding debt well there look they're not gonna shut the
[57:29.080 --> 57:32.240]  government down they're gonna make a lot of noise and at the end of the day
[57:32.240 --> 57:35.880]  they're gonna raise the debt ceiling yet again and they're gonna spend more
[57:35.880 --> 57:39.240]  money because they can do it and as long as the Chinese are lending to us and
[57:39.240 --> 57:42.720]  the Japanese and the Saudis we're gonna keep borrowing and along as Ben
[57:42.720 --> 57:46.680]  Bernanke is printing we're gonna keep spending and then until the whole thing
[57:46.680 --> 57:50.240]  falls off the edge of a cliff and nobody wants to acknowledge that what we need
[57:50.240 --> 57:56.400]  to do is raise interest rates tighten up on credit because nobody wants to go
[57:56.400 --> 57:59.320]  through the fact that well that's gonna bring down the stock market that's
[57:59.320 --> 58:03.160]  gonna that's gonna cause a housing prices to fall they have to fall housing
[58:03.160 --> 58:07.320]  prices are too high and the consequence of trying to artificially prop them up
[58:07.320 --> 58:12.200]  with cheap credit is that we destroy the currency and we and we inflict far
[58:12.200 --> 58:16.280]  greater damage and far greater losses across the country then if we simply
[58:16.280 --> 58:21.120]  let housing prices fall to their natural level well bottom line we're in a battle
[58:21.120 --> 58:25.400]  to get the truth out because if we don't the system's gonna use these crises to
[58:25.400 --> 58:29.120]  expand their model of vertical integration with the mega corporations
[58:29.120 --> 58:32.920]  teamed up with government Peter Schiff thank you so much for joining us look
[58:32.920 --> 58:36.360]  forward to speaking to you in the near future thanks for having me on you bet
[58:36.360 --> 58:41.800]  we'll be right back with the second hour congressman Ron Paul coming up
[58:41.800 --> 58:52.800]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network Alex told you the
[58:52.800 --> 58:56.680]  government announced recently that the recession is over it ended on June of
[58:56.680 --> 59:01.760]  2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a
[59:01.760 --> 59:05.080]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[59:05.080 --> 59:08.720]  of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news
[59:08.720 --> 59:12.960]  either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition to
[59:12.960 --> 59:16.520]  converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a
[59:16.520 --> 59:20.680]  food savings account from e-foods direct they both make fabulous investments

[59:49.280 --> 1:00:01.640]  5633 waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:01.640 --> 1:00:13.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:20.840]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:26.440]  Alex Jones we only got him for about 15 minutes maybe less because of votes
[1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:31.400]  coming up congressman Ron Paul needs no introduction globally now recognized as
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:37.560]  the true leader of the liberty movement against collectivism and corruption we
[1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:44.200]  got a host of questions for him sir gold is exploding silver is exploding right
[1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:49.320]  now the Federal Reserve is monetizing now 70% of the debt the dollar is
[1:00:49.320 --> 1:00:54.160]  plunging everything you've talked about is beginning to unfold OPEX talking
[1:00:54.160 --> 1:01:00.240]  about $200 a barrel oil is this the big event you've been talking about that
[1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:05.080]  we're beginning to see come into view well it's huge and it has started and
[1:01:05.080 --> 1:01:10.080]  whether it comes about and really is identified as the big event and
[1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:14.280]  everybody recognizes it within the next 30 days or so I'm not positive but I
[1:01:14.280 --> 1:01:17.920]  believe it is the beginning but it's been going on you know you and others have
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:22.240]  been talking about commodity prices going up but even green span today had
[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:26.280]  talking today we better keep an eye on this inflation you know but what he
[1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:30.000]  fails to see is so many others fail to see is inflation is when they print the
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.200]  money create the credit out of thin air and then the price increases come after
[1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:37.840]  which we've known there's been inflation now we're just looking for the bad
[1:01:37.840 --> 1:01:42.640]  result so yes this is big and then that's surging gold today is a is a big
[1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:46.480]  issue today I was talking to staff but I didn't say the price of gold was up I
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:50.200]  said well the dollar was just further devalued you know against gold which is
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:54.760]  the ultimate test devaluation it's not good for anybody but when you grill
[1:01:54.760 --> 1:01:59.320]  Bernanke monthly in the banking committee he almost sometimes does laugh
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:02.840]  when you talk about inflation he acts like it's no issue but the head of
[1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:07.640]  Walmart says that inflation is going to be very serious well I think it's
[1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:11.320]  further along than we realize have you you've probably seen the story about how
[1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:16.040]  the retail people are fooling the people for a while at least they try you
[1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:20.200]  know to make the bottles a little smaller and put 15 ounces in a bag instead
[1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:24.560]  of 16 ounces and you know just cutting corners but that is not the solution to
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:28.840]  inflation the solution to inflation is not having a federal reserve run by
[1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:33.760]  somebody like Bernanke shifting gears into the war Obama didn't even approach
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:39.040]  Congress for even a flimsy authorization of force I mean that's clearly
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:43.400]  impeachable but you've pointed out Bush did similar things but I mean shouldn't
[1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:46.720]  even even if Obama is a puppet congressman shouldn't we move for
[1:02:46.720 --> 1:02:51.120]  congressional hearings to talk about these new wars that are being launched
[1:02:51.120 --> 1:02:55.480]  well it would be nice but I think that we should have been doing this and
[1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:59.880]  demanding our that we meet our responsibilities in the Congress 20
[1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:04.200]  30 40 years ago you know every every day it's less than less you know I was
[1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:08.000]  thinking about this government closed down you know one of the downside of
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  this or at least it would come out of the truth let's say we closed the
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:16.640]  government down but and and and Congress no longer is functioning the
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:20.080]  government's not functioning so to speak but you know what government's going to
[1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:23.880]  continue to function do you think do you think the regulators aren't going to
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:26.640]  regulate do you think the feds not going to print money do you think they're not
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:31.720]  going to bail out people I mean a whole good but it would point out is that
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:36.680]  they Congress is truly irrelevant you know what we've known it's been irrelevant
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:41.720]  with the war issue but you know that that would be you know a mixed blessing it
[1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:47.040]  would point out to truth but it would also indicate that we're in bad shape
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:51.160]  because Congress doesn't have much to say about what's going on congressman
[1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:56.360]  does this not set the clearest precedent ever under globalism one world
[1:03:56.360 --> 1:04:00.080]  government even Fox News has made that point that the president then took
[1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:06.360]  orders from the UN in less than 48 hours launched the bombardment of Libya yeah
[1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:11.640]  and and they you know even Bush senior bragged about that remember he didn't
[1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:17.240]  want to go to Congress he came and got a token approval in 1990 and 91 you know
[1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:22.320]  for the Persian Gulf War but he says he got his orders from the UN he didn't
[1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:26.600]  need to go to Congress he eventually did but they and he even used the word that
[1:04:26.600 --> 1:04:30.840]  was the first time I heard a president use the word New World Order anybody
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:35.240]  that'll use that had to be a conspiracy not but their Bush was saying well this
[1:04:35.240 --> 1:04:38.840]  is what we need to do for the New World Order and they used that you know of
[1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:43.040]  course when they gave us the WTO other New World Order is marching on and the
[1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:48.000]  New World Order is certainly looking at this monetary crisis we want you know
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:53.240]  the Constitution we want sound money we want hot gold money and honest money at
[1:04:53.240 --> 1:04:56.880]  the same time the internationalists are planning you know for their
[1:04:56.880 --> 1:05:00.200]  international fiat car stay there let's come back with that congressman quick
[1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:02.360]  break we'll be right back with Ron Paul

[1:07:04.440 --> 1:07:08.800]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:12.960]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:17.000]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:20.880]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:07:20.880 --> 1:07:25.000]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:29.320]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:07:29.320 --> 1:07:33.640]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:37.360]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:41.560]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[1:07:41.560 --> 1:07:44.920]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:08.800]  radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for
[1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:14.960]  your mind all right we've only got ten minutes with him once the bell rings for
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:19.480]  the vote so we got congressman Ron Paul joining us obviously needs no
[1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:23.240]  introduction we were just talking to him a few minutes ago he just joined us we
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:28.000]  were raising this point of Obama becoming the first you sitting president to be
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:32.600]  sitting on the UN Security Council as the head of it violating article one
[1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:37.720]  section nine now not even getting a token authorization of force or
[1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:43.080]  resolution from Congress following you in orders to launch that attack in less
[1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:47.080]  than 48 hours we were talking about this really being the biggest move yet for
[1:08:47.080 --> 1:08:51.000]  the New World Order and then we were getting into congressman how we want
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:54.960]  more liberty we don't want dollar devaluation we want congress in control
[1:08:54.960 --> 1:08:59.040]  of currency and credit but instead the banksters you were mentioning they want
[1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:03.080]  something else they're openly calling now for a world government and IMF World
[1:09:03.080 --> 1:09:07.400]  Bank band core global currency can you speak to that place yes and I think the
[1:09:07.400 --> 1:09:12.760]  evidence is mounting about our concerns about the dollar you know crashing
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:17.400]  prices are going up they've been going up but I thought it was very important
[1:09:17.400 --> 1:09:23.520]  today that Bernanke you know in his sweet talk admitted that oh prices are
[1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:27.280]  going up we'll have to watch it very carefully in case we have to do something
[1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:30.360]  of course all the damage has been done over the last three years because they
[1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:34.320]  doubled and tripled the money supply and that's where the problem is but they
[1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:40.080]  know what we know what we talk about they know that the dollars that the
[1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:44.960]  days are limited and we plan and hope that we can restore constitutional money
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:49.400]  and hard money and sell an economic policy at the same time the crisis that's
[1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:53.880]  coming there was new world orders that the world people they see it as an
[1:09:53.880 --> 1:09:59.440]  opportunity to move one step forward they go to war and they go to war under
[1:09:59.440 --> 1:10:04.240]  NATO and United Nations not by the Congress but they want also because
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:09.240]  ultimately the big one is control the money so they they are making
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:15.440]  their plans to have a worldwide be at currency the IMF World Bank operations
[1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:20.200]  but they they have a long way to go because that's still that still is
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:25.320]  fake money it's be at money and they have to defy the marketplace I mean they
[1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:28.440]  may make the attempt and they may be able to cause a lot of harm in the
[1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:34.440]  meantime but ultimately sound money wins out just hopefully we do our job and
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:42.200]  liberty wins out over the tyrant congressman looking at what's happening
[1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:48.000]  around the world and the French basically invading Ivory Coast these moves
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:53.320]  into Libya with the special forces advisors there I mean I've even seen
[1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:56.840]  statements out of NATO and others that this is a great day for globalism a
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:11:05.640]  great day for world governance that now the UN if rebels in any country rebel
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:10.640]  the UN can pick and choose and decide whether to have a resolution to
[1:11:10.640 --> 1:11:15.880]  basically back the rebels and and bomb them and that's really a flimsy face in
[1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:22.320]  my view over neocolonialism yeah it's just a change and it's not going to
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:26.240]  work for them no matter how how hard they try and how many temporary military
[1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:30.720]  victories they have it's going to be a failed system I think Obama has the
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:37.680]  worst worth policy conceivable first he goes in on his own under UN and then he
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:41.640]  uses our force to intimidate him and then he says oh the American people must
[1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:46.160]  not like this so I'm going to back off there's no way that we won't be blamed
[1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:49.440]  for everybody getting killed over there because it'll be our weapons and our
[1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:53.640]  money and if they need us we're going to go back in and already they do have our
[1:11:53.640 --> 1:11:57.960]  CIA agents in there and we can't pick the guy that lived over here for 20 years
[1:11:57.960 --> 1:12:03.160]  we've sent them over but it's messier than that they can't earn this out they
[1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:06.520]  they think they've ironed it out in Iraq and Afghanistan and they're no
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:11.400]  we're close to it even in Iraq I think that's a you know a terrible mess but
[1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:17.040]  here we are over assisting the rebels in in Libya and and already it's well
[1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:22.920]  known to Al Qaeda has infiltrated the rebels in Libya so they're doomed to
[1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:28.120]  fail and the bankruptcy will bring us to our knees this just hope we can put it
[1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:31.240]  back together in a lot better shape than we have it now well as you know
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:34.800]  congressman and because you've cited his work quite a bit Michael Scheuer the
[1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:38.760]  former head of the bin Laden program at the CIA chief analyst just two days ago
[1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:43.960]  on CNN he said look you guys are putting out pure theater so is Hillary so is
[1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:49.200]  Obama this is absolute garbage there is Al Qaeda Al Qaeda is the core of this
[1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:54.200]  group and it turns out that even the guy trained in Virginia admits that he sent
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:59.480]  troops previously to Iraq to kill our soldiers so we're told we got to be in
[1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:03.840]  Pakistan looking for a hundred Al Qaeda total in Afghanistan and Pakistan but
[1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:07.920]  then you have thousands of admitted Al Qaeda in the Maghreb there in North
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:14.400]  Africa and they're now our allies this is beyond 1984 it's total insanity and
[1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:18.120]  the one thing we know it will fail but how many people are going to suffer in
[1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:24.480]  the meantime but it will serve its purpose in many ways by bringing us
[1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:29.640]  to our knees and some of them you know like the opportunity they don't let
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:32.280]  emergencies go to waste they take advantage of it and that's why they
[1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:36.480]  think they can advance the new world order and one world government under
[1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:42.280]  these conditions but you know I think communications these days are such that
[1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:47.320]  our message is spreading and I hope we're going to be very good competitors
[1:13:47.320 --> 1:13:50.760]  with the warm worlders well that's my next point we were talking during the
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:54.920]  break about how Fox even admits to you well we have you on because the
[1:13:54.920 --> 1:14:00.040]  listenership viewership goes up there's still a free market of ideas and cast
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:03.720]  Sunstein and others and now we've seen Senator Graham with the foolish
[1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:08.120]  Koran burning saying maybe we should restrict free speech on face the nation
[1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:11.480]  we're seeing Jay Rockefeller saying we would have been better off without
[1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:16.760]  having an internet we see real moves and real announcements for fairness doctrine
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:21.000]  with this perfect storm of dinosaur media that's carrying water for the
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:25.280]  insiders losing credibility government losing credibility and so more and more
[1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:30.280]  of a incentive to try to shut down our voices but the genies out of the bottle
[1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:35.240]  what's your view on that I think we always have to be vigilant and I think
[1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:39.680]  they are going to try very hard I think if you look at the educational system
[1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:44.360]  you know the real competition in education is homeschooling and private
[1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:48.160]  schooling and you know the government doesn't like that they don't like this
[1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:52.280]  competition but so far more and more people are joining it I think you're
[1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:55.160]  gonna have a hard time closing us all down I think they're gonna have a hard
[1:14:55.160 --> 1:14:58.960]  time taking our guns I think they're gonna have a hard time taking the gold
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:04.280]  away from us like they did in the 30s I just don't think that's gonna happen I
[1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:09.720]  think our side is growing and it's alive and well and more determination some
[1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:13.320]  people probably are further along in their pessimism about what we can
[1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:19.800]  salvage than I am but I remain in many ways optimistic that much good can come
[1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:26.000]  of this and so no matter how hard they try to suppress us I think it's gonna be
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.120]  impossible to do it well you're right and that's what you've written about and
[1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:33.920]  spoken about for decades if we individually live a philosophy of
[1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:38.160]  liberty it's going to outshine everything around us our neighbors local
[1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:41.600]  government federal government and people are gonna see that success and that
[1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:45.880]  track record of being accurate for 30 years you've talked about inflation
[1:15:45.880 --> 1:15:50.520]  tax devaluation the campaign three years ago some tried to laugh at you but
[1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:55.040]  now I see editorials and major papers everywhere saying Ron Paul won't get the
[1:15:55.040 --> 1:16:00.120]  snub this time and that leads me to 2012 obviously even if you didn't get the
[1:16:00.120 --> 1:16:04.040]  nomination you would it would be a great educational victory to have you in
[1:16:04.040 --> 1:16:07.520]  those debates when are we gonna be hearing an announcement congressman on
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:12.840]  whether you're going to run for president or not but can't be too far off I
[1:16:12.840 --> 1:16:15.960]  would think in a month or so I'm gonna have to make a final decision matter
[1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:20.360]  of fact I may have to make a token decision on on one debate they're
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:27.840]  inviting potential candidates to go to South Carolina in May and I'm pretty
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:33.440]  close to saying that I will come without a commitment to what what I'm going to
[1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:37.800]  do in filing legal papers that we were getting awfully close and they're just a
[1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:41.960]  few other things that I have to iron out personally to make my final decision
[1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:48.800]  but it has to come you just but but none of the other major candidates have made
[1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:53.440]  that official announcement I'm not quite sure Obama that's all Obama yeah
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:57.800]  Obama he's the one that got out in front of everybody else I guess there aren't
[1:16:57.800 --> 1:17:01.280]  going to be any other candidates maybe other Republicans are intimidated maybe
[1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:05.840]  I think they can't beat him now that he's a popular war president well you know
[1:17:05.840 --> 1:17:09.520]  sir you're gonna win in the intellectual battle I mean the you know the
[1:17:09.520 --> 1:17:14.600]  great educational engagement you did three years ago I would guess is gonna
[1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:18.160]  be dwarfed I'm a little worried about your safety I think everybody should
[1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:22.720]  pray for you also financially support you I mean obviously I hope you're gonna
[1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:27.520]  have some really good bodyguards because I believe you've got a chance to
[1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:30.760]  actually win sir and then you're gonna have to publicly come out when they try
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:34.440]  to steal the nomination from you like they threatened Reagan with we didn't
[1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:39.280]  put George Herbert Walker Bush on I mean do you have any concerns about your
[1:17:39.280 --> 1:17:44.600]  safety well yeah when I get in a car and when I get in airplanes I mean just
[1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:51.240]  normal life provides dangers to us I never people urge me to be cautious in
[1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:57.160]  the last campaign and and I didn't change things a whole lot you know you can go
[1:17:57.160 --> 1:18:01.600]  through life being intimidated but I think you know being a little more
[1:18:01.600 --> 1:18:06.360]  cautious as wise but I don't I don't peek around every corner
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:10.600]  certainly you're bold and have a lot of courage my point is clearly the global
[1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:13.760]  banking establishment if you really looks like you're gonna become president
[1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:20.520]  which is now in the realm of serious reality I mean certainly these people
[1:18:20.520 --> 1:18:24.400]  are known for bombing countries that don't have central banks they run yeah
[1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:29.240]  you see where they set up a central bank with the list with the radicals in with
[1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:33.320]  the rebels in Libya first thing they did oh we got a couple rebels out here we
[1:18:33.320 --> 1:18:38.440]  need a central bank that isn't insane well we're almost out of time with you
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:41.400]  congressman I've got a few other questions for you we have about three
[1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:44.640]  minutes I think we can do them okay great so they have rung the bell now
[1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:49.040]  yeah congressman Jesse Ventura was on here yesterday former governor
[1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:52.240]  obviously I'm sure you've heard his announcement that if you leave the
[1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:56.800]  Republican Party he'd be happy to be your VP running mate if you run for
[1:18:56.800 --> 1:19:01.280]  president well is it gonna be as a Republican as of now that's mainly what
[1:19:01.280 --> 1:19:05.920]  I've been thinking of but I guess in life you should always keep all options
[1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:11.400]  open but right now I'm still a Republican congressman and we did it last time as
[1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:16.680]  a Republican and you know there's a lot of people who get mixed messages from
[1:19:16.680 --> 1:19:22.000]  that because Republicans don't always stand for Liberty as you know it's a
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:28.520]  whole lot but I parties are somewhat irrelevant to me you know whether I'm
[1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:33.320]  an independent Republican or libertarian I think there are vehicles for
[1:19:33.320 --> 1:19:37.280]  delivering a message so right now I am working within a Republican Party
[1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:42.320]  congressman looking at the TSA are there plans on congressional hearings
[1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:46.480]  multiple states are moving to try to bar the TSA sticking their hands down
[1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:52.120]  people's pants baking people and radiation microwaves what are you doing
[1:19:52.120 --> 1:19:57.480]  to try to us reverse that well one thing is I feed a lot of information to
[1:19:57.480 --> 1:20:02.680]  Jason Jason Chavitt who's the chairman of that subcommittee and he is hot on
[1:20:02.680 --> 1:20:07.360]  that issue it's very good congressman and he is outraged over it as we all
[1:20:07.360 --> 1:20:12.680]  should be and I think if people have examples the bad examples of that
[1:20:12.680 --> 1:20:16.840]  always helps you know visuals and pictures or anything if they can either
[1:20:16.840 --> 1:20:21.000]  send it to him directly or to me I think we can make use of that as a weapon
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:25.160]  because there will be hearings on this all right in closing building up towards
[1:20:25.160 --> 1:20:28.320]  an announcement to run for president my gut tells me you're gonna do it sir as
[1:20:28.320 --> 1:20:31.680]  you understand it's it's it's it's just too important to get the word out what
[1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:36.520]  can listeners and Liberty supporters do to start getting their engines warmed up
[1:20:36.520 --> 1:20:41.280]  to give you the maximum support out of the gates when and if you make this
[1:20:41.280 --> 1:20:46.280]  announcement well you know in a couple weeks I think it's April 19th I have
[1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:50.960]  another little book coming out that that might be a time for an explosion of
[1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:56.360]  interest and the book does not make money for me it goes into my foundation so
[1:20:56.360 --> 1:21:02.120]  but it's a message it's a book talking about 50 issues dealing with and it's
[1:21:02.120 --> 1:21:07.360]  called Liberty define and coincide in that with an announcement could be
[1:21:07.360 --> 1:21:11.840]  interesting even though those plans have not been made to do such but it's
[1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:15.480]  something that people could be looking at well the day you announce we're gonna
[1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:20.560]  try to set up a money bomb so we will poke you focus people over towards the
[1:21:20.560 --> 1:21:25.880]  what campaign for liberty when that happens well I have to think about that
[1:21:25.880 --> 1:21:28.960]  it might have to be a political side campaign for liberty is not political so
[1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:34.120]  you can't do but you can do something that would be the congressional coffers
[1:21:34.120 --> 1:21:37.360]  then well sir thank you so much for spending time with us go to your vote and

[1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:22.520]  because I've seen the full interview actually listen to it my car drive at
[1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:29.120]  home last night at about 10 on XM Jesse just savage Dean with info after but
[1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:33.040]  they cut it off to make it look like Ventura was speechless so I want to go
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:37.720]  over some of the real evidence of 9-11 being an inside job but before we do
[1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:42.840]  that I just want to go back to Ron Paul live interview that we just did think
[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:48.080]  about him in Congress 16 years ago not getting one co-sponsor to audit the Fed
[1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:51.960]  last year they passed it in the house the Senate defeated it procedurally and
[1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:56.400]  gutted it think about Ron Paul being laughed at for talking about dollar
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:00.760]  devaluation three years ago now he's not being laughed at he is ubiquitous
[1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:07.280]  across TV radio and everybody I talked to even liberals like what he has to say
[1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:11.880]  and conservatives loving he really could become president but the media even
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:15.120]  when he won the straw poll two years in a row would then talk about every other
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:19.200]  candidate but him in newscast they talk about second third fourth place but not
[1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:24.760]  tell you who won the Kentucky Derby of Republican straw polls with the real
[1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:28.640]  Republican leadership they're giving him standing ovations instead they go over
[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:32.120]  with a microphone to one small crowd and staged event and have them boo and then
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:35.440]  put that on the news they couldn't pull it off this year so they played old
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:42.880]  video from 2000 and what was it 2009 the year before so they know what they're
[1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:46.880]  doing they're engaging in deception and they're gonna push this idea that Ron
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:50.320]  Paul can't win now listen we got to go with the ninth and tenth amendment we
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:53.720]  got to take our states back our school boards our city councils our county
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:58.000]  commissioners our town councils that's where you come in that's where I come
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:02.200]  in all of us together who are on the same team wanting freedom for our children
[1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:06.240]  and ourselves in our future but the war is now the fight for freedoms here
[1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:09.320]  everything we've talked about is now unfolding the world government's openly
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:13.160]  being announced as the solution so people that still try to laugh about
[1:26:13.160 --> 1:26:17.760]  world government they're idiots just move on okay they're not living in
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:26.480]  reality they basically are engaged in delusions they want to be kind cognitive
[1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:32.920]  dissidents they're in there they're in their little comfort bubble and they
[1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:38.760]  have this normalcy prejudice where I heard Glenn Beck talking about something
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:42.360]  today that I actually talk about a lot myself and it's true about how people
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:45.960]  on board the Titanic just said we're going back to our rooms there's no way
[1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:49.520]  the ship's gonna sink or people on 9-11 going back to turn their computer off
[1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:53.920]  while the towers were burning or going to you know turn the lights off and
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:57.600]  they're never getting out they just can't believe something bad's happening
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:06.000]  so they live in total denial it's time to get out of that denial it's time to
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:12.040]  really historically and geopolitically get informed and if you're not informed
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:15.760]  about this you're a new listener you're smart you know all about baseball scores
[1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:19.880]  are all about your favorite TV shows stop being experts in that become
[1:27:19.880 --> 1:27:25.720]  experts in reality live in reality be involved and and understand that we're
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:30.360]  in a fight for our lives right now the globalists have never been weaker but
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:33.600]  they've never been stronger they're rolling forward with their programs and
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:37.720]  they're weak if we simply point out the crimes they've committed and the
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:43.480]  different things that they've done it's that simple our credibility is rising
[1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:49.280]  their credibility is dropping they know that they're scared they're concerned
[1:27:49.280 --> 1:27:53.760]  they're gonna try to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat we've got to get in
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:57.400]  there and it doesn't mean you've got to save the world by yourself but spreading
[1:27:57.400 --> 1:28:01.080]  the word about Ron Paul spreading the word about our free podcast or the local
[1:28:01.080 --> 1:28:04.560]  AM and FM stations you're listening to spreading the word about my books my
[1:28:04.560 --> 1:28:09.240]  videos the videos that are online prisonplanet.tv pick the talk show
[1:28:09.240 --> 1:28:14.880]  host the authors the statesmen like Ron Paul who have a track record of accurate
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:19.720]  info and who are winners in the fight for liberty and understand that Rome
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:22.520]  wasn't built in the day we're not going to defeat the New World Order in a day
[1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:27.400]  it is a process of having the moral high ground having the information and
[1:28:27.400 --> 1:28:33.520]  taking action and realizing that it's your destiny to make a choice it's your
[1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:37.160]  it's your destiny that you have free will and to decide if you're going to
[1:28:37.160 --> 1:28:43.280]  step up to the plate and be part of the solution and be on the field in this
[1:28:43.280 --> 1:28:47.840]  historical fight against the collectivist against the mega rich that
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:52.360]  that use big government to consolidate wealth and domesticate the population as
[1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:56.960]  we go into this depression the hordes of people on government payrolls or
[1:28:56.960 --> 1:29:01.200]  government contracts or welfare and that's the defense contractor people and
[1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:06.680]  the welfare queens all of them the teachers the banksters they don't see
[1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:10.040]  it as a choice this is their livelihood their pensions have already been stolen
[1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:15.600]  and the globalist are gonna sick them on what's left of America blaming liberty
[1:29:15.600 --> 1:29:19.400]  and freedom for what's happened when it's the opposite no one can deny we're
[1:29:19.400 --> 1:29:25.600]  losing freedom no one can deny the fruits of this tyranny are extremely
[1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:29.840]  painful and destructive and so now is the time to shout from the rooftops the
[1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:33.640]  church tops the mountain tops the hilltops now is the time to start your
[1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:38.000]  own audio blog your own YouTube channel now is the time to spread the word now

[1:29:45.960 --> 1:29:49.880]  accelerate it and intensify it and redouble our efforts we'll be right
[1:29:49.880 --> 1:29:58.280]  back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:08.640]  that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than
[1:31:08.640 --> 1:31:12.560]  50 years he says it will change everything about our lives the way you

[1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:16.280]  I can answer perhaps for my brother who's a British Army colonel and when I
[1:33:16.280 --> 1:33:20.400]  discussed WikiLeaks with him he says that the impact of releasing private
[1:33:20.400 --> 1:33:25.280]  memos private reports from the military when they're in operations is
[1:33:25.280 --> 1:33:29.640]  incredibly dangerous all right go to my book I believe you sure it I agree with
[1:33:29.640 --> 1:33:36.480]  that I agree with that but go to my book and see currently our government every
[1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:44.960]  year declares 16 million things top secret 16 million I would say that's
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:50.480]  about everything so what do we get to know about my point my point is when
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:56.600]  they're abusing what's secret by classifying everything they do the
[1:33:56.600 --> 1:34:01.960]  public can't see read what read in the back of the book what some of the great
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:05.440]  founders of this country said about secretive government did you believe it
[1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:09.220]  was in the public interest that WikiLeaks reveal for example that Colonel
[1:34:09.220 --> 1:34:14.840]  Gaddafi had four mistresses I could care less how many women Colonel Gaddafi
[1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:19.160]  has is it in the public interest to reveal that information I don't know
[1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:23.560]  it's gossip doesn't bother me when you were governor you hated that kind of
[1:34:23.560 --> 1:34:27.200]  gossip against you and your family in fact you detested the media that spread
[1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:30.800]  any kind of gossip they didn't spend gossip about my family did about your
[1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:35.280]  son right oh yeah well they trumped up charges but what I'm saying is that
[1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:40.840]  kind of family gossip private life stuff isn't that where the line should be
[1:34:40.840 --> 1:34:44.040]  drawn with WikiLeaks why do you support everything they put out they give them
[1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:48.320]  then you were so vocal about okay any private material coming out of here then
[1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:54.120]  then why is it okay for our our our why is it okay for them to expose my private
[1:34:54.120 --> 1:34:57.280]  stuff I'm not saying it is but that's saying if you felt strongly that your
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:02.400]  private life is your private life however much you think badly you have to
[1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:07.760]  write about it why is good this is a classic what you're at here is a classic
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:12.360]  example of killing the messenger not the message if it wasn't written in the
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:17.520]  first place there'd be no message word there so somebody wrote it to begin with
[1:35:17.520 --> 1:35:22.640]  shouldn't they be the ones who have put America in danger it was the ones who
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:26.800]  wrote it no because the whole point of being a diplomat is it when you report
[1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:30.080]  to your government around the world anyway wait let me finish we're in sad
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:35.520]  when diplomats have to sit and lie when they have to write things that people
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:39.480]  aren't allowed to read and if they do read they take offense to well I would
[1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:43.440]  say that's part of the big problems of the world with the lies in wiki leaks I
[1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:48.200]  don't know he just said they were lying I didn't say they were lying you said
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:51.360]  you said to the sad day when diplomats live where were they I'm saying when
[1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:57.480]  they're saying bad things about other people they wrote it all it was was
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:02.360]  exposed my point was that made there may not be so in other words here's you
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:08.120]  figure let government keep everything secret it's all okay it's all yeah it's
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:12.320]  okay because somebody in government is deemed this I don't see it but so
[1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:18.520]  therefore hands off I don't because we don't dare know okay that's the clip
[1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:24.600]  about secrecy there's another clip up on CNN where where he says well you've got
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:29.720]  a conspiracy theory that the government was involved in 9-11 and he says did
[1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:34.480]  George Bush blow up the towers did George Bush know and he says no but Dick
[1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:40.280]  Cheney had knowledge of it and of course Ventura's book has the stand down
[1:36:40.280 --> 1:36:44.400]  orders signed in June 1st where they took the shoot down power for the first
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:48.560]  time in modern history away from the military it was their default to shoot
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:54.400]  down aircraft and they just told him hey that's the way it is and then days
[1:36:54.400 --> 1:36:59.000]  after 9-11 they gave the power back and then Corbin on the CNN clip they put on
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:04.640]  the web cuts it off there and Ventura can never respond but Ventura went on to
[1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:08.840]  talk about how Norman Panetta was in the bunker and watch Cheney saying the
[1:37:08.840 --> 1:37:13.080]  order still stands to basically not shoot down the aircraft and Ventura went
[1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:19.600]  over and it's in his book he also in fact I'm trying to find it right now he
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:25.760]  also went over the order itself that we have a copy of months before saying to
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:33.480]  the military you can't shoot down aircraft now before they had that default
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:38.880]  position if one was hijacked or going to be flown into a building they said you
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:41.640]  know that you have the default to do that just like with Payne Stewart they
[1:37:41.640 --> 1:37:45.800]  had the authorization already set to do it if need be but they tied their hands
[1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:51.480]  in fact let me just get the actual page of this it's page 216 in his new book
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:38:01.120]  by the way that's available at info wars.com page 216 and I'll show folks a
[1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:06.040]  document cam shot of that chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff instruction
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:13.200]  aircraft piracy hijacking and destruction of derelict airborne objects and in the
[1:38:13.200 --> 1:38:19.360]  cancellation of the document that was in place and then reauthorized in 97 but
[1:38:19.360 --> 1:38:30.000]  in place and when Nora was set up in 1957 it goes on to cancel CJ CSI 3610.01
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:34.960]  that authorized and have the default position for the Pentagon under norad
[1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:41.680]  control to shoot down any aircraft that were planned to be used as weapons or
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:45.880]  that were derelict and going to be crashing into population centers that's
[1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:50.080]  why they followed Payne Stewart's plane just a few months before 9-11 and
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:55.600]  followed it for a long period of time with their aim 9 sidewinder missiles
[1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:59.040]  ready but when it went into it was going into a rural area in a cornfield
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:02.520]  they made the decision not to shoot it down they didn't need to get a Dick
[1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:07.880]  Cheney authorization but on that morning Dick Cheney was there in control not
[1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:12.400]  just signing this order June 1st and giving it to Rumsfeld months before 9-11
[1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:17.000]  but he was there that morning in control in the bunker to make sure and to say
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:22.680]  no the order still stands but let's go ahead now and play that Ventura 9-11
[1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:30.440]  club here it is let's move to 9-11 your theory of 9-11 is what my theory of 9-11
[1:39:30.440 --> 1:39:35.440]  is that we certainly at best we knew it was gonna happen they allowed it to
[1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:39.320]  happen to further their agenda in the Middle East and go to these warrants
[1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:44.200]  just to clarify President George Bush knew that 9-11 was gonna happen that
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:48.160]  3000 people were gonna get murdered they had all the information if you looked
[1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:52.880]  at the MSA documents if you look well put it to you this way
[1:39:52.880 --> 1:39:59.600]  the August 6th memo was pretty clear but are you do you genuinely believe
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:05.520]  Jesse Ventura that President George W. Bush knew 9-11 was gonna know why do
[1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:09.760]  you say that no what do you say but I believe Dick Cheney knew it really
[1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:13.680]  yep you believe he knew it was going to happen I believe they had a good well
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:18.240]  why did John Ashcroft quit flying commercial planes that summer and
[1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:24.240]  switch only to private planes why did that happen you don't honestly believe
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:28.160]  these people I don't believe you believe that you don't honestly think Dick Cheney
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:33.880]  knew it was going to happen you can't do you really believe it's not irrational
[1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:40.720]  excuse me do you really believe that evil people can't be in charge of
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:45.040]  governments if you do go talk to the Germans they know a little about that
[1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:51.520]  that evil people can get in charge the governments are run by people
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:56.920]  government people can be bad so Dick Cheney is involved Ashcroft's involved
[1:40:56.920 --> 1:41:04.640]  all these people got together and plans now to come on madness oh that's madness
[1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:13.280]  but you'll fully accept that 19 Islamic radicals armed with box cutters taking
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:18.440]  orders from a guy in a cave in Afghanistan could defeat our multi
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:23.280]  billion-dollar air defense system yes yes the Russians couldn't do Jesse that's
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:27.240]  exactly what happened it's exactly what happened really unfortunately they exposed
[1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:32.000]  a massive flaw in homeland security what was it the floor was that these guys
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:36.800]  have been training and often aiming to go one way aiming to land planes in a
[1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:40.200]  certain manner but not even land them wanted to take off but not land all
[1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:45.400]  these were clues that this was a weird set of circumstances I'm afraid that's
[1:41:45.400 --> 1:41:48.960]  exactly what happened the trouble being a conspiracy theorist I've got great
[1:41:48.960 --> 1:41:52.280]  respect for you and your books very readable the problem is once you start
[1:41:52.280 --> 1:41:55.760]  buying into these theories you never stop and with the internet these days
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:42:01.000]  there's a theory about everything so they don't let Ventura respond there they
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:08.600]  just let Pierce Corbin have the final word ladies and gentlemen FBI agents in
[1:42:08.600 --> 1:42:14.920]  Phoenix in Florida in Minneapolis St. Paul Minnesota in San Diego all said
[1:42:14.920 --> 1:42:19.000]  these guys are wanting to basically hijack planes and fly them in the World
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  Trade Center that was in a memo and the FBI agents were then reprimanded for
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:29.920]  continuing their investigations now who were the hijackers well I have Newsweek
[1:42:29.920 --> 1:42:33.760]  I have Associated Press confirming I have the Dean of the Defense Language
[1:42:33.760 --> 1:42:38.760]  School the Colonel came out and said these guys trained at my school these
[1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:42.880]  guys were government agents I don't know exactly what happened but they were
[1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:48.920]  trained at military bases and they were trained at my school see that's what
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:53.080]  Ventura has in his book he's got the stand-down orders he's got things like
[1:42:53.080 --> 1:42:57.920]  Northwoods and Tonkin where they staged events or talked about staging events
[1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:01.680]  it's in an army field manual that WikiLeaks put out four years ago that
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:04.920]  the Pentagon admits is real they want to prosecute whoever released it where they
[1:43:04.920 --> 1:43:09.360]  teach army captains in black ops how to stage terror I mean it's been
[1:43:09.360 --> 1:43:13.240]  declassified in Vietnam that our military early on when they were
[1:43:13.240 --> 1:43:19.640]  advisors in 60 61 2 3 the CIA would stage terror attacks Graham Greene in the
[1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:23.040]  quiet American put it in a fictional account in his book but that's a true
[1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:31.840]  story that's how they get this stuff out past the censors they do this a
[1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:36.040]  Hitler did it the Russians do it the Zars did it before the Communist this
[1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:40.960]  is the oldest trick in the book Nero didn't like the Christians he burned part
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:47.080]  of Rome and blamed it on them and then rounded them up and killed them it's a
[1:43:47.080 --> 1:43:51.960]  frame up you ever heard of a frame up it's like somebody let's say somebody
[1:43:51.960 --> 1:43:55.640]  you know this happens in business all the time doesn't like you in your office
[1:43:55.640 --> 1:44:04.400]  show they put marijuana in your cabinet in your fall cabinet and then tattle on
[1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:10.320]  you I mean you don't understand I mean it's been declassified actually leaked
[1:44:10.320 --> 1:44:13.360]  and they admitted it was accurate the White House memo the Downing Street
[1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:20.040]  memos 2002 George W. Bush in meetings with Tony Blair saying look we're already
[1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:23.800]  going in we got to fix the intelligence I don't care if there's not WMD's we've
[1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:29.000]  got a lie and they lied about WMD's and that he was gonna try to nuke England
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:33.840]  and could nuke England within 45 minutes and they lied about anthrax and said it
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:37.360]  was made in a bathtub somewhere turned out it was the most weaponized U.S.
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:41.560]  anthrax so weaponized it wasn't even known to exist and part of a secret
[1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:46.760]  Fort Detrick program then they tried to frame four Patsy's the fourth Patsy
[1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:50.000]  wouldn't play along so they took him and drugged him and killed him and it was a
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:54.480]  minor footnote that the last guy who they wouldn't even give a trial killed
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:59.840]  himself in a mental institution with over-the-counter Tylenol and then Dr.
[1:44:59.840 --> 1:45:04.080]  David Kelly the head of the British inspectors comes out tells his friends
[1:45:04.080 --> 1:45:07.200]  they've told me they're gonna kill me and put me in the woods if I don't shut
[1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:12.320]  up a week later he's found dead the police come up and four men in black
[1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:16.640]  uniforms run away from the dead body this is in the British news and his
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:21.400]  wrist or slit with no blood and they say he died from that with no blood there
[1:45:21.400 --> 1:45:26.680]  and all these top doctors that have who examined him said no he was killed no
[1:45:26.680 --> 1:45:32.120]  blood and he had two undissolved pills in his stomach that they'd crammed down
[1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:36.240]  his throat after they'd killed him I mean ladies and gentlemen that he said
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:42.000]  they're going to kill me and people still say oh no he wasn't killed and it's
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:46.480]  taken six seven years now for over 80% of the brits to believe he was murdered
[1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:53.080]  Diana a month before she was killed gave a videotape to her butler this is in the
[1:45:53.080 --> 1:45:57.160]  British news saying Charles told me he's going to kill me in a fake auto
[1:45:57.160 --> 1:46:03.720]  accident month later she's dead in a fake auto accident they keep her there
[1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:07.040]  she wasn't dead in the accent for 45 minutes while they attended to her and
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:11.640]  then drove slowly to the hospital and she was dead on arrival then she didn't
[1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:15.720]  just trust her butler she gave to friends written letters saying Charles
[1:46:15.720 --> 1:46:20.120]  said he's gonna kill me this would be like if I got on air and said this
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:23.720]  person says they're gonna kill me this way and then I'm killed that way people
[1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:30.560]  say oh no he he died in an automobile accident that's how dumb they think you
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:35.520]  are and I mean to go over the evidence at 9-11 we cover it my film martial law
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:42.160]  9-1-1 martial martial law 9-1-1 rise the police state we cover it in my film
[1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:47.920]  terror storm history government sponsored terror we cover it at nauseam in
[1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:52.800]  road to tyranny all these films we break it down but but not just 9-11 all
[1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:55.960]  these other events and we told you the Patriot Act would be used against
[1:46:55.960 --> 1:47:00.840]  citizens we told you and now it is we told you TSA would start being on the
[1:47:00.840 --> 1:47:05.200]  streets now they are because they told us they would do all of this and Ventura
[1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:08.280]  has a lot of courage I don't agree with everything I don't agree with the
[1:47:08.280 --> 1:47:12.080]  arguments I've had with him in private that well I haven't seen God and why
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:18.280]  would God let all these bad things happen and and so but but but I know
[1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:23.160]  he's a real guy who really is bonafide I mean I know in person I spent a lot of
[1:47:23.160 --> 1:47:26.760]  private time with him he's real and that's got to be admired it takes a
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:31.080]  lot of courage for him to get up and say yeah Dick Cheney was involved now
[1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:34.120]  Corbin never let him get into his evidence but it's all covered in the
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:37.640]  book Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell 63 documents government doesn't want you
[1:47:37.640 --> 1:47:41.480]  read available at info wars.com we've got combo deals with this book where you

[1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:49.160]  wars.com along with big brother they're willing a nightmare come true with Mark
[1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:53.760]  Dyson his great work and police support alternative media now we've got coming
[1:47:53.760 --> 1:47:58.280]  up in the last 30 minutes the next hour the Liberty Dollarhead Bernard von
[1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:03.000]  Nahaus who I've interviewed many years he's now been convicted of creating a
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:06.920]  counterfeit currency though he publicly said this is silver I think we should
[1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:13.800]  start bartering in it the Federal Reserve note is a fraud and bad so that'd be
[1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:17.600]  like if you opened a hamburger place called Bob's and somebody else had a
[1:48:17.600 --> 1:48:25.120]  hamburger place called called David's and you advertise that your burgers were
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:29.360]  bigger and juicier than David's and then David went after you for copyright
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:34.120]  infringement saying the name Bob is David. I mean you know the whole point is
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:40.160]  the entire move by the Liberty Dollar were 15 years was to say the dollars
[1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:45.080]  being devalued get into silver and gold and you've got countless mints you've
[1:48:45.080 --> 1:48:49.080]  got state governments getting ready to issue their own silver and gold and and
[1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:53.400]  you're allowed to do that you're allowed to engage in barter but this is a big
[1:48:53.400 --> 1:48:56.840]  court case and they said in the court case I have the AP that he was a terrorist
[1:48:56.840 --> 1:49:00.480]  and the Southern Prairie Law Center ran out and said yes he's a terrorist he's
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:05.000]  horrible he's bad he deserves it so that's now terrorism and you heard
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:09.440]  Peter Schiff in the first hour saying this is a move against alternative real
[1:49:09.440 --> 1:49:13.880]  silver and gold back currencies because the dollars plunging today oil has had
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:19.360]  it's super spike that is now intensifying gold skyrocketed silver
[1:49:19.360 --> 1:49:22.760]  skyrocketed to give us the numbers as we go to break Ted where is silver and
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:27.560]  gold right now well hang on a second let me just refresh here real quick okay
[1:49:27.560 --> 1:49:32.960]  silver hit a high today of 3925 gold hit a high of 1455 silver currently right
[1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:41.920]  now third 3914 gold is at 1451 50 so very strong I mean for Ben Bernanke to
[1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:45.920]  come out and say there's no inflation except for in commodities which I mean
[1:49:45.920 --> 1:49:50.320]  what else do people need we need our food we need our shelter clothing I mean
[1:49:50.320 --> 1:49:55.440]  it's just absolutely asinine what he's coming up with here to say that we don't
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:50:00.000]  have problems I mean obviously there's big problems I mean Portugal is going so
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:04.160]  far down the way that at the insurance to to cover Portugal now they're saying
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:09.120]  Spain's going down and again what's the answer give the bankers trillions of
[1:50:09.120 --> 1:50:13.000]  European and American tax money that's what Bernanke for years fought was that
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:17.320]  most of our trillions of dollars of taxpayer money went to Europe and then
[1:50:17.320 --> 1:50:21.960]  private corporations like MSNBC at the time owned by General Electric and the
[1:50:21.960 --> 1:50:25.000]  head of General Electric now as the head of the Economic Council getting
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  waivers for all his coal plants and shutting down his competition and
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:33.800]  Obama's people get waivers on not having to buy insurance so that'll shut down
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:38.680]  their competition I mean this is total lawless criminality and now they're
[1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:42.120]  saying hey we might want to go after people that have gold and silver well
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:44.960]  you know what great you don't just give into that fear you know you get the
[1:50:44.960 --> 1:50:48.520]  gold and silver because they're they're starting to creep towards going after it
[1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:51.400]  you heard Ron Paul earlier in the hour he said they're not gonna get our gold
[1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:55.800]  and silver let me tell a story my mom's grandfather owned a car dealership in
[1:50:55.800 --> 1:51:01.280]  Dallas he didn't turn his gold in we'll be right he told Roosevelt take a hike

[2:01:00.400 --> 2:01:04.080]  even idiots just totally uninformed who thought that it was counterfeit to issue
[2:01:04.080 --> 2:01:08.160]  your own silver coins which is totally legal and he's going to president looks
[2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:11.240]  like and they're trying to confiscate seven million dollars in silver and

[2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:20.640]  keep it there and so just there's the government robbing everybody and they
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:24.120]  first tried to rate him thinking he wouldn't have enough to you know for his
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:27.920]  deposits like a bank does with fractional reserve banking where they'll
[2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:32.480]  have you know $1 for every 10 they loan out turned out he had enough and more so
[2:01:32.480 --> 2:01:35.640]  they said well we can't get sued for this let's just go ahead and get a jury
[2:01:35.640 --> 2:01:38.880]  together that guys this has happened a lot the last few years I want to have it

[2:02:17.160 --> 2:02:21.480]  who would walk around with Liberty dollars tell people about silver currency
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:26.360]  at UT and he was trying to tell people about it at UT and they thought it was
[2:02:26.360 --> 2:02:32.400]  illegal and they called the cops over he was on the edge of UT and downtown and
[2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:37.240]  he had a concealed carry the permit big software you know programmer you know
[2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:42.840]  wealthy guy and they sent him to prison and you know they came because of the
[2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:46.040]  silver and then they said oh you got a fanny pack again goes yeah they said
[2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:50.160]  well you're a thousand feet from UT we're gonna go and get you for that the
[2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:54.120]  cop did his duty and took him to jail and taught him and his family taught him
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:03:00.560]  real good hadn't seen Chris in years I know he did some stint in jail but
[2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:04.960]  that's what happens oh we can't get you for this silver coin
[2:03:04.960 --> 2:03:08.760]  remember the video that we ought to queue this up and play it and I know we
[2:03:08.760 --> 2:03:12.440]  posted on infowars.com about two weeks ago I know we have it saved and ever
[2:03:12.440 --> 2:03:16.280]  played it on air we ought after we take calls that introduced Nuthoss we ought
[2:03:16.280 --> 2:03:21.360]  to play that minute or two clip of him with a $1400 one ounce gold coin of
[2:03:21.360 --> 2:03:27.000]  American Eagle in fact face value 50 bucks under the US Mint and he goes and
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:32.320]  has it but you got two tacos at Taco Bell tries to give her a gold coin and
[2:03:32.320 --> 2:03:36.280]  she says I don't want this he says so you don't want $1400 bucks he said no I
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:41.760]  want the $2 and he said okay here's $2 she said I love it and maybe maybe
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:47.280]  DICE deserves to be sent to prison of course it was legal tender actual US
[2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:51.920]  issued gold but it doesn't matter folks they can find a jury to send you to jail
[2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:58.000]  and so we're gonna go to break and come back go to Greg, Angie, John, Adam, Tim
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:05.080]  and others a few segments of calls then we'll play that Mark Dice clip ahead of
[2:04:05.080 --> 2:04:09.720]  Nuthoss joining us after this quick break and I do have some other news that
[2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:15.280]  we're going to be hitting on as well but in the Obama administration's moving
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:20.080]  ahead with government shutdown plans and in the month of March they outspent what
[2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:25.840]  they had budgeted eight and a half times but that doesn't matter because they've
[2:04:25.840 --> 2:04:29.040]  got people held hostages through their pension funds the big banks always
[2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:33.080]  saying give us more taxes give us more money or we won't pay your pensions and
[2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:36.840]  so they'll basically go out and protest demand taxes get raised and then that
[2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:41.680]  money won't be spent for their pensions it'll be stolen but they're ignorant so
[2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:45.040]  the people perish for lack of knowledge but your phone calls we come back after
[2:04:45.040 --> 2:04:50.480]  this quick break and then we have the head of Liberty dollar now I guess headed
[2:04:50.480 --> 2:04:54.520]  to prison they've gone to the last times we talked to him for a while because he
[2:04:54.520 --> 2:04:58.600]  dared issue silver coins publicly for 15 years and talk about about the Federal
[2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:04.360]  Reserve stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:08.800]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[2:05:08.800 --> 2:05:12.840]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[2:05:12.840 --> 2:05:16.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:20.760]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:05:20.760 --> 2:05:25.320]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:05:25.320 --> 2:05:29.320]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:05:29.320 --> 2:05:33.120]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:05:33.120 --> 2:05:36.760]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[2:05:36.760 --> 2:05:41.080]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:05:41.080 --> 2:05:44.240]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[2:05:44.240 --> 2:05:48.080]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my old sponsors you can

[2:07:13.520 --> 2:07:16.800]  government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse

[2:08:12.520 --> 2:08:17.280]  taking your phone calls and then we have Bernard von Nahas joining us who headed
[2:08:17.280 --> 2:08:21.440]  up the Liberty dollar for 15 years convicted in court of counterfeiting
[2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:26.400]  publicly said it was private silver currency openly to compete with the
[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:29.800]  fiat currency they found a jury that didn't know their head from a hole in
[2:08:29.800 --> 2:08:33.600]  the ground and he has been convicted now they're trying to see seven million
[2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:37.760]  in golden silver that is coming up we had Ron Paul on earlier and of course
[2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:41.160]  Peter Schiff jam-packed transmission today great job to the crew and
[2:08:41.160 --> 2:08:44.840]  producers let's go to your phone calls Greg in Missouri you're on the air
[2:08:44.840 --> 2:08:50.680]  welcome welcome thank you sir two quick questions for you yes okay my first
[2:08:50.680 --> 2:08:54.640]  question now obviously I heard you with Ron Paul early very optimistic about his
[2:08:54.640 --> 2:08:58.440]  prospects of announcing a presidential run oh he's gonna announce don't worry
[2:08:58.440 --> 2:09:01.600]  mm-hmm you heard it the next month he's gonna be saying one way or the other
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:05.120]  and he's already going to a debate look he's gonna announce for president unless
[2:09:05.120 --> 2:09:08.640]  he has health problems I made all the overtures I mean it's pretty much done
[2:09:08.640 --> 2:09:13.640]  deal but my question with you let's say hypothetically that it didn't happen
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:17.040]  would there be anywhere to turn to otherwise any other alternatives yeah
[2:09:17.040 --> 2:09:21.760]  we fight on all fronts we're gonna take our counties our states back ninth and
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:26.520]  tenth amendment we're gonna help people rediscover the Bill of Rights and
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:30.000]  Constitution the Liberty culture enshrine the Declaration of Independence
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:35.840]  the kickoff the spirit of 1776 we're gonna continue with lawsuits against
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:38.880]  government-run health care that's totally illegal to bring us basically
[2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:42.840]  death care and the death panels they now admit and that Bill Gates admits and
[2:09:42.840 --> 2:09:47.240]  says is great and the Newsweek promotes we're going to fight them on every front
[2:09:47.240 --> 2:09:53.720]  and we're going to win Ron Paul is gonna win even if he loses he's gonna
[2:09:53.720 --> 2:09:58.840]  get probably ten times the coverage and attention in the debates and everywhere
[2:09:58.840 --> 2:10:04.160]  that he got three years ago can you imagine look look he probably won't win
[2:10:04.160 --> 2:10:09.960]  it doesn't matter it's gonna be a major issue you think he almost got the Fed
[2:10:09.960 --> 2:10:13.320]  abolished and audited and abolished earlier think of the power of this
[2:10:13.320 --> 2:10:16.400]  movement's gonna have now think of how many people are gonna get awakened to
[2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:20.000]  liberty it's already the hottest movement look three four years ago
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:23.640]  Bilderberg was worried about Ron Paul before he even ran we got that from inside
[2:10:23.640 --> 2:10:27.720]  Bilderberg and Ottawa we got it the next year they are scared to death because
[2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:31.280]  that they want to just give you fake liberal or fake conservative it's a
[2:10:31.280 --> 2:10:35.080]  controlled paradigm they only fight with each other over the power levers
[2:10:35.080 --> 2:10:40.040]  instead now we're talking about the New World Order a guy is about to run for
[2:10:40.040 --> 2:10:44.560]  president who is who is winning the major polls for for president so the
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:49.560]  media is trying to ignore him a guy who's basically like a statesman like
[2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:54.480]  Alex Jones is about to get massive attention again I mean this is when when
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:11:02.760]  when he cannot lose even if he loses we win absolutely okay one other question
[2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:06.880]  for you to get time sure okay I don't know if you've ever addressed this on
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:11.760]  your show before but as a college student I'm required to read writings by
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:15.480]  people like Michael Shermer another so-called skeptics I wanted you to you
[2:11:15.480 --> 2:11:19.040]  got a minutes real quick give me how you feel about those type of people that
[2:11:19.040 --> 2:11:24.280]  love to try to debunk so-called well look all the so-called debunkers of 911
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:27.440]  truth and people that I mean just ten years ago they said that the Federal
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:31.680]  Reserve wasn't private that there wasn't a plan for a global currency and they
[2:11:31.680 --> 2:11:36.720]  just sit there making jokes playing the lowest common denominator and they
[2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:42.080]  build straw men they debunk people like myself by going to folks that are
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:46.920]  conspiracy theorist and make things up they call you conspiracy theorist if you
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:51.960]  question this being a war and they say no it's not a war don't be a
[2:11:51.960 --> 2:11:55.480]  conspiracy theorist I appreciate your call I mean I read to you last week the
[2:11:55.480 --> 2:11:59.600]  quotes of Carl Rove saying oh we call you people that know that we lied about
[2:11:59.600 --> 2:12:04.200]  WMD's the reality community you're right but it doesn't matter we control
[2:12:04.200 --> 2:12:08.400]  reality and we'll change it day-to-day and and you don't count now he's trying
[2:12:08.400 --> 2:12:13.240]  to buffalo you he's saying resistance is futile like the Borg no resistance is
[2:12:13.240 --> 2:12:20.040]  not futile we don't have a choice so Cass Sunstein can say arrest people that
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:24.760]  don't believe in anthropogenic global warming so what he's losing the debate
[2:12:24.760 --> 2:12:30.480]  on every front we have the facts I mean it's all over every major medical
[2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:34.080]  institution the 20 minutes of direct sunlight a day massively reduces all
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:39.040]  different sorts of cancers he says it's a conspiracy theory that son is good for
[2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:43.160]  you they want to be able to tell you through political correctness what you
[2:12:43.160 --> 2:12:47.960]  can and can't say okay I mean it's that simple so I don't care about these
[2:12:47.960 --> 2:12:52.040]  debunkers whose websites might get a thousand visitors a day we get a million
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:56.520]  conservatively three million listeners in the market of ideas we're winning so
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:00.800]  what if they prop these guys up on TV to sit around and laugh at us I laugh at
[2:13:00.800 --> 2:13:05.600]  you punk I'm not talking about Greg I'm talking about folks you mentioned Angie
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:11.320]  in North Carolina you're on the air go ahead yes hi Alex I just wanted to touch
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:18.120]  on three things really quick the Pierce Morgan and Jesse Ventura interview you
[2:13:18.120 --> 2:13:22.840]  know that they're always quick to say that it's absurd and ridiculous but you
[2:13:22.840 --> 2:13:26.920]  know it seems like it doesn't often get pointed out well who benefited from nine
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:31.080]  oh no but again I'm glad you mentioned that they never give any facts they just
[2:13:31.080 --> 2:13:37.680]  give words like absurd conspiracy theory ridiculous that's their proof it doesn't
[2:13:37.680 --> 2:13:40.360]  matter we have the cops getting saying get back where they're gonna blow up
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:43.840]  building seven and newscast saying it then they blow it up and say we didn't
[2:13:43.840 --> 2:13:47.040]  say we blow it up we're like here's the video of you doing it it falls in
[2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:51.440]  freefall we can see the blast points they're like no no you don't see that I
[2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:55.600]  mean for eight years NIST said that it didn't fall at freefall now they've had
[2:13:55.600 --> 2:13:59.760]  to admit it did so again that's all they've got is you're an idiot you're
[2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:05.040]  dumb this is stupid there is no global government the dollars not devalued there
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:10.400]  is no inflation yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this isn't a war we don't have ground
[2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:16.680]  troops in Libya but we do I'm sorry Angie go ahead no that's okay you know it
[2:14:16.680 --> 2:14:21.480]  also goes back to you know the decision to not rebuild the towers I believe that
[2:14:21.480 --> 2:14:26.600]  that's kind of a an ongoing fiat that leaves people in the you know the post
[2:14:26.600 --> 2:14:32.400]  9-11 devastated or traumatized frame of mind and it makes it easier for them to
[2:14:32.400 --> 2:14:36.840]  push through all of this illegal legislation and for them to take away
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:41.520]  our rights and do well but that's a conspiracy theory they're not taking
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:45.720]  your rights people always say where's the martial law Alex well they're taking
[2:14:45.720 --> 2:14:50.200]  people's pension funds public and private outside law the big banks are
[2:14:50.200 --> 2:14:52.920]  allowed to launder hundreds of billions a year in drug money and not get in
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:58.360]  trouble the police are being federalized with threat fusion centers spying on
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:02.560]  Ron Paul and myself that's in the Associated Press they're breaking all
[2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:06.280]  these laws were being eased into an autocratic system but they're not going
[2:15:06.280 --> 2:15:10.560]  to announce it you know Gaddafi didn't call it martial law when he was running
[2:15:10.560 --> 2:15:15.360]  around shooting people he called it security and so they're like where's
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:21.400]  the crisis where's the problem where's the bad economy Alex we say it's good
[2:15:21.400 --> 2:15:27.920]  and but see they've only got the weakest minded people Angie buying into what
[2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:35.480]  they say exactly and one more quick thing you talk often about how Google and
[2:15:35.480 --> 2:15:41.520]  other companies can actually tap into your computer microphone and camera and
[2:15:41.520 --> 2:15:44.960]  I have a real quick way that people can prove to themselves that they're doing
[2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:50.400]  it just that and it's happening to them right now and if you click if you right
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:56.120]  click on any video on YouTube it's gonna bring up a menu of options and if you go
[2:15:56.120 --> 2:16:02.240]  down to the settings you right click on a video you go down to settings and a
[2:16:02.240 --> 2:16:07.120]  little screen will come up Adobe flash player settings and you'll have to click
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:11.880]  on the little options on the bottom it's the second option and a privacy screen
[2:16:11.880 --> 2:16:17.480]  will come up and it says allow s y timg.com which is the just the adobe
[2:16:17.480 --> 2:16:22.640]  adobe flash player to access your camera and microphone and if you don't know to
[2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:28.400]  actually click on deny then likely they are accessing your camera and my
[2:16:28.400 --> 2:16:32.760]  no Angie great point I've been on a couple national radio shows I do
[2:16:32.760 --> 2:16:36.720]  interviews every day and they'll say what's the evidence of police state and
[2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:40.320]  I go well homeland security has blimps up over every major city at above a
[2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:43.600]  hundred thousand feet that are solar powered watching you and they laugh at
[2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:48.360]  me and I go just type homeland security blimp in they admit it MSNBC you know
[2:16:48.360 --> 2:16:52.080]  you name it they just they just laugh because that's fun to laugh and I'll
[2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:56.000]  say well you saw in Philadelphia they gave out thousands of laptops watching
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:59.640]  the kids and their beds and their showers and they go no no they didn't
[2:16:59.640 --> 2:17:05.360]  they laugh at me and I go but that's that's all over the news and and I say
[2:17:05.360 --> 2:17:10.320]  okay well we wrote an article six years ago at prison planet dot com off the
[2:17:10.320 --> 2:17:15.360]  the press release of Google announcing to their board of directors and stock
[2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:20.360]  holders that they were now tapping into cameras and microphones but they said
[2:17:20.360 --> 2:17:25.600]  don't worry a person isn't listening or watching a computer is if they hear a
[2:17:25.600 --> 2:17:30.760]  dog bark then you'll have geo located dog food ads pop up or we'll listen to
[2:17:30.760 --> 2:17:37.320]  what sitcom you're watching and then put ads up for that I mean this was a press
[2:17:37.320 --> 2:17:43.200]  release from Google dot com I mean I'm just and I tell people on mainline talk
[2:17:43.200 --> 2:17:47.800]  radio and they just go oh the Martian's gonna get me next Alex and I'm like no
[2:17:47.800 --> 2:17:54.360]  this is being done I remember eight nine years ago Tevo in press releases
[2:17:54.360 --> 2:17:57.680]  admitted that they were tracking what you watch and what you do and selling
[2:17:57.680 --> 2:18:02.320]  your psychological breakdown to advertisers it's two way and then Janet
[2:18:02.320 --> 2:18:06.200]  Jackson had the wardrobe malfunction though and then they said Tevo said we
[2:18:06.200 --> 2:18:10.600]  had 2.2 million replays in five minutes in Chicago Tribune people said well how
[2:18:10.600 --> 2:18:17.000]  do you do that I mean it's it's it's people fully living in denial I mean I've
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:22.320]  got articles out of Tennessee articles out of California articles out of
[2:18:22.320 --> 2:18:27.080]  Pennsylvania articles out of Florida with cameras in the school showers
[2:18:27.080 --> 2:18:32.440]  watching the children at the police department and then I'm the bad man for
[2:18:32.440 --> 2:18:36.360]  reading the articles on air because the local news will report it like it's good
[2:18:36.360 --> 2:18:41.280]  or school districts all over watching kids over their laptops I mean I was
[2:18:41.280 --> 2:18:45.280]  speaking to a crowd a few months ago in Santa Cruz and some of them kind of
[2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:48.640]  looked and shook their heads like they didn't believe me I can see the crowd
[2:18:48.640 --> 2:18:52.680]  when I talked about Pennsylvania and watching the kids over the laptops
[2:18:52.680 --> 2:18:58.440]  because they hadn't heard about it it's like if I mentioned today multiple
[2:18:58.440 --> 2:19:02.160]  companies coming out with milk that's human milk because they've re-engineered
[2:19:02.160 --> 2:19:07.480]  the genetics of the cows udders and all the genetic problems that can cause and
[2:19:07.480 --> 2:19:11.040]  I just mentioned that I guarantee that people driving along don't believe that
[2:19:11.040 --> 2:19:15.800]  doesn't matter if it's one in Telegraph Reuters just they're like that isn't
[2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:21.440]  possible and I see the news articles they'll pick and choose Jones is crazy
[2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:25.840]  he talks about part spider part goats he talks about world government he talks
[2:19:25.840 --> 2:19:29.760]  about population reduction he talks about corrupt elites off this guy's
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:34.800]  crazy and they never give the footnotes or links to everything I'm saying on
[2:19:34.800 --> 2:19:40.000]  record I mean your pension funds are already gone they're just getting you
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:43.120]  ready to hear you're not gonna be getting them and that's been announced
[2:19:43.120 --> 2:19:47.740]  43 states are bankrupt the feds are bankrupt to the banks that engineered
[2:19:47.740 --> 2:19:52.800]  this they made the money up out of nothing or call straight ahead stay

[2:22:08.800 --> 2:22:12.120]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[2:22:12.120 --> 2:22:17.440]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[2:22:17.440 --> 2:22:22.520]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling them
[2:22:22.520 --> 2:22:26.840]  currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about 70% of
[2:22:26.840 --> 2:22:31.360]  US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our friends at
[2:22:31.360 --> 2:22:34.920]  the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar will soon
[2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:38.600]  become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes
[2:22:38.600 --> 2:22:43.680]  and savings destroyed I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the

[2:23:08.080 --> 2:23:11.640]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than

[2:23:15.400 --> 2:23:19.280]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at

[2:24:01.880 --> 2:24:11.720]  we're gonna jam in a few more calls ahead of our guests joining us but I just
[2:24:11.720 --> 2:24:17.920]  wanted to add that being a conspiracy theorist means believing anything the
[2:24:17.920 --> 2:24:22.040]  government says might not be true questioning anything thinking for
[2:24:22.040 --> 2:24:25.600]  yourself means you're a conspiracy theorist now there are people who think
[2:24:25.600 --> 2:24:31.000]  the earth is hollow and populated by mold men they are conspiracy theorists in
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:34.480]  that wide spectrum of alternative thought there are people that believe
[2:24:34.480 --> 2:24:41.440]  things that have no proof but when I get up here and talk about real issues and
[2:24:41.440 --> 2:24:44.480]  historical things that are happening just look at the track record and how we
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:51.320]  document 99% of what we discuss here it's just that you know I get up here
[2:24:51.320 --> 2:24:55.440]  three months ago when it's in Texas news we'd reported it before people didn't
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:24:58.560]  really believe it even though we had medical experts on that they're putting
[2:24:58.560 --> 2:25:03.800]  radioactive isotopes in municipal water supplies because it's mined in the same
[2:25:03.800 --> 2:25:08.000]  deposits to get the fluoride now it's in the news here in Texas and other
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:11.840]  states that the feds and state are covering it up but still people have
[2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:15.120]  this comfort zone where they don't want to admit that's going on because they
[2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:18.720]  might have to do something you know you're putting radiation that causes
[2:25:18.720 --> 2:25:22.040]  sterilization and cancer in my water I better go down to the city council and
[2:25:22.040 --> 2:25:27.160]  get angry and you go down there they laugh at you well then you sue them you
[2:25:27.160 --> 2:25:30.520]  go down there with the news articles and say don't don't laugh punk and let me
[2:25:30.520 --> 2:25:35.520]  tell you the Austin council didn't laugh him now you know this whole con artist
[2:25:35.520 --> 2:25:39.040]  thing where they just laugh at you and patch you on the head yeah it's extreme
[2:25:39.040 --> 2:25:42.160]  they're putting this in our water it's hard to believe but it's true what are
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:47.600]  we gonna do about it see I'm red-blooded I'm nothing special folks I'm just a
[2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:51.720]  red-blooded guy like anybody else and you punch me in the nose or you try to
[2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:55.400]  overtax me or you try to poison me I'm gonna get angry and I'm gonna stand up
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:26:01.240]  to you that's just being red-blooded but being red-blooded is a conspiracy
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:06.160]  theorist being informed is a conspiracy theorist being involved in reality it
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:13.080]  doesn't work anymore let's go to John and Michigan you're up next go ahead hey
[2:26:13.080 --> 2:26:17.920]  how you doing good I got three things for you the first is a quote for Carl
[2:26:17.920 --> 2:26:22.720]  Rove and that is the lie can be maintained only for such time as the
[2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:26.560]  state can shield the people from the political economic and or military
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:32.640]  consequences of the lie now that was a Nazi said that wasn't it yeah gerbils
[2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:37.840]  yeah and then the other thing I want to back you up on our last week you
[2:26:37.840 --> 2:26:43.200]  covered for a second there's a threat of nuclear bombs across the country and you
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:48.000]  pointed out like there's no way for that to happen without those being seen now
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:51.760]  it's all part of the fear they said Alcada buried 160 bombs and they took it
[2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:59.440]  serious well in 2008 there's a story the Seattle Times covered it and Keith
[2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:03.800]  Olberman covered it you can find the video on YouTube just Google worst
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:09.480]  person Michael Chertoff Walmart Lindsey Graham and there's a story about a guy
[2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:15.080]  who got pulled over for having a cat that went through chemotherapy and he he
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:20.040]  passed by some sensor and they isolated an isotope in his car they pulled him
[2:27:20.040 --> 2:27:25.080]  over searched his car and realized that he had a radiated cat no they've got
[2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:30.440]  radiation spotting helicopters satellites it's everywhere but no Alcada
[2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:35.400]  buried in government buildings 160 nukes now you couldn't get into a
[2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:39.560]  government building and you know bury a daisy but oh they're in there and we
[2:27:39.560 --> 2:27:43.440]  better give all our rights up it aren't we lucky TSA's there or Alcada will
[2:27:43.440 --> 2:27:49.400]  detonate the nukes and the third thing I'll preface let's see they're the
[2:27:49.400 --> 2:27:55.120]  conspiracy terrorists they're the ones that lie and make up ridiculous fables
[2:27:55.120 --> 2:28:00.600]  yeah other the third thing I was I was gonna bring up something that tripped
[2:28:00.600 --> 2:28:05.560]  me out I had to do with Japan they'll preface with I take everything at
[2:28:05.560 --> 2:28:09.720]  Benjamin Benjamin Fulford talks about with a grain of salt you know because
[2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:14.760]  you can't really prove it or but I seen an interview with him where he was
[2:28:14.760 --> 2:28:19.000]  talking about Japan being threatened with harp and all this other stuff and
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:24.520]  what tripped me out was I thought he recently did this this interview it was
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:30.840]  from two years ago as it's worth it's worth checking out just uh what did
[2:28:30.840 --> 2:28:38.360]  Fulford say is I saw this interview this past week and I looked it up to get a
[2:28:38.360 --> 2:28:41.880]  better copy and found out that this interview took place two years ago and
[2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:46.160]  he was going on two years ago about Japan being threatened to go along with
[2:28:46.160 --> 2:28:52.720]  banking system his Japan the country is being threatened with harp and that
[2:28:52.720 --> 2:28:55.640]  they're gonna unleash all these earthquakes on them if they didn't go
[2:28:55.640 --> 2:28:59.760]  along with yeah well I'm not trying to say that there couldn't be something to
[2:28:59.760 --> 2:29:05.120]  that but also Japan is probably debatable the number one or number two
[2:29:05.120 --> 2:29:09.280]  earthquake and tsunami zone in the great ring of fire in the Pacific so it's
[2:29:09.280 --> 2:29:13.120]  one of the most volcanically and tectonically active places in the
[2:29:13.120 --> 2:29:17.080]  world you know that's why they for thousands of years have built their
[2:29:17.080 --> 2:29:22.560]  houses out of paper and balsa wood so they don't fall on them and kill them so
[2:29:22.560 --> 2:29:27.520]  you know kind of saying well if there's ever an earthquake or a or a event here
[2:29:27.520 --> 2:29:30.800]  it must be harp we do have the former secretary of defense William Cohen
[2:29:30.800 --> 2:29:33.920]  admitting they have earthquake weapons and so we have to look at that but I
[2:29:33.920 --> 2:29:39.640]  appreciate your call will be right back ladies and gentlemen with the mark dice

[2:32:13.520 --> 2:32:17.800]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[2:32:17.800 --> 2:32:22.160]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[2:32:22.160 --> 2:32:26.200]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[2:32:26.200 --> 2:32:30.760]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[2:32:30.760 --> 2:32:34.920]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[2:33:08.920 --> 2:33:16.920]  I remember when I lost my mind
[2:33:16.920 --> 2:33:20.920]  there was something so pleasant about that place
[2:33:20.920 --> 2:33:28.920]  even your emotions haven't let go in so much space
[2:33:28.920 --> 2:33:32.920]  and when you out there without care yeah I was out of touch
[2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:36.920]  okay folks we're gonna play about a minute and a half clip with Mark Dice
[2:33:36.920 --> 2:33:40.920]  after a big brother they are welling in nightmare come true
[2:33:40.920 --> 2:33:44.920]  his new book available at info wars.com where he tried to go to a California
[2:33:44.920 --> 2:33:52.920]  Taco Bell with a $1400 pure US eagle legal tender $50
[2:33:52.920 --> 2:33:56.920]  gold coin that's what its face value is but it's worth $1400 in real numbers
[2:33:56.920 --> 2:34:02.920]  and for two tacos totaling $2 and they did not want the gold coin he tries to
[2:34:02.920 --> 2:34:06.880]  give the gold coins away and people don't want them they seem to be afraid of them
[2:34:06.880 --> 2:34:10.880]  and even the wall street journal reported when private money becomes a felony offense
[2:34:10.880 --> 2:34:14.880]  that's the wall street journal producer of liberty dollars is found guilty and they said
[2:34:14.880 --> 2:34:18.880]  he is a domestic terrorist the southern poverty law center hailed it and said
[2:34:18.880 --> 2:34:22.880]  that they had called him a domestic threat before and they're very glad that he's
[2:34:22.880 --> 2:34:26.880]  been convicted of doing something totally legal and did we ever find the article
[2:34:26.880 --> 2:34:30.880]  I mentioned of the man arrested for using $2 bills at Best Buy
[2:34:30.880 --> 2:34:36.880]  I want to put that on screen once he gets up here we're going to
[2:34:36.880 --> 2:34:41.880]  Bernard Vaughn no towels here in just a moment but first let's play this Mark Dice clip
[2:34:41.880 --> 2:34:47.880]  Dice and I'm at the Taco Bell drive-thru right now where I'm going to try to purchase
[2:34:47.880 --> 2:34:54.880]  my 99 cent taco with a one ounce gold coin and worth about $1400
[2:34:54.880 --> 2:35:02.880]  this is an American Eagle gold coin it's legal tender for $50 it's a $50 coin
[2:35:02.880 --> 2:35:10.880]  but the gold content is worth now about $1400 and of course it's ludicrous to
[2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:16.880]  to try to spend one of these anywhere for the $50 and the point is of course to
[2:35:16.880 --> 2:35:22.880]  show that most people have no idea what gold is worth or anything
[2:35:22.880 --> 2:35:28.880]  hopefully the people at Taco Bell won't otherwise this is going to be the most
[2:35:28.880 --> 2:35:33.880]  expensive taco in history
[2:35:33.880 --> 2:35:41.880]  Hi, how about a one ounce gold coin except one ounce gold coins at Taco Bell
[2:35:41.880 --> 2:35:47.880]  Is this how much it's one ounce? No, thanks
[2:35:47.880 --> 2:35:54.880]  Well here I have a couple of Federal Reserve notes would you rather have these instead?
[2:35:54.880 --> 2:36:03.880]  Who needs a one ounce gold coin these days you know?
[2:36:03.880 --> 2:36:09.880]  That's a good point who needs I should keep that as a collection
[2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:17.880]  No, thanks awesome thank you
[2:36:17.880 --> 2:36:20.880]  Oh boy
[2:36:20.880 --> 2:36:28.880]  well thankfully she thought it was best that I keep my one ounce gold coin
[2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:36.880]  obviously having no idea what it's worth and I don't know if it picked up the audio
[2:36:36.880 --> 2:36:41.880]  but I asked you know would you rather have these you know $2 bills
[2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:46.880]  rather have these two $1 bills and she said yes
[2:36:46.880 --> 2:36:55.880]  Alright now we're joined by Bernard Vaughn Notaus who for more than 15 years
[2:36:55.880 --> 2:36:59.880]  that's how long I've seen the gorgeous gold and silver coins out there
[2:36:59.880 --> 2:37:02.880]  publicly saying the dollar is going to be devalued
[2:37:02.880 --> 2:37:07.880]  we need to get alternative currencies going Montana's moving ahead South Carolina
[2:37:07.880 --> 2:37:10.880]  with their state legislatures to issue their own currencies
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:14.880]  dozens of cities for hundreds of years and currently in the U.S.
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:19.880]  have their own script that are used and accepted by businesses when you go to a
[2:37:19.880 --> 2:37:23.880]  David Buster's or something to eat dinner and play video games with your children
[2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:27.880]  or basketball or foosball you give them cash and they put it on a digital card
[2:37:27.880 --> 2:37:30.880]  that's a way of transferring or barter
[2:37:30.880 --> 2:37:34.880]  but even the Wall Street Journal said wow this jury didn't know anything
[2:37:34.880 --> 2:37:38.880]  and they said when private money becomes a felony offense this is very dangerous
[2:37:38.880 --> 2:37:41.880]  we'll also put on screen I see these reports every few months
[2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:45.880]  if you put put golf or at Best Buy you happen to get some $2 bills
[2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:48.880]  the Declaration of Independence on the back you go try to buy it
[2:37:48.880 --> 2:37:52.880]  they arrest you and you go to jail and then they continue to charge you
[2:37:52.880 --> 2:37:55.880]  and they've got juries ready to send you to prison
[2:37:55.880 --> 2:37:58.880]  and because once they arrest you they can't say they're wrong
[2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:02.880]  and expanding on this they went on to say
[2:38:02.880 --> 2:38:05.880]  and we'll go through the court filing that he is a terrorist
[2:38:05.880 --> 2:38:09.880]  so it's not only counterfeiting to publicly say we have an alternate
[2:38:09.880 --> 2:38:14.880]  silver and gold currency but it is illegal
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:17.880]  I guess to then criticize the Federal Reserve
[2:38:17.880 --> 2:38:19.880]  we have Peter Schiff on earlier who's very worried about this
[2:38:19.880 --> 2:38:22.880]  and Ron Paul earlier the congressman was on with us
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:25.880]  saying that he's concerned about him coming after gold and silver
[2:38:25.880 --> 2:38:30.880]  and the canary in the coal mine was Bernard von Notaus
[2:38:30.880 --> 2:38:34.880]  and he's now been convicted they're trying to confiscate $7 million
[2:38:34.880 --> 2:38:37.880]  of other people silver and gold that they'd already bought and he was sending to them
[2:38:37.880 --> 2:38:40.880]  so Bernard good to have you on with us
[2:38:40.880 --> 2:38:43.880]  it's a pleasure Alex
[2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:47.880]  well I've never talked to such a rascally criminal before I interviewed you many years ago
[2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:52.880]  you'd run other big private very popular collector coin mints
[2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:57.880]  tell us what happened and how you're the evil terrorist now
[2:38:57.880 --> 2:39:02.880]  well just to clarify about the terrorist thing
[2:39:02.880 --> 2:39:07.880]  first you know I'm not evil but I am unique
[2:39:07.880 --> 2:39:12.880]  that's what Anne Topkin referred to me as
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:15.880]  I am a unique terrorist
[2:39:15.880 --> 2:39:19.880]  and the reason I would have to be a unique terrorist even in her book
[2:39:19.880 --> 2:39:25.880]  is because when you look at the different elements that make up the charge of terrorism
[2:39:25.880 --> 2:39:28.880]  violence is one of the requirements
[2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:34.880]  so if I have never shown any violence I've not had any history of violence
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:37.880]  there's no violence at all
[2:39:37.880 --> 2:39:41.880]  so for them to charge me with terrorism
[2:39:41.880 --> 2:39:46.880]  I would have to be not only unique but they would have to bring out a whole brand new law
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:50.880]  so this is a lot of favor rattling on the part of the government
[2:39:50.880 --> 2:39:54.880]  because I'm not a terrorist but they sure in a hell would like for me to
[2:39:54.880 --> 2:39:57.880]  and by the way briefly tell us your history
[2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:01.880]  I remember decades ago seeing your TV ads on
[2:40:01.880 --> 2:40:04.880]  there's many other companies but you had one of the most prominent
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:07.880]  it was the Hawaiian mint correct putting out other collector coins
[2:40:07.880 --> 2:40:10.880]  I mean thousands of companies do this
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:14.880]  oh yes right I was the co-founder of a royal Hawaiian mint
[2:40:14.880 --> 2:40:18.880]  36 years ago so I have a long history of
[2:40:18.880 --> 2:40:22.880]  deviant counterfeiting operation
[2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:23.880]  Alex
[2:40:23.880 --> 2:40:27.880]  wait a minute I see commemorative coins all the time for Obama put out by
[2:40:27.880 --> 2:40:31.880]  again how many private mints are there out there
[2:40:31.880 --> 2:40:34.880]  I mean this is not illegal but I guess now it is
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:38.880]  no it's not illegal and I wasn't a counterfeiter
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:41.880]  last 36 years either I was just joking about that Alex
[2:40:41.880 --> 2:40:45.880]  of course there is a well
[2:40:45.880 --> 2:40:49.880]  a loose number but around a dozen or so
[2:40:49.880 --> 2:40:53.880]  give or take a few on each side but there's a dozen maybe 15 private mints
[2:40:53.880 --> 2:40:57.880]  in the United States
[2:40:57.880 --> 2:41:01.880]  and the royal Hawaiian mint was a private mint was one of the private mints
[2:41:01.880 --> 2:41:05.880]  well let's go back to the beginning when did you start the Liberty dollar
[2:41:05.880 --> 2:41:09.880]  a few years ago they came after you now they've quote convicted you
[2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:13.880]  but I've seen people convicted for legal firearms as well because some of these
[2:41:13.880 --> 2:41:17.880]  juries aren't too
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:21.880]  informed but I mean let's break down what's happened to you are you going to jail
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:25.880]  are you appealing where is this going
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:29.880]  yeah I did it on all those just to give you a real quick scenario
[2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:33.880]  Liberty dollars first issue on October 1st 1998
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:37.880]  at the time that there was a $10 silver Liberty they were $7
[2:41:37.880 --> 2:41:41.880]  50 cents the highest that that has ever sold for
[2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:45.880]  on eBay not to me but somebody else somebody else
[2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:49.880]  bought one for $7 at 50 cents it went for $825
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:53.880]  for one ounce silver Liberty
[2:41:53.880 --> 2:41:57.880]  I routinely see him I routinely see him for a couple hundred bucks
[2:41:57.880 --> 2:42:01.880]  on there now the memory serves you put out some earlier silver coins
[2:42:01.880 --> 2:42:05.880]  because I remember there was an earlier incarnation of this in like the mid 90s that I got
[2:42:05.880 --> 2:42:09.880]  from you no not like this
[2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:13.880]  but you were putting out coins before though so it must have been one that was similar
[2:42:13.880 --> 2:42:17.880]  I never have put out a coin because the coin is on the issue but it got around around
[2:42:17.880 --> 2:42:21.880]  around well we like to call them silver Liberty because
[2:42:21.880 --> 2:42:25.880]  round is kind of like calling you hey
[2:42:25.880 --> 2:42:29.880]  and you probably wouldn't like me to call you hey would you out okay well you got the floor
[2:42:29.880 --> 2:42:33.880]  then break down the intrinsicities of all of this
[2:42:33.880 --> 2:42:37.880]  what do you mean by that I mean I mean the most important
[2:42:37.880 --> 2:42:41.880]  info for folks to know of what's happened to you well what's happening
[2:42:41.880 --> 2:42:45.880]  is that they raided Liberty dollar they confiscated
[2:42:45.880 --> 2:42:49.880]  everything they arrested me and they convicted me and they're trying to
[2:42:49.880 --> 2:42:53.880]  abscond with nine tons of gold silver and platinum
[2:42:53.880 --> 2:42:57.880]  and copper and the vast majority of that the way vast majority of
[2:42:57.880 --> 2:43:01.880]  that matter of fact almost all of it is property owned by other third party
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:05.880]  either people who ordered product for Liberty dollar and the orders weren't
[2:43:05.880 --> 2:43:09.880]  fulfilled because we were raided or products that they bought in terms
[2:43:09.880 --> 2:43:13.880]  of digital and paper warehouse receipts and they confiscated
[2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:17.880]  the gold and silver that backed that up so if people really want to take action
[2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:21.880]  then they should be emailing me burnard at libertydollar.org
[2:43:21.880 --> 2:43:25.880]  and ask for the form that they need to
[2:43:25.880 --> 2:43:29.880]  send back to me from them identifying themselves
[2:43:29.880 --> 2:43:33.880]  as interested parties otherwise the bottom line is
[2:43:33.880 --> 2:43:37.880]  the government's going to steal your property so Alex
[2:43:37.880 --> 2:43:41.880]  if you have any of those paper warehouse receipts you should send me an email
[2:43:41.880 --> 2:43:45.880]  I'll send you a little quick little email back that you can then respond to me
[2:43:45.880 --> 2:43:49.880]  and identify yourself as an interested party
[2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:53.880]  and to be clear I actually do have some of those
[2:43:53.880 --> 2:43:57.880]  somewhere in my office it was not only silver and gold coins
[2:43:57.880 --> 2:44:01.880]  just like other alternative currencies do you also had receipts
[2:44:01.880 --> 2:44:05.880]  100% backed up in silver and gold and it was catching
[2:44:05.880 --> 2:44:09.880]  on but if they tried to scare everybody away from this by going after you
[2:44:09.880 --> 2:44:13.880]  they're failing because of Montana South Carolina and other
[2:44:13.880 --> 2:44:17.880]  states moving to issue their own currencies
[2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:21.880]  well it isn't just states either Alex there's a lot of different people
[2:44:21.880 --> 2:44:25.880]  within the movement Rob Gray with
[2:44:25.880 --> 2:44:29.880]  who has introduced a whole line of currency
[2:44:29.880 --> 2:44:33.880]  which is extremely similar to liberty dollar there are
[2:44:33.880 --> 2:44:37.880]  half a dozen other different people who have introduced currencies that
[2:44:37.880 --> 2:44:41.880]  are similar to liberty dollar so the
[2:44:41.880 --> 2:44:45.880]  animal is really quite large and then if you look at the collector
[2:44:45.880 --> 2:44:49.880]  liberty dollars on ebay there's anywhere from 400 to
[2:44:49.880 --> 2:44:53.880]  500 different types of liberty dollars on ebay
[2:44:53.880 --> 2:44:57.880]  it's going anywhere from a few dollars to
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:01.880]  20,000 dollars or so
[2:45:01.880 --> 2:45:05.880]  there's a white range in terms of liberty dollars
[2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:09.880]  how dare you issue collector liberties now
[2:45:09.880 --> 2:45:13.880]  where is this going give us the time frame
[2:45:13.880 --> 2:45:17.880]  are you going to jail tell us about the trial itself
[2:45:17.880 --> 2:45:21.880]  I am going to jail
[2:45:21.880 --> 2:45:25.880]  I don't know it's really up to the judge
[2:45:25.880 --> 2:45:29.880]  I've never been a criminal before so I don't know
[2:45:29.880 --> 2:45:33.880]  how it's supposed to behave but the census
[2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:37.880]  could range from 0 to 15 years
[2:45:37.880 --> 2:45:41.880]  and I don't know what that's going to be
[2:45:41.880 --> 2:45:45.880]  I'm in what is called pre-sentencing
[2:45:45.880 --> 2:45:49.880]  period right now and the government is working on a pre-sentencing report
[2:45:49.880 --> 2:45:53.880]  for me which will influence the link to my census and then
[2:45:53.880 --> 2:45:57.880]  ultimately it will be up to the judge so the judge could make
[2:45:57.880 --> 2:46:01.880]  it anywhere from 0 to 15 years
[2:46:01.880 --> 2:46:05.880]  I have no idea what it's going to be
[2:46:05.880 --> 2:46:09.880]  I think the judge did a very honorable job I don't have any complaints with the judge
[2:46:09.880 --> 2:46:13.880]  his rules and his rulings were
[2:46:13.880 --> 2:46:17.880]  straightforward they weren't always
[2:46:17.880 --> 2:46:21.880]  in my favor they weren't always
[2:46:21.880 --> 2:46:25.880]  against me either I think the judge did an honorable job
[2:46:25.880 --> 2:46:29.880]  have you had any pre-sentencing hearings yet are the feds asking for stiff
[2:46:29.880 --> 2:46:33.880]  jail time for your terrorism
[2:46:33.880 --> 2:46:37.880]  well they can't ask for anything for terrorism because I wasn't convicted for terrorism
[2:46:37.880 --> 2:46:41.880]  they're just calling you a special time a big sarcastic of course
[2:46:41.880 --> 2:46:45.880]  unique don't forget unique
[2:46:45.880 --> 2:46:49.880]  we haven't put up anything yet but all that will be put
[2:46:49.880 --> 2:46:53.880]  in the pre-sentencing report and of course that's
[2:46:53.880 --> 2:46:57.880]  just in its early stages right now tell us about the trial tell us about
[2:46:57.880 --> 2:47:01.880]  the people involved
[2:47:01.880 --> 2:47:05.880]  well the trial consisted of only 8 days unfortunately
[2:47:05.880 --> 2:47:09.880]  the government which was going to
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:13.880]  last about at least a week they folded after 2 days
[2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:17.880]  there's only 2 days of the prosecution
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:21.880]  that was it they folded
[2:47:21.880 --> 2:47:25.880]  so quickly that we asked the judge for
[2:47:25.880 --> 2:47:29.880]  a day to recover and to get things organized because they were going to do for a week
[2:47:29.880 --> 2:47:33.880]  and 2 days I mean and the judge granted us the motion to
[2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:37.880]  give us more time to get our case together
[2:47:37.880 --> 2:47:41.880]  unfortunately my attorneys relentlessly
[2:47:41.880 --> 2:47:45.880]  whittled away at the defense
[2:47:45.880 --> 2:47:49.880]  and packaged it up much to my disagreement
[2:47:49.880 --> 2:47:53.880]  within only
[2:47:53.880 --> 2:47:57.880]  about 4 days that was it
[2:47:57.880 --> 2:48:01.880]  we started out with 112 witnesses
[2:48:01.880 --> 2:48:05.880]  the judge approved 82 witnesses
[2:48:05.880 --> 2:48:09.880]  which is huge and we ended up with 8 witnesses
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:13.880]  very convicted of counterfeiting when you never said
[2:48:13.880 --> 2:48:17.880]  that this was US government currency you were talking down
[2:48:17.880 --> 2:48:21.880]  that currency as evidenced by the devaluation now happening of the dollar
[2:48:21.880 --> 2:48:25.880]  and that this was an alternative private currency I mean
[2:48:25.880 --> 2:48:29.880]  there's so many private currencies that will make your head spin I mean this
[2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:33.880]  the Wall Street Journal is saying this has set a very dangerous precedent
[2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:37.880]  I totally agree with you and the thing is that
[2:48:37.880 --> 2:48:41.880]  the counsel for Norfed and the Liberty Dollar
[2:48:41.880 --> 2:48:45.880]  testified he was the first witness to testify he testified
[2:48:45.880 --> 2:48:49.880]  for over half a day and gave me an iron clad
[2:48:49.880 --> 2:48:53.880]  a reliant defense otherwise known as good-faced defense
[2:48:53.880 --> 2:48:57.880]  because everything I did was under his guidance and with his permission
[2:48:57.880 --> 2:49:01.880]  so he told me that what I was doing was not illegal
[2:49:01.880 --> 2:49:05.880]  so in spite of that the
[2:49:05.880 --> 2:49:09.880]  jury came back and found me guilty how is that possible
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:13.880]  I don't know I'm not guilty
[2:49:13.880 --> 2:49:17.880]  I'm still not guilty but I have been found guilty by the jury
[2:49:17.880 --> 2:49:21.880]  but not by the popular press even
[2:49:21.880 --> 2:49:25.880]  AP and Wall Street Journal everybody's pretty amazing
[2:49:25.880 --> 2:49:29.880]  you look at the feedback on the different articles
[2:49:29.880 --> 2:49:33.880]  if you go to the Yahoo page
[2:49:33.880 --> 2:49:37.880]  there's 98% on your side I've never seen anything like it
[2:49:37.880 --> 2:49:41.880]  I think they're really revealing themselves as tyrants but what about this jury
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:45.880]  did these people have ten fingers ten toes
[2:49:45.880 --> 2:49:49.880]  I mean could they talk
[2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:53.880]  they talked enough to get appointed to the jury
[2:49:53.880 --> 2:49:57.880]  there were nine guys and three women
[2:49:57.880 --> 2:50:01.880]  Alex I don't know how it happened
[2:50:01.880 --> 2:50:05.880]  my attorneys were shocked
[2:50:05.880 --> 2:50:09.880]  I'm a little shocked myself
[2:50:09.880 --> 2:50:13.880]  I'm facing 15 years
[2:50:13.880 --> 2:50:17.880]  how can I be convicted of this I have a reliant defense I've never had any criminal intent
[2:50:17.880 --> 2:50:21.880]  they didn't prove anything well you've been doing it for what 12-13 years
[2:50:21.880 --> 2:50:25.880]  this is the 13th year sir
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:29.880]  unlucky year well as Peter Schiff said as Ron Paul said
[2:50:29.880 --> 2:50:33.880]  this is all setting a very dangerous precedent for everybody
[2:50:33.880 --> 2:50:37.880]  Wall Street Journal says well this has always been legal
[2:50:37.880 --> 2:50:41.880]  but if they can find juries what next is having a ham sandwich
[2:50:41.880 --> 2:50:45.880]  going to be punishable by 15 years
[2:50:45.880 --> 2:50:49.880]  is having black hair going to be illegal is walking your dog going to be illegal
[2:50:49.880 --> 2:50:53.880]  if they can do this well they were scared of you
[2:50:53.880 --> 2:50:57.880]  I want to talk about why you think they came after you and how we can help you

[2:54:17.880 --> 2:54:21.880]  of the story but clearly even the mainline media is freaked out by this
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:25.880]  and if we go back to 1933 when they ordered everybody to turn their gold in
[2:54:25.880 --> 2:54:29.880]  and they sold it to Europe and doubled the price if we put up with these crux
[2:54:29.880 --> 2:54:33.880]  there's no end to what they'll do and they've got an army of handpicked juries
[2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:37.880]  that will put mother Teresa behind bars bernard your comments
[2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:41.880]  bernard your comments
[2:54:41.880 --> 2:54:45.880]  yes sir I know you're having trouble hearing us
[2:54:45.880 --> 2:54:49.880]  so where do we go from here
[2:54:49.880 --> 2:54:53.880]  well I think people should certainly
[2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:57.880]  protect their purchasing power by getting gold and silver
[2:54:57.880 --> 2:55:01.880]  and while I was convicted of
[2:55:01.880 --> 2:55:05.880]  liberty dollar people could certainly band together
[2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:09.880]  to do something else you know the government was very
[2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:13.880]  specific in their case and so they tried an
[2:55:13.880 --> 2:55:17.880]  interesting path I don't know if anybody else is going to go down that path
[2:55:17.880 --> 2:55:21.880]  after I get sentenced or not but
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:25.880]  certainly with hyperinflation on the horizon Alex
[2:55:25.880 --> 2:55:29.880]  people have to take action well you've certainly been proven right
[2:55:29.880 --> 2:55:33.880]  and so is Ron Paul expanding on that bottom line
[2:55:33.880 --> 2:55:37.880]  what came after you to create a chilling effect to scare people away from alternate
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:41.880]  currencies
[2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:45.880]  well that's certainly been the effect there's no doubt about that but the bottom
[2:55:45.880 --> 2:55:49.880]  line and Ron Paul actually mentioned this on the
[2:55:49.880 --> 2:55:53.880]  floor of the congress and that was that the government felt threatened
[2:55:53.880 --> 2:55:57.880]  and quite frankly Alex
[2:55:57.880 --> 2:56:01.880]  I don't have such errors of that to be honest with you I find it
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:05.880]  unbelievable that this government would be threatened by anything
[2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:09.880]  or anyone particularly a kickback surfer dude
[2:56:09.880 --> 2:56:13.880]  like myself from Hawaii but evidently the
[2:56:13.880 --> 2:56:17.880]  idea of individual creating
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:21.880]  his own currency and the enormous popularity
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:25.880]  that it enjoyed the government
[2:56:25.880 --> 2:56:29.880]  must have felt threatened they had to do something
[2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:33.880]  they heard now they're coming out saying they want to restrict free speech
[2:56:33.880 --> 2:56:37.880]  they are threatened by any form of liberty
[2:56:37.880 --> 2:56:41.880]  oh yes and that was the really damaging thing
[2:56:41.880 --> 2:56:45.880]  of the threatening thing about being a unique terrorist
[2:56:45.880 --> 2:56:49.880]  because in that sort of situation
[2:56:49.880 --> 2:56:53.880]  Alex they can take the word terrorist and
[2:56:53.880 --> 2:56:57.880]  tailor it to anything they want or they need for a particular
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:01.880]  situation including yourself Alex oh I know they're using
[2:57:01.880 --> 2:57:05.880]  the Patriot Act now against marijuana family
[2:57:05.880 --> 2:57:09.880]  violence a lot of the media saying maybe I need to be censored maybe I'm a terrorist
[2:57:09.880 --> 2:57:13.880]  I know these people are authoritarian despots
[2:57:13.880 --> 2:57:17.880]  that are very dangerous and any idea on when the sentencing is coming back
[2:57:17.880 --> 2:57:21.880]  up does that like to interview you again
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:25.880]  well we don't know for sure but it takes about two months to do
[2:57:25.880 --> 2:57:29.880]  the pre-sentencing report and so that would be happening
[2:57:29.880 --> 2:57:33.880]  during April and May so I might be sentenced in June would be a
[2:57:33.880 --> 2:57:37.880]  a guesstimate on my part did they threaten you to keep your mouth shut or anything
[2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:41.880]  they meaning the government
[2:57:41.880 --> 2:57:45.880]  yes they are our lords no no they haven't had any
[2:57:45.880 --> 2:57:49.880]  contact with me at all and that wouldn't be proper for the
[2:57:49.880 --> 2:57:53.880]  and are the feds proud of what they're doing now I mean are they feeling good about this
[2:57:53.880 --> 2:57:57.880]  they must be I mean they got
[2:57:57.880 --> 2:58:01.880]  the conviction that they wanted and they duped the
[2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:05.880]  jury into convicting me if they're not happy and I'm not happy
[2:58:05.880 --> 2:58:09.880]  damn there's something wrong with this crazy somebody supposed to come out of every deal
[2:58:09.880 --> 2:58:13.880]  being happy you know well I guess they're pleased America is imploding
[2:58:13.880 --> 2:58:17.880]  and dying right now so their job is going quite well for them but America is waking up
[2:58:17.880 --> 2:58:21.880]  in closing is there an address a phone number where people can support you or contact
[2:58:21.880 --> 2:58:25.880]  you a Bernhard von Notaus yes the only way to
