[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:37.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:37.000 --> 00:49.000]  It's FEMA's job, since they were set up in 1979 by the outgoing Jimmy Carter, to deal with continuity of government, nuclear war, emergencies, earthquakes, man-made natural disasters.
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  So they're always preparing for biological pandemics, mass graves, you name it.
[00:54.000 --> 01:03.000]  In fact, Aaron Dykes wrote an article like three years ago that made national news with the headline that states prepare mass graves.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  And then we show the state documents with the phone numbers.
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  In fact, you guys print me that, just states prepare for mass graves, pandemic, Aaron Dykes, infowars.com.
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.000]  That should pull it up if you put the infowars.com in.
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  Because before I get to Paul Watson's article, and Paul's a great guy, my best writer, my most prolific.
[01:22.000 --> 01:31.000]  But so many times, we will take something and then dial it back, because we don't want to sound sensational.
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  If it is sensational, it is sensational.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  And then you should report it.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  So many times in history, incredibly bad things happen.
[01:40.000 --> 01:48.000]  Because people can't believe something amazing is happening, either amazingly good or amazingly bad.
[01:48.000 --> 01:56.000]  So many people have something wonderful dropping their laps, and they will self-destructively destroy themselves to sabotage it, not believing that they could be successful.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  But they did find the actual article.
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  Let's throw it back up there.
[02:00.000 --> 02:08.000]  There's the Aaron Dykes article from jonesreport.com, a site we don't really update anymore, but we intend to down the road.
[02:08.000 --> 02:17.000]  Plans for mass graves confirmed, government surveying, cemetery readiness for flu outbreak.
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.000]  Print me that again, thank you.
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  And then I'm going to have Watson add that to his article, because I ended up editing here on air.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.000]  And I have the guys correct me on air as well.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  We're all helping each other, we're all correcting each other, we're trying to get it right.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  And, you know, his article isn't scary enough, his article isn't bad enough.
[02:35.000 --> 02:46.000]  His article needs to get people concerned so that we can have a debate about this and hopefully stop whatever's coming, or at least be individually prepared for it.
[02:46.000 --> 02:55.000]  Because it's not my job to scare you, but when something is scary, it's not my job to say, is FEMA preparing for a pandemic?
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.000]  Question mark.
[02:57.000 --> 03:04.000]  Federal agency seeks 40-yard dumpsters for biomedical waste disposal during emergency.
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.000]  Well, I mean, they're preparing mass graves, they're preparing forced inoculations, they're preparing under infra-guard lockdowns, under clergy response teams.
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  The church is saying, take your inoculations, go to the campus of the Lord.
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  That's on the news.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  I could play a TV eclipse with them reporting it like it's a good thing.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  Here's the article.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  I'm going to have this added to Paul Watson's report.
[03:25.000 --> 03:35.000]  The headline is FEMA accelerates or expands preparation for biological pandemic.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  Or medical waste could be for a civil war, you know, what they need for a bunch of dead military and police.
[03:40.000 --> 03:50.000]  The point is they're expanding across the board and their main mission is letting the foreign globalist offshore crime syndicate take over this country.
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.000]  But here it is, plans for mass graves confirmed, government surveying, cemetery readiness for flu outbreak.
[03:57.000 --> 04:04.000]  And how to bury millions in Illinois, Indiana, New York, that's just three states we got documents from.
[04:04.000 --> 04:17.000]  We had one emergency manager on from Indiana near Chicago, you know, close to the border with Illinois, where they wanted to be ready to bury 3 million people on county property.
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  In the Indiana area, county, unnamed county, people didn't believe it.
[04:22.000 --> 04:32.000]  So then I got a bunch of documents sent to me by state insiders and funeral homes and folks that own the cemeteries who got the letters saying prepare.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  And we've got copies of those with phone numbers if you'd like to.
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  So is FEMA preparing for pandemic?
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  Do great white sharks eat seals?
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  Do elephants have long curly trunks and little tails?
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  I don't know. Does the Easter Bunny leave eggs outside for the children?
[04:51.000 --> 05:19.000]  The point is is that we're going to get into that and a lot more big show lined up for you today.
[05:19.000 --> 05:25.000]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[05:25.000 --> 05:30.000]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLine fluoride shield formulation,
[05:30.000 --> 05:41.000]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[05:45.000 --> 05:53.000]  I use fluoride shield every day. Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at infowarslife.com today.

[06:00.000 --> 06:06.000]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[06:06.000 --> 06:13.000]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.000]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply. There's only two ways to avoid this.
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.000]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[06:23.000 --> 06:26.000]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[06:26.000 --> 06:32.000]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO.
[06:36.000 --> 06:42.000]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine exclusively available
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  at infowarslife.com.
[06:44.000 --> 06:50.000]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  Secure your super high quality nascent iodine today at infowarslife.com.
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  That's infowarslife.com.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[07:08.000 --> 07:15.000]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[07:15.000 --> 07:21.000]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  These are items that I did research on that I personally use.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  You've got the life straw so you can turn fetted water into safe water anywhere you go.
[07:30.000 --> 07:35.000]  The K-Tor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  Strategic relocation third edition by Joel Scalzen.
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  When disaster strikes by Matthew Stein.
[07:41.000 --> 07:46.000]  They're a safe use by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  Hand crank shortwave AMFM radios.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at infowarshop.com.
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  And your purchase makes our info war possible.
[07:56.000 --> 08:18.000]  We're getting prepared. Are you infowarshop.com?
[08:18.000 --> 08:39.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[08:39.000 --> 08:49.000]  Well today is the day. It is the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade.
[08:49.000 --> 08:59.000]  And we have 55 million million with an M, dead children in this country since then.
[08:59.000 --> 09:08.000]  And you notice basically every other freedom and liberty is also dying or dead right now at the very, very same time.
[09:08.000 --> 09:15.000]  So coming up in the next hour, I'm going to open the phones up specifically for a discussion of abortion,
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  whether you're for it against it, whether you agree with me disagree, whether you have your own stories to tell.
[09:21.000 --> 09:29.000]  But I look at my three children and I think about the fact that they could have been aborted.
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  I could have legally gone and killed them.
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  Or my wife could have legally gone and killed them.
[09:36.000 --> 09:45.000]  And I imagine the world without them and all the joy they've brought me and how I have a love for them that transcends that for my father, my mother, my wife.
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  It is the strongest love out there.
[09:48.000 --> 09:56.000]  And just even imagining them in distress or imagining them being slaves or imagining them living under this tyranny breaks my heart.
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  And people that don't love, they don't know what it means to have your heart broken.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  It's when you feel broken inside.
[10:02.000 --> 10:10.000]  It is a constant pain when people that you love die and that every time you remember them, the heart brokenness comes back.
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  But there is an emptiness in love that's also fulfilling.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  It's better to have loved and lost than never have loved at all.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  And love is the secret in the world.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  It's what ties us all together.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  It's what binds us.
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  Those of us that love goodness.
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  And that doesn't mean that those of us that love goodness are wimps or that we have a narrow vision.
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  I have a wide vision into evil and into corruption.
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  I understand it as well.
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.000]  And I understand worldliness and I understand hatred.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  I understand avarice.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  I understand will to power.
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  I understand the ideas of dominance.
[10:49.000 --> 10:56.000]  And certainly when you're young and immature, those things are more attractive, but they become less and less attractive.
[10:56.000 --> 11:04.000]  So that when I have to defeat somebody or dominate somebody in righteousness, I don't take a pleasure in it.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  It is more a mechanical function and I'm more effective at it not being as emotional.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  But I do fall back into emotionalism on a routine basis and we have emotions for a reason.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  We're meant to get angry.
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  We're meant to hate evil.
[11:20.000 --> 11:35.000]  But my love of the innocent is so much stronger that it is just a whole universe of my being compared to the reservoir of hate and evil.
[11:35.000 --> 11:39.000]  That is also in my in my heart.
[11:39.000 --> 11:45.000]  But then again, I'm beginning to attempt to wax poetic here today.
[11:45.000 --> 11:53.000]  Now, this is one of those days where I am just absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of news that we've got here.
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.000]  I just mentioned this in the last segment.
[11:54.000 --> 12:04.000]  FEMA is preparing for mass pandemic buying giant dumpsters to put, quote, medical waste, you know, that we know they've bought coffins and prepared mass graves.
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  And you want to see the proof of that?
[12:05.000 --> 12:11.000]  We have an article from 2009 info wars dot com that I've had added to Paul Watson's new article that's out today.
[12:11.000 --> 12:18.000]  Plans for mass graves confirmed government serving cemetery readiness for flu outbreak and tens of millions dead.
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  And that's ongoing.
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.000]  But, you know, we don't just have one article about FEMA gearing up today and then move on to another.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  We then also connected back to some of the back knowledge.
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.000]  In fact, let's put that article back up with the headline there for folks.
[12:36.000 --> 12:48.000]  And then let's click on some of those documents actually so folks can see that that are watching us on television at prison planet dot TV and info wars news dot com.
[12:48.000 --> 12:57.000]  And there you can see the Bureau of Cemetery's out of New York and the director of it saying prepare for millions of dead and mass graves.
[12:57.000 --> 13:13.000]  And of course, we got these documents from Indiana, Illinois, New York, Arizona and others when people were in denial about our FEMA preparing mass graves report, which FEMA was involved in.
[13:13.000 --> 13:23.000]  And they put out a big dis info piece in the news saying that that was not not true and not the case and that the coffin liners had a dual purpose.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  Well, of course, they have a dual purpose.
[13:25.000 --> 13:34.000]  The military training for urban warfare and gun confiscation domestically can be used in Macedonia or Iraq or Libya or anywhere else.
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  But they're also training domestically on record to confiscate our guns.
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  They've ordered to do so under presidential decisions are active 51 and others.
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.000]  And it's declassified and leaked 50 plus different ways or more.
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  Army times associated press info wars dot com in the last six years that preparations being accelerated.
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  So I'm sick of the denial and oh, it's that crazy guy Alex Jones.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  You know, he thinks the government's gearing up for martial law.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  We're already in a form of martial law in this country.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  So up on info wars dot com right now.
[14:11.000 --> 14:18.000]  Let me just mention some of these headlines and then I will get into all the other news FEMA accelerates preparations for pandemic.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  Report TSA threatens to put man on list over parody video.
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  I'm going to be getting to that.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  There's actual audio of this up on the site.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  Cynical new PR stunt greases skids for humanitarian invasion of Syria.
[14:32.000 --> 14:42.000]  Very important new hoax just like the chemical weapons attack hoax has now been not double triple quadruple, but the UN all the inspectors.
[14:42.000 --> 14:51.000]  Even this week, new documents came out yesterday that it was totally launched by the Syrian rebels funded by Bandar Bush Prince Bandar out of Saudi Arabia.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  Same one launching terror attacks all over Russia right now.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  Here's another one.
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  How dare they invite Iran to the Syrian peace conference.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  Yes, there's a big freak out about that.
[15:00.000 --> 15:13.000]  Also, again, we're going to get into the $23 trillion credit bubble in China is starting to collapse and may signal the next major global financial crisis.
[15:13.000 --> 15:20.000]  And there's another story that says US Army elite special forces train with local cops in secretive joint exercise.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  That's outside Fort Bragg.
[15:22.000 --> 15:29.000]  And normally when there's an urban warfare training drill, we've gone out to many of these and documented that it's to acclimate the public.
[15:29.000 --> 15:39.000]  There are the general population for martial law that it is a militarization of police program to condition everyone to accept it.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  And that's now on record in this particular case.
[15:42.000 --> 15:51.000]  I think it's important to report on it, but it's part of a program they've had since the forties for special forces.
[15:51.000 --> 15:59.000]  Qualification graduations and they've got different ones, the sage program and others, but but that's what this is.
[15:59.000 --> 16:08.000]  And they've had cases where police have actually killed special forces trainees because the special forces trainees think that they're supposed to subdue a cop.
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  In a drill, but the cop isn't part of the drill and kills them.
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.000]  It was a case like five years ago where the cop shot and killed two of them.
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  Who were trying to disarm him, they thought he was the guy part of the drill.
[16:21.000 --> 16:26.000]  He had just pulled somebody over at the designated spot where it was supposed to happen 10 minutes later.
[16:26.000 --> 16:34.000]  A case of the wrong place at the wrong time and two guys in camo with their faces blacked out, you know, with green paint on them ran up to disarm him.
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  And well, it was more of an exercise than they were ready for a tragedy.
[16:38.000 --> 16:50.000]  What's happening in the Fort Bragg area there in the Carolinas is part of a normal drill.
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.000]  But the problem is, is that in other areas, this has been used to blur the lines and they have expanded it.
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  So there's that report.
[16:58.000 --> 17:14.000]  Now, let me get into all the serious news here. If you're watching me on TV document cam, you can see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 stacks.
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.000]  Okay. Some of these stacks are 20 articles thick.
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  And we're going to skip this network break because I'm going to do it this time.
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.000]  I'm going to finally succeed. I've never succeeded in 18, almost 19 years on air.
[17:25.000 --> 17:31.000]  I guess it's 19 years now starting this year. I'm going to read just the top headlines and move on.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it right now.
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.000]  Organic food shortages hit US.
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  Party sees on abortion issue in midterm race.
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.000]  I am overwhelmed by 55 million babies killed since Roe v. Wade.
[17:47.000 --> 17:58.000]  Now, this is live news. Top story on Roe's report.com. Continuing tie government declare state of emergency as protests drag on.
[17:58.000 --> 18:04.000]  Russian police kill Tara suspect in winter Olympic security crackdown.
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  After collapse, six likely events that will follow an economic crash.

[23:57.160 --> 23:59.760]  tolerate anybody having views different than ours because we're
[23:59.760 --> 24:02.920]  authoritarians but it's okay because we have the moral high ground because we
[24:02.920 --> 24:06.480]  said we did because you know Andrew Cuomo's a known gangster along with his
[24:06.480 --> 24:10.880]  thug dad Mario Cuomo who hangs out at Bilderberg meetings and these are scum
[24:10.880 --> 24:15.400]  of the earth thugs and but but they're gonna tell you what you eat what you do

[24:36.360 --> 24:41.720]  abortions inside the institution and just like they've infiltrated the
[24:41.720 --> 24:44.320]  Catholic Church with all the pedophiles that's what's going on the public
[24:44.320 --> 24:47.480]  schools and they're going let us teach your five-year-old how to how to have

[24:56.640 --> 25:01.960]  homophobe homophobe arrest them arrest them Putin's absolutely right when he
[25:01.960 --> 25:06.120]  comes out and says gay people are welcome at the Olympics by the way I
[25:06.120 --> 25:08.720]  don't report on this and say this because I have something against quote gay
[25:08.720 --> 25:12.720]  people I'm sick of it I'm sick and I'm able to watch any TV show without being
[25:12.720 --> 25:15.640]  barred and barred in with sexual propaganda constantly I'm tired of the
[25:15.640 --> 25:20.840]  agenda and it is really causing a backlash in me somebody who's never you
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.880]  know put it on my radar and somebody who's not obsessed with it because there
[25:25.880 --> 25:28.480]  are people that are definitely latent homosexuals that are obsessed with it all
[25:28.480 --> 25:31.880]  day we all know that's going on I don't judge any of these people but here's the
[25:31.880 --> 25:35.960]  deal you keep your hands off our kids and Putin said this he said do not come
[25:35.960 --> 25:38.920]  trying to parade it in front of kids you're not trying to sell the agenda and
[25:38.920 --> 25:43.840]  that's what it is it is indoctrination because the militant homosexual liberal
[25:43.840 --> 25:51.560]  commie eugenics agenda on record ladies and gentlemen cannot reproduce and so
[25:51.560 --> 25:56.400]  they get their kids from CPS kids that are taken that's on record and I'm
[25:56.400 --> 26:01.520]  tired of being hunted I'm tired of being food because I mean that's all is we
[26:01.520 --> 26:05.040]  have a predatory society and gangs whether it's bad police groups or bad
[26:05.040 --> 26:09.280]  military groups in history or bad bureaucracies or bad street level gangs
[26:09.280 --> 26:15.680]  when society starts collapsing people get into gangs and I don't like when I'm
[26:15.680 --> 26:20.160]  in a restaurant that has a bar in it and you're out in the countryside and the
[26:20.160 --> 26:25.160]  local country boy mob shows up who doesn't even own cattle and doesn't you
[26:25.160 --> 26:28.680]  know don't even know how to you know all hat and no cattle or whatever and they
[26:28.680 --> 26:32.520]  show up and are acting tough in the bar trying to start fights I'm not against
[26:32.520 --> 26:36.800]  people that have cowboy hats and and have a ranch and drive a Ford F-150 I
[26:36.800 --> 26:44.400]  mean I'm that guy literally I just don't wear the cowboy hat but when I see the
[26:44.400 --> 26:48.120]  town's people it's always the town's guys that want to come in and start a
[26:48.120 --> 26:52.080]  fight in the bar I then don't like fake rednecks you understand that it's the
[26:52.080 --> 26:55.280]  same thing with gay people I mean I don't like the fact that there's this
[26:55.280 --> 26:58.640]  whole thing you know kiss in front of everybody in front of kids go to
[26:58.640 --> 27:02.040]  neighborhood areas and do this shove it in your face I would like being in a
[27:02.040 --> 27:06.120]  restaurant and a heterosexual couple gets up and starts kissing in front of
[27:06.120 --> 27:10.040]  my kids all because it's being done on purpose to get attention and to take
[27:10.040 --> 27:14.160]  over my mind and dominate me and and and we all know immature people that do
[27:14.160 --> 27:19.960]  that hey get a room they'll go go crazy just do not sit there and throw it in
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.760]  my face I've got stuff going on in my mind I'm talking to somebody I don't
[27:24.760 --> 27:28.360]  want you to dominate what I'm doing you want to tune into my radio show do it
[27:28.360 --> 27:32.520]  you want somebody to listen to you go get a radio show we'll get a TV show and
[27:32.520 --> 27:35.520]  we'll see if people want to watch you we'll see if they want to listen to you
[27:35.520 --> 27:39.240]  what it is is losers that want to force their agenda period and it could be
[27:39.240 --> 27:44.520]  anything it's like the South Park deal on motorcycle gangs a lot of motorcycle
[27:44.520 --> 27:47.760]  people are great folks I like them pro gun pro liberty but we all know the thug
[27:47.760 --> 27:52.080]  wannabe gangster type we all know the thug culture types most of the real
[27:52.080 --> 27:55.120]  criminal motorcycle gangs aren't out of trouble they're making money but the
[27:55.120 --> 27:59.040]  wannabe criminal outlaw motorcycle gangs you know the one percenters the
[27:59.040 --> 28:03.720]  three percenters whatever you want to call them they're the type of people that
[28:03.720 --> 28:07.880]  will literally go around into a nice resort area and try to like intimidate
[28:07.880 --> 28:12.960]  families sitting around eating lunch with their family because they're mentally
[28:12.960 --> 28:16.880]  ill scum that want to go push people around that's who fills the government
[28:16.880 --> 28:23.560]  now that's who fills tyranny now that's who feels the the the sales of the ship
[28:23.560 --> 28:27.240]  of tyranny and it's a mindset and it's a gangster mindset and it's a gang
[28:27.240 --> 28:31.920]  mindset it's a gang mentality read a law enforcement gang handbook or go
[28:31.920 --> 28:36.440]  research go buy a book or a library and get a book or an online book on gang
[28:36.440 --> 28:40.720]  psychology and then look around you it's gang psychology everywhere because
[28:40.720 --> 28:43.760]  humans are meant to be in tribes we're meant to be in gangs but by having the
[28:43.760 --> 28:48.520]  image of a gang being bad thugs that are mean and pushy they've taken over
[28:48.520 --> 28:51.160]  society we're supposed to have gangs that are in the Bill of Rights
[28:51.160 --> 28:55.600]  Constitution the family private property pro-life being upstanding having a
[28:55.600 --> 28:59.400]  good name and that everyone wants to do business with you everyone wants to work
[28:59.400 --> 29:03.520]  with you everyone wants to be around you and you create civilizations of honor
[29:03.520 --> 29:07.480]  and dignity and working together and then the criminals are displaced and
[29:07.480 --> 29:12.760]  finally destroyed and pushed out to the total edges of society and are jokes but
[29:12.760 --> 29:17.120]  Hollywood and the culture on purpose has glorified criminals of all types and
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.640]  that's the gangster culture that's taking over now listen I did the best I've
[29:21.640 --> 29:27.000]  ever done in 19 years on air I realize it's 19 years next month 19 years on air

[32:58.760 --> 33:21.600]  war's life calm
[33:21.600 --> 33:26.400]  well if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[33:26.400 --> 33:30.600]  it's Alex Jones
[33:30.600 --> 33:57.640]  you know what I think I'm going to start with
[33:57.640 --> 34:04.240]  I think I'm going to get to this article that's up on info wars calm first with
[34:04.240 --> 34:12.160]  the headline video California Democrat becomes internet joke after anti-gun
[34:12.160 --> 34:19.960]  press conference the anti-gun movement has given yet another reason why you
[34:19.960 --> 34:25.000]  should disregard comments from self-described experts on the alleged
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.440]  dangers of firearms ownership California Senator Kevin De Leon recently made a
[34:30.440 --> 34:35.840]  fool of himself while attempting to explain the most basic attributes of a
[34:35.840 --> 34:40.400]  firearm and I forget what was that state senator she's now been recalled we'll
[34:40.400 --> 34:47.600]  look this up something like Colorado anti-gun rep makes full of herself that
[34:47.600 --> 34:51.880]  was that was last year about six months ago she gets up she goes listen you say
[34:51.880 --> 34:55.560]  I won't do anything banning these high-capacity magazines you have to throw
[34:55.560 --> 34:59.720]  the gun away once you've used the magazine and you have to throw the
[34:59.720 --> 35:08.720]  magazine away didn't know that the magazines are clips can be used basically
[35:08.720 --> 35:14.840]  forever didn't know you could shoot hundreds of thousands of rounds that
[35:14.840 --> 35:20.480]  came out of a magazine has no idea no idea and so there's really two different
[35:20.480 --> 35:25.520]  types of anti gunners and I've experienced this in my life dealing with
[35:25.520 --> 35:29.120]  friends of my families that are very nice people they would give you the
[35:29.120 --> 35:34.480]  shirt off their back they would you know they give money to charity they help
[35:34.480 --> 35:40.880]  little old ladies liberals real liberals who really care about society really
[35:40.880 --> 35:44.880]  think abortions are right really doesn't think it's a baby really want to
[35:44.880 --> 35:48.720]  empower women think breaking up the family will do it really thinks high
[35:48.720 --> 35:51.840]  taxes are to help people doesn't understand the ultra-rich kid high taxes
[35:51.840 --> 35:55.280]  passed so they can selectively write laws to be exempt shut down their
[35:55.280 --> 35:58.280]  competition and then get the tax monies banker bailouts and corporate
[35:58.280 --> 36:03.640]  welfare I've run into liberals over the years and some of them known as I was a
[36:03.640 --> 36:08.520]  child one of them who I've told the story is a major was a national editor of a
[36:08.520 --> 36:13.080]  major newspaper and then a national editor of a major magazine and it's
[36:13.080 --> 36:19.120]  still an editor of a major magazine and in college I went to my parents house to
[36:19.120 --> 36:22.560]  get in the gun safe and my dad's closet because obviously you know college I
[36:22.560 --> 36:26.160]  wasn't keeping a bunch of guns at my place even though I lived off campus and
[36:26.160 --> 36:29.960]  I was going to get a bunch of deer rifles and stuff to go hunting and
[36:29.960 --> 36:32.360]  shooting because you know when you end up going deer hunt you're not really
[36:32.360 --> 36:34.600]  going deer hunting you're going to shoot a bunch of your guns out of the
[36:34.600 --> 36:39.680]  ranch and I was walking out and I walked out with some rifles and went out to the
[36:39.680 --> 36:44.240]  car and was coming back to get some more guns and I heard out of the living
[36:44.240 --> 36:47.760]  room looking into the study by my parents bedroom where I was coming out
[36:47.760 --> 36:55.520]  from the gun safe and I heard is that a gun is that a gun and my dad said yes
[36:55.520 --> 37:00.000]  it is he's just he keeps his guns here you don't want him getting stolen
[37:00.000 --> 37:05.360]  oh and loaded up just having a panic attack and my dad goes hold on just a
[37:05.360 --> 37:10.000]  minute he goes and it gets me he gets one of the guns I think it was a revolver
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.040]  and he comes in he goes look it's unloaded there's nothing no please get
[37:13.040 --> 37:20.360]  it out of here David I mean and then we go okay we're putting it up and let me
[37:20.360 --> 37:23.840]  tell you something when we put the gun back up it was like listen I don't
[37:23.840 --> 37:27.320]  appreciate sweat coming down his head he goes I'm not appreciate that I don't
[37:27.320 --> 37:30.520]  know why you tried to terrorize me like that that was completely inappropriate
[37:30.520 --> 37:34.600]  and in all my years knowing you Alex and you David I've known you Alex since
[37:34.600 --> 37:39.080]  you were a baby I cannot believe this these are people my parents vacation
[37:39.080 --> 37:46.480]  with you name it and I've since seen him of like five years later but we were at
[37:46.480 --> 37:49.080]  the beach my parents when I went with some friends got another beach house by
[37:49.080 --> 37:56.400]  him some friends of my parents my best friends and he was over there they were
[37:56.400 --> 38:00.040]  having cocktails and I said hey remember that he's like let's not discuss it I've
[38:00.040 --> 38:05.120]  already forgiven you and I was gonna say man it's not a big deal let me take
[38:05.120 --> 38:08.160]  you out to a shooting range sometime so you have to understand folks they
[38:08.160 --> 38:13.080]  literally when you were a child maybe you wrote a babysitter's house and they
[38:13.080 --> 38:16.720]  let you see a horror movie you got scared of aliens or something and I was
[38:16.720 --> 38:24.000]  like six years old and the VHS had just come out and they had alien on that and
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.040]  they put it in I was like six years old I sat there with a babysitter and just
[38:28.040 --> 38:31.000]  you know totally scared the daylights out of me and for years I'd be walking by
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.280]  in the house and see that my mom had this black and gray vacuum cleaner that
[38:34.280 --> 38:37.280]  kind of would stick out of the closet looking like the alien hiding in the
[38:37.280 --> 38:40.520]  closet and I mean that was something I actually had fears of of course got over
[38:40.520 --> 38:44.880]  it very quickly my dad said no you're not sleeping with us you've been sleeping
[38:44.880 --> 38:48.600]  by yourself that you were three you're not coming back into bed with us now but
[38:48.600 --> 38:54.320]  the point is that's how the average Democrat thinks of a gun is literally
[38:54.320 --> 39:01.000]  like I opened a closet when I was six and the alien comes out to eat me I mean
[39:01.000 --> 39:08.040]  that's the type of fear that these people have I'm talking sweating in in 30
[39:08.040 --> 39:12.640]  seconds having a total freak out that they saw me walking by with a gun so
[39:12.640 --> 39:17.200]  doesn't matter that gun crimes dropped 51% since 1992 in the FBI zone numbers it
[39:17.200 --> 39:22.960]  doesn't matter if mass shootings are flat it does none of that matters none of
[39:22.960 --> 39:28.520]  that even has an issue because they they'll take a tragic shooting you know
[39:28.520 --> 39:32.240]  the whole family of that six people in a minivan their guts brains are all over
[39:32.240 --> 39:36.440]  the highway dead babies they'll never show it on the news the cops and EMT's
[39:36.440 --> 39:41.480]  have to deal with that and it traumatizes them worst part about being a cop I've
[39:41.480 --> 39:44.600]  been told by family there are police's the dead bodies at car wrecks forget all
[39:44.600 --> 39:49.240]  the other stuff it's the dead kids at car wrecks people's heads chopped off you
[39:49.240 --> 39:52.560]  name it I've seen a few fatal car wrecks grown up in Dallas believe me like
[39:52.560 --> 39:56.960]  a road warrior or something because my dad always pull over to help he's one of
[39:56.960 --> 39:59.760]  those old-fashioned bad guys you know that actually try to help even if ten
[39:59.760 --> 40:02.120]  cars stopped ahead of him he would stop you know a goody two shoes a
[40:02.120 --> 40:05.280]  troublemaker like John Ballantone lady don't stand one foot from a burning car
[40:05.280 --> 40:08.520]  people are in that saying you know you troublemaker let her let her stand by
[40:08.520 --> 40:14.160]  the car it's safe so where am I going with this there are the types that are
[40:14.160 --> 40:18.320]  scared to death and actually have a Pavlovian psychological response like
[40:18.320 --> 40:21.960]  dressing up like a demon and running into your two-year-old's bedroom to scare
[40:21.960 --> 40:26.320]  them that's what they're doing is terrorizing childlike brains people
[40:26.320 --> 40:29.640]  that are smart when it comes to literature and art and are intellectual
[40:29.640 --> 40:35.880]  and are probably a hundred and thirty IQ's they still have an emotional
[40:35.880 --> 40:44.000]  response to go guns and the police can tase you and the government can beat
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.120]  you but if you but if they see a parent spank their kid in a JC pennies because
[40:48.120 --> 40:51.800]  the kids throwing a fit they go and call the police you see that in the news all
[40:51.800 --> 40:54.520]  the time where the cops come and don't do anything but then CPS gets the name
[40:54.520 --> 40:57.800]  and comes later because the mother seems and stop that stop that and the kid
[40:57.800 --> 41:01.680]  stops and then somebody tattles and the police get called and the police go
[41:01.680 --> 41:05.560]  well we don't see any marks but we got a follow report CPS still comes it
[41:05.560 --> 41:08.880]  tries to take the kid even though it's not illegal to spank your kids but then
[41:08.880 --> 41:11.280]  when your kids bad the state's gonna end up spanking them by putting them in
[41:11.280 --> 41:15.880]  prison putting them on psychotropic drugs to make them behave that actually
[41:15.880 --> 41:19.640]  attack their body but that's okay because the state's doing it see got the
[41:19.640 --> 41:23.600]  types that are irrationally scared there are real liberals out there who really
[41:23.600 --> 41:27.400]  think they're good people who are good people but that are traumatized somehow
[41:27.400 --> 41:31.360]  and never grew up around guns and believe the propaganda now that's the
[41:31.360 --> 41:36.680]  majority of them but at the top the bloombirds the Cuomo's the Bill Clinton's
[41:36.680 --> 41:40.400]  they've all got bodyguards they all own guns it comes out they're shooting
[41:40.400 --> 41:49.160]  enthusiasts up they're always getting caught they'll have giant gun collections
[41:49.160 --> 41:55.840]  they don't want you having it just like their tax exempt all the big
[41:55.840 --> 42:00.840]  corporations Google Microsoft all of them Michael Moore's got a bunch of guns
[42:00.840 --> 42:06.880]  he's got six bodyguards any one time all packing heat but you're not gonna have a
[42:06.880 --> 42:11.400]  gun so that's why I really don't like Michael Moore and really detest him
[42:11.400 --> 42:15.100]  because if you're a well-meaning person that's just wrong you're a fool I can't
[42:15.100 --> 42:19.040]  get through to you you've been brainwashed but I don't hate you but if
[42:19.040 --> 42:23.960]  you're Michael Moore or Bloomberg or Cuomo or Diane Feinstein I mean these
[42:23.960 --> 42:29.400]  people know what they're doing Feinstein reportedly is an incredible shot goes
[42:29.400 --> 42:34.600]  the shooting range weekly owns firearms packs a sig 9 millimeter in her purse
[42:34.600 --> 42:38.520]  fact she's she's given testimony admitting it this woman has bodyguards
[42:38.520 --> 42:41.880]  this woman's husband's a billionaire from government deals she gave him on
[42:41.880 --> 42:45.320]  record she's made over a hundred million going to Congress with nothing she is a
[42:45.320 --> 42:50.560]  disgusting criminal with criminal instinct who wants to disarm her quarry
[42:50.560 --> 42:54.760]  her target that is the American people and what I've told you is total veritas
[42:54.760 --> 43:00.440]  I've told you simple basic hundred percent truth everybody knows that
[43:00.440 --> 43:06.440]  who's not an idiot so we have a job just like they're in the schools trying to
[43:06.440 --> 43:11.640]  turn kids into pervs when they're five years old we need to be in the schools
[43:11.640 --> 43:14.520]  and we need to be in the culture that's why I want you to be able to say the word
[43:14.520 --> 43:17.720]  gun or draw a picture of your gun or talk about a shooting range or they
[43:17.720 --> 43:21.640]  have shooting range until 30 years ago in New York City schools in the
[43:21.640 --> 43:24.960]  basements they got rid of that they're getting rid of archery now they want a
[43:24.960 --> 43:32.400]  domesticated population in their soft war ahead of their full disarmament and
[43:32.400 --> 43:36.760]  so people like feinstein and others they know full well what they're doing
[43:36.760 --> 43:46.560]  people like representative diane degeti quote appears to not understand how
[43:46.560 --> 43:50.960]  guns work that's the Denver post said that you have to throw clips away and
[43:50.960 --> 43:55.400]  in another statement you throw guns away once the clip has been used and I
[43:55.400 --> 43:59.360]  guess she watches Hollywood movies where where you're you're emptying clips you
[43:59.360 --> 44:06.040]  just throw the guns down and I mean I guess if you were on some suicide mission
[44:06.040 --> 44:09.800]  or something at 15 guns on you I guess you might do that I would just bring
[44:09.800 --> 44:14.240]  three guns and a whole bunch of clips I wouldn't bring 10 guns or whatever but
[44:14.240 --> 44:18.400]  but I mean this is the mindlessness and the disconnect I guarantee you this
[44:18.400 --> 44:25.840]  woman and this new California Senator David de Leon or Kevin de Leon I
[44:25.840 --> 44:32.040]  guarantee you they want they go home at night at 7 o'clock and they put on
[44:32.040 --> 44:35.280]  television you know if you've ever been in a party in a high-rise condo or
[44:35.280 --> 44:39.280]  apartment downtown and you look out all you see is people in their houses
[44:39.280 --> 44:44.760]  watching television they're not playing board games they're not painting they're
[44:44.760 --> 44:48.560]  not even surfing the internet they're not having relations with each other
[44:48.560 --> 44:54.480]  they're not doing push-ups they're not having friends over they're watching
[44:54.480 --> 44:59.040]  television and there's just a blue glow in all the high-rises that's just all
[44:59.040 --> 45:03.120]  you see I come to go over my buddies who lives in a high-rise downtown I want to
[45:03.120 --> 45:06.520]  shoot a video of this with a telephoto lens and just zoom into people's
[45:06.520 --> 45:09.800]  apartments they've got their apartment windows open you're supposed to close
[45:09.800 --> 45:12.320]  the blinds there's no perception see because you got to have an eight foot
[45:12.320 --> 45:16.520]  fence around your house then someone can't look over it or it's a felony but
[45:16.520 --> 45:18.960]  you don't have a fence you can look over at somebody's wife all day out of the
[45:18.960 --> 45:21.640]  thing it's the same thing if you're up in a high-rise and you've got your
[45:21.640 --> 45:25.320]  blinds down you're sitting over the lights on there's no perception of
[45:25.320 --> 45:28.360]  privacy you know you can't put that on the internet then there could be a
[45:28.360 --> 45:31.920]  lawsuit or something but I can look in and see it and so what I'm gonna do is
[45:31.920 --> 45:35.720]  I'm just gonna show how people are there watching television just to
[45:35.720 --> 45:38.240]  illustrate they're not having I mean all of it you can sit there at night and
[45:38.240 --> 45:42.000]  it's just all the floors are glowing blue you can sit there I do it my
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.560]  binoculars when I go to his house and just sitting there his binoculars sitting
[45:45.560 --> 45:49.400]  there just looking at all the stuff that's going on and sit there and there's
[45:49.400 --> 45:52.520]  nothing to see because they're watching television you could see oh there's an
[45:52.520 --> 45:56.360]  NBA game on there's an NFL game okay they're watching sitcoms or watching
[45:56.360 --> 46:00.920]  dramas is anybody living is anybody having a life out there and why do I
[46:00.920 --> 46:04.360]  bring that up these people that don't know how guns work they believe
[46:04.360 --> 46:08.880]  television every woman I've talked to about shooting goes oh I don't want to
[46:08.880 --> 46:12.840]  shoot a handgun that'll blow me across the room and then you end up getting
[46:12.840 --> 46:16.240]  them out to shoot you end up getting friends and family out to shoot
[46:16.240 --> 46:20.240]  especially women never shot and they could shoot a 44 mag and it just barely
[46:20.240 --> 46:25.360]  goes back to that's not a big deal now you start shooting heavy magnum rifles
[46:25.360 --> 46:29.480]  and things if they don't pull it into their shoulder but I mean you can get a
[46:29.480 --> 46:32.960]  woman out there once she knows how it works with a Barrett 50 and you could
[46:32.960 --> 46:38.860]  fire 10 rounds out of it easy as pie if you could just hold the gun up in the
[46:38.860 --> 46:42.760]  recoil it's not a big deal now some people say it is but I don't think there
[46:42.760 --> 46:49.040]  is the point is is that this is the perception of oh I don't want a gun you
[46:49.040 --> 46:53.280]  fire one of those like police academy and the lady flies across the room now
[46:53.280 --> 46:56.320]  again if you have a rifle and you don't pull it up against your shoulder like
[46:56.320 --> 46:59.880]  it's part of your body and let your body take the recoil then there's an issue
[46:59.880 --> 47:03.960]  you leave an inch space between a rifle on yourself you're gonna get hurt because
[47:03.960 --> 47:09.520]  it's got space to speed up it's all basic energy issues and I don't want to
[47:09.520 --> 47:14.600]  digress it's just that I marvel at the anti-gun culture how ignorant they are
[47:14.600 --> 47:19.280]  and I know how to shoot I'm not even heavy into the gun culture I went out to
[47:19.280 --> 47:21.840]  the gun rally and wasn't thinking does that cops looking at me when I got in
[47:21.840 --> 47:26.760]  my car and put my M4 on with the barrel pointed up I know you point it down
[47:26.760 --> 47:30.520]  somebody goes hey you got that you're wearing that wrong you're wearing that
[47:30.520 --> 47:34.560]  rudely I was like I am excuse me you're right so we all got to keep each other
[47:34.560 --> 47:37.880]  in check but I mean you can't blame me I got out like eight cops staring right
[47:37.880 --> 47:40.960]  at me and I was wondering what's gonna happen when I got out with a rifle but
[47:40.960 --> 47:43.320]  we had to do that because they said it was illegal in San Antonio which it
[47:43.320 --> 47:46.680]  really wasn't we had to sit at the front of the bus we had to go down there and
[47:46.680 --> 47:51.440]  exercise that right and the police backed off you have to force a right or you
[47:51.440 --> 47:54.760]  lose a right now let's go to this latest moron clip we'll go back to the other
[47:54.760 --> 47:59.320]  clip of the Democrat in Colorado saying that you throw clips away after you use
[47:59.320 --> 48:05.280]  the magazines this is a California Senator Kevin De Leon basically saying
[48:05.280 --> 48:12.720]  stuff just as stupid here it is this is a ghost gun this right here has ability
[48:12.720 --> 48:20.280]  with a 30 caliber clip to disperse with 30 bullets within half a second 30
[48:20.280 --> 48:25.840]  magazine clip in half a second I mean just everything he's as dumb as that
[48:25.840 --> 48:34.960]  Miss Teen USA going USA American such as is 30 caliber clip 30 30 in a second
[48:34.960 --> 48:40.080]  dispense clip clip gun clip of course the other one takes the cake where she's
[48:40.080 --> 48:43.800]  like well of course it's gonna stop issues with guns you have to throw these
[48:43.800 --> 48:50.720]  clips away after you use them once can we get that clip again no pun intended of
[48:50.720 --> 48:55.840]  the lead sponsor in house in in Colorado representative Diane to Getty
[48:55.840 --> 49:01.120]  appears to understand how they work so so again there's the two camps you've
[49:01.120 --> 49:09.640]  got the the people who know what they're doing are trying to disarm their slaves
[49:09.640 --> 49:15.960]  I do think oh sure yeah let's go ahead and buy that clip if you got it I do
[49:15.960 --> 49:20.960]  think that we can pass those and just very briefly to your last question what's
[49:20.960 --> 49:26.960]  the efficacy of banning these magazine clips I will tell you these these this
[49:26.960 --> 49:32.840]  is these are ammunition they're bullets so the people who have those now they're
[49:32.840 --> 49:38.080]  going to shoot them and so if you ban if you ban them in the future the number
[49:38.080 --> 49:43.440]  of these high-capacity magazines is going to decrease dramatically over time
[49:43.440 --> 49:49.160]  because the bullets will have been shot and there won't be any more available
[49:49.160 --> 49:52.840]  but you know she's letting you into these meetings she's been having with the
[49:52.840 --> 49:55.680]  actual criminals where they're saying we're going to restrict bullets we're
[49:55.680 --> 49:58.960]  gonna shut down the mind-smelting we're gonna shut down importation we're gonna
[49:58.960 --> 50:02.600]  ban lead bullets and say they're environmentally bad we're going to ban
[50:02.600 --> 50:08.800]  them by making you have a license to own bullets and to own reloading
[50:08.800 --> 50:12.920]  material I mean I've talked to a bunch of people I know I've seen it in the news
[50:12.920 --> 50:16.920]  where the realtor comes look at your house and sees reloading equipment in
[50:16.920 --> 50:21.320]  the garage and calls the police or they see guns I've told the story probably
[50:21.320 --> 50:25.400]  500 times about the carpet cleaner that had the assistant that came to my house
[50:25.400 --> 50:31.360]  and saw a gun case in my studio not even have kids then this is like 14 years
[50:31.360 --> 50:35.920]  ago the guy said that's guns I can't clean this I'm like ran out of my house
[50:35.920 --> 50:40.120]  and about 10 minutes later I called the carpet cleaning place and they're like
[50:40.120 --> 50:43.800]  we can choose not to clean if he doesn't want to but we've stopped the call the
[50:43.800 --> 50:50.560]  police and they were still rude to me though so they were calling the police
[50:50.560 --> 50:58.640]  on me for a shotgun and a 243 and a Ruger range rifle in a gun case I mean

[54:19.560 --> 54:24.840]  before he left is trying to ban and tax fat across the board not just trans fats
[54:24.840 --> 54:30.280]  that's their move notice notice they they target everything not not not just the
[54:30.280 --> 54:33.960]  bad stuff because it's about control Michelle Obama doesn't say don't eat
[54:33.960 --> 54:38.920]  GMO she she basically says here's your recommended lunch and it's what the
[54:38.920 --> 54:42.760]  establishment would want you to eat and here's an article out of market watch
[54:42.760 --> 54:48.360]  butter is now winning the fat wars and it goes in to talk about how it's needed
[54:48.360 --> 54:54.120]  with essential fatty acids for the brain and to not get Alzheimer's the big
[54:54.120 --> 54:59.880]  secret is coconut coconut oil which remember was it like 20 years ago
[54:59.880 --> 55:03.680]  Rush Limbaugh made a big deal about this where movie theater stopped using
[55:03.680 --> 55:09.960]  coconut oil on the and went to like cheap trans fat fake stuff because coconut
[55:09.960 --> 55:14.760]  oil was so bad for you and they just went with a fake study so that they
[55:14.760 --> 55:19.240]  wouldn't have to use expensive coconut oil on things I mean it is just amazing
[55:19.240 --> 55:25.800]  how these people operate coconut oil is incredible I can be exhausted and need
[55:25.800 --> 55:29.680]  to do something like coast-to-coast AM a great radio show and stay up till 4 in

[55:33.680 --> 55:42.840]  and I will gobble three or four coconut oil pills liquid pills and I will take
[55:42.840 --> 55:47.400]  some other essential fatty acids and it literally is a brain boost stuff that
[55:47.400 --> 55:50.400]  sold at info wars health calm they got a whole bunch of her coconut supplements
[55:50.400 --> 55:53.760]  and pills and just amazing but I mean if you just eat raw coconut just go get

[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:44.640]  Roe v. Wade decision and I want to discuss that historical decision and
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.200]  break it down in fact guys I forgot to tell you this will you print me the Roe

[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.520]  Wikipedia on it as well I mean not that that's always accurate but if you look at
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.880]  the bibliograph you know the listing of facts at the bottom that's where the real
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.480]  intel's at and I want to refresh that and actually read over some of that in the
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:11.080]  next segment so we know what happened 41 years ago in the year before I was
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:16.960]  born and it was and I tell you the cause celeb when it happened women were out
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:21.080]  there wearing shirts saying I got an abortion you got Gloria Steinem talking
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.360]  about how sexy it is to this day I mean this is how you really show your man
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.920]  you're the boss is you deep six that baby of course really all it does is
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:42.040]  allow promiscuity fake relationships and using homicide of children as birth
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:47.920]  control and it is a dehumanization and what you do to the least of me you've
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.720]  done to me Christ said and notice now they're getting rid of old people with
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.760]  the death panels and it's happening in Europe and now here and they're now
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.240]  staying kill babies up to age three will you guys give me the journal of
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.440]  pediatrics calls for killing babies up to age three print that to I should have
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.440]  done preparation for this I mean I did do preparation thinking about it
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:08.040]  yesterday and today and then I saw drudge report com with the headline 55
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:13.640]  million abortion since row and reminded me oh I wanted to do a show on abortion
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:19.480]  or at least been an hour or two on it on the anniversary and so we're going to
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.440]  discuss that and you know bring up these topics and these points but you can't
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:28.080]  deny human life's cheaper than ever and statistically people aren't rendering
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.960]  aid like they used to America and Europe were always known for rendering aid
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:36.600]  unlike Eastern culture that statistically does not render aid that's
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:44.200]  just a fact as much and Western virtue is evaporating very very quickly but I
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.600]  still run into doctors and lawyers and accountants and police and military
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:55.080]  especially military and farmers and ranchers and rodeo people and just so
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:59.800]  many people I know and like who are all about they're not good because they're
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.520]  they're hypocrite Pharisees on a high horse telling you how good they are
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.360]  they're good because they're good and they like being good and they feel good
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:14.840]  being good and they want to do what's honorable and it's almost scary how much
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:20.120]  I like being honorable now as I'm 40 years old next month and I've always been
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.000]  an honorable person but man now it is just dominates me and even when I know
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.120]  something's good I'm doing I try to figure out how to do it even better and
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:35.000]  how to be even more honest and even when something sensational I'll tend to dial
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.640]  it back like my reporters do because I don't want to go all the way and then I
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.320]  and I realize the enemy does that on purpose they they're always saying good
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.240]  people the conscience are bad and lying about us so that we do they know how we
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.720]  work so that we will look at ourselves and over analyze look we're in a war we

[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:33.560]  alex jones well the media today is saying that this is the 41st anniversary of
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:42.680]  Roe v. Wade but technically it was decided January 22nd 1973 so that would
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.480]  be tomorrow because on this Tuesday edition it's the 21st day of January
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:09:00.260]  2014 but it was argued December 13th 1971 it was examined October 11th 1972 they
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:07.520]  made one day look at this and it was decided January 22nd 1973 that's
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:13.800]  directly from the Supreme Court I have the ruling here in front of me but
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:19.720]  regardless we're talking about them looking at the evidence for one day
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:30.160]  October 11th 1972 they passed judgment and they decided January 22nd 1973 and
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.760]  of course it they didn't really decide anything they were told by the political
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.520]  class the Rockefeller Foundation that helped push this since the turn of the
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:44.720]  century the last century century before the 21st century simply amazing and I
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.880]  want to open the phones up for your stories of abortion one way or the
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.140]  other what is it like for folks that have had abortions and and thought it
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:57.100]  wasn't a human and believed the lies and then later had children those are the
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:04.540]  people that really get shook up that really get upset by what they've done
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:07.820]  and what they've been part of and I want to tell you something if you've had an
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:12.100]  abortion because you were told it was a blob and wasn't real and maybe you didn't
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:16.020]  the first trimester which I do think is probably obviously a lot less bad
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:20.940]  overall than when it's second or third I mean holy Toledo when that's you see
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:25.460]  those high-def scans the baby's sucking their thumbs playing spinning around when
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:31.540]  they're in the third trimester it's having dreams it is it is it is
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:34.500]  unbelievable to know what goes on and then you find out the type people that
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:39.340]  are into it and how they make all this money and the way they kill the babies
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.260]  putting them in water or throwing them in the toilet a lot of times they're
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.980]  unable to kill them before they get them out and people say oh let's not talk
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:49.180]  about this well it's going on and they want to ban people having signs up of
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:54.140]  dead babies on billboards and they want to ban high-def ultrasounds and letting
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:59.140]  people look at their babies for non-medical reasons because they don't
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:06.100]  want you to know and here's the good news you can pull these polls up there's a
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:10.460]  lot of polls out there but you can search and just that polls show abortion
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:17.940]  less popular than before and the numbers are around Roe v. Wade around 60%
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:23.780]  depending on the poll were pro-abortion believe the lies they made it a big cost
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:27.380]  celeb the new civil rights movement women got more freedom blacks got more
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:31.460]  freedom now kill babies more freedom and people kind of bought into it the last
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:34.780]  time I saw numbers there's a bunch of polls out there young people it's as
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:39.340]  high as 80 plus percent hate abortion know it's a fraud that's under 30s and
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:46.060]  then even with older folks it's now 60 to 70% or higher are against it and gallup
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:50.540]  shows similar numbers not you know not quite as strong but the point is is that
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:57.980]  the numbers are reversing in 2013 clinics are closing all over abortion
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:06.500]  drops an industry is now retrenching itself the press reports the national
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:11.380]  right to life Institute reports so we're gaining ground the problem is
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:15.060]  they're institutionalizing it making you pay for it with tax money Travis
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:24.420]  County takes money out of everyone's paycheck and it has all these new
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:28.860]  hospital district taxes you name it to make you pay for abortions they
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:32.660]  promoted the school so their answer to us resisting them is to double down but
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:38.620]  the good news is we're winning the hearts and minds but Roe v. Wade and you know
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.900]  even the woman that was part of Roe v. Wade you never see her on TV anymore
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:46.300]  very rarely she's been traveling the country for two decades saying that it's
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:52.020]  horrible it's wrong it's a fraud she was wrong what I don't like is Gloria Steinem
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:55.300]  and others wearing shirts saying I got an abortion they're back doing that and
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.540]  saying it's sexy saying it's the ultimate feminist action I've read these
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:04.020]  quotes and it really upsets you you know it's one thing if you say look I got
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:10.500]  raped or or I didn't the first trimester or I'm poor or yada yada yada they
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.540]  don't tell you that there are more people wanting to adopt kids every year in
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:16.460]  this country than there are abortions they don't they always say well nobody
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:20.140]  wants these black babies nobody wants these minority babies I mean I've been
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:24.060]  told that many times myself face-to-face by pro-abortion people on air and off
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:28.820]  air you've all heard it the truth is everywhere I go I mainly see white
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:33.020]  people taking care of mentally disabled Hispanic and black children because
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:37.300]  they're racist crackers that's why they have those you know special needs kids
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:40.580]  that are an absolute nightmare to deal with many cases because their love is
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:46.740]  so great they feel called upon to do it because whites are evil folks inherently
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:52.380]  okay of course I'm being sarcastic House committee passes bill to completely
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:56.940]  banned taxpayer funds abortions that's life news.com but if you go to info
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:14:01.540]  wars.com or drudgereport.com we have links to the 55 million abortions
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:09.740]  since row and you think about that you know I kept saying 51 million the last
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:13.780]  four or five years because I hadn't checked the latest numbers it's 55 million
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:21.540]  dead babies and then now what do you expect to come out of this remember this
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:26.260]  article from a year and a half ago and people didn't believe it February 28th
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:36.020]  2012. Bioethicist argue killing newborn babies should be allowed up to age three
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:42.900]  and that was in the Journal of Medical Ethics prestigious journal and when
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:46.260]  this first came out people couldn't believe it this already goes on in
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:51.780]  Europe and then they pulled the journal and then people said we were lying but
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:56.020]  then the journal no said no we we admit we it was published but we we've
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:59.300]  withdrawn it and then the one in Telegraph picked it up Fox News picked it
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:03.180]  up you know drudge report carried our article drudge went and you know I'm
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:06.740]  just keep giving praise where it's due and clicked on the journal and saw it was
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:10.980]  real and forced the media to cover it but for a week they said I was a liar and
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:15.460]  it wasn't real just like everything else they're not buying bullets by the
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:18.900]  billions they're not training with paper targets of women and children there's
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:22.740]  no plan to confiscate guns the army's not trained to take on the Tea Party even
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:25.260]  though now they admit all that's true there's no drones in American skies
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:29.180]  they're not using them on farmers Alex Jones is a liar now I'll admit it when
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:33.700]  we put that report out they came out and said there is no way Dr. Peter Singer at
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:42.460]  Princeton who is an icon of PETA they're really a transhumanist eugenicist group
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:48.380]  has said forever a baby is no more at value than a mackerel a mentally
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:56.020]  retarded person has no more value I think he said then a roach or something
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:00.580]  get to pull up the exact quote pull up Dr. Peter Singer children are like
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:05.500]  mackerel and then disabled children are like it's really sick old people are you
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:10.180]  know just get rid of them and it's like oh you're so liberal oh so trendy oh you
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:14.420]  are such a hard oh you're so good because you're funded by the Rockefellers
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:18.340]  and anti-human eugenicists you want to make us totally cold and say we're all
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:23.900]  animals and have no spirit no soul no free will and so you know divorce is okay
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.460]  even if it makes your kids tears their guts out makes them feel like they're
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:30.300]  dying because you know that's just a biological feeling so you go with your
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:34.220]  feeling to leave your wife or leave your husband and do what you want because you
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:37.420]  want to go out and party and you want to be able to do whatever you want and you
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:40.740]  want to be able to use the wife or the husband as a babysitter when you go out
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:45.660]  part you know on and on and on and on this worldly sick system and the church
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:52.020]  is endorsing all of it doctor death and the religion of genocide the cycle of
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:55.820]  peonka goes further warns of a hundred once a hundred percent of humans dead
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:01.740]  yeah that's one of our articles on NBC news we need to find the doctor Eric
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:06.700]  peonka yeah those are good quotes but but I want Dr. Peter Singer quotes there
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:14.060]  is Peter Singer since neither a newborn infant is nor fish it's yeah here's the
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:16.900]  quote they just blew it up for me so I can read it there's a clear crossover
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:21.500]  between the madcap words of ecology and bioethesis Princeton University's
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:25.540]  Peter Singer probably the world's most well-known bioethesis to advocates the
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:28.580]  right of parents be able to kill their own newborn babies well actually up to
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:32.460]  age three this journal just repeated what he says singer compares babies to
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:37.540]  mackerel writing since neither a newborn infant nor a fish is a person the
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:41.860]  wrongness of killing such things is not as great as the wrongness of killing a
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:46.420]  person and see that's the globalist sick lawyer argument they dumb you down they
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:50.660]  program you with the screen time the kids they wire the brains were their
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:55.620]  receptive biological androids in his own words and then as an adult you're not a
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:18:02.260]  human either and that's their weird Illuminati twisted Masonic worldview that
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:05.700]  if you're not conscious of what's going on and you're not aware of all this and
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:10.020]  I've been told this by globalists that have tried to co-op me I mean you wouldn't
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:13.300]  believe the contacts I get I mean I haven't said this yet but I've been
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:17.540]  invited as the keynote winner speaker and I've accepted at Oxford I have to pick
[01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:22.620]  the date in March now but they recommended it be a Saturday night and
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.380]  they're gonna have the faculty and people there I mean it's not just speaking at
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:30.780]  Oxford it's speaking the keynote addressing Oxford and that's something I
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:37.340]  could say on record folks I have been lately contacted a bunch by people at
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:43.020]  the highest levels and obviously if I don't go meet with them they will take
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:46.500]  it as a disrespect and I might something might happen to me I mean it's it's that
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:51.740]  how bad this stuff is at the level I met ladies and gentlemen undecided to meet
[01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:56.340]  with you because I know you're a serious man now of respect I'm here but this
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:01.460]  drug business I believe it's gonna be the end of us and we control the the
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:06.660]  church and the courts because yeah gambling and women it's just a vice
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:11.180]  people want to paraphrase Don Corley only but this drug business but I mean
[01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:16.060]  separately I'm never going to join with a new world order I will certainly meet
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:21.460]  with them though it's always interesting I met with a real member of the
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:26.740]  Illuminati about three years ago and it's just unbelievable and the only reason
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:31.740]  I'm given this information is I won't tell anybody that's the only reason but
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:33.900]  but that's what they always tell you they go look these people aren't human

[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:18.460]  so now that we've dehumanized for 41 years 55 million babies and help fund
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:24.180]  basically forced abortions worldwide with IMF and World Bank money well now
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:27.700]  that we see the economics of one of predatory actions and dumbing people
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:31.580]  down and reducing society and not creating economies that actually have
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:35.460]  sustainable real jobs but destroying sustainable economies by calling it
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:43.220]  sustainable our journey towards total implosion is going right along and then
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:47.980]  meanwhile humans aren't even needed now unless we decide we're needed and decide
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:54.420]  we want to build a world for humans kind of like you build a dog park for dogs
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:59.140]  or you build a human park you build a habitat for lions you build a habitat
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:05.420]  for hippopotamus we're having a habitat built for a technocracy that we're not
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:11.340]  in and this is in the globalist own words France and China of all places are
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:17.580]  leading the revolution to robotics to replace 99% of their workers and they're
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:22.020]  only a few years away from their prototype factories working without
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:28.860]  humans almost completely without humans again by design not some natural
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:34.500]  progression all the tech with backdoors built into it so that they can
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:39.220]  dehumanize track control and war game their incremental takeover to predict
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:42.860]  the future and predict everything we're going to do and to gauge how we're going
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:47.900]  to respond and have super quantum computers going after us we have to make
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:51.420]  the decision we don't want to go down that round we want quantum computers to
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:57.300]  build truly sustainable space-based ring cities in space and then blast off
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:02.060]  300-year missions with three four generations that are going to live in a
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:07.660]  high science-based system mining the asteroid belt and then blasting off to
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:13.420]  the nearest star systems man boom I would raise my kids for that mission have
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:17.020]  them ready if they wanted to do it to be part of that we should have ring cities
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:20.900]  built right now should have already launched 50 of them I mean I could go
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:25.980]  on and on the potential of what they've suppressed the adventure of colonization
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:30.420]  of space of colonization of the undersea we've got the resources we've got it all
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:34.460]  and said we put the resources into controlling and dumbing people down so
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:37.620]  when you say it's my right it's my abortion I've had a bunch of abortions
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:41.460]  and you wear a shirt and don't you know you dumb man don't tell me I'm talking
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:47.180]  about humans going to the next level I'm talking about valuing humans I'm
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:51.180]  talking about if you don't decide to bet on humanity and be a fan of humanity
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:57.060]  again the devil's advocate without Pacino great movie John Reeves tells me it's
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:27:00.220]  one of his favorite movies only kind of Reeves doesn't do interviews I've known
[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:03.220]  him well over the years talked to him a lot I haven't talked to him in a few years
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:06.780]  any to contact him again he's a big fan of the show the films in private he'll
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:10.100]  totally smart knows everything totally cool he won't talk to any media because
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:15.540]  he knows they're all idiots but but that's all a side issue in devil's
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:21.580]  advocate the devil says I'm a fan a man I want to empower you and that is pure
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:25.380]  bull the spirit of the devil whether you believe it's real or not the idea the
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:30.860]  the archetype of Satan wants to kill steal and destroy and suppress you it's
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:37.180]  God and God's creation in a life force that's regenerative and good beautiful

[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:08.540]  that is the shared experience of humanity to to to to hear music for the
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:12.740]  first time it's so beautiful or hear your child play music that they are doing
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:16.260]  on a keyboard that's impromptu that some of the best stuff you ever heard and
[01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:20.780]  to and you know to know that they have the genetics of top concert pianist and

[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:28.140]  to want goodness for people instead of going they're all weak and don't know
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:31.900]  the power we've got and we're going to control them and take them over because
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:35.740]  they tear you apart if you tried to help them the only way for you to achieve
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:42.700]  your true destiny is to realize that and break away from these people the dark
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:45.700]  side only wants to recruit those of us that are good because they know as
[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:50.300]  their evil comes in we will as a law of nature for every opposite for every
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:54.980]  action and you will have an equal and opposite reaction they know that those
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:59.620]  of us that don't sell out spiritually that don't join with the hot flame of
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:03.860]  evil that is very alluring because you're not tired you don't feel weak
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:06.940]  anymore you don't feel bad for people anymore you don't have a conscience
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:10.620]  anymore you can just feel the evil power and just join with it but then you
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:15.580]  realize that it dams you off from all the great understanding and all of the
[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:20.260]  love and all the compassion and all of the true art that you give up the
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:25.180]  deepness of your soul for the temporal power to be able to dominate on this planet
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:29.940]  you only have an intellect for things evil only an intellect to dominate only
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:36.900]  an intellect to to to to to commandeer good things and twist them they're blind
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.300]  they have no idea that the whole universe is at before us we're at a

[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:17.660]  halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:21.980]  federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:27.260]  iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:32.900]  record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously

[01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:40.660]  culture of death the dehumanization the saying that children up to age three
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:45.380]  aren't humans even healthy ones saying past laws that your embryos have to be
[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:49.620]  genetically screened and then killed if they have any problems because we're
[01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:53.420]  gonna have collectivized medicine and you can't have other people paying for
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:58.740]  your your child that's predisposed to cancer or your child that has a
[01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:04.620]  chromosomal problem or your child that has a cleft palate or your child that's
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:12.700]  missing a foot and this is the new eugenicist Spartan plan reborn 2,500
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:16.980]  years later this is the Nazi program this is the plan the Nazis were only
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:21.500]  picking up on the British US eugenics program and eugenics comes right out of
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:27.420]  the Greek set up by Galton in 1854 I mean this is all facts this is not my
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:31.900]  opinion you go see a movie like Superman man of steel or it's a planet where
[01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:36.220]  every baby is genetically engineered by the government for special tasks that's
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:39.740]  actually their plan they're telling you through movies like that why do you
[01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:43.140]  think that's in the original Superman literature why do you think that's in
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:46.740]  all the old literature because that was the culture and that was rock and roll
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:58.020]  cool that was rock and roll cool in 1900 1910 1920 1930 until 1945 when
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:02.420]  everything Hitler was doing came out he was just doing it quicker than other
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:05.540]  people were but he was doing it systematically against certain groups
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:09.300]  and he had a plan to take over the world and bring in Planned Parenthood and
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:12.180]  bring in forced abortion and bring in social engineering where you get
[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:16.500]  welfare as the state controls the economy if you abort your children if you
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:21.180]  go under social engineering to phase people out incrementally so they
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:26.820]  wouldn't resist how to buy off the ruling classes of the Asians and of the
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:33.740]  Latin Americans and of all these other groups and then to eliminate them to get
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:38.260]  rid of them and they were going to go through all of Russia and all of America
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:43.940]  and pick out the children with quote Aryan features Viking features is what
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:47.380]  Hitler liked best he thought the Germans were mongrels because of so many
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:51.820]  different influxes and invasions and was ashamed of the Germans and oh he loved
[01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:59.300]  the English who he thought were the a superior type of mongrel Viking as he
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:03.900]  described them it's all this craziness ladies and gentlemen and he said the
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:07.420]  Germans deserve to lose and that's why they lost and flood the subways kill
[01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:10.820]  hundreds of thousands of men women and children hiding in the subways because
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:14.540]  the Russians were using the subways to come into Berlin and they said kill
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:18.700]  everyone in the tunnels he said kill them all that's what's signing on to this
[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:24.260]  stuff will do for all of you and by the way you know my dad's professor the
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:27.660]  head of the botany department at UT who'd known him my dad when he was in
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:32.380]  high school as my dad scored the top 125 in the state and the top six and they
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:37.140]  took the top six aside and said we're carrying out a eugenics program and it's
[01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:41.340]  not like the Nazis they only targeted one group you know he was like I breed
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:44.580]  moths and plants and I can tell you how great it is and here's the top people to
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:49.420]  university and if you work for us we're creating a technocratic elite and you'll
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:52.940]  be part of the New World Order and we're gonna set up a worldwide scientific
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:58.020]  system of control how's that sound I mean that's what the top six people in
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:06.260]  Texas got a speech in 1967 when my dad went to college and New Spear two years
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:09.700]  before that I mean I remember when I was a kid driving through Austin we oh that's
[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:13.580]  Spear's house yeah we had dinner there a lot of times my dad was friends with him
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:17.140]  out of all the different people that went through my mom went to his classes
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:21.140]  he didn't like her he'd scream at her and you know say my wife knew him too
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:24.580]  at UT and clean your boy he knew my my mom too I think you liked her at the
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:28.980]  point was it was my wife told me the story you know clean your clean your
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:31.820]  trowels and stuff in the botany department perfectly and you know all
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:35.340]  this other stuff so I guess that's two generations my wife and my parents knew
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:39.620]  him and he wasn't even what you call a bad guy my point is he was par for the
[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:46.820]  course you don't get into by the way he was Jewish and for eugenics you don't
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:50.260]  get into these groups and these organizations unless you're part of
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:59.140]  this this is the religion and there are competing camps there are competing
[01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:05.060]  organizations in that structure they are debating it and fine-tuning it and
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:08.460]  and all the rest of it but make no mistake this is a technocracy that's
[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:12.740]  what the drones the robots the GMO all of it is a giant laboratory and the
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:16.980]  sooner people figure that out if we ever got the pro-life movement as we're
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:20.980]  starting to do by reaching out to them but don't start getting more of the
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:29.100]  pro-life movement on the head of life news the head of life news calm I want
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:33.220]  to get more of the mainline pro-life people on to say do you know about
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:36.660]  eugenics do you know about Margaret Sanger's plan to carry this out and they'll
[01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:41.100]  all go of course we do yes yes it's horrible but I want to tell them we
[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:47.060]  need to steer into exposing the larger ultra hitlerian agenda that is
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:57.860]  connected to all of this therein lies the answer to really countering this
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:05.940]  whole system therein lies the answer to people getting the big picture and
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:09.380]  pulling back and understanding it and again I didn't even know any that stuff
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:14.420]  about UT until my mom came in one day at the old office and it was on a Sunday
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:19.100]  we're going to a ballet recital for my daughters and she was meeting us there
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:26.420]  my wife was meeting me there with the kids and she watched about 30 minutes of
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:30.100]  she said that's not true it's not that bad my mom's real smart she's read you
[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:33.940]  know she has a degree in history and read literally probably a thousand history
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:37.020]  books and is obsessed with it more than a thousand history books probably reach
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:41.660]  two or three a week and she goes it's not that bad my dad said no actually it
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:45.140]  is a UT program I was brought into and just suddenly started reeling off the
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:49.180]  data and I even knew then that all the major universities were run by this it
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:54.500]  was just then hearing it from my dad confirming it and telling my mother for
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:57.380]  five minutes about it and I was hearing all this and then later I talked about
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:40:00.100]  on there and he said I didn't say you could talk about that I said you didn't
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:04.220]  say don't talk about it so now that you know the cat's out of the bag on that
[01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:08.140]  but it's not that big of a deal that's just standard operating procedure out
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:14.100]  there so do you see how it all ties in we can't attack abortion about arguing
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:18.140]  whether it's a human or not we can't attack abortion were they throwing what
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:21.260]  about rape and all these you know special case things okay how about the
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:25.100]  case of rape then you still can kill the baby does somebody raped you how about
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:28.180]  you give it up for adoption no one tells them there's groups out there that'll
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:32.900]  pay the woman money to have the baby I'm talking a middle-class living for
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:36.780]  three years and pay for everything to not murder their baby because they they
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:40.940]  they a they care about the baby B there's a line around the block for healthy
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:45.140]  babies for adoption they won't give you any of these numbers any of these facts
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:48.060]  they won't tell you where it came from who's behind it who did it where it's
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:53.300]  going how have you demonized dehumanized and demonized babies it then
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:41:01.020]  moves on to old people infertile people people with mental problems and I love
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:04.580]  how most the top eugenicists from England the US there's documentaries out on
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:07.660]  this the head of the Colesprings Harbor and others and then the next head of
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:10.980]  the Colesprings Harbor had to be institutionalized later for being
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:15.260]  totally mentally ill thinking they were God one of them the other one eating as
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:19.620]  you know what I mean these are people that are messes people that hate other
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:23.180]  humans and want to control them and want to kill them and have an instinct to hurt
[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:26.300]  them and have no empathy and think they're elitist because that they have
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:32.140]  that attitude they are cancerous ladies and gentlemen who believe that they're

[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:14.580]  up and on the air I want to hear what you have to say 41 years today after this
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:20.100]  abomination ruling and they actually debated it and heard it I have the
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:25.260]  report here for one day in the year between when the case came in and they
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:29.140]  finally debated it for a day and then later released it on this date
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:34.860]  everybody says this is the 41st anniversary the ruling says January 22
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:43.320]  it's January 21st whatever 41 years ago this week this happened and it's a big
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:50.580]  deal now let's get into this little jiblet of news first this is out of
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:57.300]  data beat secretly record your friends and enemies with handy pocket drone
[01:42:57.300 --> 01:43:01.620]  camera because camera phones weren't enough and they've now come out with
[01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:06.180]  these the Pentagon's been using these for a decade they now have an official
[01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:10.500]  Air Force announcements and videos and animations these big but basically like
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:16.060]  a predator flies over and releases up to a thousand micro drones in some cases
[01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:23.220]  millions of micro drones they call smart dust and then they fly down and and then
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:31.060]  they fly down and then basically surveil you and then they can even be fitted
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:37.820]  with firearms and kill you but see this is the total rollout of things that if
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:42.620]  we aren't moral are going to tear us apart and I want to shift gears to this
[01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:46.180]  incredible article I mentioned this yesterday because it happened at the
[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:50.620]  end of the show London Independent reported on this along with others but
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:54.620]  Amazon plans to ship customers packages before they even order them by
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:44:00.180]  watching your mouse cursor in live time the Amazon sending that data back by
[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:04.700]  what you click on what you've bought and other databases they believe with a
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:09.380]  hundred percent certainty they know what you're going to buy even days before you
[01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:14.940]  buy it and we'll have it packaged and ready to ship or in some cases shipping
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:19.300]  to you before it gets to you now I told you Google said this is the key they're
[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:24.060]  all racing for this you can literally predict the future in mass movements
[01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:28.140]  once everyone's programmed into smartphones tablets and computers
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:34.900]  everyone literally syncs with that in a brain human interface human brain
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:40.180]  computer interface now hooking you into the web then with all the Google
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:46.340]  glasses smartphones everything it knows years ago 93% weeks ahead where you're
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:50.220]  going to eat on a certain date what you're going to buy on a certain date
[01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:54.300]  what you're going to do on a certain date and they can also then artificially
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:59.580]  create stimuli to create fads and drive fads that will then have human adoption
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:05.060]  because we're designed to work together as individuals in a collective so this
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:11.340]  is the absolute heart of the end of free will and the heart of the takeover and
[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:16.100]  even though I live and survive and fund this operation off online sales and
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:23.380]  info or store.com and we don't track you with anything there it is absolutely
[01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:27.940]  essential and key for people to only shop online with mom and pops and Patriot
[01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:31.140]  and Liberty grips but that's even bad compared to shopping at brick and
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:34.020]  mortar and I know they treat you bad at brick and mortar in their police states
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:37.740]  as well but I'm telling you this is a scientific grip when you go and target
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:41.340]  are you going to Walmart or you go online to a big you know Amazon or whatever
[01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:45.180]  we sell stuff on Amazon I think as a protest we may pull off of Amazon people
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:49.500]  still sell our stuff on there but I'm really considering that because not
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:55.020]  even against Amazon it's that this AI stuff predicting the future is the end
[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:58.380]  of us the end of free will because once you can predict free will you can
[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:02.100]  manipulate it with a stimuli it's like having a heads up target display in an
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:06.740]  F-14 you know 20 years ago where you then lock on and the helmet guides with
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:12.180]  your eyes and then missiles on you fire we think of that as being high tech
[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:17.940]  that's 40 years old it was old 20 years ago now it's the brainwaves in the new
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:23.400]  aircraft but just like to control something and aim at something you've
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:26.300]  got to be able to see it when they can see what you're going to do and know
[01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:28.100]  what you're going to do and understand what you can do they can
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:33.740]  interstimuli and test moving you until the computer and the stimuli with the
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:37.380]  average unconscious person or semi-unconscious trance state person
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:41.060]  that they all the studies show the general public TV heads are in a near
[01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:51.540]  sleep state a mesmerized state that's why you take ambient that's why you take
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:55.700]  ambient it came out in major medical studies the last week we already knew
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:59.420]  this and and if you can stay up when you're on it or you drink when you're
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:03.540]  on it you are now a zombie and you have a dream that you go to Walmart with your
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:08.300]  gun it turned out this guy that shot a cop in Austin I said when it happened I
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:11.340]  said he's going to be on some type of psychotropic or ambient in a trance
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:14.820]  state he's going to be a shoot-em-up video game head roommate came out in
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:18.580]  Austin American statesman he was on ambient drinking beer he's done this
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:21.940]  before leaving for up to a day not knowing who he is he's found in his car
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:26.140]  later the guy was a shoot-em-up video game head with a gun he took it went
[01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:30.340]  into a trance state just like sergeant Bales who was on it and other drugs out
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:33.860]  of out in Afghanistan who killed 18 people spent hours burning the little
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:38.580]  children's bodies you name it killing them with knives shooting them you literally
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:42.020]  sleepwalk you know when I was a kid a few times my dad would hear me at 5 a.m.
[01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:45.500]  going I got to catch the bus I got to catch the bus and I was like you know
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:49.660]  10 years old 11 years old and and I would be in my underwear running down
[01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:53.180]  the stairs when he would catch me to from one time I was running out the front
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:57.860]  door he said he was chasing me I had my book bag in my underwear he was in his
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:01.620]  underwear chasing me 200 yards down the street towards the bus stop at like 5
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:08.420]  30 in the morning anyone you and remember I'm screaming Alex Alex wake up it's the
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:12.420]  same deal sleepwalking the general when we say the public is sleepwalking or
[01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:17.140]  or Bob's sleepwalks through life a lot of people are literally sleepwalking and
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:20.300]  I've talked to top psychologist top hypnotist we're gonna be getting some
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:24.180]  of them on the show soon these people that can make someone go manchurian
[01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:27.820]  candidate think they're gonna kill somebody on TV and it's real they find
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:33.220]  highly suggestive people like when a magician calls up 10 people before his
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:36.620]  show and then ask them questions then picks three of them he knows how to ask
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:40.300]  questions of who's suggestible who's already in a trance state and they'll
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:46.940]  tell you the public is more I've talked to old we had someone on the air old
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:50.940]  magicians people that we've been a magician for 40 years they say it's much
[01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:57.620]  easier now to do hypnotism because the public's already hypnotized folks and
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:01.340]  you give your little kids these iPads and iPods all of it they're already
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:07.940]  hypnotized they're already in a sleep state but you can't discredit the drug
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:11.900]  you got to put the guy in jail that killed the cop well that bring that dead
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:17.780]  cop back no realizing what this does in its own admissions it says it can cause
[01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:23.780]  sleep driving getting on a bed and sleep driving people also sleepwalk prepped
[01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:28.540]  eating food made phone calls or had sex while not fully awake oh yeah you give
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:31.620]  these to women it's over often these people do not remember these events the
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:35.260]  problem is called date rape folks if people can be dangerous to you and
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:39.500]  others if you find out that you have done any of these activities we are I
[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:42.740]  forget that guy's name that shot the cop that was on it I bet he's in jail now
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:46.140]  what do you want to bet he was convicted I never followed the case what do you
[01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:51.780]  want to bet he was convicted is already in jail instead of blaming the drug so
[01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:54.740]  that's what we're talking about here I'm going to take your calls when we come
[01:49:54.740 --> 01:49:58.380]  back all the way through the next hour on these subjects but this is a big deal
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:02.780]  this is the end of our civilization as we know it and for lack of a better term
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:06.940]  even if I was an atheist I would call what's coming the singularity the
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:12.180]  tribulation 10 kingdoms world government shipping total control people
[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:16.660]  losing their free will zombie population medically at the mainstream

[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:30.540]  to see everyone else's zombies and dehumanize and they have the Pentagon
[01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:37.260]  doing drills and training where they don't do mass killing of US citizens
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:40.980]  now in drills that upsets people when folks get video they go oh it's a zombie
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:44.980]  zombie drill where you practice shooting a thousand role players literally
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:50.420]  wearing Hank Williams junior shirts and John Deere tractor hats I'm not kidding

[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:20.860]  less than $30 yes it's fake TV this year about one in every 50 US homes will
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:24.900]  have a break in with burglars usually picking the easy target a dark house
[01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:29.580]  that looks like no one is home fake TV is a small electronic security device

[01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:18.820]  calls now this is a short second a lot of long segments are coming up in the
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:22.620]  next hour in response for the tone of news but I got to give the calls first
[01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:29.740]  bottom line when I tried to get into in the last hour really is that abortion and
[01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:36.420]  the abortion culture of death is about dehumanization and that goes without
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:40.500]  saying that we tend to lose the forest for the trees that this is a part of an
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:44.780]  overall dehumanization the robots replacing humans at Apple Foxcom
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:48.300]  factories the women being given forced abortions there and put on
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:52.940]  psychotropic drugs to make them zombies so they'll work 18 hours a day for $2 a
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:58.500]  day the globalists have set up a predatory system with all of the excess
[01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:04.580]  population they see and we are losing our humanity and I see all these cases of
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:09.140]  people on Xanax and BN you name it going into trans like states and killing
[01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:12.940]  people and it's never even an issue in the trial even though in that case in
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:16.860]  Austin I was mentioning at the Walmart that he was on Xanax which can also do
[01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:23.180]  the same thing and and other psychotropic type garbage right now again 41
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:27.660]  years today Roe v Wade this week what is your take on this in the culture of
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:32.940]  death or do you disagree with me do you think abortion is a necessary evil as
[01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:37.700]  many a liberal now says and how is it liberal to say a woman has a right to
[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:45.060]  kill her baby when it's another human because it is separate as a different
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:50.020]  heart different blood type in most cases that's why the feminists call it a
[01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:56.420]  parasite those are usually women that don't have kids my children are not
[01:55:56.420 --> 01:56:00.940]  parasites and Desmond Morris says that dogs are a parasite no they're not I
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:08.700]  choose to have them I love my dogs I choose to love I have a soul I'm not
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:13.420]  just an animal that doesn't have any direction I I can self-direct I I have
[01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:20.180]  dreams I can resonate towards the good that's consciousness I am conscious
[01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:26.900]  Ludwig von Beethoven was conscious Magellan that circumnavigated the world
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:30.820]  was conscious look at the art literature all of it how dare you say I'm not
[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:34.780]  conscious you know we're conscious you want me to be unconscious and seed the
[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:40.900]  universe to you and hand everything over to you who probably aren't conscious
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:45.100]  conscious of good and evil you're only conscious of evil let's go ahead and
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:49.420]  talk to Eric in California you're on the air go ahead
[01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:54.300]  hello Alex hey how's it going I'm doing all right well what's your point on
[01:56:54.300 --> 01:57:00.700]  abortion all right well two things one I'm an Iraq war vet who took the second
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:04.260]  tropics when they put me on I'm back in old form after I returned from my
[01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:10.740]  deployment to Fallujah and I ended up drinking on them once or twice and it
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:15.540]  made me trip out but what made me really get off of them was when I would try to
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:20.420]  sleep because I have a post-traumatic stress they would put me into this weird
[01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:25.060]  dream state like where I'd wake up and I'd feel like I was in hell it was very
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:30.900]  strange but after that and not really getting the help I needed from them it's
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:34.140]  kind of got off and haven't taken a sense that I never will yeah they try to get
[01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:36.580]  everybody on them because there's already artificial chemicals in the food
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:41.500]  water so people are unbalanced and then they put you on one you get worse they
[01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:44.580]  put you on two you get worse they put you on three you get worse they will
[01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:48.740]  institutionalize you if they can and you know some people they actually work for
[01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:53.860]  that I've talked to but statistically it's like playing Russian roulette didn't
[01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:57.180]  work for me and it gave me ambient and lexapro so I got right off with them
[01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:01.700]  though after about six months listen I have girlfriends over the years or I
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:05.780]  was married that would go on this stuff and after a few weeks it was a different
[01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:11.620]  person and I mean I just you know it again I'm not saying for everybody it
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:16.180]  couldn't help sometimes but they are toxic in and of themselves that is
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:22.820]  undebatable what's your take on abortion abortion well after I got out of
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:27.140]  the submarine core I met my wife and we started dating and within about the first
[01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:31.220]  three months I got her pregnant you know I want to hear this don't hang up back

[01:58:58.620 --> 01:59:04.660]  highest rates of diabetes autism and every other major disease it all comes

[02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:03.060]  sure she wanted to stay with me at the time so she ended up wanting to get in
[02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:08.660]  abortion and what did it for me was I was completely against it I was you know
[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:11.980]  all four you know raising this child and everything but I couldn't talk her out
[02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:17.580]  of that offered to do it myself after the pregnancy and eventually I ended up
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:22.180]  kind of caving and I went with her to go do it and I just remember being there
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:26.900]  and feeling how evil that place felt I mean it just made my skin crawl you got

[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:19.180]  the air hello Alex hey buddy first-time caller I had quite a thing happen to me
[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:27.740]  back in three days before Christmas in 2011 and I was given three dreams in a
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:34.780]  row the 22nd 23rd and 24th right before Christmas and the first two had to do
[02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:41.820]  with an abortion I made a girlfriend have 34 years before and the first dream
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:49.060]  that came the 22nd I'd relived that night when she was crying and arguing and
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:53.700]  we don't need to have this abortion and and I was screaming at her you lied to
[02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:56.860]  me that you said you couldn't get pregnant and we don't have time for a
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:04:02.260]  child right now and and it was just a horrible night but boy I really had my
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:07.140]  kahuna is going and I was really forcing it down her throat that this was what
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:14.260]  was going to happen when I woke up I was not a very happy camper the next
[02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:20.860]  morning at about three four o'clock in the morning the Lord put me in her place
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:29.540]  and let me know what I did to her how horrible I made her feel sir this is
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:33.540]  too powerful we got to come back I want you to start over okay start over tell

[02:08:16.860 --> 02:08:20.980]  is that the passing of greed the bitterness of men who fear the way of
[02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:26.700]  human progress the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they
[02:08:26.700 --> 02:08:31.860]  took from the people will return to the people and so long as men die liberty
[02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:41.700]  will never perish. The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones

[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:55.140]  abortion their view on it the culture of death that's really what this is and it
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:58.380]  extends down to the children now saying get rid of babies up to age three get
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:04.580]  rid of old people kill granny decide if somebody even lives if they don't serve
[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:08.900]  society like so many socialists have said over the years these are really
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:14.860]  authoritarians and it sounded like a Charles Dickens Christmas Carol or
[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:19.740]  Christmas story that John in Kansas was starting to get into three dreams he had
[02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:26.100]  about an abortion he was involved in decades later so start your story over
[02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:29.460]  sir you've got the floor to tell your story then we'll move on to Eric Eric
[02:09:29.460 --> 02:09:34.660]  Mark and many others that are patiently holding go ahead well she and I
[02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:40.780]  figured out she got pregnant because she ran a fireworks tent for several years
[02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:45.940]  and and that summer I happened to be staying with her and we were so busy
[02:09:45.940 --> 02:09:50.980]  the night before the 4th of July that we just stayed all night in the tent well
[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:57.540]  we didn't have any protection with us that night and things happened well so
[02:09:57.540 --> 02:10:03.740]  many months later we find out she's pregnant and she was all for an abortion
[02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:09.700]  until the night before the abortion was scheduled and that night was just awful
[02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:16.180]  Alex she was crying she was begging she was pleading and I just know you said
[02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:20.900]  you couldn't get pregnant we're not ready for a baby you are going through with
[02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:26.180]  this abortion and it was just a horrible night and I got to relive it 34
[02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:32.380]  years later the very next morning at about the approximately the same time
[02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:41.220]  three or four in the morning God put me into her body and into her mind and what
[02:10:41.220 --> 02:10:46.660]  I did to that woman by forcing her to have an abortion and not long after
[02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:52.660]  that she acquired a disease called endometriosis and she was never able to
[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:57.220]  have children I was about to say a lot of times abortions actually they double
[02:10:57.220 --> 02:11:00.980]  the chances of cervical and uterine cancer that's on record look it up folks
[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:06.260]  and it causes endometriosis in many of the cases and for those that don't know
[02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:10.420]  that's the stuff in the body that that causes the menstrual cycle to slough
[02:11:10.420 --> 02:11:15.700]  off the cells but then it starts eating their womb and other organs continue
[02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:20.220]  that's another gift they don't tell you at Planned Parenthood you get I think the
[02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:24.620]  number you can look this up is a 20 plus percent increase in endometriosis per
[02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:29.140]  abortion you get but folks don't believe me just check out cancer risk from
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:35.740]  abortion endometriosis please continue well I it was just when I woke up that
[02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:41.020]  morning I was just I felt so horrible because I'd never known what I'd really
[02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:47.620]  done to that woman and she was the woman of my dreams and I blew it and I never
[02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:53.900]  had as good a woman as that in my life again the third dream had nothing to do
[02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:58.500]  with the abortion it had to do with some close friends of mine but those two
[02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:03.580]  dreams themselves just set the tone for Christmas and I didn't have a very
[02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:09.500]  pleasant Christmas yeah I've had the worst Christmas in my life this last
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:13.220]  2013 into this year but you know that's because everybody's being challenged
[02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:16.500]  right now bad stuff's happening everywhere good stuff's happening as well
[02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:20.740]  but we're in a quickening phase a very important phase anything else you'd like
[02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:26.300]  to add with that testimony John just the abortion should never have been
[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:32.620]  legalized it it's awful God bless you brother it's dehumanization thank you
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:38.100]  yeah I mean I was never to super jerk but I'm a lot nicer than I was when I
[02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:44.460]  was 18 2025 and I think about how I was a jerk to my girlfriends compared to the
[02:12:44.460 --> 02:12:48.580]  way I act towards women now and the weird thing is women because everyone knows
[02:12:48.580 --> 02:12:54.300]  on average like being treated badly I mean it's been proven scientifically on
[02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:57.780]  average like that supposedly dominant when it really isn't and I'm not saying
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:04.500]  all women are like that but it's really screwed up society and you know in my
[02:13:04.500 --> 02:13:10.380]  cases and I'll just say this on air it would be girlfriends would then be mad
[02:13:10.380 --> 02:13:14.460]  at me after they had an abortion and I wouldn't even know they had an abortion
[02:13:14.460 --> 02:13:22.420]  they would get really mad and then they would go out and a couple times and get
[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:25.500]  an abortion and not see me for a month and later call them go let's date again
[02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:30.140]  but they'd still hate me after that and blame me for it which I guess I was
[02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:37.100]  responsible in some way obviously but God forgives us loving another woman is
[02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:44.900]  not a crime ladies and gentlemen you know loving a woman loving a person the
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:50.980]  whole issue here is that is that when we then dehumanize those babies and just
[02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:55.060]  you know say it's a parasite it's really feminist the greatest thing a woman
[02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:58.300]  can do is abort their baby and these are quotes I'm giving you that have come out
[02:13:58.300 --> 02:14:01.580]  of the mouths of these feminists just look it up I mean it's I've suppressed
[02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:05.740]  a lot of the stuff I've read because it's so sick and it's a sacrament of the
[02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:10.020]  Democratic Party in the eugenicist they love killing kids they love it it's a
[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:12.380]  sacrifice and you're always hearing about abortionists that are into the
[02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:16.940]  occult and are devil worshipers and keeping the babies bodies folks they're
[02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:21.900]  into this I mean you got to be into it let me tell you something doing real
[02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:24.820]  medical procedures and helping people even though it's incredibly stressful
[02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:28.180]  these professionals like doing it because they really like doing a good
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:32.940]  service medical procedures are grueling I've worked as a small animal vet large
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:38.020]  animal vet dental assistant I've talked to a lot of surgeons I've watched you
[02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:41.420]  know the medical channel I've seen this I mean these are professionals who
[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:49.700]  really are dedicated and I admire them but most abortionists are a lot of people
[02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:52.780]  get into it but leaving it they only do it for a year and quit and become pro
[02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:57.260]  life in fact biggest pro-life movement is a lot of former abortionist and people
[02:14:57.260 --> 02:15:01.700]  that were for it because it really gets to them that they discover it's not it's
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:08.060]  not fun and the horror stories of these abortuaries these are satanic temples of
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:12.460]  human sacrifice you're like oh really every culture sacrificed children there
[02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:17.740]  is a group in every culture a manifestation of evil that wants to
[02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:24.940]  gut children wants to chop up children slowly let's go ahead and talk to Eric
[02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:30.580]  in Pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead Alex how you doing today well I'm
[02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:35.020]  not doing too good talking about abortion but it's got to be done my take
[02:15:35.020 --> 02:15:39.940]  on abortion is I got three quick things I don't think it should be allowed
[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:44.940]  period except for in a rape case or within the first two weeks before any
[02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:50.380]  cells are formed before any pain anything can be harmed yeah I mean I'll be honest
[02:15:50.380 --> 02:15:52.820]  with you but see that's the creeping deal if somebody did it in the first
[02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:57.140]  month or two this you know that's God's creature it's gonna grow into a human it
[02:15:57.140 --> 02:16:00.740]  is the beginnings of a human but it's they they want to keep partial birth
[02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:05.420]  going nine months the baby could just be cut open and necessary and and given to
[02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:12.060]  adoption go ahead right I have to agree with you on that too I never understood
[02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:17.060]  that even your common was you know Democrats like death that surprises me
[02:16:17.060 --> 02:16:22.420]  why I don't they like guns that they like that so much you know it's like if we
[02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:27.540]  could just take out these liberals like how many take a liberal shooting day
[02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:34.420]  once by Cuomo I'll attack go just just just if we could all reach out at this
[02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:39.500]  point in our lives where we are in our country and just help each other and
[02:16:39.500 --> 02:16:44.420]  don't seclude ourselves in I mean we have to reach out with each other right
[02:16:44.420 --> 02:16:48.060]  now more than ever I agree you need to take a liberal out and a mainline
[02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:52.220]  Republican out shooting and waking them up and talking to them the last thing
[02:16:52.220 --> 02:16:56.020]  they want us doing is engaging each other we're gonna take the world back in
[02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:59.940]  little decisions and doing the right thing I mean I can't tell you how many
[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:02.780]  times you know I'll be on a road trip or doing something in a beautiful woman
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:06.220]  guys to hook up with me and I don't do it but you know because I'll care about
[02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:10.180]  my family and my wife and everybody but as a man it's hard to do the right thing
[02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:14.780]  but it feels good after doing the right thing and I'm not saying I'm perfect but
[02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:18.660]  you know just this attitude of anything goes well then now we're gonna kill our
[02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:30.580]  children 55 million of them right go ahead a lot of people that take these
[02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:36.940]  ambience in these psychotropic drugs I was a better Navy speck up guy for six
[02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:41.980]  years honorable discharge went to college afterwards got a bachelor's all that
[02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:47.380]  fine and dandy I tried taking ambience a few times and I'll be honest with you I
[02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:52.220]  think it will help some people but I would say for a lot of people we should
[02:17:52.220 --> 02:17:56.700]  be on these for example when I was taking it I think it'll bring out the real
[02:17:56.700 --> 02:18:02.660]  true personality and somebody for example when I took it I ended up my
[02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:07.060]  fiance was really mad at me because I ended up waking up at like two o'clock in
[02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:11.560]  the morning and I was given our two guinea pigs a haircut and she's like
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:14.860]  what in the hell are you doing and I said oh I was just giving the guinea
[02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:19.540]  pigs a haircut nothing I wasn't harming them just very strange it can do
[02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:22.980]  strange things to a lot of different people and that's what I think doctors
[02:18:22.980 --> 02:18:27.060]  need to really watch with some people that are unstable there's a lot of people
[02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:30.380]  out there that do really need help and we need to really help them if we can
[02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:35.260]  whatever we can do I know it's a confusing world but thank you that's all
[02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:38.540]  I had thank you for thank you so much sir God bless you yeah no I talked to
[02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:42.020]  people that you know need to sleep when they get on an airplane or whatever and
[02:18:42.020 --> 02:18:45.460]  they take that and I'll hear about these stories people I know were you know
[02:18:45.460 --> 02:18:49.540]  they'll be trying to walk into the bulkhead door or whatever and get in you
[02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:53.060]  know they think it's the bathroom I mean it's just I mean you're sleepwalking and
[02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:57.740]  thank God I haven't had done any sleepwalking so I was about 14 the last
[02:18:57.740 --> 02:19:02.300]  time I was once I was at my grandmother's house they had a big 42 game 42 game
[02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:06.260]  you know Domino's like five tables going in there because you know Baptists can't
[02:19:06.260 --> 02:19:12.580]  play cards but they can play Domino's and bet of course that's alright it's not
[02:19:12.580 --> 02:19:16.060]  cards it's not evil you know you had to tell a Baptist my grandma's really a
[02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:18.940]  Methodist a lot of families Baptist you know they don't say hi to each other
[02:19:18.940 --> 02:19:21.500]  when they're passing each other at the liquor store you know they call bottle
[02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:27.540]  openers in Texas they call them Baptist church keys anyways the whole point is
[02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:32.180]  the last time I was sleepwalking I'll tell this story they were going to about
[02:19:32.180 --> 02:19:36.820]  11 o'clock at night and I was tired I've been working on the ranch all day had
[02:19:36.820 --> 02:19:40.940]  like a 13 14 hour day I was staying there and there and there was a little
[02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:44.980]  room off the side I was asleep in they woke me up and I walked in up to the
[02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:51.300]  corner in front of everybody turned into a potted plant and peed in it and they
[02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:55.220]  woke me up and realized that but I mean that's that's my sleepwalking story well

[02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:11.340]  you can look it up sleepwalking is more common in young people because their
[02:24:11.340 --> 02:24:17.420]  brains are wiring they're more active also the most common form of sleepwalking
[02:24:17.420 --> 02:24:20.380]  is walking thing you're walking to the bathroom because you got to go to the
[02:24:20.380 --> 02:24:23.140]  bathroom and not being fully awake now and I guess that's what happened the
[02:24:23.140 --> 02:24:27.140]  last time I sleepwalked when I was 14 years old and of course it turned into a
[02:24:27.140 --> 02:24:30.420]  big joke you know they're at the farmhouse when I was living with my
[02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:34.300]  grandmother off and on several years keep me out of trouble in Dallas my dad
[02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:39.060]  would send me down there for six months at a pop to work me there on the farm
[02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:43.300]  the ranch then I worked for large animal vet got that guy worked hard sometimes
[02:24:43.300 --> 02:24:47.940]  it'd be like 16 hours a day until like a 65 year old vet I want to go home man
[02:24:47.940 --> 02:24:52.180]  it's 8 o'clock at night you be like if you don't like it quit this is the job
[02:24:52.180 --> 02:24:58.500]  we got calls we go to him then we go back and take care of his cows 9 o'clock at
[02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:02.780]  night I did quit finally I said I'm not doing this anymore I'd work for him off
[02:25:02.780 --> 02:25:06.780]  and on twice but anyways that was what built America was that type of work
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:11.100]  ethic and I'm telling you folks this country is in deep trouble everybody
[02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:14.660]  knows that we're having a discussion about our nation's greatest sin we're
[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:18.500]  going right back to your calls here and that is abortion I think that is
[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:24.140]  undoubtedly when the hedge of protection began to be lowered on this country but
[02:25:24.140 --> 02:25:28.380]  Chris Jordan was telling the story about his grandmother who had no mental
[02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:32.260]  problems at hip surgery and they put her on Ambien that's kind of become the
[02:25:32.260 --> 02:25:37.380]  side issue here how many people kill folks on it and sleepwalk on it now the
[02:25:37.380 --> 02:25:41.020]  sleeping aid and he was telling us some stories about that so briefly tell
[02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:45.460]  folks that story well it was my mom a few years ago actually about was your mom
[02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:48.580]  misunderstood things in your grandmother she's she's had numerous
[02:25:48.580 --> 02:25:55.780]  surgeries she's literally the bionic woman fake knee to artificial and yeah
[02:25:55.780 --> 02:26:03.660]  when she was when she when she was in the hospital talking about having her
[02:26:03.660 --> 02:26:08.580]  hip done they actually put her on Ambien and we had to tell them to take
[02:26:08.580 --> 02:26:12.900]  her off of it because she was on the third floor of the hospital seeing little
[02:26:12.900 --> 02:26:17.580]  people outside of her window people talking to her from inside the TV at
[02:26:17.580 --> 02:26:24.380]  night in one point she actually the day after her surgery was in the elevator at
[02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:30.140]  3 a.m. saying that she'd heard the fire marshal on the announcement intercom
[02:26:30.140 --> 02:26:33.820]  saying there was a fire in the building and when somebody gets on this stuff and
[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:39.140]  goes and shoots a cop they they go to jail instead of stopping these psychotropics
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:44.100]  and other drugs that are clearly on the inserts say they do this but the
[02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:47.780]  pharmaceutical companies have no liability and now they're trying to put
[02:26:47.780 --> 02:26:51.460]  kids on it incredible all right let's go back to your phone calls Eric and then
[02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:57.860]  we're going to go to Mark and then Rodney and Monica and David your stories of
[02:26:57.860 --> 02:27:04.900]  abortion or your take on abortion 41 years later Roe v. Wade today 55 million
[02:27:04.900 --> 02:27:11.020]  chopped up children Eric you're on the air from Connecticut thanks for calling
[02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:17.260]  Alex first time long time how you doing I'm doing all right brother up so what's
[02:27:17.260 --> 02:27:23.740]  your take on this you know I have always kind of supported abortion but you know
[02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:28.900]  I've been changing my views a lot lately and I kind of believe that man's
[02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:34.460]  greatest gift is love and God's greatest gift is life and to destroy life the
[02:27:34.460 --> 02:27:41.220]  destruction of life is just there's a point to me you know how to gift and
[02:27:41.220 --> 02:27:46.660]  just smash it on the ground like that it's just it's terrible well sure I mean
[02:27:46.660 --> 02:27:50.820]  and if it went on some that'd be one issue bad enough it's the embracing and
[02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:54.580]  saying it's good well now it's good to kill grandma these and see if we debate
[02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:58.780]  it from that angle we win the debate if we just say you women don't have a right
[02:27:58.780 --> 02:28:02.460]  to do that and you're blah blah blah are you men when it's usually men making
[02:28:02.460 --> 02:28:08.980]  women have abortions then we don't have the moral high ground go ahead yeah and
[02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:13.380]  I just believe the point in context if you look at the universe and it is in
[02:28:13.380 --> 02:28:18.180]  the you know infinite universe there's no other life except on this planet I
[02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:24.020]  think people might look at life a little differently exactly that's like spoiled
[02:28:24.020 --> 02:28:28.020]  people you know you spoil kids you spoil your husband spoil your wife you know it
[02:28:28.020 --> 02:28:30.620]  always ends badly because they don't appreciate anything we are just
[02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:35.100]  wallowing in life and beauty and art and incredible things going we're bored
[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:39.260]  there's nothing fun I want to do evil stuff because it's deviant yeah let's
[02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:43.540]  have abortions let's have devil worship I don't appreciate it well you'll really
[02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:46.860]  appreciate life if somebody took you up in a spaceship and threw you out there
[02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:53.140]  into the vacuum exactly and I just think people should revere life all life
[02:28:53.140 --> 02:28:58.940]  more um you know people are just like you said they're so complacent with the
[02:28:58.940 --> 02:29:03.180]  way things are and I just don't you know I I don't know a board should be
[02:29:03.180 --> 02:29:08.620]  legalized but if it's legal and now with socialized medicine you know you're
[02:29:08.620 --> 02:29:14.420]  gonna be forced abortion forced medicated you know as you often say you
[02:29:14.420 --> 02:29:17.980]  know it could very well be the end of humanity just let this kind of
[02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:22.340]  destruction continue very well said I really appreciate your call you know I
[02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:25.540]  don't go hunting as I like to kill animals and I don't go hunting a lot now
[02:29:25.540 --> 02:29:29.380]  but my son's young it's that time biologically he likes to do it but we
[02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:32.620]  use whatever we hunt whether it's an alligator it's overpopulated eating
[02:29:32.620 --> 02:29:36.380]  people's dogs we turn it into boots we turn into things whether it's a deer we
[02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:40.820]  eat the meat turning into chili we hunt because it's a natural biological thing
[02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:45.940]  for us but we hunt prey animals and we we do it because it's a natural human
[02:29:45.940 --> 02:29:50.100]  expression not because we want to kill an animal in a cage in some cage time
[02:29:50.100 --> 02:29:58.860]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:00.060 --> 02:30:05.540]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and
[02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:10.740]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[02:30:10.740 --> 02:30:14.820]  the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and
[02:30:14.820 --> 02:30:19.460]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[02:30:19.460 --> 02:30:24.860]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:30.580]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ

[02:32:07.980 --> 02:32:12.020]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with
[02:32:12.020 --> 02:32:15.500]  the direction this country was headed and the charlottes willing to sell us out
[02:32:15.500 --> 02:32:19.780]  for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by patriots for

[02:33:31.420 --> 02:33:37.180]  I'm gonna do this again tomorrow for at least an hour and throughout the week to
[02:33:37.180 --> 02:33:41.180]  talk about abortion and have a larger debate about it because most losers of
[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:45.180]  the show are against it you hear a caller like that who was for it before
[02:33:45.180 --> 02:33:50.260]  because the way it was presented but now is against it and that's because there's
[02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:54.460]  good people out there that have been lied to and deceived and we can't hate
[02:33:54.460 --> 02:33:58.220]  them and get in their face and call them evil most of them don't know what
[02:33:58.220 --> 02:34:02.180]  they're doing is bad that's what Christ said forgive them father they know not
[02:34:02.180 --> 02:34:06.180]  what they do now the people run on the show they know exactly what they're
[02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:10.580]  doing and see I could argue well you got raped okay it's first trimester you
[02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:15.300]  know do what you got to do the problem is that it leads to third trimester the
[02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:19.420]  day the baby's gonna be born kill it kill up to age three kill the old people
[02:34:19.420 --> 02:34:24.580]  certify the embryos government run it just that's where it goes there's a
[02:34:24.580 --> 02:34:28.380]  reason we don't have warrantless spying there's a reason we don't have
[02:34:28.380 --> 02:34:33.500]  neighborhood spy networks though now we do because it always goes bad it is bad
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:38.820]  the road to hell isn't paved by good intentions the road to hell is paved by
[02:34:38.820 --> 02:34:43.540]  evil technocrats and psychological manipulators getting good people to go
[02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:52.980]  out and be the road crew to lay the road to perdition the road to hell is paved
[02:34:52.980 --> 02:34:58.500]  by mind-controlled goody-two-shoes that mean well with good intentions so I
[02:34:58.500 --> 02:35:04.420]  guess it's true but the guy that owns the company that's doing the road is pure
[02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:08.100]  evil and by the way that's why it's so important to financially support this
[02:35:08.100 --> 02:35:13.860]  broadcast so we can be strong going into the trials and tribulations so that I
[02:35:13.860 --> 02:35:17.540]  can not spend all my time worrying about getting money to pay for the
[02:35:17.540 --> 02:35:20.220]  equipment and the expansion and what we're trying to do in the face of the
[02:35:20.220 --> 02:35:25.020]  globalist we're just given it 110% and so thank you for all your support we're

[02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:21.180]  of things that we've really researched what is the most powerful supplements
[02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:25.660]  as well in six months we've only rolled out three or four things to be two years
[02:39:25.660 --> 02:39:29.100]  to get a hold of this copy this coffee properly directly from the farmers
[02:39:29.100 --> 02:39:33.220]  because you know we will sell no wine until it's time we really try to do
[02:39:33.220 --> 02:39:36.420]  unto others as we'd have done unto us and bring you real products I mean I
[02:39:36.420 --> 02:39:43.420]  could I could sell you pills and stuff you know B vitamins with vitamin K that
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:48.100]  is not of the highest quality for $2 a bottle and I could sell it for $30 a
[02:39:48.100 --> 02:39:52.340]  bottle and I for six months cannot find a proper source of purely organic super
[02:39:52.340 --> 02:39:56.500]  high quality and the stuff cost me like $10 a bottle what I think I can get I'm
[02:39:56.500 --> 02:39:59.260]  just to give you an example we look at all the quote competitors we study at
[02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:03.460]  all and it's like I almost cannot even bring you products because the industry
[02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:07.660]  is so bad I mean it's I mean I want to have 20 products right now funder
[02:40:07.660 --> 02:40:12.980]  operation help people help get the word out win-win and I just can't even do it
[02:40:12.980 --> 02:40:17.700]  we're gonna come out with a vitamin D with a vitamin K from the folks we've
[02:40:17.700 --> 02:40:21.820]  talked to that'll supercharge immune system health you name it and just to
[02:40:21.820 --> 02:40:26.260]  get them both together in a truly organic form is is hard I mean we got to
[02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:32.540]  certify the stuff from Germany you know that they end up making the gelatin out
[02:40:32.540 --> 02:40:36.780]  of and do not use animal gelatin and I might just go with the cow gelatin or
[02:40:36.780 --> 02:40:39.700]  whatever and just say you know here it is you know it's because we can't be
[02:40:39.700 --> 02:40:43.540]  totally neurotic about it I just think I'll be honest about it it's just we're
[02:40:43.540 --> 02:40:49.180]  trying to give me the best products info worse life calm or 8882533139 and I
[02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:52.220]  didn't even plug stuff last hour that's why I'm double plugging right now it's
[02:40:52.220 --> 02:40:56.460]  midair refueling that's how I find my operation okay let's let's hurry now I
[02:40:56.460 --> 02:41:00.460]  apologize for not going to callers like I should mark Rodney Chris Monica David
[02:41:00.460 --> 02:41:06.300]  we're going to all of you right now mark in Oregon go ahead hey Alex hey brother
[02:41:06.300 --> 02:41:10.860]  thanks for holding go ahead thank you brother Alex you know it's certainly
[02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:17.180]  true and well documented that the most preferred sacrifice of those who worship
[02:41:17.180 --> 02:41:23.100]  the devil those who worship Satan is a newborn baby of course the partial birth
[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:28.980]  abortion fulfills that that role so to speak and I agree with you that in the
[02:41:28.980 --> 02:41:35.460]  mind of most abortionists if not all of them that it is a satanic sacrifice I
[02:41:35.460 --> 02:41:39.580]  think it's really important that we look at this from God's point of view and
[02:41:39.580 --> 02:41:46.540]  and in his word in the holy Bible he states very specifically very plainly
[02:41:46.540 --> 02:41:54.260]  that putting our children into the fires of Moloch which is also inclusive of
[02:41:54.260 --> 02:42:00.420]  abortion is just another form of it is an abomination to him and when a nation
[02:42:00.420 --> 02:42:07.860]  commits an abomination legalizing an abomination as happened in 1973 with
[02:42:07.860 --> 02:42:13.700]  Roe versus Wade I think that is the inception at that date 41 years ago of
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:20.020]  God's judgment coming upon this country the form of which has taken away the
[02:42:20.020 --> 02:42:25.260]  protection from evil which he blessed this country with and we have seen the
[02:42:25.260 --> 02:42:30.140]  fruits of abortion manifested in the deterioration of everything that's good
[02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:34.020]  in our country that's right it was the giant battering ram that opened the
[02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:37.940]  city gates and we've been overrun by evil and every form of wickedness since
[02:42:37.940 --> 02:42:42.380]  then and now we're really going to fall and everyone that dehumanize those
[02:42:42.380 --> 02:42:46.780]  children and didn't repent everyone who loves and dances in the blood of the
[02:42:46.780 --> 02:42:51.740]  innocent they are going to be brought to judgment and it won't be very long
[02:42:51.740 --> 02:42:56.580]  either Alex and I I just want to thank you so much for bringing this topic up
[02:42:56.580 --> 02:43:01.620]  it's such a proficient time today on the 41st anniversary of the beginning of
[02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:07.100]  judgment on America and God bless you and yours and even their loved ones and
[02:43:07.100 --> 02:43:13.380]  I just admire you so much oh please don't come on man I'm up here fighting for
[02:43:13.380 --> 02:43:17.580]  the unborn if they're not safe I'm not safe my kids aren't safe my children I
[02:43:17.580 --> 02:43:22.180]  mean everybody thanks me folks and that's nice and I want to thank you but
[02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:27.060]  well this is not something we should be thanked for we should really be angry at
[02:43:27.060 --> 02:43:30.340]  those that aren't fighting the evil because it's going to take over we're
[02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:33.380]  all in danger it's like if I had a little boat and I was two miles from
[02:43:33.380 --> 02:43:36.460]  shore three miles from shore it was freezing water and my family was in the
[02:43:36.460 --> 02:43:39.580]  boat because I could you know swim into the shore even if it was pretty cold
[02:43:39.580 --> 02:43:43.220]  maybe but I knew my kids weren't going to make it and I was in a boat with 20
[02:43:43.220 --> 02:43:46.180]  people and I was bailing and people are looking at me going thank you for bailing
[02:43:46.180 --> 02:43:49.660]  I'd be like you know and they're bailing too thank you Alex for bailing I'm like
[02:43:49.660 --> 02:43:54.980]  why are you thanking me for bailing we're going to go into icy below zero
[02:43:54.980 --> 02:43:59.380]  water salt water can go below zero before it freezes we're going to die in a
[02:43:59.380 --> 02:44:02.580]  matter of minutes if we go into that water everybody bail like your life
[02:44:02.580 --> 02:44:08.540]  depends on it because it does we need people bailing ladies and gentlemen but
[02:44:08.540 --> 02:44:14.060]  while we also pull for the shore trying to be moral good people I mean I cannot
[02:44:14.060 --> 02:44:19.380]  express to you how it's hit me to be a moral person and and again they tell
[02:44:19.380 --> 02:44:22.860]  you moral don't go play cards with your buddies or moral don't drink a beer
[02:44:22.860 --> 02:44:27.020]  that's all fake church stuff so they can make you feel bad about little stuff
[02:44:27.020 --> 02:44:31.380]  while they're promoting the government not fighting evil not getting people
[02:44:31.380 --> 02:44:35.420]  energized pushing the system while they're consciously in bed with the
[02:44:35.420 --> 02:44:39.020]  state consciously not telling their mega churches to go fight abortion oh
[02:44:39.020 --> 02:44:42.940]  that's political not telling their man you know don't don't upset people they're
[02:44:42.940 --> 02:44:47.460]  conscious devils in most these big churches and talk about how they're a
[02:44:47.460 --> 02:44:52.500]  good man and their wife's a good woman and their examples to everyone and they'll
[02:44:52.500 --> 02:44:57.340]  do tough love with your family member oh you know your wife's drinking and won't
[02:44:57.340 --> 02:45:03.420]  quit divorce her it's of the Lord they're a bunch of devilish people that
[02:45:03.420 --> 02:45:06.500]  just want to be mean to everybody and do whatever they want telling you the
[02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:10.900]  church is where you find the devil in this country now the big churches they
[02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:16.060]  may want to throw up Rodney in Texas you're on the air go ahead
[02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:22.380]  off hey buddy yeah yeah my wife I've been married for 20 years this this July but
[02:45:22.380 --> 02:45:26.580]  my wife over 30 years ago had a abortion I didn't know about it till we were
[02:45:26.580 --> 02:45:30.540]  discussing it won't even not long ago and I can see that she was really
[02:45:30.540 --> 02:45:34.180]  disturbed by that and the only thing that I could think to say at the time
[02:45:34.180 --> 02:45:37.980]  because I was shocked to be honest with you because I've known her for 20 years
[02:45:37.980 --> 02:45:42.100]  and she never mentioned we talked about abortion many times but don't think to
[02:45:42.100 --> 02:45:45.940]  say was that I'm sorry that that you weren't supportive and that you weren't
[02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:49.700]  consoled and that no one was there for you because you know as she explained it
[02:45:49.700 --> 02:45:53.900]  to me that she was young kids doing school and she was scared to death and
[02:45:53.900 --> 02:45:57.460]  her and her boyfriend at the time wouldn't support her and you know her
[02:45:57.460 --> 02:46:02.140]  family was gonna think so you know it's uh you know women like in those
[02:46:02.140 --> 02:46:07.140]  positions need need support I mean if you're a man enough to you know to
[02:46:07.140 --> 02:46:10.740]  appropriate a child then you should be man enough to stand up and stand by that
[02:46:10.740 --> 02:46:15.700]  woman and exactly I'm gonna try to keep my two daughters away from men and it's
[02:46:15.700 --> 02:46:18.700]  always the aggressive thug men that go after young girls first when they're
[02:46:18.700 --> 02:46:23.060]  like 14 15 or even younger and that's criminal but but the point is I'm gonna
[02:46:23.060 --> 02:46:26.420]  try to keep them away from men and boys but if they ever were to get pregnant I
[02:46:26.420 --> 02:46:30.340]  mean we won't it'll be well that's not good but it doesn't matter this is a
[02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:33.940]  blessing this is gonna be like more children that this is if this is a
[02:46:33.940 --> 02:46:37.620]  wondrous thing even if the kids are poor if they have love they have
[02:46:37.620 --> 02:46:45.780]  everything I have back injury had a spinal injury about five years ago and
[02:46:45.780 --> 02:46:49.940]  they put me on ambient and I took that ambient for a couple of nights but like
[02:46:49.940 --> 02:46:54.140]  the second night that I took that ambient I had a I had a just most horrific
[02:46:54.140 --> 02:46:58.940]  dream where I was fighting believe or not I was fighting the devil and if the
[02:46:58.940 --> 02:47:03.780]  only way you can understand the fear is actually having to experience fighting
[02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:08.220]  another thing that you know is trying to kill you and the only way the only way
[02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:12.700]  to survive is to kill him and that's what I was experiencing I was like well
[02:47:12.700 --> 02:47:18.780]  the Bible says pharmacia opens the soul up to demons and that's why so many
[02:47:18.780 --> 02:47:24.500]  people you know who end up getting on this stuff marijuana you name it whether
[02:47:24.500 --> 02:47:28.060]  you believe in demons or not whatever that archetype is coming and it's there
[02:47:28.060 --> 02:47:31.620]  and it's it's not a good thing and if people say well it's whatever you have
[02:47:31.620 --> 02:47:36.060]  with you is going to happen it's true in studies that taking hallucinogens pure
[02:47:36.060 --> 02:47:41.020]  lsd mushrooms can boost IQ and it's been in a cured depression you name it but
[02:47:41.020 --> 02:47:44.700]  that's if you're already you know a centered person it doesn't it's not that
[02:47:44.700 --> 02:47:48.700]  actually makes you smarter on paper I believe it opens you up to what was
[02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:54.540]  already there you see what I'm saying right and one more thing to Alex Daniel
[02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:57.740]  to you know these prophecies are just this falling one after another just
[02:47:57.740 --> 02:48:03.740]  coming so fast now but I'd like to point out that Daniel 243 specifies the end
[02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:09.300]  because of the great and terrible beast but it specifies the the mixing of
[02:48:09.300 --> 02:48:14.180]  whoever they are and the woman's feet it says that they whoever they are I mean
[02:48:14.180 --> 02:48:19.620]  not men are gonna mix their seed with the woman but it will not mix properly
[02:48:19.620 --> 02:48:25.220]  because it's like a mix in the potter's clay with iron and Daniel 243 talks
[02:48:25.220 --> 02:48:30.660]  about as you saw iron mixed with chromatic clay or ceramic clay they will
[02:48:30.660 --> 02:48:34.700]  mingle with the seed of men but they will not adhere to one another just as
[02:48:34.700 --> 02:48:38.820]  iron does not mix with clay I like they're taking three men now and making a
[02:48:38.820 --> 02:48:43.460]  baby for gay couples going we want a man baby and put three men together you
[02:48:43.460 --> 02:48:48.060]  imagine what that's gonna do the type of mutations the type of weirdness you know
[02:48:48.060 --> 02:48:53.980]  will it have a soul or two women and a man all forms of abomination all forms
[02:48:53.980 --> 02:48:59.180]  you go abomination shmomination look at what it comes out they can have a sheep
[02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:01.980]  that's a hundred percent the same genetics as the sheep before it but
[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:05.020]  something's wrong with it they can't ever make the clones tick they don't have
[02:49:05.020 --> 02:49:08.980]  vigor because they don't have the spark they don't have the soul I appreciate
[02:49:08.980 --> 02:49:14.940]  your call let's go to Monica in Ohio Monica welcome hi hi how are you I'm
[02:49:14.940 --> 02:49:18.860]  all right go ahead what I'm calling about the abortion thing because I
[02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:24.940]  actually experienced one of those and now I'm a mother so my personal
[02:49:24.940 --> 02:49:31.340]  experience with that is you know like 10 years 12 years later you have a male
[02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:35.900]  scar that sits on your heart I mean it morally pains you more than anything I
[02:49:35.900 --> 02:49:39.860]  think the procedure itself is pretty simple but they never warn you about
[02:49:39.860 --> 02:49:45.260]  the scars it leaves internally and that's when I look at my daughter I was
[02:49:45.260 --> 02:49:49.660]  blessed I was lucky I didn't have complications but sometimes she'll say
[02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:54.260]  to me how she wants a sister or brother and it makes me think back to that so I
[02:49:54.260 --> 02:49:57.980]  would have that moral scar that follows me and about every October I have a
[02:49:57.980 --> 02:50:03.100]  couple days where I just sit and wallow and and think back to those times
[02:50:03.100 --> 02:50:08.020]  because that's when my baby would have been born that I had an abortion was
[02:50:08.020 --> 02:50:14.900]  it's kind of sad oh it's definitely sad and but at least now you feel bad and
[02:50:14.900 --> 02:50:19.420]  you repent hardening your heart and buying into it and worshiping Gloria
[02:50:19.420 --> 02:50:24.620]  Steinem that's when you better watch out yeah and you know my cousin now she's
[02:50:24.620 --> 02:50:29.740]  20 she just found out she was pregnant and she asked my opinion on it and I
[02:50:29.740 --> 02:50:34.180]  looked at her and I said look I know you're young and it's overwhelming and
[02:50:34.180 --> 02:50:38.740]  I don't think anybody's ever planning for that and I gave her my personal
[02:50:38.740 --> 02:50:42.620]  experience with that and I said so when didn't I could tell you that will lead
[02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:46.780]  you right is to shut up all these facts and these statistics and what
[02:50:46.780 --> 02:50:51.260]  everybody's opinion is and follow your heart because your heart always tells
[02:50:51.260 --> 02:50:56.020]  you where to go and your heart tells you exactly very well said ma'am thank you

[02:54:04.980 --> 02:54:11.540]  just fact and I try to live up to it my family's genealogy on both sides and
[02:54:11.540 --> 02:54:19.460]  goes back quite a bit like everybody else's does and my family on both sides
[02:54:19.460 --> 02:54:26.900]  was always involved founding things and I have a real instinct to want to build
[02:54:26.900 --> 02:54:34.220]  space-based colonies that go for the long march to star systems and build
[02:54:34.220 --> 02:54:40.940]  just like my ancestors got on the Mayflower after leaving the Netherlands
[02:54:40.940 --> 02:54:47.820]  to try to find religious freedom and what was that 1601 1602 I forget one of
[02:54:47.820 --> 02:54:52.420]  them Mayflower arrived and they weren't perfect people by any stretch the
[02:54:52.420 --> 02:54:57.660]  imagination but they wanted to try to carve something out and do something
[02:54:57.660 --> 02:55:03.660]  new and get away from the oppressive system and I think of children like
[02:55:03.660 --> 02:55:10.900]  that the 55 million killed in the last 41 years Roe v. Wade anniversary today of
[02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:15.300]  just all the destinies that were destroyed and stuffed out all the
[02:55:15.300 --> 02:55:21.060]  opportunities all the amazing things and people say all most of them are poor
[02:55:21.060 --> 02:55:25.660]  babies they'll wreck society just that attitude that their trash makes them
[02:55:25.660 --> 02:55:32.220]  trash and all the people that helped me when I was young and did so many things
[02:55:32.220 --> 02:55:36.420]  for me I was a prodigal son I mean I wasn't an evil person but I mean you
[02:55:36.420 --> 02:55:41.180]  know hundreds of girlfriends constantly fighting you were looking for a fight you
[02:55:41.180 --> 02:55:48.460]  came to the right place you know you name it just and and my family stayed
[02:55:48.460 --> 02:55:51.740]  there by me helped me through it all and I made it through those trials and
[02:55:51.740 --> 02:55:55.780]  tribulations and then the prodigal son comes home and his other brother has been
[02:55:55.780 --> 02:55:58.820]  totally good says why are you throwing the biggest party ever and slaughtering
[02:55:58.820 --> 02:56:03.940]  the the best calf and everything well how much do I love you
[02:56:03.940 --> 02:56:13.460]  we didn't lose him and I think about all the good people we're losing here and
[02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:18.540]  and just the spiritual idea that they're crap makes us all crap you understand
[02:56:18.540 --> 02:56:25.220]  that it we're over folks we're done there of course they got death camps we're
[02:56:25.220 --> 02:56:28.620]  already killed 55 million kids in death camps of course they're putting poison
[02:56:28.620 --> 02:56:32.260]  in the food and water a government that wants to kill babies will kill
[02:56:32.260 --> 02:56:36.700]  everybody you don't play games with this stuff you don't make deals with this

[02:56:57.300 --> 02:57:03.780]  David in North Carolina you're on the air go ahead Alex hey and thank you so
[02:57:03.780 --> 02:57:09.860]  much that you do for us and I have an abortion story I was I was 25 years ago
[02:57:09.860 --> 02:57:16.180]  I was a junior in college and the time of my life and I met the woman that I
[02:57:16.180 --> 02:57:20.740]  knew I was gonna marry and ask her to marry me and we were at we were students
[02:57:20.740 --> 02:57:23.500]  at Liberty University which is the epicenter of them you know the
[02:57:23.500 --> 02:57:30.300]  Christian conservative mindset and the majority and all that stuff so you know
[02:57:30.300 --> 02:57:37.220]  you kind of try to not have sex before marriage and you know it's what's
[02:57:37.220 --> 02:57:40.380]  expected of you and all that but it didn't turn out that way she ended up
[02:57:40.380 --> 02:57:45.300]  pregnant I remember sitting in the parking lot of school at her car she's
[02:57:45.300 --> 02:57:50.340]  crying and I'm crying and just you know faced with the shame and all that and
[02:57:50.340 --> 02:57:55.620]  they've worked since you came up and and it was we're talking seriously about
[02:57:55.620 --> 02:58:01.860]  it because you can just sweep all this under the rug and but man we decided
[02:58:01.860 --> 02:58:12.420]  not to do it and I quit school married her and and get an emotional I my
[02:58:12.420 --> 02:58:17.060]  daughter was the absolute joy in my life and I had to become a man real
[02:58:17.060 --> 02:58:21.700]  quick I had to get a job because exactly they don't want you to have kids
[02:58:21.700 --> 02:58:25.380]  because it makes your brain turn on and makes you grow up they want to keep you
[02:58:25.380 --> 02:58:28.820]  as a rest of development is that what happened but so some of you now looking

[03:00:14.420 --> 03:00:18.660]  welcome back Chris the broadcast go ahead and make your points sir on
[03:00:18.660 --> 03:00:25.500]  abortion Roe v Wade 41 years later today well Alex abortion can include a
[03:00:25.500 --> 03:00:30.180]  miscarriage but it's more properly turned aboard a site when it's willfully
[03:00:30.180 --> 03:00:36.540]  induced abortion whether it's surgery or herbs or are you 486 and when it comes
[03:00:36.540 --> 03:00:41.180]  to ultrasound as they're currently being employed it can be dangerous there's a
[03:00:41.180 --> 03:00:46.420]  site I encourage you to check out called ultrasound-autism.org covers
[03:00:46.420 --> 03:00:50.860]  the low birth weight autism and other effects no there's a undoubtedly the
[03:00:50.860 --> 03:00:54.340]  sound waves are doing stuff the kids but it's a cost-benefit analysis as you can
[03:00:54.340 --> 03:00:58.620]  find out so much you know about the babies the wrong way now they got to a
[03:00:58.620 --> 03:01:02.700]  cesarean but they can do that with x-rays I tend to agree with you I think
[03:01:02.700 --> 03:01:06.220]  they should probably go x-rays better you know rather than ultrasound but they're
[03:01:06.220 --> 03:01:10.700]  getting some better systems in well knowing that the sound can't kill and
[03:01:10.700 --> 03:01:14.900]  sound can heal bones and tissue it's just a matter of frequency and amplitude
[03:01:14.900 --> 03:01:19.380]  maybe ultrasound could be made safe no no because I've done research on it before
[03:01:19.380 --> 03:01:22.500]  I allowed my children to be ultrasound you do not do it in the first four months
[03:01:22.500 --> 03:01:26.300]  they didn't used to they try to make you do it at two months now and that is
[03:01:26.300 --> 03:01:32.100]  baloney I've done the research on that yeah you do not want them to ultrasound a
[03:01:32.100 --> 03:01:36.620]  baby in the first trimester but while we're even the second one you know
[03:01:36.620 --> 03:01:40.260]  multiple second trimester ultrasound exposure of girls down here yeah I got a
[03:01:40.260 --> 03:01:42.660]  job we're gonna do this again tomorrow Chris I apologize I'm trying to get to
[03:01:42.660 --> 03:01:48.740]  everybody now Alex in Illinois go ahead your points hi yeah I have my own
[03:01:48.740 --> 03:01:52.340]  abortion story that I was on hold for but it seems to reflect what everybody
[03:01:52.340 --> 03:01:56.580]  else saying but I wanted to ask you do you think that what's going on with young
[03:01:56.580 --> 03:02:00.660]  people nowadays is just another form of abortion how you just destroy their
[03:02:00.660 --> 03:02:04.620]  life that's right in fact I was thinking that earlier never said it we abort
[03:02:04.620 --> 03:02:08.460]  their minds with all the drugs the Ritalin the Prozac the Adderall we
[03:02:08.460 --> 03:02:13.180]  abort the culture there if they can't kill them they're gonna try to kill their
[03:02:13.180 --> 03:02:18.740]  mind they're gonna try to soft kill them and that's exactly what's going on one
[03:02:18.740 --> 03:02:23.900]  more point though yes I'm on a different on a different note I called it
[03:02:23.900 --> 03:02:27.700]  couple months ago regarding the police they build up and you asked for a
[03:02:27.700 --> 03:02:32.860]  picture regarding the military trucks from Oshkosh and I sent that to you
[03:02:32.860 --> 03:02:37.580]  today under the subject mill trucks one word you said it to show tips and
[03:02:37.580 --> 03:02:43.900]  info wars.com yeah MILTRUX and it has probably a couple thousand trucks on
[03:02:43.900 --> 03:02:52.380]  there. MILTRUX is the subject one. Yeah MILTRUX also sent it to your
[03:02:52.380 --> 03:02:55.020]  right. Alright I'll try to get something to do something on it thank you so much
[03:02:55.020 --> 03:02:58.500]  sir. Janine I'm in quick sorry I'm having a hurry Phil in Florida you're on the
[03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:04.220]  air. Hey I just want to say I was went to medical school and I thought I
[03:03:04.220 --> 03:03:09.020]  wanted to be a pathologist and then they kept sending you know board and
[03:03:09.020 --> 03:03:13.300]  fetuses down it got to the point where the sections I would put in would be
[03:03:13.300 --> 03:03:16.940]  like hand prints and foot prints I had to leave and I switched over to family
[03:03:16.940 --> 03:03:23.780]  medicine from that so it was I just couldn't take it you know and it was the
[03:03:23.780 --> 03:03:29.620]  whole thing personified the culture of death. Yeah I've seen a deer that was
[03:03:29.620 --> 03:03:35.460]  pregnant and just seeing a baby deer in utero makes you get upset or I've seen
[03:03:35.460 --> 03:03:39.300]  baby fish in a fish and you don't like it I mean you're not supposed to like to
[03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:45.300]  see dead babies and and and it just it's unbelievable I mean I know doctors
[03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:48.180]  that have lost babies and surgeries and you know they go home and cry because
[03:03:48.180 --> 03:03:51.460]  they're humans even though they you know how to harden their heart to do their
[03:03:51.460 --> 03:03:56.180]  work it's just what were the people that were doing abortions like that you
[03:03:56.180 --> 03:04:01.060]  were around met when they're making jokes about it and stuff. No because I was
[03:04:01.060 --> 03:04:04.940]  usually in there doing the gross anatomy by myself you know it's just you're
[03:04:04.940 --> 03:04:09.660]  only gross like two days a week and they would send them down from the from the
[03:04:09.660 --> 03:04:14.460]  GYN clinics and stuff they'd send them in because you in Connecticut where I
[03:04:14.460 --> 03:04:18.620]  was at at the time the law was that the foot had to be shorter than a certain
[03:04:18.620 --> 03:04:23.580]  amount or else that could prosecute the gynecologist and I believe me I would
[03:04:23.580 --> 03:04:29.940]  try to measure them as close as I could but they were legal abortions
[03:04:29.940 --> 03:04:35.340]  unfortunately but I had to get out of there. I hear you brother God bless you
[03:04:35.340 --> 03:04:41.020]  sorry to Robert Charlie John Phil we just got to that caller we're gonna come
