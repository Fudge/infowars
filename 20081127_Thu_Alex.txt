[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Lose weight and feel great, uncomfortable with credit cards or PayPal, that's okay.
[00:05.000 --> 00:08.000]  Call us for our address and send a check or money order.
[00:08.000 --> 00:12.000]  The phone number is 928-308-0408.
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.000]  Again, 928-308-0408.
[00:16.000 --> 00:19.000]  Once again, thank you from GetTheT.com.
[00:19.000 --> 00:28.000]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  It is Wednesday, the 22nd day of October 2008.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  We're gonna be live here for the next four hours.
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  Coming up later in the broadcast, we're scheduled to have Willie Nelson on with us.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  Then Naomi Wolfe, dealing with martial law in the United States,
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  and her book, The End of America, and then Lindsay Williams.
[01:09.000 --> 01:12.000]  He said, what, two months ago on this radio show,
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  three months ago, told Dr. Stan Monty, fellow Genesis Talk Show host,
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  behind the scenes three months ago, even a month before he went public,
[01:19.000 --> 01:26.000]  that oil prices were going to drop down to about $55 a barrel in the next four to five months.
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  And it turns out he was right about that.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  So amazing information from him.
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  But the top story today is we have Joe Biden, Colin Powell,
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  another former Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, and many others.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  The German president, the French president, the British prime minister,
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  all coming out and saying there's gonna be a terror attack in the near future.
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  Now, Albright's saying it's gonna be a terror attack.
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  Biden's talking about some type of challenge coming up in late January.
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  Powell's saying on the 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, they're even naming dates.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  They won't say what the crisis is.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  Some are saying it's economic.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  But foreign world leaders are saying it's going to be terrorist.
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.000]  This is a big deal.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  We have these individuals talking like this.
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  So I wanted to play a clip of Madeleine Albright on national television from CNN.
[02:20.000 --> 02:21.000]  Here it is.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  I want to ask you what you thought of what Joe Biden said yesterday
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  in terms of this idea that now Senator Obama, if he becomes president,
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  will be tested by an international crisis within the first six months.
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.000]  John McCain certainly picked up on that. Let's listen to what he said yesterday.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  If Senator Obama is elected, Senator Biden said,
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  we will have an international crisis to test America's new president.
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  We don't want a president who invites testing from the world at a time when our economy is in crisis
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  and Americans are already fighting in two wars.
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  Oh, no, sitting there with Senator McCain thought about this.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  Thomas, what did you think about what Senator Biden said?
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.000]  Well, I think it's just a statement of fact, frankly.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  And in my book, I talk about the fact that there are a lot of big issues out there,
[03:08.000 --> 03:18.000]  but that also something unexpected, you always have to be prepared for that.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.000]  All right, folks.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  So there you have it.
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  I want to specifically go over Colin Powell's statements on Meet the Press.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  Colin Powell warns of coming crisis we don't even know about right now.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  A story about Steve Watson and InfoWars.net.
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  Colin Powell has made a bizarre comment that echoed the recent declaration
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  by Democratic VP candidate Joe Biden that there will be an international crisis
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  early in the Barack Obama presidency that will test the new president
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.000]  by forcing him to make unpopular decisions.
[03:48.000 --> 03:49.000]  What will those be?
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  Speaking on Meet the Press a few days ago, Powell officially endorsed Obama
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  and also made the following cryptic statement.
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  And I quote, the problems will always be there and there's going to be a crisis
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  which will come along on the 21st, 22nd of January.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  I mean, he's being so specific with this, even naming dates.
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  Let me finish the quote.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  The problems will always be there and there's going to be a crisis
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  which will come along on the 21st, 22nd of January
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  that we don't even know about right now.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  You don't know about it, Powell, but you're listing the dates.
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  So I think that the president has to start to do is to start using the power
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  of the Oval Office and the power of his personality to convince the American people
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  and convince the world that America is solid,
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  that America is going to move forward,
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  that we are going to fix our problems,
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  that we're going to meet our overseas obligations.
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000]  Now, that's into the clip up on InfoWars.net in this article in 235,
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  two minutes, 35 seconds into it if you want to go watch that.
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  And later we're going to be playing that on air.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  Now, that suggests that it's going to be an economic crisis.
[04:58.000 --> 05:05.000]  Most of the others are implying that it's going to be a military-slash-terrorist crisis.
[05:05.000 --> 05:06.000]  So we'll see what happens.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  One commenter in the story said,
[05:09.000 --> 05:13.000]  Powell was saying the U.S. will default on its debts on the 21st, 22nd.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  And I agree with the person posting.
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.000]  That is what it sounds like.
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  The problems will always be there.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  And then he went on to say it'll be the 21st or 22nd of January.
[05:23.000 --> 05:30.000]  So we'll come back and cover this vital question when we get back.
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  that we're desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being unknowingly cooked
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  in gradually increasingly hot water.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  We'll snap out of it.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.000]  We now have a deadline.
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.000]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press
[05:58.000 --> 06:02.000]  and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident
[06:02.000 --> 06:06.000]  would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[06:06.000 --> 06:08.000]  While I take the general at his word,
[06:08.000 --> 06:12.000]  my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[06:12.000 --> 06:17.000]  Contact eFoodsDirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[06:17.000 --> 06:22.000]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[06:22.000 --> 06:29.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  9-11 was an inside job.
[06:37.000 --> 06:38.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  Do the American people know that 9-11 was the stage?
[06:43.000 --> 06:48.000]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.F.R.?
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  a global awakening has taken place.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  An inside job?
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  How dare you?
[07:06.000 --> 07:12.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[07:21.000 --> 07:24.000]  Please rise and download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  Phase one of the insiders' plan for a one-world government
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as saviour.
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[07:55.000 --> 08:00.000]  Phase one is a one-world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  Go to www.foodshortagesusa.com for the details.
[08:09.000 --> 08:15.000]  That's www.foodshortagesusa.com to learn how to prepare for the unthinkable.

[08:25.000 --> 08:35.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[08:35.000 --> 08:36.000]  Big Brother.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  Mainstream media.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  Government cover-ups.
[08:40.000 --> 08:41.000]  You want answers?
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  Well, so does he.
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:47.000 --> 09:13.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got Naomi Wolfe coming up in about 55 minutes from now.
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  She's written the best-selling book, The End of America.
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  And she now sounds just like this talk show host, very prominent in the progressive liberal community.
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  She's coming out talking about the plans for martial law in the United States.
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  And don't think that if John McCain or Barack Obama get elected, this will stop.
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  They are literally controlled by the military industrial complex, and she's going to be on.
[09:41.000 --> 09:49.000]  Talking about that today, in fact, she's valiantly explaining that we're under basically military control by the big offshore banks.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  And so that's coming up in about an hour.
[09:52.000 --> 09:59.000]  And then Lindsay Williams, who worked as an executive at some of the largest oil companies in the U.S. on their boards,
[09:59.000 --> 10:07.000]  he told us three months ago the banks were going to lower the price of fuel, of oil down to $60.
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  People laughed at him, but he was right.
[10:09.000 --> 10:10.000]  It happened.
[10:10.000 --> 10:11.000]  He was right behind that.
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  He'll be joining us in the fourth hour today.
[10:14.000 --> 10:24.000]  But without further ado, for the rest of the hour, I am extremely honored to be joined by my favorite country and western singer
[10:24.000 --> 10:31.000]  and one of my favorite movie stars as well, but really who he is is my favorite humanitarian, a person who is so down to earth
[10:31.000 --> 10:37.000]  and so decent involved in so many great causes that I share and that many others share.
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  Willie Nelson, and Willie Nelson joins us from Texas.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  Willie, thank you for coming on today.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  My pleasure. Good to be here.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.000]  I'm a little bit late.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  I was apologized for that, but it's good to be with you.
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  How are you doing?
[10:52.000 --> 10:53.000]  Willie, don't worry.
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.000]  I only had three heart attacks.
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  Well, I got hung up a little bit.
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.000]  You know how that goes.
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.000]  Sir, are you kidding?
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  I'm not one-tenth as busy as you, and I'm constantly forgetting interviews or getting the time zone wrong.
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  This is our fourth interview, and you've always made it, and that's just amazing.
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.000]  Willie, there is so much to talk about, so much going on that is developing.
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.000]  I mean, I've got a big list of questions here that I want to go over with you.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  But just out of the gates, how are you doing?
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  Oh, I'm doing good.
[11:28.000 --> 11:39.000]  You know, I've got some ideas and plans that I think maybe you and your listeners could help me with, too.
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  So as we move along today, I'd like to talk about some of that.
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.000]  Well, I want to get into the bailout, and I want to talk about the election and the wars and how we're still in Iraq,
[11:50.000 --> 11:56.000]  and I want to talk about how Farm Aid went bigger than ever this year with Neil Young and others.
[11:56.000 --> 12:03.000]  But let's go ahead now and talk about some of the things and some of the solutions that you've been coming up with.
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  Let's talk about that first today, Willie.
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.000]  Yeah, well, okay.
[12:07.000 --> 12:13.000]  I'm going to start out with the $700 billion that we gave somebody.
[12:13.000 --> 12:24.000]  I'm not sure who it was, but whoever has it, and I have written a letter as President of Farm Aid to whoever controls that money,
[12:24.000 --> 12:34.000]  that we would like to have $1 billion of that $700, and that would leave $699 for whatever they had planned.
[12:34.000 --> 12:44.000]  But $1 billion is, I think, all we'll need to turn the economy around if we start out taking care of our family farmers.
[12:44.000 --> 12:54.000]  But 10 million farmers back on the land making a living out there raising food and fuel now that we can raise soybeans, ethanol,
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  whatever they can grow out there we can use for both food and fuel.
[12:59.000 --> 13:11.000]  And that $1 billion, I think, would go a long way about changing our negative attitudes that we have and the confidence in ourselves
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  and in our country right now.
[13:13.000 --> 13:22.000]  I think if we invested, stopped all the foreclosure period and then invested that $1 billion back with our family farmers,
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  I think that we would begin to turn it around.
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  Well, Willie, I mean, you know of what you speak here.
[13:30.000 --> 13:37.000]  You have been studying the family farm and fighting for the family farm, not just in the United States but worldwide for, I know,
[13:37.000 --> 13:47.000]  more than three decades, and you are uniquely suited to speak on this because you were born on a small family farm with a blacksmith shop
[13:47.000 --> 13:54.000]  with your grandfather and grandmother and family in north central Texas during the Depression.
[13:54.000 --> 14:01.000]  And in some of your songs and a lot of your writings, you've documented the fact that the big central banks are not our friends
[14:01.000 --> 14:08.000]  and that we have to get back to local community, true sustainability, and you have really put your money where your mouth is,
[14:08.000 --> 14:17.000]  your time where your mouth is and just done so much raising hundreds of millions of dollars through farm aid and other things you're doing
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  for the family farm.
[14:19.000 --> 14:30.000]  So can you speak from your unique perspective growing up, living this life before you became the world-renowned country music singer?
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  Well, thank you.
[14:32.000 --> 14:41.000]  And also, I believe that, you know, we could talk, you know, the rest of our lives about how we got here because I think we know
[14:41.000 --> 14:50.000]  and we can put names and faces and places on most of the reasons, but I think if we just say, okay, here we are, let's go forward
[14:50.000 --> 14:58.000]  and then start thinking positive about everything, and that's the first step in turning it around.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  Well, I'll tell you what's positive.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  I talked to multiple members of Congress.
[15:02.000 --> 15:10.000]  They got thousand to one phone calls against the banker takeover bill, which is really five trillion dollars.
[15:10.000 --> 15:20.000]  And so the good news is the American people are not buying in to the banker propaganda, and so they may now be ready to hear some real solutions.
[15:20.000 --> 15:28.000]  With that one billion dollars, literal seed money to get the family farm that's nearing extinction jump started.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  What are some of the ideas that you have, Willie, to do that?
[15:32.000 --> 15:40.000]  Well, first of all, we put 10 million, we stopped the foreclosures on the farms and also the houses because what has happened?
[15:40.000 --> 15:49.000]  It's been a domino effect back when we had about eight or 10 million family farmers on the land.
[15:49.000 --> 15:59.000]  We were pretty good off economically because the agriculture is the bottom rung on the economic ladder, and so everybody was doing fine.
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  That was back at the end of the war.
[16:01.000 --> 16:09.000]  And then it was decided that those eight million family farmers out there, most of them Democrats, were just a little bit too much to handle politically.
[16:09.000 --> 16:24.000]  So they decided, and up until then, they were offering all our raw producers in this country a 100% parity, which is that they would pay for the cost and production of whatever the producers had.
[16:24.000 --> 16:32.000]  Whether it was a farm, a steel, coal, whatever it was, they would pay 100% or parity, and that was during the war.
[16:32.000 --> 16:42.000]  When the war was over, they stopped that process and decided, okay, we'll drop that to a 60% or 70% sliding scale.
[16:42.000 --> 16:47.000]  That way, they took two million farmers off the land immediately.
[16:47.000 --> 17:03.000]  Well, there's no doubt that the policies in the last 50 years have completely debased and decimated the family farm and ranch.
[17:03.000 --> 17:21.000]  I mean, I have lived in it as well, not to the extent you have, and just seen the destruction of the family farms and the rise of big agribusiness, which is now cramming all this GMO food down our throats and NAFTA and GATT hasn't just destroyed the family farm and ranch here in the U.S.
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  It's also hurt Mexico.
[17:23.000 --> 17:41.000]  So we know these policies are bad, and we know they're predatory, and we know that you and many others have come up with solutions, and if people go to www.willingelson.com, you have put a lot of different documents, research, articles up there explaining this to people and showing folks the history.
[17:41.000 --> 17:55.000]  So I want to challenge folks to go to www.willingelson.com and check out that material, and you also have a lot of information up on the Peace Institute on a host of issues tying into this, getting local control, building back up our communities.
[17:55.000 --> 18:07.000]  Can you imagine, Willie, if they gave the five trillion, and they've already doled out over two trillion of that, two foreign banks, and then they're cutting off the currency, the liquidity to the main street and family farm.
[18:07.000 --> 18:15.000]  By design, I have their documents, they want everything to foreclose and implode, and they can come back with all the money they've amassed and consolidate.
[18:15.000 --> 18:25.000]  So I'm trying to be positive here, but to stop what's happening, we've got to educate the public about who the real enemy is here, who the real fox in the henhouse is.
[18:25.000 --> 18:40.000]  That's right, and it's like Obama said, he said, you know, let's put out the fire now, we'll figure out who started it later, and that's pretty much what we have to do, we have to stop the fire, we'll have to stop the bleeding.
[18:40.000 --> 18:51.000]  And I still think the best way to do that is from the ground up, go back to our family farmer, he's the one that started taking care of us in the beginning, so let's let him do it again.
[18:51.000 --> 19:01.000]  Well, I want to talk about biodiesel because I've really studied the issue, a lot of my family works as petroleum geologist and farmers and also in refinery, so I'm somewhat educated on it.
[19:01.000 --> 19:15.000]  And I know that it was speculation and dollar devaluation that drove up oil, they tried to blame it on some of the farmers having crossed the crop turn into ethanol, which I'm for to a certain extent, but they also tried to tie that into biodiesel.
[19:15.000 --> 19:27.000]  Those are two separate things, I mean biodiesel, which you're an expert in, so I'd like you to speak to it, that's using waste products that just basically get burned or thrown in the landfill or dump down the drain.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  Can you explain the difference between the two?
[19:30.000 --> 19:50.000]  Well, the key words here are local sustainable agriculture. If you raise it over here and you consume it next door, then you save all the money that it costs for bringing in all your food, all the fuel it costs to bring it in.
[19:50.000 --> 20:09.000]  If you look at your breakfast in the morning, most everything on that plate came from 1500 miles away. So if you started it out with local sustainable.
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  We may have lost Willie's cell phone. Willie, are you there?
[20:11.000 --> 20:16.000]  No, I'm still here. I just found it like Christmas down there, our ice cream truck.
[20:16.000 --> 20:30.000]  You're a musician. You were listening to that curious tune. Stay there, Willie. We're going to go to break. We're going to come back and let you finish up with true sustainability, not the globalist counterfeit of that.
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  Santa, Christmas Eve and you haven't left yet?
[20:34.000 --> 20:50.000]  No, I can't find my keys. Here's the perfect gift. Our patented find one find all keyfinder or FOFA XD for short. Once a FOFA keyfinder is attached to each of those easy to lose things, it can find and be found by all the rest.
[20:50.000 --> 20:56.000]  Use your wallet to find your keys, your keys to find the remote control or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone.
[20:56.000 --> 21:06.000]  FOFA goes through walls, cushions and laundry baskets up to 30 feet and projects a loud 90 plus decibel beep. And new for Christmas, there's even a FOFA just for eyeglasses.
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  Where did I put my glasses, Mrs. Claus? Oh, here they are.
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.000]  Luckily Rudolph's nose isn't the only thing that flashes.
[21:14.000 --> 21:29.000]  Order your FOFA today with batteries included along with a 30 day money back guarantee. Call 866-245-8670. That's 866-245-8670 or buy online at find one find all dot com. Again, that's find one find all dot com.
[21:29.000 --> 21:43.000]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power? If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear. Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[21:43.000 --> 21:53.000]  These emergency backup systems provide life saving electrical power when you need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity for free.
[21:53.000 --> 22:01.000]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers and even keep food from spoiling.
[22:01.000 --> 22:12.000]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again. When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[22:12.000 --> 22:29.000]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today. That's mysolarbackup.com today or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[22:29.000 --> 22:36.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.000]  bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[22:45.000 --> 22:52.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[22:52.000 --> 22:59.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[23:03.000 --> 23:10.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  warnings and war games, the shadow government and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[23:22.000 --> 23:29.000]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[23:29.000 --> 23:36.000]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty? What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[23:36.000 --> 23:41.000]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[23:41.000 --> 23:46.000]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.
[23:46.000 --> 23:54.000]  Getseeds.net is offering an amazing special on 100 different varieties of heirloom vegetable seeds with a complete range of crops.

[24:29.000 --> 24:55.000]  Music playing
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  What beautiful poetry and what a great voice.
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  It is hard to cut that song off, but we will and go to the man himself.
[25:06.000 --> 25:13.000]  Willie Nelson. I'm just so glad in my little life that I've crossed paths with Willie Nelson and get to share a little bit of his precious time.
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.000]  He is just a precious person. We have a lot of celebrities on the show.
[25:17.000 --> 25:25.000]  I don't know that I don't get all sappy here, but he really is a great humanitarian and we're honored to have him.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  WillieNelson.com is the website.
[25:27.000 --> 25:34.000]  When we got cut off by the ice cream music earlier, actually Russian tech knows what it is.
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  We were getting into the difference between biodiesel and ethanol.
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.000]  At the end of the day, if growing corn for fuel saves farmers, I'm all for it.
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.000]  I think it was the greedy oil companies trying to demonize that because they want a monopoly, but explain to us the difference, Willie.
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  Well, I think mainly the difference is local sustainable.
[25:54.000 --> 26:08.000]  If you keep it local, then you keep the foreign market out of it and there's not trillions of dollars going back and forth and the farmer losing control and the consumer losing all the benefits of having it there.
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.000]  Local sustainable organic food is the future and it's just one you want to start.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  That's just where we're going.
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.000]  That's where we're going.
[26:17.000 --> 26:24.000]  Our economy is forcing us to go back to the basics, which we go back to growing our food, period.
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  Try to have some clean water around, period.
[26:28.000 --> 26:34.000]  It's down to survival again and I think a lot of people are facing that right now.
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  Well, Willie, I mean, you're absolutely right.
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.000]  It's down to survival because the big Monsanto and two other companies are buying up all the heirloom seeds.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  Their terminator genetics is spreading into all the other major seed crops.
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  They've infected almost 100% of the Mexican corn varieties that go back over 10,000 years.
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.000]  I mean, we have to get back into heirloom seeds and start having our own gardens.
[26:58.000 --> 27:05.000]  I know I have one wherever I live. We're meant as humans to be out there in the mud and dirt and children love it.
[27:05.000 --> 27:12.000]  We are seeing a reawakening, an explosion of community farms, small gardens.
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.000]  I think a lot of that is thanks to you and others spreading the word.
[27:16.000 --> 27:24.000]  There are so many young people out there that know what we're talking about who are already growing things in places
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  that their parents or grandparents never thought would grow.
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.000]  They grow on roofs of apartment buildings in New York City and Philadelphia.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  They grow in vacant lots.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  They have found places to grow food because they saw the necessity of it
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  and it was, you know, the necessity is the mother of invention.
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  If it's really needed badly enough, somebody will come up with a way to do it
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  and local, organic, sustainable food is where we're going.
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.000]  Well, absolutely. And then we have the revolution of solar, the revolution of wind.
[27:59.000 --> 28:05.000]  These are real local solutions and we have these atmospheric water generators
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  that give you the cleanest water out there. And Willie, I just now got into this
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  and I discovered that you've been in this for years.
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.000]  Tell us about the atmospheric water generator that you've lent your name to.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  I mean, you talk about getting off the grid. This is incredible.
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  Well, amazingly enough, I found out just a little while ago
[28:22.000 --> 28:28.000]  that the inventor of this water machine is over here in Marble Falls
[28:28.000 --> 28:35.000]  and he invented it in 1984. And I only found out about it a couple of years ago.
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  And when I found out about it, it was a company in Canada and California
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  which it's an amazing machine because you plug it in.
[28:45.000 --> 28:51.000]  It looks like an office water machine without the jug of water on the top
[28:51.000 --> 28:59.000]  and you plug it in today and tomorrow at this time you've got six gallons of pure fresh drinking water
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  that came right out of the air.
[29:01.000 --> 29:08.000]  I don't have the website in front of me, but I know the machine's called the Willie Nelson Water from Air Machine.
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.000]  People can just Google that and see some photos of you out at your house.
[29:11.000 --> 29:16.000]  Just last week in the Austin American statesman showing the thing off
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.000]  and we have it in the office. I now have it at home.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  And folks, it goes through five different filters. It's just an amazing system.
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.000]  And again, that is the key. That is real sustainability.
[29:28.000 --> 29:34.000]  It sure is. And now when you throw up a house out there somewhere you don't have to dig a well.
[29:34.000 --> 29:39.000]  You need some electricity, a generator, whatever you plug in one of these machines.
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  And they've got them all sizes where you can make the gallons a day
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  or you can make 2,500 gallons a day, 5,000 gallons a day.
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.000]  They have them up to, I think, 18,000 gallons.
[29:51.000 --> 29:59.000]  But this is the water, the 18,000 gallon one, I think is not drinkable water, but it is water.
[29:59.000 --> 30:03.000]  But they have them up to 5,000 gallons a day that I know about.
[30:03.000 --> 30:07.000]  Absolutely. One company we've got that's a sponsor tried to send me a big one.
[30:07.000 --> 30:10.000]  I said, no, I don't have room for it.
[30:10.000 --> 30:13.000]  Willie Nelson is our guest, WillieNelson.com.
[30:13.000 --> 30:16.000]  Got a big event coming up at the backyard this Sunday.
[30:16.000 --> 30:20.000]  Jesse Ventura, myself and Willie will tell you about that when we get back. Stay with us.
[30:20.000 --> 30:23.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[30:23.000 --> 30:27.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  How much food do you have in your fridge?
[30:32.000 --> 30:37.000]  How long would it last in the event of a nationwide crisis?
[31:02.000 --> 31:08.000]  Bioterrorism with a complete terror protection kit, including gas masks, biosuits, potassium iodate,
[31:08.000 --> 31:12.000]  a solar hand crank flashlight, radio, cell phone charger, and much more.

[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  We've got Willie Nelson for another 30 minutes, five minutes into the next hour.
[33:46.000 --> 33:51.000]  Then Naomi Wolfe joins us talking about what the military industrial complex is up to.
[33:51.000 --> 34:03.000]  The good news is that all the Poles and the troops I talked to on the street are with us against this corrupt world banking system.
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  So that is the good news.
[34:05.000 --> 34:14.000]  Willie Nelson, there are so many other things going on in this country that need to be addressed,
[34:14.000 --> 34:18.000]  but during the break we were talking about more positive solutions.
[34:18.000 --> 34:26.000]  What are other positive things that you and folks you're working with are trying to do to make the world a better place?
[34:26.000 --> 34:35.000]  Well, I think probably most of the things we do and you do, we just do subconsciously because that's the way we think.
[34:35.000 --> 34:40.000]  Whatever we do at the moment, anything that we can do to promote peace, we should do it.
[34:40.000 --> 34:49.000]  We should talk about how peace is more prosperous to us than war. War only benefits one or two percent.
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  But peace, you know, we are the biggest, I guess, bullet bomb maker in the world.
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  Arms dealing is what we do best, I guess.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  Produce half the weapons in the world, yeah.
[35:01.000 --> 35:09.000]  Yeah, so, you know, there's a lot of people who think we start wars and then sell bullets and bombs to both sides.
[35:09.000 --> 35:18.000]  And I can see how a guy with an evil intent would think that way.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  Absolutely, but I mean, the war is unpopular.
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  Over 75 percent of the American people wanted to end.
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  We're almost six years into it.
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  And it looks like Barack Obama is going to win.
[35:29.000 --> 35:38.000]  I certainly hope that he ends it as he said he will do, but he also said he was going to end the wiretapping,
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  and then voted for it.
[35:40.000 --> 35:47.000]  So I'm not holding my breath, but I guess, like you said, we can just keep pushing for it and hope it happens.
[35:47.000 --> 35:53.000]  Yeah, that's the only thing we can do is just to get that good positive picture in our minds.
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.000]  I think, you know, as simple as it sounds, it's like the golf swing.
[35:58.000 --> 36:04.000]  You've got to visualize it, and that's what we have to do.
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  Really, we have this event coming up Sunday, and it's special for a lot of reasons,
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  because a lot of people around the world in the country can't be there.
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  We're going to be streaming it thanks to you doing that free over the Internet.
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.000]  It'll be linked up at infowars.com and truthnews.us.
[36:20.000 --> 36:26.000]  We'll send a link over to your webmaster, so it'll probably be up there as well.
[36:26.000 --> 36:33.000]  Tell folks a little bit about the great folks at the backyard, this historic venue that you founded with Tim,
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.000]  and some of the things that are coming up on the itinerary Sunday and Sunday evening.
[36:38.000 --> 36:43.000]  Well, first of all, Kim O'Connor and I go all the way back to Castle Creek.
[36:43.000 --> 36:56.000]  In my opinion, he's one of the best music promoters, managers of bars and places where people come for entertainment.
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  You know, that I've been around, and I've been around a lot of good promoters,
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  and I like the way you can depend on what he says.
[37:04.000 --> 37:11.000]  We went from Castle Creek to several different other places, music hall and backyard.
[37:11.000 --> 37:18.000]  I think whatever Tim wants to do, I'm all for it, you know.
[37:18.000 --> 37:24.000]  Well, that's going to be an amazing event with Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura, Alex Jones, and I know Jimmy Vaughn's coming.
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  Just a whole bunch of other great people are going to be there, Willie.
[37:28.000 --> 37:35.000]  Yeah, I hear Johnny Knox pull my show up, and, you know, he is a piece of work,
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.000]  and I don't know if you've ever met him or not, but you should.
[37:39.000 --> 37:46.000]  No, I haven't met him, but I look forward to meeting him at the event.
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.000]  Some of the other issues, dealing with solutions, let's get into Farm Aid.
[37:52.000 --> 37:58.000]  How long have you been doing Farm Aid, and what are some of the things that Farm Aid is focusing in on?
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  What did you guys focus in on this year?
[38:01.000 --> 38:05.000]  Well, it's still a local sustainable agriculture.
[38:05.000 --> 38:11.000]  You know, the first Farm Aid was, I think, 1984, and it came about.
[38:11.000 --> 38:19.000]  I was in Chicago or St. Louis, and it was the State Fair.
[38:19.000 --> 38:26.000]  And me and Big Jim Thomas, the governor, had sort of a ritual every year when I'd come play the State Fair.
[38:26.000 --> 38:37.000]  We'd have a bowl of chili and a beer on the bus, and we were talking about how bad the farmer was getting it,
[38:37.000 --> 38:44.000]  and how he used to do pretty good, but now the farmers were losing them at an alarming rate,
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.000]  and we decided that we would do the first Farm Aid.
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.000]  So, hats off to Big Jim for helping us do that.
[38:52.000 --> 38:59.000]  I think 21 days later, Champaign, Illinois, when we had the first Farm Aid.
[38:59.000 --> 39:07.000]  Willie, I know you don't like talking about yourself, but people that know you know what a kind, general, real person,
[39:07.000 --> 39:15.000]  a lot of celebrities who've met you and know you or friends with you over the years, and they say Willie Nelson is the most down-to-earth, real person
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  that you'll find fame and fortune in being a global icon.
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  There aren't many, and you're one of them, not just of music, but just of culture period.
[39:23.000 --> 39:31.000]  It changes a lot of people, and you have so many people who I wouldn't even call fans.
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  They just really appreciate who you are and love who you are.
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  I mean, talk about yourself a little bit.
[39:37.000 --> 39:44.000]  Growing up and your metamorphosis, I mean, were you always the center to always this calm?
[39:44.000 --> 39:52.000]  You're somebody who wrote a whole bunch of the famous Patsy Klein songs and songs that Elvis and everybody else sung
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  and would sell them for $25, you know, $50.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  You've been a radio talk show host, DJ.
[39:58.000 --> 40:08.000]  You didn't get, though you had all those huge accomplishments, the real fame until the 70s, and then it's just built from there.
[40:08.000 --> 40:16.000]  I mean, wasn't the fact that fame came later in life that helped you stay centered and not have it go to your head?
[40:16.000 --> 40:24.000]  I mean, that's a lot there I threw out, but for folks out there trying to understand, you know, the person Willie Nelson
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  and the people that have you as a role model, you know, how did you grow?
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  What's the core of Willie Nelson and what advice would you give people about philosophy of life?
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  Well, first of all, I come from Abbott, Texas, a little farm in Ranch Town,
[40:38.000 --> 40:44.000]  and I found out real early that farming was hard, ranking was a little easier.
[40:44.000 --> 40:52.000]  So that was one of the first lessons that I learned and also learned by hanging out with the farmers and ranchers
[40:52.000 --> 40:58.000]  and folks there in Abbott that a town survived by taking care of itself,
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  and the farmers were the ones who sustained us.
[41:01.000 --> 41:08.000]  They grew our cotton and corn, and I learned a lot from the guys who grew things.
[41:08.000 --> 41:19.000]  And throughout the years, I think I can say that I owe a lot to Abbott and the education that I got just growing up there.
[41:19.000 --> 41:28.000]  But continuing through your life, I mean, what was it like seeing song after song you wrote being number one hits
[41:28.000 --> 41:35.000]  and, you know, the fact that you, I mean, that's true that you sold one of Patsy Klein's biggest hits for 50 bucks or was it 100?
[41:35.000 --> 41:43.000]  No, actually, when I started out writing poems when I was five or six years old and then I learned to play guitar,
[41:43.000 --> 41:51.000]  my grandparents raised me and I learned, and we learned, and my sister learned music real early.
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.000]  I would learn a lot from her, but I would play the guitar and write songs.
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  And then I got up, I was working on the farm.
[42:00.000 --> 42:09.000]  I was making very little money out of baling hay, picking cotton, and on Saturdays I'd go down and shine shoes at the barbershop
[42:09.000 --> 42:14.000]  and also had my guitar there, so I'd sing a song.
[42:14.000 --> 42:23.000]  So I started out playing, so music has always been a big part of what I did, and it still is.
[42:23.000 --> 42:34.000]  Didn't your grandmother order a self-taught catalog or book on guitar playing through the mail
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  and that basically you were somewhat self-taught?
[42:37.000 --> 42:46.000]  Pretty much. I learned a few chords and by playing with sister Bobby, I would sit on the piano,
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  stew next to her, and she would play as she read the music.
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  I would learn the chords that way.
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.000]  I do know that I was making a couple of dollars a day picking cotton,
[42:58.000 --> 43:05.000]  and one night I went out with the Raycheck Band and I made $8 playing the guitar.
[43:05.000 --> 43:11.000]  So that was my first big success story.
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.000]  Now is it true that you got on the radio when you were 13 years old?
[43:16.000 --> 43:26.000]  Yeah, when KHBR, Hillsborough, me and my sister and her husband, time and my football coach who played trombone,
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  we had a radio show up there on Saturdays.
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  That's amazing, Willie.
[43:34.000 --> 43:42.000]  I think it's safe to say you probably lived one of already and so much more ahead of you a full life.
[43:42.000 --> 43:48.000]  Well, yeah. I think you could easily say that.
[43:48.000 --> 43:53.000]  There's that song that Johnny Cash and others have sung. I've been everywhere, man.
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.000]  Do you think you've probably been more places than Johnny Cash?
[43:57.000 --> 44:06.000]  Well, I don't know about that, but that's what we do. We travel and we've been for most places at once,
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.000]  and a lot of them have several times.
[44:11.000 --> 44:16.000]  What's your favorite venue to play? Do you have one?
[44:16.000 --> 44:24.000]  Yeah, I do. There is a place in Morrison, Colorado. Red Rocks, Anthony Feud.
[44:24.000 --> 44:30.000]  It's an incredible place to play, and then naturally after that,
[44:30.000 --> 44:37.000]  I've been places around Austin through the years, mainly because of the crowds.
[44:37.000 --> 44:45.000]  But as far as venues are concerned, Red Rocks, Anthony Feud are, I think, the best one.
[44:45.000 --> 44:50.000]  Willie, when did you move to Austin?
[44:50.000 --> 45:00.000]  I had been coming here for years playing music, and my sister had moved here,
[45:00.000 --> 45:11.000]  and I had planned on, this was way back there, when we were going to get an apartment in Houston
[45:11.000 --> 45:18.000]  or buy a condo or something, and then I drove up to Austin to visit with my sister.
[45:18.000 --> 45:23.000]  And that's when I decided that this was really the place where I wanted to be.
[45:23.000 --> 45:28.000]  But the year had to be, what, 1975, I guess?
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.000]  Well, I tell you, and Willie Nelson and Austin sure went together well, didn't they?
[45:33.000 --> 45:39.000]  Oh, it was, yeah. You know, the university is here, Darryl Royal is here.
[45:39.000 --> 45:49.000]  Joe Jamal come up a lot, and we just had a lot of fun listening to music and going to football games.
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.000]  Those were great times back in Austin in those days.
[45:53.000 --> 45:58.000]  Amazing. My grandparents, of course, lived in Austin.
[45:58.000 --> 46:03.000]  We'd come down here and visit from Dallas when I was a little kid, and then I moved here in high school.
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.000]  And I remember always telling my parents, I want to live in Austin.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  It's a lot. I'm not bashing Dallas. It's just Austin is such a great place.
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  Boy, it sure has grown, hasn't it, Willie?
[46:12.000 --> 46:19.000]  Yeah, it has. Out here where I live, it's amazing how it's built up out here.
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  Well, look at the backyard. I mean, that used to overlook the hills, and now there's a big shopping mall around it.
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.000]  That's right. I guess that's one of the reasons that they're having to move.
[46:29.000 --> 46:38.000]  Well, it's a historic final event at the backyard. I'm told Tim is sad about that.
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  But I guess all good things, as my grandma used to say, unfortunately come to an end.
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  But there'll be a new one.
[46:44.000 --> 46:50.000]  Tim is a soldier, you know, and he likes to, you know, what good is a soldier without a good war?
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.000]  So Tim likes to get out there and mix it up with the folks.
[46:53.000 --> 47:00.000]  I guarantee you he'll come out on top on this one. He'll have him another spot over there that's just as good.
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.000]  Absolutely. In fact, bigger and just as pretty there in the hills.
[47:04.000 --> 47:09.000]  Willie, I want to get into some serious issues in the last 15 minutes or so that we've got left with you.
[47:09.000 --> 47:15.000]  But right now, I mean, I know you don't like talking about yourself, but people want to hear from you and they want to hear about you.
[47:15.000 --> 47:28.000]  You are prolific. I mean, you're just into all sorts of businesses and charities and events and causes and are just so accessible for somebody of your highest caliber in the culture.
[47:28.000 --> 47:37.000]  You've written quite a few books and you wrote The Towel of Willie with a great guy who I've gotten to know separately through some movies I've been in with him.
[47:37.000 --> 47:43.000]  That's Turk Pibkin. And then he wrote The Towel of Willie with you about your philosophy that we were just getting into earlier that really gets into that.
[47:43.000 --> 47:51.000]  But you've got a new book out. You've done a fiction book. Tell us about A Tale of Luck or A Tale of Luck.
[47:51.000 --> 48:04.000]  Well, honestly, there's a writer. His name is Mike Blakely. He's a great guy from Texas and writes a lot of Good Western lore and a real cowboy and knows the lingo.
[48:04.000 --> 48:16.000]  When they asked me to write this book called Tales out of Luck, you know, they had in mind the book and then a movie and etc.
[48:16.000 --> 48:27.000]  And I know my qualification, so I was glad Mike Blakely was here. I gave him some ideas and we talked and he went away and wrote the book.
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  And so we have to give him all the credit.
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.000]  Well, it's been getting great reviews. Tell folks about the basic storyline for people that might want to read it.
[48:35.000 --> 48:42.000]  Well, basically, you know, it's pretty much like real life. It's about a guy who has a bunch of horses.
[48:42.000 --> 48:52.000]  You know, I think the difference is that when, you know, the story is there's some few Indians involved and a few thieves and crooks.
[48:52.000 --> 49:04.000]  And so it's a well written story and even just the way it starts out once you get into the first chapter, you know, you know,
[49:04.000 --> 49:11.000]  well, shifting gears into some really serious issues we're dealing with.
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.000]  And because last time you were bringing it up on your own and then I kind of glazed over and moved on to the next question.
[49:16.000 --> 49:24.000]  You've seen my film Terror Storm, you've seen my film Endgame for Bluebird, a blueprint for global enslavement dealing with the Bilderberg group and the global elite.
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.000]  And of course over the years you told me you'd seen some of my TV shows and heard the radio show.
[49:29.000 --> 49:35.000]  Overall, you know, positively waking up and getting communities involved and decentralizing.
[49:35.000 --> 49:45.000]  If we can be local and have local control, that will short circuit these internationalists, but a big part of the solution is identifying them.
[49:45.000 --> 49:50.000]  I mean, watching Endgame or, you know, seeing these global elites meeting in secret and setting world policy.
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.000]  What was your take on those two films and, of course, on government sponsored terrorism itself?
[49:56.000 --> 50:03.000]  Well, I thought it was very important work that you did and that needed to be out there.
[50:03.000 --> 50:06.000]  People needed to know what happened.
[50:06.000 --> 50:14.000]  I think all of the things that I've read that you've done and that I listened to hear you talking about are things that people need to know.
[50:14.000 --> 50:28.000]  You know, that's why I'm glad to be on your program so we can both talk about things that together I think we can come up with more ideas and pull them out there and let the people give us some feedback.
[50:28.000 --> 50:34.000]  And let's talk about farmers, let's talk about local sustainable agriculture.
[50:34.000 --> 50:44.000]  And I think we can turn it around just by talking and having some solutions from the old joke if there is no solution and there is no problem.
[50:44.000 --> 50:51.000]  Well, we're going to break here in a moment and come back with two final little segments for 10 minutes with Willie Nelson.
[50:51.000 --> 51:01.000]  But I'm going to talk to Willie about why he took the plunge for 9-11 Truth, particularly here on this radio show back, I guess, in January.
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.000]  How Time Flies 10 months ago.
[51:04.000 --> 51:07.000]  He doesn't call it courage.
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.000]  He just calls it telling the truth and is going with it.
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  But that did send shock waves around the world.
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  Since then we saw Jesse Ventura go public.
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  We've seen an Italian president go public.
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.000]  We've seen best actress this year go public 9-11 Truth.
[51:22.000 --> 51:27.000]  And the fact that that's exponentially building and why he thinks 9-11 Truth is important.

[52:29.000 --> 52:36.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:36.000 --> 52:39.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  But who is the enemy?
[52:40.000 --> 52:41.000]  Bin Laden.
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.000]  This is his MO.
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[52:46.000 --> 52:53.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[52:53.000 --> 53:00.000]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA.
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  The hijackers ties to the FBI.
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  The Saudi Arabian connection.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  The Israeli intelligence network.
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  Warnings and war games.
[53:12.000 --> 53:13.000]  The shadow government.
[53:13.000 --> 53:14.000]  And much, much more.
[53:14.000 --> 53:15.000]  Fabled Enemies.

[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  Willie Nelson is our guest, bottom line Willie.
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.000]  I've talked to a lot of people that have known you for decades, here in Austin, people that have worked with you.
[54:42.000 --> 54:52.000]  Ask them what makes Willie Nelson tick, because people I admire, I want to emulate them, I want to know who they are, I want to understand them, so I can be a better person.
[54:52.000 --> 54:59.000]  Because I don't claim to be as calm or nicer as free-wheeling people go after me and do bad things to me.
[54:59.000 --> 55:10.000]  I try to control myself, but I tend to want to go after them or whatever, and I notice that in your philosophy that you found, hey, it's just better to be loving, be nice.
[55:10.000 --> 55:19.000]  Bottom line, that philosophy has really held you in good stead, and I kind of asked the question earlier, but you didn't fully answer it.
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  Have you always been this way or did this develop Willie?
[55:22.000 --> 55:29.000]  No, it's kind of like my grandmother said, a hard head makes a sore ass.
[55:29.000 --> 55:44.000]  I went through some times where I felt like I knew better than everybody, and it took a while for me to realize that I was as smart as I thought I was.
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  That old cliche is true. The older I get, the more I know I don't know anything.
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  That's right.
[55:52.000 --> 56:03.000]  Willie, 9-Eleven Truth. You had to know when you went on this show, it started speaking out, saying that you believed they blew the towers up and it was an inside job, that you were going to get heat.
[56:03.000 --> 56:15.000]  Talking to people that know you, they say that when you know something serious and it affects the community and it's important to expose it, that you know that it's your job basically to shake things up and to put yourself on the line.
[56:15.000 --> 56:22.000]  I mean, did you think about it before you went public for 9-Eleven Truth or did you just know that it was an inside job and do it?
[56:22.000 --> 56:29.000]  Well, it was too obvious that it was an inside. I've seen things implode before.
[56:29.000 --> 56:40.000]  I couldn't see any reason to act like that didn't happen because it did happen, and that's what I think happened.
[56:40.000 --> 56:46.000]  And should I worry about what somebody else thinks about what I think?
[56:46.000 --> 56:55.000]  Well, there's so many declassified government documents that are public where criminal elements of our government and other governments have staged other terror attacks before.
[56:55.000 --> 57:01.000]  I think that's the strongest evidence right there is that it's admitted Gulf of Tonkin and so many other events were staged.
[57:01.000 --> 57:07.000]  I mean, that's the first question we should ask whenever something happens that allows the good old boys the establishment to take more freedom.
[57:07.000 --> 57:17.000]  Yeah, and you have to admit that there are people in the world who will do anything.
[57:17.000 --> 57:26.000]  You know, Willie, in the past, I hated those people. And as soon as I turned loose and stopped hating them a few years ago and really want to stop them, I want to resist them.
[57:26.000 --> 57:33.000]  I'm going to fight them, but I don't hate them. I really feel sorry for them and realize they're really screwed up bad people.
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  That took a weight off me. I mean, is that kind of the philosophy you discovered?
[57:38.000 --> 57:48.000]  Well, yeah, it goes back to the law of karma. There is a cause and effect, and whatever you do, you'll get back.
[57:48.000 --> 57:58.000]  Whether it's good, bad, whatever. So you sort of plan your own future that way, one thought or one action at a time.
[57:58.000 --> 58:08.000]  I've seen it happen so many times in my life that I know that's the best way to go is just to get out of the way and let it happen.
[58:08.000 --> 58:19.000]  Absolutely. Out on, you know, we talked privately and you said that going all over the place since you went on this radio show that people come up at the events and say,
[58:19.000 --> 58:30.000]  you're going public for 9-Eleven Truth, and you were saying the vast majority, what, 90-something percent have agreed with you. That's another illustration of how awake the public is.
[58:30.000 --> 58:35.000]  Yeah, that was back then. That over 3% now, I think, are having second thoughts.
[58:35.000 --> 58:49.000]  Absolutely. You know, that's another untold story. The media doesn't want to touch that. There's polls years ago, 84% believe they're being lied to about 9-Eleven Truth.
[58:49.000 --> 58:59.000]  It's just Willie Nelson had the courage to stand up and say the emperor has no clothes. And to that, we owe him quite a debt because people that are icons get more heat for their statements than just average Joe Schmoen.
[58:59.000 --> 59:05.000]  So that's why we thank you, Willie Nelson, for your tremendous courage.
[59:05.000 --> 59:10.000]  Willie, sorry. Go ahead, Willie. We'll be right back.
[59:10.000 --> 59:20.000]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:20.000 --> 59:29.000]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[59:29.000 --> 59:36.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-Eleven film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[59:36.000 --> 59:45.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[59:45.000 --> 59:52.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-Eleven Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[59:52.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off in year 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  It's our final segment with Willie Nelson. If you need to know introduction, WillieNelson.com. And as we ended the last hour, I brought up the fact that we appreciate his courage in going public for 9-Eleven Truth and taking that risk as he's taken some of the others.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  And you were trying to say something as we went to break, Willie.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Oh, I probably wasn't important.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  I think that's another secret, Willie. You don't take yourself too seriously. But you are a pretty serious person when it comes down to the bottom line.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  And in closing, we were talking during the break about a solution. What if my millions of listeners, who aren't just millions of listeners, but the best, most active people out there, guest after guest have said that,
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  what if we sift them in a good way on a solution to contact Congress, the media, and say, look, don't give the trillions of dollars to the private offshore banks who've cut off liquidity, not just a billion.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  What if we said take 100 billion of that with the plan that Willie Nelson and experts he's worked with have devised and gave that to the farmers to try to resuscitate them?
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Willie, talk about that solution. Talk about your peace institute and how people can get involved.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  Well, first of all, I was asking for a billion, but I think 100 billion is better. I like your math better than mine.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  And I guarantee you it's needed and it would go to the right cause.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  As far as Peace Research Institute, that's a website that I set up a little while back with a couple of great folks who take care of it for me. And I wrote a song called Peaceful Solution and sort of gave it to everybody to write their own versions of it.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  And there's been, I guess, maybe 200 different versions of that song recorded and videoed now. So there are a whole lot of people who realize that it will be peace on earth. That's been the promise.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  And I think anybody who believes in anything positive has to think that way.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  It goes, what? A Peaceful Solution? A Peace Revolution? Let's take America back. Is that right or am I butchering that?
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  There is the Peaceful Solution. All the Peace Revolution. Let's take back America.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  There you go.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  And to dream so believe it. Get ready to receive it. Take back.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  Willie, I didn't know you were going to sing the song. Start over. Start over. Start over for us. Go ahead. Please.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  Well, there is the people. Well, first of all, I started out as my sister, my daughter, I'm sorry, my daughter, Amy, and I were going to Coachella.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  We were doing this concert and she said, I had this dream where you were singing a song called Peaceful Solution.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  So I started thinking about it and there is the Peaceful Solution. All the Peace Revolution.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  Now let's take back America. It's a dream so believe it. Get ready to receive it. And we'll take that America.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  There's war over here, but I know we can win it. We'll take that America.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  When the war is over and we want it, just remember how we've done it so we don't have to do it again.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  There is a Peaceful Solution. Peace Revolution. Now let's take back America.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Now let's take back America.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  Wow, that's beautiful. And just another example.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  Another example of Willie Nelson taking action, putting out an idea, a dream of his daughter and it being picked up by tens of millions of people.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  It's all over YouTube. There's more than 200 versions on YouTube. I see new ones every day.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  And another example, Willie Nelson, I'm going to say bye to you off air here in just a moment, but we love you.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  We appreciate you and I can't wait to see you Sunday, Willie.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  Alright, look forward to it.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  We have a new president coming into office in January. His number one word of use is change.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  What if the change was not the change America expected?
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  What if all natural products were handed over to the pharmaceutical companies to be eradicated?
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  What if the only remedy for sickness and disease was to take drugs?
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  This hasn't happened yet, I repeat, not yet.

[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  bin Laden. This is his ammo.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.

[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.

[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  That's why I'd like you to visit.

[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  We've got it for the next hour and 15 minutes on the heels of Willie Nelson, who is just such a great guy.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  He told me over 10 years he's, quote, been my biggest fan, just completely blows me away.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  And I know that people like Willie Nelson are tuning in on a routine basis.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  That humbles me because he is such a humanitarian.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  We're going to go to Naomi Wolfe and talk about a host of issues with the election, the gear up for Marshall Lobb, and so much more.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  But before we do that, I just wanted a minute or two to play a peaceful solution, peace revolution.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  Let's take America back by Willie Nelson. Here it is.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  There is a peaceful solution called peace revolution. Now let's take back America.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  There's a war and we're in. I know we can win this. So let's take back America.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  There was a dream so believe it and get ready to receive it. Now let's take back America.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  And when the war is over and we want it, let's remember how we've done it so we don't have to do it again.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  There is a peaceful solution called peace revolution. Now let's take back America.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  There is a peaceful solution called peace revolution. Now let's take back America.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  There's a dream so believe it and get ready to receive it. Now let's take back America.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  The war is over and we want it. Let's remember how we've done it so we don't have to do it again.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  There's a peaceful solution called peace revolution. Now let's take back America.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  Alright, you can go to www.WillieNelsonPRI.com and you can check out all the things that Willie Nelson is doing that are peace related.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  There he was talking about 9-11 Minute Inside Job, the New World Order of the Whole Nine Yards, with us for an hour.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  We are now joined by Naomi Wolfe and I am extremely honored to have her. She doesn't need much of an introduction,
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  but her new book out that has been a best seller is of course the end of America and she has been breaking down the whole police state buildup
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  that we've seen in Army Brigades, not just one, they list others, just the new ones being activated under Northcom.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  Finally, when she talked about it, we've been talking about it a long time, it did get a lot of international and national attention.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  So we're honored to have Naomi Wolfe with us. Naomi, good to have you here with us.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  Thank you so much for having me back, Alex. I also really want to thank members of your community who very kindly have been supporting our talking again.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  I'm just delighted.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  Oh, it's great to have you here and especially for close to two hours. Out of the gates, you're awakening to the ten steps of fascism
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  and maybe briefly go over a few of those and then with horror, the open end of the Posse Commentatus,
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  the military warfare drills admitting that it's for domestic operations, civil unrest.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  They've been gearing up for this for quite a long time and you've certainly been raising the alarm bells.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  So please go over that, Naomi Wolfe.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  Sure. Thank you.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  Wow, it's a lot. Let's see where do I begin. You're quite right to mention our last conversation.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  It was about the last book I brought out which did, in fact, for people who aren't familiar with the argument that probably most are
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  because it won't be such new news to your community as it is to many other people.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  I was arguing that there are these ten sort of classic steps that you always see when a would-be dictator is seeking to close down an open society to crush a democracy
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  or to crush a democracy movement and that we're seeing those in America.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  And then my new book that's sequel to that is called Give Me Liberty and it's sort of what we do about it.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  It's action steps we can take and calling on the founder's vision for what we're supposed to do in a time of crisis like this.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  But step eight, nine, and ten are really accelerating.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  I said last fall and I've been saying for months and it's not that I'm so smart, it's that this blueprint is so very predictive.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  I've been saying since last fall, as you may remember, within six months we're going to be seeing mass arrests and we had those in March.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  I said you're going to start seeing journalists being arrested and journalists were swept up in preemptive brutal arrests at the RNC and St. Paul.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  And I said you're going to see steps making it easier for the step ten for the leader to declare martial law.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  And by the way, we did even see Amy Goodman arrested.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  I had reporters there, Richard Reeves and George Butler, who reported for us and they were there and they said no one would touch the police in most of the cases.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  No one would even tumble over a trash can.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  They would just scoop everyone up.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  They would taser people, rubber bullet them.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  They would spray things on them and take them to jail and then charge them under state statutes of terrorism.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  Yeah, I mean it's unbelievable.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  I mean, maybe I should address that before I get to the first brigade.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  You know, there's footage that we've got.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  They've made a movie at the end of America and it was just released yesterday free online.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  Thanks largely to your advice, by the way, Alex.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  And we've got footage that is so chilling.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  You know, very few Americans have seen what actually happened in this militarized St. Paul where millions of dollars of Homeland Security money was pumped as it is across the country now.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  Pumped into local police forces, agents training police, agents infiltrating, and other reporters like Michelangelo Sr. really, a very respected reporter here in New York said that he was stopped by people who had no identification at all.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  People in like dark blue jumpsuits who you couldn't tell, are they police? Are they black water? Are they mercenaries? Are they Americans? Are they, you know, not Americans?
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  But anyway, there's this terrifying footage of just as you say, Alex, people sitting quietly in the sun not doing anything, being surrounded by these, you know, heavily armed militarized police and then being told you're all under arrest.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  And then just as you say, and by the way, this footage only survived because this young person buried it in the ground so he could come back after his arrest and retrieve it.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  Whereas the most scary thing as a reporter I heard is that no other footage really survived.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  You know, that's good because the police were exposing people's film.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  I'm sorry, they don't do that anymore. You know, ruining people's documentation equipment.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  Yeah, they had de-magnetizers out.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  Oh my God, see, you're always six steps ahead of me, Alex. What are de-magnetizers?
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  But I mean, Naomi, the bottom line here is, well, it's what they use in film production.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  But with the new videotapes or discs, it's got a handle and it goes, me-er, and then it just shoots the waves through it and then erases it.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  And that also happened at the RNC in 2004 in New York to a bunch of reporters or they would just never give the cameras or videotapes or memory sticks back.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  But since you mentioned it, about two months ago, Blackwater was photographed in LA, in San Diego, in raids on medical marijuana facilities.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  And then two weeks ago, I saw multiple articles of Blackwater aiding local law enforcement fugitive hunts, just Google Blackwater Aid Sheriff's Department and Fugitive Hunts.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  So now we see it happening, not just in New Orleans, but now all over the country.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  I just wanted to back you up there.
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  Thank you. I mean, well, that's certainly terrifying and I have to wrap my brain around that.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  But so you're right about the militarized RNC, but that isn't enough, apparently, because what happened on October 1st is essentially a coup has taken place in practice,
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  even though a robe is very brilliant and having it be kind of a coup by inches like it's a stealth coup.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  But I say without rhetorical flourish that a coup has taken place, Alex, because the first brigade of the Third Infantry Division, which is three to five thousand soldiers,
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  was redeployed from Iraq to somewhere in the United States.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  And this is a violation of 200 years of laws from the Insurrection Act of 1807 to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1879 that have protected us as Americans from soldiers being deployed to do civilian policing.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  And the Army Times report, the initial report said they are here, their mission is crowd control, and these are the people who were responsible for crowd control in Fallujah.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  You know, they're armed with tasers and rubber bullets. They had quotes from people who were tasered in exercises, which seems like an odd kind of quote.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  And they also said, we hope we don't have to shoot Americans. That was a cryptic quote, but they owe me the key.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  Wait, where do I find that? You're ahead of me. Where was that reported?
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  That was originally in there and they took it out.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  In the Army Times?
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  Yes, but listen, at the bottom of the article, and they took that off too, but we have printed copies, they listed the other units already here that they're aiding.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  Oh no.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  And we ran into those groups in 98, 99, 2000 in Texas, and they would come up and tell us, turn your cameras off.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  So this is just one public brigade we're hearing about. There's a much larger contingent.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  Oh God. Well, okay, so when citizens, so I just need to like share with you because you'll understand, you know, I've been very reluctant on this learning curve to face how much the mainstream media is colluding and suppressing this information.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Because as you know, you know, I live in that world and it's scary for me to think that, you know, there's so much of a blackout.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  But I was just on the Today Show talking about the deployment of the First Brigade and they framed it as if I was a dangerous radical.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  And they had a spin from the commander of the First Brigade, you know, saying that we're helping communities with affected by weapons of mass destruction.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  Yeah, this is amazing.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  No follow-up, no reporting.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  Naomi, stay there. We got a break. We're going to come back and get into this right now on the other side. Naomi Wolfe is our...

[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  Now, we got secret documents, because the FBI at a checkpoint with a regular army was illegally searching vehicles.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  They gave us the classified documents, with the cover story for local media, stapled to the top, we posted them, uponinfowars.com.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  The headline was written by Ed Holman, 4InfoWars.com, in Thanksgiving of 1998, was It's Martial
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.520]  Law and it's a 3 on the Richter scale.
[1:25:24.520 --> 1:25:29.680]  We're explaining how it was over time creeping, how under the name of bomb disposal, that's
[1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:34.520]  what the media is told, but on the sub sheets, this is in police state to the takeover.
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:38.000]  You can go see the documents there with phone numbers.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:43.320]  It said, we are in warrants service, law enforcement, the regular army will aid you for anything,
[1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:44.720]  not just bomb disposal.
[1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:50.160]  Their front is bomb disposal and now you notice the commander of the brigade countered Naomi
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:51.160]  Wolfe.
[1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:52.440]  I want to tell that story right now.
[1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:55.080]  He countered her and said, oh, we're just bomb disposal.
[1:25:55.080 --> 1:26:00.040]  They also say the jaws of life, oh, the army's here just to help get you out of a wrecked
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:01.040]  car.
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:03.040]  So, see, that's the PR front.
[1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:06.200]  Naomi Wolfe, tell us how he tried to counter you.
[1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:10.880]  Well, it wasn't my memory that they said bomb disposal, although I have to say I was
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:19.600]  so shocked that the head of that brigade took the trouble to rebut, you know, my ordinary
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:23.720]  citizens' questions about who are these people and why are they deployed, that I was taken
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:28.880]  back, but you can go to the Today Show transcript and see my memory is that he said, oh, we're
[1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:33.880]  here to help communities affected by weapons of mass destruction, which raises plenty of
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:38.560]  questions itself, you know, but again, I've been reaching out to friends at the New York
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:41.720]  Times and the Philadelphia Choir, and maybe this doesn't shock you as much as it shocks
[1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:45.520]  me, but I am in shock, saying, where is your reporting on this?
[1:26:45.520 --> 1:26:49.400]  And they said there's nothing on the wire services, you know, the New York Times said
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:53.720]  the record or on background that they're investigating, but they obviously haven't reported anything
[1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:54.720]  yet.
[1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:58.160]  So, I'm in a position where citizens are coming to me saying, Naomi, where's the first brigade,
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:02.680]  what's their mission, and, you know, I can't tell them where they are, and I know that
[1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:09.240]  the latest PR releases, I just blogged about this yesterday on Buzzflash, you know, from
[1:27:09.240 --> 1:27:13.240]  the military are lying to the American people about the law.
[1:27:13.240 --> 1:27:22.160]  The last PR out of Colorado by, I guess, Northcom said, oh, you know, conspiracy theorists are
[1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:27.120]  overreacting, there are laws against deploying military units on the street, but that's not
[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:34.920]  true anymore, with the signing statement that Bush issued countering Congress's limitations
[1:27:34.920 --> 1:27:40.640]  on his access to the Defense Authorization Act of 2007, there aren't any laws anymore
[1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:44.200]  against deploying these people, and I have an interview, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:48.840]  It shows their deceptiveness, their press release in the Army Times says, we're there
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:53.480]  for crowd control, for civil disturbances, non-lethal weapons, they're announcing the
[1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:57.920]  microwave guns on TV, the head of the Air Force, and the Associated Press, the civilian
[1:27:57.920 --> 1:28:03.720]  head, the secretary said last year we need to use these weapons on Americans first, because
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:08.800]  then that will internationally allow us to use this against foreign armies, we can't
[1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:14.520]  under-treaty, but if we use it in police actions here, the American people is getting
[1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:18.080]  picked, so there they are saying, we're going to be domestically operating, and then they
[1:28:18.080 --> 1:28:23.600]  double think, and St. Amy Wolfe's making this up when they themselves are admitting it,
[1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:27.520]  so this is the just incredible level of deception, go ahead.
[1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:34.080]  Well now I've got to say to you, Alex, honestly I should really like, you know, just like
[1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:38.920]  meditate or something before I talk to you, because it's so like piecing together, and
[1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:42.720]  then you'll give me sources that I haven't seen, and I have to just like take my thinking
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:49.600]  to another level, and Alex, any sources that are, you know, to kind of journalistically
[1:28:49.600 --> 1:28:53.520]  grounded that you want to send me, so that I can blog about this, so I can raise people's
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:57.480]  awareness, because we do sort of reach different audiences, I would be very honored if you
[1:28:57.480 --> 1:28:58.480]  would do so.
[1:28:58.480 --> 1:29:03.720]  Well let me just do this on air, John, call Paul Watson, because I could do this myself,
[1:29:03.720 --> 1:29:07.160]  but I can't talk on the air and get you all these, I'm going to bring Paul, and we've
[1:29:07.160 --> 1:29:12.680]  got an hour and a half coming up, it's plenty of time, call Paul Watson, and I'm not bragging
[1:29:12.680 --> 1:29:14.800]  because it's scary to be in this position.
[1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:20.320]  We discovered this just bumping into urban warfare drills in 96 in Texas, I knew nothing
[1:29:20.320 --> 1:29:24.040]  about it when I witnessed groups training to confiscate guns and put Americans in FEMA
[1:29:24.040 --> 1:29:28.680]  camps on video admitting it's for America, and then up through 2000, and then I quit
[1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:32.320]  traveling because I'd already proven it, it's only accelerated since then, but I went all
[1:29:32.320 --> 1:29:40.320]  over the country, Maryland, California, Alabama, North Carolina, I mean we have video of all
[1:29:40.320 --> 1:29:45.200]  this, and their own documents and Marines coming up with guns and saying turn your video
[1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:50.160]  cameras off, working with local police running checkpoints, I'll get Paul Watson on, and
[1:29:50.160 --> 1:29:56.240]  then he on air will give you the headlines, because this is good to do on air to show
[1:29:56.240 --> 1:30:00.840]  listeners the integration of the information, because I have to say, because I'm going to
[1:30:00.840 --> 1:30:04.160]  be the judge advocate, generals and others who are against this as well, I talk about
[1:30:04.160 --> 1:30:10.480]  this three or four days a week, four, twelve years, and so that's why, and I've been screaming
[1:30:10.480 --> 1:30:14.320]  bloody murder, and finally you've got a bigger voice than I do, because you're so respected,
[1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:20.440]  and you know, so we'll talk about when we get back and talk about your new film.
[1:30:20.440 --> 1:30:27.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[1:33:51.840 --> 1:34:05.280]  I tell you, it's hilarious, Watson is always the best at Googling things, he may even be
[1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:08.800]  better than I am, but he's leaving to go to dinner so I'm going to let him go, I knew
[1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:13.000]  what I heard him and his girlfriend in the background complaining, oh there that's funny
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:16.480]  for the folks listening on the web and we're getting into serious issues, we've got Naomi
[1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:23.280]  Welfare and I'm babbling, the point is, I need the listeners at the Prison Planet Forum
[1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:29.600]  to create a section right now and find me all the articles, find the sub-clip out of
[1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:34.720]  police state too, the takeover with the army documents, I know that link was dead on M4s
[1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:38.840]  with the documents, find those, post them all right now, so before she leaves at the
[1:34:38.840 --> 1:34:43.440]  end of the show, I can email those to her because time is of the essence, but bringing
[1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:47.240]  Paul Watson up, Paul you brought up another key point, that British Ministry of Defense
[1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:51.160]  plan where they admitted the military is going to have to be used against the people of England
[1:34:51.160 --> 1:34:56.800]  and the United States, but I guess you did do the research a few months ago, I asked
[1:34:56.800 --> 1:35:00.400]  you to do it and you did send Naomi that, so I appreciate you doing that, Watson.
[1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:06.440]  I just want to jump in and say that I did cite and give me Liberty an article in The
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:13.240]  New Yorker where experts on new generation technologies and police forces were talking
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:18.440]  about crowd control technologies that involve microwave guns as well as tasers which have
[1:35:18.440 --> 1:35:23.520]  killed 300 people and rubber bullets which are so lethal that they've stopped using
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:26.960]  them in the UK because they've killed so many Irish people and something that was
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:30.760]  particularly disturbing to me about the first reports of army times that they've since
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:35.200]  backtracked on, is that they were saying they're here to quote-unquote subdue unruly individuals
[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:40.200]  so just to be sure that I've said to you Alex what I want to say, why am I so scared
[1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:45.000]  as someone who studied closing societies is that again and again around the world the
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:51.960]  leader will deploy soldiers to harass or arrest voters and opposition leaders during an election.
[1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:55.160]  Yeah, this is classic tyranny, since we have Paul, let me just say bye to him in the name
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:58.320]  of Naomi, I'm going to give you the floor, no, no, no, no, no, you've got, you're going
[1:35:58.320 --> 1:36:01.280]  to have the floor in just a moment, you just were shocked to hear all that stuff so I want
[1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:04.960]  to make sure you get it because what you cover actually is able to break through the mainstream
[1:36:04.960 --> 1:36:05.960]  media.
[1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:09.960]  Paul, I guess if you're not aware or don't remember that article, I'm surprised you don't,
[1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:10.960]  I'll just find and give it to you.
[1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:16.120]  I know one headline, Alex, which is from CNN, the link's dead, but the headline's still
[1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:24.560]  there, it says Air Force Chief Test Weapons on Test U.S. Mobs from September 2006.
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:30.720]  They say the headline again, that's not the exact one, yeah, the AP is the key, but say
[1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:31.720]  it again, Watson.
[1:36:31.720 --> 1:36:38.600]  Yeah, it's an AP story which was carried by CNN, Air Force Chief Test Weapons on Test
[1:36:38.600 --> 1:36:41.400]  U.S. Mobs is the one I'm familiar with.
[1:36:41.400 --> 1:36:42.400]  Oh, wow.
[1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:43.400]  Yeah, that was it.
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:47.680]  Okay, see, Watson did that, complaining and mumbling, but he did a great job.
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:53.920]  Watson, that's why I need my magic, man, you found it, good job, red coat, by the way.
[1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:56.160]  Log about this right away after I checked the head.
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:37:01.080]  By the way, Paul, you know the British government has now announced they want to use the army
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:05.480]  and police quote during economic collapses, so you have the same thing going on there.
[1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:12.040]  Well, listen to this, Alex, there was a Channel 4 news segment last night with the top general
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:21.000]  from Port and Down, an army general who said, let me get the exact quote here, he said the
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:26.520]  quote, we have to upgrade and enhance, review, renew our activities in recent times because
[1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:33.320]  of increased civilian resilience, and that's the top general of the Port and Down Bio Weapons
[1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:37.080]  facility in England, he said that on Channel 4 news last night.
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:42.640]  And the British Ministry of Defense 10-year battle plan, they call it what they're prospectus,
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:47.720]  this declassified version, almost 200 pages admitted, the military's job is for the elite
[1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:54.720]  to suppress the populations who are going to be basically turned into poppers in a neo-feudal
[1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:55.720]  state.
[1:37:55.720 --> 1:37:57.560]  Watson, what's the name of that British Ministry of Defense report?
[1:37:57.560 --> 1:37:59.560]  I forget it.
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:04.680]  It doesn't spring to mind at the moment, London Guarding and First Broke, but they had a hyperlink
[1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:05.680]  to it.
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:07.160]  Yeah, it was in the London Guarding.
[1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:13.120]  I want our researchers to post everything on this, all of it now, at Prison Planet as
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:14.120]  we work for team.
[1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:15.120]  Paul Watson, thank you.
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:16.120]  Thanks, Ollie.
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:17.120]  Thank you.
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:18.120]  Paul, are you going to Julio's D?
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:22.360]  No, I don't live in that area anymore, it's a new restaurant.
[1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:23.840]  Where are you going, Paul?
[1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:28.640]  It's called West 10, if you want to.
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:30.920]  Paul can join him there and he'd say hi to Eon for me.
[1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:32.240]  All right, there goes Watson.
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:33.240]  I'm out of control.
[1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:36.840]  Nami Wolf, you have the floor, go through the steps, your new book, the new video, and
[1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:37.840]  the points you're making.
[1:38:37.840 --> 1:38:39.480]  I have done a classic, Alex Jones.
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:40.480]  Go ahead.
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:41.480]  Sure thing.
[1:38:41.480 --> 1:38:46.360]  Well, you know, I'm grateful to you and it is, I guess what I do want to say is we're
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:51.200]  in a time where this kind of brainstorming amongst citizens, not just us, but you know,
[1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:56.720]  all of my readers, all of your listeners and readers and viewers.
[1:38:56.720 --> 1:39:01.760]  We all have access to information that we need to educate one another about and use
[1:39:01.760 --> 1:39:06.160]  our critical intelligence about it and find solutions among ourselves because clearly
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:11.920]  we can no longer trust many of our state-supported or corporate-supported institutions to do
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:12.920]  it for us.
[1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:16.480]  So this is exactly what people should be doing across the country is bringing each other
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:19.720]  information and checking it out and planning for action.
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:25.840]  So very quickly, the 10 steps, well, invoke a terrifying internal and external threat,
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:31.160]  often a real one, create a prison system outside the rule of law where torture takes place,
[1:39:31.160 --> 1:39:35.600]  develop a paramilitary force, not answerable to the people, create a surveillance apparatus
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:40.800]  aimed at ordinary citizens, start to infiltrate and harass citizens' groups, start to target
[1:39:40.800 --> 1:39:45.840]  key individuals, start to arbitrarily detain and release citizens, you start to create
[1:39:45.840 --> 1:39:46.840]  legislation.
[1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:47.840]  We're seeing it more and more.
[1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:55.320]  You mentioned the RNC-8 legislation that criminalizes speech or expands the definition
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:40:02.120]  of terrorist or traitor or spy so that ordinary citizens who are engaged in dissent get criminalized
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:05.880]  and you start to see restrictions at the press like the arrests of journalists we spoke
[1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:06.880]  about.
[1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:11.640]  And finally, we're at step 10, which is the birth rule of law and make it easier to declare
[1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:12.640]  martial law.
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:19.000]  And so to just make sure that I tell you the hopeful news, it's that I did, since we last
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  spoke, Alex, study times and places where citizens effectively fought back against encroaching
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.080]  darkness of this kind.
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:34.760]  And so I learned what always works and I offer citizens and give me liberty, which is a sequel
[1:40:34.760 --> 1:40:40.360]  to the end of America, which is just out now, exactly those lessons from other times and
[1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:44.720]  places where citizens did fight back as real patriots and revolutionaries.
[1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:51.240]  But I also go to the founding generation, ordinary people from All Walks of Life, who
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:54.760]  were captivated by the vision of liberty we were supposed to inherit.
[1:40:54.760 --> 1:40:59.560]  And I go back to the seven core principles we're supposed to hold on to as Americans
[1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:04.120]  in a time of crisis like this and in a time where we're being bombarded with what I call
[1:41:04.120 --> 1:41:09.960]  fake patriotism to accept what I call a fake democracy, a sham of a democracy.
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:14.640]  And finally, I give citizens, at the end of Give Me Liberty, 55 action steps they can
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:21.520]  take in building this new army, a transpartisan army of patriot revolutionaries, taking back
[1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:23.120]  the power that we should be having.
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:25.240]  Well, I love that term, transpartisan.
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:27.120]  Yeah, it's important.
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:28.120]  No longer being.
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:33.520]  Okay, now go back to Posse Commentaris, the points you were trying to make earlier when
[1:41:33.520 --> 1:41:37.560]  I kind of went off the rabbit trail of ferreting documentation for you.
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:42.000]  And then later, I did find the AP article, and it's exactly as we said.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:48.080]  Well, I'm so glad, but in the meantime, just before I go back to it, why, I mean, I feel
[1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:54.840]  stupid asking you this because I'm in the mainstream media, but why aren't any mainstream
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:41:57.560]  news outlets covering the deployment of the First Brigade?
[1:41:57.560 --> 1:42:04.680]  Do you feel you just filed a freedom of information request demanding to know where they are and
[1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:05.960]  what they're here for?
[1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:11.040]  But I'm just gobsmacked that there's no independent reporting, and the one thing I was wondering
[1:42:11.040 --> 1:42:12.040]  is, do you think it's classified?
[1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:17.040]  I mean, are journalists in a position that they're not reporting on it because it's considered
[1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:18.040]  classified?
[1:42:18.040 --> 1:42:19.040]  Yeah.
[1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:20.040]  What's your view of this?
[1:42:20.040 --> 1:42:26.400]  Yes, and we have the classified documents fell into our hands because an FBI agent,
[1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:33.840]  on the day before Thanksgiving, just south of Temple on I-35, the army came up and told
[1:42:33.840 --> 1:42:38.000]  Mike Hansen, my camera guy who was driving back from visiting family, to turn his camera
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  off and Mike refused.
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:44.360]  So the FBI showed up an hour later and gave him classified documents by accident.
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:45.360]  And then-
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:46.360]  Are you serious?
[1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:47.360]  No, no, no.
[1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:50.680]  They had, and they had gotten Mike's number that they had asked for, and he gave it.
[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:54.880]  They called a few hours later after he left his cell phone demanding it back.
[1:42:54.880 --> 1:42:57.280]  In fact, get me Mike Hansen.
[1:42:57.280 --> 1:43:00.280]  I'm going to, later in the next hour, we'll get Mike on.
[1:43:00.280 --> 1:43:03.360]  I mean, there's video all this now, I mean, it's on video.
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:07.080]  The FBI pulling up and giving it to him, they completely screwed up.
[1:43:07.080 --> 1:43:11.120]  Right, but why, how does this go to why journalists aren't covering the deployment of the First
[1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:12.720]  Brigade?
[1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:14.120]  Because they're editors.
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:19.280]  I mean, it came out that Bush has spent billions of years on fake news reporters and Operation
[1:43:19.280 --> 1:43:20.280]  Mockingbird.
[1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:26.760]  But again, in intelligence, and I know you know this, I'm just for the audience, and
[1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:27.760]  I know most of them know it.
[1:43:27.760 --> 1:43:32.920]  The point is, in intelligence, you can always hear the official propaganda from the mountaintop,
[1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:37.680]  but then you can go on the ground and, and, and assess it and observe it.
[1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:41.360]  And I mean, I remember in 1999, going to Urban Warrior, this is bipartisan.
[1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:45.520]  This is, this is a military industrial complex, COG, Continued Government.
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:50.880]  And there are the Marines training with role players, over 200 of them with foreign troops,
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:54.320]  screaming, I'm an American, please don't knock the camp, and then the Marines were allowing
[1:43:54.320 --> 1:43:55.320]  me to videotape.
[1:43:55.320 --> 1:43:58.800]  Well, well, well, first off, let me explain this.
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:02.920]  They had journalist tours to the part of the city, and a university that was shut down
[1:44:02.920 --> 1:44:06.000]  for the urban warfare drills, practicing taking over an American city.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:12.520]  And for journalists, they would say, this is for Bosnia, this is for Macedonia.
[1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:17.040]  But then, but then I sent people in, local activists, because they knew who I was, the
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:18.600]  Marines wouldn't let me get in there.
[1:44:18.600 --> 1:44:22.540]  I sent an activist posing as citizens who wanted a tour.
[1:44:22.540 --> 1:44:25.600]  And for them, they would show Marines doing interrogations.
[1:44:25.600 --> 1:44:26.600]  Where are you from?
[1:44:26.600 --> 1:44:27.600]  I'm from San Francisco.
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:33.080]  I used to get the weapons and, and so then I would watch this all on video, by the way.
[1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:38.400]  So we sent infiltrators in and then I had this former Marine Corps captain who was in
[1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:39.400]  private.
[1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:42.160]  He was their PR guy, Steve Jones, following me.
[1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:46.160]  He's on video running up saying, get out of here, Jones, you know, trying to block me
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:51.640]  when I'm at the fence videoing, but little did he know I had people inside the cordoned
[1:44:51.640 --> 1:44:52.640]  off area.
[1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:56.600]  They had 2000 Marines, foreign troops, tanks, helicopters.
[1:44:56.600 --> 1:45:01.600]  It was so shocking with the Coronado landing, the amphibious attack ship with the amphibious
[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:06.560]  craft landing in Oakland that I put it out and people couldn't believe it.
[1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:10.760]  They thought I had hired tanks, helicopters and armies.
[1:45:10.760 --> 1:45:12.320]  I've got a hand at you, Alex.
[1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:13.680]  You are very resourceful.
[1:45:13.680 --> 1:45:14.680]  That's extraordinary.
[1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:22.320]  I mean, I could see just to be kind of measured because this is really a time to kind of triple
[1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:28.080]  think everything, not to hold us back, but I could see a legitimate government with legitimate
[1:45:28.080 --> 1:45:37.320]  interest in its citizens' well-being doing a mock evacuation scenario out of good intentions.
[1:45:37.320 --> 1:45:44.240]  But what I'm hearing more and more about the deployment and why now after 200 years, and
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:49.920]  I just posted a piece on BuzzFlashthatPeopleCanRead where I quote members of military circles
[1:45:49.920 --> 1:45:55.520]  and police forces and National Guard saying, hey, wait a minute, why do we need these soldiers
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:45:58.360]  since the National Guard can do this?
[1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:02.560]  We've got police forces who can do this, and we've got emergency people trained in evacuation
[1:46:02.560 --> 1:46:04.600]  who can do this.
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:07.320]  Many people are raising a hue and cry, so obviously, yeah.
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:08.320]  They'll make it.
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:09.320]  Yeah.
[1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:10.320]  No, go ahead.
[1:46:10.320 --> 1:46:17.200]  The last thing I wanted to say is what chills me particularly is I have this wonderful heroic
[1:46:17.200 --> 1:46:23.840]  patriotic American major from the Air Force, David Antune, who's a hero whom I interviewed
[1:46:23.840 --> 1:46:25.440]  in Give Me Liberty.
[1:46:25.440 --> 1:46:30.040]  He stood up to the Bush administration and his whole family's on the watch list now.
[1:46:30.040 --> 1:46:37.160]  But I said to him, because I'm a civilian, I said, so, Major Antune, if the, first he
[1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:41.800]  explained to me that these warriors don't answer to Congress, they don't answer to people,
[1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:46.000]  they answer to the president, and I said, so if the president says, arrest these citizens,
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  what happens?
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  And he said, they have to do it.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:50.840]  And I said, well, if the president says, arrest Congress, what happens?
[1:46:50.840 --> 1:46:52.000]  And he said, they have to do it.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:58.280]  And I said, well, senior members of the military say, you know, don't obey these orders.
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:46:59.280]  What happens?
[1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:02.920]  And he said, well, they get arrested because these orders, the horror is these orders are
[1:47:02.920 --> 1:47:03.920]  not illegal.
[1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:06.480]  Soldiers are allowed to just obey illegal orders.
[1:47:06.480 --> 1:47:07.480]  They are now legal.
[1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:08.480]  What they are is immoral.
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:13.160]  Yeah, but those signing statements have been thrown out on his face, and there's no fewer
[1:47:13.160 --> 1:47:18.320]  precept or Nixon saying, you know, it's not illegal when the president does it, the Congress
[1:47:18.320 --> 1:47:19.320]  is co-equal.
[1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:24.280]  And just because Lincoln arrested a few members of Congress, that was later thrown out of court,
[1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:27.480]  but that was done retroactively, and newspaper editors.
[1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:33.600]  So Congress is co-equal, just like PDD 51, the Homeland Security Committee this year
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:38.080]  wanted to see it, and the executive said, no, you can't, but the cover shoot says that
[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:39.960]  Bush is basically dictator.
[1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:45.920]  So on its face, that is a fraud, and unfortunately the media is spinning what you're saying
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:49.320]  as you're saying George Bush will do this by the election.
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:52.760]  And what I get from what you're saying is, no, this apparatus has been set up, and the
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:59.200]  office of the presidency has built this around itself, whether it's Barack Obama or whether
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:02.040]  it's John McCain, this threat continues.
[1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:03.040]  Can you speak to that?
[1:48:03.040 --> 1:48:04.040]  Sure.
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:11.520]  And, you know, let me stress, how can I put this, it's really important for us to understand,
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:12.520]  to think differently.
[1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:17.560]  We're not in, you know, constitutional republic time now, we're in police state time in the
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:24.080]  sense that it doesn't have to happen at a certain time frame for it to be a dangerous
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:25.080]  precedent.
[1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:29.080]  I mean, that's what, and I'm not being a radical extremist in saying this, this is how the
[1:48:29.080 --> 1:48:31.360]  founders wanted us to think.
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:38.160]  They wanted us to be just as freaked out that, you know, that the president has irrigated
[1:48:38.160 --> 1:48:42.960]  a private army to himself, whether or not he does anything with that private army before
[1:48:42.960 --> 1:48:47.240]  the election, after the election, they want us to freak out that that has taken place
[1:48:47.240 --> 1:48:53.200]  because it upends this delicate system of checks and balances, and this absolutely delicate
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:57.360]  fabric of freedom that we have in America or that we're supposed to have, in which,
[1:48:57.360 --> 1:49:02.280]  you know, we do not face soldiers, you know, on our streets, in our homes, terrifying us
[1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:07.080]  because you can have all the institutions of civil society intact, you can have a judiciary,
[1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:13.240]  you can have newspapers, you can have, you know, a parliamentary or a Congress, but if
[1:49:13.240 --> 1:49:18.840]  you've got soldiers, you know, look at Italy in 1920, look at Germany in 3031, 32, they
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:23.600]  were still parliamentary democracies, but the brown shirts or the black shirts were deployed,
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:27.960]  you know, to beat up this editor in Milan or to, you know, intimidate these voters in
[1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:31.440]  Prugina or to line the halls of the Reichstag, you know, in Germany.
[1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:33.120]  That's right, it was, it's their menacing...
[1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:34.520]  It's their intimidation.
[1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:37.000]  It's their menacing and intimidating the Congress.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:41.960]  Naomi, did you know that members of Congress on the day of the bailout were threatened
[1:49:41.960 --> 1:49:47.040]  that Friday with physical martial law if they did not pass the bailout plan?
[1:49:47.040 --> 1:49:52.360]  Well, to speak to me more about that, because I'm having a very interesting experience,
[1:49:52.360 --> 1:49:54.280]  I'm glad to be speaking to you about it.
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:49:57.800]  John, pull up the Congressman, we had him on air, too.
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:03.160]  That, that I know, I've been following this, and actually I mentioned it, Alex, in a radio
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:08.200]  interview that was posted on YouTube that went very, very viral, in which I was saying,
[1:50:08.200 --> 1:50:12.840]  look at the first brigade and look at what Brad Sherman has said in C-SPAN about, you
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:16.080]  know, individual members of the house being threatened with, quote, unquote, martial law
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:18.240]  in America if the bailout bill doesn't have...
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:23.360]  I mean, there you have it, though, this is the menacing, the out-of-control criminal
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:28.960]  executive looting everything, taking trillions, not 700 billion, into offshore corporations
[1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:29.960]  and banks.
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:30.960]  I mean, this is it, it's here.
[1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:32.840]  We're, we're under martial law now.
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:39.840]  Alex, Alex, before we, I mean, yes, in the sense of, how can I put this, I want to be
[1:50:39.840 --> 1:50:47.360]  a little bit, I want to be a little bit, how can I put it, more measured, because I don't
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:49.000]  want people to conclude that it's over.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:52.640]  I want people to conclude that the crime is right, the right to rise up, and they're
[1:50:52.640 --> 1:50:57.760]  trying to implement it incrementally with, hey, the Army's here to help people get out
[1:50:57.760 --> 1:50:58.760]  of wrecked cars.
[1:50:58.760 --> 1:50:59.760]  Exactly, exactly.
[1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:00.760]  Again, that's the...
[1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:03.280]  Oh, look, the Army's here to help get us out of the broke-down car.
[1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:04.280]  It's the self-coup.
[1:51:04.280 --> 1:51:05.280]  It's the self-coup.
[1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:09.200]  But do we have a second source for the Brad Sherman assertion, has he confirmed it?
[1:51:09.200 --> 1:51:12.880]  Yes, no, no, I had Brad Sherman on and I talked to other members of Congress who will not
[1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:16.680]  come on the show, and they said that, no, they were told, martial law is going to be declared
[1:51:16.680 --> 1:51:17.680]  if you don't do this.
[1:51:17.680 --> 1:51:18.680]  Wow.
[1:51:18.680 --> 1:51:24.520]  I mean, I had Brad Sherman on the show, and he, by the way, is a lawyer, a specialist
[1:51:24.520 --> 1:51:25.520]  on all this.
[1:51:25.520 --> 1:51:28.520]  Stay there now, I mean, well, we're going to continue to talk about this.
[1:51:28.520 --> 1:51:30.960]  In fact, I'm just going to skip this.

[1:52:28.400 --> 1:52:29.400]  9-11 was an inside job.

[1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:33.400]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the President of the United States, and
[1:52:33.400 --> 1:52:34.400]  the United States.
[1:52:34.400 --> 1:52:35.400]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:52:35.400 --> 1:52:36.400]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:52:36.400 --> 1:52:37.400]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:52:37.400 --> 1:52:39.400]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:42.400]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a state.
[1:52:42.400 --> 1:52:47.400]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CIFR.
[1:52:47.400 --> 1:52:53.400]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of justice
[1:52:53.400 --> 1:52:55.400]  to grow at our own door.
[1:52:55.400 --> 1:53:02.400]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:53:02.400 --> 1:53:04.400]  An inside job?
[1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:05.400]  How dare you?
[1:53:05.400 --> 1:53:06.400]  I don't think we can do it.
[1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:07.400]  It's just an intro.
[1:53:07.400 --> 1:53:08.400]  It's 9-11.
[1:53:08.400 --> 1:53:12.400]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:14.400]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:19.400]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[1:53:19.400 --> 1:53:20.400]  anniversary of 9-11.
[1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:21.400]  Please rise.

[1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:29.400]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:53:29.400 --> 1:53:33.400]  Do you take nutritional supplements but don't notice any benefits?
[1:53:33.400 --> 1:53:38.400]  The problem is today's supplements contain things like DL-alpha tocopherol, a synthetic
[1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:43.400]  form of vitamin E derived from petroleum, or ferrous fumarate, an inorganic form of iron
[1:53:43.400 --> 1:53:45.400]  that can actually damage your body.
[1:53:45.400 --> 1:53:50.400]  Most of today's vitamin and mineral supplements are actually stressing your liver and kidneys.
[1:53:50.400 --> 1:53:54.400]  Find out what nutritionist Steven Heuer has learned from 30 years of extensive research.

[1:54:55.400 --> 1:55:03.400]  And you're just a little kid, so Cyrus Jones lived forever.
[1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:17.400]  Grave digger, when you dig my grave, would you make a shallow so I can feel the rain?
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:24.400]  Grave digger.
[1:55:24.400 --> 1:55:29.400]  Neural stonewall, 1953 to 1954.
[1:55:29.400 --> 1:55:32.400]  She lost both her babies and the second...
[1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:35.400]  It's the old frog in the pot analogy.
[1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:39.400]  We were on a three in the record scale with Marshall Lobb back in 98.
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:42.400]  We're about a six and a half right now.
[1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:48.400]  Maybe a seven with the announces, the announcement of these brigades.
[1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:57.400]  But also in road to tyranny, I interviewed a Marine Corps captain who saw an army checkpoint at I-35 in 2000 and got mad.
[1:55:57.400 --> 1:56:00.400]  He contacted me, showed me all the documents.
[1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:10.400]  They had secret programs in the late 80s with Marines dressing up in police uniforms in Norfolk, Virginia, doing gun raids and drug raids.
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:14.400]  So they've been covertly doing this for a long time now, Naomi.
[1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:21.400]  And it goes back to Rex 84, but please continue with all your great research as we continue to collate more information here on air.
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:29.400]  What I just wanted to say from my point of view is that when we say we're at seven in terms of martial law,
[1:56:29.400 --> 1:56:43.400]  I think the thing that I want us to think about is that part of what gets us to seven is, say, the deployment of troops or passage of laws like the Defense Authorization Act of 2007 and so on.
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:50.400]  But part of what gets us to seven and eight and beyond is people's complacency in the face of it.
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:55.400]  So to me, the psychological piece of how we receive this is very, very important.
[1:56:55.400 --> 1:56:59.400]  And this is, again, why I went back to the founders and the founding generation.
[1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:01.400]  We really have to...
[1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:11.400]  What I learned from the research I did in Give Me Liberty is that you can't reclaim liberty without a psychological shift in ordinary people first.
[1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:18.400]  What I learned is that America is supposed to be not a land mass and not a system of government primarily,
[1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:24.400]  but first a psychological state in which there's an inner sense of freedom, an inner commitment to freedom,
[1:57:24.400 --> 1:57:31.400]  and a personal conviction to be outraged and not stand for it when tyranny and oppression raise their heads.
[1:57:31.400 --> 1:57:41.400]  And I did find that we are being brainwashed now, not just the last eight years, which have been dramatic, but the last 30 years, in a messaging about what it called fake patriotism,
[1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:48.400]  where, for instance, we're taught that life-liberating the pursuit of happiness, which is interpreted as kind of just relax and shop,
[1:57:48.400 --> 1:57:50.400]  is the meaning of the Declaration of Independence.
[1:57:50.400 --> 1:57:59.400]  But in fact, Alex, the second paragraph, we're never taught, which is that the Declaration of Independence is actually a personal commitment
[1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:06.400]  demanded of each and every American to stand up against tyranny and oppression wherever it raises its head,
[1:58:06.400 --> 1:58:14.400]  but also to confront and bring down the government if it engages in repression and tyranny against the people, in a war against the people.
[1:58:14.400 --> 1:58:17.400]  We're committed to being revolutionaries as Americans.
[1:58:17.400 --> 1:58:21.400]  There's just been this 30-year messaging.
[1:58:21.400 --> 1:58:24.400]  It's so much deeper than just this deployment.
[1:58:24.400 --> 1:58:28.400]  It's been like this messaging to get us to go to sleep, get us to forget our rights.
[1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:34.400]  We found out that civics education is disappearing from half of U.S. high schools.
[1:58:34.400 --> 1:58:41.400]  Kids are going to college now, not knowing what a republic is supposed to look like, not knowing what their liberties are,
[1:58:41.400 --> 1:58:44.400]  let alone recognizing them being threatened.
[1:58:44.400 --> 1:58:50.400]  We're being told that patriotism is about never criticizing the government or supporting any military intervention,
[1:58:50.400 --> 1:58:57.400]  whereas I discovered that the great Americans, the great patriots, held a mirror up to America, and that's what we're supposed to do.
[1:58:57.400 --> 1:59:02.400]  I really want to stress the first shift for us is to be outraged when we hear about the deployment,
[1:59:02.400 --> 1:59:07.400]  to be outraged when we see this war against citizens and to take on this.
[1:59:07.400 --> 1:59:10.400]  Yes, stay there. Stay there. We'll be right back in one minute.
[1:59:11.400 --> 1:59:14.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:59:14.400 --> 1:59:18.400]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:26.400]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:59:26.400 --> 1:59:30.400]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:59:30.400 --> 1:59:32.400]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:59:32.400 --> 1:59:35.400]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:59:35.400 --> 1:59:42.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:59:42.400 --> 1:59:49.400]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:59:49.400 --> 1:59:53.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:53.400 --> 2:00:00.400]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:05.400]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.
[2:00:05.400 --> 2:00:13.400]  Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:00:13.400 --> 2:00:39.400]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[2:00:39.400 --> 2:00:46.400]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:51.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:51.400 --> 2:00:59.400]  By the way, since the start of the show two hours ago, we've been live at prisonplanet.tv with Willie Nelson, down to Emmy Wolfe.
[2:00:59.400 --> 2:01:06.400]  Here's Wired Magazine two weeks ago. Army orders pain ray trucks. New report shows potential for death.
[2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:11.400]  The Army's own reports admit this ray actually kills you.
[2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:15.400]  And it has the control to turn it into a narrow beam and kill you.
[2:01:15.400 --> 2:01:19.400]  And it's got a picture of the weapons being deployed in the United States.
[2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:24.400]  And I just gave you the quotes from the AP with the head of the Air Force saying, use it on the American people first.
[2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:37.400]  Willie Nelson, Wired Magazine 12 was a bestselling author, journalist, won all sorts of awards. We are here talking about how this is the office of the executive claiming it runs everything.
[2:01:37.400 --> 2:01:43.400]  They brainwashed the military, the military you talk to, who are against this go well with the Commander-in-Chief says, I got to do it.
[2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:48.400]  I'll shoot Americans. I'll arrest Congress. That's not true.
[2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:54.400]  Nixon again said, well, when the president breaks the law, it's not breaking the law. Well, you saw what happened there.
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:01:59.400]  So very, very serious. I want to take calls coming up in this hour for Naomi Wolfe.
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:05.400]  I want to talk about her new book and solutions that her book gets into and also the new video covering all this.
[2:02:05.400 --> 2:02:09.400]  She's a very influential lady and very intelligent. We're really glad that she has the courage to get into all this.
[2:02:09.400 --> 2:02:12.400]  And we're going to send her more of this information.
[2:02:12.400 --> 2:02:17.400]  But here it is, potential for death. And Naomi, what do you think of them apples?
[2:02:17.400 --> 2:02:23.400]  Potential for death. I mean, you know, terrifying and yet not surprising.
[2:02:23.400 --> 2:02:33.400]  Because once you see footage, which is one so concerned about the election, of, you know, a handful of angry voters who've just been encouraged from the rolls,
[2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:43.400]  you know, speaking up and being tazored to death accidentally or in defense or, you know, being quote unquote subdued by, you know, these lethal and non-lethal technologies,
[2:02:43.400 --> 2:02:47.400]  which the initial Army Times report said that the First Brigade had.
[2:02:47.400 --> 2:02:50.400]  And they now have mass tasers? They now have mass tasers?
[2:02:50.400 --> 2:02:52.400]  What? You're telling me they have mass tasers?
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:55.400]  Yeah, it's a big taser. They roll out that shoots a bunch of cords out.
[2:02:55.400 --> 2:03:04.400]  Oh, Alex, really, I can't, you know, it's like, just when I think I've reached, you know, I understand where we are.
[2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:07.400]  You bring up new information that takes it one step further.
[2:03:07.400 --> 2:03:16.400]  All right, so, you know, all we need is some repeating footage on CNN or Fox News of, you know, five Americans, you know, in the street,
[2:03:16.400 --> 2:03:23.400]  brutally wounded or worse from these technologies, and then you can still have, as I've learned, you know, all the trappings of civil society intact,
[2:03:23.400 --> 2:03:25.400]  but people just go quiet, you know, understandably.
[2:03:25.400 --> 2:03:33.400]  I mean, you know, if there's military standing outside the polling booth, you're a lot less inclined to argue vociferously with,
[2:03:33.400 --> 2:03:38.400]  you know, the registrar, if you and all your neighbors have been purchased from the rules.
[2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:43.400]  Well, I think Barack Obama is going to come into office, and then I think the left's going to be completely co-opted.
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:49.400]  I don't have to go into him saying he wouldn't go for wiretapping or he didn't go to war and flip-flopping.
[2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:53.400]  I mean, the Wall Street money's on him. This is giving him left cover.
[2:03:53.400 --> 2:03:58.400]  The left, the main line left, is suddenly going to love FEMA camps and master rest.
[2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:03.400]  Oh, God, you don't think so. The main line left will be the ones to know right in the front lines.
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:05.400]  I mean, they'll be targeted.
[2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:11.400]  So let me just say for your audience, because people have rightly said,
[2:04:11.400 --> 2:04:17.400]  when will Alex Jones persuade Naomi Wolf that she needs to be on the left-right paradigm?
[2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:24.400]  And I have to say, you all are making a lot of headway with me, because while I still believe that an Obama presidency
[2:04:24.400 --> 2:04:28.400]  at least will staunch the immediate decline into a police state,
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:33.400]  I've also been saying in public again and again that it is going to be business as usual
[2:04:33.400 --> 2:04:39.400]  in the sense that unless there's an enraged bipartisan, transpartisan citizens' movement
[2:04:39.400 --> 2:04:45.400]  to restore liberty and the Constitution, here's why. Barack Obama, with these rights,
[2:04:45.400 --> 2:04:50.400]  is going to be tempted to use them just as the Founders knew any leader will.
[2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:55.400]  And the trillions of dollars to be made in surveillance and security technologies
[2:04:55.400 --> 2:05:00.400]  by vested interests who benefit from a police state have the same pressures on him
[2:05:00.400 --> 2:05:02.400]  that they would on any other candidate.
[2:05:02.400 --> 2:05:07.400]  So it is going to be up to us as citizens to hold any leader's feet to the fire.
[2:05:07.400 --> 2:05:13.400]  I would rather have a constitutional anyone than an unconstitutional Democrat in office.
[2:05:13.400 --> 2:05:17.400]  Naomi Wolf, our guest for the next 15 minutes.
