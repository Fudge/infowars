[00:00.000 --> 00:10.520]  I did talk to the team and we have a couple of things that I just want to lay out for
[00:10.520 --> 00:16.720]  all of you and on what the DC bill does, it reduces maximum penalties for offenses like
[00:16.720 --> 00:23.160]  murders and other homicides, armed home invasion burglaries, armed car jackings, as I mentioned,
[00:23.160 --> 00:27.320]  armed robberies, unlawful gun possession and some sexual assault offenses.
[00:27.320 --> 00:33.400]  And together we're saying loud and clearly that in America, hate and extremism will
[00:33.400 --> 00:38.480]  not prevail, although they are wearing their ugly head in significance now.
[00:38.480 --> 00:42.200]  Although they are wearing their ugly head in significance now.
[00:42.200 --> 00:51.640]  This issue that I don't cover enough because I know at one level it's just going to create
[00:51.640 --> 00:56.400]  division and that's not what we need when we all love each other, but you can't address
[00:56.400 --> 01:00.840]  a problem if the corporate media continues to cover it up and censor those that expose
[01:00.840 --> 01:01.840]  it.
[01:01.840 --> 01:06.040]  But every time I hear about a mass shooting or some big death and I notice that they have
[01:06.040 --> 01:09.880]  the suspect in custody, they won't ever show the picture.
[01:09.880 --> 01:14.680]  I go, well, I know why and know why this story is going to go away real quick because it's
[01:14.680 --> 01:15.680]  not a white person.
[01:15.680 --> 01:20.280]  So it isn't about demonizing the black people that a small minority of them are committing
[01:20.280 --> 01:24.040]  the disproportionate majority of these type of violent crimes.
[01:24.040 --> 01:29.040]  It's about not letting the Justice Department, since Biden got in two years ago, joining
[01:29.040 --> 01:33.640]  the whole Hollywood ADL narrative that white people are the most vicious out of control
[01:33.640 --> 01:35.200]  criminals everywhere.
[01:35.200 --> 01:41.800]  Officials say that Peyton Gendron, a white 18 year old man, this hateful act and other
[01:41.800 --> 01:48.160]  similar hateful acts across the country, motivated by white supremacy.
[01:48.160 --> 01:54.520]  A white supremacist who has engaged in an act of terrorism.
[01:54.520 --> 02:00.240]  It's not fair to lie about white people as a group and say we're bad terrorists and
[02:00.240 --> 02:06.240]  then cover up young black males committing the majority, the majority of violent crime.
[02:06.240 --> 02:09.680]  And most black males don't do that and they're hard working good people and they don't deserve
[02:09.680 --> 02:10.680]  it.
[02:10.680 --> 02:15.320]  If you could talk to any of the people who walked into your business and set that place
[02:15.320 --> 02:17.680]  on fire, what would you tell them?
[02:17.680 --> 02:21.640]  Put yourself in our shoes, you know, this could be one of your family members, this
[02:21.640 --> 02:25.720]  could be your mom, your dad, your uncle, your brother or sister, you know, this could be
[02:25.720 --> 02:29.600]  one of your family members that had their own business that was burned down to the ground.
[02:29.600 --> 02:33.920]  Just like white people don't deserve to be blamed for what some other white person does,
[02:33.920 --> 02:37.640]  but when a white person goes out and commits a mass shooting, you don't ever stop hearing
[02:37.640 --> 02:43.080]  about it forever and how all white people and how all gun owners are collectively to
[02:43.080 --> 02:44.080]  blame.
[02:44.080 --> 02:50.840]  Why is America 30% white guys and 70% of the shootings in the last many decades have been
[02:50.840 --> 02:51.840]  at the hands of white guys?
[02:51.840 --> 02:55.360]  I'm not saying we should racially profile white guys, but I do think it's interesting
[02:55.360 --> 03:02.400]  to note that had the shooters, had 70% of mass shooters been let's say Arabs or African-American
[03:02.400 --> 03:06.000]  men, I think the conversation right now would be a very different conversation.
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.000]  That's preposterous.
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.600]  Three killed, a mother, a nine year old and a news camera person and as soon as it didn't
[03:14.600 --> 03:20.920]  say what the person's race was, I knew it was not a white person.
[03:20.920 --> 03:25.200]  Sure enough, I put the shooter's name in, it's a young black man.
[03:25.200 --> 03:30.800]  So in less than two years, 18 and 19, he's 19 and a half, he's got a big old giant armed
[03:30.800 --> 03:36.960]  robbery crime rap sheet and he's on the streets because of these Soros prosecutors and then
[03:36.960 --> 03:42.920]  he goes and kills people who are totally innocent, including a nine year old girl and a camera
[03:42.920 --> 03:46.640]  person who responded to another shooting in the area.
[03:46.640 --> 03:51.800]  Hell, he'll probably be out in five years, all because he's quote black.
[03:51.800 --> 03:56.720]  By the way, the shooter in Florida a few years ago that shot all those people to a public
[03:56.720 --> 04:01.320]  school because his last name was Cruz, he was adopted, he was white because his last
[04:01.320 --> 04:08.040]  name was Cruz, despite a rap sheet again about two inches thick of violence and robbery and
[04:08.040 --> 04:17.200]  death threats, he was released with no time served because his last name was Cruz by the
[04:17.200 --> 04:25.200]  minority quote reform program in Florida and carried out in Broward County, they could
[04:25.200 --> 04:30.800]  go kill all those people and the left knows exactly what they're doing.
[04:30.800 --> 04:35.220]  They always accuse you of the very things they're doing themselves.
[04:35.220 --> 04:39.640]  If there's one rule you can keep on your fridge, write it down, put it in your wallet to evaluate
[04:39.640 --> 04:45.480]  the behavior of the people in charge, it's that they blame you for their sins every single
[04:45.480 --> 04:46.480]  time.
[04:46.480 --> 04:52.560]  So if you ever get in trouble in your white, just identify as black or Hispanic and you
[04:52.560 --> 05:01.280]  can get out of jail free.
[05:01.280 --> 05:05.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World is a historic
[05:05.240 --> 05:09.560]  book that documents the globals and their own words planned for our future that is the
[05:09.560 --> 05:10.560]  hellish future.
[05:10.560 --> 05:14.360]  Now you'll be always while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[05:14.360 --> 05:18.360]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[05:18.360 --> 05:22.520]  Amazon or info or short.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of
[05:22.520 --> 05:27.360]  the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them
[05:27.360 --> 05:28.360]  right now.
[05:28.360 --> 05:32.920]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at info or
[05:32.920 --> 05:37.760]  short.com and there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[05:37.760 --> 05:41.360]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know
[05:41.360 --> 05:43.280]  that you help keep info words on the air.
[05:43.280 --> 05:46.840]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[05:46.840 --> 05:51.800]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to info or short.com
[05:51.800 --> 05:56.600]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple unsigned copies and go to the library or give them
[05:56.600 --> 05:57.600]  to the local school.
[05:57.600 --> 06:17.760]  This is an info war, I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[06:17.760 --> 06:24.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance live from the info wars
[06:24.880 --> 06:26.640]  dot com studios.
[06:26.640 --> 06:38.960]  It's Alex Jones, ladies and gentlemen, it's Wednesday, March 8th, 2023.
[06:38.960 --> 06:43.960]  And we always have final news information to cover, but today is particularly key.
[06:43.960 --> 06:47.800]  So many massive things have come to a head, I'm going to be listing all of those.
[06:47.800 --> 06:54.480]  Biden has officially rolled out the national plan for the digital central bank digital
[06:54.480 --> 06:59.720]  currency slave grid, the Chinese social credit score, the whole nine yards, we're going to
[06:59.720 --> 07:00.720]  be looking at that.
[07:00.720 --> 07:02.720]  It is so important.
[07:02.720 --> 07:07.160]  We also have Senator Rand Paul and others calling for criminal charges against Fauci.
[07:07.160 --> 07:13.880]  He's been caught red handed covering up gain of function and development of COVID-19 massive
[07:13.880 --> 07:24.200]  news, more antifa attacks around the country, a high level former Clinton operative current
[07:24.200 --> 07:29.320]  Clinton and Obama operative dies in another very mysterious way.
[07:29.320 --> 07:33.000]  There is so much we're going to get to here today.
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.320]  But the first thing I want to hit is January 6 of Tucker Carlson.
[07:37.320 --> 07:39.840]  This is much bigger than January 6.
[07:39.840 --> 07:41.400]  It's much bigger than Tucker Carlson.
[07:41.400 --> 07:48.520]  It's bigger than the federal government using Jan 6 to brand all populist or conservative
[07:48.520 --> 07:52.360]  or Christian internationalist movements as terrorist.
[07:52.360 --> 07:56.440]  It's about the end of free speech and the first amendment in this country and the murder
[07:56.440 --> 08:00.040]  of common sense.
[08:00.040 --> 08:03.160]  They're all over the news saying Tucker Carlson's rewriting history.
[08:03.160 --> 08:09.600]  Well, yeah, if the history is written falsely, and then you make new discoveries, whether
[08:09.600 --> 08:17.160]  they're archeological or in the current time, documentary evidence, you change the history.
[08:17.160 --> 08:24.160]  Just like science changes as they learn more and more and as it develops and unfolds.
[08:24.160 --> 08:32.800]  Now look, I talked to Tucker Carlson, and I'll leave it at that.
[08:32.800 --> 08:34.080]  And I talked to some of his crew.
[08:34.080 --> 08:35.080]  I'll leave it at that.
[08:35.080 --> 08:37.560]  Some of the crew was here two weeks ago.
[08:37.560 --> 08:41.320]  And the one big rule about Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club, and the other
[08:41.320 --> 08:44.120]  big rule about Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club.
[08:44.120 --> 08:46.360]  I talked to Joe Rogan basically every day.
[08:46.360 --> 08:51.160]  Don't really ever talk about it or get into it.
[08:51.160 --> 08:57.400]  Because those are personal relationships and I know what happened last night on Fox News.
[08:57.400 --> 08:58.400]  It's a big deal.
[08:58.400 --> 09:08.840]  But I purposely made the decision to not ask Tucker about it.
[09:08.840 --> 09:16.200]  That way I don't violate any of his work he's doing because I'm going to give him a chance
[09:16.200 --> 09:19.800]  to respond to what's happened in his own voice.
[09:19.800 --> 09:25.120]  But I did know what happened last night watching the show because I know how the show is produced.
[09:25.120 --> 09:30.800]  I know what was reportedly going to be on there last night, and it wasn't there.
[09:30.800 --> 09:37.560]  So I made some phone calls, and not to Tucker, and I confirmed that indeed what I thought
[09:37.560 --> 09:39.360]  was going on was going on.
[09:39.360 --> 09:45.200]  Steve Bannon figured it out too, I'll be on his show tomorrow morning, talking about this,
[09:45.200 --> 09:47.840]  and he contacted his sources and confirmed.
[09:47.840 --> 09:54.560]  So I really wasn't going to talk about this, but Cheryl Atkinson, very respected investigative
[09:54.560 --> 10:02.680]  journalist, has talked to her sources and confirmed it, so they call this parallel construction.
[10:02.680 --> 10:05.800]  Instead of getting it directly from Tucker, because I don't want to really violate our
[10:05.800 --> 10:09.480]  friendship like that, I don't want to leave him in this show production alone, I went
[10:09.480 --> 10:13.120]  ahead and got it from other people.
[10:13.120 --> 10:21.840]  And it's just, it's outrageous, and that's all I can say.
[10:21.840 --> 10:23.600]  It's huge.
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.520]  And it really is emblematic of the war going on in this country, and just how serious and
[10:28.520 --> 10:36.880]  intense it is if somebody like Joe Rogan, or Tucker Carlson, or Alex Jones, or Cheryl
[10:36.880 --> 10:41.960]  Atkinson is going to put it all on the line to bring you the truth, what ends up happening
[10:41.960 --> 10:42.960]  to them.
[10:42.960 --> 10:47.760]  But we saw one of the arts criminals, Shucky Schumer, get up there yesterday on the Senate
[10:47.760 --> 10:53.760]  floor and say, listen to me Murdoch, we're going to destroy Fox News, just like he told
[10:53.760 --> 10:57.760]  Trump, we're going to destroy you using the deep state, the intelligence agencies, if
[10:57.760 --> 11:03.360]  you don't shut Tucker down and not let him air what he's about to air tonight, because
[11:03.360 --> 11:09.640]  you know they got his phones tapped, you know they're spying on Carlson, no way he can run
[11:09.640 --> 11:15.040]  his show out of D.C. or New York, that's why he runs it out of Florida and Maine.
[11:15.040 --> 11:18.760]  And I'm not going to get into all the inside baseball about this today, I'm going to cover
[11:18.760 --> 11:24.120]  it at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to cover some other news before then, and then
[11:24.120 --> 11:26.760]  I'm going to cover what's really going on at the bottom of the hour, but here's the
[11:26.760 --> 11:34.560]  bottom line, the deep state muscled in and put incredible pressure on Tucker, who was
[11:34.560 --> 11:48.000]  bringing the goods yesterday, but he told me, and I know what they've got, and it was
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.200]  going to devastate the system, because just the footage we have is the federal informants
[11:55.200 --> 11:59.680]  and provocateurs staging and attacking in their own text messages that came out in January
[11:59.680 --> 12:04.480]  2016's commission saying they orchestrated the attacks like Ray Epps, but Tucker has
[12:04.480 --> 12:14.000]  the HD of the feds inside opening the doors, bringing the people in, and he focused on
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.440]  the lies on Monday night, he focused on a lot of other stuff last night like Capitol
[12:19.440 --> 12:22.000]  Police and how they basically were stood down.
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.480]  That was important, it's groundbreaking, and by what he's done is make it the main focal
[12:25.480 --> 12:29.200]  point of discussion, the top story in the United States the last three days, and so
[12:29.200 --> 12:33.040]  that's bringing forward all the research and news that's already there that proves this
[12:33.040 --> 12:46.160]  was a provocateur staged synthetic event, but the smoking gun information did not get
[12:46.160 --> 12:50.400]  out last night, and you could see the production where it was a bunch of filler and a bunch
[12:50.400 --> 12:56.440]  of other canned stories added, because the battle over what was going to air last night
[12:56.440 --> 13:04.680]  went on until very close to showtime, and so this is really emblematic of the struggle
[13:04.680 --> 13:09.800]  of the American people, the people of the world to know the truth, I mean this is footage
[13:09.800 --> 13:15.320]  that they wouldn't let people use in their trials like Q Shaman who was sentenced to
[13:15.320 --> 13:21.160]  four years in federal prison after spending a year and a half in jail, that's almost
[13:21.160 --> 13:28.440]  six years for being led in by the police and led in and brought into the Senate chambers
[13:28.440 --> 13:36.320]  and then he thanks them and says a prayer with them, maybe he gets a trespassing charge,
[13:36.320 --> 13:40.520]  but they let him in, I mean they wouldn't let him have that in trial, that's just one
[13:40.520 --> 13:46.280]  of the issues here, and they have 40 plus thousand hours of footage, just the footage
[13:46.280 --> 13:53.280]  we have from outside and inside is incredible, footage our reporter Sam Montoya shot of the
[13:53.280 --> 13:59.560]  police officer executing Ashley Babbitt and he's been indicted for just being there,
[13:59.560 --> 14:03.960]  so it's a huge war on free speech and I've got a lot of thoughts and a lot of things
[14:03.960 --> 14:11.120]  to say, but here's what Steve Bannon had to say, Cheryl Atkinson, the famous investigative
[14:11.120 --> 14:15.600]  journalist said, from what I can gather, the plan to air more January 6th tape on Fox tonight
[14:15.600 --> 14:21.000]  changed, that must have been some battle behind the scenes, but it should be addressed explicitly
[14:21.000 --> 14:35.520]  on the program rather than dot, dot, dot, rather than just pretending to ignore it,
[14:35.520 --> 14:45.640]  Steve Bannon says Murdoch shut Tucker down, yeah, now it's up in the air right now and
[14:45.640 --> 14:48.200]  I said I get to the bottom of the hour, but you know me, I never give you cliffhangers,
[14:48.200 --> 14:53.480]  I just tell you right in front, I can't help myself, but there's a battle going on and
[14:53.480 --> 14:57.720]  then Tucker at the end of the show last night said with a super close up, he never does
[14:57.720 --> 15:04.040]  that, he said, we're not stopping, this is going to come out and I know Tucker well,
[15:04.040 --> 15:09.360]  this will get out one way or another or he'll leave Fox.
[15:09.360 --> 15:11.800]  So that's where we are.
[15:11.800 --> 15:20.480]  By the way, Fox News, these Tucker Carlson, Tucker Carlson doesn't need Fox News and that's
[15:20.480 --> 15:26.280]  why they have me platforming for the individuals like myself who can be as big as Fox News
[15:26.280 --> 15:32.480]  at one point without any help from the system and the power structure can't stay in its
[15:32.480 --> 15:38.240]  corrupt position if that's the case, so that's where the revolution is right now and people
[15:38.240 --> 15:41.640]  are picking sides, looks like Elon Musk is picking our side, all right, we're going
[15:41.640 --> 15:48.200]  to cover a ton of news today, I'm going to come back and hit Biden and his big digital
[15:48.200 --> 15:53.440]  ID rollout, Allah, Mark and the Beast, then we'll get back into situation with the January
[15:53.440 --> 16:01.320]  6th suppression of the truth and the suppression of the press, stay with us, ladies and gentlemen,
[16:01.320 --> 16:05.240]  this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World is a historic book that documents
[16:05.240 --> 16:09.440]  the globalists and their own words, plan for our future that is the hellish future.
[16:09.440 --> 16:13.440]  Now you'll be always while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[16:13.440 --> 16:17.440]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[16:17.440 --> 16:21.600]  Amazon or info or short.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of
[16:21.600 --> 16:26.240]  the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of

[19:13.040 --> 19:18.960]  president of the united states he's a puppet operating for the globalists appetites of the
[19:18.960 --> 19:30.560]  autocrat cannot be appeased they must be opposed and that's only to understand one word no no no
[19:30.560 --> 19:38.320]  exactly and that's why we say no to your vaccines we say no to you shutting down our businesses we
[19:38.320 --> 19:44.240]  say no to you taking our firearms we say no to you censoring our free speech we say no to you

[19:56.320 --> 20:10.160]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[20:26.320 --> 20:38.000]  there is a corporate revolution taking place across the world to totally enslave us
[20:39.280 --> 20:46.640]  every way they can and in the last three years the communist chinese the un and a group run by
[20:46.640 --> 20:52.960]  bill gates have put several billion dollars that we know of into an international un consortium
[20:52.960 --> 21:03.120]  to create worldwide standards for a social credit score for a vaccine passport for a universal basic
[21:03.120 --> 21:11.840]  income platform that will operate under central bank digital currencies that track everything you
[21:11.840 --> 21:17.840]  spend where it's spent how it's spent they can be devalued they can be increased in value
[21:17.840 --> 21:25.280]  they can let you spend it one place but not another this is total slavery this is worse than being a
[21:25.280 --> 21:32.000]  prisoner and the european central bank the uk central bank which are all private the private
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.960]  federal reserve they've all been announcing in concert that it's imminent that they're going
[21:38.960 --> 21:45.040]  to roll these out and many countries are already doing it by administration calls for digital
[21:45.040 --> 21:51.120]  id investment public private data sharing collaboration just like you saw with the covet
[21:51.120 --> 21:55.920]  violating tippa and all the rest of it sharing all your medical records and where you went and what
[21:55.920 --> 22:00.480]  you did and getting all the companies to get on board where you have to have a smartphone to even
[22:01.040 --> 22:08.640]  look at a menu in a restaurant that's all training you for this this is the final step this is the
[22:08.640 --> 22:15.680]  holy grail this is the coup de grace this is the crème de la crème of tyranny article up on info
[22:15.680 --> 22:26.000]  wars dot com and here is the national cybersecurity strategy march 2023 now remember that june national
[22:26.000 --> 22:33.120]  anti-terrorism strategy and if you read that strategy it's now in effect white people are the
[22:33.120 --> 22:39.840]  main threat white supremacy is the most dangerous threat totally made up and they've got to surveil
[22:39.840 --> 22:45.120]  you and they've got to take your guns and protesting open borders or protesting election fraud or
[22:45.120 --> 22:52.080]  lockdowns or force injection is terrorism it's outlandish but they're doing it and here's the
[22:52.080 --> 23:01.680]  national cyber security strategy for your security everything you buy and sell will be tracked by the
[23:01.680 --> 23:12.240]  irs and other agencies in live time this is exactly what the communist chinese have where they're
[23:12.240 --> 23:23.120]  defined critical infrastructure digital infrastructure so they centralize it they harmonize it you've
[23:23.120 --> 23:36.560]  got to go read this for yourself all under the rubric of safety shape market forces to drive
[23:36.560 --> 23:43.280]  security and resilience yes to fight climate change deciding where you can spend your money and
[23:43.280 --> 23:49.200]  what's good for the earth and what's bad oh meat's going to be taxed and plastics and then basically
[23:49.200 --> 24:01.040]  everything else when they're done with it but their companies their operations they're all going to
[24:01.040 --> 24:10.800]  be tax exempt just like bill gates's and warren buffett's operations are so this is the market of the
[24:10.800 --> 24:20.320]  beast it's all over if they get this in place and as usual we're flat footed on this and there's
[24:20.320 --> 24:27.040]  almost no resistance to it because people just can't believe it's happening even though it's
[24:27.040 --> 24:33.840]  already happening there there's some resistance forming but it's not enough we need the state
[24:33.840 --> 24:38.400]  legislatures we need congress we need the courts we need the people if you think big text bad
[24:38.400 --> 24:47.840]  censoring now they are merging it like splitting a car deck in two and then putting them back
[24:47.840 --> 24:54.320]  together again for one big unified corporate fascist world government system with the communist
[24:54.320 --> 25:00.720]  chinese and bill gates in the un setting the standards that are being adopted and the by
[25:00.720 --> 25:07.840]  administration two years ago having their head of cyber security be the head of the new international
[25:07.840 --> 25:14.880]  conference that is developing the final regulations for this for a planetary worldwide system
[25:18.480 --> 25:24.400]  just like biden's former head of covet responses now is he the staff they are centralizing the
[25:24.400 --> 25:31.680]  control for the next rollout and the next pandemic whether real or fake they're going to be releasing
[25:31.680 --> 25:39.120]  and they're telling you is imminent the same time we now have the reportedly final draft of the un
[25:41.120 --> 25:49.280]  world medical tyranny treaty that sets up a biomedical police state worldwide to get rid
[25:49.280 --> 25:53.840]  of all your medical record privacy integrated into a worldwide database corporations can openly
[25:53.840 --> 25:59.520]  share all your information and the un says they will be in charge of pandemic response
[25:59.520 --> 26:06.000]  over your federal state and local governments when your government signs on to the treaty
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.800]  and biden says he's not even trying to get the treaty ratified he's going to have it implemented
[26:12.800 --> 26:18.560]  through the cdc and through the fda to the department of transportation the department
[26:18.560 --> 26:25.360]  of defense and 20 plus other agencies he announced that a month ago remember the cdc
[26:25.360 --> 26:31.120]  the year and a half ago said forget all rents during the lockdowns rent you don't have to pay it
[26:31.120 --> 26:35.920]  again and a federal court had to say you can't pass a law without congress passing it you can't
[26:35.920 --> 26:41.920]  forgive rents you just want to power grab it's not about helping poor people what happens when the
[26:41.920 --> 26:46.960]  people that own the property go bankrupt you'll owe nothing you'll be happy there'll be no more
[26:46.960 --> 26:56.480]  cities there'll be communes that's what they're bringing in and they mean business to do it so
[26:57.040 --> 27:01.520]  if you think things are bad now if you think the world's hellish now ladies and gentlemen you've
[27:01.520 --> 27:08.880]  seen nothing yet communist china has helped write the plan they developed the global qr code
[27:08.880 --> 27:16.320]  software it's based on it was adopted two years ago by the un bill gates suspending billions pushing
[27:16.320 --> 27:23.840]  it with his tax free money and now biden's coming in saying it's a federal initiative to the federal
[27:23.840 --> 27:30.160]  bureaucracies to do this and let me tell you when obama that's who he is obama's third term
[27:30.160 --> 27:37.360]  when obama's flesh puppet says jump the federal agencies say how high master
[27:37.360 --> 27:45.920]  everything they put in his new domestic terrorism directive in june two years ago
[27:46.720 --> 27:54.640]  almost two years ago they've already done biden actually tells the truth most of time he says hey
[27:54.640 --> 27:58.240]  i get elected immediately surge the border borders wide open it is
[27:58.240 --> 28:05.600]  i get elected i'm gonna go to war with russia they are
[28:09.200 --> 28:16.480]  these people are mad men and women and don't take it as weakness they can barely talk to
[28:16.480 --> 28:20.560]  featherman can't talk and the vice president can hardly talk and buy can hardly talk that's
[28:20.560 --> 28:26.080]  the sign of the strength of the deep state that they can put a mindless puppet in
[28:26.080 --> 28:29.040]  and still you feel like you can do nothing
[28:31.680 --> 28:37.600]  total psychotic evil we're gonna get into tucker carlson when we come back
[28:38.720 --> 28:42.560]  and the fact of the deep state is on the verge of collapsing
[28:44.640 --> 28:50.240]  when i said they're strong their strength is our weakness the minute we become strong

[33:28.480 --> 33:34.320]  loved by the people we are the info war thank you so much for joining us okay let me try to
[33:34.320 --> 33:39.200]  judiciously go through what's really happening with Tucker Carlson he was set to deliver the
[33:39.200 --> 33:48.560]  goods last night on federal agents provocateurs in the crowd ray epps 2.0 ray epps 3.0 ray epps 4.0
[33:48.560 --> 33:54.880]  up to ray epps 500 i mean there was at least 500 of them there we know that that's come out
[33:54.880 --> 34:00.480]  but the specifics the video that's why the deep state made major threats to fox senator schumer
[34:00.480 --> 34:05.760]  who's a main representative of the deep state went to the senate floor and threatened fox and said
[34:05.760 --> 34:15.360]  we'll shut you down massive pressure was placed and from the intel i've got there's a whole internal
[34:15.360 --> 34:20.000]  fight going on about what is going to come out and what was supposed to come out last night
[34:20.560 --> 34:26.000]  and tonight and tomorrow got postponed if tucker has his way it will come out he said that at the
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.480]  end in fact guys go to the very end of tucker show last night i know we streamed it live so we have a
[34:30.480 --> 34:35.680]  copy of it on man dot video where he says they want to stop this coming out but i assure you it will
[34:35.680 --> 34:42.720]  come out and i believe tucker he's hardcore he's awake the left admits it tucker says it i help
[34:42.720 --> 34:47.920]  wake him up and radicalizing he gets what's going on he's not going back he believes in the people
[34:48.560 --> 34:54.160]  and so i predict he won't be at fox news in their future if he's unable to put this out
[34:54.960 --> 34:59.360]  i'm gonna leave it at that but that's speaking from my perspective i'm not speaking for tucker
[34:59.360 --> 35:04.560]  now sharyl atkinson from her sources says that there was a fight and they're trying to block the
[35:04.560 --> 35:10.480]  release steve bandit says murdoch shut down tucker they can basically see the same information
[35:10.480 --> 35:17.520]  with some of the same sources i have that said this is again bigger than just january 6th they're
[35:17.520 --> 35:24.880]  brand new american people as terrorists officially using this event maybe 50 people were violent
[35:24.880 --> 35:30.960]  a million plus showed up maybe a thousand went in brought in by the police i tried to stop them
[35:32.480 --> 35:38.560]  but this is about the power of the system try to gaslight us that it's rewriting history to show
[35:38.560 --> 35:44.480]  footage that shows they lied well yeah rewriting history is not a bad thing when you find out the
[35:44.480 --> 35:53.360]  truth about history they famously had cases about 130 years ago at the turn of the century before last
[35:53.360 --> 35:59.200]  where they would create fake skeletons and digs in africa and the u.s. that were made up of pig
[35:59.200 --> 36:04.160]  bones and other things to say oh look we found the caveman there would be a big international
[36:04.160 --> 36:08.640]  story and the people would turn around with the skeleton making millions of dollars and then later
[36:08.640 --> 36:15.680]  it would turn out it was fake so history was rewritten to say that was fake but their cardinal
[36:15.680 --> 36:23.440]  rule is never when the deep states caught fabricating something expose it no saddam did have wmds
[36:24.080 --> 36:32.000]  easter bunny is real so that's where we are and speaking of that i saw a compilation of this
[36:32.000 --> 36:40.000]  this morning but it's like five minutes long here's just one example but chucky schumer the attorney
[36:40.000 --> 36:46.480]  general garland all of them i mean they're just everywhere like parrots with their new talking
[36:46.480 --> 37:00.240]  point saying tuckers a liar he says nobody died that day five police officers died that day not
[37:00.240 --> 37:07.360]  one police officer died that day not one police officer died from wounds of that day five citizens
[37:07.360 --> 37:15.280]  Trump supporters died that day so they know it's out in the news that five died so they conflate
[37:15.280 --> 37:24.720]  it thinking you won't go look it up it's an absolute fact that five u.s. citizens trump
[37:24.720 --> 37:29.120]  supporters died that day you know ashley babbitt almost no coverage of the other four
[37:29.120 --> 37:37.600]  and so the attorney general of the united states weighed in yesterday trying to get
[37:37.600 --> 37:45.200]  tuckered and not had his program massive pressure looks like it worked so far but the
[37:45.200 --> 37:53.920]  fight's on internally i'm told and he said tuckers says nobody died well five people died five police
[37:53.920 --> 38:03.040]  officers no that's a lie so that's the shell game they're playing and they think you're that stupid
[38:03.040 --> 38:08.480]  now obviously as a populist nationalist 1776 audience that loves freedom you're like yeah we
[38:08.480 --> 38:12.320]  know that's a lie but they're just trying to float it to those that don't really pay attention
[38:13.520 --> 38:16.880]  kind of like people that still believe the vaccine is a vaccine or the vaccine works
[38:17.600 --> 38:22.720]  like well it doesn't really protect you much but it helps a little no all the numbers show
[38:22.720 --> 38:30.080]  it hurts you way worse but the big lie is still well 99% effectiveness 95% effectiveness
[38:30.080 --> 38:35.440]  82% effectiveness 49% effectiveness and then finally oh it's just very effective
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.200]  so here's merit garland this is just insane
[38:44.400 --> 38:51.760]  saying five officers died here it is you've seen some of that video what's your reaction to that
[38:51.760 --> 38:56.640]  so i don't want to comment on any particular reports i think all americans saw what happened
[38:56.640 --> 39:04.080]  on january 6th and most of it saw most of us saw it as it was happening it was a violent attack
[39:04.080 --> 39:09.600]  on a fundamental tenant of american democracy that power is peacefully transferred from one
[39:09.600 --> 39:19.120]  administration to another uh um over a hundred officers were assaulted on that day five officers
[39:19.120 --> 39:27.520]  died we have charged more than a thousand people with their crimes on that day and more than 500
[39:27.520 --> 39:33.840]  have already been convicted i think it's very clear what happened on january 6th and tugger's crime
[39:33.840 --> 39:37.840]  is they say on one officer died at the scene his brains beat out and they show him at the end of
[39:37.840 --> 39:45.600]  the day totally fine now notice his mind control technique that's training that's sophisticated
[39:45.600 --> 39:51.520]  he said i'm not going to get into the specifics because he's about to lie to you you know what you
[39:51.520 --> 39:58.560]  saw you saw it that day no we saw you say that day five officers died that was the talking point
[39:58.560 --> 40:03.600]  within hours five officers dead five officers dead you know i'm not going to get into specifics
[40:03.600 --> 40:12.000]  don't read the fine print five officers died that day you know what you saw you know what you saw
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.400]  that day what they told you that wasn't true he doesn't get into specifics he says you know
[40:18.400 --> 40:25.840]  like Obi-Wan Kenobi how long you had these droids oh you know three seasons hold on storm troopers
[40:25.840 --> 40:29.440]  these aren't the droids you're looking for move along move along
[40:29.440 --> 40:41.200]  Eric garland you all know what you saw you all know what happened
[40:41.200 --> 40:47.680]  they killed five officers that day and it's not isolated i got a five minute compilation
[40:49.040 --> 40:52.960]  of them saying yesterday Tucker is lying and saying no one died
[40:52.960 --> 41:01.280]  no they killed five citizens no he's not saying that he's saying five officers didn't die one
[41:01.280 --> 41:04.480]  didn't die that day one had a stroke the next day and died
[41:07.280 --> 41:12.640]  so again that's the mind control that they think you're going to sit there and accept
[41:12.640 --> 41:17.360]  and they can't have anybody challenging this false history or rewriting
[41:17.360 --> 41:24.960]  the history these are the same people that tell you two men can have a baby and if a man gets
[41:24.960 --> 41:29.200]  convicted of raping and murdering a three-year-old like just happened in england and then he suddenly
[41:29.200 --> 41:35.360]  identifies as a woman he can now be in the women's prison because if you'll accept that
[41:35.360 --> 41:42.960]  murder of logic they believe you will accept anything now kevin mccarthy i've got the clip right
[41:42.960 --> 41:49.360]  here says he's going to release it to everybody soon because we're going to release it all soon
[41:50.400 --> 41:53.760]  good that's the only way to do it it takes the heat off tucker
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.960]  it's out it's like wiki leaks you can go download it for yourself everybody can watch it for themselves
[42:01.600 --> 42:07.200]  everybody can go through it themselves that is the answer people said man watch tucker get it well
[42:07.200 --> 42:12.960]  he's so respected and he's such a good guy and people say well why don't we all get it and i said
[42:12.960 --> 42:18.320]  last week i said huh careful what you wish for if they told me we're going to give you the 41
[42:18.320 --> 42:23.280]  thousand hours i would say let's give it to everybody because the responsibility of that
[42:23.280 --> 42:30.560]  is so huge and whoever gets that is being handed a hand grenade but tucker stepped up he did it
[42:30.560 --> 42:36.720]  and now they're coming in putting major pressure on him we'll talk more about this and what it
[42:36.720 --> 42:42.960]  really signifies and some other clips that tie into it when we come back but this is a big deal
[42:42.960 --> 42:47.840]  why it's dangerous if you see what actually happened just let us tell you what happened
[42:47.840 --> 42:53.920]  with our false narrative van dot video info wars dot com be part of the revolution share those

[47:54.880 --> 48:01.040]  here in just a moment but first i want to challenge the listeners
[48:05.120 --> 48:08.560]  ladies and gentlemen you see that free speech is under unprecedented attack
[48:09.200 --> 48:14.960]  you see that the watering holes the oasis of truth are more vital than ever and people are
[48:14.960 --> 48:22.240]  coming for the truth but the enemies of free thought and and of of a livable good civilization
[48:22.240 --> 48:31.440]  are under attack because the people are hungry we can't do this without you we aren't funded
[48:31.440 --> 48:35.600]  by the globalist we're not funded by the billionaires we're not funded by george soros in the

[48:42.880 --> 48:47.440]  that you want to get great products and you want to keep this broadcast on the air and continue
[48:47.440 --> 48:53.120]  to change the world there's not a place anywhere in the world that you could support a broadcast
[48:53.120 --> 49:00.800]  that's having a bigger effect than this operation now all of our toothpaste has been sold out our

[51:54.320 --> 51:58.560]  what do you say about the Tucker Carlson thing it is so outrageous
[52:01.360 --> 52:06.640]  that he airs monday's show gets number one ratings number one story hundreds of millions of views
[52:06.640 --> 52:11.360]  online i mean 10 million 20 million 10 million i mean just on twitter it's like 20 million views
[52:11.360 --> 52:15.520]  one million views three million views five million when i say 100 million there's probably 100 million
[52:15.520 --> 52:22.560]  views of Tucker's report in different permutations or pieces on twitter alone that's the guesstimation
[52:22.560 --> 52:28.480]  though i mean it's probably over 100 million number one story changing the whole narrative
[52:28.480 --> 52:33.120]  taking the ball away from the deep state showing the truth and then tuesday he was gonna drop a bomb
[52:33.120 --> 52:40.320]  on him bringing the goods and then suddenly the pressure happens and we don't see the new footage
[52:40.320 --> 52:44.880]  he just recaps the previous night but said they don't want you to see this but i promise you he
[52:44.880 --> 52:54.720]  said at the end i promise you we are going to bring it to you soon here's a clip of what Tucker said
[52:54.720 --> 53:07.760]  last night tonight tomorrow we'll have more on what actually happened at the capital on january
[53:07.760 --> 53:14.240]  six they want us to shut up we won't and our conversation an extended version of our conversation
[53:14.240 --> 53:19.600]  with actor and comedian and thinker russell brand have the best night with the ones you love we'll
[53:19.600 --> 53:30.160]  see you tomorrow so what happened is tucker in his contract and i'll leave it at this nobody
[53:30.160 --> 53:37.200]  knows this took a little step people at fox took a lot less money in his new contract a few years
[53:37.200 --> 53:45.920]  ago to have total freedom but then continually they say he has total freedom but then they have
[53:45.920 --> 53:51.680]  clauses where they can still review things before he airs it so they're reviewing it they're giving
[53:51.680 --> 53:56.640]  him a bunch of grief they're all over his ass will it be tonight will it be tomorrow night or will
[53:56.640 --> 54:07.120]  tucker carlson leave fox knows he's got that much integrity that's where we are but the information
[54:07.120 --> 54:12.000]  is devastating and the deep states obviously spying on him hell fox gets to see what he's
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.480]  producing so that's how the deep state knew you have the republican leadership come out against
[54:16.480 --> 54:24.320]  tucker other than mitch mcconnell you had uh you know the evil turtle the republican leader of the
[54:24.320 --> 54:32.240]  senate come out and say oh it's totally evil the security of the deep state they've got cameras
[54:32.240 --> 54:36.800]  everywhere watching us they're in our phones they're surveilling us that they've got all this
[54:36.800 --> 54:41.840]  footage of the capital and they go oh we can't show it to you and the capital police actually
[54:41.840 --> 54:47.840]  told tucker no just blur out this one door so mitch mcconnell says it was a mistake for
[54:47.840 --> 54:52.640]  tucker carlson to show january six footage the government fought to keep hidden yes so he could
[54:52.640 --> 55:01.200]  put out his anti-trump anti-american narrative elon is a perfect reaction to mitch's rhino response
[55:01.200 --> 55:08.320]  on january six pointing out that it's freedom to be able to see the footage in a good thing
[55:09.120 --> 55:15.360]  and that this is basically tyranny and what's happening right now to elon musk we'll talk
[55:15.360 --> 55:21.760]  about this next hour federal trade commission demands elon must identify all journalists
[55:21.760 --> 55:26.160]  who had access to the twitter files well under federal law they can't even do that but they're
[55:26.160 --> 55:32.480]  attacking journalists but mainstream corporate media is just going along with it ftc investigation
[55:32.480 --> 55:39.040]  sought elon musk internal communications journalist names where's the press coming out against this
[55:39.040 --> 55:44.320]  elon musk accuses biden of weaponization of government agency against him over twitter files

[55:52.560 --> 55:56.960]  doctors telling you about therapeutics hell they had the fbi and places like florida and

[56:29.920 --> 56:38.320]  that because big pharma didn't want you to know i saw the head of the eu say we got a
[56:38.320 --> 56:44.320]  band free speech because there were people claiming that there were sprays you could put on services

[57:04.000 --> 57:10.000]  don't go to the beach it's worse in sunlight the virus attacks worse in sunlight but wear your mask
[57:10.000 --> 57:16.080]  while you're eating and then pull it down because the virus will respect you when you're eating and
[57:16.080 --> 57:21.440]  will not hurt anybody when you pull it down to eat all of it is insane we're going to come back

[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:32.640]  then uh there will be uh we there will be no longer a norse team too we will bring an end to it
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:39.120]  how will you do that exactly since the project and control of the project is within Germany's
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:45.120]  controls i promise you we'll be able to do it tonight sabotage at sea that's what president
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:51.440]  biden is calling the leaks and explosions on the Nord Stream pipelines like a boiling cauldron
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:58.000]  the busy Baltic Sea bursting with gas from rupture Russian Nord Stream reinforced pipelines
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.400]  first on cnn sources telling us that european security officials observed Russian Navy ships
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.760]  earlier this week in the vicinity of those leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines that were likely
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:15.440]  caused by underwater explosions here's what we know we know that Russian support ships Russian
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:21.200]  Navy support ships were spotted in the vicinity of the leaks on these pipelines we were also told
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.800]  by a source familiar with the intelligence that Russian submarines were spotted in the
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:31.600]  general area last week i think this is uh clearly an active sabotage of some sort and
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:38.000]  Russia is certainly the most likely suspect it's incredibly uh alarming president Vladimir Putin
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.840]  has blamed the united states and its allies for blowing up the undersea Nord Stream pipelines
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:50.400]  it was a deliberate active sabotage and now the Russians are pumping out disinformation lies
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.400]  if russia wanted to shut off the pipeline they would flip the button they would twist the knob
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.040]  they don't need to blow it up it's theirs it starts in russia so it was pretty obvious to us the
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.600]  bite administration was involved in this they have been lying to us all along about this there's no
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:10.640]  way the united states was not either involved or knew about this or at the very minimum approved it
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:16.160]  today a senior u.s government official rejected a new claim by russia's defense minister he claimed
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:22.960]  that ukraine is preparing to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb with western help on its own territory
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.920]  this is the first time the hundred first airborne division has deployed to europe since world war
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:32.880]  two the idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:40.240]  going in with american pilots and american crews just understand and don't kid yourself no matter
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:49.200]  what you all say that's called world war three the u.s will have to send their sons and daughters
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:56.560]  exactly the same way as we are sending their sons and daughters to war and they will have to fight
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:05.520]  and they will be dying air sirens blaring across much of central and eastern ukraine today as
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:11.280]  Putin's forces ramp up washington has placed more than 8 000 u.s-based troops on a heightened state
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:18.320]  of alert today the u.s sent in the cavalry bound for romania right along the ukrainian border
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.480]  if we continue down this path we may end up with a nuclear holocaust
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.920]  so
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.800]  CNN has learned that the u.s is developing contingency plans for possible russian escalation
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.880]  in its war in ukraine including the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons russian president
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.040]  vladimir putin today making it official he just formally suspended russia's involvement
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.680]  in its last remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the united states the prospect of nuclear
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:02.880]  conflict once unthinkable is now back within the realm of possibility every actuary every
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:22.320]  historic war game every analysis shows this leads to total thermal nuclear war and it's time for
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.280]  humanity to stand up in the info war and say i don't know what's going to happen at the end of this
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:35.920]  but you want to fight you better believe you got one from the front lines of the information war

[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.680]  gas sliding everybody and saying oh my god you can't see raw footage that contradicts our official
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.760]  story we've got a stop hooker carlson now the evidence mounting that they blocked what he was
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:50.000]  going to air last night what is your view on this where do you think this is going also biden rolls
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.600]  out his new big national initiative cyber security strategy to force us on to a central bank digital
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:00.080]  currency where everything we do is tracked and traced and controlled this is the mark of the beast
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:08.320]  i want to take your calls on that subject as well and then the good news not just senator paul but
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:14.240]  a lot of other governors members of congress other senators other house members we have the smoking
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:21.680]  guns from twitter fauci censoring medical treatments fauci censoring origin of the virus the government
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:26.720]  now admitting what we already knew that it came out of wuhan that it was artificially made we told
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:33.840]  you that three years ago plus but the fact that that's coming out now and that fauci's in so much
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:40.320]  trouble is a beautiful thing and the hearings are set to begin we've got to discredit the people that
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:45.920]  launched this attack so they can't launch the next attack because it's fauci even though he's quote
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:55.440]  retired involved heading up the new un board with the new un treaty over our bodies that biden says
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:01.120]  he's gonna put us under talk about a un takeover you thought it'd be soldiers no they come in white

[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:59.760]  i want to hear from you eight seven seven seven eight nine alex speaking of fauci and speaking
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:06.560]  of all the information that's coming out let's play a clip of rand paul on fox news talking about
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:14.000]  the situation the reason dr fauci didn't want any attention drawn to this or to his funding of the
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.240]  lab is that ultimately he would have culpability ultimately there's a responsibility because for
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:26.400]  years he had advocated for gain of function research he's even quoted as saying in 2012
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.040]  if a pandemic should occur if a scientist should be bitten by an animal and the virus gets out of
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:36.960]  the lab it would be worth the knowledge but in late january 2020 there's a flurry of emails that go
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:44.000]  on all night long till three in the morning the next day there's a video conference and eight
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.360]  good friends of fauci scientists famous virologists come together and they say dr fauci we think this
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:55.600]  leaked from the lab the virus the sequence of the rna is suspicious we think it came from the lab
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.480]  and at the end of the phone call they all became convinced otherwise and he they agreed to write
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:06.400]  an article saying something the opposite of what they were saying in private so yes dr fauci and
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:13.440]  dr collins and others orchestrated a cover-up there's emails between dr collins and dr fauci
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:20.400]  which dr collins says this wouldn't be good for china this wouldn't be good for science meaning
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.800]  that it wouldn't be good for the business of science for the money that changes hands there's
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:30.160]  so much going on here and when the american public finally find out i mean there's going
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:37.280]  to be such dissatisfaction in this country like you can't believe for example we know that the
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:44.160]  nih gave money to american universities who then gave it to military researchers these are researchers
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:50.640]  with the title of general and colonel in the people's liberation army our universities gave
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:56.160]  nih money to them to do military research this is a real problem when the truth gets out there
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:02.640]  when this is finally declassified it's going to be explosive and i want to be very precise here
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:09.040]  here the military industrial complex is not our military it's the criminals that control it they
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.720]  develop these viruses they got in trouble in 2015 obama got caught they move it to wuhan so i'm not
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:22.880]  defending them and i'm not defending china i want to lay out the pieces here it's treason
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:28.880]  to move those viruses to come into china and to give them those weapons when they can't do the
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:34.880]  top of technology we can with the chris paredi but all our weapons all our designs you look at
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:40.960]  their air force you look at it all it's copies of our stuff bad copies so that's all treason
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:46.720]  so moving it there's treason whoever's behind it the chinese the pentagon whoever but we know
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:51.040]  from all the top experts in the research all confirmed this year and last year but we told
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:56.320]  you dr frances boil three years ago the author of the us biological chemical weapons laws the former
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:04.560]  top un war crimes prosecutor he has all the sources he nailed it three years ago plus three years and
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:12.160]  over a month ago that's three plus years ago that it was the pentagon that actually developed this
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:18.640]  crap had it moved to china because it was illegal to do it here so it's double treason it's treason
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:26.560]  by fouchy and dazzic all them working on it in the lab over there and it is treason by our hijacked
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:33.200]  pentagon that they were involved in this so they're all guilty they're guilty for making the virus
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:38.720]  that's illegal to make a function they're guilty for shipping it to china and then they're guilty
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:46.000]  for lying about it to congress and covering it up and demonizing people like me and listen i'm not
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.360]  the smartest guy around i just do research in my heads in the game what am i supposed to do when i
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.960]  learned three years ago they were doing this just sit here and lie to you i just can't do it
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.480]  was dr boil supposed to lie to you was dr mccullough supposed to lie to you was the top

[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.440]  that i'm telling the truth let me tell you something when you train yourself to do nothing
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.920]  but tell the truth your brain works so much better i don't have to think about what i'm going to say
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.640]  i don't have to sit there and worry about what i said before i just say it and your brain just
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:46.560]  operates on full cylinders but people in this culture that have believed lies they get they get
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.120]  infected by the virus of lies and they don't even know how to think anymore and they basically have
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:56.240]  mass psychosis i'm going to go to break come back with your phone calls here in a few minutes but

[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:57.440]  country saying get this virus program shut down gain of function with coronaviruses is insane

[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:19.360]  world order it's alex jones i genuinely got pissed last segment i'll be completely honest with you
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:24.400]  i love my 21 year old son i love my 19 year old daughter 18 year old daughter i love my 15 year
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:30.320]  old daughter but when they get bigger you don't feel as protective of them as an instinctive
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:35.120]  level you still love them just as much maybe more but man i think about my five year old daughter
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:41.600]  now cute innocent she is and i think about these monstrous psychopathic mad scientists with labs
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.400]  all over the world brewing up stuff that that makes covid look like a walk in the park
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:53.520]  and how they write all these documents and all these grants and call it gain of function when
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:21:00.720]  it's totally illegal if i was selling fentanyl to school kids i deserve to be executed
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:08.240]  if you were doing it you deserve to die or live under the jail these people are doing
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:13.200]  stuff way worse than that and they sit there like fouchy and mill gates laughing at us like a bunch
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:20.160]  of demons because they are that and we need to get angry and expose them politically don't kill
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:25.040]  them don't go blow them up don't turn them into victims destroy their name destroy who they are
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:30.720]  exposed to the murderers let everybody know they're the villains so that they can't do it again
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:35.040]  everybody knows they're the authors of the destruction and then they'll get brought to justice
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:40.880]  one way or another through the legal system it's happening right now they got away with a bunch of
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:45.440]  bio attacks in africa and asia they got away with that and sterilized the vaccines they got away with
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:58.480]  a bunch of stuff in the past they got away with a ton of stuff and they thought they'd get away
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.760]  with this they're not going to go over there by the way i saw something trending on twitter over
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:08.240]  the weekend i meant to set the crew and i forgot guys find the gates clip from two and a half years
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:14.400]  ago when he was on for reed zarkaria and the way to find it is you type in bill gates laughs
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:22.640]  when zarkaria says the pain is going to last a long time and i noticed that clip was put out
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:29.280]  and the bots on twitter were saying it's fake bill gates didn't laugh at that i have the original
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:35.600]  seeing in clip i played it probably a hundred times it's real he always laughs when he talks about
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:42.240]  killing people but see people see that they go oh there's no way he laughs when zarkaria goes the
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:47.440]  pain is going to last a long time it's not going to go away it's going to get a lot worse gates
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:52.080]  are like yes yes and then they just reminded me of that because if you're a radio listener you can't
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:57.040]  see it they just put a clip of him up with cobert two and a half years ago right around the same
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:00.960]  time and cobert is like what's coming next you predicted this year so smart he goes well
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:06.640]  no terrorists will release a new bio weapon that will kill far more people and gates starts laughing
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:14.400]  and giggling and so does cober it's it's so much fun to be discussing how they're exterminating us
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:19.680]  because they're psychotics and so is cobert he's in with them he hangs out with them they're all
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:23.520]  part of it so the crew already found the clip
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:32.400]  yeah get those queued up to that point from the next segment and him on cobert and we'll uh
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:38.640]  we'll we'll play those clips no this happened imagine the left their job because bill gates
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:44.320]  spends tens of millions a year on propaganda their job is to prop up a psychopath that giggles
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.720]  and laughs talking about people dying when all he's ever said is he wants to depopulate people
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:55.040]  but now he wants to make us roll up our sleeves and take shots because he wants us to live
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.600]  well the grim reaper shut up at your door and said i want you to take vitamins i say i don't
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:05.280]  think those are vitamins i think those are cyanide all right i'm done ranting let's go to your phone

[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:38.320]  envisioned by the british empire mainly as a system of control so they said we want biometrics we
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.280]  want computers we want to know the secret of the cells and they went and gave unlimited funding
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:47.520]  talked to british in 400 years ago where they said we want a clock that ticks and works properly
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:51.440]  and will give you the equivalent of a billion dollars today and a guy invented it a couple years
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:57.360]  i mean they would just put the money out and say we want it give it to us and it works

[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:24.720]  birds the bia could manipulate the news in the united states they took the babies out of the

[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:52.400]  hey alex can you hear me sir all right well i just wanted to talk about uh tucker i think he
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:57.360]  would uh i think he'd pump up the info wars audience just a little bit more you know hopefully
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:03.680]  hopefully corporate dinosaur media does what it does best and screws this up i really hope so because
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.520]  you know everyone's going to see the truth and they're going to follow tucker and we're just
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:12.000]  going to have a bigger community build i totally agree the big win is it made it a big front and
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.840]  center story that they don't want you to see raw footage that they're saying it's evil and bad they're
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:21.680]  harassing you on musk for putting out the fact that fouchy suppressed gain of function lab leak news
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:26.240]  i mean they are on the run right now and in long term there's no way they put the genie back in the
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:32.320]  bottle no way at all no way at all i'd love to see the lawyers start going after them and then
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:38.160]  the j6 people like i can't believe after after even just last night that those people are still in
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:44.720]  jail get them out can you believe jeff johnsley the q shaman asked in court for the raw footage
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:50.720]  saying the police brought me in and they wouldn't let the jury see that how evil is that now it's
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:57.040]  insane and y'all need to buy some more info wars products to help alex and help owen shroyer and
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:02.880]  my favorite my personal favorite is uh the american journal i freaking love harrison um but you guys
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.000]  a fourth person tucker carlson i think he would do great you know i hope he screws up
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:14.080]  and you guys get bigger i hope you guys get your own tv channel out of this well they don't let other
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:18.320]  independent channels i appreciate your call when one american news started rivaling fox they were
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:23.360]  taking off cable when news backs started rivaling they were taking off cable uh so there's a monopoly
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:28.480]  going on massive censorship so that's that's what's going on i appreciate your call look i love
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:33.520]  tucker and i'm glad he's been able to tell the truth where he's at i'd like to see fox news be
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:40.080]  more hardcore not less uh let's go to bob in illinois bob go ahead hey alex it's an honor to speak
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.880]  with you i'll start with my point so you can cut me off during the story encouragement flattery
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:51.760]  um would you please use your influence to uh pressure jim jordan and that panel of judicial
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:58.560]  oversight committee to subpoena the judges that are denying habeas corpus to the j6 prisoner well
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.760]  let me say my influence is you the listeners and viewers yes everybody should call jim jordan's office
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:08.400]  they should call the rest of that committee and say we want new process two plus years
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:15.280]  some people hundreds of them still held without trial that is outrageous that that's guantanamo bay
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:21.680]  in america yes and those justices should be subpoenaed and and held you know be able to
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:25.120]  say why they're doing that well tucker was hardcore last night saying mitch mcconnell's
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:31.200]  a chinese agent and the judges in dc are total tyrants i mean he was he was absolutely everything
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:35.840]  he was saying was over the top yeah but if they get subpoenaed that means they have to leave their
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:40.240]  comfortable place and go sit in front of those people and give an account so my story i went to
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:45.040]  the rally i didn't go to the capital thank god uh that's when i started listening to you faithfully
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:50.640]  and thanks to you and people that listened to me we didn't get poisoned um i had to sign copy your
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:54.880]  book i buy supplements and i donate when i can't afford it i'm holding your court one of your coins
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:59.360]  in my hand and i've asked god let me keep it in heaven so if you see somebody wearing it on their
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:04.080]  uniform up there that's me and then one last thing if they don't mind if you find that your place
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:07.920]  in heaven is a little bit bigger than the others it's so you can invite us over over a couple
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:12.560]  times a year for some barbecue and maybe some football in the backyard how about that sir love

[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:27.680]  you're on the year good morning from arkansas alec yes sir great to talk with you hey you're
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:35.280]  right about uh thank you you know but the good book it says that it does send and and that
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:41.840]  that's valid valid you've validated thank you for seeing all the time i started opening my eyes and
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:47.200]  as an ink and termine with a five little second infantry in the gulf war uh i could i started to
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:51.760]  see things weren't right and there was something else going on and i started looking and digging
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:58.960]  and uh i just think these uh january six takes i think they need to be released no matter what
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:05.520]  i mean an unbiased news source needs to release these and i hope he's completely unbiased and uh
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:09.920]  did you hear the clip of the attorney general saying five police died that day
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:16.800]  oh absolutely sir absolutely and i got in trouble at work at the time i'm a semi-retired
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:21.520]  and i was running a liquor store at night kind of a night manager type thing and i was told to
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:25.760]  put the flag down at half mass for the police officer who died and i said i'm not going to do
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:31.920]  that because there was no one killed that day by that group by by anybody anybody else besides
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:35.840]  the jan sixers who died i think there were five or six of them that were killed yeah there were
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:41.520]  five citizens killed that day uh no police officers it's a total lie and two years later
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:46.400]  when it's a known lie the attorney general said it again at a press conference yes he did
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:53.440]  it i'm running this they're scared they're very scared and so i think maybe maybe uh chucker
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.760]  like i think you said it the other day or just yesterday morning or whatever it was you said
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:02.080]  he might have just lured them in to see what would happen in the beginning of this
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:07.040]  so maybe that's what he's doing but i i just have one more thing i'm not a well-spoken man but
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:14.320]  you are a warrior of god and you are validated i would stand up in your defense that you are a
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:19.360]  man of god and well i'm certainly trying sir and i love you and i appreciate you look i'm just
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.120]  fighting like everybody else to be free all of you are just as important as i am please
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:27.520]  but i definitely love god and i love justice and i love the truth and i don't like tyrants and i
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:32.560]  don't like people creating bio weapons that could kill all of us i'm pissed uh let's go to gregg in
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:39.760]  florida you're on the air go ahead hey how you doing alex good brother hey i got uh two things
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:46.080]  number one uh little message for tucker tucker carlson uh the door's opened a little bit he
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:53.520]  opened the door for us uh he backed away a little last night uh one just one phrase i want to tell
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:40:00.480]  him don't give a crippled crab a crutch okay step on him you got the door open we're starting to
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:07.120]  win this this deal little by little he opened the door on mainstream let's just step on him
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:13.120]  well in fairness to him they control his show his show is not live every once in a while it is
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:18.480]  it's it's taped right up until show time uh and so i guarantee you they said we're not gonna air
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:23.520]  that about two hours for show time they reviewed what he was gonna put out they said no lawyers
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:28.800]  have to review it uh and so they they didn't tell him he couldn't air it they they blocked it for
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:34.720]  now that's why at the end you could tell it was a bad edit because it wasn't an edit he cut in live
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:38.080]  i know how these things work i'm gonna leave it at that that's why it was like super hd when he
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.480]  cut it for just a second it wasn't taped he said they're trying to stop us they're not gonna stop
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:47.280]  us we're gonna get this out and and and so i i'm not gonna get to how i know all that but i know
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:52.720]  that and so there's a big internal fight going on right now hey we got the door open let's let's
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:58.960]  keep let's keep stepping on number two alex a few months ago before you took a break uh i want to
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:04.320]  get some business going for you guys and get some money flowing into you on a monthly basis
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:10.080]  you were gonna have your guy joe call me your business guy give me your name and number again
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:14.160]  brother i appreciate your call all right let's get another caller in here let's go to zack in
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:20.160]  south carolina you're on here hey how you doing alex uh i'm a team leader in the army national
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:24.640]  guard with a mechanized unit and i have a great concern for a lot of the soldiers out there that
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:29.520]  took the vaccine there's actually a lot of us alex that didn't really take it a couple thousand i
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:34.960]  would say that just literally found the way out of it but i'm among those and i'm really concerned
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.560]  for the guys that got it because you have a bunch of young soldiers who are at risk for the myocarditis
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:46.080]  the clotting the heart failure and if these globalists get their way we're going to be put into a war
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:51.200]  where we're going to have high intensity cardiovascular work worked in with adrenaline and
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:55.920]  our guys are going to be in a lot of trouble i mean just imagine the battlefield it's kind of like
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:00.880]  the analogy with the movie gladiator we have russell crow and jack with phoenix we've gotten
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:06.800]  the poison dagger in our soldiers so it's a big no i totally agree and you you know your science
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:10.480]  that it's it's people in really good shape when they go into super cardiovascular mode
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:14.480]  a lot of adrenaline that's when any heart scarring you don't know about causes uh
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:21.040]  cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest and you're absolutely right and the good news is we know
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:26.880]  that not all the shots they shipped out actually had the dose in it it was a weird actuary test
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:31.440]  they were doing on the public with different strengths uh but allowing that to happen to our

[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:36.640]  pressure in congress same thing in the blue states new york california having to back off
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:40.000]  that's good i mean they still hurt a lot of people but if we wouldn't have fought if we

[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:00.880]  but uh just to finish off you actually mentioned that your primary mission of informing the public
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:06.640]  was complete i wanted to to reassure you that i think your new primary mission is to continue
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:13.520]  spreading the word of jesus christ and having guests on that are like professionals in in regard to
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:19.200]  that information i 100 degree the market the beast is here now it's about the soul and i'm not saying
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:23.680]  i don't have more important missions i'm saying i knew the mission was to expose the new world order
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:28.240]  get a bunch of people talking about it and i can sit back now we have all these other wars to fight
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:32.880]  but say wow in that mission in my lifetime something most people never get to see the god
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:37.360]  light on my heart we all of us together really completed that mission it doesn't mean we don't
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:41.360]  have more to do now now's the next part of the fight but i just got chills we literally did that

[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:35.120]  wait to try the um turmeric toothpaste also a suggestion um you know the patriot points a
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:41.120]  great thing maybe there's a way um people like me with a lot of patriot points we could send those
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:45.920]  to people um get them as new listeners that'd be nice that when you built up enough if you
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:52.400]  could convert it to a promo code that that's like a digital online gift card that's a great idea
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:58.080]  just like yeah just like an email i could send uh to somebody say hey check out this store you've
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:02.880]  got a ten dollar gift card or or whatever it is well that that's an even better idea that you just
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:08.000]  kind of spurred we should have digital gift cards duh on the site that you can buy and send to people
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:13.040]  that is a fabulous idea or be able to convert patriot points as soon as i'm off today first
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:17.040]  thing i'm doing is going to go over to the marketing department that's two people and get that done
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:21.680]  and here's the good news we've had so little money we couldn't reorder t-shirts we couldn't
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:26.880]  reorder coffee we couldn't reorder all sorts of stuff we've finally gotten enough into the black
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:30.560]  that we're about to have the money to invest in getting the things you really want so we're
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:34.000]  we're clawing our way out every time that happens something new hits us but
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.720]  thank you listeners for buying the product we are clawing our way out of this we are fighting
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:48.320]  so hard anything else um yeah so uh november 2021 i called in um talking about brookens institute
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:55.760]  report from 2013 i have it all linked up on my blog the good fight news dot com but the the white
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:01.200]  paper was called securing the net global government governance in the digital domain and what that
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:06.720]  report outlines a little excerpt from here which again you could find the top article on that website
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:12.080]  the good fight news dot com it says the collapse of e-commerce will throw the global economy into
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:19.840]  a recession it goes on to say governments will be spurred into action um i also go on to talk about
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:28.080]  the cyber trends that'll happen in 2022 going on to 2030 and um i basically say at the bottom of
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:36.400]  the article cyber cyber war will not only be on the internet it'll become physical um i go down to
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:41.680]  highlight that the white house signed the national security memorandum on unproven um industrial
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:50.400]  control systems biden signed that i believe it was um july 2021 and then it goes on to have the
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:58.640]  updates of january 2023 this year where the fbi attacks on the stations um time magazine put out
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:03.440]  the article the power grid that's right the left is using anti-fiddle attack infrastructure
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:07.760]  so the globalists have a pretext to come in and take over infrastructure with ai
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:14.320]  so they have full control yep so we're going to see more of this going on and then this is
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:20.320]  going to lead us into the digital currency currency they are absolutely 100 destroy the old system
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:26.400]  to bring in the new amazing points james and indiana you're on the air january six prosecutors
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:30.720]  need to be disbarred the shaman should be released yesterday there are no fair federal trials the
[01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:34.560]  government manufactures evidence and brings people on the line on a regular basis i've contacted
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:39.040]  mccarthy's office calling him to call for the disbarment of corrupt prosecutors even in indiana
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:43.200]  a while ago the government was rigging cases to put people on death row article prosecutors
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:49.840]  accuse one another and also schumer has no right to stifle free speech i totally agree with you
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:53.840]  and and what do you think of them suppressing and that did go on folks they did suppress
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:57.680]  what tucker was going to release for last night the question is will that information get out
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:04.480]  it is a violation of our free speech also in this country the ig needs to be uh totally
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:08.160]  reformed you know they allowed the phoenix scandal to happen that killed 40 vets they
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:12.160]  allowed the director still a quarter million dollars keeper job they also allowed the chief
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:16.000]  of staff turned vets into drug addicts and did absolutely nothing the ig needs to be reformed
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.160]  as they've been used to retaliate target members of congress while on the government to break
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:24.560]  federal prescribing laws drug veterans the manufacturer cases against veterans and the disabled
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:29.120]  they are the ones also causing the veterans suicide epidemic in this country absolutely
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:33.520]  what do you make of the attorney general saying five police died on january 6 which has been
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:40.240]  approved in life for over two years yeah actually uh tucker showed on his live show that the the death
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:43.920]  of phoenix was shown on there on the next day right on video on fox news
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:50.960]  it's insane hold it up you can see it right on there absolutely well they all admit phoenix died
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:57.440]  the next day but the point is they doubled down and said no five police died died that day no police
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:03.360]  died that day they're completely corrupt you can't uh rely on anything the government says
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:09.280]  also my plug on the hearing beard formula have you heard of lately alex i know i haven't heard
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:14.000]  your plug all right let me give it to you if you're a trainee with the fanny i need to get

[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:45.120]  did do a special show last night that's posted a band-up video about a two-hour show covering
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:52.000]  tucker's report i was told uh by tucker that he was going to bring the goods and it was going to be
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:57:03.680]  huge and then you saw what happened and i just don't know what to say i was talking to tucker a
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:06.640]  little bit this morning on other matter i just couldn't bring it up because i could go figure
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:10.160]  out what happened from other sources and i just want to leave him to his own devices about what
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:16.960]  he's going to do but he got censored he got shut down and you saw him do the show he said i promise
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:22.400]  you it will come out and i believe him one way or another they need to just put the raw 40 000
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:30.400]  plus hours on the internet the security give me a break of the capital they stood down ladies and
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:35.520]  gentlemen and let the provocateurs break in we know the facts of what happened and that criminal
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:40.080]  chuckie schumer's got our borders dissolved all the mayhem and murder but he says oh tucker can't

[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:34.960]  that they that the other people have been lying and that the u.s government

[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:46.960]  are leaving the sinking ship man
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:55.760]  first we'll play the bill gates clip if they're saying it's fake from cnn my crew went to cnn.com
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:01.360]  they got the full 11 minute interview and they got it crisp in hd directly from the clip in fact
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:07.280]  after the show today i'm going to shoot a video where i show everybody saying it's a fake bill
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:12.160]  gates clip and then i'm going to go to cnn on video and show you where the damn things that
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:16.000]  where he laughs talking about how horrible and how the the lockdown's never gonna end
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:22.560]  these people are sick oh bill gates is a little swarmy demon he didn't really laugh about that
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:30.960]  it's fake yeah he did let's go to lisa in florida thanks for holding lisa you're on the year hi okay
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:39.600]  okay hey go ahead hi um i just a quick statement about tucker carlson i'm you know some people
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:45.680]  say he's the mainstream media you know we all know they're evil but the people that you speak
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:51.680]  to on info wars it's kind of preaching to the choir and a lot of people the normies he reaches
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:59.040]  those those people um you know so that's i think that's the best thing about him staying
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:04.240]  tucker carlson is a hundred percent real and a hundred percent hundred percent redpilled and
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:10.320]  doesn't give a damn about anything except about and he he has way more ratings they even say
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:14.560]  he has like 30 million viewers a night the nilson ratings lie when they say it's six million
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:20.400]  and he makes fox a lot of money uh and and and and so they want the patriot audience but they
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:24.480]  want to control it but they don't control him and now they're forcing control on him and it's
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:29.520]  going to be explosive look i'm not bragging i want the listeners to know this this show for
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:35.840]  any other broadcast woke tucker carlson up the left says radicalizing yes i did and i radicalized
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:40.800]  joe rogan and a bunch of other people and it's not bragging that's all god that did that and the
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:46.960]  listeners keeping us on air so this show not me but the guests and the calls and all of us together
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:54.640]  we broke the dam on the new world order we blew the death star got it so you did that too lisa thank
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:03:01.040]  you but um i yeah it's nice to see because some people that i've said stuff to you about info wars
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:06.960]  and all this stuff now they get it because of tucker carlson he reaches the normies the people who
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:14.560]  don't watch info or don't listen to uh independent media they just tune into fox news and and that's
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:21.280]  it so they tucker carlson is legitimate in their eyes well over 10 years ago tucker called wanted
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:24.640]  to come hang out and said hey i thought you were wrong thought you were a bad guy now i see you're
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:28.560]  right about a lot and then you know his kids are big listeners and then over the years he figured
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:32.880]  out that i'm like really dead on and then he's just as smart as i am once he changed his perspective
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:37.280]  and admitted he was naive he's just a smarter smarter and now he he's not even having to listen
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:41.760]  to me you know once you have the mindset and you see it all then you don't need alex Jones anymore
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.560]  and that's my mission is to go hey i'm not telling you what to think just change your perspective
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:52.160]  a little and look from the enemy's perspective and then everything makes sense and i've had general
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:57.760]  flint and people tell me the same thing it's not me it's my perspective it's just like a hidden
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:01.520]  image that most people can't see but you change your perspective a little and suddenly you can see
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:06.080]  it i'm not telling you what to think i'm simply saying hey look at it from this angle now do you

[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:14.720]  without further ado mr selb hey thanks a lot to Tyler and alex a pleasure being on the show thank
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:20.000]  you very much hey listen uh just briefly your little piece back there about about bill gates
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.520]  you're talking about it's very interesting you mentioned his name because you know bill gates
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:29.360]  himself post base pays income taxes however the bill gates foundation where the real money is
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:34.960]  doesn't pay at time there's another example of where those people are just getting away with murder
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:42.320]  and lies and cheats on their iris but legally as well as other things pertaining to you know
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:47.120]  there's two two systems out there one for the elites and one for everybody else listening
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:52.000]  right now and that's a really good example of it the bill gates foundation is nothing but one
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:58.560]  gigantic worthless ripoff now you don't mind i'd like to talk just for a second about taxes
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:06.240]  okay yes sir okay number one uh you know ukraine war what's that got to do with the iris nothing on
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:12.480]  the surface but we think about it we all know about the 87 billion dollars 87 billion that the
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:19.360]  us has poured into the ukraine for tanks and guns and bombs etc etc well that same federal government
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:26.080]  is busy hiring 87 000 agents to go into war against us the ordinary taxpayer and that is the truth
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:33.360]  last month they hired 4672 new agents beyond the ones they had for previous month they're hiring
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:39.120]  to rate of 5000 a month because they want to climb up to that 87 000 the point being is that they are
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:45.840]  pouring huge resources into the iris to go after literally to go after ordinary taxpayers and they're
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:51.360]  playing serious ball here by that i mean they're not just going after audits they're not just going
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:56.960]  after non-filers they're going after little guys there's an example right here of just last week
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:02.720]  an ordinary contractor guy made a couple hundred grand a year didn't file for two years seriously
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:08.640]  for two years hundred grand a year as a contractor you know what he got 311 days in jail you talk about
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:14.800]  breaking these they're sending to jail it's gotten that bad now there's they are really super aggressive
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:17.760]  now i don't want anybody to think out there they're going to jail because they didn't file their
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:23.280]  test terms but we do know that post-covid there was a record number of non-filers so a lot of
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:28.640]  people listening right now have not filed their returns for 21 or even 22 listen the time to do
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:34.000]  it is now because the irs is absolutely they they're gunning for you and they're gunning hard
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:38.080]  terry stay right there i'm gonna come back give me the floor to talk about this because i love my
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:42.960]  listeners and if they choose to just run and gun and not be part of the system and be jesse james
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:48.080]  more power to them but instead the other way is to know all the tricks and not pay the globalist
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:53.200]  hardly anything if you'll just use the globalist tricks with and it's all legal we'll be right

[02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:26.880]  the globalists think you're stupid they don't want you to know why the tax code's 50,000 pages long
[02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:32.400]  because they have all the loopholes and escape portal for themselves that you can use and they
[02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:36.880]  change it every two years that's why we've got the folks at american tax solutions linked to it by
[02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:42.800]  jones taxrelief.com terry selb you got cut off by the break start over hey listen i'm gonna tell you
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:47.440]  something else you mentioned earlier you're saying about i can't wait to see it about fauchy and his
[02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:53.760]  lies well yeah fauchy's lie are all right but the lies started way before then the lies started back
[02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:59.760]  in 1960s and 1970s about the people my age retirees that are out there the lies started back then
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:04.720]  about the american dream that's the one where you work for 40 years you're done working you have a 401k
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:09.360]  you have a house and a boat on the lake and you smoke a cigar and retire that was a lie
[02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:14.320]  that we were told 40 years ago and pump billions and billions of trillion dollars in the gigantic
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:19.840]  funds now that contain all of our retirement money now what's the real result the real result as
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:24.880]  far as that was one big lie because everyone out there knows that's getting social security or
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:30.960]  it's going to get social security that you can get tax you get taxed three ways three ways you're
[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:37.200]  if you're working 62 years old or 58 63 and working to get any level of social security and working
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:41.920]  your retax on your social security when you receive it your taxed on your income when you
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:48.080]  receive it and any retirement funds that you put aside for retirement is then being deferred and being
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:54.720]  taxed today so the big lie that we were told 30 40 years ago that save your money put it in 401k
[02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:59.920]  defer your taxes and save for later what happens is that when later rolls around which is now
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:05.360]  you get the retirement money out for your 401k of 10 grand and your taxed twice the rate i would
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:11.360]  have been 40 years ago if i just put it in savings account so the whole thing has been a ruse a setup
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:17.120]  over the years for these gigantic gigantic globalists that collect all this money in these so-called
[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:23.120]  retirement funds and i'm the one paying the bill pulling the money out it's one big rip up how do
[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:29.920]  we stop that we stop that by recharacterizing income in other words when we go in for a lot of our
[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:36.640]  clients we're able to go in and recast how the retirement accounts are set up so vastly lower
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:44.080]  their tax rate on that front how do we do it we do it by getting by recasting income in terms of
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:49.600]  how we report income that's where our tax lawyers come into play in other words accountants cpa's
[02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:53.840]  tax papers hey there's a dime a dozen they're all over the place all they do is fill out our tax
[02:22:53.840 --> 02:23:00.880]  return and say here pay the bill what we do is we go and do a deep dive a deep dig into every
[02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:06.400]  single return we get transcripts from the irs every last thing they know we know everything
[02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:12.400]  they know before we file a return to minimize if not eliminate any possibly of audits whatsoever
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:18.720]  another thing we do is is is engage in the practice of of taking the money that let's say some small
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:23.200]  contractor just the average guy out there working instead of getting taxed at ordinary
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:28.080]  raise and paying social security tax we're able to recharacterize that income get them off a
[02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:33.040]  schedule c get them into a c corporation that tyler's talked about before as well as other
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:36.960]  entities like that in other words i don't want to go too deep in the weeds on this tyler's talked
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:42.080]  about it before quite a bit but the point is us is that if you think you're paying too much
[02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:48.640]  in taxes you probably are and there's ways to avoid that and we know how to do it we really do
[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:53.680]  we've had countless clients over the years on a going forward basis we save them a lot of money
[02:23:53.680 --> 02:24:01.200]  and we do it by by simply reworking the way their money is being reported to the irs yeah to report
[02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:07.040]  every time to the irs someone's understand me but how that income's characterized that's what
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:11.840]  the big boys do that's how they save all their money those gigantic corporations out there
[02:24:11.840 --> 02:24:19.280]  they're all part of this you know huge uh uh agglomeration of money sorry to the top
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:23.520]  they all have thousands and thousands of tax attorneys working for each corporation literally
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:30.400]  fighting the irs every single day your listeners have the opportunity to save money the same way
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:36.160]  the big boys do because we we use the same tactics we use the same thing that all those big
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:42.560]  corporations use it's called the us tax code except we use it for the little guy there's ways to do
[02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:48.160]  that and the only way to access that is either read the tax code yourself which is 60 000 pages
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:53.280]  that's about 40 years read and still haven't finished it or have a competent tax attorney
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:57.920]  take a look at your situation and i know we'll be able to save you significant amounts of money
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:03.520]  of taxes that includes w2 wage earners there's things that can be done on all fronts to reduce
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:10.720]  and lower taxes it's extremely important that all your listeners understand that we don't want to
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:16.800]  defer tax that's the way it was in the 60s and 70s that's old thinking 401k retirement accounts
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:22.640]  that's old thinking the new thinking is avoid tax and how you avoid it is how it's characterized
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:27.520]  how it's reported and what you do with it so we can take retirement accounts today and convert them
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:33.920]  to substantially reduce your tax liabilities on any retirement accounts that are out there and
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:38.240]  then to get around this problem being double tax on social security we know the tricks on how to
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:43.920]  get around those problems so you're not being overtaxed because many many many people out there
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:48.960]  especially small business owners that have the uc phas or bookkeepers wind up overstating their
[02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:53.200]  income they wind up reporting more than they really made because they're just bookkeeping
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:58.480]  profits we call those phantom profits and there's countless clients over the years i can't tell you
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:03.200]  how many that have come to us showing that they made their accountants said they made 100,000
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:08.240]  or 50,000 or 40,000 or whatever and they say to us we never got that money i didn't really receive
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:13.280]  that and that's because they're just accounting profits while as tax attorneys we're able to
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:18.880]  recharacterize that income so it's not just paper profits instead we report what they really made
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:23.440]  we just always substantially less can you give us and it's so easy to do can you give us example
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:27.520]  you've done it for us and and we've been audited it went through great everything's fine uh they do
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:34.400]  it to us all the time explain to me just on average examples without saying names of what you can do
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:42.000]  oh sure uh we had a client that's countless but one comes to mind is the client we had a couple
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.480]  of months ago where uh they were receiving money from uh from a trust and they were getting about
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:55.040]  $10,000 a month and uh it was just being taxes ordinary income and we put that into a c-corp
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:00.000]  it's a simple thing to do and then we're able to wind up with having a corporate tax of much
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:06.160]  much lower rate and a personal income tax of near zero we basically zeroed out someone who was paying
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:12.080]  about $4,000 a month in taxes we brought it down to a near zero for them and the corporation
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:16.960]  paid i think around three or four percent overall tax they searched tax savings and people asked how
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:21.840]  this is possible because the elite wrote it for themselves all the people with all the rules and
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:26.320]  all the rules are completely wanted to present for younger people it's like a video game you know
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:30.000]  i used to play video games someone i was a teenager and i didn't want to be like the other kids that
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:35.840]  would uh you know back to you get magazines that would you buy magazines that told you the cheat
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:40.240]  codes on mario brothers or whatever and you could then go do a certain thing on the game and it would
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:45.600]  give you unlimited lives i never wanted that but with taxes you do there's literally codes out there
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:52.480]  that just gets you out of it absolutely to avoid taxes that's that's the key here it used to be
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:58.720]  deferred taxes we're all about avoiding taxes and in plain English that means ratcheting it down
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:05.520]  that means yeah uh using the tax code to your advantage the IRS is out there and believe and
[02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:10.240]  as CPAs are the worst CPAs all they care about is making sure that the books are balanced and that
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:14.640]  the profit and loss thing is correct yeah that's all important but how much you pay at taxes
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:19.200]  they don't think about that that's what we do we look at what how they how they're shaped how

[02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:27.600]  terry cell but one of the top tax experts in the country with a company with hundreds of lawyers
[02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:33.200]  and cpa's that know the loopholes the system uses it changes every two years that's why cpa's won't
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:36.560]  tell you about it because they don't want to know about it and they don't want to stand behind the
[02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:42.320]  tax returns they overpay these guys stand behind it when they certify it jones tax relief.com takes

[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:53.200]  all right terry you're you're you're you're chomping at the bit during the break you only covered
[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:57.440]  two of your points you got like 10 more and there's a real urgency with with this uh
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.640]  tax time coming up here in april so hit them hard on the corner now it's coming up pretty quick here
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:09.120]  you know and very quick and so now is the time don't wait till april 18th you know that's too late
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:16.400]  but do it now before tax returns to do i want to point out a very important thing here which is that
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:21.760]  a common theme we've had around here and it really is true which is that the irs has been weaponized
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:27.280]  by the government it's a weapon in other words it truly is a war and you truly need a defense army
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:33.040]  in order to defend yourself in this war uh you know and in order to do that and what tyler
[02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:37.840]  talked about in the past i'll talk about now a couple minutes is that the importance in a war
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:43.280]  is to have a strategic plan you heard about in ukraine for example the so-called spring offensive
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:48.800]  that's a plan they're working on it's just tricky it's a plan that's what we do we do strategic
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:54.560]  planning for texas but it is a war and the spring offensive for us starts now this april 18th it
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:59.760]  goes forward we have to have a plan a smart person out there you don't have to be a millionaire you
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:05.760]  don't have to be a big big bucks guy to be uh benefit from tax planning the average taxpayer
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:12.160]  out there give us a call we can we can show you and guide you through the through the tax code
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:18.960]  to set up things that really truly can help you it's called tax planning now i also want to briefly
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:26.720]  touch on crypto a word about crypto last year you may recall tyler's talked about this the first
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:34.640]  question on the 1040 was the following do you own any cryptocurrency well let me tell you that is a
[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:42.080]  trick question if you check yes they don't look at your return if you check no i don't own cryptocurrency
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:47.280]  those returns are auditing those returns are going after it's a trick question by the irs
[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:52.800]  look on this yours it's on this year's returns as well first question asked do you own any cryptocurrency
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:57.280]  if you check no you're open yourself up for an audit but you got to tell the truth that's where
[02:35:57.280 --> 02:36:03.360]  they get you and that's where we come in to make sure that you are not being audited unfairly
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:10.640]  and more importantly that you're not being uh you're not being uh hammered by the irs by inflated
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:16.080]  taxes uh because they think you made money you really didn't make on the whole crypto side if
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:22.880]  you're in crypto you had crypto all i can tell you is that it is absolutely imperative that you
[02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:28.240]  take you know a very aggressive stance against the irs when it comes to crypto because they are
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:33.600]  taking a very aggressive stance against you anybody out there that's crypto must understand
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:39.360]  that you are going to get screwed unless you give professional advice because the way it's set up
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:45.680]  right now and it's set up as a as a as a war where they're going to win unless you have a defense set
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:51.600]  up because with crypto specifically they wind up having to come up with calculations as to what
[02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:59.680]  your gains are that are always way more than you truly are it's called crypto currency analysis
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:05.680]  in other words any anyone out there crypto gets a 1099 it's inflated many times it shows way more
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:12.080]  you really made and we have crypto specialists here who do nothing but untangle that very complex
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:17.840]  uh blockchain chain web uh analysis in order to come up with what your actual gain is versus
[02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:24.320]  what it states in your 1099 that's a very very important thing don't get screwed by the irs
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:30.080]  with a 1099 that's incorrect because they're saying you made a gain that you really didn't make
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:34.880]  we have hundreds and hundreds of clients that have this problem and we've whacked down their taxes
[02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:40.880]  from you know $15,000 down to near zero many times your losses that's not uncommon so many
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:47.520]  crypto holders out there be worry of it be careful because they will they will um way overstate uh
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:52.720]  your uh your income and we know how to change that how to fix that legally main name of the game
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:58.160]  here main message is that avoid taxes legally i'm with alex you know if you want to not pay
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:03.360]  i'm not advised you do that bad idea probably to break the law but you want to follow the law
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:08.720]  and be a lawful taxpayer we can guide you we can take you through that trail that can be complicated
[02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:13.200]  sometimes but we dumb it down for you and make it so you understand it and we understand it
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:18.400]  and the irs understands it and the winner is you and the loser is the irs we have saved thousands
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:23.600]  and thousands of dollars on a daily basis with taxpayers that come to us for this problem so
[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:30.080]  be wary of crypto now a brief word about what happens this year or last year if you filed your
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:36.560]  tax returns and you owe them money well for god's sake still just send them a check and here's why
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:44.000]  i learned a long time ago and this is true every tax is negotiable that is the fact every tax is
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:49.200]  negotiable some more than others depends on the situation but what i'm telling you is that if you
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:56.560]  owe a bunch of money from 2022 21 last couple three years don't just write on my check because
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:39:00.240]  you're going to get screwed because you're going to whack with penalties and interests and things
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:04.720]  you don't have to pay and what you're saying right here i'm an interrupter is so key i have family
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:08.880]  and friends who the irs will come back two years later and say oh you didn't pay this penalty
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:13.760]  and interest and i'll beg them to go get a good tax lawyer which doesn't even cost much and i've
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:18.560]  sent a lot of them to you but before i got you guys because you had so many great reviews and
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:24.960]  friends that used you and they literally usually talk it down by 60 70 percent so so many people
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:30.960]  so there's some that avoid it and and you know live out by you by the river that that's their
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:36.480]  issue but there's others that just get raped and most just get raped and and and don't even try to
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:43.520]  negotiate it the whole thing is that you see these get the bill and it gets back to cpa's cba hands
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:50.240]  in the bill or the bookkeeper or you know uh uh some tax preparation company and says here here's
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:57.200]  your tax bill 31 000 they stare at it or stupidly ready to check out don't write out that check call
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:40:03.600]  us i guarantee you we get that number whacked down guarantee you we do every single time
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:10.080]  with rare exception don't overpay just because it says it doesn't mean you know it very important
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:16.560]  thing to know and we know what's real and what's not because you know it really is there's a
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:21.440]  amounts of lying in the sense that the irs the irs will never lie to you but they will never tell
[02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:27.040]  you the truth but that i mean if you ask them oh by the way if you ask the exact right question
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:32.800]  can i get my taxes reduced if i do this or if i uh apply for a penalty of payment do it this way
[02:40:32.800 --> 02:40:37.680]  can i get my penalty reduced they will tell you the truth if you ask the exact correct question
[02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:41.600]  however if you don't ask the correct question like can i get my tax reduced they're gonna say no
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:47.680]  because they're not gonna tell you how to do it even if you can do it so you've got to know the
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:53.920]  specific magic words in the code the magic words and and their and the magic words are contained
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:59.520]  in 60 000 pages of a tax code and it takes years and years to really understand what the
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:04.960]  abracadabra is so to speak in other words what is the real way to get it cut so the real message
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:10.640]  here is anybody out there that's finally returned this year you wind up with an unexpected tax that
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:16.640]  doesn't look right to you call us because you're probably right it isn't correct and even if you
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:23.360]  think it is correct call us because i'm sure we can get it reduced in many cases and as for
[02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:28.240]  past taxes that are due for god's sake don't just send them a check whatever you do don't just call
[02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:32.320]  and set up some payment plan and by the way this is an important dad because you know my dad owned
[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:36.160]  a bunch of dental offices a lot of family business i've seen this before my dad had tax lawyers back
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:40.560]  in the 80s and 90s and he's somewhere great somewhere you know you want the ones that fully
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:44.800]  certify you and stand behind it but so many tax lawyers don't have enough customers so they
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:49.120]  string you along and charge you a bunch of money you guys just look at the paperwork look at the code
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:54.080]  and then just move quickly and save people money by cutting to the chase so many other tax attorneys
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:42:00.960]  who are better than cpas do not cut to the chase you guys are really fast we look at it and we
[02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:05.440]  know we don't we don't move too fast because we have to be very very careful because this doesn't
[02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:12.080]  involve thinking you know and researching but we move expeditiously and get cases in the things
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:16.800]  the two things we enjoyed the most is bringing clients in and closing cases those are two things
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:21.280]  we like the most bring them in isn't it true when you're big and respected like you are the IRS also
[02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:24.960]  knows you're not playing around oh they know we're not playing around because we got the

[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:34.000]  there's countless cases over the years but even the recent last few months they come to mind of

[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:42.640]  is in deep crap we already knew all this but now the rats are leaving the sinking ship
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:47.760]  welcome back to terry selb american tax solutions linked through at jones taxrelief.com
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:54.800]  so we can get the credit for the sponsorship or 800-860723 and tax times here folks so get in there
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:59.360]  now talk to them get a consultation they're great people see what they can do for you but you were
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:04.320]  saying somewhere went to break and i know this because i had another tax firm who did a great
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:09.200]  job and you guys looked at it certified it and we got audited over it and the irs actually just
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:15.920]  said this year okay that's true you're absolutely right we'd overpaid taxes four plus million dollars
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:21.120]  in the last four years um and that's why i was making no money or did that money to fund the
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:25.920]  operation that money then came back and was critical to even stay on here so that's what
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:31.920]  happened with me just using cpas my own advice was do this i didn't do it and i got audited and
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:36.320]  the the tax lawyers were right uh you guys looked at it and been doing my stuff and said you can do
[02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:43.280]  even more and i've had outside groups checked out and they say dead on so it's insane that big firms
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:49.120]  big cpa firms just just literally will not do your taxes right and i guess that changed what
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:54.640]  about 15 years ago we're used to they didn't have liability for what advice they gave once they have
[02:48:54.640 --> 02:49:01.280]  liability they just pay extra money to the irs is that accurate to say oh that's a hundred percent
[02:49:01.280 --> 02:49:06.400]  accurate ellison furthermore you know um like you know when i first started studying tax i think
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:10.960]  the apollo 11 took off with a long time ago and things have changed a lot since then one thing
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:16.480]  that has not changed is what you're talking about in terms of the irs our excuse the cpas
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:20.960]  and accounts of those people really just screwing their own clients because they really
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:26.240]  don't care they just want to pay the fee do the return instead of on their way and it becomes
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:30.640]  their problem you know as far as what goes on but you guys make money on saving money legally
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:37.760]  we save them we i i give you a case of several cases of become the mind but do you want to
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:44.800]  mention just quickly a word about state taxes because the irs is one thing hey they're like
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:51.040]  child's play compared to some states oh i know and i'm kidding certain states most states out there
[02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:57.040]  for example if you're so much as one minute late in paying taxes let's say you owe $100 it becomes
[02:49:57.040 --> 02:50:03.920]  $145 the following day furthermore with the irs is a 10-year statute of limitations with many states
[02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:09.440]  there's no limit we have countless clients over the years that owe literally this is really true
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:18.400]  they call us and they owe $73,000 the state of georgia one true example $73,000 is for taxes
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:28.160]  that they owed in 2009 where they owed $2,000 $3,000 but because of the of the continuing penalties
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:35.760]  they're just obscene it turns into a $73,000 tax net and growing and never goes away we know how
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:42.400]  to make it go away so those state taxes can be just horrific and there's no end in sight in
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:46.240]  terms of how far they go back but but let me guess because this has happened to us over the years
[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:51.040]  of online sales we go out get the right tax firm they look at it the states will come at you but
[02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:55.040]  they'll always violate the law and don't do it properly but if you don't know how to respond
[02:50:55.040 --> 02:50:58.880]  they can totally screw you grab grab your bank accounts but if you have lawyers on what they're
[02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:04.240]  doing it's boom done speaking speaking of grabbing bank accounts you know we had a client in north
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:09.120]  carolina for example recently where this guy had a corporation it was that was that was set up
[02:51:09.120 --> 02:51:15.600]  correctly but it was a corporation and the IRS went in there and grabbed I think it was $111,000
[02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:20.640]  every dime they had in their account as an operating company they were in the garbage business at any
[02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:27.680]  rate the IRS grabbed $111,000 cash out of their bank and we're absolutely not going to give it back
[02:51:27.680 --> 02:51:33.760]  to them we stepped in and we took some we became very aggressive with that rebel officer we're
[02:51:33.760 --> 02:51:38.960]  not afraid of rebel officers and we got a hold of that rebel officer and we played hard ball
[02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:45.440]  to make a long story short this is true within 11 days or 12 days after that that in fact the
[02:51:45.440 --> 02:51:49.440]  money was taken out of their account and the check was written to the IRS and was delivered to the
[02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:55.760]  rebel office office and she took the check and re deposited herself back into the taxpayers account
[02:51:56.800 --> 02:52:01.360]  that's tough to do but we did it we're not afraid of the IRS we're not afraid of rebel
[02:52:01.360 --> 02:52:04.480]  officers but spend some time on that because you've got countless stories we'll come back on
[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:07.840]  and talk about them but you know how to let them know when they violated the law or done something
[02:52:07.840 --> 02:52:12.800]  wrong but again you know all the magic lingo fast let me tell you right now in other words
[02:52:12.800 --> 02:52:17.520]  we don't just stop when it comes to the IRS we don't just call a rebel officer we go to the we
[02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:22.480]  go to the management of the rebel officers group group if need be we go to their supervisor we
[02:52:22.480 --> 02:52:26.960]  move up the chain we know how to cut through the red tape to get to the top to solve tax problems
[02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:32.480]  we have rebel officers or or taxes of agents that are out there of the e7000 plus they're
[02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:37.120]  trying to get money out of our clients we know where to go and we know how to throw everything
[02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:44.160]  we've got at them this is a war it really truly is and it's just like as i said before developing
[02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:48.880]  a strategy not going forward as well but also if you've already been nailed by them and let me tell
[02:52:48.880 --> 02:52:55.440]  you if you owe them money if you owe them any money don't don't be fooled covid happened the
[02:52:55.440 --> 02:53:00.640]  clutches shut down they've come back and they've come back hard and they've come back strong so
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:07.360]  don't feel comfortable have you seen the videos of the 87 000 they're training with guns these people
[02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:12.000]  i mean they're literally hiring idiots don't even know what they're doing last month they hired them
[02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:17.680]  that's an absolute fact and they're hiring 5 000 more a month this just isn't stopping and these
[02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:22.720]  agents are out there with guns and badges let me tell you something i want to show you this
[02:53:22.720 --> 02:53:29.840]  this is recently handed out to these agents it's called the tax crimes handbook handed out to
[02:53:29.840 --> 02:53:35.600]  revenue agents it used to be it was strictly over with the uh uh the uh group that they
[02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:41.840]  handled criminal prosecutions for the irs now field agents are being handed tax crime handbook
[02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:47.280]  they're looking for ways that they're all people in jail it's gotten that bad that's serious so if
[02:53:47.280 --> 02:53:52.560]  people thought the irs was bad before it's being completely weaponized oh this is this is a new
[02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:58.720]  game this is a new game they're into they're out playing hardball because for two years covid plus
[02:53:58.720 --> 02:54:04.720]  they were fast asleep but they are awake they're alive they're well and they're growing and they're
[02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:11.360]  and the army is getting larger and larger and larger we have the resources we have the knowledge
[02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:17.920]  we know the law and we use it to help our clients to the absolute well the bible says the people
[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:22.080]  perish for lack of knowledge and so they have these idiots that are just giving a handbook with
[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:26.400]  a badge and gun to run out and shake down grandmas but as soon as they've got a powerful tax firm
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:31.840]  behind them a lot different behavior listen half the time half most of the time the majority of
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:36.800]  the time when we see audits for example we laugh at them because we look at the audits it's done by
[02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:42.320]  some g6 clerk you know down at the irs and maybe got out of high school but they do an audit and
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:46.400]  they assess them a hundred thousand dollar taxes we laugh at it we laugh at it because you see how
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:51.040]  stupid they were ignorant i'm talking about the irs agents that do the audits what you're saying is
[02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:55.920]  they implement it wrong and so that's why you got them what i'm saying is that these people the irises
[02:54:55.920 --> 02:55:01.040]  know what they're doing when you do these audits they just throw arbitrary numbers out there we go
[02:55:01.040 --> 02:55:05.840]  and i'm not trying to be mean but look at the people there i mean police get years of training
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:09.760]  and still have problems they're literally giving them days of training and then badges and guns
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:16.400]  30 days 30 days a badge and a gun out you go and along with a manual on on a tax crime handbook
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:21.520]  you know a tax crime handbook i've never heard of them my whole life it's absolutely absurd
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:25.840]  they're absolutely fresh out of school well obama said they want their own new national police force
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:31.040]  and that's what they're doing that's tantamount to that if i was about a police force i would call
[02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:34.640]  more like a police i'd like an army as close as they're doing because at least at least the police
[02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:40.960]  have some limitations these guys don't agree it's a total gun force it really is but i really want
[02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:47.040]  to emphasize that you know i mean this is a one more quick little story very brief a woman in
[02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:52.720]  new york this totally is true good good good that the state taxes this woman owed uh nine
[02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:57.360]  thousand some odd dollars to the state of new york went back maybe three or four years she was 78
[02:55:57.360 --> 02:56:02.160]  years old and i swear to him as a client before we could file the power returning the following
[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:06.880]  days she called me another we had not yet been a steppin represent her the very next day she
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:12.960]  called me in tears i said what's the matter she said oh my god the revenue officer came to my
[02:56:12.960 --> 02:56:19.440]  house today this is totally true in brooklyn and took my tv i swear to god i swear that's true
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:25.280]  this is about four years ago that's the extremes they'll go to is absolutely nutty and vicious so
[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:30.960]  it's far more than a police activity i'd call it a war or a police state in many and many
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:36.960]  respect the sheriff of nottingham running around robbing people it really is easy yeah i'd say it's
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:43.600]  more like you know i uh kim they're in north korea you know that's closer to that you know
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:48.960]  i'm gonna do five more minutes with you and i'm gonna take the calls i promise robert matt erin
[02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:54.800]  sam i'm gonna hit the uh the redfield news as well but but we gotta talk about this because
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:56:59.840]  again this is total weaponization they know the general public doesn't know their rights
[02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:05.040]  when you know your rights you are absolutely taken care of but if you don't you're insane so folks
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:11.200]  this is like getting parachuted into the frozen arctic without a coat and and and you know gloves

[03:00:55.360 --> 03:00:59.600]  ladies tv and you know in new york city i mean they're just out of control but when they know

[03:01:05.280 --> 03:01:09.920]  talking about being on your knees praying to lord i agree with that but i was also taught that the
[03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:14.800]  lord helps those who help themselves and so in other words you got to protect yourself
[03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:18.880]  from what's going on out there don't expect you know someone's gonna have to help you out here
[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:23.840]  it takes lawyers it takes it takes real effort to solve these problems i had a little client
[03:01:23.840 --> 03:01:29.360]  a couple years ago he was paralyzed he was a quadriplegic from an accident he was paid for
[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:34.160]  nine years on disability he had i think it was four five thousand dollars a month he was taxed
[03:01:34.160 --> 03:01:40.400]  wrongfully taxed every year for nine years you got the iris claimed the guy owned literally um
[03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:47.760]  98 thousand dollars to 250 they took all the money from him every dime every penny he had he
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:54.640]  was a quadriplegic we went in there filed the returns correctly got a 100 refund on all money's
[03:01:54.640 --> 03:02:01.520]  taken and normal rule is you can't get refunds past three years we went back nine years and you're
[03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:06.320]  able to legally do that you see that's a good example where the laws like the average taxpayer
[03:02:06.320 --> 03:02:12.960]  oh after three years i can't get refunds but the law also says that if this is where you qualify
[03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:18.640]  you can go back indefinitely we've had cases we've gone back 11 12 years and gotten refunds
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:22.880]  from clients that overpaid from the past we get a lot of calls from clients that have
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:28.560]  filed in the past they think something's wrong they bring it to us we find out it is wrong
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:35.040]  and we go back and file a many returns and get gigantic refunds that's not uncommon so the theme
[03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:40.720]  is if you think you're paying too much you're probably right give us a call we can figure it out
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:46.320]  it's tax season is right here right now this minute and that's why we're trying to let your folks
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:51.200]  know that look there's ways to protect you and bottom line the sheriff of nottingham's coming
[03:02:51.200 --> 03:02:56.640]  you need to protect yourself you better believe it and the sheriff's coming and he's coming you know
[03:02:56.640 --> 03:03:01.760]  to get more than just a few people we have an audit protection plan out there that we offer
[03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:06.720]  that helps people and protects them from being audited we know how to spot flight to counts
[03:03:06.720 --> 03:03:11.280]  before they're audited and step in there and preventive we've been happening that's a very
[03:03:11.280 --> 03:03:15.360]  common practice for a lot of our clients because they want that protection and there are ways we
[03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:20.640]  know how to do it we go into IRS file power attorney to actually see what accounts are flagged
[03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:26.080]  and not flagged and step in there and stop bodies before they happen that's a very important part
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:31.680]  what we do here is proactive preventive stuff so there's three people of three groups out there
[03:03:31.680 --> 03:03:36.640]  that have to think about taxes those that are going forward in the future the ones that got
[03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:41.280]  a file on April 18th and the ones that owe money for the past we can help all three we do help
[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:46.080]  all three and we have held thousands and thousands of clients over the years save god knows how many
[03:03:46.080 --> 03:03:50.800]  millions of dollars and if we do it because we use the tax code the way it's supposed to be used
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:57.360]  for our clients we don't work for the IRS we work for you the taxpayer and that's the one
[03:03:57.360 --> 03:04:01.360]  who needs to win this all right well terry very impressive great job appreciate all your help

[03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:26.160]  this day but I got behind mother news there's a bunch of other breaking news that ties into this
[03:06:26.160 --> 03:06:29.360]  the twitter files coming out on Fauci and more muskets finally delivering
[03:06:29.920 --> 03:06:35.520]  former cdc director redfield to congress covered 19 creating a lab us government fund gained a
[03:06:35.520 --> 03:06:41.680]  function research and then he says the researchers didn't like doing it at the luhan lab or at us
[03:06:41.680 --> 03:06:47.520]  labs but the military took it over and ordered us to do it so they're like okay we committed crimes
[03:06:47.520 --> 03:06:52.800]  we did it we lied to congress redfield did a year and a half ago he went I think we were doing it
[03:06:52.800 --> 03:06:58.880]  when it's out she lied he's smart he's like I know I'm just going on now he spills his guts
[03:07:00.320 --> 03:07:04.640]  and I can't play the whole two hour testimony it's on info wars.com but you got we're gonna
[03:07:04.640 --> 03:07:10.880]  play some excerpts here I mean listen to this in september 2019 three things happened in the lab
[03:07:10.880 --> 03:07:16.080]  one is they detailed uh deleted the sequences highly irregular researchers don't like to do that
[03:07:16.080 --> 03:07:21.360]  redfield said the second thing is they changed the command and control from civilian to military
[03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:27.040]  highly unusual so he's just spilling his guts in congress saying oh yeah pentagon ran this can't go
[03:07:27.040 --> 03:07:36.560]  after me for this wow Fauci is got his ass in a sling up the river play the clip here it is
[03:07:37.360 --> 03:07:44.080]  dr redfield did you agree in your opinion with dr anderson's assessment at the time
[03:07:44.080 --> 03:07:51.520]  that this virus did look engineered I was concerned because of the presence of the
[03:07:51.520 --> 03:07:56.080]  fearing cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that
[03:07:56.080 --> 03:08:02.640]  cleavage site does that cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of
[03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:09.200]  covid so it now which could not see the h2 receptor which is a human receptor it totally
[03:08:09.200 --> 03:08:14.640]  changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for a human receptor so that fear
[03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:18.400]  and cleavage site bothered me it didn't seem that it belonged there and then when you look at the
[03:08:18.400 --> 03:08:23.200]  sequences that it used and it's beyond the committee but I know many of you have looked into it
[03:08:23.200 --> 03:08:30.720]  the sequences that they used in those 12 nucleotides for arginine where the arginine sequences
[03:08:30.720 --> 03:08:37.600]  nucleotide triplet that coated for the human arginine so why did this virus have the arginine
[03:08:37.600 --> 03:08:45.120]  sequences for human they're not bad it was very disconcerting to me it looked like this virus was
[03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:50.800]  engineered was this what you're observing and speaking of is this something that would be in
[03:08:50.800 --> 03:08:56.160]  line with gain of function research and the and the capabilities that would provide to the virus
[03:08:56.160 --> 03:09:02.000]  yeah I mean basically this lab published in 2014 that they accomplished in this allowing
[03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:06.720]  the coronaviruses that they were working with in the lab to bind to the h2 receptor in humanized
[03:09:06.720 --> 03:09:13.040]  mice and the only way they did that was by reorienting the binding domain and it was clear to them
[03:09:13.040 --> 03:09:20.400]  at this time that that was likely the issue in their private conversations yet by February 4th
[03:09:21.040 --> 03:09:26.240]  a paper on the origins of coveted is drafted by four participants of the February 1 conference
[03:09:26.240 --> 03:09:32.240]  call one of those participants dr. Anderson completely reverses himself at an email to the
[03:09:32.240 --> 03:09:39.280]  president of eco health peter dosik and says the main crop crackpot theories going around at the
[03:09:39.280 --> 03:09:45.520]  moment relate to this virus being somehow engineered and that is demonstrably false
[03:09:46.480 --> 03:09:52.960]  my question to you mr. redfield did you know of any evidence that they had found within three days
[03:09:52.960 --> 03:09:58.400]  from February 1st to February 4th to be able to confirm that it was not created in a lab
[03:09:58.400 --> 03:10:02.880]  um as i mentioned earlier unfortunately i was excluded from those conversations
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:09.840]  which i found retroactively very disappointed since i was obviously a virologist and very
[03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:14.960]  engaged and i actually had asked jerry mefrar tony fouchy and tedros to have these conversations
[03:10:14.960 --> 03:10:21.440]  and then to be excluded i found unusual i do think it illustrates one point that's
[03:10:21.440 --> 03:10:26.160]  worth really focusing on when you when you have a group of people that decide there could only
[03:10:26.160 --> 03:10:31.600]  be one point of view that's problematic and i'll keep going saying it's antithetical to science
[03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:36.160]  and unfortunately that's what they did i can tell you dr redfield that is the case it's very
[03:10:36.160 --> 03:10:44.160]  problematic because how people suffered in this country from those uh what i would call um tyrannical
[03:10:44.160 --> 03:10:52.080]  decisions using the their positions of power um and shutting down the country in the way they did
[03:10:52.080 --> 03:10:57.360]  i i think people don't like to feel that way thank you i yield back i know the full articles on
[03:10:57.360 --> 03:11:07.840]  info wars dot com the full testimony ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen this is the smoking
[03:11:07.840 --> 03:11:15.760]  motherfucking gun of gain of function criminal new world order to bring down fouchy bill gates

[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:34.400]  are you the people that spoke out against us for three years not vindicated
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:40.000]  did you not bet on the right horse supporting us we got more work to do
[03:11:43.360 --> 03:11:46.880]  we're gonna get these people that are endangering our families that have killed millions
[03:11:46.880 --> 03:11:52.640]  we must for the dead and for our children of the future we must commit to it before god

[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:11.440]  points so i'll just run through as fast as i can first point i disagree about obama's third term
[03:12:11.440 --> 03:12:18.080]  i think it's bush's fifth term oh i agree with that too obama is you perfectly said obama was
[03:12:18.080 --> 03:12:24.160]  bush's third and fourth term this is the deep state's fifth term absolutely and i think that
[03:12:24.160 --> 03:12:29.760]  this closure around january sixth could create a cascade and ultimately lead to 911 truth something
[03:12:29.760 --> 03:12:35.040]  that we've all been waiting for a long time in other uh false flags uh so i'm looking for that
[03:12:35.040 --> 03:12:42.800]  domino effect uh and then my second point is uh you know i i talked with rick simpson and he's
[03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:47.120]  happy to come on your show uh and i have his contact he tells if you want to pass me over to
[03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:52.640]  your crew i can get you guys that and remind me i know i wanted him on who's rick simpson rick
[03:12:52.640 --> 03:12:58.720]  simpson is is he's like the equivalent i think that you two are probably the top guys and and
[03:12:58.720 --> 03:13:02.800]  all of the truth movements and all i remember his name but it's not it's not i'm having an
[03:13:02.800 --> 03:13:08.240]  Alzheimer's moment well who is he he fought with the canadian government because he discovered that
[03:13:08.240 --> 03:13:12.000]  cannabis cure oh yeah i remember that okay yeah yeah i remember who he is yeah okay go ahead give
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:16.000]  us the info again thank you okay let's talk to sam and tennessee sam you're on the air
[03:13:17.520 --> 03:13:21.840]  hey thank you for making my call uh just a quick question i don't expect you to know the answer
[03:13:22.480 --> 03:13:29.200]  hopefully we can crowdsource an answer so um mr sicknick is i was uh just doing quick reading
[03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:35.920]  my understanding is he died of two strokes and he was 42 years old so that he was a big trump
[03:13:35.920 --> 03:13:39.680]  supporter and we were heard critical of what happened that day very suspicious he died
[03:13:40.400 --> 03:13:45.920]  all right so here's the question does anybody know whether or not he got the clock shot because it
[03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:52.480]  came out just a month or two before this i'm sure he did as a capital officer he may be one of the
[03:13:52.480 --> 03:13:56.800]  first died suddenly i think it's a question worth asking i didn't think of that i thought did they
[03:13:56.800 --> 03:14:03.280]  murder him wow that's a good question that's all i had for today thank you that thank you sir that's
[03:14:03.280 --> 03:14:09.360]  why we love callers see it that's why the show is smart i got great guests i'm a pretty good talk
[03:14:09.360 --> 03:14:14.880]  shows the callers are amazing that's why the show's scary to the enemy because we're crowdsourcing
[03:14:14.880 --> 03:14:22.880]  what the caller said human intelligence it chills right now whoo this redfield thing is oh man i
[03:14:22.880 --> 03:14:27.760]  smell victory man they'll probably start world war three though matt in wisconsin we already did i
[03:14:27.760 --> 03:14:35.840]  guess matt go ahead hey uh mr crystal vision uh i called about 10 years ago and spoke to you and
[03:14:35.840 --> 03:14:41.920]  you talked about how like um there's a ragnarok going on that it's not just one group the chinese
[03:14:41.920 --> 03:14:46.720]  is real or whatever but a bunch of groups fighting together you know like the african saying when

[03:14:53.360 --> 03:15:00.240]  group which is the p mc private military group for russia and i didn't know the founder um was
[03:15:01.120 --> 03:15:07.280]  a jewish individual he had a jewish father and stepfather which i think is uh interesting you
[03:15:07.280 --> 03:15:12.240]  know i was speaking with relatives about the kanya stuff over there and it kind of reminded me of
[03:15:12.240 --> 03:15:19.920]  smetley butler's uh war is a racket and then also with uh nicola tesla you brought him up um i meant

[03:20:03.920 --> 03:20:16.560]  welcome back to the alex jones show and k dally your guest coach from k dally radio dot com k
[03:20:16.560 --> 03:20:21.680]  dally show so glad to be with you because i have this amazing guest for you what a great show so far
[03:20:21.680 --> 03:20:26.800]  hopefully we can just add to that today i'm talking about a huge cover-up today one of the biggest
[03:20:26.800 --> 03:20:31.040]  that you might not even be aware of i know i know you probably are aware of a lot but i don't think
[03:20:31.040 --> 03:20:35.840]  you're aware of this one as much as we should be anyway why do i talk about health so much on the
[03:20:35.840 --> 03:20:40.160]  show because the government has figured out that we're stupid enough to fall for more contrived
[03:20:40.160 --> 03:20:46.000]  illnesses and they will still more freedom under the banner of pandemic we can all be rest assured
[03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:51.760]  they're coming back for more as bill gates keeps promising us we suffered make way more from tyranny
[03:20:51.760 --> 03:20:57.360]  than we ever did fluid or the sniffles so we need all hands on deck we need you and we need you
[03:20:57.360 --> 03:21:01.520]  healthy and i really mean that and that's why supplements are so important that's why our
[03:21:01.520 --> 03:21:06.560]  health is so important right now we need you and we need you healthy because we need all the energy
[03:21:06.560 --> 03:21:11.760]  that you've got my guest is moorley robbins the great moorley robbins he is the creator and founder
[03:21:11.760 --> 03:21:17.360]  of the root cause protocol he received his ba in biology from denison university in ohio and holds an
[03:21:17.360 --> 03:21:23.840]  mba from george washington university in health care administration he wrote the book on copper it's
[03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:32.240]  called cure cure and then the byline is your fatigue q u dash re cure and one of the reasons
[03:21:32.240 --> 03:21:37.520]  that we are so very unhealthy today as we're walking around all consuming pharma every single time
[03:21:37.520 --> 03:21:44.560]  and chance that we can um moorley exposes one mineral the one mineral the most important mineral
[03:21:44.560 --> 03:21:50.560]  that has been systematically eliminated from your diet and food supply going back 80 years welcome to
[03:21:50.560 --> 03:21:56.080]  the show welcome to the alex jones show moorley robbins how are you delighted to be here kate thank
[03:21:56.080 --> 03:22:03.440]  you for the introduction and i'm sure we're going to have a very stimulating dialogue oh i i i can
[03:22:03.440 --> 03:22:08.480]  bet on it in fact this will blow people's minds you know what let's go right to some information i
[03:22:08.480 --> 03:22:14.400]  think people will be so interested in back in the 1920s they did a study on mice would you talk about
[03:22:14.400 --> 03:22:22.320]  that for just a moment sure so if i suddenly went rogue i would want to convince people
[03:22:22.320 --> 03:22:28.720]  that they were anemic but they didn't have enough iron in the body and that they were copper toxic
[03:22:28.720 --> 03:22:34.880]  and that's the prevailing myth on planet earth but the studies that you're talking about were from
[03:22:34.880 --> 03:22:43.280]  um the same year two different studies two different teams uh 1928 they fed rodents a
[03:22:43.280 --> 03:22:49.280]  diet that had no copper in it and they wanted to see what was going to happen and what they were
[03:22:49.280 --> 03:22:56.880]  surprised to discover is that when there's low copper or no copper in the diet iron starts to
[03:22:56.880 --> 03:23:04.400]  fill up in the liver and this has been known since 1928 uh heart at all 1928 mcarg at all
[03:23:04.400 --> 03:23:10.320]  1928 two separate teams when when two different teams can prove the same thing that's when i become
[03:23:10.320 --> 03:23:17.520]  science so we've known this for almost a hundred years now and we live in a very um different
[03:23:17.520 --> 03:23:26.080]  world than we think we do because no one knows about minerals no one knows that that these uh
[03:23:26.080 --> 03:23:32.960]  lowly little elements on the planet are actually the catalysts that run our body and farmers know
[03:23:32.960 --> 03:23:39.360]  this i'm not sure they know as much as they should know but minerals and and their balance
[03:23:39.360 --> 03:23:45.920]  which is so important in our body uh is what really drives vitality and when you start to pull
[03:23:46.560 --> 03:23:53.200]  copper out of the soil and out of the food and then it starts to be pulled out of the human
[03:23:53.840 --> 03:23:59.840]  and then you got a serious problem so we know how critical i excuse me we know how critical
[03:23:59.840 --> 03:24:05.600]  gold is to the economy when you take gold out of the economy it will collapse that seems to be the
[03:24:05.600 --> 03:24:11.280]  the train that we're riding on right now when you take silver out of your computer it doesn't work
[03:24:12.080 --> 03:24:18.640]  and when you take copper out of the human being it starts to fall apart and that's exactly where
[03:24:18.640 --> 03:24:25.440]  we find ourselves as a society today your book absolutely blew my mind i have to say a blew
[03:24:25.440 --> 03:24:31.520]  my mind because you're the history that you discuss in the book and how they used fertilizers
[03:24:31.520 --> 03:24:36.400]  chemical fertilizers as the trojan horse and i've talked about this on the show how they use
[03:24:36.400 --> 03:24:42.240]  that as the trojan horse to basically poison us but there was even more to it that i discovered
[03:24:42.240 --> 03:24:47.200]  from you and this is why i wanted to share this with people copper is the master mineral right
[03:24:47.200 --> 03:24:52.240]  it is the orchestra it's the orchestra guy it's the it's the guy that tells all the other minerals
[03:24:52.240 --> 03:24:57.600]  what to do and without it well let's just say that they knew that if they could rob us of copper
[03:24:57.600 --> 03:25:03.600]  early on generations ago that we would be a hot mess today and we are we have our health is in the
[03:25:03.600 --> 03:25:10.480]  gutter and so talk about the fertilizers what they did with glyphosate well they first started
[03:25:10.480 --> 03:25:16.560]  with npk after the first world war there were a lot of munitions left over they had to do something
[03:25:16.560 --> 03:25:21.920]  with the the nitrogen the phosphorus and the potassium well people didn't know what that was
[03:25:21.920 --> 03:25:28.640]  going to do to mineral uptake well npk blocks copper uptake in the root system of plants
[03:25:29.840 --> 03:25:36.240]  that was a pretty serious affront to farming and now today we live in an environment where
[03:25:37.440 --> 03:25:43.040]  much of the world is exposed to glyphosate or roundup some people may know it is roundup
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:50.160]  it's it's ubiquitous it's everywhere on the planet now and what people probably don't know
[03:25:50.160 --> 03:25:58.960]  know is that this supposed chemical has mineral chelating properties and they're measured on a
[03:25:58.960 --> 03:26:06.160]  logarithmic scale so we know about ph on a logarithmic scale we know about earthquakes on a logarithmic
[03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:16.880]  scale well glyphosate same scale and it chelates magnesium at a two it chelates zinc at a six
[03:26:16.880 --> 03:26:23.920]  but it chelates copper at an 11 and why is that important it means that it's taking copper out
[03:26:23.920 --> 03:26:30.640]  of the soil a billion times faster than it's taking magnesium and it's taking copper a hundred
[03:26:30.640 --> 03:26:37.760]  thousand times faster than it's taking zinc so copper's in the crosshairs and this process as
[03:26:37.760 --> 03:26:44.080]  you are mentioning it goes back about a hundred years so they've been boiling the frog they've
[03:26:44.080 --> 03:26:49.840]  been boiling the human frog one degree at a time and we just didn't know what was happening
[03:26:49.840 --> 03:26:54.560]  and so playing in the background a lot of people may be surprised to hear this but i've renamed
[03:26:54.560 --> 03:27:05.680]  covid the cov stands for coppers vanished an id stands for irons dysregulated so go back to
[03:27:05.680 --> 03:27:13.120]  those mice in 1928 take copper out what happens iron goes wild and that's what all of the symptoms
[03:27:13.120 --> 03:27:21.600]  or covet are based on iron dysregulation hyper ferritinemia high uric acid and myocarditis we
[03:27:21.600 --> 03:27:26.800]  can go on for an hour describing the symptoms and they all relate back to these two minerals
[03:27:28.160 --> 03:27:32.640]  and copper what happens is as people are told about iron consistently you're low in iron you're
[03:27:32.640 --> 03:27:38.480]  low in iron but it hides in the tissues it's not in the blood as much as we as we as we test for it
[03:27:38.480 --> 03:27:45.760]  we never test for copper but copper has to be in balance with iron absolutely has to be in balance
[03:27:45.760 --> 03:27:54.640]  and so the most important thing for the listeners to remember in this conversation low iron in the
[03:27:54.640 --> 03:28:04.320]  blood does not mean low iron in the tissue in fact it's just the opposite low iron in the blood
[03:28:04.320 --> 03:28:10.320]  usually is masking high iron stuck in the tissue and i'm sure we'll have a chance to talk further
[03:28:10.320 --> 03:28:16.560]  about that in another segment that's that's uh it's it's causing a lot of disease to happen
[03:28:16.560 --> 03:28:22.560]  pathogens happen the reason ivermectin worked is because the it would go in and it would take the
[03:28:22.560 --> 03:28:28.080]  iron that was making the pathogen grow right take that out and and help it so that it could
[03:28:28.080 --> 03:28:32.720]  deliver copper and and zinc into that cell that's why ivermectin was so effective correct we'll
[03:28:32.720 --> 03:28:37.840]  come back we'll talk about that with moorley robbins the book is cure i take his fiq copper
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:44.080]  every day we need copper you're without copper and as he says we are copper deserts we are copper
[03:28:44.080 --> 03:28:50.000]  deserts and i like his fiq copper let me tell you you need this be right back on the alex jones show

[03:33:02.800 --> 03:33:13.760]  alex jones
[03:33:13.760 --> 03:33:17.920]  back here with you on the alex jones show thank you for joining us today i'm kate dally your guest
[03:33:17.920 --> 03:33:23.280]  host from the kate dally show and my guest is moorley robbins i bring him on because his
[03:33:23.280 --> 03:33:28.400]  message is so essential to you your health we need all hands on deck right now we need you
[03:33:28.400 --> 03:33:33.200]  and we need you healthy and so this information the exposing of one of the biggest cover-ups in
[03:33:33.200 --> 03:33:39.600]  our food supply for the last 80 years this is so important 100 years actually um so here's a
[03:33:39.600 --> 03:33:45.120]  couple of things number one moorley's book cure uh your fatigue you have got to get this book it
[03:33:45.120 --> 03:33:50.160]  is filled with history too and so much more will make sense once you read this book it blew my mind
[03:33:50.160 --> 03:33:56.800]  and i i researched 12 hours a day um so the uh copper it's also called the byline on it is the
[03:33:56.800 --> 03:34:01.520]  root cause and how to fix it on your own which is so important we need to take control of our health
[03:34:01.520 --> 03:34:04.960]  so here's a couple of statements moorley correct me if i'm wrong i might be
[03:34:04.960 --> 03:34:09.840]  copper has been annihilated by glyphosate when they when they took copper out of the diet with
[03:34:09.840 --> 03:34:16.720]  mice in the 1920s the mice died of disease copper has to be balanced in your diet with other minerals
[03:34:16.720 --> 03:34:22.400]  it's the master detoxifier so dumping those shots that we just people out there took thank goodness
[03:34:22.400 --> 03:34:27.440]  i didn't dumping those shots in our bodies maybe they wouldn't have had a chance if we would have
[03:34:27.440 --> 03:34:32.320]  had enough copper in our bodies for the last 100 years to actually detoxify that our immune system
[03:34:32.320 --> 03:34:37.920]  would have had some help in detoxifying and i'm talking about the entire vax program too uh
[03:34:37.920 --> 03:34:43.120]  copper isn't just needed it's essential to your health and that's why we're walking around so
[03:34:43.120 --> 03:34:47.840]  unhealthy and doctors don't even mention it nor do they test for it what do you how do you feel
[03:34:47.840 --> 03:34:53.840]  about all those statements no i think those are accurate statements i i think the hard part kate
[03:34:53.840 --> 03:35:00.880]  is getting people to realize that um a mineral that they've never heard of or a mineral that they
[03:35:00.880 --> 03:35:07.840]  usually are uh scared of because they've been told it's toxic it's just it's insane how backwards
[03:35:07.840 --> 03:35:15.520]  the message is but but the key is it's hard to believe that this achilles heel is is what's doing
[03:35:15.520 --> 03:35:23.040]  us in and again it's we're talking about 100 milligrams of a mineral that fits on the head
[03:35:23.040 --> 03:35:30.720]  of a one inch stick pin that's a really tiny amount of of element and it i think everyone
[03:35:30.720 --> 03:35:37.440]  understands the difference between generals and foot soldiers what copper is the general in our
[03:35:37.440 --> 03:35:44.560]  body and and this is based on the experience of the chinese who've been working with healing practices
[03:35:44.560 --> 03:35:52.400]  for just a modest 5000 years but in their folklore and in their medical practices they have identified
[03:35:52.400 --> 03:36:00.400]  copper as the general and iron as the foot soldier and what happens when when the copper is missing
[03:36:00.400 --> 03:36:06.160]  well just try to picture the battle of the bulge without patent it's a very different outcome of
[03:36:06.160 --> 03:36:12.320]  that historical event and so that's what's going on inside our body is there aren't enough generals
[03:36:12.320 --> 03:36:18.560]  and the the important one of the most important aspects of copper it's it's getting it falls into
[03:36:18.560 --> 03:36:24.560]  this category of like really it does all that so there's there's only four things that copper does
[03:36:24.560 --> 03:36:32.960]  only four things creates energy that's important mitochondria don't work without copper second
[03:36:32.960 --> 03:36:38.160]  clear is exhaust you know we're used to driving cars and they produce exhaust well we produce
[03:36:38.160 --> 03:36:43.680]  exhaust in our bodies and in our mitochondria and ourselves well there are copper enzymes that are
[03:36:43.680 --> 03:36:51.840]  designed perfectly to clear that it catalyzes enzymes that's a big deal and what is an enzyme
[03:36:51.840 --> 03:36:57.440]  it's like a nanobot it's a little thing that gets things it gets stuff done and copper is one of the
[03:36:57.440 --> 03:37:04.080]  most important um catalytic agents in the body and then the fourth that i think is really tragic
[03:37:04.080 --> 03:37:11.680]  that people don't know about especially our practitioners is that copper combats enemies
[03:37:12.640 --> 03:37:22.240]  whether they're bacteria fungus virus or um any any parasites and so the issue is people are not
[03:37:22.240 --> 03:37:29.280]  aware of that and for those people who maybe um have grown up on a farm or may may actually be
[03:37:29.280 --> 03:37:36.000]  engaged in farming you know how important copper is on the farm and but the tragedy is it's been the
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:42.240]  number one defect or the number one mineral deficiency i should say but number one mineral
[03:37:42.240 --> 03:37:50.720]  deficiency for 80 years and and if it's deficient on the farm we know it's deficient in the food
[03:37:50.720 --> 03:37:58.320]  supply and so a very important um Australian farmer her name is pat colby she's written a whole
[03:37:58.320 --> 03:38:04.080]  series of books on farming natural goat care and cattle care and horse care and sheep care
[03:38:04.720 --> 03:38:10.480]  but she makes a very important point in these and all four of these books she says that any animal
[03:38:11.200 --> 03:38:20.000]  that is copper deficient has parasites oh any animal that has parasites is copper deficient
[03:38:21.040 --> 03:38:27.840]  well if i learned anything if we've learned anything from the the 2020 through 2023 period
[03:38:27.840 --> 03:38:35.520]  is that what is a virus oh it's it's the excrement from parasites and that's a really important
[03:38:35.520 --> 03:38:43.680]  thing to know and so that means that playing in the background worldwide was copper deficiency
[03:38:44.320 --> 03:38:50.800]  because the transmission of the parasite was so fast and so if you don't understand the dynamics
[03:38:50.800 --> 03:38:56.560]  and the power of minerals well then it would be very easy to fall into the the condition of fear
[03:38:56.560 --> 03:39:03.840]  that we all fell into and and what does fear do well again if i if i spell cure differently
[03:39:04.560 --> 03:39:11.440]  i'm going to spell fear differently and i spell fear f e hyphen a r and it's important for people
[03:39:11.440 --> 03:39:20.160]  to realize is that when you're in a state of fear you're attracting iron to your body and that iron
[03:39:20.160 --> 03:39:27.440]  is activating rust in your body we don't call it rust in the world of medicine we call it oxidative
[03:39:27.440 --> 03:39:35.040]  stress it's a very lofty term but it's rust it's oxygen interacting with iron and it's creating
[03:39:35.040 --> 03:39:41.440]  chaos inside our body whether it's neuro inflammation fatty liver disease heart disease
[03:39:41.440 --> 03:39:49.920]  chronic kidney disease arthritis i don't care what it is and and what as a former hospital executive
[03:39:49.920 --> 03:39:57.760]  and consultant what surprised me was that all of the conditions i think they're like 25 000 in the
[03:39:57.760 --> 03:40:07.200]  merc manual all come in on oxidative stress and if you don't have bioavailable copper to regulate
[03:40:07.200 --> 03:40:14.640]  the iron and the oxygen to prevent the oxidative stress then nature is just going to take its course
[03:40:14.640 --> 03:40:20.160]  and it's going to begin to wear us down and probably a really important thing for your listeners
[03:40:20.160 --> 03:40:27.200]  to understand is that if they're at all worried about aging aging is just a it's just shorthand
[03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:33.600]  for iron accumulation and there's some famous papers that have been written about the nine
[03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:40.880]  hallmarks of aging now superseded by the 12 hallmarks of aging guess what all 12 come back
[03:40:40.880 --> 03:40:47.120]  to this copper iron conflict and the creation of oxidative stress well i think that's important
[03:40:47.120 --> 03:40:53.120]  for the public to know i think it's more important for the practitioners to know that but in this
[03:40:53.120 --> 03:41:00.160]  this is a battle for mind share and i think what's really going to change the the clinical practice
[03:41:00.160 --> 03:41:06.480]  is when the public stands up and demands a different level of information on the questions
[03:41:06.480 --> 03:41:11.680]  they're going to start to ask because i think it's time for people to say that they're told well
[03:41:11.680 --> 03:41:19.280]  you're anemic say well let's measure my copper status let's exhaust everything we can in my
[03:41:19.280 --> 03:41:26.240]  diet to increase my copper and then we can begin to have that iron discussion and it's it's really
[03:41:26.240 --> 03:41:31.760]  tragic that that doesn't happen more often but again we live in a in a world of being brainwashed
[03:41:31.760 --> 03:41:37.520]  we're all very aware of that and now it's time i think and i appreciate your you're just your
[03:41:37.520 --> 03:41:46.400]  passionate interest in this i think it's time for people to awaken to this new truth 100 100
[03:41:46.400 --> 03:41:54.160]  percent in fact you call you know the md the md uh label the md degree mineral deficiency which
[03:41:54.160 --> 03:41:58.480]  i absolutely love because doctors if a doctor gives you a blank stare and says you don't need to
[03:41:58.480 --> 03:42:03.680]  worry about copper you could be toxic and copper that's not true we're copper deserts as you say
[03:42:03.680 --> 03:42:08.400]  and the other thing is is understanding how they've been trained since the johns hopkins medical
[03:42:08.400 --> 03:42:14.400]  school took over per the rockefellers once that was established minerals were out the out the
[03:42:14.400 --> 03:42:20.560]  window and we never heard about them again in fact on a men's panel or a women's panel blood test
[03:42:20.560 --> 03:42:25.520]  they don't even include copper you actually have to pay more to try to get tested for it
[03:42:25.520 --> 03:42:30.720]  and that's insane to me because it's the master mineral and i hope people realize that this is
[03:42:30.720 --> 03:42:36.000]  the master mineral this is the mineral that is telling the other minerals what to do and if you
[03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:41.440]  don't have enough of that well we're we're wrought with disease we're walking around unhealthy and

[03:47:13.200 --> 03:47:16.480]  welcome back to the alex jones show last segment of the hour
[03:47:16.480 --> 03:47:22.080]  my guest is morley robbins he wrote the book on copper this book is so important because it's
[03:47:22.080 --> 03:47:27.760]  something we're missing that we don't even realize because we're not trained in it the doctors don't
[03:47:27.760 --> 03:47:34.480]  do any training in it and i i screwed up one of the words mineral denialist is what morley talks
[03:47:34.480 --> 03:47:39.520]  about when he says md and that is the truth they don't understand health they're there to write you
[03:47:39.520 --> 03:47:45.520]  a script for pharma i mean my gosh pharma is awfully lucky to have all these doctors running
[03:47:45.520 --> 03:47:52.960]  around writing pharma scripts for them it's just it's sickening isn't it um the fiq uh great popper
[03:47:52.960 --> 03:47:58.880]  is just so amazing and i i've been taking it let me tell you i hope people start realizing this
[03:47:58.880 --> 03:48:05.360]  cover-up i'm so glad you've exposed this i'm so glad you wrote this book morley now happy
[03:48:05.360 --> 03:48:10.480]  happy to be uh bringing this message forward and delighted to have the uh this kind of conversation
[03:48:10.480 --> 03:48:16.320]  and just your your curiosity again we got a spell right but it's it's very infectious and i think
[03:48:16.320 --> 03:48:23.600]  it's important to be able to hear this the thing is it um it's time our back is against the wall
[03:48:23.600 --> 03:48:29.520]  right i'm absolutely convinced that the window is closing and we need to take the steps to
[03:48:30.480 --> 03:48:37.600]  educate and make people more aware of this and so the the um you mentioned hopkins so i wanted
[03:48:37.600 --> 03:48:42.800]  people to know that i grew up in baltimore as i noted to you my nickname is baltimore league
[03:48:43.600 --> 03:48:52.480]  that's what my all the sun calls me and uh and so hopkins is a really important epicenter
[03:48:52.480 --> 03:48:58.400]  for medicine as i think you know and probably your listeners know but it's it's even more important
[03:48:59.360 --> 03:49:06.000]  because it was a very important um md phd who was very clinically active at hopkins
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:14.320]  in the uh the thirties and his name was max weintraub and dr weintraub originally he was born
[03:49:14.320 --> 03:49:22.880]  and raised in canada he got his uh md degree in canada and then he came to the states got his phd
[03:49:23.440 --> 03:49:30.800]  in physiology at tulene university and then he ends up at hopkins and doctor dr weintraub was
[03:49:30.800 --> 03:49:37.440]  not just another doctor he wrote the first textbook in hematology and it's a big deal
[03:49:37.440 --> 03:49:44.000]  it was in 1942 when it was published and he he defined that field and hematology is the one
[03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:52.960]  studies blood studies minerals in the blood and dr weintraub's expertise was copper but what's
[03:49:52.960 --> 03:50:00.160]  really interesting is for some reason maybe because he was a truther i'm not sure dr weintraub
[03:50:00.160 --> 03:50:06.720]  got kicked out of hopkins and he ends up being the dean of medicine at the university of utah
[03:50:07.280 --> 03:50:14.240]  a medical school and it was a very fortuitous development because he recruited some of the
[03:50:14.240 --> 03:50:24.640]  best and brightest clinicians of that era and they engaged in 32 formal experiments in animals
[03:50:24.640 --> 03:50:29.120]  including humans experimenting with what happens if we do this to the copper what happens if we
[03:50:29.120 --> 03:50:36.720]  do that to the iron and it's mind-blowing research that has been lost to the ages people don't know
[03:50:36.720 --> 03:50:42.080]  about this legacy of research or the legacy that proceeded at university of wisconsin
[03:50:42.080 --> 03:50:48.720]  but it's very very important for people to know that that this is not my my passion around this
[03:50:48.720 --> 03:50:59.920]  is based on having read 7500 articles in the last 14 years i get up very early in the morning
[03:50:59.920 --> 03:51:06.400]  read for three hours a day seven days a week you can cover a lot of ground between five and eight
[03:51:06.400 --> 03:51:14.480]  in the morning and i and i'm really proud of that and my understanding is based on the legacy of
[03:51:14.480 --> 03:51:22.080]  research that has preceded us that there have been some amazing individuals who have devoted themselves
[03:51:22.080 --> 03:51:26.320]  to understanding this and that's really what's chronicled in the book and what and that's really
[03:51:26.320 --> 03:51:32.640]  what inspired that the supplement what really inspired it was my frustration with the fact
[03:51:32.640 --> 03:51:41.200]  that no one was talking about mineral metabolism from 2020 to 2022 and i said that's got to stop
[03:51:41.200 --> 03:51:46.320]  we've got to change that and that's what led to the creation of that particular supplement
[03:51:46.320 --> 03:51:52.560]  and it's just it's a very humble solution to a very big problem and i think what's important
[03:51:52.560 --> 03:51:59.360]  for people to realize is that sometimes big complicated problems can be solved quite simply
[03:51:59.360 --> 03:52:07.040]  it's called Occam's razor sometimes the simplest solution is best and that's really what this
[03:52:07.040 --> 03:52:11.200]  discussion is about that's what the book is about that's what the sub you know the whole
[03:52:11.200 --> 03:52:18.880]  desire is to get more people to realize how simple the solution is absolutely um and in fact i want
[03:52:18.880 --> 03:52:25.040]  you to talk just a little bit too about the brain the brain um is run by copper fat and i interviewed
[03:52:25.040 --> 03:52:31.920]  dr alfonso mozzo he's a fan fascinating maze it talks about your copper book and uh and copper
[03:52:31.920 --> 03:52:37.200]  and he said you know the brain is run by fat and copper and isn't it interesting that the two things
[03:52:37.200 --> 03:52:42.240]  they've tried to eliminate right in the 70s with the food pyramid they went into oh get rid of that
[03:52:42.240 --> 03:52:47.920]  fat and and raise the sugar level and what happened we all became obese we didn't have the obesity
[03:52:47.920 --> 03:52:54.480]  problem for the 70s as much as we have it now and then of course removing copper from the body
[03:52:54.480 --> 03:53:02.320]  and when you do that i mean no wonder no wonder so then it also it also controls fear right and so
[03:53:02.320 --> 03:53:09.040]  what they so good at presenting fear to us people are still running around in masks it's the fear
[03:53:10.000 --> 03:53:16.400]  there's three well it's actually a half a dozen changes that were made it's very simple and i
[03:53:16.400 --> 03:53:21.760]  apologize for the bank they decided to replace our porch and i had no notice of this at all so i
[03:53:21.760 --> 03:53:28.160]  apologize for them so you know what we're we're we're constructing a new awareness about these
[03:53:28.160 --> 03:53:34.880]  subjects so that's what that banging is all about so the thing is which everyone's in is
[03:53:36.480 --> 03:53:46.480]  so they block copper uptake after the first world war with npk 20 years later 1941 they started
[03:53:46.480 --> 03:53:55.360]  sprinkling iron filings into the wheat flour in in uk canada and the us then what did they do oh well
[03:53:55.360 --> 03:54:01.760]  let's you know the food doesn't taste right let's add some sugar let's let's really begin to add
[03:54:01.760 --> 03:54:14.320]  sugar and then in september of 1955 september 24th 1955 isonore has a heart attack and they seized
[03:54:14.320 --> 03:54:20.960]  upon that he actually had eight heart attacks but the first one was in september of 55 and
[03:54:21.680 --> 03:54:26.960]  ansel keys who's a famous physiologist not a physician but he's a famous physiologist he said
[03:54:26.960 --> 03:54:32.160]  well we need to get fat out of the diet because it's causing heart disease and it's like no it
[03:54:32.160 --> 03:54:38.720]  doesn't but suddenly the whole narrative got hijacked by dr keys and they took they took
[03:54:38.720 --> 03:54:42.480]  fat out of the diet because they had to get rid of cholesterol right well what they were really
[03:54:42.480 --> 03:54:52.880]  going after was retinal vitamin a and what people don't know is that vitamin a is what activates
[03:54:52.880 --> 03:55:00.480]  critical enzymes in our body to load copper into critical pathways to keep us in balance
[03:55:01.360 --> 03:55:09.440]  so let's let's add iron let's take away copper let's add sugar let's take away fat let's
[03:55:09.440 --> 03:55:17.040]  add vitamin d and oh let's not talk about retinol nobody's supposed to be using retinol oh you
[03:55:17.040 --> 03:55:23.280]  know what you can become not just copper toxic you can become vitamin a toxic and those six changes
[03:55:23.920 --> 03:55:30.320]  have shaped humanity now to be so vulnerable and it's i think our ancestors must be rolling
[03:55:30.320 --> 03:55:37.040]  over in their grave saying what happened and the greatest tragedy kate is prior to the first world
[03:55:37.040 --> 03:55:43.760]  war there's something called nutritional immunity our ancestors knew to stay away from excess iron
[03:55:43.760 --> 03:55:47.520]  because it feeds the pathogens and they know that for millennia of millennia
[03:55:48.480 --> 03:55:53.200]  but every first world war everything changed and suddenly we couldn't get enough iron and
[03:55:53.200 --> 03:55:59.200]  we've never been so sick since then so true we're getting bombarded there's iron shavings when they
[03:55:59.200 --> 03:56:05.520]  say fortified iron it's iron shavings in your cereal says dr monzo and so we're getting we're
[03:56:05.520 --> 03:56:09.600]  getting this barrage of iron they tell everyone to take iron they even took me to take our my iron
[03:56:09.600 --> 03:56:14.240]  was low so they told me to take more iron and all it's doing is making us more sick there's no
[03:56:14.240 --> 03:56:20.560]  counter balancing with copper and copper has to be able to tell iron what to do we are so unhealthy
[03:56:20.560 --> 03:56:26.560]  as a people and they counted on it they wanted us to be unhealthy and that's the sad part of all of
[03:56:26.560 --> 03:56:35.440]  this is this this conspiracy a real conspiracy between folks to annihilate it out of our food supply
[03:56:35.440 --> 03:56:40.960]  the glyphosate targets copper out of our food supply we are deserts and we need to understand
[03:56:40.960 --> 03:56:47.200]  that i know we only have about a minute left but please uh you know the book cure cu dash re you
[03:56:47.200 --> 03:56:51.840]  have got to get this book by morley robbins it goes into all of this history it's fantastic
[03:56:51.840 --> 03:56:57.600]  i take fiq copper we need to bump this up we need to get this going in our bodies it can really
[03:56:57.600 --> 03:57:04.960]  help us a lot and uh 30 seconds morley go for it what do you want i think i want people to
[03:57:04.960 --> 03:57:09.600]  realize that when when covid hit i thought it was the end of this movement because this really is a
[03:57:09.600 --> 03:57:15.760]  movement and then i realized over the last year this has been the springboard for because people
[03:57:15.760 --> 03:57:20.720]  are now saying wait a minute there's more to the story and that's what this conversation is all about
[03:57:20.720 --> 03:57:27.440]  and that's what the focus of this uh emphasis on bioavailable copper why it's so important bingo
[03:57:27.440 --> 03:57:32.480]  it's one of the biggest cover-ups in our food supply it's one of the biggest cover-ups in our
[03:57:32.480 --> 03:57:36.640]  health and if a doctor looks at you with a blank stare get rid of the doctor and find one that
[03:57:36.640 --> 03:57:41.680]  understands your body thank you morley robbins really appreciate you the the book is cure uh
