[00:00.000 --> 00:23.240]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:23.240 --> 00:29.320]  world-wide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:29.320 --> 00:31.320]  technocracy cake-over.
[00:31.320 --> 00:35.320]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:35.320 --> 00:43.000]  All right, it's three days and change out from the kickoff of Election Day.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.040]  We're technically about four days out, and this always happens a few times a year when
[00:49.040 --> 00:51.840]  something mega-massive seismic happens.
[00:51.840 --> 00:55.560]  I will wake up at about four o'clock in the morning, and I woke up at four o'clock in
[00:55.560 --> 01:00.640]  the morning, and I was pacing around the house until my kids got up at six a.m.
[01:00.640 --> 01:04.280]  I went and woke them up, and it hit me.
[01:04.280 --> 01:09.840]  I said, it's Doug Hagman and others that came on the show two days ago.
[01:09.840 --> 01:10.840]  This is even before it was in the news.
[01:10.840 --> 01:16.360]  He said his NYPD sources said that we're going to bring out the occult child molestation.
[01:16.360 --> 01:17.360]  You name it.
[01:17.360 --> 01:23.400]  You know that sources we have inside the federal government say that that is what is in the
[01:23.400 --> 01:31.000]  later coup de gras or final blow of WikiLeaks if Hillary didn't step down.
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.280]  And now, the final chapter before that's released has come out, and it quite frankly
[01:36.280 --> 01:42.280]  is that chapter.
[01:42.280 --> 01:47.560]  These people make me so angry that I was almost not able to even get on air right now, and
[01:47.560 --> 01:50.080]  that's not theater when I say that.
[01:50.080 --> 01:56.040]  And I think about the scum, the scum that have supported this.
[01:56.040 --> 02:02.640]  This is hardcore Alistair Crowley, nastiest of the black magic, black magic.
[02:02.640 --> 02:06.840]  And good God, folks, it's tied into Haiti.
[02:06.840 --> 02:11.600]  It's tied into women that have gotten in trouble trying to bring in undocumented Haitians
[02:11.600 --> 02:15.360]  into the United States, children, disappeared children.
[02:15.360 --> 02:16.360]  You name it.
[02:16.360 --> 02:18.840]  It is just the fountain of evil.
[02:18.840 --> 02:22.240]  And it's exactly the sect and group and everything we already knew of.
[02:22.240 --> 02:26.000]  I've explained to you about New York City.
[02:26.000 --> 02:33.640]  And of course, you know what the late great director Stanley Kubrick tried to expose his
[02:33.640 --> 02:34.640]  last film.
[02:34.640 --> 02:37.480]  He refused to cut 24 minutes.
[02:37.480 --> 02:45.440]  He died right after he refused, and he had final edit as he did, final cut on all of
[02:45.440 --> 02:51.120]  his movies, and he died.
[02:51.120 --> 02:57.040]  His protege, of course, his daughter, Vivian Kubrick, has never spoken to the public about
[02:57.040 --> 02:58.040]  the information.
[02:58.040 --> 03:01.800]  She wouldn't tell me a lot of it, but she said it was too dangerous to myself, my family.
[03:01.800 --> 03:04.240]  But she said, you already know.
[03:04.240 --> 03:06.240]  And she told me some things.
[03:06.240 --> 03:10.440]  He was never involved in it, but he was obviously being in Hollywood aware of it.
[03:10.440 --> 03:13.240]  And I'm just going to stop right there.
[03:13.240 --> 03:15.520]  Stop right there.
[03:15.520 --> 03:20.400]  The FBI isn't perfect, but this is so corrupt and so evil, it's got a total mutiny going.
[03:20.400 --> 03:25.200]  You noticed Alana Guardian published hours before WikiLeaks came out, and Paul Watson
[03:25.200 --> 03:28.200]  discovered this, and Drudge top linked it at DrudgeReport.com.
[03:28.200 --> 03:32.200]  Let's put it up on screen.
[03:32.200 --> 03:37.880]  The FBI said, quote, we believe she's the antichrist, and we'll destroy the world.
[03:37.880 --> 03:42.200]  If you actually go further, what they said, that they believe that she'll want to destroy
[03:42.200 --> 03:43.200]  the earth.
[03:43.200 --> 03:44.960]  The FBI doesn't talk like that, folks.
[03:44.960 --> 03:50.160]  I told you a month ago, I said, Obama and Hillary are devil worshipers.
[03:50.160 --> 03:57.880]  The Secret Service has told me, members of the military have told me, that Obama seems
[03:57.880 --> 04:01.240]  really nice, and then all of a sudden you'll be walking down the hall, and it's like, in
[04:01.240 --> 04:03.960]  fact, I didn't tell you half of it, okay?
[04:03.960 --> 04:08.800]  These people are scared, I told you they're having nightmares, they don't want to be there.
[04:08.800 --> 04:12.280]  It's very dark, is the words I was told.
[04:12.280 --> 04:17.960]  And Hillary's even worse, folks, okay?
[04:17.960 --> 04:22.320]  Currently serving up the agency, Clinton is the antichrist personified to a large swath
[04:22.320 --> 04:23.520]  of the FBI personnel.
[04:23.520 --> 04:27.400]  And that's the liberal whistleblower, like, oh my God, most of the FBI hates her.
[04:27.400 --> 04:29.680]  They literally think she's the devil.
[04:29.680 --> 04:32.040]  That's the reason they're leaking, they're pro-Trump.
[04:32.040 --> 04:36.600]  Folks, it's because they know what's in the WikiLeaks, and they know what else is coming
[04:36.600 --> 04:37.600]  out.
[04:37.600 --> 04:40.200]  The NYPD's got even worse stuff.
[04:40.200 --> 04:45.960]  And let me tell you, he didn't just sex with kids, I don't even want to show you the video
[04:45.960 --> 04:49.320]  of what they put out in their private party invites to each other.
[04:49.320 --> 04:57.080]  The Podesta and others says he attends, but it's hardcore, we're going to show it.
[04:57.080 --> 05:01.520]  You'd better get ready, folks, this is who wants to rule you and your family.
[05:01.520 --> 05:07.200]  New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors are working on an alleged underage
[05:07.200 --> 05:13.240]  sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner, and they have turned over a newly found
[05:13.240 --> 05:18.000]  laptop that he shared with his wife, Uma Abedine, to the FBI.
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.120]  True pundit is reporting that there is enough evidence to put Hillary Clinton and her crew
[05:23.120 --> 05:24.720]  away for life.
[05:24.720 --> 05:29.960]  The NYPD seized the computer from Anthony Weiner during a search warrant, and sources
[05:29.960 --> 05:36.280]  now say that emails from the laptop link Hillary Clinton herself to a host of crimes
[05:36.280 --> 05:43.400]  that include money laundering, perjury, obstruction of justice, child exploitation, sex crimes
[05:43.400 --> 05:48.880]  with children, pay to play through the Clinton Foundation, and of course, more classified
[05:48.880 --> 05:50.400]  top secret breaches.
[05:50.400 --> 05:54.160]  Well, it sounds like bad news for Crooked Hillary.
[05:54.160 --> 05:57.440]  And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.

[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:33.960]  She is the coven leader of a branch of Black Magic in the United States.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:43.960]  Beware of early network projections of the winner on Tuesday night, maybe not even so early.
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:54.960]  Any time you see that projections from the networks, know that you're talking about crimes, fraud, fakery, all of that.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:06.960]  I've written about it extensively. Remember terms like Associated Press, NEP, National Election Pool, Edison Research, Metofsky.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:14.960]  These are all elements that cook up a winner that the networks then project.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.960]  Well, it's all over, folks. The winner is Hillary. That's it. Okay, we're done.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:33.960]  We're waiting for concession speech. We're waiting for victory speech. But it's all over because, and you have to remember this, the media considered the election a media event, which they own.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:39.960]  They own the debates. They own the primaries. They own the interviews. They own the election.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:43.960]  And WikiLeaks proves it's all rigged. So Trump's right to be saying that.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:49.960]  I would say he's going to win by a landslide going over all the evidence. So how do they counterman something like that?
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:58.960]  Well, you had Bev on, finally, Bev Harris. I mean, she laid out how the GEM system works and how they can rig it electronically and invisibly.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:04.960]  But you could see something fairly close and then she pulls away.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:18.960]  Okay, exit polls are showing now and this and that and so forth. We can now call Michigan for Hillary, et cetera, et cetera. And they just keep building this up to the point where they then declare a winner to make it look credible.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:28.960]  He put up a good fight. Yes, indeed. It wasn't, you know, a sweep that we thought it was going to be for Hillary. They bring in the pundits. Everybody starts talking.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:34.960]  It's a done deal game over. That's it. That's what they want to convince you of.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:50.960]  And when I wrote about the extensive vote fraud involved in Prop 37 in California in 2013, a GMO labeling ballot initiative, what I found was there were, you know, two, three million votes that were uncounted in California
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:28:03.960]  when they projected that Prop 37 had lost. They just perpetrate this fraud time after time after time. Beware of the projections from the networks of the winners.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:15.960]  Look between the lines. Look at what they're doing and how they're shaping this as a story. The media are telling a story. They believe they own the election because it's basically a media event.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:22.960]  And they are all bought and sold and corrupted and so forth. So, you know, the story that they're going to tell.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:29.960]  Well, John, I know you've already agreed to do an hour during the 52-hour broadcast. If you'd like to host twice as well, I really appreciate you.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:36.960]  How do folks find out more about your amazing work? I know it's no more fakenews.com. You also have some big blogs. You're also...
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.960]  Just come to nomorefakenews.com. Everything is there. Everything is there.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:48.960]  Do you agree with me in closing, though, that the good news is this is the animating contest and the explosion of awakening that's happened is scaring the establishment.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.960]  It's like light is starting to come back into the world.
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:29:00.960]  Absolutely. No question about it. This movement you've got to remember is bigger than this election. It's bigger than Trump. It's bigger than any one person.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:12.960]  It's everybody waking up to the fact that we have been fooled, tricked, completely tricked, which is the strategy of the corrupt, is to trick the innocent.
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:13.960]  They bring darkness not light.
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:17.960]  And we're taking it back. That's it. That's the story and it keeps on going.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:22.960]  What is your gut prediction or feeling? I mean, I think Trump's going to win. It's going to be so big they're going to have trouble.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:28.960]  I think they're going to try to stop him and I think it's going to come out the day of the election that, well, you know what goes with devil worship.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:32.960]  So they want to go there. They're going to elect this and then it's going to be released.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:37.960]  Yeah. I don't know, Alex. I'm 50-50 on this. They're going to try to rig it every way they can.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:42.960]  Well, I mean, what Assange said, though, is if she gets elected, that's fine, because what comes out will destroy her.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:48.960]  So I almost want to see the Democrats have it their way. The problem is, though, she may try to nuclear war to cover it up.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.960]  We'll talk to you again next week. God bless you.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:30:00.960]  Thank you, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:29.960]  The same people are funding radical Islamic terror. If you wish to believe that Hillary was too stupid to realize this, you'd be wrong.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:38.960]  There's an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, so not so long after she was Secretary of State, to her campaign manager, John Podesta.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:48.960]  It states that ISIL, ISIS, is funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:54.960]  So essentially, you could make the case that ISIS and Hillary Clinton take orders from the same people.
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:31:19.960]  You're with her. This is Owen Troyer for Infowars.com.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:39.960]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:44.960]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:50.960]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:32:00.960]  You'll find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfowarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:03.960]  You ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:07.960]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:13.960]  Something's wrong and we all know it. I'm Charity Daniels and I'm here to tell you about it.
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:18.960]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:24.960]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:30.960]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:33.960]  Revelation dawned of global government.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:37.960]  We're the solution. Americans ain't nothing more to it than that.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:49.960]  Starring Alex Jones, Charity Daniels and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:33:11.960]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:26.960]  The Alex Jones Show
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:50.960]  The Alex Jones Show
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:55.960]  We're now just three and a half days out. It's Friday. I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:01.960]  I'm intending to organize the crew to come in and do a limited two, three hour broadcast that will be internet only.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:06.960]  The stations are welcome to pick it up and put it up on the satellite sometime tomorrow evening.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:11.960]  Too much is breaking. Too much is happening right now.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:23.960]  The New York Times three days ago did a review of the high priestess and the Rwandaer guest of the cult that the head of the Democratic Party,
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:30.960]  or the head of Hillary's campaign, Podesta, attends where on the menu they have a blood semen, mother's milk,
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:36.960]  and when they conduct ceremonies and then sacrifice children and effigy, at least that's what it appears.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:41.960]  We have the videos. I was told by our NYPD source and told you this two days ago that it was going to come out,
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:45.960]  that it was basically a big blackmail operation. This is in the new WikiLeaks.
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:49.960]  We're not saying that actual child sacrifice is happening here, but this is real Satanism.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:54.960]  She's even done a Reddit to ask me anything, but we can pop in and tell you about the high priestess,
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:58.960]  where she said, oh, if it's public, it's not a ritual, but if it's private, it is.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:02.960]  And that's obviously what I told you last hour before I was aware of that. That's how they do it.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:07.960]  They tell this cult stuff to the public, but this is what Asan just says is coming out,
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.960]  and reportedly stuff even wilder than this is coming out.
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.960]  So Buckley, before we go to William Benning with Big Mom Shells on WikiLeaks and more,
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.960]  he's been vindicated saying that this was a U.S. intelligence leak that's not coming out everywhere,
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:25.960]  but a real fast Buckley getting into that Reddit point from an ask me anything with this lady and tell us about her.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:31.960]  Exactly. So basically there's lots of different celebrities that are, you know, talk about the Illuminati like Jay-Z,
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:36.960]  and some of the other celebrities that sort of hint at it with the imagery inside of their videos, etc.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:42.960]  And the question is, is this always just some sort of playful take on spiritualism
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:47.960]  and just kind of a jokie kind of thing that's a little bit scary and spooky like Halloween, or is it real?
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.960]  And so when pressed by the reality of it, they're always going to fall back on,
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:57.960]  okay, no, it's art, we're just expressing ourselves in a certain way that it's, you know, the darkness in our souls,
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:03.960]  the yin and the yang, the shadow, etc. But however, here is a really descriptive point.
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:10.960]  Mrs. Abramovich did a Reddit ask me anything, and in that AMA, somebody said,
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:15.960]  Marina, what do you see the occult having within contemporary art?
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:20.960]  Can magic be made not simply appropriated slash performed? And this was her answer.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:24.960]  Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing.
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.960]  If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is art.
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:37.960]  If you are doing it in a different context in spiritual circles or private houses or on TV shows, it is not art.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:44.960]  The intention, the context for what is made and where it is made defines what is art or what is not.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:52.960]  So essentially, what she's doing right here is she is professing the fact that she is literally buying into this demonology
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:59.960]  and this idea of using power, occultic power to subjugate people and torture people for their own means
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:02.960]  and for their own ascension into power over people.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:07.960]  That's right, and Buckley himself is an expert on this, and we ought to give him an interview about it some day.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:11.960]  Thank you so much, Buckley. Now, that's one of our top researchers, Buckley Hammond,
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.960]  been here at InfoWars off and on for 20 years. Now, William Benny joins us.
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:20.960]  Again, we don't normally cover topics like this. I'm not, I'm here as a sociologist and anthropologist
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:25.960]  looking at how they control political circles. Just like a local gang will have you go rob a liquor store
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:29.960]  and shoot the clerk, become a maid member, so they have dirt on you.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:35.960]  But we've known from WikiLeaks and we've known from other sources, law enforcement, that really bad stuff with kids is coming out,
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:41.960]  the occult, you name it. This has now been released. This is, this is a satanic ritual, Alistair Crowley,
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:45.960]  secret rituals going on with the head of her campaign. I have Bill Clinton in his own book.
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:50.960]  We're going to go over this if William Benny leaves us. Here's the Washington Post and CNN.
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:54.960]  Book says Hillary talked to the dead. It goes on to say that Bill Clinton practices voodoo.
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:59.960]  In his own words, he says it's beautiful and wonderful to have evil and good spirits enter him.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:02.960]  This is the new article on InfoWars.com. Flashback.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:08.960]  Occultic Hillary summons the dead, refuses to speak to Christ. This is a new article by Kit Daniels.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:16.960]  You cannot make this up. Top Story on Drudge. The FBI, quote, says they believe she's pure evil, quote, the antichrist.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:21.960]  This isn't, this is the Guardian. Now, William Benny's a scientist, a mathematician, top code breaker living,
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:26.960]  former technical director of the NSA. We don't cover stuff like this. He doesn't cover stuff like this,
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:32.960]  but we're covering the contents of what's in the 650,000 emails that were clearly to frame people.
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:38.960]  That's coming out. I have to tell you, our sources of the government have been so on target.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.960]  Doug Hagman's coming on a little bit later with the Northeast Intelligence Network.
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:48.960]  He has his NYPD sources. He said a lot of this on air. He didn't want to say the Satanism on air.
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:54.960]  I talked to him off air because it was so shocking, but he said crimes against children, stuff just unspeakable.
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:59.960]  The police, look, our government's not perfect, but imagine the stuff Hillary's done is so bad.
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:04.960]  They admit there's a total mutiny in the FBI. So William Benny hinted at this six months ago.
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:09.960]  He's been clearer the last few months. He's been SWAT team rated before for just talking to Congress,
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.960]  but we now have the former British ambassador coming out two days ago saying it's the U.S. government leaking it.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:17.960]  We have members of Congress saying that. Benny was the first to say it.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:25.960]  Assange has come out in an interview, conducted by the University of Dartmouth, and said the Russians have nothing to do with it.
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:33.960]  So they're trying to deflect away from what's happening in the WikiLeaks and in other documents saying it's the Russians.
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:41.960]  Clearly it's not. William Benny helped bring down the Soviet Union and was equivalent of a multi-star general heading up the NSA.
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:45.960]  He's not a Russian agent. I'm not a Russian agent. We're just patriots telling the truth.
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:52.960]  So Mr. Benny, it's bizarre to get into all this, but can you speak to, before we get into what other WikiLeaks may be coming out,
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:58.960]  how you knew early on or sensed, or I guess had sources that this was U.S. intelligence?
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:06.960]  But separately, I mean, what's already come out is so damning, and Assange says what's coming out next is even worse.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:08.960]  What do you want to tackle first, sir?
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:18.960]  Well, it's good to be with you again, Alex, but I would say the thing that tipped me off was the fact that the intelligence community
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:23.960]  was not coming out and saying exactly who did it because they've got control of the entire network.
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:28.960]  Now, when you do that, anything passing across the network, you know where it comes from and where it goes to.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.960]  So there's no excuse for them not knowing.
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:35.960]  So that gave me the clue that right away it was not somebody passing things across the net or hacking in.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:43.960]  It was somebody inside who had the data and took it out and then passed it on to WikiLeaks.
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:46.960]  That was the basic clue to me.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:53.960]  They've got to be panicking because the word is New Leaks are coming out every day as the government really, I guess, en masse.
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.960]  In the beginning of Patriot, it's a pretty scarce man.
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:00.960]  But in time, when this cause succeeds, the timid joined him because then it cost us to be a patriot.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.960]  It was really hard to be a William Benny or a Mr. Drake or others.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:09.960]  Now, as more go forward as we realize how bad the Clintons are, it seems to be a tsunami's coming.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.960]  What's your view on that?
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:16.960]  You know, I think Thomas Jefferson said it pretty well.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.960]  He said, you know, we're heading to collapse.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:27.960]  The only two things that have to happen as a government, the only two things that have to happen is centralized control and corruption.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:38.960]  And we've passed both those tests, you know, with the collection of data on everybody that centralized power and control and with all the corruption we're seeing now.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:44.960]  And the WikiLeaks is one of the only sources we get that is exposing all of this corruption.
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:53.960]  But you're getting the sense now that some of the people internally, I know a lot of people in the intelligence agencies and the police are really good people.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:55.960]  And they can't, this is thickening them.
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.960]  And so they're starting to revolt internally too.
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:11.960]  So, you know, I think all of that is kind of summing up that we are now starting a revolt against this process of centralized control and corruption.
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:20.960]  I know you can't talk about classified matters, but it's well known that using the occult is a way to rope people into crimes so they can be blackmailed.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:35.960]  Looking at this latest stuff coming out with this top lady promoted by the New York Times, this love by the Democrats and all these billionaires, hanging out with the top Democratic party people in Alistair Crowley rituals.
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:41.960]  That's how they're described by them, bathtubs of blood, simulated human sacrifice.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:45.960]  I don't want to mention the things on air that are going on here, but there's videos of it.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:58.960]  And then reportedly, what's going to come out to even worse, just as an expert on criminal activity, I would say, I mean, formally running the NSA, what do you make of this?
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.960]  Well, it's pretty consistent with the people.
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:08.960]  I mean, the KGB used to do this all the time, try to entice people into doing things that they would be embarrassed about or would not want exposed.
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:13.960]  And then they'd use that against them as blackmail to convert them into an agent for them.
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:18.960]  I mean, this is pretty standard. I mean, this is what Bush Cheney, Hayden and Tenet did with some of the members of Congress.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:26.960]  They roped them in and then they were committed and they did the same thing with the FISA court senior judge in early 2002.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.960]  So it's very similar. It's the same process.
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:36.960]  I mean, this has gone on since humans have tried to organize into civilization.
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:41.960]  So it's a system of corruption. The average person doesn't understand corruption isn't just people become corrupt.
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:45.960]  The corruptors get you involved in the corruption to expand it.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.960]  Yep, that's right. They'll try to get and rope you in any way they can.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:53.960]  Wow. Well, they were unable to rope you in and you stopped them.
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:59.960]  And it's good to know and it's been somewhat declassified that until you left and others left, they were not spying on the general public.
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.960]  They were doing it legally and lawfully, targeting governments, which is your job.
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.960]  Now it's completely wide open.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:11.960]  But we're not safe, though. ISIS, they tell us, could strike the election and they've brought in all these unvetted refugees.
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.960]  It's just crazy.
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:15.960]  Well, I mean, they're setting us up again, aren't they?
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:19.960]  I mean, they're bringing in people who will attack us eventually, some of them anyway.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:24.960]  And so all that does is perpetuate the fear of armed ring on terrorist attacks.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:34.960]  That means they continue to get more money and get to do what they want to do and keep everybody else in the dark and just keep them uninformed and manipulable.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:40.960]  You know, now they're all, they all can be manipulated any way the central power wants. That's what that power gives them.
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:44.960]  Wow. I've been asking the question here. You're the expert.
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:53.960]  What is it like for you to sit back when you got persecuted and others did for just testifying secretly to Congress about illegal spying that you were trying to expose?
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:45:11.960]  Folks being sent to jail, you name it, you've been vindicated. But I guess that's bittersweet because now the corruption's admitted, but nothing's being done about it. And WikiLeaks is drip, drip of just more and more bonafide crime and lying to Congress and covering up crimes and shelling out our secrets.
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:20.960]  And the media sits there and plays dumb and tries to ignore the real meat and potatoes, but there's no way Hillary long term can get away with all this.
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:38.960]  No, I mean, even if she gets elected, this is still going to go on. I mean, WikiLeaks, I'm sure is not going to end and stop. And certainly, it seems to me anyway that there are so many, well, unhappy is probably not a strong enough word, but sick people,
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:55.960]  people have gotten sick for what's been going on corruption wise in our government. For example, in the Department of Justice, when they attempted to prosecute us, they fabricated evidence and they put it in an indictment and we were going to be indicted according to our lawyer.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:46:11.960]  But since I caught them and had evidence of malicious prosecution, why they dropped it and ran, but the point is they fabricated the evidence and someone in the DOJ felt so bad about it, they sent us a copy of their draft indictment.
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:20.960]  So we've got all that as evidence of what they're doing. I mean, it's no longer, as I keep saying now, it's no longer a Department of Justice, it's the Department of Just Us.
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:35.960]  I'm kind of seeing, and I'm talking about myself, but I'm in the middle of the story, so I have to, as like a bellwether of being this radical, but as everything we've talked about and our guests have talked about, because our guests are the big secret of the show, that's really what Info Wars is, not so much Alex Jones.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:46.960]  And as everything we've talked about comes out exactly as we said, our credibility is just exploding right now. There's a big meme on the Internet that, wow, Alex Jones was right, but I just want to be clear.
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:47:00.960]  I wasn't right, you were right, Drudge was right, you know, Colonel Shaffer was right, Sy Hirsch was right. I mean, I have all these major heavy hitters that are the top journalists, the top experts on, and they're all basically saying the same thing.
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:12.960]  So the American people keep saying, give us a better government, our government's what's bad, but really most people in the government have gone public and said no, and the American people are too busy watching football games.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:27.960]  So, you know, there's always this demonize the government and sure it's too big, it's out of control, but isn't it the people now, it's their turn to do something because we've seen incredible heroism by people out there doing the right thing to get us the truth.
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:44.960]  Yeah, and first of all, I'd like to thank you, Alex, because you're one of the very few people in media who will carry these kinds of conversations. I mean, the mainstream media will not touch anything national security related, and they will, of course,
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:48:06.960]  they'll cover up and they won't touch anything that's detrimental to the Democrats, or then they'll attack the Republicans. So that's their mantra, that's their whole operational process. But fortunately, we have you and some others in the media and radio and TV who will air this kind of information.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:18.960]  And also Oliver Stone did a great job. You were the top technical advisor. Film is incredible. Snowden, and we're all in this together. Clearly, sir, they're coming after the Internet. We've heard a lot about Internet kill switches.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:32.960]  I know you can't get into it, but if anybody knows about it to be you, they admit, since you left, Obama has put these control systems in to kind of force feed down websites, messages they want and kind of commandeer the web more than killing the web.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:36.960]  A, can you kill the web and B, can you speak to that?
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:49:02.960]  Yeah, it's possible to shut off switches and things like that and servers that manage the web operations. They certainly can do that because they've got implants in, you know, the last slide in Snowden's materials said they had 50,000 implants in the worldwide network. Now, that means software and hardware and implanted combinations of things like that implanted in the switches and servers that run the network worldwide.
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:15.960]  So, you know, if they have a little instruction in there that says close down the switch or close down the server, they could send it out in a broadcast way and shut down the whole network.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:34.960]  And that's why I think that's the strongest revelation of Snowden in the film. You learn they put this into the entire grid. What have AI malfunctioned or what have what have foreign state or hackers or an insane person got in control of those switches? I mean, it sounds like they've built in something that is just incredibly dangerous.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:54.960]  Yes, that's another short sighted thing they did. It's a matter of, you know, they, again, I keep saying they have no monopoly on smart people. You know, there's a lot of people around the world can figure out these things or detect weaknesses or also find, you know, problems in the software that they've implanted and manipulate that software.
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:07.960]  That's not unquestionable. I mean, you know, it's a process of having smart people look at software and figure out how to do it. And once they do, the whole network is vulnerable.
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:12.960]  Boy, it's almost like the devil runs things or something. I tell you, this is really bad.
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:29.960]  Unfortunately, the technology makes all this possible too. And they haven't really figured out a smart way of monitoring everything and stopping it. You know, we, you know, Dr. John Taggart and I back in 1991 or 92, we had proposed a way that would be able to stop this kind of stuff.
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:48.960]  And that was to, we proposed to NSA internally that we would, we would set up a set of software and implanted in all the network logs worldwide for the NSA network and be able to monitor everybody on the network, what they did as they did it and then be able to stop them after doing something wrong or, you know,
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.960]  prevent things from happening. So it was a matter of knowing everything that was happening.
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:51:00.960]  Stay there. Break this down. We've got a break, sir. Come back and explain this to us. We'll be right back. But the problem is it works. They didn't want that. They want problems.
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:11.960]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:28.960]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel. The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable. For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to Minutemanstove.com.

[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:13.960]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:20.960]  The United States is now run by the TPP, all these big multinational agreements. We really are a captured country.
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:37.960]  And the establishment hopes that it's so over the top what they've done, the power grab is so big, the global government they're building is so out of control that they just ignore the fact that it's being constructed until it's too late and then you just roll over the opposition because no real opposition ever formed.
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:45.960]  And last time William Mitty was on, I said what's their main goal? He said global corporate government. That's why this is international. That's why it scoops up all the data.
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:52.960]  And he was getting into a system they were developing that was constitutional that was specifically targeting but they didn't want it. Please continue.
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:56.960]  Where did I leave off? Alex, help me here.
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:00.960]  You were just getting into how you guys had developed a system that did violate people's rights.
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:18.960]  I'm right with you now. This was in 1991 or 92. What we had proposed internally in NSA was we would develop all the software to do this and be able to monitor all the programs, all the productivity of each and every program in the world and what people on their worldwide network were doing
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:28.960]  and be able to do calculations like return on investment and things like that so we could monitor the success or failure of any of the programs and things like that.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:34.960]  We had two groups of oppositions internally in NSA. The first group were the analysts.
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:46.960]  They said you mean you're going to monitor everything I'm doing on the network and we said yes and said you'll be able to say I'm not smart here or there and I need training here or there and we said yes and we thought that would be a good thing to do.
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:52.960]  And they said I don't want you monitoring me. You mind your business. Do your job. I'll do mine.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:56:09.960]  And the second group were the managers of NSA and they said you mean to tell me that you'll have knowledge of all the return on investment of every program we're running and they'll know the status and success or failure of every program and its development as it progresses.
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:15.960]  We said yes and they also know how we're spending money and moving it around internally in NSA.
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:27.960]  We said yes and they also see all the contractors and how they manipulate or use contractors to help develop the proposals and all of that.
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:35.960]  Contractors in general write the proposals for NSA to issue contracts to them. It's like an incestuous relationship.
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:47.960]  So the big enchilada here is the NSA can spy on everybody but themselves and it's not spying when you're the top spy agency to make sure you've not been penetrated to make sure the networks are working and to watch everybody.
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:55.960]  I would expect that the NSA I better be spied on but instead the watchers are the only group that doesn't get watched. That sounds insane.
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:03.960]  Yeah well the reason they did that is because they didn't want Congress and they said this. They didn't want Congress to know all this stuff. I mean because after all they might cancel our programs you know.
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:08.960]  And so now they basically have taken over and they have just wow that's incredible.
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:17.960]  Our proposal lasted just a month and a half. We had barely a chance to express the proposal and it was killed.
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:22.960]  But that's why Snowden could take all the material that he did and they didn't even know anything.
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:27.960]  Well you've made that point. This makes it so easy to penetrate because they've done this.
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:34.960]  We've only got a minute left. I want to thank you for your time. I know a film is coming out very very soon. A goodamerican.org.
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:42.960]  This is a documentary that you're in. You're not just Hollywood film. I want to have you back up for that. In the last minute any other points you'd like to make sir?
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:52.960]  No except that Thomas Jefferson had it right. I mean he was a true visionary. He just understood how people operated I guess was the key.
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:58.960]  He did. He wrote a Declaration of Independence. He basically founded the country. People think it's George Washington. It was Thomas Jefferson.
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:05.960]  He basically said you know humans do this. We're now once reformed as a government we're heading toward collapse.
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:15.960]  And the only two things that have to happen are centralized power which they now have and corruption which we are clearly saying in these emails from WikiLeaks.
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:23.960]  But the good news is balance is coming into things. Nature abhors the vacuum and the truth is coming out. So the corrupt establishment is in full panic mode.
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:31.960]  And good folks in government are helping and leaking the info and the new media is pushing it. So wow what a time to be alive. Thank you so much William Benny. Have a great weekend.
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:32.960]  Thank you.
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:40.960]  Well that is a true patriot right there at goodamerican.org. We'll be back. Don't forget infowarstore.com. We need your support folks.

[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:24.960]  By the way, we are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:36.960]  I want to be very specific on this. And the inquirer said they'll just go wherever the truth is. If Russia hacks some of this stuff, that's fine because justice be done may the heavens fall.
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:43.960]  That's what foreign governments do. Hillary committing all these crimes, that's the issue. But we're not Russian agents if we cover it.
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:54.960]  But if you listen to what Wikileaks said, we didn't get this from the Russians. And most of this stuff he knows coming from US intelligence agencies.
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:01:07.960]  But radar online, that's the National Inquirer, says new security breach, proof Russia hacked Hillary and Ooma's emails given to US enemies.
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:17.960]  So the issue is the FBI has come out and said, we don't believe Trump is working for the Russians. We don't believe that this latest DNC stuff is the Russians.
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:27.960]  But five different agencies, five different countries have gotten into this. So that's basically what that's saying and what that's getting into.
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:34.960]  But it just all becomes a larger distraction from the fact that we have them in the earlier emails the last month.
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:42.960]  Three different data dumps at least that I've seen where they're saying, we got to cover this up. Oh, this is so illegal. You know, we've been caught. Let's cover it up.
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:52.960]  Let's let's clean it up right now. That is massive. That's lying to Congress, the FBI, the American people, Obama's hooked into it.
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:02:02.960]  And Fox News, you name it, are reporting that indictments of Hillary are down the road. That's what I was told last Friday.
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:13.960]  Everybody says, oh, no, this whole new data dump is a smokescreen for what's already WikiLeaks. And I mean, I agree what's already WikiLeaks hasn't been covered by mainstream media. It is absolute open and shut.
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:20.960]  Something must be done about it. But who knows what's in this new stuff?
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:33.960]  But look at the new WikiLeaks. It's Podesta going to satanic rituals to drink blood, semen, urine, breast milk, grinding up placentas.
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:44.960]  I haven't even shown the stuff yet. I've seen it twice is enough, but we're going to do viewer discretion is advised a little bit later.
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:52.960]  Plus YouTube and Facebook will use all the blood, all the deaths, great if it's them pushing it. But if you show something, say it's bad, then they'll then they'll shut it down.
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:56.960]  But it's it's it's really nasty stuff.
[02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:08.960]  And again, it's baby training what you do in the outer public ritual because this is him in a secret ritual, which she says in her own public state public statements is real when she does it in private.
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:23.960]  But then the public is just a recruiting arm. And that's all basically admitted as well. And these people are just so pathetic, trying to be shocking, trying to be powerful, just running around desperately looking for God, desperately looking for power.
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:35.960]  And they just just wreak weakness. I mean, you could not pay me $80 trillion to be around these people to be with them to drink blood with it.
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:45.960]  And it's not that I couldn't drink blood. I've done the old hunter ritual, you know, when you're eight and shoot your first deer and drink blood hot. That's ancient ritual. That's just about being a hunter.
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:59.960]  But call me the hunter. That's my name. Pretty young thing like you. That's my only game. But when you get down to the brass tacks with these people, it's about betrayal. It's about nastiness.
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:12.960]  It's about doing horrible things. And then you see what they do in the real world. It's all about that. And Hillary is just totally mixed up, totally freaked out, crazy woman who was penned pals with Saul Olinsky, who dedicated himself to Lucifer.
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:23.960]  And then she hung out with him and he was her mentor. I mean, and Bill Clinton, it just reminded me today, it hit me like a ton of bricks, how much stuff they admit they're involved in with the occult.
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:32.960]  I mean, Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton in his own book about his early years, I showed earlier said he loves Voodoo.
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:43.960]  So this is going super viral because I told you they're into the occult. I said it a month ago and Hillary and Obama took the bait and attacked me.
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:56.960]  And I was, I don't know how I know this stuff. I just felt like I need to do this. I know they're involved in the occult. Let me bring what people are saying about them. They'll attack. And then I just had a feeling WikiLeaks was going to bring this up because I know they spend all their time doing these rituals.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:00.960]  I mean, you know, it's after dark folks, they're getting down on the knees to the devil.
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:03.960]  The thanks Hillary Clinton are erecting a demon.
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:07.960]  She's worked like a demon, as you know, it's Secretary of State.
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:18.960]  So Alex Jones is not the only one that thinks Hillary Clinton is a demon. And now we have Marina Abramovich emailing John and Tony Podesta talking about spirit dinners.
[02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:25.960]  Who is Marina Abramovich? A performance artist who focuses on pain, blood and physical limits of the body.
[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:38.960]  Some of her performances have included communist stars, near death experiences, playing with skeletons, cutting her neck and sex. What is a spirit dinner? A ritual dinner where blood, semen and breast milk are painted on the wall.
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:42.960]  These are the type of things intellectuals like Lady Gaga are interested in.
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:45.960]  Marina Abramovich in New York.
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:49.960]  I was just speaking about her today. I am obsessed with this woman.
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:59.960]  I have emails coming out of the Clinton camp now talking about Satanic occult dinners. You're with her. This is Owen Schreuer from infowars.com.
[02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:27.960]  It's a company I trust. They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown.
[02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:35.960]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks. China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move.
[02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:41.960]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.
[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:53.960]  If you own Delay, call 844-541-ALEXNOW and get a rugged double locked bank bag to securely store your coins, absolutely free. These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:59.960]  I personally own these survival packs and you should too. Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALEXNOW.
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:09.960]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war. A 360 win.
[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:15.960]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarstore.com.
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:23.960]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:28.960]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:42.960]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month. Just go to infowarstore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:59.960]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com, this is a sure win. 10% off on auto ship. Win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50. And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:24.960]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:41.960]  Now, one of the things that I have learned about Hillary Clinton is that one of her heroes, her mentors was Saul Alinsky.
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:58.960]  And her senior thesis was about Saul Alinsky. This was someone that she greatly admired and that affected all of her philosophies subsequently. Now, interestingly enough, let me tell you something about Saul Alinsky.
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:18.960]  He wrote a book called Rules for Radicals. On the dedication page, it acknowledges Lucifer, the original radical who gained his own kingdom. Now, think about that. This is a nation where our founding document, the Declaration of Independence, talks about certain
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:35.960]  inalienable rights that come from our creator. So are we willing to elect someone as president who has as their role model somebody who acknowledges Lucifer? Think about that.
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:58.960]  That's Ben Carson at the RNC in Cleveland back in July. I was there during the speech. It was powerful. They made fun of him. Well, I happen to have the excerpt of Bill Clinton's book that he wrote about his early life titled My Life the Early Years, where he talks about the beauty of voodoo and having evil and good spirits enter him and how he likes it.
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:16.960]  That's on page 312, 313. Why is that important? Because it goes to the MO. Would you have somebody that would say, into drinking blood with a bunch of naked women and stuff and effigies of dead kids? Would you want them babysitting your kids? The answer is absolutely not.
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:33.960]  This is who's going to run our country. And it's now out. Spirit cooking. Clinton campaign chairman invited to bizarre satanic performance. And that's an Alistair Crowley deal of drinking ground up baby parts and stuff.
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:46.960]  But then it's just mother's milk, urine, blood, and semen. And Podesta is being enticed about, oh, another great meeting, a private meeting, a party. And it's done. You do this and then you have sex.
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:57.960]  So it's Alistair Crowley's sex ritual. This is all about blackmailing folks. This is all about controlling people. This is the hottest, coolest stuff right now in New York.
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:10.960]  That's top story on DrudgeReport.com. We put that on screen. And then under it is an article from the one in Guardian, FBI agency Antichrist.
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:30.960]  And then Assange says, Clinton, ISIS funded by the same salary and money, terror threat warning Monday. And what's that telling you? Who's behind ISIS? 944,609,000 not in labor force.
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:44.960]  Now, so this is all happening. Coming up at the bottom of the hour, we have Doug Hagman popping in on the show who two days ago talked about his NYPD source and saying it's child abuse.
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:55.960]  It's the occult. It's money laundering. It's a blackmail operation on Wiener's computer. And he wouldn't say it all on air. I talked to him off air and he was getting into all the occult stuff.
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:00.960]  You can see him on air. He's like, ah, there's some other stuff I'm not going to get into. It's just too much. Because who wants to say this? It just sounds insane.
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:11.960]  Well, these people are insane. So reportedly, this is what the NYPD is looking into. And then you've got this lady who the New York Times is pushing.
[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:22.960]  Marina Abranovich, if you pronounce her name wrong, I don't know. Walk through walls, a memoir. And then it just goes through her wonderful book that she's put out.
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:33.960]  And then you actually Google this woman. It's all bathomet, blood, death, you know, epigenes of babies being sacrificed, people worshiping her, a bunch of sex rituals.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:44.960]  Just thank God I'm not these people. And this is the ether in which Hillary Clinton swims. This is the stuff that they're into. And I haven't shown the video.
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:53.960]  Now, we're going to go to Biggs in a moment. I tell folks there's something really huge running and tell us. There was some news that Breitbart's breaking on the latest on Wiener.
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:13:03.960]  We'll get it up on infowars.com, obviously. So I'll have him pop in in a moment. But first, while I find out exactly, well, just go ahead, Biggs.
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:14.960]  So there's a brand new article by Breitbart, Blackwater founder and retired Navy Seal Eric Prince told Breitbart News Daily that according to one of his well-placed sources within the New York Police Department,
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:26.960]  the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in the Anthony Wiener investigation but received huge pushback from the Justice Department.
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:37.960]  Now, notice, notice, notice, I said yesterday and the day before, I said the word is, and when I had Colonel Shaffer on and others, I said, the word is you're going to see a press conference.
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:50.960]  The word is you're going to see a press conference. And that's exactly what I was told by FBI and or NYPD connections that they're looking at doing a press conference if the truth doesn't come out and just releasing it so nobody can stop them.
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:14:03.960]  Well, basically they're saying Prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had announced he was reopening the investigation in the Clinton's email server last week.
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:14.960]  Because of Wiener-8 and the sexing scandal, the NYPD started investigating through a subpoena, through a warrant, they researched his laptop and sure enough found those 650,000 emails.
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:25.960]  They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to the sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:42.960]  Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times. Now, the New York Police Department took a copy of all this information, kept it for themselves and then gave the FBI another copy as well just in case they decided not to go.
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:59.960]  That's what I've been told. That's why Hillary is so scared. I've been saying this for two weeks, folks, just to prove we have these real sources that it deals with Epstein kids, blackmail networks, you name it, getting all these rich people involved to control and have this network and that they're looking to have a press conference.
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:00.960]  This is gigantic.
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:07.960]  The amount of garbage they found in these emails of criminal activity by Hillary, by our media circle, and even by other Democratic...
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:16.960]  By the way, Eric Prince is super secretive and did get a raw deal. In fact, I even bought into some of it early on, but what you heard was always other groups being blamed on black water.
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:31.960]  But the point is, he is a patriot overall. That's why they're coming after him. The fact that he surfaced all of a sudden shows up with a desperate situation. This is very credible to have him saying he has sources connecting this to the island because that's exactly what our sources are telling us.
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:42.960]  So what he says is the NYPD gave it to the FBI and they said, hey, we're going to go public with this if you do not reopen the investigation and you don't do the right thing with timely indictments.
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:53.960]  The NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in the investigation and they've gotten huge pushback to the point of coercion from the Justice Department.
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:16:11.960]  With the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago, that's the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters.
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:12.960]  That is intense.
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:24.960]  Well, how many times I'm just pointing this out to listeners. Did I say that the answer to this is a press conference? And that's what folks are looking at in New York and other areas. If the right thing isn't done, including the FBI. I mean, in fact, who, who, who did I have on yesterday?
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:36.960]  Because I had a bunch of guests and I continue to bring that up to each and every one of them because I want to find the clip and play that. That's big news. Bigs will cover it more in a moment. Thank you so much. What do you make of all this occultism coming out?
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:53.960]  I've actually been going back and looking at this Mariana Brovich her videos. There's videos where she carves pentagrams into her stomach with a razor blade that she lays on the table convulsing screaming to the top of her lungs.
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:17:10.960]  Then she does what she calls performance art, where she places a bullet in a gun, razor blades and all this stuff lays it on the table and tells people that they can come up, control her life. They can punch her, they can beat her, they can cut her, they can kiss her, they can touch her, fondle her, or they can just kill her.
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:15.960]  And she sits there and promotes this weird satanic ritualistic stuff.
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:30.960]  Well, she's trying to get them into the spirit of killing an innocent to seduce them into that spirit. High level Satanism, and this is again at the enticement level, the cat rolling its tongue out to get the mouse to come and think it's a hotel entrance and not a cat's mouth.
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:44.960]  This is really, really, really, really bad stuff. And that's what I'm saying this morning and looking at all this, hundreds of videos, thousands of photos, all of them admitting it, knowing it's true, knowing what the FBI has told us and the Secret Service.
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:53.960]  And it's just like, it's all true. And people are saying, we don't want you to be right, Alex, because that's not like the maximum. I'm not bringing myself into it. It's true. They're like, oh my God, Alex Jones is right. How do you know it?
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:18:02.960]  Because they admit it. And I don't want to be right. It's crazy. I never get tired of cheese enchiladas.
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:11.960]  I never get tired of cheese enchiladas. I never get tired of steak. I never get tired of chillerianios. I never get tired of beer. I never get tired of water skiing. I never get tired of camping.
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:26.960]  I never get tired of hanging out with my family. Like, why do these people get into all this evil, Joe? As you get older, we hang out. Don't we just get back to more basic stuff? I mean, I don't understand where this crap comes from.
[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:37.960]  Like I said, this is no longer a fight for just America. This is a fight between good and evil. I mean, over time, look how they're trying to take God out of schools. It's bad to pray.
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:43.960]  You can't talk about your religion. You can't do anything like that because you could offend one of these Muslim immigrants who are coming in.
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:58.960]  You know, that is something that is leading to this. And people can still sit here and see these data dumps, buy WikiLeaks, read these emails, see the corruption, see the pure evil, the ritualistic ceremonies,
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:10.960]  the fetishes that these people are obsessed with, sexting underage people. I mean, this is horrifying. And people want to actually bring that into the White House for we the people.
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:13.960]  How are we going to be a beacon of light for the whole world?
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:26.960]  Exactly. And they think that we're all just going to lay down and take it. We're not. And they've created such a nation of followers, so-called liberals, such a nation of trendies,
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:35.960]  that are so broke back, so intimidated, so mindless, so dumbed down, that they just, I mean, I saw a bunch of articles yesterday saying we're crazy.
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:47.960]  We're making it up that Hillary's committed crimes. That's a conspiracy theory. It's on record, she did. So they're now assaulting reality itself in a giant brainwashing exercise that isn't working.
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:20:00.960]  And I realized that they're all in the liberal cult that's not liberal. They're all in like some weird corporate brainwash cult, and it'll believe anything. We're outside the cult looking at them, and they're just pathetic.
[02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:38.960]  You know about RVs. You've heard about bunkers. But surviving is not recreation. And man wasn't made to live underground.

[02:20:59.960 --> 02:21:16.960]  Hello everybody. My name is Charlie Sayles. I'm a Vietnam Dentist, a Monica player, vocalist, and blues songwriter. Now I've been married, been homeless, every witch away.
[02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:29.960]  But right now, I've hooked up with a great record company, not just me, a lot of musicians. You're going to like this. This message is brought to you by FeetalRecords.com.
[02:21:46.960 --> 02:22:06.960]  Hi. My name is Stephen Holstein. In my 20s, I had used stimulant and anabolic steroids to the point where my adrenal glands were shot.
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:16.960]  I suffered from extreme fatigue and inability to handle stress. For over six years, I had been taking adrenal supplements, including herbs, glandulars, vitamin C, and vitamin B5.
[02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:25.960]  All these supplements did was treat the symptoms and produced only minimal results. Now, just after one month on Synergy 1 and ADR medics, I truly feel rejuvenated.
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:39.960]  I have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement, as I did just 10 minutes after taking ADR medics. I then noticed Synergy 1 made me wake up rested and with much more energy, no more hungover, groggy feeling upon arising.
[02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:48.960]  I had almost considered going to another country for stem cell therapy at the last resort, but now I truly feel rejuvenated on Synergy 1 and ADR medics.
[02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:59.960]  If success happens with synergistic nutrition, call 888-988-3325 or visit 1worldway.com. That's 1worldwhey.com.
[02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:28.960]  My friends, chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot worse. That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.
[02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:39.960]  Now, I've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house. The Solutions from Science system. Simply put, this thing is amazing. Solutions from Science only makes the best equipment.
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:53.960]  Go to powergridchaos.com. That's powergridchaos.com to check it out. Now, this is key. Right now, get 70% off. They're top of the line, perfect power solar generator. This is the one I use in my home.
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:24:10.960]  Go to powergridchaos.com and get 70% off.
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:38.960]  All right. In fact, Conviggs gave me the, uh, write my article he just had. It's basically exactly what I've been told by our sources that the NYPD and others are looking at press conferences.
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:51.960]  So is the FBI. That's what I was told first. It's just looking at having a press conference and saying, okay, here's the emails and go ahead and arrest whoever you want for releasing secret stuff because this is evidence of hardcore crimes.
[02:24:51.960 --> 02:25:00.960]  And they know their credibility is going to be stronger than Hillary Clinton's. So there it is. Eric Prince NYPD ready to make arrest in Anthony Wiener case.
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:13.960]  And that's a strong headline. We should probably post it ourselves and say NYPD FBI preparing press conferences to expose Hillary's crimes because it isn't just Wiener.
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:25.960]  That's what we've been told. And Eric Prince of all sources, if you don't think he doesn't have sources, nobody's got sources like him.
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:36.960]  This is an incredible four days. By the way, I just made the decision. I'm going to be here tomorrow, 6 to 8pm for at least a two hour live special transmission.
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:46.960]  It'll be internet only stations are welcome to pick it up if you want to. This we can try to put up on satellite. We've got a satellite feed here to that does our refeeds and live show.
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:56.960]  But 6 to 8pm tomorrow night, we will do a special election broadcast. And I got a feeling big things may happen by then we might go longer than that.
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:06.960]  So tomorrow, 6 to 8, we'll have a video box in full wars dot com forward slash show where you'll be able to find that.
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:12.960]  We'll also put the stream out on Paul Watson's YouTube. We have a strike against us trying to shut us down with fake copyright.
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:17.960]  So we can't live stream on our YouTube right now. This is the crap we deal with.
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:30.960]  The persons in New Zealand, I'm trying to figure out a suit them. Not that I'm litigious, but people have to pay for trying to shut down the truth that people have to learn you do that you lose your license for baritry like other people have.
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:36.960]  But all this stuff is happening. There's just so much to cover.
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:44.960]  But tomorrow night, let's tweak that out now. Let's let the Facebook, Twitter, Alex Jones to give an emergency election broadcast.
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:49.960]  Because they're saying ISIS al-Qaeda is set to hit Monday in Texas and New York, of course.
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:53.960]  You know who funds them and who runs them, the global hostility.
[02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:59.960]  We've got all the new WikiLeaks coming out. Imagine, you thought it was hardcore, a pedestrian going to satanic rituals.
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:03.960]  I mean, with hardcore Aleister Crowley stuff. I mean, this is sick.
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:13.960]  Imagine what's coming out next and the creepiness of them talking about, they'll be semen, they'll be blood, they'll be urine, they'll be flesh.
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:18.960]  They'll be, oh, but more blood than you can have. Oh, blood. They'll be blood.
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:25.960]  Oh, be there. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's just like, ugh. Ugh.
[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:31.960]  Like, heaven help us. By the way, we've officially passed one billion.
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:35.960]  We've got about five billion views YouTube vice president told us years ago.
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:38.960]  It's grown. We count everybody out there. They have a map of it.
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:44.960]  So they wanted us to monetize it all, but then that would take people's channels over. So I didn't want to do, I just want to get the word out.
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:53.960]  But five billion views a couple of years ago total, but we now have one billion just on the Alex Jones channel.
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:28:00.960]  That happened today. And you've got to understand that obviously over the years, a lot of stuff's been taken down.
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:02.960]  You name it, stuff's been hit with claims or whatever.
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:09.960]  So we're on a billion and a half views on there, but it's just good to see that because that's just one more platform. It's kind of like whack-a-mole.
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:11.960]  They're always trying to shut us down and things. We just move around.
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:18.960]  We've got more than 15 channels ourselves, but that's about maybe a billion and a half people, two billion on all our channels.
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:21.960]  All total. It was five billion years ago.
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:26.960]  I was told by, told by YouTube, because they've got to get a computer programs that can see it all.
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:32.960]  I'm going to go to break, come back with our next guest that broke down exactly what is in Breitbart today.
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:35.960]  But separately, they didn't take the special down yesterday.
[02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:38.960]  So it's one more day and then that's it.
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:46.960]  You can save 30 to 40% on info wars, high quality, storeable foods, powered by my Patriots supply, their entire catalog discounted normally 10%.

[02:28:57.960 --> 02:29:02.960]  You need the non-GMO seeds and heirloom seeds. You need the Moan Lombay shirts to spread the word.
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:06.960]  You need the great nutraceuticals at infowarslife.com.
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:09.960]  But regardless, it funds the operation.
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:15.960]  And you notice I'm not plugging as much as I used to, even though I need to, because I just can't help it.
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:17.960]  I mean, I'm going to be up here tomorrow night.
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:20.960]  I'm going to be filing special reports all day long till I'm cross-eyed,
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:24.960]  because this is a historical war going on.
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:27.960]  And we're winning that war thanks to you and your support.
[02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:35.960]  There is nowhere you can spend your money and support an organization that's bringing victory over tyranny.
[02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:38.960]  And then you get great products and great prices on top of it.
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:41.960]  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.
[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:42.960]  That's right.
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:47.960]  infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:48.960]  Stay with us.
[02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:50.960]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:52.960]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.960 --> 02:30:21.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:25.960]  These same people are funding radical Islamic terror.
[02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:29.960]  If you wish to believe that Hillary was too stupid to realize this, you'd be wrong.
[02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:35.960]  There's an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, so not so long after she left Secretary of State,
[02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:38.960]  to her campaign manager, John Podesta.
[02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:48.960]  It states that ISIL, ISIS, is funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
[02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:54.960]  So essentially, you could make the case that ISIS and Hillary Clinton take orders from the same people.
[02:30:54.960 --> 02:30:55.960]  You're with her.
[02:30:55.960 --> 02:31:21.960]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com.
