[00:47.000 --> 00:50.200]  gonna have open phones throughout the full three hours of the broadcast
[00:50.200 --> 00:53.920]  interspersed with a lot of really important news dealing with the economy
[00:53.920 --> 00:59.320]  government-run health care more information on Brevik the Norway
[00:59.320 --> 01:05.920]  shooter Ron Paul won the big straw poll in Iowa on the heels of the debate last
[01:05.920 --> 01:12.400]  night and everywhere across talk radio mainline television news there is the
[01:12.400 --> 01:16.880]  talking point that Ron Paul can't win as they get more and more horrified that
[01:16.880 --> 01:23.160]  he's won in Iowa in major polls in straw polls he's won in New Hampshire and so
[01:23.160 --> 01:27.240]  they're just going to continue to say he cannot win cannot win cannot win so
[01:27.240 --> 01:30.780]  that weak-minded people say well I'm gonna go on the bandwagon with who can
[01:30.780 --> 01:35.880]  win the guy that authored Obamacare in Massachusetts meant Romney or the man

[01:40.520 --> 01:45.600]  going to is going to save us and CBS News reported last night that he's told
[01:45.600 --> 01:52.760]  them he will be announcing tomorrow ladies and gentlemen I live in Austin I
[01:52.760 --> 01:57.840]  told you Rick Perry two years ago was going to run for president I told you
[01:57.840 --> 02:02.240]  that his pledge it was completely fake that he would not run for the 2012
[02:02.240 --> 02:05.480]  election remember he pledged he wouldn't and then he says he may break his
[02:05.480 --> 02:10.080]  pledge he always intended to give a fake pledge to peak interest to make him
[02:10.080 --> 02:13.800]  look like the reluctant hero and so that doesn't make it breaking a pledge
[02:13.800 --> 02:18.880]  which is bad enough makes him a liar but I understand folks like to be conva
[02:18.880 --> 02:22.560]  Obama and a lot of conservatives are gonna want to get hurt real bad by Rick
[02:22.560 --> 02:27.840]  Perry I understand it's a national pastime to be gullible so we're gonna

[05:01.040 --> 05:03.960]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered
[05:03.960 --> 05:07.800]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[05:07.800 --> 05:12.040]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[05:12.040 --> 05:16.320]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[05:16.320 --> 05:20.680]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[05:20.680 --> 05:24.760]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[05:24.760 --> 05:29.320]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.320 --> 05:33.440]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.440 --> 05:37.400]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[05:37.400 --> 05:41.240]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.240 --> 05:43.960]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[05:43.960 --> 05:49.960]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[08:27.360 --> 08:33.000]  going to be live here again for the next three hours and I have to really control
[08:33.000 --> 08:40.000]  myself right now to not boil with abject total anger and disgust by all the
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  news that I have here in front of me the raids on Amish for selling cheese and
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.360]  potatoes to their neighbors the raids on stores selling raw milk and water
[08:51.360 --> 08:59.040]  melons the attacks across the board on people trying to grow gardens in their
[08:59.040 --> 09:06.000]  own front yards and backyards we live in a giant prison regulations are passed
[09:06.000 --> 09:12.560]  to shut down the little guy all the big guys are exempt it is a mafia system to
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.560]  shut down their competition and I have several examples of this right here in
[09:17.560 --> 09:20.680]  front of me that I want to mention that I'm going to get into all the other news
[09:20.680 --> 09:29.680]  and come back to it postal service proposes cutting 1,020 jobs pulling out
[09:29.680 --> 09:37.440]  of health care plan oh and over 2,000 major corporations like McDonald's have
[09:37.440 --> 09:44.000]  been given White House exemptions from the health care law they're exempt but
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.520]  your business my business is not exempt this is the nature of a mafia
[09:51.520 --> 10:02.720]  government and when you look at what's happening with the animal ID premises ID
[10:02.720 --> 10:08.680]  the feds have tried to force through on the already struggling and really almost
[10:08.680 --> 10:15.080]  extinct family farm and ranch or even truck farmer that's under all out just
[10:15.080 --> 10:23.320]  total assault by regulations by bureaucrats by harassers by all of these
[10:23.320 --> 10:29.160]  federally controlled rural council goons what does the Declaration of
[10:29.160 --> 10:36.080]  Independence talk about he has created a multitude of offices and sent forth
[10:36.080 --> 10:44.880]  swarms of officers to eat out our substance and that's what's happening
[10:44.880 --> 10:52.440]  you know when you look at the premises ID animal ID which again people fought
[10:52.440 --> 10:58.880]  and hasn't been completely implemented a small family farm with chickens is
[10:58.880 --> 11:04.560]  forced to buy five to ten dollar tags per chicken when you couldn't sell the
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.200]  chicken for five dollars on average but then Tyson chicken and others they are
[11:10.200 --> 11:16.040]  exempt and only have to have a tag per section of a giant building full of
[11:16.040 --> 11:26.760]  hundreds of thousands in some cases millions of of of of enslaved drug zombie
[11:26.760 --> 11:32.640]  chickens where people that go into the chicken facilities the chicken complexes
[11:32.640 --> 11:37.040]  have to wear a mask in many cases because if any human germs get on them
[11:37.040 --> 11:42.200]  they're all so debilitated and on so many drugs they'll die it's the same thing
[11:42.200 --> 11:48.800]  with many of the big pig farms now so big agra's got this got this nightmare
[11:49.400 --> 11:57.200]  science fiction gulag system going to produce chickens and and pigs and
[11:57.200 --> 12:01.160]  things like that and there's total harassment against the small family
[12:01.160 --> 12:07.560]  farms and ranches with bureaucratic red tape being being being spewed at them
[12:07.560 --> 12:16.200]  being being launched at them in a full-out complete and total assault
[12:21.840 --> 12:30.800]  it's incredible and the average city slicker 91% of the population has no
[12:30.800 --> 12:35.120]  idea what's happening in the rural communities they are completely
[12:35.120 --> 12:41.320]  imploding across the country they are ghost towns and those that can hang on
[12:41.320 --> 12:49.720]  with family farms or ranches almost all work in town for the highway department
[12:49.720 --> 12:57.800]  or for the prison or for the power plant or at a fish you know bait shop or at a
[12:57.800 --> 13:01.200]  gas station or a restaurant and then they come home at night and work on the
[13:01.200 --> 13:06.440]  farm and work on the weekends and the taxes are going up and the regulations
[13:06.440 --> 13:11.440]  and the IRS now if you've got a hundred and something year old family hobby
[13:11.440 --> 13:17.120]  farm they come in and they say you can't have tax exemptions for a farm anymore
[13:17.120 --> 13:22.360]  if it's not profitable we're going back five years now you owe us all this money
[13:22.360 --> 13:27.680]  and you say but I just worked the farm to keep it and to pay the property tax
[13:27.680 --> 13:31.520]  and they say we don't care you can't make it profitable all your tax
[13:31.520 --> 13:41.560]  exemptions are gone and it's a it's a complete end of America the end of the
[13:41.560 --> 13:49.080]  world's bread basket and a key part of the globalist operation to make us
[13:49.080 --> 13:56.400]  completely dependent on big agra big business big government and as I mentioned
[13:56.400 --> 14:02.040]  here's the Washington Post today postal service proposing 120,000 people to be
[14:02.040 --> 14:08.800]  cut postal service proposal cutting 120,000 jobs pulling out of healthcare
[14:08.800 --> 14:20.120]  plan and it goes on here to say that well they're they're gonna get an
[14:20.120 --> 14:25.800]  exemption from Lord Obama because you can't compete you see if you're a private
[14:25.800 --> 14:30.040]  company you're gonna have to buy that healthcare unless you're one of the
[14:30.040 --> 14:36.440]  2000 plus special companies he's he's he's given a waiver to and of course if
[14:36.440 --> 14:39.480]  you're the federal government you're gonna get a waiver from that as well
[14:39.480 --> 14:43.280]  because the postal service says they're gonna go completely bankrupt if they
[14:43.280 --> 14:49.840]  have to well that's the whole plan or for private businesses you know I hear
[14:49.840 --> 14:55.600]  mainline talk radio starting to finally get it and saying it's as if Obama wants
[14:55.600 --> 15:00.640]  to bankrupt America it's as if he wants to end the free market system well it's
[15:00.640 --> 15:06.560]  not Obama that wants that Obama's a teleprompter reading puppet a political
[15:06.560 --> 15:10.920]  prostitute a bought and paid for individual from his days are working
[15:10.920 --> 15:15.100]  for the Ford Foundation and his mama who worked for him work for Geithner's
[15:15.100 --> 15:20.960]  daddy you know the mainline neocons on radio they want you to hate Obama and
[15:20.960 --> 15:28.220]  look at Obama and I hate Obama I mean I would hate some mafia and Forster low
[15:28.220 --> 15:32.760]  level soldier who was in the mafia in New York if he came up to me and into my
[15:32.760 --> 15:37.880]  business and said pay me protection money I'd I'd probably jump over the
[15:37.880 --> 15:42.200]  counter and take care of business I just can't help it not because I'm tough
[15:42.200 --> 15:49.840]  but because I'm not a slave but I'd really hate who sent them I'd really hate
[15:49.840 --> 15:55.160]  who they work for you see and see if the mafia did anything to my family then I'd
[15:55.160 --> 16:00.200]  find out who their boss was and I'd come after him that's why in the south and in
[16:00.200 --> 16:06.640]  the west the mafia never did too good study your history because people
[16:06.640 --> 16:11.320]  wouldn't put up with it now as immigrant populations came in from eastern and
[16:11.320 --> 16:16.760]  southern Europe who were accustomed to living under the mafia mafia did quite
[16:16.760 --> 16:23.080]  well and got a good toehold in and see under the federal government somehow
[16:23.080 --> 16:28.120]  though Americans whether they be in the north the south the east the west the
[16:28.120 --> 16:34.880]  Midwest they will roll over to federal mafia any day of the week and they love
[16:34.880 --> 16:39.640]  it you know Americans think discrimination can only be on race or
[16:39.640 --> 16:46.920]  sex or religion that's all child's play and the feds promote an obsession with
[16:46.920 --> 16:51.000]  all of that now hypersensitivity to that so you'll obsess over it and run to them
[16:51.000 --> 16:56.200]  to be the referee so you'll come to the real organized crime for protection but
[16:56.200 --> 17:02.560]  the real discrimination goes on all around you where the fortune 500 pays
[17:02.560 --> 17:07.920]  almost no property tax in any county city or state they live in in fact many
[17:07.920 --> 17:13.800]  times they're actually paid to come to your area but your company your little
[17:13.800 --> 17:20.320]  operation my little operation I've gone and asked the city for tax cuts and
[17:20.320 --> 17:25.280]  exemption and they laughed at me three years ago it was as if it was a
[17:25.280 --> 17:31.960]  ridiculous joke a native Texan a truly independent operation and company an
[17:31.960 --> 17:38.200]  independent media operation I am like rotten garbage to be dumped out rotten
[17:38.200 --> 17:44.000]  milk same thing we've approached YouTube and said you know our channels have
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.280]  hundreds and hundreds of millions of views we'd like to be a partner channel
[17:47.280 --> 17:52.280]  we'd like to be able to upload full-length videos and they just laughed at us and
[17:52.280 --> 17:55.640]  people complained they say why are these videos you produce for free for us
[17:55.640 --> 18:01.600]  broken up in ports well we don't have a partner channel we don't have a director
[18:01.600 --> 18:05.760]  channel we set up a another channel and by accident they gave it to us for a
[18:05.760 --> 18:11.240]  while and saw us putting it up and took it away from us but that's okay because
[18:11.240 --> 18:15.840]  the more they try to tilt the odds against us the harder I'm gonna dig in
[18:15.840 --> 18:19.880]  and I'm in a fight and that's the spirit our farmers and ranchers and our small
[18:19.880 --> 18:23.880]  businesses need to have and people need to support small businesses and
[18:23.880 --> 18:28.080]  independent radio stations and independent newspapers not not even if
[18:28.080 --> 18:33.640]  they're not a hundred percent what you agree with we better support local and
[18:33.640 --> 18:40.920]  we better do it now now I've got all this world news I've got all this
[18:40.920 --> 18:46.200]  military news that I'm gonna cover here

[24:02.160 --> 24:30.880]  political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[24:30.880 --> 24:37.760]  you want to know what's wrong with America we have multinational corporations
[24:37.760 --> 24:44.320]  predominantly the fortune 100 but a lot of the fortune 500 are involved as well
[24:44.320 --> 24:50.080]  to write the loss I mean it's it's public fact it was all over even mainstream
[24:50.080 --> 24:55.600]  news last November that big agro wrote the food safety act didn't matter it was
[24:55.600 --> 25:02.160]  big agra that caused the two or three big health scares that happened last year
[25:02.160 --> 25:06.680]  didn't matter if it was big giant industrial production facilities that
[25:06.680 --> 25:12.640]  put out the salmonella and that put out the eco lie didn't matter if it turned
[25:12.640 --> 25:17.400]  out it was the same groups in Germany they write the laws every time they
[25:17.400 --> 25:24.280]  screw up to shut down their competition and it's the same in every single field
[25:24.280 --> 25:32.680]  of this country the big guys shutting down the little guys and the railroads
[25:32.680 --> 25:38.480]  tried to do it when they expanded west in fact we had our war with Britain over
[25:38.480 --> 25:44.000]  gun control but also over laws meant to shut down the little guys in commerce and
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.120]  in farming the civil war really started over that not over slavery you go back
[25:50.120 --> 25:54.120]  and look at the north putting all sorts of regulations on the south that was
[25:54.120 --> 25:58.640]  predominantly agricultural but exempting themselves in the north this is
[25:58.640 --> 26:05.320]  always the issue is economic discrimination by the insiders America
[26:05.320 --> 26:12.760]  was founded against these types of unfair trade advantages and everybody's
[26:12.760 --> 26:17.840]  looking for racism against blacks or whites people are looking for
[26:17.840 --> 26:23.520]  discrimination on what sexual preference they have while meanwhile the real
[26:23.520 --> 26:30.600]  discrimination is going on against the little guy no matter what color you are
[26:30.600 --> 26:36.800]  now let me go ahead and get to this article right here one of these is out
[26:36.800 --> 26:43.680]  of the Virginia Gazette the other is out of the journal Sentinel and it says a
[26:43.680 --> 26:49.960]  new rule not a law but a rule and there's not a law that the TSA could stick
[26:49.960 --> 26:53.400]  their hands down your pants and be on the streets of America now but there's a
[26:53.400 --> 27:00.840]  rule then they made a rule a new rule being proposed by the federal Department
[27:00.840 --> 27:05.320]  of Transportation would require farmers to get commercial driver's license see
[27:05.320 --> 27:11.040]  and and nowhere do they point out in these articles the big issues here since
[27:11.040 --> 27:16.920]  when does the federal government have control of our transportation within
[27:16.920 --> 27:21.240]  the states since when do they get to set the speed limit or what color the road
[27:21.240 --> 27:27.960]  signs are oh some federal money comes in that was taken from the state to begin
[27:27.960 --> 27:38.040]  with but now now they're going to empower under federal rules and the states are
[27:38.040 --> 27:43.320]  all gonna get behind this to turn loose the county and city and state truck
[27:43.320 --> 27:49.920]  police to pull up at your farmer ranch and to come up and white glove inspect
[27:49.920 --> 27:56.360]  your farm equipment and if you don't know what they do to truck drivers
[27:56.360 --> 28:04.120]  aggregate haulers furniture store drivers they don't care long haulers the
[28:04.120 --> 28:07.560]  people that keep this country running who have really got super hard hellish
[28:07.560 --> 28:18.720]  jobs in my opinion if they are able to get away with this it is another serious
[28:18.720 --> 28:30.200]  blow to this country and a giant federal power grab over every rural
[28:30.200 --> 28:36.920]  community in this country now the feds say they're gonna make a rule not a law
[28:36.920 --> 28:48.160]  a rule that they have jurisdiction on your farm your ranch and that you were
[28:48.160 --> 28:54.160]  going to have to pay to take the classes and the yearly fines and the fees to get
[28:54.160 --> 28:58.440]  your commercial license and they sell it in this particular article out of the
[28:58.440 --> 29:04.640]  Gazette the Virginia Gazette then oh well it's just some small little fees
[29:04.640 --> 29:11.640]  it's it's no big deal oh really under the regulations that the feds have do you
[29:11.640 --> 29:18.640]  have any idea the type of harassment what is white glove inspection at West
[29:18.640 --> 29:24.360]  Point and other military academies they come in wearing white gloves into your
[29:24.360 --> 29:28.680]  barracks and they go around the white bulbs and they go under the beds in the
[29:28.680 --> 29:34.680]  floor if they can find any dirt on that white glove you get a demerit and so
[29:34.680 --> 29:41.320]  you've got to go basically run laps or get extra duties well in this case you
[29:41.320 --> 29:46.080]  get fines and fees so they're gonna come up to your old tractor well let me tell

[34:01.280 --> 34:05.880]  big hoax that I see ongoing they did it three and a half years ago they're
[34:05.880 --> 34:10.600]  doing it again I heard it on local talk radio this morning yeah Ron Paul's
[34:10.600 --> 34:15.280]  winning the straw polls and scientific polls in New Hampshire and Iowa normally
[34:15.280 --> 34:19.480]  the news would say that's the front runner he's probably gonna win he would
[34:19.480 --> 34:23.600]  be catapulted into the absolute national lead and Ron Paul would end up
[34:23.600 --> 34:28.800]  being the president but the system is put out the talking point that all the
[34:28.800 --> 34:32.440]  little minions and compartmentalized people parrot they're not even government
[34:32.440 --> 34:36.080]  agents they're just they just go with the flow and they're saying Ron Paul can't
[34:36.080 --> 34:40.840]  win Ron Paul can't win Ron Paul can't win Ron Paul can't win the American
[34:40.840 --> 34:46.200]  people want somebody with better-looking hair like Rick Perry or Mitt Romney both
[34:46.200 --> 34:52.240]  of them literal Democratic operatives in the flesh oh oh you didn't know Mitt
[34:52.240 --> 34:55.480]  Romney wrote the health care bill that was a model for Obama you didn't know
[34:55.480 --> 34:58.520]  he supports global carbon taxes you didn't know Duke Gendrich supports
[34:58.520 --> 35:02.840]  global carbon taxes and as a wrote the forward to Alvin and Heidi Toffler's
[35:02.840 --> 35:08.720]  but two of their books calling for world government I've read the quotes here
[35:08.720 --> 35:14.080]  calling for world government and the end of national sovereignty just like the
[35:14.080 --> 35:17.480]  former editor of Newsweek strobe Talbot who then went to work for Clinton I mean
[35:17.480 --> 35:22.440]  they're all the same scum or or oh you're thinking what Rick Perry Al Gore's
[35:22.440 --> 35:30.000]  former campaign chairman in Texas for president you mean him oh you mean by the
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.360]  way I always get emails and comments going I thought you were a liar I went
[35:33.360 --> 35:36.520]  and looked that up about Rick Perry why haven't I heard that you think I'm gonna
[35:36.520 --> 35:40.320]  get up here and tell you he was the campaign chairman for Al Gore in his
[35:40.320 --> 35:44.680]  first presidential run when he was a senator in 1988 you think I'm gonna get
[35:44.680 --> 35:49.160]  up here on the radio and lie to you consciously I make little mistakes
[35:49.160 --> 35:54.560]  sometimes but I'm not gonna make a mistake about something like that all
[35:54.560 --> 35:59.720]  right I told you Rick Perry well I actually told you three and a half years
[35:59.720 --> 36:04.000]  ago it's an endgame was gonna run for president in the 2012 election I told you
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.240]  two years ago he was going to claim he wasn't gonna run and going to run I
[36:09.240 --> 36:15.720]  told you when he made the pledge six months ago to not run in 2012 I said
[36:15.720 --> 36:19.160]  he's gonna break that pledge he plans to break it he's he's piquing your
[36:19.160 --> 36:26.520]  interest that he's the hero who is reluctant and he's gonna break that
[36:26.520 --> 36:29.360]  pledge tomorrow
[36:29.360 --> 36:40.880]  you know if you go with the opposite of whatever the establishment media and
[36:40.880 --> 36:44.880]  government says you'll do pretty good but I don't just go with whatever the
[36:44.880 --> 36:49.080]  opposite of what they say that's a good rule I mean if you're going in the dark
[36:49.080 --> 36:53.440]  and and they say go left you go right they say go up you go down they say
[36:53.440 --> 36:59.520]  zig you you you zag but I don't go off that if I've got a split second decision
[36:59.520 --> 37:02.720]  to make I automatically don't believe him and it's always holds me in good
[37:02.720 --> 37:07.440]  stead because he's a congenital psychopaths with an army of sociopaths
[37:07.440 --> 37:13.640]  that work for him social engineers that have lulled the general public into a
[37:13.640 --> 37:21.800]  deep trance and so now they can get away with anything unless we wake people up
[37:21.800 --> 37:27.120]  out of their trance but I'm gonna be going over that Ron Paul has won a big
[37:27.120 --> 37:35.600]  straw poll ABC news is reporting Ron Paul won with 44% a super whopping
[37:35.600 --> 37:40.200]  victory kind of like he had the second largest margin of victory in CPAC
[37:40.200 --> 37:47.120]  history this year and Fox News dubbed booing over him being announced the
[37:47.120 --> 37:52.000]  winner and you're like oh well Fox News is they tried to lie to me but that's
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.320]  okay I like to be lied to it's fun to have them try to manipulate me like I'm
[37:57.320 --> 38:02.840]  a monkey or something it's kind of cute to be conned and and have somebody run
[38:02.840 --> 38:08.200]  over you you know a normal red-blooded man gets upset by con artists gets upset
[38:08.200 --> 38:12.800]  by criminals gets upset by bullies because if you don't have that instinct
[38:12.800 --> 38:18.280]  you your family your tribe your people have no future America had the most
[38:18.280 --> 38:23.080]  red-blooded most aggressive people who demanded the maximum level of liberty so
[38:23.080 --> 38:30.800]  we got the maximum level of prosperity but notice as we get rid of our
[38:30.800 --> 38:37.280]  anti-establishment untrustful attitude towards government as we stopped being
[38:37.280 --> 38:44.240]  aggressive suddenly all of our prosperity is burning up in front of our
[38:44.240 --> 38:49.640]  eyes and the systems come out in the last three months in Newsweek time and
[38:49.640 --> 38:53.240]  every other major publication I've looked at I've walked into newsstands and
[38:53.240 --> 38:58.080]  just seen it every 10th magazine it's just everywhere the political section
[38:58.080 --> 39:01.640]  it's every other headline the Constitution is the problem get rid of it
[39:01.640 --> 39:05.120]  and you'll have prosperity and you know what the general public a lot of them
[39:05.120 --> 39:08.480]  are gonna come and say get rid of the Constitution get rid of due process do
[39:08.480 --> 39:12.000]  whatever the government says they promise to bring it back yeah like each
[39:12.000 --> 39:18.480]  banker bailout they promise to give you each banker bailout they promise
[39:18.480 --> 39:22.640]  everything's gonna be fixed right after you give us more power and then you do
[39:22.640 --> 39:28.200]  it and then things get worse and now they've got a star chamber committee of
[39:28.200 --> 39:37.920]  13 up there who has created a new branch of government and there isn't a big
[39:37.920 --> 39:42.040]  uproar because we've already been trained how to be slaves we've already put
[39:42.040 --> 39:47.280]  up with wars without congressional approval and wireless warrantless
[39:47.280 --> 39:53.160]  wiretapping we've already put up with the government with a straight face
[39:53.160 --> 39:56.880]  saying yeah we ordered the torture of people including children in front of
[39:56.880 --> 40:01.600]  their parents Washington Post and then I was on the phone yesterday with an
[40:01.600 --> 40:06.600]  establishment writer from Slate and and and that's why I refuse most interviews
[40:06.600 --> 40:10.960]  now with these people not because I can't intellectually deal with an
[40:10.960 --> 40:17.000]  argument with them but I just don't have time for for children for children
[40:17.000 --> 40:22.800]  when classical tyranny is pouring in all around us the water is rising and
[40:22.800 --> 40:27.560]  they're looking at you telling you everything's fine they think it's a
[40:27.560 --> 40:33.680]  virtue to deny that we're in trouble they think like children they control
[40:33.680 --> 40:37.800]  reality they have magical thinking that's what Oprah Winfrey pushing that
[40:37.800 --> 40:42.760]  stupid idea the secret was so popular where you just imagine something and it
[40:42.760 --> 40:48.600]  happens no if you imagine it and it's feasible and you work on it you may be
[40:48.600 --> 40:55.200]  able to manifest it but it doesn't magically happen like you throw some
[40:55.200 --> 41:00.680]  dust in a fire and there's a blue puff of smoke in a Easter Bunny appears that
[41:00.680 --> 41:06.880]  doesn't work and so people just think well I choose to not believe that things
[41:06.880 --> 41:11.400]  are this bad I choose to believe we're not going into a depression and that
[41:11.400 --> 41:17.240]  somehow that'll that'll make it not be a depression the toll free number to join
[41:17.240 --> 41:27.320]  us is 800-259-9231-1800-2599-2331 and we don't screen your calls but I do not
[41:27.320 --> 41:31.000]  like getting the whole show caught up in people just plugging stuff because we
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.200]  don't screen your calls so you've got to talk about one of these issues first
[41:35.200 --> 41:38.160]  and you can throw a plug in at the end or I may just hang up on you because I
[41:38.160 --> 41:40.880]  want the good callers that really have points to make to be able to get
[41:40.880 --> 41:49.960]  involved on air 800-259-9231 here on this live Friday edition I tell you the
[41:49.960 --> 41:54.360]  show's a lot better when I screen calls every once in a while we'll say only
[41:54.360 --> 41:59.080]  military callers only police callers only firefighters only farmers you know in
[41:59.080 --> 42:06.160]  a particular issue only organic food farmers only radio broadcasters you know
[42:06.160 --> 42:09.800]  to really get only people from England who've witnessed the riots and their
[42:09.800 --> 42:13.960]  incredible calls every one of them but when I just open the phones up the
[42:13.960 --> 42:18.680]  people who are sitting there on Prozac or whatever laying back on their backs
[42:18.680 --> 42:22.320]  kind of get up out of the bed wipe the crust out of their eyes and call in and
[42:22.320 --> 42:28.040]  jam the phones up so I'm changing the way this show runs I'm not gonna screen
[42:28.040 --> 42:33.200]  your calls but if you sound like you are drunk you are not going to be on the
[42:33.200 --> 42:41.560]  air 800-259-9231 but I've been watching this Ron Poles we need to do a
[42:41.560 --> 42:46.040]  breakdown of it it has won around two-thirds of the straw polls in the
[42:46.040 --> 42:53.560]  last few months and he won a whopping 44% of the unique voters Herman Cain 16
[42:53.560 --> 43:01.240]  Michelle Bachman 10 Perry 8 Palente and Mitt Romney 5% Sarah Palin 4%
[43:01.240 --> 43:07.480]  someone else 3% Rick Santorum 2 but if you watch the news you're told it's Rick
[43:07.480 --> 43:12.920]  Perry and the other Democratic operative
[43:13.240 --> 43:25.160]  Mitt Romney and again he's being hailed as our only hope and and yeah I guess
[43:25.160 --> 43:32.040]  Al Gore's former chief of staff in Texas is is our only hope okay and he is
[43:32.040 --> 43:35.880]  actually from Texas folks around the country for whatever reason have kind
[43:35.880 --> 43:40.040]  of a romantic love affair with Texans most your big newscasters for some reason
[43:40.040 --> 43:45.080]  end up being from Texas I don't know why but I guess he really wasn't born in
[43:45.080 --> 43:50.800]  Kenny Buckport main not bashing folks in Maine they're great people but I guess
[43:50.800 --> 43:56.320]  he's a Texan I guess there's something real about him that's about it that's
[43:56.320 --> 43:58.840]  about it
[44:01.880 --> 44:06.440]  and you know what I'll be now called a communist I've already been called a
[44:06.440 --> 44:12.920]  communist by the Dallas blog and others for not liking Rick Perry I was called a
[44:12.920 --> 44:16.000]  right-wing hate monger for not liking Obama and now I've got to get ready to
[44:16.000 --> 44:21.760]  be called a commie again when I didn't like Clinton because he was a globalist
[44:21.760 --> 44:25.440]  operative I was a right-wing extremist and then Bush was in and continued the
[44:25.440 --> 44:29.400]  globalist agenda and I was a communist and now Obama's been and I've been an
[44:29.400 --> 44:34.280]  extreme right-winger and now I've got to get ready to be a commie again I thought
[44:34.280 --> 44:37.320]  I was a constitutionalist I thought I was a realist I thought I was somebody
[44:37.320 --> 44:42.200]  who actually studied reality and was into being informed and being a steward of
[44:42.200 --> 44:46.520]  my community and my family and trying to be a decent person I thought I thought
[44:46.520 --> 44:51.080]  that but see well there's stereotypical labels so I've got to get ready for that
[44:51.080 --> 44:54.840]  the good news is people aren't buying this anymore but I'll get back to what
[44:54.840 --> 44:58.880]  really has me beside myself with anger because I knew it was coming I'd seen the
[44:58.880 --> 45:03.560]  Department of Transportation talking about this two years ago now they started
[45:03.560 --> 45:16.760]  the public comment period and they're saying don't worry the Department of
[45:16.760 --> 45:20.080]  Transportation is looking at reclassifying farm vehicles and
[45:20.080 --> 45:25.480]  implements and implements that's your shredder as commercial vehicles and
[45:25.480 --> 45:30.320]  implements I went into the federal website this morning in about 6 30 a.m. and
[45:30.320 --> 45:34.360]  couldn't believe it when I read the actual document you know you can go
[45:34.360 --> 45:37.200]  comment on it they could careless what you say but you can you can comment on
[45:37.200 --> 45:40.680]  it maybe you could decide what color scarf to wear over your eyes in the
[45:40.680 --> 45:47.240]  firing squad or you can have some last words you have a cigarette maybe if you
[45:47.240 --> 45:55.040]  ask if you're nice it's a little things that count the proposed rule change would
[45:55.040 --> 45:59.680]  mean that anyone who drives a tractor or operates any piece of motorized farming
[45:59.680 --> 46:04.440]  equipment will be required to pass the same test to complete the same detailed
[46:04.440 --> 46:10.640]  forms and logs every mile you drive oh yeah when you went to sleep at night
[46:10.640 --> 46:16.400]  we're gonna learn you good required of semi-tracked or trailer drivers drivers
[46:16.400 --> 46:19.760]  would keep logs of information including hours worked and miles traveled
[46:19.760 --> 46:27.560]  vehicles will be required to display DOT numbers CDL in Virginia cost 64 for eight
[46:27.560 --> 46:31.240]  years and eight dollars per year not including the cost of instructional class
[46:31.240 --> 46:36.760]  and written test yeah I looked it up it's hundreds of dollars a year in Texas
[46:36.760 --> 46:40.280]  and then the end of this federal situation there's even more rules but
[46:40.280 --> 46:45.720]  that's not the issue it's the logs and it's the inspections and they're gonna
[46:45.720 --> 46:52.400]  come on your property and if your brakes are worn down on that old tractor or you
[46:52.400 --> 46:55.440]  haven't changed your spark plugs they're gonna hit you with fines that make your
[46:55.440 --> 47:01.160]  head spin they go and actually white glove with a glove in Austin dirt on the
[47:01.160 --> 47:04.960]  back bumper and I drove by and almost wanted to pull over and videotape it
[47:04.960 --> 47:09.680]  just a few days ago I see them out here on 290 every day of the truck
[47:09.680 --> 47:13.120]  police as they're called by the truck drivers and they pull over brand new
[47:13.120 --> 47:17.240]  looking trucks you name it and they're sitting there look at those brakes there
[47:17.240 --> 47:20.560]  they're wiping for dirt and they're hitting them with five hundred thousand
[47:20.560 --> 47:27.320]  dollar fines it is incredible you know oh it's for our safety well let me
[47:27.320 --> 47:33.840]  explain something I witnessed my grandfather taking pieces of coke cans
[47:33.840 --> 47:42.800]  and rubber bands and rigging combines to work and operate I it is a culture of
[47:42.800 --> 47:46.800]  people bragging at least where my family's from in these Texas to say take
[47:46.800 --> 47:50.480]  a look at this tractor and open it up and show how they custom rig some
[47:50.480 --> 47:54.040]  50-year-old thing to work great that's the only way they're in business they
[47:54.040 --> 47:59.200]  can't go buy those big giant new tractors they can't go into debt we've got a
[47:59.200 --> 48:05.080]  40-year-old tractor still working on our ranch out in East Texas and it runs
[48:05.080 --> 48:11.520]  better than the South Korean piece of junk that my uncle bought 10 years ago
[48:11.520 --> 48:19.120]  that thing was breaking down the first year we got it but not the 40-year-old
[48:19.120 --> 48:24.320]  tractor that I rode around with my grandfather and it's got like a 30-
[48:24.320 --> 48:28.600]  something-year-old shredder on the back of it and it keeps it going and you know
[48:28.600 --> 48:33.200]  what the feds are gonna come in there they're gonna say that thing is out of
[48:33.200 --> 48:39.160]  business where are your logs I want to see them federal jurisdiction over your
[48:39.160 --> 48:45.240]  farm your ranch you know they started all this tyranny back in the 20s and 30s
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.960]  they went to the dumb down public and they said you're paying for these roads
[48:49.960 --> 48:55.240]  and the trucks are heavier than your car they're making a little money let's
[48:55.240 --> 49:01.200]  charge them more for the roads let's make them get a license and that's how it
[49:01.200 --> 49:05.240]  started and it wasn't till the 50s that most states had a driver's license for
[49:05.240 --> 49:11.240]  citizens and now they're expanding oh and let me tell you what's coming next
[49:11.240 --> 49:17.160]  they're gonna make anybody with an RV or pulling a trailer get a commercial
[49:17.160 --> 49:25.400]  license and and they talk about it in here they're gonna come on your property
[49:25.400 --> 49:30.080]  and they're gonna go back there to that heirloom tractor that you keep running
[49:30.080 --> 49:34.800]  because you love it and they're going to look at its brakes they're gonna look
[49:34.800 --> 49:39.480]  at its spark plugs and they're gonna look at its its pistons they're gonna
[49:39.480 --> 49:44.400]  look that old popper you got out back that single cylinder and oh by the way
[49:44.400 --> 49:47.400]  they're saying you're gonna be under tell the big the big one I forgot I
[49:47.400 --> 49:51.320]  forgot the biggest point here they say they also want to do this to make you
[49:51.320 --> 49:58.200]  go under the new clean air carbon tax because they've cleaned up all these
[49:58.200 --> 50:03.200]  vehicles except the old ones and the and now the new ones no matter how clean

[55:24.240 --> 55:28.560]  man I tell you what a visionary Bob Dylan I've talked to a couple famous
[55:28.560 --> 55:31.880]  people that know Bob Dylan they've told me he's fully aware of the whole New
[55:31.880 --> 55:34.920]  World Order I've got it from two different sources and I'll just leave it
[55:34.920 --> 55:40.680]  at that he's handing people anti-globalist books and stuff definitely
[55:40.680 --> 55:44.440]  has a very deep understanding of things and if you're listening out there
[55:44.440 --> 55:47.920]  Bob we've never contacted you but if you ever want to come on the radio we love
[55:47.920 --> 55:51.160]  to hear from you we know you're pretty reclusive as well so I think there's
[55:51.160 --> 55:55.240]  not very good chance of that but who would have ever thought that we would
[55:55.240 --> 55:58.000]  have been contacted by some of the other folks that have contacted us the
[55:58.000 --> 56:04.520]  problem is is that usually they don't want to come on air same thing with
[56:04.520 --> 56:09.000]  Kurt Vonnegut just wanted to let us know we appreciate the show what we were
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.640]  doing and he was about to retire never be seen again giving his last speech in a
[56:13.640 --> 56:20.200]  month he told us going on to some university his alma mater and then he
[56:20.200 --> 56:22.600]  went and gave the speech and a few months later fell down had his head was
[56:22.600 --> 56:28.280]  dead but I do have that little little painting Kurt Vonnegut sent me it's a
[56:28.280 --> 56:34.600]  bird cage with a bird flying out of it the symbol of Libertad the French
[56:34.600 --> 56:40.360]  Revolution it's a bird cage with the door open with the birdie flying out I
[56:40.360 --> 56:43.720]  got a coffee cup like that I was at a restaurant they were selling coffee
[56:43.720 --> 56:47.440]  cups and I saw one and bought it my favorite coffee cup you know I'm one of
[56:47.440 --> 56:52.200]  those weirdos I'm a free bird I want to be free and I guess Kurt Vonnegut was
[56:52.200 --> 56:58.080]  too it would really help though the people that I know that are even more
[56:58.080 --> 57:02.080]  famous than Kurt Vonnegut more famous than anybody we've ever talked about
[57:02.080 --> 57:10.800]  here on air would go public for freedom and who knows they might but in one of
[57:10.800 --> 57:13.640]  their words people I was talking to they've already gone through quite a
[57:13.640 --> 57:18.520]  bit I guess so who am I to tell folks to stand up when they've already stood up
[57:18.520 --> 57:21.720]  and paid such a high price
[57:24.080 --> 57:28.720]  you know I think it comes down to this at the end of the day if you don't have
[57:28.720 --> 57:34.240]  an instinct when you see classical forms of slavery being set up and you and as
[57:34.240 --> 57:38.520]  a free man you see that your freedom is being undermined and that you're being
[57:38.520 --> 57:42.960]  surrounded and that parasites are amassing weaponry and trying to
[57:42.960 --> 57:46.360]  diminish you and trying to break your will and train you to accept their
[57:46.360 --> 57:53.600]  authority and domination over you if you it'd be one thing 15 20 years ago 30
[57:53.600 --> 57:58.040]  years ago if you weren't awake but you've got to be deaf dumb and blind to not
[57:58.040 --> 58:04.720]  know that our whole culture is in deep trouble and crooks are running things and
[58:04.720 --> 58:10.240]  to see the media nonchalantly pushing it oh yeah it's really easy the feds are
[58:10.240 --> 58:13.560]  gonna be over your your farming equipment now and there's gonna be some
[58:13.560 --> 58:17.480]  inspections and they're gonna be coming out making sure you got your log books
[58:17.480 --> 58:24.120]  all together and there's gonna be some fines and the sick part is they're gonna
[58:24.120 --> 58:29.080]  get all the rodeos and all the fairs involved and all the tractor supply
[58:29.080 --> 58:33.320]  companies involved so when you want to go buy a tractor go to the fair they're
[58:33.320 --> 58:37.920]  to do this with animal ID premises ID they won't let you in if you haven't
[58:37.920 --> 58:51.520]  complied this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network you've

[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:35.720]  TV this morning internet Ron Paul can't win Ron Paul can't win it's like a race
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:43.480]  car driver who is half a circuit in front of everybody and he's gaining ground
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.600]  they're going he can't win he can't win they're doing that because they're
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:50.680]  gonna put some spikes up to blow his tires out and they're gonna steal the
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.520]  election from him well then why do I support him if the elections are rigged

[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.200]  jurisdiction over your farms and ranches not just with animal ID premises ID but
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.880]  now they want to come in and make you get commercial drivers licenses and
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:23.240]  training that then puts you under their jurisdiction you sign into it and you
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.080]  wave your rights and now they can drug test you they can they're going to make

[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.400]  drugs anymore never get depressed the virus goes in and changes your brain
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.240]  chemistry and they've got movies out to mainline it like the new planet of the
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:47.000]  apes where the virus they inject you with makes you so smart it rewires your
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.800]  brain oh it's so good you see we're coming to the point where it won't matter
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:56.360]  even if you want to resist well it's vaccines in your food they're coming out
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.800]  where this Bill Gates is pushing so you can't escape it so that's just some of
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.080]  the news and obviously I want to talk about Ron Paul he keeps winning the major
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:09.880]  scientific polls and straw polls in the coveted good crème de la crème holy
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:17.040]  grail ultimate paramount places New Hampshire Iowa and it gets almost no
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:21.800]  media coverage and then this mantra he cannot win he cannot win he cannot win
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.000]  when he's number one number two or number three in all polls going back six
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:33.520]  months he could win he could win he could win and he's warned people he said
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:37.200]  I'm not gonna be able to fix everything because under the Constitution I'm not a
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:42.000]  dictator it's like the it's like the Ring of Sauron even if he was dictator and
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  tried it would create a horrible system even if you try to use use command and
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.720]  control for good it will not work it doesn't work because the people he put
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:55.840]  under him to carry that out would not be upright perfect individuals Ron Paul
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.560]  isn't but he's got a perfect voting record never compromises that is one in a
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:05.560]  million but he said he could expose the Federal Reserve he could get the people
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.200]  behind him and Congress behind him and really try to change things and it could
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.080]  happen and isn't it the way God works that we're right here at this time of
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.280]  total collapse at the hands of the Federal Reserve for 30 plus years he's
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:21.160]  fought them people are finally listening to him everything he's talked about is
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.280]  coming true right as he gets the point of being able to win the presidency the
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.800]  new order train rolls into the station and everything we've talked about is
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.840]  coming true and he's saying do you choose me as the president and the
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:36.560]  government's like he cannot win he cannot win he cannot win ignore him too
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.120]  bad he's winning all the polls or most the polls and straw polls because he
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:46.840]  cannot win he goes to the high-powered CPAC Republican convention that Ronald
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:49.840]  Reagan and others one before becoming president he wins it two years in a row
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:56.960]  Fox dubs in old audio of booing gets caught when he gets up and says
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:02.000]  Republicans are anti-war there's almost a complete standing ovation breaking the
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.080]  illusion that Republicans are all a bunch of idiot warmongers they're scared to
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.640]  death and I heard these local talk shows this morning going in between
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:18.160]  attacking yours truly saying oh he too bad he can't win we like him and every
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:23.040]  caller I sat there for 30 minutes listen to show they probably took 10 calls to
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.560]  call show and every one of them said I love Ron Paul he can win and they said
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:34.160]  no he can't every caller wanted him but they're still pushing the illusion he
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:40.160]  can't win we've got to break this hoax that he can't win so I want to talk
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.080]  about that now now I want to get to your calls and the problem is I went to
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.640]  Jake earlier and then I went to Beth in that short little segment earlier and of
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:53.320]  course callers bring up big giant weighty issues and it's so and I'm gonna go
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:57.520]  back to Beth in a minute but I want to answer her question now it's so and I'll
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:02.680]  give her a counterpoint it's so one-dimensional and it's not Beth she
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:09.000]  said her friend if you just tuned in she wanted to play devil's advocate her
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:16.560]  friend said oh Alex Jones is just promoting gold because his boss Ted
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:24.360]  Anderson is telling him to well a Ted Anderson isn't my boss I am a free
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:30.280]  contract independent who decides to be syndicated through Genesis because I've
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:35.400]  known Ted for 14 15 years and he's never tried to censor me and he's a sponsor
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.840]  of my show that's it okay I think I can run my whole show right here but I like
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.880]  John Harmon that's the run of my show for six years so much that we still take
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.720]  calls from Minnesota because I like to talk to John I like the cheerfulness in
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:52.840]  his voice he's my friend okay I know the phones up right now I could call up and
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:57.880]  in two days rent any satellite system I wanted to and beam into our stations but
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.400]  I'm a loyal person I liked Ted he's a libertarian constitutionalist he's a
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:09.880]  big Ron Paul supporter he's a fellow intellectual traveler to to steal one
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:15.920]  of the commies terms and I only promote what I believe in and and and is my
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.800]  belief in gold and silver been born out to be good I don't know in fact I was
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.760]  correct and when I first started promoting gold it was $260 an ounce I
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:32.920]  keep saying 300 it was 260 11 years ago and silver was about 450 so I keep
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:41.240]  saying silver was $5 and gold was 200 something and I knew that when they
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:45.680]  got rid of Glass-Steagall and all the economist I had on said it would cause
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:50.240]  something worse than fractional reserve banking that it would debase the
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:54.400]  currency fully because now the central banks could issue unlimited fiat
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:58.720]  counterfeit financial instruments it'd be like if I could suddenly write
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.800]  trillion dollar checks and people had to cash them I mean I would suddenly start
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:06.880]  taking over everything but only the insiders can do this and so in every
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.680]  case in history commodities go up I mean has his housing gone up has gasoline
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.080]  gone up as the price of a car gone up as the price of a gallon of milk gone up
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:18.680]  as the price of the tube of toothpaste gone up absolutely as the price of
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:26.560]  education gone up has the price of every commodity gone up and so is gold in a
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:32.400]  bubble that's something we've discussed in detail and most economists I talked
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:39.120]  to who've been right in the past in my own research say that $2,500 it could be
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:45.680]  a bubble but that's at current devaluation if they keep devaluing and
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:51.080]  you're denominating golden dollars ten thousand dollar I mean in in Weimar
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:58.800]  Republic a loaf of bread wasn't really ten million Deutsch marks I mean ten
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.240]  million Deutsch marks just a decade before would would would buy entire
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:09.680]  towns ten years later it couldn't buy a loaf of bread so it sounds crazy to say
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.360]  ten thousand dollar an ounce gold how about million dollar ounce how about ten
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.520]  million dollar ounce I mean if they if they reduce it down to nothing I'm not
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:23.840]  predicting it's gonna go that far but people are like it's a bubble at 500
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:31.680]  it's a bubble at 800 it's a bubble at 900 a thousand 1200 1500 1800 no it's not
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.600]  for inflation a couple years ago should be $2,500 an ounce right now right now
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:45.960]  right up at 3,000 for 1980 inflation index and so it is such mindlessness such
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:55.720]  incredible folly that I have gone to family events and had distant family
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:59.640]  well not not even so-called distant but but but not real close family people that
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:05.520]  know me well I see like every three years and they're like I'm like hey I told
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:08.800]  you gold at 300 was gonna go up it's it's like 800 now are you gonna buy this
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:13.200]  is like three or four years ago they're like no man it's a bubble how you go
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:17.640]  people I'm in the stock market I'm like okay see him a couple years later hey
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:22.200]  it's it's a 1200 right now a silver's you know way up are you gonna buy any of
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.600]  that no and I said well listen I recommend you do and I literally had
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:34.600]  family two of them laugh at me and go you recommend I'm just you know can be
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:42.200]  completely right to see they watch it CNBC they watch fancy experts and see
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:47.720]  they can laugh it's like that Alex Jones he's not promoting gold and silver
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:54.160]  because he's been completely right and silver's up eight times and and gold's
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.680]  up what seven almost eight times best investment bar none of the decade this
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.320]  guy's been completely right it's like this this crazy guy called every NFL game
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:10.280]  a year out exactly to the score man he's a cook he's on record calling the games
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:16.760]  exactly as they happen what it is credit it's scumbag he said they bankrupt the

[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:27.000]  here it is at Newsweek ten years after he said it this guy's a nut listen this
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.400]  scumbag Alex Jones said buy silver at $4.50 an ounce and now it's up at 40
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:39.480]  man this guy's bad news man it's that Ted Anderson he's the one behind it all
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:44.840]  Alex Jones is a follower Ted Anderson at night flies down here in a helicopter
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:50.400]  and slaps me around and I crawl on the ground and he bosses me and he tells me
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.440]  he says Jones you don't want to promote gold but I say you are and I'm like no I
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:58.200]  don't want to give him that advice it's up eight times 10 stop abusing the

[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:30.440]  advocate story but she she hung up continuing here when I'm going to Steve
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:36.200]  Marie Valerie John and others you know you can play devil's advocate all day
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:40.920]  long but when you've studied history you notice that historically tyrants
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:46.800]  always have a official reason they're doing something but does it ever turn
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:50.320]  out the way they say it is no it gets worse government gets bigger every
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:58.200]  solution they've got things get more and more dire as I keep saying I'm very
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:06.280]  upset gold has gone above 1800 this week I'm very upset because that means

[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:17.200]  ten years ago because I wouldn't stop saying 9-11 was an inside job I'm not
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.600]  just here to make money oh I want to be successful and strong and build my
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:24.120]  operation and be comfortable but that's not what I'm looking for that's not
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:30.680]  truth is what I'm after now if I can make money telling people what I believe
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.720]  the truth and what I'm personally doing you better believe I'm gonna do it
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:38.400]  how do you think we built this operation why can the news have all their
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.760]  sponsors and all the stuff they're pitching but then it's always evil when
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:46.960]  Alex Jones sells a book or a or an info wars.com camo baseball cap by the way
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:51.360]  quite handsome available at info wars.com that's always a co-intel pro
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:55.480]  response and answer now does that mean your friend is a co-intel pro
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:00.360]  response or answer no it just means they feel like idiots that they didn't buy
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:06.400]  gold when it was 300 or 500 or a thousand or 1500 look at that ten year
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:10.320]  graph if you're a prison planet dog TV viewer or go go to a website type in
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.000]  ten year graph you can go back and find videos I did two years ago saying that
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.680]  once it hit 1500 it go parabolic and look at it it's now parabolic you know
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:26.400]  what that means straight up straight up because America is going straight down
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:30.400]  people are like be positive don't destroy confidence I'm not the one
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:34.000]  destroying confidence the megabanks are they want to gut this country to
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.800]  consolidate it
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.400]  this is probably why I don't take calls a lot because when I do take them and
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.440]  somebody gets me going on a subject it gets me angry
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:54.720]  ah let's talk to Steven New York to Marie Valerie John Mark and everybody go

[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:43.040]  and listened instead of just hear you she would have been able to have that
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:47.120]  argument I don't think Beth is bad she got laughed at by one of her screwball
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:52.000]  friends listen listen no if that guy have her friend listened he isn't gonna

[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:03.520]  these people will always twist things around in their minds
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:06.720]  because they're chicken-neck followers I went
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:09.200]  something I only do a few times a year I don't know four or five times a year I
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.360]  went to the mall last night because my children wanted to go to the Lego shop
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:17.920]  we like Lego games and I mean and myself included
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:22.160]  but they everybody look like brain dead zombies they look totally
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:29.760]  spiritless rudderless soulless lost all of the clerks treat everybody
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:35.680]  like like garbage they would demand ID I went and bought a water in a place and
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:38.880]  a manager ran out and tried to imply we'd stolen it
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.600]  I'm gonna come back to you I'm gonna come I want to see what you originally
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:45.360]  called in about Steve and I promise I'm gonna shut up

[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:05.920]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:09.120]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:13.120]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.320]  Americans at home I've turned a tremendous influence
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:20.320]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:25.520]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention

[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:20.320]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:24.000]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.960]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:30.800]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:34.000]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.440]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:40.800]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:43.680]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:14.720]  what do you think of the government proposing they'll be saying
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:17.760]  there's a comment period and then we're gonna do whatever we want
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.360]  kind of like the super congress um six members of the house and senate
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.320]  respectively 12 total with the president
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:28.880]  we're going to develop the new spending legislation and the cut
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:32.400]  legislation and the taxing legislation which is
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:35.600]  basically all of congress at the end of the day it's all about funding
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.640]  and then we're going to propose it to congress for an up or down vote and if
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:41.200]  you don't agree with us we'll just do whatever we want
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.320]  oh we're going to have a commercial driver's license with all the

[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:52.320]  no matter how great or small that has a motor in it
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:57.360]  or moving parts in it and uh it's a federal power grab outside their
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.760]  jurisdiction it's hellish what they do to truck
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:02.480]  drivers it's only targeting small farms and ranches
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:06.400]  it's part of the animal id premises id
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:11.280]  and i'll guarantee you there there's going to be devil's advocate morons out
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.080]  there that are going to say well there might be some dangerous
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:17.360]  farm equipment in the feds care about us

[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:20.880]  areas to see if they could get away with it and they did a big test
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:25.120]  a big drill to see if the military would take the guns and in almost all cases
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:28.480]  they did and they would go knock on the door somebody to open it up even in the
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.840]  wealthiest area they targeted the wealthiest to set that
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:34.080]  precedent because they can do it to them they can do it to anybody

[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:40.000]  welcome hi alex i'm listening to you all day
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.560]  my kids can attest to that anyway um i used to live in california
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:50.000]  and um i my dad he always had farm equipment around our place he always
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.240]  had al-qaeda equipment and i learned you know when i was 12
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:57.760]  years old how to drive a little four tractor to clean out our horse pens
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:02.560]  anyway this makes me sick but anyway uh what i wanted to get into
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:05.920]  really quickly is uh they always called me the ideal lady and when i lived in
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.800]  california and i moved up to alaska to get away from california
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:12.800]  because you know i ended up we ended up uh with the
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:16.800]  uh the enforcement team down there they're always coming on our place you
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:20.560]  know uh trying to give us the you know these

[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:27.520]  we just got tired of it and ended up going to alaska but anyway
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.680]  um it cost us thousands of dollars down there and we said forget it let's leave
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:35.040]  um so we came up here where there's a lot more freedom
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:39.600]  but what i wanted to get into uh is uh four years ago when i
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.600]  found your show uh i decided to do something i've known about the new

[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:07.440]  hi alex uh i'm a longtime fan i've been listening for at least five years uh
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:11.680]  this is my second time calling in and i have just three questions to ask you
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:14.960]  number one is i hear you speaking a lot about derivatives and i don't really
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:18.160]  have a strong understanding as to what they are can you give a short answer as
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:22.480]  to what they are yes well there's a whole different
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:27.040]  classes credit default swaps you name it but they basically
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:33.040]  create pools of mortgages and then uh invest on the overall outcome of
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:36.480]  those deals then they put fake mortgages into those
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:40.800]  uh or or or have part of a mortgage and then claim they own the rest of it
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:44.960]  and then they sell insurance on it and then they trade that insurance as if
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:48.880]  it's another financial instrument we cover it all and fall the republic
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:55.520]  and obama deception uh banks
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:01.120]  create bonds i mean there's all sorts of different ones but basically uh it's
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:04.720]  junk bonds that have no value
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.680]  i got another question for you the people that push the carbon taxes
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:12.960]  what do they what do they say they're going to do with the money to improve
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:16.320]  the environment and what will they actually really be doing with the money
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:20.000]  nothing in fact it's not even really about the tax uh the power to tax the
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.840]  power to destroy i mean that's part of it but the biggest part is the
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:28.560]  regulators decide who to enforce on and they don't even care now they just
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.320]  give all the insiders waivers and then you don't get a waiver
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:36.720]  and then you can't compete because the people that get the waivers can bring
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:41.200]  the product to people 20 30 40 cheaper
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:45.040]  it's all about inside baseball the big mega banks move
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:48.320]  finance factories in china with fortune 100
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:51.680]  they they get tax incentives written to where they don't they get paid
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:55.920]  to move to china but then if your small company wants to go move to china
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:59.760]  you're not going to be allowed in or if you try to operate here you're under
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.680]  all these regulations that the big corporations that move to china
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:08.880]  lobby to get passed to shut you down so you can't compete
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:13.200]  yeah that's a real bummer there huh yeah that's the new world order that's
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:16.800]  globalism that's that's al gore saying this is a good deal
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:22.240]  larry on larry king live in in 94 saying how great nafta and gat would be
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:25.760]  who was right giant sucking sound it happened you think you've been hurt
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:30.880]  so far we've seen nothing they're gonna assault every business every farm
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:36.960]  every ranch every restaurant every car dealership that is not a big heavy
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:41.200]  okay this is why the founders finally said i'm just ready to die
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:46.480]  then live like this read the declaration of independence all the same bull
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:52.880]  they tried for decades to be left alone they tried every avenue
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.480]  let's go to zekiel who's a farmer in kentucky
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:01.520]  that would be called a terrorist in kentucky uh go ahead sir
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:05.200]  hey i want to talk real quick uh about the kentucky's
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:10.240]  wick and food stamp program uh because i have you know unfortunately in the bad
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:13.120]  situation where i have to apply and use that stuff but
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:17.360]  um you can buy junk food and preservative written tv dinners with
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:20.720]  food systems but you can't buy organic milk and cheese and other
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:23.840]  organic products then they're not part of the big corporate morgue
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:27.520]  absolutely not the state wants the poor to be sick
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.800]  sticking unhealthy because they profit offer and that's why health food is so
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:35.040]  expensive i'm sick of it hey let me ask you this is zekiel are you
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:39.040]  how's it going to be when you've got feds coming on the land you're farming
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:42.720]  and inspecting and harassing everything i guess they're jurisdictions
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:47.280]  everywhere now of course it's going on in kentucky
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:51.520]  i grew up on a farm but we lost our farm and i had to live in an apartment now
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:55.520]  but i still work on a farm and i hear about it all the time
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:58.800]  oh but you're a dirty american you you're not willing to work on a farm
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:02.160]  that's why we got to have 30 million illegals to undercut all the
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:07.120]  wages because you're too lazy i hear this every day it's a bunch of bull
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:10.880]  yeah and it's you know being seasoned i have to collect unemployment so i
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:13.840]  guess and by the way there the feds are announcing that they're looking at the
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:18.080]  irish model of if you get any assistance even though you're working
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:22.080]  and and can't survive without the the the soup line that's what is a digital
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:26.080]  soup line and it don't feel bad it's happened to you know
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:31.600]  you name it you're gonna be forced to take inoculations and your children if
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:34.880]  you want the food see that's it's all about bankrupting
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:38.480]  all about using the third world to leverage us out the prison labor
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:42.080]  millions working for 25 cents an hour or less is slave labor
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:46.000]  that's to drive down wages to bankrupt you into government control
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.320]  but chinese slave labor the taxes on top of businesses so even if you try to
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:53.760]  compete you can't just every angle total global

[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:05.680]  successful in fighting the animal id and premise id by one vote
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:09.920]  one vote it it went down uh when they try to push it down from the feds to
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:12.800]  state uh main fought back and main is fighting back
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:18.080]  also with the local food ordinance that some of the towns up here have adopted
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:21.120]  saying that the small local farmer and the consumer
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:24.800]  have a right to free contract and no government official state or federal
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:27.200]  has the right to intervene in that contract so
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:30.560]  we're starting to try to push things back the other way good i love you and
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:34.480]  i'm aware of that texas was the only state before it was even long
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:39.360]  to worshipfully implement uh the real id premise society
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.200]  that literally hands your property over to the feds no rights no nothing
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:48.320]  texas was like our legislature was like we love it give it to us
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:51.760]  because we're to see we're texas and we were cowboy at so
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:55.440]  there ain't no tyranny so we'll just accept it

[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:16.080]  and i had to come to my door and i've run them off and i went and talked to the
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:20.400]  sheriff and he said they would arrest them and so two came
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:25.280]  and i blocked them in and had been i didn't point anything at them but i had
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:29.840]  a gun on me and i had them arrested good
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:34.560]  uh i went to court and the judge would not hear my side or their side he gave
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:37.680]  him a hundred dollar fine and that was it he wouldn't even talk about it but he
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:41.280]  did give him a fine well you've got to do that they're they're trespassing
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:44.640]  they're lying and saying you've got to fill out all those questions
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:48.000]  when all they can do under law is ask young people live there and it's
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.680]  sometimes they force their way into homes so they're a bunch of mindless
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:54.640]  criminals even if they don't consciously know it
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:57.280]  and you did the right thing that's what i tell them i tell them get off my

[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:49.360]  talk about everybody laughs even if you videotape it
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:52.560]  and sometimes i'll even drop a fire bomb on your house there's been a lot of
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:55.520]  famous cases of that a lot of times they use
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:57.760]  people said oh there was a fire at your house
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:00.560]  and people see the black helicopter they even done it in los angeles they'll
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:03.280]  pull right up drop a fire bomb down your chimney or
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:06.720]  right on top of your air conditioner and fly off
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:10.720]  i'm not trying to scare people these are terrorist now it isn't your regular
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:14.080]  military they're flying the dark green ones but they have and fema has under
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:16.400]  north com in fact we have that article ready from the
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:20.320]  daily mail i want to put that up on screen the daily mail talked
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:23.920]  about something that in fact printed for me i forgot to print it
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:29.200]  revealed how the u.s would deal with uk style riots by sending the army to
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:32.960]  areas with large numbers of minority groups and that's how they're selling
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:36.480]  it to the public oh it's for the minorities and they actually linked to
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:40.880]  another u.s newspaper in there that breaks it down in fact print that other
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:43.840]  link too as well and then if you scroll down
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:48.320]  they give the disinformation that well it's in the constitution
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:51.280]  under
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:56.560]  different sections that the regular army deals with insurrection know the
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:00.720]  militia of the county and the state does called out by the governor but see
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:04.400]  now the national guard has been federalized and then lower in the
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:10.080]  article it shows a map of north com
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:14.880]  and that's a public map and and they've got links to u.s newspapers admitting
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:19.520]  yes north com has military officers over every area of the u.s
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:23.600]  it's under the ten regions of fema and i'm in region six
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:29.360]  as you can see there on the map and under that system the military through the
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:32.480]  threat fusion centers takes over the entire society
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:35.760]  and they're not coming with food and water they're coming for your firearms
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:40.000]  aka Katrina and other areas of the country and we've confirmed the military
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.400]  is training in every state of the union
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:45.680]  for to lock down and cordon and blockade cities
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:49.520]  and order the firearms turned in
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:53.520]  and if they think they're going to get away with it they will pull it does that
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:57.840]  mean the average military person's bad no but they they've shown they will
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:01.440]  follow orders we learned later and the feds kept us quiet that quite a few
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:05.200]  units refused in new orleans but but many of the units went
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:08.080]  ahead with it and almost all the police agreed
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:12.240]  they brought police in from all over the country under fbi and fema command
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:15.040]  so the military was under fbi and fema command
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:19.120]  and the military and the the fbi guys reportedly loved it dressing up in black
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:22.240]  outfits and driving around in big flatback trucks and they left the
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:25.360]  rioters and looters and new orleans cops looting
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:28.960]  they had an enjoyable time anybody trying to get out of the city was peaceful
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:32.880]  was shot of course cops were later convicted of that under orders
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:36.640]  no notice they'll burn you for following orders later
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:39.760]  but i digress now we're going to print that article i'm going to cover it more
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:42.880]  later but uh i wanted bob chappan to be able to
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:47.760]  comment on what roger was just saying uh so roger finishing your story
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:51.280]  the census folks kept harassing you coming on your private property
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:55.280]  um they buffalo folks there there's no federal law you got to fill out 50
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:57.840]  question forms it's called the fifth amendment so the
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:00.960]  sheriff the second time had him arrested and so you got a little black
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:04.240]  helicopter visit and you said it was close enough that
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:08.080]  gravel was hitting you in the face and that they had a machine gun on you and
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:11.840]  flipped you off correct i flipped them all first because the
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:15.440]  gravel was was really pelting me i mean they was
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:20.080]  they was down below the tree line i mean just i would say within 50 foot
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:23.520]  now you said you're a disabled you know retired marine farmer who owns this
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:25.760]  property that's scum of the earth according to the
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:31.040]  communists that run our country the banker run commies uh was it totally
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:36.000]  black or was it dark green and what service did the personnel look like
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:39.360]  uh they was black and they had they had uh black
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:42.880]  uniforms on that's all i can tell you there was no markings whatsoever that's
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:46.800]  one thing wow you got an actual fema helicopter visit
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:49.840]  because north com it's still military they're just unmarked
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:55.280]  uh wow you got an actual fema scum visit i really jumped on the sheriff about
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:13:00.160]  because i know that ever uh helicopter airplane or anything is supposed to
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:04.320]  have markings on have numbers and there was none on this one
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:07.920]  but uh what i want to interject on this i don't know about other parts of the
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:12.000]  country but even there's uh all around my
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.840]  neighbors my friends everybody i know that lives in this county and i don't
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:18.800]  want to give away too much i just feel like this we're getting
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:23.520]  prepared but uh like last year after all the hunting
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:26.560]  seasons was over and everything i got to notice and i would i'll be out
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:32.400]  splitting wood in the afternoon for the night and i would hear a rifle fire
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:35.520]  and you and you know i've been in combat i know what
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:38.800]  watch what and it was coming from different directions and
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:41.520]  where i hear where i live you can live you can hear
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:46.080]  two three miles away and i know that there's other people
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:50.800]  getting prepared too but uh we're not experiencing all the stuff
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:54.240]  everybody else is i maybe it's cause we're real rule
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:57.840]  but there is a lot of people who they won't say much
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:00.800]  but they all know what's going on and they're all getting ready
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:05.520]  so when they start trying to come and take our track trackers and stuff i'm
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:10.240]  afraid it's like the old that song is uh i'm not as
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:13.040]  good as i once was but i'm as good once as
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:16.720]  ever was so you know they when they come around
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:19.920]  here i'm afraid they're going to have problems
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:23.920]  well absolutely and that's that's what it's coming down to and that's why
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:28.480]  they're getting everybody ready that anybody who resists being enslaved as
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:31.280]  a terrorist the truth is they are the terrorist
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:35.520]  they created the al-qaeda threat to brand terrorism as a pretext to take
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:39.200]  rights now they're flipping it on to the farmers the people buying
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:42.880]  mre's the returning veterans and they are the terrorist and it's
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:46.960]  that simple and we either expose that or they win
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:50.160]  and this is the takedown of america internally
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:53.360]  they're going to get it all lined up and bring in an al gore support and rick
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:57.200]  perry or a socialist mint romney uh and a lot of
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:00.960]  conservatives are going to lay down to it but we've got to understand they own
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:04.880]  both parties at the top they don't own ron paul that's why they say he can't
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:08.640]  win even though he's winning all the big straw polls thank you so much roger
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:14.000]  i wanted you to hear that bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.200]  because you've been 50 years in this fight and what do you make of the
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:21.840]  announcements that the feds riding lawnmowers uh tractors
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:26.560]  um federal uh transportation uh driver's license to get that
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:31.680]  logs drug test inspections uh confiscations of any equipment that
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:35.760]  don't uh aren't up to their specs i mean the you talk about
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:39.920]  absolute harassment being turned loose on us
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:46.000]  and that's true and uh they finally got around to it uh they've been wanting
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:51.040]  to do that for many years uh previously they
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:56.000]  usually didn't go to people's homes uh they tried to
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:02.800]  uh find out all about them and uh then find out where they lived
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:06.880]  and sometimes they try to uh plant incriminating
[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:12.960]  incriminating evidence but you know that was 20 30 40 years ago and
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:17.600]  today they're right in your face and a good example of what the gentleman had
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:23.360]  to say is the good example i talked to
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:28.400]  someone who's retiring uh from a police department
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:33.280]  and i told him where he should go to look for job
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:39.200]  and uh and and how that's doable for him and then he told me about
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:42.640]  someone else who had just retired who had been
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:50.000]  recruited by a private contractor who is working for the United States
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:55.360]  government under that contract and they're training people
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:00.080]  for people in crowd control and suppressing people in their own
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:06.000]  communities and things like that and so
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:10.640]  that conversation is just two days old so the government
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:18.400]  is definitely getting ready to do some pretty nasty things
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:21.680]  the best thing you can do is try to stay
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:27.280]  out of harm's way try not to get involved this gentleman who's just on
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:33.360]  he didn't have much choice and he didn't go looking for it
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:38.400]  quite frankly i used to go looking for it uh until they threatened me
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:42.160]  and and i i knew they were serious because
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:46.160]  the people who knew them uh told me they were serious
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:50.320]  and uh and so you you you've got to be cool
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:55.280]  uh prepare yourself uh more heavily than you would normally
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:59.680]  it's hard living in a rural area but there's not many people around
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:03.440]  okay you're pretty isolated and they bring a couple of helicopters and with
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:09.360]  m60s and they unload uh 15 or 20 people
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:13.120]  uh you're not going to have much of a chance
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:16.880]  and so uh it's hard being out on those areas
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:21.440]  i think too that uh and you probably have already done this
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:28.400]  talk to your friends and neighbors and try to coordinate things i have two way
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:33.600]  radios and uh well bob here's the deal if
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:37.120]  they attack the hundred plus million gun owners
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:39.760]  and one percent fight back that's a million people
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:43.360]  and you know once they start doing more and more of this people are going to be
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:48.240]  waiting and it's actually a very defendable position
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:50.960]  if you don't care what ends up happening at the end of the day
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:54.480]  to defend yourself when you're being assaulted by globalist forces
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:58.720]  i mean look at the force multiplier of the individual and plus if things go
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:03.280]  into that zone you don't just sit there and wait for them
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:09.440]  you can go look for them but you'll have to have a helicopter to do it
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:15.520]  but i say be sure you get plenty of clips and ammo they
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:20.400]  don't last long in a firefight and the man who was just on knows that he's
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:24.080]  been there and he's done that so uh just have plenty of
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:27.200]  plenty of firepower and make sure everybody
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:32.640]  in the home fires as good as you do but it's going to get a lot worse
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:35.840]  uh you know why would government be giving
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:42.800]  private contractors uh money to go out and find people who have
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:46.560]  been somewhat trained and this sort of thing
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:51.360]  uh to go into areas where they're told to to
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:55.280]  break up right demonstrations or go to people's homes or whatever they're
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:58.400]  going to do now they're setting up their sacred police
[02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:01.200]  and it's not going to be as easy as the scum thinks it is we'll be right back

[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:35.840]  there's one thing everybody's got to understand here the system wants you
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:38.960]  dependent they want you bankrupt on welfare
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:43.200]  in the criminal justice system if you're getting out of the military you're
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:46.000]  the number one threat they absolutely hate your guts
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.800]  because they've trained you to carry out their criminal activity
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:54.160]  they know you've got skills and that you're now awake or could awaken
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:57.840]  and that's why earlier i showed you the news article
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:01.920]  where when you go into an army navy store
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:09.840]  to buy mres they say that if you criticize the government
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:14.960]  or you say you're a survivalist to call the police on
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:21.200]  they say if you're buying night vision weatherized ammunition that's how a lot
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:27.440]  of it sold is in those cases that you're it says require a valid
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:31.840]  id this is happening everywhere you can buy milk and they'll ask for an id now
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:36.960]  it's all about getting you ready for the cashless society global vat tax
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:39.840]  now again you have to understand about the military
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:43.840]  and the contractors and there's now a million plus private contractors in the
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:49.440]  u.s in domestic intelligence they sift through all the
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:52.560]  military and police and find the psychopaths
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:56.800]  find the control freaks find the criminals just like scowling did
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:00.000]  and the people on those female helicopters and part of this shadow
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.880]  government system that's now more and more public they are
[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:06.240]  chosen because they hate america and hate freedom
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:10.960]  they work for the bankers they are literally the equivalent of the nkvd
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:14.320]  that alexander silson eats and talked about bob chatting your take on that
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:19.120]  statement do you agree with that absolutely they do select those
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:22.960]  kind of people and most of them are criminals
[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:27.920]  they may not be convicted criminals but the criminal types will call them
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:34.320]  and the average military person and the average law enforcement person is not
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:39.040]  like that i mean you always find a few that get through
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:46.400]  maybe a small percentage but these people are vicious animals
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:50.880]  and you want to make sure once it starts that
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:53.680]  nobody it makes it through and on the other side
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:57.680]  well look we hope nothing even comes to this but the but we saw waco we've seen
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:02.240]  other issues the point here at the end of the day is
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:06.560]  that people better choose a side folks you know the government's been hijacked
[02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:10.080]  by foreign banks everything bob and i and others have talked about has now
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:12.320]  come true are you ready for the rest of it to come
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:16.640]  true there is no way out of this that's easy
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:20.320]  you are not going to grovel and get along with this you know this attitude
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:23.600]  bob of yuppies and establishment types they just think
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:28.640]  as long as they rationalize things and mentally decide to join this
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:32.720]  by just being passive that that gives them power over it
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:37.360]  what would you say to people like that who haven't really studied history
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:43.040]  well if you take a look at what the germans did under the national socialist party
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:46.960]  and if you look at what stalin did you'll find that all
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:50.000]  those who were complicit with them at the beginning
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:55.520]  were eliminated and a good example with the brown shirts in germany
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:00.720]  they went in one night and killed most of them but it's more than that
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:02.960]  a lot of people aren't even going to join them they're just going to make
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:06.480]  excuses for it and and think magically that well i've done
[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:10.400]  nothing i licked boots why are you taking my farm why are you taking my
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:14.240]  house why are you taking my business why are you arresting me
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:17.920]  in fact i've noticed the globalist target bootlickers
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:21.200]  more than they even target those of us that fight them bob i mean i've been
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:24.480]  targeted you've been targeted a lot of stuff's going on but
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:30.560]  have you not noticed that that the globalist almost enjoy eating their own
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:35.600]  uh yes and just recently they didn't get into that some years ago
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:38.880]  but this is something that they have been doing
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:43.360]  and i've talked to people in the military and
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:48.000]  uh it's very difficult for them to talk to one another because
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.680]  you don't know who's been planted in your unit
[02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:56.400]  that's another thing i mean were the people who
[02:28:56.400 --> 02:29:03.600]  supposedly in cl team six were they talking to
[02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:08.320]  other people in their unit or another unit that
[02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:12.320]  it really didn't happen or something like that
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:15.840]  and did the government have one of their own
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:20.880]  seals in there spying on them well of course they do those are some of the
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:24.880]  most heavily surveilled people out there in fact i've got some breaking
[02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:28.320]  shield team six news uh briefly on the other side and then
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:31.360]  bob i want to take a few farmer calls that are holding and then get into the
[02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:35.280]  big events of the week and the economy and what the signals man i know for us

[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:32.320]  it's not about the government's coming in to start harassing the farmers and
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:36.000]  make them get commercial licenses and the drug testing and the inspections
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:39.120]  that come with it way outside their jurisdiction
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:42.800]  we've been exposed as reptilians bob
[02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:46.560]  well i i think they better check with the royal families in europe because
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:50.960]  david like says they're reptilians and we're probably
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:53.840]  related to them and i don't like that very much
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:58.320]  chapman you're something else seriously though what about the federal power grab
[02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:00.640]  here of saying they're going to come on farms and
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:03.280]  ranches you know with the state under their
[02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:09.360]  auspices uh and and start harassing all the farm equipment
[02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:13.520]  i think it's what do they expect to be able to
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:17.600]  prove other than try to intimidate well no i mean you're going to go get a
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:19.840]  license and pay them money and waive your rights
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:24.240]  and they're going to come out and harass you the truck police at your farm
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:30.160]  i see well uh have you your farm equipment
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:34.400]  equipment and good working order no i'm not going to do it

[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:52.160]  uh inspections of logs maintenance logs and then they come out on my property
[02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:55.280]  without a warrant because i've waived my rights do you realize the magnitude of
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:37:00.720]  this bob it is very very big and it's part of
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:06.640]  that uh id system that they want to put in that's been held up on my driver's
[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:11.440]  licenses well they've got the animal id premises id it's all written by big agra
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:15.280]  let's talk to freedom in texas freedom you're on the air you're a farmer
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:21.520]  yeah for one uh alex of the local water company was replaced
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:28.480]  by a huge multi-state sodium fluoride poison pushing thugopoly southwest
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:34.160]  water company flagrantly heavily dose us all with toxic
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:40.080]  sludge the sodium fluoride in our water killing my crops killing my pets
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:43.680]  killing all of us well they're good globalist and
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:47.200]  yeah they come in under federal regulations so you've got to upgrade
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:50.640]  your local water facility because it's not good enough for the people
[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:54.160]  most of the multinationals are out of europe and they do come in and literally
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:58.720]  dump hundreds of toxic waste chemicals in your water including uranium
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:01.680]  and i've seen the farmers all over the country there'll be a drought they'll
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:05.360]  have to switch for their horses and cows to tap water and they all die within a
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:08.480]  month i mean no wonder the public looks like mutated
[02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:13.440]  you know gray-skinned creatures we're being chemically murdered

[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:51.440]  that you know things are are financially bad and this is a way that the
[02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:54.720]  government can come in and make money and use
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:59.680]  spear and intimidation tactics against us um we had an interesting
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:03.760]  situation happened about two months ago i had
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:06.720]  looked outside our window we lived down a very desolate gravel road in the
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:10.400]  middle of nowhere and there was a car and i thought it was quite odd it was
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:14.960]  just sitting alongside the road and it sat there for a very long time at
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:18.560]  there's three people that live on the road and it sat up at my neighbors
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:21.840]  and then it came down the road and it didn't sit at my house but then it sat
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:25.840]  up at his grandma's house for a while and about a half an hour later i got
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:28.240]  ready to leave i'm driving down the gravel road
[02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:31.600]  come to stop sign and the car's still sitting there
[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:35.600]  and so i stop and i roll my window down and it's just really sweet
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:40.240]  70 year old woman sitting in the car and i said ma'am is everything okay
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:43.360]  and she goes yeah i'm just driving around making notes
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:47.760]  taking down people's addresses and i thought that was a really
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:52.960]  really odd well they've been coming up in gpsing
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:58.560]  especially rural areas for decades but now uh the census is to be year round
[02:39:58.560 --> 02:40:02.560]  and even monthly and their gps in your door they're talking to your
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:06.000]  neighbors about you and it's just they're using the name of the census
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:09.920]  to put humet on the ground uh we already knew about this three years ago but

[02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:59.280]  you're not going to have a garden without a proper authorization and
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:03.600]  inspection you might grow marijuana and if you grow marijuana that's going to
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:06.320]  cut in on the price of the marijuana they ship in
[02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:10.560]  this is this is corporate takeover i mean they've taken over every industry
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:14.320]  they've taken over talk radio in almost every area
[02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:18.320]  they've taken over the farming the ranching they're taking everything over
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:21.600]  they're taking the family over uh they're coming out in
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:24.560]  lobbying government to make you take more vaccines
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:27.520]  that you know to have brick perry come out and say it's the law your kids have
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:31.600]  got to take shots i appreciate your call any comments on what
[02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:35.520]  daniel was saying uh they're bob german
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:40.000]  no but uh you we've seen the instances of that uh as you pointed out
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:45.120]  with the census and the excuse for these people to be there
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:49.360]  and uh you know if you see people around you know they're up to something
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:54.080]  because people shouldn't be in those areas especially sitting in a vehicle
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:57.040]  you know for some period well i would have said who are you here for and i
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:00.320]  guarantee it would have been the census you see if they quote
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:03.520]  can't get all the data they want they go to your neighbors and again
[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:08.800]  it's all part of hiding in plain view uh what's the name they use in uh scar
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:13.600]  face you want a chivano on every corner watching you telling you what to eat
[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:20.000]  or when to sleep what to wear uh you want to be a sheet
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.960]  i mean that's what we're talking about here i i want to go back to more calls
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:26.880]  from farmers in hawaii texas and christin who never got on yesterday in a
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:31.440]  moment um but but bob just briefly i mean obviously
[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:35.040]  you predicted unfortunately everything that it's happened but just a brief
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:38.320]  synopsis what happened this week with the global meltdown
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:44.160]  accelerating with gold exploding and and where is it going in the future
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:49.120]  well i think the uh in america the state of the changes
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:54.640]  was the intercession by s and p uh downgrading uh the united states
[02:42:54.640 --> 02:43:02.080]  government's uh rating on paper their bonds and this was done
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:05.280]  and the other two rating agencies didn't do that
[02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:09.600]  this was done in order to as far as i can see
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:16.480]  uh chop up the benefits of social security as well as the uh
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:20.720]  as the medicare and of course the other part of what they did
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:24.240]  i had nothing to do with that directly
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:30.000]  but uh they wanted to impose this uh what i call the uh
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:36.560]  obama enabling act uh which is uh bypassing congress but
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:40.400]  those things uh when they happened
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:45.680]  uh caused the markets to become unsound at least on a short term basis and
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:49.920]  they were going up and down five or six hundred points a day
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:53.200]  uh the the market is in the weakened condition
[02:43:53.200 --> 02:44:00.240]  because investors professionals they buy earnings down the road
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:04.160]  six months to a year from now uh generally speaking most of them are
[02:44:04.160 --> 02:44:11.200]  long-term investors and the uh the earnings for
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:14.880]  uh s and p companies are going to go down this
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:19.280]  coming year and during the last half of this year as well
[02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:25.200]  and instead of making uh 13 dollars 130 dollars
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:29.440]  a share they probably make 60 or 70 and that's a big difference
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:33.280]  so fundamentally the market should come down and this thing
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:37.040]  disrupted at the same time of course the
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:40.480]  president's group and financial markets they went in
[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:45.680]  and uh they first attacked silver and then they attacked gold and they
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:50.080]  increased the margin requirements on gold and
[02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:55.120]  that's not so bad because that has a short-term effect and most of the people
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:45:01.360]  who are in the forex markets today and in the comics the lvma
[02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:05.200]  london are pretty big hitters and that's what i was about to say
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:08.800]  they did this four months ago increased margins and it knocked it down for a
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:13.280]  while this time it didn't even really knock it down it just stopped the run
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:17.280]  and it really shows they're running out of bullets and getting desperate
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:21.200]  as the world realizes they're going to devalue the dollar down to basically
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:25.760]  uh nothing uh and uh you know the fact that
[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:30.480]  i think i saw last night the cover to time is is is going to be the end of
[02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:36.800]  europe the collapse of europe uh so uh it's clear that uh
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:40.720]  there's a lot of crazy stuff going on and now now the sec is going to
[02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:43.440]  investigate stan and pours and find out if
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:48.320]  george soros did get that tip so this is getting crazier and crazier bob but
[02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:51.600]  clearly this signifies the fact that they're pretty much
[02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:55.600]  admitting we're in a depression you're right about that
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:45:58.720]  and it's an inflationary depression and has been
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:02.880]  for the last two and a half years uh and that will continue because they've
[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:07.760]  got to do a qe3 type of thing i'm looking for 2.5 billion that
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:12.000]  they'll create in order to keep the system going sideways
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:15.920]  and if they don't do that you know it's a minus five percent of gdp
[02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:19.760]  and that'll feed on itself and then deflation will take over
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:23.360]  and they don't want that and they're not near that now because they're
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:27.680]  smothering it and have for 11 years okay real briefly where's gold going
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:31.520]  where's gold going it's gonna it's gonna bottom out in here
[02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:35.200]  probably early next week and that'll be the end of the correction and it's good
[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:39.920]  because it went up pretty fast it's it's uh come back it'll
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:45.520]  settle in and it'll move towards 2000 and it could hit it in september
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:48.800]  and maybe even sooner for all we know what do you make a jp morgan saying
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:53.520]  2500 by the end of the year yeah well let me tell you my
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:56.160]  take on that i've been doing this a long time
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:47:00.960]  and i know how they have their minds work the jpm didn't want to come out with
[02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:03.920]  that but they had to and i'll tell you why
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:08.640]  because they know gold is going higher soon they said by the end of the year
[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:12.960]  i say by the end of february because that's usually the end of the big season
[02:47:12.960 --> 02:47:17.840]  and gold on the plus side and what they're doing here
[02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:22.560]  is setting up a blocker they want everybody to think gold's going to 2500
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:27.040]  but isn't going any higher because they know it's going higher
[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:30.400]  so they want to stop it cut it off at the pass so to speak
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:34.560]  so that's their thinking in that it's good for us
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:37.920]  because they've admitted they know what gold is going
[02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:41.680]  uh now we're going to tell them we know what you're doing and it's going to
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:45.600]  3000 300 by the end of the year or by the end of
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:49.120]  february and silver will go right with it
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:53.200]  and they're buried in silver and they can't get out
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:56.800]  and by that they made a lot of naked shorts and things to try to keep it down
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:01.280]  and this really is debacle and it exposes their fiat currency
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:04.240]  and it's global devaluation let's go to christine
[02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:07.680]  in arizona christine thank you for holding your on the air with bob
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:14.400]  shatman hi um i have a deeply disturbing
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:17.680]  question i don't know if you've seen it i don't know
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:23.520]  why it hasn't been posted but obama went is uh going to the congress to ask
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:28.960]  them to suspend a banking law to allow them to lease
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:33.840]  directly to tenants now i don't know man i have seen the articles and i
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:37.200]  mentioned it he first floated a month ago and then again last week but you're
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:40.080]  right in fact i should have covered this uh
[02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:46.240]  absolutely so so now it all gets pulled the bankers get everything paid
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:49.920]  but but now you live for the government it's basically
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:54.000]  millions more americans going on a weird form of government housing and federal
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.720]  courts have ruled you don't have any fourth amendment rights
[02:48:56.720 --> 02:49:00.800]  when you live in government housing yes the that is big news
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:04.880]  well the the problem is is if you were a banker which would you rather do
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:07.680]  would you rather lease to somebody or would you rather
[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:11.040]  loan and take a chance on the loan going down i mean
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:14.960]  if this goes through it'll never come back
[02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:20.960]  we're now where we were in the days of serfs and lords the real estate
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:25.360]  that's always been the plan that the exact look people keep asking is obama
[02:49:25.360 --> 02:49:28.400]  trying to destroy the free market and the answer is no
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:32.320]  he's a teleprompter reading frontman the mega banks
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:36.080]  that all these conservatives worship all day the big corporations are anti
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:39.760]  free market they're they're buying the republicans as well
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:43.440]  to shut down our economies their criminal scum
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:46.320]  and people better get upset effect there's the new york times
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:49.920]  and yes they're moving now
[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:54.960]  that's la times also saw in the new york times but uh i'm sorry ma'am go ahead
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:49:58.880]  the what there's you know he retooled his article to say
[02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:02.720]  we want to do this because there's so many foreclosed properties out there we
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:07.440]  want to get him rented but the bottom line is once they change that law
[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:12.320]  it'll never get changed back and you you're unless you have well ma'am ma'am
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:15.760]  they've given tens of trillions to foreign banks and the news did report
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:18.160]  a few years ago saying if you'd have given that money
[02:50:18.160 --> 02:50:20.880]  to the people with houses that were upside down it would have paid for all
[02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:24.320]  the houses a hundred percent more again in the name of
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:27.440]  they claim that oh this is happening in the economy because of mortgages
[02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:31.280]  it had nothing to do with it it was the overall derivatives
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:38.640]  and bob chatman comments on that uh yes and um eight years ago
[02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:43.840]  uh i said that uh planning at ready were broke everybody in the beltway knew it
[02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:48.800]  they would go under and the end of what they're trying to do and this is eight
[02:50:48.800 --> 02:50:53.600]  years ago it's a nationalized housing and this is exactly
[02:50:53.600 --> 02:50:58.160]  what that speech was they've already taken over gm and then gave them five
[02:50:58.160 --> 02:51:03.280]  billion to move to china and brazil i mean it's pure treason

[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:23.280]  long i wouldn't be surprised if gold is higher than it was
[02:57:23.280 --> 02:57:26.800]  at its last peak before the end of next week you know that's just the way that
