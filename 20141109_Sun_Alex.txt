[00:00.000 --> 00:06.520]  Well, because of contract disputes, Dish Network has not carried CNN since October the 21st.
[00:06.520 --> 00:12.680]  The day after the election, the Dish Chairman had some amazing words about CNN and not having
[00:12.680 --> 00:15.400]  them for election night coverage.
[00:15.400 --> 00:21.120]  Basically what he said was not having CNN for election night coverage was a non-event.
[00:21.120 --> 00:26.160]  He said CNN being down on election night would have been a disaster 15 or 20 years ago.
[00:26.160 --> 00:29.920]  Now there's plenty of other places for people to get their news, but it got even worse than
[00:29.920 --> 00:30.920]  that.
[00:30.920 --> 00:37.280]  He said 20 years ago CNN was a must-have channel, but it's not even a top 10 network anymore
[00:37.280 --> 00:38.560]  unless they find the plane.
[00:38.560 --> 00:40.560]  You know, the Malaysian plane?
[00:40.560 --> 00:41.560]  Wow.
[00:41.560 --> 00:47.160]  Pointing out just how irrelevant and laughable CNN's wall-to-wall coverage of the missing
[00:47.160 --> 00:48.560]  Malaysian plane was.
[00:48.560 --> 00:52.920]  The network famous for their walls of graphics went a little old school this weekend.
[00:52.920 --> 00:57.960]  They used a toy plane to take its investigation to the next level.
[00:57.960 --> 01:00.040]  And people on Twitter were kind of brutal about it.
[01:00.040 --> 01:02.680]  One person wrote, good job, CNN, a toy plane.
[01:02.680 --> 01:04.680]  That's real journalism right there.
[01:04.680 --> 01:08.040]  This person wrote that CNN has hit a new load.
[01:08.040 --> 01:11.160]  And of course, their loss of credibility.
[01:11.160 --> 01:16.160]  Now some people might just chalk this up as to negotiating strategy or the bad blood between
[01:16.160 --> 01:18.240]  them as they can't renew the contract.
[01:18.240 --> 01:23.800]  But today we saw in Drudge that CNN has fallen even below the Weather Channel.
[01:23.800 --> 01:28.320]  Al Roker tweeted out that his program, wake up with Al Roker on the Weather Channel at
[01:28.320 --> 01:34.320]  six in the morning, beat CNN the week of October the sixth, and during the week of October
[01:34.320 --> 01:39.440]  the 20th, beat MSNBC, CNBC, as well as CNN.
[01:39.440 --> 01:42.480]  Now does he have some kind of a killer program?
[01:42.480 --> 01:43.480]  Not really.
[01:43.480 --> 01:47.560]  It's just that they are in free fall in a death spiral.
[01:47.560 --> 01:49.720]  Now CNN appears to be in denial.
[01:49.720 --> 01:55.880]  According to the dish chairman, he said they're looking for double digit percent increases
[01:55.880 --> 01:59.120]  in price while their viewership is down by half.
[01:59.120 --> 02:03.480]  He said, we know how many minutes people watched CNN and how many minutes they watched five
[02:03.480 --> 02:04.560]  years ago.
[02:04.560 --> 02:08.440]  And it's hard to pay a double digit price increase for something that people are watching
[02:08.440 --> 02:10.040]  half as much.
[02:10.040 --> 02:13.520]  Why aren't people watching CNN for election coverage or other news?
[02:13.520 --> 02:17.880]  Their disappearing credibility is as plain as the disappearing nose on Anderson Cooper's
[02:17.880 --> 02:18.880]  face.
[02:18.880 --> 02:22.480]  Why those weapons should not be out in the general public.
[02:22.480 --> 02:25.680]  It isn't just that they're pretending that they're on location when they aren't.
[02:25.680 --> 02:29.880]  It isn't just that they're pretending bombs are falling and they're in their studio.
[02:29.880 --> 02:33.960]  Boy, that almost looks stupid.
[02:33.960 --> 02:37.520]  Charles Jacob CNN reporting live from Saudi Arabia.
[02:37.520 --> 02:42.920]  They were in Atlanta, Georgia, and that they were not being attacked by scud missiles with
[02:42.920 --> 02:44.240]  Sharon gas.
[02:44.240 --> 02:48.600]  It's also the information, the manipulation that they're putting out there, of course.
[02:48.600 --> 02:53.840]  Their election coverage, just like Fox News' election coverage, in many cases is just one
[02:53.840 --> 02:54.840]  giant push-pull.
[02:54.840 --> 03:00.440]  A pull set up not to find out what you think, but to manipulate what you think.
[03:00.440 --> 03:04.440]  They focus on horse races, but what's really behind that?
[03:04.440 --> 03:06.320]  What difference will it make in our lives?
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.800]  And so our goal has been not to just give you information, but to give you some knowledge
[03:11.800 --> 03:13.360]  about how that fits.
[03:13.360 --> 03:18.000]  Our goal, for example, in the election coverage was to not just give you the information about
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.760]  who won and a horse race aspect of it, but we wanted you to stop and think about how
[03:22.760 --> 03:27.400]  you're being manipulated, by who they allow on the ballot, who they allow in the debates,
[03:27.400 --> 03:31.960]  how the voting machines are working, are not working, are being manipulated, how the counting
[03:31.960 --> 03:33.560]  is being manipulated.
[03:33.560 --> 03:36.000]  We also wanted to look at the shift to the GOP.
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.800]  Is that going to be something for the better, something for the worst?
[03:38.800 --> 03:40.240]  In some cases, it will be better.
[03:40.240 --> 03:43.480]  In some cases, many cases, it will be for the worst.
[03:43.480 --> 03:47.960]  And fundamentally, is it going to be meet the new boss, same as the old boss?
[03:47.960 --> 03:50.760]  In other words, the people who are controlling this at the very top, even though they may
[03:50.760 --> 03:57.200]  have a left-right paradigm, they still have one agenda, a globalist status agenda.
[03:57.200 --> 04:01.520]  We can see that in what the Republicans are already talking and pushing about in terms
[04:01.520 --> 04:03.560]  of a trade partnership agreement.
[04:03.560 --> 04:08.280]  This trade partnership agreement that they have is something that goes far beyond trade.
[04:08.280 --> 04:12.480]  It goes into controlling the Internet, which is, again, where they want to head.
[04:12.480 --> 04:16.760]  This is what they could not get accomplished at the legislative level with SISPA, SOPA,
[04:16.760 --> 04:21.120]  ACTA PIPA, all those different things that have failed in the U.S. and Europe.
[04:21.120 --> 04:23.440]  Now they're going to try to achieve that with these treaties.
[04:23.440 --> 04:28.720]  Well, that's just part of this groundbreaking report that David Knight just filed today.
[04:28.720 --> 04:30.880]  So we just premiered part of it here.
[04:30.880 --> 04:32.600]  We're going to upload it right now to YouTube.
[04:32.600 --> 04:39.040]  So in the next hour, it will be the top story on Infowars.com, the death spiral of CNN.
[04:39.040 --> 04:43.320]  And we'll tie it into the entire media war that's going on, because there is a war on
[04:43.320 --> 04:44.320]  for your mind.
[04:44.320 --> 04:51.400]  It is the ninth day of November, ladies and gentlemen, 2014, on Alex Jones.
[04:51.400 --> 04:56.280]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around
[04:56.280 --> 05:00.960]  the key concepts of superoxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[05:00.960 --> 05:05.800]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxypowder, available through
[05:05.800 --> 05:10.960]  Infowars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[05:10.960 --> 05:16.200]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[05:16.200 --> 05:21.200]  ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives, or worse.
[05:21.200 --> 05:26.360]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[05:26.360 --> 05:30.960]  Oxypowder does not require time off work, and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[05:30.960 --> 05:37.160]  Instead, oxypowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[05:37.160 --> 05:43.960]  With the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology, go to infowarslife.com
[05:43.960 --> 06:10.600]  or infowarsstore.com to get started with oxypowder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[06:10.600 --> 06:17.480]  If you want to stop tyranny, well, so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's
[06:17.480 --> 06:19.480]  Alex Jones.
[06:19.480 --> 06:33.960]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday edition.
[06:33.960 --> 06:40.320]  We'll be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday live, central time 4-6pm
[06:40.320 --> 06:44.680]  and reared on affiliates around the United States and broadcasting worldwide, of course
[06:44.680 --> 06:50.720]  on global shortwave, satellite, and going out over the internet via infowars.com and
[06:50.720 --> 06:56.960]  prisonplanet.com, where you can find all the free audio feeds, video feeds, we also
[06:56.960 --> 07:02.360]  summercast television here, the free podcast, the free iPhone and droid apps, all of it
[07:02.360 --> 07:10.320]  at infowars.com forward slash show or just click on the listen tab to find the complete
[07:10.320 --> 07:11.320]  menu there.
[07:11.320 --> 07:14.360]  First off is a ton of news to cover, we're going to dive into all of it, from the arctic
[07:14.360 --> 07:20.880]  vortex to the fall of the Berlin Wall to the new rollout of the bushes, who've been hiding
[07:20.880 --> 07:24.600]  under a rock now that they think there's a huge ground swell, they're ready to ride
[07:24.600 --> 07:30.080]  in as our saviors with a new dynasty of the old dynasty with Jeb Bush.
[07:30.080 --> 07:35.640]  We're going to be breaking that down, talking about the Tea Party sweeps that we saw coming
[07:35.640 --> 07:41.440]  in last Tuesday with this major political realignment with the Republican establishment
[07:41.440 --> 07:47.960]  wonks on every radio and TV show you can imagine telling you that this was a mandate for establishment,
[07:47.960 --> 07:54.040]  blue blood, country club, Republicans that want your guns and want open borders.
[07:54.040 --> 07:59.440]  The people that wrote Obamacare, no this is not a mandate for you and any real political
[07:59.440 --> 08:01.460]  analysts can tell you that.
[08:01.460 --> 08:07.160]  I got to say it's very pleasing to hear every major syndicated radio show though.
[08:07.160 --> 08:12.380]  This libertarian or conservative pointing out that the drive-by media, the lapdog media
[08:12.380 --> 08:18.480]  has been in league with the Republican leadership to try to demonize and attack the patriot
[08:18.480 --> 08:23.080]  movement that is trying to take over the Republican party and is one of the only major hopes
[08:23.080 --> 08:25.240]  to fix things peacefully in this country.
[08:25.240 --> 08:31.640]  So it's very exciting to see that and then you hear the local shows and the establishment
[08:31.640 --> 08:39.600]  shows and the dying dinosaur television programs on CNN and MSNBC saying this was a repudiation
[08:39.600 --> 08:40.960]  of the Tea Party.
[08:40.960 --> 08:45.160]  They want us to work together, Democrats and Republicans to get more dying.
[08:45.160 --> 08:49.200]  Now we don't want thousands of more laws and bills and new taxes.
[08:49.200 --> 08:52.800]  What we want is things repealed.
[08:52.800 --> 08:58.160]  And if you don't repeal the gun control, the victim disarmament, if you don't repeal
[08:58.160 --> 09:05.760]  the rape care, the death panel care, the rationing care, the foreign banking insurance company,
[09:05.760 --> 09:14.400]  Dream Obamacare, we are going to repeal you, Boehner, you, Mitch McConnell and all of you
[09:14.400 --> 09:19.360]  country club fake Republicans that make me want to throw up.
[09:19.360 --> 09:22.920]  When I say country club Republicans, most folks in a country club are actually awake
[09:22.920 --> 09:24.640]  to what's going on about the New World Order.
[09:24.640 --> 09:29.920]  It's that blue blood term, that Rockefeller Republican term whenever George Herbert Walker
[09:29.920 --> 09:35.440]  Bush was running against Reagan in 1979, he said, oh, I'm not, I'm not like one of these
[09:35.440 --> 09:36.720]  grassroots populist.
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.520]  I'm not like Ronald Reagan.
[09:40.520 --> 09:44.240]  I'm a Rockefeller Republican.
[09:44.240 --> 09:47.680]  He told the Washington Post that, well, here's the deal.
[09:47.680 --> 09:51.960]  We don't want any more of David Rockefeller and global government and carbon taxes and
[09:51.960 --> 09:52.960]  all of it.
[09:52.960 --> 09:57.320]  And the reason we keep losing liberty is because the Democrats are the vanguard of the takeover
[09:57.320 --> 10:00.560]  and the Republican Party plays the part of loyal opposition.
[10:00.560 --> 10:05.720]  It's like a Don King boxing match where he owns both boxers.
[10:05.720 --> 10:12.600]  And it took 20, 30, 40 stage fights for people to stop watching heavyweight boxing run by
[10:12.600 --> 10:13.600]  Don King.
[10:13.600 --> 10:15.800]  And it's crippled the sport.
[10:15.800 --> 10:20.800]  So heavyweight boxing, not just heavyweight, mediumweight, Walter weight, all of it.
[10:20.800 --> 10:22.800]  But it's really crippled it.
[10:22.800 --> 10:23.920]  People won't do the pay-per-views.
[10:23.920 --> 10:27.840]  They don't go to it because they don't want to go watch a play.
[10:27.840 --> 10:30.640]  They don't want to go watch a staged event.
[10:30.640 --> 10:33.000]  They want to go watch two guys really fight.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.160]  They want to go watch the ponies actually race each other, not be staged as well.
[10:39.160 --> 10:41.800]  They want to watch the football players actually play each other.
[10:41.800 --> 10:46.680]  They want to watch the real thing and people can be fooled for a while.
[10:46.680 --> 10:51.240]  You got the who song back from the 70s about meet the new boss, same as the old boss, won't
[10:51.240 --> 10:52.240]  get fooled again.
[10:52.240 --> 10:54.280]  We got to play that song sometime today.
[10:54.280 --> 10:56.960]  We've got it in the bumpers.
[10:56.960 --> 11:00.040]  But over time, that wears out.
[11:00.040 --> 11:03.480]  So people aren't waking up in a few years now to fake politicians.
[11:03.480 --> 11:06.360]  They're waking up in a matter of months.
[11:06.360 --> 11:12.040]  And whether it's the Ministry of Defense, the Pentagon, top economists, top sociologists,
[11:12.040 --> 11:16.880]  top researchers, they're all over the news every day in Bloomberg, in the Financial Times
[11:16.880 --> 11:20.800]  of London, in the Wall Street Journal, which still has propaganda in it.
[11:20.800 --> 11:23.360]  But business people want the skinny.
[11:23.360 --> 11:28.240]  So you'll get a lot more info in there than you'll get, say, from MSNBC or CNN.
[11:28.240 --> 11:32.280]  And all of those analysts sound just like this show 10 years ago.
[11:32.280 --> 11:34.680]  The world's run by private central mega bankers.
[11:34.680 --> 11:38.360]  It's a crony capitalist rigged operation based on fiat money.
[11:38.360 --> 11:39.880]  They get the first use of it.
[11:39.880 --> 11:41.040]  It's discriminatory.
[11:41.040 --> 11:43.160]  They're waging war on the real free market.
[11:43.160 --> 11:46.760]  They're destroying the middle class, the engine of innovation and the engine of liberty.
[11:46.760 --> 11:51.400]  We are going to go into a nightmare police state scenario if we don't reverse this.
[11:51.400 --> 11:54.040]  And I'm not bragging about the statement I'm about to make.
[11:54.040 --> 11:55.040]  It's true.
[11:55.040 --> 11:57.360]  It's the good news.
[11:57.360 --> 12:03.600]  The fact that this broadcast should be approaching on the weekday show 200 affiliates and a lot
[12:03.600 --> 12:05.840]  of these stations are big stations.
[12:05.840 --> 12:10.840]  In fact, in a lot of cities, we're on the mom and pop that picked us up years ago, 10
[12:10.840 --> 12:13.120]  years ago, five years ago, a year ago.
[12:13.120 --> 12:16.440]  But we'll be on now the big station as well.
[12:16.440 --> 12:17.440]  Those mom and pops are so great.
[12:17.440 --> 12:18.440]  They don't even care.
[12:18.440 --> 12:19.920]  They just want the word to get up.
[12:19.920 --> 12:22.560]  We're on the mom and pop in Chicago.
[12:22.560 --> 12:25.000]  Now we're on the big station in Chicago.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.440]  We're on the mom and pop in Orlando.
[12:27.440 --> 12:29.720]  Then we're on the big station in Orlando.
[12:29.720 --> 12:36.720]  This is how this works, and the fact that the things I say are now so accepted that
[12:36.720 --> 12:43.240]  I'm being put on the big stations shows the victory of the Liberty Movement, the victory
[12:43.240 --> 12:49.280]  of Ron Paul, the victory of you out there promoting basic common sense Americana ideas
[12:49.280 --> 12:52.960]  of private property, Second Amendment, family research.
[12:52.960 --> 12:54.240]  Don't believe the media.
[12:54.240 --> 12:55.360]  Keep government small.
[12:55.360 --> 12:57.920]  Do your research.
[12:57.920 --> 13:07.480]  We've had a massive earth shaking success, huge.
[13:07.480 --> 13:12.480]  And this election last Tuesday is a seismic shift.
[13:12.480 --> 13:19.680]  The Democrats have lost more seats in Congress since they've had since 1921.
[13:19.680 --> 13:25.680]  They've lost more governors and state senators and state legislators since they had, since
[13:25.680 --> 13:30.360]  they were basically begun the first party in the country, but they didn't get competition
[13:30.360 --> 13:31.960]  till the 1820s and stuff.
[13:31.960 --> 13:39.040]  So they have they're at the weakest point in their history.
[13:39.040 --> 13:44.200]  That isn't because people like a reanimated corpse, Mitch McConnell, who looks like a
[13:44.200 --> 13:46.000]  meat puppet talking.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.560]  It isn't because people like Joe Boehner playing golf with Obama all day.
[13:49.560 --> 13:55.240]  All the polls show libertarians, real conservatives, constitutionalists, detest them.
[13:55.240 --> 13:59.840]  It's because people are really starting to wake up.
[13:59.840 --> 14:00.840]  They're getting involved.
[14:00.840 --> 14:02.600]  Democrats are waking up.
[14:02.600 --> 14:04.200]  Minorities are waking up.
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.600]  The Republicans did the right thing and ran a lot of minorities that were libertarian based
[14:08.600 --> 14:14.080]  blacks, Hispanics, women, you name it, record numbers getting elected.
[14:14.080 --> 14:16.160]  That's because there's a political realignment.
[14:16.160 --> 14:17.280]  It isn't about black and white.
[14:17.280 --> 14:18.640]  It's about issues.
[14:18.640 --> 14:20.320]  It's about freedom.
[14:20.320 --> 14:24.520]  And that's another major political realignment is that you've got minorities going and voting
[14:24.520 --> 14:25.640]  for Republicans.
[14:25.640 --> 14:30.080]  You've got white Republicans going out of their way to vote for minorities because they don't
[14:30.080 --> 14:31.760]  care about what color you are.
[14:31.760 --> 14:33.440]  They want lower taxes.
[14:33.440 --> 14:35.160]  They want their second amendment.
[14:35.160 --> 14:36.760]  They want their private property.
[14:36.760 --> 14:38.280]  They want their sovereignty.
[14:38.280 --> 14:42.040]  They don't want to be spied on by the NSA and they don't want totally open borders and
[14:42.040 --> 14:44.680]  they don't want Obamacare.
[14:44.680 --> 14:48.760]  Everyone I know, including myself, has had doubling.
[14:48.760 --> 14:51.960]  I see instances of only 70% increases the last two years.
[14:51.960 --> 14:56.400]  And then they announced now of officially starting next month, they're going to increase
[14:56.400 --> 15:00.240]  some more.
[15:00.240 --> 15:02.640]  And then when you complain, they go, oh, shut up conspiracy theorist.
[15:02.640 --> 15:07.280]  It doesn't work when everybody's getting their increased bill.
[15:07.280 --> 15:09.920]  Obama's running around shutting coal power plants down everywhere.
[15:09.920 --> 15:11.480]  People see their power bill going up.
[15:11.480 --> 15:14.400]  Austin is about to shut down at home.
[15:14.400 --> 15:15.400]  Four power plants.
[15:15.400 --> 15:20.280]  They're about to shut down their final power plant in Fayetteville, a gigantic, modern
[15:20.280 --> 15:25.680]  facility, something like 60, 70 miles from Austin, and that will increase prices even
[15:25.680 --> 15:26.680]  more.
[15:26.680 --> 15:29.040]  And they're not even going to bring on solar or wind to replace it.
[15:29.040 --> 15:32.400]  They're just going to screw everybody and buy the power from Mexico and they'll lose
[15:32.400 --> 15:35.960]  half its transmission from Mexico, but insiders are making deals.
[15:35.960 --> 15:36.960]  They don't care.
[15:36.960 --> 15:40.480]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[15:40.480 --> 15:45.000]  The amount of criminal takeover going on, but it's good to see a huge sustained awakening.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.120]  Now we're going to cover news when we come back.
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.600]  We're going to blitz news, Arctic vortex, you name it.

[16:05.040 --> 16:10.600]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the info wars lifeline because they are
[16:10.600 --> 16:15.960]  not of the very highest quality or because they're not 100% organic or because they don't

[16:52.600 --> 16:56.840]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has
[16:56.840 --> 16:58.640]  been told not to drink the water.
[16:58.640 --> 17:01.360]  Ohio governor declaring a state of emergency.
[17:01.360 --> 17:07.040]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[17:07.040 --> 17:08.320]  single day?
[17:08.320 --> 17:11.600]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[17:11.600 --> 17:14.200]  Most residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[17:14.200 --> 17:18.840]  We're here in a supermarket in Toledo, you can see the shelves empty where water once
[17:18.840 --> 17:19.840]  was.
[17:19.840 --> 17:25.160]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[17:25.160 --> 17:28.280]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.

[18:11.640 --> 18:14.960]  earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[18:14.960 --> 18:20.200]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[18:20.200 --> 18:25.680]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested
[18:25.680 --> 18:27.680]  and proven to be completely pure.

[18:52.160 --> 18:55.800]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[18:55.800 --> 19:00.160]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[19:00.160 --> 19:02.200]  Can you put two and two together?
[19:02.200 --> 19:07.800]  Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points and.308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[19:07.800 --> 19:09.800]  priced and fully legal.

[19:26.120 --> 19:32.720]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic supermail vitality formula.
[19:32.720 --> 19:38.640]  Supermail vitality by InfoWarslife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[19:50.160 --> 19:54.680]  from InfoWarslife.
[19:54.680 --> 20:01.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:24.680 --> 20:38.200]  So re-entrowing this segment the way I start at the last, imagine how radical America is.
[20:38.200 --> 20:42.120]  Imagine how angry the United States is.
[20:42.120 --> 20:46.040]  Imagine how upset people are.
[20:46.040 --> 20:59.280]  Imagine what the sleeping giant is thinking it up to when we have got this radio show
[20:59.280 --> 21:04.480]  dwarfing in ratings across the board MSNBC and CNN.
[21:04.480 --> 21:08.760]  Go look at the Alexa ratings, go look at the Arbitron ratings, go look at that compared
[21:08.760 --> 21:15.120]  to something like Nielsen with CNN's top shows having a million viewers, MSNBC a half
[21:15.120 --> 21:16.120]  million.
[21:16.120 --> 21:18.200]  They're a joke.
[21:18.200 --> 21:23.120]  How do they stack up against Rush Limbaugh with 10 million listeners a day or Michael
[21:23.120 --> 21:28.080]  Savage with 7 million listeners a day or Glenn Beck with 7 million listeners a day or this
[21:28.080 --> 21:32.160]  show with 3 million terrestrial listeners a day.
[21:32.160 --> 21:35.600]  That's a very conservative number by the way.
[21:35.600 --> 21:41.680]  And then on the internet 600,000 podcasts, 2 or 3 million YouTube views a day, all the
[21:41.680 --> 21:47.560]  other things added together, 18 million people a week conservatively watch or listen to this
[21:47.560 --> 21:50.120]  show.
[21:50.120 --> 21:54.800]  But they are mainstream media because they have big corporate sponsors and big fancy
[21:54.800 --> 21:55.800]  studios.
[21:55.800 --> 21:56.800]  Well, guess what?
[21:56.800 --> 21:57.920]  I like my little cozy radio studio.
[21:57.920 --> 22:01.960]  I have a big giant studio built by the same people that built major Fox News studios in
[22:01.960 --> 22:02.960]  New York.
[22:02.960 --> 22:09.120]  I have one now with the Jumbotrons and the whole 9 yards and the boom cameras and everything
[22:09.120 --> 22:16.320]  else and I'm just ready to flip the satellites on and go on cable and getting very close.
[22:16.320 --> 22:22.720]  But I'm not even in a hurry because I already arrived a long time ago.
[22:22.720 --> 22:28.120]  This is just adding icing to the cake, cherries on top of the Sunday.
[22:28.120 --> 22:32.680]  The dinosaur media is dead.
[22:32.680 --> 22:39.280]  They were dead 15 years ago and Matt Drudge gave his famous speech in 1999 at the press
[22:39.280 --> 22:43.920]  club and told the media there, you're all being eating new jobs in 10 to 15 years and
[22:43.920 --> 22:49.400]  they laughed at him.
[22:49.400 --> 22:54.360]  You know, I don't think I ever aired that 40-something minute long Drudge special with his speech
[22:54.360 --> 22:56.440]  and then all the clips backing up what he said.
[22:56.440 --> 23:00.840]  We ought to air that someday this week in one of the hours of the show.
[23:00.840 --> 23:01.840]  It was pretty powerful.
[23:01.840 --> 23:02.840]  It was part of it.
[23:02.840 --> 23:03.840]  I think they're the whole thing.
[23:03.840 --> 23:08.000]  That was called how Mount Drudge changed the world updated and again, when you say Drudge,
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.880]  it's like calling a search engine Google.
[23:10.880 --> 23:14.360]  We touch stone that a lot because everybody knows what I'm talking about.
[23:14.360 --> 23:22.000]  It's kind of like I'm talking about government secret testing, I say Tuskegee or if you're
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.600]  talking about bad guys, you know, you say Nazis.
[23:24.600 --> 23:31.380]  If you're talking about changing how the media works, being a trailblazer, you say Drudge
[23:31.380 --> 23:33.080]  or people say conspiracy theorist.
[23:33.080 --> 23:34.600]  They say Alex Jones.
[23:34.600 --> 23:36.080]  Well, what does that mean?
[23:36.080 --> 23:38.480]  It means I question known liars.
[23:38.480 --> 23:43.920]  I do historical research and they don't control reality anymore.
[23:43.920 --> 23:48.400]  So more and more, it's not even about the news and I'm going to cover it all.
[23:48.400 --> 23:51.840]  We got a special guest coming up in a special report.
[23:51.840 --> 23:55.400]  It's about when is this facade collapse?
[23:55.400 --> 24:00.480]  We started the show today with a David Knight report that's going to be up on info wars.com
[24:00.480 --> 24:03.840]  titled CNN Death Spiral.
[24:03.840 --> 24:08.000]  It'll go up for everybody who's a radio listener in the next hour, info wars.com and prison
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  body.com.
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.880]  We just premiered the audio and video here showing CNN lying, showing them using blue
[24:12.880 --> 24:16.280]  screens, faking locations, showing and deceiving people.
[24:16.280 --> 24:19.760]  And that's why their top shows have a million viewers.
[24:19.760 --> 24:24.560]  Their top show 20 something years ago had like 15 million viewers.
[24:24.560 --> 24:33.400]  It's a joke, but they still have that air of arrogance, the emperors, new clothes syndrome.
[24:33.400 --> 24:37.240]  But I think they're the only ones that don't know they've collapsed.
[24:37.240 --> 24:38.240]  What is it?
[24:38.240 --> 24:41.800]  Dish network or direct TV just dumped them.
[24:41.800 --> 24:48.220]  I mean, you can get, yeah, yeah, dish network folks, we can get on dish network.
[24:48.220 --> 24:49.760]  We've been talking to them.
[24:49.760 --> 24:51.240]  They want us on.
[24:51.240 --> 24:56.800]  Do you understand that and the CEO just said they don't have an audience.
[24:56.800 --> 24:57.800]  I don't care.
[24:57.800 --> 24:58.800]  They used to be big.
[24:58.800 --> 24:59.800]  They're off.
[24:59.800 --> 25:06.600]  And it said when I was reading the article about it in a trade publication that the,
[25:06.600 --> 25:09.600]  the CEO was giddy and laughing.
[25:09.600 --> 25:13.120]  That's because I happen to know the CEO doesn't like the new world order.
[25:13.120 --> 25:15.920]  She can leave it at that.
[25:15.920 --> 25:18.720]  So that's where all this is coming down.
[25:18.720 --> 25:21.600]  The crowd is leaving the controlled left.
[25:21.600 --> 25:26.280]  They're leaving all the people that sit up there and make pronouncements and say, if
[25:26.280 --> 25:31.080]  you don't accept gun control and, and live disarmed, we're going to call you racist.
[25:31.080 --> 25:34.440]  And they'll, they'll, they'll call your racist and then wait for you to fall down in a fetal
[25:34.440 --> 25:37.560]  position and start urinating on yourself.
[25:37.560 --> 25:40.080]  And when it doesn't happen, they go, racist, double racist.
[25:40.080 --> 25:41.840]  And then you go, I don't care.
[25:41.840 --> 25:48.560]  And they go, homophobe, sexist, close minded, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid,
[25:48.560 --> 25:52.480]  uh, whacked out, uh, crazy, crazy, crazy.
[25:52.480 --> 25:58.480]  Those are all badges of courage now because people know it doesn't mean anything.
[25:58.480 --> 26:02.960]  When you call someone a name or an extremist or a tabloid journalist, they, you know, they
[26:02.960 --> 26:03.960]  call everybody that.
[26:03.960 --> 26:06.080]  Oh, that's just tabloid junk media.
[26:06.080 --> 26:11.080]  You know, Alex Jones just wants ratings, a bunch of hype, a bunch of drugs, a bunch
[26:11.080 --> 26:12.080]  of tabloid.
[26:12.080 --> 26:15.040]  But then you go to the mainstream media.
[26:15.040 --> 26:20.920]  And they got five times the tabloid stuff that info wars.com or prisonplanet.com have.
[26:20.920 --> 26:27.920]  Let me tell you what sensational GOP gains slam door on gun control push the hill.
[26:27.920 --> 26:29.840]  I'm going to be talking about that.
[26:29.840 --> 26:30.840]  Look at this.
[26:30.840 --> 26:37.360]  Putin and the Chinese president sign mega gas deal on second gas supply route that ties
[26:37.360 --> 26:41.120]  into China mocks and ship it Obama and wake up midterms.
[26:41.120 --> 26:45.920]  This was last week, uh, and it says, uh, state newspapers say America has grown tired of
[26:45.920 --> 26:49.320]  president's banality just days before he's due to visit.
[26:49.320 --> 26:54.000]  He's now over there and, and, and to reject him, they sign this in front of him to show
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.800]  the weakness of Obama, the patheticness of his press secretary getting up there last
[26:59.800 --> 27:03.800]  week on Wednesday and saying, losing the election isn't a loss.
[27:03.800 --> 27:09.160]  And the reporters laughed at him now a few years ago, you wouldn't laugh at the emissary
[27:09.160 --> 27:12.280]  of the Lord and savior, as Jamie Foxx called him, Barack Obama.
[27:12.280 --> 27:14.920]  Can we cue that up, please?
[27:14.920 --> 27:19.480]  I mean, if he said losing an election was winning one, then by golly, if he said two
[27:19.480 --> 27:24.000]  plus two equal five, that was the way it was, but people don't buy it anymore.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.560]  They jumped the shark.
[27:25.560 --> 27:26.560]  They went too far.
[27:26.560 --> 27:31.080]  And let me tell you who else is jumping the shark.
[27:31.080 --> 27:38.680]  The Republican party now has suddenly the bushes all over TV, Bush, senior, Jeb W. Oh,
[27:38.680 --> 27:39.680]  we all want Jeb.
[27:39.680 --> 27:41.240]  Oh, he's the answer.
[27:41.240 --> 27:46.040]  I'm about ready to throw up.
[27:46.040 --> 27:49.840]  And you got Boehner parading around, oh, what a great leader he is, a great strategist.
[27:49.840 --> 27:54.760]  He wrote a wave of dissatisfaction that we haven't seen in over 150 years in this country,
[27:54.760 --> 27:59.240]  a seismic shift.
[27:59.240 --> 28:04.840]  And believe me, it's going to destroy the Republican establishment next if they don't
[28:04.840 --> 28:05.840]  get in line.
[28:05.840 --> 28:10.120]  Plus, it's only a very small group of globalists that want to control the economy and don't
[28:10.120 --> 28:14.560]  want prosperity and want to have a crony system that's just down their competition.
[28:14.560 --> 28:20.800]  Most executives, most government people, most everybody I've talked to, including a long
[28:20.800 --> 28:24.600]  list of billionaires, famous people, you name it, a lot of them on the show, they don't
[28:24.600 --> 28:25.800]  want to wreck America.
[28:25.800 --> 28:27.360]  They don't want to have World War III.
[28:27.360 --> 28:28.720]  They don't want to break up families.
[28:28.720 --> 28:29.720]  They don't want to take the guns.
[28:29.720 --> 28:34.960]  They want prosperity and stability, and it's become clear that the elites running things
[28:34.960 --> 28:40.320]  are radicals who want to wreck society, like Nero burning Rome, because he wants to expand
[28:40.320 --> 28:46.960]  his palace, and the world is turning against it with human intelligence and resisting it.
[28:46.960 --> 28:47.960]  We'll be back with the news.
[28:47.960 --> 28:49.960]  I'm going to cover everything in the news till next hour.
[28:49.960 --> 28:53.640]  Special guest joins us.
[28:53.640 --> 28:54.640]  In the near future.
[28:54.640 --> 29:01.760]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball, security, alert, this is Homeland
[29:01.760 --> 29:07.280]  Security, analysis, info wars, building independent media operations, you let the worst people
[29:07.280 --> 29:12.920]  get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible, prime-directed discredit
[29:12.920 --> 29:13.920]  Alex Jones.
[29:13.920 --> 29:19.120]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory, a popular conspiracy theory talk show called
[29:19.120 --> 29:20.120]  info wars.
[29:20.120 --> 29:22.120]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[29:22.120 --> 29:27.600]  These people are assaulting us, targeting of patriots engaged, they are never going
[29:27.600 --> 29:32.600]  to stop, they are never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[29:45.720 --> 29:52.640]  propaganda they put out, intellectually it's begun, you can fail it.
[29:52.640 --> 29:59.320]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[29:59.320 --> 30:04.480]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[30:04.480 --> 30:13.880]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans, they so pride
[30:13.880 --> 30:23.160]  in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit, they put a diamond gusset in the
[30:23.160 --> 30:31.280]  crotch where you need it most, blue diamond gussets got it, other stone.

[30:49.680 --> 30:50.680]  others don't.
[30:50.680 --> 30:57.280]  Aging starts at the cellular level, when cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets
[30:57.280 --> 30:58.280]  in.
[30:58.280 --> 31:03.880]  In the past decade we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries, during that period
[31:03.880 --> 31:10.240]  key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth and rejuvenation, but
[31:10.240 --> 31:16.120]  no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[31:16.120 --> 31:19.400]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[31:19.400 --> 31:26.160]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA force, just one of the key compounds, biopqq

[32:02.560 --> 32:08.120]  backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy-powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented
[32:08.120 --> 32:11.560]  during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[32:11.560 --> 32:16.800]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[32:16.800 --> 32:22.440]  ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse, gently start
[32:22.440 --> 32:26.960]  cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep, oxy-powder

[33:13.960 --> 33:39.360]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[33:39.360 --> 33:45.120]  The full of the progressive cancer Barack Obama is a big defeat to the establishment.
[33:45.120 --> 33:49.120]  They put everything they had behind him to get their victim disarmament through, their
[33:49.120 --> 33:54.600]  open borders through, their world government through, their fake Arab Spring to radicalize,
[33:54.600 --> 33:58.580]  the Middle East to turn it over to Saudi Arabian radicals.
[33:58.580 --> 34:04.400]  They are being met with resistance worldwide as people get past the propaganda narrative
[34:04.400 --> 34:08.800]  and down to what's really happening.
[34:08.800 --> 34:12.960]  And so the fact that Obama has been repudiated is a very positive thing.
[34:12.960 --> 34:15.040]  Does that mean we're out of the woods?
[34:15.040 --> 34:16.040]  Absolutely not.
[34:16.040 --> 34:21.120]  We've got to stop just buying narratives that are lies, we've got to start doing our
[34:21.120 --> 34:22.120]  own research.
[34:22.120 --> 34:25.640]  What are some of those narratives?
[34:25.640 --> 34:34.560]  Siberian expressed to bring 30 minus degree Fahrenheit to Wyoming and other areas near
[34:34.560 --> 34:40.600]  the Canadian border.
[34:40.600 --> 34:42.520]  Arctic blast coming this way.
[34:42.520 --> 34:47.760]  Arctic vortex set to hit New York City late next week as well.
[34:47.760 --> 34:54.920]  Arctic blast via polar vortex to chill 42 U.S. cities.
[34:54.920 --> 35:02.640]  From Idaho all the way out to New York, it is going to be massive.
[35:02.640 --> 35:06.360]  More below zero, 20, 30 degrees or more below zero.
[35:06.360 --> 35:19.440]  As far south, as far south as close to Oklahoma, that is just amazing to see that map on screen.
[35:19.440 --> 35:26.960]  And of course, there are record cold temperatures recorded in the last 100 years all over, not
[35:26.960 --> 35:34.320]  just here but in Europe, and the UN's response is that that's global warming doing that.
[35:34.320 --> 35:39.200]  And remember the Al Gore movie that he was involved with, the fiction movie, where global
[35:39.200 --> 35:44.200]  warming causes global freezing, so you've got to pay the UN money?
[35:44.200 --> 35:46.320]  Well, that's because they hedge their bets.
[35:46.320 --> 35:51.280]  When the Club of Rome came out in the 60s, the big UN eugenics group, they said we need
[35:51.280 --> 35:56.920]  to organize the world around humans being the enemy and taxing and controlling humans
[35:56.920 --> 35:59.520]  for the elite as if we're another species.
[35:59.520 --> 36:05.320]  And we'll say the threat is global ice age, which a lot of meteorologists and astrophysicists
[36:05.320 --> 36:09.640]  and historians say is what we're due for.
[36:09.640 --> 36:14.360]  Nothing to do with humans, it's just it goes in 12,000 year cycles roughly.
[36:14.360 --> 36:21.160]  The last ice age ended 12,000 years ago roughly and the sun is on a cycle and it's
[36:21.160 --> 36:22.320]  cooling down right now.
[36:22.320 --> 36:23.320]  This is all admitted.
[36:23.320 --> 36:29.080]  But the UN five years ago had a vote and said the sun has quote, no effect on climate.
[36:29.080 --> 36:32.600]  That's like saying that again, water has no effect on fish.
[36:32.600 --> 36:39.000]  You'd be like having a fish in a fish tank swimming around, you said school children,
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.400]  the fish does not need water to live and the fish is not in water.
[36:43.400 --> 36:46.240]  And if you have a business, you didn't build that.
[36:46.240 --> 36:51.360]  Everybody else did and raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit.
[36:51.360 --> 36:53.160]  See there's an attempt to overthrow reality.
[36:53.160 --> 36:55.840]  It's not working.
[36:55.840 --> 36:58.720]  So manmade global warming is a certified fraud.
[36:58.720 --> 37:02.640]  Al Gore's movie in court in England has been proven a certified fraud saying polar bears
[37:02.640 --> 37:03.640]  can't swim.
[37:03.640 --> 37:10.560]  Benguins are, you know, drowning because or in the South Atlantic because in the South
[37:10.560 --> 37:14.040]  Pacific off Antarctica because they can't swim.
[37:14.040 --> 37:20.760]  I mean, it's just not true and saying that polar bears are almost extinct when their
[37:20.760 --> 37:23.320]  numbers are five full, but they were in the 1950s.
[37:23.320 --> 37:28.160]  Just write down when I say search engine and Google it and you'll see mainstream news.
[37:28.160 --> 37:31.080]  They look, I promise raising the debt limit raises the debt limit.
[37:31.080 --> 37:33.080]  I promise you built your business.
[37:33.080 --> 37:35.000]  I promise two plus two equals four.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.040]  And I know I hammer this.
[37:37.040 --> 37:39.640]  It's because I am a conspiracy theorist.
[37:39.640 --> 37:42.720]  I don't believe common core saying it equals five.
[37:42.720 --> 37:44.500]  I know you built your business.
[37:44.500 --> 37:47.160]  I know I, Obamacare had death panels.
[37:47.160 --> 37:49.480]  I know it had increases in prices.
[37:49.480 --> 37:53.880]  I know it had payroll taxes because I read the subsections.
[37:53.880 --> 38:01.640]  I read them on air, but MSNBC's response was Alex Jones is deeply racist and they have
[38:01.640 --> 38:06.400]  failed mightily in their attempt to think your mind controlled idiots and if they just
[38:06.400 --> 38:12.320]  acted like confident con men, they'd be like a magician that hypnotizes people and a magician
[38:12.320 --> 38:13.320]  will call up.
[38:13.320 --> 38:17.160]  I was on a cruise ship once and saw this call up like 15 people, ask them questions, see
[38:17.160 --> 38:26.040]  who's suggestible and then they'll call them up and they'll hypnotize them and they'll
[38:26.040 --> 38:27.480]  have them do ridiculous things.
[38:27.480 --> 38:33.120]  And the person really was hypnotized because the person wasn't conscious and wasn't real.
[38:33.120 --> 38:37.480]  They basically were a non human program from birth in front of the television said highly
[38:37.480 --> 38:46.160]  suggestible, not a real person, just a droid and you always had people like that in history.
[38:46.160 --> 38:49.960]  But with television, sitting kids in front of television, all the studies show this,
[38:49.960 --> 38:54.240]  lowering IQ, making them highly suggestible, making them where they're spectators, not
[38:54.240 --> 38:58.480]  actors, not on the arena floor.
[38:58.480 --> 39:05.480]  Now a large portion of people aren't really conscious and really aren't people and the
[39:05.480 --> 39:10.120]  globalists are trying to turn us into that, but there's still a giant minority that's
[39:10.120 --> 39:15.800]  fully awake and I'd say a slight majority that's somewhat awake and some of these zombies
[39:15.800 --> 39:18.480]  can be resuscitated.
[39:18.480 --> 39:28.200]  Helen Keller couldn't seek, couldn't hear and had been left as a baby, never taught
[39:28.200 --> 39:34.680]  anything and she was taught to learn to think and be involved and wrote incredible books.
[39:34.680 --> 39:40.280]  So just because they're not humans in the elite's own words, they want to make you nonhuman
[39:40.280 --> 39:45.520]  and they can kill you according to their rules, their globalist rules with the cancer viruses
[39:45.520 --> 39:48.880]  and the vaccines and the GMO, I mean if you're dumb enough to eat that stuff and take those
[39:48.880 --> 39:51.680]  shots in their view, you deserve it.
[39:51.680 --> 39:55.040]  This is what they write about, this is official.
[39:55.040 --> 39:59.400]  What you're hearing is how things really work folks and I understand it's hard to hear all
[39:59.400 --> 40:09.320]  this but that's what's going on.
[40:09.320 --> 40:16.440]  Now I want to get into kissing bug disease, infects over 300,000 people in the US, most
[40:16.440 --> 40:20.360]  of whom don't even know they have a parasite referred to as the new AIDS, thought I'd
[40:20.360 --> 40:21.360]  get to that.
[40:21.360 --> 40:26.320]  Is it chagas disease as I pronounce it?
[40:26.320 --> 40:32.520]  All sorts of loving parasites now coming in from the third world.
[40:32.520 --> 40:37.320]  Bloodsucking kissing bugs, we're going to get into those for you today.
[40:37.320 --> 40:44.120]  Hey, it's not a bloodsucking kissing bug, it's our lord and savior, the blood bug.
[40:44.120 --> 40:48.160]  They told trendies to go out and put their children in pits with blood bugs, they would,
[40:48.160 --> 40:49.160]  I'm telling you.
[40:49.160 --> 40:52.600]  We'll tell you about that, I know knowledge is a conspiracy theory, I know knowing how
[40:52.600 --> 40:56.440]  things work is evil and bad and weird and kind of creepy but we're going to talk about
[40:56.440 --> 40:58.560]  that today as well.
[40:58.560 --> 41:05.080]  Merkel hails fall, a Berlin wall is proof dreams can come true and then she just replaced
[41:05.080 --> 41:07.680]  it with more communism.
[41:07.680 --> 41:12.400]  But let's get to the next hoax here that we're going to be detailing in the second hour
[41:12.400 --> 41:17.880]  pretty much exclusively because as this hoax falls, as this lie falls, all others fall.
[41:17.880 --> 41:22.640]  Dr. Steve Pacinac, who was one of the founders of Delta Force and the head psych warfare
[41:22.640 --> 41:30.000]  expert that ran the Camp David Accords and involved with right through to Bush 41, the
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.360]  head of PSI ops for the State Department, advising the Army and CIA, he said a few months
[41:35.360 --> 41:41.280]  after 9-11 on my show that bin Laden already died of kidney failure and then later Walter
[41:41.280 --> 41:44.840]  Cronkite came out and said that instead of Madeline Albright, she said he's dead, he's
[41:44.840 --> 41:46.800]  frozen, he'll be rolled out a later date.
[41:46.800 --> 41:51.640]  I even have the mainstream news article and videos linked in Paul Watson's article.
[41:51.640 --> 41:55.400]  Inside sources bin Laden's corpse has been on ice for nearly a decade.
[41:55.400 --> 42:02.200]  That was 2011, but we had Pacinac back on, it was early 2002.
[42:02.200 --> 42:06.320]  He'll be joining us because obviously killing bin Laden's a hoax, that's why they had to
[42:06.320 --> 42:10.560]  blow up the Navy SEAL helicopter that day, blow up another one a few weeks later, killing
[42:10.560 --> 42:11.560]  23.
[42:11.560 --> 42:14.560]  I've talked to Navy SEALs, I've talked to their families on air but a year before
[42:14.560 --> 42:21.200]  they were on air, Navy SEALs, Navy SEALs families, I met face to face like a week after they
[42:21.200 --> 42:25.200]  blew up the helicopter and they said no, it was a bomb on board, they killed them.
[42:25.200 --> 42:27.040]  It wasn't a real mission.
[42:27.040 --> 42:31.200]  So we're going to talk about this new Navy SEAL that came out and said that he's the
[42:31.200 --> 42:33.680]  guy that did it, even though there's two other conflicting books that say something
[42:33.680 --> 42:37.840]  else by other Navy SEALs, it's all propaganda.
[42:37.840 --> 42:41.720]  Well here's CNN, within days of them coming out with this story, he says it doesn't matter
[42:41.720 --> 42:47.080]  anymore if I kill bin Laden, he doesn't care if people say it isn't true, okay man, two
[42:47.080 --> 42:52.520]  plus two equals five, we'll just believe whatever you say.
[42:52.520 --> 42:56.800]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[42:56.800 --> 43:03.240]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic super male vitality formula.
[43:03.240 --> 43:08.760]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[43:08.760 --> 43:09.760]  dose.
[43:09.760 --> 43:11.960]  I'm out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[43:11.960 --> 43:15.040]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.

[43:20.920 --> 43:22.240]  from InfoWars Life.
[43:22.240 --> 43:25.920]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[43:25.920 --> 43:30.280]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[43:30.280 --> 43:32.280]  Can you put two and two together?
[43:32.280 --> 43:37.880]  Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[43:37.880 --> 43:41.000]  priced and fully legal, but for how long?

[46:55.200 --> 47:00.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:00.200 --> 47:13.080]  Hello, this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[47:13.080 --> 47:28.560]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:28.560 --> 47:34.800]  Let's run fast through news.
[47:34.800 --> 47:39.360]  Wall Street Journal's reporting Ferguson is bracing for grand jury decision in Michael
[47:39.360 --> 47:44.720]  Brown's shooting death up in the little town outside St. Louis, Missouri, with a lot of
[47:44.720 --> 47:50.600]  the people in the area saying they plan to basically go wild if the police officer's
[47:50.600 --> 47:53.160]  not indicted.
[47:53.160 --> 47:55.080]  We sent reporters up there.
[47:55.080 --> 47:57.520]  We've investigated this in depth.
[47:57.520 --> 48:01.280]  Our reporters were shot by rubber bullets by the police for no reason.
[48:01.280 --> 48:05.920]  One cop got suspended because he threatened to quote, blow Joe Biggs' head off.
[48:05.920 --> 48:09.600]  So we're just reporting on what really happened.
[48:09.600 --> 48:14.200]  The cop has witnesses and now the videos that are part of the investigation.
[48:14.200 --> 48:20.800]  It's been confirmed that the guy charged him and attacked the cop.
[48:20.800 --> 48:23.840]  So what's the point in saying you're going to burn everything down?
[48:23.840 --> 48:27.160]  And when I mentioned some of the police being out of control, I'm just reporting on what
[48:27.160 --> 48:30.520]  happened, okay?
[48:30.520 --> 48:34.600]  But businesses don't deserve to be looted and houses don't deserve to be burned down and
[48:34.600 --> 48:39.640]  white reporters don't deserve to be attacked as has been happening by black racists out
[48:39.640 --> 48:44.440]  there that are just using this as an excuse to run around acting crazy.
[48:44.440 --> 48:50.400]  But all we do see is go to the scene and actually report on what's going on.
[48:50.400 --> 48:56.040]  And we found a criminal element from St. Louis and surrounding areas came in to exploit the
[48:56.040 --> 48:57.880]  crisis.
[48:57.880 --> 49:06.520]  And now they want to use riots as a way to loot basically and racially target people.
[49:06.520 --> 49:08.480]  And I just think it's despicable.
[49:08.480 --> 49:11.800]  Even if the cop was wrong shooting brown, two wrongs don't make a right.
[49:11.800 --> 49:16.320]  You don't then run around and burn down white-owned shops just because some white cop shot a black
[49:16.320 --> 49:17.320]  guy.
[49:17.320 --> 49:23.720]  It just shows how MSNBC and others were successful, at least creating a racially charged climate
[49:23.720 --> 49:25.540]  with some groups of people.
[49:25.540 --> 49:29.000]  But most, quote, minorities fully rejected, and that's good.
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.640]  But the Ferguson situation, we will watch it.
[49:31.640 --> 49:36.200]  I don't send my reporters into war zones unless they want to go.
[49:36.200 --> 49:39.200]  Joe Biggs is visiting his sister right now.
[49:39.200 --> 49:43.600]  But I have a sneaking suspicion when he gets back tomorrow that he'll want to go back to
[49:43.600 --> 49:44.600]  Ferguson.
[49:44.600 --> 49:46.800]  So we'll probably have reporters up there.
[49:46.800 --> 49:55.200]  They think the verdict will be towards the end of the week, but it's not fun to be attacked
[49:55.200 --> 49:57.760]  by the police and the protesters.
[49:57.760 --> 50:02.160]  And by the way, the cops will leave a protester throwing mall-off cocktails alone.
[50:02.160 --> 50:08.560]  We have this on video, and then go out of their way to attack reporters.
[50:08.560 --> 50:10.160]  And again, that's the federal training.
[50:10.160 --> 50:13.840]  That's the anti-media brainwashing that's going on in police.
[50:13.840 --> 50:18.440]  And it's despicable, quite frankly, that when reporters try to do their jobs and are even
[50:18.440 --> 50:21.000]  out of the controlled areas, they're being attacked.
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.080]  But I don't want to digress and open that whole can of worms back up.
[50:24.080 --> 50:26.100]  I'm just telling you what happened.
[50:26.100 --> 50:29.560]  That's all we're doing is just straight shooting what happened.
[50:29.560 --> 50:35.720]  And this could be a real powder keg because there are folks in Miami and Detroit and LA
[50:35.720 --> 50:41.320]  and New York and D.C. and other areas, Dallas, that are saying they're going to basically
[50:41.320 --> 50:48.480]  racially riot if this verdict comes out like Rodney King nationwide and the LA riots.
[50:48.480 --> 50:52.360]  And again, the cops stand back because they don't want to be called racist or whatever.
[50:52.360 --> 50:56.080]  And then people burn their own neighborhoods, and it was the Korean shopkeepers defending
[50:56.080 --> 50:59.920]  their own homes with shotguns and their businesses that stopped whole areas from being burned
[50:59.920 --> 51:02.200]  down.
[51:02.200 --> 51:04.120]  I don't care if you're black or white or what color you are.
[51:04.120 --> 51:08.880]  You try to pull me over like Reginald Denny, block my vehicle and then bash my brains out
[51:08.880 --> 51:10.640]  or my face in.
[51:10.640 --> 51:13.920]  I'm not going to get out on the ground on my knees while you throw center blocks into
[51:13.920 --> 51:14.920]  my face.
[51:14.920 --> 51:17.880]  That's all I've got to say.
[51:17.880 --> 51:21.920]  There's a reason this stuff only flies in disarmed areas.
[51:21.920 --> 51:25.280]  By the way, St. Louis isn't disarmed.
[51:25.280 --> 51:28.960]  So people think they're going to pull an LA riot there.
[51:28.960 --> 51:30.280]  That is not advisable.
[51:30.280 --> 51:35.680]  And again, it's citizens with guns that are securing this country.
[51:35.680 --> 51:40.560]  And they've got national polls out, 97% of police officers in polls agree.
[51:40.560 --> 51:41.560]  They know what's going on.
[51:41.560 --> 51:48.920]  Speaking of that, New American magazine, Merry Christmas, UN declares arms trade treaty to
[51:48.920 --> 51:53.800]  go into effect December 24th and Obama says he will follow it with an executive order.
[51:53.800 --> 51:57.840]  In fact, he's already done that and will follow their, quote, recommendations regardless
[51:57.840 --> 51:58.840]  of what Congress does.
[51:58.840 --> 52:00.160]  So get ready for that.
[52:00.160 --> 52:04.440]  He says he'll have amnesty too and hand out 60 million green cards that Senator Sessions
[52:04.440 --> 52:06.480]  says they've been told have already been printed.
[52:06.480 --> 52:09.760]  Yeah, it's 60 million illegals, not 30.
[52:09.760 --> 52:12.160]  That's a 10-year-old number.
[52:12.160 --> 52:18.240]  Merry Christmas, the official United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs, UNIDIR, says
[52:18.240 --> 52:21.760]  that it will officially go in on December 24th.
[52:21.760 --> 52:25.600]  So a nice little Christmas gift to everybody.
[52:25.600 --> 52:30.160]  And it just absolutely bans guns for civilian ownership.
[52:30.160 --> 52:35.680]  Just like their last treaty said back in July 7th, 2000, it said the civilian ownership
[52:35.680 --> 52:40.120]  of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[52:40.120 --> 52:43.920]  Well, there's a power monopoly of the state in North Korea.
[52:43.920 --> 52:48.000]  There's a power monopoly in Mexico that's devolved into anarchy.
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.560]  There's power monopoly under Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Fidel.
[52:52.560 --> 53:00.160]  Every other bad guy, Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, Vladi and Paylor, Count Dracula, real
[53:00.160 --> 53:05.760]  guy, wasn't really a vampire, might as well have been, I mean, I think it was his niece
[53:05.760 --> 53:07.440]  later did bathe in the blood of babies.
[53:07.440 --> 53:08.440]  That was on record.
[53:08.440 --> 53:10.760]  Just thought it made her younger, you know.
[53:10.760 --> 53:12.480]  I don't know, folks.
[53:12.480 --> 53:13.480]  There you go.
[53:13.480 --> 53:17.120]  It just doesn't work except for the tyrants.
[53:17.120 --> 53:20.000]  But the good news is we can have national sovereignty.
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.840]  And the good news is the GOP is now talking about repealing Obamacare because of pressure
[53:24.840 --> 53:30.240]  on Boehner and others who were saying just a week ago after the election or six days
[53:30.240 --> 53:33.640]  ago that they weren't going to repeal all quote all of it because Republican special
[53:33.640 --> 53:36.040]  interest are the same special interest Democrats.
[53:36.040 --> 53:40.560]  I mean, it's big foreign banks that want double and triple premiums and have death panels
[53:40.560 --> 53:46.880]  and give you bad care and just loot everything and have it paid for with payroll taxes.
[53:46.880 --> 53:53.800]  But Republicans resounding victory this week, push federal gun control legislation even
[53:53.800 --> 53:59.120]  further out of reach for proponents of stronger regulations, though they're proponents of
[53:59.120 --> 54:00.120]  victim disarmament.
[54:00.120 --> 54:03.120]  They want a monopoly of power because they know what Mao said political power was out
[54:03.120 --> 54:04.120]  of barrel of a gun.
[54:04.120 --> 54:07.640]  More than 90 percent of the National Rival Association back congressional candidates
[54:07.640 --> 54:11.760]  prevailed Tuesday, bolstering the ranks of gun rights advocates in both chambers.
[54:11.760 --> 54:16.560]  Yeah, and if Republicans would just deliver on some basic tax cuts and some basic repeals
[54:16.560 --> 54:20.880]  of tyranny and slap down Obama on open borders and, and, and, and, you know, withhold funding
[54:20.880 --> 54:25.560]  from the White House if you didn't do it and start impeachment, they would have a total
[54:25.560 --> 54:32.000]  landslide in two years and the presidency in the House, the Senate, a supermajority.
[54:32.000 --> 54:37.080]  We could save the country a new golden age of Americana, but the elite know that it'll
[54:37.080 --> 54:43.120]  be libertarians taking over the Republicans and that party will split basically.
[54:43.120 --> 54:48.120]  And they think that's what's predicted, it will basically turn into the two new parties
[54:48.120 --> 54:54.040]  is Republican light and true libertine ideas.
[54:54.040 --> 54:59.200]  And that's what they're scared of is that the classic populist, liberty based true populism
[54:59.200 --> 55:04.360]  is free market, freedom, while, while West laws, a fair 10% growth rates a year, just
[55:04.360 --> 55:09.520]  absolute milk and honey gushing down the streets and the elites don't like that.
[55:09.520 --> 55:13.600]  They want to be the ones with their federal reserve money, taxpayer money who decide the
[55:13.600 --> 55:14.720]  winners and losers.
[55:14.720 --> 55:16.240]  What a joke.
[55:16.240 --> 55:17.240]  I mentioned this.
[55:17.240 --> 55:21.600]  Let me just get into it briefly before we go to break kissing bug disease, infects daily
[55:21.600 --> 55:25.800]  mail reports over 300,000 people in the US, most of whom don't know they have the parasite
[55:25.800 --> 55:28.360]  referred to as the new AIDS.
[55:28.360 --> 55:30.560]  And where's it come from?
[55:30.560 --> 55:36.040]  South America and the Caribbean chagas disease.
[55:36.040 --> 55:43.800]  And it starts out with fever and swelling and over the next 10 to 30 years, enlargement
[55:43.800 --> 55:49.600]  of the ventricles of the heart, heart attacks, 30% heart failure.
[55:49.600 --> 55:52.760]  Basically folks, it's a death sentence and government doesn't check.
[55:52.760 --> 55:53.760]  Schools don't check.
[55:53.760 --> 55:55.260]  There are dozens and dozens of parasites.
[55:55.260 --> 55:57.560]  I want to do a whole report on this soon.
[55:57.560 --> 56:01.280]  Such an important issue that they won't talk about because it's immigrant connected.
[56:01.280 --> 56:07.840]  Well, so what like Ellis Island, just check for it or shipments of, of, of, of lumber
[56:07.840 --> 56:14.600]  coming in, have these bugs on it to carry it amoebas, you name it, just shut it down
[56:14.600 --> 56:17.240]  or just test because there are treatments instead.
[56:17.240 --> 56:18.440]  They don't test for this.
[56:18.440 --> 56:23.680]  They'll give your daughter a Gardasil shot that in the trials, eight years ago, killed
[56:23.680 --> 56:27.280]  a bunch of people and is known to sterilize folks, give you autoimmune disease and the
[56:27.280 --> 56:33.360]  insert for the HPV vaccine to stop 4,000 people here dying supposedly admits it doesn't protect
[56:33.360 --> 56:35.680]  you from it and might give it to you.
[56:35.680 --> 56:38.800]  But women I know go, I gave it to my daughter just to say I don't want to get cancer.
[56:38.800 --> 56:43.880]  And I go, it, it read, you read the insert doesn't, whatever, I believe my doctor.
[56:43.880 --> 56:44.880]  Oh great.
[56:44.880 --> 56:47.120]  Just read the insert then Dumbo.
[56:47.120 --> 56:54.240]  But then meanwhile you get real stuff like chagas disease and things going on here and
[56:54.240 --> 56:58.880]  these bugs are in public schools, you name it now and there's just no reporting on it.
[56:58.880 --> 57:00.720]  So I'm glad the Daily Mail reported on it.
[57:00.720 --> 57:01.720]  This is the type of thing.
[57:01.720 --> 57:08.480]  Just to show how when there's something really serious, they won't talk about it.
[57:08.480 --> 57:13.120]  When there's something really hardcore like a mystery illnesses respiratory killing tens
[57:13.120 --> 57:15.440]  of thousands, it's in the back of the news.
[57:15.440 --> 57:19.360]  But then when they want to hype something up like a 10,000, 12,000 gun deaths a year,
[57:19.360 --> 57:23.240]  most of them suicide and I got to turn my guns in because somebody else has something wrong
[57:23.240 --> 57:27.240]  and guns frustrate crime 70 something times every time they're using crime.
[57:27.240 --> 57:29.600]  Don't confuse me with the facts.

[1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:19.480]  bin laden raid being a hoax but the fact that they would try to sell a hoax like this what
[1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:24.160]  does it mean that no one's buying it to where the seal that the third seal to others written
[1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:28.560]  books claiming they shot him has come out and said it doesn't matter if anyone killed
[1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:33.440]  bin laden that's close quote seen a headline i got so busy i'm gonna cover this the next
[1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:38.640]  segment i didn't even add in our special report inside sources bin laden's corpse has been
[1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:49.120]  on ice for nearly a decade that's from 2011 we have links to the clips with madeline albright
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:55.880]  former secretary of state benazar budo came out the president pakistan got killed right
[1:00:55.880 --> 1:01:03.080]  after it shane he's already dead and of course let us not forget walter cronkite so there's
[1:01:03.080 --> 1:01:07.080]  the deal no matter how many fake bin laden photos they put out and people think they've
[1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:16.960]  seen classified stuff it's all complete baloney so that's coming up in the next segment getting
[1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:26.080]  into other news here obama reportedly rejected g o p offer on amnesty and immigration reform
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:34.880]  because it wasn't complete and total because he wanted just total power and control and
[1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:41.120]  he's reportedly now yelled at joe biden the weekly standard reports during a meeting last
[1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:46.560]  friday with joe biden and others in the meeting and then bainer was in there along with secretary
[1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:53.040]  of defense hagel and obama was basically saying to paraphrase the article we're not gonna compromise
[1:01:53.040 --> 1:01:56.400]  anything i'm just gonna sign executive order legalize everybody and bainer was saying well
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:01.200]  you're gonna get in trouble for they can't do that give us time we'll compromise and
[1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:06.840]  biden said how much time do you need an obama cut him off and just basically said shut up
[1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:13.280]  so all is not well in paradise up there and i was back during the couple breaks i was
[1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:21.320]  back in the coffee room get a glass of water and i saw obama getting on his was leaving
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:27.240]  china was getting on air force one to go somewhere else they said to check on democratization
[1:02:27.240 --> 1:02:31.680]  in other countries spreading freedom yes while trying to take it here at home and he looked
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:37.800]  completely crazed and angry and nuts because even though he's a puppet a narcissist like
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:42.240]  that goes from you know seventy percent approval ratings and being the greatest things in slice
[1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:48.440]  bread to being anathema and a laughing stock even on the nightly news and on all those late
[1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:55.720]  night shows he doesn't like that one stinking bit believe me you think al gore likes being
[1:02:55.720 --> 1:03:02.600]  laughed at as well one more story before we go to break this is so interesting exclusive
[1:03:02.600 --> 1:03:08.320]  pilot to survive virgin spacecraft explosion tells how he regained consciousness on the
[1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:14.720]  way down to earth daily mail and gave the thumbs up to a passing aeroplane to say i'm okay
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:19.960]  now only being a cutting edge human you get to do that they say punched out at seventy
[1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:25.520]  thousand feet the other pilots had to bring it on the ground and crashed and died and
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:30.640]  imagine you're falling seventy thousand feet and then you pass a jetliner at thirty thousand
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:39.040]  feet in the busy corridor over california and you thumbs up them i mean that is awesome
[1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:42.120]  the only way humans are going to space the only way we're going to stay in the game and
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:46.920]  build technology to serve us and really empower us is to realize the globalists have decided
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:51.400]  to build it to enslave us and make us obsolete we've got to take technology and make sure
[1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:57.480]  it really improves us to dominate and continue on all of our ancestors fought and scraped
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:02.680]  and did battle with tigers and lions and huge cave bears twice the size of grizzly
[1:04:02.680 --> 1:04:07.200]  bears they've dug them up all over europe where groups as little as like fifteen men
[1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:14.440]  would kill a giant bear twice the size of a grizzly bear with stones and spears i mean
[1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:19.360]  you imagine how rough humans can really get like i saw a big university study out of england
[1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:24.280]  last year you can pull it up that our ancestors they've dug folks up in europe and africa
[1:04:24.280 --> 1:04:30.000]  had bones basically twice as thick that's how weak we've gotten domestication i guess
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:34.720]  the bible's right that we're degenerating from the days of noa not as strong i mean
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:39.560]  you imagine there used to be like guys used to take on bears with just wood spears and
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:45.920]  kill them you don't see that going on now we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen
[1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:58.600]  stay with us when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road
[1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:03.840]  but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets there's
[1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:16.560]  a place down in tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans they so pride in

[1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:18.000]  know one
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:19.280]  night
[1:06:19.280 --> 1:06:24.200]  hitler took the guns stalin took the guns male took the guns the olcastro took the guns
[1:06:24.200 --> 1:06:31.040]  and many of those saw this took the guns 1776 we'll commence again if you try to take our
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:36.800]  firearms the republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns
[1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:45.800]  I am sworn upon the author of God, internal hostility, against every form of tyranny over
[1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:47.800]  the mind of men.
[1:06:47.800 --> 1:06:54.800]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:59.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:05.800]  We're crazed, we love freedom, we wear our bias of telling the truth and being unapologetic
[1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:08.800]  about defending freedom on our sleeve.
[1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:15.800]  Now, I'm going to premiere for the radio audience a special report here, and then Dr. Pachinic will join us live after
[1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:22.800]  two segments to break it down because he was there with us 13 years ago, exposing that bin Laden was indeed
[1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:26.800]  dead from his sources in intelligence.
[1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:33.800]  And of course, Steve Pachinic ran psyops for the State Department that basically runs the other agencies, ran the Camp
[1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:36.800]  David Accords, founded Delta Force with General Boykin.
[1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:39.800]  So he said at the time, said they'd roll him out later.
[1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:40.800]  He did.
[1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:41.800]  Madeleine Albright went public.
[1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:43.800]  Others went public.
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:46.800]  Even the Benazar Budo, the Pakistani president, went public.
[1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:47.800]  They killed her like a week later.
[1:07:47.800 --> 1:07:49.800]  She said he'd been dead a decade before.
[1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:52.800]  So they need this hoax to stand.
[1:07:52.800 --> 1:08:00.800]  And the third Navy SEAL who claims she killed bin Laden has come out today.
[1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:03.800]  Here's the headline from CNN.
[1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:04.800]  Shooter.
[1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:07.800]  It doesn't matter anymore if I killed bin Laden.
[1:08:07.800 --> 1:08:10.800]  Former Navy SEAL says he fired the shot that kills someone bin Laden.
[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:12.800]  Says he doesn't care if people believe him.
[1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:18.800]  The most important thing I've learned the last two years is to me is it doesn't matter anymore if I'm the shooter.
[1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:19.800]  Said Robert O'Neill.
[1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:23.800]  I don't even know who Robert O'Neill is, folks, but they're using the SEALs for propaganda.
[1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:27.800]  They blew up the helicopter with 23 of them on, and I've talked to their families before.
[1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:28.800]  Anybody else did.
[1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:29.800]  I'm just saying we didn't make this up.
[1:08:29.800 --> 1:08:33.800]  When I on the limb when I covered it, got a lot of threats over it, but it later came out.
[1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:40.800]  The families went public and others saying they thought they murdered their sons to cover up the fact that they killed a body double.
[1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:51.800]  And when you see CNN with blue screens back in 1991 and blue screens a few years ago at Sandy Hook, not a location doing fake reports.
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:54.800]  I don't know how much of it's fake, but they're doing fake reports.
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:57.800]  And they've been caught doing it in MSNBC.
[1:08:57.800 --> 1:08:59.800]  Of course you don't believe them.
[1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:06.800]  If you want to see that video of CNN engaging in hoaxes and their ratings falling down to nothing and them getting dumped off major satellite systems.
[1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:09.800]  It's on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:10.800]  We just retweeted it.
[1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:14.800]  CNN death spiral special report.
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:16.800]  So we premiered that on the radio earlier.
[1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:24.800]  See the video that goes along with it of your radio listener on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and retweet it at real Alex Jones.
[1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:25.800]  Help us get it out to people.
[1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:30.800]  A very good report that they have at night put together today for the radio show.
[1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:34.800]  And we're not wanting to destroy CNN just because they're competition.
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:40.800]  They're a bunch of anti-gun, anti-family, anti-mail role model twits, anti-Christian.
[1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:43.800]  They're nothing compared to MSNBC, but that's collapsing as well.
[1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:45.800]  We're just showing you how they're collapsing.
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:51.800]  So that report, if you want to see it, not just hear it, is on infowars.com right now.
[1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:52.800]  Pay it forward to folks.
[1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:53.800]  That's how we spread the word.
[1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:59.800]  That's what we have millions of listeners today and they don't is because you are promoting freedom.
[1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:00.800]  It's a culture war.
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:04.800]  Now we'll play part of the report here, come back in the next segment and play the whole thing.
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:16.800]  But here is the report we did Friday night for the nightly news on the latest hoax claiming that bin Laden was indeed killed a few years ago.
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:23.800]  Here it is.
[1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:27.800]  And welcome back to this Friday edition of infowars nightly news.
[1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:40.800]  This is a special report, a special investigation to look into the supposed death back on May 2, 2011 of Usama bin Laden taken out by the Navy SEALs.
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:53.800]  Now we're going to try to go through this report as quickly as possible, but the amount of evidence proving that the official story is a contrivance, a fairy tale, is mountainous.
[1:10:53.800 --> 1:10:58.800]  We're going to move through it quickly here today from A to Z.
[1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:14.800]  First off, we're covering this obviously again because Robert O'Neill, a Navy SEAL veteran of 15 years, came out on Fox News yesterday and with the Washington Post as well and said that he indeed took out Usama bin Laden.
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:17.800]  Well, here's the problem.
[1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:30.800]  First off, remember Private Jessica Lynch who supposedly took out an Iraqi column, turned out she was hide in the back of the vehicle. It was all a Pentagon production to try to recruit women into the military.
[1:11:30.800 --> 1:11:36.800]  A bunch of members of her team started speaking out, started getting executed and dying in the US and overseas.
[1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:42.800]  And she came out and said it was a fraud, a recruiting tactic that I was ordered to be part of in Syops.
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:49.800]  Terry Bruckheimer got involved in advising the production of it in the so-called rescue days after the Iraqis had pulled out.
[1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:55.800]  Pat Tillman wouldn't be a propagandist anymore and so he was executed.
[1:11:55.800 --> 1:12:06.800]  He was taken out and it came out in the Army's reports later that he was indeed murdered and there was a highest level cover up of that as they get rid of people that are inconvenienced.
[1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:14.800]  So number one, there is a long, shorted history of this. Number two, Obama just was defeated in a big election.
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:17.800]  He needs to remind us that he took out Usama bin Laden.
[1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:21.800]  So that's one reason this guy pops up right on time.
[1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:28.800]  Now, I'm not putting down Robert O'Neill, but they know we trust Navy SEALs a lot more than Obama.
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:30.800]  Here's another problem.
[1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:37.800]  Two other Navy SEALs supposedly part of the raid who've written books on public have said months ago that this story isn't true.
[1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:40.800]  I have interviewed family members on air.
[1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:44.800]  We'll put some of those interviews on screen for you so you can go see them in full.
[1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:57.800]  Where they said right after it happened and then years later on my show that their Navy SEAL sons who had died, they believed were basically killed in that helicopter explosion
[1:12:57.800 --> 1:13:06.800]  to cover up the fact that it was really a Osama bin Laden body double who was actually working for the CIA that was taken out.
[1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:11.800]  And we're going to show a document cam here and then Robert is going to go over all these articles for everybody here and on.
[1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:18.800]  But we have over a hundred articles, most of them mainstream, showing that there was no body on the ship.
[1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:22.800]  They didn't dump him in the ocean. They tried to cover it up. It goes on and on.
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:27.800]  There wasn't a real situation room live feed going on.
[1:13:27.800 --> 1:13:32.800]  So that's the most frustrating part of our job is that we do the research day after day.
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:35.800]  We came out day one and show the anomalies.
[1:13:35.800 --> 1:13:39.800]  We predicted in 2002 that he'd already been killed with inside sources.
[1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:43.800]  They would later roll his body out at a politically expedient point.
[1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:55.800]  So we are deep researchers with major whistleblowers like Dr. Steve Pachennick, former head of Pentagon Psiops, exposing the fact that this would be rolled out at a later date.
[1:13:55.800 --> 1:13:56.800]  Got that right here.
[1:13:56.800 --> 1:14:00.800]  So we're going to break it all down here for you and you can check all of these sources.
[1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:07.800]  But the reason this is being brought out now is to try to get people recruited into the Navy that's having big problems and PR problems.
[1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:16.800]  But most importantly, as a political victory after the election to remind people that Obama supposedly took out Osama.
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:19.800]  So the whole thing is nothing more than smoke and mirrors.
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:28.800]  But remember, years after I interviewed the families, talked to Navy SEALs in person, it's come out in the news exactly what our sources told us.
[1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:38.800]  That the majority of the families believe they blew up that helicopter months after they supposedly took out bin Laden to shut up the SEALs that were talking about the fact that they showed up at the house.
[1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:43.800]  There was no security there and it was basically a body double that was set up.
[1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:48.800]  And it's later come out that the CIA was casing the joint using an inoculation program as the cover.
[1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:52.800]  So nothing about this has turned out to be true.
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:54.800]  Psi Hirsch pulled surprise winner.
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:56.800]  It's come out and said it's 100% false.
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:01.800]  Rob, do I want you to walk through some of this and then I'll get into some of the other angles.
[1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:08.800]  But again, it's hard to tackle a mountain of evidence like this, showing that the official story is a fraud.
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:13.800]  But I think the biggest issue is all the Navy SEALs on his team are saying different things.
[1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:14.800]  You can't agree.
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:15.800]  And that's the thing.
[1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:17.800]  When you have a bunch of people telling a lie, they can't figure out what the truth is.
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:20.800]  So they're just going to say different things and then say, no, you're lying.
[1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:21.800]  You're lying.
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:25.800]  You've got a couple of books written SEAL target Geronimo and No Easy Day.
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:26.800]  Don't agree with each other at all.
[1:15:26.800 --> 1:15:27.800]  And these are published books.
[1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:29.800]  And they're supposedly interviews with the CIA.
[1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:30.800]  All right.
[1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:31.800]  We'll be back.
[1:15:31.800 --> 1:15:32.800]  Stay with us.
[1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:40.800]  We'll come to the conclusion of the report and then get former top black ops, Psi Hop commander Steve Pacenek on to break down the fraud.
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:42.800]  Dr. Steve Pacenek coming up.
[1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:58.800]  Stay with us.
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:13.800]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries during that period.
[1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:32.800]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries during that period.
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:42.800]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries during that period.
[1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:49.800]  Stay with us.
[1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:37.800]  We have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries during that period.
[1:17:37.800 --> 1:18:02.800]  We have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries during that period.
[1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:07.800]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news.
[1:18:07.800 --> 1:18:09.800]  Info wars is the tip of the spear.
[1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:13.800]  Is this another force flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeland security?
[1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:15.800]  Are we sticking our hands down on our pants on the streets?
[1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:19.800]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[1:18:19.800 --> 1:18:22.800]  And that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:30.800]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:33.800]  What we see now is a war against reality. It's a war against the truth.
[1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:39.800]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv

[1:18:51.800 --> 1:18:55.800]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[1:18:55.800 --> 1:18:59.800]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:01.800]  Can you put two and two together?
[1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:06.800]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.

[1:20:03.800 --> 1:20:13.800]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:20.800]  Thomas Jefferson, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:20:20.800 --> 1:20:25.800]  In this segment, we're going to have about 80% of the time we need to air the rest of this investigative report.
[1:20:25.800 --> 1:20:32.800]  But I'm having one of our writers right now post it to the top of infowars.com.
[1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:38.800]  The full videos, you can see the documentation, the news articles, the quotes, the history, the video clips.
[1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:43.800]  That'll be on infowars.com and prisonplotter.com in the next 15, 20 minutes or so.
[1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:46.800]  We're going to air more of the investigative report in a moment.
[1:20:46.800 --> 1:20:48.800]  But I'm not joking when I say this.
[1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:55.800]  A London independent virus that makes humans more stupid, discovered.
[1:20:55.800 --> 1:20:58.800]  And it's an algae found in the water supply.
[1:20:58.800 --> 1:21:03.800]  John Hopkins found it by accident while studying throat microbes.
[1:21:03.800 --> 1:21:07.800]  We've talked a lot about algae being connected to a lot of these lung diseases and brain damage.
[1:21:07.800 --> 1:21:14.800]  And again, I just talked about these parasites infecting 300,000 Americans causing heart attacks and all sorts of mental problems.
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:17.800]  But no one will test for that when you go to the doctor.
[1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:21.800]  But they'll freak out all day about stuff that doesn't matter.
[1:21:21.800 --> 1:21:26.800]  I'm telling you, they'll end up putting this on the water on purpose to make us dumb.
[1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:27.800]  It's like a fluoride.
[1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:28.800]  What do you think vaccines are?
[1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:30.800]  They're IQ reducers.
[1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:33.800]  It's social engineering.
[1:21:33.800 --> 1:21:37.800]  And they're coming out with vaccines that they call stress relieving vaccines.
[1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:43.800]  They want to give the troops that are live viruses that go and eat part of the brain.
[1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:47.800]  So you get a lobotomy basically via virus.
[1:21:47.800 --> 1:21:52.800]  See my investigative report from four years ago, brain eating vaccines on YouTube.
[1:21:52.800 --> 1:22:01.800]  Speaking of investigative reports, here is the bin Laden death hoax special report with the latest info video on info wars.com.
[1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:06.800]  Rob, do I want you to walk through some of this and then I'll get into some of the other angles.
[1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:13.800]  But again, it's hard to tackle a mountain of evidence like this, showing that the official story is a fraud.
[1:22:13.800 --> 1:22:17.800]  But I think the biggest issue is all the Navy SEALs on his team are saying different things.
[1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:18.800]  They can't agree.
[1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:19.800]  And that's the thing.
[1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:22.800]  When you have a bunch of people telling a lie, they can't figure out what the truth is.
[1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:25.800]  So they're just going to say different things and then say, no, you're lying.
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:26.800]  You're lying.
[1:22:26.800 --> 1:22:30.800]  You've got a couple of books written SEAL target Geronimo and No Easy Day.
[1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:31.800]  Don't agree with each other at all.
[1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:32.800]  And these are published books.
[1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:35.800]  And they're supposedly interviews with the SEALs, interviews with the teams.
[1:22:35.800 --> 1:22:38.800]  One of them is even written by one of the SEALs on the raid.
[1:22:38.800 --> 1:22:45.800]  Who doesn't agree with Rob O'Neill about who was in there first and who actually got the shot off that killed bin Laden.
[1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:49.800]  Now, first thing, here we did back in 2011 in May, Paul Joseph Watson.
[1:22:49.800 --> 1:22:52.800]  10 facts that prove the bin Laden fable is a contrived hoax.
[1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:54.800]  There you go right there.
[1:22:54.800 --> 1:22:58.800]  Before that, we published the fake situation room photos, which we're going to put up on.
[1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:01.800]  We said they were fake. They admitted a week later they were fake.
[1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:02.800]  Exactly.
[1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:04.800]  We brought up the 10 facts that have now been brought up in Congress.
[1:23:04.800 --> 1:23:05.800]  Exactly.
[1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:12.800]  And then you have Obama coming out on a 60 minutes interview and saying, we didn't even know if it was the Prince of Dubai in this compound.
[1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:13.800]  We weren't even sure.
[1:23:13.800 --> 1:23:16.800]  So they didn't even have the correct intelligence.
[1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:19.800]  And then later you have the administration won't release bin Laden records.
[1:23:19.800 --> 1:23:22.800]  And then AP did a Freedom of Information Act request.
[1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:24.800]  And here they are from March 15, 2012.
[1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:30.800]  The Pentagon told the AP this month it cannot locate any photographs or video taken during the raid or showing bin Laden's body.
[1:23:30.800 --> 1:23:36.800]  It also cannot find any images of bin Laden's body on the Navy aircraft carrier where the Al Qaeda leader's body was taken.
[1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:40.800]  The Pentagon said it cannot find any death certificate, autopsier report, DNA identification.
[1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:47.800]  And this is a year after the people on the ship by the hundreds said there was no body, no funeral.
[1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:49.800]  They claimed a funeral and then everyone had seen it.
[1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:52.800]  They're on and then they start court marshaling them to shut them up.
[1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:53.800]  Exactly.
[1:23:53.800 --> 1:23:56.800]  And it's not like they didn't have any DNA material of Osama bin Laden.
[1:23:56.800 --> 1:23:59.800]  He'd been visiting a hospital in the months before 9-11.
[1:23:59.800 --> 1:24:01.800]  This came out of Lafiguero.
[1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:08.800]  Two months before September 11, Osama bin Laden flew to Dubai for 10 days of treatment in an American hospital where he's visited by the local CIA agent.
[1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:11.800]  And that's one of the biggest publications in France.
[1:24:11.800 --> 1:24:12.800]  This is in the Guardian.
[1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:13.800]  In the Guardian, yeah.
[1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:21.800]  And then we have a transcript from a 2002 interview with you and Steve Pacinac where he's talking about he was already dead, that he had a kidney problem.
[1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:23.800]  And that wasn't even well known.
[1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:27.800]  And then President Musharraf said they destroyed his dialysis machines in the caves of Afghanistan.
[1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:35.800]  And I've had the former head of Pakistani intelligence that ran the CIA operations against the Russians on Hamid Ghul concurring with our analysis.
[1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:40.800]  And then you go to the ship, leaked bin Laden, not buried at sea, body moved on CIA plane to the U.S.
[1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:42.800]  That's not what they told us first.
[1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:43.800]  They said we buried him at sea.
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:48.800]  And then you go to the aircraft carrier, leaked bin Laden, not buried at sea, body moved on CIA plane to U.S.
[1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:51.800]  That's directly opposite of what they said. They buried him at sea. They washed him.
[1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:54.800]  They did it all according to Muslim tradition, which doesn't exist.
[1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:55.800]  There are no barriers.
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:25:03.800]  And Stratford, that's basically a CIA propaganda outfit here in Austin, one of the most prominent even on the Bilderberg, they came out.
[1:25:03.800 --> 1:25:09.800]  And when the emails got leaked, they were saying, say that we brought him to the U.S. to counter Alex Jones.
[1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:10.800]  There you go.
[1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:12.800]  And then no sailors saw bin Laden's body buried at sea.
[1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:19.800]  And then they started just charging naval officers from that vessel, saying they were for drug use and distribution.
[1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:22.800]  So they're trying to cover their butts in every situation.
[1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:24.800]  The most court marshals ever for a ship.
[1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:25.800]  There you go.
[1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:32.800]  So bin Laden was buried at sea from the Carl Vinson in May after the Al Qaeda leader was killed in a raid by U.S. Navy Seals on his Pakistan hideout.
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:34.800]  The ship normally has 5,000 sailors.
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:43.800]  As I said, it was unknown if any of the sailors were displaced.
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:48.800]  So again, we've got Reuters here, but then we've got them later in the Associated Press saying a totally different story after Stratford tells them to come out with this new story to quote counter Alex Jones.
[1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:52.800]  So again, I'm not bragging when I say we've been following this day one.
[1:25:52.800 --> 1:25:54.800]  It's not like where Johnny come lately.
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:26:06.800]  I met with a Navy SEAL who was active duty, whose friend blew up on the helicopter and he talked to their family and said they talked to other SEALs and that they believe Obama's on board and that Obama was getting rid of them.
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:11.800]  Well, then years later, I get other families on to say the exact same thing.
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:13.800]  And then now it's even on Fox News.
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:16.800]  So what I'm saying is we had the intel day one.
[1:26:16.800 --> 1:26:17.800]  We were proven accurate.
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:18.800]  This isn't about us.
[1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:22.800]  It's that our sources were correct and it's all been born out.
[1:26:22.800 --> 1:26:24.800]  So we know what really happened.
[1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:25.800]  He'd been dead a long time.
[1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:33.800]  They went and set up some guy that looked like him, enough like him to fool and to mess with the minds of the SEALs who aren't sure.
[1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:36.800]  Then they blow up a helicopter on the ground to confuse things.
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:40.800]  A couple of months later, they blow up another helicopter with 23 SEALs.
[1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:42.800]  They said no training, no mission preparation.
[1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:44.800]  They'd never been on a mission like this.
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:46.800]  They fly them out and they get blown up.
[1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:47.800]  I mean, this is a major setup.
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:48.800]  Keep going through it.
[1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:53.800]  And BBC even released a report where they interviewed neighbors and none of them ever even saw bin Laden.
[1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:55.800]  In the five years he was supposedly there.
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:26:56.800]  They had never seen him.
[1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:01.800]  And then you have that crazy video that came out of the guy saying that the helicopter landed.
[1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:04.800]  Then it was taken off and it blew up and there were bodies everywhere.
[1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:06.800]  So who knows what happened that night?
[1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:07.800]  We're never going to find out.
[1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:10.800]  That's why you have to create all these fake books and Hollywood productions.
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:11.800]  You know, with Catherine Bigelow.
[1:27:11.800 --> 1:27:14.800]  To make it a fiction.
[1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:15.800]  To make it a legend.
[1:27:15.800 --> 1:27:18.800]  But that's what I was told day one by the SEALs.
[1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:23.800]  Is that no, they blew up the helicopter taking off and nobody shot at it.
[1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:25.800]  They'd already taken the guys out in the house.
[1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:26.800]  Limited resistance.
[1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:29.800]  And then they really figured out when the second helicopter blew up.
[1:27:29.800 --> 1:27:30.800]  These aren't stupid guys.
[1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:32.800]  This is an operation against us.
[1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:33.800]  We're being useful idiots.
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:34.800]  That's what they said.
[1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:35.800]  We're being taken out.
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:38.800]  And so now this guy comes out.
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:41.800]  He didn't get killed that night when the helicopter blew up.
[1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:44.800]  He didn't get killed when the other SEALs all from this mission got crammed on.
[1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:46.800]  And he's now out here.
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:47.800]  Robert O'Neill.
[1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:49.800]  And the other SEALs don't agree with him.
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:50.800]  So who's lying?
[1:27:50.800 --> 1:27:51.800]  Is it the other SEALs?
[1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:53.800]  Or is it Robert O'Neill?
[1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:54.800]  Are they all lying?
[1:27:54.800 --> 1:27:57.800]  They could all be telling part of a tale just to keep it confused.
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:27:58.800]  It's called a smoke screen.
[1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:00.800]  It's a propaganda technique that they use.
[1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:02.800]  And they throw out a lot of different things.
[1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:03.800]  You're not sure what's going on.
[1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:04.800]  Is he got...
[1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:06.800]  And then even all the guys that wouldn't play ball?
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:07.800]  They're dead.
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:08.800]  Dead men tell no tales.
[1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:09.800]  And that's the sad thing about this.
[1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:12.800]  Because you do have these SEALs that go on dangerous missions.
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:14.800]  They've got some top secret clearances.
[1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:16.800]  They're out there putting their lives on the line.
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:17.800]  And now...
[1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:18.800]  They're commando's fives.
[1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:19.800]  Right.
[1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:20.800]  And now they're part of this whole fabrication.
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:23.800]  And it's really sad to see that it's still going on after all these years.
[1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:25.800]  We put out tons of reports about this stuff.
[1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:26.800]  Day one we came out and said...
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:27.800]  All right, folks.
[1:28:27.800 --> 1:28:28.800]  It wasn't...
[1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:29.800]  There's three or four more minutes.
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:32.800]  And he gets into his uncle who's an AVC old with some key info.
[1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:37.800]  So see the full report on infowars.com and prisonplanted.com.
[1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:39.800]  And retweet it at Real Alex Jones.
[1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:43.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny with more on how Psyop works.
[1:28:43.800 --> 1:29:12.800]  Straight ahead on Alex Jones.
[1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:42.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.

[1:35:28.800 --> 1:35:56.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:35:56.800 --> 1:36:23.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:51.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:36:51.800 --> 1:37:18.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:37:18.800 --> 1:37:46.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:37:46.800 --> 1:38:14.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:36.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:39:05.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:32.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:59.800]  Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:28.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:40:29.800 --> 1:40:56.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:41:22.800]  Dr. Steve Pacieny.

[1:41:52.800 --> 1:42:21.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:51.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:42:52.800 --> 1:42:58.800]  When you're out on the road, the last place you wanna be is on the road.
[1:42:58.800 --> 1:43:04.800]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[1:43:04.800 --> 1:43:23.800]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:31.800]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[1:43:31.800 --> 1:43:35.800]  You can learn jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans.
[1:43:35.800 --> 1:43:38.800]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:42.800]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:47.800]  So you can ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com.
[1:43:47.800 --> 1:44:13.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:44:13.800 --> 1:44:41.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:44:41.800 --> 1:45:10.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:39.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:49.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:36.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:46:36.800 --> 1:47:01.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:12.800]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:15.800]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:47:15.800 --> 1:47:16.800]  We'll be back.
[1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:28.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:47:28.800 --> 1:47:38.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:23.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:48:23.800 --> 1:48:51.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:48:51.800 --> 1:49:20.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:45.800]  We'll be back with Dr. Steve Pacieny.
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:51.800]  Let me put it this way. We have a phenomenal country.
[1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:55.800]  Unfortunately, we don't have leaders that are equivalent to the greatness of our country.
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:49:57.800]  What do I mean?
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:02.800]  Despite all of the problems that we've recently had, the Ebola epidemic, what happened?
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:07.800]  The military did not weigh general density at its initiative.
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:16.800]  There were 4,000 brave men and women in our army to Liberia, not just to have them contaminated
[1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:18.800]  or be contaminated on the contrary.
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:22.800]  What was used was intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance.
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:27.800]  They took all the drones from Afghanistan to Pakistan and used it over the Liberian Sierra Leone
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:33.800]  to monitor and evaluate the degree of the crisis in the Liberian Sierra Leone.
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:38.800]  In turn, they developed hospitals where, in turn, they had a command and control system
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:42.800]  which overrode the CDC and the non-existent of the Surgeon General.
[1:50:42.800 --> 1:50:44.800]  So the civilians failed.
[1:50:44.800 --> 1:50:46.800]  The President of the United States failed.
[1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:48.800]  The CDC failed.
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:51.800]  The Director of the CDC failed and the Public Health Service failed.
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:54.800]  As a result, our military went in command and control mode.
[1:50:54.800 --> 1:50:56.800]  It did not ask for permission.
[1:50:56.800 --> 1:50:59.800]  It was very successful in building the capability.
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:04.800]  The Ebola epidemic will be ceased and stopped because of that and because of their initiative.
[1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:08.800]  In turn, we have a Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper.
[1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:12.800]  It's been in our system for over 30 years and has not been...
[1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:15.800]  And it was asked to resign and refused to resign.
[1:51:15.800 --> 1:51:20.800]  Repeatedly, even though Obama denigrated him publicly saying that the intelligence wasn't good enough,
[1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:28.800]  that this past week he was able to extradite and extract two American citizens quietly from North Korea.
[1:51:28.800 --> 1:51:32.800]  So we have an amazing military under General Martin Dempsey.
[1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:36.800]  He's very modest, very quiet, and very effective.
[1:51:36.800 --> 1:51:42.800]  The problem is, within our military corps, we've had the Braggadocio, the self-aggrandizing man.
[1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:44.800]  That came out of the Navy.
[1:51:44.800 --> 1:51:46.800]  Why the Navy?
[1:51:46.800 --> 1:51:53.800]  Because, in turn, the Navy was very responsible or reacted inappropriately to the commands and control of Bush Jr.,
[1:51:53.800 --> 1:52:00.800]  John Brennan, the CIA, and this, I go back to Admiral Mullen, McRaven,
[1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:08.800]  Admiral McRaven, the head of Special Forces, who should never, never have used the Navy in any way for propaganda
[1:52:08.800 --> 1:52:16.800]  or promoted his own self-aggrandizement in saying that he killed specifically Osama bin Laden.
[1:52:16.800 --> 1:52:22.800]  Nor should the President of the United States lie to the American public that Osama bin Laden was killed by him or anybody else.
[1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:28.800]  But since you started talking about this on my show 13 years ago, now it's admitted it's so clear from being outside government.
[1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:30.800]  Or was it a lie? Of course it was.
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:34.800]  But it's so clear. It's so clear, though, that there are interagency wars.
[1:52:34.800 --> 1:52:44.800]  The FBI fighting with the CIA, the NSA fighting with the CIA, but then they're all lined up generally attacking the actual armed services
[1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:48.800]  because that's the only thing that goes back to George Washington.
[1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:51.800]  That's the only thing they haven't taken over completely.
[1:52:51.800 --> 1:52:55.800]  And they know the military isn't going to take the guns. They know they're awake.
[1:52:55.800 --> 1:52:57.800]  They know they're like the best people we've got.
[1:52:57.800 --> 1:53:04.800]  And so that's why there's this open demonization of the veterans, which is jumping the shark, Dr. Pachennick.
[1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:08.800]  Well, this is exactly what I'm trying to say. We said this for a long time.
[1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:12.800]  Number one, the CIA really has to be scrubbed out and cleaned out.
[1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:18.800]  Brennan has to be fired. And so do the DDOs, the covert operatives, and the DIP analysts.
[1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:26.800]  For too long, and for a very long time, they've been on the influence of the Bush family, the Clintons, and others who went to Yale.
[1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:28.800]  It is a disastrous organization.
[1:53:28.800 --> 1:53:33.800]  For the 30 years that I've been in and out of government, I could rarely rely on the CIA.
[1:53:33.800 --> 1:53:36.800]  They are experts on 9-11 and stand down.
[1:53:36.800 --> 1:53:41.800]  There was no question that the man who told me this was the stand down worker, Paul Wolfowitz.
[1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:51.800]  There's no question that the Jewish neocons who were involved, Wolfowitz, Earl, Elliot Abrams, and those have to be brought up for trial and tribulation.
[1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:53.800]  There's no question that Bush and Cheney.
[1:53:53.800 --> 1:53:57.800]  But until we do that, this government will not be cleaned up soon.
[1:53:57.800 --> 1:53:59.800]  And by the way, Dr. Pachennick, you're Jewish.
[1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:08.800]  Yes, I am. I'm very proud I'm Jewish, but I'm not proud of those who backed it against our government and those who inspired the Israelis to work against our own interests.
[1:54:08.800 --> 1:54:13.800]  So Israel and being Jewish does not mean you're Jewish in temperament or so.
[1:54:13.800 --> 1:54:19.800]  Most of the Americans really don't care whether you're Jewish or Christian or Muslim, but they do care that as you're American.
[1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:33.800]  Unfortunately, Americans, you have no idea of their own history of the anti-Semitism and the fact that they were manipulated into a position where they created this 9-11 stand down and Israel was in fact involved with Mossad operas.
[1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:37.800]  That's not fictitious. That's not theoretical. That's a fact.
[1:54:37.800 --> 1:54:41.800]  Sure. How many countries were involved? Saudi Arabia clearly as well.
[1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:48.800]  Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, the ISI, the ISI of Pakistan. That's the inter-service intelligence service of Pakistan.
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:57.800]  You're talking about Israel and Mossad operas who were ready in my house in June before that 9-11 and you're talking about the United States.
[1:54:57.800 --> 1:55:01.800]  Listen, I got visited by a major Mossad operative.
[1:55:01.800 --> 1:55:07.800]  Well, yes, but you know the Mossad in Israel is insignificant to Israel now. It was to America.
[1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:11.800]  They are a strategic liability. David Petrae has said it. I've said it.
[1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:15.800]  Now I know, but you also got visited and threatened by British intelligence, basically, correct?
[1:55:15.800 --> 1:55:21.800]  Well, the British have been involved. The British are secondary countries. They're not relevant to the United States.
[1:55:21.800 --> 1:55:25.800]  The United States is only relevant to itself and its position in the world.
[1:55:25.800 --> 1:55:31.800]  Well, listen to me. You co-wrote books with Tom Clancy. You're a famous spy. You're well-known with the army, the rest of it.
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:33.800]  You're not making this stuff up from your perspective.
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:48.800]  I'm not making it up. I said it 13 years ago. Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice are very much responsible as well as Steve Hadley.
[1:55:48.800 --> 1:55:52.800]  Well, Condoleezza Rice called Mayor Willie Brown and said, don't fly to New York tomorrow.
[1:55:52.800 --> 1:56:00.800]  And again, I just want to be clear. There's a lot of criminal groups, whether it's U.S., Israel, Britain, Pakistan, all of them have criminal groups within.
[1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:06.800]  Manipulating, keeping people in the dark. But there are radical Islamists that are being funded and allowed to attack.
[1:56:06.800 --> 1:56:17.800]  And I really loved it a month ago when General Dempsey was in there being grilled by that little guy, the Senator on the Armed Services Committee, Lindsey Graham.
[1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:25.800]  And Graham said, there are no Muslims, you know, countries funding ISIS. And Dempsey said, of course they're funding it. We're basically funding it too.
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:34.800]  So I do see that Dempsey stopped the attack on Syria and that the military is saying no to a lot of this.
[1:56:34.800 --> 1:56:43.800]  So I think America is always calling for military coup. I think what you're getting at is there's kind of a soft coup, a soft refusal to take the guns to start the Civil War.
[1:56:43.800 --> 1:56:57.800]  Our military will never attack the civilians. I can assure you that. However, our own civilians will attack civilians, i.e. the CIA, the President of the United States, three of them, Clinton.
