[02:58.280 --> 03:02.760]  lecturing us on a default as well as the head of the IMF as America becomes like a third-world
[03:02.760 --> 03:08.480]  country the ebt cards failing and the looting that went on then the ebt cards turning back on
[03:08.480 --> 03:14.320]  and giving it unlimited money just all the other news that we've got up on info wars calm and
[03:14.320 --> 03:21.560]  prison bonnet calm the article that went viral last night at Watson put out in California where
[03:21.560 --> 03:31.240]  the transvestites transgenders all different types imagine being a boy in high school and then
[03:31.240 --> 03:34.560]  being able to say you're transgendered so you can go look at the girls in the bathroom and
[03:34.560 --> 03:38.320]  I just can't imagine it the trouble that would have caused when I was in high school and in
[03:38.320 --> 03:41.680]  middle school for that matter and the girls said they're going in and harassing them and
[03:41.680 --> 03:49.120]  messing with them I personally have witnessed a very famous transvestite in Austin Texas
[03:49.120 --> 03:54.600]  Leslie Cochran before he died this is about a decade ago at access TV by the way he was thrown out
[03:54.600 --> 03:58.880]  of access over they were as liberal as you could get they celebrated him thanked him for being there
[03:58.880 --> 04:02.600]  he would come there with his buddies and go back and forth in both bathrooms and totally
[04:02.600 --> 04:07.600]  freak out families kids you name it they're like well let him go in both bathrooms folks
[04:07.600 --> 04:13.400]  were talking about doing drugs in the bathroom vomiting all over the place I mean if it was a
[04:13.400 --> 04:18.040]  redneck guy doing it or an old woman doing it everybody be freaked out and this is freaking
[04:18.040 --> 04:23.040]  people out it's all part of the social manipulation to see what the establishment can get away with
[04:23.040 --> 04:29.600]  I don't make fun of Bradley Manning I think Bradley Manning's a hero and if he thinks he's a woman
[04:29.600 --> 04:37.720]  or whatever and what's it called Brandy Manning Chelsea Manning whatever doesn't matter I mean I
[04:37.720 --> 04:42.200]  mean I think the guy really did a good job releasing that information I don't think they're
[04:42.200 --> 04:52.120]  make jokes about him and his sexual vision of himself or herself my point is is that there's
[04:52.120 --> 04:56.560]  a lot of other people that just use it as a way to grandstand and take over society with the

[10:34.680 --> 10:44.440]  uh that indeed it is simply a data mining data theft database for the democratic party just
[10:44.440 --> 10:50.040]  like facebook and twitter are on record they give all that data over to the obama noids as well
[10:50.600 --> 10:57.240]  to harvest the sheeples votes and tax money and regulatory systems so we're going to be
[10:57.240 --> 11:03.880]  discussing uh all of uh that today as well and i would like to challenge the obama supporters

[11:55.320 --> 12:00.120]  screen calls but i want john harman to really screen these and and and make sure they don't
[12:00.120 --> 12:05.000]  start laughing because half the calls that come in will be people joking i don't want jokes okay and
[12:05.000 --> 12:12.360]  a guy in an mpr voice i want the real deal now the main way to tell them is they'll actually be
[12:12.360 --> 12:18.200]  laughing at you and be on a power trip and call you racist so that's who i want on i want the real
[12:18.760 --> 12:23.240]  deal i want you to hear it because i see them on youtube i see the folks on info wars dot com

[12:52.040 --> 12:57.160]  that works two jobs anybody that's an entrepreneur stole it and then they're allied with the most
[12:57.160 --> 13:03.560]  vicious criminal offshore mega banks that run giant chinese and indian basically slave camps
[13:03.560 --> 13:10.280]  and mexican close to slave labor camps and robots replacing humans at fox com and suicide
[13:10.280 --> 13:15.640]  nets and forced abortions and children by the millions chained up defenses and light poles all

[13:23.480 --> 13:29.080]  rice and then give it to their child i mean that's what we're competing with you can't compete with
[13:29.080 --> 13:35.800]  a slave state while the communist inner party lives in giant command bases with in some cases
[13:35.800 --> 13:42.040]  hundreds of mistresses and and and helicopters and just totally organic food it's all on record
[13:42.040 --> 13:48.120]  they don't take any of the shots none of the gmo their own secret farms for non gmo growing the food
[13:48.120 --> 13:54.440]  in greenhouses so all the toxic fallout from all the huge chemical plants doesn't get it that's come
[13:54.440 --> 13:59.720]  out in mainstream news that china has in the times of london's reported it secret gardens for the

[14:19.800 --> 14:28.280]  hour instead they're just replacing them instead they're paid 20 cents an hour their death camps
[14:28.280 --> 14:36.200]  literal death camps is what the chinese slave cities are then they've got the the the the liberal
[14:36.200 --> 14:42.200]  trendy cities where the party members and any and and inner party members are allowed to live
[14:42.200 --> 14:47.560]  where they live in luxury and bullet trains and glistening high-tech systems better than
[14:47.560 --> 14:52.760]  anywhere in the world incredible medical advances and they don't let all the poor people into those
[14:52.760 --> 14:59.240]  areas if a poor person gets caught coming into those key districts they're beaten to death or
[14:59.240 --> 15:05.560]  the the chinese police will cut a man's genitals off and then stab them a couple of times with
[15:05.560 --> 15:11.320]  precision trained stabbing just to make them a time to make them bleed to death over a year
[15:11.320 --> 15:16.120]  to death over two days and then the chinese population has been trained do not help the
[15:16.120 --> 15:21.160]  person or you're responsible for them so there's just villagers and farmers and poor people
[15:21.160 --> 15:27.880]  bleeding to death all over the streets i'm serious this is in the news but back of the paper so i
[15:27.880 --> 15:32.600]  want to hear from you you think the people the globalists that set up china put malatang and
[15:32.600 --> 15:38.280]  power in 49 are using china to leverage out the whole world as a race to the bottom you think
[15:38.280 --> 15:45.560]  they want to give you something free because they love you i want to hear from you i want to hear
[15:45.560 --> 15:53.000]  from you they got mobile execution vans in some cities 24 operating 24 hours a day executing
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.800]  people you talk back to the police you're executed you get caught shoplifting to get food for your
[15:59.800 --> 16:07.320]  children you're executed you're taken to sports stadiums and and in the old days and everybody
[16:07.320 --> 16:13.720]  comes and claps and they machine gun you men women young children you know 10 12 years old there's
[16:13.720 --> 16:18.200]  there's photos and videos online youtube tries to take them down because they don't they love
[16:18.200 --> 16:21.880]  china so much in the communists they don't want you to know but you can still find them you see
[16:21.880 --> 16:26.680]  the just type in chinese executions and guys you don't need to do it people can look at it if they
[16:26.680 --> 16:33.560]  want to watching us on tv you can see kids lined up being ak-47 in the back of the head and then
[16:33.560 --> 16:38.120]  the commies just have celebrations after they machine gun people because they get off on it
[16:38.120 --> 16:43.080]  now that's in the old days now they load you on the execution vans the organs are chopped out flown
[16:43.080 --> 16:49.080]  into japan that's only an hour away on average and then there's rich westerners there to get the goods
[16:49.960 --> 16:55.800]  they wear a warehouse fall on gong for practicing their buddhism it's not really buddhism it's not
[16:55.800 --> 17:01.480]  even it's one end of its spiritual it's like buddhism light or zen buddhist lights an exercise thing
[17:01.480 --> 17:09.640]  they don't eat gmo they try to be healthy they have healthy organs so they warehouse them dna
[17:09.640 --> 17:13.720]  type them and and then they when the call comes in just like the movie the island where they take
[17:13.720 --> 17:17.880]  you and take your organs they actually do that you're taken and executed everything is taken
[17:17.880 --> 17:25.000]  including blood tissue you name it and um freeze dried for the elite person it's also sold with
[17:25.000 --> 17:32.200]  it all in the same dumpling package to be shipped back to america or to europe or to japan just total
[17:32.200 --> 17:40.680]  health force and you need to understand the reason this is important is that the globalist this is
[17:40.680 --> 17:46.120]  their ideal society that and they're actuaried it out to incrementally phase that in here let me
[17:46.120 --> 17:52.600]  give you an example of what i went through today i'll either go swim in the river the colorada
[17:52.600 --> 17:55.560]  or barton springs or i'll run on the treadmill in my garage
[17:58.360 --> 18:03.400]  or i will go to the hiking bike trail and jog we have one of the biggest hiking bike trails is
[18:03.400 --> 18:08.520]  the giant barton creek greenbelt complex in the country it's farmers and ranchers property they took
[18:08.520 --> 18:13.080]  at gunpoint in the last 30 years first they don't let you use it then they devalue the price then
[18:13.080 --> 18:18.200]  they sold most of it off to the insiders and their friends but the the the hundred thousand plus acres
[18:18.200 --> 18:28.200]  in just one area that they have is constantly off limits now if anything happens they just gated
[18:28.200 --> 18:34.360]  up and then give people tickets if you enter it but people complained to the city so i checked
[18:35.640 --> 18:40.840]  actually they have special green police units who aren't even police who aren't even working with
[18:40.840 --> 18:45.720]  the city they're the ones that put up the tape in fact this morning i got there and had been tape
[18:45.720 --> 18:50.360]  had been torn down so there was eight members of a green police unit by the way i have video of them

[25:23.480 --> 25:28.520]  police shooting everybody but that's okay and then this morning i walked by people in green
[25:28.520 --> 25:38.040]  state funded as i talked to some of them repair group that was supposedly repairs the the green
[25:38.040 --> 25:44.040]  belt so they don't wash out which is fine and dandy on a giant green belt or you could just
[25:44.040 --> 25:49.480]  leave it wild and let people fend for themselves but the issue is i walked by and they go that's
[25:49.480 --> 25:54.680]  how he just went past the yellow tape he's not supposed to do that and then i was i was fading
[25:54.680 --> 26:01.800]  off walking away i heard the word police show i come back up the hill after a couple of mile jog
[26:03.560 --> 26:09.080]  i see him i start talking to him they go hi i have this on video hi alex jones i'm a listener
[26:09.080 --> 26:15.800]  i'm a fan i didn't count them all it was eight or ten that was the first two that were down the hill
[26:16.360 --> 26:22.520]  and i thought okay well maybe the police aren't at the top of the hill i get there police pull in
[26:22.520 --> 26:28.840]  and they were looking at me real predatorily till i didn't really bow up but i got real excited
[26:28.840 --> 26:33.720]  because i was gonna explain to them how ridiculous it was and hoping they'd give me a ticket because
[26:33.720 --> 26:38.120]  i talked to my ex who said they were down there giving people tickets and i said you know i i made
[26:38.120 --> 26:46.440]  some inquiries i checked and these hiking bike trails are not closed and the lady cop goes
[26:47.160 --> 26:51.800]  that's right she's like freaked out by it because she could have just written me a ticket and i
[26:51.800 --> 26:55.480]  could have gone to court and the jury would have been dumb and they'd have got me it's like oh my
[26:55.480 --> 27:01.560]  gosh one that knew oh that's right it's just no watercraft on the on the creek which is already

[27:07.880 --> 27:17.560]  check and i went really so then they get out of their cars and i jog back down and jog back up
[27:17.560 --> 27:25.240]  up i was halfway up so i was was tired i was walking back up and here they come doing their
[27:25.240 --> 27:30.280]  inspection and you have to understand how giant this green belt is i mean it's half as big as the
[27:30.280 --> 27:37.160]  city all the people's land they've grabbed and the point is they didn't used to do this before it
[27:37.160 --> 27:41.000]  it's all parts it's like shut down the national parks i guarantee you they ever have a city shut
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.200]  down whole people hostage always grow in their tax base we have the worst zoning group it's all

[33:18.920 --> 33:24.680]  i'm india from fema region six formerly austin texas now on their own official maps we've been
[33:24.680 --> 33:30.520]  to the gen 21 meetings they openly say we are the center of the takeover of the entire state
[33:31.080 --> 33:38.920]  to turn it uh un blue basically i mean they're military they're teaching everybody their slaves
[33:38.920 --> 33:43.480]  and the whole attitude of government's changed everywhere and they want to shut things down
[33:43.480 --> 33:47.800]  they want to teach you just like uh the times i've been to london every time i'm there they
[33:47.800 --> 33:53.800]  shut down major roads every day randomly and they announce if you're on a tour bus because it's the
[33:53.800 --> 33:59.320]  queen's pleasure she wants you to know she owns this road because if you don't exercise a right it
[33:59.320 --> 34:05.880]  doesn't exist so the queen randomly shuts down rivers streams parks palaces that are really
[34:05.880 --> 34:13.640]  public centers museums and major roads and that's all they're doing they're just teaching you that
[34:13.640 --> 34:18.760]  you're a slave and if you're foreigners on a tour bus the first day of the shutdown you pull into
[34:18.760 --> 34:23.480]  yellowstone they're gonna point guns at you and hold you in the hotel for two days because
[34:23.480 --> 34:32.360]  they're here to let you know that you're a slave and i was just talking to welton henson down at
[34:32.360 --> 34:39.080]  the water cooler down at the probe pier and he said i got my socialist health care today instead
[34:39.080 --> 34:43.560]  of telling me the story about he's been out of the air force i got seven eight years he's been
[34:43.560 --> 34:48.600]  working here seven years uh and he was just talking about how much worse the va gets and how it's an
[34:48.600 --> 34:53.480]  example of socialist health care and how the mean the police are and how they bug their eyes out at
[34:53.480 --> 34:57.880]  people and what else they were doing and just how every time he goes it's worse because yet to get
[34:57.880 --> 35:01.640]  your va care you got to go every year have blood taken so they can spy on you and put it in databases
[35:01.640 --> 35:06.280]  and see how the vaccines they injected in you know what those did to you because they use them for
[35:06.280 --> 35:10.840]  guinea pigs on record that's on record secret testing on the troops thousands of times uh
[35:10.840 --> 35:15.080]  thousands of major projects including lethal lethal operations you are the number one enemy
[35:15.080 --> 35:19.640]  and returning veteran absolutely uh show number one enemy uh how was it when you went to the va
[35:19.640 --> 35:24.200]  today it's a pretty prime example of what's you know what a socialist health care system is you
[35:24.200 --> 35:29.240]  know you go in there you take your number there's all sorts of people yelling at you you know
[35:29.240 --> 35:33.880]  yelling out numbers and if you you know old vets are trying to stand up and get over to them you
[35:33.880 --> 35:38.920]  know they're not quick enough the guy's like you know number 251 you hurry up you know and
[35:39.560 --> 35:42.600]  you wait you wait well you said the cops are bugging their eyes out at everybody all in the
[35:42.600 --> 35:46.120]  strutting around the cops walk around and they're all bugging your eye bugging their eyes out at
[35:46.120 --> 35:51.240]  you you know we'll repeat what you said by the water cooler oh yeah well you know you take two
[35:51.240 --> 35:56.440]  hours just to get uh you know 30 seconds of blood drawn and you wait numbers and everybody's confused
[35:56.440 --> 36:03.560]  and and then uh every time you walk in or leave you know they've got way more than enough uh
[36:03.560 --> 36:08.280]  police officers there i mean they're just all just kind of you know well these are the vets
[36:08.280 --> 36:12.440]  these are men these are the enemy yeah yeah yeah so we have an occupied government there's just a bunch
[36:12.440 --> 36:16.920]  of other from the most part it's a bunch of like old veteran uh vietnam veterans and stuff kind of
[36:16.920 --> 36:21.000]  walking in on canes and stuff you know and they have these big military guys way way more than
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.720]  they need just walking around just gawking at you and i walk well you told me they bugged their
[36:25.720 --> 36:29.560]  eyes out of oh yeah but well you know i guess i'm kind of young and healthy looking so they
[36:29.560 --> 36:33.400]  they really want to bug their eyes out at me well they hate that yeah anybody that's got anything
[36:33.400 --> 36:38.840]  out of just man then i walk out in the park a lot and there's a uh veterans affairs police officer
[36:38.840 --> 36:45.800]  and in his uh um police car really similar to the nsa vehicle that we had roll upon us you
[36:45.800 --> 36:51.320]  remember that and he's riding parking tickets to people out there so i thought that was kind of
[36:51.320 --> 36:55.720]  humorous it's not it's not funny but it uh were they parked wrong or did he was he running their
[36:55.720 --> 36:59.720]  plates or what uh well you know one was a motorcycle didn't have anywhere to park so they
[36:59.720 --> 37:03.800]  kind of parked up front and that was i guess a big no no and oh that's nothing these cops all
[37:03.800 --> 37:08.280]  just pulled up in the neighborhood blocking the street too they just pulled up like they were
[37:08.280 --> 37:13.640]  god and parked out in the road swaggered up soon as i wasn't afraid they all look scared
[37:13.640 --> 37:18.120]  then they were given uh i guess you know they have spots there's the big new va outpatient clinic
[37:18.120 --> 37:22.440]  there and Austin just opened a few months ago it's huge and they have i guess fuel efficient
[37:22.440 --> 37:26.280]  vehicle parking only and stuff like that so if you're not a fuel efficient vehicle for you know
[37:26.280 --> 37:30.440]  if i if i would have parked my f-150 in there i guess i'd have got got a ticket so well no it's
[37:30.440 --> 37:35.640]  all about their protected classes are special like in the public schools the transvestites can go
[37:35.640 --> 37:40.280]  and look at the girls on the toilet and harass them and if they complain hate crime on the on the
[37:40.280 --> 37:45.160]  on the on the 12 year old girl i just you know i just thought it was uh crazy i'll walk out and
[37:45.160 --> 37:49.000]  and it's just a lot of it's just a lot of veterans good meaning people i saw a bunch of
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.800]  good meaning people they're just trying to get health care and they're sitting in there for
[37:51.800 --> 37:56.360]  hours waiting on simple health care and then you go out in the parking lot and there's these big
[37:57.160 --> 38:01.080]  uh you know veterans affairs police officers you know bugging their eyes at you and they're
[38:01.080 --> 38:05.080]  writing parking tickets to to vet because you're a nice fellow you say hi to people that's what
[38:05.080 --> 38:10.040]  i've noticed at national parks and more and more you say hi or even wave or whatever they just bug
[38:10.040 --> 38:13.400]  their eyes at you because you're the enemy absolutely every time i walk walk in there i
[38:13.400 --> 38:16.920]  say hi to people i even at the cops and and they're all standing by the door you know and they're
[38:16.920 --> 38:20.840]  all looking like you know that's like they're one ready for battle or something and i'm always like
[38:20.840 --> 38:24.680]  hey how's it going they're just like mmm well it's because the foreign banks took over they
[38:24.680 --> 38:30.120]  got armored vehicles helicopters it's time for war i mean listen i i've i've lived in austin
[38:30.120 --> 38:36.440]  25 years i've been on that hiking bike trail i don't want to exaggerate a thousand times i've
[38:36.440 --> 38:41.640]  never seen when i see there's no green police down there that'll boss you around uh tattletale
[38:41.640 --> 38:46.040]  citizens yesterday a woman ran up a hundred yards and said you can't go on the trail it's closed and
[38:46.040 --> 38:52.440]  got mad when i said i'm gonna go anyway and she ran off it's like living in the twilight zone here
[38:52.440 --> 38:58.840]  in austin texas there's no doubt about that a bunch of power hungry goons it's a bunch of
[38:58.840 --> 39:02.760]  nobodies that's what it is it's all it's all pettiness it's just like people are more worried
[39:02.760 --> 39:06.280]  about trying to be powerful than anything else it's like they don't even want to be successful
[39:06.280 --> 39:10.520]  just want to be powerful in their own little way we have those discussions don't we yes it's
[39:10.520 --> 39:14.440]  it's like a virus or something where people don't want to actually be successful they want to imagine
[39:14.440 --> 39:19.720]  they're powerful and be obstructionist like almost everybody that's activists that have come from
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.040]  nowhere that no one ever heard of we build them up we give them a platform trying to build a resistance
[39:24.040 --> 39:28.760]  they then flip out and want to bring us down yeah and and say we've attacked them and we've done
[39:28.760 --> 39:32.920]  nothing but give them just a carpet of gold politically it's not about being successful
[39:32.920 --> 39:37.640]  it's about having your little petty power trip it's about tearing others down i'm telling this
[39:37.640 --> 39:43.000]  country's in deep trouble it's uh well that's what the so-called left ones with obama care
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.960]  they want to get rid of the middle class they want everybody poor absolutely misery loves company
[39:50.440 --> 39:53.480]  i guess if they're going to be miserable they want to make it see i can't handle it when cops
[39:53.480 --> 39:57.480]  are bugging their eyes out of me i just started getting in their face i did today those cop cars
[39:57.480 --> 40:01.560]  pulled up bugging their eyes out i ran over to them i was like give me a ticket come on it's

[42:10.280 --> 42:13.880]  it's a mentality you know it starts from the top and moves down i can remember being the military
[42:13.880 --> 42:17.880]  and there were just people that just sat around trying to make rules all day and procedures and
[42:17.880 --> 42:22.040]  policies that's what they did they just sat around is like if you made the most policies and rules and

[42:56.280 --> 43:01.000]  tosh plum was going to pop in with a fox news update he says they betrayed him when he went on
[43:01.000 --> 43:06.200]  fox news last week big whistleblower on vengasi he'll pop in for like 10 minutes but i want to open
[43:06.200 --> 43:14.920]  the phones up now for obama noids supporters here's the toll free number 800 259 92 31 and i'm not
[43:14.920 --> 43:20.600]  trying to be mean i know you've had a lot of fluoride a lot of gmo a lot of mcdonald's growing up i
[43:20.600 --> 43:25.720]  understand you watch a lot of television but if you happen to be listening and you want to call in
[43:25.720 --> 43:30.200]  and have a victory dance on the health care system being wrecked because they're now saying oh this is
[43:30.200 --> 43:34.920]  our plan to wreck it to bring in total socialism oh yeah the foreign banks that run all this they
[43:34.920 --> 43:38.920]  really want to give you something free i'd like to hear from you now to call in and tell me i'm wrong
[43:39.800 --> 43:48.600]  or maybe you want to admit we're right now but 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31
[43:48.600 --> 43:59.400]  800 259 92 31 we want to hear from you on air and then after we take some obama supporter calls
[44:00.680 --> 44:05.480]  some obama care support i mean are you proud of the of the riot police that by the way the
[44:05.480 --> 44:12.840]  austin parks police were wearing the same weird blue uniform that the riot police in dc were wearing
[44:12.840 --> 44:18.280]  it's like you in blue on the top and then darker blue on the bottom naturally the cops weren't
[44:18.280 --> 44:24.840]  that mean i mean they had obviously been called there on me and then we're like aghast that they'd
[44:24.840 --> 44:32.120]  been called in on the dangerous evil alex jones uh we're again i don't even bow up to cops i just
[44:32.120 --> 44:36.760]  have let's take a combination of laughing that that there's actual green police showing up and i
[44:36.760 --> 44:41.480]  was laughing at them and it's not like laughing on purpose to make them feel bad i can't help it
[44:41.480 --> 44:47.560]  that the three cop cars come shooting up bugging their eyes out at me and as soon as i started
[44:47.560 --> 44:53.160]  laughing and turning my camera on the the the the the seriousness went right off their face just
[44:53.160 --> 45:01.160]  because his country's so screwed up and they know it oh they actually destroyed stamps that
[45:01.160 --> 45:05.480]  showed kids playing sports last week because the thought police said they're not allowed
[45:05.480 --> 45:11.560]  they're actually banning bringing nerf balls to school to play before school during recess or
[45:11.560 --> 45:18.440]  after that's all we ever did nerf footballs are banned very evil if kids are seen playing with
[45:18.440 --> 45:23.320]  nerf guns in their backyard the thought police call the school they know who to tattle and the
[45:23.320 --> 45:30.200]  kids kicked out of school and the police uphold it then these are not knitting liberals these are
[45:30.200 --> 45:36.600]  authoritarians they give you free laptops they're not free their taxpayer paid for to watch you from
[45:36.600 --> 45:44.600]  kansas to pennsylvania to california to canada to england they've caught to germany the free
[45:44.600 --> 45:51.480]  school laptops watching the kids because it's a program of course they're watching you over the
[45:51.480 --> 45:57.160]  built-in cameras and microphones it's now declassified they they're total criminals the government is
[45:57.160 --> 46:03.800]  total criminal doesn't mean the average mid-level minions a bad person but the bad guy is captaining
[46:03.800 --> 46:09.720]  the ship and an a obama it's el diablo and i'm telling you it's just going to get more
[46:09.720 --> 46:16.600]  spacey and weird and out of control from here and the good news is liberty is rising humanity is
[46:16.600 --> 46:20.920]  waking up yeah there it is herrington high school use laptop webcams and spoiled students at home
[46:20.920 --> 46:29.480]  suit alleges no no no the school did a promo video showing showing that they were watching them in
[46:29.480 --> 46:34.120]  the shower they called the police on them because a girl was eating skittles an 11 year old was
[46:34.120 --> 46:42.120]  eating skittles in her underwear go look at the lawsuit and the media acted like these parents are
[46:42.120 --> 46:47.560]  suing how dare them they thought she was taking drugs they would look like pills thank god they're
[46:47.560 --> 46:51.720]  watching her and then it cuts to the resource officers how they first found out about it
[46:51.720 --> 46:56.440]  you know i'm yeah we watch the kids and if they're doing something bad at home we take a picture
[46:56.440 --> 47:01.000]  and show it till the next day and say you shouldn't have done that and it's like twilight zone twilight
[47:01.000 --> 47:08.520]  zone twilight zone that's like a case out of kansas again no no no no this case was tennessee
[47:08.520 --> 47:13.400]  it was another one kansas it was a case in tennessee about seven years ago where the where the middle

[47:18.360 --> 47:23.800]  buses i never took showers after football whatever i was stunk it went home you know and they would
[47:23.800 --> 47:28.920]  always give us junk food hamburgers on the bus my way back but the point was is that they go into
[47:28.920 --> 47:35.000]  the showers some people did take showers but the point is is the 11 and 12 year old girls go in
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.080]  they're taking showers they see cameras in the showers freak out their parents are out waiting

[48:00.200 --> 48:10.200]  he's past the tape well we need to put up more tape police as i'm going down the hill police maybe
[48:10.200 --> 48:13.880]  neighbors called the police on me because again you come up to a trailhead there's a neighborhood
[48:13.880 --> 48:20.040]  nearby and a woman in a car 100 yards away gets out runs over and says you don't go she was asian

[48:47.320 --> 48:52.920]  to support the overlord the dear one our god our king our lord our savior our lovey dovey

[49:08.120 --> 49:15.000]  then i'm going right to your calls when we come back uh briefly we sold out of the nation iodine
[49:15.000 --> 49:25.160]  again so more is on the way they are producing it at the top organic lab in the country and
[49:25.160 --> 49:29.640]  let me tell you we tried to go get it from other suppliers and i'm not knocking other people it
[49:29.640 --> 49:34.360]  tastes like rocket fuel and and and it's terrible and we've had it looked at it's breaking down it's
[49:34.360 --> 49:39.560]  not real nascent iodine i've been told by my sources and doctor group and others this is probably
[49:39.560 --> 49:43.480]  the only real nascent iodine in the country and i'm not i mean that's why i did a year of research
[49:43.480 --> 49:51.000]  on this went with them but it's a smaller lab so they are literally at full capacity to produce this
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.560]  the other stuff we've tried competitors we can't sell it it tastes so horrible i'm not being mean
[49:55.560 --> 50:00.520]  it just it it's it's alcohol based even the glycerin based ones i don't know what's going on
[50:00.520 --> 50:05.400]  the group we use is so amazing and if you want to get it it might be a couple of weeks till you get

[56:16.040 --> 56:21.560]  phone here who should we talk to steve joe prophet adolf kyle which one sounds real john harman
[56:21.560 --> 56:29.320]  joe in new york tell me tell me about how great obama care is sir i think obama care is a wonderful
[56:29.320 --> 56:33.320]  of boost economy in canada a lot of the industry has moved for united states moved to canada because
[56:33.320 --> 56:39.160]  they have free health care and uh boost economy and create a great uh system uh they're free uh
[56:39.160 --> 56:44.120]  free medicine for everything and when you reach us through the wealth everything gets better and
[56:44.120 --> 56:49.720]  the economy improves and uh and that's why we should that's why we should have a 100 percent tax on
[56:49.720 --> 56:55.720]  it on state tax and they have a tax rate of rate 70 that we wasn't in the 1950s well the democrats
[56:55.720 --> 57:00.840]  do support that but you know the ultra rich put their money in tax refundations and offshore so
[57:00.840 --> 57:04.840]  they want all the estate tax of the middle class to get rid of it do you understand elites throughout
[57:04.840 --> 57:10.760]  history are at war with the middle class that's an admitted sociological anthropological anthropological
[57:10.760 --> 57:17.240]  fact are you aware of that yes though obama is actually kind of a nice guy he uh you know he
[57:17.240 --> 57:21.880]  should be probably a president for life and perhaps uh you're being sarcastic all right who
[57:21.880 --> 57:28.840]  else is real here who else do we have is anybody real it's true that most obama supporters cannot
[57:28.840 --> 57:35.480]  dial telephones kyle in pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead hey alex um first of all i think
[57:35.480 --> 57:42.200]  there's a lot of problems with the obama care plan the way that it is today but um i do think
[57:42.200 --> 57:50.120]  that in some way shape or form the government needs to step in and set rules set limits and have there
[57:50.120 --> 57:56.440]  be some sort of overseeing body in the health care division well i mean if the archangel gabriel
[57:56.440 --> 58:01.160]  was going to oversee a socialist system just for health care i would support it but see satan
[58:01.160 --> 58:06.520]  basically oversees it the eugenicist oversee it and so anything they give us will be a screw job
[58:06.520 --> 58:10.760]  and the bigger it gets the bigger the screw job is do you understand that criminal special
[58:10.760 --> 58:15.640]  interest wrote this yeah i i i absolutely understand that the insurance companies were
[58:15.640 --> 58:23.160]  involved in this inception but i also think that as the health care plan gets implemented and as we
[58:23.160 --> 58:31.480]  go along once people see it's inferior form today there's going to be a resistance to it there you
[58:31.480 --> 58:35.800]  go and then the demand to bring in full socialism that's the talking point i've heard stay there i
[58:35.800 --> 58:46.760]  want to come back and hear that this is a plan folks this is gcn the genesis communications radio

[1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:26.440]  a state federal or city park or county park then they ban the vehicles on the existing
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:34.920]  roads that were there including paved roads then they get the the mountain bikers and the regular
[1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:43.080]  folks the hikers to call for a ban on cars then they ban the cars except for the police vehicles
[1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:47.320]  then they have the hikers call for the ban of the mountain bikers
[1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:51.160]  and then they ban humans all together and now they're banning you heard it national

[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:24.120]  tattletales who i ran into this morning and you see i was there yesterday did this video covering it
[1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:28.440]  had a woman come up and tell me i shouldn't be on the green belt because it rained the other day
[1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:35.160]  and in today i heard the green volunteer police say hey alex jones is here hey we you know he

[1:03:21.720 --> 1:03:28.360]  the point when pimps on shows about pimps and hoes say i pay my bitches nothing that's what this is

[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:56.120]  scripts got the mountain bikers and the hikers a lobby to ban motorized vehicles then they got
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:04:00.920]  the hikers a lobby and banned the mountain bikers now when it rains they just closed the trail to
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:08.680]  hikers because god forbid someone walks down the trail and makes a footprint in nature i
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:15.560]  admitted the expletives get a job you fat hippie so the next person says to someone saying we
[1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:25.480]  shouldn't be on there and and again austin in one swath in was it 1996 stole 40 000 acres
[1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:29.320]  that they'd already not let people use for a decade and they said you know what we still keep

[1:08:52.600 --> 1:09:00.200]  going to go to you in just a moment but first off rachel madel janet rino's daughter
[1:09:00.760 --> 1:09:07.960]  me excuse me big sister's daughter came out and demonized the vets now i covered this yesterday
[1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:13.720]  on monday from the sunday show the democratic party website actually calling the world war two
[1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:19.960]  vets racist because one person out of 10 000 plus it's estimated to have shown up because it was
[1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:24.040]  uncoordinated in different demonstrations had a rebel flag patch on their jacket
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:29.640]  that could just mean you went through on a motorcycle trip to georgia usually it's just
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:34.440]  about pride and heritage and states rights but regardless you don't blame a whole group
[1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:40.680]  for wearing a rebel flag off of that now they're basically saying they're all racist
[1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:46.520]  and then madel lied because i've checked and followed this the dc police the federal police
[1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:52.440]  they are all being paid they're seen as essential services 83 percent of the government is still
[1:09:52.440 --> 1:09:59.240]  operating 83 percent now the debt default is another issue entirely they could still put
[1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:02.840]  that off for months for for three months they said that there was a zero percent increase
[1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:06.360]  in the national debt because they hadn't passed the debt increase they could just do that again
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:10.280]  and just make it up and say we don't need to default because there's been a zero increase it's
[1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:16.920]  all just made up fiat 1.5 quadrillion fake derivatives that goldman sacks jp morgan
[1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:22.680]  wells fargo bank of england all of made so they're holding his hostage but there's a little reality
[1:10:22.680 --> 1:10:27.320]  to a debt default down the road which they hold his hostage with but she came out and said none of
[1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:34.040]  them were paid and the vets threw barricades at them we've looked at the footage the vets
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:38.040]  carried the barricades and took them to the white house as a gesture saying you're not
[1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:42.280]  going to block this and the vets when the police were trying to billy club them said we're not violent
[1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:47.320]  and then push the cops back and the police will wisely didn't beat their brains out like they
[1:10:47.320 --> 1:10:52.120]  normally would because you know what's going to happen when you attack those veterans we've had enough
[1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:57.560]  we know there's tyranny in this country and we're sick of it and now forbes has had their
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:02.600]  tech people analyze the obama care exchange it's fake like mike adams who's a really smart programmer
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:08.120]  folks i don't people that know programming that know him and say he's genius level in many aspects
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:13.880]  he looked at it broke it last week here that it's fake all it's doing is getting your data
[1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:17.880]  and they've tracked where the data is going the national security agency that's why their
[1:11:17.880 --> 1:11:23.080]  computers literally caught on fire last week with the traffic how about burning the lines up
[1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:29.560]  it got so hot in there with power surges it blew the computers up so even their data snooping
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:35.480]  isn't working they're such greedy criminals to get all your data so we're going to go to kyle but
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:44.520]  i want to play for you rachel madel a lying pig a lying disinfo agent this is a lying slob
[1:11:44.520 --> 1:11:48.920]  they've got other people on there that go through to say i'm deeply racist behind the
[1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:53.400]  boston bombing and then show no proof my lawyer said hands down you will win this with a jury trial
[1:11:53.400 --> 1:11:57.160]  but it'll cost hundreds of thousands and they'll just pay it with tax money they get in stimulus
[1:11:57.160 --> 1:12:01.800]  money do you want to spend all your time going to trial and i said how long do i have this two
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:09.480]  years and i said no i'm not litigious but man if any harm comes to me if some one of your
[1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:14.200]  mental patient viewers one of your low IQ viewers blows me away saying i'm a clan member or
[1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:19.880]  something i want it on record i want all of you sued personally okay if one of your wind up just
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:23.400]  like the southern prairie law center guy went in the family research council and shot a bunch of
[1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:26.680]  people saying because you know southern prairie law center said they were racist or whatever
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:30.840]  that happens to me you're going to be held accountable you understand that
[1:12:32.440 --> 1:12:36.920]  one of your moron viewers i mean you've got the dumbest viewers you sit there and lie to
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:41.320]  make me sick we're gonna go back to kyle and others here in a minute obama supporters but
[1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:46.760]  here's rachel madow saying the cops aren't paid that's on record alive and saying that the military
[1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:51.720]  the veterans attacked these toilet attendant looking i mean i mean these police are wearing the same
[1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:57.400]  uniform as the park police so this is like the new star trek this is the liberal brigade outfit here
[1:12:57.400 --> 1:13:03.640]  it is so the protesters rally with the two republican senators who led the way for the shutdown
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:09.720]  mike lee and ted Cruz expressing their outrage that the things they want to be open are closed
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:14.760]  now because of that shutdown they've then picked up the barricades that were around the closed
[1:13:14.760 --> 1:13:21.000]  world war two memorial and dragged the barricades over to the white house and hurled the barricades
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:25.720]  at the white house then the protesters went home so the police who threw no fault of their
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:30.760]  owner working without being paid the police had to pick up those barriers let's stop right back
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:34.760]  to where they came let's stop right there folks i've tracked this and we've covered it but let's
[1:13:34.760 --> 1:13:39.080]  pull it up to prove she's a liar i want an article done on this those aren't dc police but they're
[1:13:39.080 --> 1:13:44.360]  being paid essential service the federal police are being paid the federal security guards it's
[1:13:44.360 --> 1:13:50.600]  all on record that none of that shutdown this is absolute bull she's lying to reviewers again
[1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:56.760]  and then she said the republicans don't like what they like being shut down they hired extra people
[1:13:56.760 --> 1:14:03.080]  to go put up barricades to keep people out of open malls i've been to dc there's no one there
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:07.880]  but security guards to come over and harass you if you try to videotape i've been to the world war
[1:14:07.880 --> 1:14:14.360]  two memorial there's two federal security guards there you liar now there's like 50 we've seen
[1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:20.680]  the live feeds we've had reporters there you are a dirtbag liar i'm calling you out scum
[1:14:21.640 --> 1:14:26.680]  i'm sorry go back to her go back to it go back drag them back to where they came from
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:30.440]  and keep working their shifts without being paid because the shutdown that these folks
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:35.160]  made happen hit pause hit pause hit pause did you notice they edited where the cop attacked the vet
[1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:41.480]  first and then the vet oh my gosh just like nbc got caught editing the uh the uh the trayvon
[1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:48.840]  bar my god i didn't even pick that up the first time i saw it play that again play that again
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:55.560]  man you these people are an enemy force they are really occupying the country because of the shutdown
[1:14:55.560 --> 1:15:00.120]  that these folks made happen back a little more back it up back it up 20 show you listen if you're a
[1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:07.080]  tv viewer it's the same footage we showed sunday and analyzed the veterans come up they're putting
[1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:13.480]  the the fencing down and the cops ram them so the veteran pushes back they edited that out
[1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:20.040]  that'd be like if they uh showed reginald any having his head beaten and said that he assaulted
[1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:26.280]  the people or that'd be like if they animated rodney king beating cops with a club and then cut to the
[1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:32.600]  i mean it's just totally made up that is just have a graphic of like kennedy firing machine guns
[1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:37.400]  that's why somebody shot him in the head you they could do that with a computer technology
[1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:40.920]  kennedy was actually going to shoot out in dallas and people know that he had a
[1:15:40.920 --> 1:15:45.160]  howitzer in the front of the car and was firing it folks this is the same group
[1:15:46.680 --> 1:15:50.520]  with bill gates involved and all the rest of it i i'm actually having a meltdown right now
[1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:54.600]  in there i can't even believe what i just saw i need one of the riders to do a report on this
[1:15:54.600 --> 1:16:04.040]  this nbc edits video nbc edits video to frame veterans play it again because i just saw that
[1:16:04.040 --> 1:16:07.400]  they edit the clip where the cop attacks the veteran play it through no fault of their
[1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:12.680]  owner working without being paid the police had to pick up those barriers drag them back to where
[1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:17.080]  they came from and keep working their back it up again because i've seen that footage so much
[1:16:17.080 --> 1:16:23.480]  the cops push first then the veteran and the cop push each other and it appears to be edited we've
[1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:27.080]  got to check that play that again police who threw no fault of their own are working without being
[1:16:27.080 --> 1:16:32.440]  paid the police had to pick up those barriers dragged them back to where they came from and
[1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:36.120]  keep working their shifts without being paid because of the shutdown that these folks made
[1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:41.160]  happen vaguely threatening but right there is what they do it patent they don't show the whole
[1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:47.160]  exchange we have them now but it doesn't matter their viewers don't even know kyle i'm sorry go
[1:16:47.160 --> 1:16:50.680]  ahead and tell us why you support obama care i apologize for making you hold go ahead sir
[1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:56.280]  no and you know let me just this might upset you but i'm not an obama supporter i'm much more
[1:16:56.280 --> 1:17:01.880]  along the lines of like webster partly where i do think that there should be certain social
[1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:07.880]  thinking that's for the population um i mean there's no reason that vik cheney should have
[1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:14.840]  an anatomical heart and no pulse but if i were in an insane situation i would be dead and from my
[1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:22.360]  perspective the only body the only governing body they can they can sort of set the rules or
[1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:27.000]  or equal things out is the government because the insurance companies aren't going to do that
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:37.400]  capitalism isn't going to do that well here's the problem socialism always ends up collapsing
[1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:48.040]  socialism never works in the end because the corruption creeps into it and if you look at
[1:17:48.040 --> 1:17:52.760]  obama care written by the insurance companies they didn't have a hand in it they brag they wrote the
[1:17:52.760 --> 1:17:58.840]  whole thing it's already doubled everyone i know is premiums including poor people and it's pushing
[1:17:58.840 --> 1:18:02.920]  them out of the system where they'll just pay the fine and then still have no health care and then
[1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:09.320]  charity care will take care of them but you said before the break you said that well this will just
[1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:15.560]  wreck it further and then we'll finally get justice listen there's no amount of socialism that will
[1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:21.080]  end up giving the dependent class enough to take care of themselves and then it does create more
[1:18:21.080 --> 1:18:26.200]  dependency and then a source of entitlement and does degenerate societies are you denying that
[1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:33.800]  well it's it's no what i'm saying is that obama care is in its flawed form that it is now is
[1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:40.520]  you know for better or worse a step in a direction where eventually you know when people's premiums
[1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:45.480]  do start to go up and they realize that walmart has exceptions and and you know mcdonald's
[1:18:45.480 --> 1:18:50.440]  doesn't have to do this for their employees that in a in you know in a perfect world people would
[1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:55.880]  resist and people would push back and they would demand equality and so that no matter
[1:18:55.880 --> 1:19:01.880]  how much money you have no matter you know what status you hold in the community you get the things
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:06.440]  no no no you're absolutely right this is the thought process of people like you who aren't bad
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:10.520]  folks and you sound like you're pretty smart at a certain level you're not looking at history
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:15.800]  they're going to raise taxes on the middle class out of this and it's going to take everything over
[1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:22.360]  until everyone is basically poor except for offshore banks and then you will get socialized
[1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:33.240]  death care like england union and and union's workers did not do great things for the wages of
[1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:38.360]  american workers undoubtedly if you go back in the last hundred years unions did a lot of good
[1:19:39.160 --> 1:19:43.400]  but but now they've become corrupting forces that vote to open the borders up and drive down
[1:19:43.400 --> 1:19:49.240]  wages and support nafta and gat and support shipping general motors to china the the the
[1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:54.920]  unions are there to sell america out now the big ones undoubtedly and then in other areas of the
[1:19:54.920 --> 1:19:59.240]  country to harass people that are trying to hold on by their fingernails that aren't part of their

[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:42.760]  and we now went and checked the raw footage msnbc did indeed edit out the police initiating the
[1:24:42.760 --> 1:24:51.800]  attack on the veterans nbc news so they're credited on sunday actually aired where where the police
[1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:58.120]  initiated it mad out the entire thing she says the man half clip is a lie she says these police
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:03.720]  aren't paid that they threw barricades at the police which never happened and that they attacked
[1:25:03.720 --> 1:25:10.360]  the police and that republicans only want things they want open no they don't want five times to
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:17.560]  ten times the police like the grand canyon or the world war two memorial called out to wire shut

[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:23.160]  mexican marines and joint task force six out of fort blitz texas to stop drugs while the black side

[1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:33.400]  talk about what happened to him because he put it out on his facebook that we'll put up on screen
[1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:38.120]  for folks and i'll give him the address that this is endangering his life and he again is a famous
[1:40:38.120 --> 1:40:42.520]  whistleblower of the church committee if you just joined us and then the viran contra and you ask
[1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:46.040]  how's he still working government because there's a light side of government he doesn't work in

[1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:19.400]  tosh blumbling to that he doesn't want to be called a hero but he's one of the most famous
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:26.280]  whistleblowers at 76 years old alive today he flew arms in the fifties to fidel castrow

[1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:53.640]  they did do we have tosh blumbling yeah you're on okay i'm on there alec yes sir okay hey thank
[1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:59.800]  you for having me back on i do appreciate that you bet uh i know i know it uh i know we have
[1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:06.520]  time restraint here so i'll try to recap the best i can uh sometime back i have 11 questions
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:12.520]  pertaining to ben gawson i won't go into those 11 questions right now i directed those 11 questions
[1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:18.120]  to our elected officials that were involved in the investigation of ben gawson basically the
[1:42:18.120 --> 1:42:24.760]  question was why did u.s weapons show up at crime scene how did they get there who authorized
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:29.240]  to ship another weapon through the direct commercial program to go into countries in the
[1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:37.080]  middle east to be transported by contractors di contractors uh and safe houses from jordan
[1:42:37.720 --> 1:42:43.400]  into various factions of operations in the middle east whether they the seren rebels
[1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:49.240]  factions that infiltrated the seren rebels all that made did not matter my question was
[1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:56.120]  who did the authorization to ship the weapons with c 130 then the daughter of jordan turkey
[1:42:56.120 --> 1:43:03.880]  in the process of that uh fox news contacted me i thought that's what we were going to talk about
[1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:13.960]  also i thought uh the situation with kiki camarena and his death came up uh and uh i knew kiki i'd
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:22.040]  flown kiki uh and um there was some documentation about the thing that kiki had run into kiki
[1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:29.160]  camarena was killed in 1985 executed he was actually ratted out by elements within the cia
[1:43:29.800 --> 1:43:36.280]  not because he had found a marijuana farm in carl finteros ranch but because he had stumbled
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:43.160]  on to a very secret operation uh run out of the united states shipping weapons down to the southern
[1:43:43.160 --> 1:43:52.520]  front uh in costa rica to uh arm the southern front of the iran contra um operation but they
[1:43:52.520 --> 1:43:57.000]  were also funding the communists as well that's what's really important well that's right that
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:03.640]  was uh for the people of the young generation that hasn't studied that sandanita uh and uh
[1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:13.720]  southern front was farmed um and a secret airbase was uh made down in uh san alina costa rica weapons
[1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:20.600]  were going to costa rica drugs were coming back from that area to finance the operation of the gun
[1:44:20.600 --> 1:44:27.640]  going south two people found out about that uh kiki camarena dga agent and also a marine
[1:44:27.640 --> 1:44:33.960]  colonel by the name of james the bow out of marina el toro naval air station his command had run into
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:39.480]  what they thought at first was a drug running operation going through el toro but later turned
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:44.120]  out that he found out about the gun this was what i thought we were going to talk about on
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:52.440]  spot it got up to where i explained the details behind the kiki camarena murder uh kidnapping
[1:44:52.440 --> 1:45:00.360]  also his politics was shot by the front of kiki kiki was uh had to bury his politics friend
[1:45:00.920 --> 1:45:05.240]  and they hit kiki over the back of the shovel and broke the shovel and drug him in the house
[1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:12.440]  and tortured him for two days and kept him alive it was not over marijuana that that man was killed
[1:45:12.440 --> 1:45:21.800]  it was over the fact that he had found out about the cia thing a mexico's cia thing known as operation
[1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:30.200]  penetrate that's what god kiki camarena killed that's what i was trying to tell fox news box news
[1:45:30.200 --> 1:45:36.280]  i thought i could trust i'm not mad at anybody i'm not upset i'm you know i'm not gonna let myself
[1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:41.800]  on your air get upset i'm gonna try to relate exactly what happened now tell people who show
[1:45:41.800 --> 1:45:48.680]  you went on what happened all right i was uh was filmed for 45 minutes telling basically everything
[1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:55.480]  i'm telling you and then when it aired it was cut out and it placed the impression to me and other
[1:45:55.480 --> 1:46:05.560]  people that uh i was the cia pilot no it wasn't a cia pilot i was the pilot that had flown
[1:46:06.680 --> 1:46:16.360]  uh when carol carl from the buffalo rank to guatemala so that the dfs the mexican police
[1:46:16.360 --> 1:46:23.880]  and our sardis would not get him so it appeared that i was a drug pilot that had run carl quintero
[1:46:23.880 --> 1:46:31.080]  out of the country and uh that's the way it come across the stuff about cia the information that
[1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:38.200]  that's what it kiki had run into and reported back to his superiors was not uh uh recorded in that
[1:46:38.200 --> 1:46:46.200]  interview that upset me immensely it put me in some pretty bad situation with uh people inside
[1:46:46.200 --> 1:46:52.440]  mexico because of the task force seven operations that have been going on since 209 through 213
[1:46:52.440 --> 1:47:02.360]  or the early part of this year and uh i reacted and uh so i started posting on facebook i had to
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:09.080]  um i posted some very sensitive documents to confirm what i was saying known as the berela
[1:47:09.080 --> 1:47:16.200]  file i called it the hextable relic and dope uh um i filled jordan they were already public on this
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:23.640]  my information does they'll tie it into those agents and uh that boy was covered some of it
[1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:28.440]  was covered uh in well you said in your facebook post that i saw that this this endangers your life
[1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:34.680]  well i mean uh i think two and two can be figured i'm sure they're not gonna be going down to
[1:47:34.680 --> 1:47:42.360]  mexico anytime soon uh two things here i worked three years with the patch force down there that
[1:47:42.360 --> 1:47:48.840]  was uh training out the marinos to go in and take out the zeta who by by the way has american arms
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:54.120]  and took the american arms with my mexico arsenal that had been shipped by the direct commercial
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:48:01.000]  sales to mexico this was a legal operation it's run by the state department the reason that tiki
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:07.160]  tamarina came into this picture was because i said that the ben gasey situation was the same
[1:48:07.160 --> 1:48:12.280]  no more sure so you were trying to go on about your past and then ben gasey and the info and they
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:16.840]  just spun it and turned it into some total distraction that wasn't even accurate i would
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:22.200]  what i was trying to do was use uh the tiki tamarina situation and the weapons smuggling to the
[1:48:22.200 --> 1:48:27.960]  southern front of the iran country the secret air base in alina costarica i was trying to use that
[1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:32.760]  as an example that the same situation you're trying to explain this is bigger than iran contra
[1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:37.080]  because now it's to al-qaeda type ribs and that's a great way but of course they taped it and then
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:42.600]  butchered it down and uh i knew exactly yeah whatever whatever they did and for whatever
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:49.480]  reasons number one uh i was told it was going to be aired on another program the bill i can't
[1:48:49.480 --> 1:48:55.960]  pronounce his last name uh my dentist is though or whatever and then found out it was going to be
[1:48:55.960 --> 1:49:02.760]  cut and put and put it over to the new megan uh uh kelly show i don't i don't miss the big people
[1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:08.040]  or any of them i don't pay any attention i i don't need people to tell me what i did i know what the
[1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:16.280]  hell i did uh you know so uh then it gets chopped up ladies on the floor uh i claim no that's what

[1:54:08.200 --> 1:54:11.160]  I don't know what just happened we had a bunch of obama supporters on the line
[1:54:11.720 --> 1:54:17.080]  listing on AM and FM stations in places like michigan and california on xM244 they all just
[1:54:17.080 --> 1:54:21.080]  hung out during that break I guess it was me to call them obamanoids I'm sorry
[1:54:22.920 --> 1:54:30.360]  smart guys how's that sound we had a lot of smart guys wise guys I hate to be mean it's just that
[1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:35.960]  look I was against bush and he was horrible obama is like five times worse I can't even believe it
[1:54:35.960 --> 1:54:40.440]  I mean just just butchering everything and I know it's because of the season we're in I know it's
[1:54:40.440 --> 1:54:44.200]  because the tyranny is getting worse if it was a republican they'd probably be just as bad
[1:54:44.200 --> 1:54:50.600]  bad but the democrats go well he's a democrat so I'm on the winning team as you're being raped
[1:54:51.160 --> 1:54:55.560]  as the big insurance companies laugh about all this you still think you're gonna get a free
[1:54:55.560 --> 1:54:59.400]  deal it's like you buy a lottery ticket it doesn't work so you buy another and buy another
[1:54:59.400 --> 1:55:03.400]  I predicted all this because I know the mentality that's why they thought they could get away with
[1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:09.800]  this toll free number four obama supporters for smart people to explain to me a dumb racist
[1:55:09.800 --> 1:55:21.000]  how I am racist 800 259 92 31 I mean Rachel Maddow said so profit in Arizona you're on the year go ahead
[1:55:24.760 --> 1:55:30.920]  enlighten me profit enlighten me a gracious one okay this is a series called battle bomber so
[1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:35.720]  just let me finish I totally disagree with your decision to push back the release date
[1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:41.320]  of the obama deception to until March and have a couple of suggestions number one the best way
[1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:47.720]  to end the obama deception to is with mugshots of all his puppet master controllers you should put
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:53.320]  a black and white photo of the global sponsors holding a little sign under their chin with their
[1:55:53.320 --> 1:55:57.880]  name and home addresses on it's funny you say this are you psychic or are you spying on us
[1:55:57.880 --> 1:56:01.960]  that's exactly what we're doing is that they've got to be brought to justice before they leave
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:07.160]  office or it'll set the precedent for total takeover that is actually that is actually
[1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:15.720]  pretty much how the film ends we were going to have a prison go ahead okay I really want
[1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:21.960]  their names and home addresses to be put on a little placard under their chin instead of you
[1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:27.960]  know so let me guess you lied you're not really an obama supporter well I I asked her if I could
[1:56:27.960 --> 1:56:34.120]  go slightly off top again a second hour so let me just finish please you put a booking number
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:41.400]  under their chin as if they're already in jail and I'm talking about the home addresses for
[1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:45.720]  David Rothschild David Rockefeller Warren Buffett Bill Gates Ted Turner George Soros
[1:56:46.440 --> 1:56:52.840]  Henry Kissinger Ziggy Brzezinski more he's strong people like that number two I also think he should
[1:56:52.840 --> 1:56:59.160]  put Obama's birth certificate in Obama deception to brother I got a job you're not an Obama supporter
[1:56:59.160 --> 1:57:03.560]  you're a smart guy though you are a real wise guy he actually guessed how we're looking at
[1:57:03.560 --> 1:57:08.600]  ending the film I can't put it out any earlier okay because I got to have time to produce the
[1:57:08.600 --> 1:57:13.640]  DVDs promoted everything and I'm still not done with it and I'm not gonna if I put it out now it's
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:20.200]  very powerful if I finish it in December have it mastered and manufactured and say late January
[1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:26.760]  pre-sales in February have it come out in March it'll sell less than if I release it in in December
[1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:32.600]  but I don't care about that I care about when I air it on Prison Planet dot TV and the DVDs go out
[1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:37.400]  people are gonna have watching parties with it and stuff and give it to Obama victims Obama slaves
[1:57:37.400 --> 1:57:46.440]  Obama zombies Obama sheep and then when it goes on YouTube because it'll go on YouTube you know a
[1:57:46.440 --> 1:57:50.600]  day after I put it on Prison Planet dot TV that's I mean I don't try to make money off it's not
[1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:55.240]  that it's bad to make money I make money selling other stuff that you need to put these weapons
[1:57:55.240 --> 1:58:00.760]  out and it is a weapon system and I want 20 million views on it on YouTube and other platforms in
[1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:07.080]  the first month so and believe me if I start putting their home addresses and things then it
[1:58:07.080 --> 1:58:14.120]  really pushes the I'm already asking for it okay believe me believe me I'm already asking for it
[1:58:14.120 --> 1:58:18.200]  want me to push any harder I mean I'm my problem is I can't control myself I probably will I mean

[2:01:34.440 --> 2:01:40.040]  been on hold for a while so i try to summarize everything i wanted to say real quick um uh
[2:01:40.040 --> 2:01:49.720]  number one uh u.s. taxpayers have financed the globe in a number two uh the u.s. corporations
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:56.360]  they're big global have no allegiance to their own country number three capitalism or socialism
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:02:02.360]  don't have to be an all or nothing thing and number four brock obama is my president he's
[2:02:02.360 --> 2:02:07.880]  president of the united states and i support the president well i hate to be mean to you sound
[2:02:07.880 --> 2:02:13.080]  like a really nice guy who's probably down and out and just is hoping for something let me try to
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:19.960]  just be clear here with you the multinationals that are raping this country wrote this and of
[2:02:19.960 --> 2:02:25.080]  course when it makes it you're gonna want more and then go for the next thing as they dangle the
[2:02:25.080 --> 2:02:29.960]  carrot and you follow it off the edge of the cliff i predicted exactly how all this would go
[2:02:29.960 --> 2:02:33.560]  because they've done it in countless countries they're following it you know be like i saw my
[2:02:33.560 --> 2:02:39.240]  wife making pancakes and i predicted the ingredients i didn't predict anything i know it's on the box
[2:02:39.240 --> 2:02:47.160]  of instant pancake mix shake and bake like ricky bobby says and this is shaking back here my friend
[2:02:47.160 --> 2:02:56.680]  this is this is this is a predetermined plan and they know your mentality and you say it's on an
[2:02:56.680 --> 2:03:04.200]  all or nothing thing they're not going to give you the free health care okay the the free health
[2:03:04.200 --> 2:03:09.320]  care was already there on medicare and medicaid this health care has gotten screwed up since
[2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:15.080]  government got involved in the last 50 years most places that have socials health care like england
[2:03:15.080 --> 2:03:20.600]  or hellholes a few places have it pretty good because in northern europe they will actually
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:26.920]  administer things properly and still it's like 75 taxes but you do have real free decent health care
[2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:31.000]  the problem is now they're phasing in eugenics and privatizing to do it we're going right to the
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:36.200]  privatization like england's now doing where it's double gang rape in fact this shouldn't be called
[2:03:36.200 --> 2:03:41.080]  obama care it should be called double gang rape care uh i mean affordable care act how about
[2:03:41.080 --> 2:03:47.640]  affordable rape act i mean this is a raping and i just i'm the poor obama supporters call in and go
[2:03:47.640 --> 2:03:53.080]  you know we finance the world we finance the bankers we bail out trillions can i have something
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:57.400]  and the thing is they're not going to give you anything because you don't have an army you don't
[2:03:57.400 --> 2:04:03.240]  have billions to lobby you don't run black ops squads i mean you just the bill of rights
[2:04:03.240 --> 2:04:09.080]  the constitution and due process and an active involved people was support supposed to support
[2:04:09.080 --> 2:04:13.960]  you and give you a free market so you had a chance in a market to get the health care you wanted the
[2:04:13.960 --> 2:04:18.600]  big insurance companies came in took it over gamed it cheated the whole system and now they've
[2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:23.160]  decided hey these people put up with anything let's double their premiums and take away their
[2:04:23.160 --> 2:04:30.280]  health care how's that sound you just touched it touched tip of the iceberg but obama's your
[2:04:30.280 --> 2:04:36.760]  president and i mean are you really an obama supporter i voted for him he's not going to be
[2:04:36.760 --> 2:04:41.800]  able to run again and i i'm worried about who's who's going to have a sick problem okay but you
[2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:46.040]  understand you've been conned i mean you understand obama does this on everything it hasn't been
[2:04:46.040 --> 2:04:50.840]  obama it's been a lot of people that have conned me not it's not so you forgive him we'll see that's
[2:04:50.840 --> 2:04:56.120]  why that's why he's a good president then the longest you feel good it's like the japanese

[2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:48.840]  we've got top survivalist guru james leslie rolls best-selling author joining us to give us an update
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:54.440]  his take on the ebt cards going down in the default and all the rest of it that he said years ago
[2:08:54.440 --> 2:08:58.280]  and then even months ago here on the show would be the build-up towards something big middle of next
[2:08:58.280 --> 2:09:05.000]  year is what he's predicting i want to go back to obama supporters here in just a moment a shooter
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:12.840]  jennings great patriot listener of the show bringing us into this hour i've got to basically
[2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:20.520]  break a few things down here folks listening to these obama supporters if you've just tuned in
[2:09:20.520 --> 2:09:25.960]  you missed them they really are desperate they're like obama's my president he cares about me it
[2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:32.840]  would have been bad with another president i know healthcare.gov doesn't work i know it's terrible
[2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:39.800]  this is meant to bring the system down so i'll finally get socialism and i'm explaining you don't
[2:09:39.800 --> 2:09:44.760]  have any lobbyists you don't even have any special interest for your socialism that's bad enough
[2:09:44.760 --> 2:09:53.080]  because it always gets taken over this has already been taken over and it will destroy this society
[2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:59.960]  and culture and they don't know what to say it's very very sad and these are real obama supporters
[2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:05.960]  that have been calling in we've got a few people being sarcastic but it's going exactly as i thought
[2:10:05.960 --> 2:10:09.240]  it would go because they've done this in country after country before us the globalists know what
[2:10:09.240 --> 2:10:17.240]  they're doing christian mash you're on the air go ahead um here's my take on this because i actually
[2:10:17.240 --> 2:10:22.760]  do support obama you know i'm not going to be sarcastic i'm not going to be a caller um the
[2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:30.520]  i'm sorry it's kind of sounds like an mpr voice but there are people around um i really want uh i
[2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:36.120]  didn't want romney to get in and i did want obama to get in mostly because people need to feel some
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:42.760]  pain before anything changes and i knew i could see obama i'm a big jerald solenti fan i i could see
[2:10:42.760 --> 2:10:48.440]  that obama was going to be destructive i could see that what he was going to do and i want him to do
[2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:54.360]  it because like jesse van turris says for example he wants to reinstate the draft because people aren't
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:11:01.320]  feeling any pain from the wars and can you uh at least agree with me that if you know yes yes i
[2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:06.280]  understand and even ron paul said this last friday we've tried to defeat obama care we've been moral
[2:11:06.280 --> 2:11:10.600]  their constituents are too dumb down and too confused and too desperate and too wanting and
[2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:15.240]  just too gullible they're just they're chumps i feel sorry for them actually it's very sad actually
[2:11:15.240 --> 2:11:18.680]  how conned they are and they just can't believe they've been conned so they'll go deeper
[2:11:18.680 --> 2:11:23.160]  into the con and the harder you try to pull out of the con the harder it ties down around
[2:11:23.160 --> 2:11:28.520]  your arm you never get out of it so go ahead and let them have it now the problem is they'll still
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:35.640]  blame it on people that that don't support it you cannot underestimate how desperate and wanting
[2:11:36.440 --> 2:11:44.120]  and quite frankly the pathetic the welfare class is i mean it's very very sad but i mean do you
[2:11:44.120 --> 2:11:50.440]  think anything would be bad enough uh i i'm not sure but i really i have one question that i've
[2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:55.720]  been dying to ask you actually is you're you're obviously a smart guy you're an informed guy you
[2:11:55.720 --> 2:12:02.120]  know what's going on and i i need to know how somebody like you could have i i believe you
[2:12:02.120 --> 2:12:06.840]  have three children how could you have children you know this is a this is a slave society you
[2:12:06.840 --> 2:12:12.360]  can see into the future the destruction of the economy how could you possibly justify having
[2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:17.560]  children putting them in front of that with the knowledge that you have well i think it's my duty
[2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:23.960]  in fact i appreciate your call i i want to have more children because we always go through adversity
[2:12:24.760 --> 2:12:27.960]  and a lot of times the best children are people that have gone through adversity
[2:12:28.760 --> 2:12:32.920]  and i'm not going to give up my life force just because the rest of society's falling down around
[2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:39.960]  me i want to build a core of people to rebuild the future and to capture the future and to go to space
[2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:48.040]  and so they may be destroyed but this you know this attitude of smart people informed people don't
[2:12:48.040 --> 2:12:52.200]  have kids because we're outnumbered by all the dumb down welfare people and everything else
[2:12:53.080 --> 2:12:58.600]  that's just giving that system the future that's giving up i haven't given up i'm telling people
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:03.000]  how negative stuff is and how bad it is so we can change course i'm not they're trying to demoralize
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:07.480]  people and i think a lot of people misgage what i'm saying when i talk about how evil the system is
[2:13:07.480 --> 2:13:13.080]  they say why are you trying to scare us and i'm not trying to scare anybody
[2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:18.840]  i'm trying to tell you it's already happening you should be scared to not take action
[2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:24.360]  look at this headline fox news u.s army defines christian ministers as domestic hate group
[2:13:26.280 --> 2:13:30.920]  i mean this is what the u.s army is now i basically might as well be captured by kim jong un
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:41.480]  this is the type of frustrating garbage we're dealing with here now i know we have uh joshua
[2:13:41.480 --> 2:13:44.440]  there we're going to go to mike in california says he's an obama supporter we're going to go
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:51.160]  to our guest we're getting on the skyline right now mike in california you claim to be an obama
[2:13:51.160 --> 2:13:56.520]  supporter i will know instantly if you sound desperate and beaten and crushed and are just hoping
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:14:02.440]  or if you're someone uh lying to get through on air to make fun of obama care or expose it might go
[2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:12.120]  ahead haha you're so funny mr jones you know i do support obama uh i am a socialist i'm a democrat
[2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:20.520]  i support obama care you are obviously a double agent i saw you on the uh pierce morgan interview
[2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:26.760]  and all the bathrooms are dirty and you're chomping around all crazy acting like a fool you
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:31.880]  brought a lie to spread it to yourself in your so-called movement so so so hold on a minute hold
[2:14:31.880 --> 2:14:38.120]  on a minute that is now seen by many sociologists and media watchers as one of the biggest things
[2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:45.000]  in tv in decades they admitted they had double uh the regular viewers that night and that uh the
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:49.160]  higher exec said don't have him on he crushed us too bad i actually talked to pierce i went
[2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:53.640]  confronted pierce morgan jumped out in houston they let me in the back door at a gun range
[2:14:53.640 --> 2:14:57.960]  he totally freaked out i talked to their head producer and they said no you did beat us and
[2:14:57.960 --> 2:15:02.920]  they're afraid to have you back on we we want to have you back on i shook people out of their coma
[2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:08.680]  just because you say i failed because i told him you want our guns to enslave us and if you try it
[2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:17.960]  again 1776 will commence they don't that's what made us win in 1775 1776 in 1836 i'm going to go

[2:16:59.640 --> 2:17:05.320]  a a hater of this broadcast all right listen i'm gonna let you go we got our guest on the line
[2:17:05.320 --> 2:17:13.080]  shifting gears now james wesley rolls uh has been one of the top survivalist experts out there
[2:17:13.080 --> 2:17:18.040]  survivalist blog.com he's the best-selling fiction and non-fiction writer survival blog.com
[2:17:18.040 --> 2:17:21.880]  he's whether it's till about 45 after and he's a very busy fellow we appreciate him coming on
[2:17:21.880 --> 2:17:27.000]  we're going to break here in a few minutes but i wanted you to come on sir because you a few years
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:31.560]  ago on the show and then a month ago on the show you said expect to see welfare problems expect to
[2:17:31.560 --> 2:17:39.000]  see the ebt's expect to see them move towards default middle of next year and i wanted you to
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:45.560]  talk now about what we saw with just a minor glitch the the the ebt folks in california said
[2:17:45.560 --> 2:17:51.720]  one more glitch we burn los angeles so they're conscious of their role as the brigades uh of
[2:17:51.720 --> 2:17:55.960]  the socialist takeover and and do you think this was a test to see what would happen suddenly the
[2:17:55.960 --> 2:18:00.600]  ebt's had unlimited money on them in some areas what do you what does james wesley rolls think is
[2:18:00.600 --> 2:18:06.520]  going on well alex i don't think it was necessarily a test it may have been a glitch just as they
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:14.840]  claimed but it certainly was illustrative of what we'll face in the event of a grid down
[2:18:15.640 --> 2:18:21.640]  collapse if the power grids go down the ebt system will go down simultaneously
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:28.760]  and that one factor just by itself not to mention all the other multitude of factors
[2:18:28.760 --> 2:18:36.920]  uh associated with the power grid failure but just the ebt system failure alone will be enough to
[2:18:36.920 --> 2:18:45.160]  spark major rioting at all the major cities in the united states undoubtedly and now we see massive
[2:18:45.160 --> 2:18:50.920]  armored vehicles brand new ones not just surplus by the scores to each major city as they openly
[2:18:50.920 --> 2:18:56.360]  trained to take on christians that's the fox news headline today this is really the coming out
[2:18:56.360 --> 2:19:01.640]  of their plan does that signify that they may be preparing to actually execute some type of purge
[2:19:01.640 --> 2:19:12.200]  or or what is it well the the military vehicle um release has been more to do with the peace
[2:19:12.200 --> 2:19:19.320]  dividend of the of the scale back of operations in iraq and afghanistan anything else they essentially
[2:19:19.320 --> 2:19:27.480]  over purchased uh and in typical government fashion they're releasing those for pennies on the dollar
[2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:32.920]  in effect these police departments are getting them basically just for the cost of transport
[2:19:33.640 --> 2:19:37.800]  in fact they can even go pick them up if they'd like rather than pay to have what was the book
[2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:41.320]  he wrote in the early 90s predicting the collapse and the globalist takeover and all that because
[2:19:41.320 --> 2:19:48.680]  in that you described all the armored vehicles that the police would be given well yeah it's the
[2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:56.040]  number of vehicles is is definitely increased uh it's all of course at taxpayers expense hold on

[2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:24.920]  free health care even as it fails and now you say well you don't worry it'll get fixed because
[2:24:24.920 --> 2:24:29.080]  obama loves you that's coming up but this is a short segment long segment coming up with
[2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:33.560]  james leslie rolls top survivalist expert geopolitically studying what's happening
[2:24:33.560 --> 2:24:36.920]  i know you've got points that you're gonna want to make because i want to ask you what's front
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:41.640]  and center on your radar and i want to get into preparedness and how important doing that is in
[2:24:41.640 --> 2:24:46.120]  this collective a system now more than ever that's the tool these tyrants have always used on people
[2:24:46.120 --> 2:24:51.000]  as the fact that they're not dependent on the system but james leslie rolls what do you make of
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:56.440]  the imf the communist chinese lecturing us saying the world market will plunge if we don't go deeper
[2:24:56.440 --> 2:25:02.280]  into debt if we don't support obama care we really are under globalism now where we're told every day
[2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:07.320]  that foreigners run our lives like we're a third world country under the imf and world bank and
[2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:11.720]  what do you make of all the debt limit talk and the government shutdown where do you see all this
[2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:16.680]  going what do you think's happening behind the scenes okay well alex just to back up a little
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:22.040]  bit we were talking about military vehicles going out to police department yes you got caught off
[2:25:22.040 --> 2:25:27.560]  i think the more important issue rather than try to look at it from a conspiratorial standpoint
[2:25:28.120 --> 2:25:38.520]  is if anything our government now recognizes the threat of ied's and for the last 10 years
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:46.760]  we've been having servicemen returning from iraq and afghanistan with a tremendous amount
[2:25:46.760 --> 2:25:55.480]  of knowledge of ied's and i'm sure those that knowledge scares the powers that be to death
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:26:00.440]  and i'm sure they would love to be all be running around in armored limousines and love to see all
[2:26:00.440 --> 2:26:06.120]  the police departments fully equipped with with mine protective vehicles because there may come
[2:26:06.120 --> 2:26:13.640]  a time when they need them uh there's now 10 years worth of returned servicemen now in the
[2:26:13.640 --> 2:26:20.120]  civilian world with that body of knowledge they spent 10 years detecting and disarming ied's
[2:26:20.120 --> 2:26:25.400]  they know them inside and out so i think that's the bigger issue oh oh i mean you're absolutely
[2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:30.600]  right in fact they said three years ago they said every department will the fbi told departments
[2:26:30.600 --> 2:26:37.080]  will face ied veterans are the number one threat they will bomb you in fact we can pull that report
[2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:41.400]  of i think that was associated press so that's what you're alluding to now they could also
[2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:45.640]  false flag it to start a civil war what are you knowing the globalist being an army intelligence
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:50.120]  being a guy people respect your smart guy what do you think what's the position they're in right now
[2:26:50.120 --> 2:26:54.360]  are things going well for them because i see folks waking up but they don't care they're just moving
[2:26:54.360 --> 2:26:58.520]  forward well i think i think the powers that be are kind of running scared at this point
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:05.080]  because uh they've created an economic monster that they may not be able to escape themselves
[2:27:05.080 --> 2:27:11.240]  they may be hoping to create a crisis but in in in fact they're going to create a crash
[2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:17.240]  and it's going to come back to bite them and there's going to be a tremendous groundswell
[2:27:17.240 --> 2:27:26.440]  of conservative patriotic feeling in american citizenry that's going to demand a return to
[2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:31.640]  small government and if anything comes out of the current debt crisis with the federal government
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:39.160]  it's going to be that uh all incumbent politicians are probably going to get turned out on their ear
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:49.640]  wow well i will say this the power structure looks completely scared right now and they
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:53.880]  should be scared because they've robbed everything blind and set up a fraudulent system that's so
[2:27:53.880 --> 2:27:58.200]  kleptocratic that there's no way to hold it up no matter how much they raise taxes what do you
[2:27:58.200 --> 2:28:02.760]  think the obama supporters are going to do when they don't get their free obama care now it actually
[2:28:02.760 --> 2:28:11.080]  wrecks what they had well we we could very well see uh more civil unrest i think there'll be a
[2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:20.120]  growing realization that we simply cannot afford obama care it is so huge and so all-encompassing
[2:28:20.120 --> 2:28:30.360]  and will affect so many segments of our economy that is absolutely unaffordable and as tax revenues
[2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:37.000]  continue to crumble and as interest rates go up that's the real killer uh our national debt will
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:46.440]  not be affordable especially with obama care there very well could be some some chaos that
[2:28:46.440 --> 2:28:51.560]  comes out of this sure but i mean they always plan to bring in this and wreck it fully and then
[2:28:51.560 --> 2:28:55.640]  further nationalize it but have the profits to select corporations but i mean what are they
[2:28:55.640 --> 2:28:59.720]  going to do now that they've been so good at their fraud that it's like overdone
[2:29:01.560 --> 2:29:07.000]  yeah at this point i think the people are realizing what obama care really means
[2:29:07.560 --> 2:29:12.760]  people were thinking there it was you know uh you know one of those money for nothing kind of
[2:29:12.760 --> 2:29:20.040]  things but in effect it's just a very heavy and regressive tax on the middle class and upper
[2:29:20.040 --> 2:29:26.840]  class in this country the middle class is going to get absolutely hammered by the obama care
[2:29:26.840 --> 2:29:34.440]  expenses and even the leftists who supported obama care when they see their their cost of
[2:29:34.440 --> 2:29:40.440]  insurance each year jumping to ten to fifteen thousand dollars a year uh even they will be
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:46.120]  dissuaded but then they'll just be listed as extremists so that makes it okay we'll be right back

[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:48.280]  calls or it's some breaking news all right you got caught off again by the break james uh looking
[2:33:48.280 --> 2:33:53.000]  at this i've been asking some of my questions i want to give you the floor here to talk about
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:57.160]  whatever you think is most important and get back into the ebt cards and where society is
[2:33:58.200 --> 2:34:04.520]  we have news clips where the folks in los angeles said if you ever have our ebt cards not work again
[2:34:04.520 --> 2:34:08.680]  again that's kind of like if you missed a payroll of your employees that will burn your office down
[2:34:08.680 --> 2:34:13.800]  or or if the check didn't get deposited right or if somebody didn't send me a bill or if i didn't
[2:34:13.800 --> 2:34:17.960]  pay somebody a few days later they called me up and said you didn't pay me for those products
[2:34:17.960 --> 2:34:22.040]  i'm going to burn your office down we have the video clips up on info wars dot com where folks
[2:34:22.040 --> 2:34:28.200]  are on the news saying we're going to go rodney king and burn down la if you're ever late again
[2:34:28.200 --> 2:34:34.760]  i mean we really are living a hostage to this now and uh you know michael more wants to make
[2:34:34.760 --> 2:34:39.240]  sure everybody has their guns taken so nobody can protect themselves uh but james leslie rolls
[2:34:39.240 --> 2:34:43.160]  i wanted to give you the floor to talk about whatever else you think is is uh most important
[2:34:43.160 --> 2:34:49.400]  here well i think the key issue is the whole concept of wealth redistribution and theft
[2:34:49.400 --> 2:34:59.480]  um every month our wallets are being emptied by under color of law for wealth transfer that's
[2:34:59.480 --> 2:35:07.400]  going to people who have no intention of finding work and the expectation that has developed
[2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:16.680]  amongst those people over decades even generations uh is that that that money was going to continue
[2:35:16.680 --> 2:35:27.880]  to come and the with that expectation uh or of entitlement uh there is a tremendous
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:37.240]  animus that's developed and basically biting the hand that's feeding and i think that we
[2:35:37.240 --> 2:35:46.280]  can only expect that to grow worse with time the animosity that exists is palpable and if you look
[2:35:46.280 --> 2:35:53.800]  at what happened on saturday evening in louisiana at those at those two walmart stores uh it was it
[2:35:53.800 --> 2:35:59.320]  went beyond just indifference it went it was absolutely spiteful uh when they when they
[2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:05.080]  announced over the loudspeaker that the ebt system had been restored and everyone who had been busy
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:09.800]  stealing food with the with the knowledge that they only had a couple of dollars on their ebt
[2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:14.840]  cards and they had hundreds of dollars worth of food in their shopping carts instead of putting
[2:36:14.840 --> 2:36:22.440]  that food back on the shelves like any rational and moral person would do they threw up their hands
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:29.480]  and walked away leaving thousands and thousands of dollars of perishable in some case frozen foods
[2:36:29.480 --> 2:36:37.560]  sitting in grocery cart carts it shows the the level of animus that exists and if and when we
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:47.640]  do see a long-term outage of ebt payments snap payments in a in a large number of cities we are
[2:36:47.640 --> 2:36:57.240]  going to see the the real uh rough underbelly we're going to see uh the uh the what what i like to
[2:36:57.240 --> 2:37:03.400]  refer to is this the smelly under layers of the onion being pulled pulled back we're going to see
[2:37:03.400 --> 2:37:12.360]  human nature at its very worst exposed and the socialists the controllers the globalists
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:18.520]  they're fully aware of this they've done this in country after country and they're now uh don't
[2:37:18.520 --> 2:37:22.600]  want anybody coming together they say the tea party's racist so that minorities won't go be part of
[2:37:22.600 --> 2:37:27.720]  the liberty movement even though minorities are uh it's a clear divide and conquer strategy but i
[2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:33.480]  don't see it working for them they're trying to sandwich old roman style control mechanisms over
[2:37:33.480 --> 2:37:40.760]  areas they controlled like the city of rome itself that was diverse with a high tech uh integration
[2:37:40.760 --> 2:37:47.720]  but instead even the elite themselves are cowardly and backstabbing and lazy and weasel like now
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:52.920]  compared to the technocrats of just 50 years ago and the technocrats say that themselves so what do
[2:37:52.920 --> 2:37:57.400]  you expect then to happen gut level because you you know usually don't make a lot of predictions
[2:37:57.400 --> 2:38:01.720]  but you said you were on a month or so ago you said you see the middle of next year is a really bad
[2:38:01.720 --> 2:38:06.280]  time i mean what do you expect societally not just short term but long term how will this all
[2:38:06.280 --> 2:38:12.680]  unravel what will happen if you've got 101 million people on food assistance who who think anybody
[2:38:12.680 --> 2:38:17.720]  with money needs to have you know be murdered well alex is it's definitely it's definitely
[2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:23.800]  difficult to time everything uh as i mentioned before it's all predicated upon interest rates
[2:38:23.800 --> 2:38:30.520]  at this point because once interest rates spike the game will be over the the national debt payments
[2:38:30.520 --> 2:38:39.480]  will be essentially unaffordable and then the foreign creditors are no longer going to trust
[2:38:39.480 --> 2:38:45.480]  american paper they're going to demand ridiculously high rates of return to keep rolling over their
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:54.360]  treasury paper and at that point the game will be over for a personal planning standpoint i think
[2:38:54.360 --> 2:38:59.400]  that your listeners need to recognize that that that it spike in interest rates is probably going
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:04.760]  to take place within the next year and they need to get their beans bullets and band-aid squared away
[2:39:06.920 --> 2:39:10.440]  i think that we're going to be going through some very traumatic times
[2:39:10.440 --> 2:39:16.440]  and people need to really be ready to hunker down they need to get to know their neighbors
[2:39:17.320 --> 2:39:23.080]  it's time to to team up with your neighbors to train up with your neighbors and to stock up with
[2:39:23.080 --> 2:39:28.840]  your neighbors because supplies are going to be very tight the purchasing dollar of the
[2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:34.200]  purchasing value of the u.s. dollar is going to absolutely plummet overnight we're going to see
[2:39:34.200 --> 2:39:41.960]  mass inflation and unless you have your money primarily in tangibles folks are going to see
[2:39:41.960 --> 2:39:52.040]  themselves wiped out overnight you know in my gut i've i've been prepared farms food you know
[2:39:52.040 --> 2:39:59.160]  basic training skin about run a trot line just growing up as a Texan and most americas the
[2:39:59.160 --> 2:40:03.880]  group in rural areas or at least a family that were from rural areas understand being self-sufficient
[2:40:03.880 --> 2:40:12.040]  is just second nature but i've i've always halfway been embarrassed having our main sponsors be
[2:40:12.040 --> 2:40:16.600]  survival stuff because even though i knew it was important people should do it i wasn't sure it
[2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:21.320]  would ever be needed by everybody certainly in certain circumstances people are always going to
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:26.680]  use something hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes problems but in the last few years i felt better
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:33.560]  and better about you know promoting stuff because it's just essential they want us dependent
[2:40:33.560 --> 2:40:38.920]  it's clear that we need to be independent but i've gone from thinking maybe 20 30 40 chance
[2:40:39.720 --> 2:40:45.960]  that i was going to need to use my food and medicine and things to now like 90 the only
[2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:50.600]  question is when will it all kick off when will it all fall through and and and all the different
[2:40:50.600 --> 2:41:00.200]  pentagon and british ministry of defense reports uh they're all concurring and basically you know
[2:41:00.200 --> 2:41:08.440]  quietly getting ready as well is there any way to stop collapse a and b what's the gammonet runs of
[2:41:08.440 --> 2:41:14.920]  the level of type collapse we can be under well um i think there's no way to really prevent a
[2:41:14.920 --> 2:41:22.200]  collapse completely they might be able to delay it for up to several more years one possibility
[2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:29.880]  that i've considered is that there could be a major crisis in europe that is going to virtually
[2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:38.840]  destroy the the purchasing power of the euro and the european credit system and if that were to happen
[2:41:38.840 --> 2:41:45.800]  before there was something comparable in the united states there could be a huge rush of funds from
[2:41:45.800 --> 2:41:56.840]  europe and uh from east of the caucuses into the united states so we could actually be the
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:42:03.560]  short-term beneficiaries of a of a crisis whether it's manufactured crisis or just an unavoidable
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:09.640]  crisis in europe for a couple of years and that could kind of prop things up for the american
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:17.640]  credit system temporarily only because we would be a relative safe haven that the us dollar is
[2:42:17.640 --> 2:42:23.560]  trashed just like the euro but if the perception is that the that the dollar is slightly safer than
[2:42:23.560 --> 2:42:28.280]  the euro then the money may come rushing to the united states if there is a crisis in europe
[2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:35.880]  so we may have a couple of years if that were to happen if everything if if interest rates spike
[2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:44.120]  and uh before a european crisis though i think we'll see the crisis in the in the united states
[2:42:44.120 --> 2:42:49.800]  first and things could very well fall apart within the next year if there's a credit crisis
[2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:56.040]  crisis that spawned in europe and it very well could come out of the the recent news from
[2:42:56.680 --> 2:43:02.440]  mrs legard that they're talking about a 10 levy of all bank accounts in europe
[2:43:04.600 --> 2:43:11.560]  you know that very well could spark a crisis in europe that could benefit the dollar in the short
[2:43:11.560 --> 2:43:18.760]  term and that has been kind of the anglo-americans establishments rule create crises other places
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:25.480]  to put off the implosion here while they prepare for the implosion and try to capitalize off of
[2:43:25.480 --> 2:43:31.400]  all the crises they've helped exacerbate or create and now they're telling us that our 17 trillion
[2:43:31.400 --> 2:43:36.120]  dollar debt's not the problem it's that we're not getting more debt quick enough to the bankers
[2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:42.120]  yeah they're they're frantically trying to reinflate a bubble right now uh they're trying to
[2:43:42.120 --> 2:43:46.520]  reinflate the the both the commercial and the residential real estate market
[2:43:46.520 --> 2:43:52.280]  debt bubble in the united states and all the mini bubbles that go along with those
[2:43:54.920 --> 2:44:02.120]  actually the deflationary forces are winning out in the short term and i think in what the
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:11.400]  the amazing thing will be watching the the rapid turnover from deflation to inflation practically
[2:44:11.400 --> 2:44:19.400]  overnight the american people are going to feel so whipsawed by that it's it's going to just absolutely
[2:44:19.400 --> 2:44:27.080]  blindside those people because they currently have the expectation of of low low inflation and in
[2:44:27.080 --> 2:44:34.600]  fact deflation on some things but practically overnight once interest rates start to spike
[2:44:34.600 --> 2:44:43.480]  as the as we have a repeat of the 2008 global credit crisis people are suddenly going to be
[2:44:43.480 --> 2:44:51.160]  faced with the situation of gasoline jumping from three dollars a gallon to 15 dollars a gallon
[2:44:51.160 --> 2:44:58.680]  and the same for milk 15 dollar a gallon milk i their kid that can't go on too long before there
[2:44:58.680 --> 2:45:07.480]  won't be absolute bloodness in the streets here in america today i took calls from obama supporters
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:11.720]  and most of them were serious they weren't sarcastic some were sarcastic callers and they
[2:45:11.720 --> 2:45:15.880]  would literally call in and go i'm poor i need something free and i would go you could have
[2:45:15.880 --> 2:45:20.760]  already gotten medicare medicare charity care this gets rid of that i've read the legislation it was
[2:45:20.760 --> 2:45:25.080]  written by the worst insurance companies to shut down their competition to lower the quality of care
[2:45:25.080 --> 2:45:30.280]  to make now it's 50 million people that don't have it get it it's a tax healthcare dot gov is it
[2:45:30.280 --> 2:45:35.800]  designed to work we broke that last week now it's confirmed this is a giant fraud you know obama
[2:45:35.800 --> 2:45:41.400]  signed into a a said he wouldn't obama said the nsa wasn't spying they were obama said he wasn't
[2:45:41.400 --> 2:45:49.160]  arming al qaeda he is he's there to con you do you understand this and they just go no he likes me
[2:45:49.160 --> 2:45:55.640]  i'm getting it it's free well okay he's smart this will wreck it and he'll bring in socialism i mean
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:46:00.920]  they really are useful idiots and i feel sorry for him i mean what will they do during another
[2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:05.160]  great depression for those that don't know they've hyped the bubble up so big folks there's no way
[2:46:05.160 --> 2:46:11.320]  to get out of this now it's kind of like drawing straws 10 different ways to be chopped up in pieces
[2:46:11.320 --> 2:46:16.520]  and then the government is saying anybody who's prepared and good and virtuous we're the enemy
[2:46:16.520 --> 2:46:21.080]  historically government will try to come dig us out of our holes and make us be their slaves
[2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:25.880]  is all they know how to do but they'll be so busy with their their own minions burning everything
[2:46:25.880 --> 2:46:30.600]  i mean this is really a hellish scenario now and what i'm saying is james is i've gone from
[2:46:30.600 --> 2:46:35.800]  knowing this was a possibility but thinking all know it won't happen to now realizing it's a
[2:46:35.800 --> 2:46:43.480]  probability and and and now becoming a certainty and it's just it's just really a horrible realization
[2:46:43.480 --> 2:46:48.440]  that you've been right and joel scalzen's been right and so many others have been
[2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:53.560]  and now i see like troops constantly on the streets of austin and checkpoints and stuff
[2:46:53.560 --> 2:46:59.400]  they're getting ready i mean i can't believe they really did this to us well yes you're right i'm not
[2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:07.880]  the only one saying this uh joel scalzen's one uh mark bobber is another uh peter schiff is another
[2:47:07.880 --> 2:47:13.880]  we've we've all been warning people that this was coming but the the realization is now that is
[2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:20.360]  coming a lot quicker than we than we than we thought and i think it's going to come unravel
[2:47:20.360 --> 2:47:26.600]  more quickly when it does than we thought partly because they've been re-inflating these credit
[2:47:26.600 --> 2:47:32.840]  bubbles artificially with the zero interest rate program for example that our zero interest rate
[2:47:32.840 --> 2:47:41.640]  policy zerk when we the inevitable crisis does happen it's going to be far far worse now than
[2:47:41.640 --> 2:47:49.160]  it would have been simply because they've they've created an artificial recovery we really have
[2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:58.920]  had no real recovery since 2008 what we've had is an artificial recovery and when things do fall apart
[2:47:58.920 --> 2:48:07.800]  they're going to fall apart so spectacularly that uh and so quickly that it's going to astound most
[2:48:07.800 --> 2:48:17.400]  people and even the powers that be that are trying to manipulate all this uh to to fulfill their own
[2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:27.320]  agenda i think are going to be taken by surprise by the severity of the unrest that takes place
[2:48:27.320 --> 2:48:33.640]  this is going to make occupy new york and occupy wall street look very small by comparison of course
[2:48:33.640 --> 2:48:39.400]  it'll be a thousand times bigger and real and of course rachel madow who we have the footage
[2:48:39.400 --> 2:48:44.600]  the police attacking the vets and the vets fight back she edited that off and said the vets attack
[2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:48.920]  them when all this goes down they're going to lie about everything folks have to know that
[2:48:48.920 --> 2:48:56.600]  you think we see weaponized media now it's about to get 10 times worse it very well could i think
[2:48:56.600 --> 2:49:05.720]  we could see a situation that could spiral completely out of control and as i mentioned
[2:49:05.720 --> 2:49:15.240]  in a previous interview with you the real lynch pin is the three western power grids and them staying
[2:49:15.240 --> 2:49:19.960]  up if they go down all bets are off is it a good idea that they're going to be testing and turning
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:26.520]  on and off the eastern power grid in a fema drill next next month yeah i've read about that i
[2:49:26.520 --> 2:49:33.960]  i think it's legitimate i don't think it's going to be used as cover for uh okay good a false flag
[2:49:33.960 --> 2:49:39.320]  attack although it could seem to be could be or i mean screwed up as the federal government is now
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:43.080]  they can turn it off and then turn back on uh your new books out it's already about seller x
