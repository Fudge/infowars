[00:00.000 --> 00:29.840]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling
[00:29.840 --> 00:38.840]  oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude. People can be made to enjoy
[00:38.840 --> 00:44.840]  a state of affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to enjoy.
[00:44.840 --> 01:04.840]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[01:04.840 --> 01:09.840]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools. They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[01:09.840 --> 01:17.840]  Booktory containing vacuums may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:17.840 --> 01:24.840]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:24.840 --> 01:29.840]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay but could it also cause cancer?
[01:29.840 --> 01:36.840]  Turns out the government had the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[01:36.840 --> 01:40.840]  They have to work the dark side or they'll spend time in the shadows.
[01:40.840 --> 01:48.840]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil. Well, join me. I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see.
[01:48.840 --> 02:04.840]  It's a need for a new world order. Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:04.840 --> 02:24.840]  The Doctor
[02:24.840 --> 02:48.720]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[02:48.720 --> 03:16.080]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[03:16.080 --> 03:19.920]  You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You taught me every television in London.
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.640]  Cruelty and indifference, intolerance and depression.
[03:23.640 --> 03:28.040]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now
[03:28.040 --> 03:32.160]  have sensors and systems of surveillance, perversing your conformity and sub-
[03:32.160 --> 03:33.160]  Cameras.
[03:33.160 --> 03:34.160]  In your submachine.
[03:34.160 --> 03:35.160]  Wait, cameras.
[03:35.160 --> 03:36.160]  How did this happen?
[03:36.160 --> 03:37.160]  Who's to blame?
[03:37.160 --> 03:40.160]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[03:40.160 --> 03:42.160]  They will be held accountable.
[03:42.160 --> 03:48.040]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a
[03:48.040 --> 03:49.040]  mirror.
[03:49.040 --> 03:50.040]  I know why you did it.
[03:50.040 --> 03:51.040]  I know you were afraid.
[03:51.040 --> 03:52.040]  Who would you be?
[03:52.040 --> 03:53.040]  War, terror and disease?
[03:53.040 --> 04:01.680]  There were a myriad of problems which inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your
[04:01.680 --> 04:02.680]  common sense.
[04:02.680 --> 04:08.040]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam
[04:08.040 --> 04:09.040]  Sutler.
[04:09.040 --> 04:14.360]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent
[04:14.360 --> 04:22.560]  obedient consent.
[04:22.560 --> 04:24.200]  There is a war.
[04:24.200 --> 04:26.000]  It's happening now.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.400]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[04:28.400 --> 04:31.000]  The time to choose sides has come.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.920]  We are the resistance.
[04:32.920 --> 04:41.520]  We are the Info War.
[04:41.520 --> 04:43.520]  This baby hits 88 miles per hour.
[04:43.520 --> 05:00.680]  You're going to see some serious shit.
[05:00.680 --> 05:07.320]  The farmer was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[05:07.320 --> 05:13.560]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[05:13.560 --> 05:18.720]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[05:18.720 --> 05:22.240]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[05:22.240 --> 05:24.400]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine.
[05:24.400 --> 05:27.600]  And the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[05:27.600 --> 05:31.400]  It's a death cult, and it's up to the individual to escape.
[05:31.400 --> 05:37.840]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[05:37.840 --> 05:41.320]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[05:41.320 --> 05:46.400]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to
[05:46.400 --> 05:50.720]  be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[05:50.720 --> 05:55.840]  Go to infowarstore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the mega
[05:55.840 --> 06:00.000]  immune support pack, now 40% off.
[06:00.000 --> 06:09.480]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[06:09.480 --> 06:15.400]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got
[06:15.400 --> 06:16.400]  one.
[06:16.400 --> 06:46.240]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:46.240 --> 07:13.560]  Thank you for joining us on this Sunday, June 13 broadcast.
[07:13.560 --> 07:18.440]  And the quickening is obviously always intensifying, so each new broadcast tends to be even more
[07:18.440 --> 07:22.560]  important than the last because we are living in such incredibly interesting and dangerous
[07:22.560 --> 07:26.280]  times.
[07:26.280 --> 07:31.080]  There are major power struggles taking place worldwide to decide who's going to dominate
[07:31.080 --> 07:35.840]  the world government, who's going to run it, and there are competing factions, and there
[07:35.840 --> 07:42.200]  are different world views in general within those factions, but the overarching spirit
[07:42.200 --> 07:46.880]  is one of anti-human death.
[07:46.880 --> 07:59.240]  It is a fight between good and evil, and the planet is being inexorably pulled into deeper
[07:59.240 --> 08:04.840]  and deeper levels of corruption and evil, and there's a lot of reasons for that, but
[08:04.840 --> 08:13.320]  as the world becomes more complex, corruption is able to hide in the cracks, but then there
[08:13.320 --> 08:17.440]  becomes a point where the corrupt own and control the media, and they control all the
[08:17.440 --> 08:21.200]  currency and all the money, and so they're able to dictate to the planet whatever they
[08:21.200 --> 08:23.600]  want, whenever they want.
[08:23.600 --> 08:28.960]  So there's the big 35,000 foot view and then the six inch view looking right down at it
[08:28.960 --> 08:42.720]  like ants under a microscope, but I don't want to be overly dramatic here, but when
[08:42.720 --> 08:51.480]  we get so close to a problem so long, we tend to become a little bit laissez-faire about
[08:51.480 --> 08:55.840]  it, even if you're fighting evil, fighting corruption, you're fighting, you're so close
[08:55.840 --> 09:03.640]  to it, you begin to know it and become comfortable with it, even if you intellectually and spiritually
[09:03.640 --> 09:10.560]  are rejecting it, your flesh, your flesh is your weak side, it becomes accustomed to
[09:10.560 --> 09:16.960]  that, and so there's a real danger for all of us to underestimate what the enemy's doing.
[09:16.960 --> 09:18.640]  So here's the best way for me to do this.
[09:18.640 --> 09:34.120]  If you tried to lay out what the British Empire model of the New World Order is up to, and
[09:34.120 --> 09:41.200]  it's the dominant group that set up the world system that does have competing factions,
[09:41.200 --> 09:48.360]  if you look at that system and what comes next in it, it's very, very clear.
[09:48.360 --> 09:59.040]  When the rhetoric is extremely clear, the preparatory rhetoric is as clear as driving
[09:59.040 --> 10:03.040]  down the highway and you see the golden arches, and you know that means there's a McDonald's
[10:03.040 --> 10:06.480]  there, or you're driving down the highway and you see a big church steeple, you know
[10:06.480 --> 10:09.960]  that's a church right there.
[10:09.960 --> 10:14.600]  And you know, it's gotten to a point of acclamation because they have to give us that point, denying
[10:14.600 --> 10:17.600]  they're doing it while they admit it, denying they're doing it while they're doing it,
[10:17.600 --> 10:22.040]  deny they're doing it, admit it, admit it, admit it, deny it, admit it, admit it, admit
[10:22.040 --> 10:28.200]  it, censor you if you say the UN's run by corrupt eugenicists that want World Government
[10:28.200 --> 10:31.360]  want to depopulate you, and here's where they say they want to get rid of the family and
[10:31.360 --> 10:37.040]  they hate all humans, and then they take you off Twitter and Facebook because you quote
[10:37.040 --> 10:43.240]  them and play a video clip of them saying, see they're only allowed to make the announcement
[10:43.240 --> 10:47.760]  in your face to tell you you're bad and children are bad and that humans are dirty and cover
[10:47.760 --> 10:53.520]  up your filthy face and they'd be better off, you know, getting rid of kids and all the
[10:53.520 --> 11:00.520]  bad things they're doing by design that are being scientifically deployed.
[11:00.520 --> 11:04.480]  And you think about Bill Gates saying he wants to depopulate the world and Klaus Schwab turns
[11:04.480 --> 11:09.720]  out Peter Dazek of course, we look more into him, it's in the news, you know the head chief
[11:09.720 --> 11:16.400]  scientist for Fauci that admitted gang of function and creating the five virus Chimera COVID-19,
[11:16.400 --> 11:20.120]  he admitted a year and a half ago before this even started, a little more than a year and
[11:20.120 --> 11:24.520]  a half ago, covering his ass by already having it out there quietly, oh I didn't do this
[11:24.520 --> 11:30.200]  on, we didn't do this evil, I mean we totally admit it, while they also deny it, he of
[11:30.200 --> 11:33.920]  course wants to depopulate and not let you have meat and make you live in a 200 square
[11:33.920 --> 11:41.280]  foot apartment, it's a cult, you don't get into it unless you're a eugenicist, death
[11:41.280 --> 11:47.840]  cult operator that wants to annihilate humanity because they have a psychotic propulsion system
[11:47.840 --> 11:48.840]  to do it.
[11:48.840 --> 11:53.840]  So just thinking about how the media is, oh we love the black people and we love these
[11:53.840 --> 11:58.880]  people and oh we love everyone and humanity is so good and we want a nanny state so all
[11:58.880 --> 12:04.160]  you were safe and we want you to have this shot because we care so much about you but
[12:04.160 --> 12:13.880]  the very people pushing all of this crap on us are openly telling us they want to get
[12:13.880 --> 12:23.840]  rid of us and it's just so incredibly naked how they operate, I mean I'm sure Gazzik
[12:23.840 --> 12:28.400]  in high school or in college was approached by the group just like anybody that's in the
[12:28.400 --> 12:42.800]  technical sciences area, especially biomechanical areas and they get approached, they're in
[12:42.800 --> 12:48.000]  the genetic engineering, all those areas and they get brought into the club and the entrance
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.600]  of the club is seeing everybody else as animals, well then you can play god and do whatever
[12:52.600 --> 12:56.720]  you want and that's who they are and then when we say hey we don't like what we're doing,
[12:56.720 --> 13:00.520]  we know what you're doing, they go you're too stupid, I am science, remember Fauci last
[13:00.520 --> 13:07.160]  week, when you criticize me you criticize science, well what an inversion of what I thought
[13:07.160 --> 13:12.160]  science was, science was questioning and testing hypotheses and looking at all the angles,
[13:12.160 --> 13:18.800]  oh no no no no, science is now the UN, world government, communist, Chinese, Fauci, writing
[13:18.800 --> 13:22.320]  papers admitting they created gain of function, moved it there when it was made illegal in
[13:22.320 --> 13:31.960]  the US, Obama did, gain of function, everything they've engaged in and then you go hey you
[13:31.960 --> 13:38.480]  admit you did all this, they go you're too stupid, I am science, but what he's saying
[13:38.480 --> 13:45.640]  is I exist, I control reality, remember what Carl Rove like ten years ago told a cocktail
[13:45.640 --> 13:54.560]  party of Washington Post, New York Times reporters in DC, he goes we are history's
[13:54.560 --> 14:00.880]  actors now meaning the Bush administration and we will tell you what reality is today
[14:00.880 --> 14:03.720]  and there will be one reality and then we'll tell you tomorrow a new reality and you will
[14:03.720 --> 14:09.720]  dutifully report that because we control reality now, we are history's actors and that's what
[14:09.720 --> 14:22.640]  this attitude is of maximum, complete, total, gaslighting
[14:22.640 --> 14:28.760]  and so let me tell you what's coming up today, we're going to hit it all when we come back,
[14:28.760 --> 14:34.640]  what is the next thing to come in a season like this, what is the next move always and
[14:34.640 --> 14:40.960]  the move they've been carrying out all over the world, well it's this right here, that's
[14:40.960 --> 14:56.400]  what it is, 45 year old Christopher Sein, the award winning, Emmy award winning, TV
[14:56.400 --> 15:01.480]  anchor man and reporter who just had his book published and is doing great and was super
[15:01.480 --> 15:09.640]  happy, well he got executed inside of his house yesterday and his body wasn't even cold,
[15:09.640 --> 15:14.600]  the blood wasn't even coagulated before they said it was a suicide, just like Breitbart,
[15:14.600 --> 15:19.400]  hell they'd say Kennedy was a suicide, do you know John F. Kennedy committed suicide,
[15:19.400 --> 15:20.400]  do you know that?
[15:20.400 --> 15:28.120]  I guess the one against the deep state kind of did, but he's dead now and he said I'll
[15:28.120 --> 15:31.520]  never commit suicide and he said I'm getting massive death threats to my family, my children
[15:31.520 --> 15:37.680]  is, from the Clintons because remember he exposed Loretta Lynch, the head of the Justice
[15:37.680 --> 15:41.680]  Department and the FBI, they had a corrupt meeting on the tarmac and lying about it on,
[15:41.680 --> 15:45.840]  that basically finally brought down the Clintons partially, well they've been waiting for a
[15:45.840 --> 15:50.600]  green light time to go offensive, I'm talking about Canaries and the coal mine, his execution
[15:50.600 --> 15:54.720]  is a message to everybody and I would expect to see a lot of these killings now, he was
[15:54.720 --> 15:59.080]  definitely murdered in my view, they'll tell you not to say that.
[15:59.080 --> 16:03.920]  In the last 16 months, InfoWars researchers have been hard at work developing the ultimate

[16:59.600 --> 17:04.880]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminated water, soil and subsurface material
[17:04.880 --> 17:09.320]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[17:09.320 --> 17:14.280]  and degrade targeted pollutants. For the first time, the bio-pros are bringing to the public
[17:14.280 --> 17:19.160]  market a suite of bio remediation products to the everyday consumer. Their first product
[17:19.160 --> 17:24.000]  they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish

[18:21.120 --> 18:27.880]  It is the western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[18:27.880 --> 18:32.120]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them. So because they can't defeat
[18:32.120 --> 18:39.040]  that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down and use the idea of
[18:39.040 --> 18:44.960]  equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies
[18:44.960 --> 18:51.640]  of control. That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating
[18:51.640 --> 18:56.400]  them. The only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[18:56.400 --> 19:01.960]  So redouble your efforts, we're all in this together.
[19:01.960 --> 19:08.080]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[19:08.080 --> 19:13.120]  the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And
[19:13.120 --> 19:18.120]  now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever to use every tool we've got.
[19:18.120 --> 19:22.600]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can

[20:00.040 --> 20:07.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:07.040 --> 20:12.040]  We came, we saw, he died.
[20:12.040 --> 20:27.040]  Do you have anything to do with your visit? No, I'm sure it did.
[20:27.040 --> 20:30.920]  Obama likes to talk about how good he is at killing people with drones. Hillary likes
[20:30.920 --> 20:36.160]  to brag about having her enemies killed, even though she couldn't walk on a flight of stairs
[20:36.160 --> 20:43.640]  by herself. It's constantly falling flat on her ugly, demonic face.
[20:43.640 --> 20:49.880]  But star reporter Emmy Award winner from Phoenix, he moved back to Alabama. We had a top local
[20:49.880 --> 20:56.320]  Fox show. He was anchoring there, had a best-selling book. Christopher Sein, who wrote the best-selling
[20:56.320 --> 21:00.760]  book about that tarmac meeting, that ended up basically bringing down the Clintons partially.
[21:00.760 --> 21:08.120]  Alabama TV anchor who broke Bill Clinton tarmac visit with Loretta Lynch was 45. Deadline.com
[21:08.120 --> 21:14.720]  gets it right. They say Christopher Sein dies. They didn't say commit suicide. But
[21:14.720 --> 21:23.960]  his body wasn't even cold yet yesterday when they started announcing that he committed
[21:23.960 --> 21:31.200]  suicide, kind of like Breitbart. They said, just died of a heart attack in the middle
[21:31.200 --> 21:36.640]  of the night. And by the time I woke up that morning, his body was not even cold. He died
[21:36.640 --> 21:42.240]  at like 2 a.m. out in California, 4 a.m. I guess in Texas. He wasn't even cold yet.
[21:42.240 --> 21:51.360]  They said he died of a heart attack. And then another coroner came in and said, no, he didn't
[21:51.360 --> 21:55.800]  die of a heart attack. Remember, they hadn't had a coroner's examination. They just said
[21:55.800 --> 22:02.600]  heart attack. And then another coroner came in and did the autopsy and found that he'd
[22:02.600 --> 22:10.280]  been not doing too well, probably foul play. And you know what happened to him? He ended
[22:10.280 --> 22:21.240]  up getting poisoned and dying. So I guess dead men tell no tales. But yes, the coroner
[22:21.240 --> 22:26.920]  got oversaw Breitbart and had some questions. He was never conclusive. But he didn't say
[22:26.920 --> 22:30.440]  he had some questions. Well, I guess nobody's there to find out what those questions are
[22:30.440 --> 22:36.040]  because he died of arsenic poisoning. And it's kind of like all the deaths of people
[22:36.040 --> 22:40.080]  from COVID inoculations. I mean, I know people that have lost family that died within two
[22:40.080 --> 22:46.240]  days to a week of it. I know two people close that had one family member die in two days.
[22:46.240 --> 22:53.440]  One died in a week. It was always the same strokes. And, you know, we know they tested
[22:53.440 --> 22:57.360]  it all overseas and we know it's causing massive strokes and heart attacks. And a bunch of
[22:57.360 --> 23:01.440]  the vaccines have been banned in more countries for causing strokes and all that. And they
[23:01.440 --> 23:05.880]  put up airline advisories now to don't fly for two weeks after you've had any of these
[23:05.880 --> 23:12.400]  COVID vaccines because you see Fauci running the NIH and basically the UN with Bill Gates
[23:12.400 --> 23:18.240]  told them what they wanted. We want a vaccine that attacks the surface of the virus, not
[23:18.240 --> 23:25.400]  what's in the virus. Well, the surface of the virus is a protein in your damn body.
[23:25.400 --> 23:34.680]  So they knew 101, that's like low level immunology that that would happen. And yeah, now mainline
[23:34.680 --> 23:40.680]  doctors from Italy to Mexico to the United States are confirming that people are seriously
[23:40.680 --> 23:44.600]  magnetic in some cases when they've had the shot. And then we find the literature that
[23:44.600 --> 23:52.480]  it's designed to grow magnetic prions in the body. So before we get to that, let me just
[23:52.480 --> 24:03.280]  back up here for a moment. Christopher Stein dies Alabama TV anchor who broke Bill Clinton
[24:03.280 --> 24:10.520]  Tarmac visit with Loretta Lynch was 45. Great family, great job, best selling book, totally
[24:10.520 --> 24:15.360]  happy. Other than he said, and we're gonna play a clip for you coming up here a moment,
[24:15.360 --> 24:24.280]  all the death threats he got and the threats on his family and how the community there
[24:24.280 --> 24:31.040]  in Alabama rallied around him. There's the threats got so bad he left his top anchor
[24:31.040 --> 24:40.640]  job as the main morning anchor in Phoenix on ABC top slot. He moved back to Alabama
[24:40.640 --> 24:46.440]  because of the threats. And just like Gary Webb, about a month before he got his head
[24:46.440 --> 24:50.000]  blown off, he got shot twice in the back of the side of the head. Looks like he fought
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.360]  back. Gary Webb said, I'm sending you all these documents and they were public documents
[24:56.360 --> 25:00.240]  and I want you to build me a website. And I'm going to come on your show and I'm going
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.960]  to break all these secret, you know, things that are starting to come out in my new book.
[25:04.960 --> 25:09.520]  And he said, but I got to move first. I caught two guys breaking in my house yesterday.
[25:09.520 --> 25:13.200]  He goes, they were special ops types. They were coming down on the second story, you
[25:13.200 --> 25:24.000]  know, sliding down the drain shaft down the, down the gutter pipe. And they killed him.
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.880]  They killed him. They blew his head off. Just like the DC Madame, who I interviewed a few
[25:29.880 --> 25:38.320]  months before she died. And she said, yeah, the threat to kill me, I'll never kill myself.
[25:38.320 --> 25:51.360]  And then she was found strangled in her mother's shed. And then I got her landlord on the show
[25:51.360 --> 25:55.160]  where it's not the landlord, the condo manager where she owned a condo. He'd been friends
[25:55.160 --> 26:03.240]  with her for 10 years. They were their Florida condo. And he, he said that she said men
[26:03.240 --> 26:06.640]  were after her and that she had to get to her mom's house, get her stuff and leave
[26:06.640 --> 26:13.200]  the country. And that she thought they were trying to kill her. And then we put out the
[26:13.200 --> 26:21.960]  suicide note that the news had gave him a copy of the suicide note. And the suicide note
[26:21.960 --> 26:28.960]  going from memory here. So I'm going back to it was not even anywhere near her handwriting.
[26:28.960 --> 26:37.000]  He sent us notes to him over the years, her lease agreement, totally different handwriting.
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  Looked like a, a dude did the suicide note about like I'd write, I have terrible penmanship.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.480]  She had beautiful penmanship. So here's one woman's beautiful handwriting. And then there's
[26:46.480 --> 26:53.040]  a guy's handwriting over here. They just killed her, hung her up in her mother's shed because
[26:53.040 --> 26:56.280]  they wait and watch till they can get you alone. And then boom, they grab you and kill
[26:56.280 --> 27:02.640]  you. So of course you may have just joined us. He's the guy now with his head blown off
[27:02.640 --> 27:10.760]  in Alabama who said they're trying to kill me and I had to come to Alabama to be protected.
[27:10.760 --> 27:16.800]  And then of course when the wife and kids aren't at home, they taser you, stands you
[27:16.800 --> 27:22.840]  up, shoots you in the head. And he's dead now. We'll play a clip. I'm talking about
[27:22.840 --> 27:28.640]  them death threatening him. Let me come back. So the Clintons I've noticed do this in waves
[27:28.640 --> 27:31.880]  with people that control the Clintons do. They'll kill a bunch of people, a couple hundred
[27:31.880 --> 27:36.800]  here, a couple hundred there and then they'll wait a while. But when they start killing,
[27:36.800 --> 27:42.280]  you'll see the type of group it is. People that know about Arkansas savings and loan.
[27:42.280 --> 27:47.400]  People that know about their corruption and, you know, Africa scams and deals. But this
[27:47.400 --> 27:53.520]  is, I believe the first salvo and I've been predicting this is coming against reporters.
[27:53.520 --> 28:05.640]  And I've gotten a lot of threats and I've also seen preparatory talk by deputy FBI directors
[28:05.640 --> 28:13.520]  and also leftist arms of the military about, I mean, they're on Twitter saying they want
[28:13.520 --> 28:20.160]  to kill me. And so they're externalizing their hatred. And of course, I'm not afraid of dying.
[28:20.160 --> 28:23.800]  I want to complete my mission and if God wants me to go tomorrow, that'll be the case. But
[28:23.800 --> 28:30.800]  I want to just get it out here for the thousandth time. I will never commit suicide. When I did
[28:30.800 --> 28:33.960]  the tongue-in-cheek thing about, oh, you need to go first, Bill Gates, you kill yourself
[28:33.960 --> 28:40.480]  and I will. That's obviously tongue-in-cheek. But I will never commit suicide. I love life.
[28:40.480 --> 28:46.000]  In fact, I intend to die fighting the enemy 110% and would never give them the pleasure
[28:46.000 --> 28:54.200]  of myself committing suicide, believe me. That's not it. I would never do that. No, no, no.
[28:54.200 --> 28:56.280]  We'll be right back.
[28:56.280 --> 29:02.960]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[29:02.960 --> 29:09.800]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs. Companies began
[29:09.800 --> 29:15.880]  synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs. The natural sources were then
[29:15.880 --> 29:21.680]  made illegal. Pharmaceuticals became medicine. And the sicker people got, the more their
[29:21.680 --> 29:27.400]  industry grew. It's a skeptical and it's up to the individual to escape. Good health
[29:27.400 --> 29:33.720]  begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive. Nutrients
[29:33.720 --> 29:39.400]  we cannot readily get from our food today. The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and
[29:39.400 --> 29:45.320]  vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune
[29:45.320 --> 29:51.440]  system. Go to infowarstore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the mega
[29:51.440 --> 29:59.040]  immune support pack. Now 40% off. I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April
[29:59.040 --> 30:03.440]  2021 and I just want to say something. I am so blessed and honored to work with this
[30:03.440 --> 30:07.760]  incredible crew that has come together over the years and has truly been answered a prayer
[30:07.760 --> 30:11.680]  and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show. I want you
[30:11.680 --> 30:16.440]  to know that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic,
[30:16.440 --> 30:20.320]  white, black, it doesn't matter you got red blood. And if you love freedom and justice
[30:20.320 --> 30:25.320]  and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together and it has
[30:25.320 --> 30:29.920]  just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years. And as crazy your
[30:29.920 --> 30:34.800]  things are, I want to keep working under the future. But again, that's really up to you
[30:34.800 --> 30:40.240]  and up to God. So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart
[30:40.240 --> 30:43.880]  to support us. But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want
[30:43.880 --> 30:48.080]  to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done and
[30:48.080 --> 30:52.720]  just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully
[30:52.720 --> 30:59.480]  God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for the worst. God bless.

[31:57.160 --> 32:02.760]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminated water, soil and subsurface material
[32:02.760 --> 32:07.200]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[32:07.200 --> 32:12.120]  and degrade targeted pollutants. For the first time, the bio-pros are bringing to the public

[32:53.000 --> 33:00.000]  it does is unparalleled. Thebiopros.com.
[33:23.000 --> 33:30.880]  This is a revolution of illegal gene therapy that caused massive illnesses and problems
[33:30.880 --> 33:35.640]  in human and animal trials previously when they tried in the last 20 years to develop
[33:35.640 --> 33:41.680]  mRNA vaccines. This time they're just testing to ignore the damage, cover it up in the media,
[33:41.680 --> 33:47.160]  have massive censorship and really carry out a depopulation operation in the process. I'm
[33:47.160 --> 33:52.240]  going to be getting to more of that next hour. Huge, very bad developments on that front.
[33:52.240 --> 34:01.000]  A federal judge has ruled that employers can order you to take a vaccine any experimental
[34:01.000 --> 34:07.040]  thing they want to have the job. Hell, I guess they can mandate you got to inject cyanide
[34:07.040 --> 34:10.720]  and by free will you could kill yourself. And that's really the point they're getting
[34:10.720 --> 34:17.720]  to. So federal judge, this business lawsuit filed by Houston Hospital employees who refused
[34:17.720 --> 34:28.720]  COVID-19 vaccine will be getting to that coming up next hour. But right now, we'll put on
[34:28.720 --> 34:33.040]  screen for TV viewers, radio listeners I suggest you go to infowars.com and see the forbidden
[34:33.040 --> 34:41.160]  verboten information. And that is the headline for today's show. Sunday emergency broadcast.
[34:41.160 --> 34:48.800]  I'd say we're in quite the emergency. Reporter who exposed Clinton control of FBI executed
[34:48.800 --> 34:55.360]  inside his home. Very, very professionally. Now, you'll notice if you go to the articles
[34:55.360 --> 35:02.640]  that came out when he first happened last night, they were saying, oh, it's suicide.
[35:02.640 --> 35:08.240]  They said Breitbart died of natural causes within two hours of him being in the hospital.
[35:08.240 --> 35:11.720]  That's not legal. That's not lawful. They said Hank Aaron had an autopsy. He did not
[35:11.720 --> 35:17.240]  COVID. There was no autopsy. They did the same thing with a lot of other folks that died.
[35:17.240 --> 35:23.360]  So mainstream media lies big time. You know that. And when the fixes in with the Clintons
[35:23.360 --> 35:30.160]  are the globals of the deep state, it is even more. So reporter who broke Clinton lynched
[35:30.160 --> 35:36.120]  tarmac story and received significant death threats found dead 45 year old award-winning
[35:36.120 --> 35:42.640]  anchor and investigative journals. Christopher signed dead. It was also a former successful
[35:42.640 --> 35:49.160]  Alabama football player and a stand up voice out type of guy. And he did what other people
[35:49.160 --> 35:54.040]  wouldn't do. Everybody warned him don't do this. But he broke that exclusively and that
[35:54.040 --> 35:58.240]  brought down the Clintons to a great extent. And they've been waiting and buying their
[35:58.240 --> 36:02.960]  time until they start doing assassinations. And I've been predicting this because if
[36:02.960 --> 36:07.240]  you see everything else that's going on, what's unfolding, the fact that their stuff,
[36:07.240 --> 36:12.640]  the election isn't being sold. The fact that the majority of Americans don't buy into it.
[36:12.640 --> 36:16.800]  The fact that they said they want to turn the Pentagon loose on American gun owners.
[36:16.800 --> 36:21.640]  You've got former FBI deputy directors on MSNBC. I played this earlier this week saying
[36:21.640 --> 36:26.280]  we need to take out members of Congress like their terrorists. We need to remove the Trump
[36:26.280 --> 36:31.520]  network like their terrorists. We need to use green berets on them. They're saying all
[36:31.520 --> 36:36.400]  that to externalize the methods so the people they're trying to organize to actually do that
[36:36.400 --> 36:42.360]  and have a physical coup against the American resistance. They need to make people think
[36:42.360 --> 36:49.680]  that they're confident and they're winning. So this is all done on purpose. And so if
[36:49.680 --> 36:55.840]  you ever hear Alex Jones killed himself or their favorite thing. Oh, the father killed
[36:55.840 --> 37:01.600]  his wife and children before turning the gun on himself. One zillion percent false, impossible
[37:01.600 --> 37:06.720]  to infinity, not true. There's a lot of them that get sloppy. They just go in and kill
[37:06.720 --> 37:10.520]  the whole family because it's hard to get the person separate from the rest of the family.
[37:10.520 --> 37:15.000]  The real professionals know how to do it. Like, oh, DC madam's going to visit her mom
[37:15.000 --> 37:22.360]  at her trailer. Just grab her, stun her, put her in the little shed and hang her and put
[37:22.360 --> 37:27.600]  a fake suicide note up, which they confirmed basically happened. I talked with four detectives
[37:27.600 --> 37:33.440]  all of it and got a copy of the letter and again got documents from her, a business associates
[37:33.440 --> 37:37.760]  to show it was not her handwriting. And that's just how this goes. It's how it operates.
[37:37.760 --> 37:47.840]  But to go to that escalation, to start really killing people, passes a whole other Rubicon.
[37:47.840 --> 37:51.880]  And it's because the globalists are so incredibly desperate. But if you look at their entire
[37:51.880 --> 37:58.960]  posture and everything they're doing and everything they've been carrying out, I mean, they're
[37:58.960 --> 38:04.680]  willing to kill hundreds of millions of people with tainted vaccines, scar billions. They're
[38:04.680 --> 38:08.480]  willing to do anything. They're willing to smuggle kidnapped children over the Texas
[38:08.480 --> 38:14.440]  border and illegally load them on private aircraft and buses and have them shipped to known criminals
[38:14.440 --> 38:20.960]  and child molesters on record. These are totally evil people committed to the destruction of
[38:20.960 --> 38:25.240]  this country because they enjoy it and they like it. They were trained to hate the country
[38:25.240 --> 38:31.080]  as globalist operatives. So they were chosen because they hate this Republic, because they
[38:31.080 --> 38:35.520]  hate God, because they hate children, because they have bad will towards everyone. And those
[38:35.520 --> 38:39.640]  of you that aren't like that need to get your heads straight. Understand, just because you
[38:39.640 --> 38:46.280]  aren't a psychotic demonic control freak doesn't mean they don't exist. So here he is from
[38:46.280 --> 38:51.960]  the grave talking about all the death threats and everybody said, boy, this guy's got courage
[38:51.960 --> 38:56.080]  because the Clintons really come after you. Yeah, believe me. The Clintons had all these
[38:56.080 --> 39:05.480]  big lawsuits filed against us by DNC party groups and a lot of stuff that I agreed to
[39:05.480 --> 39:11.360]  be off record. So I'm not going to say anymore, but just believe me. I know some other big
[39:11.360 --> 39:17.920]  national talk show host that did take the threats and basically stopped. And I know
[39:17.920 --> 39:22.240]  some big networks did the same thing. And I understand when somebody starts threatening
[39:22.240 --> 39:26.640]  to kill you and as you follow it around, most folks are back off from that. For me, it's
[39:26.640 --> 39:32.400]  not about being macho or a pissing contest. For me, it's just about I got to do it. God
[39:32.400 --> 39:38.400]  says and I feel good when I'm fighting evil and I feel close to God and I feel strong
[39:38.400 --> 39:44.040]  and just even entertain selling out makes me feel alone and weak and pathetic. So I'm
[39:44.040 --> 39:49.320]  just addicted to fight these people and fighting evil. So if they kill me, it's a great honor
[39:49.320 --> 39:54.040]  to die in the service of humanity. And I'm just a very blessed person. It's not going
[39:54.040 --> 39:58.480]  to be a failure, folks. You'd realize that's going to be a real success if they're reckless
[39:58.480 --> 40:02.520]  enough to kill me. Instead of trying to put me in prison, I got the FBI with a bunch of
[40:02.520 --> 40:07.360]  fake cases, they're cooking up. And that's fine. I understand they sold out to evil.
[40:07.360 --> 40:12.760]  They've lost their soul. Sorry. That's not me, bro. So any of the options, you know,
[40:12.760 --> 40:16.360]  bankrupt me with fake lawsuits, fine, whatever, I don't care. I'm gonna keep getting the word
[40:16.360 --> 40:22.760]  out one way or another. Put me in prison. Well, that sucks, but whatever. Or kill me.
[40:22.760 --> 40:28.320]  That's almost the easier route right there. But here's how it works. I'm not backing down,
[40:28.320 --> 40:38.880]  but I will not have them kill me. And then say that I killed myself. So I was thinking
[40:38.880 --> 40:42.680]  how they operate and what they've done to really good men to demonize them. And you
[40:42.680 --> 40:46.160]  know what it is, they come when you're there with your wife and kids. So I'm just going
[40:46.160 --> 40:51.000]  to be completely honest about this. I'm a tough guy at certain levels. But I have to
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.360]  really think about everything operates and the way things really are. And so I'm gonna
[40:55.360 --> 41:01.800]  stay in this fight. But I do need 24 hour day security for my children and my family.
[41:01.800 --> 41:05.240]  I've really got it most of the time, but I need to have real security. I mean, guys
[41:05.240 --> 41:10.200]  on the roof all the time. And we need to start creating, you know, profile stuff on the enemy
[41:10.200 --> 41:15.320]  and doing public reports on that as well. Because you know, here's the deal. I'm a canary
[41:15.320 --> 41:18.720]  in the coal mine. This guy was a big one. So if we start seeing more deaths the next
[41:18.720 --> 41:24.040]  few days, the next few weeks, it's a message to threaten everybody to shut up. Or there
[41:24.040 --> 41:27.920]  might be 20 deaths by tomorrow. Ron Paul is dead. Alex Jones is dead. Tucker Carlson,
[41:27.920 --> 41:32.640]  the car bomb goes off. I mean, it's a very good chance they're going to turn their little
[41:32.640 --> 41:37.960]  armies loose on us. And then to demonize good men, they'll kill Tucker Carlson, his wife,
[41:37.960 --> 41:40.960]  probably wait till his kids are in college or over visiting or something. And that's
[41:40.960 --> 41:44.760]  how they do it. So I'm calling Tucker to have the show. I'm going to tell him Tucker, you
[41:44.760 --> 41:48.360]  need to get extra security. I'm going to leave it at that. And I'm going to call everybody
[41:48.360 --> 41:52.280]  I know. And I'm calling this out on air right now. We have to go into war mode now, ladies
[41:52.280 --> 41:56.400]  and gentlemen, as these are criminal terrorists that carried out Oklahoma City. They burned
[41:56.400 --> 42:00.360]  down Waco with all those tanks and killed those little kids. They like killing people.
[42:00.360 --> 42:03.840]  They're child molesters. Hillary's a child molester. Bill Clinton's a child molester.
[42:03.840 --> 42:07.960]  Well, guess what? I'm not going to be a soft target for these people. And I'm not going
[42:07.960 --> 42:13.640]  to let them tie me up while they blow my wife and children's heads off in front of me. So
[42:13.640 --> 42:15.880]  I'm going to tell the listeners right now, and I know you're going to come through on
[42:15.880 --> 42:20.440]  this. I don't have the budget for the real security I need. I'm going to leave it at
[42:20.440 --> 42:25.120]  that. I've got guns. We've got people around a lot of the time, but I need I need a serious
[42:25.120 --> 42:30.480]  security detail all the time for my family. Because again, they won't target them. If
[42:30.480 --> 42:34.920]  they, you know, they'll want to grease them to blame it on me. I know how they operate.
[42:34.920 --> 42:39.440]  So I can let them do that. And then of course, if they do start doing that, if they kill
[42:39.440 --> 42:42.720]  me, ladies and gentlemen, you know what to do. You know who did it.
[42:42.720 --> 42:51.160]  It's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S.
[42:51.160 --> 42:55.240]  They encourage people to live in tents, cities as homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and
[42:55.240 --> 43:00.880]  engage in petty crime. It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course
[43:00.880 --> 43:06.280]  the gray reset, they want to lower expectations. They don't want you to think of having sanitary
[43:06.280 --> 43:09.440]  systems everywhere. They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better.
[43:09.440 --> 43:14.040]  They want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse. The globalists fly
[43:14.040 --> 43:18.800]  around in private jets. They have huge private mistakes. They are separate from us. Their
[43:18.800 --> 43:24.480]  children go to private tutors. They admit this. Now they want us locked down, telecommunicating
[43:24.480 --> 43:29.800]  with each other so that we are not actually out physically building a pro human infrastructure.
[43:29.800 --> 43:35.120]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G has been to control robot autonomous cars and
[43:35.120 --> 43:39.760]  trucks. This is all their admitted plan. The public is finally listening because the plan
[43:39.760 --> 43:43.960]  is no longer in beta. It's gone operational. It's a post human future. You better find
[43:43.960 --> 43:48.200]  out about it right now. In the last 16 months, Info Wars researchers

[44:46.680 --> 44:52.880]  My enemies are your enemies. They're the globalist, third extremist. They are a consortium of
[44:52.880 --> 44:58.200]  bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers, vampires, wherever you want
[44:58.200 --> 45:05.080]  to call them, that are highly predatory and are setting up a false famously land system
[45:05.080 --> 45:12.080]  of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs and electromagnetic radiation to change the
[45:12.080 --> 45:18.800]  very DNA of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn
[45:18.800 --> 45:25.040]  on a chessboard. The bottom line is they want to play God. They are playing God and the
[45:25.040 --> 45:29.080]  news is only going to tie it around our necks from here on out. So many other people want
[45:29.080 --> 45:33.400]  to be positive. They want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts
[45:33.400 --> 45:36.600]  of what's happening with New World Order. But at the end of the day, it's all about
[45:36.600 --> 45:41.000]  the population. It's all about world government. It's all about the end of the human system
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.960]  as we know it. And on its ashes, a nightmare being built, only admitting it can turn around
[45:44.960 --> 45:45.960]  and stop it.
[45:45.960 --> 45:50.680]  I'm not going to say this five times in a row to the obnoxious. I'm saying it because
[45:50.680 --> 45:57.320]  it's the key to victory over these criminals. Last week, the arch globalist Fauci admitted
[45:57.320 --> 46:03.920]  that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses,
[46:03.920 --> 46:08.480]  you name it, have taken the so-called COVID-19 franken shot. I'm going to say it the second
[46:08.480 --> 46:17.480]  time. Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refuse to take the franken shots.
[46:17.480 --> 46:22.000]  They don't trust it. You shouldn't trust it. The vaccines have been banned in most countries
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.320]  around the world. This is an attack on the American people, the people of the world.
[46:26.320 --> 46:32.600]  This is an absolute red flag smoking gun. Again, let me say it two more times. Around
[46:32.600 --> 46:37.240]  half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff refuse to take
[46:37.240 --> 46:42.480]  the vaccines. That's right. The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine
[46:42.480 --> 46:50.080]  and you shouldn't either. You should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[46:50.080 --> 47:09.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:09.080 --> 47:17.000]  Frank Belusi, former deputy director over at the FBI, went on television last week. Former
[47:17.000 --> 47:26.760]  assistant FBI director said arresting GOP Congress members may be needed to really tackle terrorism.
[47:26.760 --> 47:32.040]  That's a real headline. And he said use the CIA and counterterrorism. Don't give members
[47:32.040 --> 47:40.440]  of Congress due process, take them to Gitmo. Now, again, on a scale of 1 to 10, that's
[47:40.440 --> 47:45.520]  a 10. That's Kim Jong-un stuff. Now, he's externalizing the method. And I'm going to
[47:45.520 --> 47:48.960]  explain next hour why this is happening and why inflation is going to get so bad and why
[47:48.960 --> 47:54.480]  things are going to be so hellish and why they're putting this true tyranny in place.
[47:54.480 --> 48:01.440]  But censorship isn't shutting down the truth about who launched COVID-19. The Chai comms
[48:01.440 --> 48:08.280]  with the deep state globalist. And even though the Justice Department will never indict any
[48:08.280 --> 48:11.800]  of the people that did this, the public's indicted them and they're all in deep trouble
[48:11.800 --> 48:15.440]  and their companies are all in deep trouble and their wives are leaving them and everyone
[48:15.440 --> 48:21.400]  hates them. And so you've got all these little so-called tough guy lawyers playing tough
[48:21.400 --> 48:30.440]  guy, playing gangster now, pushing and messing with really hardworking serious Americans.
[48:30.440 --> 48:38.080]  And you've got what's coming next. You know, I would never say if I got killed, start a
[48:38.080 --> 48:43.040]  civil war. So it's not a civil war. It's a foreign outside group. But I was thinking
[48:43.040 --> 48:46.840]  about it driving into the office today. If they start killing a bunch of journalists
[48:46.840 --> 48:50.720]  and we've tried to fix this peacefully and we put up with all their attacks and the things
[48:50.720 --> 48:57.480]  they've done, that's so offensive that at a certain point it's going to start a war.
[48:57.480 --> 49:01.520]  And then they're going to trigger the race riots as a distraction so that we think running
[49:01.520 --> 49:07.240]  around killing each other because of what color we are is the answer when the enemies
[49:07.240 --> 49:11.400]  are the globalists. They're the New World Order people. We know their names. We know
[49:11.400 --> 49:16.600]  who they are. And they're the ones attacking us with economic shutdowns and mass suicide
[49:16.600 --> 49:23.760]  and depression and poisoned gene therapy inoculations and they tell us they want to depopulate. So
[49:23.760 --> 49:27.800]  very powerful, crazy people want total control in depopulation and they're committed to it
[49:27.800 --> 49:33.000]  like a gun's in their head. Then the old Satan, whatever you want to call it, that's
[49:33.000 --> 49:43.200]  what's happening. And now they're getting everything lined up for the financial collapse
[49:43.200 --> 49:47.560]  and their only move left is they think, well, let's just kill a bunch of journalists. Let's
[49:47.560 --> 49:52.600]  just threaten a bunch of people and that will get them to shut up just like they do in Mexico
[49:52.600 --> 49:58.000]  or something they do in Guatemala. You hear like hundreds of people running for Congress
[49:58.000 --> 50:03.040]  killed in Mexico. Hundreds of journalists killed every year in Mexico. That's the natural
[50:03.040 --> 50:10.600]  progression of us becoming a third world country run by the IMF and World Bank is this. And
[50:10.600 --> 50:14.960]  so our streets resemble something worse than Mexico, the homeless, the disease, the fentanyl.
[50:14.960 --> 50:19.640]  So this is just like another chapter. Like you pull up at your house and you see smoke
[50:19.640 --> 50:24.160]  shooting out of the windows, you go and there's a fire in there where there's smoke, there's
[50:24.160 --> 50:31.120]  fire. And so I have no desire to go to war with people like Figgly Uzi who's like dog
[50:31.120 --> 50:36.640]  manure wouldn't step on it to rub it off my shoe. Just a weird, puffy, little fake tough
[50:36.640 --> 50:44.000]  guy, lawyer jerk who wants to arrest Congress. I mean, and then they call a bunch of poor
[50:44.000 --> 50:49.320]  folks that lost their jobs for six, eight months mad, breaking into the Capitol and
[50:49.320 --> 50:53.560]  breaking some stuff and beating people up, which was wrong. They call that Pearl Harbor
[50:53.560 --> 50:57.720]  and the end of the world. And now everybody's got to be arrested. And it trend trended number
[50:57.720 --> 51:07.480]  one on Twitter yesterday in politics, arrest Alex Jones and just edited takes going, look,
[51:07.480 --> 51:13.160]  he's admitting Trump ordered the attack on the Capitol. And then it's me going, yeah,
[51:13.160 --> 51:19.960]  Trump said we were going to march to the Capitol. He said it on TV, dummy. And they know their
[51:19.960 --> 51:29.880]  listeners and viewers are so dumb. They know that they are so absolutely out of their minds
[51:29.880 --> 51:34.160]  that they know because this is some of these people are so-called journalists that are
[51:34.160 --> 51:38.640]  saying this that are connected to Figgly Uzi and the rest of them. They're going, look,
[51:38.640 --> 51:43.560]  he says he funded this and then they cut to out of a million people, maybe 500 or whatever
[51:43.560 --> 51:49.440]  that broke into the Capitol. And look, we have this footage that leaked of him and secretly
[51:49.440 --> 51:55.200]  admitting it recently resurfaced and Jones is insane. Why do you discriminate himself?
[51:55.200 --> 52:02.120]  There was a huge event at the ellipse at the Washington Monument and they know that. It's
[52:02.120 --> 52:06.520]  like if you put on a football game and then there's a riot after the football game down
[52:06.520 --> 52:12.400]  the street and they try to blame the NFL for it. We're up there. People are in their long,
[52:12.400 --> 52:17.280]  fancy cashmere coats. There's Port-a-Potty Secret Service, Jumbo Tron, the president speaking.
[52:17.280 --> 52:26.720]  And then they turn that into Trump and I wanted that horrible hijacking of our event because
[52:26.720 --> 52:33.720]  the Secret Service and the Capitol Police leadership stood down. So this is the wheelhouse
[52:33.720 --> 52:44.320]  we're in. And you've got people like Mudd of the CIA and you've got people like Frank
[52:44.320 --> 52:49.600]  Figgly Uzi or however the hell you say his name, literally up there on TV saying, we're
[52:49.600 --> 52:55.040]  going to kill Trump. I mean, this is crazy talk. We're somebody's going to kill that
[52:55.040 --> 52:59.680]  guy from the CIA. We're going to kill him. He deserves a die. Well, we just need to arrest
[52:59.680 --> 53:04.880]  the Congress people and that'll take care of everything because they know the election
[53:04.880 --> 53:08.760]  frauds coming out. They know the other states are looking. They know they know that they're
[53:08.760 --> 53:12.800]  Chinese agents. They know they're signed on to Bill Gates and all this and the whole thing's
[53:12.800 --> 53:17.840]  going down. The whole thing's collapsing. And so they just think if they can make us
[53:17.840 --> 53:23.800]  shut up and go away, they're going to win when they're a bunch of lawyers that never
[53:23.800 --> 53:35.760]  even got their hands dirty. But they have people that did and they've got contract killers
[53:35.760 --> 53:45.840]  working for them and they're out there killing people. And so if they, I mean, obviously
[53:45.840 --> 53:49.840]  they killed this guy. I mean, we know that they're going, oh, no, no, no, and Breitbart
[53:49.840 --> 53:53.880]  neither and everything. The telltale sign is before their bodies even call. They tell
[53:53.880 --> 53:57.680]  you, oh, natural causes are suicide. Remember Arkansas, people would have their arms and
[53:57.680 --> 54:02.920]  legs cut off and would be shot like 20 times. And the Arkansas medical examiner, Fami Malik,
[54:02.920 --> 54:07.360]  would say that they died of natural causes. They find a guy with his arms, legs and head
[54:07.360 --> 54:14.240]  cut off with bullet wounds all over him in a burned trash bag in a trash dump that someone
[54:14.240 --> 54:22.800]  had poured gasoline on. And he said natural causes. And I'm not joking when I say that.
[54:22.800 --> 54:25.640]  That's in the Clinton Chronicles. That's in the films that came out. And by the way,
[54:25.640 --> 54:31.000]  people in the Clinton Chronicles, if you just saw Bill Clinton with a girlfriend, the state
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.800]  police would come to your house and break your neck and break your arms and legs. The
[54:34.800 --> 54:38.000]  interview got a wheelchair with his broken, you know, still can't walk because they came
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.240]  in and the state police broke his arms and legs and broke his neck. Compound fractures
[54:42.240 --> 54:49.360]  out of his legs because they were on the state. And when you get away with stuff that long
[54:49.360 --> 54:55.760]  and are allowed to do that, you start thinking you're God and you go in and you blow up Libya
[54:55.760 --> 55:01.040]  and you come and brag about how I had him killed. I'm tough and Hillary can barely get
[55:01.040 --> 55:08.120]  out of her chair. But that's the type of garbage that is still in control of this country to
[55:08.120 --> 55:15.520]  a great extent because they ran giant child molestation rings. That was Hillary's first
[55:15.520 --> 55:21.480]  job as a lawyer was handling cases of rich men that raped and tortured little kids. Look
[55:21.480 --> 55:26.600]  it up. That's who they are. You're like, God, why are they so evil? Because they are the
[55:26.600 --> 55:32.720]  service creatures of the group above them. They are the Renfields. And where there is
[55:32.720 --> 55:40.920]  Renfield, there is Dracula. So that's who these people are. And that's who they'll always
[55:40.920 --> 55:47.800]  be. But here's this hero 45 year old Christopher sign who lives on and we should start an organization
[55:47.800 --> 55:53.640]  in his name for free speech and defense of the press and real perseverance dead, dead
[55:53.640 --> 55:59.880]  five years after he helped sink the Clintons presidential aspirations. And so we salute
[55:59.880 --> 56:05.760]  him. The price for this career wise, what kind of you know, what kind of threats or
[56:05.760 --> 56:10.360]  what have you received? Well, my family received significant death threats. Shortly after breaking
[56:10.360 --> 56:16.480]  this story, credit cards hacked, you know, my children, we have code words, we have secret
[56:16.480 --> 56:22.000]  code words that they know what to do. And that's why I came back to WBMA, ABC 3340 in
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.920]  Birmingham, because when I was enduring the death threats, it was my former Alabama football
[56:26.920 --> 56:31.880]  family. And my teammates, my coaches who circled around me. Well, my read all about it. You
[56:31.880 --> 56:37.320]  can get the book right now, secret on the tarmac. It's at Christopher sign si g n dot com and
[56:37.320 --> 56:41.880]  on Amazon as well. All right. Thank you. All right. So a real man, somebody's parents
[56:41.880 --> 56:50.920]  and family to be proud of. A brave dive at one death. The coward's taste of death a thousand
[56:50.920 --> 56:57.720]  times, not me. And I'll tell you, again, they are bringing us into that wheelhouse. You see
[56:57.720 --> 57:01.000]  it in history books. You read about it. You talk to grandpa. You they'll tell you about
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.720]  it when they were alive. People go through this. People start fights and they don't leave
[57:04.720 --> 57:07.920]  you alone. They attack you and they start killing people. And at a certain point, you're
[57:07.920 --> 57:17.440]  just like, Well, all right. Let me just roll my sleeves up here. So I don't know what to
[57:17.440 --> 57:22.000]  say at this point. Nobody should be offensively violent against these people, but everybody
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.920]  should have their eyes peeled and be ready because they've used. I'll talk about it next
[57:25.920 --> 57:30.920]  hour. I knew this was coming for a long time, folks, but I just they're going to start the
[57:30.920 --> 57:49.160]  killing of journalists. Watch. That's next. And that's why we made one of our most popular
[57:49.160 --> 57:57.800]  formulas to date. Super male vitality, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper
[57:57.800 --> 58:04.960]  balance to create superior vitality in males. Now look, this unique formula promotes your
[58:04.960 --> 58:12.960]  body's own natural responses, and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[58:12.960 --> 58:20.440]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology working together in
[58:20.440 --> 58:25.760]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula. What
[58:25.760 --> 58:32.400]  are you waiting for? Go to the info or store. Never been a better time than right now. Super
[58:32.400 --> 58:41.160]  male vitality at info or store.com. The equation is very simple. The mega banks control the
[58:41.160 --> 58:48.040]  media. They control big pharma. They control academia. They control military industrial
[58:48.040 --> 58:53.880]  complex. They control big tech. And everywhere that they have been in control in the third
[58:53.880 --> 59:00.120]  world, they have established absolute total desperate system and dehumanization. It is
[59:00.120 --> 59:05.800]  the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's
[59:05.800 --> 59:10.560]  rights and so much more that actually threatens them. So because they can't defeat that empowering
[59:10.560 --> 59:17.720]  ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually
[59:17.720 --> 59:24.240]  destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[59:24.240 --> 59:28.680]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them. But
[59:28.680 --> 59:34.000]  the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[59:34.000 --> 59:39.640]  So redouble your efforts. We're all in this together.
[59:39.640 --> 1:00:03.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:03.320 --> 1:00:12.040]  So 45 year old Christopher Sign lived a long good life being a strong man and didn't compromise
[1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:16.840]  on his morals and didn't back down. And when he got the death threats and all the rest
[1:00:16.840 --> 1:00:21.240]  up for exposing the Clinton crime syndicate, he didn't go away. In fact, he put out a best
[1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:27.120]  selling book. By the way, I'm going to contact the family and make sure we buy a bunch of
[1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:31.480]  those. And that's one directive with the purchasing crew over there. I want to make sure that
[1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:35.520]  happens. So I told Chris Scott by some of his books that hasn't happened yet because
[1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:42.840]  I want to buy the book. I want to buy 10,000 at least of the book that Mr. Christopher
[1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:45.960]  Sign put out because that's something they definitely don't want us reading. And I want
[1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:51.400]  to send a message that you don't expose and surveil the Justice Department and the FBI
[1:00:51.400 --> 1:00:53.720]  while we're slicing up and selling this country off.
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:01:00.880]  I will kill you because we're real tough. Yeah, you're real tough. God is going to cut
[1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:06.320]  you down. I would not want to be you. By the way, you don't just face God after you die.
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:10.280]  I'm going to explain this to people. People call it karma or what goes around comes around.
[1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:15.240]  You know, report yourself. In my life, I never even wanted to do bad stuff. But every time
[1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:19.800]  I did bad stuff happened right after. I mean, I got a great life knock on wood because I
[1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:25.360]  really am a pretty good person. And I really want it. I treat people like I want to be
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:29.960]  treated. And when I don't do that, I'm guilty. Okay. And I try to make it better. I run around
[1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:33.640]  and all these other people, man, they just think that's weak or stupid. No, what's weak
[1:01:33.640 --> 1:01:40.320]  is shitting all over people. You fucking piece of shit, New World Order. And you think you're
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:44.480]  going to get away with it forever. You're not going to get away with it. But it doesn't
[1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:48.360]  matter. It's the way history works. What's supposed to happen. So you're just going to
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:57.840]  have to learn. I'm just glad they didn't kill his family in front of them. So that's what
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:01.640]  they do. Or vice versa. They tie you up, kill your family. And they kill you. It's their
[1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:10.200]  favorite thing. And I've already explained this. I've already I love my family so much
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:13.840]  that I know there's no future if we don't beat these globalists. So I've taken out of my
[1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:19.080]  mind the opposite of sociopath. But to where just my family, everything's collateral damage
[1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:24.760]  because it's a war. It's not like I asked for this. I can't let threats against my family
[1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:29.640]  govern me and make me stop what I'm doing. But I will not leave on the chessboard the
[1:02:29.640 --> 1:02:36.080]  chance of them having their victory against me to make me a villain where they kill me
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:40.640]  and my family and then blame me for it. So I've got to have people because I know I don't
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:43.840]  have to look at all the angles, folks. And it all just like a computer. Like it's working,
[1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:47.000]  working, working, working. The answer comes out. I always know what my answer is right.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:52.400]  And today I was already saying I need more security. I was already calling my security
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:56.000]  people to say this needs to be done. And then I saw this story on Info Wars. And I went
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.240]  and spent two hours reading all about the angles of it and it all just went. I've got
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:04.280]  to have people in my family at all times for any time I'm with them because I've seen them.
[1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:09.440]  There's just so many good men. You're like, colonels, special forces killed his wife and
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:14.040]  children. It's all because he exposed child trafficking or whatever. I mean, it's an MO.
[1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:20.360]  It's a it's a mode of operation that these people carry out and I will not be part of
[1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:24.680]  it. So here's the deal. I'm going to come back, cover all the news here on the other
[1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:28.280]  side. It's like a video game around here. And I could cut back this or that, but that
[1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:31.800]  would be fun things. I've already selling my house that I did as an investment to be
[1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:35.200]  able to fund things. And with the stupid real estate thing, it's gone up some that would
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:41.080]  run this place for a month or two, all the proceeds from it. And I need that for projects
[1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:45.080]  for working on that I'll just not get into here on air. Legal, lawful, very good things
[1:03:45.080 --> 1:03:49.960]  we do. A lot of what we do nobody ever knows about. That's great. That's my favorite.
[1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:57.400]  I don't have the money. I could sell my boat. What's it worth $30,000? I could I could I
[1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:03.760]  could sell my wife's watch at what's that worth $5,000. The point is, I'm not bitching.
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:09.440]  I'm just asking you because I get to the point where we're in the black, the first five months
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:14.880]  of this year in the red. And then we go in the black for like a month and then the sale
[1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:17.560]  ends and then we're not going to bring enough money to keep operating at the level we are.
[1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:23.440]  And I need to be able to get security for peace of mind so that I know that they can't
[1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:26.400]  set me up like this. Because they're going to kill me. They're going to do it right out
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:30.440]  in the open or set me up or send me to prison or have it kill me in a four-way stop saying
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:34.440]  it's a carjacking or something like that. I'm not going to I'm not going to let them
[1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:39.040]  do their favorite thing at my house with everybody tied up. So please go to infowarstore.com and

[1:06:38.800 --> 1:07:05.800]  All right, folks, welcome back. We are now into our number two on this live Sunday broadcast.
[1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:10.160]  I got really upset because it crystallized for me all the rhetoric or the loveless are
[1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:13.880]  going and all the preparations and all their statements and things they say and what they
[1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:16.000]  want to do and their love of G.G.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:21.080]  Ping and authoritarianism and dictatorship reporter who broke Clinton lynched tarmac
[1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:29.000]  story and received significant death threats found dead 45 year old Christopher Stein
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:32.320]  and the mainstream media, of course, is like, well, police think it might be a suicide.
[1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:39.200]  Yeah, right. I mean, I've interviewed so many people like Gary Webb, who exposed the
[1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:45.000]  CIA drug trafficking. And when I went and saw that documentary about him, it was a film,
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:53.040]  but it felt like a documentary. And I got physically sick watching. Because I mean,
[1:07:53.040 --> 1:07:57.040]  I lived that I knew him well, interviewed him like 10 times. I was going to put a website
[1:07:57.040 --> 1:08:01.600]  up with all his findings when his book came out. We were working together. And he said,
[1:08:01.600 --> 1:08:05.480]  well, I just had some spooks special office times break into my house and try to break
[1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:08.800]  into my safe and stuff. So I got to move. But I'm ready to come on your show in about
[1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:13.000]  a month. Can you get this website up? And then boom, he was dead shot twice in the back
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:18.200]  of the head. He fought back. So they shot him in the back of the head blew the jaw first
[1:08:18.200 --> 1:08:22.120]  and then got him in the back of the head of the shotgun. And they changed the story a
[1:08:22.120 --> 1:08:28.080]  whole bunch of times on that. So I've just lived this too much. And it's the same Clinton
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:33.200]  FBI that burned down Waco, Ruby Wedge. Oh, it's just the same people. They're a bunch
[1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:38.840]  of crazy murderous lawyers. And they're just completely out of control. And they've never
[1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:43.240]  been held accountable for anything they do. So they get more psychotic, more demonic,
[1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:50.280]  more crazy by the day. And they again, they're running giant criminal operations all over
[1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:55.760]  the country, all over the world, child kidnapping rings, child molestation rings, the whole,
[1:08:55.760 --> 1:08:59.840]  the whole UN child trafficking program is like all over the news. It's all confirmed, just
[1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:05.280]  gigantic amount of information. We just just type in United Nations child trafficking.
[1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:09.880]  And it's just thousands of articles. In some cases, tens of thousands of children per country
[1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:15.440]  kidnapped little babies, it killed in snuff films. I mean, when you start to understand
[1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:20.960]  just how sick these people are, they're just whacked out beyond anything you could ever
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:27.720]  imagine. And I've got all this incredible news to cover tonight so much. I did so much
[1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:31.640]  preparation for the show today. And I haven't gotten to a lot of that just because I've
[1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:40.960]  been busy on this because they want a message to reporters. You do not report on Bill Clinton
[1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:47.680]  with the Attorney General on the tarmac saying do not investigate, drop the criminal investigation
[1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:56.360]  of my wife for all the missing emails and the red-handed information. And it just goes
[1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:02.680]  on from there. Yeah, Laura Sillsby got convicted smuggling kids out of Haiti, a bunch of them
[1:10:02.680 --> 1:10:07.360]  disappeared. And then she just changed her name and now she runs Amber Alert. Can't make
[1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:12.760]  that up. Who do you put in charge of the missing children? Oh, you put her. She'll make sure
[1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:19.040]  they get found. Hey, we just found this little girl. She says she's five years old. She says
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:23.200]  this is her name. She wants her mommy. She says her mommy lives in the... Oh, well, we'll
[1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:30.960]  make sure that report gets right over to the FBI. I mean, can you imagine being these people?
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:38.760]  Because they've got, just like they had Peter Dazik and all these Agenda 21 into the world
[1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:46.840]  transhumanist globalist running the Wuhan lab and then Facebook's fact-checkers before
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:53.360]  they released the virus was based out of the Wuhan lab. That's their threat fusion command
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:59.120]  spy base. Because before you launch it, you war game every angle. You look at every angle.
[1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:03.800]  You get ready. And then you roll it out. And then you've got the place that launched it
[1:11:03.800 --> 1:11:07.760]  that you know is going to get attacked for it with the fact-checkers that are then running
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:14.880]  Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, everything. And then they wrote the landscape document.
[1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:18.280]  And the doctors that got it were told, you will put your names to this because we give
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:22.240]  you research money around the world. Do not say I'm on it. Well, they leak the document
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:27.240]  because they have morals. Well, then a couple of them will probably end up getting killed.
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:35.920]  Well, that's fine. You can't kill us all. You murdering garbage. And I go on for hours.
[1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:44.280]  You understand that's all I do all day is study this basically. All day. And when you
[1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:51.680]  sit there and you look at somebody on TV saying, let's start arresting members of Congress.
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:59.600]  They're globalists. And then you go research who they are. And it's just, oh my God, it's
[1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:04.040]  the same group. Articles about we shouldn't have children. Humans are bad. Eating meat's
[1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:10.000]  bad. World government's what we need. Peter Dazik. And then they lie to you and gaslight
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:15.600]  you. Fiona Hill was on 60 minutes last year attacking me saying I was threatening her
[1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:21.000]  and being mean to her and did nothing to her. And she goes, they say I'm a globalist. I
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  don't even know what a globalist is. She was the head of George Soros' main foundation.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:41.620]  And she's the chief writer, lead writer at TheGlobalist.com. Again, that's like Bill
[1:12:41.620 --> 1:12:48.320]  Acheck saying I have no affiliation in my entire life with the New England Patriots.
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:57.040]  It's preposterous in your face. But that's what you'd expect from Prince Valiant. She
[1:12:57.040 --> 1:13:03.200]  has nothing but disrespect for you, nothing but disdain for you. And I mean, just look
[1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:09.160]  at her. She's a miserable monster. And why do we let these people run our lives? Because
[1:13:09.160 --> 1:13:14.280]  they think they're insulated from the crimes they commit. They think they're insulated
[1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:19.200]  from being exposed. And they are. Remember the guy that made up all the fake stuff about
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:23.880]  Ukraine and that Trump was on the phone call saying quid pro quo and all that? Then they
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:29.640]  released the transcript. It wasn't true because any presidential call is a transcript of it.
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:36.360]  And then you couldn't say Eric C. Ramallah because they want their little turds, their
[1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:43.600]  little spiders, their little rats, their little sacks of garbage to think that they have immunity.
[1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:50.080]  Well, you don't have immunity from God, you little sack of trash. And you had Vittman
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:58.520]  and all these people and you don't have immunity once you push your little rat snout too far.
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:05.280]  There's the deal. They are wimps. So they want domination and conquest and war with
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:11.880]  us because they, I mean, I'm not against nerds. I don't even get into what you call a nerd
[1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:15.280]  because a little guy can be little or into computers, be a great person. But there's
[1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:20.600]  a certain type of person that wants to be an alpha, but they're not. And then they get
[1:14:20.600 --> 1:14:24.560]  into being nerdly and that's like they're covered to commit their crimes. And then anybody
[1:14:24.560 --> 1:14:31.160]  that they would call in modern parlance a chad or someone is the enemy and will show
[1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:36.160]  will show you chads while we'll inject you with poison and sit back and watch you die.
[1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:42.880]  They're crazy little scientists like Fauci and Gates and all of them are psychos who
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:51.480]  swab and all the most untrustworthy degenerate filth and it's because men that are strong,
[1:14:51.480 --> 1:14:58.200]  men that have will don't want power and control. So we just sit back and think and we'll just
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:07.880]  take care of our family, but these guys aren't going to leave us alone. And so all these
[1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:14.120]  people that look like they're from a James Bond Legion of Doom meeting aren't going
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:18.680]  to stop because it's their evil grasping nature. They can't help it. They're compelled
[1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:25.480]  to scrabble and grasp it power and cook up megalomaniac plots because they're criminals.
[1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:29.480]  And they always push too far in history until we have to stand up and stop them. The question
[1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:33.800]  is how do we do that where they don't turn it around and turn themselves into victims
[1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:38.560]  and defeat humanity in the process. And I've got a plan and I've got a lot more to cover
[1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:44.160]  on the other side. Stay with us.

[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:51.160]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller Oil Industry in 1900 with the Petrochemical.
[1:16:51.160 --> 1:16:57.560]  The Petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs. Companies
[1:16:57.560 --> 1:17:04.120]  began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs. The natural sources were then
[1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:09.880]  made illegal. Pharmaceuticals became medicine. And the sicker people got, the more their
[1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:15.640]  industry grew. It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape. Good health
[1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:22.040]  begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive. Nutrients,
[1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:27.600]  we cannot readily get from our food today. The combinations of Vitamin C and Zinc and
[1:17:27.600 --> 1:17:33.520]  Vitamin D3 with Calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:39.720]  system. Go to InfoWarsStore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the Mega

[1:17:45.720 --> 1:17:52.080]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak,
[1:17:52.080 --> 1:17:55.680]  making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the
[1:17:55.680 --> 1:18:01.240]  image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will. Being
[1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:07.240]  given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:11.960]  an entire system. And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact you're
[1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:16.520]  able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty
[1:18:16.520 --> 1:18:20.840]  of your wife or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[1:18:20.840 --> 1:18:26.000]  of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  that itself is what God teaches us is worship. So don't worship the globalist, don't worship
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:36.960]  the NFL, don't worship all the things of the system, but worship the things of God because
[1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:41.920]  we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still
[1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:44.520]  have it while you still have it.
[1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:49.360]  Fourteen months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses,
[1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:54.120]  the third world dies. We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving
[1:18:54.120 --> 1:19:00.280]  parts that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate
[1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:04.320]  the third world and really hurt the first world. Well, now you're hearing about gas
[1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:08.160]  shortages all over the United States. And that's because the companies and the systems
[1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:12.400]  of the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut
[1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:16.400]  down. Plus, the Keystone Pipelines have been shut down, along with other pipelines. The
[1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:21.800]  left is now blowing up dams across the U.S. We're being shut down. Our coal power plants
[1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:26.960]  are off as well. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave. The third world is imploding
[1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:30.680]  as well. The borders have been removed. Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com
[1:19:30.680 --> 1:19:34.840]  takeover, Gregory said, you have no hope. They're announcing that there will be less
[1:19:34.840 --> 1:19:40.240]  than two thirds of the gas needed this summer. So they told you that you're under lockdown
[1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:47.680]  one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:57.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:19:57.680 --> 1:20:26.080]  The war is not coming, my friends. The war is here. And I'm going to lay out the 35,000
[1:20:26.080 --> 1:20:36.480]  people that have been shut down. I'm really impressed with the Sky TV host out of Australia,
[1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:43.640]  Corey Bernardi and some of the others. They're getting right up there at Tucker Carlson level
[1:20:43.640 --> 1:20:49.560]  with their analysis of what's really going on. And this is just a short clip of him talking
[1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:55.560]  about how now there's things you've had the so-called COVID vaccine. It's a gene therapy
[1:20:55.560 --> 1:21:01.080]  unapproved. It was done by emergency authorization. Just remember that. That if you've taken it,
[1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:09.800]  don't fly for several weeks. Now, we pointed this out months ago. I mean, they have heavily
[1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:16.520]  studied, heavily studied what they're injecting people with. You know, wait a minute. You
[1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:23.200]  just said 60 seconds ago that this was emergency approved, unstudied. It's not been studied
[1:21:23.200 --> 1:21:30.440]  by the regular FDA protocols that aren't perfect, but are still extensive. And you still have
[1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:34.600]  problem vaccines and tainted vaccines and side effects they try to cover up, but that's
[1:21:34.600 --> 1:21:43.000]  come out. That's a kickbook, a walk in the park compared to what's going on now. This
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:49.240]  is heavily tested gene therapy by a file chief, the University of Texas, and literally hundreds
[1:21:49.240 --> 1:21:56.560]  of other universities. They've been obsessed with the proteins in Corona and SARS viruses
[1:21:56.560 --> 1:22:05.480]  for 20 years and Fauci's funded hundreds of studies. And they know that if you give somebody
[1:22:05.480 --> 1:22:17.560]  this, it causes autoimmune problems, allergic reactions, and holes in your lungs, holes
[1:22:17.560 --> 1:22:24.040]  in your heart, holes in your brain. When your brain starts bleeding, they call that a stroke.
[1:22:24.040 --> 1:22:30.760]  So they heavily studied it. That's what's so incredible is I've looked at no exaggeration,
[1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:35.840]  hundreds of studies. I've read more than 50 of them, but it's always the same study
[1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:39.400]  over and over again. I've scanned them. I've shown you a bunch of them here on air. And
[1:22:39.400 --> 1:22:43.560]  that's what's crazy about this is you're reading where they go, do not give this to humans.
[1:22:43.560 --> 1:22:48.320]  It killed most of the rats. Do not give this to humans. It killed all of the ferrets. Do
[1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:52.560]  not give this to, and you're just, and it's like, that's what all the top scientists last
[1:22:52.560 --> 1:22:58.880]  year said, don't do it. It will cause blood clots. It will hurt you. And it'll grow this
[1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:05.720]  stuff in your body forever. And each subsequent time you take the shot, it'll get worse. So
[1:23:05.720 --> 1:23:11.480]  that would be like, well, you took two, maybe three or four fives, what you need. I mean,
[1:23:11.480 --> 1:23:22.800]  this is, man, this is, this is cold blooded. But see, they commit a crime so heinous that
[1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:26.880]  no one will ever want to admit they did this. And you look at trendies and liberals, I'm
[1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:32.560]  going to show you some truly sickening footage next segment. It's very sad of what they've
[1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:44.560]  done to our people coming up. But right now, let's go to Corey Bernardi over in Australia
[1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:49.240]  talking about what the real enemy is, the globalist, the most untrustworthy, big pharma,
[1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:53.560]  big mega banks that loot the world, that run scams, that run assassination squads. You
[1:23:53.560 --> 1:23:57.560]  know the I'm from World Bank, have assassination squads. It's come out in the news. I mean,
[1:23:57.560 --> 1:24:01.600]  who do you think's going to do the killing? Who do you think's going to kill Alex Jones,
[1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:06.160]  Tucker Carlson? Who do you think's going to make a move on President Trump if we don't
[1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:12.040]  back down? We're not backing down. We can't back down. It's not in us. It can't happen.
[1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:19.840]  You know, Colonel Travis wrote that last letter to his family, to his son and daughter, the
[1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:26.160]  son and my family's keeping on that, on that piece of wallpaper. And he just said, victory
[1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:29.280]  or death, I can't back down. You know, at that point, he felt more alive than he ever
[1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:37.720]  felt. He wasn't a loser. He was a winner. Just like the modern Colonel Travis, this
[1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:46.760]  man that died, who exposed the Clintons and a little Lynch and the FBI and the whole system.
[1:24:46.760 --> 1:24:51.360]  That's the reality. They live forever. Not all the scum, not all the trash, not all
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:55.600]  the cowards, but here is Corey Bernardi laying it out.
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:25:00.960]  Well, here's another inconvenient truth. In other parts of the world, airlines are now
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:07.800]  advising people who have been vaccinated not to fly. Yep, you heard me correctly. Airlines
[1:25:07.800 --> 1:25:12.040]  in Spain and Russia are warning people who have been vaccinated against coronavirus not
[1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:16.760]  to travel because of the risk of blood clots. Now, this is a well-known risk of long-haul
[1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:21.560]  flights, but it apparently is exacerbated by the potential side effects, the clotting
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:28.280]  side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines. It's just another sign that there really isn't
[1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:33.680]  anybody in a position of authority. You can truly trust any more. And therein lies the
[1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:39.320]  problem. The global push is towards empowering the clearly untrustables with even more authority
[1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:45.240]  and control over all of us. These people are already rewriting history to suit themselves.
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:50.080]  They're poisoning our children's minds with harmful and damaging concepts about race and
[1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:56.160]  gender fluidity in schools. They're now insisting we submit to a global medical experiment even
[1:25:56.160 --> 1:26:02.360]  while they've demonstrated they're making little more than educated guesses as to why.
[1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:08.600]  For decades, these totalitarians have been taking baby steps towards their final goal,
[1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:14.600]  but now they're sprinting towards the finishing line, sensing that victory is near at hand.
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:19.000]  So it's now up to us to put a stop to this madness. We can't rely on government, I should
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:24.400]  say, to do it for us because government are actually a big part of the problem. We need
[1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:30.240]  less of them and we need more of us. Us individuals who ought to be able to make decisions for
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:36.280]  ourselves who can wean ourselves off of government dependency and can pursue a mission of individual
[1:26:36.280 --> 1:26:42.720]  autonomy and decentralised authority. And the decentralisation agenda, it's rapidly
[1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:47.640]  emerging mostly through the use of blockchain technology. It is going to be a game changer
[1:26:47.640 --> 1:26:52.680]  and it's what governments fear most. It will make the army of paper shufflers who exert
[1:26:52.680 --> 1:26:58.240]  power over us entirely redundant. It will radically change trade and commerce, money
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:04.160]  and information as we know it. It will bring immutable trust back into the system while
[1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:10.440]  allowing freedom to reign. So try as they might to resist Liberty's bell from ringing. The
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:15.040]  established powers cannot stop what is coming. That's why they've redoubled their efforts
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:22.680]  to advance their own agenda. But that rush has only exposed their frailty and their hypocrisy
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:27.520]  slowly but surely the people will wake up. And that's what these plutocratic elites
[1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:32.160]  fear. That's what these plutocratic elites fear. You're absolutely right. Well said.
[1:27:32.160 --> 1:27:38.480]  I wish I could say it so crisply, so succinctly in two minutes. But that's exactly what we're
[1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:46.680]  facing. And what he's hinting at there that I'll cover next segment is why they're bringing
[1:27:46.680 --> 1:27:52.240]  everything down, why they're doing this now. And I'm going to explain to you the numbers
[1:27:52.240 --> 1:27:57.760]  from IMF World Bank documents that Greg Pallas of the BBC, back with the BBC did a decent
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:06.800]  job some of the time, in 2002. And he got thousands of pages of IMF World Bank documents
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:13.040]  linked to him about how they planned next in America within 20 years in Europe to bankrupt
[1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:19.320]  and enslave everyone financially the same way they did in Africa, Latin America and Asia.
[1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:22.400]  People are poor in those places. They've ever let them get wealthy, folks. And then they
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:26.320]  dumbed them down and had them fight with each other using the media. And now they're going
[1:28:26.320 --> 1:28:32.080]  to do that here. In fact, they've done that here. So it's all coming up straight ahead
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:36.160]  right here on the Info War. Remember, we don't know how long we're going to be here, folks.
[1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:43.160]  They could take me on any day. We're that expensive. Stay with us.
[1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:52.160]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:59.160]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine. Triple eight, two five, three,
[1:28:59.160 --> 1:29:03.160]  three, one, three, nine. Triple eight, two five, three, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:29:03.160 --> 1:29:08.640]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine. Triple eight, two five, three,
[1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:14.660]  three, one, three, nine. Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[1:30:48.660 --> 1:30:53.660]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including

[1:31:43.660 --> 1:31:53.660]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[1:31:53.660 --> 1:32:03.660]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning. It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension
[1:32:03.660 --> 1:32:09.660]  so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come down to that.
[1:32:09.660 --> 1:32:17.660]  As sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[1:32:17.660 --> 1:32:27.660]  God is the author of us having our own will. God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[1:32:27.660 --> 1:32:34.660]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult,
[1:32:34.660 --> 1:32:39.660]  it's all about dominating your free will. It's all about telling you you're dirty and you're ugly and you're in the bad
[1:32:39.660 --> 1:33:06.660]  because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[1:33:06.660 --> 1:33:19.660]  So again, to understand our story where we are, former assistant FBI director says arresting GOP Congress people may be needed to really tackle terrorism.
[1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:24.660]  You see, it was our statements by Joe Biden's statement, number one threat to America is white people.
[1:33:24.660 --> 1:33:32.660]  Then he says there's global warming, which means people too. It's all divide and conquer folks and we can't take the bait on that.
[1:33:32.660 --> 1:33:38.660]  But we have to understand that they're creating real division. So there's going to be black people that buy the propaganda and become violent.
[1:33:38.660 --> 1:33:48.660]  There's going to be white people to do it, just like the guy that went and shot up that church. Remember? In the Carolinas.
[1:33:48.660 --> 1:33:59.660]  And that's why the left then wants to control the narrative. We'll explain that in a moment. But first, here is that individual, Frank Figliuzzi,
[1:33:59.660 --> 1:34:06.660]  on TV last week saying arrest members of Congress with no evidence under anti-terrorism, frustrate their networks.
[1:34:06.660 --> 1:34:10.660]  That's all terms like drone strikes, but these are all terms.
[1:34:10.660 --> 1:34:20.660]  And then you wonder why a reporter gets exposed, the Clintons and the tarmac and the FBI helped bring the Clintons down to a great extent from getting back into office.
[1:34:20.660 --> 1:34:28.660]  Let's say this, he crippled them. Well, he gets shot in the head and we're told before his body's even cold that it was suicide.
[1:34:28.660 --> 1:34:34.660]  That always lets you know if he was murdered. So here he is making this outrageous statement.
[1:34:34.660 --> 1:34:39.660]  I mean, if I was up here saying without trial, let's arrest members of Congress, I would say I should be off the air.
[1:34:39.660 --> 1:34:43.660]  I don't agree with that. I want a trial for everybody.
[1:34:43.660 --> 1:34:50.660]  Now, to people like Maxine Waters and Dianne Feinstein that have been proven to be on the Chinese payroll and Mitch McConnell,
[1:34:50.660 --> 1:34:53.660]  do they deserve to go to prison for what they've done? Yes.
[1:34:53.660 --> 1:34:58.660]  But I wouldn't want it without a trial because that's something that could happen to my kids or to me. I'm not stupid.
[1:34:58.660 --> 1:35:01.660]  That's why we have rules. So I'm protected and so are you.
[1:35:01.660 --> 1:35:09.660]  But see, these jerks, they always get rid of the chivalry. They always get rid of the rules, taking one step ahead, not five steps ahead.
[1:35:09.660 --> 1:35:14.660]  And then they're just in my wheelhouse at that point.
[1:35:14.660 --> 1:35:21.660]  When I say my wheelhouse, people like me, I don't want war. I don't want death. I don't want any of it.
[1:35:21.660 --> 1:35:29.660]  But I'm like a pig in slop once it starts. And there's a lot of people like me who've been like asleep, dormant.
[1:35:29.660 --> 1:35:37.660]  And I really feel sorry for the establishment because I've looked at every possible exit from this and it does not end well for them.
[1:35:37.660 --> 1:35:41.660]  Anyway, they slice it.
[1:35:41.660 --> 1:35:44.660]  Because you know why they can't stop what they're doing, right?
[1:35:44.660 --> 1:35:52.660]  And that's a subject for another day, but they've got all this scum under them and all this corruption and all the people that had to pay off that have been promised all this power and money.
[1:35:52.660 --> 1:36:01.660]  And so as the Ponzi scheme builds and his money's worth less and less, and as all their scams come to a head and as all the financial systems fall apart,
[1:36:01.660 --> 1:36:07.660]  they need a control grid in place that's their security from their crimes.
[1:36:07.660 --> 1:36:10.660]  Because justice is coming for all the things they've done.
[1:36:10.660 --> 1:36:15.660]  And so they need to have a police state in place because they've committed so many crimes.
[1:36:15.660 --> 1:36:19.660]  I need security because I'm fighting criminals. They're coming after me.
[1:36:19.660 --> 1:36:29.660]  But with them, they've got to have tyranny, which they believe is their security from liberty.
[1:36:29.660 --> 1:36:36.660]  So here's Frank Figliuzzi with his declaration of war saying he wants the CIA to arrest members of Congress.
[1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:44.660]  That's what Saki's called for, Biden's called for. This is such a criminal statement. Here it is.
[1:36:44.660 --> 1:36:50.660]  Look, Chris Ray testified publicly on the Hill that what happened on January 6th is domestic terrorism.
[1:36:50.660 --> 1:37:00.660]  What have we learned from our experience with international terrorism? In order to address that problem, arresting low-level operatives is merely a speed bump, not a roadblock.
[1:37:00.660 --> 1:37:10.660]  In order to really tackle terrorism, and this time domestically, you've got to attack and dismantle the command and control element of a terrorist group.
[1:37:10.660 --> 1:37:12.660]  And unfortunately, and I know this is painful.
[1:37:12.660 --> 1:37:23.660]  Take it back to the beginning. I know this is painful. We've got to attack. That means kill and dismantle. That means dismember.
[1:37:23.660 --> 1:37:35.660]  Shut down. The brain trust that's the Republicans that don't want to turn the guns in or have pedophiles teach the kids or open the borders and let all you weird lawyers run everything and sell us out to whoever.
[1:37:35.660 --> 1:37:43.660]  Well, I'm a little scumbag lawyer. I wear a fancy suit. Out on to me. I mean, oh, oh, oh, arrest you. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer.
[1:37:43.660 --> 1:37:52.660]  I mean, it's just crazy. I mean, what a psychotic statement. I showed Judge Joe Brown that he couldn't even believe that that was even said.
[1:37:52.660 --> 1:37:54.660]  You just go back to it.
[1:37:54.660 --> 1:38:06.660]  Chris Ray testified publicly on the Hill that what happened on January 6th is domestic terrorism. What have we learned from our experience with international terrorism?
[1:38:06.660 --> 1:38:10.660]  In order to address that problem, arresting low-level operatives is merely a speed bump, not a roadblock.
[1:38:10.660 --> 1:38:20.660]  In order to really tackle terrorism, and this time domestically, you've got to attack and dismantle the command and control element of a terrorist group.
[1:38:20.660 --> 1:38:29.660]  And unfortunately, and I know this is painful to hear, that may mean people sitting in Congress right now, people in and around the former president.
[1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:38.660]  That's how you do this. Otherwise, recruitment, inciting and cult-like leadership continues to recruit people to violence.
[1:38:38.660 --> 1:38:48.660]  Cult-like leadership. Have you seen the leftist lately? I'm going to get more to this in a moment, but let's play clip nine.
[1:38:48.660 --> 1:38:52.660]  This is a real video. I'm only going to play part of this. It's very painful.
[1:38:52.660 --> 1:39:01.660]  Young girl declares over megaphone that she is now a male, and people here cry and hug her.
[1:39:01.660 --> 1:39:06.660]  And this is what they teach in school. You've heard about the colleges where, oh, someone came in protesting.
[1:39:06.660 --> 1:39:12.660]  It made them so upset, so they were given Play-Doh, and they sit at one foot tall tables like their babies again.
[1:39:12.660 --> 1:39:18.660]  They're given Crayolas and Play-Doh, and they come in the office and they cry from the undercover footage like five years ago,
[1:39:18.660 --> 1:39:23.660]  pocket constitutions were being handed out, so they run in and cry and go, help me, mommy.
[1:39:23.660 --> 1:39:30.660]  And they go, oh, here's your Play-Doh. This is weird, arrested development, mental illness stuff.
[1:39:30.660 --> 1:39:35.660]  But now, once they invoke you into this, your couch potato, you've done nothing in your life.
[1:39:35.660 --> 1:39:43.660]  And instead of saying, man, I've done nothing in my life, just say, I'm a boy or I'm a girl. And it's like, declare your biology isn't real.
[1:39:43.660 --> 1:39:49.660]  To declare who you are even more doesn't exist. So they create all these people who never worked in their life,
[1:39:49.660 --> 1:39:56.660]  never had a job, been brainwashed by leftist behavior and manipulation.
[1:39:56.660 --> 1:40:04.660]  And then all they can do is just squeal and squawk and scream because this person has declared themselves something else.
[1:40:04.660 --> 1:40:09.660]  It's the celebration of transhumanism. And there's the weird social worker in the pink dress like,
[1:40:09.660 --> 1:40:17.660]  approvingly looking on it, what they've done to people, it just goes on and on. Here it is.
[1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:24.660]  It's kind of scary because I only realized this a couple of days ago, and I've only come out to a few people.
[1:40:24.660 --> 1:40:35.660]  I'm a guy.
[1:40:35.660 --> 1:40:44.660]  I used to pee in a ton of, and I'm going to go by Theo.
[1:40:44.660 --> 1:40:47.660]  I told my mom today.
[1:40:47.660 --> 1:40:54.660]  So these are the lost, helpless people that the system is now in total control of.
[1:40:54.660 --> 1:40:59.660]  And we've got to take care of them. We're going to pay for their welfare.
[1:40:59.660 --> 1:41:02.660]  We're going to pay for their strengths. We're going to pay for their sex changes.
[1:41:02.660 --> 1:41:10.660]  Women are now having their breasts removed because they're saying, I am a man.
[1:41:10.660 --> 1:41:17.660]  So I've got to have my breasts removed. In some cases, they're having their uterus removed because, you know,
[1:41:17.660 --> 1:41:21.660]  that's an affliction on their identity. And they're reported that white women,
[1:41:21.660 --> 1:41:30.660]  particularly in the United States and the UK, have the highest rate of mental illness of anyone on planet Earth.
[1:41:30.660 --> 1:41:40.660]  Then meanwhile, there's a group of men wearing clown outfits that they call, whatever it is, saying they're women and that's the new femininity.
[1:41:40.660 --> 1:41:45.660]  And this is all just a jam up culture, depopulate, break down society.
[1:41:45.660 --> 1:41:51.660]  While we have former assistant FBI directors saying, I know it's painful.
[1:41:51.660 --> 1:41:59.660]  We got to take out and dismantle and attack Congress.
[1:41:59.660 --> 1:42:05.660]  We're the CIA, not a couple of hundred people that break in and then somebody poops on the floor.
[1:42:05.660 --> 1:42:09.660]  But we need to shut down the resistance in America.
[1:42:09.660 --> 1:42:18.660]  And so now they're spoiling for that war, spoiling for this big event where the left conquers America.
[1:42:18.660 --> 1:42:25.660]  And all the Russians and the Chinese do is look at this and say, you're conquering your own people and waging war on your strongest people.
[1:42:25.660 --> 1:42:31.660]  We see you as weak, so suddenly China and others are doing nothing the US says because we're a joke, folks.
[1:42:31.660 --> 1:42:36.660]  But the left doesn't care. If you're a weird lawyer like this big Lucy guy, he's born to hate this country.
[1:42:36.660 --> 1:42:43.660]  His one mission is to take us down. His spirit is kill America.
[1:42:43.660 --> 1:42:50.660]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there, about looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist,
[1:42:50.660 --> 1:42:57.660]  that the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them,
[1:42:57.660 --> 1:42:59.660]  that they deserve to be killed.
[1:42:59.660 --> 1:43:02.660]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists. They play God.
[1:43:02.660 --> 1:43:06.660]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[1:43:06.660 --> 1:43:11.660]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to harm you. They've tried to get you to join them.
[1:43:11.660 --> 1:43:17.660]  But metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit. I'm the connection with God.
[1:43:17.660 --> 1:43:20.660]  And I know that God does not like that. So I cannot join the enemy.
[1:43:20.660 --> 1:43:29.660]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power out of it.
[1:43:29.660 --> 1:43:35.660]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[1:43:35.660 --> 1:43:42.660]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like.
[1:43:42.660 --> 1:43:43.660]  And that's a fact.

[1:45:44.660 --> 1:45:57.660]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical. The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[1:45:57.660 --> 1:46:05.660]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs. The natural sources were then made illegal.
[1:46:05.660 --> 1:46:11.660]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine. And the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[1:46:11.660 --> 1:46:15.660]  It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape.
[1:46:15.660 --> 1:46:21.660]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[1:46:21.660 --> 1:46:25.660]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[1:46:25.660 --> 1:46:34.660]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.

[1:46:43.660 --> 1:46:49.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:46:49.660 --> 1:47:14.660]  The Great Owen Schroyer is coming in to host two hours of live radio slash TV and I'm going to go ahead and co-host with him because I got almost emotional,
[1:47:14.660 --> 1:47:22.660]  preachery in the first hours, but most of the time on this great reporter that exposed the whole FBI being under the control of the deep state,
[1:47:22.660 --> 1:47:30.660]  went mafia, getting his head blown off of his house. And I got hit all this other news. So let me hit as much as I can right now.
[1:47:30.660 --> 1:47:36.660]  And then if your local station doesn't carry Sunday Live, Sunday, 6th APM Central Owen Schroyer, it should.
[1:47:36.660 --> 1:47:45.660]  But if they're not, we understand, just tune in to infowars.com, or band.video. Those links get banned on Twitter and Facebook.
[1:47:45.660 --> 1:47:54.660]  So you can share this URL to get around the sensors. This is the latest URL we're using. That is freeworldnews.tv, freeworldnews.tv.
[1:47:54.660 --> 1:48:04.660]  And then again, if you're watching this as a tape transmission later, I would just simply ask that you click below and share the link.
[1:48:04.660 --> 1:48:12.660]  Okay, let me, again, this all ties together. And I want to walk through all this because the globalists want to kill black people.
[1:48:12.660 --> 1:48:19.660]  They want to sterilize black people. They do more illegal testing, more weird, evil crap to black people than anybody else.
[1:48:19.660 --> 1:48:25.660]  I mean, if I tried to even go through it, it would take 10 years, okay? Everybody knows about injecting black folks with syphilis,
[1:48:25.660 --> 1:48:31.660]  and everybody knows about them giving them polio in Africa and getting caught, and Bill Gates getting caught.
[1:48:31.660 --> 1:48:36.660]  I mean, that's in Reuters, folks. This is out there. It would just take me 10 years, quite frankly.
[1:48:36.660 --> 1:48:41.660]  There's always new stuff you're learning. It's so horrible.
[1:48:41.660 --> 1:48:50.660]  But then the very group killing black people and dumbing them down and skipping drugs in their neighborhoods and giving them gangster rap on record to cause them to kill each other
[1:48:50.660 --> 1:48:58.660]  so they could then be put in prison tells you all day how much they love black people and how they're just so sweet.
[1:48:58.660 --> 1:49:05.660]  And you drive down the road, almost all the billboards are black people for every corporation, and all the big TV ads are black people.
[1:49:05.660 --> 1:49:13.660]  The globalist corporations are putting a black face on everything they do because they go, oh, black people are victims,
[1:49:13.660 --> 1:49:22.660]  and you got to be nice to them, and then the corporations then say, we're black people. It's very simple camouflage because if you're going to kill the black people,
[1:49:22.660 --> 1:49:28.660]  you are going to then sit there and carry out your operations and say, black people are doing this.
[1:49:28.660 --> 1:49:35.660]  And at some conscious level, if you hate the government, you hate the corporations, you hate the UN, you hate the chicoms, you hate all this,
[1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:39.660]  and then it's got a black face, what do you do?
[1:49:39.660 --> 1:49:45.660]  So I don't sit up here like some white savior and go, oh, the poor black people, they're victims. I'm saying this because they're black and I love them.
[1:49:45.660 --> 1:49:49.660]  They're just people like me. They better figure this out or get dead just like me.
[1:49:49.660 --> 1:49:53.660]  We're all in the same boat here. We're not Klaus Schwab. We're not Bill Gates.
[1:49:53.660 --> 1:49:59.660]  Do we love God or we love Satan? Or are we a dumbass that says neither one exists? That's the three choices.
[1:49:59.660 --> 1:50:05.660]  You're for Satan, you're for God, or you're a dumbass? And of course, Satanists are dumbasses too, but not as dumb as those that say there is no God.
[1:50:05.660 --> 1:50:10.660]  So here's a great example of this.
[1:50:10.660 --> 1:50:19.660]  Most of the mass shootings in America that you hear about that are still pretty rare are gang related.
[1:50:19.660 --> 1:50:24.660]  So it's Hispanic on Hispanic. It's black on black.
[1:50:24.660 --> 1:50:28.660]  And when it is a gang of whites, sometimes motorcycle gangs, it's white on white.
[1:50:28.660 --> 1:50:37.660]  Look at the Hell's Angels and the group they were fighting out in California all over the country, the Mongols.
[1:50:37.660 --> 1:50:43.660]  So that's how it works. So when I hear about nightclub shot up in Miami, no one would say what it was about.
[1:50:43.660 --> 1:50:46.660]  So I looked it up. It's a black nightclub.
[1:50:46.660 --> 1:50:50.660]  And I go, hmm, I bet black people went and shot that up.
[1:50:50.660 --> 1:50:52.660]  Sure enough, it was two rival gangs.
[1:50:52.660 --> 1:50:56.660]  Thought about what color they were. It's the reality of it.
[1:50:56.660 --> 1:51:02.660]  If I hear some right wing square dance going on in the middle of Alabama, I had a shooting at it.
[1:51:02.660 --> 1:51:07.660]  And I go, well, that must be some white gangs killed each other. Of course, happens every once in a while. It is.
[1:51:07.660 --> 1:51:11.660]  So here's what I'm getting at, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:51:11.660 --> 1:51:16.660]  This story is so huge because it's not about protecting black people.
[1:51:16.660 --> 1:51:24.660]  It's about the media, the controlled corporate media being able to set the precedent that whenever they want, they can hide a fact.
[1:51:24.660 --> 1:51:29.660]  Because I can tell you right here in Austin, it started with R. A. Saveda, who's a big Democrat.
[1:51:29.660 --> 1:51:34.660]  He's gotten way worse now. There'll be a serious, because I lived down there when I was in a divorce.
[1:51:34.660 --> 1:51:36.660]  I couldn't get a house. I had a rental place.
[1:51:36.660 --> 1:51:42.660]  And I mean, there were shootings and killings down there in the most elite part of downtown, Second Street, all that area.
[1:51:42.660 --> 1:51:47.660]  And you'd hear, oh, that happened in East Austin over on Chaconne and 12.
[1:51:47.660 --> 1:51:52.660]  No, it didn't. It happened on Second Colorado because I saw it.
[1:51:52.660 --> 1:51:56.660]  I heard the gunshots. So that's why this is so dangerous.
[1:51:56.660 --> 1:52:00.660]  So you've got a hip hop concert going on.
[1:52:00.660 --> 1:52:04.660]  Who do you think is going to be at that? A lot of people, but a lot of black folks.
[1:52:04.660 --> 1:52:10.660]  And here's the news. Mass shooting in Austin, Texas leaves 13 wounded.
[1:52:10.660 --> 1:52:17.660]  Now, can you imagine if it would have been a white person that shot into a crowd of mixed people?
[1:52:17.660 --> 1:52:21.660]  It didn't matter why he did it. They'd say it was white supremacist.
[1:52:21.660 --> 1:52:26.660]  Or if a cop randomly shot some thug, they'd say the cops are all bad.
[1:52:26.660 --> 1:52:32.660]  But instead, you get 13 people shot, a couple of them in the head, critical condition.
[1:52:32.660 --> 1:52:40.660]  And the police have a press conference and say, black male, dreadlocks, skinny, black shirt.
[1:52:40.660 --> 1:52:44.660]  That's a pretty good description. Like, who drove by and shot your white pickup truck?
[1:52:44.660 --> 1:52:50.660]  Black car, red car, green car, silver car. You need that.
[1:52:50.660 --> 1:52:55.660]  Only Fox carried that press conference. Every other channel didn't.
[1:52:55.660 --> 1:53:01.660]  But the Austin American statesman went one further.
[1:53:01.660 --> 1:53:10.660]  They said, editor's note, police have only released a vague description of the suspect shooter as of Saturday morning.
[1:53:10.660 --> 1:53:14.660]  The Austin American statesman is not including the description as it is too vague.
[1:53:14.660 --> 1:53:21.660]  They still have, by the way, at this time to be useful and identifying the shooter, and such publication could be harmful in perpetrating stereotypes.
[1:53:21.660 --> 1:53:25.660]  If more detailed information is released, we will update the reporting.
[1:53:25.660 --> 1:53:27.660]  They still have it. Last time I checked an hour ago.
[1:53:27.660 --> 1:53:32.660]  So why is that so important? Why is that so over the top?
[1:53:32.660 --> 1:53:43.660]  Because what color somebody is, what they're wearing, what they're driving, what they're dressed like, is evidentiary to stop them and find them.
[1:53:43.660 --> 1:53:49.660]  But the level is so insane that it doesn't matter if 13 are shot, two of them fight with their lives.
[1:53:49.660 --> 1:53:53.660]  By the way, it was Black folks, turns out that he was shooting at them.
[1:53:53.660 --> 1:53:56.660]  So it doesn't matter if Black people got shot and are almost dead.
[1:53:56.660 --> 1:53:59.660]  No, no, no, no, no. Killing people or almost killing them is important.
[1:53:59.660 --> 1:54:03.660]  The matter is not continuing a stereotype.
[1:54:03.660 --> 1:54:09.660]  Oh, really, of a gangster culture, a thug culture that doesn't value life, where people should be repudiated for that.
[1:54:09.660 --> 1:54:18.660]  So that's mind control, folks, to say a man with a penis is a woman and should be given a pap smear at a hospital or the nurse is fired.
[1:54:18.660 --> 1:54:24.660]  A nurse is like, you don't have a vagina. The hospital says, you'll do a pap smear, you'll be fired.
[1:54:24.660 --> 1:54:28.660]  That happens in America now. That happens in the UK now. That's a cult.
[1:54:28.660 --> 1:54:33.660]  And now, hey, we're going to put out the all-point bulletin. This is a white guy, whatever.
[1:54:33.660 --> 1:54:42.660]  Black guy, no, if it's a white guy or Hispanic, they'll do it, but they go, oh, the Black people, we love them so much, we're not going to even say it was a Black person did.
[1:54:42.660 --> 1:54:55.660]  Then the same media, the very same media, will say whiteness is a disease and white people are inherently bad.
[1:54:55.660 --> 1:55:03.660]  And Joe Biden gets up on TV and says, the number one thing killing people is white supremacy, and the white people are killing everybody.
[1:55:03.660 --> 1:55:10.660]  But isn't it kind of true? Because the globalists are mainly white. They're killing everybody, but it's not average white people out doing it.
[1:55:10.660 --> 1:55:16.660]  It's the globalists, the UN, and their whole program. That is crazy.
[1:55:16.660 --> 1:55:26.660]  I mean, if you've got somebody on the loose that just shot 13 people, two up in the head, almost dead, and you won't say what color they are because that's racist.
[1:55:26.660 --> 1:55:31.660]  That's crazy. That is mind control, and that means you'll do anything.
[1:55:31.660 --> 1:55:37.660]  And that's directed from on high by the editors and others that want to sell us on the idea of censorship and control.
[1:55:37.660 --> 1:55:42.660]  Next hour, I'm going to host part with Owen Shroyer. He's about to come in, banned out video in FullWars.com.
[1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:52.660]  Some of the great stations pick me up, pick Owen up. Hope you do. He's also on three to six p.m. weekdays with The Great War Room and, of course, American Journals.
[1:55:52.660 --> 1:55:57.660]  Also an excellent transmission. Harrison Smith, Weekly Mornings, 8 a.m. at infowars.com.
[1:55:57.660 --> 1:56:04.660]  And we're here fighting for America. We're here fighting for Justin. We're here fighting for freedom. We're here just going 110 percent, and we appreciate you.
[1:56:04.660 --> 1:56:10.660]  And we're having great victories despite all the censorship and attacks because of your word of mouth and your support.
[1:56:10.660 --> 1:56:15.660]  So keep it up. Coming up next hour, didn't hit this yet.
[1:56:15.660 --> 1:56:29.660]  Exclusive Defense Department admits major defector has been there for over a year, provide evidence that Chinese military orchestrated the creation of the COVID-19 and released the bio weapon.
[1:56:29.660 --> 1:56:35.660]  And, of course, they did. That is so huge. They do not want you to know this.
[1:56:35.660 --> 1:56:42.660]  Be a participant, not a spectator. Spread the word now with Sunday Live coming up. We're going to expose it.
[1:56:42.660 --> 1:56:48.660]  And Italy halts the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine in those under 60 and other news.
[1:56:48.660 --> 1:56:53.660]  These vaccines are getting banned everywhere, but they gaslight us and say we're crazy for not wanting them.
[1:56:53.660 --> 1:56:58.660]  And separately, we've got a new sale, still free shipping and double patriot points on these three items.

[1:57:46.660 --> 1:57:52.660]  though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[1:57:52.660 --> 1:57:58.660]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[1:57:58.660 --> 1:58:02.660]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:58:02.660 --> 1:58:08.660]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[1:58:08.660 --> 1:58:13.660]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:58:13.660 --> 1:58:19.660]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava,
