[00:00.000 --> 00:13.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.240 --> 00:22.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.000 --> 00:32.000]  you know the Saudi Arabian chain is complaining that people are criticizing
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.720]  their government their dictatorship the chops people's heads off for free speech
[00:37.720 --> 00:43.040]  on the internet he wants it stopped he wants it censored and I thought oh you
[00:43.040 --> 00:46.720]  know tough luck you've got your little backwards third world hellhole nation
[00:46.720 --> 00:50.440]  trying to make the biggest building in the world with one of the biggest
[00:50.440 --> 00:54.440]  disparities of wealth between the elite the general population and all these
[00:54.440 --> 00:59.800]  kidnapped European and American and other women we won't hear a word out of
[00:59.800 --> 01:02.800]  the control left because they're bought and paid for so the Republican
[01:02.800 --> 01:07.360]  leadership and I thought you know you're gonna be defeated and I thought not
[01:07.360 --> 01:11.520]  really Saudi Arabia controls the takeover of Islam with radical Sunni
[01:11.520 --> 01:15.520]  Wahhabist garbage and they are conquering Europe and they're conquering
[01:15.520 --> 01:19.920]  America I really sort of thinking man the Saudis you got a hand it to them
[01:19.920 --> 01:29.840]  fortune favors the bold and it certainly is true because I'm not even that smart
[01:29.840 --> 01:35.320]  but I'm aggressive I've got my facts together okay I'm smart but what I'm
[01:35.320 --> 01:38.600]  saying is I'm not the smartest guy around but I've got basic good instincts
[01:38.600 --> 01:43.040]  and a historical lens and I'm aggressive and so I've been very effective
[01:43.040 --> 01:49.160]  fighting the globalist and we've had a lot of big successes thanks to you the
[01:49.160 --> 01:53.880]  listeners and viewers and fellow patriots out there on the frontlines and I
[01:53.880 --> 01:59.400]  was just thinking about what would happen if other men decided it was manly to
[01:59.400 --> 02:03.760]  be politically involved and informed and aggressive and not chumps repeating
[02:03.760 --> 02:07.840]  what mainstream media says every day we would be in a much freer country a much
[02:07.840 --> 02:14.160]  freer world and the jokes that are the Saudi Arabian leadership wearing their
[02:14.160 --> 02:19.440]  women's nightgowns and their little loincloth their little beards throw up
[02:19.440 --> 02:24.600]  creeping around everyone bowing down to them and funding all these terrorists
[02:24.600 --> 02:28.440]  everywhere they wouldn't be crapping all over us incessantly we weren't such
[02:28.440 --> 02:35.520]  gibbering not need cowards to think about how we were manipulated and
[02:35.520 --> 02:41.560]  destroying Saudi Arabia's arch enemy Iraq blaming them for what Saudi Arabia was
[02:41.560 --> 02:46.480]  heavily involved in it's so sick and that's the MO of the New World Order
[02:46.480 --> 02:51.040]  bring in the radicals jihadis have them attack train stations facilities
[02:51.040 --> 02:57.280]  newspapers theaters kill hundreds and hundreds kill a bunch of police and then
[02:57.280 --> 03:00.840]  have the government stand up that brought them in and protected them that
[03:00.840 --> 03:05.440]  arrest people that criticize them and say we're gonna pass global government
[03:05.440 --> 03:11.160]  carbon taxes to prove to the radicals we're not scared we're gonna get all
[03:11.160 --> 03:18.440]  the power now because we did this to you aren't we great it is the suspension
[03:18.440 --> 03:24.600]  of reality and if people weren't in trances this wouldn't be happening you've
[03:24.600 --> 03:30.120]  got to be in a trance to sit here and to put up what's going on and it just it
[03:30.120 --> 03:35.080]  just hit me so hard that the answer to defeating these people is being
[03:35.080 --> 03:44.400]  aggressive is being forceful is being decisive and is just absolutely getting
[03:44.400 --> 03:49.880]  in their face and saying you are degenerate filthy criminal scourges you

[09:47.080 --> 09:53.560]  half days left in 2015 it is extremely long on the tooth and this year has a
[09:53.560 --> 09:59.080]  long white beard soon it will be a skeletal form it will fall to its knees
[09:59.080 --> 10:07.840]  imploding into dust forever as the next orbit around the Sun begins pretty
[10:07.840 --> 10:12.880]  magical place we live in it but we're taught to think the magic is Hollywood
[10:12.880 --> 10:18.800]  stars or Barack Obama on a red carpet that that's the secrets of the universe
[10:18.800 --> 10:23.280]  that that's the unattain him oh if you could just be in the White House at
[10:23.280 --> 10:28.720]  dinner with Obama or just be in Hollywood and have dinner with Brad Pitt it'd be so
[10:28.720 --> 10:43.200]  wonderful it'd be like a fantasy land a forbidden planet of a holic Elysium and
[10:43.200 --> 10:49.560]  the truth is this is Elysium we're on the planet we have the technologies we
[10:49.560 --> 10:52.880]  have the capability to go the next level and the globalists are trying to
[10:52.880 --> 10:57.880]  suppress that and stop that and steal the brain trust that is free humanity
[10:57.880 --> 11:03.760]  the ultimate heist is taking place against our DNA against our IQs against
[11:03.760 --> 11:11.680]  our very seed the power of procreation the final war is now beginning between
[11:11.680 --> 11:20.600]  the technocrats the servants of the eugenics agenda and what's left of free
[11:20.600 --> 11:32.280]  humanity the enemy's operation is so huge so vicious so evil so stealthy but
[11:32.280 --> 11:38.680]  also so overt that it boggles the mind as we are inserted into the beginnings of
[11:38.680 --> 11:47.240]  a false reality designed to make the act of resistance or free thought laughable
[11:47.240 --> 11:53.400]  impossible to quote Bertrand Russell the population will soon be so conditioned
[11:53.400 --> 12:00.480]  so drugged so brainwashed that a rebellion by the proletariat would be as
[12:00.480 --> 12:07.400]  unthinkable as sheep rebelling against the practice of eating mutton
[12:07.520 --> 12:11.040]  mutton is sheep
[12:11.040 --> 12:18.560]  a rebellion by the grassroots would be as unthinkable as sheep rebelling
[12:18.560 --> 12:28.240]  against being slaughtered sheep can't rebel their sheep they submit they fall
[12:28.600 --> 12:37.840]  will you fall they think you will fall as they perch on our chest smothering us
[12:37.840 --> 12:45.600]  strangling us in the night or will we become aware of the attack and surge
[12:45.600 --> 12:52.040]  with the power that God gave us to resist the enemy has sought to strangle us
[12:52.040 --> 12:57.640]  in our crib before we fully developed knowing we will tower above these
[12:57.640 --> 13:06.760]  disease twisted souls they believe that their day of doom is here for humanity
[13:06.760 --> 13:11.360]  but I tell the New World Order and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and the
[13:11.360 --> 13:18.680]  Saxe-Coburg gophers and the sods and all the rest of them your day of doom is
[13:18.680 --> 13:31.640]  coming and you know it and your devil cult will fall forever your next fall is
[13:31.640 --> 13:38.160]  forever you won't rise from the ashes this time
[13:38.160 --> 14:02.760]  I mean over some of the stacks we have here we have the criminal activities
[14:02.760 --> 14:07.440]  going on in France with the total takeover the world's energy system we
[14:07.440 --> 14:12.160]  have Chuck Norris striking back against GMO corn and salmon just to counter what
[14:12.160 --> 14:21.560]  real environmental crises are we have a whole new raft of people threatening to
[14:21.560 --> 14:27.680]  kill police and colleges shut down and hysteria all Soros White House run as
[14:27.680 --> 14:35.120]  usual universities dominated by left-wing hate mobs as professor it's now just
[14:35.120 --> 14:40.120]  become total tyranny just screaming we rule everything just the more socialists
[14:40.120 --> 14:45.520]  you grovel of them the more they attack it just they want total submission
[14:45.520 --> 14:51.320]  meanwhile the public is more concerned with the new Leonardo Caprio movie by the
[14:51.320 --> 14:56.360]  maker of Birdman which is a good film everyone's focusing on the bear raping
[14:56.360 --> 15:02.120]  Leonardo Caprio it actually rapes him in a sexy I kind of looked into that bears
[15:02.120 --> 15:08.360]  aren't known I've ever raped anybody dolphins will try to rape you they try
[15:08.360 --> 15:14.600]  to rape women male dolphins do but there's no known cases of bears trying
[15:14.600 --> 15:17.600]  to rape people but you see this is how we're all distracted the movie will
[15:17.600 --> 15:21.560]  probably make a billion dollars because everyone it's the big fox thinks it's
[15:21.560 --> 15:27.280]  his top release ever because a bear is raping someone see all this
[15:27.280 --> 15:32.320]  fantastical real stuff going on they're raping your genetics with GMO designed

[16:00.440 --> 16:05.960]  planet's future with potential World War three nuclear exchanges on the
[16:05.960 --> 16:12.440]  horizon they're raping the family they're breaking everything up but one man
[16:12.440 --> 16:17.560]  dies it's a tragedy 10,000 dies a statistic one imaginary bear rapes a
[16:17.560 --> 16:22.440]  man the whole planet being right doesn't matter because don't worry the
[16:22.440 --> 16:25.920]  people doing the main raping flying around in their jets and with huge
[16:25.920 --> 16:30.000]  carbon footprints and eating the finest caviar thousand dollar a plate dinners
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.640]  is in the news what they're having in Paris taxpayer paid for while they
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.480]  lecture us on less consumption as they distract from all the thousands of real
[16:39.480 --> 16:47.400]  environmental collapses and species die-offs in genetic mass mutation plagues
[16:47.400 --> 16:53.400]  and new microorganisms operating in the oceans causing huge die-offs none of that
[16:53.400 --> 17:00.680]  mega epic collapse matters because Al Gore's have it a little bit of five
[17:00.680 --> 17:04.760]  hundred dollar a spoon caviar that you're paying for right now because he's

[17:34.360 --> 17:41.120]  heaven of world government and Sunni ghettos and open sewage and women
[17:41.120 --> 17:45.120]  sexually mutilated with hoods on their heads
[17:45.120 --> 17:49.400]  meanwhile the Saudi King's complaining about the internet talking about Saudi
[17:49.400 --> 17:53.440]  Arabia yesterday and today he's complaining about people not being nice
[17:53.440 --> 17:58.640]  to the migrants when Saudi Arabia hasn't taken one of its finance Sunni
[17:58.640 --> 18:03.840]  invaders and I have the articles when we come back from break they admit that on
[18:03.840 --> 18:11.640]  average out of thousands of migrants there's not one Christian or one Shia it
[18:11.640 --> 18:19.840]  is a directed Sunni Wahhabist invasion to set up political bullying bases in
[18:19.840 --> 18:26.200]  every country to overthrow Christendom and the First Amendment and to establish
[18:26.200 --> 18:36.360]  Sharia de facto law I can't believe that a lot of these right-wing people that I
[18:36.360 --> 18:39.840]  heard the same the seven eight years ago right it's all true and and it's
[18:39.840 --> 18:44.960]  actually happening directed by the Pentagon and the central intelligence
[18:44.960 --> 18:52.320]  agency I mean you talk about gutting our nations and then when their little
[18:52.320 --> 18:58.200]  sweetie cakes blow stuff up they're going to set up armored vehicles and
[18:58.200 --> 19:01.520]  checkpoints secret interrogation centers and they're going to drag Tea Party
[19:01.520 --> 19:04.920]  people off the street and Nationalist off the street in Germany and France and
[19:04.920 --> 19:08.640]  they're going to put you in prison they're already doing it with a straight

[19:13.280 --> 19:17.480]  raped you don't criticize your freedoms being destroyed because the loving
[19:17.480 --> 19:22.080]  socialist government and the paramilitary police will follow their orders to drag
[19:22.080 --> 19:28.800]  you off into the night because they love you and your family so much they will

[19:35.280 --> 19:41.160]  great betrayal of the West the great collapse of the West and the response
[19:41.160 --> 19:46.600]  the Scorched destruction of the Middle East is coming in the next phase as the
[19:46.600 --> 19:51.960]  Illuminati plays Christendom off against Islam and on its ashes builds a one

[20:07.680 --> 20:11.680]  have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we
[20:11.680 --> 20:14.880]  typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the
[20:14.880 --> 20:19.160]  need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about staying

[20:35.800 --> 20:39.880]  times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers

[22:30.440 --> 22:35.600]  those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing to do with

[25:33.360 --> 25:39.080]  blow these criminal operations wide open a court ruled what six plus months ago

[25:42.960 --> 25:49.520]  anywhere in the world and he's still doing it that's called dictatorship and
[25:49.520 --> 25:55.400]  the Texas Attorney General that was suing him well he's been indicted see
[25:55.400 --> 26:01.520]  how they operate they're taking the gloves off people and their operators
[26:01.520 --> 26:05.360]  are criminally committed a lot of Republican leadership is scared and is
[26:05.360 --> 26:13.080]  saying I will salute you when you say jump I'm gonna ask how high you think
[26:13.080 --> 26:18.080]  Caloran to that's gonna get us out of this rolling over to these wolves means
[26:18.080 --> 26:22.520]  we're gonna get our guts torn out first they're gonna take their time eating us
[26:22.520 --> 26:27.800]  politically you know that's what wolves do I'll go back to the allegory of wolves
[26:27.800 --> 26:34.120]  I got it yesterday with animals that don't fight back you fight back wolves
[26:34.120 --> 26:37.440]  try to get into your throat and kill you quickly eat you but if you just sit
[26:37.440 --> 26:41.640]  there and beg and don't fight back they start on your rear end and they tear
[26:41.640 --> 26:45.920]  your guts out the rear end and eat you that direction forward and sheep and
[26:45.920 --> 26:51.640]  cows that are stuck in the mud sometimes take a day before they're dead they leave
[26:51.640 --> 26:55.760]  the heart beating right there to keep it fresh while they eat the meat right on
[26:55.760 --> 27:04.280]  up I'm not gonna sit there and lay over and show my belly to the wolves because
[27:04.280 --> 27:10.640]  I'm not a sheep I'm a sheepdog and I'm gonna get my teeth into their legs and
[27:10.640 --> 27:16.160]  their throat and I'm gonna crush them politically because I'm not a loser and
[27:16.160 --> 27:21.320]  I'm not a slave of this scum these parasitical criminal maggots that hate
[27:21.320 --> 27:27.600]  you and your family hate my family they are enemies they are declared enemies
[27:27.600 --> 27:37.280]  of humanity they are declared dark-side parasites literal servants of the devil
[27:37.280 --> 27:41.280]  you got me on that yet
[27:41.560 --> 27:47.720]  this is what's going on let me just get calm and cover notes they're just such
[27:47.720 --> 27:51.840]  enemies they hate us so much they hate the local governments they hate the
[27:51.840 --> 27:56.800]  local establishments prosperity is what freedom brings even corrupt people
[27:56.800 --> 28:01.880]  shouldn't want a total evil to come in this will destroy everyone except the
[28:01.880 --> 28:05.880]  enemy at the top and then they'll be screwed but it's their nature they can't
[28:05.880 --> 28:12.480]  help it do you understand that they are of their father and their lust are for
[28:12.480 --> 28:20.120]  death all those that hate me love death Christ said never true or words spoken
[28:20.120 --> 28:29.560]  all those that hate me love death I told people 19 years ago with George
[28:29.560 --> 28:40.360]  Woolley the local Catholic anti-abortion crusader that they were selling baby
[28:40.360 --> 28:44.680]  parts and keeping babies alive to harvest them and we had insiders and all
[28:44.680 --> 28:48.680]  the rest of it that was known then and people say you whacked out pro-lifers
[28:48.680 --> 28:52.040]  that's not going on now that it's all admitted and caught on tape it's like
[28:52.040 --> 28:57.360]  big deal see how they operate see how what they did folks that the baby
[28:57.360 --> 29:03.320]  harvesting is nothing the big banks run the child kidnapping they run the snuff
[29:03.320 --> 29:08.160]  films that's been in the Washington Post back in the 80s
[29:08.160 --> 29:12.400]  wait they grab three-year-olds out of their backyards and they torture them
[29:12.400 --> 29:18.680]  and then blow their heads off on video that's who runs this government now the
[29:18.680 --> 29:22.280]  average generals not involved their compartmentalized the average senators
[29:22.280 --> 29:28.600]  not involved it's the shadow government operating under COG at the top there's
[29:28.600 --> 29:33.880]  only a few thousand of these people but let me tell you they are what the art
[29:33.880 --> 29:38.640]  types of something like Count Dracula is they're not real vampires that blow up
[29:38.640 --> 29:42.920]  in the sunlight that's an allegory that light kills them truth kills them we've
[29:42.920 --> 29:46.720]  got to drag them out in the sun and high noon and watch them burn and they will
[29:46.720 --> 29:51.680]  but you've got to shine the light on them we're on the March the Empire's on
[29:51.680 --> 29:57.880]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:57.880 --> 30:04.080]  Hillary used the 9-11 attacks as justification for accepting huge
[30:04.080 --> 30:08.240]  donations from Wall Street fat cats for a second time this week in an interview
[30:08.240 --> 30:12.760]  with Charlie Rose Rose asked if Clinton believes she has suffered from the fact
[30:12.760 --> 30:18.120]  that some say she is too close to Wall Street Clinton shot back so yes do I know
[30:18.120 --> 30:23.260]  people and did I help rebuild after 9-11 yes I did it seems that Hillary's
[30:23.260 --> 30:27.520]  default position on the matter is simply to blurt out 9-11 in hopes that people
[30:27.520 --> 30:31.720]  will drop the subject the fact is that while Clinton preaches about standing
[30:31.720 --> 30:36.160]  for a lot of regulation on big banks and on the financial services sector and
[30:36.160 --> 30:40.880]  drones on about wealth inequality she is raking it in from wealthy Wall Street
[30:40.880 --> 30:45.800]  donors Hillary has received sizable donations from officials representing
[30:45.800 --> 30:51.240]  but not limited to Morgan Stanley city group Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase

[34:31.000 --> 34:37.360]  again I'm directing the TV show right now slash radio show in live time and it
[34:37.360 --> 34:44.640]  does show as a metric that people are waking up that people are getting
[34:44.640 --> 34:51.360]  involved that people are aware that we are in a crisis as a civilization and
[34:51.360 --> 34:59.480]  that is very good news mainstream media is not going to ever tell you that
[34:59.480 --> 35:03.320]  patriots have power or that there are people that want liberty and freedom and
[35:03.320 --> 35:10.400]  free market systems and rule of law from Latin America to Africa to Asia to
[35:10.400 --> 35:16.000]  Europe they're there to make you feel like you're bad you're evil because you
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.160]  stand up for freedom but I'm here to tell you just info wars.com and what I do
[35:21.160 --> 35:25.520]  as radical as it sounds and as radical as I put things because I'm not going to
[35:25.520 --> 35:29.520]  miss words I'm gonna tell you what I really thinks going on I'm gonna jump
[35:29.520 --> 35:33.800]  up and down because I'm here to tell you the ship sinking we've got to get out
[35:33.800 --> 35:38.480]  of this trance we've got to have cold water thrown on us to wake up and get
[35:38.480 --> 35:44.960]  out of our collective beds because the house is on fire and it's effective and
[35:44.960 --> 35:49.600]  that's why Donald Trump whether you love him or hate him or in between is so
[35:49.600 --> 35:52.880]  effective because he doesn't apologize he doesn't back off the more
[35:52.880 --> 35:56.760]  controversies he's in the more they spend things the more they attack him the
[35:56.760 --> 36:02.960]  more he becomes popular because people don't trust the dinosaur media they
[36:02.960 --> 36:08.320]  don't trust the Decepticon media they don't trust the enemy media anymore and
[36:08.320 --> 36:12.680]  so you think about the fact that my broadcast is getting picked up by all
[36:12.680 --> 36:16.720]  these new stations every month it's growing by leaps and bounds on every
[36:16.720 --> 36:23.160]  metric on every format in the face of almost all other media even if it's been
[36:23.160 --> 36:28.200]  popular even if it's been patriot even it's been libertarian stagnating or
[36:28.200 --> 36:32.960]  getting smaller because there's so much more competition out there so info wars
[36:32.960 --> 36:37.400]  is pretty much about as radical as it gets and it's the fastest growing but
[36:37.400 --> 36:42.200]  I'm not radical a bunch of world leaders meeting eating thousand dollar a plate
[36:42.200 --> 36:49.120]  meals on red carpets and jumbo jets with surveillance blimps over Paris
[36:50.400 --> 36:56.720]  surveilling everyone illegally but letting the jihadis in calling for
[36:56.720 --> 37:01.680]  world government and world taxes selectively to shut down certain nations
[37:01.680 --> 37:09.800]  and companies is outrageous it's it's run down the street naked screaming now
[37:09.800 --> 37:13.040]  if I ran down the street naked screaming it would be somewhat discrediting but I
[37:13.040 --> 37:17.200]  got to tell you I think in the long run it would be seen as probably the right
[37:17.200 --> 37:21.640]  thing to do because that's how crazy stuff's gotten and we've got to get
[37:21.640 --> 37:25.160]  people out of their comfort zones and realize stuffs out of control and I'm
[37:25.160 --> 37:28.560]  not advocating running down the street naked I mean that is a figurative arc
[37:28.560 --> 37:33.440]  type run down the street with my hair on fire like black beard you know he did
[37:33.440 --> 37:36.160]  that to get attention and scare people when he boarded their boats he put a
[37:36.160 --> 37:39.360]  bunch of matches and candles in his beard in his hair and lying himself on
[37:39.360 --> 37:44.960]  fire so they'd see a guy with his teeth bared his eyes glaring with a knife in

[38:54.520 --> 38:59.920]  skull I've heard of that marble comics everything you basically see in most
[38:59.920 --> 39:09.560]  fiction is a mirror of what's already going on as they throw it in your face a
[39:09.560 --> 39:16.080]  big blood dripping skull on a black background with a gold crown on its head

[39:20.600 --> 39:27.160]  with fiery eyes and a crown Robert De Niro made the Good Shepherd about it when
[39:27.160 --> 39:33.760]  they dress up like their god the devil in a black shroud with a skull mask and
[39:33.760 --> 39:39.320]  a gold crown in fact people don't believe me skull and bones ritual the Good
[39:39.320 --> 39:42.880]  Shepherd I know it's online you can actually show them bathing in feces
[39:42.880 --> 39:48.520]  our Christian leaders conservative leaders mainly and worshiping the devil
[39:48.520 --> 39:56.840]  and and I only bring this up to you so that you can understand who these people
[39:56.840 --> 40:08.440]  are and so that you can understand that this isn't a game and of course who is
[40:08.440 --> 40:18.480]  in the Good Shepherd met Damon I don't want one you've been very helpful for me
[40:18.480 --> 40:22.760]  without further ado let me stop ranting and get to the news here ahead of
[40:22.760 --> 40:25.960]  multiple guests that are going to be joining us today first off this is not
[40:25.960 --> 40:31.560]  a gimmick it'd be okay but was a gimmick because it funds the operation we
[40:31.560 --> 40:35.760]  really gauge things and if we do free shipping but don't sell a bunch of
[40:35.760 --> 40:40.120]  products we lose money actually it's an actuary have to break down the numbers
[40:40.120 --> 40:44.720]  you have to look at it if we do too big of sales but they're not huge then we
[40:44.720 --> 40:47.400]  don't make enough money to buy more product or fund the operation and it's
[40:47.400 --> 40:52.560]  a failure and I've had some sales over the years that were not really failures
[40:52.560 --> 40:58.520]  but were duds didn't really get us in the black very much but I've learned just
[40:58.520 --> 41:04.120]  the bigger the sales the better the products the more free shipping the more
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.720]  we sell by a huge amount and then I'm sitting here looking from can I give
[41:08.720 --> 41:12.760]  people a Christmas bonus do I have to let somebody go this is a month ago
[41:12.760 --> 41:17.080]  expensive operation to oh my gosh I'm gonna hire a couple reporters and get
[41:17.080 --> 41:22.360]  some more writers and give people Christmas bonuses and you know I'm
[41:22.360 --> 41:26.280]  personally gonna give some turkeys to you know the Salvation Army that's the
[41:26.280 --> 41:30.080]  word we've gotten with you with his black Friday sale buying so much product
[41:30.080 --> 41:34.440]  it's been hugely successful now the profits aren't as big per sale obviously
[41:34.440 --> 41:38.520]  because the these sales are so huge in fact where's my battery charger thing it
[41:38.520 --> 41:42.760]  was in here I guess folks ran off with that can I have the and I have the
[41:42.760 --> 41:49.480]  product in here to show folks we are selling out of basically everything at

[48:25.200 --> 48:28.240]  of everything that's happening that'll start tomorrow and we've got something
[48:28.240 --> 48:33.360]  just as big as that and this is about as big as it gets tomorrow as well but I
[48:33.360 --> 48:37.880]  don't like to count my chickens before they're hatched I don't count a fish
[48:37.880 --> 48:43.160]  until it's in the boat gaffed it in the freezer really until I'm frying it a
[48:43.160 --> 48:47.800]  couple hours later on shore but till it's in my guts but we are that's what
[48:47.800 --> 48:51.640]  winnings all about taking action and we're doing it let me tell you a fortune
[48:51.640 --> 48:58.680]  favors the bold providence favors the committed the bold the crazed and I am
[48:58.680 --> 49:03.360]  crazed I am crazed in the enemy's face I'm in a fight I know I'm in danger I
[49:03.360 --> 49:07.200]  know I've committed my name my treasure my family to the fight and you know what
[49:07.200 --> 49:12.560]  it feels good because now I can just begin to join my four bears that died in
[49:12.560 --> 49:18.760]  the Texas Revolution I can join my four bears that died in 1776 in the next six
[49:18.760 --> 49:23.800]  years I can join those that came across on the Mayflower I can join those daring
[49:23.800 --> 49:31.040]  crusaders I can just begin to approach the level they're at and it's not through
[49:31.040 --> 49:34.720]  arrogance it's not through a power trip I want to do that it's I want to live I
[49:34.720 --> 49:41.840]  want to be bold I want to be creative I want to be strong I want to live up to
[49:41.840 --> 49:49.600]  the ideals that our founders had and their belief in Christ and it takes
[49:49.600 --> 49:54.400]  aggressive men to defeat the new world order they've taken that from us I mean
[49:54.400 --> 49:58.280]  you know how aggressive our four bears were they'd be running around killing
[49:58.280 --> 50:01.920]  people right now for what's going on but we're in a new modern war where they
[50:01.920 --> 50:06.080]  want that we're winning the info war and we're killing their fake ideas we're
[50:06.080 --> 50:10.560]  killing their lives we are stabbing them and bayonetting them and foaming at the
[50:10.560 --> 50:17.760]  mouth they want to fight they've got one they want to go head-to-head I'm
[50:17.760 --> 50:21.600]  committed I'm going all the way and nothing feels more committed nothing
[50:21.600 --> 50:29.360]  feels better than not being a coward me and strong all they can take is your
[50:29.360 --> 50:35.040]  honor all they can take your soul and they take your soul they take everything
[50:35.040 --> 50:40.960]  so why would you bow to the enemy through fear they can take nothing from us
[50:40.960 --> 50:45.720]  why would we want to give that to them there's not even a debate about this
[50:45.720 --> 50:50.640]  alright I'm done preaching I apologize we're gonna come back straight ahead and

[54:20.800 --> 54:27.800]  lyrics in Paris. I haven't had him on in years but I'll get him back on. I watch, see, and call him all suckers.
[54:27.800 --> 54:36.800]  Let's go ahead and crank it up for a moment. I like this lady's voice too.
[54:36.800 --> 54:44.800]  I am wound up for such an epic time when the war with Russia they could lead to World War 4. All the craziness.
[54:44.800 --> 54:51.800]  From the government like every day I watch it and listen and call them all suckers. They wanted me about Osama or whatever.
[54:51.800 --> 54:56.800]  Picture me buying this scam I said never. You in tune to a hard truth.
[54:56.800 --> 55:00.800]  I'm right blaming Iraq for 9-11. I saw the Arabian Lash.
[55:00.800 --> 55:04.800]  Let's go ahead and get into the news.
[55:04.800 --> 55:15.800]  U.S. carbon emissions down 10% in past decade. You know what that means? 10% of our energy has been cut off.
[55:15.800 --> 55:26.800]  As our population went up 34 million people in the last 10 years. It's down 10.2%.
[55:26.800 --> 55:33.800]  Now they actually cut off more than a third of our coal power but they allow General Electric to build hundreds of new
[55:33.800 --> 55:37.800]  plants while shutting off over a thousand others.
[55:37.800 --> 55:44.800]  I mean you talk about a military op. That's it. Shut down everybody else then everybody's going to buy it from you for increased prices.
[55:44.800 --> 55:50.800]  But there's still less power. But they want you to be prosperous poor people.
[55:50.800 --> 55:55.800]  Obama loves you. How you like that black unemployment doubling?
[55:55.800 --> 56:00.800]  Doesn't matter though. He had George Soros tell you it's the cops fault so just shoot one of them in the back of the head.
[56:00.800 --> 56:07.800]  They'll fix everything according to them. No that'll just cause a civil war and the police state to come in which they'll use to crack down on everybody.
[56:07.800 --> 56:16.800]  Just like they let in the radical jihadis in Europe and now they're taking the conservative groups' rights and arresting front runners in presidential elections like Marie Le Pen.
[56:16.800 --> 56:19.800]  That's hardcore.
[56:19.800 --> 56:28.800]  Wow that's incredible. It's so over the top. The suspension of logic. The outrageousness of it. The insolence.
[56:28.800 --> 56:37.800]  U.S. carbon emissions down 10% in past decade right bar according to EPA. Carbon emissions in U.S. have fallen 10.2%.
[56:37.800 --> 56:45.800]  By the way China's are up over 30% since then they have to make zero cuts. Oh I wonder where the jobs will go if their power is about what?
[56:45.800 --> 56:56.800]  Last time I checked less than 20% the cost of ours. Oh where would you build something that had power that in many cases is 20, 30, 40% of the cost of a factory.
[56:56.800 --> 57:06.800]  You can't compete with that. No way. And then you add the slave labor and all the rest of it and the internal tariffs of the yawn being kept undervalued.
[57:06.800 --> 57:12.800]  But that's okay. People don't need to know economics do they?
[57:12.800 --> 57:16.800]  Our government loves this is why they did that.
[57:16.800 --> 57:22.800]  Obama trip to the UN Global Warming Summit amid CO2.
[57:22.800 --> 57:33.800]  More CO2 than driving 72 cars for a year. Everyone always points out that that's you know terrible hypocrisy. They want the hypocrisy.
[57:33.800 --> 57:42.800]  He walks off jumbo jets and gives a speech on the tarmac saying you can't have cars and air conditioners. That's the whole point.
[57:42.800 --> 57:45.800]  Here's another one. Look at this photo.
[57:45.800 --> 57:52.800]  Warmers dine on fancy cuisine as they plot global redistribution.
[57:52.800 --> 58:00.800]  Obama dined at the Hoot Cuisine that's super fancy with global leaders at the Global Warming Summit.
[58:00.800 --> 58:11.800]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, now we learn typical Christian conservative who reportedly had sex crime records, was a huge liberal, identified as a woman, was a cross dresser.
[58:11.800 --> 58:17.800]  Killer Robert Lewis Deere was into spanking bondage and smoking pot.
[58:17.800 --> 58:22.800]  Probably a wind up toy on amnesics. He fits the bill of it being staged.
[58:22.800 --> 58:27.800]  Then they just had their assassins wait, kill a few cops, get out the back door, have him drugged up, not knowing who he is.
[58:27.800 --> 58:29.800]  That's how they run these ops, sir hand, sir hand you name it.
[58:29.800 --> 58:35.800]  Police, I mean if you're not totally controlled, got to look into this being a setup. I smell it. I think it is. Probably is. We'll be back.
[58:35.800 --> 58:42.800]  Seriously, my guts, never wrong.
[59:05.800 --> 59:15.800]  Deep Cleanse is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser with concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, folvic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others.
[59:15.800 --> 59:25.800]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back. Instead of buying five, six or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades old scientific research to put together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[59:25.800 --> 59:39.800]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary SpyJurex herbal processing technique. We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.

[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:21.800]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:29.800]  It's Obama and the UN's theme song, Freakin' the Law.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:41.800]  There's a video, liberals propose bringing migrants into the U.S. to house them, but then when they're asked, will you house some, they say no. You see, it's about making you pay.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:56.800]  Breaking the law. And that's what they're doing is they are breaking the law, opening our borders up and Saudi Arabia, I have it here on the stack, will not take one, this is now three months, four months running, one refugee.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:08.800]  They have trillions of dollars, over 10,000 princes paid millions or billions a year depending on who they are, in the line of ascension to the toilet bowl that is the house of son.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:16.800]  It's like a ramp up to a giant toilet and then they ascend and then they jump into it once they get up there to the top.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:28.800]  Obama's trip to the UN Global Warming Summit emits more than 72 cars driving for a year. They're eating caviar meals at taxpayer expenses.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:34.800]  Meanwhile, why do Goldman Sachs bankers keep landing top slots at the Federal Reserve?
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:42.800]  Every major central bank of the world is run by a Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan, former president or CEO or chairman. That's on record.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:52.800]  Now appoint leaders of Spain and of Greece and of Italy and of Portugal and who are former directors of Goldman Sachs.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:02:02.800]  Goldman Sachs sits at the top of the pyramid, at the top of the toilet. So that's out of the nation.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:12.800]  I mean, it's just, who do you think gives money to the gun control groups? Who do you think gives money to teach five year olds how to be transgender?
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:21.800]  Who do you think wants to, they are the literal embodiment of enemies.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:30.800]  Who do you think is the main funders of making you have a 200 and something square foot house by law that you pay more property taxes on than a mansion?
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:41.800]  Who do you think then owns those filthy buildings, Goldman Sachs or Wells Fargo in Berkshire Hethaway?
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:51.800]  Because when they're not flying jumbo jets full of crack or prisoners to black sites, they're owning the house you rent.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:03:01.800]  They're owning the condo you rent, laughing at you and lobbying to get property taxes raised so high on private owners that you can't afford it because there's a rent anyways,
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.800]  which you then pay to have your kids brainwashed at a government training center.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:15.800]  And Goldman Sachs isn't that smart. We're chumps and we're stupid. It's why we live under the Goldman Sachs thumb.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:21.800]  Can we get under my thumb coming back in the next segment? I want to dedicate it to Goldman Sachs.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:34.800]  Under my thumb, the girl who once had me down under my thumb.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:39.800]  You like being a slave? Well, I don't. I know most of you don't either.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:46.800]  Major powers pledge 20 billion for green energy research. That means to their select friends and families like Harry Reid's sons,
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.800]  who've gotten hundreds of millions themselves.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:55.800]  Or, you know, Joe Biden's son over in Ukraine gets to head up the gas company that just grabbed all the Russian gas.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:02.800]  Just, oh, here's my 20-something-year-old son. Here you go. Run the Russian gas. How's that sound, son?
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:09.800]  Oh, but they're pledging to save us and for us to pay them carbon taxes. Aren't they so sweet?
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:14.800]  Talk about insider trading. You talk about scams. You talk about bid rigging. You talk about conflict of interest.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:19.800]  Baby, this is it. But don't worry.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:24.800]  The Texas Attorney General at a dinner party reportedly told people what he thought a good investment was
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:30.800]  and didn't tell them that he'd formerly worked for the company but hadn't been working with him for a year and a half.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.800]  And so those good friends at dinner got that report in so he's been indicted.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.800]  And don't worry. She sold a couple of hundred thousand dollars of stock.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:44.800]  Martha Stewart went to prison. She didn't do the insider trading. They said she lied. Of course she didn't.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:48.800]  Don't worry. Dinesh Yassouza went to jail for nine months for, you know, being involved in a campaign.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:56.800]  But don't worry. Hillary could take money from dictators. Billions of it at her foundation for selling him illegal weapons and arming Al Qaeda.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.800]  That's okay. Okay?
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:07.800]  The latest victims of social justice warrior political correctness brainwashing is a kindergarten class in Captain Johnston Blakely Elementary School in Washington State.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:14.800]  Teacher Karen Keller is on a quest to indoctrinate her class with the mindlessness of gender equality by banning boys from using Legos.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.800]  That's right. She told the Bainbridge Island Review,
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.800]  I always tell the boys you're going to have a turn and I'm like, yeah, when hell freezes over in my head,
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.800]  I tell them you'll have a turn because I don't want them to feel bad.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:30.800]  She started this exercise in futility because boys were flocking to the colorful blocks during their free choice playtime.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:36.800]  While girls tended to play with dolls or crayons, she tried using pink and purple Legos to attract the girl's students,
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.800]  but she found that ineffective. So that led to an outright ban for boys.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:46.800]  Keller defends her actions by saying they're fair because she's giving different students the tools they need to succeed.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.800]  Wonder why there's such a control freak attitude in Bainbridge Island?
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:53.800]  We'll take a short ferry ride to Seattle where officials want to end the term brown bag.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.800]  There's definitely something in the water or in the coffee in Washington state.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:24.800]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:33.800]  Use since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems,

[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:32.800]  The difference in the glow she wears down to me, the change has come, she's on the path.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:39.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, hour number two, kicking off from deep in the heart of Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:56.800]  It's time to get out from under the globalist thumb, and the change is coming, then the change will come.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:04.800]  I just saw Diane Feinstein looking like a skexie on C-Span in the break room.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:12.800]  She looked like an old vulture with her head sticking out, an old buzzard feeding on, I don't know, aborted babies or something.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:19.800]  And her head was sticking out with this fuzzy white fur coat around her with black beside that.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:32.800]  And she looked like a classical vulture from the Middle East, the ones you see in cartoons.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:38.800]  In fact, can we DVR that because I want to put her side by side with a buzzard or a vulture.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:50.800]  And I don't normally make comments about how somebody looks, but when the book cover fits, why not?
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:56.800]  I mean, this is a parasite who wants your guns but has bodyguards, made hundreds of millions off the government and inside deals,
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:03.800]  perched up there on C-Span, griping and complaining about how people are mean to gays.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.800]  Mean to gays? Total distraction.
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:12.800]  I never let my children watch mainstream television, very rarely.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.800]  And last night, it was about nine o'clock, I let them stay up a little bit later after dinner, and I said,
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.800]  okay, let's watch some mainstream television and analyze it.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.800]  So I'm sitting there on the couch, and I put the WWE on.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:33.800]  And I'm watching about 20 minutes of it, and there's more ads than there is content.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:38.800]  And the whole thing was homoerotic.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:45.800]  It was women all over each other, and then it was men, and it was saying, this guy likes this guy with hearts.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:50.800]  And my seven-year-old looks over me right as I'm thinking, no, this is all gay propaganda.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:56.800]  My seven-year-old daughter looks over and she goes, dad, is this show about people that are gay?
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:03.800]  Because that's just what a seven-year-old who's somewhat sheltered gets out in the culture that's so immersed in this assault.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:09.800]  And I'm not bashing homosexuals, I'm tired of being told what words to use.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.800]  You know, I'm a heterosexual, well, I can call you a homosexual, it's just a scientific term.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:20.800]  Like calling the Himalayas the Himalayas or the Rockies the Rockies, don't use the word the Rockies, it's hateful.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.800]  I mean, this is the crazy town of political correctness.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:39.800]  But this is the assault that we're under, where the tolerant West is told, you can't say the word father or mother or boy or girl or he or she in school handouts or in articles or in government forms.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:47.800]  But we're going to accept a bunch of Sunni Wahhabist into the West who are running around demanding we adopt Sharia law.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.800]  And I used to hear this ago, that's not happening.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:56.800]  Guess what, from Paris to London to Dearborn, Michigan, it is.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.800]  And it's all about divide and conquer.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:11.800]  And I got articles here, I'm going to go over with Gerald Salente, where they admit out of this many thousand refugees brought into the United States just the last few weeks, not one was a Christian.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:16.800]  And they're the groups being attacked and actually killed by the hundreds of thousands in Syria.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:23.800]  And the Shiites, the minority Muslims are being tracked down and killed, the Alawites and others.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:34.800]  But they're really just like Suftis, they're mystics that I wouldn't even call them Muslims, they're what was before that.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.800]  It's crazy.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:45.800]  And notice they're not Shiite, they're not Christian, they're not the actual groups getting killed, they're who our government's allied with, who they brought into Syria to overthrow the nation.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:56.800]  And now, I want to talk about this first with Gerald Salente, how many times has the trends forecaster here, needs no introduction, said when the economy implodes they take you to war.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.800]  And when people lose everything, they lose it.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.800]  We've got his latest trends journal right here.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:10.800]  He has written, Colonel Craig Roberts has been on the show, Paul Craig Roberts who writes for him has made the same point.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:16.800]  Colonel Shaffer has made the same point, countless others have said it, Pat Buchanan wrote about it this week.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.800]  This could start the next World War.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:25.800]  Russia prepares for dogfights with NATO over Syria, moving in their most high-tech fighters.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.800]  S-400 missiles were moved in last week.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:33.800]  World War III draws closer as Russia accuses Turkey of being secret allies with ISIS.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:37.800]  Sweden says no apartments, no jobs, no shopping.
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:40.800]  You know, you have to make way for the migrants.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.800]  Woman right by migrants asks police not to prosecute because it's politically correct.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.800]  Russia has more proof ISIS oil routed through Turkey.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.800]  Erdogan says they'll resign if true.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.800]  It's on record that's where they sell it.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.800]  The U.S. has all the satellite images.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:14:01.800]  Saudi Arabia complains about hostility towards refugees while taking in zero when they ran the whole attack on Syria.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:04.800]  This is the information.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.800]  Migrants attack police at Macedonia, puts up fence along Greek border.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.800]  They're not migrants.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:17.800]  They're military-age men invading who failed to take over Syria and now aren't going back into Iraq,
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.800]  aren't going back into other countries where they also invaded.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.800]  They're coming through Turkey where the open door by the West is saying, come in.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:27.800]  You got rocket launchers, come on.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:32.800]  And thousands in big hordes just marching in.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.800]  But Lindsey Graham says he wants U.S. troops to come back into Iraq and Syria
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:42.800]  when he and McCain have been backing the actual Sunnis that started the whole thing.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.800]  And in Europe, they're arresting people like Marie Le Pen,
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:50.800]  who says that there's a radical Islamic invasion for her speech.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.800]  They've suspended free speech in France and Germany.
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.800]  And here in America, 15 people last month were charged with terrorism
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:03.800]  for having rebel flags at a park and offending people.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:10.800]  I mean, this is how far we've gone into total tyranny.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:14.800]  Oh, Marie Le Pen's front-runner in presidential election polls.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.800]  Oh, her party just won the regional elections all over the country.
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:21.800]  We'll just arrest you.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:24.800]  And then say we're going to pass global government carbon taxes
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:31.800]  and the TPP basically ratify it globally to stand up against the terrorist
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.800]  when it's the world leaders that brought in the terrorist.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.800]  Gerald Salente, so much to cover, but I don't think I've seen a time in the last 30 years
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:45.800]  this geopolitically dangerous and it's so disgusting to see Russia, in my view,
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.800]  on the right moral side as much as I don't want to see them bombing a country.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:52.800]  They are bombing the people that are actually starting the war.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.800]  Disagree? Agree? Where do you see this going?
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.800]  What are the trends? TrendsResearch.com.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:05.800]  Well, on Russia, they were invited into Syria by the sovereign government,
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.800]  like Assad or not.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:12.800]  You know, they had an election, by the way, in June of 2014.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.800]  And there were some 50 nations that oversaw the election
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:20.800]  and said it was a legitimate election and Assad won.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.800]  So Russia was invited into a sovereign nation
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:29.800]  by the sovereign leader of that nation,
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:34.800]  where the United States, the Arabs who you were talking about,
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.800]  the beheaders in chief, the Saudis,
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.800]  where they had 50 people lined up for beheading this coming week.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.800]  They've already done over 200.
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:48.800]  They've attacked and supported the so-called moderate rebels,
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:52.800]  the Islamist jihadists, that are overthrowing the Assad government,
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.800]  as you pointed out, an Alawite government,
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.800]  that made it possible for Christians and Sunnis and Shias to live together,
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.800]  like him or not, consider how brutal he is, whatever it may be.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:06.800]  That's the fact.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.800]  But all these other nations now, France in there,
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:13.800]  the UK is voting to start bombs away.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.800]  The Germans are sending troops into Syria.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:23.800]  One country after another invading a sovereign nation
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.800]  against international law.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.800]  And here in what used to be called the United States,
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.800]  where we've lost our rights,
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.800]  we, our commander in chief, decides we're going to bomb Syria
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.800]  and Congress refuses to vote on it.
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:47.800]  And according to what used to be called the Constitution,
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:52.800]  the United States is not supposed to invade another country,
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.800]  attack another country, go to war with another country,
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.800]  unless Congress votes on it.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.800]  And they won't even vote on the War Powers Act
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.800]  to give the commander the right to go in there.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:08.800]  So in talking about all this, let's begin with,
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.800]  and as you pointed out, all this stuff about, you know,
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.800]  these diversion things, you know, about gay rights,
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.800]  about whatever is something may be about, you know,
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.800]  not look what happened in Halloween, you know,
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.800]  wearing the proper Halloween costumes,
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.800]  all these diversionary tactics,
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.800]  as no one's talking about the mass murder
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.800]  committed by the mass murderers,
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.800]  which the United States is right up at the top over there
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.800]  because of, you know, the other con man, the George W. Bush
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:48.800]  and Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice and Rumsfeld
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:52.800]  and Wilfowits that sent us to war, Cheney.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:53.800]  I forgot, Cheney.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.800]  And Colin Powell didn't get in any trouble for all the BS
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.800]  that came out of Colin Powell.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.800]  It's just incredible to see them distract us
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.800]  with transgender bathrooms for five-year-olds
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.800]  and everyone complaining about how the gays
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.800]  don't have enough freedom all day,
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.800]  while our governments engage in mass murder war crimes
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.800]  with al-Qaeda blowing up every church they get their hands on
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.800]  and blocking major routes of the Mediterranean
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.800]  acts of war against Russian ships.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.800]  This is just over the top, how dangerous it is.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.800]  Yes, and again, when we look at the facts,
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.800]  the numbers coming out over a million people
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.800]  have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan,
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.800]  Libya and Syria, thanks to the United States
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.800]  and its coalition of the killing.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.800]  You know, Alex, I think they should put together
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:51.800]  maybe a commission to study how radicals come about
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.800]  after their entire nations are destroyed,
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.800]  the people they love are killed,
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.800]  they have no future in front of them.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.800]  I wonder why they become radicalized.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.800]  I can't figure it out.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.800]  And none of this is being talked about
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.800]  when they talk about the refugee crisis.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.800]  Yeah, what happened in Syria?
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:18.800]  Over four million families, and by the way,
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:22.800]  two of my friends that are doctors, Christians,
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:25.800]  that had to leave over two years ago,
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.800]  that are now up in Canada,
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.800]  that were living a wonderful life,
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.800]  because Hillary came out and said,
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.800]  Assad has to go.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.800]  Obama, Assad has to go.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.800]  Kerry, Assad has to go.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.800]  Who are these people?
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:44.800]  I'll tell you who they are.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:47.800]  They're traitors to this country.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.800]  Anybody that goes into a foreign nation,
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.800]  unwelcome by those people,
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:57.800]  and they are not a threat to the United States,
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:01.800]  is a traitor to everything this country's been founded upon.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.800]  You're right, and now it's created
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.800]  giant threats to this nation,
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.800]  and after they destabilize the Middle East
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.800]  in this 20-year program,
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.800]  they then radicalize and fund
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:13.800]  the most vicious jihadis
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.800]  quarterbacked by Saudi Arabia,
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.800]  destabilize the whole world,
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.800]  then they pose as saviors yet again.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.800]  What is their end game?
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:25.800]  Sick people have no end game.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.800]  Why can't anyone call a spade a spade?
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.800]  A megalomaniac, a megalomaniac,
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.800]  a Hitler, a Hitler, a Mussolini, a Mussolini,
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.800]  a Bush, Obama, a Cheney, psychopaths.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:43.800]  Hillary Clinton, could you get a better psychopath than her?
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:46.800]  Look at that clip on CBS,
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.800]  when she was asked,
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:51.800]  how did she feel when they found out
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.800]  Momar Gaddafi was dead?
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.800]  And she goes on to that rant,
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.800]  we came, we saw.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.800]  He died.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.800]  He died.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.800]  They should have came out with a straight jacket
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.800]  and took her away.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.800]  Absolutely, that's what mentally ill people do.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.800]  I mean, I'll tell you, like commandos,
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.800]  military people that have to kill folks,
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.800]  if any of them acted like that after they killed people,
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.800]  they would be thrown out of their unit.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.800]  There's mentally ill sickness,
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.800]  and that's when you have to actually kill folks yourself.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.800]  You don't like doing it.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:24.800]  Here's Gaddafi, worked with the West for eight years,
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:27.800]  let us in, gave up his weapons, invested,
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.800]  met with Obama, believed he was their friend,
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.800]  had dinner with him in Sarkozy,
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.800]  and they literally set him up and killed him
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.800]  and put Al Qaeda in charge.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.800]  And then took the weapons from Benghazi,
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.800]  killed Ambassador Stevens to cover it up
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.800]  and ship the missiles into Syria,
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.800]  which they're now using to shoot down
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.800]  airliners and blow stuff up.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.800]  It is incredible.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.800]  I know, and you look at Libya,
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:53.800]  it was the richest country in Africa.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.800]  The people had the best lives.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.800]  Again, it's not my business
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.800]  how some other country, the other person,
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.800]  runs their country,
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.800]  but as they're yelling about this,
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.800]  Samantha Powers, Susan Rice,
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.800]  and Hillary Clinton and Obama,
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.800]  that Gaddafi has to go,
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.800]  in the meantime,
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.800]  slaughtering people over there in Yemen.
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.800]  We wrote about it in the Trends Journal.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.800]  The day Obama came out
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:21.800]  and said the terrible things that Gaddafi was doing,
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.800]  the guy that was in charge of Yemen,
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.800]  Salah, had just slaughtered
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.800]  about 50 people demonstrating.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.800]  That didn't make the news,
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.800]  just as it's not making the news now, Alex,
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.800]  as the Saudis,
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.800]  as Hillary
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.800]  and Obama
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.800]  and McCain
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.800]  and little Lindsey Graham
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.800]  call our allies
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.800]  the beheaders-in-chief
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.800]  are slaughtering Yemenis
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.800]  for doing nothing.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.800]  Over 7,000 of them.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.800]  And they're now executing people for poetry.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.800]  And again, they're bombing Yemen.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.800]  It's not making the news,
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.800]  and then you saw the deal that came out
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.800]  two weeks ago.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.800]  The United States sold Saudi Arabia
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.800]  $2 billion worth of, quote,
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.800]  smart bombs.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.800]  And who's in charge
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.800]  of the mass murder going on in Yemen?
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.800]  That's not making the news.
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.800]  It's Yemen.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:25.800]  Now, the United Arab Emirates
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.800]  are bringing in mercenaries
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.800]  from South America
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.800]  to go into there,
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.800]  along with Qatar and Kuwait.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.800]  And also,
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.800]  when was the war against Yemen announced?
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:45.800]  It was announced on March 26, 2015
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:48.800]  from Washington, D.C.,
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:51.800]  the Saudi ambassador.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.800]  And then we saw this little guy,
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:57.800]  Blinken, who plays an assistant secretary
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.800]  of something,
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.800]  over in Riyadh,
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.800]  right after they start bombing,
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.800]  and says how the United States
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.800]  is an ally in this murder,
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.800]  supplying reconnaissance,
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.800]  airy-fueling, intelligence, and armaments.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:17.800]  It's not even making the news.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.800]  And then, Alex, I wonder why,
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.800]  I wonder why they hate us.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.800]  I don't understand.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.800]  Only because we're part and parcel,
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.800]  murder is incorporated,
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.800]  slaughtering people around the world.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.800]  And they want to seek revenge.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.800]  I don't understand.
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.800]  Sure. Well, if you add a dimension to that, though,
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.800]  the people attacking us
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.800]  are the groups we're actually allied with
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.800]  backing to slaughter the Shiites
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.800]  and other groups.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.800]  So it even goes beyond that.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:51.800]  In your gut, historically,
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.800]  as a former lobbyist and guy involved
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.800]  at state and federal government,
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.800]  knowing how these corporations operate,
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.800]  my fear is we've got politicians
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.800]  who are removed from the military field of battle.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.800]  They're not even listening to our own generals
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.800]  saying, don't back this Assad takedown,
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.800]  don't back Al Qaeda.
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.800]  They've been saying that for three years.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.800]  And we know they've tried to put the brakes on things.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.800]  I'm really concerned with the Wall Street,
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:17.800]  Goldman Sachs, reckless attitude
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:19.800]  that they have in the stock market and other areas.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.800]  They're going to apply that to war,
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.800]  push Russia too far,
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.800]  and get us into something very serious.
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:27.800]  I mean, Russia has said that they're getting ready
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.800]  to shoot down Turkish aircraft
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.800]  in Syria.
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.800]  Turkey says that's an act of war.
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.800]  They're going to attack.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.800]  They're now launching blockades of the Russians.
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.800]  This is unprecedented acts of war,
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.800]  as Ron Paul and others have said.
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.800]  And meanwhile, I see people sleepwalking,
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.800]  talking about Christmas coming up,
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.800]  having no idea how serious the situation is.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.800]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.800]  And let's go back into Turkey
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.800]  and look what happened in June
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.800]  when Erdogan lost that election,
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.800]  when they didn't get a majority.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.800]  And then immediately after that,
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:01.800]  what did he do?
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.800]  He started war again against the Kurds.
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.800]  And then what happened?
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.800]  And then all of a sudden,
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.800]  a bunch of peaceful demonstrators
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.800]  were slaughtered in Ankara.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.800]  And then what happened?
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.800]  He won the election.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.800]  From a time when it was
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.800]  looked almost improbable,
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.800]  he's back in power.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.800]  They do this all the time, by the way.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.800]  You were talking earlier about France
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.800]  holding on to that little boy of a guy,
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:29.800]  little nothing of a man.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.800]  His popularity rating, Alex,
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.800]  is the lowest in the history,
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:35.800]  the Fifth Republic.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.800]  But
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:39.800]  after the Paris attacks,
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.800]  whoop,
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.800]  shot up 17%.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.800]  Go back to 2001.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.800]  George W. Bush.
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.800]  Got a 90% approval rating
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.800]  in the month after 9-11.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.800]  And his popularity rating
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:55.800]  after only being in office a few months,
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.800]  was going under
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.800]  50%.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.800]  And then he shot back up.
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:03.800]  Exactly. Go back to Turkey.
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.800]  Go back,
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.800]  you asked me what their end game is,
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:09.800]  and I'm saying to you,
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.800]  these are sick people.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:13.800]  They're megalomaniacs.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.800]  Stay in power,
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.800]  and he's basically a dictator,
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.800]  he's starting a war with Russia,
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:21.800]  not a very good idea.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:23.800]  Exactly.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.800]  And you don't hope the Russian bear.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.800]  Anybody thinks
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.800]  they're going to defeat Russia?
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.800]  Yeah.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.800]  You did a great job in Afghanistan.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.800]  Oh, a wonderful job in Iraq.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.800]  Hey, Syria,
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:39.800]  I was thinking of going to Tripoli
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.800]  for my vacation.
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.800]  Libya, rather.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.800]  Syria destroying it.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.800]  And it's one mess after another.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.800]  So you're going to fight Russia?
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:51.800]  You have to be out of your mind.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.800]  And then Obama gets up and
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.800]  grandstands and says,
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.800]  Russia is causing the problems in Syria.
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.800]  This is totally, again,
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:01.800]  an inversion of reality.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.800]  And then we see Halan saying,
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:05.800]  I protect you from terrorists
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.800]  by banning free speech across France,
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.800]  and then arresting his enemies
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:11.800]  when he's the guy that brought
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.800]  the radical Jihadis in.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:15.800]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:17.800]  Yes, and you mentioned about
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:19.800]  people that then become our enemies.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.800]  Did anyone forget
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:23.800]  Little Jimmy Carter and the Mujahideen,
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.800]  those freedom fighters
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.800]  and then through Reagan
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:29.800]  to get those Russians
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:31.800]  out of Afghanistan?
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.800]  And who was the Mujahideen?
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.800]  Wasn't it a guy named Ben Laden
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.800]  was a member of that group?
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.800]  That's right. Stay there. I want to look at the economy.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:41.800]  I want to give the number out and take some calls
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.800]  and go over. You want to go with Gerald Salente

[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.800]  more energy, and it's because

[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.800]  damaging your brain. Ultimately we've all
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:47.800]  been dumbed down to some degree. It doesn't
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:49.800]  have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.800]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.800]  You will find Brain Force and other
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.800]  deals at infowarslife.com
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:33:24.800]  or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.800]  I want to break something down.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.800]  The globalist social engineers
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.800]  they engage in hypocrisy
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:32.800]  openly to break our will
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.800]  and condition us
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.800]  like you titrate
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.800]  the dose of Cobra poison if you work
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.800]  with cobras at a zoo
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.800]  or you work in a facility extracting
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:44.800]  anti-venom, you're going to be
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:46.800]  sick. You're going to be sick.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.800]  You're going to be sick.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:50.800]  You're going to be sick.
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.800]  You're going to be sick.
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.800]  You're going to be extracting anti-venom.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:56.800]  You're going to get bit.
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.800]  And so the people that work at those facilities
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.800]  slowly give themselves
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.800]  the different toxins, the neurotoxins
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.800]  the other toxins the snakes
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:06.800]  can put off
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.800]  until you can take a huge cobra bite
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.800]  and not die in 30 seconds or 2 minutes
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.800]  like a 20 foot king cobra would do to you.
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.800]  Because it pumps so much of it into you
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:16.800]  it's so deadly.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.800]  And
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.800]  but this is not having a dosage of poison
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:22.800]  but it's being hydrated
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.800]  so that
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:26.800]  we actually can survive.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.800]  This is conditioning us
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:30.800]  to where we just put up with tyranny
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.800]  and get used to anything and everything
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.800]  and basically end up in a totally
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.800]  captured position
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.800]  and on the first class flight on American Airlines
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:40.800]  to be on the view
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.800]  I've told the story many times
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.800]  like six, seven years ago
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.800]  there was the head of one of the big five banks
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.800]  and I said why aren't you flying
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.800]  and he goes I was seeing my dad
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:52.800]  retired general down in San Antonio
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.800]  whatever I just don't like to mess with the private jets
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.800]  I get on them sometimes for corporate stuff
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.800]  and by the end of the plane ride
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.800]  about an hour into it
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:02.800]  we didn't talk much he goes you're Alex Jones
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.800]  and then he was just
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.800]  basically telling me you're going to fail
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:08.800]  we're going to win people are going to
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.800]  adapt but not to resisting
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.800]  our takeover
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.800]  they're going to adapt to us
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.800]  and we're going to be plaguing
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.800]  and people say well why don't you tell us his name
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.800]  he said this is an off record discussion
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.800]  he's told me what a failure I was
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.800]  and how pathetic I was and how they were going to win
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.800]  he was super confident
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.800]  super evil super in my face
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.800]  and then I wouldn't stop
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.800]  talking to him and he kind of just said hey I'm done talking to you
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.800]  but he said private corporations
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.800]  will take over all governments
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.800]  we will run the world we know how to handle it best
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.800]  and I was like but you're wrecking the economies
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.800]  and then saying you're handling them best
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.800]  last night I was watching History Channel
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:52.800]  after this Donald Trump special
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:54.800]  they had and they had this whole show
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.800]  about how great the robber barons were
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:58.800]  and how great the Rockefellers were
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.800]  and how they built America and how they love us
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.800]  how they took over medicine
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.800]  of course I know the real history
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:06.800]  on record it's horrible what they've done
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.800]  they funded Hitler
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.800]  for heaven's sakes
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.800]  they didn't get into
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.800]  altruism
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.800]  they didn't get into being philanthropists
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.800]  because they wanted to give away their money
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.800]  they made their money tax exempt
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.800]  in foundations and paid no taxes
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.800]  just like bill them on the gates it's a known scam
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.800]  their wealth only gotten bigger
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.800]  it was like 80 billion
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.800]  and they gave like 60 billion
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.800]  and now that's 60 billions over 100 billion
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.800]  and they've got another 80-90 billion
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.800]  just right I mean
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:38.800]  who was that famous billionaire lady she said
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.800]  taxes rich people don't pay taxes
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.800]  seriously true
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:44.800]  you make $200,000 a year
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.800]  the average blue collar worker thinks you're rich
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.800]  you pay 40% federal
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:50.800]  but you make billions a year
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:52.800]  you basically pay nothing
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.800]  they got it all worked out
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.800]  we're going back to Gerald Salente
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.800]  800-259-9231
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.800]  800-2599-231
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:02.800]  is your chance as first time callers
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.800]  we're doing a few calls for Gerald Salente
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.800]  first time callers bring up subjects, trends
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.800]  questions, comments you have
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.800]  800-259-9231
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.800]  I want to get into the economy
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.800]  other big trends he sees the election
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:16.800]  but first
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.800]  very briefly
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:20.800]  we have free shipping that was going to end yesterday
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.800]  I've just decided it's so popular
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:24.800]  people like it so much
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.800]  I want to introduce you to the products
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.800]  all the great items we have

[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.800]  and I promise it will end then
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.800]  because sales historically go down so low
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.800]  that we can't take the shipping off
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.800]  we then lose money
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.800]  and can't even run the operation
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.800]  but when we get a lot of orders we can actually lower prices
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.800]  that's how economies work
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.800]  booming economies basically raise all ships
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:02.800]  and so we've got amazing deals

[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.800]  as the week goes through
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.800]  those different specials will be over

[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.800]  is that wonderful quote from Samuel Adams
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:44.800]  it does not take a majority
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.800]  to prevail
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.800]  rather an irate tireless
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:50.800]  minority
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.800]  keen on setting brush fires of freedom
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.800]  in the minds of men
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.800]  and info wars

[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.800]  and there's another great quote when people wonder
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.800]  what can they do
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:10.800]  and they're not doing anything from Andrew Jackson
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:12.800]  and he said
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.800]  one
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.800]  courageous man
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.800]  makes a majority
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.800]  the words to that effect
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:22.800]  so one man
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.800]  one courageous man or woman is a majority
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.800]  and I also
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:28.800]  in listening to the products
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:30.800]  that you're offering
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:32.800]  to your listeners
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:34.800]  they're all high quality
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:36.800]  when you have everything out there
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:38.800]  that's killing us
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.800]  with these GMOs
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.800]  with all these other things that are poisoning us
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.800]  on a daily basis
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.800]  and I think that you know
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:48.800]  that I also have an honorary doctorate
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:50.800]  integrative and complimentary medicine
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.800]  from the National University of Health Sciences
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:54.800]  so I'm into this for a lot of years
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:56.800]  and it's very important
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.800]  not to people only
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.800]  buy these products
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.800]  and use them for themselves
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.800]  but to also to support what you're doing
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:06.800]  so that you can let
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.800]  the voice of freedom ring
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.800]  because as people know
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.800]  that are tuned in
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.800]  to info wars
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.800]  six corporations
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.800]  control 90%
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.800]  of all of the media
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.800]  Soros Run Media Matters admits
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:24.800]  they want to shut us down
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.800]  they want to shut Drudge Down and others
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.800]  like WorldNet Daily or Self Town
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.800]  they don't want any other voices
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.800]  because you've always talked about the new renaissance
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.800]  and people shopping local
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.800]  people supporting Liberty based organizations
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:38.800]  that's what the internal Clinton files
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:40.800]  that
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.800]  folks sued and got showed
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.800]  they were worried in the early 90s about the rise of new media
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.800]  they want a monopoly
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.800]  and you've spoken so much about people
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.800]  voting with their dollars
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:52.800]  changing the world
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.800]  well you saw it with these Christmas sales
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:56.800]  that just came out you know Black Friday
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:58.800]  what a terrible name
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:00.800]  how could you put anything
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.800]  about shopping for Christmas
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.800]  but anyway
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:06.800]  there used to be about this guy Jesus
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:08.800]  had something to do with that
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.800]  but now it's all about shopping anyway
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:12.800]  it was a big resurgence
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:14.800]  according to the latest reports that came out
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.800]  in people shopping local
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:18.800]  and that's not making much of the news
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:20.800]  so going on to the other trends
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:22.800]  but again I want to encourage everybody
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:24.800]  to support what you're doing
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:26.800]  because it's not only about
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:28.800]  keeping the voice out there ringing
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.800]  but also buying products
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.800]  that are going to help you
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:34.800]  live a healthy life
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:36.800]  absolutely
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.800]  and that's one of the big trends that we're looking at
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.800]  by the way it's the new trends
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.800]  top trends for 2016
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.800]  are coming out
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.800]  one of them is artful aging
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:48.800]  baby boomers are
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.800]  and babies no more
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.800]  the leading edge of us
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:54.800]  are going to be
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.800]  70 years old
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:58.800]  in 2016
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.800]  when you look at the trends
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.800]  there are
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:04.800]  America and most countries
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.800]  it's the first second and third world nation
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.800]  only a small percentage
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.800]  of people are going to get it
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:12.800]  and try to do everything they can
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.800]  not to end up as inmates
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:16.800]  in nursing homes
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.800]  which again goes back to the products
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.800]  that you're selling
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.800]  and so many others in local businesses
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.800]  and by local
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:26.800]  and the anti-GMO trends
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:28.800]  so what we're saying is
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.800]  even though it's going to be
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.800]  a minority
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:34.800]  when you're in a country of what
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:36.800]  315 million people
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:38.800]  plus
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.800]  a minority is a big number
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.800]  and you have 70
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:44.800]  8 million baby boomers
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.800]  that are now reaching 70 years old
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:50.800]  this is a huge market
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:52.800]  where do you go to
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:54.800]  the longevity centers
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:56.800]  to live healthy lives
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.800]  where are you going to go
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:00.800]  are you going to call it a day
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.800]  the courthouse is right across the street
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.800]  and I ask people
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.800]  how do you like your job
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:08.800]  3 years 5 months
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.800]  and 6 days
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.800]  in other words they gave up their lives
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:14.800]  for security
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:16.800]  now they don't have to
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.800]  so you're going to become the person
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.800]  you said you were or could have been
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.800]  artful aging is a huge trend
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:24.800]  physical emotional
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.800]  spiritual I'm not talking about religious
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:28.800]  people that tie into that
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.800]  that's going to be a big one
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.800]  on the economic front
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.800]  look at the data coming out
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.800]  current events form future trends
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.800]  the manufacturers purchasing
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:40.800]  managers index came out today
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.800]  it's well below 50%
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:44.800]  it has to be above 50
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:46.800]  to show growth below 40
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.800]  shows decline
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:50.800]  not only decline here but it came out
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:52.800]  last night over in China
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:54.800]  there's indexes down again
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.800]  now you start
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.800]  putting things together
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.800]  on Thursday the European Union
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.800]  is going to
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.800]  the European Central Bank
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:06.800]  is going to announce
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.800]  whether or not they're going to go
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:10.800]  lower into negative interest rates
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:12.800]  and more quantitative easing
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:14.800]  then come back to the states
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.800]  they're going to have to raise
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:18.800]  interest rates at some point
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:20.800]  most people the majority
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:22.800]  in both the financial
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.800]  and the commodities end
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:26.800]  are believing that the Federal Reserve
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.800]  is going to raise interest rates
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:30.800]  maybe 25
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:32.800]  basis points which means nothing
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:34.800]  it means a lot
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.800]  because over in Europe
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:38.800]  if they go
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:40.800]  into more negative interest rates
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:42.800]  you're seeing the Euro decline
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:44.800]  under a dollar five to a dollar
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:46.800]  what does that mean
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.800]  well it means the people in Europe
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.800]  is going to cost them more to buy
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:52.800]  everything but not only
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.800]  that as their currencies
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.800]  decline it's going to be a lot
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:58.800]  worse in the emerging markets
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.800]  because as the dollar gets stronger
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:02.800]  all these emerging markets
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.800]  that boosted up
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.800]  when they had all this quantitative easing
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:08.800]  and borrowed all that cheap
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.800]  money in dollars
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:12.800]  their currencies are crashing
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:14.800]  and they have to pay back
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:16.800]  this huge debt with declining
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:18.800]  currencies against rising
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:20.800]  dollars
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:22.800]  so we're in the face
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:24.800]  of the top trend
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:26.800]  the 2016 is a global
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.800]  recession
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.800]  we'll look at gold prices
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:34.800]  it has a total disconnect
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:36.800]  between what's going on in the real world
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:38.800]  and what's going on in the rigged markets
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:40.800]  rigged markets
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:42.800]  LIBOR rates were rigged
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:44.800]  it's the fact
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:46.800]  6 banks convicted of felonies
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:48.800]  for fixing interest rates
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.800]  and the forex markets
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:52.800]  currency markets
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.800]  that are traded at $5.3 trillion
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:56.800]  a day
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:58.800]  but hey
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:00.800]  nobody goes to jail
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.800]  when you're a member of the white shoe board
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:04.800]  that's right because corporations are people
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:06.800]  so the guys that actually come into the crimes
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.800]  don't get in trouble the company gets a slap on the wrist
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.800]  that's right
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.800]  so look at the numbers that are coming out
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:14.800]  in the amount of
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:16.800]  gold coins
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:18.800]  gold bullion
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.800]  that are being purchased in the united states
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:22.800]  and around the world
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:24.800]  they're hitting record levels
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:26.800]  I have some of the numbers
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:28.800]  right here
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.800]  I had them right here one second ago
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:32.800]  let me see if I could find them
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:34.800]  what did I do with them
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:36.800]  I know that feeling
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.800]  when I have stacks of news in front of me
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.800]  that I want to specifically
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:42.800]  here we go
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:44.800]  US demand for
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.800]  bars and coins up 207%
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.800]  according to the world gold council
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.800]  gold demand rose 8%
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.800]  on year
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:56.800]  US clocking
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:58.800]  robust global consumer demand growth
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:00.800]  at 62%
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.800]  check it out
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:04.800]  in China
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:06.800]  investment demand grew
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:08.800]  70%
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:10.800]  in China and India
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:12.800]  they're counting for
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:14.800]  45% of total demand
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:16.800]  Europe
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:18.800]  up 35%
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:20.800]  as you keep seeing this refugee crisis
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:22.800]  as you keep seeing
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:24.800]  more and more turmoil
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:26.800]  people are going for the safe haven
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.800]  and guess what
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.800]  it's not only we the little
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.800]  crazy people
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:34.800]  central banks
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.800]  175
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:38.800]  tons near the
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.800]  record high levels
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:42.800]  for the same period last year
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:44.800]  and this just came out
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:46.800]  US
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:48.800]  mint sales of American eagle coins
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:50.800]  surged in November
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:52.800]  with gold nearly
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:54.800]  tripling month over month
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:56.800]  so let me ask you this question
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:58.800]  they're able to drive down precious metals
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:00.800]  commodity prices even though
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.800]  the commodities are selling at record levels
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:04.800]  that is a rigged economy just like
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:06.800]  the forex, the currency, the libel or the interest rates
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:08.800]  it's all admitted to be a rigged
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:10.800]  that's all come out now
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:12.800]  what we said 20 years ago
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:14.800]  it's all documented now
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:16.800]  so where does it all end
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:18.800]  will this be the triumph of rigged economies
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:20.800]  where the insiders at the top
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.800]  make record profits and everybody else gets poor
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:24.800]  or what will happen
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.800]  as reality breaks away from the fraud
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.800]  will there be two new economies
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:30.800]  where's this going
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:32.800]  well again you look at these
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:34.800]  the gold sales and compare that to other commodities
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.800]  oils down because demand is down
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:38.800]  nickels down
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:40.800]  coppers down
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:42.800]  aluminum's down because demand is down
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:44.800]  gold's down because
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:46.800]  it's being rigged
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.800]  demand is way up
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:50.800]  it shows it in the numbers
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:52.800]  sure we know they naked short
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:54.800]  and they trade gold
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.800]  amongst themselves that never moves
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.800]  at lower prices to create artificiality
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:00.800]  I mean what's the answer to that
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:02.800]  criminal charges
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.800]  what the criminals are in charge
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:06.800]  who are they going to charge
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:08.800]  look at the guy the criminal Eric Holder
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:10.800]  no I agree so where does it go
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:12.800]  where does it go then
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:14.800]  again it's the worst thing that could happen
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.800]  for the central banks
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:18.800]  that were talking about negative interest rates
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:20.800]  devaluing their currencies
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:22.800]  for gold prices to go up
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:24.800]  because then people see what a fraud it is
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:26.800]  get out of dollars, euros, gens and you on
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:28.800]  where's it going to go
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:30.800]  at some time Ponzi dies
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:32.800]  when that time
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:34.800]  will come it's
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:36.800]  becoming harder and harder
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:38.800]  well Ron Paul and many others think we're getting really close
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:40.800]  in the world itself's in depression
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.800]  I agree the west is in recession
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:44.800]  but I mean look at what's happening in Europe
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:46.800]  in other areas I just think a lot of this is propaganda
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:48.800]  where they tell us the economy's great
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:50.800]  but it's not it's kind of unevenly distributed
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:52.800]  we're going to come back in two final segments
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.800]  with Gerald Salente and take phone calls

[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:50.800]  hillary clinton shot out at the comedy club
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:52.800]  but I had an idea because
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:54.800]  I'm not going to make a video
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:56.800]  I just don't have the tools or whatever to do that
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.800]  but my idea was to go to the comedy club
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:00.800]  myself make a small flyer
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:02.800]  and tell the guys at the comedy club
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:04.800]  we don't make a lot of money and offer that
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:06.800]  to them to say hey if you guys make a video
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:08.800]  you guys submit it you can win 5 grand
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:10.800]  well that's the answer is to get

[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:24.800]  the first of the year and it's just about
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:26.800]  responding to her her official campaign
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:28.800]  threatening to shut people down
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:30.800]  threatening to basically break their legs
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:32.800]  what does this say
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:34.800]  about the mindset of hillary clinton gerald salenta

[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:40.800]  with all her acts of violence
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:42.800]  launching the war against
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:44.800]  Syria
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:46.800]  launching the war against

[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:02.800]  another psychopath
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.800]  and cbs
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:06.800]  if the bill clinton put on
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:08.800]  sanctions against the iraq
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:10.800]  people forget that clinton was bombing bag
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:12.800]  that as soon as he got elected
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:14.800]  and was no fly zones
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:16.800]  and they asked her leslie
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:18.800]  stall asked madeline all bright
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.800]  if the death of 500,000
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:22.800]  iraqi children
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:24.800]  under the age of five
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:26.800]  was worth the price of the sanctions
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:28.800]  she said yes
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.800]  again bring out the straight
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:32.800]  jacket take them away
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:34.800]  there were criminals
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:36.800]  they're like hitler attacking their neighbors for no reason
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:38.800]  i know
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.800]  and no one wants to do it
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:42.800]  and you know we have our forecast
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:44.800]  that came out in the trends journal
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:46.800]  back in the spring
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.800]  the cover was the presidential reality show
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:50.800]  and that was before trump got on
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:52.800]  and we said
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:54.800]  that as things stand now
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:56.800]  and as they still stand today
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:58.800]  hillary is going to win
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:00.800]  and the reason being
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:02.800]  is that women are going to vote for her
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:04.800]  even though they don't like her
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:06.800]  even though they find her disingenuous
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:08.800]  they're going to vote for her
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:10.800]  because she's a woman they say it all the time
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:12.800]  again that's what we're finding in our research
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:14.800]  so
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:16.800]  it doesn't make and again
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:18.800]  when you look at the level of the politicians
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:20.800]  could you imagine
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.800]  eisenhower
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:24.800]  going on
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:26.800]  the view or yucking it up
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:28.800]  a virginity sound
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:30.800]  everything down let's go to the call great point rich
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:32.800]  eric in california you're on the air
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:34.800]  with joseph lente go ahead
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:36.800]  deftly gentlemen
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.800]  i am a former marine 3-2
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:40.800]  arachnid
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.800]  and i just had a question for you guys about
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:44.800]  obama
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.800]  and trying to stay in power
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:48.800]  with this
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:50.800]  going to war with russia thing what do you guys think about that
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:52.800]  is there a danger they can start a major war with russia
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:54.800]  and try to have a civil emergency
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:56.800]  i don't think they're going to try
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:58.800]  to start a war with russia
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:00.800]  but i do think there's going to be a civil
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:02.800]  emergency of some type
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:04.800]  you cannot keep having all this violence
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:06.800]  without any revenge or payback
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:08.800]  and that's going to be the excuse
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:10.800]  to let loose more of our
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:12.800]  rights and also may be an excuse
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:14.800]  to close banks and
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:16.800]  devalue the currency
[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:18.800]  because they're going to have to do something to get
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:20.800]  those get them out of this mess
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:22.800]  eric don't hang up i want to come back
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:24.800]  and get you to respond to what do you think is a veteran
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:26.800]  of openly backing al qaeda
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:28.800]  now what obama is doing
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:30.800]  where all this is going i want to get your view on that
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:32.800]  your view on a civil emergency then we're going to go
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:34.800]  to neil paul

[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:48.800]  870-485-7015
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:19.300]  That's what's happening, power mad people.
[02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:20.960]  And we're just jumping up and down,
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:23.040]  trying to wake the country up out of its trance
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:24.360]  to stop these people.
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:28.560]  But Eric, you say you served three tours in Iraq.
[02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:31.400]  Now, years later,
[02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:33.480]  seeing what the Middle East has been turned into,
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:35.680]  what's happening in Syria, what's your view?
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:38.720]  Me and my boys are completely pissed
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:41.240]  that they've allowed al-Qaeda in Iraq
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:42.960]  and ISIS to retake all the ground
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:48.920]  that we've put our blood into, we're sick of hearing about it,
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:50.160]  all of us.
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:52.200]  And I don't think any one of us would really want
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:55.640]  to go back ISIS or beat our air force or any of that stuff.
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:57.680]  It's just not gonna happen.
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:59.800]  Well, sure, and there was really good propaganda
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:01.600]  at the time that Saddam was behind 9-11
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:02.440]  and the rest of it.
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:03.920]  We can look in hindsight and know that's a fraud,
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:05.760]  but I don't blame the troops who were misguided.
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:08.400]  I blame the liars that fixed the intelligence
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:10.680]  at the Pentagon, but now we know all this
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:12.080]  and now they don't even care.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:16.000]  They're backing al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, ISIS publicly.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.480]  The Russians are calling them on it.
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:20.280]  I mean, have they jumped the shark, Gerald Salente?
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:21.120]  Thanks for the call, Eric.
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:22.960]  Have they gone too far?
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:24.360]  Well, they've gone way too far.
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:25.560]  There's no way out.
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:29.160]  Everything that the administrations have done are failures.
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.640]  You're hearing one general after another
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:33.880]  coming out and saying it's a mistake.
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:36.440]  It was just a report that just came out now
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:38.640]  about a general as well.
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:43.640]  A former commander of Special Forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:47.080]  Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn.
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:50.200]  He told Der Spiegel, the German newspaper,
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:53.880]  he said, quote, first we went to Afghanistan
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:57.040]  where al-Qaeda was based, then we went to Iraq.
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:00.800]  Instead of asking ourselves why the phenomenon
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:04.920]  of terror occurred, we were looking for locations.
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:08.120]  This is a major lesson we must learn in order
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.560]  not to make the same mistakes again.
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:16.560]  He said it was a huge error, as brutal as Saddam Hussein was,
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:19.960]  it was a mistake to just eliminate him.
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:23.560]  The same is true for Gaddafi and Philippia,
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:25.600]  which is now a failed state.
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:26.680]  And by the way, he's the head of former
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:27.720]  head of Defense Intelligence.
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:30.400]  He went public saying they were ordered to back al-Qaeda
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:32.720]  consciously by Hillary and Obama.
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:37.720]  So again, it's mentally ill people
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:39.840]  that are running the country.
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:43.200]  And not only here, look what's going on in France.
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:46.400]  And the poor young guys are buying into the same thing.
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:49.440]  They're signing up in record numbers right now.
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:51.920]  When it's their government that brought the jihadis in,
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:54.000]  Neil in Arizona, last caller we have time for,
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.360]  I'll go to others that the zero leaves us.
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:57.720]  Quick question, Neil, thanks for calling.
[02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:00.680]  Yeah, I'd like to ask Gerald Palente a question.
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:05.040]  My blog on YouTube is global economic collapse.
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:08.520]  70% of the US economy is consumer-based,
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:10.200]  floating debt economy.
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:14.960]  What happens to the US if China pulls the plug, sir?
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:17.280]  I don't think China's gonna pull the plug.
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:20.520]  They need business and they're in deep problems.
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:23.440]  But global slowdown is pulling the plug, right?
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:24.280]  Excuse me?
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:26.680]  But global slowdown does slowly pull the plug, though,
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:27.520]  doesn't it?
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:29.200]  Exactly, that's where it's all about.
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:32.600]  But again, our forecast keep coming out,
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:36.720]  our timing is wrong because they keep making up new stuff.
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:39.200]  You're looking at deeper negative interest rates
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:41.280]  in Europe, negative interest rates.
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:44.920]  You borrow money and you buy bonds in Switzerland
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:48.080]  in 10 years, you're guaranteed to get back
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:48.920]  less than your debt.
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:50.200]  That's Alice in Wonderland.
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:52.000]  So they've gone to Alice in Wonderland stuff,
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.600]  that's gotta create some weird effects.
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:58.400]  It is, there's going to be a global explosion,
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:03.400]  a bubble of $225 trillion in debt
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  like we've never seen in our lifetime.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.960]  And then there'll be a false flag or a reel
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:11.920]  that'll get our mind off it.
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:12.760]  That's right.
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:14.880]  And they'll take us to war.
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.560]  Gosh, I hope they don't do it with the Russians.
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:19.440]  These people, as you know, are crazy enough to kill us all.
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:22.000]  Yeah, it's not gonna be the Russians.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.320]  It's gonna come from some other place.
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:27.440]  No, they're not gonna deal with the Russians.
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:29.960]  I think the administration is smart enough
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:33.120]  not to push them too far, but they'll keep pushing.

[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.240]  Folks should get your quarterly.
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:41.000]  They should sign up for your email alerts in valuable info.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.280]  I have a great Christmas coming up.
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:44.320]  God bless you and we'll talk to you soon.
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:45.360]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:48.560]  There goes Gerald Salente, absolutely on target.
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:49.960]  We're just here ringing the alarm bells.
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:52.400]  So hopefully sanity reigns and the generals
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:55.120]  are running around by the dozen saying this is insane.
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:56.920]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:04:58.560]  We have crazy people running, thanks.
[02:04:58.560 --> 02:04:59.840]  We'll be back.
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:02.240]  The latest victims of social justice warrior
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:03.880]  political correctness brainwashing
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:06.400]  is a kindergarten class in Captain Johnston Blakely
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.120]  elementary school in Washington state.
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:10.360]  Teacher Karen Keller is on a quest to indoctrinate
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:12.720]  her class with the mindlessness of gender equality
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:14.960]  by banning boys from using Legos.
[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:17.320]  That's right, she told the Bainbridge Island Review,
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:19.360]  I always tell the boys, you're gonna have a turn.
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:22.000]  And I'm like, yeah, when hell raises over in my head,
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.240]  I tell them, you'll have a turn
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:25.120]  because I don't want them to feel bad.
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:27.080]  She started this exercise in futility
[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:29.280]  because boys were flocking to the colorful blocks
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:31.400]  during their free choice playtime.
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:34.040]  While girls tended to play with dolls or crayons,
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:35.920]  she tried using pink and purple Legos
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:37.200]  to attract the girl's students,
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:38.760]  but she found that ineffective.
[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:41.280]  So that led to an outright ban for boys.
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:43.680]  Keller defends her actions by saying they're fair
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:45.560]  because she's giving different students the tools
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:47.120]  they need to succeed.
[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:48.880]  Wonder why there's such a control freak attitude
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:49.840]  in Bainbridge Island?
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:51.360]  We'll take a short ferry ride to Seattle
[02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:53.840]  where officials want to end the term brown bag.
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:55.480]  There's definitely something in the water
[02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:57.400]  or in the coffee in Washington state.

[02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:04.360]  gonna open the phones up again on world events for people he is covering right
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:09.880]  now the craziness going on in Paris France for the next week or so and that
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:15.480]  is the biggest gathering of world leaders ever it's being built Lord
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:18.800]  Moncton's on what tomorrow breaking this down with us we have some other big
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:23.280]  guests tomorrow I'm just gonna leave that at that and they're literally a
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:28.800]  thousand dollar a plate caviar dinners taxpayer paid for jumbo jets Israeli
[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:34.040]  surveillance blimps red carpets and they're up there saying we saved you
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:39.840]  from the terrorist now past global government to to deal with them so they're
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:43.280]  conflating the terror attacks that they helped happen by bringing their
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:47.240]  refugees in and advertising it you know the world for jihadis to come in they're
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:52.520]  almost all Sunnis that failed to take over Syria now evacuating to Europe and
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:58.480]  the criminals that launched the attack it's just unspeakable and even mainline
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:02.080]  media admits they're trying to basically ratify the TPP without
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:06.440]  governments even having time to vote on it so so much is happening they're also
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:12.120]  proposing an enforcement arm on speech if you deny man-made climate change
[02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:15.160]  didn't notice it's climate change now the last few years not not global warming
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:20.280]  and the thing is it's so over the top what the talitarians they are they're
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:24.360]  arresting conservative leaders in France to criticize open borders who lead in
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:29.080]  presidential polls like Marie Lapin while with straight faces basically
[02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:35.840]  declaring civil emergency so the left has openly become flaming tyrants the
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:38.840]  right-wing worldwide I guess either works with them or is scared of them
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:43.920]  James Dillingpole joins us what's going on with these people is it that they
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:50.880]  realize their constituents now support the talitarianism what is the left going
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:56.720]  for because they really seem to be in a death orgy right now trying to bring down
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:11:01.760]  the last in some bizarre temper tantrum that is discrediting them but they don't
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:06.080]  seem to care what's going on or do you think my analysis that they've gone
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:10.280]  completely insane is wrong no they haven't gone insane they were always
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:16.040]  insane I think I think I don't know what whether you're familiar with the name
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:21.320]  Morris Maurice Strong the Canadian one-world government guy he died a
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:25.800]  couple of days ago and and it passed almost unnoticed by the world's media
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:30.560]  but I would argue that this is this that man is one of the most dangerous man of
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:37.040]  the 20th century because he was the guy who started the set the ball rolling
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:43.960]  with the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 that was the first big global climate summit
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:47.960]  and you remember all the world leaders flew over there and they signed up to
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:53.320]  this thing called Agenda 21 which again I'm sure that some of your listeners
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:59.040]  will be familiar with and it is basically the blueprint for one world
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:03.560]  government all these guys who turn up to these these meetings they're
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:09.920]  essentially part of this massive UN operate United Nations apparatus they
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:14.100]  may not all be one world government freaks but they are caught in this
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:20.320]  system which steers the world inexorably towards one world government you think
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:23.960]  of all the different branches of the United Nations from the United
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:28.880]  Nations Environment Programme to the World Health Organization etc etc
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:35.760]  all these things use environmentalism as a way of increasing the global
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:41.840]  bureaucratic control of the United Nations and similar bodies so that is
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:46.320]  ultimately it what it's about it's got really very little to do with saving the
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:51.360]  planet it's certainly got nothing to do with the science the science and the
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:55.840]  global warming movement parted company a very long time ago by the way I agree
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:59.920]  with your piercing analysis every generation looks back at the last
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:04.720]  generation Stalin Hitler Mao and thinks craze-eyed megalomaniacs rubbing their
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:09.360]  hands together on power trips belong to the last generation and then we don't
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:15.240]  recognize our new crazed tyrants until we're halfway into the woodchipper that's
[02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:20.520]  absolutely it I think that we because we've been programmed to think that that
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:25.280]  that evil men must wear jackboots or they've got scars down their faces or
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:29.880]  they've got whiteberry cats on their lap we forget that a lot of most dangerous
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:35.880]  people in the world really want to do the right thing I mean I'm sure if you
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:39.640]  if you'd met Morris strong I never did but if you'd met him I'm sure you'd have
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:42.720]  found him personally very charmed he was a true believer he thought they were
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:47.120]  saving the earth but of course by themselves in power exactly and I I
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:52.000]  mean you look at an idea where you've ever seen a nature TV documentary with
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.160]  with David Attenborough he does BBC documentaries about polar bears and
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:59.800]  things and he's a very well-loved figure and he's a very very nice man with a
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:03.960]  lovely soft whispery voice but the problem is that some of the stuff he
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:08.480]  believed is is really quite dangerous that he believes that that there are too
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:12.440]  many humans on the planet and that this is something we need to address and so
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:16.080]  on well I don't think that there's anything there's any room for that
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:20.480]  mouth-usinism in the planet it was wrong in in the 18th century when
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:24.960]  Thomas Malthus was first espousing it and it's wrong now human beings do far
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:30.080]  more good than bad the planet and we are not as the club of Rome once put it the
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:33.920]  cancer you remember that and we certainly don't want an elite group who
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:39.240]  decides who lives and who's dies well you're a man bro I'm certainly with you
[02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:43.600]  on that one you do not want unelected bureaucratic elite who tend to swing
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:48.320]  left unfortunately anyway I don't want these guys telling me what to do I'd
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:52.320]  like to live my own life thank you free of that that's constrained well plus
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:55.480]  there's such hypocrites they have the biggest carbon footprints they live
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:15:00.320]  like gods and beyond kings and then they're telling the Africans you can't
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:03.240]  have air conditioning or car how about we're gonna develop you know high tech
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:07.720]  cars and air conditioners for you I mean it's just such an arrogance it's an
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:13.200]  elite club you look you look for example at the one of the biggest charge of
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:17.020]  organization in America one of the most powerful I think one of the most
[02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:23.200]  dangerous the nature conservancy Ted Turner one of the richest men in America
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:30.040]  he has brought up the ways of the American landscape and sequestered it made
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:33.360]  sure that it can never be developed for anything it can never be used for
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:37.560]  sport it can never be in use commercially exploited that's it that's
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:41.640]  bits of America gone which are now in the hands of this kind of unelected
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:46.080]  elite you never voted for Ted Turner you never you never said well hang on Ted
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:50.560]  you never said to him I know Ted I want you to put aside all that land and never
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:56.960]  allow any American to use it again these guys are well I'm sorry I think they're
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:02.920]  evil basically I really do well they are you've been tracking this mega summit
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:07.120]  that they're building is bigger than the 21 conference that's strong put on in
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:17.200]  92 is that hype or is this a big power grab this is just look Paris in in 2015
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:24.880]  is the same as as camcune and whatever it was 2011 and barley in 2014 I forget
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:29.680]  the exact years Lima they always choose really nice places that to go on these
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:34.800]  on these duals and they the world leaders fly out in their private jets and
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:41.640]  and and the entourage flies out and they all arrive by by limo and they they
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:47.480]  brought up these massive carbon footprints and it becomes almost an end in
[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:51.360]  itself the elephant in the room the reason that the reason that that there
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:58.120]  will there will be no really binding agreement is China China is the world
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:06.160]  biggest biggest producer of carbon dioxide I mean it's industry is it is
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:12.520]  massive and the Chinese have no intention whatsoever of of stopping that
[02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:16.200]  the economic growth which the people want I mean the Chinese Communist Party
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:19.960]  does not want to a revolution on its hands and now it is India they're
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:23.720]  telling India though you've got to make cuts but China doesn't and India saying
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:26.920]  that's discriminatory that's the whole point of this isn't it picking winners
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:30.880]  and losers well yeah the Indians aren't going to buy it either and this is the
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:35.240]  other thing we in the west imagine that we call the shots we don't anymore
[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:40.440]  India and China do the developing world do and then say you're going to see this
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:45.600]  massive clash between between between the I suppose the east and the east and
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.400]  the west and it's one we're not going to win because the Chinese aren't stupid
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:55.560]  that I mean they'll they'll play along with the green stuff to to if they
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:58.880]  think it but they're going to get some money out of it but behind the door the
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.200]  closed doors they're going to carry on mining that coal and belching out that
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:08.120]  carbon dioxide and giving their people a an improved standard of living and why
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:13.160]  not well that's what frustrates me about India and China is they won't put in the
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:18.320]  clean plants then we put in plants so clean that nothing bad comes out but
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:22.200]  carbon dioxide and water they listed as toxic waste and then just shut our
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:28.920]  plants down suiciding the UK steel industry suiciding ours this is crazy
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:33.560]  well everything you say there is is perfectly true but you've got to remember
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:40.800]  that the Chinese industry is pretty much in the dark ages relative to Western
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:43.680]  industry they haven't got the same technologies that they haven't got the
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:48.080]  same but this is what you get when you have a sort of communist state you don't
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:53.400]  get freed you don't get technological leaps you don't get some entrepreneurs
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:57.560]  devising clever new methods all the Chinese technology is either bought
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:01.880]  from the West or stolen from the West and they're still many many they still
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:06.960]  have to use far more energy to produce produce less China can't even build
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:13.760]  sand missiles that work no that's the this is what Chinese like so we it
[02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:18.800]  would be naive for us to listen to the Chinese when they well it would be need
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:22.920]  it'd be nice to listen to Greenpeace when Greenpeace tells us about how green
[02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:29.480]  China is and how how keen China is to to to greenify its economy China China
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:34.320]  does not give a talk about being green it it'll do whatever is necessary to
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:38.480]  advance its course absolutely and it hopes we handicapped ourselves by not
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:42.160]  having energy James Dillingpole price one telegraph you name it joining us

[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:07.400]  Ted Cruz has come out and said the overwhelming majority of criminals are
[02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:11.080]  Democrats the demographics show that we're gonna cover that the next segment
[02:24:11.080 --> 02:24:15.040]  go to your phone calls and I'm not even a Republican I'm a libertarian but the
[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:22.560]  Democrats are morphing into a mentally ill criminal organization I mean look at
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:26.960]  how the radical socialists are combining forces with radical Islamists as soon as
[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:30.800]  to then oppress everyone in Europe it's truly sickening final segment with
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:34.440]  Dilling poll right now and we're breaking down the situation unfolding
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:38.400]  worldwide James Dilling poll what else is important from your research for
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:42.480]  folks to know about this global government save the world climate summit
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:46.520]  and then also what do you make of the waves of migrants how far do you think
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:49.920]  that's going to go have the socialists finally in their attempt to wreck the
[02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:56.480]  West jump the shark. That's a lot of questions there well that you mentioned
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:02.080]  the Pope earlier on it's very interesting that Banky Moon the general
[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:06.360]  secretary of the United Nations managed to co-opt the Pope into this great
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:12.680]  climate crusade I mean I hated that speech Obama made but but he was
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:16.560]  absolutely right when he said that there really are no political leaders in the
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:21.440]  world who are against this thing and this has got nothing to do with with their
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:26.640]  expert knowledge of the subject it's just because they they just go with the
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:32.760]  flow it's become all-consuming. I would argue that the far more serious
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:36.280]  issues that facing us in the world today one of them would be immigration
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:41.640]  definitely climate change would come way way down on the list and that I'd say
[02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:45.680]  it comes down way down the list of most normal people but unfortunately we don't
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:49.920]  seem to get the same the matter there is this democratic deficit whereby the
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:53.200]  political class is going to railroad through this policy anyway regardless of
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:59.640]  what we think. I agree with you what do you think the main motive is of Merkel and
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:06.520]  Hollande and Obama to want to bring in unlimited amounts of immigrants? I think
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:10.960]  that it's it's not they haven't even thought it through I genuinely they
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:17.760]  haven't thought it through I think it's because politicians like virtue signaling
[02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:23.120]  that that is they want to be seen to be nice caring people they want to be and
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:28.760]  and it suits the narrative that look we care about people look here are some
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:32.900]  immigrants we care about but then we want to want to give them a new life and a
[02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:37.280]  better future just like just like the countries of Europe did it in the war
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:41.160]  to people fleeing Nazi Germany that's the kind that's the kind of way they
[02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:44.640]  think it's very simplistic they don't think through the consequences they don't
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:52.480]  think through the what's happened in Sweden in in Britain in Belgium where
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:57.720]  you've got these ghettos of people who do not want to integrate who want to
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:03.040]  destroy their house country well that's what it comes down to is there's an
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:07.240]  attempt or they can wreck what was ever left to the Renaissance order they can
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:10.840]  bring in complete tyranny and I think we need to realize that most these people
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:14.360]  that are grassroots mean well but they're on a power trip through the system
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:18.000]  but the people at the top consciously know they're taking over I mean I think
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:24.240]  that's overwhelmingly obvious yeah I think that the West actually Western
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:28.640]  civilization has got a death wish I think we've grown soft I think we no
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:33.400]  longer defend our values we no longer even understand what our values are I
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:36.960]  mean look at the stuff that's going on at at Mizzou at the moment all this stuff
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:41.200]  about all this stuff that students are obsessed with about about cisgender and
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:46.220]  about rape culture these are all kind of invented kids fantasies they've got
[02:27:46.220 --> 02:27:49.880]  nothing to do it's like buggy men statistically it's total mental illness
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:56.000]  it it what it is it is but what but these are all signs and I think of an
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.680]  intellectually weak decadent society we've forgotten what it is that really
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:04.520]  matters and that is the problem that and so inevitably we're going to get
[02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:09.320]  exploited by much much harder cultures like fundamentalist Islam that's it
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:13.480]  which which which know what what they do stand for and they very much do have a
[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:18.000]  will to win that's it we've had our culture to put we remove we've been
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:21.760]  turned into griping sissies that just fight with each other all day and then
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:28.440]  here come in dark-aged cultures with swords conquering us yeah it's the
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:33.320]  Roman Empire didn't last forever and it is not written that our empire we've
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:37.200]  we've been through the Enlightenment we've been through you know we've had
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:40.760]  Judeo-Christian civilization we've created this but we've created the best
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:45.320]  culture culture the world has ever seen but I think that since the war it's
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:49.800]  it's been in decline I think people have forgotten what it what it is that
[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:54.600]  about our culture that makes it special I agree it was Victor Hugo that said
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:58.880]  prosperity you know basically makes monsters adversity makes men and it's
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:02.200]  almost like going on a Mars mission you have no gravity so you can't walk once
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:05.680]  you get there I think we've had it so good that we've just turned into jellyfish
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:12.520]  and this is just a natural cycle I fear so I let's hope it's not the kind of
[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:19.040]  the final down wave I hope that I mean you there have always been periods of
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:24.760]  history where people have needed to be forcibly reminded with that their
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:28.520]  civilization is worth fighting for I mean it happened in World War two Britain
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:32.080]  Britain was quite sort of absolutely we could bounce back but only if some of us

[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:22.080]  drones will deliver the weapons to al-qaeda they will commit the crimes and
[02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:25.720]  blame them on others this is the end of free will the rise of the
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:30.200]  technocracy stop the technologies bad it's that it's in the hands of the few
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:36.160]  and it's been designed and bent and twisted to their will I want to go to
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:44.960]  Mayam and Paul and Eli and James and justice and others that are patiently
[02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:55.000]  holding justice is a cool name that's a they must ain't son's name big tough

[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:04.840]  musician I don't know why I'm going off into that one now I just never see that
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:08.560]  name oh but electors really sweet as well say how do those folks with
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:13.840]  Christmas coming to give them a call but I digress David Knight is coming up the
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:19.760]  draft for the COP 21 agreement has two options you'll be breaking down the
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:23.680]  fourth hour so what they're pushing for one will have a rigid enforcement
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:26.920]  mechanism that will require global governance and taxation this is the
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:30.840]  option that Obama's pushing both options have massive transfer of wealth and
[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:34.040]  technology via large green companies those are the fronts where they get
[02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:39.000]  money themselves like the ones unveiled by Bill Gates yesterday we'll look at the
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.320]  history of Obama's crony capitalism and the last three billion failure that went
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:47.840]  bust on the eve of the climate summit we'll also look at geoengineering is
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:51.480]  making headlines with proposals for a fake volcano they're just getting you
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:55.400]  ready to unveil what they're already doing with the jet aircraft that's all
[02:35:55.400 --> 02:36:01.000]  coming up I want to get to Ted Cruz his overwhelming majority of violent
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.840]  criminals or Democrats well that's actually true I mean if you look at the
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:11.240]  statistics the voting records the donation records the claim by Obama
[02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:14.400]  they're building Homeland Security for gun owners conservatives libertarians
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:18.080]  and Christians he's like saying they're building Homeland Security because the
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:23.160]  Amish are doing bad stuff Amish have probably the lowest crime rate in this
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:28.040]  country you can look it up everybody knows veterans conservatives libertarians
[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:33.320]  have super low crime rates you know we're the folks that can make our own
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:40.840]  money have our own business want to be left alone you know those people wouldn't
[02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:43.720]  be caught dead in the government job and look I'm not knocking people got
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:46.360]  government jobs there are a lot of good people in there and a lot of stuff that
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:51.800]  goes on but it's too big it's out of control and a hundred million people on
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:57.480]  some form of welfare that's a third the country this is about control and he's
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:00.320]  absolutely right and this is the rhetoric right back of these people
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:06.000]  they're howling mobs of criminals I mean look at their main constituents are
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.120]  40 million illegal aliens from all over the world that they're actually but
[02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:12.320]  hurt think everything should be free that there's not enough free running
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:19.120]  our own complaining when we're the most open if America was a prostitute we're
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:24.320]  seeing about 5,000 John's a day for free I mean I had to use a gross analogy but
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:30.680]  I mean we are the biggest whore the world ever saw we're being whored out we're a
[02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:34.160]  joke drug around by our hair by the government that's a pimp that puts
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:38.960]  cigarettes out on us and man I don't like this pimp and I don't like being
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:43.720]  pimped out I mean I know they sell body parts here in Austin I know as a tax

[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:58.640]  involved in it that's not some weird guilt trip man I know when something's
[02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:05.920]  bad I know I feel it I I get a feeling inside I just I just can't stand it I'm

[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:47.360]  support bringing in refugees then refuse to house any refugees Paul Joseph
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:51.800]  Watson virtue signaling leftists are actually less charitable than
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:56.440]  conservatives you know they're the opposite of collectivists they say
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:58.840]  they're collectivists they think you're getting somebody else's stuff that's
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:02.720]  called being a thief if you're a real collectivist you're an individual but
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:06.200]  then you collectively fight for freedom because you get really threatened by
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:11.200]  stuff like this you don't just virtue signal oh I'm nice bring in anybody who
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:17.600]  wants to and everything's free you explain that stealing that's not good you
[02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:22.960]  explain it's a fraud but they virtue signal and they found that particularly
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:27.040]  white liberals are six times more likely to rob to steal and to not give
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:32.360]  money and charity they have British and Canadian studies and I want to sing a
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:37.360]  lot whites but let me tell you they are a sickening nasty group of people they're
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:43.000]  just six sneaky followers and they'll sit around you know saying support stuff
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:46.840]  on Facebook all day to look good in front of people not to actually give
[02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:50.280]  money anybody who really gives money to charity knows you don't want to talk
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:55.920]  about it the real enjoyment is nobody knows the real enjoyment is you really
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:42:01.560]  help people it almost ruins it if people know how I learned that in high

[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:30.880]  video New York liberals are outraged at more than a half of the nation's
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:35.600]  governor saying no to an Obama administration plan to accept a hundred
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:39.840]  thousand refugees but want to ask if they would personally house a refugee
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:44.480]  almost all refused to now I'm not mad at my reporters they do a great job but I've
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:47.920]  been saying I want my reporters to go out and do this and I'm gonna go out two
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:52.960]  people's houses and say do you support Obama wanting governors to take the
[02:42:52.960 --> 02:42:57.200]  refugees for Obama they're gonna say of course they do I'm gonna say okay well
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:43:00.600]  I'm gonna move five refugees into your house they're gonna say get off my
[02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:07.680]  porch well it's been done folks and here it is half of the governors in our
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:10.760]  United States so that they don't want to take in Syrian refugees have you heard
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:15.720]  that yeah what do you think about it I think they all like to go read the
[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:20.720]  Statue of Liberty do you think we should take refugees into this country of
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:27.800]  course everyone in this country has been a refugee email address we're
[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:31.080]  collecting email addresses to sign people up for taking them into their
[02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:37.680]  homes you got a fat pad or what no I'm a I'm a super former okay but you got you
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:42.360]  know back it up 10 seconds please that's not true not everybody the
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:46.320]  company's refugee but a lot of us were okay and when you got here you didn't
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:49.600]  get anything free and you had to set the Statue of Liberty for three months to
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:54.560]  make sure you didn't have TB or black plague but by the way the Statue of
[02:43:54.560 --> 02:44:01.280]  Liberty was originally a Muslim peasant woman Egypt had bought it wearing
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:06.360]  the hijab I'm not kidding a hood overhead this is so proper and that's what
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:10.280]  people always said it's a it's a man and drag it is a woman I mean I knew this
[02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:16.040]  and I'd forgotten and here I was reading it it's an info wars.com story
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:21.400]  Statue of Liberty was originally a Muslim peasant woman the French concept
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:26.800]  more from a gigantic female fella the Smithsonian has confirmed Lady Liberty
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:31.160]  was originally designed as a Muslim peasant woman the colossal neoclassic
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:35.200]  sculpture was indeed to stand at the northern terminus of the Suarez canal
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:39.760]  in Egypt but after it was the decided that a lighthouse would be placed there
[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:48.040]  instead the French designer re-proposed the statue to New York Harbor and so
[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:50.840]  there you go let's scroll down and show what it should have been I think it
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:58.360]  should be a woman in a headdress with a suicide bomb on her maybe sorry it's so
[02:44:58.360 --> 02:45:02.240]  ridiculous they're not bringing any Shiites or any Christians in that have
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:06.120]  actually been killed they're bringing Sunnis in that invaded Syria they got
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:14.080]  their butts kicked I mean what a joke and yes I judge cultures I don't think a
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:17.520]  woman having to cover her face is good and I'm certainly not gonna be bullied
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:21.840]  into my daughter's wearing it I know I'm an oppressor of women but that's just
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:26.400]  how it is now let's go ahead and go back to the idiots in New York here it is
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:30.840]  it's time people up for taking them into their homes you got a fat pad or what
[02:45:30.840 --> 02:45:37.200]  no I'm a super former okay but you still got you know running water I mean I
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:42.680]  mean I got it so you think that we should take the refugees absolutely all
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:48.840]  right give us your email you're signing up to house some refugees that's what
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:52.760]  we need I'm not gonna be able to do that would you be willing to take one into

[02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:27.920]  loss not a conservative everyone wants you to be very scared of them I don't
[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:33.120]  understand why you're not scared why should I be scared I tell you yeah I
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:37.720]  could tell this is all indeed you don't think we should take refugees in you
[02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:41.960]  think we should go there and kick ice this is that I think we should go there
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:48.360]  and you know get the refugees homes back that's what we should do right wouldn't
[02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:53.800]  that be nice guys actually she I buzz them why can't they just go home all right
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:57.760]  folks let's continue now let's go to Ted Cruz and we're gonna your calls up to
[02:46:57.760 --> 02:47:01.200]  that overwhelming majority of violent criminals or Democrats
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:08.360]  Michael Phelan info wars.com and this is speaking on the Hugh Hewitt show he's
[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:11.960]  actually telling the truth it sounds outrageous but it's true the vast
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:15.400]  majority of criminals are Democrats including the 40 million illegal aliens
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:18.360]  that came here illegally and again I'm not against them all individually but I
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:23.920]  can't go to their countries China Mexico you know you name it and just get
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:28.080]  everything free it's pure bull let's go ahead and go to this club and before I
[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:32.240]  switch to the 2016 race I have been doing pro-life events for 25 years I've
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:36.600]  probably done more than a hundred of them I have never met not once a single
[02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:41.040]  pro-life activist who is in favor of violence of any sort have you senator
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:47.800]  Cruz I have not and I would note that this whole episode has really displayed
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:54.000]  the ugly underbelly of the media you know every time you have some sort of
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:59.840]  violent crime or mass killing you can almost see the media salivating hoping
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:04.600]  hoping desperately that the murderer happens to be a Republican so they can
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:09.720]  use it to try to paint their political enemy now listen here's the simple and
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:15.040]  undeniable fact the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:19.880]  Democrats the media doesn't report that what what they report and there's a
[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:25.000]  reason why the Democrats for years have been viewed as soft on crime because they
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:30.080]  go in and they point to the bench judges who release violent criminals they go
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:34.600]  in and they do what Barack Obama tried to do which is a point a lawyer who
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:38.800]  voluntarily that's right that's enough you can see the whole clever here the
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:43.520]  whole clip and enforce calm but it's a fact they cater to criminality they
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:49.440]  cater to overthrow they cater to destabilization and the Republicans are
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:52.560]  horrible as well but just nothing like the Democrats and the Democrats have
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:49:00.560]  really really gone to seed here I'm gonna go to Maya I'm gonna go to Eli I'm
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:04.080]  gonna go to Paul Justin James and get to all of you before I end the baton
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:09.000]  today at night in the fourth hour today let's go ahead and talk to Maya in
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:15.840]  Kansas thanks for holding yeah hi thanks yeah I totally agree not only is it
[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:21.480]  known that most of the crime whether it's on a political level or just
[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:28.080]  individual it's usually coming from a liberal liberal space I would also say
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:33.120]  that a lot of what's happening here is coming from a high number of
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:40.960]  intellectuals okay who've been taught in liberal colleges how to irritate
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:46.120]  confuse and create all types of chaos oh yeah they play mind games and they mess
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:50.720]  with their students they totally jacked their brains it's called shock and awe
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:56.080]  that's all it is plain shock and awe we they drop a bomb over here and we all
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:50:00.400]  look this way and then while they're doing that they drop a bomb someplace else
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:05.760]  it's all part of the disc desensitization and what's really scary about it is
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:09.800]  that those of us who work for a living we're all running and scrambling and
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:13.920]  trying to make sure we've got cover that we've got what we need in order to
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:19.640]  survive all of this and you know what do we do now I mean with you're right
[02:50:19.640 --> 02:50:24.240]  when society unravels which it's starting to worldwide these spoiled rotten
[02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:28.400]  brats are gonna get chewed up by all of us that actually know how to take care
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:34.400]  of ourselves I mean they are absolutely hopeless yeah what do we do now though I
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:39.280]  mean all of a sudden now we know what's going on with the global situation do we
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:43.920]  continue putting for what money into 401k no I hear you and that's what will
[02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:47.280]  cause it really to go down is when the good hard-working people of every race
[02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:51.880]  color-created religion figure out it's all a scam and stop producing you have
[02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:55.600]  the fall of the Soviet Union you have the fall of the system that's that that's
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:51:01.160]  what's coming and then the real crime is that's not slaving something just happened
[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:04.920]  that is explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has
[02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:09.640]  sold out in many areas of the country it caught me totally by surprise and it
[02:51:09.640 --> 02:51:15.240]  involves FEMA I can believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof revealing their
[02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:19.160]  secret could land me in hot water but I think you deserve to know exactly what

[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:33.400]  my question was has World War two already started or World War three to be
[02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:39.760]  exact with the 9-11 thing that happened that took us to war in the Middle East
[02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:46.040]  and it's it's happening my brother it's happening you're right it is a world
[02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:51.480]  war incrementally country by country by proxy war by economic war the Pentagon
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:55.320]  called the Cold War World War three so they are calling this the beginnings of
[02:54:55.320 --> 02:54:59.320]  World War four but the general public doesn't use that terminology so I kind
[02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:04.400]  of use both terms but the world is escalating into unparalleled conflict top
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:07.800]  generals are saying that I mean people you know we're not fear mongering here
[02:55:07.800 --> 02:55:11.400]  we're really telling you what's going on then Obama makes statements last year
[02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:16.480]  about the world's never been more stable since he got in and then he's involved
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:21.480]  with Hillary in massive criminal destabilization it's just unprecedented

[02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:55.120]  different looking plants from the same seed the way I look at it oh I agree the
[02:57:55.120 --> 02:57:59.320]  Republican leadership is bad they at least say some good stuff but we've
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:02.280]  got a chance to take up with the Republican Party that's their main
[02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:06.440]  defense they're worried about that because they they can be taken over the

[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:30.280]  first 2015 I'm David Knight your host I'm gonna go back to your calls in just
[03:00:30.280 --> 03:00:32.480]  one moment I want to give people a quick overview of what we're going to be
[03:00:32.480 --> 03:00:37.000]  talking about of course there's been a lot of articles talking about the lavish
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:41.920]  lifestyles the champagne dreams and caviar wishes it was that how Archibald
[03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:45.480]  what was that guy's name I can't remember they that that phrase just came up
[03:00:45.480 --> 03:00:50.320]  anyway the way they're spending massive amounts of money on their dinners on
[03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:55.040]  their plane flights using massive amounts of energy as they complain to us
[03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:59.520]  about eating our homes and cooking on our barbecue grills what you need to
[03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:02.800]  understand about this is what I think we ought to start calling crony
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:08.400]  climatism we all know what crony capitalism is and what crony
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:14.200]  climatism is doing is creating these phony green companies one of which went
[03:01:14.200 --> 03:01:19.040]  belly up the very day before this conference began and we're not talking
[03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:21.800]  about that enough we need to talk about what happened with that one particular
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:26.520]  company three billion dollars that sucked out of taxpayers just in the
[03:01:26.520 --> 03:01:30.960]  United States they need to understand that in addition to global governance
[03:01:30.960 --> 03:01:34.520]  that they're trying to establish creating an enforcement mechanism and of
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:37.840]  course there's there's two options on the plate here as we've seen from the
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:44.080]  early draft releases of this climate summit that's going on in Paris the two
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:48.600]  options are that they you know just kind of nudge people on they set up their
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:52.960]  goals and edge people long and then they transfer technology to the developing
[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:57.880]  countries it's going to be nice and green and carbon-free the other approach
[03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:01.520]  is that they're going to have teeth in this that are enforceable and that is
[03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:05.880]  what Obama is coming out and talking about today he's saying we want to have
[03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:09.840]  an enforcement mechanism well if you're gonna have an enforcement mechanism
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:14.360]  you're going to have a an international bureaucracy an international governance
[03:02:14.360 --> 03:02:18.880]  that is going to go along with that international taxation to make this all
[03:02:18.880 --> 03:02:22.120]  work because that's the way they're going to operate this but either way and
[03:02:22.120 --> 03:02:28.040]  either these options there's a massive transfer of technology and money that
[03:02:28.040 --> 03:02:31.880]  goes with it because it's all got to be paid for by somebody that's all going to
[03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:36.120]  be a massive transfer of technology and money from developed countries to
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:40.840]  undeveloped countries so we're going to have our industry shut down we're going
[03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:44.600]  to have our income capabilities shut down meanwhile our wealth is
[03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:47.920]  simultaneously going to be transferred to other countries at the same time and
[03:02:47.920 --> 03:02:52.200]  it's all going to be filtered through the sticky hands of the same group of
[03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:56.400]  crony capitalists that are always there the Al Gore's the Bill Gates Bill Gates
[03:02:56.400 --> 03:03:00.480]  has a proposal where he's putting himself at the center of a venture capital
[03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:05.080]  organization he's going to put some seed money in it he's worked up with 20
[03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:09.360]  different countries how he's going to do this understand this is all flowing to
[03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:12.880]  these people and know how this is going to work we've seen this in microcosm in
[03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:18.480]  the United States with Obama's green failures there were over 36 of them
[03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:22.640]  quite a while ago and now we've just had one of the biggest ones fall the day
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:27.360]  before this nonsense begins and understand again as I repeated there are
[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:32.960]  two options on the table one of them is going to have a real hard enforcement
[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:36.600]  mechanism and associated with it but both of them are going to be transferring
[03:03:36.600 --> 03:03:41.040]  your money your freedoms your income your wealth they're going to be
[03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:45.120]  transferring that to other countries India is not happy about it they're
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:50.480]  calling it carbon imperialism and said well you know we're going to have our
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:56.040]  future decided by this international body and yeah that's right India and
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:59.280]  Russia are the only two countries complaining about that now India is
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:01.600]  complaining about it say we don't think we're getting a fair deal we're not
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:05.880]  getting enough money well I don't think we're getting a fair deal either okay
[03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:09.960]  because this isn't being done in the interest of the United States taxpayer
[03:04:09.960 --> 03:04:13.920]  the United States citizen this is being done in the interest of the cloney
[03:04:13.920 --> 03:04:19.160]  capitalist who are working with Obama that's what what they're doing with this
[03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:22.240]  so it really is a kind of crony climatism that they're that they're
[03:04:22.240 --> 03:04:26.480]  pushing on this let's go quickly to some of your calls let's go to Tim and
[03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:30.640]  Wyoming Alex was talking to you ran out of time go ahead and finish up
[03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:35.240]  hi David thanks for taking my call now I was talking about the the the
[03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:40.800]  republics and democrats basically growing from the same seed but you
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:45.080]  sometimes sometimes a plant will crawl along the ground and sometimes it'll
[03:04:45.080 --> 03:04:48.560]  wrap around something and sometimes it'll just go into a shrub but it'll
[03:04:48.560 --> 03:04:52.080]  still be the same plan hang on time I'm gonna let you finish that on the other

[03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:05.720]  political correctness brainwashing is a kindergarten class in captain Johnston
[03:05:05.720 --> 03:05:09.240]  Blakely elementary school in Washington State teacher Karen Keller is on a
[03:05:09.240 --> 03:05:12.640]  quest to indoctrinate her class with the mindlessness of gender equality by
[03:05:12.640 --> 03:05:16.560]  banning boys from using Legos that's right she told the Bainbridge Island
[03:05:16.560 --> 03:05:20.240]  review I always tell the boys you're gonna have a turn and I'm like yeah when
[03:05:20.240 --> 03:05:23.720]  hell freezes over in my head I tell them you'll have a turn because I don't with
[03:05:23.720 --> 03:05:27.600]  them to feel bad she started this exercise in futility because boys were
[03:05:27.600 --> 03:05:31.760]  flocking to the colorful blocks during their free choice playtime while girls
[03:05:31.760 --> 03:05:35.840]  tended to play with dolls or crayons she tried using pink and purple Legos to
[03:05:35.840 --> 03:05:39.360]  attract the girl students but she found that ineffective so that led to an
[03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:43.720]  outright ban for boys Keller defense her actions by saying they're fair because
[03:05:43.720 --> 03:05:47.280]  she's giving different students the tools they need to succeed wonder why
[03:05:47.280 --> 03:05:50.200]  there's such a control freak attitude in Bainbridge Island we'll take a short

[03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:10.640]  different we've run out of time two more two times before this when you tried to
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:16.080]  make your point go ahead well thank you thank you now the the comment I was
[03:10:16.080 --> 03:10:20.320]  making was basically that we see when we see that the two parties that look
[03:10:20.320 --> 03:10:24.760]  somewhat different from one another but you we just have to realize okay Ivy
[03:10:24.760 --> 03:10:28.920]  will grow on the ground sometimes it'll wrap around a fence sometimes it'll go
[03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:33.280]  all the way up a tree and strangle the tree but it's the same plan that
[03:10:33.280 --> 03:10:37.200]  basically that's what I think of the two parties as there are two supposed two
[03:10:37.200 --> 03:10:41.840]  parties which are really one party just joined at the hip if you will or what
[03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:46.240]  you have the one brain yeah yeah we have a single party in Washington we really do
[03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:50.240]  and the reality of it is is that you can look and at the bottom you can see
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:54.000]  people who who are not involved in the leadership of the two parties you can see
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:59.120]  them surfacing occasionally you know the Ron Paul's a Dennis Kucinich we just
[03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:03.440]  had a a Democrat representative a female from Hawaii I can't recall her name and
[03:11:03.440 --> 03:11:06.760]  she was pushing back against this war on Syria so you know we see what you're
[03:11:06.760 --> 03:11:09.600]  doing here we understand that you're running this you're we understand you're
[03:11:09.600 --> 03:11:13.240]  running you're funding it and we want you to stop this I mean she's speaking
[03:11:13.240 --> 03:11:16.440]  truth to power that will happen in Congress occasion we've got Walter Jones a
[03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:20.360]  good example on the Republican side but for the most part when you look at the
[03:11:20.360 --> 03:11:24.840]  people at the top they're all working towards the same agenda and we can see
[03:11:24.840 --> 03:11:28.400]  this whether it comes to a climate change and these other aspects or whether
[03:11:28.400 --> 03:11:32.520]  it comes to the Trans Pacific transatlantic partnerships they're all
[03:11:32.520 --> 03:11:36.400]  trying to concentrate power into Washington they really are on the same
[03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:40.000]  page even when they talk about something where there's a real fundamental
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:44.160]  difference to their constituents something like abortion nothing ever
[03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:48.200]  changes it doesn't change when you elect Republicans or Democrats it just
[03:11:48.200 --> 03:11:52.560]  keeps on plugging away doing what it was doing before about abortion so even on
[03:11:52.560 --> 03:11:56.560]  some of those issues where there is a distinction between them it just keeps
[03:11:56.560 --> 03:12:00.480]  going but we've seen over and over again we elected a Republican majority just
[03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:05.080]  recently what did we see we saw that we got the same open borders that people
[03:12:05.080 --> 03:12:09.000]  were concerned about we saw crony capitalism nothing done about that the
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:14.520]  Tea Party was upset about the bailouts and what is going on with this climate
[03:12:14.520 --> 03:12:18.080]  conferences that's in Paris as I point out the last segment it is nothing but
[03:12:18.080 --> 03:12:23.000]  crony capitalism they're going to fund a massive transfer of wealth and
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:26.520]  technology to developing countries and it's all going to be funneled through
[03:12:26.520 --> 03:12:32.400]  these preferred individuals like Bill Gates like George Soros like we've seen
[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:35.440]  in the past that's precisely what's going to happen and we've seen them
[03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:41.360]  failing left and right in the US they can't even get started unless they get
[03:12:41.360 --> 03:12:44.920]  massive subsidies from the government and it doesn't go anywhere so yeah there
[03:12:44.920 --> 03:12:48.280]  are there is a single party and the reason why we see that single party of
[03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:53.040]  course Tim is because they're both being funded and supported by the same
[03:12:53.040 --> 03:12:57.160]  crony capitalist at the top who want a global governance that's precisely what
[03:12:57.160 --> 03:13:00.960]  this is all about the same people who negotiate these trade deals these so-called
[03:13:00.960 --> 03:13:06.800]  trade deals they do it in secret and they won't let the elected representatives
[03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:11.480]  see it at all and it we didn't see the agreement until after a month after it
[03:13:11.480 --> 03:13:15.120]  was passed and then they give us this massive agreement so pointed out many
[03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:21.520]  times it was I think it was four times the collected works of JRR Tolkien four
[03:13:21.520 --> 03:13:25.600]  times the size of Shakespeare I think it was three or four times the size of the
[03:13:25.600 --> 03:13:30.520]  King James Bible it's a massive legal document you can't pour through that
[03:13:30.520 --> 03:13:33.040]  thing in the amount of time they're going to have to vote on it I think it's
[03:13:33.040 --> 03:13:35.840]  going to come up for a quick vote during the holiday season when nobody's
[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:38.880]  looking they're going to ram this thing through just like they do other
[03:13:38.880 --> 03:13:43.200]  legislation of its type things like the Federal Reserve Act that they did a
[03:13:43.200 --> 03:13:46.840]  little over a hundred years ago did that the same way so that's what we're
[03:13:46.840 --> 03:13:49.800]  going to see it's these people who are truly running the government and if you
[03:13:49.800 --> 03:13:54.160]  have any question about it then you have to ask yourself how could they gag and
[03:13:54.160 --> 03:14:00.880]  and bind the hands and the mouths of our congressional representatives about
[03:14:00.880 --> 03:14:04.760]  this telling them they could take a peek at it but they couldn't talk about it
[03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:08.600]  the only one who had the courage to do that was Senator Sessions and good for
[03:14:08.600 --> 03:14:11.800]  him and nobody listened to him quite frankly unfortunately thank you Tim
[03:14:11.800 --> 03:14:16.280]  let's go to someone who's on the phone from Africa Patriot and Africa go
[03:14:16.280 --> 03:14:24.480]  ahead hey David they are calling in from the Zambia and my country is up to 14
[03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:30.520]  hour power cuts daily so globalization has really given us a nice little treat
[03:14:30.520 --> 03:14:35.160]  here and you mentioned in Bill Gates before and he's always in the media every
[03:14:35.160 --> 03:14:41.640]  couple of months shooting his mouth off about how he's afraid of a plague or when
[03:14:41.640 --> 03:14:45.560]  we know that they have bioweapons which they just can't wait to release on
[03:14:45.560 --> 03:14:51.200]  the ground and get your thought tonight yes yes well you know when we we saw
[03:14:51.200 --> 03:14:54.520]  the outbreak of Ebola that happened around Sierra Leone the Sierra Leone
[03:14:54.520 --> 03:14:59.000]  government believed that and shut it down and told the people to leave it was
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:02.880]  the Tuskegee Institute that was there in Sierra Leone they said you either let
[03:15:02.880 --> 03:15:07.360]  this out by careless handling or you deliberately did this as an experiment
[03:15:07.360 --> 03:15:10.840]  that's where it started we had John Rappaport talked about that when it
[03:15:10.840 --> 03:15:14.880]  happened at the same time they said oh no you know we're we're professionals we
[03:15:14.880 --> 03:15:18.720]  would never let this thing slip out what did we see a few months later we saw at
[03:15:18.720 --> 03:15:23.400]  the National Primate Center here in America in Louisiana right there with
[03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:27.080]  Tulane University running that again same university same people who were
[03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:32.120]  involved in the Tuskegee experiments withholding treatment from black people
[03:15:32.120 --> 03:15:37.680]  who had syphilis letting that go for decades showing absolutely no regard
[03:15:37.680 --> 03:15:41.720]  whatsoever no more regard for human life than we saw in the Nazi concentration
[03:15:41.720 --> 03:15:44.960]  camps from Joseph Mengele that same University Tulane which is running the
[03:15:44.960 --> 03:15:48.800]  National Primate Center had brought in a deadly virus they were using it as a
[03:15:48.800 --> 03:15:52.800]  gain of function experiment as select agents doesn't that say something when
[03:15:52.800 --> 03:15:56.720]  the Center for Disease Control talks about these deadly viruses that are not
[03:15:56.720 --> 03:16:02.080]  indigenous to our country they talk about them as select agents and they
[03:16:02.080 --> 03:16:06.000]  bring them in for gain of function experiments what they're doing is they're
[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:10.360]  making them more deadly when once you contract it you have a higher chance of
[03:16:10.360 --> 03:16:13.040]  dying and they make it more easily transmissible so they're doing these
[03:16:13.040 --> 03:16:17.320]  experiments and this escape from a biosafety level 3 lab and got into the
[03:16:17.320 --> 03:16:23.320]  wild and this particular bacteria is Berkhold Berkholdiria pseudomalei this
[03:16:23.320 --> 03:16:27.640]  this lives in the soil it spreads in the soil so they've done that to our country
[03:16:27.640 --> 03:16:31.440]  here as well a patriot in Africa that we've seen that same sort of thing and
[03:16:31.440 --> 03:16:36.760]  we know what they're doing you're talking about did you say 14 power brown
[03:16:36.760 --> 03:16:42.760]  outs that you're having a day we have 14 hours daily wow that's amazing
[03:16:42.760 --> 03:16:46.920]  14 hours daily yeah well you see that's the whole issue they're telling us that
[03:16:46.920 --> 03:16:51.000]  this is all being done to out of compassion for the poor I'm gonna have
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:55.080]  someone on tomorrow who is going to take a very different tack than the Pope has
[03:16:55.080 --> 03:16:59.200]  taken the Pope says well we have a moral case that we need to essentially shut
[03:16:59.200 --> 03:17:03.720]  down power that we need to transfer technology and material to the developing
[03:17:03.720 --> 03:17:08.880]  countries and of course you know you're there in Africa you are I'm sure you know
[03:17:08.880 --> 03:17:13.320]  that once we say we're going to transfer technology to help you out to put solar
[03:17:13.320 --> 03:17:18.200]  panels there so that you can can get clean energy you know that that money is
[03:17:18.200 --> 03:17:22.080]  not really going to go to the people of Africa right you know that it's going to
[03:17:22.080 --> 03:17:25.920]  go into the pockets of Bill Gates yeah yeah and the government the corrupt
[03:17:25.920 --> 03:17:28.960]  government officials that are there the corrupt corporations that are in
[03:17:28.960 --> 03:17:32.400]  alliance with them so it's really not going to help the people and and we're
[03:17:32.400 --> 03:17:34.960]  going to talk to someone tomorrow who's going to say you know the really the
[03:17:34.960 --> 03:17:39.920]  moral case is that we need to help people we need to help them build their
[03:17:39.920 --> 03:17:45.800]  economies and we don't have to make a choice between power that is readily
[03:17:45.800 --> 03:17:49.880]  available and cheap and power that is dirty you know that's not that that's
[03:17:49.880 --> 03:17:54.200]  not the you know we don't have to have a polluting industry in order to have
[03:17:54.200 --> 03:17:58.840]  industry that's the false dichotomy that they're offering you we have ways to make
[03:17:58.840 --> 03:18:04.120]  coal burn very cleanly but of course you know that's we can't talk about that we
[03:18:04.120 --> 03:18:08.480]  can't talk about recapturing that and so what they're trying to do is they're
[03:18:08.480 --> 03:18:12.480]  imposing austerity and starvation on Africa but they're also going to be
[03:18:12.480 --> 03:18:16.000]  doing it to the first world nations because they're going to be taking away
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:21.880]  our wealth our income capability our production capability in the name of
[03:18:21.880 --> 03:18:25.560]  helping other people but it isn't going to go to the other people it's going to
[03:18:25.560 --> 03:18:29.200]  go to the people in between it's going to go to the crony capitalist it's going
[03:18:29.200 --> 03:18:31.880]  to go to the government officials was there anything else you'd like to say
[03:18:31.880 --> 03:18:39.360]  a patriot in Africa no I agree thought of that UN agenda 21 is just horrible yes
[03:18:39.360 --> 03:18:44.680]  yes and it's this is this whole thing is a UN agenda and you can see that thank
[03:18:44.680 --> 03:18:49.440]  you so much for talking to us you can see that in the in the logo and I sent a
[03:18:49.440 --> 03:18:55.000]  logo to you guys if we take a look at the cop 21 logo you look at it it looks
[03:18:55.000 --> 03:19:00.320]  kind of like a copyright symbol to me when I first saw it and it looked like a
[03:19:00.320 --> 03:19:03.440]  it's all done in blue the UN blue there it is on the screen for those of you
[03:19:03.440 --> 03:19:08.040]  watching of course you can see the UN Laurel leaves around the outside so we
[03:19:08.040 --> 03:19:12.160]  know it's a UN thing we know that's the clue from those Laurel leaves as well as
[03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:16.680]  the color and then they've got the CC there so is that are they copyrighting
[03:19:16.680 --> 03:19:21.160]  technology therefore some people point out the similarity to the comedy
[03:19:21.160 --> 03:19:25.480]  channel unfortunately it basically looks just like that except that they
[03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:30.840]  reverse the outside C and then they put comedy central they put the the other
[03:19:30.840 --> 03:19:35.240]  one upside down I wish it was a joke you know the stuff that they're telling us
[03:19:35.240 --> 03:19:39.880]  that we hear from Prince Charles and others telling us that terrorism is
[03:19:39.880 --> 03:19:42.800]  directly caused by this Prince Charles actually was saying that the
[03:19:42.800 --> 03:19:49.600]  conflict in Syria began as a drought in Syria no it didn't it began with the
[03:19:49.600 --> 03:19:54.160]  United States and Britain and others other NATO countries arming the rebels
[03:19:54.160 --> 03:19:57.160]  that they brought in to overthrow the Syrian government stay with us we'll be
[03:19:57.160 --> 03:19:59.560]  right back with your calls they'll be talking about

[03:23:13.920 --> 03:23:18.200]  need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about staying
[03:23:18.200 --> 03:23:22.480]  warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I keep my
[03:23:22.480 --> 03:23:26.520]  family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem
[03:23:26.520 --> 03:23:31.000]  with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another
[03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:34.880]  concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in
[03:23:34.880 --> 03:23:38.960]  times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers
[03:23:38.960 --> 03:23:43.920]  may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers go to Fortress
[03:23:43.920 --> 03:23:48.280]  clothing dot com again Fortress clothing dot com has the answers to your heat
[03:23:48.280 --> 03:23:53.680]  storage dilemma don't get stuck in the cold Fortress clothing dot com you'll
[03:23:53.680 --> 03:23:56.840]  never be cold again
[03:24:12.480 --> 03:24:16.400]  welcome back to the Alex Jones radio show I'm David Knight your host we're
[03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:20.920]  gonna go to justice and candidate just a moment to talk about the UN court that
[03:24:20.920 --> 03:24:25.240]  they're setting up and of course that is something's been proposed by John
[03:24:25.240 --> 03:24:30.280]  Schellenhuber he's the German climatologist climate science scientist I
[03:24:30.280 --> 03:24:35.280]  use the term scientist loosely because you know what science is about opening
[03:24:35.280 --> 03:24:40.960]  and questioning the data it's about skepticism fundamentally and I don't
[03:24:40.960 --> 03:24:44.600]  like to see this argument from authority I talked about that last night
[03:24:44.600 --> 03:24:48.880]  we've seen this science presented to us and we're told that we have to accept
[03:24:48.880 --> 03:24:53.520]  it because the vast majority of scientists have accepted this the vast
[03:24:53.520 --> 03:24:56.720]  majority of scientists are just listening to other scientists and saying
[03:24:56.720 --> 03:25:00.200]  yeah that sounds plausible to me we've had a lot of scientists who once they
[03:25:00.200 --> 03:25:04.480]  look into the data have said this isn't true as a matter of fact Mark Morano of
[03:25:04.480 --> 03:25:10.440]  climate which is which is a climate depot Mark Morano climate depot has got
[03:25:10.440 --> 03:25:14.760]  a documentary they's putting out based on the scientists who have gone in and
[03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:19.600]  looked at the data looked at the models seen that it doesn't predict this type
[03:25:19.600 --> 03:25:23.240]  of climate activity and reverse their position he's got a documentary is going
[03:25:23.240 --> 03:25:27.600]  to be premiering in Paris in the middle of all this nonsense is going on there
[03:25:27.600 --> 03:25:32.080]  so yeah the client science is never settled that's the nature of science
[03:25:32.080 --> 03:25:36.360]  it should always be open to questioning and yet we see repeatedly that they
[03:25:36.360 --> 03:25:39.880]  will hide the raw data from us they don't want us to see the right day I was
[03:25:39.880 --> 03:25:45.960]  part of a group that was trying to get data from the emails as part of the
[03:25:45.960 --> 03:25:50.560]  climategate emails that were going back and forth between England and some that
[03:25:50.560 --> 03:25:55.480]  were on the American side and we have this professor the guy who created the
[03:25:55.480 --> 03:26:01.440]  hockey stick Michael Mann you know that that Al Gore loved so much he had all
[03:26:01.440 --> 03:26:05.920]  of these emails that he had done on work time working for the University of
[03:26:05.920 --> 03:26:10.640]  Virginia it was part of what he was doing the taxpayers were paying for him
[03:26:10.640 --> 03:26:14.760]  for this research and absolutely refused to show their raw data to let
[03:26:14.760 --> 03:26:19.120]  anybody else draw their own conclusions from the data to see where they
[03:26:19.120 --> 03:26:22.400]  collected the data how they collected the data was their bias in the way they
[03:26:22.400 --> 03:26:25.720]  were collecting the data it was their bias in the way that they summarized it
[03:26:25.720 --> 03:26:30.000]  they went to court to fight that they fought the Attorney General there in
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:34.280]  Virginia and they said no this is proprietary information it's like no
[03:26:34.280 --> 03:26:37.280]  you've already published your findings and your findings are being used to
[03:26:37.280 --> 03:26:41.960]  establish public policy you can't hide behind that anymore and this is something
[03:26:41.960 --> 03:26:46.160]  that you did while the taxpayers were paying you it should be out in the open
[03:26:46.160 --> 03:26:49.360]  and if you're a real scientist you don't have a problem you can stand up to the
[03:26:49.360 --> 03:26:53.920]  scrutiny of other people you invite peer review instead of trying to censor peer
[03:26:53.920 --> 03:26:58.400]  review so we've seen that happening for a long time but of course what is pushing
[03:26:58.400 --> 03:27:03.280]  all of this we have to have a a means to establish global governance we have to
[03:27:03.280 --> 03:27:08.560]  have some kind of a global crisis in order to have government come in and
[03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:12.520]  save us from that global crisis and the aspects of a global government that they
[03:27:12.520 --> 03:27:16.760]  need of course are some kind of regulations a international court
[03:27:16.760 --> 03:27:20.800]  system some kind of a international planetary court which has been proposed
[03:27:20.800 --> 03:27:25.800]  by Schellenhoover who is an advisor to the Pope to Prince Charles to others on
[03:27:25.800 --> 03:27:30.360]  the climate issues and their groups they have to have some kind of a climate
[03:27:30.360 --> 03:27:33.560]  court they have to have some kind of an enforcement mechanism they have to have
[03:27:33.560 --> 03:27:38.640]  some kind of funding a taxation system then of course they're going to have a
[03:27:38.640 --> 03:27:42.680]  military or a police force to enforce this as well that's where this is all
[03:27:42.680 --> 03:27:47.560]  headed this is what this is the basis of I would say to the people who believe
[03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:54.080]  the man-made global warming I would say to those people look at the way they're
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:27:58.520]  shutting your free speech down in Paris I mean they've come after the people who
[03:27:58.520 --> 03:28:02.160]  want the government to do even more I think they're the government is not
[03:28:02.160 --> 03:28:07.200]  doing enough and I would say look at the foolishness of trusting the government
[03:28:07.200 --> 03:28:11.800]  to solve this problem because that's the socialist communist mindset that these
[03:28:11.800 --> 03:28:16.240]  people are coming from look at how these people are dining at these restaurants
[03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:21.600]  you know where they get a $380 minimum per plate cost how they're living this
[03:28:21.600 --> 03:28:27.440]  lavish lifestyle you know I guess when Obama was there they asked him what he
[03:28:27.440 --> 03:28:30.280]  was going to order and he said well I'm gonna leave that up to the French
[03:28:30.280 --> 03:28:33.480]  president he didn't want to make a mistake ordering something you know he
[03:28:33.480 --> 03:28:38.280]  didn't want to have a pate faux pas I guess but you know it really should have
[03:28:38.280 --> 03:28:42.640]  been a faux pas for these guys to live this kind of lavish luxury to tell
[03:28:42.640 --> 03:28:46.400]  people in the streets we don't want to hear your point of view shut up we're
[03:28:46.400 --> 03:28:49.080]  gonna keep the people in the conference a hundred percent safe we're gonna
[03:28:49.080 --> 03:28:52.280]  guarantee a hundred percent security for those attending the conference but the
[03:28:52.280 --> 03:28:57.080]  people on the outside we can't guarantee your safety that's essentially it
[03:28:57.080 --> 03:29:00.560]  they're not going to guarantee anything for you this is all for them this is all
[03:29:00.560 --> 03:29:04.960]  for the elite this is all for the ones who are the puppets of the globalist
[03:29:04.960 --> 03:29:08.880]  elites the ones who are going to get their sticky fingers on all this money
[03:29:08.880 --> 03:29:12.800]  that is going to be transferred at the point of a gun from the industrialized
[03:29:12.800 --> 03:29:15.920]  countries to the undeveloped countries it's not going to help anybody in those
[03:29:15.920 --> 03:29:19.680]  other countries anymore than our involvement in Syria is helping the
[03:29:19.680 --> 03:29:23.400]  people there we come back and go back to your calls we'll go to justice in
[03:29:23.400 --> 03:29:26.480]  Canada first I know you've been hanging on for a long time we want to talk about
[03:29:26.480 --> 03:29:31.640]  this UN Supreme Court because that's really one of the key things that they
[03:29:31.640 --> 03:29:35.000]  want to set up along with the taxation along with the bureaucracy that's what
[03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:37.600]  you have to have when you've got a global government stay with us we'll be right
[03:29:37.600 --> 03:29:39.800]  back
[03:29:48.240 --> 03:29:55.760]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:29:55.760 --> 03:30:03.920]  Hillary used the 9-11 attacks as justification for accepting huge
[03:30:03.920 --> 03:30:08.080]  donations from Wall Street fat cats for a second time this week in an interview
[03:30:08.080 --> 03:30:12.600]  with Charlie Rose Rose asked if Clinton believes she has suffered from the fact
[03:30:12.600 --> 03:30:17.680]  that some say she is too close to Wall Street Clinton shot back so yes do I
[03:30:17.680 --> 03:30:23.080]  know people and did I help rebuild after 9-11 yes I did it seems that Hillary's
[03:30:23.080 --> 03:30:27.320]  default position on the matter is simply to blurt out 9-11 in hopes that people
[03:30:27.320 --> 03:30:31.560]  will drop the subject the fact is that while Clinton preaches about standing
[03:30:31.560 --> 03:30:36.040]  for a lot of regulation on big banks and on the financial services sector and
[03:30:36.040 --> 03:30:40.680]  drones on about wealth inequality she is raking it in from wealthy Wall Street
[03:30:40.680 --> 03:30:45.600]  donors Hillary has received sizable donations from officials representing
[03:30:45.600 --> 03:30:51.040]  but not limited to Morgan Stanley city group Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase

[03:33:15.640 --> 03:33:19.600]  Jones show I'm David Knight and I want to go right away to our caller Justice in
[03:33:19.600 --> 03:33:22.520]  Canada you've been holding for a very long time I apologize but thank you for
[03:33:22.520 --> 03:33:27.640]  holding you want to talk about the UN Universal Supreme Court go ahead. Yes
[03:33:27.640 --> 03:33:34.160]  hello hi Mr. Knight I appreciate finally being able to speak on your show and I
[03:33:34.160 --> 03:33:39.880]  hope that one day I'll be able to speak with Mr. Alex Jones as well I'm the
[03:33:39.880 --> 03:33:44.080]  chief I'm the newly appointed Chief Justice of the Universal Supreme Court
[03:33:44.080 --> 03:33:53.600]  here in the Chilcotin territory in the heart of British Columbia we are I'm
[03:33:53.600 --> 03:33:59.560]  trying to get to you some good news in the whole mess that you guys are fighting
[03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:05.480]  against I do commend you and Alex Jones and everybody on your on your show for
[03:34:05.480 --> 03:34:10.960]  all that you've done over the years we've been following you since 9-11 and I do
[03:34:10.960 --> 03:34:16.040]  applaud everything that you guys have tried to do and I think you guys have
[03:34:16.040 --> 03:34:21.620]  done a tremendous job and we need to keep up the fight and certainly maybe we
[03:34:21.620 --> 03:34:25.120]  can partner together with what we're doing up here in Canada. Well tell me
[03:34:25.120 --> 03:34:28.120]  what the Universal Supreme Court is because when I looked at that I thought
[03:34:28.120 --> 03:34:32.520]  we're talking about the the UN Planetary Council that Schellenhuber and
[03:34:32.520 --> 03:34:35.560]  others have talked about in order to enforce their climate regulations on
[03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:41.200]  us. What is the Universal Supreme Court? State that I believe that the climate
[03:34:41.200 --> 03:34:46.320]  court that they are trying to propose is it in response to the Universal Supreme
[03:34:46.320 --> 03:34:52.160]  Court and I'll explain a little bit more why and I hope that maybe you could
[03:34:52.160 --> 03:34:57.240]  sometime get me on a show where I could expand on on these ideas more fully
[03:34:57.240 --> 03:35:01.440]  because I'm just going to touch on them really briefly and really quickly. The
[03:35:01.440 --> 03:35:08.120]  Universal Supreme Court of the Steelco team that's the USCT has been created
[03:35:08.120 --> 03:35:13.720]  by the Aboriginal people here in the sovereign territory of the Chilcotin. The
[03:35:13.720 --> 03:35:22.160]  Supreme Court of Canada last year in 2014 had come out and admitted that the
[03:35:22.160 --> 03:35:27.520]  Chilcotin people have been a sovereign nation and have never signed a treaty
[03:35:27.520 --> 03:35:33.080]  with Canada and therefore the territory here has always been sovereign. Of
[03:35:33.080 --> 03:35:37.920]  course we haven't been treated as sovereign but the people here are trying
[03:35:37.920 --> 03:35:45.480]  to further their sovereignty and we have been greatly opposed in the process. So
[03:35:45.480 --> 03:35:50.600]  we are the world's best kept secret right now and for good cause because those
[03:35:50.600 --> 03:35:56.160]  people who are out there trying to pull the strings in a fraudulent manner
[03:35:56.160 --> 03:36:02.960]  hurting a lot of citizens of this world are watching what we're doing here and
[03:36:02.960 --> 03:36:08.360]  they know that we are anti everything that they are doing. Well let me ask you
[03:36:08.360 --> 03:36:10.680]  a question since you're talking about a court system. What do you think about
[03:36:10.680 --> 03:36:14.440]  jury nullification and in the government court systems that we have right now? I
[03:36:14.440 --> 03:36:19.640]  know we have a long tradition of that going back to English common law and we
[03:36:19.640 --> 03:36:24.160]  both share that tradition in Canada and the United States where juries
[03:36:24.160 --> 03:36:27.400]  had the ultimate say so where they could judge the laws and not just the facts
[03:36:27.400 --> 03:36:33.640]  of the cases but we are routinely lied to and intimidated by judges, attorneys
[03:36:33.640 --> 03:36:38.000]  who try to appeal to this, get into a lot of trouble with the bar. So that's the
[03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:42.680]  sad case that we have right now. I think that's one of the key tools of
[03:36:42.680 --> 03:36:45.480]  power they're not being used by the American people right now and that's
[03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:50.600]  their power as a jury. Just one person out of 12, an 8% solution could shut
[03:36:50.600 --> 03:36:54.720]  down tyranny at the federal, the state or the local level by saying we're not
[03:36:54.720 --> 03:36:57.280]  going to convict our fellow citizens and we've seen this kind of thing happen
[03:36:57.280 --> 03:37:00.280]  during alcohol prohibition. We've seen it to some degree during drug prohibition.
[03:37:00.280 --> 03:37:04.160]  Do you have anything like that? What do you think about jury nullification in
[03:37:04.160 --> 03:37:09.000]  Canada? Is there any any movement in Canada to establish that? Well I do have a
[03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:14.000]  lot of thoughts on that topic but right now I think it's more important that I
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:18.960]  tell you a little bit more about what we can do for you in the bigger picture. For
[03:37:18.960 --> 03:37:25.680]  example, if you go on our website it's theuniversalsupremecourt.org and I'll
[03:37:25.680 --> 03:37:31.480]  say that again, universalsupremecourt.org. You will find there are laws, our
[03:37:31.480 --> 03:37:39.360]  Constitution of the Chilcotin Nation and the Universal Supreme Court Act. I'm
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:42.120]  going to kind of leave it at that. You've got the website out there. I'll let
[03:37:42.120 --> 03:37:44.920]  people investigate that. We don't really have time to go into depth on it and
[03:37:44.920 --> 03:37:47.960]  it's going to be a hard thing to do on the radio but I appreciate you hanging
[03:37:47.960 --> 03:37:51.040]  on and letting us know about that and people can go to that website and
[03:37:51.040 --> 03:37:54.480]  and check that out. And I'm going to go to some of the other callers that are on
[03:37:54.480 --> 03:37:58.400]  here but before I do I want to lay out some of the issues that I think are
[03:37:58.400 --> 03:38:02.360]  really behind this crony climatism that we've got going on. It really is Wall
[03:38:02.360 --> 03:38:06.360]  Street greenwashing. And the people who support this on the left, you understand,
[03:38:06.360 --> 03:38:10.120]  they always come up with a way to sell global governance to you that's
[03:38:10.120 --> 03:38:17.680]  going to fit into your pair time. Excuse me, I had to cough struggling with a
[03:38:17.680 --> 03:38:21.440]  cough here. They're going to sell it to you if you're on the left. They know that
[03:38:21.440 --> 03:38:25.960]  you care about global warming. You've been that you bought into that or you
[03:38:25.960 --> 03:38:28.960]  know that's my point of view. I don't believe it at all but nevertheless
[03:38:28.960 --> 03:38:32.560]  people on left care about that so they will say this is a global problem. We
[03:38:32.560 --> 03:38:36.640]  need to solve this with global governance. On the right they want to bring
[03:38:36.640 --> 03:38:39.560]  in what they think is free trade and of course we know these trade agreements are
[03:38:39.560 --> 03:38:43.120]  nothing at all like free trade. People on the left many of them understand that.
[03:38:43.120 --> 03:38:47.800]  So you need to understand that this is not about helping the environment. This
[03:38:47.800 --> 03:38:51.560]  is about corporate greenwashing for the Wall Street people. Today we've got a
[03:38:51.560 --> 03:38:55.760]  story from Reuters. After the leaders rhetoric, climate negotiators start to
[03:38:55.760 --> 03:38:59.280]  work on a deal. They said the biggest obstacle is money. This is all about money
[03:38:59.280 --> 03:39:03.800]  folks. How to come up with the billions of dollars developing nations need to
[03:39:03.800 --> 03:39:08.480]  shift from fossil fuels and adapt to the impacts of their problem. Climate
[03:39:08.480 --> 03:39:11.720]  change, global warming. They don't want to call it that anymore of course. They
[03:39:11.720 --> 03:39:15.560]  say it's a lack of commitment. This is a Chinese delegate says unfortunately
[03:39:15.560 --> 03:39:20.360]  there's a lack of commitment by the rich countries to make deep cuts and to help
[03:39:20.360 --> 03:39:24.800]  developing nations with new finance to tackle global warming. In other words cut
[03:39:24.800 --> 03:39:28.720]  your standard of living, cut your production, cut everything that you cut
[03:39:28.720 --> 03:39:33.360]  your income and then transfer your wealth to us. Okay but it's not even to the
[03:39:33.360 --> 03:39:37.200]  poor people who need it. It's going to go to the intermediaries. They point out the
[03:39:37.200 --> 03:39:40.520]  mood has also been brightened by major spending announcements including a plan
[03:39:40.520 --> 03:39:46.480]  by India and France to mobilize a trillion dollars for solar power for some
[03:39:46.480 --> 03:39:49.800]  of the world's poorest people and private sector initiative led by
[03:39:49.800 --> 03:39:53.680]  Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to mobilize billions of dollars for new
[03:39:53.680 --> 03:39:57.160]  energy research and development. Understand he's going to put himself at
[03:39:57.160 --> 03:40:04.480]  the epicenter of this new venture capital fund. He's going to get
[03:40:04.480 --> 03:40:09.560]  first pass at these different things that come out and it's not going he's
[03:40:09.560 --> 03:40:12.480]  going to make himself even richer. They say Republicans have signaled that
[03:40:12.480 --> 03:40:16.440]  they're going to oppose authorizing the billions of dollars that Obama has
[03:40:16.440 --> 03:40:21.600]  pledged to help developing nations adapt to climate change. In other words to hand
[03:40:21.600 --> 03:40:26.000]  over to carbon billionaires like Al Gore and Bill Gates. Now they say the current
[03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:31.240]  goal is a hundred billion dollars per year. I repeat that a hundred billion
[03:40:31.240 --> 03:40:37.840]  dollars per year by 2020 to help them to get cheap energy sources. Cheap and clean
[03:40:37.840 --> 03:40:41.040]  energy sources. And today we saw this plan that Bill Gates is coming out again.
[03:40:41.040 --> 03:40:45.960]  This was actually yesterday he unveiled plans by an international coalition to
[03:40:45.960 --> 03:40:50.200]  invest billions of dollars in clean energy. Twenty countries are involved in
[03:40:50.200 --> 03:40:54.040]  this. United States is one of those and the countries have pledged to double
[03:40:54.040 --> 03:40:58.920]  their investment in low or no carbon energy research. They said during the
[03:40:58.920 --> 03:41:02.040]  summer Bill Gates said that he would invest about a billion dollars over the
[03:41:02.040 --> 03:41:07.320]  next five years. This is not altruism folks. This is buying his way into the
[03:41:07.320 --> 03:41:11.880]  controlling mechanism of this. Well what could possibly go wrong? Well we're going
[03:41:11.880 --> 03:41:14.960]  to talk about what has gone wrong. But what could go wrong with this agreement?
[03:41:14.960 --> 03:41:19.360]  They're pointing out that India and Russia may be ready to throw a monkey
[03:41:19.360 --> 03:41:23.720]  wrench into the machinery of this global consensus because that's what they
[03:41:23.720 --> 03:41:29.040]  really want. They want a consensus. This is an article from WND. It's Patrick
[03:41:29.040 --> 03:41:32.160]  Wood, an economist and an author they talked to. He says we've already seen
[03:41:32.160 --> 03:41:36.200]  India calling the US a carbon imperialist. We're one of the carbon
[03:41:36.200 --> 03:41:40.480]  bigots of the world. How dare we, Obama, try to tell India how to run its affairs.
[03:41:40.480 --> 03:41:45.120]  And of course they're absolutely right. That is what's going on. But see, Obama
[03:41:45.120 --> 03:41:49.800]  is doing it to us as well. It's not the United States as a carbon imperialist. It's
[03:41:49.800 --> 03:41:54.640]  that this small group of elite capitalists and their hand-picked puppets
[03:41:54.640 --> 03:42:00.040]  in places like high places like Obama. They are the ones who are the carbon
[03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:03.640]  imperialists. And what's the deal about carbon about imperialism? Of course India
[03:42:03.640 --> 03:42:09.240]  knows about imperialism. That's when you presumably have your own government.
[03:42:09.240 --> 03:42:13.120]  You know, all the way through the bureaucracy of India was all populated
[03:42:13.120 --> 03:42:18.520]  with people that were native. All except at the very top. At the very top they had
[03:42:18.520 --> 03:42:22.920]  a few British people controlling it. But all the rest of the way down this massive
[03:42:22.920 --> 03:42:26.240]  bureaucracy that the British created when they controlled India, all the rest of it
[03:42:26.240 --> 03:42:31.320]  was populated with Indians to make it appear as if it was a local
[03:42:31.320 --> 03:42:35.080]  government. But it wasn't. It was an imperial government. When you've got a
[03:42:35.080 --> 03:42:38.760]  few people at the top dictating to other people what they're going to be able to
[03:42:38.760 --> 03:42:41.320]  do, the standard of living that they're going to be able to have, forcing
[03:42:41.320 --> 03:42:45.240]  austerity on them so they can get even richer, that is imperialism. And that's
[03:42:45.240 --> 03:42:49.120]  being done not only to India, but it's going to be done to the United States
[03:42:49.120 --> 03:42:52.440]  even though we are the ones pushing the hardest for it because we are the ones
[03:42:52.440 --> 03:42:56.840]  who've been taken over the most by the crony capitalists. Russia is also pushing
[03:42:56.840 --> 03:42:59.640]  back on this. They say Russia has also said it will not abide by the carbon
[03:42:59.640 --> 03:43:04.840]  cuts designed to limit global warming to, and again, this two degrees centigrade
[03:43:04.840 --> 03:43:08.320]  increase that they're talking about. Again, that comes from Schellenhoover, the
[03:43:08.320 --> 03:43:12.320]  guy at the epicenter of all of this stuff. Talking about this two degrees that we
[03:43:12.320 --> 03:43:16.320]  can't move one way or the other, they have absolutely no basis for any of their
[03:43:16.320 --> 03:43:20.560]  models. When they have predicted how we would see the temperature go up, if we
[03:43:20.560 --> 03:43:24.640]  saw carbon dioxide emissions go up, carbon dioxide emissions did go up, in
[03:43:24.640 --> 03:43:29.040]  fact. Temperatures did not go up. They play games with where they collected, you
[03:43:29.040 --> 03:43:32.200]  know, as well as I do. If you look at the thermometer in your car, we lived
[03:43:32.200 --> 03:43:36.240]  outside of the city back in North Carolina. We would see from the small
[03:43:36.240 --> 03:43:40.320]  city of Raleigh to where we lived about 30 miles out, we would see a differential
[03:43:40.320 --> 03:43:44.840]  typically of three to five degrees in terms of it being cooler because where
[03:43:44.840 --> 03:43:48.640]  we lived, it was a massive forest that we lived in. I even see it here in Austin.
[03:43:48.640 --> 03:43:54.080]  I see a difference in temperature. I live in the exerbs of Austin, and it's not a
[03:43:54.080 --> 03:43:59.120]  heavily forested area, but I still see after I get out of the the heat desert
[03:43:59.120 --> 03:44:03.440]  of the cities, I see that. So they're very careful about where they put their
[03:44:03.440 --> 03:44:06.680]  thermostats, but I'm on airport tarmacs. I put them in the middle of cities. If you
[03:44:06.680 --> 03:44:10.640]  adjust, where you put your temperature can give you those kinds of
[03:44:10.640 --> 03:44:15.360]  differences. Of course, we also see that NASA is talking about contradictory
[03:44:15.360 --> 03:44:18.240]  information. Sometimes they'll come out and say the polar ice caps are melting,
[03:44:18.240 --> 03:44:21.840]  but, you know, we had in February they said the polar ice caps are bigger than
[03:44:21.840 --> 03:44:25.800]  they've been. We've seen six years of growth. We just had another report talking
[03:44:25.800 --> 03:44:30.320]  about how they were at record depth, even though they had a larger amount of
[03:44:30.320 --> 03:44:35.800]  snow melting on one side of Antarctica. The snow accumulation, not the snow
[03:44:35.800 --> 03:44:39.480]  accumulation, but the ice accumulation, was much greater in the other parts of
[03:44:39.480 --> 03:44:42.040]  Antarctica. The environmentalist then came back and said, oh, you're talking
[03:44:42.040 --> 03:44:44.840]  about snow accumulation. Said, no, there hasn't been any snow. It's actually
[03:44:44.840 --> 03:44:49.720]  increasing ice. So we get this back and forth. Even NASA can't decide, because in
[03:44:49.720 --> 03:44:52.800]  between those two reports, talking about how much it had grown in six years, and
[03:44:52.800 --> 03:44:57.720]  then talking about the record net increase that they've had, there was one
[03:44:57.720 --> 03:45:02.000]  saying, oh, it's shrinking, all coming from the same government agency. So the
[03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:07.240]  science is not settled. The models do not predict what they
[03:45:07.240 --> 03:45:10.120]  said they were going to do. As a matter of fact, the models, for the most part,
[03:45:10.120 --> 03:45:13.120]  are untestable. They're talking and theorizing about things that are going
[03:45:13.120 --> 03:45:18.080]  to happen 50 years, 100 years, 1,000 years in the future. There is no way to do
[03:45:18.080 --> 03:45:22.400]  this, so they appeal to their raw basis of authority. But going on with what's
[03:45:22.400 --> 03:45:26.240]  happening with the crony capitalism, they say, in the case of Obama, we already
[03:45:26.240 --> 03:45:29.480]  know what he's going to do. He's already laid it out. He's looking to use the Clean
[03:45:29.480 --> 03:45:33.560]  Air Act. He's going to rewrite it. He's going to implement it. He's going to
[03:45:33.560 --> 03:45:38.360]  implement these policies using the EPA, using the Clean Air Act, using his
[03:45:38.360 --> 03:45:42.200]  executive authority. So we know it's going to be rammed down our
[03:45:42.200 --> 03:45:45.680]  throats, but they need a consensus and they need to come up with something and
[03:45:45.680 --> 03:45:49.520]  how they're going to transfer this to other people. That's where the crony
[03:45:49.520 --> 03:45:53.560]  climatism comes in. And I want you to remember, most people remember
[03:45:53.560 --> 03:45:58.280]  Selindra. That was talked about a lot. That happened a few years ago. But the
[03:45:58.280 --> 03:46:05.160]  night before this climate change summit came up, Obama had been pouring money
[03:46:05.160 --> 03:46:09.960]  into a company from Spain called Abnegua SA. And I'm not sure if I'm
[03:46:09.960 --> 03:46:13.560]  pronouncing that correctly. We need to look that up because we need to make
[03:46:13.560 --> 03:46:20.040]  that a household word. But it's a Spanish company. Abnegua SA received
[03:46:20.040 --> 03:46:26.520]  $3 billion in administration sustainable energy loans and money from the export
[03:46:26.520 --> 03:46:30.760]  import bank in the form of loan guarantees. So they announced that they'd
[03:46:30.760 --> 03:46:35.480]  started bankruptcy proceedings the night or the day before this conference
[03:46:35.480 --> 03:46:40.680]  began. And this is a huge amount that is going to be involved in this. What
[03:46:40.680 --> 03:46:45.160]  they were going to do, they were going to build four power plants in
[03:46:45.160 --> 03:46:50.840]  California and Arizona that were solar power plants. And they are now going to
[03:46:50.840 --> 03:46:54.920]  renege on some of that, I assume. Some of that has gone online. The plants that
[03:46:54.920 --> 03:46:59.080]  are online are only putting out half of what they said they were going to do.
[03:46:59.080 --> 03:47:03.480]  Sounds very much like things that we've seen before with these other
[03:47:03.480 --> 03:47:07.400]  green companies that Obama has been funding. If we go back and look at
[03:47:07.400 --> 03:47:11.320]  April, we saw that the Obama clean energy loans
[03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:16.440]  were leaving taxpayers $2.2 billion in the hole. That was the Washington Times
[03:47:16.440 --> 03:47:21.560]  report back in April. Now that was $2.2 billion in April,
[03:47:21.560 --> 03:47:25.160]  collectively. And they were saying that, well, some people have put it at $4 billion,
[03:47:25.160 --> 03:47:28.040]  but then they're playing games with it and getting it down to $2 billion.
[03:47:28.040 --> 03:47:32.600]  Whatever. We've now seen another $3 billion just with a single company
[03:47:32.600 --> 03:47:36.920]  that is going bankrupt, this Spanish company. So it's growing that quickly.
[03:47:36.920 --> 03:47:40.840]  There was a list back in 2012, three years ago.
[03:47:40.840 --> 03:47:44.920]  There had been 36 taxpayer-funded green energy failures.
[03:47:44.920 --> 03:47:49.480]  And of course, one of those was Cylundra. That was a half a billion dollars.
[03:47:49.480 --> 03:47:53.080]  And everybody was talking about Cylundra as a great example
[03:47:53.080 --> 03:47:57.640]  of this kind of crony capitalism. And these figures, again, do not include
[03:47:57.640 --> 03:48:01.560]  any state, local, or federal tax credit subsidies.
[03:48:01.560 --> 03:48:06.520]  This is just some of the other federal loan guarantees or part of this.
[03:48:06.520 --> 03:48:09.640]  So that was back in 2012. There had been 36
[03:48:09.640 --> 03:48:13.800]  green energy failures at that point in time. And they just keep
[03:48:13.800 --> 03:48:17.160]  failing. Nevertheless, we see this report that green
[03:48:17.160 --> 03:48:20.680]  energy sees a secure future from Obama's climate plan.
[03:48:20.680 --> 03:48:25.000]  So in spite of 36 countries failing three years ago, and even more now,
[03:48:25.000 --> 03:48:29.480]  in spite of one that's $3 billion failing the day before the climate
[03:48:29.480 --> 03:48:33.560]  summit, we now see that nothing is going to change, of course.
[03:48:33.560 --> 03:48:37.320]  Obama is going to stick the course. He is going to continue to subsidize these
[03:48:37.320 --> 03:48:39.960]  people. They talk about how solar and wind energy
[03:48:39.960 --> 03:48:42.440]  in the United States is likely to have a secure future,
[03:48:42.440 --> 03:48:46.280]  thanks to President Barack Obama's plan to cut carbon emissions
[03:48:46.280 --> 03:48:49.800]  by forcing utilities to use renewable resources.
[03:48:49.800 --> 03:48:52.760]  See, their hands are tied. They've legislated and said you're going to
[03:48:52.760 --> 03:48:56.360]  produce X amount of electricity from renewable resources.
[03:48:56.360 --> 03:48:59.560]  And so then it really doesn't matter how much it costs.
[03:48:59.560 --> 03:49:02.760]  You're going to have to raise your utility rates. You're going to have to
[03:49:02.760 --> 03:49:05.960]  fund these companies that continue to go belly up
[03:49:05.960 --> 03:49:09.640]  because they're mandating that you do that and then mandating that they're
[03:49:09.640 --> 03:49:12.840]  going to subsidize it. So that's the greenwashing that's
[03:49:12.840 --> 03:49:16.280]  going on with this. If you really believe that there's man-made
[03:49:16.280 --> 03:49:19.640]  global warming, you have to understand that it is
[03:49:19.640 --> 03:49:23.880]  really about transferring the money. We've got two options
[03:49:23.880 --> 03:49:27.880]  that are coming up in this climate agreement that they're trying to hammer
[03:49:27.880 --> 03:49:29.880]  out. We've already seen the draft agreement,
[03:49:29.880 --> 03:49:34.040]  and we know that there's two options. One of those options is essentially
[03:49:34.040 --> 03:49:37.880]  a voluntary option where people are going to promote
[03:49:37.880 --> 03:49:40.600]  compliance, but they're not going to enforce compliance.
[03:49:40.600 --> 03:49:44.520]  Now Obama has said that the Obama White House has made no secret in the past
[03:49:44.520 --> 03:49:47.400]  of talking about how they needed to make this agreement
[03:49:47.400 --> 03:49:51.000]  legally binding, how they needed to have an enforcement mechanism.
[03:49:51.000 --> 03:49:54.840]  Now Obama is saying the same thing himself, saying it personally. So they're
[03:49:54.840 --> 03:49:59.080]  escalating this to an area to a level that they've never done before.
[03:49:59.080 --> 03:50:01.800]  And I want to tell you, and I've talked about this on the nightly news,
[03:50:01.800 --> 03:50:05.640]  out of these two options, one of them which is
[03:50:05.640 --> 03:50:09.640]  promoting it, doing it voluntarily, that doesn't get
[03:50:09.640 --> 03:50:14.920]  nearly the kind of detail as option two, which is an international tribunal of
[03:50:14.920 --> 03:50:19.480]  climate justice. It addresses cases of non-compliance
[03:50:19.480 --> 03:50:22.200]  of all commitments by the developing countries,
[03:50:22.200 --> 03:50:26.840]  and it produces a list of consequences. Who's going to enforce these consequences?
[03:50:26.840 --> 03:50:30.520]  If you're going to have an international group that's going to be above
[03:50:30.520 --> 03:50:33.640]  the sovereignty of these individual nations, that is going to enforce
[03:50:33.640 --> 03:50:36.520]  compliance, you are talking about a world government.
[03:50:36.520 --> 03:50:39.480]  And as I pointed out before when you look at option one, which is this kind of
[03:50:39.480 --> 03:50:42.920]  well let's just kind of promote it, they don't have the details down, they don't
[03:50:42.920 --> 03:50:45.320]  know how many delegates they're going to have with this,
[03:50:45.320 --> 03:50:48.680]  but when you look at option two, the hammer mechanism,
[03:50:48.680 --> 03:50:52.280]  they know precisely that they're going to have 12 members, half of them are going
[03:50:52.280 --> 03:50:55.800]  to be from developing countries, half of them are going to be from non-developing
[03:50:55.800 --> 03:50:57.400]  countries. Stay with us, we'll come back, we're
[03:50:57.400 --> 03:51:00.600]  going to go to your calls, we'll be right back.
[03:51:00.600 --> 03:51:05.800]  My name is Don Whisken, and at 42 years old I suffered a massive heart attack
[03:51:05.800 --> 03:51:09.320]  and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:09.320 --> 03:51:15.480]  What did I do? I created Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs
[03:51:15.480 --> 03:51:18.760]  which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:18.760 --> 03:51:24.200]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you,
[03:51:24.200 --> 03:51:27.720]  so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:27.720 --> 03:51:31.160]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your
[03:51:31.160 --> 03:51:36.520]  natural immune system. I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.
[03:51:36.520 --> 03:51:47.240]  To get your Extendivite, call 1-877-928-8822, that's 1-877-928-8822, or visit
[03:51:47.240 --> 03:51:52.520]  heartdrop.com. Extendivite is only $69.95 for a two-month supply of either
[03:51:52.520 --> 03:51:54.600]  capsules or liquid.
[03:51:54.600 --> 03:51:59.640]  Extend your life with Extendivite.
[03:51:59.640 --> 03:52:02.680]  I want more candy, I want more videos here, fly my life.
[03:52:02.680 --> 03:52:07.240]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop
[03:52:07.240 --> 03:52:11.240]  a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help
[03:52:11.240 --> 03:52:14.200]  children focus. All of our children are hit with modern
[03:52:14.200 --> 03:52:19.000]  mind control. Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young
[03:52:19.000 --> 03:52:22.760]  humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered
[03:52:22.760 --> 03:52:27.240]  daily by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm
[03:52:27.240 --> 03:52:29.960]  down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[03:52:29.960 --> 03:52:33.400]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest
[03:52:33.400 --> 03:52:36.360]  quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[03:52:36.360 --> 03:52:39.720]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are
[03:52:39.720 --> 03:52:43.480]  safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula
[03:52:43.480 --> 03:52:46.760]  out there. Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming
[03:52:46.760 --> 03:52:51.480]  extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[03:53:00.840 --> 03:53:04.920]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day and the
[03:53:04.920 --> 03:53:08.680]  home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[03:53:08.680 --> 03:53:12.520]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of
[03:53:12.520 --> 03:53:16.680]  their long-term contracts. You get stuck writing huge checks month
[03:53:16.680 --> 03:53:21.480]  after month with no way out. It's robbery by contract and it can cost
[03:53:21.480 --> 03:53:24.280]  you thousands but there's a better way to protect
[03:53:24.280 --> 03:53:27.960]  your home. Simply safe home security. Simply safe has no

[03:54:07.080 --> 03:54:10.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host. I want to go
[03:54:10.280 --> 03:54:12.520]  back to our callers before I do real quickly. I just want to let you know
[03:54:12.520 --> 03:54:17.880]  about specials that we have at the InfowarsLife.com and the InfowarsStore.com.
[03:54:17.880 --> 03:54:21.720]  We have the new product that Alex has been talking about, the premium power pack.
[03:54:21.720 --> 03:54:25.240]  Others charge $150 for power packs that have
[03:54:25.240 --> 03:54:29.080]  lesser specifications. This will not only charge your electronic devices, but it
[03:54:29.080 --> 03:54:32.520]  will even be able to jump start your car with the included
[03:54:32.520 --> 03:54:37.400]  jumper cables. That's available for $120. We have free shipping available at the
[03:54:37.400 --> 03:54:40.840]  store. We have a free ebook, Keys to Survival. All
[03:54:40.840 --> 03:54:44.200]  you have to do is sign up to the newsletter to get that free ebook.
[03:54:44.200 --> 03:54:50.440]  And we have a 25% off special on Superfemale Vitality that ends tonight
[03:54:50.440 --> 03:54:53.720]  at midnight. And again, free shipping on everything
[03:54:53.720 --> 03:54:57.160]  at the store. I want to go back to our callers in just a moment.
[03:54:57.160 --> 03:55:00.600]  Before I do, I was just handed an article by
[03:55:00.600 --> 03:55:04.600]  Matt here in production talking about what needs to be
[03:55:04.600 --> 03:55:07.800]  ironed out in this agreement. And of course, many of the people
[03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:10.840]  like the Atlantic who believe that there really is
[03:55:10.840 --> 03:55:14.040]  a man-made global warming problem that needs to be solved
[03:55:14.040 --> 03:55:17.160]  are looking at this and saying, you know, there's a possibility that they won't
[03:55:17.160 --> 03:55:21.880]  even reach a global temperature target. That they won't even set that target.
[03:55:21.880 --> 03:55:24.920]  And it's like, well, you know what, that's a real possibility.
[03:55:24.920 --> 03:55:29.480]  And I hope it is because I don't think a few politicians
[03:55:29.480 --> 03:55:32.840]  should be sitting around and setting the global thermostat.
[03:55:32.840 --> 03:55:37.000]  Who are they to determine whether the temperature needs to be hotter or warmer?
[03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:39.880]  Of course, we know that they have the capability to do that.
[03:55:39.880 --> 03:55:45.480]  And not by controlling emissions, we know that they have the geoengineering
[03:55:45.480 --> 03:55:47.720]  capability to do that. We know they've been messing around with
[03:55:47.720 --> 03:55:50.760]  geoengineering for quite a while. You can take a look at the
[03:55:50.760 --> 03:55:54.280]  Skyder Alert app. That's where people will phone
[03:55:54.280 --> 03:56:01.000]  in places where there is a cloud covering because of
[03:56:01.000 --> 03:56:04.200]  chemtrails that they're spraying in that area. And you can see in those areas
[03:56:04.200 --> 03:56:07.720]  they correlated that to a rise in the temperatures over those areas.
[03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:11.880]  Again, you can make it look as if the climate is doing something or you can
[03:56:11.880 --> 03:56:15.080]  actually manipulate the climate. When they have the geoengineering
[03:56:15.080 --> 03:56:19.320]  conference that they had in August of 2014, there were several papers saying
[03:56:19.320 --> 03:56:23.320]  this is crazy. All this talk about setting a
[03:56:23.320 --> 03:56:27.480]  thermostat globally. Who are we to do that? We don't have the wisdom to do that,
[03:56:27.480 --> 03:56:30.440]  even though we do have the mechanism to do that. And they always talk about it
[03:56:30.440 --> 03:56:34.600]  as if it's not something that they're doing. We've been covering that for quite
[03:56:34.600 --> 03:56:38.680]  a long time. But it is just the, I think people on
[03:56:38.680 --> 03:56:42.200]  the left who even understand, who believe I should say, that this is
[03:56:42.200 --> 03:56:45.560]  something that needs to be done, even they understand
[03:56:45.560 --> 03:56:48.120]  that this is really going to be nothing but greenwashing.
[03:56:48.120 --> 03:56:51.160]  Hopefully they won't come up with some kind of an enforcement mechanism that's
[03:56:51.160 --> 03:56:56.200]  global. Hopefully they will just come up with some
[03:56:56.200 --> 03:56:59.160]  some good commitments that they have to each other, make each other feel good
[03:56:59.160 --> 03:57:01.720]  about it. I'll tell you one thing that is going to happen because it is already
[03:57:01.720 --> 03:57:04.600]  happening. They're going to be pouring massive amounts of
[03:57:04.600 --> 03:57:07.240]  money. All they really want to do is get the okay
[03:57:07.240 --> 03:57:10.680]  from their governments to transfer money to these
[03:57:10.680 --> 03:57:14.760]  greenwashing tech giants, as we see Bill Gates getting his
[03:57:14.760 --> 03:57:17.880]  finger in the pie. Let's go real quickly to Chad in South Carolina.
[03:57:17.880 --> 03:57:22.760]  South Carolina, you wanted to talk about ISIS, defunding ISIS. Go ahead.
[03:57:22.760 --> 03:57:26.920]  Hey Mr. Knight. Yeah, I haven't heard that term to defund ISIS.
[03:57:26.920 --> 03:57:30.920]  Have you heard it? I haven't heard them saying that they want to do that. No,
[03:57:30.920 --> 03:57:35.080]  no. We really know that they are funding ISIS, aren't they?
[03:57:35.080 --> 03:57:38.680]  Yes, I heard defund Planned Parenthood, but I haven't heard anyone say we need to
[03:57:38.680 --> 03:57:43.800]  defund ISIS. And also it sounds like this is Selenja 2.0 basically.
[03:57:43.800 --> 03:57:47.000]  Yeah, exactly. And does Selenja get bailed out?
[03:57:47.000 --> 03:57:51.240]  Whenever everyone invested in Selenja and the masses, the people, us,
[03:57:51.240 --> 03:57:55.080]  we lose our money. That's right. When we invest, we invest and then they
[03:57:55.080 --> 03:57:59.000]  make, they get their bonuses. They still make their money, but yet,
[03:57:59.000 --> 03:58:03.000]  see, anytime we get smart, we say, well, we'll invest in the military industrial
[03:58:03.000 --> 03:58:07.400]  complex or the pharmaceutical industry. Then they go belly up
[03:58:07.400 --> 03:58:11.320]  and then they get bailed out. So it's no beating them. It's just exposed, exposed,
[03:58:11.320 --> 03:58:14.520]  exposed. And of course, this is going to be Selenja 2.0,
[03:58:14.520 --> 03:58:18.840]  the Spanish company that went belly up just before the climate conference began.
[03:58:18.840 --> 03:58:22.360]  That is six times bigger than Selenja and it just underscores
[03:58:22.360 --> 03:58:25.480]  the crimes that are really going on here. That's all the time we've got. Sorry to
[03:58:25.480 --> 03:58:28.280]  the rest of the callers. Join us tonight for the InfiWars Nightly
[03:58:28.280 --> 03:58:38.280]  News at 7 Central, 8 p.m. Eastern.
