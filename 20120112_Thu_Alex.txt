[01:26.600 --> 01:33.000]  drugs report and they basically declared national security in that case but
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.040]  then we later learned that indeed they are monitoring the sites and Janet

[03:03.640 --> 03:07.920]  and made him join them and that's actually one of the reasons that East
[03:07.920 --> 03:13.320]  Germany fell first and started the fall of the old Soviet Union was because the
[03:13.320 --> 03:20.080]  spies were actually looking at the anti-communist material and it made a
[03:20.080 --> 03:25.120]  lot of sense show even though it's illegal that you spy on us open source
[03:25.120 --> 03:29.280]  stuff's not illegal but use our tax money to collate it even though you do spy on

[08:42.320 --> 08:47.240]  Iran and the covert war now admitted by the United States in Israel remember I
[08:47.240 --> 08:50.400]  was a conspiracy theorist five years ago saying that the US and Israel were
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.120]  assassinating and blowing stuff up in Iran even a few months ago with the
[08:55.120 --> 09:02.320]  mainstream said it wasn't true but now Fox News New York Times Ynet news out of
[09:02.320 --> 09:07.440]  Israel Jerusalem post top Israeli general they admitted all there you go so I
[09:07.440 --> 09:13.040]  told you the war with Iran is on and it's going on currently and accelerating
[09:13.040 --> 09:19.840]  towards blockades and embargoes and open hot army against army war not just
[09:19.840 --> 09:25.840]  asymmetrical and Iran is saying they're gonna start attacking Israelis so it's
[09:25.840 --> 09:30.920]  it's it's off to the races and people say well what side are you on I'm not on
[09:30.920 --> 09:36.720]  any side except freedom and I'm tired of the endless wars they only lead to more
[09:36.720 --> 09:41.200]  wars and killing Iranians and blowing up their military bases they're gonna
[09:41.200 --> 09:47.040]  respond you know it's like asking you when a bolt of lightning strikes a house
[09:47.040 --> 09:50.640]  and it catches on fire what side are you on well I'd rather the bolt of
[09:50.640 --> 09:54.480]  lightning not strike the house and set it on fire at 2 a.m. and burn up the
[09:54.480 --> 10:00.720]  family inside I'm I'm against calamity I I just don't think wars always sexy and
[10:00.720 --> 10:04.200]  cool in the way to go now if you're being attacked if you're having your
[10:04.200 --> 10:07.760]  liberty taken if you're being overtaken then you have a right to defend
[10:07.760 --> 10:11.160]  yourself it's funny though when we have this foreign global corporate
[10:11.160 --> 10:15.120]  government that's taken over America and it's militarizing the police against us
[10:15.120 --> 10:19.120]  and overthrowing our Bill of Rights and Constitution engaging in classical
[10:19.120 --> 10:23.640]  tyranny oh I'm supposed to just sit here and take it or I get put on extremist
[10:23.640 --> 10:29.360]  list for just being what you'd call an Americana just you know Americana 57
[10:29.360 --> 10:36.680]  Chevy's freedom private property Elvis Presley Marilyn Monroe you know
[10:36.680 --> 10:44.520]  second amendment John Wayne leave me alone I mean it is that simple and so I'm
[10:44.520 --> 10:50.280]  the bad guy Ron Paul for being a classical what made America great I mean
[10:50.280 --> 10:53.320]  if you know what the Constitution Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence is
[10:53.320 --> 11:00.600]  what it stands for it's very simple then you love Ron Paul but in this world
[11:00.600 --> 11:07.240]  where the criminals run things to be patriotic to be common sense is
[11:07.240 --> 11:12.240]  revolutionary and is threatening and Ron Paul I've got some of the video clips
[11:12.240 --> 11:15.860]  will play later you know he's been giving speeches saying hey they call me a
[11:15.860 --> 11:21.360]  cook in weird stuff because they can't intellectually face me on the issues this
[11:21.360 --> 11:24.800]  isn't a guy that needs a teleprompter this is a guy that actually is obsessed
[11:24.800 --> 11:27.880]  with information you know they see the other candidates like what do you do
[11:27.880 --> 11:31.080]  when you're at home on the weekend I watch football everybody's like oh that's
[11:31.080 --> 11:34.760]  manly Ron Paul's well when I'm not spending time with my family if they go
[11:34.760 --> 11:39.640]  to bed you know I'm I'm reading textbooks I'm reading history books I'm
[11:39.640 --> 11:46.280]  reading economics people are like huh that's boring that's not manly to
[11:46.280 --> 11:51.840]  actually know how things work no that is as manly as it gets men are supposed to
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.480]  be informed men are not supposed to be silly and and and mindless children
[11:57.480 --> 12:03.680]  historically are obsessed with little ball games and acting tough and you know
[12:03.680 --> 12:08.680]  petty celebrities historically women have been associated with that not there
[12:08.680 --> 12:12.480]  haven't been a lot of serious women but it's always been kind of allowed for
[12:12.480 --> 12:17.800]  women to be into things like that men are supposed to be serious and involved
[12:17.800 --> 12:23.640]  and informed at least in in in free and great civilizations are known by that
[12:23.640 --> 12:29.400]  hallmark of stoic aggressive serious informed men who see it as manly to be
[12:29.400 --> 12:33.240]  able to speak five languages and who know history and who are ready of you to
[12:33.240 --> 12:36.640]  challenge their honor to go out in the street have a sword fight with you to
[12:36.640 --> 12:42.560]  the death that's what marks real civilization just men who are ready to
[12:42.560 --> 12:48.200]  die on an instant notice for what they stand for are most manly aren't on our
[12:48.200 --> 12:55.400]  arm to even hold a shadow to our predecessors this is what we've turned
[12:55.400 --> 13:01.960]  into is a bunch of arrested development gibbering monkeys I see grown men who
[13:01.960 --> 13:07.440]  have imprinted on sitcoms and dramas who think acting silly and acting stupid
[13:07.440 --> 13:13.920]  is cute and funny and you wonder why our civilization is in freefall right now
[13:13.920 --> 13:20.200]  because men are not being men we're being taught to act like little little
[13:20.200 --> 13:26.200]  little boys with with feminizing hormones pumped into us by the way I've
[13:26.200 --> 13:29.960]  been telling you for more than 12 years since I discovered public scientific
[13:29.960 --> 13:33.520]  documents and interviewed people like dr. Blalock and others that this phenol
[13:33.520 --> 13:39.800]  a is massively causing cancer big study out today mainstream news we're
[13:39.800 --> 13:45.160]  forcing it out there every breast tumor that's cut into is filled with the
[13:45.160 --> 13:50.520]  best phenol a it is what is killing our women and I just look at my wife and I
[13:50.520 --> 13:58.080]  just and I just care about her and I and I and I like her and I like every
[13:58.080 --> 14:03.600]  I like parts of her body and I just think about the nightmare of part of her
[14:03.600 --> 14:08.320]  you know I mean so much of my family's had breast cancer and her family and
[14:08.320 --> 14:14.000]  just it just my grandmother has it and it's just like I am so angry I am so
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.920]  angry that they knew and I've shown you the documents that this chemical out of
[14:18.920 --> 14:23.520]  thousands they could have used does this and they do it and then I come out here
[14:23.520 --> 14:29.480]  and warn women and I get made fun of by ABC CBS media matters hundreds of
[14:29.480 --> 14:35.000]  publications conservatively that I'm making fun of gay people because I point
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.480]  out this makes men feminine and gives women breast cancer it isn't funny okay
[14:41.480 --> 14:45.880]  and P and listen the system knows this and I've had enough of it so I'm gonna
[14:45.880 --> 14:51.680]  be getting to that report coming up later I will cover that and we've got a lot
[14:51.680 --> 14:54.960]  of other important news and there's all these brain disorders popping up I mean
[14:54.960 --> 14:58.040]  they've got reports about whole high schools just full of children now who
[14:58.040 --> 15:02.040]  suddenly are gibbering and and have Tourette's like syndromes and stuff it's
[15:02.040 --> 15:07.960]  the chemicals folks they're killing us this is eugenics this is death and
[15:07.960 --> 15:10.280]  you're never gonna hear the environmental groups that are government
[15:10.280 --> 15:13.360]  funded and foundation fun to talk about this they'll never talk about real
[15:13.360 --> 15:19.640]  environmental issues when we have environmental Armageddon going on on the
[15:19.640 --> 15:23.360]  genetic front the chemical front everything they'll tell you oh it's
[15:23.360 --> 15:26.920]  carbon dioxide that's a point
[15:28.240 --> 15:33.520]  zero three nine zero in its highest levels effect guys let me double check
[15:33.520 --> 15:36.800]  that number pull up percentage of carbon dioxide the atmosphere police for
[15:36.800 --> 15:40.880]  viewers on prison planet TV radio listeners can do it themselves it is point
[15:40.880 --> 15:45.680]  zero three nine zero and its highest concentrations in lowland areas in
[15:45.680 --> 15:54.500]  highland areas it's as low as zero point zero three six zero and it's the
[15:54.500 --> 15:59.920]  lowest ever recorded from the ice core samples the mud bog samples the shale
[15:59.920 --> 16:05.800]  samples we are in a desperate situation there's even a new most of the ancient
[16:05.800 --> 16:08.680]  plants have all died because they need more carbon dioxide they're dying all
[16:08.680 --> 16:12.400]  over the world being phased out there's a new types of plants that are newer in
[16:12.400 --> 16:16.560]  the earth development that can operate on with almost no carbon dioxide and
[16:16.560 --> 16:22.240]  many scientists we've had on have said that the earth could die because of this
[16:22.240 --> 16:26.360]  like like Mars once had oceans all across it and undoubtedly it looks like
[16:26.360 --> 16:33.880]  life and it lost its atmosphere it lost its carbon dioxide you want to off gas
[16:33.880 --> 16:39.840]  our atmosphere I mean this is I mean it that's why so many scientists say it's
[16:39.840 --> 16:43.440]  like a foreign entity is running this and wants to destroy the earth or
[16:43.440 --> 16:48.000]  something but yeah it's called the devil you can call me superstitious
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.520]  whatever I mean what else is it they're not worried about all these real
[16:51.520 --> 16:54.360]  environmental problems they've got is freaking out over carbon dioxide I mean
[16:54.360 --> 17:02.400]  what a sickening joke okay I'm ranting I just look at this covert war on Iran
[17:02.400 --> 17:07.160]  prudent strategy this why net news out of Israel former Israeli defense
[17:07.160 --> 17:12.000]  official tells New York Times ambiguous policies are best when it comes to

[24:51.600 --> 24:55.760]  into some really hardcore news in the next segment some stuff it's pretty
[24:55.760 --> 24:59.680]  scary but if we've got to admit what's happening so that we can do something
[24:59.680 --> 25:07.080]  about it to stop it so in the gloom and doom is the solution in admitting
[25:07.080 --> 25:12.000]  reality and explaining that the direction we're going in is the wrong
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.560]  direction is only hope we have to turn things around we also have more media
[25:16.560 --> 25:21.440]  clips from the establishment press the dinosaur press telling us Ron Paul
[25:21.440 --> 25:25.520]  still can't win and didn't really get second place in New Hampshire and really
[25:25.520 --> 25:30.560]  treating their viewers like sheep very condescending hey guys that's why every

[25:36.080 --> 25:40.920]  the drudge report does and every other alternative media system grows while you
[25:40.920 --> 25:45.480]  shrink go look at the numbers you're fully aware of them so just continue
[25:45.480 --> 25:49.640]  doing what you're doing and no amount of so pa act is going to put the genie back
[25:49.640 --> 25:52.200]  in the bottle you think you're going to team up with the government to shut
[25:52.200 --> 25:58.280]  down your competition the truth against your lies sorry the truth sells a
[25:58.280 --> 26:02.520]  thousand to one two lies okay so I'll keep selling the truth I don't need
[26:02.520 --> 26:06.120]  teleprompters I don't need to think about what I said yesterday to match it up
[26:06.120 --> 26:12.240]  today because I'm telling the truth I make mistakes occasionally you bet and
[26:12.240 --> 26:16.280]  we correct them when we do but we're trying to tell the truth we're trying
[26:16.280 --> 26:21.880]  to be as accurate as we can we're seeking after reality you are seeking
[26:21.880 --> 26:26.120]  after lies and disassembling and manipulation and gatekeeping and
[26:26.120 --> 26:30.280]  telling everybody what to do and being control freaks and you belong to the
[26:30.280 --> 26:35.040]  dustbin of history me it's a positive news right now though this is out of the
[26:35.040 --> 26:37.800]  Wall Street Journal and I want to do a report on this tonight or tomorrow night
[26:37.800 --> 26:42.280]  in detail in the nightly news is just looking at the the Hubble photos and
[26:42.280 --> 26:48.920]  other systems an otherworldly discovery just give you an idea of how big the
[26:48.920 --> 26:53.040]  universe is because we can basically only see down the block we don't even
[26:53.040 --> 26:56.640]  know what comes after that and now with these radio telescopes and other
[26:56.640 --> 27:03.720]  systems they discovered billions of other planets and many of them off of the
[27:03.720 --> 27:08.280]  scans they're getting appear to be earth-like covered with water we know
[27:08.280 --> 27:13.440]  that some of the moons of Saturn have ice covering them and have water under
[27:13.440 --> 27:18.040]  them and there's volcanic activity which means there's hot water that's just so
[27:18.040 --> 27:24.520]  amazing astronomers said Wednesday that each of the 100 billion stars in the
[27:24.520 --> 27:28.120]  Milky Way that's just our galaxy and there's hundreds of billions of galaxies
[27:28.120 --> 27:33.320]  photographed astronomers said Wednesday that each of the 100 billion stars
[27:33.320 --> 27:39.680]  in the Milky Way probably has at least one companion planet on average adding
[27:39.680 --> 27:45.500]  credence to the notion that planets are as common in the cosmos as grains of
[27:45.500 --> 27:51.640]  sand on the beach the finding underscores a fundamental shift in
[27:51.640 --> 27:56.280]  scientific understanding of planetary systems in the cosmos our own solar
[27:56.280 --> 28:00.880]  system consistent considered unique not so long ago turns out to be just one
[28:00.880 --> 28:07.240]  among billions the others hundreds of billions until April 94 there was no
[28:07.240 --> 28:10.760]  other known solar system but the discoveries have slowly mounted since
[28:10.760 --> 28:15.880]  then the Kepler space telescope designed for planet hunting now finds them
[28:15.880 --> 28:21.200]  routinely planets are the rule rather than exception should the lead
[28:21.200 --> 28:27.720]  astronomer Arnaud Casson at the Institute of Astrophysics in Paris let's
[28:27.720 --> 28:32.000]  try to get him on just I want scientists I want to I want to look at the beauty
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.840]  of the universe and the magic and the depth of it the well really it's it's
[28:36.840 --> 28:43.360]  unending I want to talk more about the the amazing beauty all around us while
[28:43.360 --> 28:49.840]  we cover what the globalists are doing to contrast the establishment system
[28:49.840 --> 28:55.440]  that's trying to keep us tied down with Britney Spears and all this cultural
[28:55.440 --> 29:04.240]  death and ugliness I mean it's such a con game it's it's a joke because for me
[29:04.240 --> 29:10.600]  when I think about the limitlessness of time and the depths of the
[29:10.600 --> 29:14.720]  universe and the depths of beauty and goodness and creativity and the depths
[29:14.720 --> 29:20.320]  of honor and decency and humanity and all the good deeds that outweigh the bad
[29:20.320 --> 29:26.080]  it just it just makes me marvel and have no fear of death we're just part of
[29:26.080 --> 29:34.560]  something so huge and here's another report out of AFP world's tiniest
[29:34.560 --> 29:39.880]  frogs found in Papua New Guinea they find hundreds of new species every week
[29:39.880 --> 29:43.400]  wow we're gonna talk somewhere about this layer and I'll get into the really

[33:56.200 --> 34:01.800]  100,000 watt global shortwave service to the world and I get letters from
[34:01.800 --> 34:08.680]  missionaries in Central Africa and people in the Himalayas it's just wild what
[34:08.680 --> 34:13.400]  the shortwave does as well people listening in villages and on ships at
[34:13.400 --> 34:18.880]  sea and I've gotten calls from weather stations in Antarctica and in the Arctic
[34:18.880 --> 34:26.560]  from the northern ice cap to the southern ice cap and beyond it's it's
[34:26.560 --> 34:31.720]  wild it's wild realize we talk every week in the aggregate with all different
[34:31.720 --> 34:39.080]  forms and transmissions to 15 million souls what a responsibility and I do
[34:39.080 --> 34:43.200]  not claim that I am up to the challenge but I'm here I'm on the field and I'm
[34:43.200 --> 34:49.360]  doing the best I can and I thank you all for your prayers when you consciously
[34:49.360 --> 34:53.320]  realize you're standing in front of millions of people and that the world
[34:53.320 --> 34:57.600]  is in such dire straits and that we have so much potential to turn it around it
[34:57.600 --> 35:08.440]  is it is mind mind blowing okay let me just get into Iran now that I'll get
[35:08.440 --> 35:11.040]  into the other news and then open the phones up then we have Mike Adams coming
[35:11.040 --> 35:14.840]  on and also Luke Radowski confronted Newt Gennrich and one of the most
[35:14.840 --> 35:18.640]  powerful little confrontations he brought up Bohemian Grove and Gennrich just
[35:18.640 --> 35:22.200]  said you're basically insane it doesn't exist Newt Gennrich is in two of the
[35:22.200 --> 35:28.760]  annals of Bohemian Grove that we got from widows of Bohemian Grove members and
[35:28.760 --> 35:33.600]  he's been one of the key speakers there and we have all the proof of that in
[35:33.600 --> 35:37.160]  the video that Luke Radowski and We Are Changed put out that's up at info wars
[35:37.160 --> 35:42.960]  com right now and it's just very interesting to see a nudie playing a
[35:42.960 --> 35:46.280]  little game there's a little devil smile and saying you're insane doesn't
[35:46.280 --> 35:54.080]  exist thinking that people watching are ignorant everything they do counts on you
[35:54.080 --> 35:59.840]  not having open eyes everything they are a lot of the globalists have the owl as
[35:59.840 --> 36:03.040]  their symbol sure in Greek mythology it means wisdom and it means that as well
[36:03.040 --> 36:09.040]  but for them the owl sees in the dark you don't you're a little mouse down there
[36:09.040 --> 36:12.760]  that doesn't see well in the dark and they can fly down and grab you with
[36:12.760 --> 36:19.880]  their talents I'm not a mouse okay and so you try to try to swoop down on me I
[36:19.880 --> 36:24.440]  could see at night I could see during the day I could see it high noon you know
[36:24.440 --> 36:27.040]  there's the video by Curt Nemo's got an article out on it
[36:27.040 --> 36:32.560]  Newt tells a lie about his attendance at Bohemian Grove and there's the scan from
[36:32.560 --> 36:39.720]  the anal sent to me by a widow of a industrial tycoon I'll just leave it at
[36:39.720 --> 36:45.600]  that other stuff she told me was private I was I was I was talking to a
[36:45.600 --> 36:51.200]  Houston lady who separately had contacted Tex Mars and told him the same
[36:51.200 --> 36:56.480]  story and she was talking about her husband who was since dead and he had
[36:56.480 --> 36:59.440]  little owls all over the house and he basically worshiped him but he would
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.080]  never tell her what it was all about and that's the thing you can watch the
[37:03.080 --> 37:08.960]  footage from Bohemian Grove and you can think that oh well they're just a play
[37:08.960 --> 37:12.720]  what do you think plays came from they're up on the stage it's religious
[37:12.720 --> 37:17.680]  it's done all stylistically you're out in the church whether it's pagan
[37:17.680 --> 37:21.400]  Christian whatever you're out there as a practitioner you're out there as a
[37:21.400 --> 37:28.280]  parishioner watching the priest class the anointed ones up on the stage and and
[37:28.280 --> 37:31.400]  I was there and to test it with my cancer when we stuck in in 2000 I'm like
[37:31.400 --> 37:36.360]  well that's pretty neat they're like just shut up and and these old men were
[37:36.360 --> 37:43.280]  just like oh and really getting off on it I was but but they didn't get off half
[37:43.280 --> 37:46.720]  as much as what happened when they bring the body of the child the effigy
[37:46.720 --> 37:52.160]  they say on this flatback wagon drawn by Clydesdale horses big black Clydesdales
[37:52.160 --> 37:56.840]  and they bring it over behind these black sheets I'd seen up there in the
[37:56.840 --> 38:00.200]  day on the other side of the pond down here at the front the idol over on the
[38:00.200 --> 38:04.200]  other side is that and whatever went on behind that I mean it was smacking
[38:04.200 --> 38:09.440]  grinding of teeth super old for creepy I mean you want to know what the guy
[38:09.440 --> 38:12.640]  feels like you know in the fictitious not really fictitious that's why they
[38:12.640 --> 38:16.960]  said bye bye Kubrick eyes wide shut when he you know he stumbles into the
[38:16.960 --> 38:21.360]  satanic meeting and they're all acting really weird and creepy I've been there
[38:21.360 --> 38:26.560]  okay the only difference is they don't have super models in there have an
[38:26.560 --> 38:31.720]  orgies okay it's well I guess they do have male super models in there having
[38:31.720 --> 38:35.480]  orgies with them that's what's going on and again I was in there four hours
[38:35.480 --> 38:39.560]  being whistled at Mike was there with me what's what we finally had to hide in
[38:39.560 --> 38:43.640]  the woods I guess we were go back 12 years ago I've I was about you know
[38:43.640 --> 38:47.760]  60 pounds lighter than I've got when I got fat and ugly but the point is is
[38:47.760 --> 38:51.760]  that is that Mike and I were being whistled at like well like it was
[38:51.760 --> 38:56.720]  peppy lapieu you know the skunk that chases everybody and chases the cat around
[38:56.720 --> 39:01.600]  the black and white cat it was like that peppy lapieu was chasing us old men
[39:01.600 --> 39:06.760]  were whistling were greens workers were laughing at us and I knew a little bit
[39:06.760 --> 39:09.680]  about it and I figured out by the end that's why we were able to stay in
[39:09.680 --> 39:12.960]  there we got questioned by Secret Service and others and we just said oh
[39:12.960 --> 39:16.160]  we're with this certain campus we know enough about the lore we had an inside
[39:16.160 --> 39:20.840]  source so but I knew our time was running out so we head out till it got
[39:20.840 --> 39:24.640]  dark sure enough the ritual happened as it does every year July 15th and we got
[39:24.640 --> 39:28.240]  out of there and then somebody broke in and got the footage we'd already made
[39:28.240 --> 39:31.400]  copies then we mailed that copy we'd already made a copy of that and they
[39:31.400 --> 39:36.680]  erased that I mean it was crazy and I got some death threats over it but here
[39:36.680 --> 39:41.280]  is Newt Gennrich in fact I'm gonna play it later oh wait I don't think Luke
[39:41.280 --> 39:48.000]  bleeps the Nixon president Nixon taking the Lord's name in vain I know that
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.920]  offends a lot of people including myself because I'm God fearing that means
[39:52.920 --> 39:55.600]  sometimes I don't stub my toe I don't say something I shouldn't the point is
[39:55.600 --> 40:00.680]  is that a check that radowski video because I think he leaves Nixon's GD's
[40:00.680 --> 40:04.160]  in there and so we have to find that spot and just fade it down during that
[40:04.160 --> 40:09.320]  when we do play that so we've got that coming up because it's a great video
[40:09.320 --> 40:14.040]  because it illustrates all of Newt Gennrich's lies I mean he's just there
[40:14.040 --> 40:17.600]  saying you're crazy doesn't exist we have footage you have him photos of him
[40:17.600 --> 40:21.320]  there and we have all these other world leaders talking about it I only wish
[40:21.320 --> 40:24.960]  Luke would have used the David Gergen confrontation video I've got or David
[40:24.960 --> 40:28.400]  Gergen doesn't deny he goes and doesn't deny the ritual and gets
[40:28.400 --> 40:36.720]  threatening this is the Carl Rove to five administrations okay let me go
[40:36.720 --> 40:49.440]  ahead and get into the really hardcore news Iran is run by a theocracy Iran is
[40:49.440 --> 40:55.120]  funding Hezbollah in kind of a stalemate against Israel Israel's funding
[40:55.120 --> 40:58.160]  domestic groups inside Iran trying to overthrow them they've done it a couple
[40:58.160 --> 41:01.760]  times the last few years the US the people that run the US are involved as
[41:01.760 --> 41:06.000]  well people that run Israel are involved and that's the big mega banks and
[41:06.000 --> 41:12.880]  world companies because they ran I ran in the 20s 30s and 40s up into the
[41:12.880 --> 41:16.720]  early 50s and really enslaved the people there Muhammad Mosaddegh gets
[41:16.720 --> 41:20.880]  elected he's pro-west anti-communist and he says listen we're gonna keep 25% of
[41:20.880 --> 41:27.560]  our oil money to build up Iran and they said no you're gonna give Anglo-American
[41:27.560 --> 41:32.920]  oil what's BP today you're gonna give us all the money you get nothing and he
[41:32.920 --> 41:38.200]  said no we're gonna get 25% come on that's what you standard give a private
[41:38.200 --> 41:43.640]  landowner you can read his letters in America we just want 25% and so they
[41:43.640 --> 41:49.040]  funded the Muslim quote extremist Shiites in this case who runs Iran today
[41:49.040 --> 41:54.280]  to overthrow him and they did it by blowing up mosque shooting groups and
[41:54.280 --> 41:58.920]  protesting Shiite clerics and people and then they blamed it on Mosaddegh and
[41:58.920 --> 42:02.880]  that's declassified called Operation Ajax you just type it in pull it up it's
[42:02.880 --> 42:06.720]  NPR AP Reuters Herman Roosevelt wrote a best-selling book on it before he died
[42:06.720 --> 42:15.280]  in the late 90s he was a CIA section chief he led the CIA slash MI6 team in
[42:15.280 --> 42:19.200]  53 to do it they printed out tens of thousands of handbills where Mosaddegh
[42:19.200 --> 42:23.480]  took credit for it they overthrew him executed his entire leadership put him
[42:23.480 --> 42:30.080]  on house arrest the rest of his life and double-crossed the Shiites and put the
[42:30.080 --> 42:34.800]  Shah in the little prince they set up Savak over the years a million people
[42:34.800 --> 42:39.320]  disappeared tortured rape death killing the Iranians he was to say got mad and
[42:39.320 --> 42:46.120]  the Shiites were double-crossed and were double devil mad and then down the road
[42:46.120 --> 42:50.920]  night late 1970s the Shah is unpopular he's actually building the country up
[42:50.920 --> 42:54.160]  though he thinks the West is double crossing and he starts doing deals with
[42:54.160 --> 42:59.360]  Italy starts doing some deals with Russia uh-uh he gets a 24-hour cancer you
[42:59.360 --> 43:03.840]  know things get overthrown he goes to France dies of a cancer they fly in
[43:03.840 --> 43:10.680]  iotola Humaney the government on record did Western governments they give him
[43:10.680 --> 43:14.680]  our weapons deals they do this hostage deal to blame Carter as a double-cross
[43:14.680 --> 43:18.680]  then they give him the weapons systems it's called Iran contra now I don't know
[43:18.680 --> 43:23.360]  the moolas are still quote working with the West but there's some weird back
[43:23.360 --> 43:27.320]  channels and double deals going on you don't believe me you can pull up AP
[43:27.320 --> 43:34.760]  Houston Chronicle Wall Street Journal New York Times from 2007 and 8 that guys
[43:34.760 --> 43:39.880]  just type this in Halliburton given waiver to sell oil filled equipment to
[43:39.880 --> 43:44.920]  Iran when they have sanctions for decades that nobody can sell oil field
[43:44.920 --> 43:49.120]  equipment and refinery equipment to Iran that's why they've got more oil they
[43:49.120 --> 43:52.360]  can take a stick at but they can't refine even half of what they need for
[43:52.360 --> 43:57.600]  gasoline so they sell raw oil to China and others in Europe and they get back
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.280]  gasoline and the embargo saying you're not going to sell oil and you're not
[44:01.280 --> 44:03.920]  going to ship gasoline in that's what they're trying to set up right now that
[44:03.920 --> 44:09.560]  is an act of war so Cheney has this deal that he had when he was the CEO and
[44:09.560 --> 44:13.520]  then after where only Halliburton can sell them oil filled equipment about the
[44:13.520 --> 44:19.120]  report said about 10 times what it was actually worth and Halliburton
[44:19.120 --> 44:26.440]  technicians are in Iran still I mean so so so there's some weird hanky
[44:26.440 --> 44:31.480]  panky going on you know the CIA and the globalist aren't just in control of the
[44:31.480 --> 44:36.120]  Saudi Arabian Wahhabist and of course they are in control of those guys and
[44:36.120 --> 44:40.240]  give them Libya and try to give them Syria and everything else I mean this is
[44:40.240 --> 44:53.000]  this is happening everywhere and it just goes on and on and on so I don't know
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.200]  how deep the ties are I don't know how scripted this is there's a lot of double
[44:57.200 --> 45:01.120]  and triple crossing I mean look at bin Laden work for the US publicly Saddam
[45:01.120 --> 45:05.200]  did I mean there's always double crossing you don't know there's no honor
[45:05.200 --> 45:09.400]  amongst these people so you have no idea with the globalist and their minions
[45:09.400 --> 45:15.840]  what's happening all I know is that there's a real war inside Iran right now
[45:15.840 --> 45:20.200]  blowing up military bases blowing up missile bases blowing up police
[45:20.200 --> 45:25.040]  headquarters blowing up police universities blowing up intelligence
[45:25.040 --> 45:29.440]  agency universities assassinating people and Israel has now come out and
[45:29.440 --> 45:34.160]  admitted in their newspapers yeah we're doing it which is a provocation and Iran
[45:34.160 --> 45:39.240]  says okay we're gonna start targeting Israelis all over the world now sure
[45:39.240 --> 45:44.280]  that plan to try to kill a Saudi ambassador in DC that turned out to be
[45:44.280 --> 45:47.760]  staged but and Iran said it was but now they're saying okay we'll go ahead and
[45:47.760 --> 45:57.320]  do it now what happens guys the atomic clock fell down off the wall we put that
[45:57.320 --> 46:00.360]  back up for me I want to get that mounted that little that guy keeps I don't
[46:00.360 --> 46:03.760]  know what's going on with him maybe he's with Al Qaeda that evil that evil
[46:03.760 --> 46:11.720]  clock come to Africa Tangier Tangerine to make it all better all of this is
[46:11.720 --> 46:17.160]  going on all of this is happening and now Iran says they're gonna start
[46:17.160 --> 46:22.120]  striking back which makes this war become two minutes to midnight and they're
[46:22.120 --> 46:27.920]  threatening to block the straight they're threatening to attack other targets
[46:27.920 --> 46:33.200]  ready to attack Tel Aviv US troops by the thousands are landing in Israel the
[46:33.200 --> 46:38.760]  point is this is all accelerating towards war and the Iranian people in
[46:38.760 --> 46:45.040]  major polls over 70% on average our fans of the US they're smart people they
[46:45.040 --> 46:48.760]  know our politicians have taken over they know we've been hijacked they know
[46:48.760 --> 46:53.000]  most of us don't want war with them they know their moolas are out of control
[46:53.000 --> 46:59.480]  and they just want to have good jobs and good lives and go to the movies with
[46:59.480 --> 47:03.560]  their children and it is going to be a horrible crime against Iran to attack
[47:03.560 --> 47:07.800]  them in a giant bombardment it's going to spray radiation from these bases
[47:07.800 --> 47:12.240]  being bombed they're fully uranium all over the world it is going to
[47:12.240 --> 47:17.280]  undoubtedly make the moolas go from being unpopular to being extremely
[47:17.280 --> 47:20.720]  popular and the Iranians just like Americans would when they're under attack
[47:20.720 --> 47:24.760]  are going to line up behind the government and are going to go to full
[47:24.760 --> 47:30.000]  war with the West and the criminals that run the West are going to use that as a
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.560]  pretext to take all of our basic liberties and freedoms that's what's
[47:35.560 --> 47:39.920]  happening let's go ahead and go to Darren McBreen's man on the street do
[47:39.920 --> 47:48.280]  Americans want war with Iran here's that piece war in the Middle East now
[47:48.280 --> 47:53.240]  appears eminent as the United States Britain the European Union and Israel
[47:53.240 --> 47:58.800]  but the final touches on an embargo on Iran and warships are sailing to the
[47:58.800 --> 48:03.400]  Persian Gulf last Friday the US and Israel announced that they will have a
[48:03.400 --> 48:08.440]  massive exercise in the Persian Gulf it will include thousands of US and
[48:08.440 --> 48:12.920]  Israeli soldiers and will test multiple air defense systems against incoming
[48:12.920 --> 48:17.880]  missiles and rockets meanwhile Iran will also be conducting wargames in the
[48:17.880 --> 48:22.440]  Persian Gulf and have already launched a military maneuver near its border with
[48:22.440 --> 48:27.440]  Afghanistan now there's a lot of war games going on in the Persian Gulf the
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.400]  United States Israel are participating in a massive war game Iran at the same
[48:32.400 --> 48:37.600]  time could that be a recipe for disaster I think there's a lot of war games that
[48:37.600 --> 48:41.640]  go on all the time of different sizes I don't know if this is much different I
[48:41.640 --> 48:45.960]  don't know if disaster is the word but I think you're not in a good situation
[48:45.960 --> 48:49.720]  right now should we intervene for Israel don't you think Israel has a
[48:49.720 --> 48:53.560]  capability of protecting themselves I definitely think there's a case to defend
[48:53.560 --> 48:57.880]  Israel for what it is might not be the strongest case but should we invade
[48:57.880 --> 49:02.720]  Iran for Israel no I think that's a weaker case I feel like Israel can and
[49:02.720 --> 49:06.440]  can take care of themselves but it doesn't hurt to have somebody backing
[49:06.440 --> 49:11.080]  you up well it's not about weapons mass destruction a nuclear bomb is all about
[49:11.080 --> 49:15.280]  natural gas and oil and we have the island even have the natural gas and
[49:15.280 --> 49:20.400]  that's what America wants and we are not that but the media is liars and they tell us our lives and we
[49:20.400 --> 49:23.320]  just got to go with the lies because they have the power to spread the lies
[49:23.320 --> 49:28.760]  presidential candidate Ron Paul said the increasingly severe sanctions imposed on
[49:28.760 --> 49:33.240]  Iran in response to its alleged nuclear weapons program are steps that will
[49:33.240 --> 49:36.960]  eventually lead to war the first thing you do when you go to war you put you
[49:36.960 --> 49:42.840]  put boycotts on me you blockade a country it is in many ways an active war we
[49:42.840 --> 49:47.280]  assume that we have to do it through force through sanctions and threats and
[49:47.280 --> 49:53.360]  intimidation and and and secret maneuvers to overthrow their regime it just
[49:53.360 --> 49:57.000]  doesn't work I think we're I think we're punishing them I think it's
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.720]  retributive definitely whether or not it's with the aim of pushing them into
[50:00.720 --> 50:04.800]  open war with us I don't know I feel like if you're just pressing somebody
[50:04.800 --> 50:08.400]  you're only gonna push them more the other direction anyway I think that the
[50:08.400 --> 50:13.040]  US has been provoking a lot of people for a long time I'm just think sometimes
[50:13.040 --> 50:16.960]  the United States needs to worry about the United States you know it's really
[50:16.960 --> 50:20.760]  not that many differences between us and them if you really think hard about it
[50:20.760 --> 50:23.600]  the people or would that be the government the people I'm talking about
[50:23.600 --> 50:29.440]  the ordinary ordinary Iranians are very different from the image that we have of
[50:29.440 --> 50:32.960]  the Iranian government well what do you think's gonna happen to oil prices if
[50:32.960 --> 50:37.040]  there is a conflict well definitely the oil prices gonna go up because even
[50:37.040 --> 50:40.400]  going to hold on to the aisle the Middle East have the most as we know as a
[50:40.400 --> 50:45.280]  fact do you think our economy could take it not right now the economy is falling
[50:45.280 --> 50:50.200]  the dollar is dying everything is you know going deteriorating and there's no
[50:50.200 --> 50:54.320]  solution right now I mean I feel like any major conflicts in the world right
[50:54.320 --> 50:58.280]  now are gonna keep impacting the declining economy are you concerned
[50:58.280 --> 51:03.080]  that something bad's gonna happen out there not I am we all should be cancelled
[51:03.080 --> 51:08.400]  the whole war should be cancelled because not about us is about the whole world now
[51:08.400 --> 51:12.920]  President Obama is prepared to use military force to prevent Iran from
[51:12.920 --> 51:17.800]  acquiring a nuclear weapon that's if sanctions and so-called diplomacy fail
[51:17.800 --> 51:25.920]  I'm Darren McBreen for Info Wars Nightly News all right great job there with
[51:25.920 --> 51:30.800]  Darren and we premiered that report that he shot yesterday with people out on
[51:30.800 --> 51:34.520]  the streets of Austin Texas and we're gonna have some more reports obviously
[51:34.520 --> 51:42.320]  tonight 7 o'clock central at info wars news dot com so here we are at the
[51:42.320 --> 51:47.960]  precipice and now it's confirmed it's another acceleration another throwing
[51:47.960 --> 51:53.240]  down to the gauntlet that top Israeli generals in the major newspapers and
[51:53.240 --> 51:56.800]  including the New York Times Fox News have come out and said yeah we're the
[51:56.800 --> 52:02.080]  ones blowing up your missile bases we're the ones killing your scientist and
[52:02.080 --> 52:06.120]  we're gonna expand it and the newspapers are running with the headline
[52:06.120 --> 52:17.800]  covert war on Iran prudent strategy New York Times a prudent strategy I'm not
[52:17.800 --> 52:20.840]  endorsing assassinating people from pulling stuff up but I guess it is
[52:20.840 --> 52:24.960]  better than bombing hundreds of sites and having a full bore war but what are
[52:24.960 --> 52:30.160]  you gonna do when Iran starts blowing up stuff in Israel oh my gosh Iran killed
[52:30.160 --> 52:38.320]  an Israeli general or or or or or or bombed an Israeli base I mean the media
[52:38.320 --> 52:43.400]  is gonna freak out and say that's wrong in fact I've seen the media here say
[52:43.400 --> 52:50.160]  it's terrible China is torturing people or it's terrible Syria may have
[52:50.160 --> 52:54.320]  tortured people well yeah it's wrong if Syria is torturing people but how is it
[52:54.320 --> 52:59.800]  good when our government tortures but then the other guys torture and it's
[52:59.800 --> 53:04.760]  it's bad it's okay when we torture it's bad when they torture I mean everybody
[53:04.760 --> 53:08.000]  knew when North Vietnam would torture our troops we'd say well you can't
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.360]  believe anything they say in a confession because you may have been
[53:11.360 --> 53:16.840]  tortured but just this week that US Marine who's Iranian that they've got
[53:16.840 --> 53:19.720]  and say a spying and trying to blow stuff up or whatever I don't know if it's
[53:19.720 --> 53:24.240]  true but stuff's getting blown up over there and the media saying well it's a
[53:24.240 --> 53:28.960]  mula court so it's not a real court well it's a public court I'm not saying
[53:28.960 --> 53:33.600]  it's kangaroo compared to our courts probably but I mean our government's
[53:33.600 --> 53:37.840]  saying we won't even have a court you you won't even get a trial you'll just
[53:37.840 --> 53:42.600]  disappear and no one will even know we arrested you I mean that's four or five
[53:42.600 --> 53:49.000]  levels of magnitude above Iranian tyranny
[53:49.000 --> 53:56.960]  that's beyond what China does on paper that's beyond but there's still this
[53:56.960 --> 54:02.080]  lecturing though of oh my gosh they're saying after a trial they're gonna
[54:02.080 --> 54:07.480]  execute him of course we're just gonna execute you without a trial but that's
[54:07.480 --> 54:13.160]  reasonable see see when North Korea was shooting down our aircraft and
[54:13.160 --> 54:17.960]  torturing our fighter pilots our fighter bomber pilots I mean it was terrible if
[54:17.960 --> 54:20.560]  they were being tortured and of course there's the famous cases of them
[54:20.560 --> 54:24.880]  blanking Morse code torture torture remember those famous cases from the
[54:24.880 --> 54:28.880]  Korean War those were true stories they would get up there and under serious
[54:28.880 --> 54:32.280]  torture that they knew Morse code and people like what's that blinking he's
[54:32.280 --> 54:39.160]  doing it's Morse code torture torture torture the bad guys torture the good
[54:39.160 --> 54:42.920]  guys don't torture torture has been proven to not be good for real intel
[54:42.920 --> 54:48.440]  it's good to get fake confessions it's good to scare people it's good to say
[54:48.440 --> 54:51.640]  okay we're gonna torture you and there's people that are tough enough the
[54:51.640 --> 54:54.880]  Pentagon admits this that you can torture them and they won't do what you
[54:54.880 --> 54:59.480]  want that you cannot break them so you know what they do and they did this with
[54:59.480 --> 55:04.280]  KSM they brought his wife and little kids in he started and they said we were
[55:04.280 --> 55:08.480]  gonna we're gonna torture him we're gonna kill him and he started crying and
[55:08.480 --> 55:13.080]  our government bragged about this crying and said I'll say whatever you want and
[55:13.080 --> 55:18.680]  he confessed they tortured him by the way for five years before he broke and
[55:18.680 --> 55:24.520]  they said okay bring his kids in boom instant instantly broke one of them was
[55:24.520 --> 55:28.800]  like six years old or something he started bawling he said I'll say
[55:28.800 --> 55:34.520]  whatever you want and then he confessed to bombing buildings that hadn't been
[55:34.520 --> 55:42.000]  built until after he was arrested after he was captured you cannot become the
[55:42.000 --> 55:47.400]  devil to defeat the devil you cannot put on the ring of Mordor to defeat Sauron
[55:47.400 --> 55:53.920]  it doesn't work that way you don't give up your humanity to defend humanity you
[55:53.920 --> 56:01.080]  don't do it and that's the thing about lying sure you can put out decoys so the
[56:01.080 --> 56:05.600]  enemy fires at those and not you but that's that's as far as deception goes
[56:05.600 --> 56:10.640]  before it becomes immoral camouflage to make your tank look like the jungle
[56:10.640 --> 56:17.320]  behind it that is that is a lie but when you start staging terror attacks which
[56:17.320 --> 56:23.720]  is an army manuals to blame your enemies and the argument is well our enemies do
[56:23.720 --> 56:27.760]  it yeah you bet the Soviets would commit atrocities and blame it on US
[56:27.760 --> 56:35.480]  back forces so now we do that you bet we did they did a fictional account of
[56:35.480 --> 56:39.560]  really a quasi true story it's a composite in the quiet American the
[56:39.560 --> 56:44.320]  Graham Green movie but it's off the novel go rent that movie go watch that
[56:44.320 --> 56:49.480]  about about Indochina when the French were pulling out the CIA blowing up
[56:49.480 --> 56:54.560]  Marcus to blame it on the Communist they need those atrocities you do not
[56:54.560 --> 57:01.560]  become the devil to defeat the devil it does not work you become what you're
[57:01.560 --> 57:09.720]  fighting and then some and that's what we've done okay I'm going to come back
[57:09.720 --> 57:13.400]  and get the number out and then get into more news we got Mike Adams coming up I

[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:30.240]  all right my friends we are now into hour number two we've got an expo day of
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:34.560]  Newdy Gennrich and his occultic activities coming up with amazing a
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:38.200]  researcher and filmmaker Luke Radowski popping in in the third hour we've got
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.600]  Mike Adams the health ranger with big breaking news coming up I want to take
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.440]  some of your calls ahead of that the toll-free number to join us here is 800
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:54.760]  259 92 31 800 2599 231 but the Iran situation has ratcheted up another gear
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.520]  and there's really only one more gear now that's open major military against
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:06.440]  military conflict but the war is on it's now being called a war no longer even a
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:11.480]  covert war by the New York Times Fox News so again I have to always toot my
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.960]  horn just to counter all the lies is the system doesn't want us to admit this is
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:21.080]  hurtling into a hot war and it's already a covert asymmetrical war I mean I
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:24.960]  remember up till the day they attacked Iraq the disinfo was saying Alex Jones
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:30.160]  is full of baloney there's not gonna be a war with Iraq that way anti-war groups
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.560]  could never get activated because they would always just say yes we're getting
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.640]  ready for war but we're not kooks and you're like that doesn't make sense it's
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.520]  just a psych warfare tactic where no we're not gonna have war and you're
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:48.360]  like but you just said we are oh see it's a mind game oh so it makes it all
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:52.400]  about arguing that they are getting ready for war instead of yeah they're
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.960]  gonna have war let's not have it it's like oh well we're not really sure if
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:59.880]  we are they never let it become cut and dry even though it's already cut and
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:04.680]  dry so I told you five years ago and showed you the White House orders for
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.640]  covert war to be launched and terror attacks and inside Iran using al-Qaeda
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.080]  groups and one Kurdish group that's now all confirmed but now the point is it's
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:19.000]  gone from an attack every month or so to every day there's stuff going on and so
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.480]  Iran didn't want to look weak they realize their whole country now knows
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.400]  they're being attacked before they'd say oh that bridge just blew up on accident
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:29.040]  all that refinement just blew up oh there was a car bomb but we don't know
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.200]  who did it oh somebody bombed that base and killed those generals but we're not
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:38.720]  sure yeah now it's like yeah Israel the US are doing this remember you're Israel
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.640]  in the US that doesn't mean all the Israelis all people America that is the
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.440]  special interests that want war that want the political distraction and so we
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:54.800]  hear all of this and this isn't like a football game going to war real troops
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.320]  die real troops breathe depleted uranium real troops come home and you know
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:03.760]  commit suicide because they're so depressed over killing innocent people you
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.120]  see the troops that are psychopathic and evil they get hired to be police on
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.200]  record they that's who they've tried to recruit they hire some good militarized
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:15.880]  police as well let's slip through but but but those that have a soul get really
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:21.000]  screwed up by it and they go crazy they commit suicide and you know they knew
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  from World War one don't make somebody serve more than one tour in serious
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.120]  combat there are people who've served I looked it up nine tours nine and of
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.600]  course it was well known that it was wrong to make people serve all these
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.720]  tours so I remember in 2005 six seven getting callers going nobody's serving
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:44.880]  three or four tours liar and I'd be like you in the military no but it's wrong to
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.720]  make them serve that many tours I know that my brother was in Vietnam you're a
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:54.000]  liar now it's like yeah they do serve six seven eight tours yeah what's wrong with
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.080]  that well you're finding out what's wrong record it's seven times the previous
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:03.880]  per capita record of suicide you care about the troops I mean that's like
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:10.360]  tires are rated to drive 50,000 miles and you drive 300,000 miles on tires and
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:16.000]  you wonder why they all blow out on you they're putting 300,000 miles on 50,000
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  miles tires and there are some people that can handle it and some people that
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.840]  can deal with it they've done this has been studied for thousands of years but
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:31.600]  it's been codified the last hundred or so if it's a true moral cause defending
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:36.680]  your family men can fight and fight and fight and fight and fight and fight and
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:43.520]  fight and fight but if there's any moral question most people that do immoral
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:49.120]  things self-destruct because humans are designed to be part of a greater tribe
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:54.920]  and aren't designed to do bad things when we do bad things our own body our own
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:05:02.200]  psyche turns against us okay it's a self-destruct switch when you're out on

[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.720]  his big editorial piece out 10 reasons liberals and progressives should vote
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:25.160]  for Ron Paul gonna be joining us on that subject and I report I didn't get to
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.000]  yesterday guys that's why I really want to get Adam's on they couldn't come on
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.400]  yesterday he had an article on natural news linking to some the documents or
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.560]  Monsanto it's now come out what we already knew actively owns the ambassadors
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:44.080]  internationally they're twisting arms and and giving countries other
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:49.240]  political deals and money if they let GMO in it's something like Monsanto
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:55.560]  controls US ambassadors and diplomats I want to raise that with him as well I've
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:09:00.800]  also got coming up later punished for not crying thousands of North Koreans
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:06.400]  face labor camps for not being upset enough about death of Kim Jong-il and
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:09.640]  the North Korean government admits you had millions of the citizens come out
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:14.560]  and worshiping fake cry for hours and I pointed out that if you didn't fake cry
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.560]  for the little demonic dictator who knows when he really even died and this is a
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.640]  pack of liars why believe anything they say might be still alive me who knows
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:28.360]  that they're sent to forced labor camps because there's a tiny inner party that
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:31.880]  just sits around their hind end and fancy uniforms all day and drives like
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.560]  50 year old automobiles cuz and the whole place is rotting and falling down
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:40.240]  but they don't care they get to strut around and act powerful and tough the
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:44.280]  government can always find scum that just wants to run around lording over
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:48.720]  people and then that's what tyrannies are and the whole society rots and the
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:53.080]  majority of the population is raised in barnyards they live in sheds this is a
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:57.400]  even come out in the Wall Street Journal has had your people that got back out
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:02.640]  of the country break it down and they raise them in barnyards and then and
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.360]  then the doctors check the women when they're ready to you know be fertile
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.960]  they put them in pins together and then they send the males and females to
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:15.440]  different camps and the babies are taken as if eggs from a hen and are
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:21.600]  totally programmed by the state and reportedly a lot of these North Koreans
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:25.520]  can hardly talk now and that's kind of what was done to black people in this
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.240]  country when they were slaves he would keep the males out in pens there's
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.880]  manuals on this and you wouldn't ever let them really learn any reading or
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:38.280]  writing if they ever used too good in English that was uppity and they were
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.960]  beaten generally there was different variants of of the way slaves were kept
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:48.280]  of actually studied it there was some areas where it's more like a mafia and
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:53.880]  you had slave owners who actually had huge posses of blacks were basically
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:58.600]  like their family and we're all armed and and with actually some rebellions in
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:02.960]  Alabama that I read about I'd heard about this I looked it up where there
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:08.520]  were big plantation owners that began to arm the other slaves and you know just
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:11.960]  basically turned it into like big gangs so it was also a gang form of slavery
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.200]  where everybody was basically you know a house slave that really wasn't even
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:21.320]  slavery it was more of like like large gangs but but then people would get
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.480]  really upset about that it was only what one and a half percent of southerners
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:31.480]  actually had slaves so it was also a an elitist thing used to leverage out the
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.760]  rest of the economy that's why slavery was already pretty much dead when the
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:38.160]  civil war came but I'm now digressing and I said I'm gonna call another history
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:45.200]  lesson here punished for not crying thousands of North Koreans face labor
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.800]  camps for not being upset enough about death of Kim Jong-il their hardline
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.720]  regime is punishing those who do not cry at the death of the dictator Kim Jong-il
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:59.720]  according to report sentences of at least six months in labor camps are
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:04.120]  apparently being given to those who did not go to the organized morning events
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.880]  Fidel Castro makes you our news is always look at the people love Castro
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:13.400]  they're out there in the millions yeah you get your monthly dole of money you
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.000]  got to live on cut if you don't go to it and if you talk bad you go to a labor
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.560]  camp of course I've been told by people that want to set up you know these new
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.800]  utopian systems that I would have to be reeducated since I didn't want to go
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.240]  along with it all anyone who criticized the new leader Kim Jong-un is also being
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.720]  punished those who try to leave the country or even made a mobile phone
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:38.480]  call out we're also being disciplined it has been claimed oh yes and we've got
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:46.040]  all of the crying it's just so wonderful to worship and cry and and to
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:51.640]  march in and phalanxes you know you know like zombies to engage in the worship
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:56.280]  fest truly truly disgusting oh here's what I mentioned big public service
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.720]  announcement this is in a whole bunch of different publications right now
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:06.440]  Daily Mail has it Reuters has it chemical found in deodorants face cream and
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:15.600]  food products is discovered in tumors of all all breast cancer patients and it's
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:21.000]  not just the bisphenol a but the parabens that's in most your soap
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.960]  everything I keep telling my wife this I'm like honey they put all this in here
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.040]  on purpose they pick these and we've got all the quotes of the science are and
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.520]  going back into the 20s when they were discovering all this I mean hundreds of
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:35.160]  quotes we're gonna know a new report on it later in the week or next week on all
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:41.280]  this and they know exactly what they're doing okay so but but regardless let's
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:46.600]  just get it out parabens are a chemical compound on everyday toiletry products
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.520]  the fact that parabens were present in so many of the breast tissue samples does
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:55.320]  justify further investigation say study leaders they chemically widely used as
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:59.080]  preservatives and cosmetics food products and pharmaceuticals has been
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:02.360]  found in tissue samples from 40 women with breast cancer a number of studies
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:07.000]  since since 98 have raised concerns about the potential role of parabens in
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.800]  breast cancer as they possess estrogenic properties again that's why
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.680]  they're put in there it is known to play a central role in development growth and
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.480]  progression of breast cancer parabens are a chemical compound on everyday
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:26.040]  toiletry products including moisturizers makeup shaving foam tanning
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:33.720]  lotions and toothpaste again almost all the chemists were eugenicists and hired
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:37.320]  to do this it's all a sickening joke and how many clothes to have to show you
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.280]  where they say we're gonna put it in everything we can't escape at the
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.800]  printer ink the food and yes it's hard to get away from this but it's worth it
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:51.120]  man I do not want my wife getting breast cancer I mean I wanted to live and I
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:57.920]  don't want God's creations being hurt I mean this is just out of control folks
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:03.360]  and I've got daughters and it upsets me and it hurts men's organs as well where
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:09.280]  these where these estrogen mimicers tend to precipitate out the testicles the
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.800]  well the breast tissue men are growing breast everywhere even if they're
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:17.240]  skinny it lowers your testosterone level it feminizes it changes other
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:21.520]  endocrines and hormones and it affects the prostate and all these cancers are
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:29.320]  skyrocketing let's go to calls here Carl in Oregon thank you for holding sir
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:35.240]  Alex my best friend and ever an America's best friend the Paul Revere of
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:41.040]  the 21st century how are you brother I'm okay man how are you doing the freezing
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.000]  but up here in the northwest but yeah we're having a strangely dry years
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.200]  probably all those chemtrails that we're having shooting across the sky they
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.420]  are manipulating the weather they just they say they are they're quote they're
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:55.160]  quote geoengineering but they won't tell us what they're doing that's
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:59.280]  classified exactly now another thing that's going across the sky there's
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.640]  other roars in the thunders from the last couple of three weeks here on and
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:07.280]  off they're sending them over over the northwest here the FAA 18 depth 16
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.440]  whatever naval Navy SEALs or Air Force fighter jets are flying over early in
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.080]  the morning for the past couple of weeks there is a lot of military movement
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:19.840]  going on the last six months they I've seen a lot of tanks on 18 wheelers a lot
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:25.040]  of armored vehicles a lot of helicopters going south they are well family
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:31.320]  being sent to Kuwait I mean I've been told by military people across the board
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.520]  they've been told it is going to happen now that doesn't mean it's going to
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:39.120]  happen but but but when there's a really good possibility it is they tell them
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.800]  it's going to happen and they're told the US is going to back Israel up in a
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:47.640]  strike on Iran they believe Iran is going to strike back one attack and Iran
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:51.280]  saying they are now and they're already being attacked and so it's it's
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.320]  hurtling towards craziness my friend well I believe in seeing is believing
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.160]  Alex that's that's one of the best names there
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:02.600]  NDA Bill how can a citizen go in and find out access and how to Google it
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:07.320]  perhaps to be able to see the articles in the NDA NDA Bill now I hear you
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:11.880]  that's a good question I appreciate your call the ACLU Ron Paul and full wars
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.160]  calm I mean the drugs report probably linked to three articles two or three
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.640]  weeks ago that we wrote that had links to the Library of Congress Thomas LLC
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:27.760]  gov and and then would show the section saying this doesn't affect citizens but
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:32.040]  then look at this section it says but it does if the president wants it to and
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.040]  you have no rights and so I don't have those sections in front of me but we've
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:40.680]  covered them at nauseam and again that's how lawyers write these contracts a
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:46.000]  contract may say one thing but unless prescribed and then you go to that other
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:52.160]  section it tells you the key provision and so I mean I can play the clips of
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:57.880]  the senator saying it affects citizens it's a worldwide battlefield declares
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.800]  global war let's the president bypass Congress gets rid of positive comment
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:06.000]  taught us but military on the streets of America and the biggest issue is it
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  allows the secret arrest of citizens and disappearing into a black hole and then
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:15.440]  it's got some gravy bestiality you know that's kind of the cherry on top so that's
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:19.920]  kind of the side dish of just weirdness that the military can fornicate with
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:26.000]  barnyard animals or whatever they want I guess I can't I can't
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:34.280]  alex on in Oregon you're on the air Alex it's alexi on hey buddy hey man

[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:13.120]  Oklahoma Brad thanks for holding hey Alex hey buddy hey I'm a new listener
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:17.720]  just started probably about two months ago listening to your show welcome I'll
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:22.600]  tell you it's opened my eyes almost freaked me out a little bit that our
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.960]  governments is corrupt and this dangerous listen about 18 years ago and I
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:31.000]  really started waking up I was freaked out all the time when I realized while
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.800]  the media is lying on purpose while they really are setting up a world
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:37.000]  government while they're anti-human while they really want to break up the
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.040]  family while they want my guns while they want my land while these are
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:47.080]  tyrants yeah it is freaky it is just it's freaked me out but I'm ready I'm one
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:50.680]  your side I believe everything you're saying I believe this government's out
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.240]  of control and we've got to do something about it well again I don't want you to
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.640]  believe everything I'm saying it's all right there though just go look at it
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:00.440]  for yourself I mean I want people to even get more knowledge because a lot of
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:03.400]  times I'll just cover a gestalt of something because there's so much going
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:08.840]  on its reality is so much deeper than even what some talk show house can set
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:14.720]  up here and you know jibber about it's mind-boggling it really is it's just my
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:18.400]  deal is I've been trying to tell people about it and I just don't think I'm
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:22.520]  informed to tell enough to tell people about it and they just don't want to
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.840]  listen they don't want to they just want to live there there's one watch the
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:32.520]  football game or well look if you're recently awake Brad and and and and you
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.360]  don't feel like you you know you're an orator yet or you can put it all
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:39.480]  together the best thing is hey have you seen this website or hey tell me what
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:44.160]  you think of this film and just make a copy of a DVD or tell folks you know
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:49.280]  about this radio show or or other you know ideas or say what do you think of
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:53.880]  Ron Paul just an icebreaker because a lot of people already feel so disempowered
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.640]  that they'll just kind of ignore you when you bring something up because
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.080]  they're thinking what can I do they don't understand what an opportunity it is to
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:08.000]  be awake and to then be a participant in the universe actually standing for
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.120]  what's right and changing the course they they don't know the power they've
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:16.360]  got the number one thing is it isn't that people don't want to wake up they
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:21.560]  most of them feel powerless Brad so they then just to decide to make it all a
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:27.120]  big joke yeah yeah I agree that's that's what I've been running into so I'm
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:32.320]  gonna start taking your advice I've been pushing Ron Paul he's I mean he is the
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.800]  he's the candidate that can change this around I can I can assure you that and
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:41.400]  I I just really appreciate your show and I'm addicted to it now I listen to it
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:45.000]  every day well God bless you sir I'm addicted to getting up here and
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.440]  exposing the control freaks as well I mean once you start getting into
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:56.000]  reality it is addicting and there's no rest it's just wow let's talk to Richard
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.840]  in Indiana Richard you're on the air welcome good afternoon Alex hey buddy my
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:05.440]  wife and I wanted to expand our reaching out to others and we thought we'd get on
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:09.960]  Skype I went to start page types in Skype but before I went to the main
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:17.120]  website a link came up Microsoft bought by buys out Skype for eight and a half
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:22.600]  billion yep and I know most of your guests come on Skype and I wanted do you
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.920]  know anything because I haven't been able to find anything are they databaseing
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:32.680]  anything or will they be what we do with video Skype Microsoft spies on its
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:38.040]  users 24-7 I don't know because of the technology of Skype if it'll screw it
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:42.960]  up if they try to put backdoors on it and tracker systems that's why they you
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.120]  know they say in IT everything Microsoft buys degrades because they do add the
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:51.800]  surveillance to it but I don't think that's happened yet there are alternatives
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:57.000]  to Skype a bunch of them we just use Skype because it's prolific now you know
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.920]  it's kind of the Heinz ketchup or Hunt's ketchup it's like the Ford or Chevy so
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:08.240]  our guest all pretty much have it so we can say hey you got Skype but they're a
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:11.360]  bunch of alternatives in fact what are some of the alternatives to Skype and
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.800]  others a bunch of them well this eye chat could be used I don't know if that's
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:22.480]  checked by Apple well I mean oh again they shouldn't be tracking people so
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:27.400]  people should get in their face but if they're they are tracking it don't let
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:31.360]  that stop you from using their systems yeah man it's kind of like people say
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.200]  well I don't want to go on YouTube make political videos they'll come get me
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:39.040]  folks if we don't stand up against them they're going to get us if we get scared
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.760]  then they're going to win if we let the fact that they admit now they're
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:47.840]  surveilling everybody intimidate us they win just because they're a bunch of
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:51.920]  crooks doesn't mean we shouldn't stand up against them we're on the march the

[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:16.880]  liberty is no vice
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:24.480]  okay my friends we are back and we are joined for the rest of the hour by Mike
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:28.360]  Adams the health ranger another great central Texan reaching millions of
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:32.760]  people every day their natural news dot com and all the books and other great
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:36.680]  work they're doing leaked documents reveal us diplomats actually work from
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:41.520]  Monsanto and a few quote mainstream articles have this but buried in them
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:45.120]  that this has come out I want to get into that also dr. Andrew Wakefield has
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:49.840]  filed suit against the so-called journalist that put out the reported
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:54.560]  hoax that his research had been discredited we're working on getting him
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:59.400]  on very soon but I know that Mike Adams Wakefield is here also as well can speak
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:04.320]  to that and also he's got a new editorial out about Ron Paul 10 reasons
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:08.360]  why liberals progressives and others should vote for Ron Paul over Obama and
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:13.320]  joining us via video Skype from his farm slash ranch outside Austin is Mike
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:17.040]  Adams Mike great having you back with us hey Alice great to be back with you
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.800]  thanks for having me on today let's tackle this situation with Monsanto
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:26.160]  first that you guys break down I mean we've known Monsanto owns judges we've
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:29.800]  known that they force this stuff into third world countries Europe you know
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:34.280]  even if 95% in France don't want it it gets crammed through but now we learn
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:39.680]  the diplomats who can get other trade deals money to governments are actually
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.720]  the they're not even there in the interest of America or the US it's all
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:48.960]  for Monsanto this is amazing yeah it's pretty clear that the diplomats are
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:53.240]  really working for Monsanto they do things like they threaten trade wars
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:35:00.240]  against countries that resist the Monsanto seed imperialism and you've
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:03.880]  seen that come out in WikiLeaks documents as well but in addition Alex we
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:07.800]  have other breaking news on Monsanto today that may be even bigger if you'd
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:11.680]  like I can cover some of that it's some just stunning new research that that
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:16.040]  breaks that completely disintegrates Monsanto's excuse about why GM foods are
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.640]  safe you want me to cover that well that's what's always amazing when you
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:21.560]  come on you're always breaking something big sure break it right here thank
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:26.200]  you all right yeah this is this is just starting to hit the internet new research
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:31.560]  published in the science journal cell research indicates that the RNA of
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:36.120]  plants actually passes through the digestive system goes into the blood and
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:41.080]  starts to affect the organs of mammals now what this means is that the main
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:45.960]  excuse of Monsanto that GM foods are safe no longer holds any water because
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.880]  they say the RNA the DNA doesn't get absorbed or digest it digested so it
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:55.720]  doesn't matter in truth it does matter here's what's being found now this is
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:03.120]  published again in cell research and it shows that the RNA of rice plants goes
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:07.880]  into the blood attaches to the liver cells and alters liver function
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:14.160]  modifying LDL cholesterol levels in the body what this means Alex this is going
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:18.200]  to open up a whole new branch of science dietary science it means that we're not
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:22.560]  just eating vitamins minerals fiber carbohydrates and protein we're eating
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:27.120]  DNA we're eating RNA but this is amazing though we already know from the
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:31.280]  hundreds of studies going back 20 30 years that no matter what GMO crop it is
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.480]  when they alter one trait it changes randomly hundreds or even thousands of
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:43.640]  others and in every case it's they're showing in my skinny pigs cows massive
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:49.080]  infertility organ failure within three generations as you know total
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:53.680]  sterility I mean this is this is Armageddon that's absolutely right and
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:58.160]  until now there wasn't really an understood mechanism for explaining why
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.400]  these things are happening why are their high allergies why the high rates of
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:06.440]  infertility and so on now this mechanism reveals why because when we eat these
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:12.200]  foods Alex we're eating information and this information alters the expression
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:16.280]  of our internal organs now this is crucial to understand it even goes back
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:20.920]  to American Indian lore and legend you know when they say when you eat let's
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:25.560]  say a buffalo you become the buffalo or the buffalo becomes part of you you are
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:29.400]  what you eat and until now science thought that just meant the vitamins and
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:33.640]  the minerals now we're understanding that you become the information in a
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:38.600]  small way of the animal you eat or the plant you eat well the ancients knew
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.840]  this they said if you ate red meat it would make you more aggressive make you
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:47.640]  get bigger cause a larger CC size brain and we've now seen this in carnivores of
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:51.240]  course we become what we in fact here's a study that came out three years ago
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:55.080]  there's hundreds of these international journal of biological sciences doesn't
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:59.320]  get more prestigious Monsanto's GMO corn linked to organ failure study reveals
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:04.080]  and it goes on in a study released by the international journal of biological
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.880]  sciences analyzing the effects of genetically modified foods and mammalian
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:11.480]  health researchers found that agricultural giant Monsanto's GMO corn
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:16.840]  is linked to organ damage in rats I mean this is massive my friend it's
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:21.680]  massive and it's just blowing away Monsanto's excuse this is from Monsanto's
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:26.000]  own website I'm going to quote from them directly they say quote there is no
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.880]  need to test the safety of DNA introduced into GM crops they also say
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:37.200]  there is no need for or value in testing the safety of GM foods in humans so
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:42.120]  they're saying no testing necessary because they say that the DNA in the
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:47.120]  RNA doesn't go into the human body we just know in every species it basically
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.840]  causes species implosion and total disintegration of the species and of
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:54.760]  course this is all just a eugenics operation the globalists all have their
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:58.560]  seed vaults are obsessed with only organic will eat none of what they produce
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.920]  this this is eugenics I mean we've got all the documents yeah it is and it's
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:06.200]  there's even another layer to this it goes beyond all that if you think about
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:10.960]  that these crops are artificially modified to produce insecticides and
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:16.200]  they're not normal they're not wild crafted crops it means that the more GMO's
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:22.280]  we eat Alex the less human we become I mean in a very chemical way well they
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.680]  admit that suddenly our DNA is all breaking down almost everybody's is
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.840]  damaged the sperm counts down by 87 percent cancer is all exploding across
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:33.840]  the board I mean there's no doubt this stuff is again with rats or guinea pigs
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:38.160]  they can see three generations in just a year with humans the generations don't
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:42.640]  generally start a next one for 20 years we're now two generations into just the
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:46.480]  beginnings of this and we're already seeing massive devastation imagine when
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:50.600]  we're a full two generations or three in well they plan to have their new world
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:55.240]  order in by then and basically cover up what they've done that that's right I
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:40:00.040]  think this is the way to disintegrate the future of the of the human gene pool
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:04.520]  of those that they want to eliminate or control now getting back to the study
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:07.800]  there's an important quote that your audience will want to hear it showed
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:11.920]  that the micro RNA this is a quote directly from the study published in
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:18.240]  cell research September 20 of 2011 it says quote the micro RNA have been
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:23.040]  widely shown to modulate various critical biological processes including
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:27.920]  differentiation that means cell specialization apoptosis related to
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:32.600]  cancer proliferation the immune response and the maintenance of cell and tissue
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:36.800]  identity well that right there tells you that if you eat the wrong information
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:41.080]  and I mean that literally if you eat the wrong information you can start to grow
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:46.640]  cancer cells and your fertility is just going to plummet it's now science which
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:51.920]  means that Monsanto's excuse about GMOs being safe is quack science it's just
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:56.680]  corporate marketing it has no basis whatsoever in reality so now everybody
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:00.600]  out there who is opposed to GMOs like you and I are in most of your audience we
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:06.200]  now have yet another scientific reason to have a lot of caution about eating GMOs
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:10.680]  because it changes our human expression it changes who we are it makes us less
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:14.040]  human well that's right and then just the mercury alone the vaccines are
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:19.440]  screwing up the DNA that's admitted and you can see the effects of it but to
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:23.320]  look at the huge hoax that is Monsanto and other big GMO companies that brought
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:29.960]  us Agent Orange and you know aspartame and all of these these plagues they
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:35.240]  cold-bloodedly literally control the judges they'll infect your crops as
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:40.080]  plants aren't one mommy one daddy you know 1% of your corn or soybean is found
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:44.120]  to be theirs it blew into your field it contaminated you you have your seed
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:48.640]  purchase records that it's 99% your seed but but there's a little bit of their
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:53.040]  genetics because they infected you the courts rule you're in trouble this is
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:57.560]  like if a robber breaks in your house and rapes your wife you go to jail
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:01.000]  because you were trespassing when he came in and raped your wife and killed her
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.040]  with a claw hammer and then knocked your teeth out and then poured gasoline on
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:09.600]  your children you go to jail the cops come and say you trespass you're like
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:14.000]  but he's here burning my house down I mean I mean literally it's that it but
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.880]  it has to be that ridiculous Europe doesn't want it Asia doesn't want it
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:23.200]  but still it pops up everywhere they go buy plots of land other companies do
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:27.480]  they plant it in the ditches it's a war and they've said that we're going to
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:33.080]  take over and and and they're prosecuting a war against us it's this pattern of
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.680]  total runaway criminality that we see everywhere Alex it's not just an
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:40.440]  agriculture where like you said it's completely ridiculous Monsanto's seeds
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:44.880]  contaminate your farm and then you were guilty that's crazy but look at MF
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:50.120]  global the same thing they steal your money and no one gets indicted no one
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:54.760]  gets prosecuted it's just outright theft and in the world of Monsanto and
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.680]  seeds and pharmaceuticals it's the outright theft of intellectual property
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:02.400]  and the criminalization of all of those common everyday people who are not
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:07.760]  connected to the global elite so now law no longer applies it's who you know it's
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:11.280]  who you're connected to it's whether you're deeply embedded in the system of
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:14.880]  corruption that's running our nation that's what determines whether you're
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:18.880]  guilty or innocent not whether you violated any laws or laws of nature for
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:23.480]  that matter amazing amazing you know I want to put up on screen natural news
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:28.080]  calm you've got extremely powerful headlines and I want to go through these
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:33.000]  quickly here and then go back into Monsanto 10 reasons why even Democrats
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.640]  and liberals and progressives are choosing Ron Paul over Obama Dr. Andrew
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:43.960]  Wakefield Seuss BMJ journalist Brian Deere for defamation study statin drugs
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:49.640]  linked to higher diabetes risk action alert pro fluoride fanatics pushing
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:55.040]  Pinellas County Florida Commission to reinstate water fluoridation and it just
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:59.560]  goes on and on right there which one of those stories you want to tackle first
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:03.080]  Mike well let's go to run Paul because as soon as I posted that story last night
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:07.840]  at about midnight Texas time it immediately began to go viral Alex it
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:11.480]  was it was really wonderful and it's got a lot of shares today a lot of people
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:16.640]  are having positive comments that article is about why liberals progressives
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:24.240]  Democrats should choose run Paul over Obama because Ron Paul is a better more
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:28.080]  high integrity more consistent person with the things that even liberals care
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:33.200]  about such as legalizing medical marijuana ending the wars for getting
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:36.560]  rid of the secret military prisons protecting free speech and so on so
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:40.640]  he's he's a better conservative than all the conservatives and he's a better
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:45.600]  Democrat than Obama because he's a guy of principle yeah let's go over some of
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:49.120]  these Ron Paul supports to criminalizing marijuana and ending the war on drugs
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:52.680]  which is an out of control federal power grab the basis of their old martial
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:57.040]  law grid now Ron Paul supports the freedom to choose what you eat and drink
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.960]  including raw milk but the Obama administration has launched an all-out
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:05.440]  war and armed raids on raw milk farmers including those wicked on the show
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:12.240]  al-Qaeda arms and it goes on Ron Paul would seek to eliminate FDA censorship
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:16.320]  of the scientifically validated health claims of herbs nutritional supplements
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:20.520]  and natural remedies number four Ron Paul was shut down secret military prisons
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:24.200]  like Gitmo but Obama wants to expand those and fill those prisons with
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:29.080]  Americans in DAA Ron Paul is anti-war Obama is pro-war you prove it with
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:32.840]  documented links Ron Paul wants to end the Fed and stop bailing out wealthy
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:36.120]  bank shares while Obama the Wall Street sell out so the other Republican
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:40.240]  candidates Ron Paul does not need a teleprompter to tell you what he believes
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:45.160]  in his message his remain consistent for over 25 years Ron Paul is not really a
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:49.680]  Republican he's a constitutionalist libertarian Ron Paul wants to legalize
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:53.720]  free speech again number 10 Ron Paul wants to criminally investigate the
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:59.000]  crooks in Washington and there you go real hope and change and not a globalist
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.960]  being attacked by the entire media corporate prostitute system that that's
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:07.320]  the that's the shield of goodness right there my friend yeah that's it anyone
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:11.200]  the press attacks that's the person you should probably vote for because they're
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:14.240]  the ones who are going to dismantle the status quo and bring down that whole
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:18.640]  system of deep corruption that now infects Washington and well we can't
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:21.480]  even call it the mainstream media anymore it's the crooked corporate run
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:25.480]  media I like how you said we shouldn't use the term mainstream media anymore
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:30.600]  what what term are you using Alex I haven't found one to describe treacherous
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:39.120]  mercenary propaganda systems zombie control signal Joseph Gerbil
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:46.720]  acolytes I think I mean I think dinosaur whore media I don't know what do you
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:51.520]  think Mike and we need to get one term start using it as a meme we do need one
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:57.320]  term I agree I kind of like when you use the term corporate run media I also like
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:02.200]  fake media but I haven't I haven't figured out one doesn't really just stick
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:07.920]  with us yet we do need one term that hoax media yeah mainstream hoax media is
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:11.760]  when you hear the word mainstream it's hoax media yeah that's a good idea
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:20.000]  corporate whore hoax media tell out treacherous traitors scumbag teleprompter
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.960]  reading arrogant people that think you're sheep media does you see the
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:30.000]  official Fox News postcard for Christmas they put out publicly showing their
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.640]  viewers a sheep no I didn't see that one but nothing surprises me anymore in
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:39.440]  fact info wars of course has been covering the you know that the elections
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:44.600]  here the the republican nomination election elections in depth and really
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:48.280]  exposing a lot of the lies of the media how they just they continue to leave
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:52.520]  Ron Paul out and again this is the reason that you should support Ron Paul
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:56.200]  because the media doesn't want him to win and why don't the Washington
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:59.960]  insiders want him to win because he would dismantle so much of the system
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:05.360]  that keeps those those corrupt fat pigs in Washington well-fed at the public
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:10.600]  trough well it's crazy about the global rulers as they think they've got a plan
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:14.480]  but I've really studied them they've got a plan but it's just wrecking even
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:18.920]  their own system I mean all this GMO is blowing back on them all of this stuff's
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:23.240]  coming back on them they're like I used to do this I mean really they're just a
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:27.120]  bunch of crooks that can't even control each other it's just it's just like you
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:31.120]  said what you say about 10 minutes ago it's just a criminality running rampant
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:38.280]  just like it's like an orgy a feeding frenzy a frothing berserking mad dash
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:44.640]  gold rush of feeding on sheep yes exactly what it is and intertwined and all
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:48.760]  that is all this modification of our food and all the medicines you know the DSM
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:54.240]  5 is about to come out now that's the the psychiatry Bible that has all these
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:58.960]  new definitions about water diseases and the DSM as we know should stand for a
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.000]  dollar sign manual because it's all about how to bill to make money while
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.680]  you're you're putting kids on amphetamine drugs and street drugs and
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:10.080]  altering their brains actually shrinking their brains because of these
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:15.560]  amphetamines I mean it's just one more assault on sanity in America and I got
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:18.960]  to keep wondering every time I I hear Paul Craig Roberts on your show or
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:23.480]  Gerald Salente how long can this keep going on before something really
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:28.880]  fatally breaks in the system and I wish I knew the answer to that I don't I may be
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.600]  some of your guests know the answer but this can't go on we know that that's
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:35.720]  why I even told you privately the other day Alex I've been spending a lot of
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:39.680]  time on my ranch getting prepared I've actually been working a little bit less
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:43.920]  and doing more farm work and putting in irrigation systems I I got to get ready
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:47.280]  to demand all your all your listeners got to get ready no I know I mean I've
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:50.280]  moved to the country got a well and stuff and storeable food and stuff but I
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:54.360]  mean my wife's like you always say get ready get home get get ready get get
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:57.800]  get things in place they say this well isn't deep enough we got to drill it
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:01.680]  deeper we got to get everything together what we are building a big bigger wall
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:06.200]  and fence around just the house itself and once this I hope it doesn't implode
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:09.640]  but if it does implode anybody comes on my property you know you might as well
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:15.360]  jump in front of a moving train but it is certainly getting crazy Mike yeah
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:20.000]  yeah absolutely it is and we we you and I and others who everybody who who's
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.320]  active out there we got to find that balance obviously we we serve the public
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:27.800]  interest in what we do but we also got to make sure that we cover our own basis
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:31.360]  so we can stay healthy we can stay safe so that we can continue this fight on
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:35.280]  the front lines you know we we're gonna make sure we're in good shape too well
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:40.600]  hey I've lost almost 30 pounds bro and I'm not healthier and we've got we've
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:44.360]  always had most the GMO out but we're really getting more neurotic about it
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:48.400]  because it's not neurotic we've just been eased into all this death and I've
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:52.080]  got to not be lazy looking at my children looking at my wife we are

[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:27.720]  sit up there in their fancy suits with teleprompters and a glistening studio and
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:32.080]  say over and over again he will not win he will not be the nominee member he
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:35.880]  wouldn't get one percent of the vote he wouldn't come in second place he's
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:41.560]  nothing he can't win you can't have him he's a kook I mean it is just mind
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:47.800]  control treating you like you're a complete moron and here's an example of
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:52.360]  these people the Borg saying you will be assimilated you will fail I got news for
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:57.600]  us our article info wars.com Ron Paul has already won by getting the ideas out
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:02.200]  there let's go to the sickening clip of MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell hey Lawrence
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:07.840]  if you looked at Alexa.com info wars.com is many times bigger than MSNBC.com
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:13.320]  look at your ratings your top shows might have 400,000 viewers this show has
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:18.000]  millions a day you're a legend in your own mind and you're the incredible
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.360]  shrinking mouse that roared so go ahead bleed out destroy yourselves in front
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:28.480]  of all of us here's the clip then you have to look at the fraud in the campaign
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:33.160]  the republican fraud which is the libertarian Ron Paul who is not a
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:39.120]  candidate for president he is not going to get the nomination he is not going to
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:42.240]  be given a prominent speaking role at a republican convention they can't have a
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:47.960]  guy up there saying what he says he is in there for the to push his ideas and
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:53.480]  for whatever individual reasons he has so if you take Ron Paul out of this and
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:57.080]  if you take out all those independent voters who went out there today for Ron
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:01.160]  Paul what would have happened to Huntsman Huntsman is the real second here he came
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:04.280]  in in the real second he came in in the real second came in in the real stop
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:09.640]  right there huntsman works with Obama what is the ambassador to China works for
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:16.280]  Obama globalist all the way puts out fake racist dads against Ron Paul is a
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:20.560]  total turkey and you've got the establishment saying a little bit of
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:23.280]  truth there that Ron Paul's here to get ideas out that's right we win by
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:28.240]  fighting the question is look how far we've already come he is second all
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:34.920]  across the country or first Ron Paul has a shot despite all in the past if they
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:38.040]  said somebody couldn't win people would drink the Kool-Aid it shows their
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:41.720]  waning think of where they'll be in four years with Rand Paul or somebody else
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:48.840]  they are shrinking we are rising how pathetic is this Mike Adams well it
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.560]  even with their best efforts to try to crush Ron Paul's support base they
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:56.840]  haven't been able to do that and that's what's amazing about this if it had been
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:57:01.920]  a fair horse race Alex Ron Paul would have won Iowa and he would have won New
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:06.520]  Hampshire already he would be the number one Republican candidate for
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:10.560]  president so they can't stop it and that's that's the beauty of this like
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:14.160]  you always say it's not about the person it's about the ideas and the
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:18.760]  principles and those are bulletproof those are person proof even if Ron Paul
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:23.360]  doesn't win his ideas will win as long as we continue to advocate those ideas
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:27.240]  throughout the culture of America that's right we have the superior ideas
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:32.240]  we're challenging them we're getting in the ring and every time we fight we get
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:37.320]  exponentially stronger and that's what's scaring the system so bad right now and
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:43.640]  what's amazing is that they when Obama signed the NDAA he actually shoved a
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.840]  massive number of Americans over into the Ron Paul camp because remember all
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:53.640]  those people who apologized to you after Obama signed that people woke up they
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:58.480]  said you know what you are right we are living in a police state now it's law and
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:04.320]  so the more that the tighter they try to grip that their grasp like the line from
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:08.640]  Star Wars Lord Vader you know the more you try to tighten your grip the more
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:12.800]  we slip through your fingers and that's true with the rebels in America who aren't
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:16.920]  even rebels we're just constitutionalists and restoratious yeah we don't want to be
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:21.360]  ruled by absolute criminals who ship guns into Mexico to blame the Second
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:24.920]  Amendment and get caught and don't get trouble or in that global taking your
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:29.040]  bank account or any of it I mean there's no end to what these crooks will do
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:34.400]  these are bad people and they think you're morons we'll be right back I want

[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:42.400]  creature Newdy Gennrich about Bohemian Grove Dr. Andrew Wakefield
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:46.080]  and we're gonna get him on soon as he lives here in Austin has sued the
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:50.040]  British Medical Journal journalist Brian Deere over defamation now this is the
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:52.440]  guy that came out and just said Wakefield made up his research about
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:57.600]  autism links and and and gut disorders and children which it turned out there
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:00.640]  was a bunch of other duplicative studies were never published by major
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:06.200]  hospitals and of course it turns out that Wakefield was not lying but they
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:11.040]  ran this media hoax that he'd been discredited and so I wanted to get the
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:15.720]  breakdown from Mike Adams on this front
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:20.360]  exactly as you said the lawsuit has been filed in Austin Texas and it does
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:23.600]  name the British Medical Journal and Brian Deere what's important understand
[02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:28.640]  is that this is not even a debatable issue of whether the BMJ and Brian Deere
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:33.200]  lied they they they knew they lied they smeared him intentionally they
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:39.000]  distorted the facts they were on an agenda to try to discredit Dr. Wakefield
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.960]  and that agenda so far has worked for them because as you saw the what are we
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:48.680]  calling it now the the corporate horror hoax media ran with that story and
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:53.280]  attacked Dr. Wakefield and basically discredited him and in doing so
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:59.320]  discredited any link between vaccines and autism well Dr. Wakefield is gonna
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:02.480]  have his day in court and we're gonna see the truth come out about this and the
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:06.720]  truth is that Dr. Wakefield's research was meticulously conducted it was
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:11.400]  extremely well documented and the article published by the British Medical
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:16.080]  Journal is factually untrue and in fact they knew it was untrue that's going to
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:19.440]  come out in court and we're gonna turn this situation around and actually end
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:23.600]  up discrediting the British Medical Journal that will happen this year in
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:27.600]  2012 and I'm sure that you're gonna be probably the first organization to
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.560]  break this story as Wakefield comes on your show to give you more details yeah
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:34.840]  he told me a few months ago about this but said don't talk about it and I know
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:38.920]  he's everything codified and they're ready to go public here in the near
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:42.400]  future all need to pray for him because the system undoubtedly could engage in
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:47.080]  some dirty tricks against him in response to this and the two or three
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:50.160]  minutes left that we have here Mike what are some of the other big articles
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:53.960]  that you're looking at right now what we've got articles about statin drugs
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:59.000]  causing or being linked to diabetes one of the big things about these
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.960]  pharmaceuticals that the drug companies don't talk about doctors don't even
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:07.280]  know and of course the hoax media doesn't talk about is that many of these
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:11.040]  drugs actually cause other diseases for example it's not just statin drugs that
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:16.160]  can cause diabetes it's also psychiatric drugs that can cause diabetes so let's
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:20.000]  say you go in and you get on a psychiatric drug because you feel
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.440]  depressed but your your blood sugar is normal and fine well after a few months
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:27.800]  on a psychiatric drug an anti-depressant you may then start to have
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:32.160]  blood sugar dysregulation and you could get diagnosed with type 2 diabetes so
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:36.400]  then they put you on a diabetes drug then you start to have liver dysfunction so
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:39.920]  then they put you on a liver drug this is how it works Alex this is called
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:44.480]  repeat business no it's like crack dealers giving you some free crack it all
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:48.400]  causes chain reactions and they know this full well they knew that Prozac type
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:52.800]  drugs were increasing suicide when they got it approved and it took us decades
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:57.720]  to get it on the stinking insert well yeah and look at what vaccines cause as
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:03.760]  well vaccines promote liver dysfunction and kidney disorders so if you if you
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:08.960]  own a dialysis clinic and and they're growing all across the country people
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:12.240]  got to go in and get their dialysis done then of course you're gonna promote
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:16.560]  vaccines because that's gonna give you more dialysis business the whole thing
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:22.080]  is a hoax Alex they know that vaccines and pharmaceuticals and GMOs these are
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:27.880]  all business creators if for sick people for for all the profits that are
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:33.600]  built on the suffering and the deaths of innocent people who you know they
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:36.800]  should be given a chance at a healthy life but instead they're being pumped
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:40.200]  full of chemicals and DNA damaging components and foods and medicines
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:44.400]  everybody is being victimized in America if you eat GMOs if you take
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:48.360]  pharmaceuticals you are allowing yourself to be victimized by the system
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:53.240]  you're getting on a express train to Hades Mike Adams great job look forward

[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:21.920]  suggestions for the so-called media of this country that claims to be the media.
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:27.680]  We should have a contest for that and we know we've got prostitute traders mainstream
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:34.840]  whores global zombie controllers what's your idea. Right three different choices
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:39.600]  from my point of view one would be the lying propaganda media another would be
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:44.400]  the propaganda prostitute media. The mind control media the mind control
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:49.880]  prostitute media yeah. Yes mind control media is very good also propaganda media
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:55.720]  just two words to cover such a large thing as this spread out media in our
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:59.880]  country. I like Decepticon media I mean even though that's like you know it's
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:04.640]  supposed to be an evil robot but they are Decepticon artists they're like Decepticon
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:10.160]  media. That's right. Really enemy broadcasting system. That would be
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:17.440]  great. Tokyo Rose I mean I'm sure maybe you could just pick one for each day of
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:30.720]  the week. Exactly a wolf media sheeple control system. Any other ideas. Absolutely I ran
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:33.800]  out of my three Alex you took it from there and I think you came up with some

[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:19.320]  syndicate media. I appreciate your call good to hear from you. Josh in Seattle
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:25.600]  you're on the air welcome. Hi how are you. Good sir welcome. I just came on the
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:28.920]  army like two years ago and I've been a security guard ever since I have two
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:33.240]  things for you some information what's going on in April in Seattle. The first
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:37.360]  thing is like about like a week ago they found like a bomb inside the Chase Bank
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:42.200]  over here in Othello Park and ever since then it could be we'll go on
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:46.400]  comanews.com you'll see it I was gonna do like search it up there and it never
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:49.960]  released a video the suspect or anything it has released the pictures of the guy
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:54.720]  the guy has a mask on everything else and like a week after that the TSA started
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:59.440]  flooding the tunnel system here in Seattle and the other thing is that
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:04.440]  let me stop you I am aware of this and our government has been caught this
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:07.840]  it's not even our government we got to stop calling it that the criminal
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:13.120]  hijacker group posing as our government the pretender government the
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:16.720]  criminal government the fast and furious crime syndicate drug dealer government
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:21.440]  the mafia government I mean it just never ends they have been caught
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:27.800]  attacking their own embassies with small bombs and and fake bombs and things
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:32.140]  like that over and over again as a pretext but now now the TSA is stomping
[02:12:32.140 --> 02:12:37.040]  around your town yep all over the flooding the tunnel system you see
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:41.960]  walk around downtown every day and I see one that was armed with an automatic
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:49.240]  console and another thing is that my security boss has asked me to do a
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:53.920]  dignitary security in April and it's with Rex Tillerson and David Rockefeller
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:57.720]  coming here for a three-day conference and I've been trying to get more
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:01.360]  information from my boss the only thing he told me was that he kind of feels
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:04.200]  like it's something like the Bilderberg group coming or something like that yeah
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:10.560]  Rex Tillerson is the head of ExxonMobil yeah and he's coming to Seattle for a
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:17.480]  three-day conference in April when is his lordship coming I did my boss will
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:22.000]  not give me the specific dates because this top secret but I mean those are
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:26.040]  just some CEOs and old bankers they don't have any power yeah they do have
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:29.640]  Bilderberg steering group meetings and that's what it sounds like where they
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:33.160]  only have like 25 of the top people they meet five or six times a year in
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:37.840]  different locales around the world and that's what it probably sounds like yeah
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:42.040]  and I got tasked to the security for the people that when they come to town in
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:45.160]  April so I'll give you some more information about that also with
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:48.720]  Occupied Seattle I've been trying I got these little business cards made out
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:52.680]  it has like infowars.com on the front has a little Star Wars thing on the back

[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:15.240]  big stencils for spray painting legal and lawful areas and we're going to sell

[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:48.400]  years thank you so much great job free rider in Pennsylvania thanks for
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.040]  holding you're on the air. Good afternoon Alex how are you doing? Doing alright my
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:59.000]  friend. First off I know that a lot of people that get on the air with you do
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:08.040]  this but I especially need to do it because what you're doing is a God
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:12.240]  send to wake up the people that are out there that have been asleep for many
[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:18.600]  years I don't think that people really realize the extent of the danger that
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:24.720]  you put yourself in by broadcasting this information every day and you sir or a
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:32.000]  patriot and we need more people like you that are willing to go out on the limb
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:40.240]  with us all and and can cut and say I'm here if you're gonna come come and take
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:45.960]  me well we do but but I've gone over this a lot and I appreciate your kind
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:51.320]  words I've counted the cost and looked at what we're facing and if I just turn
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:56.320]  tail and run or go along with the system the system they're setting up is so
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:01.920]  nightmarish there's nowhere to run or go it's an anti-human anti-family system
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:05.840]  and the and the people running it are so pathetic somebody's got to call their
[02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:11.960]  bluff and the system hasn't killed me there's a great video by a black Ron
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:16.520]  Paul supporter black American forget his name but I want to get him on the show
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:19.840]  I've seen a lot of his videos he's got hundreds of thousands of viewers and he
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:22.680]  drives around his car talking about Ron Paul and he's saying people are talking
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:25.960]  about assassination of Ron Paul which his brothers worried about and others and
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:30.840]  he says too late he said look at Martin Luther King only made him bigger look at
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:34.720]  what happened to Jesus you're not gonna stop an idea that way and the system
[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:38.280]  knows it now that sometimes they still do it though just because they're nasty
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:41.960]  but I mean I'm gonna drive home today and that's the number one most dangerous
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:46.560]  thing I do I still do it I put my kids in the car totally dangerous cars are
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:49.440]  the most dangerous thing out there in this country in this world because I
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:52.440]  want to go places I put my little sweeties in the car and I try to drive
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:56.520]  safe knowing that but I mean I'm gonna take the risk because the risk of not
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:01.320]  acting is much greater and you know I've had a lot of life and death
[02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:05.480]  experiences in my life I had a lot of wild stuff happen to me as a child and
[02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:09.880]  as a teenager and I think all of those things were so I would be fearless later
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:14.360]  in life and I realize life is so short I'm gonna be an old man if I'm blessed
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:19.400]  to become old wheezing and dying someday it's gonna seem like five minutes from
[02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:24.480]  now you know life just speeds by and so I'm just turning loose and saying you
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:28.800]  know what if they kill me whatever that's just the way it is I mean quite
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:32.240]  frankly I'm less worried about being killed than being locked in some dungeon
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:36.880]  for 30 years now that but you know what I've got a beautiful mind we've all got
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:40.880]  beautiful minds that's not even really a prison I feel sorry for those that would
[02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:45.040]  do that but but but I hear what you're saying I appreciate your kind words what
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:48.960]  do you think about diversions like Stephen Colbert to distract from Ron
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:53.600]  Paul is mulling a run in South Carolina to basically try to make this thing a
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:57.120]  bigger joke than it already is he wants to be up there with all the other joke
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:02.640]  candidates against the one real candidate Ron Paul he just dropped off I
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:06.440]  wanted to get his take on it I appreciate your kind words sir but I mean
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:12.880]  once you give up on the on the fear which and just realize this is the only
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:15.960]  course you you wonder how could you never have stood up against these people
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:20.120]  before I mean it's just when you realize the people that run the
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:25.680]  government run giant child kidnapping rings and it comes out in Congress and
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:29.880]  it comes out in the Chicago Tribune and it comes out in the BBC and no one gets
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:38.280]  in trouble I mean I got New York Daily News articles where CPS went public and
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:42.400]  said we're told to take healthy black kids and then they're taken to facilities
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:49.160]  and given drugs and pesticides till they die like rats and then they fire the CPS
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:53.240]  people and say all will investigate nothing happens
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:58.920]  okay the people running things murder children cold-bloodedly with them
[02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:06.200]  strapped down I mean I'm not supposed to I mean what I'm saying is I'm not
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:12.400]  doing something that is is is heroic I'm not doing something because if we call
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:17.080]  it heroic and I'm not saying you're wrong I understand this world telling the
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:21.480]  truth is a revolutionary act in a world of universal deceit I understand that but
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:27.520]  what I'm saying is when we see just doing the bare minimum as amazing and
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:33.640]  stoic and brave that kind of then makes some people think well thank God Alex is
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:38.480]  out there you know he'll he'll take the risk folks I'm here to get you to be the
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:43.320]  leaders you are I'm here to get you moving against the globalist because I

[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:46.280]  your calls David in Florida welcome sir hello hey hey Alex how you doing hey I
[02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:52.600]  got a couple things one is you're like in the Lord of the Rings or something and
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:58.680]  you're one of the fellowship carrying and you know you feel the evil and the
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:03.800]  rest of us kind of you know our like armchair people or something but I just
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:10.600]  wanted to throw that out there plus I I saw you on opium in Anthony and I don't
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:15.640]  know if it's a coincidence or not but on the 6th when he had that program about
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:21.320]  Ventura I made a comment out of 15 comments and I said I challenge you to
[02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:25.560]  have Alex on and question them about that and all of a sudden last night I
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:29.960]  see that you're you were on there and I was hoping you'd be just a little bit
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:34.920]  harder because they make fun of Ventura and you when you're not well I want to
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:38.000]  be clear I was on there like seven in the morning a few days ago and after I
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.880]  was on I thought man I should have talked about that guy calling me Iraqi
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:45.560]  savages I should have in this and that but I ended up working late that night
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:50.200]  and so I usually get up about 5 30 but I got up that day at about 6 30 made coffee
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:55.040]  was barely awake when you know they call them right where I called into their
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:58.560]  number they asked me to call about five minutes before and then I didn't know
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:02.400]  that guy was going to be on there they kept going where they were like putting
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:06.120]  me on and off the air so I don't even I never even went and watched the video
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:10.760]  the audio of what happened I don't know they edited me or were fading me up and
[02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:13.200]  down I mean I know I've been on there before and they you know placed up in
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:20.160]  the background and stuff but you know I was just trying to be even you know with
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:23.520]  the information but I was I mean I was clearly in defense of the tour right I
[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:27.080]  mean I made the you know made the points that I believed his story and didn't
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:34.160]  think that guy was credit credible I mean I'm asking you I haven't seen the
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:38.560]  interview I haven't heard the interview I mean so so be critical of me did it
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:44.160]  look like it was edited a very good and you defeated every one of their
[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:49.600]  arguments but I mean they are some there's some sneaky characters and they
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:53.840]  talk they called him a douche and and they were kind of making fun of you and
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:57.680]  stuff which I just you know they're I know but see with people like that when
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:01.720]  there's three hosts and they are in control of the phone line if you don't
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:07.000]  act a little friendly they won't even let you talk and so to even and that's
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:10.400]  why half awake I was just gonna be friendly but make my points because
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:14.320]  those type of guys I mean look it's an entertainment show it reaches a lot of
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:18.000]  people and I know they make fun of me but it doesn't matter because people are
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:22.760]  gonna go find the truth and so I don't mind being made fun of and I was just
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:27.080]  there to basically defend Ventura and you know that guy doesn't even know he's
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:30.520]  hooked in with Richard Pearl and you notice he kept saying I want to meet
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:35.080]  with Ventura I want to fix this and I've talked to Jesse I believe Jesse and
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:40.720]  Jesse is gonna go after him I'm just gonna leave it at that and so we'll see
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:48.800]  what ends up happening I also double-speak news is my suggestion but
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:52.960]  Alex you did great and I really love you and just keep doing what you're
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:56.320]  doing well thank you let me ask this question because they spin everything I
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:00.840]  said Kyle sounded scripted and the way somebody called in sounded like a way to
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:06.920]  get that going I wasn't saying Opie and Anthony were in on it to be clear but
[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:13.360]  when I was on as a talk show host I just kept hearing the on and off button for
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:17.300]  me being put on and off as a caller a whole bunch and at one time I said hey
[02:28:17.300 --> 02:28:21.640]  are you guys am I on air and they say oh we're censoring you the government is
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:25.640]  did it did it sound like I was getting my sentences out when you heard me on
[02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:31.200]  there they were cutting you in and out and making comment stuff like towards
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:36.680]  the end yeah that's what I thought my son my son came home and he's like let
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:40.040]  me listen to that those dirty right you know he was calling well here's my
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:42.840]  concern because I talked to Ventura in Tyrell a few days ago and I said hey
[02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:45.760]  you might want to hear that interview but I said just now at the end they said
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:50.680]  you believe Kyle now you believe Jesse's lying now and then I would say no I
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:55.280]  believe Jesse out here like they were putting me on and off so I don't know
[02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:59.720]  what they were I meant to go listen to it I got too busy but the point is is
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:04.240]  that when they asked that at the end of you know you don't believe in Turra do
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:08.920]  you did they let me get it out that I do believe in Turra oh yeah okay good
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:13.800]  they'd better because I mean I won't put up with somebody doing that we all
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:17.920]  believe him I mean that guy looks like he's almost mind-controlled I hate to
[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:21.680]  say that but you know it's funny you'd say that once I was on with Kyle he
[02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:27.760]  sounded childlike I mean didn't he sound like a little child yeah he wasn't so
[02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:31.640]  aggressive he was like a lot more aggressive when he was down with them
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:35.720]  and then all of a sudden he's like when you got on there he was like a total
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:40.560]  like you know see that's my problem too when people aren't aggressive with me I
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:44.080]  have trouble being aggressive with them then when somebody's aggressive then I
[02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:48.120]  get aggressive I mean that's just how I am but I appreciate your call we'll be

[02:31:17.240 --> 02:31:21.600]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:25.680]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:30.200]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:31:30.200 --> 02:31:34.360]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:38.920]  I sit down with big brother. Don't like those RFIDs.
[02:33:38.920 --> 02:33:44.920]  I got the blues. Got the blues about my freedom.
[02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:52.920]  Got the blues about tyranny.
[02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:56.920]  No shackles on me. Acoustic.
[02:33:56.920 --> 02:34:01.920]  He's played that studio for us before. I gotta twist his arm and get Jimmy in here.
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:05.920]  Great guy. Austinite.
[02:34:05.920 --> 02:34:09.920]  By the way, a pretty big musician about as big as it gets.
[02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:12.920]  I was gonna come to town a few months ago. I wanted to come to town to visit.
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:16.920]  And then some stuff came up and couldn't come to town.
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:19.920]  And in the next few weeks, he's probably gonna come to town.
[02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:23.920]  So we should have a pretty interesting fellow here with us in studio.
[02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:26.920]  I'm just gonna leave it at that. I mean, they say it's gonna happen.
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:28.920]  They got the plane tickets. They're coming here.
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:30.920]  But still, you gotta pinch yourself.
[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:37.920]  Life is so much more interesting than fiction could ever, ever be.
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:43.920]  Okay, coming up after Luke Radowski, if we are changed, leaves us here in about 15 minutes or so.
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:44.920]  I want to hit some news.
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:49.920]  UN soldiers brought deadly superbugs to Americas.
[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:52.920]  And Harvard Medical School and others have found this.
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:55.920]  So this is what the Haitians said with the UN troops.
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:34:58.920]  They said, we didn't have cholera on this island.
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:02.920]  We didn't have all these other things. Now they're here.
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:05.920]  And they said the UN's doing it on purpose.
[02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:08.920]  But now there's a big report on that.
[02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:11.920]  And also another one here out of RT.
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:15.920]  U.S. builds hospitals in Georgia, readies for war with Iran.
[02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:20.920]  And it goes on as the U.S. government admits they're building these hospitals ahead of the war.
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:23.920]  So very, very bizarre developments.
[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:25.920]  I mean, I guess it's not bizarre. It's happening.
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:29.920]  But it's still crazy that the world is hurtling towards this.
[02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:33.920]  Now, this next piece of news is up at infowars.com.
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:36.920]  You can also go to Luke's Facebook and Twitter.
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:37.920]  We'll give you those in a moment.
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:42.920]  But it's an article up there where Newt Gennrich caught lying about Bohemian Grove.
[02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:46.920]  Kurt Nemo wrote a story on it at infowars.com that has the video.
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:49.920]  Now, if you're a radio listener, this is powerful audio.
[02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:53.920]  But the video really makes it powerful because when he's, you know,
[02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:56.920]  having it brought up to him that gay prostitutes are there,
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:35:58.920]  we show the New York Post and other publications.
[02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:02.920]  Luke does where it says the gay porn stars get off the jets and go in.
[02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:06.920]  And Vanity Fair has reported this, People Magazine, all of them.
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:09.920]  I've been inside and been chafed around like it was Peppy Lapue.
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:14.920]  When I snuck in for four and a half hours with Mike Hansen, he's a witness as well.
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:17.920]  First time in my life I've had men whistling at me.
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:21.920]  And then I would kind of hurry away and they would giggle and laugh and begin,
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:23.920]  like, goblins running after me.
[02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:27.920]  And there's a clip of Richard Nixon here talking about it as well to Harper's Magazine.
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:33.920]  He's on Bahamian Grove now, the most GD, you know, thing bleeping you could ever imagine.
[02:36:33.920 --> 02:36:35.920]  I mean, we're going to have to bleep it out.
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:38.920]  But it's the whole video is at infowars.com.
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:44.920]  But the point is, is that Newt says, you're crazy, you're insane.
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:48.920]  A few months ago, hey, the U.S. and Israel are attacking Iran inside with covert operations.
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:50.920]  Oh, that's a conspiracy theory. You're crazy.
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:52.920]  Hey, Newt, you supported Hillary.
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:54.920]  I mean, not Hillary care, but other models of it.
[02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:57.920]  Oh, you're crazy. You supported carbon taxes. Oh, you're crazy.
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:00.920]  Hey, Mitt Romney, you supported carbon taxes. Oh, you're crazy.
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:03.920]  Again, they just say, you're crazy.
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:06.920]  They don't respond to, hey, you're a member of Bahamian Grove.
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:09.920]  We show their own annals, their own publications.
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:15.920]  In fact, they have shots of the annals I was sent by a widower of him there, of him a key speaker.
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:20.920]  We'll play this video in audio and then get Luke Radowski who did the interview's take on it.
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:26.920]  Look at this.
[02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:30.920]  There's Newt Gennrich. There's Luke.
[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:33.920]  Take some pictures now.
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:41.920]  Stands in line, gets a photo with him first.
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:47.920]  I think you consider yourself a Catholic, but what happens when you worship Moloch at the Bahamian Grove?
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:54.920]  Good.
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:38:00.920]  New York Post says that male prostitutes are shipped in into the Bahamian Grove.
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:04.920]  Shows the New York Post, gay porn star service moguls of the Bahamian Grove.
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:07.920]  And look whose name is on the list.
[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:09.920]  Can you tell us what happens there?
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:11.920]  You actually believe all this junk.
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:14.920]  Bill Clinton said that Republicans run around naked in the woods there.
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:22.920]  That's where all those rich Republicans go up and stand naked against redwood trees, right?
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:25.920]  I've never been to the Bohemian Club, but you ought to go and be good for it.
[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:28.920]  You get some fresh air.
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:31.920]  And you don't want to know what Richard Nixon said about the place.
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:48.920]  That's the place you attended. It's a secret society.
[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:52.920]  Can you tell us a least who invited you?
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:57.920]  It's nice to know that there are some people who have fantasy lives that have nothing to do with it.
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:04.920]  You can answer the question.
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:14.920]  See you later.
[02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:18.920]  All right. And again, for radio and TV listeners, we had to fade down the whole Nixon thing,
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:25.920]  because it's got a bunch of GDs and I'm calling them the pejorative for homosexuals and all the rest of it.
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:28.920]  But the full video is at infowars.com.
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:31.920]  They say they faded it down. I heard it in my ear, but I told the network to delay it.
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:36.920]  Sorry if that went out, but it was no FCC stuff. It was just, you know, GDs and this and that.
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:40.920]  But again, that's Nixon talking about it.
[02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:45.920]  And of course, that's a great video, Luke, but I would have also added a little bit of the David Gargan,
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:47.920]  but that might have made it too long.
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:52.920]  But wow, for radio listeners, you miss the facial expressions of Newt.
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:56.920]  It looks like a little devil right there, but break this down for us, Luke,
[02:39:56.920 --> 02:40:01.920]  and some of the other stuff you've been seeing in Iowa and New Hampshire and the work you're doing.
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:03.920]  Also, give us your Facebook and Twitter pages.
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:07.920]  I just want to encourage everybody out there to be the media because of the mainstream media,
[02:40:07.920 --> 02:40:10.920]  the whole response, the press truth has been failing us.
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:12.920]  I think that's why we're in so much trouble right now,
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:17.920]  because the branch of our government has not been doing a job with checks and balances.
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:20.920]  And I just want to tell everybody this is so easy.
[02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:24.920]  I got into New Hampshire and I was two hours into the New Cambridge event.
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:25.920]  I just walked in.
[02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:26.920]  It was already over.
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:27.920]  He was still shaking hands.
[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:28.920]  Nobody questioned us.
[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:31.920]  We walked in, stood in line, shook his hand and asked the question.
[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:35.920]  You know, and I was only in New Hampshire for about 48 hours, and then I got Rick Santorum.
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:36.920]  I got Mitt Romney.
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:39.920]  I got comments from Ron Paul, Rand Paul.
[02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:45.920]  It's really just the time right now for everybody to grasp through authority and the true power that they have
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:53.920]  to actually change the face of politics and mainstream conversation in this political presidential elections this year
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:59.920]  by going out there and actually talking to the candidates about things that the mainstream media wouldn't even dare to bring up,
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:04.920]  because if nobody's going to talk about these things, it's up to people to actually bring this up.
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:06.920]  And I just want to encourage everybody to just get out there.
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:11.920]  I know many people are afraid that something may happen, but nothing's going to happen if you go out there
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:17.920]  and you ask questions and you demand answers from people who want to be the leader of the United States
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:18.920]  and want to be president.
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:20.920]  Well, Luke, I love your correspondent comment.
[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:25.920]  That's a good name for him with the prostitutes, the globalist mouthpieces.
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:28.920]  My dad called up on the cell phone during a break and said,
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:31.920]  you knew a little about mouthpiece media or mouthpiece media.
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:39.920]  But for radio listeners, describe, who couldn't see the video, describe the interaction and the way Newt was acting.
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:41.920]  And then all he says is, you're crazy.
[02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:45.920]  I mean, it's on record, he goes there, all this goes on.
[02:41:45.920 --> 02:41:52.920]  And this isn't 20 years ago where there was no internet and he can just sit there and shovel bull at you.
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:57.920]  They think they could lie, but right now with the internet, the truth has more power than anything else out there.
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:00.920]  This is actually not the first time I actually got Newt Gingrich on Beaming Grove.
[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:02.920]  I talked to him at CPAC last year.
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:07.920]  I brought up the Beaming Grove three times and he just walked away like he didn't even hear me.
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:10.920]  This time it's pretty interesting, he was taking pictures and shaking hands.
[02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:13.920]  So I just decided to wait in line, anybody could do this.
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:18.920]  I got a nice snapshot photo with him and then I just asked him a question.
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:24.920]  If you really consider yourself a Catholic, if you really consider yourself an honest man, let's talk about this.
[02:42:24.920 --> 02:42:31.920]  Let's talk about the secret societies that you're involved in and all the cold, crazy rituals that go down at the Beaming Grove.
[02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:38.920]  And it's just absurd to see, to face them down. You could see in the space, he looked guilty.
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:41.920]  He looked like he got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:44.920]  His face just says it all, his facial expressions.
[02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:52.920]  And I was just laughing because just by looking at his face, we just had this awkward stare down for a couple of moments that you don't see
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:58.920]  because of a cut up video where we were just staring at each other and he didn't know what to say because he...
[02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:04.920]  Well, you can see it. You can see he pauses and tries to stare you down and does his little vampire grin.
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:08.920]  He does his little vampire grin. Sadly, security grabbed me and pushed me from the vent.
[02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:12.920]  Just like other events, Romney event, same thing, security went after me.
[02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:16.920]  Yeah, by the way, you can tell when you ask a real question because when you showed the Bill Clinton clip,
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:23.920]  another fellow got up and asked that question years ago and they started manhandling him to drag him out like,
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:28.920]  oh my gosh, you brought up Bohemian Grove. Clinton goes, oh yeah, I know about that.
[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:32.920]  And the security acts like it's bad when they hear that word. It's like, don't ask real questions.
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:38.920]  This is in America. How dare you ask a real question citizen. You're here to lick our boots.
[02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:44.920]  Exactly. And this happens so many times. Whenever you raise a question that the mainstream media doesn't ask,
[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:50.920]  or isn't under pressure release, or isn't regurgitated like the mainstream media regurgitates when asked by the campaign to
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:55.920]  talk about these points, to set the dialogue, to set the mind of the American people,
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:59.920]  people get shocked, people get surprised. The only way they can handle it, you know,
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:04.920]  automatically they're fearful of the truth. And you can see that because they grab you, they target you,
[02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:10.920]  they watch you. Even at the Romney event, you see the security guard, you see Romney's security talking about me,
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:15.920]  saying, you know, let us know what to do about him. Kicking me out on a vent just for asking a question.
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:20.920]  I'm not rude. I'm not cursing. I'm simply bringing up points that I think are important for the people
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:25.920]  because I have no corporate sponsors. You know, I'm paid for, for and by the people. That's it.
[02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:30.920]  And I'm here to do a bidding of the people, not the mega, multi-national corporations that run and control the mainstream
[02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:35.920]  media, along with the government who have, and the CIA, with Operation Mock and Bird.
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:40.920]  I mean, it's long been admitted that intelligence agencies have had major control over our mainstream
[02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:45.920]  media, even in congressional meetings in the 60s that came out a long time ago. So this is nothing new.
[02:44:45.920 --> 02:44:50.920]  We need to be aware of this, but we also need to be aware of the power within ourselves to actually change this
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:55.920]  and actually bring real issues to the surface of this whole presidential debate by going out there,
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:45:00.920]  asking questions, demanding answers, standing our ground and being the true voice of the people.
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:05.920]  Well, that's right, Luke. And while you're talking, we're showing some of that Mitt Romney footage,
[02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:11.920]  the background, we're going to play some audio of you there talking to him. But the idea that it's so evil
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:17.920]  and a book signing or whatever to walk up and talk to a God and to pull the curtain back and show
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:23.920]  they're just a person and to actually get off them, the corporate propaganda script, the talking point
[02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:29.920]  and to actually ask a real question, they are scared to death of it because they're paper tigers.
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:34.920]  Let's play a clip of this Mitt Romney situation where Luke asked him some questions. Here it is.
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:39.920]  It's important to have the Fed as an independent agency. I do not think you want to have the Congress
[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:43.920]  of the United States trying to pull strings at the Fed.
[02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:47.920]  People who support you.
[02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:51.920]  Actually, they were the biggest supporters of President Obama, weren't they?
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:54.920]  You're both flip-floppers.
[02:45:54.920 --> 02:45:57.920]  And you're both supported by the big banks.
[02:45:57.920 --> 02:45:59.920]  That was the title of their opinion.
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:03.920]  Mitt Romney stealing all of Barack Obama's big-dollar Wall Street donors.
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:07.920]  A good chunk of his funds came from his buddies on Wall Street like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:09.920]  and Bank of America.
[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:13.920]  To get that kind of money, you've got to cozy up as an incumbent to all of the special interest groups
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:16.920]  who can go out and raise money for you from their members.
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:20.920]  That kind of relationship has an influence on the way you're going to vote.
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:22.920]  Fox News.
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:26.920]  My name is Bill DeBurne.
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:28.920]  Yes, I do.
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:33.920]  Good pause. That's sycophantic minion.
[02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:35.920]  We're going to play more in a minute that comes over.
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:38.920]  They always have this same little gleam in their eye like,
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:42.920]  I'm a minion of a pile of steaming vomit.
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:44.920]  I'm a minion of the system.
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:46.920]  They're supposed to intimidate you.
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:50.920]  And they're always wimps, but they try to get their eyes all crazy at you
[02:46:50.920 --> 02:46:52.920]  like you're asking questions.
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:54.920]  I got one that can see.
[02:46:54.920 --> 02:46:56.920]  I mean, it's just pathetic, Luke.
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:46:58.920]  A little tough guy is trying to get my information,
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:01.920]  so they won't allow me into another Mitt Romney event.
[02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:03.920]  That's exactly what the guy was trying to do.
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:06.920]  And I told him, you know, he was trying to find out my name, where I'm from.
[02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:10.920]  I just told him my name is Bill DeBurg, and I'm from Fox News,
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:13.920]  and I told him to lick that up, and he asked to see my credential.
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:17.920]  And most people would literally begin to wet themselves,
[02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:21.920]  literally, and would grovel, and then that would make the attack dog freak out more.
[02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:24.920]  It's where when you act guilty, then security guards would have run over,
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:26.920]  and they may not even have made it out of there.
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:29.920]  I mean, because you've been through this so many times, so have I, Luke.
[02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:33.920]  I mean, again, but just laughing at him, he didn't know what to do.
[02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:37.920]  Then the little power look went away, and he kind of just shook and groveled off.
[02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:40.920]  Let's play some more of the clip from that point. Here it is.
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:48.920]  And stupid YouTube, when you play it right off YouTube, sometimes it starts and stops.
[02:47:48.920 --> 02:47:51.920]  You just back it up one second, it'll play again from that point.
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:54.920]  Yes, I do.
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:03.920]  Look how powerful he is. He has an earpiece.
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:10.920]  Kind of makes me ashamed even having an earpiece right down my shelf.
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:12.920]  Sit ahead, Fox.
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:18.920]  Alright, let's go back to Luke. Hey, look right here, folks. Look.
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:22.920]  I'm powerful. I have one. If I show this to be probably bowed down,
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:24.920]  I'm like, look, Trendy, I have this.
[02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:26.920]  I have an earpiece.
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:28.920]  Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:30.920]  Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:32.920]  I'm a Secret Service agent.
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:34.920]  I'm a wannabe.
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:36.920]  And of course, you see in movies, they have the Secret Service.
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:38.920]  These all-powerful men in black.
[02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:42.920]  Totally ninja-like, like Agent Smith and the Matrix.
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:45.920]  But in truth, at Bilderberg and stuff, it'll just be some guy in a goofy suit
[02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:48.920]  trying to act tough, talking into their sleeve.
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:51.920]  But the sleeve might get working, so they're like...
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:54.920]  I mean, they're just people like everybody else, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:57.920]  And most people that run around with their noses sniffing
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:00.920]  for the biggest globalist rump that they can sniff at,
[02:49:00.920 --> 02:49:03.920]  I mean, they're not very good quality people.
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:05.920]  I mean, the enemy is a bunch of scum.
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:09.920]  Or a bunch of dumbed-down idiots that we can hopefully wake up out of their slumber.
[02:49:09.920 --> 02:49:11.920]  Luke Radowski, comments on that.
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:13.920]  I mean, the best thing to do is not to have fear.
[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:16.920]  Not to have fear of being who you are and talking in your mind.
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:19.920]  And just going out there, being confident, having a way with words.
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:22.920]  I would encourage everybody to go out there and do this,
[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:24.920]  especially during this electoral campaign.
[02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:28.920]  I'm going to start making video tutorials about how to actually be a journalist,
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:30.920]  how to actually get to the places.
[02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:33.920]  I mean, all you have to do is just have a little street smart to know where they're going,
[02:49:33.920 --> 02:49:37.920]  where they're coming from, being confident, being flexible sometimes too,
[02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:40.920]  and being able to do something.
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:43.920]  Many people are not willing to do this because they're afraid of failing,
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:46.920]  but I just want to tell people out there, you fail by not trying.
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:47.920]  You fail by not doing.
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:48.920]  You may get knocked down.
[02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:49.920]  You may not do right.
[02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:50.920]  Sometimes you may fail.
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:52.920]  Sometimes it's about how many times you could get up.
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:55.920]  I failed so many times, but I'm willing to do it again and again
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:57.920]  so I could learn from my mistakes.
[02:49:57.920 --> 02:49:58.920]  And I learned a lot.
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:49:59.920]  I want to show that.
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:02.920]  I want to share that knowledge with everybody on We Are Change.
[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:05.920]  We're going to be making a lot more videos confronting politicians,
[02:50:05.920 --> 02:50:07.920]  bringing up the real issues,
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:10.920]  so educating the people on what they're being misinformed on.
[02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:13.920]  So just stay on YouTube.com forward slash We Are Change
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:14.920]  to get more information.
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:16.920]  Again, we're not supported by anybody.
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:17.920]  We got many plans.
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:19.920]  We want to travel the country to confront you guys,
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:21.920]  and we can only do that with your help.
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:22.920]  Absolutely.
[02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:25.920]  People should go to YouTube.com forward slash We Are Change,
[02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:28.920]  but where else can people visit your sites
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:31.920]  and find out about the real We Are Change
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:33.920]  because there is some fake coming Telpro out there.
[02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:36.920]  But your examples led to hundreds of great groups across the country.
[02:50:36.920 --> 02:50:38.920]  We're working on new websites right now,
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:40.920]  but our old website is WeAreChange.org.
[02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:43.920]  I talk to a lot of people on Twitter and Facebook
[02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:45.920]  and actually take questions from the people
[02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:47.920]  about what should I question around me
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:48.920]  and ding their attention to our minds.
[02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:49.920]  Now give us your Facebook.
[02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:53.920]  Go to Facebook.com forward slash Luke We Are Change.
[02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:54.920]  Get me up on there.
[02:50:54.920 --> 02:50:56.920]  I want to communicate with you.
[02:50:56.920 --> 02:50:58.920]  And I also need place to crash whenever I do travel.
[02:50:58.920 --> 02:51:00.920]  Yeah, folks got to help, Luke.
[02:51:00.920 --> 02:51:01.920]  Get there and helping.
[02:51:01.920 --> 02:51:04.920]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself,
[02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:07.920]  but most involves substantial capital and risk.
[02:51:07.920 --> 02:51:10.920]  Our info wars team dot com operation is different.
[02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:12.920]  We promote premium quality health,
[02:51:12.920 --> 02:51:14.920]  energy and skincare products
[02:51:14.920 --> 02:51:17.920]  using dynamic caring personalities
[02:51:17.920 --> 02:51:19.920]  and state of the art media technology
[02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:22.920]  to spread a powerful message of health, wealth,
[02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:24.920]  longevity and freedom.
[02:51:24.920 --> 02:51:26.920]  This low cost business opportunity
[02:51:26.920 --> 02:51:29.920]  is designed for full time or part time
[02:51:29.920 --> 02:51:31.920]  so you can work as little or as much as you'd like.
[02:51:31.920 --> 02:51:34.920]  It is you that defines the reward level,
[02:51:34.920 --> 02:51:37.920]  whether you are seeking a few hundred extra dollars per month
[02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:40.920]  or a six or even seven figure annual income.
[02:51:40.920 --> 02:51:41.920]  It's up to you.
[02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:42.920]  Want to find out more?
[02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:45.920]  Shoot an email with info wars team in the subject line
[02:51:45.920 --> 02:51:47.920]  to info wars team coordinator MZ
[02:51:47.920 --> 02:51:49.920]  and tell him a little bit about yourself.
[02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:52.920]  That's the initials MZ at info wars team dot com.
[02:51:52.920 --> 02:51:54.920]  That's MZ at info wars team dot com.
[02:51:54.920 --> 02:51:56.920]  I only promote products that I truly believe in
[02:51:56.920 --> 02:51:58.920]  and these are phenomenal.
[02:51:58.920 --> 02:52:01.920]  What do you do? Visit info wars team dot com.
[02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:05.920]  That's what it sounds like
[02:52:05.920 --> 02:52:07.920]  when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house
[02:52:07.920 --> 02:52:09.920]  that looks like no one is home.
[02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:11.920]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:13.920]  Make it look like someone is home watching television
[02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:14.920]  with fake TV.
[02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:16.920]  Fake TV is a small electronic device
[02:52:16.920 --> 02:52:19.920]  that makes the same light as a real television.
[02:52:19.920 --> 02:52:22.920]  So from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:24.920]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer
[02:52:24.920 --> 02:52:26.920]  but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:28.920]  Fake TV deters burglars,
[02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:29.920]  costs far less than an alarm
[02:52:29.920 --> 02:52:32.920]  and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:34.920]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:37.920]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95
[02:52:37.920 --> 02:52:39.920]  go to faketv.com

[02:52:47.920 --> 02:52:50.920]  for safety, security and peace of mind for both of you.

[02:52:53.920 --> 02:52:55.920]  or go to faketv.com
[02:52:55.920 --> 02:52:57.920]  faketv.com
[02:52:57.920 --> 02:53:26.920]  The burglar deterrent.
[02:53:57.920 --> 02:54:00.920]  Be Prepared or beprepared.com
[02:54:27.920 --> 02:54:29.920]  Again, you four or five years ago start, we are changed.
[02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:31.920]  Hundreds of groups pop up.
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:34.920]  Just the idea of exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:36.920]  The carbon taxes, the globalist.
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:38.920]  Really out of the fact that New York 9-11 Truth
[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:41.920]  didn't want to connect the dots and talk about the New World Order.
[02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:43.920]  They wanted to make it all about Bush.
[02:54:43.920 --> 02:54:47.920]  Now, here you are, you know, college, graduate, whatever.
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:49.920]  I've worked in some national TV and things.
[02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:51.920]  Now you're going on the road
[02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:53.920]  and you're telling folks you're going to go over where
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:55.920]  confront people, ask real questions
[02:54:55.920 --> 02:54:58.920]  but you do need a support network so folks can donate
[02:54:58.920 --> 02:55:01.920]  there on your Facebook or Twitter
[02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:03.920]  and they can also, you can hook up with other activists
[02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:06.920]  around the country to help you as you travel around
[02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:07.920]  asking real questions.
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:10.920]  Again, give us the Twitter and Facebook one more time.
[02:55:10.920 --> 02:55:12.920]  Go to Facebook.com forward slash Luke.
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:14.920]  We are changed and the best way you could help us
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:16.920]  is by getting involved in confronting these politicians,
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:18.920]  confronting these criminals and getting out there
[02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:20.920]  and actually doing the good work.
[02:55:20.920 --> 02:55:22.920]  Well, great job, Luke.
[02:55:22.920 --> 02:55:24.920]  And I really look forward to seeing all the other great videos.
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:25.920]  We only covered a few of them there.
[02:55:25.920 --> 02:55:26.920]  There's hundreds of them.
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:27.920]  You're so prolific.
[02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:29.920]  Great job with you and the folks you work with.
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:30.920]  God bless.
[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:31.920]  God bless you too, brother.
[02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:32.920]  Follow the great work you have done.
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:33.920]  You bet.
[02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:34.920]  All right.
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:35.920]  I love that new Gennrich video.
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:37.920]  Okay.
[02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:38.920]  Well, I got to a lot of it.
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:39.920]  I meant to cover this more.
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:42.920]  I got into the whole Manufactured Doomsday
[02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:44.920]  story out of the New York Times
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:47.920]  where the government's ordering the groups they fund
[02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:49.920]  to create weaponized strains of everything
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:52.920]  to just create absolute airborne havoc.
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:54.920]  But telling us, you know, that we've got to give our rights up
[02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:56.920]  or Al Qaeda will get us when they're done
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:55:58.920]  taking over Libya for them.
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:01.920]  12 infected with new swine flu strain.
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:04.920]  The days of medical masks and airports widespread panic
[02:56:04.920 --> 02:56:05.920]  may be coming back.
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:07.920]  That's because at least 12 humans are believed
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:09.920]  to have been infected with a new strain of swine flu
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:12.920]  that's not covered by the season's vaccine.
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:14.920]  But it turns out this thing isn't even that serious.
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:16.920]  They just want to hype, oh, there's a new thing.
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:19.920]  The public's woken up to us and it's record levels
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:20.920]  not taking the shot.
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:24.920]  Oh, my God, it's not covered by the new flu shot.
[02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:26.920]  What does that mean?
[02:56:26.920 --> 02:56:30.920]  I mean, after you get something, it doesn't even matter.
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:32.920]  I mean, the seasonal flu shot never covers
[02:56:32.920 --> 02:56:34.920]  whatever the new flu is.
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:35.920]  It's a total hoax.
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:38.920]  But they play on people's medical ignorance.
[02:56:38.920 --> 02:56:42.920]  The new swine flu strain, H3N2V.
[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:44.920]  Oh, scary.
[02:56:44.920 --> 02:56:46.920]  Has shown at least some potential
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:48.920]  for human to human transmission.
[02:56:48.920 --> 02:56:51.920]  Oh, my gosh, there's a flu that humans can get.
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:52.920]  Even while the government's making flues
[02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:54.920]  that kill 90-plus percent of the people,
[02:56:54.920 --> 02:56:59.920]  but that's not a problem, which makes it especially dangerous.
[02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:01.920]  And it goes between 09 and 010,
[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:05.920]  more than 17,000 people died worldwide
[02:57:05.920 --> 02:57:09.920]  from the highly contagious H1N1 flu strain.
[02:57:09.920 --> 02:57:11.920]  Of course, it also came out that most of those
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:13.920]  were people that had already had run dialysis,
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:15.920]  had cancer, had health problems,
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:16.920]  and then they died of the flu
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:19.920]  as they were already on death's doorstep.
[02:57:19.920 --> 02:57:22.920]  But go ahead and take the shots.
[02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:23.920]  Here's another one.
[02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:26.920]  Children dumped in streets by Greek parents
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:28.920]  who can't afford to look after them anymore.
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:30.920]  And because every dime must be given to the government
[02:57:30.920 --> 02:57:32.920]  and the orphanages are full,
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:35.920]  they're now just saying, let them rot in the street.
[02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:37.920]  But of course, here, if you're poor,
[02:57:37.920 --> 02:57:39.920]  they take your children for dirty dishes.
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:41.920]  But then when they rot in the street
[02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:43.920]  or the government grabs them for medical experiments,
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:46.920]  it's loving.
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:48.920]  It's a total criminal enterprise.
[02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:50.920]  And of course, most of the Greek debt is not their debt.
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:52.920]  It's all their government signing on
[02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:54.920]  to Goldman Sachs' Ponzi scheme,
[02:57:54.920 --> 02:57:56.920]  because all their heads of state
[02:57:56.920 --> 02:57:58.920]  are all Goldman Sachs alumni.
[02:57:58.920 --> 02:58:01.920]  Children are being abandoned by Greece's streets
[02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:03.920]  by their poverty-stricken families
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:05.920]  who cannot afford to look after them anymore.
[02:58:05.920 --> 02:58:07.920]  Youngsters, you know, you go to the third world,
[02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:09.920]  Latin America, there's just everywhere,
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:11.920]  just kids everywhere, just homeless.
[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:13.920]  They're being dumped by their parents
[02:58:13.920 --> 02:58:15.920]  who are struggling to make ends meet
[02:58:15.920 --> 02:58:17.920]  in what is fast becoming the most tragic human consequence
[02:58:17.920 --> 02:58:19.920]  of the Euro crisis.
[02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:22.920]  And it shows a little boy here with his ribs sticking out,
[02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:25.920]  playing a drum, trying to get donations.
[02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:28.920]  It comes as pharmacists revealed,
[02:58:28.920 --> 02:58:30.920]  the country has run out of aspirin.
[02:58:30.920 --> 02:58:32.920]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:58:32.920 --> 02:58:34.920]  Oh man, I tell you, New World Order,
[02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:37.920]  it'll destroy your whole society overnight.
[02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:41.920]  Curse, see you back tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
