[00:00.000 --> 00:12.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.640 --> 00:21.360]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.360 --> 00:33.200]  welcome to the alex jones show on this monday january the 5th 2015 i'm david night i'll
[00:33.200 --> 00:36.960]  be your host today for the first two hours alex jones is going to be joining us actually
[00:36.960 --> 00:41.200]  hosting the show in the third hour not just joining us we also have in the second hour
[00:41.200 --> 00:48.120]  christopher busby a physicist he has exposed the dangers of low-level radiations we're
[00:48.120 --> 00:51.840]  going to talk to him about that because not only is fukushima coming up in just a few
[00:51.840 --> 00:58.240]  months to its four-year anniversary still dumping radioactive waste into the air into
[00:58.240 --> 01:04.600]  the pacific that is now we were told going to peak in 2015 on the west coast hopefully
[01:04.600 --> 01:09.120]  it'll peak hopefully there won't be another incident hopefully it won't continue unabated
[01:09.120 --> 01:14.200]  but this has been going on for years now and of course ukraine the site of the chernobyl
[01:14.200 --> 01:20.600]  accident the largest disaster prior to fukushima i don't know we can talk to mr busby when
[01:20.600 --> 01:26.320]  he gets on i don't know which one has released the most amount of radiation chernobyl was
[01:26.320 --> 01:33.240]  a very short event fukushima just keeps going on cumulatively but there's now another nuclear
[01:33.240 --> 01:37.920]  reactor in ukraine which we heard a little bit about at the beginning of december we
[01:37.920 --> 01:42.800]  were told that it was just a minor incident that it was just an electrical issue now
[01:42.800 --> 01:47.800]  of course these nuclear power plants that are in the ukraine are like ours getting very
[01:47.800 --> 01:52.720]  old most of the power plants get a license in the united states for 25 to 30 years these
[01:52.720 --> 01:56.320]  nuclear power plants that we're talking about in ukraine are 30 years old they're russian
[01:56.320 --> 02:00.760]  designs although they've they've already been caught trying to put square pegs and round
[02:00.760 --> 02:04.960]  holes getting control rods from the u.s when they couldn't get them from russia after the
[02:04.960 --> 02:12.040]  ukraine incident except the problem is is that we make round rods and the russians had
[02:12.040 --> 02:16.360]  designed it for square rods or vice versa i don't know but the bottom line is that created
[02:16.360 --> 02:20.400]  a bit of an issue nevertheless this incident that happened at the beginning of the month
[02:20.400 --> 02:25.520]  we were told was just an electrical short that the reactor was not involved there was
[02:25.520 --> 02:31.600]  no radiation issues involved with that then on december 28th through the holidays there
[02:31.600 --> 02:37.640]  was another incident at that same power plant and this is the largest nuclear power plant
[02:37.640 --> 02:42.520]  in europe it's the fifth largest in the world and of course it's just a few hundred miles
[02:42.520 --> 02:49.600]  from chernobyl we were told there was a second incident there are reports multiple reports
[02:49.600 --> 02:56.240]  that there has been a radiation leak that is 16 times what is normal there so we're
[02:56.240 --> 03:00.880]  going to be following up with that talking to christopher busby in the second hour and
[03:00.880 --> 03:06.320]  again as i said alex jones will be here hosting in the third hour today is a very important
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.680]  day if you want to do something to roll back this criminal government that is unaccountable
[03:11.680 --> 03:17.560]  to us and of course this is the day that you can contact your g.o.p representative if you
[03:17.560 --> 03:22.040]  have a congressman in your area that's a g.o.p representative you need to talk to them and
[03:22.040 --> 03:26.840]  tell them that they need to oppose bainer's reappointment as speaker of the house that's
[03:26.840 --> 03:31.160]  going to happen tomorrow so today is the day if you want to get involved if you are someone
[03:31.160 --> 03:37.160]  who votes for republicans and democrats i personally don't i support third parties i think we need
[03:37.160 --> 03:43.080]  to have a broader choice that's my most important message to the people who count the votes
[03:43.080 --> 03:49.920]  each time is i want them to know that i want an unrigged choice nevertheless i think it's
[03:49.920 --> 03:55.480]  important even if you're a democrat to oppose bainer's continued presence there we need
[03:55.480 --> 04:00.040]  to hold people accountable and of course everyone knows by now what these guys did immediately
[04:00.040 --> 04:04.160]  after the election they thumbed their nose at the people who got them elected who wanted
[04:04.160 --> 04:08.920]  them to roll back obama care who wanted them to do something about the border who wanted
[04:08.920 --> 04:13.360]  them to exercise from some control and instead of just passing a continuing resolution until
[04:13.360 --> 04:20.440]  they had a large majority until they had a republican senate bainer deceived the congressional
[04:20.440 --> 04:23.720]  representatives they're telling them that it was going to be one thing when it turned
[04:23.720 --> 04:29.720]  out to be another so several of them are angry we've got louis gohmert from texas says he's
[04:29.720 --> 04:33.640]  going to run against bainer for speaker of the house we've got a couple of representatives
[04:33.640 --> 04:38.320]  thomas massie as well as steve king saying they will not vote for him and we'll be talking
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.600]  about the reasons that they give and we'll be talking about what you can do to send this
[04:42.600 --> 04:46.440]  message we have to hold them accountable of course they're going to have somebody else
[04:46.440 --> 04:51.280]  to take bainer's place the guys who control both parties will have somebody just like
[04:51.280 --> 05:00.160]  him in the wings they need to know their accountable stay with us we'll be right back when you're
[05:00.160 --> 05:08.120]  out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but if the unfortunate happens

[08:30.040 --> 08:35.920]  hour and the second hour we're going to be joined by a physicist christopher busby he's
[08:35.920 --> 08:40.560]  been outspoken about the dangers of low level radiation we're going to talk to him not only
[08:40.560 --> 08:45.120]  about fukushima which is coming up to his four year anniversary but also about what's
[08:45.120 --> 08:50.480]  going on in ukraine and there have been two incidents at ukraine the largest nuclear power
[08:50.480 --> 08:56.840]  plant in europe just a few hundred miles from chernobyl this particular power plant has
[08:56.840 --> 09:01.160]  had two incidents one at the beginning of december december third actually it was november
[09:01.160 --> 09:09.720]  28th it was announced on december the third by the newly minted head of the energy ministry
[09:09.720 --> 09:17.560]  this guy is not a physicist not an engineer this guy was a banker a politician and what
[09:17.560 --> 09:22.320]  he said was that at the time it was not an accident because technically an accident is
[09:22.320 --> 09:27.960]  a release of radiation he said it was merely an incident but the timeline is kind of interesting
[09:27.960 --> 09:34.800]  because it happened on the 28th then on the third they have a new actually the day before
[09:34.800 --> 09:42.080]  the announcement they get a new energy ministry person involved and his name is dem to dem
[09:42.080 --> 09:46.880]  to shin i think is the way it's pronounced nevertheless he says that it's merely an accident
[09:46.880 --> 09:52.840]  an incident not an accident and then at the end of this last month at december 28th they
[09:52.840 --> 09:58.360]  had another issue at another nuclear reactor and now we're told that that it does involve
[09:58.360 --> 10:02.160]  release of radiation we're not being told that by the ukrainian government there's
[10:02.160 --> 10:06.800]  been some documents that have been released that point to that we've also had some reports
[10:06.800 --> 10:12.680]  from rt as well as three independent sources that have found that documentation so it appears
[10:12.680 --> 10:19.160]  that there's radiation being leaked at this after this second incident this is a large
[10:19.160 --> 10:25.360]  facility as i said it's the largest in europe the fifth largest in the world this is something
[10:25.360 --> 10:32.200]  that essentially when it first came out on december the third when dem to shin came out
[10:32.200 --> 10:36.680]  he said there's no threat there's no problems with the reactors he said they would have
[10:36.680 --> 10:41.360]  it done within two days it was down for a bit of a week this is something that is really
[10:41.360 --> 10:47.120]  affecting ukraine because 50 percent of their power generation comes from nuclear reactors
[10:47.120 --> 10:51.600]  and these are old nuclear reactors they've been around for about 30 years just like ours
[10:51.600 --> 10:56.640]  they're starting to get to the end of their useful life but like us they just keep them
[10:56.640 --> 11:01.600]  going they also had an incident according to some people where they used the wrong kinds
[11:01.600 --> 11:05.200]  of control rods had a little bit of a problem that i'm sure that didn't last too long because
[11:05.200 --> 11:11.960]  they're having problem getting spare parts from russia and of course as the former head
[11:11.960 --> 11:18.120]  of our nuclear regulatory commission gregrie yatso said after fukushima he called for all
[11:18.120 --> 11:23.800]  of our nuclear power to be phased out he said we should be shutting down our nuclear reactors
[11:23.800 --> 11:29.480]  because the designs have the same flaws we've seen in fukushima he said that we have to
[11:29.480 --> 11:33.800]  look at this as a society when he addressed japan and he says you have to think about
[11:33.800 --> 11:40.360]  whether you're willing to accept another accident of this scale of this magnitude if you aren't
[11:40.360 --> 11:44.800]  you need to shut this down at least redesign these power plants if you're going to continue
[11:44.800 --> 11:48.800]  with it now we're talking about the ukraine one more article that came out this last
[11:48.800 --> 11:54.880]  weekend the president of the check republic says that only poorly informed people don't
[11:54.880 --> 11:59.680]  know about what's going on in the ukraine coup he was talking to the people in his country
[11:59.680 --> 12:04.240]  and of course they had a velvet revolution that was a democratic revolution an authentic
[12:04.240 --> 12:09.440]  democratic revolution but he says those who are seeing it that way seeing the maiden revolution
[12:09.440 --> 12:15.120]  the same as the velvet revolution are seeing it in a profoundly false light he said this
[12:15.120 --> 12:19.560]  is the reason why that's not a democratic revolution he said this is the reason why
[12:19.560 --> 12:24.800]  ukraine is now in a condition of civil war in which the residents of the donbas region
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.720]  in ukraine's southeast have broken away from the ukrainian government he had strong criticism
[12:29.720 --> 12:34.800]  of the ukrainian prime minister yatsenyuk he said that i think he is rather a prime
[12:34.800 --> 12:40.280]  minister of war because he does not want a peaceful solution as recommended by the european
[12:40.280 --> 12:46.080]  union but instead he prefers to use force and he points out that actually this analysis
[12:46.080 --> 12:53.360]  in the washington blog points out that obama is pressing his advantage to try to force
[12:53.360 --> 12:59.360]  european unions to take sides it's essentially george w bush all over again where george
[12:59.360 --> 13:04.280]  w bush said you're either with us or you're against us that's essentially the message
[13:04.280 --> 13:09.760]  that we're getting from the obama administration as they work to start another cold war to
[13:09.760 --> 13:14.640]  build this up now we have another article that's up on info wars dot com cadenials article
[13:14.640 --> 13:20.000]  here lawsuit shows the cops have confiscated guns from a veteran who is diagnosed with
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.600]  insomnia he's not only a military veteran but he's a police veteran he's filed a lawsuit
[13:26.600 --> 13:32.280]  he's a navy veteran he was also a law enforcement officer with a distinguished career more than
[13:32.280 --> 13:37.320]  30 years he retired at the rank of detective sergeant he had a spotless record he'd been
[13:37.320 --> 13:43.840]  awarded medals bravery medals he was a commanding officer for 15 years he retired he moved across
[13:43.840 --> 13:50.240]  the state to be closer to his grandchildren and as part of that move he was having difficulties
[13:50.240 --> 13:57.720]  sleeping so he went to the hospital he got some trasadone 50 milligrams of that they
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.760]  examined him they wrote on his comments he's they said he's well developed well kept male
[14:02.760 --> 14:08.120]  dressed casually no acute distress calm pleasant cooperative he's not a threat to himself or
[14:08.120 --> 14:15.040]  any others and yet for some reason they labeled him as an involuntary admission not true not
[14:15.040 --> 14:20.920]  consistent with their notes nevertheless the local sheriff starts getting repeated calls
[14:20.920 --> 14:24.880]  from the new york state police saying they have to go pick up his gun so they called
[14:24.880 --> 14:29.440]  him they apologized and said we've had repeated pressure we have to come pick up your guns
[14:29.440 --> 14:34.720]  they picked up all of his weapons and the state police canceled his pistol permit without
[14:34.720 --> 14:40.840]  a hearing and of course the hospital is refusing to correct the mistake and its records this
[14:40.840 --> 14:46.560]  is something we should think about in light of the fact that we just got a surgeon general
[14:46.560 --> 14:51.920]  appointed by obama's name is vibe like murthy he has talked about gun violence being a public
[14:51.920 --> 14:57.360]  health epidemic he says that he is tired of politicians who are afraid of the nra and
[14:57.360 --> 15:02.600]  he thinks that guns are a major health issue he is going to be a propagandist for this
[15:02.600 --> 15:12.440]  kind of medical snitching going on turning people into the police not having a trial
[15:12.440 --> 15:17.640]  not having a hearing i don't have a problem with somebody who is psychologically disturbed
[15:17.640 --> 15:23.160]  having their guns taken away from him but it needs to be with due process i remember
[15:23.160 --> 15:27.920]  with some of these shootings we had a lot of people on the right even some of the nra
[15:27.920 --> 15:32.440]  were saying we need to get rid of the guns from crazy people that's the problem so if
[15:32.440 --> 15:37.640]  anybody goes to a psychiatrist we need to take their guns away that is not the solution
[15:37.640 --> 15:43.040]  you need to have due process before anything is taken away from you any property and especially
[15:43.040 --> 15:48.240]  your rights that is the real issue here and this is something that we're going to see
[15:48.240 --> 15:54.640]  increasingly happen with this kind of attorney general that we just had appointed by the
[15:54.640 --> 15:59.240]  obama administration another article up on info wars dot com what prices will look like
[15:59.240 --> 16:04.880]  before and after a mandatory minimum wage increase they point out that a study from
[16:04.880 --> 16:09.440]  the heritage foundation says that the customers can expect to see about a thirty eight percent
[16:09.440 --> 16:13.840]  increase in the cost of their super-sized mega meals and so in this article it's up
[16:13.840 --> 16:17.240]  on info wars dot com if you want to really kind of get a feel for how that's going to
[16:17.240 --> 16:21.920]  affect things you can look at the various fast food entries that you're going to be
[16:21.920 --> 16:28.040]  paying for prices before and after a fifteen dollar per hour wage hike well if you want
[16:28.040 --> 16:34.200]  a big mac you're going to be going from five sixty nine to seven eighty three if you want
[16:34.200 --> 16:40.240]  a steak burrito bowl you're going to go from six sixty five to nine fourteen you want a
[16:40.240 --> 16:45.960]  son of baconator combo six forty nine to eight ninety two hey maybe you might get the idea
[16:45.960 --> 16:49.560]  that you don't want to eat that stuff there's another article up on info wars dot com from
[16:49.560 --> 16:56.080]  anthony gutiarty talking about how the newly renamed high fructose corn syrup contains
[16:56.080 --> 17:01.440]  toxic mercury not only have they renamed it because it's gotten a bad rap and justifiably
[17:01.440 --> 17:06.240]  so they call it high fructose corn syrup now they're just going to call it fructose they're
[17:06.240 --> 17:10.520]  not going to talk about it being corn because now people are starting to get the idea the
[17:10.520 --> 17:15.800]  understanding that almost all corn is genetically modified and they don't want to talk about
[17:15.800 --> 17:21.240]  it being really high in concentration so the high fructose corn syrup is much cheaper
[17:21.240 --> 17:28.120]  than sugar it's much more intense and it's much more addictive and now it's got mercury
[17:28.120 --> 17:32.760]  in it new and improved and while we're talking about food there's another article up on info
[17:32.760 --> 17:39.640]  wars dot com a new monsanto law in africa would force gmo's on farmers this is something
[17:39.640 --> 17:45.440]  we have seen in the united states we've seen this in india they say that this is something
[17:45.440 --> 17:50.800]  that is coming through and gana africa the proposed legislation will have rules that
[17:50.800 --> 17:56.400]  restrict farmers from ancient practices things that people have done in every country freely
[17:56.400 --> 18:02.720]  saving swapping and breeding seeds under the new laws that are there to listen this protect
[18:02.720 --> 18:09.840]  the intellectual property rights of biotech farmers these practices of saving sharing
[18:09.840 --> 18:16.240]  and breeding seeds would be subject to heavy fines for growing anything that might be quote
[18:16.240 --> 18:21.600]  unquote patented even if their crops were cross pollinated that's exactly if you remember
[18:21.600 --> 18:27.560]  that's exactly what happened in india the huge number of small farmers they're committing
[18:27.560 --> 18:34.920]  suicide because monsanto would come into an area they would offer these gmo crops to
[18:34.920 --> 18:41.080]  some of the farmers as they were growing that gmo crop it would cross pollinate into the
[18:41.080 --> 18:48.280]  heritage crops that were being grown by the neighboring farms monsanto would come in do
[18:48.280 --> 18:53.840]  an analysis of the seeds say you are infringing on our patency it's not infringement when they
[18:53.840 --> 18:58.480]  cross pollinate your product with something that you didn't want they're saying you're
[18:58.480 --> 19:02.720]  stealing this from us when they are shoving it on you it's actually a trespass but they
[19:02.720 --> 19:09.640]  put it out there as if it was some kind of a a theft of their patented property and so
[19:09.640 --> 19:14.360]  farmers in india then were fined they were sued by monsanto they didn't have the money
[19:14.360 --> 19:19.800]  to fight a giant like that so they were going out of business left and right and many of
[19:19.800 --> 19:24.040]  them took their lives because that's the way they responded that kind of pressure in that
[19:24.040 --> 19:30.160]  culture but of course we also had a article in info wars just last last week december
[19:30.160 --> 19:35.000]  29th talking about how seed libraries are being shut down in the united states exactly
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.440]  the same thing shutting down seed libraries saying you cannot save grow and transfer these
[19:40.440 --> 19:47.000]  seeds add to that we saw back in august paul joseph Watson talked about the same thing elsewhere
[19:47.000 --> 19:53.320]  in the united states maybe we should just say nobody can grow any food except monsanto
[19:53.320 --> 19:56.360]  i'm sure they got the votes in congress to pull that one off stay with us we'll be right

[24:19.960 --> 24:25.280]  going to have christopher busby joining us talking about the dangers of low level radiation
[24:25.280 --> 24:29.280]  and the last segment we were talking about what's going on with monsanto pulling the
[24:29.280 --> 24:33.240]  same tricks in africa that they've done in india the same tricks that they're doing
[24:33.240 --> 24:37.200]  and of course the united states and it remains to be seen if they're going to get away with
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.920]  it in africa probably will they seem to be able to get away with it pretty much anywhere
[24:41.920 --> 24:48.560]  except in a few places like europe where the people haven't been bought out yet the lawmakers
[24:48.560 --> 24:53.880]  haven't been bought out by monsanto they appear to basically own our government they can do
[24:53.880 --> 24:59.240]  pretty much anything they want as evidence of that this december 29 story from the ap
[24:59.240 --> 25:06.040]  that we had on info wars seed libraries are struggling with state laws that limit exchanges
[25:06.040 --> 25:10.360]  they say gardeners at hundreds of spots around the country course are being are sharing seeds
[25:10.360 --> 25:14.960]  as part of an increasing interest in locally grown food but some agricultural officials
[25:14.960 --> 25:20.840]  say the well-meaning effort violates state laws and so this one happened in diluth minnesota
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.720]  but back in august we reported about this happening in pennsylvania paul joseph watson's
[25:25.720 --> 25:30.400]  article back then pointed out that it was the usda the department of agriculture shut
[25:30.400 --> 25:35.320]  down a seed library in pennsylvania for the same reasons claiming that a system where
[25:35.320 --> 25:39.640]  residents could borrow heirloom seeds from each other then replace them at harvest time
[25:39.640 --> 25:47.400]  was a violation of the 2004 seed act and they even use the term agra terrorism says
[25:47.400 --> 25:54.720]  it's terrorism to grow your own food without paying monsanto a commission this is the kind
[25:54.720 --> 26:00.640]  of greedy corporations that are running our government that are trying to push these large
[26:00.640 --> 26:06.360]  trade partnership agreements between the u.s. and europe between the u.s. and asia the trans
[26:06.360 --> 26:12.200]  specific partnership the transatlantic partnerships this also is part of those partnerships as
[26:12.200 --> 26:17.840]  well as internet control regulation they pointed out at the time in this story that paul joseph
[26:17.840 --> 26:24.360]  watson had back in august that they were amazed that you had agricultural department
[26:24.360 --> 26:29.680]  officials from the federal government coming into this small town and pushing them around
[26:29.680 --> 26:34.720]  about this little seed library and one of the people there said gee it makes me wonder
[26:34.720 --> 26:40.000]  when they're going to crack down on all those gmo feels with their grave concerns about
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.480]  cross-pollination look out monsanto oh wait i forgot this only applies to regular people
[26:45.480 --> 26:52.120]  who are growing vegetables gmo's aren't considered to be an invasive species see when we were
[26:52.120 --> 26:58.360]  talking last week to john rapopore about what the real fight ought to be with gmo they've
[26:58.360 --> 27:03.240]  got us distracted i think it was his article that pointed this out and we had him on talked
[27:03.240 --> 27:09.080]  about it for a while i think he's right i think they've got everybody totally distracted
[27:09.080 --> 27:13.920]  with his head fake about labeling yeah it's important to know what's in your food but
[27:13.920 --> 27:19.240]  we've also got the same people on both sides of the issue just like we got the same people
[27:19.240 --> 27:24.480]  running the democrat and republican party don't believe me take a look at john bainer
[27:24.480 --> 27:29.480]  and tomorrow there's a an important meeting that's going to a important vote for speaker
[27:29.480 --> 27:34.000]  of the house today is the day to call your republican representative and tell them you
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.800]  don't want to see bainer coming back but it's the same guys running both sides of the operation
[27:38.800 --> 27:45.160]  whether it's a regulation of gmo's or whether it's the republicans and the democrats it's
[27:45.160 --> 27:51.880]  the same thing each time and we've seen this happening over and over again we keep losing
[27:51.880 --> 27:58.680]  the labeling fights and yet we have one at the local level because the farmers understand
[27:58.680 --> 28:03.280]  that this is a trespass just like that lady said oh according to the federal government
[28:03.280 --> 28:08.480]  gmo's are not considered to be an invasive species they are an invasive species they
[28:08.480 --> 28:15.560]  are a trespass and it's a very dangerous thing to have these untried seeds completely replace
[28:15.560 --> 28:22.320]  heirloom seeds it could create a worldwide famine if we give monsanto and a handful of
[28:22.320 --> 28:29.200]  these companies one seed that they put out there it's not even effective in terms of
[28:29.200 --> 28:37.000]  killing the stated purpose it's not even effective but it is killing local agriculture
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.560]  now as we were talking about this last segment richard came in and handed me an article from
[28:41.560 --> 28:47.000]  three years ago where a farmer fought monsanto and saskatchewan canada and actually won he
[28:47.000 --> 28:54.080]  had been developing his own seeds for 50 years and they point out that he went after monsanto
[28:54.080 --> 29:00.560]  because they accused him of patent infringement when they cross pollinated and contaminated
[29:00.560 --> 29:06.360]  his field of heirloom seeds so he came after them for libel he said they publicly accused
[29:06.360 --> 29:11.040]  him of committing illegal acts he came after them for trespassing because they cross pollinated
[29:11.040 --> 29:16.960]  onto his property he came after them for improperly obtaining samples of his seeds from a local
[29:16.960 --> 29:23.040]  seed plant and then they he also came after them for disregard of the environment by introducing
[29:23.040 --> 29:30.320]  GMO crops without proper controls and without containment and he won just like the people
[29:30.320 --> 29:36.000]  in hawaii won when they prohibited GMOs from being grown and that was John Rappapour's point
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.720]  we have to make sure that we stop GMO that we don't let it continue to spread because
[29:40.720 --> 29:44.960]  we're distracted about where the labels are going to be voluntary or mandatory say with
[29:44.960 --> 29:53.600]  us we're going to be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and

[33:16.760 --> 33:20.600]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host on this monday january 5th
[33:20.600 --> 33:26.200]  2015 first monday of the new year now alex is going to be the host in the third hour in the
[33:26.200 --> 33:31.000]  second hour we're going to be joined by a scientist from the uk christopher busby who's going to
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.520]  talk to us about the dangers of low level radiations i mentioned earlier in the show there's even
[33:36.520 --> 33:42.280]  renewed concern not only is fukushima going on approaching its four-year anniversary of spewing
[33:42.280 --> 33:49.080]  radiation into the environment but now we have new concerns about an aging nuclear reactor in the
[33:49.080 --> 33:54.680]  ukraine that's had two incidents or accidents depending on who you believe the difference
[33:54.680 --> 34:00.920]  being whether or not there was radiation released has had two of these incidents in the last month
[34:00.920 --> 34:06.360]  and this is the largest power plant in europe it is the fifth largest in the world it's just a
[34:06.360 --> 34:13.000]  couple of hundred miles from a another famous power plant chernobyl same basic design and as
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.800]  we mentioned earlier in the show as well our own head former head of the nuclear regulatory
[34:17.800 --> 34:25.240]  commission gregory yatso has said that we have the same kinds of fundamental flaws that happened
[34:25.240 --> 34:30.600]  at fukushima and that we ought to consider shutting down and redesigning all of the nuclear
[34:30.600 --> 34:36.040]  power plant so we have in america if we're going to continue down the road of nuclear power and
[34:36.040 --> 34:41.640]  of course that's the former head of the nuclear regulatory commission speaking now i want to
[34:41.640 --> 34:47.240]  talk about what's going on with bainer as speaker of the house i think it's very important whether
[34:47.240 --> 34:53.000]  or not you have this guy replaced with another shill for the new world order or for big government
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.480]  wherever you want to look at this whether or not they replace him with somebody else just like him
[34:57.480 --> 35:03.400]  it's important for us to stand up and throw out the people who betray us as just as it's important
[35:03.400 --> 35:10.200]  for us to impeach the president when he violates the law and violates the constitution of course
[35:10.200 --> 35:14.520]  bainer is not willing to do that he's not even willing to meet the commitments that he made
[35:14.520 --> 35:19.800]  to the republican voters betraying them immediately immediately after the election
[35:20.520 --> 35:24.280]  so there's been a lot of pushback over the weekend we had two people say they're going to
[35:24.280 --> 35:30.600]  run against bainer when they get together and vote tomorrow and it's an opportunity for you to
[35:30.600 --> 35:36.680]  speak up and talk to your republican representatives if you have a republican representative in your
[35:36.680 --> 35:47.240]  area now one of the allies of bainer has gone on the ms mbc's morning joe i guess that's where the
[35:47.240 --> 35:53.160]  status are always welcome to go there and make their case for war as well as for continued
[35:53.160 --> 35:58.120]  big government this is tom cole a friend of bainer republican from oklahoma he said these
[35:58.120 --> 36:05.240]  gop challenges to his friend speaker bainer are quote pretty unprofessional and very disappointing
[36:05.240 --> 36:09.960]  oh my strong language there i guess it's bad sportsmanship isn't he said they're pretty
[36:09.960 --> 36:13.880]  disappointing in the sense that anyone who wanted to run could have run in the conference
[36:13.880 --> 36:19.480]  elections and none of them did well let's listen to what one of the guys tom massie who says he
[36:19.480 --> 36:24.360]  will not be voting to read like speaker bainer let's listen to his grievances about bainer
[36:25.400 --> 36:31.080]  he said during his first two years as a congressman he discovered why people are so upset with
[36:31.080 --> 36:37.240]  congress why it's so dysfunctional here's the list that he gave out he said he's watched the
[36:37.240 --> 36:43.560]  house leadership in other words bainer schedule a fiscal crisis in a lame duck session on the last
[36:43.560 --> 36:48.840]  legislative day before christmas to get maximum leverage over the rank and file members remember
[36:48.840 --> 36:54.120]  that remember that they said he misled members into thinking that a vote on an unpopular bill
[36:54.120 --> 37:01.000]  was postponed only to then conduct a rushed voice vote on the ten billion dollar unfunded spending
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.040]  measure with fewer than a dozen members present that was the one that we talked about i think that
[37:07.160 --> 37:12.520]  you had i think it was fewer than way fewer than ten i think it was fewer than five who basically
[37:13.960 --> 37:19.560]  came after russia with sanctions they spent well that was a different bill because that was
[37:19.560 --> 37:25.240]  half a billion dollars uh this is a ten billion dollar unfunded bill and of course he did this
[37:25.880 --> 37:30.280]  thing of of introducing it at the very last minute not just with the continuing resolution
[37:30.280 --> 37:37.640]  omnibus bill the cromnibus he also did it with the ndaa who basically spring uh bills on the people
[37:37.640 --> 37:43.640]  that were over a thousand pages 15 1600 pages long give them less than 24 hours to look through it
[37:43.640 --> 37:47.400]  and demand that they vote or the government was going to shut down and that's the next item he's
[37:47.400 --> 37:53.480]  got on here giving members less than 72 hours to read bills that are over a thousand pages long
[37:53.480 --> 37:58.600]  and this is the other thing that got everybody upset with him removing members from committees
[37:58.600 --> 38:06.360]  simply because they voted for the principles on which they campaigned yeah if you are going to do
[38:06.360 --> 38:11.240]  what you told the people when you asked them to vote for you then baner is going to punish you
[38:11.240 --> 38:18.040]  because baner doesn't play by those rules see i think we should call it baner care we had romney
[38:18.040 --> 38:26.920]  care is exactly like obama care mandatory insurance it was even sold with fake econometric models by
[38:26.920 --> 38:33.000]  john gruber the same guy that did it for obama it was absolutely the same thing as obama care
[38:33.000 --> 38:38.280]  and now baner has taken this on because he's the one who's funding it he's the one who's
[38:38.280 --> 38:45.880]  giving the money to the irs to punish us for not buying products from his crony capitalist friends
[38:46.520 --> 38:51.480]  see with crony capitalism you got to have two friends you got to have a corporation on the
[38:51.480 --> 38:56.760]  outside and you got to have a banner on the inside so they can do favors for each other
[38:56.760 --> 39:01.320]  you got to have people like jeb bush who's comfortable moving back and forth between
[39:01.320 --> 39:06.920]  high levels of office and sitting on the board of directors of these same corporations that are
[39:06.920 --> 39:12.040]  writing the laws that were never meant to make insurance affordable they were meant to make
[39:12.040 --> 39:17.400]  insurance unaffordable they were there to make sure that you bought more insurance than you needed
[39:17.400 --> 39:22.760]  more than you could afford and having a gun held to your head by the irs and now that jeb bush has
[39:22.760 --> 39:29.080]  made millions probably hundreds of millions off of this he can now move on in his career and become
[39:29.080 --> 39:35.320]  president for a while until he rotates back out into the corporate crony world that's what's happening
[39:35.320 --> 39:39.080]  with the republicans so if you want to try to break that cycle at least on the republican side
[39:39.640 --> 39:44.120]  here's your chance call your republican representative and tell them you don't
[39:44.120 --> 39:49.640]  want them to vote for baner tomorrow when they have the vote now we've had a lot of talk about
[39:49.640 --> 39:56.200]  police brutality i think in my opinion that was the biggest story of the last year not only people
[39:56.200 --> 40:00.280]  understanding about the m-rap program the militarization of the police in terms of training
[40:00.280 --> 40:08.200]  the overuse of swat teams but also the unnecessary brutalizing force that we see over and over again
[40:08.200 --> 40:14.120]  by the police and them escaping punishment i think there's a legitimate gripe about that we've said
[40:14.120 --> 40:18.360]  that over and over again here at info wars but there are right ways to do it and there's wrong
[40:18.360 --> 40:28.840]  ways to do it here's the wrong way to do it this is a funeral of a 100 year old veteran well those
[40:28.840 --> 40:36.600]  protesters busting through a town hall meeting just as 100 year old world war two veteran dario
[40:36.600 --> 40:42.120]  reshio was about to be honored and they did not stop until reshio made them do it
[40:42.120 --> 41:11.960]  there you go that's the way to not win friends and
[41:11.960 --> 41:17.080]  influence people that was an award ceremony for a 100 year old veteran that they broke up
[41:17.080 --> 41:22.440]  saying that they can't breathe now the black sheriff of milwaukee county dave clark he
[41:22.440 --> 41:29.640]  was stood a challenge from gun control lobbyist michael bloomberg who spent a half a million
[41:29.640 --> 41:35.240]  dollars trying to get him out of being the sheriff because dave clark supported the second
[41:35.240 --> 41:41.720]  amendment he had a very interesting thing to say about people who are protesting along racial
[41:41.720 --> 41:47.240]  lines this police brutality saying that black lives matter here's what he had to say about that
[41:47.240 --> 41:53.080]  protesters were asked by media about all the black on black killing or black babies aborted
[41:53.080 --> 41:58.680]  in the u.s. every year a is his reporting corrected you send him that message and b if so what did you
[41:58.680 --> 42:05.880]  mean by it yes i did and that's you know when i hear these things that black lives matter the only
[42:06.600 --> 42:10.440]  people that really believe that statement are american police officers who go into american
[42:10.440 --> 42:15.640]  ghettos every day to keep people from killing each other all right so yes i did send that and i
[42:15.640 --> 42:21.640]  meant it the abortion black lives if they really mattered that's where the outrage would be that's
[42:21.640 --> 42:26.040]  what we see protests about but when we see the black on black homicide that happens on a very
[42:26.040 --> 42:32.360]  frequent basis we don't see protests we don't see marches we don't see demands for change so this
[42:32.360 --> 42:38.200]  has been a one-way conversation that i'm just trying to present a counter narrative to balance this
[42:38.200 --> 42:43.080]  thing and so that we can have that discussion but when i'm sensing from the media i mean when you
[42:43.080 --> 42:47.560]  started out this thing you talk about a mentally disturbed man in milwaukee wisconsin yeah she's
[42:47.560 --> 42:53.160]  mentally disturbed but the fact is he was attacking a police officer with a night stick made out of
[42:53.160 --> 42:58.360]  hickory that's designed the police officers night stick that's designed to break bones and if used
[42:58.360 --> 43:02.200]  in the wrong area like a head and we train our officers don't use this thing toward the head
[43:02.200 --> 43:07.480]  because you could kill somebody or cause great bodily harm so this individual took that night
[43:07.480 --> 43:12.600]  stick and was wielding it in an offensive manner against the police officer and we want to brush
[43:12.600 --> 43:17.320]  that aside and talk about the fact that he was died in 14 shots were fired and that stuff's all
[43:17.320 --> 43:22.760]  true but that officer was under attack and he responded appropriately under the rule of law
[43:22.760 --> 43:29.800]  and what and what i said and understand that police definitely have a right to protect themselves
[43:29.800 --> 43:36.040]  we have a right to protect ourselves as well but we are also judged when there's no longer
[43:36.040 --> 43:42.280]  a threat to us we have to stop the attack somebody breaks into your home and they're coming at you
[43:42.280 --> 43:47.320]  you certainly have a right to stand your ground defend yourself defend your family shoot that person
[43:47.320 --> 43:52.360]  if necessary if on the other hand they're running away from you and they're no longer a threat to
[43:52.360 --> 43:58.280]  your life and you shoot them in the back that's not self-defense and we need to be able to make
[43:58.280 --> 44:03.560]  that distinction and when people come in and do these kind of protests like they did at this
[44:03.560 --> 44:11.160]  this ceremony honoring this 100 year old world war two vet that is really counterproductive to
[44:11.160 --> 44:17.720]  the whole narrative just as this false narrative about it being simply nothing but race is also
[44:17.720 --> 44:22.920]  false look at this report that surfaced in just the last week we had a new york police department
[44:22.920 --> 44:28.920]  cop identified as a man who attacked and choked a woman in a subway now the way this went down
[44:28.920 --> 44:35.160]  is that on new year's eve they put out a video of an attack that happened a week earlier december
[44:35.160 --> 44:40.920]  23rd witnesses say that this man who was later identified as a police officer grabbed one of
[44:40.920 --> 44:45.560]  the conductors on the subway and a bear hug from behind threw her to the ground and started
[44:45.560 --> 44:50.440]  choking her until a second conductor came running to her aid so what they did was they took this
[44:50.440 --> 44:57.800]  video they put it out for the public to take a look at it on new year's eve and this was a police
[44:57.800 --> 45:03.320]  officer he was off duty he turned himself in within a couple of hours but guess what there were no
[45:03.320 --> 45:09.560]  charges filed against the officer maybe they will i don't know it so far as as i understand there
[45:09.560 --> 45:15.000]  aren't any charges filed and when we look at situations we have situations like the michael
[45:15.000 --> 45:19.960]  brown situation i think what really made people angry about that was how he was left in the
[45:19.960 --> 45:25.320]  street for four hours i think that really graded against the people there and whether or not this
[45:25.320 --> 45:30.920]  was a case of self-defense we don't have the video for that so i have it made up my mind i can see
[45:30.920 --> 45:36.120]  arguments from both sides we have conflicting testimony but clearly we saw the case of eric
[45:36.120 --> 45:42.200]  garner in new york that was on video that was a situation where he was no longer a threat to them
[45:42.200 --> 45:48.120]  and they choked him to death it was homicide according to the coroner due to uh what they did
[45:48.120 --> 45:55.480]  to multiple hemorrhages within his in his neck in his eyes they choked the guy literally to death
[45:55.480 --> 46:02.040]  over a minor infraction and then in just a few days after that or i should say a few days before
[46:02.040 --> 46:07.720]  the verdict was released from the grand jury in the eric garner case there was a man who was not
[46:07.720 --> 46:13.320]  doing anything he wasn't violating any laws he was walking up the stairway of the apartment complex
[46:13.320 --> 46:18.360]  the uh that that he was in it was a project a housing project and they had police who were
[46:18.360 --> 46:23.320]  patrolling it up and down the stairway the man's name was girly he was shot by an officer who had
[46:23.320 --> 46:29.960]  his gun out shot in the chest and as he was again laying there bleeding out this cop calls the police
[46:29.960 --> 46:35.000]  union now there are right ways and there's wrong ways to do this and i think one of the stories
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.960]  that we had the last few days here on info wars it was a story from the daily caller and there
[46:39.960 --> 46:44.840]  was a lot of pushback i saw on the daily caller i think pretty much the commenters on our site
[46:44.840 --> 46:49.160]  understood what was going on but on the daily caller they were really upset about this flyer
[46:49.160 --> 46:54.520]  that was put out on new year's eve basically it had 13 different points i don't have time to read
[46:54.520 --> 46:59.320]  all these different points but it all kind of boiled down the fact that they wanted independent
[46:59.320 --> 47:04.840]  elective civilian oversight not civilian we shouldn't call it's even civilian we we talk
[47:04.840 --> 47:09.800]  about it that way because it's an understanding that we have a militarized police force we've got
[47:09.800 --> 47:15.320]  the california highway patrol are calling themselves paramilitary group over and over again to anybody
[47:15.320 --> 47:21.320]  who wants to apply for a job with the california highway patrol they talk about themselves over
[47:21.320 --> 47:24.920]  and over again on that website as paul joseph wasen pointed out in the story a couple of weeks ago
[47:24.920 --> 47:30.360]  they refer to themselves repeatedly as a paramilitary group in other words they see themselves
[47:30.360 --> 47:38.120]  assisting the military just as a paralegal just as a paramedic would assist a lawyer or a doctor
[47:38.680 --> 47:43.480]  the california highway patrol sees itself assisting the military they see themselves as
[47:43.480 --> 47:48.280]  a military organization so that's where this civilian stuff comes out because we all
[47:48.280 --> 47:54.360]  subconsciously understand that we're now under a kind of standing army military occupation
[47:54.360 --> 48:00.680]  according to the rules that we are seeing them engage us with and of course we need to have
[48:00.680 --> 48:06.520]  a civilian oversight board we need to have independent investigative bodies as matt shay
[48:06.520 --> 48:11.640]  and spokane pointed out we need to make sure that we also have oversight from the citizens in the
[48:11.640 --> 48:16.360]  community oversight of the training that the police are being given oversight of the equipment
[48:16.360 --> 48:19.960]  that they're being given because that's where this militarization begins it begins with the
[48:19.960 --> 48:26.120]  training from the justice department and from homeland security it begins with the equipment
[48:26.120 --> 48:31.640]  that they're giving them to make them feel as if they're in a war zone and so this was a very good
[48:31.640 --> 48:37.240]  document i thought it had 13 different points here talking about how they wanted to make sure that
[48:37.880 --> 48:42.760]  essentially it was transparency there was independence and there was justice done
[48:42.760 --> 48:46.760]  that i think is the right way to do it now of course they did have on there a hashtag black
[48:46.760 --> 48:52.280]  lives matter can't breathe but they had about 15 or 20 different hashtags there and they didn't
[48:52.280 --> 48:56.840]  really other than those hashtags down at the bottom which have come to be associated with
[48:56.840 --> 49:03.080]  this issue they didn't make it about race they made it about oversight they talked about making
[49:03.080 --> 49:08.760]  sure that all officers had cameras and if they had the cameras turned off maybe that's an admission
[49:08.760 --> 49:13.160]  that they were doing something they didn't want recorded i think it's very important for us to
[49:13.160 --> 49:17.320]  have this discussion and i think it's important for us to look at what's happened in new york
[49:17.320 --> 49:22.840]  with the police department when they came back against the police department they're they're
[49:22.840 --> 49:26.760]  against the city hall they're very angry with the mayor there with the plazio they
[49:26.760 --> 49:31.320]  turned their backs on him now with two different funerals we had a caller yesterday saying i think
[49:31.320 --> 49:35.800]  it's a great idea i think the republicans ought to stand up and turn their back on bainer i think
[49:35.800 --> 49:42.520]  that's a really appropriate way to go after bainer but as part of this anger this friction
[49:42.520 --> 49:47.560]  between the new york police department and the mayor's office especially the police union in
[49:47.560 --> 49:53.640]  new york they have essentially done a work stoppage they are not going to make any arrests
[49:53.640 --> 50:01.480]  unless it is absolutely necessary think about that why would they make any arrests that aren't
[50:01.480 --> 50:06.920]  absolutely necessary and of course they've taken traffic violations down by 94 in one week they
[50:06.920 --> 50:13.320]  typically write 10 000 traffic tickets are down to under 600 low-level offenses like public drinking
[50:13.320 --> 50:20.360]  they've taken that down from 4800 to just 300 parking violations they've taken it down 92 percent
[50:20.360 --> 50:28.120]  from almost 15 000 to 1200 they have to start looking at themselves differently we have to make
[50:28.120 --> 50:33.800]  sure externally that we make the police into a different organization than they are they shouldn't
[50:33.800 --> 50:40.760]  be meter maids with a license to kill and that's what they have been in too many areas that's what
[50:40.760 --> 50:46.520]  the federal government wants to turn our police into strong arm tactics to collect money and that's
[50:46.520 --> 50:51.160]  how erik garner died it was a trivial little tax stay with us we're going to be right back
[50:51.160 --> 50:55.640]  the next hour we're going to be joined by a physicist talking about low-level radiation

[55:30.680 --> 55:38.200]  that's 888-253-3139 48 percent off of that three pack the resolution pack now there's a story that
[55:38.200 --> 55:42.680]  just went up on info wars dot com again about that same thing we were just talking about black
[55:42.680 --> 55:47.880]  lives matter i thought that was a great comment by the sheriff there from milwaukee david clark
[55:47.880 --> 55:52.600]  saying well you think black lives matter why don't you take that protest to an abortion clinic
[55:53.240 --> 55:59.320]  because that's where most of the black lives are ending even before they get a chance now in
[55:59.320 --> 56:06.040]  this particular story this is yet another case of people blindly striking out attacking innocent
[56:06.040 --> 56:11.480]  people pushing people in the wrong direction trying to create a race war rather than trying to get
[56:11.480 --> 56:17.320]  control of law enforcement under civilian control under community control in this particular instance
[56:17.320 --> 56:25.080]  you've got black lives matter protesters are demonstrating at a brunch crashing into a restaurant
[56:25.080 --> 56:31.400]  and then tweeting about it attention white man i have no guilt disturbing your brunch it's you
[56:31.400 --> 56:37.480]  that has no right to be here see when you go out and you attack innocent people when you
[56:37.480 --> 56:42.600]  shoot innocent cops that weren't involved in any of these incidents that you're looking at when
[56:42.600 --> 56:49.240]  you are destroying black businesses when you're attacking people on the basis of race are you
[56:49.240 --> 56:55.000]  really doing anything worthwhile are you really kind of pushing this whole agenda that the federal
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.200]  government is trying to create in the first place and that is one of race war now i think what happened
[57:00.200 --> 57:08.200]  in new york on new year's eve with this list of 13 demands i think that's very important that you
[57:08.200 --> 57:14.280]  write down what you want in a rational manner and what i see them doing in these 13 demands
[57:14.280 --> 57:20.200]  is essentially saying the same kinds of things that uh frank serpicoe said same types of things
[57:20.200 --> 57:24.840]  that he called for the same types of reforms as he pointed out you've got bad people that are going
[57:24.840 --> 57:30.280]  to get in any group now certainly we would hope that law enforcement would be a little bit more
[57:30.280 --> 57:36.120]  astute at determining if somebody has criminal behavior tendencies and not let them in but
[57:36.120 --> 57:40.920]  certainly something like that once it happens they should be able to purge the bad guys out
[57:40.920 --> 57:45.880]  of their group we saw that happen at the bundy ranch we had the guy that later on went down and
[57:45.880 --> 57:51.240]  shot two cops of a couple months later in vegas he was thrown out of the bundy ranch it was pretty
[57:51.240 --> 57:57.000]  clear this guy was a provocateur it's pretty clear that he was an idiot and so the people there
[57:57.640 --> 58:04.760]  expelled him you can't stop people from coming to a uh a public protest but you can get them out
[58:04.760 --> 58:09.320]  of the area if there's a problem with them they policed themselves that's what we're asking the
[58:09.320 --> 58:14.920]  police to do and that's what we're demanding that we have the right to do because we we understand
[58:14.920 --> 58:19.880]  that with the unions that with the pressures that are there it isn't going to happen unless we've
[58:19.880 --> 58:25.960]  got external civilian oversight not only of these incidents but also of their training of the equipment
[58:25.960 --> 58:31.080]  that they receive that sort of thing listing out the demands that we want that's the way to go not
[58:31.080 --> 58:34.840]  attacking innocent people stay with us we're going to be right back christopher busby and then the

[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:29.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your host david night in the next hour we're going to be
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:35.560]  talking to christopher busby a physicist who has worn many times about the dangers of low level
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.960]  radiation so we're going to talk to him about that because again fukushima keeps going we're
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:45.080]  coming up to the four-year anniversary and this month we've had two incidents at a ukraine nuclear
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:51.640]  power plant the largest nuclear power plant in europe the fifth largest in the world and of course
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:57.000]  it's getting pretty old at that nuclear power plant this is something that should concern all of us
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.040]  so we're going to talk to him about the dangers of low level radiation alex jones is going to be
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:07.960]  your host in the third hour now in the last segment i was talking about the police brutality issues
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:13.480]  and mentioned the bundy ranch i think it's also important when we talk about purging bad people
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:19.320]  out of a public protest or certainly purging them out of your organization as we should see the police
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:25.560]  doing that's what the police should be more intense i think in terms of taking the bad actors out of
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:31.960]  their organization they should be more scrupulous about that than anybody but it was also a situation
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:37.880]  of the bundy ranch where the people there were begging for the local law enforcement to do something
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:42.520]  they weren't coming out against local law enforcement they were coming out against an intrusive
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:48.760]  overreaching overbearing federal bureaucracy the bureau of land management that was there to take
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:54.360]  control of even more federal land even though most of the land out west is owned by the federal
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:01.240]  government they claim control of it never turning it over to those states as they became states as
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:08.520]  they should have done and it's interesting because we just had a deadline pass for control of public
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.640]  lands in utah to be turned over from the federal government to the state government a deadline
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:19.240]  in utah was set for the federal government to hand over 31 million acres of public land
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:27.320]  on december 31st this last new year's eve that didn't happen so the question is what is going
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:33.080]  to happen now and of course this is the issue that began at the bundy ranch we got involved
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:39.400]  with info wars because of the brutality issues because of the blm coming in and out in the middle
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.120]  of nowhere and the wilderness putting up a little squared off area and saying this is your
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:49.720]  first amendment area and then people putting up a handwritten sign saying the first amendment
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:55.400]  is not an area i mean that's the attitude of the federal government that's what they're pushing
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:00.920]  on people that kind of high-handed and also brutal uh interaction that they had with local people
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:06.200]  but it began of course with the fight over who controls the land who is the legitimate
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:12.200]  authority in that area and of course the bundy family kept asking for the local local law enforcement
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:20.360]  uh the sheriff there to do his job the blm does not have any law enforcement authority in the states
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:25.880]  they should be going to the sheriff if there's something that needs to be done in a law enforcement
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.960]  capacity so it's going to be interesting to see what happens in utah this is a bill that was passed
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:36.840]  two years ago back in 2012 it was passed by the entire state legislature in utah they say that
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:43.640]  most of this land that they're currently that's controlled by the blm and the us forestry service
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.320]  and the national parks of course monuments and military bases are totally exempt from this
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:58.600]  demand so this is 31 million acres 50 of the state that is beside the parks and other areas that are
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:04.360]  open to the public and of course the utah state attorney general's office is involved and the
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:10.200]  state's congressional delegation is involved trying to get them to give up control of the land but
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:15.480]  of course they're not going to give up control of anything the federal government wants control of
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.200]  everything and as well as the corporations that they represent one of the fights that is going to
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:26.600]  come up that i think the republicans are on the right side of is fighting the fcc's authority it's
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:33.080]  not just the net neutrality rules because the fcc has been on both sides of the net neutrality issue
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:40.520]  the real issue is are they going to be allowed to assert control over the internet that is the real
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:46.200]  danger if the fcc can set themselves up we're going to see the same kind of bureaucratic
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.080]  regulation the same kind of bypassing of congress as we've seen with the epa and of course that's
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.560]  the means by which obama says he's going to get around the congress on climate changes with the
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.320]  epa we don't want to see that kind of control of the internet with the fcc stay with us we'll
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:03.080]  be right back with christopher buzzby to lose weight and get in shape and the truth is it's

[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:19.880]  network welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host this hour in the next hour
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:26.360]  alex jones will be your host joining us now is dr christopher busby from the uk he's a chemical
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:30.600]  physicist a british scientist known for his controversial theories about the negative
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:36.360]  health effects of very low dose ionizing radiation so we want to talk to him about that we also want
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:43.080]  to talk to him about fukushima and about these new incidents in the ukraine of course we have a
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:48.440]  power plant there the zapariza if i'm pronouncing it correctly nuclear power plant it is the largest
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:54.280]  nuclear power plant in europe it is the fifth largest in the world it is about 50 percent larger if
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:09:00.360]  my figures are correct here 50 percent larger than chernobyl so it has a potential to be a really
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:07.400]  big disastrous an old nuclear power plant it was built 30 years ago with soviet technology that they
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:13.720]  may be having difficulty getting the spare parts for and it is something that we should all be
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:19.720]  concerned about as we are seeing this fukushima disaster go on and on and on now for nearly
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:26.360]  four years we're coming up to the four-year anniversary welcome dr busby hello what is your
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:32.440]  take on the situation in ukraine of course we had a incident that we were told back on
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:38.760]  november 28th it was a major incident in terms of the way that affected their power supply because
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:43.320]  half of their power generation comes from nuclear power in the ukraine yet nothing was set about
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:50.600]  it for five days and then they had a newly minted minister of energy who was appointed the day before
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:56.120]  the public announcement come out and say it was just a short circuit in the electrical transmission
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:01.240]  it was nothing to do with the reactor itself and now we've learned that there was a second incident
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:08.200]  at the end of the month december 28th several sources have reported that there is a radiation
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:13.960]  leak associated with this second incident do you have any information about this well there is no
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.680]  diet that these radiation leaks are real because they've been picked up by various detectors in
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:27.880]  europe that are part of the urethane of detectors systems that were set up you know to to make
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:33.400]  sure that there would be some early warning of problems exactly like this so there have been
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.280]  increases in radiation spikes if you like and this does suggest that there's something seriously
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:45.960]  wrong with this with this reactor and indeed i mean i've seen leaked this telephone call conversations
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:53.160]  between various people who were in charge of operating the nuclear reactor as a project and
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.840]  and they do suggest that there were some very serious problems but so far they don't seem to
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:03.000]  have gone to the point where they have created you know the kind of Chernobyl situation but that
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.760]  doesn't mean to say that they won't and of course the problem is with all of these nuclear reactors
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:11.800]  that they are potentially capable of being just that and that's that's why most of the people
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.240]  that i know certainly i have i've argued you know that the nuclear power is not a good idea
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:22.760]  generally because it can result in these Fukushima type type incidents and of course you know if it
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:29.160]  happened in in in this Ukraine Ukrainian reactor it could contaminate an enormous population of
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:35.560]  Europe well of course the former head of the nuclear regulatory commission Greg Yatso agrees with
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:41.160]  you he says in the aftermath of Fukushima that he's concerned about all these reactor designs he
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.120]  believes that we ought to shut them all down and if we restart them it ought to be a different design
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:52.040]  so it's the former head of the US nuclear regulatory commission is just as concerned about
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:58.360]  nuclear power as you are and yet it appears to be something that a lot of people who talk about
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:04.920]  green issues are holding it out there as the greenest power source available i i just cannot
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:11.800]  understand that mentality it's based on a very narrowly focused metric of looking at something
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:17.560]  that generates carbon dioxide versus not looking at the radiation that and the nuclear waste so
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.640]  we have to be concerned about for millennium in some cases well the thing is these people don't
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:27.080]  know anything i mean i would agree quite a few of these people and of course it's quite easy to
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:32.200]  espouse nuclear power if you believe the nonsense the kind of fairy stories that that are fed out
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:37.480]  to the media by the nuclear power proponents themselves by the nuclear industry um but in
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:42.600]  fact none of that stuff is true the fact is that these power stations release i mean we're talking
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:48.760]  about releases from zapparocha now at the moment but actually all nuclear power stations in the world
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:53.960]  release stuff all the time as a result of their general operation and as a result of that people
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:59.640]  are dying close to the nuclear power stations downwind of them their childhood leukemia clusters
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:04.920]  near the nuclear power which is which is a sort of flag for for genetic damage so these things are
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:10.280]  already causing enormous problems never mind about the fact that they might possibly melt down and
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:15.560]  create the kind of serious conditions that that you've got in northern japan and that we're developing
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:22.120]  in in Belarus and southern parts of the russian federation and i think that's where it's important
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:29.640]  to talk about uh your your uh studies of the effects of low dose rate radiation because when there's
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:36.840]  a massive accident and people are exposed to large dosages of radiation we'll see that develop
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.400]  over a relatively short period of time sometimes it can be just a matter of a couple of days sometimes
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:46.680]  it might be a year or two before they die but this kind of low level exposure to radiation
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:53.000]  is something that is very difficult for us to correlate to the low level radiation leaks around
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.360]  nuclear power plants isn't it that's not true that's not okay um the fact is that it is easy to
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:03.160]  correlate and plenty of studies have now shown that these situations from the what what you call
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:09.400]  low dose radiation are seriously harmful but there are two points here that the first the first point
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:15.960]  is that that the the the governments and the people who control the funding for for studies of
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:23.400]  this type don't encourage um these sorts of studies and so they don't tend to get published so that's
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:28.600]  the first thing uh that that i can tell you that there is an enormous amount of work that's been
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.960]  done that shows that these low low doses of radiation are harmful um but the point is at the
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:38.280]  other point that i want to make is that it's actually not a question of low dose this is this
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:43.560]  this is the problem that the the nuclear industry and their supporters have have coached this whole
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:49.480]  argument uh in the in the context of dose but actually it's not low dose that's the problem
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:54.600]  that it's it's internal radiation that's the problem and i've been trying for some years now
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:59.000]  to to make people realize that it's not not about low dose for example you know on my
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.840]  wikipedia entry which is a sort of battleground i'm i'm categorized as somebody who who tries to
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.560]  say that low dose radiation is dangerous but actually that's quite wrong it's internal radiation
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:15.320]  from certain radionuclides that's dangerous because the target for radiation effects is the dna and
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:21.800]  certain chemicals are have a very high chemical affinity for the dna for example strontium 90
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:27.160]  for example uranium for example plutonium these substances when they get inside you they bind
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:33.240]  to the dna which is the target for radiation effects so although the doses from these things
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:38.920]  are are low doses it's not the low dose part of it that's the problem because doses categorized
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:43.880]  as energy per unit mass so like they take the amount of energy that's produced by these substances
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.280]  dilute it into the mass of your body and you find that the doses are vanishingly small
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:52.840]  but the dose of the dna is not vanishingly small because these things are stuck to the dna like
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:57.080]  glue because they have this chemical affinity for them so this is something that really has to be
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:02.360]  appreciated and these these substances are continually and released from nuclear power
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:09.000]  stations and in fact they can't be contained because the parent isotope of strontium 90 is a gas
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.800]  so it can't be held that inside the nuclear power station it now all nuclear power stations have
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:19.560]  high levels of strontium 90 in milk that's taken from cows that graze near the nuclear power stations
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:23.080]  and of course people drink that milk and so on and then you've got these high levels of childhood
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:28.920]  leukemia and so forth this is the problem and I keep trying to say that the problem is that you
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:33.800]  cannot contain this stuff even under normal circumstances and of course then you know you
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:37.880]  have these accidents as well and then it goes all over the place yeah I didn't just I don't
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:42.280]  disagree that there's a correlation there what I was saying was that it's it's difficult for people
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.360]  to see it because it will happen over a longer period of time as you're pointing out they can
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:52.920]  have epidemiological studies showing an increase in childhood leukemia around these these power plants
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:58.200]  and yet it's difficult for people to make that association if they don't see those studies and
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:01.800]  those studies are not going out but I think that's very interesting what you're talking about in
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:07.560]  terms of it not actually being the amount of the radiation but the way that it is connected to
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:14.520]  specific elements like strontium is cesium 137 also an issue with that because I know that we
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:20.200]  think it probably is yes um that in fact the point is that none of these substances which
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:24.680]  which which are released from these nuclear power stations and of course from nuclear weapons too
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:30.680]  and I'd like to say a few words about that at some point but the the none of these substances
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:37.160]  existed throughout evolution you see so so the evolution of living systems has dealt with all
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:42.120]  the elements that existed on earth during the time that that all these different species developed
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:47.640]  until we get to to human beings I suppose and all the other animals that around at the moment and
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:52.920]  they never had to deal with any of these elements which were radioactive but but now with the
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:59.160]  fissioning of uranium in 1945 and then the continuous releases to the to the biosphere following
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:03.480]  nuclear weapons testing which was a very serious matter and then of course all these
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:09.160]  reactor accidents and then you know the the normal distribution of it from nuclear power stations
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:14.440]  these substances just didn't exist before and and and living systems had not been able to
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.920]  develop systems to cope with them and so as a result of that they caused these effects
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:26.680]  and and nobody nobody seems to be addressing this problem which is which is resulting in
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:32.600]  in a in a serious serious detriment to all living systems on earth over the last 50 years
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:37.160]  it's really quite it's really quite bad absolutely let's talk about the weapon systems as you
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:41.640]  mentioned we talked many times here at info wars about depleted uranium for example on how
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:47.400]  they were very cautious and and actually had stopped using it essentially for a while there
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:52.200]  but then they got very cavalier about its use and its exposure to the soldiers and we've seen some
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:59.400]  amazingly horrific pictures of children in the areas where they they've used depleted uranium
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:04.600]  weapons extensively you want to talk about that well uranium is a particularly good example of
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:10.200]  one of these elements because although it's a natural element it never existed in the concentration
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:17.240]  that existed in following its use in in nuclear weapons testing and then more recently as depleted
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:23.720]  uranium you know used in Yugoslavia former Yugoslavia in in iraq now i've been called in as an expert
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:29.720]  witness on a number of cases relating to depleted uranium and soldiers from iraq who've been exposed
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:34.120]  and i've done quite a lot of work on uranium as a result of being a member of the british
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.800]  government depleted uranium oversight board and also hang on i want to get i want to get this
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.920]  information where we've got to come up to a break here we're going to be right back with
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:49.080]  dr christopher buzzi we're talking about low dose ionizing radiation the qualitative differences

[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:11.880]  friends ask me all the time why i wanted a ghost ar-15 that's easy you see my buddy mark kept telling
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:17.560]  me that i'd better go to guns ad dot com get myself a ghost ar-15 before they outlawed them
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:22.280]  i thought he was just paranoid so i ignored it well at first but then i started hearing government
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:27.320]  media types talking about making guns illegal about the president signing on to a un treaty
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:32.360]  that could take my gun rights away you know it really bugged me so i dug in i did the research
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:37.480]  and i realized that mark was right all along i know now that having an unregistered ghost
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:44.280]  ar-15 is the right answer i'm a proud 80 ghost ar-15 convert you should be too the answer is

[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:11.320]  welcome back to the alex joe show i'm david night we're talking to dr christopher busby
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:17.400]  a british physicist now the last segment we were talking about the effects of low dose
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:22.680]  ionizing radiation and dr busby distinguished between just being exposed to radiation and
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:27.880]  being exposed to certain substances that are going to bind themselves to the dna things like
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:32.760]  strontium that are going to be released from nuclear power plants we don't see it we don't
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:37.480]  smell it we don't taste it or touch it but it's there we can see the effects and epidemiological
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:42.360]  studies and we were talking about just before we had to go to the break we were talking about the
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:48.840]  effects of depleted uranium in particular because as dr busby pointed out the uranium that we see
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:52.840]  in the form that we see it in and the concentration that we see it in is something
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:58.360]  that we have never seen before the last few decades dr busby go ahead with what you were
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.200]  saying about depleted uranium you said you were working with british soldiers who had been exposed
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:07.240]  to it that's right that's right what what we discovered as a result of quite a lot of research
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:14.600]  was that the the way in which this material is produced when it's weaponized is it is it causes
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:19.160]  the production of these very very small particles which we call nano particles which are so small
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:23.320]  they're like a gas and in fact they're so small that they go through any respirator and indeed they
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:28.280]  go through the skin once they're inside you and they get into your cells then as the uranium
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:33.960]  dissolves you get a very high level of uranium in the cell which then binds to the dna very strongly
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:39.400]  and it causes an increase in the radiation dose if you like to call it the micro dose to the dna
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:45.160]  although the dose to the other part of the body is almost zero but of course what what the current
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:49.640]  risk agencies do in their model is that they dilute the whole lot into the whole body and they would
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:54.840]  say that that's a very low dose of course as far as the dna concern is actually a very high dose
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:59.560]  and this is why you get all these genetic effects these congenital malformations that you mentioned
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:05.960]  in in iraq and also we've seen these now in the test veteran children in the du veteran
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:10.120]  children themselves a number of studies in the united states that show that the children of the
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:15.400]  u.s veterans have high levels of congenital malformation and certainly a number of the cases
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:22.200]  that i've been involved in courts in the uk usually pensions appeals tribunals involve high
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:27.720]  levels of involve increases in cancer and various other signals of genetic damage but
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:34.120]  actually this wasn't the first time that uranium was used that uranium uranium exposure occurred
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:42.280]  in fact uranium exposure occurred as i as i later discovered in in the nuclear test veterans
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:47.080]  these are the people who went out to these the nuclear test sites whether it is in nevada or in
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:52.680]  mark islands or in in christmas island in australia for the british test veterans and i've done some
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:27:01.160]  very very big court cases on on this and recently in the london high court which which have in which
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:04.680]  there have been some extraordinary developments in which i've been threatened with the official
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:10.120]  secret sect and you know pursued around the place by my men in black and so forth and i'd
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:14.120]  like to have the opportunity to say a few words about this because this is the first time that
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:20.600]  i've talked about this since the since the last last court case in this was concluded
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:26.840]  uh which was on the second of december and then we had christmas and and at that at that case
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:31.160]  there were some very interesting developments which you would wish i should like to present on your
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:36.440]  show oh absolutely we've got a long segment coming up and uh there's always the case that they want
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:43.480]  to kill the messenger when you're exposing some bad news and i gotta say about these uh hereditary
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:50.600]  these congenital defects mutations that we've seen uh as a result of depleted uranium if you can take it
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:57.560]  go to google i'm telling the audience here look at depleted uranium look at felucia and you will
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:02.760]  see pictures of children that are some of the most horrific images i have ever seen it's absolutely
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:07.880]  horrible and of course there'll be images there of american and british soldiers and what happened
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:13.960]  to their children is dr busby just said i want to talk about this uh legal case in the uk as you're
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:19.800]  talking about the the effects of of uh nuclear testing that happened decades ago and now we're
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:25.320]  seeing uh the long-term effects of that i also want to talk about your mineral supplement that
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:30.440]  you're talking about what what can people do uh to minimize their exposure to this and i also
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:35.480]  want to cover uh the ukraine and revival of the cold war this whole nuclear escalation that is
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:40.600]  going on now with the obama administration uh going after russia what is happening in the ukraine
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:45.240]  i want to go into all those what is the first one that you'd like to cover well i think that we
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:50.040]  should uh just say a brief word about the russians and the ukraine before you know just to sort of set
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:55.160]  the stage here because it does look to me and to all the people that i talk to about this is that
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:01.000]  the pressure that's being brought on russia by the united states and by the people who are controlled
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.280]  by the united states and we have to realize that europe is very largely controlled by the united states
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:12.280]  very a lot of the country of europe are certainly the country i live in latvia has has a a lot of a
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:17.560]  lot of pressure put on it from nato and in fact very recently where i live in in neorega there've
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:24.360]  been a lot of uh helicopters clattering across the sky much more recently um the activity there has
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:29.880]  increased continuously and over the last year and pressure's been brought to bear on russia and i
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.560]  think hang on hang on dr buzz we got another commercial break we have a long segment coming
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:37.560]  up so we can get into ukraine as well as this legal case as well as what people can do stay
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.560]  with us we're talking to dr christopher busby from the uk we'll be right back

[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:43.960]  talking about the situation in ukraine you're concerned about that i want to get back to the
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:49.800]  legal case as well and that is going on the uk and the pushback that you've had about that
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:57.320]  representing veterans who've been exposed to above ground nuclear test decades ago but
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:01.480]  finish up with what you want to say about the ukraine first before we move on that legal case
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:07.080]  i think what i want to say about the ukraine is this that the that it seems to me that the american
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:13.480]  government is it is not dealing with the russians in a way that is going to result in a good
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:20.840]  outcome for the human race no i mean my daughter has his study is doing russian studies at university
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:26.280]  college and she spent some time in russia recently and later on in this year she will too and she
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:30.600]  told me that and i know this too because an awful lot of russians in latvia where i live because
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:36.040]  it's an ex-soviet nation latvia and there are lots of good things about that you know because
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:40.680]  the soviets did have this idea about the brotherhood of man and although i know that the whole
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:45.960]  experiment went a bit wonky in fact the people who were involved in all this are not they didn't think
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.840]  in the same way as the americans think um and the other thing about the russians is that they're not
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:55.320]  like the americans so you might imagine that everybody's like a human being and they and they
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:36:00.040]  they all think the same way but the fact is that the russians are not people that you can threaten
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:08.280]  yes and we see that we see a tremendous escalation after this but dr busby from watching the politics
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:13.400]  here in the united states i honestly believe that's what obama and the people who are running him
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:18.360]  really want to see happen i think we've got some major problems coming up in this country they know
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:24.360]  these problems are coming up down the uh down the pike uh just as they came back from the elections
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:29.400]  and one of the first things they did was to uh sign up the american taxpayer to cover all the
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:36.120]  derivatives of the bankers yet again after removing that away uh only six years ago uh so i think they
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:41.960]  see some real potential financial problems and as governments have always done throughout history
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:47.800]  if that happens and when it happens they want to be able to deflect the american people's anger
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.720]  from being directed at the government at the banks they want to deflect it
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:56.200]  abroad to an enemy that's outside the outslender we've always seen that happen
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:00.440]  the point is that the russians are completely aware of this yes they're clever people they know
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.600]  exactly what's going on but the point is they're not people who are going to take this lightly
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:09.720]  and so what they will do if pressure is brought to bear on them and and some critical moment occurs
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:14.040]  they will pop off a few nuclear missiles but don't don't worry about that will happen and then if
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:18.920]  if if if that escalates then my message is this because this is what i know about and this is
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:24.040]  what i've studied for 25 years i can tell you that a nuclear war cannot be won a nuclear war
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.760]  will result in the destruction of the human race in need of all life on earth as we know it this
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:35.400]  is because these these the idea that the doses can be considered to be the the key issue in terms of
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:41.560]  the the consequence to human health is nonsense it's not a question of the doses it's a question of
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:45.800]  the contamination of the planet with all these substances i've been talking about and as a result
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:51.000]  of that it will really have an effect which will which will be incomprehensible and and appalling
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.280]  it will be the end of life as we know it if we because i can tell you that as a result of these
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:00.840]  court cases that i've done and the studies that i've done relating to the nuclear test veterans
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:06.040]  we can see that the genetic damage as a result of even quite even just testing these things
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:11.560]  above ground it's sufficient to show that if they're actually used in anger above ground in
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:16.680]  areas of high population density you can forget you can forget the future because it will create
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:22.120]  genomic instability and and and these things that you've seen in praluga as a result of
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:28.760]  that the very slight amounts of uranium that have been used there will be actually a pandemic
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:34.200]  absolutely that's not they didn't explode a nuclear weapon in falugia they sent depleted
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:40.520]  uranium shells there and just from that we've seen horrific widespread genetic mutation
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:46.600]  in in the children there as well as the children of soldiers who were exposed to it now getting
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.040]  back to the soldiers and you you wanted to break the information about this legal case you said
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:55.240]  that you were getting a lot of pushback as you testified in this legal case in the uk
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:39:00.040]  referring to the the exposure of soldiers to above ground nuclear testing decades ago
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:05.720]  well that's right what happened was that over the last year or so there have been well i mean for
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:11.000]  the last three or four years i've been involved in in court cases in a in a a composite court case
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.680]  relating to a number of pensions appeals in in in the courts in britain and then what happened
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:23.720]  was that my my evidence was obviously going to win these cases and the evidence had to do with the
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:28.440]  exposure to of the servicemen at christmas island and maralinga to uranium to the similar
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:34.680]  sort of uranium the same sort of particles that in that we that were produced in falugia and in
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.000]  iraq but in this case they were produced by the nuclear explosions themselves so it's the same
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.560]  issue it's a uranium nanoparticle issue now the the the british ministry of defense is so anxious
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:51.080]  to prevent this issue from from getting into the court that at the last minute there was some kind
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:58.840]  of stitch up in which the the uh the the solicitors who who were supposedly on the side of the veterans
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:03.480]  kicked me out and said that they weren't going to consider my evidence at all so we appealed
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:07.800]  against that decision and i know unbelievable stuff it was yeah and so too these are the
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:13.000]  guys representing the the people who are trying to get uh damn yes i know but the point is they
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.480]  came in at the last minute and the previous guys representing the veterans pulled out so it was all
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:22.840]  the kind of orchestrated chess game you know to keep old buzzbee out of court anyway what happened
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:27.720]  is we appealed this decision and we went to the to the court of appeal to the to the upper tier
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:33.400]  and there was this this judge called sir william charles and so this went on for the whole of
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:38.760]  the last year and then as a result of all of this the the the ministry of defense lawyers the qc's
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:43.000]  came in and he said well this chap buzzbee's not really an expert you know and even if he is an
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.080]  expert he's the sort of guy who goes on alex jones show and therefore he shouldn't be allowed to
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:52.120]  come into court you see not just alex jones but you know various other things i do writing in the
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:56.120]  ecologist and writing in counterpunch and all that and that's not the sort of thing an expert
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:01.160]  should be allowed to do you see so the old judge he said well yes okay well i agree so buzzbee can't
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:08.920]  be an expert so at that point the two the two um the two appellants that that i was uh associated
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:14.120]  with as an expert at that time in the appeal they said well okay he can't be an expert but he can be
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:19.000]  our representative he can be our lawyer you because you can do this in the high court you see so at
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.120]  this point they totally freaked out you see so then we went into the final hearing about about this
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:31.240]  issue and at that hearing and by that time i had been i had been um well the whole of my effort
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:36.120]  evidence is focused on uranium i'm saying that these bombs are made of uranium so it's impossible
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:41.560]  that the that the exposure of the uh test veterans on the test sites wasn't to a uranium and since we
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:46.040]  know that uranium has all these effects in iraq it's certainly going to have the same effects in
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:50.120]  in the test veterans in fact we found all the same effects and i published a paper on those
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:54.200]  effects you know congenital malformations and so forth has that's been in the peer review
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:42:00.200]  and so and literature and so forth so is that is that uh yeah i wanted you to summarize since you
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:05.800]  are on the alex joneshow and you have a chance to address a very large audience summarize that
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:09.960]  evidence uh for it's just like you would present it to the to the court the point about the evidence
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:15.480]  is that it came it came out as a first of all as a sort of theoretical calculation and you'll find it
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:20.600]  you'll find the argument is is laid out in counterpunch so if you put in busby uranium
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:25.160]  counterpunch you'll find you'll find the argument there and also in the ecologist which is also on
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:29.880]  the internet so that's briefly that's where the argument is it turns out that these nuclear bombs
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:35.400]  contain enormous amounts of an isotope called u 234 which people don't normally know about but
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:40.280]  anyway theoretically you can show that this is the case anyway the point my story is this that
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:45.480]  what happened is that shortly after that came out i got a i got a paper that was sent to me a report
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:52.040]  sent to me by a veteran in australia which had been been put in in the australian uh commission
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:58.680]  involved in in looking at the test veterans the royal australian royal commission and then we
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:03.240]  brought that into court on december the second and immediately what happened was that the mod the
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:07.800]  qc's from the ministry of defense said this is top secret and you have to you have to drop it you
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:12.280]  see so the judge dropped the piece of paper and nobody was allowed to look at it and so forth
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:17.160]  and then they and then they said you have to put this piece of paper in a in a bag and you have to
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:21.960]  lock it in a in a cabinet and then we will send people from mi5 around to pick it up and so forth
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:26.200]  meanwhile i've gone to france you see so they were chasing me to try and get this piece of paper
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:30.040]  back and they were saying they would send me to jail and they would prosecute me under the official
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:34.360]  secrets act and so on if i had anything if i put this on the internet or if i didn't take it off the
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:38.200]  internet or if i didn't take the article this article in the ecologist they told me i had to
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:43.000]  take it off the internet they had to take the counter punch article off the internet or they
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.320]  sent me to jail i said i can't do anything about the the americans you know they've been a law
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:53.320]  unto themselves after the boston tea party i can't take it off and so anyway so so i thought they
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:56.760]  were i see i didn't think they were getting i was told they were going to send the french police
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:00.760]  around and the rest be on my boat but anyway they didn't well that's something for a wiki
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:06.280]  leaks to uh pick up and put on their side i guess uh they've already got the i didn't want to be in
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:11.000]  jail over christmas i have to say you know so i came back through that through the ferry port
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:16.360]  you know wearing a funny hat and and and dark glasses and and on my latvian passport so i hope
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:20.040]  they wouldn't catch me but anyway they didn't catch me you know and maybe they weren't going to
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:26.200]  but it's the sort of lengths they're going to try and cover up this exposure to uranium yes yes
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:31.640]  it seems to be a common malady with your government and our government that anything that
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:36.840]  embarrasses them anything that exposes illegal activity anything that harms other people when
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:41.720]  they want to continue harming other people they declare that to be a state secret and they come
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:46.040]  after you as if you're some kind of a traitor but very quickly there's one other little aspect
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:51.240]  to this and that is that the this this paper that i received that was supposedly top secret
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:56.360]  and probably i'll go to jail for saying what i'm about to say the the concentrate the the type the
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:45:02.040]  isotopic signature of the uranium used by and this is important okay so this is what i want to get
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:07.400]  out this is why i'll go to jail if they do go to jail the isotopic signature of the uranium that
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:14.200]  was used by the british in their nuclear testing showed that it came from america so in other
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:21.560]  words on may and on in may 2014 the the united states government declassified a document uh
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:26.360]  which which listed the concentration of the isotopes in the in the enriched uranium which
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:32.200]  they call or ally because that's or is oak ridge the oak ridge alloy the stuff produced oak ridge
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:39.160]  in america in tennessee and that stuff we had the formula in may 2014 because it was declassified
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:43.800]  and when you look at this other document that they wanted to send me to jail over it shows exactly
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.720]  the same formula so what it means is that the british nuclear tests use american
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:53.880]  uranium your american rich in enriched uranium so right right from the beginning the americans
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:58.440]  were actually controlling the british nuclear testing and you can see why because the americans
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:03.240]  at that time were the only people who had the you know in the west if you like you had this
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:08.600]  ability to to to produce these nuclear these hydrogen bombs and the british didn't know how
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:13.080]  to do it the british the british couldn't make a hydrogen bomb so my feeling is that the american
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:17.560]  still come out and make a hydrogen bomb just to get them on their side in the same way as they got
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:22.680]  them on their side but tony blair over all this iraq business you see right back from the beginning
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:27.480]  it's been it's been the whole of these that these these antics have been controlled by the by the
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:34.280]  pentagon oh yeah absolutely it's it's absolutely amazing let's talk about what people can do to
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:39.000]  protect themselves you've got some ideas about what the average person can do to expect to protect
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.640]  ourselves against the exposure that we see in the environment well briefly before i go there what you
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:47.880]  should do to protect yourself is to put pressure on your government to stop all this stuff and in
[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:53.240]  latvia we're doing exactly that so i i just want to say that that there is an outline of what we're
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:47:02.520]  doing in latvia in in a website called labie.lv and also bsrrw.org okay so so there's an outline of
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:07.560]  how individuals in their own countries can say look we've had enough of this because as a result
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:12.200]  of all of this these antics and all these power politics to do with the petro dollar and the us
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:16.680]  dollar and you know and the destruction pressure and all that you know we are all going to die so
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:21.400]  we want to stop that happening so that's the first thing secondly if you're talking about protecting
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:26.840]  yourself against these radionuclides actually you can do a lot by just taking calcium tablets because
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:31.400]  they block the access of strontium 90 to the dna and although i've been attacked for saying that in
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:37.800]  fact there are plenty of scientific papers in the peer review literature that were were were published
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:42.440]  in the 60s when there was a lot of strontium 90 from the fallout that show that strontium 90 can
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:47.640]  be kept away from the dna by having a high level of calcium in the body and it's not harmful calcium
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:52.280]  just ordinary calcium tablets and this also keeps uranium away chemically it would keep
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:58.120]  uranium away also from the from the from the dna so that's what you can do and in terms of your
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:05.000]  immune system you can't you you you can do you can take selenium because selenium tricks the cell
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.120]  into increasing its antioxidant status and that works i can tell you well that's very important
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:17.000]  information to have and and it's always it seems like it's always just simple things like supplementation
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.720]  like blocking it the same way that iodine will block the uptake from the thyroid you know taking
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:26.600]  up a radioactive material so it seems like it's there's a lot of simple inexpensive things that
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:31.720]  we can do but of course you're right we need to expose and educate each other about what's really
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:37.640]  going on about the long-term trend about what our government is trying to do in terms of restart the
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:42.840]  cold war and of course you and i both know that that's a major profit center for the military
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:49.080]  industrial complex even if they aren't doing this to try to have a way to deflect an angry
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:54.760]  population away from them internally to an external enemy they can certainly revive that
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:58.760]  profit center that went away at the end of the cold war they they turned a lot of that stuff
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:03.000]  inward towards a police state industrial complex here in the united states and of course that's
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.800]  being exported around the world other countries but i think it's uh is very important for the
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.840]  people to be educated not only about the health effects but about the political effects about
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:19.080]  what's going on now well the professor alexey yablokov said to me in the 90s that if you
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:23.240]  imagine all of the money in the world as a chess board and you look at all the squares on the
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:28.760]  chessboard all of the things that we do that are not military consist of one square in the corner
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:32.360]  of the chessboard and everything all of the other stuff that goes towards the research and the
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:36.360]  development of the production of these weapons and so on is all of the other squares on the chessboard
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:41.560]  so we could actually all live quite happily if we if we actually took control of the situation
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:46.600]  like we're hoping to try and do in latvia which is a small country in a way it's kind of possible
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:52.280]  to do that because it's self-sufficient but but but people in their local communities need to
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:56.360]  need to be able to see that in fact all of the things that are happening to them as a result
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:02.680]  of the money that could go on on on education and on welfare on on helping them and on giving
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:07.320]  them decent wages and all these things go to producing missiles and to producing nuclear
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:12.600]  weapons which actually would result in the death of all life on earth and and and just go to to
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:17.480]  arming the the masters of wars dylan would say in his song absolutely i think it's very
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:20.520]  important to get that message out and as i said at the beginning of the interview i think it's
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:26.920]  it's amazing and appalling the ignorance of people who are trying to push us away from
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:35.800]  fossil fuels into nuclear power not even taking into consideration the long-term effect of plutonium
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:40.280]  i mean we can we can talk about cleaner forms of energy than either of those things but clearly
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:44.840]  i don't want to see us moving into nuclear power if you could say with us one more segment i'd

[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.600]  we've talked about the the difference between just a low dosage of ionizing and the kind of
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:55.640]  exposure that you get from the waste of a nuclear power plant we've also talked about his court case
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:55:01.400]  amazing court case there in the uk where he was exposing some information about what the uk had
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:07.720]  done in exposing its soldiers to above ground nuclear tests decades ago the kinds of long-term
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:12.920]  health effects that we see the kind of genetic mutations that we see even from the use of depleted
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:19.080]  uranium in felucia where there's not even a nuclear bomb exploded but the horrific effects of
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:26.360]  genetic mutations there in felucia we talked about the ukraine the rising of nuclear war and
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:32.280]  i wanted to get his comments on fukushima bring us up to date and tell us what he thinks about the
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:39.000]  health risks and exposures we've seen dr busby that scientists have said they believe that the
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:45.080]  exposure the radiation exposure is going to peak in 2015 on the west coast of the us what do you
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:51.480]  think about that what should take well i i mean i'm sure these these studies are reasonably accurate
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:58.760]  and that the exposures will peak at 2015 i've heard various various predictions about this
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:03.800]  but i mean i have to say that the concentrations involved are nothing compared to the to the
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:09.320]  amounts that are released naturally by nuclear power stations on the west coast and indeed by
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:16.120]  runoff from the sierras as a result of the tests in this in the nevada desert so and we know for
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:24.040]  example i mean i was involved in 1998 in looking at the breast cancer cluster which was in in marin
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:31.400]  county and that was almost almost certainly a result of fallout from the nuclear tests in nevada
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:36.360]  running off and ending up in san francisco bay that particular part of san francisco bay in the mud
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:40.680]  and then we made some measurements there which showed that this was the case so that so people
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:45.000]  shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't discount the the possibility that would be some slight effect
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:52.200]  but it will be nothing like the like the levels of of effect that have resulted following the
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:56.200]  nuclear tests and following releases from the nuclear power stations in the united states
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:01.400]  including incidentally all of which are getting really quite old and dicky now yes so when talking
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:06.120]  at you're talking about the problem in the ukraine yes with regard to that zappa roger power
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:11.000]  station you've got exactly the same effect all along the united states yeah all of our power
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.320]  plants pretty much are i know i used to live in north carolina and they built a power plant
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:19.400]  there in the 1980s and that was one of the last one of the newest power plants we've got and already
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:25.400]  it succeeded it's a licensed lifetime and so what they do is they just say oh 25 years let's
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:30.040]  give it another 25 years let's just keep going with it they don't want the point is they don't
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:33.720]  want to have to deal with what it is when they shut it down because then they got the decommissioned
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:38.440]  it found somewhere to put all the spent fuel you know and then and then pull it all apart and and
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:43.480]  that's extraordinarily costly so basically they've warmed themselves on the power station in terms of
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:48.680]  finances and now they want to sort of go bankrupt and tip to away and leave it to the taxpayer to
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:52.200]  deal with them of course that's an extremely difficult thing to do because basically you
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:57.000]  can't deal with the spent nuclear fuel it's not possible to deal with it you know the consul are
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  absolutely astronomical as far as Fukushima is concerned um i don't think that you need to to
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.880]  expect i mean unless something very catastrophic occurs which i don't think it will you need to
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:13.080]  expect that the serious problems on the on the west coast of the united states but the but of
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:18.920]  course the japanese are continuing to have and will increasingly have very serious problems in
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:23.400]  northern japan there's no question about that and in fact probably they already are having because
[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:27.160]  there's been a more or less a moratorium on the release of any information about health
[01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:31.720]  effects in japan absolutely well that's all the time we've got i wish we could keep going but
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:36.680]  thank you so much for joining us dr christopher busby and of course you point out we've got a lot
[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:42.600]  of potential fukushima is here in the us according to our former nuclear uh regulatory commission

[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:19.400]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:33.640]  texas alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night you know we had the nfl
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:40.760]  playoffs this weekend and i think there was a very interesting story not who won but something
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:45.160]  about the surveillance state and we've got an article from the la times as well as a couple
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:49.800]  from the new york times i think really illustrate this well in one particular game there was a
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:55.720]  steelers fan tweeting that says his team was losing pissberg steelers he says well we're losing
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:01:02.680]  anyway 400 retweets and i'll run on to hind's field well the interesting thing is is that
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:07.240]  yeah he got those 400 retweets i think he got about 6000 the interesting thing is is that before
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:14.840]  he was able to do anything about it security came and ejected him out of the stadium say there's
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:19.720]  really a large disconnect in the american public especially in the younger kids like this guy
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:27.240]  there's a real disconnect in understanding how pervasively they're being surveilled by our
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:34.200]  government in so many different aspects of their life they just don't get it they don't understand
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:41.640]  how it's essentially a continuous monitoring of everything that you do now there are some people
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:47.080]  of course that do get it they did a poll this is a story from the new york times they did a poll of
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:53.240]  a lot of writers to see whether or not they felt censored by the surveillance state in this poll
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:57.480]  they looked at people who were in democratic and non-democratic countries in other words free
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:02.200]  and not free and their general breakdown of this they said 75 percent of respondents in
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:07.800]  countries that they classified as free in other words having freedom of speech 84 percent in
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:13.160]  partly free countries 80 percent in countries that were not free said that they were very or
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:20.040]  somewhat worried about government surveillance in their countries so these are not teenagers
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:24.920]  or not people in their 20s playing with social media these are writers and i think they understand
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:32.040]  what's really going on and that's really the question when we finally realize what the surveillance
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:38.600]  state is about are we going to bow down and cower to it or are we going to speak out and oppose it
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:43.960]  and change it and so they say they're certainly are feeling the pressure and so they set a smaller
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:49.960]  number so that they had avoided or considered avoiding writing or speaking on certain subjects
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:55.640]  34 percent in the countries classified as free 34 44 percent in the partly free countries and 61
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:03:01.960]  percent in the countries that did not have free speech reported self-censorship so i think that's
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:07.480]  kind of interesting almost 40 of the people who don't have freedom of speech who know that they're
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:12.680]  going to be punished still had the courage to speak out about it these are people who really
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:16.680]  understood the danger of the surveillance state have a british novelist who said the feeling
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:22.440]  that the internet is looking over your shoulder is now universal it's the government that has
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:27.800]  the techniques and the tools to look at it at will and of course it's the government that is creating
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:33.960]  the cyber security hacks that was what erin schwarz pointed out before he was either hounded to death
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:39.240]  or before they faked a suicide depending on how you interpret those events surrounding it those
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:45.800]  is a guy i don't believe that he was hounded to death he was a very tough individual who had defeated
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:54.280]  syspa and other acts to try to take control of the internet he was a meek guy but he was not a weak
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:04:01.560]  guy he was planning on getting married he had allegedly refused a plea bargaining deal from
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:08.120]  the prosecutor in that area and that was a tweet from her husband after people were criticizing
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:12.360]  her for essentially hounding him to death he tweeted out hey she offered him like a three
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:17.560]  month sentence and he said no that sounds like the kind of thing that erin schwarz who had
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:22.120]  fought the government who picked up this gauntlet who knew what the government's capabilities were
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:27.240]  that sounds like the kind of erin schwarz that we saw in public that we saw fighting syspa not
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:31.720]  somebody who took his life because he thought he was going to be facing a three-year sentence
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:36.600]  they said that uh and this is the interesting thing they say but a survey of american writers
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:41.160]  provoked some comment that writers fears were overblown that there was little evidence that
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:46.520]  american government took particular interest in communications of writers that was a 2013 survey
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:52.280]  i wonder if that was before or after snowden were they clueless or were they or was that
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:56.600]  something before snowden that was when the mask came off and of course this last year we had the
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:01.720]  mask come off in the military state stay with us we'll be right back when you're out on the road

[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:47.960]  and i'm going to take some of your calls here in a few minutes the number is 800-259-9231
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:53.400]  800-259-9231 we talked about a lot of subjects so far in the show today we talked about the fact
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:09:01.880]  that there is a bit of a mutiny a well-deserved mutiny in the gop against speaker bainer people
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:08.840]  are angry about him for bainer care and yes he is the one that pushed this through that tricked the
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:17.240]  uh his his fellow gopiers there who has essentially in the words of other gop congressmen anybody who
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:20.840]  tried to follow through on their commitments to voters follow through on the things that they
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:25.640]  promised in order to get elected he's removed from committees and of course he didn't have to do it
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:32.440]  but he funded obama care he funded the open borders for another full year did that before he got
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:35.720]  more republicans in where they could have actually done something that was why they
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:42.760]  uh the public elected more republicans in the house and senate was to work against these policies
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:49.000]  that obama had just declared as a dictator this is something that concerns a lot of people but
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:56.120]  it doesn't concern bainer so if you have a republican congressman in your area give him a call regardless
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:10:01.320]  of what political party you're in tell them to uh not vote for him for speaker try to get him out
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:05.640]  that's one way that you can pressure this before we go to your calls want to point out of course
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:11.000]  uh one of the trends that's going to be coming up in 2015 and is really going to be accelerating
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:15.720]  a lot faster than i think people realize a lot of people are thinking oh that's 10 years 20 30
[02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:20.600]  years in the future that we're going to have quote-unquote self-driving cars they're not self-driving
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:26.360]  cars what you have now is a self-driving car a car that you drive yourself you go where you want
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:33.160]  when you want how you want what you're going to have is a computer driven car that is controlled
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:39.240]  by the government and monitors everything that you do it's another part of the pervasive control
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:44.680]  grid that our government is setting up this complete infrastructure of tyranny and of course an
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:50.360]  essential element of tyranny is to be able to control people's movements that is what this is
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:55.160]  about the government has always wanted to make you dependent on them in every aspect of your life
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:11:00.920]  whether that's for clothing or for food or for education and certainly for transportation i
[02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:06.520]  can remember 20 years ago going to a town council meeting we had it was right after the soviet union
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:15.480]  had fallen and we had a local town councilor who had gone to the soviet union and came back just
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:21.240]  gushing about their public transportation system how for just a few cents you could travel from one
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:26.120]  side of moscow to the other and the guy that i was there with we looked at each other i said she
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:34.040]  has no idea what the true cost of public transportation is especially to the people in the soviet union
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:41.480]  it wasn't a couple of cents they lost everything they lost all of their freedom in order to have a
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:46.040]  public transportation system and of course that's what they wanted she thought that was so exciting
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:50.920]  because she wanted to be able to control public transportation so that's what's behind all these
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:56.360]  light rail boondoggles that you see popping up and in many cases like it was here in austin being
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:00.920]  voted down but there's another way that they've got to come after you and that's going to be
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:08.120]  with self-driving cars the ceo of uber has already said that what makes his service expensive is that
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:15.000]  other dude in the car with you and he says when that guy goes away we're going to be very cost
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.280]  effective and at that point when we have computer driven cars he said that's when you're going to
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:25.720]  see the end of private ownership of vehicles in other words in his viewpoint in this kind of
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:31.000]  fashion not necessarily socialism but a kind of fascism that we set up in america corporate
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:37.720]  fascism uber or whoever occupies that space if it's not uber if it's if it's some company that
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:42.440]  we haven't seen yet they will control and own all the cars they will rake in the money and they will
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:47.480]  pay off the politicians who give them access to that business and then of course they will work
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:52.840]  with the government to control your movements to make sure that you don't go anywhere if you're not
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:58.520]  one of the people if you're one of the people that they don't like and to track your every movement
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:04.120]  and to keep everybody away from certain areas that are going to be off limits except to these
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:09.480]  high-ranking party officials just like the communist party just like we're talking about for a long
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:13.880]  time with agenda 21 now of course the consumer electronic show is coming up it always comes
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:19.480]  up at the beginning of the year in january in vegas a drudge story drudge link talks about how
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:25.960]  this year there's a big emphasis on these computer driven cars they say confirming the relentless
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:32.040]  convergence of cars and technology a record 10 auto manufacturers will be on hand this year
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:36.680]  at the show that's going to be in los vegas next week the consumer electronic show they're
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:43.640]  going to have mercedes oudie bmw chrysler for gm hunday mazda toyota volswagen are going to ship
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:50.040]  hundreds of cars to vegas and they ask why would they do that only one week prior to the detroit
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:55.240]  auto show the industry's most important annual trade event well of course the answer is they're
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:14:00.520]  about ready to roll this out the technology has been there for quite some time it's really more
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:06.760]  of a legal issue and that legal issue was removed in the united states and removed in europe last
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:14.520]  spring there was essentially a joint pressure from europe as well as in america to say well if
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:20.040]  europe is going to remove the legal restrictions on computer driven cars then america's got to do it
[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:25.400]  or we're going to fall behind and of course as i point out in this article car buyers particularly
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:30.920]  millennials are no longer susceptible they say to the industry's traditional marketing tropes of
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:36.200]  styling horsepower and handling yeah who needs handling if you don't have a steering wheel or
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:42.040]  brakes when you have no control over the car instead they see the car as an extension of their
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:47.400]  digital lives in other words i don't need handling i don't need horsepower i don't need styling all i
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:54.840]  need is a good wi-fi connection so i can just stay in the back and go along as a passenger in my
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.160]  little virtual world that i never want to leave my little facebook and twitter i can keep that in
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:05.800]  front of my face even while i'm traveling back and forth from work to home do us all a favor and
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:10.360]  just get an oculus riff and lock yourself in the closet the problem is i don't mind if people don't
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:13.480]  want to drive i don't mind if they want to just be chauffeuring around and they want to live in a
[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:18.520]  digital world the problem is they're not going to let the rest of us have any control over our
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:22.760]  lives that's the real danger that i see coming out of this let's go to some of your calls here
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:29.560]  let's go to uh bev and indiana go ahead you're talking about blackmailing congress yeah my comment
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:36.920]  is this i mean i've taught employment law okay my question is this service on the committees
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:46.120]  in congress and the house impacts the income of that individual correct yes in other words
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:52.920]  you're paid additional money basically what i'm saying is bainer is blackmailing these people to
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:16:00.680]  vote his way and by removing them he's reducing their income and it would seem to me that there is
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:06.120]  some legal ramification for that well you would think that there's a legal ramification for a
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:11.560]  lot of things i mean we have a constitution uh that says that the president can't do whatever he
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:17.880]  wants and yet he does it and the republicans uh let him get away with it and i think that really
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:23.640]  kind of brings up uh it brings up a lot of points you know we hear uh a lot of push from both the
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:28.520]  left and uh some talk show hosts on the right like mark levin pushing for a constitutional
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:36.200]  convention look a constitutional convention isn't going to work we have criminals in washington and
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:42.120]  it doesn't matter what laws or amendments you add to the constitution why don't you just add one
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:47.000]  at the very end that says and we really mean it because they're not following any of the laws
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:51.400]  that are there and of course the real problem is is that with the kind of criminals that we have
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:55.800]  in washington there's no telling what they're going to do they might tell us that they're
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:17:01.560]  going to go uh pass a one amendment and they do something completely different so the question is
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:06.920]  how do we get these guys to have a backbone and i think bev uh do you agree that you ought to give
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:13.480]  a call to your republican representatives and tell them to uh not back bainer oh absolutely i mean
[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:17.800]  you wouldn't believe what i say that the republicans when they call anymore i think it's real
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:20.840]  important for people today because that vote's going to be tomorrow i think it's real important
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:27.640]  for people to melt their phone lines down because this is a real important thing here you know you
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:32.840]  can spend time going to the poll uh you can spend less time sending them an email preferably to call
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:37.800]  them if the uh switchboards are busy uh that's a good thing uh send them an email then at that
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:41.720]  point because that's something that i think everybody can do to try to pull this back and i
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:47.160]  don't know really what we can do other than to try to support people who are trying to get uh
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:54.200]  essentially a uh a puppet like a bainer out of office so there are some legitimate congressmen
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:59.400]  so that they can do their work uh thank you let's go to uh cori in north carolina cori you want to
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:06.760]  talk about floride hey david i have a comment and then a question for you uh the comment is first
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:12.680]  of all a key deception i think that takes place in the public education system and the empirical
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:20.040]  scientific model and that is that we only are a physical body and what i'm suggesting is that
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:25.560]  we were more than a physical body we we have uh emotional bodies we have energetic bodies
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:33.240]  we have in other words a soul and what happens is that various things whether that be programming
[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:41.800]  or gmo's or fluoride for instance uh what it does is it is it disconnects us from the software
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:46.600]  that actually drives our body so you might think of us as like a computer system you know our body
[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:53.480]  is the hardware but our soul is the software and so when things get impede you know the connection
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:19:00.200]  to your soul you you you lose the ability to make you know critical decisions and critically think
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:07.320]  about the environment around you and i think that that in itself is a good explanation for
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:13.880]  why we have so many you know people politicians or you know well certainly i mean we can even when
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:18.120]  you get uh if you don't get into something that is metaphysical certainly we can see the physical
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:24.280]  effects of fluoride we know that uh harvard studies have shown that in concentrations that are not
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:28.760]  much different from what we're seeing here in the united states that it causes a loss of like
[02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:33.880]  20 iq points amongst children and we have to ask if we're if this is something that is safe and
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:39.080]  effective why would you even bother to put it in the why would you put it in the water supply you
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:44.040]  can't control the dosage there's not any medicine even if it is safe and effective that you would
[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:48.840]  want to dump in the water supply so we know why they're doing it they're doing it to take the
[02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:53.960]  medical to take the uh industrial waste away from companies who would otherwise have to spend a lot
[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:59.640]  of money to get rid of that waste instead they can sell it to us at a very high fee it's a poison
[02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:03.400]  we'll be right back with your call stay with us vaccines may have the wrong strain of flu virus

[02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:25.880]  jeff in illinois jeff you want to talk about jeb bush go ahead uh yes david thank you for taking
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:33.800]  my call i'd like to comment on jeb bush's potential run for president in 2016 it's pretty obvious that
[02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:41.320]  the writing's on the wall uh that he's trying to gather the hispanic voting block um i reach out
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:46.920]  to a lot of the hardworking mexican people who've come over to this country trying to make
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:53.160]  a new life for themselves he does not have your best interest at mind he has things like the project
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:59.080]  for the new american century at mind and he has his own self interest at mind oh yeah he's a
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:04.680]  corporatist he's a globalist uh you know this is a guy who made tons of money after he left uh
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:10.440]  being a governor he made tons of money profiting off of obama care do you think that he's going to
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:16.520]  pull back that kind of mandatory unaffordable health care of course he's not go ahead uh it's
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:24.680]  just he's got a lot of nerve after his brother and his presidency once again i'm reaching out to every
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:33.400]  good hardworking hispanic person i know and and just warning them not have your interest at mind
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:38.120]  that's all i'd like to say thank you and have a good day oh yeah absolutely i tell you there's
[02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:43.720]  two words that ought to end the jeb bush candidacy of course he's he's got a sense of entitlement there
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:49.240]  that he can um you know he's a bush so he should be president but there's two words terry shavo
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:55.000]  he was governor when terry shavo was starved to death where they were they arrested people who
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  were trying to give her water that was criminal and don't tell me that you're a compassionate
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:07.800]  conservative he and his brother let that woman be starved to death by a probate uh judge in
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:15.560]  florida that was outrageous that i think more than anything exposes the fraud i know so many
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:22.040]  christians who support george bush because they think that he's this christian is like really
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:29.000]  do christians withhold a cup of water from somebody who is dying i mean that that is not what
[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:35.480]  they had the power to stop that and they let her die both he and his brother that ought to end
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:40.200]  that right there but if if not then take a look at common core take a look at what he did with
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:47.160]  obama care understand that this guy is a corporatist he's a crony capitalist he is a globalist he's
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:52.600]  another bush uh thank you so much uh jeff in illinois let's go to uh william in virginia william
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:27:00.120]  and by the way if you want to call in uh the number is 800 259 9231 that's 800 259 9231 go
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:05.640]  ahead william yes sir i just wanted to say um people need to be on the lookout for the next
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:10.120]  false flag i'm gonna tell you the scariest thing to me i'm i'm in the defense department
[02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:15.240]  uh defense department employee where they messed up with the previous false flag as they left witnesses
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:21.480]  in my opinion the next one will be the big one there's not going to be anyone with a video camera
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:26.280]  to show oh hey look there's some people jumping on top of a rooftop celebrating twin towers being
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:33.800]  destroyed this one's going to be it all this race war stuff is a ruse and the republicans
[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:37.800]  listening to me the republicans are being set up because when the next false flag happens the
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:44.200]  republicans will be brought in to vote for the next big war oh yeah oh yeah they've already uh
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:50.200]  that's where we really have to be concerned about not only about pushing war within the new republicans
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:56.600]  but also the fact that the surveillance state which unfortunately it was revealed and to the
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:28:03.400]  mainstream in 2013 but we have not done anything to stop it and of course don't expect the republicans
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:08.920]  to do anything about that senator uh richard burr who is uh the north carolina senator is now
[02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:14.360]  going to be head of the senate intelligence committee don't expect any oversight don't expect
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:21.160]  any transparency about the crimes and the overreach of the cia and the nsa the intelligence
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:26.680]  community he said that he doesn't think that the public ought to ever know anything about what the
[02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:31.400]  intelligence community is doing so you're not even going to have the little dog and pony show the
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:36.280]  criticisms that we got from diane feinstein which really were there primarily because
[02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:42.200]  she just caught them spying on her and her staff and that got her angry they were looking at that
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:47.160]  torture report for years and not doing anything with it and when they finally released it it was
[02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:54.360]  heavily redacted it was a whitewash it was just a slap back at the people who had uh been spying
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:57.560]  on her that was all that it was about but you're not even going to see that from the republicans
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:02.280]  and the other aspect that is going to be very dangerous is going to be syspa that's going to
[02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:09.160]  be coming back uh very hardcore there was an article wide magazine about our system our
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:14.600]  patenting system is so broken that almost no patented discoveries ever get used i think we
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:20.360]  need to push back on the entire copyright patented system if the corporate if the corporations are
[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:26.520]  going to try to use this copyright sham system that we've got right now to exert control over
[02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:31.560]  the internet i think we need to attack the foundation of this copyright system and the abuses
[02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:36.440]  that are there this wired magazine article is very interesting they point out that the majority of
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:41.960]  smaller and mid-sized businesses responsible for the bulk of u.s. job creation see the patent
[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:47.800]  representation not as a database filled with anything other than infringement risk in other

[02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:35.320]  and we were just talking to william from virginia a department of defense employee just before the
[02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:42.760]  break concerned about the next false flag william do you have any specific concerns about what it
[02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:47.000]  might involve or when or where do you have any any information like that or just in general
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:51.960]  you're concerned about the next false flag okay i'll say this i'll be i'll be brief
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:56.120]  you need to pay attention to government officials speaking about a nuclear event
[02:33:56.120 --> 02:34:02.440]  that the president that's saying that senators governors um they need to pay attention to
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:09.240]  where the president goes and when okay also pay attention to other national leadership
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:15.320]  globally talking about the potential for nuclear events pay attention to incidents that nuclear
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:20.920]  facilities i'm not talking about a weekly nuclear facility here in the state i'm talking about um
[02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:27.800]  some type of mysterious accident at a nuclear event the transfer of nuclear material that makes no
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:33.960]  sense whether the media will touch on it but then they leave it alone people need to keep their eyes
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:39.640]  open okay and we know for the people that have been watching this a lot of times we are told about
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:47.320]  what's going to happen before it happened the media um movies tv shows books news you name it
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:51.880]  they show it to us in the next thing we know it happened oh absolutely predictive program
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:58.600]  yes the loan the loan done yes absolutely and then it'll happen and everyone will be sympathized
[02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:06.600]  to it okay you're seeing the drills being ran in new york they have nuclear exercise pay attention
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:12.200]  if you do nothing else daily keep looking through the news google can be your friend if you know how
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:19.400]  to use it okay that's all i have to say people keep your eyes open and well absolutely and yes
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:24.520]  thank you so much william yeah absolutely we had the story that we broke here at info wars uh about the
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:29.880]  nuclear uh material the nuclear bombs are being moved at dais air force base where they were not
[02:35:29.880 --> 02:35:34.760]  supposed to be any nuclear materials moved we had a whistleblower who contacted us about that
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:40.520]  and he told us that the destination that they were going to was somewhere in south carolina
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:45.960]  coincidentally uh within a day of that this i think it was actually the same day we realized
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:51.080]  that a day or two later same day lindsay graham is warning people in south carolina well you
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:56.360]  got to watch out because we could have a nuclear bomb here at the and uh you know right here where
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:36:02.600]  i'm talking here in south carolina so we've seen that we've also seen gucifer who has hacked into
[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:11.640]  the emails of people like george w bush and colin powell and tony blair and a lot of people who are
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:17.720]  on the inside a lot of people who are in the illuminati a lot of people who uh at uh bohemian
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:22.680]  grove he hacked into their emails he said that he had discovered he told the new york times that he
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:29.080]  had discovered a false flag nuclear event scheduled for chicago in 2015 i'm sure they'll
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:34.440]  relocate it now that he said that but it looks like that is something that is on the horizon for
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:40.120]  them that certainly would give them cart block to do the next level of what they want to do to us
[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:45.960]  after everybody pretty much fell for 9 11 when that came out now they can uh with a false
[02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:50.920]  flag nuclear event they could pretty much do anything with marshal law set up any wars that
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:56.120]  they want to do and crackdown on america that's where the uh crackdown is going to come let's go to
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:03.320]  uh phil in florida phil you want to talk about jeb bush go ahead now yes i just wanted to mention
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:08.840]  some other things that happened during his governorship uh like that hose job of a recount
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:14.280]  that we had here oh yeah things would have been any better under gore but tappan harris was in
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:20.120]  charge of that and he said it was fine uh you know thousands of ballots going missing from volusia
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:26.600]  county right here where i live so i mean the guys there's no way i'm a registered republican i'm
[02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:32.920]  as conservative as anybody out there but there is uh except for when it comes to our warm longer
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:37.720]  but other than that you know there's no way i'm gonna vote for that guy and i'm gonna do everything
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:42.520]  i can't to make sure he doesn't get elected and you know when we look at the uh the the false
[02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:46.760]  choices that they're giving us you know on the one hand you can have another clinton or on the other
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:52.600]  hand you can have another bush that really goes back to the entire process the entire election
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:57.960]  process uh there's stuff going on in new hampshire right now where they're trying to crack down on
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:03.800]  ballot access even farther for independence and for third parties and of course i i'm very familiar
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:08.360]  with this game i was involved in it a long time where for third parties and for independence
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:13.080]  you have to go through a signature gathering uh petitioning in order to get on the ballot
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:19.160]  that waste a tremendous amount of time waste a tremendous amount of money puts a burden on
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:24.760]  independence and third parties that the republicans and democrats never require of themselves
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:30.360]  and that is the sort of thing that from the very beginning even who has access to the ballot
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:35.560]  once you go through that process they won't give you access to the debates and of course the
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:40.440]  mainstream media will completely shut you out but it's that kind of corruption from the very
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:49.320]  inception anybody that was watching in uh 2008 when Ron Paul ran understands the rampant corruption
[02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:54.920]  within the primary system of the republican party expect that to be far worse this time
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:39:00.120]  there's just so much control to make sure that we don't really have a choice that's why i think
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:04.600]  it's very important for people to try to change these election laws and of course what they're
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:09.640]  doing in new hampshire now is not just changing the number of signatures that they've got to get
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:14.120]  but they're changing the time frame compressing the time frame to try to make it absolutely
[02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:18.520]  impossible to even get on the ballot and then of course as uh the caller just mentioned we all
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:24.520]  know that whoever counts the votes whoever keeps custody of votes they can do a lot to manipulate
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:31.640]  that i think one of the most important things that you can do is to try to educate your people
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:36.200]  that you know and your circle of friends and your family try to educate them about the fully
[02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:41.080]  informed jury movement they need to understand what their rights and their duties are as jurors
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:46.920]  because that's one place if you're on a jury that vote counts and you can use that to cover
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:52.520]  your fellow citizen against unjust laws that's what the purpose of the juries was originally for
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:58.840]  it wasn't just to look at the facts of a case it was also to look at the justice in the laws and
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:04.360]  the way the penalty was going to be applied and to shut down laws like that whether they're state
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:09.000]  laws local laws or federal laws you can shut those down for your fellow citizen it just takes
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:16.600]  one person on a jury and jeb bush cannot tamper with that total uh let's go to matthew and tennessee
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:26.360]  matthew hello hey go ahead um well i guess i'm just calling i uh i was looking into uh possibly
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:32.440]  going on the nightly news here at some point um but anyways uh i've been a member of anonymous
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:37.720]  while i used to be a member of anonymous before uh there was a lot of plants and i mean because of
[02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:42.920]  the occupied movement there was a lot of uh a lot of potentially people there that were really just
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:46.440]  there to incite violence and stuff like that and so as far as the group was concerned the whole
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:52.040]  thing was just a total failure um but i guess one thing that's been a big concern of mine i'm
[02:40:52.040 --> 02:40:57.240]  actually looking at the picture right now um i was on a website and the fbi had put up this uh this
[02:40:57.240 --> 02:41:04.920]  warning that says warning anonymous day of rage and so i'd go you know check out the ops they're
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:08.520]  currently in operation right now and there's not a single thing about that i mean there's the million
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:12.840]  mass march and it's all about civil disobedience but they would never promote something like
[02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:19.160]  vergasan or something to that extent and so four times when i posted on this site to try and
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:25.080]  you know say something about it my comment got deleted um and then actually i've got a picture
[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:33.240]  that i i tried to put up on facebook and it says uh you know sorry fake it's not real um fbi propaganda
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:37.720]  my comments keep getting deleted and i'm gonna try to post it that says we were unable to post
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:43.240]  your comment because you've been blocked by the gateway wow and so kind of an interesting deal
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:48.040]  and then so i try to post the picture of that on facebook a couple of times and not two minutes
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:51.800]  after i get it up online whether it has text whether it has anything it's been deleted
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:57.320]  it's immediately yeah and uh and even when i tried to attach it to an email the only way
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:01.320]  that i was able to get to finally attach was i had to activate fear blocker and so i think somebody
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:07.560]  was in my computer actually forcing me to not be able to post it oh that's amazing and of course
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:12.440]  you know the uh the quote from julian assange i can't remember the entire quote but he's basically
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:18.840]  talking about facebook twitter uh social media he says understand that you are wearing it's like
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:23.480]  having all of your friends wearing a wire for the government when you get involved with social media
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:27.400]  those uh sites just as we pointed out earlier in the show uh that one guy who's sitting there
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:31.640]  watching the football game saying hey give me enough retweets and i'll uh run across the field
[02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:36.440]  and know if he was serious or not but in just a few minutes he was picked up they are watching
[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:40.600]  we need to understand that they're watching and we need to understand the fear and the paranoia
[02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:45.400]  that's a good thing i think that the government is afraid of us they need to be more afraid of us
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:50.040]  they need to understand that uh the american people are aware of what they're doing and
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:54.280]  we're not going to put up with it thomas jefferson said when the government fears the people there's
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:58.440]  liberty when the people fear the government there's tyranny i think that's the bottom line and we
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:02.520]  can't we can't pull back from that that's very interesting there there's a and when you mention
[02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:07.560]  that and mention anonymous there's an article that just went up on info wars dot com of course
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:13.080]  oklahoma law lawmakers are proposing a hoodie band and of course that would get rid of things like
[02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:18.280]  guy fox masks as well let's play a little bit of that clip there oklahoma law makers trying to find
[02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:23.560]  find a fashion if you have a committed a fashion crime here's what he wants to do
[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:28.600]  he wants to ban hoodies saying they make it easy for criminals to hide their identities oklahoma
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:34.040]  already does have a law in the books this one goes back to the 1920s originally drafted to help
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:41.400]  combat crimes from the coup clocks plan this ban would be an amendment i think this is a violation
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:46.040]  of an individual's right to choose what they want to wear as long as it doesn't you know violate
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:52.520]  it's not a fashion statement folks they want to be able to follow you everywhere you go i mean
[02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:59.560]  look at this article from july 15th 2013 chicago police start using facial recognition software
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:06.040]  to arrest suspects look at the article from this weekend from the new american license plate trackers
[02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:14.280]  to send passenger photos to police databases this is a a military industrial complex contractor this
[02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:22.040]  one is out of out of italy i believe so foreign country nevertheless um yes an italian defense
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:26.760]  contractor they're not just looking at license plates they're not just looking at the drivers
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:33.480]  faces they are going to get the faces of everybody in the car and it's going to be a guilt by
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:39.320]  association be very careful about that but understand that they're watching you understand
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:42.680]  that they're looking at everything they're looking at your face are looking at your license we've
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:48.600]  got the stingray program where they're constantly monitoring your cell phones without a search warrant
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:52.920]  we've got judges who are upset about that we've got senators who upset about that but guess what
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:58.440]  the senators can't look at this non-disclosure agreement that law enforcement has signed with
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:03.400]  harris corporation any more than they're allowed to look at the trans-pacific partnership trade
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:09.240]  agreement that's being negotiated in secret away from our elected officials away from all
[02:45:09.240 --> 02:45:15.320]  of the elected officials of all the countries involved same thing with the transatlantic
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:21.080]  trade treaties so the asian as well as the european trade treaties that are being negotiated
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:25.720]  in secret by corporate lobbyists we're not allowed to see we're not allowed to see the
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:31.720]  agreements or the activities of any of our local law enforcement or state law enforcement or
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:37.560]  federal law enforcement when they look at our cell phones why because they also have a non-disclosure
[02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:44.040]  agreement with a corporation and the fbi thinks that that is more important than the constitution
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:49.320]  than due process they think that that trumps the idea that they should have to go get a search warrant
[02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:55.320]  they think that that trumps the idea of freedom of information act we've seen situations in courts
[02:45:55.320 --> 02:46:00.920]  where they sent the fbi has sent personnel to confiscate records that were going to be
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:06.520]  turned over under freedom of information act about the stingray program and other programs
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:10.920]  like that from harris they confiscated those records rather than allowing those to come out
[02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:15.720]  they have told law enforcement agencies if you get any requests from a court if you get a request
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:22.840]  from a foyer request you notify us by phone and in writing immediately so we can shut that down
[02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:29.560]  this is the kind of criminal stasi government that we are facing this is a bureaucracy that is
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:35.480]  unaccountable to the public unelected by the public does not take into consideration any of our
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:42.280]  elected representatives working with and for the corporations and that includes the fbi
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:45.560]  look at the smart meters that they're putting in our homes and of course there's an article that
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:51.720]  was up on the dredge report from politico smart grid powers up privacy worries we've been talking
[02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:55.960]  about this for years that's just one of the aspects one of the problems with a smart grid of
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:47:02.680]  course if people republicans don't understand the whole issue of privacy they can understand the
[02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:07.080]  fact that it's going to be used to raise their electricity rates there's a privacy aspect to
[02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:13.880]  smart meters there is a financial aspect to the private to these smart meters and there's also
[02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:20.600]  of course a health aspect there's a documentary that shows the varying fields coming out of the
[02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:25.880]  pulsing fields coming out of these smart meters which are pretty high in power you can watch the
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:32.520]  bugs on a leaf jerking as this thing is pulsing don't tell me there aren't physiological issues
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:37.320]  with these smart meters so that's just the three issues right there with that one thing but of
[02:47:37.320 --> 02:47:42.120]  course they're going to roll that out to a hundred percent of the homes everybody that's on the grid
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:47.640]  is going to be spied upon we're going to be charged more for electricity based on the time of use
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:52.680]  and of course they're going to do it in a way that harms our health they enacted this in europe
[02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:58.040]  in italy when they put up their smart grid the people there demanded at least to shut down the
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:02.120]  health effects of that they still had the other issues remaining but they said you've already
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:06.840]  got an electricity line running into the house why do you need to wirelessly send this information
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:11.960]  back you can multiplex it over the electrical lines and they made them do that there but not in
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:18.120]  america no in america we do everything so that it causes the most damaged everybody but getting
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:24.760]  back to this oklahoma law where they're banning hoodies they mentioned the kkk you are aware that
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:29.640]  there's similar things like this going on all over the world in australia there was a protest
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:35.320]  there people were upset that they were banning face covering so these guys went to a protest
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:40.680]  wearing Ku Klux Klan hoods they said you got to take those Ku Klux Klan hoods off so they took
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:44.920]  them off and guess what they were wearing they were wearing burkas underneath because burkas
[02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:50.360]  are cool even though it covers just as much or more than a Ku Klux Klan hood would the burkas
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:55.000]  are cool and of course in oklahoma they're going to make exceptions for burkas as well see they're
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:03.640]  going to outlaw any kind of covering any kind of a hoodie any kind of a mask including things like
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:09.080]  guyfox masks that people wear at protests they say the exceptions are going to be parties parades
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:14.840]  and those wearing coverings required by their religious beliefs nothing there about people
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:20.040]  wearing masks at demonstrations you know we talk about what's going on the middle east
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:26.440]  and we talk about how the american corporations and the cia have dominated those countries most
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:32.760]  americans don't really have any any recollection of iran prior to the american embassy being taken
[02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:38.440]  over they don't understand the rage and the outrage of the iranian people at america for what the cia
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:47.000]  had done in their country the cia had engineered a coup of mosadeh who was elected they pushed out
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:53.960]  the then shah of iran who was an american puppet this is a guy who had somewhat socialist leanings
[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:59.720]  but nevertheless he was going to pull these resources back under control of the iranian people
[02:49:59.720 --> 02:50:07.000]  rather than the american corporations so the cia got rid of him and they put the shah's son in power
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:12.040]  and he was the guy that was there until the 1970s when i was in engineering school we had a lot of
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:18.520]  iranian students in engineering and they were very concerned about what was going on in their
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:24.920]  country and so i remember what was going on before they took over the american embassy and it made
[02:50:24.920 --> 02:50:31.160]  a lot of sense to me i saw a lot of uh fellow students there iranian students who were protesting
[02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:38.280]  what was going on as the secret police the savak that had been created and trained by the cia in a
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:44.440]  reign of terror in their own country and they protested wearing masks because they were afraid
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:50.440]  that there were going to be recriminations that's what we have coming in america well you can't
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:55.880]  even protest wearing a mask because our government has to know who their enemies are so they can
[02:50:55.880 --> 02:51:02.440]  take them down say with us we'll be right back with your calls this is a serious topic for all men

[02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:16.920]  talk about medical marijuana go ahead brice hey how's it going doing good i'm uh i'm a comedian
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:22.280]  and filmmaker here in the portland metro area which spills over into washington which is why
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:28.520]  i'm i'm really interested how medical marijuana is going to go cooperatively between the two
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:36.280]  states washington or again that now are both legal legal recreationally but i'm interested in the
[02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:43.320]  medical aspect because the federal ban just lifted and one thing i find particularly interesting
[02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:50.440]  having moved from the east coast to the portland area is that i find that medically it's half the
[02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:59.800]  price of it's at street price level so most honest medical patients will not feed into will feed into
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:06.040]  like a legal tax system and build roads and schools as opposed to having a real shady uncomfortable
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:13.160]  drive down of the dark neighborhood yeah they just get and i'm just interested what's the info wars take
[02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:20.360]  on what's going to happen and what we might see in july when or again finally puts that into
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:26.520]  effect i know if you drive through portland you'll see uh a marijuana dispensary about every five
[02:56:26.520 --> 02:56:32.200]  blocks well i've seen some articles about people that are concerned about um the people who are
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:39.080]  not legitimately providing medical marijuana kind of infringing on the recreational use retailers
[02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:45.400]  but you know that issue i i think is dwarfed by the fact that we just need to understand and i think
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:51.800]  there's a growing awareness of the fact that uh it's the right thing to do to allow people to
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:59.880]  have access to something that is cheap and effective in many ways why would we not allow
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:04.120]  cancer patients to have access to something that can help them with excruciating pain with the
[02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:12.120]  inability to eat food why would we shut down the compassion for that that's just wrong and why would
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:17.960]  we allow the government to bluff us yet again as they do with so many different areas as they do
[02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:22.440]  with the irs as they do with the federal reserve as they do with the war on drugs where is a
[02:57:22.440 --> 02:57:28.520]  constitutional amendment that prohibited marijuana why do we have two constitutional
[02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:33.640]  amendments to prohibit alcohol and we don't have one for any other substance uh substance well it's
[02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:39.400]  because when we enacted alcohol prohibition that horrible failure they respected the constitution
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:45.880]  enough to do that they don't have the enumerated power to prohibit anything they need a special
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:50.120]  constitutional amendment they never did one for any of these substances that they prohibit they
[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:55.240]  don't have the constitutional legal authority to prohibit this we need to shut it down at the state
[02:57:55.240 --> 02:58:00.040]  level i think it's a very healthy thing to see the states taking the initiative going up against
[02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:03.720]  the federal government i think that's something that is a growing revolution i don't think they're
