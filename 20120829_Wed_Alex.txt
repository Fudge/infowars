[00:19.040 --> 00:38.560]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.560 --> 00:46.880]  ladies and gentlemen it is already Wednesday the 29th day of August 2012
[00:46.880 --> 00:52.000]  we are going to give you the latest on the hurricane that is now flooding
[00:52.000 --> 00:59.480]  parts of Louisiana and our reporter our source Charles you'll we've given his
[00:59.480 --> 01:03.520]  last name on air before during Katrina but he had some political
[01:03.520 --> 01:09.240]  repercussions for it so we won't give out his full name today Charles we talked
[01:09.240 --> 01:14.600]  to him a little bit before the show now his cell phone is just going to voicemail
[01:14.600 --> 01:21.120]  he was scheduled to be on in about 10 minutes he says a levy has broken and
[01:21.120 --> 01:28.520]  Charles has been calling into the show for 14 years since 1998 everything he's
[01:28.520 --> 01:32.800]  ever reported to us has been dead on they're reporting that one levy has had
[01:32.800 --> 01:37.040]  water go over the top of it and that's not a big issue if it doesn't wash it
[01:37.040 --> 01:42.440]  out but the main storm isn't even into land yet and this could be bad they've
[01:42.440 --> 01:48.800]  spent 14 to 15 they argue the numbers billion rebuilding the levy system and
[01:48.800 --> 01:52.720]  there have been reports that the locals who got control the money along with the
[01:52.720 --> 01:57.520]  feds who divided it up stole large portions of it which is standard
[01:57.520 --> 02:03.920]  operating procedure hurricane Isaac Soaks Gulf Coast tests new Orleans levees is
[02:03.920 --> 02:11.560]  the headline out of Reuters today and Isaac's wins test energy grid upgrades
[02:11.560 --> 02:17.040]  after Katrina new tool for hurricane trackers is drones we're going to be
[02:17.040 --> 02:22.160]  looking at that in fact I want to open the phones up for people in Louisiana in
[02:22.160 --> 02:26.680]  the New Orleans area if you'd like to join us on air I'd like to find out
[02:26.680 --> 02:31.200]  specifically from you just quick reports on what you're seeing there in your area
[02:31.200 --> 02:39.880]  the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 now last night on the
[02:39.880 --> 02:46.440]  nightly news I had talk show host author Steve Quail on who has a lot of sources
[02:46.440 --> 02:51.640]  dealing with martial law and things of that nature and foreign troops training
[02:51.640 --> 02:55.120]  in the US which has now been confirmed I remember when you're talking about real
[02:55.120 --> 03:00.120]  Russians training and now it's admitted just amazing me in the very area he said
[03:00.120 --> 03:03.640]  they were training in Colorado just before years before it was actually
[03:03.640 --> 03:07.360]  admitted that that indeed had gone on people said he made that up he didn't
[03:07.360 --> 03:11.520]  Steve is scheduled to be on with this in the second hour along with Doug
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.360]  Hagman after that but we just talked to Steve he's eating to flip times with
[03:16.360 --> 03:19.880]  Hagman so we're figuring out what's going on with that that is all up in the
[03:19.880 --> 03:27.240]  air today now and why is Hagman coming on Hagman is a famous and private
[03:27.240 --> 03:31.880]  investigator he does consult with state police the feds and others and he has
[03:31.880 --> 03:36.000]  broken a lot of news in the past so I believe that his a federal law
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.480]  enforcement source I'll just leave it at that you know we get Homeland Security
[03:40.480 --> 03:45.760]  documents and the myack reports and things from our sources as well but our
[03:45.760 --> 03:49.960]  sources have said they don't have specifics they've just been told all hell
[03:49.960 --> 03:54.560]  will break loose in late October early November you've heard the police call in
[03:54.560 --> 03:58.480]  and break down crying from places like Austin Texas and St. Louis Missouri
[03:58.480 --> 04:03.440]  saying they've been told total collapse something huge get ready but that doesn't
[04:03.440 --> 04:06.880]  mean it's going to happen you know we had the whistleblower from the Olympics
[04:06.880 --> 04:10.080]  and it was later confirmed what he said there was basically no security it was
[04:10.080 --> 04:15.520]  all fake there were troops but they told them something big will happen at the
[04:15.520 --> 04:20.000]  end and it didn't so I want to be clear that does not mean that this is all
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.680]  going to happen but things go on high alert basically but we have seen
[04:24.680 --> 04:30.080]  Oklahoma City we have seen things like 9-11 and the DHS source told Hagman
[04:30.080 --> 04:37.800]  it's going hot Obama false flag coming and we're going to be getting into all
[04:37.800 --> 04:43.520]  of that today as well that interview is up at info wars.com from last night
[04:43.520 --> 04:50.680]  with Steve Quayle and Mr. Hagman Doug Hagman that is all up on info wars.com
[04:50.680 --> 04:57.200]  right now DHS source it's going hot Obama false flag coming that's in the

[05:03.000 --> 05:06.840]  blackouts get off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power

[05:10.040 --> 05:14.080]  the power grid and just how vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream news every
[05:14.080 --> 05:18.200]  day millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of
[05:18.200 --> 05:22.360]  dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity

[07:59.720 --> 08:05.200]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.200 --> 08:17.760]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:36.200 --> 08:42.400]  Ladies and gentlemen we are live another worldwide transmission against
[08:42.400 --> 08:47.720]  tyranny in defense of liberty I am your host Alex Jones waging war on
[08:47.720 --> 08:53.160]  corruption crashing through the lies and disinformation we are going to be
[08:53.160 --> 08:59.000]  covering the fact today that Ron Paul did get blocked out of the delegate
[08:59.000 --> 09:05.560]  process so that it could not be revealed that he had a very strong showing Ron
[09:05.560 --> 09:10.840]  Paul of course has now gone public with the fact we already knew this it was
[09:10.840 --> 09:17.280]  clear that he was offered a speaking slot if it could be pre-approved by the
[09:17.280 --> 09:22.240]  Republican Party by Mitt Romney's people and Ron Paul would not do that
[09:22.240 --> 09:27.800]  Rand Paul obviously did so that he could have a speaking slot and Rand Paul's
[09:27.800 --> 09:32.240]  positioning himself be able to run for president probably win down the road
[09:32.240 --> 09:38.400]  certainly better than somebody like a Barack Obama I would love to have
[09:38.400 --> 09:45.720]  Rand Paul as president compared to somebody like like Barack Obama but at
[09:45.720 --> 09:53.680]  the same time there's obviously a video clip up at info wars.com that breaks
[09:53.680 --> 10:00.920]  down hot mic catches Republican praising censorship of Ron Paul and Paul
[10:00.920 --> 10:06.000]  Watson's article says well obviously it wasn't on purpose because then they
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.920]  re-read the delegates for Ron Paul but one time the audio is completely off
[10:11.920 --> 10:15.000]  while they're doing it getting to Ron Paul and then again right when they say
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.040]  Ron Paul the second time it fades down and then the chair lady who's up there
[10:21.040 --> 10:26.480]  says say that again no one could hear it and they say it again and you could
[10:26.480 --> 10:30.960]  finally hear delegates for Ron Paul but before that happens you hear somebody
[10:30.960 --> 10:38.480]  laughing going good job whoever's running the good job whoever's running the
[10:38.480 --> 10:44.480]  mic cutting that off you hear other people going and this is this attitude
[10:44.480 --> 10:56.720]  we saw that in in Iowa we saw that unfold in Iowa where we had the
[10:56.720 --> 11:02.480]  Republicans bragging even on radio shows look the fix is in doesn't matter of
[11:02.480 --> 11:07.040]  Ron Paul wins he's going to be dealt with and sure enough there was fraud and
[11:07.040 --> 11:11.080]  there was fraud in Maine and then there was fraud everywhere else and so the
[11:11.080 --> 11:16.160]  issue is a Ron Paul in my view did not complain enough about that he don't want
[11:16.160 --> 11:19.120]  to look like a sore loser but I mean when it's fraud it's fraud you've got to
[11:19.120 --> 11:25.720]  expose it and at the same time as well I think you know Ron Paul did kind of go
[11:25.720 --> 11:30.240]  along with Rand and not make a big issue out of the fact that his delegates
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.360]  were being shut down so that Rand would get a speaking slot and these speaking
[11:34.360 --> 11:38.760]  slots are not that big a deal nowadays unless it's the vice president or
[11:38.760 --> 11:47.080]  president's speech so there's still this love affair with mainstream television
[11:47.080 --> 11:53.560]  or mainstream airtime I have been on basically everything true TV discovery
[11:53.560 --> 11:59.600]  channel history channel HBO trio I've been in films in major movie theaters
[11:59.600 --> 12:05.360]  nationwide with major movie stars I have been on the cover of magazines the
[12:05.360 --> 12:13.760]  cover story in magazines you name it and I'm telling you mainstream television is
[12:13.760 --> 12:19.840]  not what it used to be I will say when I went on the view I got a huge response
[12:19.840 --> 12:23.900]  because that thing does have like 10 15 million viewers but I've been on
[12:23.900 --> 12:28.760]  Geraldo Rivera I've been on it all I mean hundreds of things to the point of
[12:28.760 --> 12:37.240]  now I don't even return phone calls most of the time when the BBC calls or Fox
[12:37.240 --> 12:45.920]  News calls or CNN calls I mean I don't even return their calls to go on in
[12:45.920 --> 12:51.000]  fact Chris who's one of the producers I guess head producer in there trying to
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.480]  organize everything now he's like okay here's the BBC okay here's this there's
[12:55.480 --> 13:00.240]  that I'm like nope not doing it not doing it anymore I mean I've I'm really
[13:00.240 --> 13:04.360]  getting to the point where what's the point of having history channel
[13:04.360 --> 13:09.800]  discovery channel PBS here what's the point of having the CBC here what is the
[13:09.800 --> 13:16.280]  point what is the point and and I'm not going off into a tangent bragging that
[13:16.280 --> 13:20.760]  hey I'm I've been you know all over the media I've been everywhere man my point
[13:20.760 --> 13:29.040]  is I don't get the absolute groveling that people go through to get on
[13:29.040 --> 13:34.800]  television here's an example I've had people starry eyed go oh you were on
[13:34.800 --> 13:42.080]  Andrew DePaul a tonneau's Fox News show wow you they mentioned you on Freedom
[13:42.080 --> 13:45.840]  Watch back when that was on and Andrew DePaul a tonneau's a nice guy he's an
[13:45.840 --> 13:52.440]  intelligent guy I really like him but the show on Fox Business was number two
[13:52.440 --> 14:01.400]  on there and had 150,000 viewers I mean that's nothing Fox Business doesn't have
[14:01.400 --> 14:05.080]  a lot of viewers the biggest Fox TV shows have three million viewers Bill
[14:05.080 --> 14:11.200]  O'Reilly by the time Beck left he was down to two million or less I am just
[14:11.200 --> 14:17.640]  tired of emperors new clothes I mean I'm really sick of it I'm really tired of it
[14:17.640 --> 14:21.480]  I remember I was in New York to go on The View and singing in a bunch of other
[14:21.480 --> 14:28.560]  shows last year barely went because I had like five shows lined up I thought
[14:28.560 --> 14:31.880]  alright of the flying in New York for The View I'll do all these other shows
[14:31.880 --> 14:35.760]  The View said we're not gonna fly at first class I said I'm not coming then
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.920]  because I didn't even figure they put me on I said okay well nice talking to
[14:40.920 --> 14:43.120]  you and they called but they said fine they call back an hour later they go
[14:43.120 --> 14:48.960]  you're really saying no to The View I said yeah I don't care so they go okay
[14:48.960 --> 14:53.280]  you get your first class ticket you know get your non-stop just because I'm not
[14:53.280 --> 14:57.000]  gonna be they will get you the cheapest airplane and land you three times you'll
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.840]  waste a whole day you might not even get there half the time with their storms
[15:00.840 --> 15:04.920]  you get there and I just don't want to be around it all the fake people all the
[15:04.920 --> 15:09.200]  desperate producers and people running around you know groveling to a bunch of
[15:09.200 --> 15:15.000]  nobodies like Barbara Walters I mean I don't care and so my whole issue is I
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.680]  don't get jumping through a bunch of Republican hoops to get on the National
[15:18.680 --> 15:27.760]  Convention whoop-de-doo I mean my point is the old system really is a joke it
[15:27.760 --> 15:33.120]  really is a legend in its own mind now I'll stay up all night to go on coast to
[15:33.120 --> 15:43.200]  AM you know why because it's got about six million listeners an hour six
[15:43.200 --> 15:50.880]  million listeners an hour upwards of 16 million listeners a night I can go on
[15:50.880 --> 15:55.920]  that show and watch an additional million people visit info wars.com on top
[15:55.920 --> 16:00.600]  of the million that already visited every day the drudge report links to it
[16:00.600 --> 16:06.840]  links to us 500,000 if it's a little link down at the bottom but the top link
[16:06.840 --> 16:11.400]  we've seen three million additional visitors off one link at drudgereport.com
[16:11.400 --> 16:18.440]  that's media that's power so I mean I'm here to tell you what what has power
[16:18.440 --> 16:25.480]  big talk radio shows and things like drudgereport.com that's it and then
[16:25.480 --> 16:31.440]  down the chain info wars.com and I've got all this news all this information to
[16:31.440 --> 16:35.480]  cover I will be honest I've been jogging more and turn to do some weightlifting
[16:35.480 --> 16:38.720]  and I think I pulled a muscle in my back so I'm in excruciating pain right now
[16:38.720 --> 16:42.240]  it hurts even breathe but I'm gonna maintain here today if I sound a little
[16:42.240 --> 16:45.800]  bit distracted please don't call in and tell me if you feel sorry for me I'm
[16:45.800 --> 16:49.280]  just telling you so that I sound a little bit out of it here and there it's
[16:49.280 --> 16:57.800]  because I've got a muscle that's pulled or sprained in my back I need to lay
[16:57.800 --> 17:07.040]  off swim in two miles in icy water and the big natural spring here in town but
[17:09.040 --> 17:14.160]  I don't know why I went off into that I'm just so sick of the marveling the
[17:14.160 --> 17:23.160]  marveling at things that are a joke I mean it's it's just and the way people
[17:23.160 --> 17:28.680]  take themselves so seriously and the way they're legends in their own minds I
[17:28.680 --> 17:32.040]  mean if you look at media matters run by the White House and George Soros on
[17:32.040 --> 17:36.320]  record to think progress run by the same parties they sit there and arbitrate to
[17:36.320 --> 17:40.480]  everyone and say they're in charge of reality and say they're nonpartisan and
[17:40.480 --> 17:43.520]  not connected to George Soros when they're publicly financed by him in the
[17:43.520 --> 17:48.960]  White House total deception total eyes sworn in their own memos to infiltrate
[17:48.960 --> 17:54.880]  free press and destroy it White House transition chief is the head of it of
[17:54.880 --> 18:00.200]  think progress and they sit there and pretend like they control reality and
[18:00.200 --> 18:06.800]  and that's where MSNBC gets its talking points the biggest shows on MSNBC say
[18:06.800 --> 18:11.680]  they have 800,000 viewers and it came out in Nielsen ratings the minute I saw the
[18:11.680 --> 18:15.800]  headline that Nielsen had been caught faking ratings for money I said when I
[18:15.800 --> 18:23.800]  read this it's going to be MSNBC oh and I read the article and MSNBC was one of
[18:23.800 --> 18:27.760]  the culprits with fake ratings they don't even have 800,000 viewers at a time
[18:27.760 --> 18:34.680]  I mean these people are a joke but they're arrogant legends in their own
[18:34.680 --> 18:40.000]  minds listen it's over for the ruling elite it's over for the Federal Reserve
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.200]  crowd it's over for the kleptocracy bankers it's over they want to sick the
[18:45.200 --> 18:49.920]  giant welfare class that doesn't know how to tie their shoelaces in many cases
[18:49.920 --> 18:54.240]  against those of us that are still producers they want to bring in socialism
[18:54.240 --> 18:58.280]  at the grassroots and have their their corporate global fascism that's exempt
[18:58.280 --> 19:04.120]  from all their own regulations offshore they want to try to get our guns they
[19:04.120 --> 19:07.280]  want to try to brainwash our kids in schools they want to try to get all
[19:07.280 --> 19:11.920]  this stuff done it's dead on arrival you're seeing the beginning of the end
[19:11.920 --> 19:15.600]  of these people they can censor the web they can come in and shut people down
[19:15.600 --> 19:20.840]  it's over even if there's no one there to rival you because you destroy all the
[19:20.840 --> 19:25.400]  alternative media or infiltrate it and take it down no one believes you no one
[19:25.400 --> 19:32.920]  likes you you're a fraud wrapped in a scam with an icing of baloney and that's
[19:32.920 --> 19:38.240]  all I have to say I don't want anything to do with a sinking rotting
[19:38.240 --> 19:44.320]  establishment that is on its way out the zombie banks all of it are just that
[19:44.320 --> 19:51.200]  reanimated dead corpses of a political dead system that is only still crawling
[19:51.200 --> 19:55.600]  because you suck off of the productive people we'll get into the hurricane a

[24:24.120 --> 24:37.080]  all right Charles who's been one of our sources for 14 years in Louisiana
[24:37.080 --> 24:42.680]  always an impeccable source was he is in the hurricane in Plackman parish
[24:42.680 --> 24:48.520]  Louisiana and said that the levee has broken there and that was about 10
[24:48.520 --> 24:52.520]  minutes before the show he said there's people on top their houses he was there
[24:52.520 --> 24:56.040]  helping him with the fire department and that he was going to get back with us
[24:56.040 --> 25:00.080]  and now the cell phone goes right to voicemail looking like we've lost cell
[25:00.080 --> 25:04.760]  phone service so if anybody's in Plackman and has got a phone and can
[25:04.760 --> 25:08.400]  confirm this or tell us what you're seeing if they're reporting in some
[25:08.400 --> 25:12.560]  areas the water's gone over levees this is as the real bulk of the hurricane goes
[25:12.560 --> 25:16.520]  on shore now and pray for folks in Louisiana because they don't just have
[25:16.520 --> 25:21.140]  the water to worry about the feds love any excuse to come and raid homes and
[25:21.140 --> 25:25.600]  rob and loot and steal guns the police in the area obviously will enjoy robbing
[25:25.600 --> 25:30.920]  your homes well raping your wife or daughters and robbing jewelry stores
[25:30.920 --> 25:35.680]  and Walmart so government is obviously going to be the big whammy not just the
[25:35.680 --> 25:40.960]  hurricane talking to Charles last night though about what he witnessed back in
[25:40.960 --> 25:45.400]  seven years ago in Katrina to the day he said police from all over the US were
[25:45.400 --> 25:51.080]  leaving as they watched the New Orleans police robbing people and making women
[25:51.080 --> 25:55.040]  show their breasts for water and other things so I'm not saying police
[25:55.040 --> 26:00.640]  nationwide act like this but definitely a super bad news in areas of Louisiana
[26:00.640 --> 26:04.600]  which I just don't understand how anybody could act like that but I guess
[26:04.600 --> 26:08.040]  they're criminals I mean I guess that's what criminals do so we're gonna be
[26:08.040 --> 26:14.800]  going over all of that hurricane Isaac pounds Louisiana water pours over levy
[26:14.800 --> 26:19.360]  I gotta say though if I was a cop or even a citizen and saw cops doing that
[26:19.360 --> 26:24.640]  why'd the police from Texas other areas just leave when they saw the police
[26:24.640 --> 26:28.600]  looting and busting indoors and breaking all women's jaws I would have
[26:28.600 --> 26:33.520]  stopped them I mean don't you have a duty to stop someone committing a crime so
[26:33.520 --> 26:37.760]  I guess I can't say they're good because I haven't been in that situation so I
[26:37.760 --> 26:40.520]  probably shouldn't judge him I just don't know how we've gotten to this point
[26:40.520 --> 26:44.280]  where we just sit there and like oh well you're evil so you'll be the boss and we
[26:44.280 --> 26:49.320]  won't challenge what you're doing hurricane Isaac pounds Louisiana water pours
[26:49.320 --> 26:54.440]  over levy this is out of USA today just came out again in the last hour I pounded
[26:54.440 --> 26:58.680]  Louisiana with heavy rains and damaging winds today as forecasters of the storm
[26:58.680 --> 27:03.320]  surge and serious flooding will likely continue through the night Isaac was
[27:03.320 --> 27:08.920]  still maintaining category one hurricane strength but just barely with sustained
[27:08.920 --> 27:12.760]  winds of 75 miles an hour well that's the thing of its stalls over Louisiana look
[27:12.760 --> 27:17.680]  out it'd be better many experts say we just kept barreling on through and
[27:17.680 --> 27:22.760]  disseminating its water evenly not all in one spot an actual hurricane service
[27:22.760 --> 27:28.680]  center reported it was located directly over Homo Louisiana which is about 45
[27:28.680 --> 27:35.200]  miles south west of New Orleans south west so it's dumping water right on New
[27:35.200 --> 27:41.200]  Orleans the storm was crawling to the northwest at just six miles an hour that
[27:41.200 --> 27:50.320]  is bad news that is bad news they report upwards of 14 plus billion spent on the
[27:50.320 --> 27:56.120]  repair and expansion of the levees well there's a reason the people in the
[27:56.120 --> 28:00.320]  rural areas have houses on stilts that are cheap it's so they get destroyed
[28:00.320 --> 28:06.720]  they're not out of luck but New Orleans has been sinking since they built it
[28:06.720 --> 28:10.240]  400 years ago it's one of the oldest cities in the United States North
[28:10.240 --> 28:18.040]  America Western cities and all I can say is New Orleans may not be savable
[28:18.040 --> 28:22.880]  long-term I know there's globalist plans to move everybody out of there and so
[28:22.880 --> 28:26.560]  they could turn into a big industrial zone and I'm not saying that that is a
[28:26.560 --> 28:32.720]  good idea but I think they should say you know that people need to build houses
[28:32.720 --> 28:36.520]  on stilts and things but instead the feds are gonna come in there and take
[28:36.520 --> 28:42.240]  everybody's guns if these levees break and again he talked to the producer our
[28:42.240 --> 28:46.480]  producer about 10 minutes for airtime Plackman parish and was waiting Charles
[28:46.480 --> 28:51.240]  we know his last name he's one of our good sources but he's got family in law
[28:51.240 --> 28:54.880]  enforcement we'll just leave it at that and in the fire department we're not
[28:54.880 --> 28:58.280]  gonna say who he is because last time he said his name there was a bunch of
[28:58.280 --> 29:03.640]  repercussions with his family and others well he exposed the police shooting and
[29:03.640 --> 29:07.920]  killing people trying to get out of the city so it was his original reports that
[29:07.920 --> 29:12.040]  helped bring some of those folks to justice so he's a very good source and
[29:12.040 --> 29:17.800]  Chris is emphatic he said waiting to get on the air should I should have just
[29:17.800 --> 29:24.400]  recorded it right for the show and we had him the Plackman parish levee is broken
[29:24.400 --> 29:30.400]  I don't know that's what Charles said and he's been on a caller for 14 years
[29:30.400 --> 29:35.360]  reporting stuff for us for seven so we'll find out what's happening with
[29:35.360 --> 29:41.400]  that okay I got a bunch of other news of course new Navy SEAL lies dealing with

[34:14.920 --> 34:21.240]  dovetails with several issues scientists successfully hack brain to obtain

[34:28.840 --> 34:36.120]  but first this new report this new report that just came out yesterday a
[34:36.120 --> 34:44.080]  pill that treats and tells now I remember two years ago we published a
[34:44.080 --> 34:49.080]  natural news article we posted it talking about patents for pills with
[34:49.080 --> 34:54.240]  microchips and saying they would use this and put it in all pills to make
[34:54.240 --> 35:02.080]  people you know only take pills that have the tracker chips so we can be
[35:02.080 --> 35:07.880]  surveilled and we got contacted by the PR firm of the big pharma company saying
[35:07.880 --> 35:12.800]  that's inaccurate take that down we're not gonna you know make people take
[35:12.800 --> 35:19.160]  these pills and of course we refused and kept the story up but my point is is
[35:19.160 --> 35:25.800]  that they're like oh no this won't ever be used to to you know force you all to
[35:25.800 --> 35:30.720]  ingest tiny microchips so that we can track what you're taking and what you're
[35:30.720 --> 35:35.600]  doing but then sure enough now there's a whole bunch of companies coming out with
[35:35.600 --> 35:39.760]  all of this information yeah that was the story right there that Mike Adams
[35:39.760 --> 35:43.240]  did at naturalnews.com we had it up at info wars.com big pharma to begin
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.680]  microchipping drugs and they went absolutely ape over that well now it's
[35:47.680 --> 35:51.800]  a whole bunch of companies and here it is in Reuters let me just cover it now
[35:51.800 --> 35:56.440]  since I mentioned it if you have trouble remembering whether you took your pills
[35:56.440 --> 36:02.880]  on time your medicine may soon have the answer for you oh isn't that nice I
[36:02.880 --> 36:06.400]  don't need to even remember anything who needs to know how to do math I have a
[36:06.400 --> 36:12.400]  calculator who needs to walk I can you know just have robot legs of course all
[36:12.400 --> 36:15.840]  this has government back doors and it pills for anything from common cold to
[36:15.840 --> 36:21.080]  diabetes or cancer can be embedded with a tiny ingestible chips yeah that are
[36:21.080 --> 36:24.760]  going on all the major products too which they admit at the big consortium
[36:24.760 --> 36:29.120]  meetings for the RFID is called smart dust so they can track everything in
[36:29.120 --> 36:32.720]  real time not just your cell phone but everything and have the smart meters
[36:32.720 --> 36:35.640]  even if you don't have one in your house they have smart meters that read your
[36:35.640 --> 36:40.560]  meter where those will now interface with all your devices including these it's
[36:40.560 --> 36:44.880]  all admitted they have whole maps of MIT of how they're going to control us and
[36:44.880 --> 36:50.760]  track us and decide how hot your house can be or how cold the digital feedback
[36:50.760 --> 36:55.960]  technology devised by Redwood City California based protist digital health
[36:55.960 --> 36:59.880]  Inc. there's a whole bunch of these companies and also prompt patients to
[36:59.880 --> 37:04.080]  take their medication and even ask them to take a walk if they have been active
[37:04.080 --> 37:13.000]  too long oh great it bosses you around yeah I saw an article five years ago
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.600]  got up a Florida paper remember exactly where the point is it was all over the
[37:17.600 --> 37:22.040]  nose you've seen it where they where the government gives grants to old people to
[37:22.040 --> 37:25.560]  live in these managed communities where they're everything and their
[37:25.560 --> 37:30.000]  refrigerator is tracked there's smart meters on the house and then it tells
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.280]  them when to eat it makes sure they're eating there's a computer talking to you
[37:34.280 --> 37:39.600]  like the hell 9,000 this is all being designed to control us a surveillance
[37:39.600 --> 37:44.040]  prison the head of the CIA said it four months ago he said yeah we're watching
[37:44.040 --> 37:49.720]  you through your appliances you try to go buy new appliances all of them are the
[37:49.720 --> 37:54.200]  new smart appliances that oh it ties into your smart meter and your smart house
[37:54.200 --> 38:01.280]  hey I don't want that there's super annoying incredibly annoying and and
[38:01.280 --> 38:04.960]  you're being tracked because when you go buy the dishwasher you go by the
[38:04.960 --> 38:10.800]  computer the cell phone the clock radio you're paying in the cost for the tech
[38:10.800 --> 38:17.560]  mandated to be put in there to track you and I've talked to a lot of different
[38:17.560 --> 38:26.480]  top scientists on this subject and they've pointed out that a big part of
[38:26.480 --> 38:32.600]  this surveillance system is why a lot of tech doesn't work well it's why
[38:32.600 --> 38:35.720]  Microsoft products don't work well because it doesn't work well because
[38:35.720 --> 38:39.560]  it's got so many backdoors in it it's sending data back the entire time to
[38:39.560 --> 38:44.080]  Microsoft back to Google I mean Google admits they got caught I told you they
[38:44.080 --> 38:47.160]  were doing this years ago I told you they were set up by the NSA and CIA in
[38:47.160 --> 38:52.480]  1998 that's all come out mainstream news we had a CIA retired agent on who got
[38:52.480 --> 38:56.680]  so many threats over it he's refused to ever come back on David Steele in fact
[38:56.680 --> 39:00.880]  I want to get David Steele back on he said maybe later hadn't been on in like
[39:00.880 --> 39:05.160]  five years I want him back on and Dr. Stallman said he would come back on
[39:05.160 --> 39:09.800]  when he got back from Europe and in China trip one of the inventors of open
[39:09.800 --> 39:13.520]  source he doesn't like to call it Linux he calls it something else when you use
[39:13.520 --> 39:17.560]  that term I'm not really a tech guy the point is yeah good new the point is is
[39:17.560 --> 39:23.160]  that this is a takeover okay so I and the media always acts like I'm anti
[39:23.160 --> 39:27.840]  science no it's the opposite I love technology I love aircraft I love cars
[39:27.840 --> 39:35.080]  I love tech I love smartphones I love it but I don't like the fact that it's all
[39:35.080 --> 39:39.920]  designed to track and control me and backdoors are built into it that I'm
[39:39.920 --> 39:45.160]  paying for you're paying for the technology that's put in there mandated
[39:45.160 --> 39:48.200]  by the different telecommunications act and by the way we're under a global
[39:48.200 --> 39:52.920]  government already to a great extent this is standardized worldwide you know
[39:52.920 --> 39:56.840]  you've finally seen a big hubbub made about the Chinese tech built with all
[39:56.840 --> 39:59.840]  these backdoors guys you put that on screen people won't believe it that
[39:59.840 --> 40:06.800]  almost all the microchips made in China have backdoors built in it and all
[40:06.800 --> 40:10.520]  these Republican senators have gotten upset one investigation because there's
[40:10.520 --> 40:15.640]  spy tech in the in the v2 bombers and there's spy tech in the new you know
[40:15.640 --> 40:21.520]  f-18s and there's spy tech in the new helicopters and spin kill switches and
[40:21.520 --> 40:27.320]  the Chinese came out and said these are specifications you requested I'm not
[40:27.320 --> 40:31.480]  defending the Communist Chinese leadership the point is is that that's
[40:31.480 --> 40:37.400]  global it's not just the Chinese that are building tech with kill switches and
[40:37.400 --> 40:43.120]  backdoors it's all got it it's all got it because the globalists want it in
[40:43.120 --> 40:50.960]  there there it is defense tech dot org proof that military chips from China are
[40:50.960 --> 40:55.960]  infected security backdoor found in China made US military chip information age
[40:55.960 --> 41:01.480]  backdoor in made in China computer chips threatened US military Taipei times
[41:01.480 --> 41:07.360]  backdoor found in Chinese made US chips slash dot in full war security
[41:07.360 --> 41:11.360]  backdoor found in Chinese made US chips Alex Jones on and on and on and on and
[41:11.360 --> 41:20.600]  on and on now like where is my stupid tracker phone this little piece of
[41:20.600 --> 41:24.480]  technology where I can check the weather when I'm out on the road where I can
[41:24.480 --> 41:29.400]  keep in touch with my family where I can shoot videos and upload them on the
[41:29.400 --> 41:33.360]  road of what's going on it's a great double-edged sword just like Facebook
[41:33.360 --> 41:36.720]  hey we know it's an enemy platform we use it because that's where the battle
[41:36.720 --> 41:40.680]  is if you won't engage in the battle space you're gonna lose very quickly but
[41:40.680 --> 41:44.920]  you better be aware of the battle space and all of you out there that are in
[41:44.920 --> 41:49.400]  Cyop who think you're so cool you're a victim of your own Cyop this system in
[41:49.400 --> 41:55.480]  their own words plans on killing you and your family once this is in place so
[41:55.480 --> 42:01.160]  that is so foolish to think that you're on a winning team just because you know
[42:01.160 --> 42:05.240]  all of this what does it make it okay that you know that there's a global
[42:05.240 --> 42:09.360]  government forming and sending its electronic tentacles into everything to
[42:09.360 --> 42:13.800]  track and control society and turn off resources and then start systematic
[42:13.800 --> 42:17.920]  soft kill operations they're gonna accelerate those I mean if you think
[42:17.920 --> 42:22.320]  that's cute and funny if you think it's I mean look right here keep showing this
[42:22.320 --> 42:26.840]  every day the last couple months Harvard study confirms fluoride reduces
[42:26.840 --> 42:32.640]  children's IQ Fox News food concern a consumer you name it reduces IQ massively
[42:32.640 --> 42:37.480]  10 to 20 points depending on what variant of type of fluoride and how much
[42:37.480 --> 42:42.640]  depending on the city and causes massive cancer increases and all sorts of other
[42:42.640 --> 42:46.840]  nasty things they do this in the 20s again did you get a memo shy off
[42:46.840 --> 42:50.840]  officers in corporations and in the Marines and in the Army and in the
[42:50.840 --> 42:55.120]  Department of Defense and at DARPA did you get a memo not to drink this the
[42:55.120 --> 43:00.640]  answer is no you didn't get a memo you idiot what you think you're gonna sell
[43:00.640 --> 43:04.920]  out to a technocracy that's killing people and letting the troops use DU
[43:04.920 --> 43:09.760]  that's a death sentence but but but but you're gonna play along in the system and
[43:09.760 --> 43:16.480]  get your pension and go play golf you're idiots you're morons you cannot make a
[43:16.480 --> 43:23.760]  deal with an evil of this magnitude and it just goes on to say doctors want
[43:23.760 --> 43:31.360]  everybody to have all all pills over the counter you name it need to have chips
[43:31.360 --> 43:36.080]  show it so they can monitor you and track you because of drug abuse yeah
[43:36.080 --> 43:40.080]  they push all their toxic drugs on people get them addicted and now say
[43:40.080 --> 43:44.560]  everybody's got to eat microchips they've already found most Americans
[43:44.560 --> 43:48.200]  they're having autopsies done already have nanotech in their brain oh you
[43:48.200 --> 43:51.520]  think that's an accident they've already got vaccines introduced and test on
[43:51.520 --> 43:58.800]  troops that are coming back like zombies that wipe out a motion your free will
[43:58.800 --> 44:05.080]  destroyed basically lobotomized they call it the anti-stress vaccine the
[44:05.080 --> 44:09.200]  point of this technology is not to say you're being a bad patient the point is
[44:09.200 --> 44:12.920]  to have accurate data so and that's the double-speak it is saying we're gonna
[44:12.920 --> 44:17.240]  track you as a patient co-founder of the company chief medical officer George
[44:17.240 --> 44:22.400]  Savage said the swallower sensor is linked to a skin patch worn in a
[44:22.400 --> 44:26.760]  patient's torso which captured the report sent by the sensor about the size of a
[44:26.760 --> 44:30.880]  grain of salt the sensor has no battery or antenna and it's activated when it
[44:30.880 --> 44:37.080]  gets wet from stomach juices that completes a circuit between coatings
[44:37.080 --> 44:41.000]  of copper magnesium on the side turning a tiny electrical voltage for a few
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.920]  minutes this is just the first gen of all this and it goes through basically
[44:45.920 --> 44:51.440]  making the patients all take these and we're all that's going let me add to this
[44:51.440 --> 44:55.920]  is all quack stuff just like they've proven the the a lot of techers are a
[44:55.920 --> 45:00.320]  fraud they now have these brain scans at airports saying you know you're a killer
[45:00.320 --> 45:04.520]  or you're this or that that's all a fraud a scientist successfully hack brain to
[45:04.520 --> 45:08.360]  obtain private data it sounds like something out of a Johnny mnemonic but
[45:08.360 --> 45:11.840]  scientists have successfully been able to hack a brain with a device that's
[45:11.840 --> 45:14.960]  easily available on the open market researchers from the University of
[45:14.960 --> 45:18.600]  California University of Oxford in Geneva figured out a way to pluck sensitive
[45:18.600 --> 45:22.920]  information from a person's head such as pin numbers and bank information and it
[45:22.920 --> 45:27.680]  goes over to ladies and gentlemen let's just stop right there let me tell you
[45:27.680 --> 45:31.080]  how to hack the brain the Pentagon actually has documents called hacking the
[45:31.080 --> 45:36.880]  brain the brain has no firewalls from the 80s look it up full spectrum dominance
[45:36.880 --> 45:43.880]  the brain and beyond just look it up your your eyes are brain tissue they grew
[45:43.880 --> 45:47.800]  out of your brain in the embryonic development it hacks the brain when you
[45:47.800 --> 45:52.280]  look at something your brain is now accessing that information you show a
[45:52.280 --> 45:57.840]  man and an attractive naked woman it hacks the brain you show somebody
[45:57.840 --> 46:03.720]  images of a ice water when they're in the desert it hacks the brain so to
[46:03.720 --> 46:07.200]  understand ladies and gentlemen the brain doesn't have firewalls it's wide
[46:07.200 --> 46:14.120]  open when you're on an unconscious mode and just accept everything you're
[46:14.120 --> 46:18.640]  being told in a jellyfish mode suspended disbelief you are wide open to
[46:18.640 --> 46:24.760]  anything and everything now coming up when we get Doug Hagman private
[46:24.760 --> 46:30.240]  investigator advisor to police military you name it when we get Hagman on his
[46:30.240 --> 46:37.360]  source in DHS is saying Obama is quote going hot with a false flag and then we
[46:37.360 --> 46:41.280]  got Steve quell joining us to expand on that I'm also interspersed a lot of other
[46:41.280 --> 46:47.800]  news but let me just let me just put this out for you right now there have
[46:47.800 --> 46:52.000]  been four different Democratic Party fundraising memos that went out saying
[46:52.000 --> 47:02.120]  don't worry even if the Republican nominee ends up
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.760]  beating Obama in polls there's just gonna be a staged event there's gonna
[47:09.760 --> 47:14.160]  be a new Oklahoma City or 9-11 we're gonna blame it on the Tea Party also
[47:14.160 --> 47:17.800]  Robert Shapiro the famous lawyer Clinton and Obama advisor wrote at the
[47:17.800 --> 47:21.240]  Financial Times of London he said without an Oklahoma City or 9-11 Obama's
[47:21.240 --> 47:25.280]  gone yeah I mean they say their neck and neck Obama and Romney and sure it
[47:25.280 --> 47:29.480]  doesn't matter at one level but the system the crime syndicate behind Obama
[47:29.480 --> 47:37.240]  wants to stay in power okay and when they openly say without a terror attack
[47:37.240 --> 47:42.000]  we're done you have to look at that and say wow they may do this and they've
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.280]  been setting the stage now to shift from Al Qaeda to domestic groups in the media
[47:46.280 --> 47:50.000]  since I've been reporting this the last three years and since Glenn Beck a year
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.600]  and a half ago right before he left Fox News warned people that they were
[47:53.600 --> 47:57.200]  pairing to blame him well if you actually read media matters it's it's me
[47:57.200 --> 48:01.120]  and Beck and anybody else they don't like and even though Beck is somewhat
[48:01.120 --> 48:05.200]  controlled opposition from the right wing quarter because the globalists have
[48:05.200 --> 48:09.880]  to have a right wing to control still the the real heart of the global system
[48:09.880 --> 48:14.440]  is what they call liberal it's not liberal liberal at all but that's the
[48:14.440 --> 48:18.680]  core of the ideology is what we know of is establishment liberals so they see
[48:18.680 --> 48:23.960]  people from Glenn Beck Michael Savage and then going out more towards real
[48:23.960 --> 48:30.920]  media you know Matt Drudge Alex Jones they see us as in one camp and are going
[48:30.920 --> 48:35.880]  after us so I want to play this clip here of Glenn Beck a year and a half ago
[48:35.880 --> 48:41.760]  talking about how they're talking about staging events here it is why does the
[48:41.760 --> 48:46.400]  left need this violence well listen to a clip from a Democratic pollster Mark
[48:46.400 --> 48:51.640]  Penn happened just the other day and yet no one pays attention to it how can the
[48:51.640 --> 48:58.880]  left win the country watch cabinets don't don't really sell things president
[48:58.880 --> 49:03.000]  himself has to reconnect with the people remember president Clinton reconnected
[49:03.000 --> 49:08.160]  through Oklahoma right and the president because the bomb is removed and it
[49:08.160 --> 49:12.440]  wasn't until that speech that he we clicked with the American public Obama
[49:12.440 --> 49:17.960]  needs a similar a similar kind words of work for Obama needs a similar kind of
[49:17.960 --> 49:24.040]  event oh like Oklahoma City if only Barack Obama couldn't have the
[49:24.040 --> 49:28.400]  opportunity to speak to America after another Oklahoma City type event then
[49:28.400 --> 49:36.640]  he'll politically be in good shape Wow now according to drum and pike the
[49:36.640 --> 49:41.040]  founder of tides who drum and I hope you watch this week because oh it's all
[49:41.040 --> 49:46.600]  coming undone this week I will be the guy who causes the next Oklahoma City
[49:46.600 --> 49:52.640]  this is in a letter an appeal to advertisers of Fox dear Fox advertisers
[49:52.640 --> 49:58.400]  read this part of it no one left right center wants to see another Oklahoma
[49:58.400 --> 50:03.200]  City the next assassin may succeed if so there will be blood on many hands they
[50:03.200 --> 50:08.000]  are setting up another Oklahoma City they are claiming that one is coming and
[50:08.000 --> 50:14.520]  they've already marked the one who caused it but don't you miss Wednesday show
[50:14.520 --> 50:18.000]  all right show you violence and the pressure again the reason I show you
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.400]  this is I've pioneered exposing the false flag for 17 years that's why I got
[50:22.400 --> 50:26.920]  into media was I knew Oklahoma City was a staged event I saw the newscast that
[50:26.920 --> 50:30.160]  were aired here locally people got the tapes from Oklahoma I watched them on
[50:30.160 --> 50:35.440]  access television that was the last straw the point is it's good news that
[50:35.440 --> 50:38.920]  now Larry Pratt's come out and said Obama could be staging these shootings
[50:38.920 --> 50:42.960]  because he staged fast and furious people wouldn't even able to recognize
[50:42.960 --> 50:46.680]  fast and furious as a false flag if we hadn't done this and yet if you hadn't
[50:46.680 --> 50:50.720]  got the word out now Michael Savage talks like this Glenn Beck does Rush
[50:50.720 --> 50:56.640]  Limbaugh does this is what will stop false flag is recognizing it exists the
[50:56.640 --> 51:02.960]  devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist Alex Jones here
[51:02.960 --> 51:06.640]  with a great way to beat the blackouts get off the grid and generate your own

[54:00.240 --> 54:06.120]  the Genesis Communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones
[54:06.120 --> 54:14.400]  show because there's a war on for your mind so we have private investigator
[54:14.400 --> 54:18.480]  advisor to state police the feds you name it and I found he's got some pretty
[54:18.480 --> 54:23.840]  good information Doug Hagman he's got a homeland security source that dovetails
[54:23.840 --> 54:27.680]  with all the police officers you've heard call in and say all Hades they've
[54:27.680 --> 54:31.840]  been told is gonna break loose in late October early November October surprise
[54:31.840 --> 54:36.640]  is that the Iran war stage terror attacks where homeland security claims the
[54:36.640 --> 54:42.320]  Tea Party's working with Iran they are now saying that in army reports Iran and
[54:42.320 --> 54:45.160]  al-Qaeda and you're like that's ridiculous well that's because you're a
[54:45.160 --> 54:48.880]  Tea Party person and you know how Islamophobic they are and you can use
[54:48.880 --> 54:52.600]  that term I mean the average Tea Party person thinks Muslims are hiding under
[54:52.600 --> 54:57.100]  the table that new 2016 movie that's out basically says Obama's a secret Muslim
[54:57.100 --> 55:02.600]  who's anti-colonialist selling us out to him homeland security says I mean this
[55:02.600 --> 55:08.200]  is scrambled psi-op that that group is working with the Muslims hey let me tell
[55:08.200 --> 55:12.760]  you they blow up a city and say it the general public will get in line some Tea
[55:12.760 --> 55:15.760]  Party people will denounce their neighbor who's Tea Party and say they
[55:15.760 --> 55:20.320]  must be al-Qaeda too don't don't don't put anything past them cuz see people
[55:20.320 --> 55:25.520]  get caught up in the hype they get caught up in the pageantry of putting
[55:25.520 --> 55:30.080]  American flags out and getting all angry and and and it's all over the news and
[55:30.080 --> 55:34.880]  it's exciting we got hit by terrorist I mean it's like a little sick event just
[55:34.880 --> 55:39.000]  like 9-11 and other events were staged and we will lose our country with this
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.080]  fake terror if we don't wake up to it because it didn't just Obama the ships
[55:42.080 --> 55:45.040]  guns in a Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and it didn't just Clinton
[55:45.040 --> 55:49.400]  that staged Oklahoma City the evidence is legion okay it's a lot bigger than
[55:49.400 --> 55:54.320]  that the globalist that control our government are financing and protecting
[55:54.320 --> 56:01.040]  terrorists just like with NATO running al-Qaeda right now publicly and and
[56:01.040 --> 56:04.360]  taking families and threatening to kill their kids if daddy doesn't drive a
[56:04.360 --> 56:08.800]  truck into the police checkpoint full of explosives and then they get on the news
[56:08.800 --> 56:15.040]  and say oh you know the citizens are so mad their suicide bombing Assad
[56:15.040 --> 56:19.960]  foreigners out of Saudi Arabia backed by our criminal government which is the
[56:19.960 --> 56:27.160]  illegitimate criminal enterprise now our suicide bombing with al-Qaeda while
[56:27.160 --> 56:31.840]  saying the Tea Party the army is being taught is gonna link up with al-Qaeda I
[56:31.840 --> 56:37.400]  know this sounds crazy because it is the globalist are going into a takeover
[56:37.400 --> 56:41.880]  phase right now the wife's of which I've never seen so when our guest says DHS is
[56:41.880 --> 56:45.640]  going hot Obama false flag coming I'm gonna Twitter out that video from last
[56:45.640 --> 56:49.360]  night it's so important it's on info wars.com we better look out now here's
[56:49.360 --> 56:54.440]  Michael Savage two years ago love him or hating my appreciate the courage here
[56:54.440 --> 56:57.240]  to come out and say this he said this five times I know of because the clips
[56:57.240 --> 57:00.960]  are on YouTube that you look out the White House close to the election if
[57:00.960 --> 57:06.400]  they get in trouble will stage a Reichstag false flag here it is now I'll
[57:06.400 --> 57:11.880]  make another prediction I predict that very soon Obama will create a crisis
[57:11.880 --> 57:16.320]  along the lines of the Reichstag fire Reichstag fire I don't know what form
[57:16.320 --> 57:20.480]  it will take but I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are
[57:20.480 --> 57:24.960]  Ramam Manuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some
[57:24.960 --> 57:29.320]  kind and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton
[57:29.320 --> 57:33.600]  during the Civil War when civil civilian suspects were arrested without warrant I
[57:33.600 --> 57:38.000]  will tell you as I sit here I fear that every night as I go to sleep I put
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.600]  nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized control of my powerful
[57:42.600 --> 57:48.200]  economy and then and he goes on to say he thinks eargun trained terrorist
[57:48.200 --> 57:52.520]  during the White House and then list list some of the people that's of course
[57:52.520 --> 57:57.400]  was the group that used terrorism to create Israel ladies and gentlemen the
[57:57.400 --> 58:03.680]  issue here is the White House advisors are all saying this that's why Savage
[58:03.680 --> 58:07.960]  was warning because when they start openly bragging basically this broadcast
[58:07.960 --> 58:12.360]  if I'm proud of anything force this out in the open so made it safer for other
[58:12.360 --> 58:18.640]  people to talk about it now Hagman's law enforcement source in the federal
[58:18.640 --> 58:23.000]  government I'll just leave it at that is saying that they're decided to go hot
[58:23.000 --> 58:31.640]  that that Obama is going to stage a false flag he's even got names so we are
[58:31.640 --> 58:43.280]  going to go to break and come back with him and go over this stay with us this

[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:41.720]  coming up on the other side of this break we're going to be joined by Doug
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:47.040]  Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network and his homeland security source
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:52.120]  federal law enforcement level said that they've been told something big in late
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.240]  October early November probably a false flag and they said early on it looked
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.240]  like they were trying to start a race war we know the White House has been
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.520]  caught doing that that failed though with a whole Trayvon Martin thing as the
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:08.160]  truth came out said they use that poor young man's death to try to get it going
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:13.960]  but the article is up at info wars.com and prison planet.com in the featured
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:19.080]  news area DHS source it's going hot Obama false flag coming I believe this
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:23.520]  can be stopped and you know I've listened to Hagman for years when he's on
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:29.520]  on syndicated radio shows and TV I followed him I what his source is giving
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:37.800]  him it fits the MO I have and I think Hagman's a good guy I am not saying that
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:44.080]  there is going to be a big false flag but you better know you better
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:50.000]  understand that if we don't talk about it and if we don't expose it the
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.920]  likelihood of it is amplified I mean we had that guest on who it turned out was
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:02.680]  a famous TV presenter producer we knew who he was but it came out in the news
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.560]  that he had infiltrated gotten a security job at the Olympics and they
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.840]  were teaching them that there would be a terror attack and I said at the time
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.240]  that doesn't mean there's going to be one they do that to gauge people and
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.480]  hype up fear but there could have been an event if we hadn't exposed it I mean
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:23.200]  the British government with it with a MI6 asset a SWAT did stage 77 that even
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:28.600]  came out on Associated Press Fox News former Justice Department official
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:32.720]  Loftus John Loftus went public with that and that came out the London
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.920]  Telegraph but this is always months after something it comes out so
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.680]  governments got the underwear bomber on the plane the shoe bomber on the plane
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:46.080]  that all came out on C-SPAN and congressional testimony all of this is
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.600]  very very real and all of this is a real threat and you've got all these
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:54.800]  White House advisors I just played you clips of them talking about it even on
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.000]  hardball a mass shooting will help us connect a huge terror attack will help
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.360]  the president connect a Oklahoma City got Bill Clinton reelected we need
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.520]  another one don't worry fundraisers you know it looks like Obama's down there's
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.000]  gonna be an event we're gonna blame it on our enemies I mean this is so

[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:11.680]  I was breaking down in playing clips of Michael Savage the talk show host saying
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.240]  he believes Obama will stage a terror attack before the election to stay in
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:21.600]  power we played a clip of Glenn Beck they didn't get any national news when he
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.840]  did it saying Obama will stage terror attacks to get reelected or his
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:29.600]  handlers will that didn't get attention because they don't want to attack him on
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.920]  that how like they attack Dave Mustaine at first for saying hey they stage fast
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:39.040]  and furious they could be staging these when he didn't apologize they dropped it
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:43.560]  because they don't want to go there you have four different White House
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.880]  advisors sending out letters to fundraisers but also letters to sponsors
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:54.840]  and in the Financial Times of London saying if we have a terror attack it
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:58.120]  can be blamed on our enemies now they don't say they're going to do it they
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.800]  say without an Oklahoma City without a 9-11 Robert Shapiro I read the quotes
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:08.040]  last hour if you just joined us said we need a terror attack or Obama won't get
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.160]  a reelected you don't believe me just type it into a search engine if you just
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.440]  joined us I know there's listeners joining us every minute just type in in
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.120]  fact let's do it on Google in front of everybody there's my Twitter on screen if
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:22.600]  you're watching on prisonplanet.tv Obama gives stage terror green light now
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:27.320]  that doesn't mean we can't put the light back on red but that's what the Mr.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.640]  Hagman sources are saying that's what my sources are saying that's why we're
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:37.720]  about to get into all of this so this information is in everyone's face and
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:44.440]  all you got to do is type into the NSA search engine Google Obama advisors say
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:49.760]  false flag will get Obama reelected and you will get not just info wars.com
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:56.040]  you'll get Financial Times of London you'll get hardball I mean I just put
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.640]  the clip of them on hardball saying a shooting will help the president
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.160]  reconnect that was a year ago they constantly say it there's so many
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:07.960]  instances of it they say this like we're idiots they say this like we're
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:12.120]  morons and then the media every once in a while will attack those of us that
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.400]  point out they're saying it's like hey here's the elephant sitting on us in
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.160]  the living room these guys have a pension they got caught in fast and furious
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:23.160]  staging a false flag you know take Larry Pratt he was on my show right after
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.040]  those shootings happened he said Alex I used to think you were wrong but they
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.000]  got caught in a false flag of the fast and furious so we've got to look at
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.840]  these being staged and witnesses say multiple shooters in both events
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:37.880]  of course they're staging it I mean they'll stage other events they've got
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:42.760]  the motive the timing the UN treaty they're doing it
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.600]  I'm not up here risking my life for nothing I want freedom in my time
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:51.240]  not just for my children I was offered 12 years ago and 10 years
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:55.960]  ago and eight years ago big national shows if I would just cool all this I
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:00.280]  could have been the big neocon queen like
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.560]  Glenn Beck and I'm not attacking Glenn Beck the point is
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.920]  is that you know Darth Vader was good as well I mean he'll
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.800]  you know I think he actually has woke up some that's why they're trying to push
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:14.120]  him off the air the issue here is that there's
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:19.000]  good still in most of us and we decide which angels we're going to follow our
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.760]  lesser angels are the angels of God we've got to decide if we're for good
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.320]  or for evil
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:29.480]  there's two different things in this world there's good and there's bad
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:33.800]  and which side do you choose well I choose good
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:37.880]  judge smells would say good very good because
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.960]  gotta throw catty shack in there because I mean you're only alive once ladies and
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.920]  gentlemen so I don't get up here and say all of
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.200]  this because it's fun I don't get up here when I get death
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:52.680]  threats and physically attacked and IRS harassment and all the rest of it
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.200]  because I just want to have fun and scare the
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.640]  daylight side of people I have to say so many guests years ago that I thought
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.000]  were too extreme they've turned out to be right in many cases
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.280]  which I don't like I'm not happy we're being proven right
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.400]  should I play Glenn Beck Michael Savage saying they're going to stage false
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.360]  flags it's not just me saying it or more importantly should I read the
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:16.440]  financial times of London again to you
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:21.080]  should I play clips of hardball saying it my question is why do they think we're
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:25.240]  so dumb that they say Oklahoma City got Bill Clinton
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.160]  re-elected barring that President Obama will not be re-elected
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.160]  don't worry they'll be an event and we'll blame it on
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:37.080]  the returning veterans gun owners and libertarians and conservatives
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:40.520]  but not the mainline conservatives they're just actually globalist operatives
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:44.920]  that's how they control the country is by controlling the opposition
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.880]  I mean when they're doing this when they're saying this we have a real issue
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:50.840]  now Steve Quayle who co-host shows with Doug Hagman

[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.400]  the prospect of not being reelected so the word is they've green lighted
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.840]  the stage terror they're going hot now that doesn't mean
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:30.040]  we can't stop it because you've heard the police officer to the show
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.720]  you've heard our sources they've been told it's coming in late october early
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.520]  november that does not mean it's going to happen
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.000]  they could be doing this as a scyop or they can be doing it as a poison pill
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.800]  with the nsa to see who spreads it in agencies they admit they do that or
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.200]  they could be testing to see if we get upset and warn people
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.720]  or we could back them off but but but i believe Doug Hagman source i know he
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:56.760]  has these sources now we're going to break here in a few minutes but
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:02.760]  recap what your source told you right now uh and specifically uh where you see
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:07.320]  this going in the time frame he gave you uh Doug Hagman thank you for joining us
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:12.280]  well thanks alex for having me uh the time frame let's address that first
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:17.000]  within the next 60 days any time within it within the next 60 days
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.920]  two different scenarios one if something would happen
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.800]  whether it's economical whether it's uh as a result of we'll say the middle east
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.640]  becoming explosive all of a sudden or some other
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:36.840]  event out of the direct control of this group of people within this regime the
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:41.960]  obama regime then of course they will roll with that
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:47.720]  and exploit attempt to exploit that after all that's the best way to do it
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:52.520]  let's something happen let's exploit the the situation that way we don't have
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:59.400]  our hands dirty necessarily uh the other alternative and this is what my my
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.880]  source inside with access to high levels at the
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:07.080]  just said is this sometime between now and the election
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:13.160]  with emphasis on the the week 10 days before the election
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:16.920]  optimum time they would stage a false flag
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:22.520]  type of operation and and uh now this is only known to a very
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.960]  compartmentalized very small group of people
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:30.840]  and uh this this the the ghost signal that we're talking about
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:38.200]  is coming from of all people Valerie Jarrett and and uh there's also i've
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:41.400]  heard other people including now again this
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:45.240]  this is uh allegedly from Valerie Jarrett and
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:51.720]  allegedly from people such as Leo Gerard uh head of labor union
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.640]  they're all working together uh to advance
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:59.080]  this operation well what is this operation
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:03.000]  it's it's uh as according to my source
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.520]  it could be uh one of perhaps three at three areas
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:14.440]  one could be um a uh an operation something that will
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.440]  will elicit sympathy and empathy for the president
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:23.080]  uh himself and will depict the white guys

[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:28.040]  well i tell you this is bold of Doug Hagman and his
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:33.240]  federal law enforcement source it's bold to come out with this because they'll
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.920]  be able to probably track it back it's bold to name names because i mean i
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:39.560]  know who Valerie Jarrett is i don't know this other person
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:43.000]  and and and this is what his sources saying he heard from sources
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.680]  so getting past the names the point is we see a massive
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:51.640]  pr build-up uh demonizing libertarians constitutionalists saying we're
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:54.840]  terrorist FEMA training videos everywhere about it
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.360]  all these top white house people saying boy
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:01.640]  it should be great to have a terror attack and blame it on our enemies
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.280]  and they have a history of it with Oklahoma City
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:06.920]  now the deputy attorney general intimately involved in the cover-up
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:09.880]  bare minimum of that that came out in court
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.400]  running fast and furious to blame the second amendment so they're prime
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:17.960]  suspects that's why i'm going with this and we need to be able to turn this
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.200]  around why do you i mean going over your source
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.280]  did they say uh because the quote is going hot
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:29.800]  it's going hot which in military terms for those that don't know it means
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.960]  into a hot war i mean it's it's it's it's about to uh all hell's about to
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:38.120]  break loose to basically break it down i mean
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:41.720]  give us the data dump did did your source centers anyway to stop it
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:46.040]  uh how does it tie in with a sex scandal i know that's happening
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:49.480]  yeah and if i may just just briefly alex uh
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:54.040]  not that you need my endorsement in any way shape or form but let me just say
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.400]  this so people understand where i'm coming from
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:01.400]  i've got a lot of 27 years and in the uh investigative business i've got a
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:05.320]  lot of law enforcement contacts i used to hear
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.000]  what you were telling about what you were saying on the radio
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.920]  and uh for instance about Oklahoma City and other issues now i would think
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.600]  you know what there's no way there's absolutely no way
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:21.000]  that uh alex can be correct on this and and
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.320]  and i want to apologize to the people i've talked to and perhaps influence
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:29.960]  into that way of thinking because you know when you take the uh the blinders
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:34.520]  off and you start looking at this as a normal investigation
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:39.640]  oh yeah now we're finding a everything that you've been saying everything that
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:43.800]  steve quill has been saying i used to fight him hard tooth and nail i was a
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.200]  bad student you know with him but i gotta tell you something uh for those
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:52.440]  listening out there who doubt in any way shape or form what you're saying
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:56.280]  and what you've been saying don't don't doubt it because we look
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:59.960]  we've done the investigation you've done the investigation and i gotta tell you
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.480]  something it's not i mean it's everything you say it is and it's
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:07.560]  everything that we're saying it is now to answer your question
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:12.600]  the source that i've got uh said look i cannot
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:19.160]  right now it for a lot of reasons um because he is a valuable informational
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:23.800]  and operational asset for the resistance if you will
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:29.160]  i cannot do anything overtly come out to go to the press and say here's what's
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:33.720]  happening because there's no documentation that's available
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.480]  the way these people are setting this up when i say these people i'm referring to
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.080]  the uh the communications between the white house and the department of
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:45.240]  homeland security they're not stupid there's nothing on paper
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.600]  there's nothing they're not leaving a trail they're not leaving any
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:54.360]  documentation this is not 1972 73 watergate that
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:58.040]  how does your how does your source discover this did he say that
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:02.680]  um yeah initially by frankly initially by accident
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.160]  and being in the right place at the right time and he overhearing something
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.800]  and then be friending a certain individual within the
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:15.480]  within the major part of the homeland or within the
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:20.120]  upper echelon of of homeland security uh within that leadership realm and and
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:26.280]  because of that because because he was able to infiltrate it if i
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:32.360]  guess that's the best word uh then he found himself involved of late looking
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.720]  at the sex scandal that you talked about
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:41.320]  and how that plays into this whole thing um you know the the sexual perversion
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:46.680]  surrounding uh uh jennon napolitano and the fact that people because they are
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.120]  involved in this and as you know the feds are now trying to block
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:53.400]  the suit being public and block new documents and discovery
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:57.880]  which shows they're guilty of sin that exactly can you tell us what your source
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:02.840]  said the sexual stuff is well you know it's uh
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:08.360]  the uh there's different levels but one of where it affects my source and in
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:12.200]  one of the yeah don't name names but just one type of stuff right
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:18.520]  you're talking about um uh promotions based on uh sexual
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.800]  performance you're talking about promotions based on
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:25.960]  in access this is well that's admitted i mean they they call them in and say
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:29.400]  perform okay yeah well yeah i'm not exactly certain

[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:36.840]  and talk about it on the other side and then and then get into this false flag
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:40.440]  what type of false flag it could be what we should look for
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.800]  um but we know they try to provocateur race riots with the trevon martin thing
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:47.400]  i mean they had the just department in there that came out so

[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.640]  in this country i don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.960]  vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream news
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:17.000]  every day millions of people have lost their power in the
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.280]  last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:24.440]  that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity i've always said that every
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:28.360]  family needs to be ready for blackouts and if you don't have a backup system
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:31.080]  in place i've got a great opportunity for you
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:34.680]  right now our good friends at solutions from science are offering huge
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:37.880]  savings on their best-selling power hub unit

[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:44.040]  it's literally thousands of dollars in savings
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:47.800]  remember these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:50.760]  that means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise

[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:19.800]  uh david orteez and rob Jacobson and they said basically
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:24.040]  you know it's that obama is going to overthrow us with the muslims maybe that
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.840]  i should not but think that was a joke maybe they're running al-qaeda
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:30.360]  hey man i guess an al-qaeda attacks us they use that to take our rights away but
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.760]  the point is it's just kind of neo-confare uh we're seeing explosive

[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:29.720]  steam quail coming on because i brought us some of my questions but
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:33.320]  we're not just in a vacuum saying obama's gonna stage stuff and i want to get back
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:36.200]  into what your source said every little piece of data
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:41.080]  without you and i going back and forth would provide us uh here with our guest
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:44.760]  who i believe uh you know has this source you've put out a lot of good info in
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:48.680]  the past this is what my sources are saying but more vague just we're told
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:51.800]  get ready for all you know what to break loose in late
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:55.640]  october early november again and if we're successful and back and off
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:57.960]  they'll say you said this was going to happen
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:03.160]  i'm not saying that was going to happen uh i'm saying this is what our sources
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:06.840]  are saying i mean our our source on the olympics was confirmed to be a famous
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:10.840]  tv producer who did infiltrate and they later admitted it was a security
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:13.480]  disaster and they were told something was going to happen
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:16.920]  but they do this quite often my issue is
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:20.920]  did we back it off or was it a psi op i don't know but they're gearing up a
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.760]  billion point uh 400 million bullets one billion
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:29.080]  400 million bullets armored checkpoints tanks driving around everywhere
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:33.160]  a giant black armored vehicles everywhere surveillance going in all
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:37.240]  sorts of federalization police being given federal i d cards
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:39.960]  this thing they're getting ready for financial collapse in the washington
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:43.320]  post and fox news i mean all this is there
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:47.400]  and and and so i'm saying we better be concerned
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.760]  because the stars are aligning with the iran situation
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:54.600]  israel's saying they may attack in october or november uh we've got the
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.720]  election so they love october surprises we've got
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:04.520]  all these things lining up and my gut is saying danger will robinson
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.880]  you know robbie the robot whenever something's approaching there is
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:11.480]  something approaching from the southwest i mean i i i'm saying
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:16.280]  this is the season of it and i see the preparation the hyping the pushing
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:19.960]  the oh the the conservatives the libertarians the the talk show hosts
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:23.560]  like alex jones and and and and and matt drudge and
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:27.320]  and and and glenn beckon they're gonna cause violence they're gonna
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:30.280]  they're they're they're planning it you know an overthrow there
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:32.920]  and then you've got a group that's been caught doing false flags let's not
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:37.160]  forget they had fast and furious it we would be insane
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:41.800]  with sources like um the one our guest has not be concerned so i want you to
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.680]  continue here doug hagman and want to give out
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:48.680]  your website uh as well homeland security us
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:51.800]  dot com or you break down what's really happening with homeland security
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:55.720]  homeland security us dot com you've got the floor for the next 20
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:59.320]  minutes ahead of steve quill joining us uh
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:03.640]  a why do you think they're so bold and talking about how false flags will help
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:07.400]  them in front of us on tv like we don't hear them
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:11.480]  what is that there is that just pure criminal hubris
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.480]  and then you've got the floor tell me everything your source said
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:20.600]  well okay yeah starting from what you just said alex uh you know the boldness
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:24.520]  that bothered me a lot because when i deal with the criminal
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:28.760]  elements they're very uh covert they're quiet they're
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:33.800]  the conspiracies are are underneath the you know under the cloak of darkness
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:38.680]  why do we why are we hearing about this so openly and i think
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:42.920]  one of the reasons is that the people don't
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:47.480]  get it or there's this normalcy bias there's this tendency for people not
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:51.800]  to believe it and i asked look i asked my sources to
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:56.840]  i said number one why you know why now why can't you for example
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.800]  go public uh and and he came back and said what do you think i'm doing
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.880]  we are i am going public i am telling you i'm trying to get the word out
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:09.160]  you know it's not like i can go down to the new york times and they're gonna
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:12.600]  print this we have to use people like yourself and of
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:16.200]  course i've known this person for a long time but that said
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:22.440]  uh i i do believe that uh the uh it's it's not in the open because
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:26.520]  it's almost as if no one really cares i mean no one
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:31.000]  or they don't believe it or even if it does happen
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.160]  it they won't believe the origin of it now
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:39.480]  what what is it what are we talking about for example what is
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:43.800]  what and i asked my source okay what should we be looking for
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:47.880]  um and he said frankly you know uh where i'm not sure
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:51.960]  i because the talk among the high level
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:57.080]  people that that he has access to it has been pretty
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:02.440]  vague purposely vague now is i understand it as he understands it
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:06.520]  there are a couple of different potential possibilities
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:13.160]  when he said all right it's going hot and those were his words and he was very
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:16.680]  adamant about this he said there has been approval
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:21.320]  from the white house sources for from the white house people
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:28.680]  to go ahead with a plan whether it's plan a it could be a racially
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:33.400]  triggered event plan b an economic triggered event
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:40.680]  or plan c staging for example um riots in different cities they've got the
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:43.720]  personnel to do this too that was the other thing
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:47.640]  and and also i'm giving you information that i withheld from any
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:52.200]  written article um because i knew i was going to be doing some
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:56.840]  interviews but look we wouldn't they've got the the people
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:02.760]  to engage in uh a provocative uh type of activities
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:06.840]  to we'll say to storm a county courthouse to storm
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:11.720]  a federal building in opposition or because of some protest or
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:16.040]  whatever or even to storm facilities in washington
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:19.800]  remember remember that shooting at the white house you're not too long ago
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:25.720]  the eyes my source said the one person in particular
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:30.360]  um is jarrett was very upset that that was not played up better in the media
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:34.360]  because here it is most likely a white gun owner
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:38.360]  shooting at the house of a black president obama wasn't even in the
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:41.880]  white house again they're trying to make this a racial
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:48.360]  uh a racial issue and um so so it the it the trigger event the the actual
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:52.440]  event that's being talked about it's rather vague
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:58.040]  but uh you know look it's going to be something that's going is the intent
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:02.840]  here according to my source and i took opious notes when i spoke to him on a
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:08.760]  couple of different occasions the intent is to is to really galvanize
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:15.160]  that chasm that uh difference between the uh the the races
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:23.320]  or the classes whatever it might be um to to make sure that that there is
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:28.840]  white versus black or white versus you know uh uh whoever
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:37.320]  okay where where the gun owning christian pro constitutionalist
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:40.280]  they are going to everything that you pointed out in the mayak report that
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.440]  the returning veterans the you know that threat
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:47.320]  there's going to be that common threat of that threat
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:51.160]  involved in whatever stage at the stage event there is
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:55.800]  and again this is the this does fit and comport with as you've stated in the
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:00.840]  past the new world order agenda and i and and and i asked my source this as
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.440]  well i said is obama behind this i mean is is
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:09.800]  is this just obama and you know he he said i i i don't think so
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.560]  i he said i i don't think so because again
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:17.560]  the information that he's got access to
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:21.800]  does suggest some level of higher involvement and again i'm thinking you
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:25.240]  know well how much higher do you go then
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:29.000]  than obama if we're talking specifically about obama and of course
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.120]  there's the new world order factor and uh something i never thought existed
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:38.200]  but it certainly does and and and you've you know you've proven that time and
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:41.720]  time again so um that's what we're looking at
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.320]  the alice and i'm not sure i could be any more specific as to what
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:49.480]  the it is uh what the event is going to be sure well
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:52.920]  mean i can imagine they're all wondering are we still going to be here
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:56.680]  and they say yeah don't worry there's going to be a crisis
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.600]  very soon and we're going ahead with it and that's basically what your source
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:04.440]  said because they're on chris mathews not once but twice
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:07.800]  saying we need a big catalyzing event to reconnect another show
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:11.480]  a year ago we need a mass shooting to reconnect and it's a white house
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:16.600]  official saying this on the show uh we see uh the fund raising memos the
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:20.680]  tides foundation letters saying there's going to be an event and it's
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:25.560]  going to be blamed on uh you know talk radio uh we see them we see
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:30.920]  bill clinton telling us today oh my reelection to oklahoma city it brought
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:34.840]  us together i mean we know that robert shapiro in
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:39.800]  fact guys type this in robert shapiro uh says only terror attack will save
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:43.560]  obama show the financial times of london on screen i don't want to just be
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:46.200]  saying this i know we've shown it hundreds of times but we haven't shown it
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:50.360]  today i want to show people where he says barring this is a quote a new
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:54.680]  oklahoma city or 9 11 the president is not going to get reelected i mean
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:59.000]  why are they saying this publicly i mean it's like they're saying we need it
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.800]  we need it we need it as if we're dumb and don't see this
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:08.200]  yeah you know and this is one thing too i've talked at length with the author
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:11.400]  marinka peshman author of the whistleblower
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:14.920]  um and in fact she's gonna be on our program tonight but i've talked with
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:18.280]  her and and she said people have to understand the clinton's
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:22.760]  number one have never left power i've never left with the washington power
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:26.440]  structure and number two the clinton's are interwoven
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:30.760]  within the obama power structure they're advising obama
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:34.600]  and how well that they use the oklahoma city
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:40.280]  uh tragedy of the bombing there how well that they they uh massage the uh
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:43.880]  put the blame on talk show host radio talk show host the
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.960]  the conservative hatred of conservative not even conservatives but the hatred
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:52.520]  of those who would dare expose their tactics
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:57.240]  uh this is where that the obama administration
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:00.360]  is getting their information from and i've got to tell you
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:04.760]  it's it's it's big i mean the influence is huge
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:08.840]  but when you come down to the logistics of such an operation here
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:15.400]  you know like once again uh we we were striving together to try to figure out
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:19.720]  if if we don't have uh we we don't have we've got pages of their
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:24.520]  of their playbook uh we we've got their operational playbook
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:31.720]  but the plays themselves uh we only have bits and pieces of the plays we know
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:37.400]  for example again you know it's going to be either racial or or economic it's
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:43.800]  in terms of a trigger event uh and i'm trying to be as precise as possible
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:49.080]  but you know not just operating off of the information that we have so i mean
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.360]  it's it's something that again my source is
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:56.440]  look there is something here we've heard the discussions
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:02.360]  he's heard the discussions he's heard the the the the into the meeting where
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:06.520]  they said okay it's a go it's going to go hot
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:11.720]  but beyond that is in terms of when exact i i wish i could say you know it
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:16.280]  would be october 10th or 12th or i wish i could say it would be
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:21.080]  uh you know an attempted whatever i can't i don't have that information nor
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:26.200]  does he uh now on the other hand i will say this
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:30.440]  he is working to mitigate and he pointed this out and i think this is
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:33.800]  important for people really to understand uh and and
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:38.280]  steve quill by the way who's coming on his sources are saying the the very same
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:43.400]  thing your sources are saying my sources are saying uh
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:47.720]  of course my dhs source is saying look we are working there are some people
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:53.480]  here are working to stop this to throw a monkey wrench into this
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:58.360]  into the workings i know that we don't have a whole lot of information
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:04.520]  but we do know the operational guidelines and operational uh tactics of
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:08.920]  dhs that said we know what we can possibly do
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:11.720]  when the time comes we'll know it when we see it
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:15.400]  and we're going to try to act accordingly to mitigate whatever it
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:21.000]  might be so there is hope and as you said if nothing happens
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:27.080]  well people can say why was dhagman he he's a loony to it well
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:31.080]  okay you know we consider over the last eight years
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:35.160]  uh or even the last no i hear we got to go right but but but but if it does
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:38.200]  happen then they'll try to spend it as well but at least you did what you needed
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:42.360]  to the financial times of london article was obama faces
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:46.440]  growing credibility crisis and in it robert Shapiro

[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:47.880]  remember these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:50.760]  that means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise

[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:12.120]  all right here is one example of more than
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:14.600]  nine i was counting them up during the break that i could just find during the
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:20.200]  break nine tv shows letters public statements
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:23.240]  obama faces growing credibility crisis
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:26.520]  robert schipiro quoted financial times of london
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:31.800]  here's the quote this is one of nine times every time i search this i find new
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:35.320]  ones i didn't know about the bottom line here is that americans don't believe in
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:38.440]  president obama's leadership says robert schipiro another former clinton
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:41.240]  official and supporter of obama yeah he's an advisor
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:45.480]  he has defined some way between now and november of demonstrating that he is a
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:49.000]  leader who can command confidence in short of a 9-11 event
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.280]  or in oklahoma city i can't think of how he can do that
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:56.680]  now they go further other advisors saying they're going to blame it on us and we
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:59.640]  played those clips the last hour we're talking right now to the head of the
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:02.280]  northeast intelligence network doug hagman
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:07.080]  he's on with us right now doug you got cut off because these are hard breaks
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:10.040]  when they're uh you know the satellites fired a certain time last time i had
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:12.600]  salente on people made a not salente but there's been a fake
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:15.720]  controversy that he was starting to get into a subject and i go oh gotta go to
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:18.920]  break i mean they're they're hard coded it you know we come in at eight after
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:23.000]  go out at 20 after go out at 30 after come in at 33 go out at
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.960]  50 uh one you know come back at
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:28.680]  show here we are we got about six minutes right now five minutes right now
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:31.720]  we're going to break at the end of the hour that's a conspiracy too
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:35.400]  no no this is the real conspiracy what's happening you were trying to talk about
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:38.600]  how hey if it doesn't happen they can say oh doug hagman's wrong
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:41.880]  you didn't get to finish so i restate what you were trying to say that thought
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:45.880]  well just to expand upon what you said earlier
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:50.040]  and i think this is so important i think really people have to understand this
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:56.120]  is that uh you know the um the more sunshine the more disinfectant we can
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:01.560]  pour on this these plans uh and whatever we can
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:04.680]  shine whatever light we can shine on these plans
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:11.640]  uh helps to mitigate to offset uh and to upset their their their plans
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:15.480]  there's a reason homeland security in a four-year document is spying on
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:19.400]  info wars dot com in this show and they're worried about our reports about
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:24.200]  false flags isn't that interesting that they're really looking at that
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.120]  you know i when i saw that elix i i looked at that and i thought wow you
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:33.560]  know um really what's behind this you know what would be their motivation
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:37.800]  and and again now you were named specifically i believe when we talked
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:42.920]  before you were named as uh as a subject of info wars
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:47.240]  prison planet alex jones your entire enterprise was named
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:52.200]  uh as a uh surveillance subject the subject of surveillance and it said
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:55.880]  basically that i'm kind of a terrorist and i'm an extremist and i'm
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:57:01.080]  i'm dangerous yeah yeah and and i wonder why i mean i was thinking well
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:04.760]  wait a minute you know it is at that uh you know
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:09.720]  exactly why what are we talking about here in and alex i think that that
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:13.080]  you're you're right on the money with this i do believe
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:19.000]  uh that that you're getting very close when you talk about false flags and
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.680]  the government involvement in this because people like me
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:26.840]  you're just a few years ago man i thought it was nuts i didn't believe
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:30.840]  this but now again you're convincing a lot of people it's not just me though
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:34.600]  it's the facts coming out yeah how bad does it hurt the globalist that they're
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:37.560]  getting caught in things like fast and furious
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:41.240]  oh oh look it's a it's a game changer
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:44.920]  but but you also see too with fast and furious
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:50.680]  you've got a u.s attorney that that won't uh pursue the criminal contempt
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:55.000]  and civil contempt charges against holder you know what do you do
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.360]  and see this is another thing that that my source did tell me
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:01.960]  they've got the perfect arrangement right now they've got
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:05.560]  the guy in the justice department eric holder on their side
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:11.240]  uh a red diaper baby right along with obama and jarrett and all these people so
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:16.360]  this is the perfect time to to go through and to implement well yeah that's the
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:19.560]  word from people i know that are really well connected who know romney's bad
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:23.160]  news they say look at least it rearranges the chairs
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:27.320]  obama's got his criminal syndicate in there if he gets back in he's never
[01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:31.560]  leaving because he won't be facing reelection it takes these presidents
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:35.320]  time to get their power structure in we need to reshuffle the
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:41.320]  deck just to get the whole system confused

[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:11.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:19.160]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:27.560]  austin texas alex jones
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:31.560]  all right steve quail's coming up in the next segment finishing up with doug
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:37.640]  hagman for the northeast intelligence network private investigator
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:41.800]  and you can visit his website homeland security us dot com homeland security us
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:45.080]  dot com got about five minutes left here doug
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:48.600]  we were just getting into the fact that yeah fast and furious is a game changer
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:51.800]  the documents came out they did it to blame the second amendment that's even
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:55.560]  on cbs news so it is a game changer but
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:59.560]  now nothing can even be done they're just sitting there
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:03.160]  uh that's why they'll probably even have election fraud not that i think romney's
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.520]  good but i don't think i mean he's more of a globalist
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:09.960]  with white gloves on with obama you're dealing with like
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:15.720]  absolute chicago mafia type stuff where they are nasty nasty nasty
[02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:18.920]  and again i'm not saying stuff won't get even more hellish with romney but
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:21.880]  probably will but i don't i don't see obama going
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:23.640]  anywhere i mean is that what your source is
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:28.280]  getting at is they're going to pull some chicane or me exactly and that's boy
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:31.320]  that is so key alex i'm glad you mentioned that because
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:35.240]  uh but my source said there are too many people
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:39.320]  um and i'm i'm looking at my notes here almost trying to quote him
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:43.000]  there are too many people who want a seat
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.240]  and are guaranteed a seat at the obama table
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:50.680]  that if he loses they would lose that seat
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:54.120]  uh that they obviously want to work
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:58.040]  over time to ensure that obama does not
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:01.560]  it remains in the white house i should say
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:04.840]  that's uh that's the key that's the objective here
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:10.360]  we do know uh of course that you've got uh the different side of the coin that
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:15.080]  being mit romney uh ultimately answering to the same
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:19.000]  higher powers but with obama you've got
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  looking at this way you've got a straight interstate highway going right to
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.240]  the objective with romney uh you might have a little
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:32.360]  detour and kind of a uh a more scenic route to the same
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:37.080]  more scenic route to hell exactly you know and i
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:41.000]  yeah but but that's you know with obama you've got the
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.640]  the holder justice department that's not gonna change if obama stays
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:49.240]  and you've and and you've got all of these people
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:54.520]  uh with with the uh again the the uh anti-second amendment people
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:58.440]  and and and as you mentioned before and people have to understand
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:01.880]  the amount of ammunition just to put this in perspective
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:05.640]  could fill 63 olympic-sized swimming pools
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:09.400]  this is just under the obama administration
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:15.800]  63 sized olympic swimming pools five on average five this is more than
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:21.160]  exactly five bullets per person right so something is up i mean obviously
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:23.880]  something is up his now the argument on the other
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:28.600]  sides well they've always ordered ammunition no they haven't uh
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:32.520]  this shot up after 2004 they've never even ordered i looked it up they've
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:37.240]  never ordered 10 of this in a year exactly so you know and again
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:41.480]  you know steve quill his sources exactly the same information
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.800]  or relatively the same information uh different sources but the same we've
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:48.360]  had police call up that i later talked to but i can
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:52.280]  firmware officers breaking down crying on air
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:55.880]  because they've been told martial law in september now again that doesn't mean
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:59.240]  it's gonna happen but they're talking about calling in the military calling
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:03.000]  in airstrikes on citizens i mean what are the
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.600]  man i'm freaked out i mean i i i hope there's some way to turn this around
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:09.160]  in closing did your source think this can be turned around
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:12.440]  obviously kind of in a way he came to you so he wants it to get out there
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:16.440]  yeah and he said the only way in his mind the only way that this could be
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:21.800]  turned around is through extensive exposure on the other hand there are
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:24.680]  some patriots in within the federal government
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:28.360]  and it varies in the rank and file you know obviously the rank and file but
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:33.720]  various uh mid-level uh departments who are working who know what's going on
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:39.400]  and they're attempting to change things uh the oath keepers so to speak so
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:43.800]  you know there is a possibility well dug we're gonna get um
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:47.000]  steve quill up but but but i know he's got some announcements to make but i want
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.960]  to hold you there because i want to ask steve if he's got any questions or

[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:41.800]  it's the military being told uh you're under nato and un command now and
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:46.040]  congress being told sit down shut up by the joint chiefs and the chairman
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:51.480]  and obama and open letters uh it's the announcements on cnbc that we've been
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:54.920]  taken over by foreign banks and we're slaves to a global government
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:57.800]  those are quotes you've heard me play it probably 50 times
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:10:01.400]  in the last few months hundreds of publications announcing
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:05.480]  you know we're under a world government it's authoritarian for your own good
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:08.120]  that's the financial times of london right there with the bilderberg group
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:12.920]  member saying that there's a cyber news service cns news russian americans
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:17.720]  take part in joint air force counter terror drill
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:21.960]  see there you go i mean it's all getting twilight zone
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:25.480]  right now it's all getting twilight zone
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:30.200]  because they want to just suspend disbelief get everybody's normalcy bias
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:33.400]  going where we'll put up with anything like the tsa
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:36.360]  fishing around on our wives and children's underwear
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:39.640]  i mean it is it is amazing what we'll put up with
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:44.760]  now we have obama people on hardball uh on other shows saying we need new
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:48.200]  shootings we need new bombings uh this will help get obama reelected i played
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:53.560]  those clips in the first hour we have uh all these quotes about a new a new
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:56.920]  terror attack to be blamed on our enemies will save us they don't say
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:00.840]  they're gonna do it but they leave one degree of saying they're going to do it
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:04.040]  they're like gee a terror attack with your help and don't worry one's coming
[02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:09.000]  show now we've got mr hagman's source that fits in with my police sources
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.120]  and my homeland security sources are too scared to talk to me now they say
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:15.640]  everything's surveilled i mean i've got to go meet somebody in a field if i want
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:18.840]  to and that's too dangerous uh because somebody could be posing as some of my
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:22.920]  sources i've got them in state police fbi uh justice
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:27.640]  department federal marshals um you know in the in the old days it was
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:31.160]  still fun and games until they get death threats when they talk to me i mean
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:35.800]  stuff's being listened to folks okay uh i mean that's come out they got the nsa
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:40.440]  not spying on foreign terrorists on people in government and somehow you've
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:43.160]  got to in fact i should ask hagman that because he's about to leave us in a
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:46.440]  moment but i wanted to bring steve quail if he had any questions
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:50.280]  uh you know for doug to have the two kind of dovetail together here at the end
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:53.960]  of our talk with doug hagman of the northeast intelligence network
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:58.200]  that this is all coming to a head and we would be crazy to not be
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:01.400]  concerned about a false flag when this is when
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:05.720]  the season of that is upon us so steve quail of steve quail
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:09.960]  dot com joins us because uh and i remember him two years ago saying
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:13.240]  they're going to weaponize drones and use our gps coordinates
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:16.920]  to use them against us comedy central played the club of him on the show
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:20.520]  and said we were insane now it's mainstream news that they're using
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:24.680]  autonomous drones and predators and reapers and what's that other one global
[02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:29.880]  hawk armed flying around in the future uh i mean it i wish
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:34.600]  steve quail was wrong but more and more i've got to say wow
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:38.440]  even the stuff that i because he's always been a great mind incredible talker
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:41.240]  you know great guy to listen to but you're still kind of like oh come on
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:45.160]  steve and then now it's like is the other stuff he's saying true i mean i know
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:49.160]  he believes it but i'm like my gosh i know he has these sources but are they
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:53.640]  feeding him this info i hope so i hope this isn't true steve quail
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:57.160]  i don't know how much of the last hour you heard but what's your take on it all
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:00.680]  well right now alex we are absolutely under full-scale
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:05.000]  occupation by foreign troops under the guise of united nations nato
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  it is the new world army what you've warned about what you've posted videos
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.480]  about what doug writes about it's all in play now and you know it's amazing
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:18.040]  because the level of denial and normalcy bias is so uh
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:21.800]  accelerating in other words i would have thought that all of our combined
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:25.560]  efforts and all of our would would wake more people up now granted some people
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:30.040]  are waking up but all you have to do is realize that the mainstream media is
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:35.480]  the inoculation mechanism to totally destroy your brain and
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:38.280]  and keep the people from coming to the knowledge of the truth and here's what
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:41.400]  the truth is we are under occupation by the foreign
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:43.720]  governments you just talked about the air force
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:48.120]  the russians are here they the three statements that they've made publicly
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:51.960]  now they're in norad one of our most top secret command centers
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:56.360]  they're absolutely supposedly going after the cia headquarters in denver
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:02.680]  as an exercise and the nsa in uh utah the the point is if this wasn't just out
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:07.000]  of the uh america series i don't know what is
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.720]  and for the record ladies and gentlemen all of the critics and shills out there
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:14.600]  are trying to keep the biggest secret from you in the world
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:18.360]  we are under communist global luciferian
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:21.800]  uh occupation soon to go into full-scale warfare
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:24.920]  and all that we've warned about all that we've said is going to happen the
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:28.440]  militarization of the police obviously alex's appearance at the builder
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:31.960]  burgers uh are you showing you in living color
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:35.720]  that these entities i'm going to use that word alex entities exist
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:40.360]  the point is it's rape pillage and plunder the united states is going under
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:43.480]  now i i'm not a fatalist i'm a realist
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:47.560]  but you know what it's like alex you you you almost have to suspend belief
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:51.080]  in order to emotionally cope with some of the stuff but when it all comes
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:54.840]  rushing to the foreground before your eyes you can't deny it any longer
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.320]  dug sources are not my sources my sources are not alex jones's sources
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:02.760]  did you just went on a litany about people are frightened i can tell you
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:07.000]  point blank that when generals who are four stars say that
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.080]  even they've got to watch what they say and they've got to be careful
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:14.840]  everybody is at war with each other and so to the men and women
[02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:19.800]  that dug and i addressed uh uh last night on his show that are in uniform
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:23.720]  you must stand up for what's right you took an oath to defend the constitution
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:27.640]  against all enemies foreign and domestic right now alex we've got
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:32.360]  so many fifth column terrorists in this country and why wait terrorist let me
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:37.160]  define terrorist terrorist is nothing more than a professional
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:41.880]  group of assassins and general mayhem uh
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:44.920]  induces that are under under someone's control
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:48.840]  someone's command and they're being paid the bottom line is it's insanity to
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:53.320]  close uh the northern border with canada if you're an american citizen
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:57.480]  see how you're treated when you go into canada and let the southern borders
[02:15:57.480 --> 02:16:00.680]  wide open the head of the border patrol before i quit a number of years ago
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:04.840]  called me says if i can't take it they're late they're putting my men out to
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:08.760]  slaughter and you alex have had border patrol guys on we talked about all this
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:12.040]  stuff listen uh a dug source and my source
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:15.800]  corroborated now turn it over to dug uh how many
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:20.040]  uh if you will other than mexicans this is not an anti latino
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:24.440]  my best friend the world was a latino and in bless her heart mary war as
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:28.040]  though the point is is that this is an anti terrorist rant
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:33.240]  of the fifth column of full-scale warriors professional warriors coming
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:37.800]  into the southern border and trust me they speak other languages than spanish
[02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:42.120]  so dug and i both got the same numbers of how many were coming through and we
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:47.400]  both were in disbelief uh wasn't a dug about what 50 000 a month
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:51.560]  between 40 and 50 steve uh thousand a month and
[02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:57.480]  that's just one specific narrow area that that that we know of there could be
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:01.880]  others but i i mean that alone is staggering
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:07.640]  to me so but but you're 100 correct i you know and
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:13.720]  what normal person what normal uh uh security apparatus
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:18.520]  for the united states would allow this to happen if there was not what is your
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:23.960]  what is your source say the 1.4 billion rounds of ammo or four
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:28.440]  are you talking to me alex or uh but dog and steve quill just just briefly as
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:31.960]  dog's leaving us let me answer that real quick my
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:36.280]  source has told that that's for the private army that is going to be
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:40.840]  resurrected out of the mayhem that obama's already gone on record on you've
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:44.520]  done shows on it alex you post on your website the new york times
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:48.040]  the boy scout's being trained with h and k and p fives
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:51.240]  and i actually calculated how many weapons how many rounds how many
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:54.680]  magazines and it's pretty interesting because again we're talking
[02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:58.520]  about ladies and gentlemen the federalization or let's call it even a
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:03.160]  better word the luciferic uh uh control of all
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:07.560]  law enforcement global dominance perpetual war for perpetual peace
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:11.160]  and this is the exact setting the bible sets up in the book of revelation
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:15.160]  for the reign and rule of antichrist we are going in alex and are
[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:19.000]  already seeing right now the strategic placement those
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.080]  billions of rounds and i've been in the firearms business for 30 years so i know
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:26.360]  a little bit about the gun business know a lot of people all over uh the
[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:31.240]  country and world as a matter of fact and uh the the the source that i got it
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:35.800]  from basically stated this is for the civilian private
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:39.480]  military that will be raised up under obama's second term
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:45.320]  in order to basically squash quash and crush all rebellions and that's one
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:50.040]  point uh on the media is always 450 million 750 million 250 million
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:54.600]  since last november it's 1.4 billion and that that's a month old they're buying
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:58.440]  millions more now they're classifying it it's blacked out
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:01.960]  and we reported on that a few weeks ago became a national story on the new ammo
[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:06.200]  but it's giant black armored vehicles in fact i've got photos of them hundreds
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:10.280]  of them armored pill boxes digging in i mean this you can look at the
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:13.640]  architecture it can be sacred but the public intelligence is
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:17.320]  how they're set up business being set up for a war
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:20.520]  against county and city government not just against the people
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:23.880]  when you look at the configuration they're preparing to take over state
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:29.640]  houses the architecture of this warfare system is pointed at the states
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:32.920]  absolutely and every single uh state
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:35.880]  capital building is already marked it's already
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:40.440]  basically the teams that are going to take those over are already located
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:43.880]  literally if you will the radio the tv the pentagon admits that
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:48.280]  the reeducation camps that documents public folks the army admitted the
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:51.400]  document we got was real and said we weren't supposed to have it that it was
[02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:55.160]  restricted reeducation camps how to process
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:59.000]  sheet with your social security in america with your number

[02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:30.440]  out because it's designed you know not only is the love of money the root of
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:34.360]  all evil the control of money is the control of all evil by choking up
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:37.880]  uh everyone's bank accounts you know alex we talked about a little bit
[02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:40.760]  yesterday on your tv show the dredge report
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:44.360]  carrying the story about the cyber attacks on banks the true
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:48.440]  amount of money that have uh has disappeared from customer's account
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:52.600]  and specific banks over 200 banks the real truth is never
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:57.000]  given in its totality unless you talk to the people that know for instance
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:01.880]  who designed the program that watches banks when they come under cyber attack
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:05.320]  so here's how it's going to go down and this is what i've been told and this is

[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:15.960]  levees we're going to continue to track that uh going back number
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:19.480]  steve quail 15 years ago about weather weapons now that's admitted
[02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:23.720]  look steve here's the deal i know you're a smart guy you have a lot of sources
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:27.320]  because you've been around forever i'm not denying that you believe this you
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:30.680]  talked about russian troops secretly training now that's admitted
[02:35:30.680 --> 02:35:35.160]  bizarre we're in the land of bizarre uh you know the government shipping guns
[02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:37.960]  into mexico to destabilize things and blame the second
[02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:42.520]  amendment a false flag but we see soros and others trying to overthrow
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:47.000]  butan we see that destabilization campaign uh we
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.520]  i know the globalists are are running the chinese government but the russians
[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:54.280]  for my evidence there's some type of split i know that they
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:57.160]  fight with each other and i know the globalists like to balance countries
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:00.600]  against each other but i know the us troops are not being led into these
[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:05.320]  secret russian bases they're norad equivalent so what is going on i mean
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:08.360]  you're you're you're now saying you think
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:12.920]  that i mean i know they say in le09 that they would use foreign troops in america
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:15.800]  i know they say they're doing anti-terror drills with the russians
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:19.320]  i mean how would they trigger this how would they get away with it i mean i
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:24.040]  could see our military under foreign command or mercenaries mixed in with
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:27.400]  foreigners but uh and we've seen the drills for that but
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:31.000]  how would they get away with russian troops i mean that's what
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:35.560]  you're saying your source because i mean i mean that would unify americans
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:38.600]  russian troops well unfortunately it won't
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:43.400]  because the bottom line is is that even our military most of the good guys have
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:47.240]  either been outed or they meaning outed or assassinated
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:50.040]  here's the thing alex and this is something that most people don't
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:55.000]  understand even though there seems to be a consensus
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:59.080]  amongst the western european us and some
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:03.720]  of the asian middle eastern countries russia and china
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:07.640]  a number of years ago got together and signed a secret accord and for the
[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:11.560]  record uh one year before that meeting took place a guy
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:17.240]  by the name of dmitry dudeman you probably read of his prophecy du du man
[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:20.680]  saw the meeting and they basically had and this isn't word for word but
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:23.880]  overview this will answer your question specifically
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:27.160]  they were aware and they were going to play along
[02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:31.400]  with the americans on their new world order until the chance came
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:34.920]  where they could take us out take us down and the united states has already
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:38.920]  been divided up between the russians and the chinese
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:43.320]  henry groover uh a a allen there i posted these on my website dreams and
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:47.000]  visions i mean we're talking visions of russians and chinese invading
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:52.440]  the united states from 60 years ago and so now the thing is and and you know
[02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:56.520]  stanislav lunaf victor suvarov i you know all the different
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:00.600]  defectors written books the number one thing they said they would be able to
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:03.240]  succeed because their friends in the government
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:06.920]  would allow them to preposition their men and materiels
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:10.520]  ahead of the takeover now let me make this clear to everybody in the military
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:14.280]  even those who are side by side some friends of mine in a southern state i
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:18.680]  won't give the state away vietnam vets god bless every veteran out there vietnam
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:23.080]  every war vet out there i want to thank you guys one of them spoke russian and
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:27.800]  they saw a joint uh tactical exercise taking place
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:31.480]  and fortunately for their skills learned the jungle they were able
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:34.760]  to track the russians when the americans
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:38.600]  counterparts which i think we're out of fort bragg left they overheard the
[02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:42.120]  american forgive me the russians in russian stating
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:45.960]  these americans once would they have once we have
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:49.880]  put down their enemies we put them down and they were laughing
[02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:53.560]  giving each other high fives and shaking their heads saying that the very people
[02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:56.920]  they're training with they're going to turn their weapons on now alex that's
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:00.440]  from eyewitnesses who speak russian having heard it well
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:03.400]  larry graphwald who was in the top weathermen
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:07.240]  meetings with the big union chiefs they said we're going to bring in chinese
[02:39:07.240 --> 02:39:11.880]  and russians once we've taken over and it all sounds so crazy but then
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:16.360]  they're drilling in anti-terror with the russians and so it's basically the
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:21.640]  foreign bankers may do a double take and a triple cross you're saying
[02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:24.760]  and then do this but there's a problem as admiral yama moto said
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:28.120]  there would be a rifle but behind every blade of grass
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:32.200]  no one i know would put up with foreign troops putting up with them alex we're
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:35.400]  putting up with them that the point is that let me share this with you if you
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:39.240]  go back and do a little history on spetsnaz when i first started writing my
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:43.480]  book real quick the 62nd version uh breathe no evil
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:46.680]  and uh blueprint for survival i was really
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:50.200]  into the soviet defense policies obviously
[02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:55.800]  i was before uh oh good night uh alexander lebed was murdered he was
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:58.920]  taken down he's the one that came and testified to the welden committee
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:02.040]  i was in a week away from interviewing him okay
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:06.280]  general lebed was uh basically the national security advisor for boris
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:10.200]  yeltsin to make a long story short the night he got
[02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:14.120]  killed i said on george nori coast to coast i said it was either george or
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:17.240]  art that he was murdered well his brother came out a week later but
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:21.160]  understanding russian defense policy and civil war
[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:26.360]  was my forte in my take i was friends with someone whose business partner
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:29.960]  was a the sister of one of the highest ranking members
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:33.160]  of the kgb as a matter of fact the man that run it
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:37.320]  ran it before he died so uh the point i'm trying to make in this is they're
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:41.320]  already here what can americans do right now we've seen the prepositioning
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:46.440]  and the strategic placement of military arms and armament
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:49.880]  we've seen a tens we're seeing helicopter gunships in downtown
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:54.280]  and see alex you know you can put up the videos on info wars dot com
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:57.480]  and i can put them up and link to your stuff but people don't get it
[02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:02.520]  why are they practicing urban warfare in the cities of america
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:05.720]  and and and the bottom line is it's you it's me
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:10.680]  it's the americans that are in their targets and at the point is is that
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:13.480]  when graith wall said that years ago on the weather underground
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:17.000]  now the number of people they're talking about taking out on the red list
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:22.600]  is 50 to 75 million people and in those days alex is one thing to say well
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:26.360]  there's you know 300 million americans with or 300 million guns in america
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:28.760]  blah blah blah but the drones and the total
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:32.760]  information awareness and the constant surveillance and the license plate
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:37.320]  readers and all that stuff by the way here's the new purchases just in the
[02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:41.080]  last few days on top of the 1.4 billion the
[02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:46.680]  us forest service is asking for another 85 000 rounds
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:54.440]  a 40 caliber 150 000 rounds of 223 10 000 cartridges of 12 gauge
[02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:58.920]  uh 10 000 of other types of 12 gauge 9 millimeter
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:04.920]  uh 45 38 and again there's so many thousands of pages of these
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:08.680]  i can't even read all the stuff they're getting i mean that's just reading one
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:12.280]  of them it's just pouring out the weapon systems to be
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:16.120]  used against us no one can deny that well right and here's
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:19.160]  something coming in while we're on the air someone's listening to us
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:23.000]  he says he's talked to the government contractor for 30 years this is just in
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.920]  right now and they are ordering much more than what is publicly
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:30.760]  on the fed biz ops website everything has been told to be kept
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:34.760]  under wraps now like the three quarters of a ton of c4
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:38.920]  gee alex you remember when oklahoma blew up you and i were screaming our lungs
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:41.480]  out uh not together but independently on our different
[02:42:41.480 --> 02:42:44.920]  shows and then you know together we got together in a couple shows
[02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:49.720]  and and i let me nine nine eleven two so three quarters of a ton of c4
[02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:53.240]  and you're talking about a false flag tell me stop you guys type in i forgot to
[02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:59.720]  cover that yesterday the tsa just ordered massive amounts of c4
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:03.320]  it is unbelievable we're going to be covering that tonight guys type in tsa
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:07.400]  order c4 and they claim it's for training you don't need
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:10.680]  you need a thimble amount to train dogs you don't need
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:17.240]  giant you know containers of it alex here's what i want people to understand
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:20.680]  you have to have the mentality now you are under
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:26.600]  an occupation by foreign troops and the the enemy is you the enemy is me
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:30.040]  look i don't get a predator over me at a hundred feet because i you know
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:34.280]  they want to show me their newest technology that's telling me a message
[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:37.640]  when great i got to tell you something this is really critical if i could say
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:42.040]  nothing more this should tell everyone i had a lieutenant colonel in my office
[02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:46.600]  two years ago in montana from north com he was in the psychological operations
[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:50.760]  he was a christian alex and he came with tears in his eyes and he said steve
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:54.440]  he said i want to share something with you i'm scared for where we're
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:43:58.280]  heading he said when you and he mentioned you alex and he said the guys that
[02:43:58.280 --> 02:44:02.120]  have have warned him warned we assign cyber warriors
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:06.520]  to go out and undermine to to place the that they do everything in their power
[02:44:06.520 --> 02:44:08.920]  but then he said something that startled me alex
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:12.120]  he said steve i've seen the plans for the us air force
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:18.360]  to bomb and here's his words carpet bomb uh five states specifically kentucky
[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:22.040]  texas tennessee georgia and alabama i said why
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:25.240]  those states he said those are the states that they feel they'll have the most
[02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:28.920]  trouble with and then gray evenson within i think two days
[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:32.920]  and this was separate and apart from me he did not know that a very short period
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:37.160]  time he gets a call from one of his general friends and they call it yard
[02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:41.640]  farming okay now that's innocuous yard farming is basically
[02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:46.040]  when they send a hellfire missile through my front door and the lord rebuke them
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:49.720]  and may all their attempts fail and may the entire command and communication
[02:44:49.720 --> 02:44:53.800]  system for every drone in america that will be used against american people
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:57.480]  fail and i i just i in the name of the living god
[02:44:57.480 --> 02:45:01.640]  made all their communications fail with those things but the bottom line alex
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:05.080]  is is that yard farming now that sounds like well gee oh that sounds
[02:45:05.080 --> 02:45:10.520]  innocuous so again how is it that the very military
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:15.080]  now has and now it becomes problematic because you're you just threw up on
[02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:18.600]  on your screen or told your guys who are up on the screen the general of the
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:22.440]  russian uh air force or whatever what is his name gordy f skier or something
[02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:25.960]  like that he's in north com's headquarters uh they
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:29.560]  show a picture of him flying around in private jet and and ladies and gentlemen
[02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:36.120]  this is insane we spend trillions of dollars to quote arm for the
[02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:39.240]  eventuality of armageddon either against retcher china whoever
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:43.480]  and now all of our enemies are here and who would have ever believed that they
[02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:46.600]  would publicly admit they run al-qaeda and
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:51.320]  give them weapons and 10 000 missiles in libya and now syria i mean it is
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:56.360]  reaching fruit loop level it is and and ladies and gentlemen i want to
[02:45:56.360 --> 02:46:00.520]  again alex there's one thing on my uh website that i want everybody to go and
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:04.120]  take a look at it's critical it's a prophetic word
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:07.560]  from a guy named marcus that greg evinson put up and it's on my
[02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:10.520]  uh q alerts and i think it'll blow people's mind it's a blueprint for what's
[02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:17.080]  going to happen next four weeks now we've been close to crises before
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:20.280]  and i agree there's a lot of stuff lined up a lot of sources police are being
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:24.440]  told big stuff's going to happen but you know there's been evidence of
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:26.840]  things going to happen in the past that didn't happen
[02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:30.840]  and i believe talking about this does help reduce
[02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:34.600]  the fact that it you know could take place i mean i think a false flag
[02:46:34.600 --> 02:46:39.720]  a financial collapse that is probable unless we get the word out
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:45.720]  but i mean my goodness i mean how would it work a false flag goes off
[02:46:45.720 --> 02:46:49.240]  they say domestic groups did it oh don't worry the foreign troops are going to
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:52.520]  help them and i know that's in all the declassified admissions now
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:56.520]  since in le09 they've admitted it i've talked to army officers on air where
[02:46:56.520 --> 02:46:59.320]  they're trained to work with foreign troops i've been to urban warfare drills
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:03.080]  where they train with troops from six nations to take on the west coast and
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:06.680]  confiscate guns and put us in camps it's in my film police state 2000 free
[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:10.600]  online so yes i mean i know it but still i just
[02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:14.440]  don't like people are so mind-controlled though
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:17.800]  they might tell you know the general public that if you're
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:21.080]  not for the foreign occupation you're a terrorist your neighbors might rat you
[02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:23.400]  out of course right neighbors are ratting out
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:27.160]  each other right now look at jason the first guy that was arrested because
[02:47:27.160 --> 02:47:31.320]  somebody heard him on talk radio jason was a talk show host that you i think
[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:34.360]  you carried this story i know we've had him on the show you have a popular show
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:38.840]  he came and got arrested uh we have the uh rob fella brandon rob
[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:41.880]  yeah and then the other guy there's another guy named don m he's the one i
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:45.400]  posted that i think you linked to the bottom line is here's here's what i
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:48.120]  want to share with you alex jones okay
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:51.720]  you're you're you're and and this is this is a good word
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:55.320]  you are so on the tip of the spear but remember this
[02:47:55.320 --> 02:47:59.960]  like an icebreaker it's the bow of the ship that has to break the ice so the
[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:04.280]  others can follow but again the hardest thing and alex i got to
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:06.840]  admit this is the hardest thing for me too so i'm just saying
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:10.200]  someone who who who does what you do this is the hardest thing for me
[02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:14.840]  to understand that the very military that have taken the oath to defend our
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:17.240]  nation against all enemies foreign domestic
[02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:20.760]  are now the ones that are left are now in collusion
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:24.120]  with the invading armies that are here and by the way i said for
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:27.720]  four weeks the the prophecy that's on my website amazing prophetic word of the
[02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:30.840]  lord from brother marcus the bottom line is this guy's got
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:33.720]  something that's real it's not the typical flaky stuff and there's so much
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:38.440]  stuff on the internet but what's amazing to me is it lays out the next
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:41.880]  three months i said four weeks three months it also deals with the next four
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:44.360]  weeks and i would encourage everybody to go to
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:48.920]  my thank god is moving everybody who has discernment that that that we're at a
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:52.520]  key point here and that we're all in great danger because the financial
[02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:56.680]  situation the iran situation the funding of al-qaeda
[02:48:56.680 --> 02:49:00.360]  the ten thousand uh libyan missiles they got
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:05.080]  uh and and then the and the government arming against us and demonizing us
[02:49:05.080 --> 02:49:09.480]  i just find it hard to believe that they're gonna actually pull the trigger
[02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:12.760]  um well i i know you did but again can i be blunt
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:15.720]  there was a lot of stuff for instance genetic armageddon you brought it up and
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:18.840]  i know we're coming out on that when i wrote genetic armageddon about the
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:22.040]  transhumanists and the desire for them to totally destroy the image and
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:25.960]  likeness of living god as we were created and i started talking about
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:30.280]  obviously super soldiers everybody's you know the boards were filled ha ha
[02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:34.280]  what a joke what a crazy guy you know the bottom line is now it's all admitted
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:37.400]  it's it's all that it's all it's all admitted so what i'm trying to tell you
[02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:41.560]  is this is that it when when greg and i did the show last night with
[02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:44.760]  doug hagman is i'm doing the show with you and you had on doug the hour before
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:51.480]  i came on the bottom line is that tension and the panic in law enforcement
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:55.240]  in the intelligence community and guys going out into fields not me
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:58.920]  i don't meet anybody anyplace anytime that's just my own
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:03.320]  security protocol uh i violated it once and almost cost me my life
[02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:08.760]  the bottom line is is that given the fact of everything the preponderance of
[02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:12.920]  evidence alex it's not only the scales that have to come off a man's eyes
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:16.280]  it's the scales that have to come off our heart these are the issues we're
[02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:20.760]  trying to resolve a probably the most confrontational
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:24.360]  dangerous period in history with the emotional base
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:28.120]  that we have that quite candidly isn't prepared for the shock
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:31.880]  this is going to be shock and awe and and i told everybody you heard me say it on
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:35.640]  your show years ago everything that's going on the middle east
[02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:39.240]  designed to train they're going to use those tactics against us well that's
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:43.320]  all admitted i i just don't see them phase one in a collapse
[02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:46.600]  bringing in the foreign troops from what i've studied they would bring in the
[02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:51.240]  collapse then stage false flags blaming on domestic groups let the police and
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:55.080]  military be chewed up in a fight with the people then they bring in the i-4
[02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:59.160]  NATO forces and that's on record no matter how crazy it sounds that is the
[02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:02.840]  plan we'll be back a little over a year ago
[02:51:02.840 --> 02:51:07.160]  i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty good size meal
[02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:10.920]  that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:14.600]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and
[02:51:14.600 --> 02:51:18.760]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[02:51:18.760 --> 02:51:23.480]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[02:51:23.480 --> 02:51:28.120]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy i then searched out the best

[02:53:10.680 --> 02:53:13.000]  the power grid and just how vulnerable it is
[02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:17.000]  that's in the mainstream news every day millions of people have lost their power
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.640]  in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and
[02:53:19.640 --> 02:53:22.920]  killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity
[02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:26.600]  i've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts

[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:52.680]  again let listen folks we can disagree about timelines it's mainstream news
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:56.200]  they train with troops from 15 nations to take on domestic
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:54:59.000]  terrorists who they share our veterans and gun owners that's
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:03.800]  high treason it is public that they're arming with all
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:07.000]  these weapons against us it's public they're setting up face scanning
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:10.280]  so i'm here in steve quail and he's talking about all this evidence and
[02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:12.760]  stuff he's talking about it forever and then i'm hoping he's wrong i think we
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:16.040]  can disagree on timelines but definitely stuff's getting weird
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:20.760]  and i hope uh that he's wrong i hope that none of this unfolds
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:23.320]  but i know he wouldn't be out here saying all this if he and his heart
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:26.520]  didn't think things were being green lighted for this i just know
[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:31.480]  i talked to a billionaire lady off record owns a defense contractor company
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:34.360]  uh four years ago i told you the story and she said
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:37.960]  i'm moving to the cook islands and i said why because it collapsed she said
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:42.600]  the united states won't be here and i just happened to run into her in a
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:46.120]  lawyer's office i was there following some stuff at the big law firm in town
[02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:49.800]  till like 50 lawyers and she she was a listener and i went and checked who she
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:53.000]  was after it was like wow that's really is who they she said
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:58.440]  uh it was like why'd you tell me that uh i wish i would have asked more though
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:02.840]  um where this is crazy this is like before world war one or world war two
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:05.480]  everything's lining up for that so i don't know what's going to happen
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:09.160]  in the details but i uh steve i hope you're wrong
[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:13.000]  uh but you've got you know hagman sources i've got police calling and crying
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:16.280]  later confirm with other high-level police they're told all you know what's
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:20.680]  going to break loose um i mean what are your sources saying how
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:24.040]  will this start if indeed they pull the trigger
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:27.960]  alex they all say it started or you wouldn't have seen it implemented but
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:31.080]  when it really gets bad is on the financial collapse
[02:56:31.080 --> 02:56:35.080]  i gotta spell it out to you imagine everybody in the united states not
[02:56:35.080 --> 02:56:38.200]  being able to access their bank accounts access their credit cards
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:41.960]  access their atm machines imagine the truck stopping
[02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:46.200]  imagine the people who are used to government subsidies being stopped and
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:48.680]  it's not it's going to be across the board this is going to be affecting
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:52.840]  everyone and then imagine that the gangs that and you and i talked about this
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:57.560]  10 years ago the gangs that have been given the guns and oh by the way i was
[02:56:57.560 --> 02:57:01.240]  a crazy when i was talking about all the chinese arms being shipped into the
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:04.360]  gangs on the west coast you said it before it was even in the la
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:08.760]  times and you i know i wish i could think that you were crazy
[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:12.120]  you said that they were the government was arming gangs nationwide and now
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:15.240]  that's admitted right so so the point is is that
[02:57:15.240 --> 02:57:19.640]  here's the thing the the the the interesting issue that everybody's got
[02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:23.320]  to come to grips with and really has to come to grips with
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:26.360]  is look i don't know the timing and i will agree with you on one thing in the
[02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:32.360]  world of special operations when a an operation is made known everybody cuts
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:36.200]  contact with that operation but the bottom line is is that
[02:57:36.200 --> 02:57:40.600]  we have the us complicit and i'm talking about the military establishment
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:43.320]  right now with the implementation of martial law
[02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:46.840]  the roundups the assassinations everything else but what they
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:50.920]  are not getting look i was the source and and i think this is what you've got
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:55.080]  to do and i've got to do if i've been right and if my sources have been
[02:57:55.080 --> 02:57:59.080]  unfailing and the ultimate source has been god calling me to be a watchman
[02:57:59.080 --> 02:58:02.280]  and proclaiming because god says his people are destroyed for lack of
[02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:05.480]  knowledge and i don't care what a person's position is
[02:58:05.480 --> 02:58:09.880]  they can't argue look 15 years ago i was telling people this stuff is happening
[02:58:09.880 --> 02:58:13.640]  now a lot of people are writing books on and everything i don't care about that
[02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:17.560]  but what i'm saying is if it's taken people 15 years to get where i was
[02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:21.560]  15 years ago i'm trying to tell people what comes next but
[02:58:21.560 --> 02:58:25.960]  the total financial collapse coordinated with
[02:58:25.960 --> 02:58:30.360]  an attack on washington dc and several other major cities
[02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:34.040]  the potential for an emp attack okay well i want to hear the chain of events

[02:59:05.800 --> 02:59:09.240]  millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of
[02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:13.800]  dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity
[02:59:13.800 --> 02:59:17.640]  i've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts

[03:00:19.240 --> 03:00:23.560]  of august 2012 and we got foreign troops crawling all over us government
[03:00:23.560 --> 03:00:27.800]  buying millions around ammo giant black tanks armored vehicles
[03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:30.840]  they're on the news saying look out the gun owners and veterans are terrorists
[03:00:30.840 --> 03:00:33.640]  they're the enemy they're gonna attack any minute
[03:00:33.640 --> 03:00:37.080]  uh i mean it's just total bizarreness we've got
[03:00:37.080 --> 03:00:40.840]  judges out in places uh you know in texas and they're gonna fight the new
[03:00:40.840 --> 03:00:43.640]  oral order i mean it's just it's entering
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:48.600]  just crazy land uh and i wish it wasn't all happening
[03:00:48.600 --> 03:00:51.560]  we've got all these different sources saying get ready for all haties to break
[03:00:51.560 --> 03:00:54.200]  loose in september we got about five minutes left
[03:00:54.200 --> 03:00:57.640]  steve layout from your source is how this would unfold
[03:00:57.640 --> 03:01:02.040]  you know cyber attack things go down riots uh and then what we beg for the
[03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:05.960]  troops i mean what happens well they want it they're gonna they want
[03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:09.960]  a two to four week period where everybody turns loose on everybody
[03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:12.920]  that by the way alex concurrent with this the internet goes down
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:16.840]  all communications go dead except the military communications in their high
[03:01:16.840 --> 03:01:19.960]  rack and all their new trunk system and by the way
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:24.840]  they know every single police officer his allegiance his alliance and his stuff
[03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:29.000]  so let's say a police force has a hundred officers and five of them
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:32.360]  are considered they're not team players in other words they won't go along with
[03:01:32.360 --> 03:01:35.400]  the new world order the five will be locked out of the trunk
[03:01:35.400 --> 03:01:39.800]  communication system everything's digital 95 people get the order the five
[03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:43.800]  guys will be set up for the other 95 the blue
[03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:47.240]  list goes into effect that's when the foreign troops
[03:01:47.240 --> 03:01:50.440]  have their pre-assigned targets to assassinate by the way let me tell you
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:54.040]  something when i started talking about gpsing the front
[03:01:54.040 --> 03:01:58.520]  doors for hellfire missiles a former helicopter gunship pilot
[03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:03.000]  called me he said steve he said we have sealed orders and we have all our
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:06.440]  targets assigned to us in the areas that will be dispatched from
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:10.680]  so understand alex well pilots have complained that they've been ordered
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:14.520]  to go around and practice attacking us cities not just for foreign targeting
[03:02:14.520 --> 03:02:18.360]  they're practicing for us cities well our us individuals and i mean
[03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:21.480]  you said the other day i think when we were on your tv show that you had
[03:02:21.480 --> 03:02:25.720]  you know you saw a drone over you and and the point is here's what i'm trying
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:30.040]  to get across to everybody okay if if what's obvious now look what's
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:33.080]  obvious you know everybody's hoping and this
[03:02:33.080 --> 03:02:37.240]  is where i hope is good but misplace hope was maddening
[03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:40.520]  what will make a difference here's what will make a difference
[03:02:40.520 --> 03:02:44.520]  if every man woman and and fighting person
[03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:47.720]  in the military and in the police departments
[03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:51.400]  understands that's why i spend the time i do
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:54.760]  that's why you spent and you're already on a list of your patriot they already
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:58.680]  know so speak out now and pray and let everybody know
[03:02:58.680 --> 03:03:01.640]  that there is a takeover happening because no one can deny the takeovers
[03:03:01.640 --> 03:03:04.760]  here the question is how severe is it well but can i tell you something it's
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:07.800]  terminally severe you alex jones cannot interview
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:10.760]  grace wall from the weather underground days and then see
[03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:14.760]  all of those same people now coming into play the mentors of the current
[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:18.760]  administration and all of the obama's hierarchy you
[03:03:18.760 --> 03:03:22.760]  cannot have a national law listen the man of perdition the bible
[03:03:22.760 --> 03:03:26.280]  talks about his lawlessness and lawlessness is defined as each man
[03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:29.800]  doing that's what's right in his own sight and now you've got people saying
[03:03:29.800 --> 03:03:32.440]  that look the constitutions are relevant the bill of
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:35.560]  rights is irrelevant and it to the degree that our founding
[03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:38.520]  father said it's designed for a moral people and the people lose their
[03:03:38.520 --> 03:03:43.240]  morality that's why the effective communist protocols and
[03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:46.360]  globalist mind speak and mind control by the way
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:49.720]  concurrent with all is going down getting back to your question that's when
[03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:55.160]  they turn on the gwen towers okay the electromagnetic if you will
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:58.520]  numbing and dumbing down the mind control so that's their well they admitted in
[03:03:58.520 --> 03:04:02.920]  the major paper it was the uh Baltimore sun
[03:04:02.920 --> 03:04:07.320]  12 years ago they bragged the cia and darpe had had set up
[03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:10.840]  with the tower systems that can manipulate our minds and calm us
[03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:14.680]  that was in the newspaper absolutely under four hertz you go to sleep
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:18.840]  over six hertz you go agitated and that's where and please everybody
[03:04:18.840 --> 03:04:23.720]  this is not a pitch but you've got to read my zombie series on my website
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:28.520]  this is alex when they articulate when they uh integrate the radio frequency
[03:04:28.520 --> 03:04:31.960]  i when they turn on the power to our uh basically
[03:04:31.960 --> 03:04:35.640]  energize a lot of the stuff that's been put into the chemtrails spring
[03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:38.680]  i mean they're not only talking about zombie protocols
[03:04:38.680 --> 03:04:42.280]  they're talking about generating the zombie apocalypse and by that you're
[03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:45.160]  talking about a bunch of people out of their minds running around crazy
[03:04:45.160 --> 03:04:49.480]  they can do that spraying pcp on people too amazing steve quill we got to talk
