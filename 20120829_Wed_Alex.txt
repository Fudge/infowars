[00:00:04.993 --> 00:00:06.294]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.294 --> 00:00:08.055]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:09.816]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:11.398]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.398 --> 00:00:12.959]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.142]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:21.245]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:46.693]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is already Wednesday, the 29th day of August 2012.
[00:00:46.693 --> 00:01:03.227]  We are going to give you the latest on the hurricane that is now flooding parts of Louisiana, and our reporter, our source, Charles, we've given his last name on air before during Katrina, but he had some political
[00:01:04.148 --> 00:01:05.670]  Repercussions for it.
[00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.192]  So we won't give out his full name today.
[00:01:08.192 --> 00:01:11.915]  Charles, we talked to him a little bit before the show.
[00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:15.258]  Now his cell phone is just going to voicemail.
[00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:18.481]  He was scheduled to be on in about 10 minutes.
[00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:24.066]  He says a levy has broken and Charles has been calling into the show for 14
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.921]  Years, since 1998.
[00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:30.625]  Everything he's ever reported to us has been dead on.
[00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:34.128]  They're reporting that one levy has had water go over the top of it.
[00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:42.297]  And that's not a big issue if it doesn't wash it out, but the main storm isn't even into land yet and this could be bad.
[00:01:42.297 --> 00:01:56.323]  They've spent 14 to 15, they argue the number's billion, rebuilding the levy system and there have been reports that the locals who got control of the money along with the feds, who divided it up, stole large portions of it.
[00:01:56.963 --> 00:01:59.164]  Which is standard operating procedure.
[00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:03.926]  Hurricane Isaac soaks Gulf Coast, tests new Orleans levees.
[00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:08.589]  Is the headline out of Reuters today.
[00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.691]  And Isaac's winds test energy grid upgrades after Katrina.
[00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:16.689]  New tool for hurricane trackers is drones.
[00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:17.930]  We're going to be looking at that.
[00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.196]  In fact, I want to open the phones up for people in Louisiana in the New Orleans area.
[00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:28.801]  If you'd like to join us on air, I'd like to find out specifically from you.
[00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:31.744]  Just quick reports on what you're seeing there in your area.
[00:02:31.744 --> 00:02:33.225]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:53.396]  Now, last night on the Nightly News, I had talk show host, author, Steve Qualon, who has a lot of sources dealing with martial law and things of that nature, and foreign troops training in the U.S., which has now been confirmed.
[00:02:53.396 --> 00:02:59.139]  I remember when he was talking about Russians training, and now it's admitted, just amazing.
[00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:06.822]  In the very area he said they were training, in Colorado, just before, years before it was actually admitted that that indeed had gone on, people said he made that up.
[00:03:06.822 --> 00:03:07.322]  He didn't.
[00:03:08.102 --> 00:03:13.524]  Steve is scheduled to be on with us in the second hour, along with Doug Hagman after that.
[00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:14.945]  But we just talked to Steve.
[00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:17.086]  He's eating to flip times with Hagman.
[00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:18.806]  So we're figuring out what's going on with that.
[00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:22.408]  That is all up in the air today, now.
[00:03:22.408 --> 00:03:23.708]  And why is Hagman coming on?
[00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:27.850]  Hagman is a famous private investigator.
[00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.552]  He does consult with state police, the feds, and others.
[00:03:31.552 --> 00:03:33.232]  And he has broken a lot of news in the past.
[00:03:33.232 --> 00:03:37.094]  So I believe that his federal law enforcement source, I'll just
[00:03:37.694 --> 00:03:38.934]  Leave it at that.
[00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:44.635]  You know, we get Homeland Security documents and MIAC reports and things from our sources as well.
[00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:48.216]  But our sources have said they don't have specifics.
[00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:53.437]  They've just been told all hell will break loose in late October, early November.
[00:03:53.437 --> 00:03:57.878]  You've heard the police call in and break down crying from places like Austin, Texas and St.
[00:03:57.878 --> 00:04:02.299]  Louis, Missouri, saying they've been told total collapse, something huge.
[00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:02.839]  Get ready.
[00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:04.199]  But that doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:13.255]  You know, we had the whistleblower from the Olympics, and it was later confirmed when he said there was basically no security, it was all fake, there were troops.
[00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:17.457]  But they told him something big will happen at the end, and it didn't.
[00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:21.219]  So, I want to be clear, that does not mean that this is all going to happen.
[00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.000]  But things go on high alert, basically.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.725]  But we have seen Oklahoma City, we have seen things like 9-11, and the DHS source told Hagman, it's going hot, Obama false flag coming.
[00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:40.457]  And we're going to be getting into all of that today as well.
[00:04:40.457 --> 00:04:47.784]  That interview is up at InfoWars.com from last night with Steve Quayle and Mr. Hagman, Doug Hagman.
[00:04:47.784 --> 00:04:53.209]  That is all up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.812]  VHS source, it's going hot, Obama false flag coming.
[00:04:56.812 --> 00:04:59.094]  That's in the featured news of InfoWars.com.
[00:05:01.027 --> 00:05:07.352]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:05:07.352 --> 00:05:12.617]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[00:05:12.617 --> 00:05:14.859]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:22.345]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:26.649]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:31.014]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[00:05:31.014 --> 00:05:37.382]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[00:05:37.862 --> 00:05:40.904]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[00:05:40.904 --> 00:05:44.005]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[00:05:44.005 --> 00:05:47.727]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[00:05:47.727 --> 00:05:50.769]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:55.872]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:57.533]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:05:59.824 --> 00:06:06.348]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:06:06.348 --> 00:06:08.950]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.333]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:19.296]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:26.561]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[00:06:26.921 --> 00:06:30.804]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices, too.
[00:06:30.804 --> 00:06:32.585]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:36.608]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:06:36.608 --> 00:06:39.530]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.312]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today.
[00:06:42.312 --> 00:06:46.875]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:47.515]  Don't wait!
[00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:48.376]  Call 800-409-5633.

[00:07:09.948 --> 00:07:14.030]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:05.707]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.707 --> 00:08:07.989]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.470]  Yeah.
[00:08:37.481 --> 00:08:40.003]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:08:40.003 --> 00:08:44.807]  Another worldwide transmission against tyranny in defense of liberty.
[00:08:44.807 --> 00:08:52.473]  I am your host, Alex Jones, waging war on corruption, crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:52.473 --> 00:09:04.062]  We are going to be covering the fact today that Ron Paul did get blocked out of the delegate process so that it could not be revealed that he had a very strong showing.
[00:09:05.396 --> 00:09:22.664]  Ron Paul, of course, has now gone public with the fact, we already knew this, it was clear, that he was offered a speaking slot if it could be pre-approved by the Republican Party, by Mitt Romney's people, and Ron Paul would not do that.
[00:09:22.664 --> 00:09:31.968]  Rand Paul obviously did, so that he could have a speaking slot, and Rand Paul's positioning himself to be able to run for president and probably win down the road.
[00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:37.789]  Certainly better than somebody like Barack Obama.
[00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:45.391]  I would love to have Rand Paul as president compared to somebody like Barack Obama.
[00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:50.393]  But at the same time, there's obviously a video clip up at Infowars.com.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:10:00.589]  That breaks down, hot mic catches Republican, praising censorship of Ron Paul.
[00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:08.599]  And Paul Watson's article says, well obviously it wasn't on purpose because then they re-read the delegates for Ron Paul.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.843]  One time the audio is completely off while they're doing it, getting to Ron Paul.
[00:10:13.843 --> 00:10:18.026]  And then again, right when they say Ron Paul, the second time it fades down.
[00:10:18.026 --> 00:10:25.331]  And then the chairlady who's up there says, say that again, no one could hear it.
[00:10:25.331 --> 00:10:28.773]  And they say it again, and you can finally hear delegates for Ron Paul.
[00:10:28.773 --> 00:10:35.338]  But before that happens, you hear somebody laughing going, good job, whoever's running the
[00:10:37.202 --> 00:10:41.067]  Good job whoever's running the mic cutting that off.
[00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:44.532]  You hear other people going... And this is this attitude.
[00:10:44.532 --> 00:10:48.297]  We saw that in Iowa.
[00:10:48.297 --> 00:10:52.603]  We saw that unfold in Iowa.
[00:10:52.603 --> 00:10:52.983]  Where...
[00:10:54.875 --> 00:11:01.721]  We had the Republicans bragging, even on radio shows, look, the fix is in.
[00:11:01.721 --> 00:11:04.784]  Doesn't matter if Ron Paul wins, he's going to be dealt with.
[00:11:04.784 --> 00:11:06.986]  And sure enough, there was fraud.
[00:11:06.986 --> 00:11:08.147]  And there was fraud in Maine.
[00:11:08.147 --> 00:11:10.649]  And then there was fraud everywhere else.
[00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:15.413]  And so the issue is, A, Ron Paul, in my view, did not complain enough about that.
[00:11:15.413 --> 00:11:17.255]  He didn't want to look like a sore loser.
[00:11:17.255 --> 00:11:18.756]  But I mean, when it's fraud, it's fraud.
[00:11:18.756 --> 00:11:19.657]  You've got to expose it.
[00:11:21.232 --> 00:11:33.755]  And at the same time as well, I think, you know, Ron Paul did kind of go along with Rand and not make a big issue out of the fact that his delegates were being shut down so that Rand would get a speaking slot.
[00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:39.616]  And these speaking slots are not that big a deal nowadays, unless it's the vice president or president's speech.
[00:11:42.037 --> 00:11:48.940]  There's still this love affair with mainstream television or mainstream airtime.
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.901]  I have been on basically everything.
[00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:57.424]  TruTV, Discovery Channel, History Channel, HBO, Trio.
[00:11:57.424 --> 00:12:02.266]  I've been in films and major movie theaters nationwide with major movie stars.
[00:12:02.266 --> 00:12:08.949]  I have been on the cover of magazines, the cover story in magazines, you name it.
[00:12:10.436 --> 00:12:15.978]  And I'm telling you, mainstream television is not what it used to be.
[00:12:15.978 --> 00:12:23.120]  I will say when I went on The View, I got a huge response, because that thing does have like 10-15 million viewers.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.161]  But I've been on Geraldo Rivera, I've been on it all.
[00:12:26.161 --> 00:12:27.981]  I mean, hundreds of things.
[00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:39.065]  To the point of now, I don't even return phone calls most of the time when the BBC calls, or Fox News calls, or CNN calls.
[00:12:39.929 --> 00:12:45.957]  I mean, I don't even return their calls to go on.
[00:12:45.957 --> 00:12:52.725]  In fact, Chris, who's one of the producers, I guess head producer in there, trying to organize everything.
[00:12:52.725 --> 00:12:54.527]  Now he's like, okay, here's the BBC.
[00:12:54.527 --> 00:12:55.729]  Okay, here's this, here's that.
[00:12:55.729 --> 00:12:57.331]  I'm like, nope, not doing it.
[00:12:58.632 --> 00:12:59.373]  Not doing it anymore.
[00:12:59.373 --> 00:13:07.140]  I mean, I'm really getting to the point where, what's the point of having History Channel, Discovery Channel, PBS here?
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.422]  What's the point of having the CBC here?
[00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:10.423]  What is the point?
[00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:13.245]  What is the point?
[00:13:13.245 --> 00:13:18.970]  And I'm not going off into a tangent bragging that, hey, I've been all over the media.
[00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.312]  I've been everywhere, man.
[00:13:20.312 --> 00:13:25.096]  My point is, I don't get the absolute groveling
[00:13:27.466 --> 00:13:30.547]  That people go through to get on television.
[00:13:30.547 --> 00:13:31.288]  Here's an example.
[00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:38.711]  I've had people starry-eyed go, oh, you were on Andrew Napolitano's Fox News show.
[00:13:38.711 --> 00:13:40.332]  Wow!
[00:13:40.332 --> 00:13:43.734]  They mentioned you on Freedom Watch back when that was on.
[00:13:43.734 --> 00:13:45.635]  And Andrew Napolitano's a nice guy.
[00:13:45.635 --> 00:13:46.615]  He's an intelligent guy.
[00:13:46.615 --> 00:13:48.276]  I really like him.
[00:13:48.276 --> 00:13:53.518]  But the show on Fox Business was number two on there, and it had 150,000 viewers.
[00:13:57.677 --> 00:14:00.498]  I mean, that's nothing.
[00:14:00.498 --> 00:14:02.259]  Fox Business doesn't have a lot of viewers.
[00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:04.980]  The biggest Fox TV shows have 3 million viewers.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:10.722]  Bill O'Reilly, by the time Beck left, he was down to 2 million or less.
[00:14:10.722 --> 00:14:14.524]  I am just tired of Emperor's New Clothes.
[00:14:14.524 --> 00:14:16.085]  I mean, I'm really sick of it.
[00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:18.406]  I'm really tired of it.
[00:14:18.406 --> 00:14:23.708]  I remember I was in New York to go on The View and CNN and a bunch of other shows last year.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:30.803]  Barely went, because I had like five shows lined up, and I thought, all right, I'll fly them to New York for The View.
[00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:32.484]  I'll do all these other shows.
[00:14:32.484 --> 00:14:34.065]  The View said, we're not going to fly you first class.
[00:14:34.065 --> 00:14:36.446]  I said, I'm not coming then.
[00:14:36.446 --> 00:14:38.107]  Because I didn't even figure they'd put me on.
[00:14:38.107 --> 00:14:41.148]  I said, OK, well, nice talking to you.
[00:14:41.148 --> 00:14:42.169]  And they called, and they said, fine.
[00:14:42.169 --> 00:14:44.830]  And they called back an hour later, and they go, you're really saying no to The View?
[00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.031]  And I said, yeah, I don't care.
[00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:50.573]  So they go, OK, you get your first class ticket.
[00:14:50.573 --> 00:14:51.433]  You get your nonstop.
[00:14:53.055 --> 00:14:56.877]  I'm not going to be, they will get you the cheapest airplane and land you three times.
[00:14:56.877 --> 00:14:58.458]  You'll waste a whole day.
[00:14:58.458 --> 00:15:01.360]  You might not even get there half the time with their storms.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.822]  You get there and I just don't want to be around it.
[00:15:03.822 --> 00:15:10.766]  All the fake people, all the desperate producers and people running around, you know, groveling to a bunch of nobodies like Barbara Walters.
[00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:13.788]  I mean, I don't care.
[00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:19.892]  And so my whole issue is I don't get jumping through a bunch of Republican hoops to get on the national convention.
[00:15:19.892 --> 00:15:20.492]  Whoop-dee-doo.
[00:15:23.865 --> 00:15:27.726]  I mean, my point is the old system really is a joke.
[00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:31.367]  It really is a legend in its own mind.
[00:15:31.367 --> 00:15:35.008]  Now, I'll stay up all night to go on Coast to Coast AM.
[00:15:35.008 --> 00:15:36.908]  You know why?
[00:15:36.908 --> 00:15:40.789]  Because it's got about 6 million listeners an hour.
[00:15:40.789 --> 00:15:47.471]  6 million listeners an hour, upwards of 16 million listeners a night.
[00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:59.347]  I can go on that show and watch an additional million people visit InfoWars.com on top of the million that already visited every day.
[00:15:59.347 --> 00:16:01.589]  The Drudge Report links to it.
[00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:04.332]  Links to us.
[00:16:04.332 --> 00:16:05.713]  500,000 if it's a little link down at the bottom.
[00:16:05.713 --> 00:16:12.018]  If it's a top link, we've seen 3 million additional visitors off one link at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:16:12.018 --> 00:16:13.940]  That's media.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:14.521]  That's power.
[00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.894]  So, I mean, I'm here to tell you what has power.
[00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:23.520]  Big talk radio shows and things like DrugsReport.com.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.283]  That's it.
[00:16:25.283 --> 00:16:27.566]  And then down the chain, Infowars.com.
[00:16:28.786 --> 00:16:32.168]  And I've got all this news, all this information to cover.
[00:16:32.168 --> 00:16:38.811]  I will be honest, I've been jogging more and starting to do some weightlifting, and I think I pulled a muscle in my back, so I'm in excruciating pain right now.
[00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:41.713]  It hurts to even breathe, but I'm gonna maintain here today.
[00:16:41.713 --> 00:16:45.735]  If I sound a little bit distracted, please don't call and tell me you feel sorry for me.
[00:16:45.735 --> 00:16:54.820]  I'm just telling you so that if I sound a little bit out of it here and there, it's because I've got a muscle that's pulled or sprained in my back.
[00:16:57.355 --> 00:17:04.920]  Might need to lay off swimming two miles in icy water and the big natural spring here in town.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:11.445]  But I don't even know why I went off into that.
[00:17:11.445 --> 00:17:17.269]  I'm just so sick of the marveling, the marveling at things that are a joke.
[00:17:21.479 --> 00:17:29.125]  I mean, it's just, and the way people take themselves so seriously, and the way they're legends in their own minds.
[00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:43.917]  I mean, if you look at media matters run by the White House and George Soros on record, or ThinkProgress run by the same parties, they sit there and arbitrate to everyone and say they're in charge of reality, and say they're nonpartisan and not connected to George Soros when they're publicly financed by him in the White House.
[00:17:44.847 --> 00:17:51.463]  Total deception, total lies, sworn in their own memos to infiltrate free press and destroy it.
[00:17:51.463 --> 00:17:53.408]  White House Transition Chief is the head of it.
[00:17:54.793 --> 00:18:04.399]  I think progress and they sit there and pretend like they control reality and that's where MSNBC gets its talking points.
[00:18:04.399 --> 00:18:10.263]  The biggest shows on MSNBC say they have 800,000 viewers and it came out in Nielsen ratings.
[00:18:10.263 --> 00:18:18.228]  The minute I saw the headline that Nielsen had been caught faking ratings for money, I said when I read this, it's going to be MSNBC.
[00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:25.234]  Oh, and I read the article and MSNBC was one of the culprits with fake ratings.
[00:18:25.234 --> 00:18:28.116]  They don't even have 800,000 viewers at a time.
[00:18:28.116 --> 00:18:32.419]  I mean, these people are a joke.
[00:18:32.419 --> 00:18:36.982]  But they're arrogant legends in their own minds.
[00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:38.924]  Listen, it's over for the ruling elite.
[00:18:38.924 --> 00:18:40.785]  It's over for the Federal Reserve crowd.
[00:18:40.785 --> 00:18:43.327]  It's over for the kleptocracy bankers.
[00:18:43.327 --> 00:18:43.827]  It's over.
[00:18:43.827 --> 00:18:45.649]  They want to sick the giant
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:52.748]  Welfare class that doesn't know how to tie their shoelaces in many cases against those of us that are still producers.
[00:18:52.748 --> 00:19:00.417]  They want to bring in socialism at the grassroots and have their corporate global fascism that's exempt from all their own regulations offshore.
[00:19:01.638 --> 00:19:04.019]  They want to try to get our guns.
[00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:06.439]  They want to try to brainwash our kids in schools.
[00:19:06.439 --> 00:19:08.300]  They want to try to get all this stuff done.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.780]  It's dead on arrival.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.781]  You're seeing the beginning of the end of these people.
[00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:14.141]  They can censor the web.
[00:19:14.141 --> 00:19:16.121]  They can come in and shut people down.
[00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:17.822]  It's over.
[00:19:17.822 --> 00:19:25.024]  Even if there's no one there to rival you because you destroy all the alternative media or infiltrate it and take it down, no one believes you.
[00:19:25.024 --> 00:19:26.124]  No one likes you.
[00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:30.545]  You're a fraud wrapped in a scam with an icing of baloney.
[00:19:32.128 --> 00:19:35.089]  And that's all I have to say.
[00:19:35.089 --> 00:19:42.473]  I don't want anything to do with a sinking, rotting establishment that is on its way out.
[00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:44.774]  The zombie banks, all of it, are just that.
[00:19:44.774 --> 00:19:54.258]  Reanimated dead corpses of a political dead system that is only still crawling because you suck off of the productive people.
[00:19:54.258 --> 00:19:55.898]  We'll get into the hurricane.
[00:19:55.898 --> 00:19:57.199]  A ton of news.
[00:19:57.199 --> 00:19:58.560]  Stay with us.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:58.960]  We'll be back.
[00:20:00.441 --> 00:20:06.591]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:20:06.591 --> 00:20:09.555]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:20:09.555 --> 00:20:14.603]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:20:14.943 --> 00:20:19.904]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:20:19.904 --> 00:20:27.546]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[00:20:27.546 --> 00:20:31.427]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:20:31.427 --> 00:20:33.207]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:20:33.207 --> 00:20:37.228]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:20:37.228 --> 00:20:39.849]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[00:20:40.129 --> 00:20:42.912]  The fact is, you can eat it any time to save money today.
[00:20:42.912 --> 00:20:47.477]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.

[00:24:13.377 --> 00:24:13.657]  I think?
[00:24:33.152 --> 00:24:47.738]  All right, Charles, who's been one of our sources for 14 years in Louisiana, always an impeccable source, is in the hurricane in Plaquemine Parish, Louisiana, and said that the levee has broken there.
[00:24:47.738 --> 00:24:50.318]  And that was about 10 minutes before the show.
[00:24:50.318 --> 00:24:52.159]  He said there's people on top of their houses.
[00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:53.900]  He was there helping them with the fire department.
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.220]  And that he was going to get back with us.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:00.842]  Now the cell phone goes right to voicemail, looking like we've lost cell phone service.
[00:25:00.842 --> 00:25:10.444]  So, if anybody's in Plaquemine and has got a phone and can confirm this, or tell us what you're seeing, they're reporting in some areas the water's gone over levees.
[00:25:10.444 --> 00:25:14.025]  This is as the real bulk of the hurricane goes on shore now.
[00:25:14.025 --> 00:25:17.546]  And pray for folks in Louisiana, because they don't just have the water to worry about.
[00:25:17.546 --> 00:25:18.086]  The feds,
[00:25:18.866 --> 00:25:23.167]  Love any excuse to come and raid homes and rob and loot and steal guns.
[00:25:23.167 --> 00:25:32.070]  The police in the area obviously will enjoy robbing your homes, well, raping your wife or daughters, and robbing jewelry stores and Walmart.
[00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:36.392]  So government is obviously going to be the big whammy, not just the hurricane.
[00:25:37.898 --> 00:25:43.800]  Talking to Charles last night, though, about what he witnessed back in seven years ago in Katrina to the day.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.280]  He said police from all over the U.S.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:53.982]  were leaving as they watched the New Orleans police robbing people and making women show their breasts for water and other things.
[00:25:53.982 --> 00:26:03.565]  So I'm not saying police nationwide act like this, but definitely super bad news in areas of Louisiana, which I just don't understand how anybody could act like that.
[00:26:04.085 --> 00:26:05.248]  But I guess they're criminals.
[00:26:05.248 --> 00:26:07.412]  I mean, I guess that's what criminals do.
[00:26:07.412 --> 00:26:10.298]  So we're going to be going over all of that.
[00:26:10.298 --> 00:26:13.104]  Hurricane Isaac pounds Louisiana.
[00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:14.847]  Water pours over levee.
[00:26:16.155 --> 00:26:28.282]  I gotta say, though, if I was a cop or even a citizen and saw cops doing that, why'd the police from Texas and other areas just leave when they saw the police looting and busting in doors and breaking old women's jaws?
[00:26:28.282 --> 00:26:29.383]  I would have stopped them.
[00:26:29.383 --> 00:26:33.445]  I mean, don't you have a duty to stop someone committing a crime?
[00:26:33.445 --> 00:26:34.846]  So I guess I can't say they're good.
[00:26:34.846 --> 00:26:39.049]  In other words, I haven't been in that situation, so I probably shouldn't judge them.
[00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:45.593]  I just don't know how we've gotten to this point where we just sit there and like, oh, well, you're evil, so you'll be the boss and we won't challenge what you're doing.
[00:26:46.857 --> 00:26:48.718]  Hurricane Isaac pounds Louisiana.
[00:26:48.718 --> 00:26:50.859]  Water pours over levee.
[00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:52.059]  This is out of USA Today.
[00:26:52.059 --> 00:26:53.520]  It just came out again in the last hour.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.581]  It pounded Louisiana with heavy rains and damaging winds today.
[00:26:57.581 --> 00:27:03.003]  As forecasters said, the storm surge and serious flooding will likely continue through the night.
[00:27:03.003 --> 00:27:10.526]  Isaac was still maintaining Category 1 hurricane strength, but just barely with sustained winds of 75 miles an hour.
[00:27:10.526 --> 00:27:11.106]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:27:11.106 --> 00:27:13.027]  If it stalls over Louisiana, look out.
[00:27:14.369 --> 00:27:21.012]  It'd be better, many experts say, if it just kept barreling on through and disseminating its water evenly, not all in one spot.
[00:27:21.012 --> 00:27:32.438]  The National Hurricane Service Center reported it was located directly over Houma, Louisiana, which is about 45 miles southwest of New Orleans.
[00:27:32.438 --> 00:27:33.719]  Southwest.
[00:27:33.719 --> 00:27:35.900]  So it's dumping water right on New Orleans.
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:41.042]  The storm was crawling to the northwest at just six miles an hour.
[00:27:41.042 --> 00:27:42.383]  That is bad news.
[00:27:42.383 --> 00:27:43.384]  That is bad news.
[00:27:44.664 --> 00:27:53.651]  They report upwards of 14 plus billion spent on the repair and expansion of the levees.
[00:27:53.651 --> 00:27:59.035]  Well, there's a reason the people in the rural areas have houses on stilts that are cheap.
[00:27:59.035 --> 00:28:03.298]  It's so they get destroyed, they're not out of luck.
[00:28:03.298 --> 00:28:07.722]  But New Orleans has been sinking since they built it 400 years ago.
[00:28:07.722 --> 00:28:10.724]  It's one of the oldest cities in the United States, North America.
[00:28:12.403 --> 00:28:19.567]  Western cities and all I can say is New Orleans may not be savable long-term.
[00:28:19.567 --> 00:28:39.018]  I know there's globalist plans to move everybody out of there and so they can turn into a big industrial zone and I'm not saying that that is a good idea but I think they should say you know that people need to build houses on stilts and things but instead the feds are going to come in there and take everybody's guns if these levies break and
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.103]  Again, he talked to the producer, our producer, about 10 minutes before airtime.
[00:28:44.103 --> 00:28:46.085]  Plattman Parish and was waiting.
[00:28:46.085 --> 00:28:47.727]  Charles, we know his last name.
[00:28:47.727 --> 00:28:51.811]  He's one of our good sources, but he's got family in law enforcement.
[00:28:51.811 --> 00:28:53.753]  We'll just leave it at that.
[00:28:53.753 --> 00:28:59.618]  And in the fire department, we're not going to say who he is because last time he said his name, there was a bunch of repercussions with his family.
[00:29:00.479 --> 00:29:01.420]  Uh, and others.
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.181]  Well, he exposed the police shooting and killing people trying to get out of the city.
[00:29:05.181 --> 00:29:09.744]  So, uh, it was his original reports that helped bring some of those folks to justice.
[00:29:09.744 --> 00:29:11.665]  So he's a very good source.
[00:29:11.665 --> 00:29:14.006]  And, uh, Chris is emphatic.
[00:29:14.006 --> 00:29:19.028]  He said, waiting to get on the air should, I should have just recorded it right for the show.
[00:29:19.028 --> 00:29:21.950]  And we had him the Plaquemines Parish, um,
[00:29:23.447 --> 00:29:25.508]  Levy is broken.
[00:29:25.508 --> 00:29:26.028]  I don't know.
[00:29:26.028 --> 00:29:28.029]  That's what Charles said.
[00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:33.092]  And he's been on a caller for 14 years reporting stuff for us for seven.
[00:29:33.092 --> 00:29:35.614]  So we'll find out what's happening with that.
[00:29:35.614 --> 00:29:37.575]  OK, I got a bunch of other news.
[00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:43.298]  Of course, new Navy SEAL lies dealing with Obama.
[00:29:43.298 --> 00:29:48.741]  We've got a bunch of other news on false flags from DHS sources.
[00:29:48.741 --> 00:29:49.641]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.641 --> 00:29:51.042]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.042 --> 00:29:52.543]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.564 --> 00:29:56.228]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.353 --> 00:30:05.876]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:30:05.876 --> 00:30:08.277]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:30:08.277 --> 00:30:17.382]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:17.382 --> 00:30:20.824]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:30:20.824 --> 00:30:22.505]  There's no priming required.
[00:30:22.505 --> 00:30:24.786]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:30:24.786 --> 00:30:27.287]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:30:28.348 --> 00:30:29.869]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:30:29.869 --> 00:30:31.290]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.452]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:30:34.452 --> 00:30:37.855]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:30:37.855 --> 00:30:41.978]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:30:41.978 --> 00:30:44.720]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.301]  It's what my family uses.
[00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:49.623]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:30:49.623 --> 00:30:54.867]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[00:30:59.049 --> 00:31:01.551]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:01.551 --> 00:31:07.135]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:07.135 --> 00:31:12.158]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:12.158 --> 00:31:17.182]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:31:17.722 --> 00:31:22.946]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:22.946 --> 00:31:25.247]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:31:25.247 --> 00:31:30.050]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:31.171]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:31.171 --> 00:31:34.253]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:31:34.253 --> 00:31:37.876]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:31:37.876 --> 00:31:41.058]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:41.058 --> 00:31:43.279]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:44.200]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:31:47.842 --> 00:31:50.803]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:50.803 --> 00:31:56.906]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:56.906 --> 00:31:59.287]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:03.505]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[00:32:03.505 --> 00:32:09.449]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:32:09.449 --> 00:32:16.054]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[00:32:16.054 --> 00:32:21.737]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[00:32:21.737 --> 00:32:25.380]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.364]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[00:32:29.364 --> 00:32:33.969]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.

[00:32:36.471 --> 00:32:40.336]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[00:32:40.336 --> 00:32:44.760]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.403]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[00:32:47.703 --> 00:32:54.544]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[00:32:54.544 --> 00:33:08.107]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[00:33:08.107 --> 00:33:16.589]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

[00:33:30.519 --> 00:33:31.159]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:31.159 --> 00:33:31.619]  Central.
[00:33:31.619 --> 00:33:32.940]  12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:33.341]  Eastern.
[00:33:33.341 --> 00:33:34.521]  We are here live.
[00:33:34.521 --> 00:33:40.105]  And then of course we come back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:40.105 --> 00:33:42.547]  Live Central.
[00:33:42.547 --> 00:33:46.990]  And there is InfoWars Nightly News as well.
[00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:52.995]  InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:33:52.995 --> 00:33:55.376]  Gotta love that guitar, I'm sorry.
[00:33:55.376 --> 00:33:55.857]  Right there.
[00:33:57.555 --> 00:34:06.980]  Continuing 7 o'clock central with InfoWars at Nightly News that you can watch at InfoWarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:17.586]  You know I mentioned this several times in the last few days but never even really got into it but I will coming up in a moment because it dovetails with several issues.
[00:34:17.586 --> 00:34:19.787]  Scientists successfully hack brain to
[00:34:20.968 --> 00:34:21.288]  I think?
[00:34:41.499 --> 00:35:03.108]  Two years ago, we published a Natural News article, we posted it, talking about patents for pills with microchips and saying they would use this and put it in all pills to make people only take pills that have the tracker chips so we can be surveilled.
[00:35:03.108 --> 00:35:10.031]  And we got contacted by the PR firm of the big pharma company saying, that's inaccurate, take that down.
[00:35:10.882 --> 00:35:13.704]  We're not going to make people take these pills.
[00:35:13.704 --> 00:35:17.768]  And of course, we refused and kept the story up.
[00:35:17.768 --> 00:35:31.480]  But my point is, is that they're like, oh no, this won't ever be used to force you all to ingest tiny microchips so that we can track what you're taking and what you're doing.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:36.945]  But then sure enough, now there's a whole bunch of companies coming out with all of this information.
[00:35:37.225 --> 00:35:40.928]  Yeah, that was the story right there that Mike Adams did at NaturalNews.com.
[00:35:40.928 --> 00:35:47.253]  We ended up at Infowars.com, big pharma to begin microchipping drugs, and they went absolutely ape over that.
[00:35:47.253 --> 00:35:50.997]  Well, now it's a whole bunch of companies, and here it is in Reuters.
[00:35:50.997 --> 00:35:53.459]  Let me just cover it now since I mentioned it.
[00:35:53.459 --> 00:36:01.225]  If you have trouble remembering whether you took your pills on time, your medicine may soon have the answer for you.
[00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:01.946]  Oh, isn't that nice?
[00:36:03.499 --> 00:36:05.125]  I don't need to even remember anything.
[00:36:05.125 --> 00:36:06.208]  Who needs to know how to do math?
[00:36:06.208 --> 00:36:07.292]  I have a calculator.
[00:36:07.292 --> 00:36:08.356]  Who needs to walk?
[00:36:08.356 --> 00:36:10.122]  I can, you know, just have robot legs.
[00:36:12.056 --> 00:36:13.957]  Of course, all this has government-backed doors in it.
[00:36:13.957 --> 00:36:20.760]  Pills for anything from common cold to diabetes or cancer can be embedded with a tiny ingestible chips.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:33.146]  Yeah, that are going in all the major products, too, which they admit at the big consortium meetings for the RFID is called SmartDust, so they can track everything in real time, not just your cell phone, but everything, and have the smart meters.
[00:36:33.146 --> 00:36:35.908]  Even if you don't have one in your house, they have smart meters that read your meter.
[00:36:36.748 --> 00:36:40.471]  Where those will now interface with all your devices, including these.
[00:36:40.471 --> 00:36:41.572]  It's all admitted.
[00:36:41.572 --> 00:36:49.897]  They have whole maps of MIT of how they're going to control us and track us and decide how hot your house can be or how cold.
[00:36:49.897 --> 00:36:56.322]  The digital feedback technology devised by Redwoods City, California-based Protus Digital Health Inc.
[00:36:56.322 --> 00:36:57.903]  There's a whole bunch of these companies.
[00:36:57.903 --> 00:37:04.967]  Can also prompt patients to take their medication and even ask them to take a walk if they have been active too long.
[00:37:04.967 --> 00:37:05.568]  Oh, great!
[00:37:09.204 --> 00:37:11.385]  It bosses you around!
[00:37:11.385 --> 00:37:38.080]  Yeah, I saw an article five years ago, out of a Florida paper, I don't remember exactly where, the point is it was all over the news, you've seen it, where the government gives grants to old people to live in these managed communities where everything in their refrigerator is tracked, there's smart meters on the house, and then it tells them when to eat, it makes sure they're eating, there's a computer talking to you like the HAL 9000, this is all being designed to control us.
[00:37:39.016 --> 00:37:40.477]  A surveillance prison.
[00:37:40.477 --> 00:37:43.098]  The head of the CIA said it four months ago.
[00:37:43.098 --> 00:37:45.839]  He said, yeah, we're watching you through your appliances.
[00:37:45.839 --> 00:37:54.642]  You try to go buy new appliances, all of them are the new smart appliances that, oh, it ties into your smart meter and your smart house.
[00:37:54.642 --> 00:37:55.843]  Hey, I don't want that.
[00:37:58.063 --> 00:38:14.198]  They're super annoying, incredibly annoying, and you're being tracked because when you go by the dishwasher, you go by the computer, the cell phone, the clock radio, you're paying in the cost for the tech mandated to be put in there to track you.
[00:38:14.198 --> 00:38:23.286]  And I've talked to a lot of different top scientists on this subject, and they've pointed out
[00:38:24.588 --> 00:38:32.392]  That a big part of this surveillance system is why a lot of tech doesn't work well.
[00:38:32.392 --> 00:38:34.513]  It's why Microsoft products don't work well.
[00:38:34.513 --> 00:38:37.615]  Because it doesn't work well because it's got so many back doors in it.
[00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:41.277]  It's sending data back the entire time to Microsoft, back to Google.
[00:38:42.159 --> 00:38:43.680]  I mean, Google admits they got caught.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.161]  I told you they were doing this years ago.
[00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:47.984]  I told you they were set up by the NSA and CIA in 1998.
[00:38:47.984 --> 00:38:50.386]  That's all come out mainstream news.
[00:38:50.386 --> 00:38:56.430]  We had a CIA retired agent on who got so many threats over it, he's refused to ever come back on, David Steele.
[00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:58.752]  In fact, I want to get David Steele back on.
[00:38:58.752 --> 00:39:00.274]  He said, maybe later.
[00:39:00.274 --> 00:39:01.635]  Hadn't been on in like five years.
[00:39:01.635 --> 00:39:02.856]  I want him back on.
[00:39:02.856 --> 00:39:10.182]  And Dr. Stallman said he would come back on when he got back from Europe and China trip, one of the inventors of open source.
[00:39:11.042 --> 00:39:12.283]  He doesn't like to call it Linux.
[00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:14.024]  He calls it something else when you use that term.
[00:39:14.024 --> 00:39:14.885]  I'm not really a tech guy.
[00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:19.888]  The point is, yeah, GNU, the point is, is that this is a takeover.
[00:39:19.888 --> 00:39:23.671]  OK, so and the media always acts like I'm anti-science.
[00:39:23.671 --> 00:39:24.811]  No, it's the opposite.
[00:39:24.811 --> 00:39:25.892]  I love technology.
[00:39:25.892 --> 00:39:27.253]  I love aircraft.
[00:39:27.253 --> 00:39:28.514]  I love cars.
[00:39:28.514 --> 00:39:29.755]  I love tech.
[00:39:29.755 --> 00:39:31.356]  I love smartphones.
[00:39:31.356 --> 00:39:32.677]  I love it.
[00:39:32.677 --> 00:39:40.642]  But I don't like the fact that it's all designed to track and control me and back doors are built into it that I'm paying for.
[00:39:42.263 --> 00:39:46.986]  You're paying for the technology that's put in there, mandated by the different Telecommunications Act.
[00:39:46.986 --> 00:39:49.948]  And by the way, we're under a global government already, to a great extent.
[00:39:49.948 --> 00:39:52.830]  This is standardized worldwide.
[00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:57.753]  You know, you've finally seen a big hubbub made about the Chinese tech, built with all these backdoors.
[00:39:57.753 --> 00:39:59.774]  Guys, you put that on screen, people won't believe it.
[00:39:59.774 --> 00:40:02.416]  That almost all the microchips made in China
[00:40:03.976 --> 00:40:22.189]  Have back doors built in it, and all these Republican senators have gotten upset on an investigation because there's spy tech in the B-2 bombers, and there's spy tech in the new F-18s, and there's spy tech in the new helicopters, and kill switches.
[00:40:22.189 --> 00:40:27.073]  And the Chinese came out and said, these are specifications you requested.
[00:40:27.073 --> 00:40:29.755]  I'm not defending the Communist Chinese leadership.
[00:40:29.755 --> 00:40:32.117]  The point is, is that that's global.
[00:40:33.723 --> 00:40:38.224]  It's not just the Chinese that are building tech with kill switches and backdoors.
[00:40:38.224 --> 00:40:40.024]  It's all got it.
[00:40:40.024 --> 00:40:46.685]  It's all got it because the globalists want it in there.
[00:40:46.685 --> 00:40:47.606]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:40:47.606 --> 00:40:48.826]  DefenseTech.org.
[00:40:48.826 --> 00:40:51.966]  Proof that military chips from China are infected.
[00:40:51.966 --> 00:40:53.827]  Security backdoor found in China made U.S.
[00:40:53.827 --> 00:40:55.247]  military chip.
[00:40:55.247 --> 00:40:56.347]  Information Age.
[00:40:56.347 --> 00:40:59.648]  Backdoor in made-in-China computer chips threatens U.S.
[00:40:59.648 --> 00:41:00.228]  military.
[00:41:00.228 --> 00:41:00.968]  Taipei Times.
[00:41:02.148 --> 00:41:04.249]  Backdoor found in Chinese made U.S.
[00:41:04.249 --> 00:41:05.070]  chips.
[00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:06.351]  Slash dot.
[00:41:06.351 --> 00:41:07.011]  InfoWars.
[00:41:07.011 --> 00:41:08.972]  Security backdoor found in Chinese made U.S.
[00:41:08.972 --> 00:41:09.332]  chips.
[00:41:09.332 --> 00:41:10.493]  Alex Jones.
[00:41:10.493 --> 00:41:14.175]  On and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:41:14.175 --> 00:41:16.537]  Now.
[00:41:16.537 --> 00:41:18.298]  Where is my stupid tracker phone?
[00:41:19.878 --> 00:41:30.867]  This little piece of technology where I can check the weather when I'm out on the road, where I can keep in touch with my family, where I can shoot videos and upload them on the road of what's going on.
[00:41:30.867 --> 00:41:32.568]  It's a great double-edged sword.
[00:41:32.568 --> 00:41:33.469]  Just like Facebook.
[00:41:33.469 --> 00:41:35.210]  Hey, we know it's an enemy platform.
[00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:37.672]  We use it because that's where the battle is.
[00:41:37.672 --> 00:41:40.574]  If you won't engage in the battle space, you're going to lose very quickly.
[00:41:40.574 --> 00:41:42.416]  But you better be aware of the battle space.
[00:41:43.752 --> 00:41:48.496]  And all of you out there that are in PSYOP who think you're so cool, you're a victim of your own PSYOP.
[00:41:48.496 --> 00:41:55.383]  This system, in their own words, plans on killing you and your family once this is in place.
[00:41:55.383 --> 00:42:01.708]  So that is so foolish to think that you're on a winning team just because you know all of this.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:16.051]  What, does it make it okay that you know that there's a global government forming and sending its electronic tentacles into everything to track and control society and turn off resources and then start systematic soft kill operations?
[00:42:16.051 --> 00:42:17.272]  They're going to accelerate those?
[00:42:17.272 --> 00:42:21.016]  I mean, if you think that's cute and funny, if you think it's, I mean, look right here.
[00:42:21.856 --> 00:42:24.018]  Keep showing this every day the last couple months.
[00:42:24.018 --> 00:42:27.780]  Harvard study confirms fluoride reduces children's IQ.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.122]  Fox News, Food Consumer, you name it.
[00:42:31.122 --> 00:42:32.703]  Reduces IQ massively.
[00:42:32.703 --> 00:42:37.046]  10 to 20 points depending on what variant of type of fluoride and how much.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.901]  Depending on the city.
[00:42:39.901 --> 00:42:43.502]  And causes massive cancer increases and all sorts of other nasty things.
[00:42:43.502 --> 00:42:44.743]  They knew this in the 20s.
[00:42:44.743 --> 00:42:55.027]  Again, did you get a memo, CHIOP officers, in corporations and in the Marines, and in the Army, and in the Department of Defense, and at DARPA, did you get a memo not to drink this?
[00:42:55.027 --> 00:42:58.308]  The answer is, no you didn't get a memo, you idiots!
[00:42:59.383 --> 00:43:05.206]  What, you think you're going to sell out to a technocracy that's killing people and letting the troops use DU?
[00:43:05.206 --> 00:43:07.487]  That's a death sentence.
[00:43:07.487 --> 00:43:12.790]  But you're going to play along in the system and get your pension and go play golf?
[00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:13.871]  You're idiots.
[00:43:13.871 --> 00:43:15.712]  You're morons.
[00:43:15.712 --> 00:43:21.855]  You cannot make a deal with an evil of this magnitude.
[00:43:21.855 --> 00:43:24.417]  And it just goes on to say doctors want everybody
[00:43:25.731 --> 00:43:35.996]  To have all pills, over-the-counter, you name it, need to have chips so they can monitor you and track you because of drug abuse.
[00:43:35.996 --> 00:43:42.660]  Yeah, they push all their toxic drugs on people, get them addicted, and now say everybody's got to eat microchips.
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:48.022]  They've already found most Americans that are having autopsies done already have nanotech in their brain.
[00:43:48.022 --> 00:43:49.343]  Oh, you think that's an accident?
[00:43:49.343 --> 00:43:54.646]  They've already got vaccines introduced and tests on troops that are coming back like zombies that wipe out emotion.
[00:43:58.171 --> 00:44:00.992]  Your free will destroyed, basically lobotomized.
[00:44:00.992 --> 00:44:04.993]  They call it the anti-stress vaccine.
[00:44:04.993 --> 00:44:08.794]  The point of this technology is not to say you're being a bad patient.
[00:44:08.794 --> 00:44:11.074]  The point is to have accurate data.
[00:44:11.074 --> 00:44:12.254]  And that's the doublespeak.
[00:44:12.254 --> 00:44:14.675]  It is saying we're going to track you as a patient.
[00:44:14.675 --> 00:44:18.016]  Co-founder of the company, Chief Medical Officer George Savage said,
[00:44:19.687 --> 00:44:27.971]  The swallower sensor is linked to a skin patch worn on a patient's torso, which captured the report sent by the sensor about the size of a grain of salt.
[00:44:27.971 --> 00:44:35.435]  The sensor has no battery or antenna and is activated when it gets wet from stomach juices.
[00:44:35.435 --> 00:44:43.299]  That completes a circuit between coatings of copper and magnesium on the other side, generating a tiny electrical voltage for a few minutes.
[00:44:43.299 --> 00:44:45.220]  This is just the first gen of all this.
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.962]  And it goes through basically making the patients all take these and where all that's going.
[00:44:50.356 --> 00:44:52.921]  Let me add too, this is all quack stuff.
[00:44:52.921 --> 00:44:56.328]  Just like they've proven the lie detectors are a fraud.
[00:44:57.403 --> 00:45:01.626]  They now have these brain scans at airports saying, you know, you're a killer, you're this or that.
[00:45:01.626 --> 00:45:02.927]  That's all a fraud.
[00:45:02.927 --> 00:45:06.009]  A scientist successfully hacked brain to obtain private data.
[00:45:06.009 --> 00:45:14.055]  It sounds like something out of a Johnny mnemonic, but scientists have successfully been able to hack a brain with a device that's easily available on the open market.
[00:45:14.055 --> 00:45:22.802]  Researchers from the University of California, University of Oxford in Geneva figured out a way to pluck sensitive information from a person's head, such as PIN numbers and bank information.
[00:45:22.802 --> 00:45:24.163]  And it goes over it.
[00:45:24.163 --> 00:45:25.784]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's just stop right there.
[00:45:27.366 --> 00:45:28.647]  Let me tell you how to hack the brain.
[00:45:28.647 --> 00:45:31.689]  The Pentagon actually has documents called Hacking the Brain.
[00:45:31.689 --> 00:45:34.631]  The brain has no firewalls from the 80s.
[00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:35.792]  Look it up.
[00:45:35.792 --> 00:45:36.973]  Full spectrum dominance.
[00:45:36.973 --> 00:45:37.994]  The brain and beyond.
[00:45:37.994 --> 00:45:41.757]  Just look it up.
[00:45:41.757 --> 00:45:43.538]  Your eyes are brain tissue.
[00:45:43.538 --> 00:45:46.620]  They grew out of your brain in the embryonic development.
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:49.562]  It hacks the brain when you look at something.
[00:45:49.562 --> 00:45:51.884]  Your brain is now accessing that information.
[00:45:51.884 --> 00:45:55.627]  You show a man, an attractive naked woman, it hacks the brain.
[00:45:57.179 --> 00:46:02.963]  You show somebody images of a, uh, ice water, when they're in the desert, it hacks the brain.
[00:46:02.963 --> 00:46:06.765]  So, understand, ladies and gentlemen, the brain doesn't have firewalls.
[00:46:06.765 --> 00:46:11.047]  It's wide open.
[00:46:11.047 --> 00:46:19.933]  When you're on an unconscious mode, and just accept everything you're being told, in a jellyfish mode, suspended disbelief, you are wide open to anything and everything.
[00:46:21.454 --> 00:46:29.056]  Now coming up when we get Doug Hagman, private investigator, advisor to police, military, you name it.
[00:46:29.056 --> 00:46:37.058]  When we get Hagman on, his source in DHS is saying Obama is quote, going hot with a false flag.
[00:46:37.058 --> 00:46:40.139]  And then we got Steve Quayle joining us to expand on that.
[00:46:40.139 --> 00:46:42.019]  We'll also intersperse a lot of other news.
[00:46:42.019 --> 00:46:45.300]  But let me just put this out for you right now.
[00:46:47.461 --> 00:47:09.528]  There have been four different Democratic Party fundraising memos that went out saying, don't worry, even if the Republican nominee ends up beating Obama in polls, there's just going to be a staged event.
[00:47:09.528 --> 00:47:10.968]  There's going to be a new Oklahoma City or 9-11.
[00:47:10.968 --> 00:47:12.749]  We're going to blame it on the Tea Party.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:19.042]  Also, Robert Shapiro, the famous lawyer, Clinton and Obama advisor, wrote that in the Financial Times of London.
[00:47:19.042 --> 00:47:21.843]  He said, without an Oklahoma City or 9-11, Obama's gone.
[00:47:21.843 --> 00:47:22.184]  Yeah.
[00:47:22.184 --> 00:47:24.905]  I mean, they say they're neck and neck, Obama and Romney.
[00:47:24.905 --> 00:47:30.907]  And sure, it doesn't matter at one level, but the system, the crime syndicate behind Obama wants to stay in power.
[00:47:30.907 --> 00:47:31.127]  Okay?
[00:47:34.397 --> 00:47:41.801]  When they openly say, without a terror attack, we're done, you have to look at that and say, wow, they may do this.
[00:47:41.801 --> 00:47:48.725]  And they've been setting the stage now to shift from Al Qaeda to domestic groups in the media since I've been reporting this the last three years.
[00:47:48.725 --> 00:47:54.668]  And since Glenn Beck, a year and a half ago, right before he left Fox News, warned people that they were preparing to blame him.
[00:47:54.668 --> 00:48:00.031]  Well, if you actually read Media Matters, it's me and Beck and anybody else they don't like.
[00:48:00.031 --> 00:48:02.973]  And even though Beck is somewhat controlled opposition from the right wing quarter,
[00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:07.250]  Because the globalists have to have a right wing to control.
[00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:12.051]  Still, the real heart of the global system is what they call liberal.
[00:48:12.051 --> 00:48:18.093]  It's not liberal at all, but that's the core of the ideology is what we know of as establishment liberals.
[00:48:18.093 --> 00:48:25.936]  So they see people from Glenn Beck, Michael Savage, and then going out more towards real media, you know, Matt Drudge.
[00:48:27.412 --> 00:48:31.434]  Alex Jones, they see us as in one camp and are going after us.
[00:48:31.434 --> 00:48:39.398]  So, I want to play this clip here of Glenn Beck a year and a half ago, talking about how they're talking about staging events.
[00:48:39.398 --> 00:48:41.178]  Here it is.
[00:48:41.178 --> 00:48:43.119]  Why does the left need this violence?
[00:48:43.119 --> 00:48:50.963]  Well, listen to a clip from a Democratic pollster, Mark Penn, happened just the other day and yet no one pays attention to it.
[00:48:50.963 --> 00:48:54.585]  How can the left win the country?
[00:48:54.585 --> 00:48:54.865]  Watch.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.342]  Cabinets don't really sell things.
[00:48:58.342 --> 00:49:00.664]  The President himself has to reconnect with the people.
[00:49:00.664 --> 00:49:04.947]  Remember, President Clinton reconnected through Oklahoma, right?
[00:49:04.947 --> 00:49:07.890]  And the President right now seems removed.
[00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:12.053]  And it wasn't until that speech that he re-clicked with the American public.
[00:49:12.053 --> 00:49:13.955]  Obama needs a similar kind of event.
[00:49:13.955 --> 00:49:19.660]  You think words will work for... Obama needs a similar kind of event.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:20.421]  Oh!
[00:49:20.421 --> 00:49:21.522]  Well, like Oklahoma City.
[00:49:22.378 --> 00:49:32.583]  If only Barack Obama could have the opportunity to speak to America after another Oklahoma City-type event, then he'll politically be in good shape.
[00:49:32.583 --> 00:49:34.944]  Wow!
[00:49:34.944 --> 00:49:42.188]  Now, according to Drummond Pike, the founder of Tides, who, Drummond, I hope you watch this week, because, oh, it's all coming undone this week.
[00:49:43.642 --> 00:49:47.163]  I will be the guy who causes the next Oklahoma City.
[00:49:47.163 --> 00:49:54.724]  This is in a letter, an appeal to advertisers of Fox, dear Fox advertisers, read this part of it.
[00:49:54.724 --> 00:49:58.905]  No one, left, right, center, wants to see another Oklahoma City.
[00:49:58.905 --> 00:50:00.705]  The next assassin may succeed.
[00:50:00.705 --> 00:50:03.146]  If so, there will be blood on many hands.
[00:50:03.146 --> 00:50:06.106]  They are setting up another Oklahoma City.
[00:50:06.106 --> 00:50:11.147]  They are claiming that one is coming and they've already marked the one who caused it.
[00:50:12.944 --> 00:50:17.027]  But don't you miss Wednesday's show, where I show you violence and the pressure.
[00:50:17.027 --> 00:50:21.751]  Again, the reason I show you this is I've pioneered exposing the false flag for 17 years.
[00:50:21.751 --> 00:50:25.154]  That's why I got into media was I knew Oklahoma City was a staged event.
[00:50:25.154 --> 00:50:28.236]  Because I saw the newscast that were aired here locally.
[00:50:28.236 --> 00:50:29.677]  People got the tapes from Oklahoma.
[00:50:29.677 --> 00:50:31.018]  I watched them on AXS television.
[00:50:31.018 --> 00:50:31.799]  That was the last straw.
[00:50:33.871 --> 00:50:39.596]  The point is, it's good news that now Larry Pratt's come out and said Obama could be staging these shootings.
[00:50:39.596 --> 00:50:41.617]  Because he staged Fast and Furious.
[00:50:41.617 --> 00:50:47.982]  People wouldn't even be able to recognize Fast and Furious as a false flag if we hadn't done this, and if you hadn't got the word out.
[00:50:47.982 --> 00:50:52.546]  Now Michael Savage talks like this, Glenn Beck does, Rush Limbaugh does.
[00:50:52.546 --> 00:50:56.629]  This is what will stop false flag, is recognizing it exists.
[00:50:56.629 --> 00:50:59.271]  The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[00:51:02.205 --> 00:51:08.388]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:51:08.388 --> 00:51:13.491]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[00:51:13.491 --> 00:51:15.672]  That's in the mainstream news every day.

[00:54:01.522 --> 00:54:07.325]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:07.325 --> 00:54:09.626]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:12.901 --> 00:54:17.504]  So we have private investigator, advisor to state police, the feds, you name it.
[00:54:17.504 --> 00:54:19.386]  And I found he's got some pretty good information.
[00:54:19.386 --> 00:54:31.154]  Doug Hagman, he's got a homeland security source that dovetails with all the police officers you've heard call in and say all Hades, they've been told, is going to break loose in late October, early November.
[00:54:31.154 --> 00:54:32.074]  October surprise.
[00:54:32.074 --> 00:54:33.735]  Is that the Iran war?
[00:54:33.735 --> 00:54:38.279]  Staged terror attacks where homeland security claims the Tea Party's working with Iran?
[00:54:38.999 --> 00:54:41.721]  They're now saying that in Army reports.
[00:54:41.721 --> 00:54:42.902]  Iran and Al-Qaeda.
[00:54:42.902 --> 00:54:44.443]  And you're like, that's ridiculous.
[00:54:44.443 --> 00:54:48.526]  Well, that's because you're a Tea Party person and you know how Islamophobic they are.
[00:54:48.526 --> 00:54:50.227]  You can use that term.
[00:54:50.227 --> 00:54:53.529]  I mean, the average Tea Party person thinks Muslims are hiding under the table.
[00:54:53.529 --> 00:54:59.914]  That new 2016 movie that's out basically says Obama's a secret Muslim whose anti-colonialists are selling us out to him.
[00:54:59.914 --> 00:55:06.719]  Homeland Security says, I mean, this is scrambled psyop, that that group is working with the Muslims.
[00:55:07.679 --> 00:55:12.365]  Hey, let me tell you, if they blow up a city and say it, the general public will get in line.
[00:55:12.365 --> 00:55:17.452]  Some Tea Party people will denounce their neighbor's Tea Party and say, they must be Al-Qaeda too.
[00:55:17.452 --> 00:55:22.618]  Don't, don't, don't put anything past them, because see, people get caught up in the hype.
[00:55:23.496 --> 00:55:32.522]  They get caught up in the pageantry of putting the American flags out and getting all angry, and it's all over the news, and it's exciting we got hit by terrorists.
[00:55:32.522 --> 00:55:34.743]  I mean, it's like a little sick event.
[00:55:34.743 --> 00:55:37.465]  Just like 9-11 and other events were staged.
[00:55:37.465 --> 00:55:40.707]  And we will lose our country with this fake terror if we don't wake up to it.
[00:55:40.707 --> 00:55:44.169]  Because it isn't just Obama that ships guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:55:44.169 --> 00:55:46.250]  And it isn't just Clinton that staged Oklahoma City.
[00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:47.251]  The evidence is legion.
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.061]  Okay, it's a lot bigger than that.
[00:55:50.061 --> 00:55:55.165]  The globalists that control our government are financing and protecting terrorists.
[00:55:55.165 --> 00:55:59.088]  Just like with NATO running Al-Qaeda right now.
[00:55:59.088 --> 00:56:00.769]  Publicly.
[00:56:00.769 --> 00:56:07.173]  And taking families and threatening to kill their kids if daddy doesn't drive a truck into the police checkpoint.
[00:56:07.173 --> 00:56:07.974]  Full of explosives.
[00:56:07.974 --> 00:56:09.375]  And then they get on the news and say,
[00:56:10.921 --> 00:56:15.482]  Oh, you know, the citizens are so mad they're suicide-bombing Assad.
[00:56:15.482 --> 00:56:27.046]  Foreigners out of Saudi Arabia, backed by our criminal government, which is an illegitimate criminal enterprise now, are suicide-bombing with al-Qaeda.
[00:56:27.046 --> 00:56:32.487]  While saying the Tea Party, the army is being taught, is going to link up with al-Qaeda.
[00:56:32.487 --> 00:56:34.128]  I know this sounds crazy, because it is.
[00:56:35.694 --> 00:56:39.656]  The globalists are going into a takeover phase right now, the likes of which I've never seen.
[00:56:39.656 --> 00:56:45.838]  So when our guest says DHS is going hot, Obama false flag coming, I think I'm going to Twitter out that video from last night.
[00:56:45.838 --> 00:56:46.439]  It's so important.
[00:56:46.439 --> 00:56:47.959]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:56:47.959 --> 00:56:49.040]  We better look out.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.521]  Now, here's Michael Savage two years ago.
[00:56:52.521 --> 00:56:55.263]  Love him or hate him, I appreciate the courage here to come out and say this.
[00:56:55.263 --> 00:56:59.284]  He said this five times I know of, because the clips are on YouTube, that you look out.
[00:56:59.284 --> 00:57:04.607]  The White House close to the election, if they get in trouble, will stage a Reichstag false flag.
[00:57:04.607 --> 00:57:04.927]  Here it is.
[00:57:06.178 --> 00:57:07.919]  Now I'll make another prediction.
[00:57:07.919 --> 00:57:15.644]  I predict that very soon, Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag fire.
[00:57:15.644 --> 00:57:20.187]  I don't know what form it will take, but I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are,
[00:57:20.971 --> 00:57:34.084]  Ram Emanuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind, and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War, when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.
[00:57:34.084 --> 00:57:37.727]  I will tell you as I sit here, I fear that every night as I go to sleep.
[00:57:37.727 --> 00:57:43.673]  I put nothing past these agitators, who have suddenly seized control of the most powerful economy, and the...
[00:57:44.819 --> 00:57:52.003]  And he goes on to say he thinks eargun-trained terrorists are in the White House, and then lists some of the people.
[00:57:52.003 --> 00:57:56.026]  That, of course, was the group that used terrorism to create Israel.
[00:57:56.026 --> 00:58:02.810]  Ladies and gentlemen, the issue here is, the White House advisors are all saying this.
[00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:04.691]  That's why Savage was warning.
[00:58:04.691 --> 00:58:13.356]  Because when they start openly bragging, basically this broadcast, if I'm proud of anything, forced this out in the open, so made it safer for other people to talk about it.
[00:58:15.546 --> 00:58:23.792]  Hagman's law enforcement source in the federal government, I'll just leave it at that, is saying that they've decided to go hot.
[00:58:23.792 --> 00:58:26.914]  That Obama is going to stage a false flag.
[00:58:26.914 --> 00:58:30.857]  He's even got names.
[00:58:30.857 --> 00:58:36.540]  So we are going to go to break and come back with him and go over this.
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:37.001]  Stay with us.
[00:58:43.411 --> 00:58:51.097]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:55.874 --> 00:59:58.637]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.219 --> 01:00:10.061]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.061 --> 01:00:11.641]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:13.182]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.182 --> 01:00:17.383]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.383 --> 01:00:21.444]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.254 --> 01:00:45.260]  Coming up on the other side of this break, we're going to be joined by Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network.
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:55.149]  And his homeland security source, federal law enforcement level, said that they've been told something big in late October, early November, probably a false flag.
[01:00:55.149 --> 01:00:58.332]  And they said early on it looked like they were trying to start a race war.
[01:00:58.332 --> 01:00:59.774]  We know the White House has been caught doing that.
[01:01:01.343 --> 01:01:04.166]  That failed, though, with the whole Trayvon Martin thing, because the truth came out.
[01:01:04.166 --> 01:01:09.350]  I'm sad they used that poor young man's death to try to get it going.
[01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:15.716]  But the article is up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, the featured news area, DHS source.
[01:01:15.716 --> 01:01:16.557]  It's going hot.
[01:01:16.557 --> 01:01:18.519]  Obama false flag coming.
[01:01:18.519 --> 01:01:20.020]  I believe this can be stopped.
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:26.066]  And, you know, I've listened to Hagman for years when he's on syndicated radio shows and TV.
[01:01:26.066 --> 01:01:26.626]  I followed him.
[01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:34.071]  What his source is giving him fits the MO I have, and I think Hagman's a good guy.
[01:01:34.071 --> 01:01:51.975]  I am not saying that there is going to be a big false flag, but you better know, you better understand, that if we don't talk about it, and if we don't expose it, the likelihood of it is amplified.
[01:01:52.967 --> 01:01:59.433]  I mean, we had that guest on who it turned out was a famous TV presenter, producer.
[01:01:59.433 --> 01:02:01.655]  We knew who he was.
[01:02:01.655 --> 01:02:08.141]  But it came out in the news that he had infiltrated and gotten a security job at the Olympics, and they were teaching him that there would be a terror attack.
[01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:10.643]  And I said at the time, that doesn't mean there's going to be one.
[01:02:10.643 --> 01:02:13.286]  They do that to gauge people and hype up fear.
[01:02:14.955 --> 01:02:17.356]  But there could have been an event if we hadn't exposed it.
[01:02:17.356 --> 01:02:22.897]  I mean, the British government, with a MI6 asset, a SWAT, did stage 7-7.
[01:02:22.897 --> 01:02:26.897]  That even came out on Associated Press Fox News.
[01:02:26.897 --> 01:02:31.758]  Former Justice Department official Loftus, John Loftus, went public with that.
[01:02:31.758 --> 01:02:33.679]  And that came out in the London Telegraph.
[01:02:33.679 --> 01:02:36.799]  But this is always months after something comes out.
[01:02:36.799 --> 01:02:39.560]  So governments got the underwear bomber on the plane.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.200]  The shoe bomber on the plane.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.781]  That all came out on C-SPAN and congressional testimony.
[01:02:45.425 --> 01:02:49.668]  All of this is very, very real, and all of this is a real threat.
[01:02:49.668 --> 01:02:55.672]  And you've got all these White House advisors, I just played you clips of them talking about it, even on Hardball.
[01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:57.453]  A mass shooting will help us connect.
[01:02:57.453 --> 01:03:01.015]  A huge terror attack will help the President connect.
[01:03:01.015 --> 01:03:03.016]  Oklahoma City got Bill Clinton re-elected.
[01:03:03.016 --> 01:03:04.197]  We need another one.
[01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.218]  Don't worry, fundraisers.
[01:03:06.218 --> 01:03:07.399]  It looks like Obama's down.
[01:03:07.399 --> 01:03:08.740]  There's going to be an event.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.081]  We're going to blame it on our enemies.
[01:03:10.081 --> 01:03:11.802]  I mean, this is so transparent.
[01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:14.670]  We would be insane.
[01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:16.551]  I'm going to recap this when we come back.
[01:03:16.551 --> 01:03:17.571]  It's so important.
[01:03:17.571 --> 01:03:20.172]  We would be insane to not be looking at this.
[01:03:20.172 --> 01:03:23.454]  I'm going to send that 15-minute video out because it's already out there.
[01:03:23.454 --> 01:03:26.215]  You're about to hear more, an in-depth interview with Doug Hagman.
[01:03:26.215 --> 01:03:27.756]  But I'm going to send that interview out.
[01:03:28.616 --> 01:03:30.537]  at Real Alex Jones there on Twitter.
[01:03:30.537 --> 01:03:34.498]  Real Alex Jones again is at Twitter.com forward slash Real Alex Jones.
[01:03:34.498 --> 01:03:44.742]  You can also go to InfoWars.com and click on the social media link and find our links to our official Facebook, our Twitter, all of it there at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:03:44.742 --> 01:03:50.264]  But if you're not following us there on Twitter during this break, I am going to
[01:03:51.424 --> 01:03:58.666]  Send the link out via my little government tracking device here to everyone because it is so incredibly important.
[01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:00.607]  In fact, people show a document cam shot right here.
[01:04:00.607 --> 01:04:04.668]  If you're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV, I am going to go to the link.
[01:04:12.236 --> 01:04:14.019]  Is it already rolled off the front page?
[01:04:14.019 --> 01:04:19.366]  I want to make sure that's put back on the front page that interview that we did last night.
[01:04:19.366 --> 01:04:22.330]  It's already scrolled off into the breaking news link.
[01:04:22.330 --> 01:04:26.616]  You want to go to the breaking news link or the top stories link will also take you there to
[01:04:29.579 --> 01:04:32.361]  Find that link for everybody.
[01:04:32.361 --> 01:04:36.043]  If you go to Top Stories, it's probably the best place to find that.
[01:04:36.043 --> 01:04:39.925]  And that's where all the featured news that scrolls off goes.
[01:04:39.925 --> 01:04:42.786]  But we're going to get that out to everybody.
[01:04:42.786 --> 01:04:43.987]  There it is, DHS Source.
[01:04:43.987 --> 01:04:45.268]  It's going hot.
[01:04:45.268 --> 01:04:46.749]  Obama false flag coming.
[01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:49.390]  I'm going to take that video and text.
[01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:52.031]  I'm going to send it out on my Twitter right now.
[01:04:52.031 --> 01:04:53.712]  Real Alex Jones there.
[01:04:53.712 --> 01:04:58.255]  You can sign up by going to the icon for Twitter right there and visiting that.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:07.204]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:05:07.204 --> 01:05:09.806]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:05:09.806 --> 01:05:15.189]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:05:15.189 --> 01:05:20.152]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:05:20.152 --> 01:05:27.477]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[01:05:27.777 --> 01:05:31.659]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[01:05:31.659 --> 01:05:33.461]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:05:33.461 --> 01:05:37.463]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[01:05:37.463 --> 01:05:40.385]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:05:40.385 --> 01:05:43.166]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today.
[01:05:43.166 --> 01:05:47.709]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:05:47.709 --> 01:05:48.370]  Don't wait!
[01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:50.251]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:05:50.251 --> 01:05:50.411]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:05:55.854 --> 01:05:58.114]  Or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:05:58.114 --> 01:06:00.435]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:06:00.435 --> 01:06:05.936]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:06:05.936 --> 01:06:08.356]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:06:08.356 --> 01:06:14.057]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[01:06:14.057 --> 01:06:17.458]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:17.458 --> 01:06:20.898]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:06:20.898 --> 01:06:22.579]  There's no priming required.
[01:06:22.579 --> 01:06:23.399]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[01:06:24.859 --> 01:06:27.522]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:06:27.522 --> 01:06:29.964]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:06:29.964 --> 01:06:31.365]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:06:31.365 --> 01:06:34.548]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds and wells.
[01:06:34.548 --> 01:06:37.931]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:06:37.931 --> 01:06:39.832]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[01:06:39.832 --> 01:06:42.074]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:06:42.074 --> 01:06:44.816]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:06:44.816 --> 01:06:46.378]  It's what my family uses.
[01:06:46.378 --> 01:06:49.701]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:06:49.701 --> 01:06:52.263]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout,

[01:07:00.647 --> 01:07:04.149]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or a colloidal silver.
[01:07:04.149 --> 01:07:10.112]  It is a nanocatalytic silver salt technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers of yesterday.
[01:07:10.112 --> 01:07:13.434]  This new molecular structure is permanently bonded to water.
[01:07:13.434 --> 01:07:19.737]  It is the only water-soluble silver that is 99% bioavailable and non-toxic with no known side effects.
[01:07:20.237 --> 01:07:28.220]  SilverSol's patented technology has advanced antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties with a 15-year shelf life.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:34.382]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is one of the most important items needed in any emergency.
[01:07:34.382 --> 01:07:41.125]  Independent testing from universities, hospitals, military, and private labs make this the most proven product in the industry.
[01:07:41.525 --> 01:07:44.088]  No silver solution is better or safer.
[01:07:44.088 --> 01:07:46.991]  Protect yourself and your loved ones and be prepared.

[01:08:09.926 --> 01:08:14.169]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to another hour
[01:08:40.126 --> 01:08:42.188]  of resistance to tyranny.
[01:08:42.188 --> 01:08:43.709]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:46.351]  We're here Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:08:46.351 --> 01:08:47.592]  Eastern.
[01:08:47.592 --> 01:08:51.915]  And of course, back Sundays, 4 to 6 Central, 5 to 7 Eastern.
[01:08:51.915 --> 01:09:03.385]  Also blasting out on XM 166 and over 115 AM and FM stations, I am Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, the capital city of Texas, Austin.
[01:09:04.605 --> 01:09:18.674]  Now, if you just joined us, earlier I was breaking down and playing clips of Michael Savage, the talk show host, saying he believes Obama will stage a terror attack before the election to stay in power.
[01:09:18.674 --> 01:09:26.539]  We played a clip of Glenn Beck that didn't get any national news when he did it, saying Obama will stage terror attacks to get re-elected, or his handlers will.
[01:09:27.472 --> 01:09:29.813]  That didn't get attention because they don't want to attack him on that.
[01:09:29.813 --> 01:09:35.475]  Kind of like they attacked Dave Mustaine at first for saying, hey, they staged Fast and Furious, they could be staging these.
[01:09:35.475 --> 01:09:39.816]  When he didn't apologize, they dropped it.
[01:09:39.816 --> 01:09:41.997]  Because they don't want to go there.
[01:09:41.997 --> 01:09:52.621]  You have four different White House advisors sending out letters to fundraisers, but also letters to sponsors, and in the Financial Times of London saying, if we have a terror attack,
[01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:56.333]  It can be blamed on our enemies.
[01:09:56.333 --> 01:09:58.077]  Now, they don't say they're going to do it.
[01:09:58.077 --> 01:10:04.030]  They say, without an Oklahoma City, without a 9-11, Robert Shapiro, I read the quotes last hour, he just joined us.
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:08.561]  Said, we need a terror attack or Obama won't get re-elected.
[01:10:08.561 --> 01:10:10.841]  If you don't believe me, just type it into a search engine.
[01:10:10.841 --> 01:10:11.561]  If you just joined us.
[01:10:11.561 --> 01:10:13.682]  I know there's listeners joining us every minute.
[01:10:13.682 --> 01:10:14.382]  Just type in.
[01:10:14.382 --> 01:10:16.682]  In fact, let's do it on Google in front of everybody.
[01:10:16.682 --> 01:10:20.223]  There's my Twitter on screen if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:10:20.223 --> 01:10:22.544]  Obama gives staged terror green light.
[01:10:22.544 --> 01:10:25.244]  Now that doesn't mean we can't put the light back on red.
[01:10:25.244 --> 01:10:29.685]  But that's what Mr. Hagman's sources are saying.
[01:10:29.685 --> 01:10:31.166]  That's what my sources are saying.
[01:10:31.166 --> 01:10:32.786]  That's why we're about to get into all of this.
[01:10:34.255 --> 01:10:37.638]  So this information is in everyone's face.
[01:10:37.638 --> 01:10:47.027]  And all you gotta do is type into the NSA search engine, Google, Obama advisors say false flag will get Obama re-elected.
[01:10:47.027 --> 01:10:50.391]  And you will get, not just InfoWars.com, you'll get
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:55.141]  Financial Times of London, you'll get hardballed.
[01:10:55.141 --> 01:11:00.263]  I mean, I just played the clip of them on hardball saying a shooting will help the president reconnect.
[01:11:00.263 --> 01:11:01.584]  That was a year ago.
[01:11:01.584 --> 01:11:02.664]  They constantly say it.
[01:11:02.664 --> 01:11:04.245]  There's so many instances of it.
[01:11:04.245 --> 01:11:06.105]  They say this like we're idiots.
[01:11:06.105 --> 01:11:09.567]  They say this like we're morons.
[01:11:09.567 --> 01:11:13.108]  And then the media every once in a while will attack those of us that point out they're saying it.
[01:11:13.108 --> 01:11:16.129]  It's like, hey, here's the elephant sitting on us in the living room.
[01:11:16.129 --> 01:11:17.430]  These guys have a pension.
[01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:20.171]  They got caught in Fast and Furious staging a false flag.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.261]  You know, take Larry Pratt.
[01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:23.961]  He was on my show right after those shootings happened.
[01:11:23.961 --> 01:11:30.225]  He said, Alex, I used to think you were wrong, but they got caught in a false flag of the Fast and Furious, so we've got to look at these being staged.
[01:11:30.225 --> 01:11:33.027]  And witnesses say multiple shooters in both events.
[01:11:33.027 --> 01:11:36.168]  Of course, they're staging it.
[01:11:36.168 --> 01:11:37.589]  I mean, they'll stage other events.
[01:11:37.589 --> 01:11:40.331]  They've got the motive, the timing, the UN treaty.
[01:11:40.331 --> 01:11:42.992]  They're doing it.
[01:11:42.992 --> 01:11:45.193]  I'm not up here risking my life for nothing.
[01:11:45.193 --> 01:11:47.695]  I want freedom in my time, not just for my children.
[01:11:49.173 --> 01:11:54.215]  I was offered 12 years ago, and 10 years ago, and 8 years ago, big national shows.
[01:11:54.215 --> 01:12:01.297]  If I would just cool all this, I could have been the big neocon queen like Glenn Beck.
[01:12:01.297 --> 01:12:02.498]  And I'm not attacking Glenn Beck.
[01:12:02.498 --> 01:12:05.879]  The point is, is that, you know, Darth Vader was good as well.
[01:12:05.879 --> 01:12:08.660]  I mean, I think he actually has woke up some.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:12.041]  That's why they're trying to push him off the air.
[01:12:12.041 --> 01:12:16.403]  The issue here is that there's good still in most of us, and we need to decide
[01:12:17.665 --> 01:12:18.946]  Which angels are we going to follow?
[01:12:18.946 --> 01:12:21.268]  Our lesser angels or the angels of God?
[01:12:21.268 --> 01:12:26.613]  We've got to decide if we're for good or for evil.
[01:12:26.613 --> 01:12:28.194]  There's two different things in this world.
[01:12:28.194 --> 01:12:29.656]  There's good and there's bad.
[01:12:29.656 --> 01:12:30.817]  And which side do you choose?
[01:12:32.162 --> 01:12:33.943]  Well, I choose good.
[01:12:33.943 --> 01:12:35.805]  Judge Schmelz would say good.
[01:12:35.805 --> 01:12:37.086]  Very good.
[01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:39.788]  Because, gotta throw Caddyshack in there.
[01:12:39.788 --> 01:12:42.790]  Because, I mean, you're only alive once, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:46.153]  So I don't get up here and say all of this because it's fun.
[01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:53.258]  I don't get up here when I get death threats and physically attacked and IRS harassment and all the rest of it because
[01:12:54.764 --> 01:12:57.526]  I just want to have fun and scare the daylights out of people.
[01:12:57.526 --> 01:13:04.310]  I have to say, so many guests years ago that I thought were too extreme, they've turned out to be right in many cases, which I don't like.
[01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:06.411]  I'm not happy we're being proven right.
[01:13:06.411 --> 01:13:09.793]  Should I play Glenn Beck, Michael Savage, saying they're going to stage false flags?
[01:13:09.793 --> 01:13:10.914]  It's not just me saying it.
[01:13:10.914 --> 01:13:14.316]  Or more importantly, should I read the Financial Times of London again to you?
[01:13:16.556 --> 01:13:19.317]  Should I play clips of hardball saying it?
[01:13:19.317 --> 01:13:26.101]  My question is, why do they think we're so dumb that they say Oklahoma City got Bill Clinton re-elected?
[01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:29.242]  Barring that, President Obama will not be re-elected.
[01:13:29.242 --> 01:13:37.206]  Don't worry, there'll be an event, and we'll blame it on the returning veterans, gun owners, and libertarians, and conservatives.
[01:13:37.206 --> 01:13:40.708]  But not the mainline conservatives, they're just actually globalist operatives.
[01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:43.469]  That's how they control the country, is by controlling the opposition.
[01:13:45.077 --> 01:13:47.999]  I mean, when they're doing this, when they're saying this, we have a real issue.
[01:13:47.999 --> 01:13:52.903]  Now, Steve Quayle, who co-hosts shows with Doug Hagman, is going to be on with us in the next hour.
[01:13:52.903 --> 01:13:57.486]  We'll have Doug run over a little bit because I know Steve may have some questions for him.
[01:13:57.486 --> 01:14:00.308]  But Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com is coming on.
[01:14:00.308 --> 01:14:00.988]  Doug Hagman.
[01:14:02.029 --> 01:14:04.592]  Uh, is, uh, uh, coming on right now.
[01:14:04.592 --> 01:14:12.379]  He's the founder and director of the Northeast Intelligence Network and CEO of a multi-state licensed private investigative agency serving many fortune 500 clients.
[01:14:12.379 --> 01:14:15.482]  27-year veteran of conducting investigations in the private sector.
[01:14:15.482 --> 01:14:21.728]  He's logged 50,000 hours of covert surveillance in his career and is the author of Tactical Surveillance, a bestseller.
[01:14:22.799 --> 01:14:30.002]  He is a member of the International Counterterrorism Officers Association and possesses many law enforcement-related training certificates and certifications.
[01:14:30.002 --> 01:14:32.943]  He has been used as an operational asset by the U.S.
[01:14:32.943 --> 01:14:37.164]  Department of Justice, the FBI, as well as the Pennsylvania and New York State Police Agencies.
[01:14:37.164 --> 01:14:39.885]  Hagum has performed 8,000 civil and criminal investigations.
[01:14:39.885 --> 01:14:42.887]  He's also a frequent expert witness throughout the United States.
[01:14:42.887 --> 01:14:46.708]  He's also certified in the forensic discipline of bloodstain pattern analysis.
[01:14:46.708 --> 01:14:49.149]  I'm not going to read all of his bio.
[01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.809]  It goes on and on.
[01:14:49.809 --> 01:14:51.670]  But he's been on Fox News, everything.
[01:14:52.551 --> 01:14:55.434]  Associated Press, Reuters, Coast to Coast AM and this show.
[01:14:56.696 --> 01:15:02.818]  And he joins us right now on the broadcast to break down his source.
[01:15:02.818 --> 01:15:04.518]  And here's the headline if you want to see his.
[01:15:04.518 --> 01:15:05.378]  This is already out.
[01:15:05.378 --> 01:15:08.739]  It's already in a video form from last night's InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:15:08.739 --> 01:15:09.599]  You can get it.
[01:15:09.599 --> 01:15:12.580]  I just tweeted it out at RealAlexJones at Twitter.
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:14.561]  Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[01:15:14.561 --> 01:15:20.682]  We're also getting a bunch of calls asking you how to sign up for the free newsletter that we send you free copies of the new newspaper in.
[01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:22.903]  It's InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:15:23.263 --> 01:15:25.245]  The network is being inundated with calls.

[01:15:28.227 --> 01:15:30.169]  I'm sorry we can't give you free hard copies.
[01:15:30.169 --> 01:15:31.410]  We sell them at cost.
[01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:32.450]  They sold out in 36 hours.
[01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.751]  36,000 copies.
[01:15:32.751 --> 01:15:34.152]  We kept back 4,000.
[01:15:38.486 --> 01:15:41.687]  But we printed 90,000, but 50,000 on the streets of Austin.
[01:15:41.687 --> 01:15:46.629]  The point is, is that you can get it free at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:58.413]  We're going to this format of our news that's emailed because our expert people we've talked to at the highest levels in government, out of government, say they'll never be able to really stop an email if we have your address.
[01:15:58.413 --> 01:16:01.475]  It'll be very hard down the road if they clamp down on stuff.
[01:16:01.475 --> 01:16:04.616]  If any Internet's left up, we'll still be able to get you emails.
[01:16:05.476 --> 01:16:09.377]  So if you want to stay in contact, InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:16:09.377 --> 01:16:13.998]  And we'll always be able to get you InfoWars.com and PresidentObama.com one way or another.
[01:16:13.998 --> 01:16:15.378]  Okay, Doug Hagman joins us.
[01:16:15.378 --> 01:16:17.199]  DHS source, it's going hot.
[01:16:17.199 --> 01:16:24.640]  Obama faces the prospect of not being re-elected, so the word is they've green-lighted the stage terror.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.500]  They're going hot.
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:30.201]  Now that doesn't mean we can't stop it, because you've heard the police officers of the show.
[01:16:30.201 --> 01:16:31.222]  You've heard our sources.
[01:16:31.222 --> 01:16:32.302]  They've been told it's coming.
[01:16:32.882 --> 01:16:34.243]  Late October, early November.
[01:16:34.243 --> 01:16:36.646]  That does not mean it's going to happen.
[01:16:36.646 --> 01:16:43.893]  They could be doing this as a shy-op, or they could be doing it as a poison pill with the NSA to see who spreads it in agencies.
[01:16:43.893 --> 01:16:45.154]  They admit they do that.
[01:16:45.154 --> 01:16:49.318]  Or they could be testing to see if we get upset and warn people.
[01:16:50.399 --> 01:16:53.480]  Or we could back him off, but I believe Doug Hagman's source.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.700]  I know he has these sources.
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:17:05.423]  Doug, we're going to break here in a few minutes, but recap what your source told you right now and specifically where you see this going in the time frame he gave you.
[01:17:05.423 --> 01:17:06.624]  Doug Hagman, thank you for joining us.
[01:17:07.464 --> 01:17:09.564]  Well, thanks, Alex, for having me.
[01:17:09.564 --> 01:17:18.646]  The time frame, let's address that first, within the next 60 days, any time within the next 60 days, two different scenarios.
[01:17:18.646 --> 01:17:33.669]  One, if something would happen, whether it's economical, whether it's as a result of, we'll say, the Middle East becoming explosive all of a sudden, or some other event out of the direct control of this
[01:17:34.705 --> 01:17:45.009]  group of people within this regime, the Obama regime, then of course they will roll with that and attempt to exploit that.
[01:17:45.009 --> 01:17:47.791]  After all, that's the best way to do it.
[01:17:47.791 --> 01:17:48.791]  Let something happen.
[01:17:48.791 --> 01:17:51.632]  Let's exploit the situation.
[01:17:51.632 --> 01:17:55.554]  That way we don't have our hands dirty, necessarily.
[01:17:55.554 --> 01:17:57.315]  The other alternative
[01:17:58.175 --> 01:18:04.821]  And this is what my source inside, with access to high levels at DHS said, is this.
[01:18:04.821 --> 01:18:18.532]  Sometime between now and the election, with emphasis on the week ten days before the election, optimum time, they would stage a false flag type of operation.
[01:18:18.532 --> 01:18:25.238]  And now this is only known to a very compartmentalized, very small group of people.
[01:18:26.218 --> 01:18:36.121]  And this, the ghost signal that we're talking about is coming from, of all people, Valerie Jarrett.
[01:18:36.121 --> 01:18:51.764]  And there's also, I've heard other people including, now again, this is allegedly from Valerie Jarrett, and allegedly from people such as Leo Girard, head of labor union.
[01:18:51.764 --> 01:18:53.305]  They're all working together.
[01:18:54.325 --> 01:18:57.006]  to advance this operation.
[01:18:57.006 --> 01:18:59.247]  Well, what is this operation?
[01:18:59.247 --> 01:19:08.711]  It's, according to my source, it could be one of perhaps three areas.
[01:19:08.711 --> 01:19:22.337]  One could be an operation, something that will elicit sympathy and empathy for the President himself, and will depict the white guys.
[01:19:23.177 --> 01:19:33.320]  With guns, with Bibles, conservative, pro-life, pro-Constitution, as the aggressors.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:36.941]  That's what we're looking at as perhaps the most likely scenario.
[01:19:36.941 --> 01:19:45.323]  And I'll tell you what's shocking about this, we're going to break, come back, we'll get into full detail with our guest and what his source is saying the intel is allegedly.
[01:19:45.323 --> 01:19:47.624]  And again, we're reporting this because we've seen
[01:19:48.524 --> 01:19:58.523]  From behind the scenes saying the white Al Qaeda, you know, the evil white guys are gonna attack, and they're the new enemy, to now the full rollout in TV and fiction and nonfiction and news.
[01:19:58.523 --> 01:19:59.525]  They're setting it up.
[01:20:00.911 --> 01:20:08.055]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:20:08.055 --> 01:20:25.786]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:20:25.786 --> 01:20:29.889]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:31.890]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:39.972]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:20:39.972 --> 01:20:46.233]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:20:46.233 --> 01:20:47.514]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:20:47.514 --> 01:20:48.374]  It's incredible.

[01:22:00.032 --> 01:22:04.795]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:22:04.795 --> 01:22:07.817]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:22:07.817 --> 01:22:16.143]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:22:16.773 --> 01:22:22.334]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:22:56.553 --> 01:22:57.814]  Protect your immune system.

[01:22:59.764 --> 01:23:02.765]  My name is Leslie, and I've had depression since I was a child.
[01:23:02.765 --> 01:23:10.106]  After being on Prozac for 20 years, I got onto the One World Way, and my need for Prozac was reduced by 50% within a few months.
[01:23:10.106 --> 01:23:13.387]  Now, after less than one year, I am completely off of Prozac.
[01:23:13.387 --> 01:23:17.427]  I learned that mercury is a toxin that causes brain damage and depression.
[01:23:17.427 --> 01:23:25.389]  By taking One World Way, I know that I've detoxified my brain of mercury and excess glutamate, and I'm now functioning with this dramatic improvement in my mood.
[01:23:26.189 --> 01:23:31.193]  The power to change your life lies in part in the power you have to change your body's chemistry.
[01:23:31.193 --> 01:23:37.998]  Through diet and supplementation, you have the power to change your body's chemistry to support dramatic improvements in health and happiness.
[01:23:37.998 --> 01:23:43.462]  Nature has been and always will be mankind's first and only pharmacy to choose from.
[01:23:43.462 --> 01:23:46.804]  Change your chemistry and change your life with One World Way.

[01:23:47.224 --> 01:23:47.424]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:47.424 --> 01:23:47.665]  Or visit
[01:23:53.949 --> 01:23:55.310]  One World Way dot com.
[01:23:55.310 --> 01:24:01.232]  That's One World W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:24:01.232 --> 01:24:10.297]  Look at your young men fighting.
[01:24:10.297 --> 01:24:13.618]  Look at your women crying.
[01:24:13.618 --> 01:24:17.300]  Look at your young men dying.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:20.821]  The way they've always done before.
[01:24:24.366 --> 01:24:31.031]  Well, I tell you, this is bold of Doug Hagman and his federal law enforcement source.
[01:24:31.031 --> 01:24:35.114]  It's bold to come out with this because they'll be able to probably track it back.
[01:24:35.114 --> 01:24:38.176]  It's bold to name names because, I mean, I know who Valerie Jarrett is.
[01:24:38.176 --> 01:24:39.898]  I don't know this other person.
[01:24:39.898 --> 01:24:41.739]  And this is what his source is saying.
[01:24:41.739 --> 01:24:43.140]  He heard from sources.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:47.723]  So getting past the names, the point is we see a massive PR buildup.
[01:24:48.764 --> 01:24:52.628]  Uh, demonizing libertarians, constitutionalists, saying we're terrorists.
[01:24:52.628 --> 01:24:54.971]  FEMA training videos everywhere about it.
[01:24:54.971 --> 01:25:01.817]  All these top White House people saying, boy, it'd sure be great to have a terror attack and blame it on our enemies.
[01:25:01.817 --> 01:25:03.799]  And they have a history of it with Oklahoma City.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:08.344]  The Deputy Attorney General intimately involved in the cover-up, bare minimum of that.
[01:25:08.344 --> 01:25:09.945]  That came out in court.
[01:25:09.945 --> 01:25:12.708]  Running fast and furious to blame the Second Amendment.
[01:25:12.708 --> 01:25:14.429]  So they're prime suspects.
[01:25:14.429 --> 01:25:16.291]  That's why I'm going with this.
[01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:18.653]  And we need to be able to turn this around.
[01:25:18.653 --> 01:25:25.499]  Why do you, I mean, going over your source, did they say, because the quote is going hot,
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:30.644]  It's going hot, which in military terms, for those that don't know, means into a hot war.
[01:25:30.644 --> 01:25:36.930]  I mean, it's about to, all hell's about to break loose to basically break it down.
[01:25:36.930 --> 01:25:39.212]  I mean, give us the data dump.
[01:25:39.212 --> 01:25:42.335]  Did your source say there's any way to stop it?
[01:25:42.335 --> 01:25:43.916]  How does it tie in with the sex scandal?
[01:25:43.916 --> 01:25:44.737]  I know that's happening.
[01:25:46.181 --> 01:25:57.550]  Yeah, and if I may, just briefly, Alex, not that you need my endorsement in any way, shape, or form, but let me just say this, so people understand where I'm coming from.
[01:25:57.550 --> 01:26:04.155]  I've got a lot of, I have 27 years in the investigative business, I've got a lot of law enforcement contacts.
[01:26:04.155 --> 01:26:12.621]  I used to hear what you were telling, what you were saying on the radio, and for instance, about Oklahoma City and other issues, and I would think
[01:26:12.981 --> 01:26:19.887]  You know what, there's no way, there's absolutely no way that Alex Jones can be correct on this.
[01:26:19.887 --> 01:26:36.620]  And I want to apologize to the people I've talked to and perhaps influenced into that way of thinking because, you know, when you take the blinders off and you start looking at this as a normal investigation, oh yeah, now we're finding
[01:26:37.581 --> 01:26:40.943]  Everything that you've been saying, everything that Steve Quayle's been saying.
[01:26:40.943 --> 01:26:43.445]  I used to fight him hard, tooth and nail.
[01:26:43.445 --> 01:26:46.027]  I was a bad student, you know, with him.
[01:26:46.027 --> 01:26:47.788]  But I gotta tell you something.
[01:26:47.788 --> 01:26:55.213]  For those listening out there who doubt in any way, shape, or form what you're saying and what you've been saying, don't doubt it.
[01:26:55.213 --> 01:26:57.715]  Because, look, we've done the investigation.
[01:26:57.715 --> 01:26:59.476]  You've done the investigation.
[01:26:59.476 --> 01:27:00.476]  And I gotta tell you something.
[01:27:00.476 --> 01:27:05.340]  It's not... I mean, it's everything you say it is, and it's everything that we're saying it is.
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:06.580]  Now, to answer your question,
[01:27:08.061 --> 01:27:22.890]  The source that I've got said, look, I cannot right now, for a lot of reasons, because he is a valuable informational and operational asset for the resistance, if you will.
[01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:30.415]  I cannot do anything overtly, come out to go to the press and say, here's what's happening.
[01:27:30.415 --> 01:27:33.898]  Because there's no documentation that's available.
[01:27:33.898 --> 01:27:41.985]  The way these people are setting this up, when I say these people, I'm referring to the communications between the White House and the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:27:42.705 --> 01:27:43.726]  They're not stupid.
[01:27:43.726 --> 01:27:45.347]  There's nothing on paper.
[01:27:45.347 --> 01:27:46.468]  There's nothing.
[01:27:46.468 --> 01:27:47.569]  They're not leaving a trail.
[01:27:47.569 --> 01:27:50.010]  They're not leaving any documentation.
[01:27:50.010 --> 01:27:51.191]  This is not 1972-73 Watergate.
[01:27:51.191 --> 01:27:52.852]  How does your source discover this?
[01:27:52.852 --> 01:27:53.633]  Did he say that?
[01:27:59.458 --> 01:28:14.171]  Yeah, initially by accident, being in the right place at the right time and overhearing something and then befriending a certain individual within the upper echelon of Homeland Security.
[01:28:18.374 --> 01:28:18.795]  We're good to go.
[01:28:47.874 --> 01:28:55.122]  And as you know, the feds are now trying to block the suit being public and block new documents and discovery which shows they're guilty of sin.
[01:28:55.122 --> 01:28:56.484]  Exactly.
[01:28:56.484 --> 01:28:59.126]  Can you tell us what your source said the sexual stuff is?
[01:28:59.861 --> 01:29:11.287]  Well, you know, it's, uh, the, uh, there's different levels, but one of, where it affects my source and one of the... Yeah, don't name names, but just one type of stuff.
[01:29:11.287 --> 01:29:12.347]  Right.
[01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:19.330]  You're talking about, um, uh, uh, promotions based on, uh, sexual performance.
[01:29:19.330 --> 01:29:23.432]  You're talking about promotions based on, and access.
[01:29:23.432 --> 01:29:24.633]  This is a... Well, that's admitted.
[01:29:24.633 --> 01:29:26.454]  I mean, they call them in and say perform.
[01:29:27.196 --> 01:29:31.700]  Okay, yeah, well, I'm not exactly certain what is open source and what's not.
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:32.240]  Well, stay there.
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.502]  Let's come back and talk about it on the other side.
[01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:40.928]  And then get into this false flag, what type of false flag it could be, what we should look for.
[01:29:40.928 --> 01:29:43.890]  But we know they tried to provocateur race riots with the Trayvon Martin thing.
[01:29:43.890 --> 01:29:45.812]  I mean, they had the Justice Department in there.
[01:29:45.812 --> 01:29:46.472]  That came out.
[01:29:46.472 --> 01:29:49.034]  So they're going to try to pull something, folks.
[01:29:49.034 --> 01:29:50.075]  We're trying to stop it.
[01:29:50.075 --> 01:29:51.456]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.456 --> 01:29:52.958]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.992 --> 01:29:56.671]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.757 --> 01:30:10.864]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[01:30:10.864 --> 01:30:14.947]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[01:30:14.947 --> 01:30:22.254]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[01:30:22.254 --> 01:30:24.736]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:30:25.256 --> 01:30:30.099]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[01:30:30.099 --> 01:30:36.042]  Buy the 1 to 2 month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:30:36.042 --> 01:30:41.465]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[01:30:41.465 --> 01:30:43.446]  This is an amazing deal.
[01:30:43.446 --> 01:30:48.669]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way Real Soap makes you feel.
[01:30:48.669 --> 01:30:51.811]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call
[01:30:52.051 --> 01:30:53.174]  Call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:06.705]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:31:06.705 --> 01:31:09.668]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:31:09.668 --> 01:31:15.052]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:31:15.052 --> 01:31:20.037]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:31:20.037 --> 01:31:27.323]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[01:31:27.663 --> 01:31:31.525]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[01:31:31.525 --> 01:31:33.326]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:31:33.326 --> 01:31:37.328]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[01:31:37.328 --> 01:31:40.249]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:31:40.249 --> 01:31:43.031]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today.
[01:31:43.031 --> 01:31:47.593]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:31:47.593 --> 01:31:48.253]  Don't wait!
[01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:50.134]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:31:50.134 --> 01:31:50.274]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:57.338 --> 01:32:07.203]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:32:07.203 --> 01:32:12.786]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:32:12.786 --> 01:32:15.028]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:32:15.028 --> 01:32:22.512]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:32:23.012 --> 01:32:26.814]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[01:32:26.814 --> 01:32:31.175]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:32:31.175 --> 01:32:38.038]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[01:32:38.038 --> 01:32:41.079]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:32:41.079 --> 01:32:44.180]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:47.922]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[01:32:47.922 --> 01:32:50.403]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:32:50.943 --> 01:32:56.025]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:32:56.025 --> 01:33:09.330]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:33:09.330 --> 01:33:15.592]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.669 --> 01:33:21.171]  We're good to go.
[01:33:48.692 --> 01:33:50.914]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:50.914 --> 01:33:51.475]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:51.475 --> 01:33:52.616]  Central, we're here live.
[01:33:52.616 --> 01:33:56.679]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:56.679 --> 01:34:05.828]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv where we're streaming video right now.
[01:34:07.213 --> 01:34:11.795]  Now I want to go back to our guest here in just a moment.
[01:34:11.795 --> 01:34:15.657]  Don't ever forget that this broadcast is listener supported.
[01:34:15.657 --> 01:34:30.763]  We're not like George Soros and MSNBC that get banker bailout money or MSNBC that gets a half billion bucks in job stimulus money to give Rachel Maddow a raise so she can say that your family's bad and your guns are bad and freedom's bad and tyranny's good.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:33.644]  We're supported by you.
[01:34:33.644 --> 01:34:34.285]  And I've done it.
[01:34:34.285 --> 01:34:36.129]  I've hired the six new reporters.
[01:34:36.129 --> 01:34:36.991]  Four of them are here now.
[01:34:36.991 --> 01:34:39.416]  Two more are coming in the next few weeks.
[01:34:39.416 --> 01:34:40.819]  Linda West and...
[01:34:42.435 --> 01:34:54.324]  Others, Mr. Knight, and we are busting our hind ends to expand the amount of documentaries, the amount of reports, the amount of research, the nightly news, the newspaper.
[01:34:54.324 --> 01:34:56.686]  I've hired the seven people for that.
[01:34:56.686 --> 01:35:01.030]  I mean, we are off to the races here, putting the capital you give us in.
[01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:05.914]  But to take the risk of expanding, we need more and more coal to come in so we can put it
[01:35:06.574 --> 01:35:07.654]  I don't know.
[01:35:26.579 --> 01:35:32.100]  And you can find ProPure water filters, the best gravity-fed filters, at 10% below anybody else's price.
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:33.440]  You cannot find a lower price.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.501]  We already had the lowest price.
[01:35:34.501 --> 01:35:35.701]  We're the number one seller.
[01:35:35.701 --> 01:35:38.701]  I just say 10% off with the promo code WATER at checkout.
[01:35:38.701 --> 01:35:47.343]  You can also call 888-253-3139 if you want to order ProPure or LifeStraw or any of the other products we carry.
[01:35:47.343 --> 01:35:50.204]  Everything I personally have researched and I use myself.
[01:35:50.204 --> 01:35:50.624]  Again, that's
[01:35:51.664 --> 01:36:03.193]  888-253-3139 or InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsShop.com or link through at the little shopping link at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:36:03.193 --> 01:36:08.898]  Now, that said, we also carry all the best books, videos, materials.
[01:36:08.898 --> 01:36:10.019]  I don't like Obama.
[01:36:10.019 --> 01:36:18.486]  I'm not knocking 2016, but I sent reporters last night to cover it, David Ortiz and Rob Jacobson, and they said basically,
[01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:23.668]  You know, it's that Obama is going to overthrow us with the Muslims.
[01:36:23.668 --> 01:36:25.609]  I used to not think that was a joke.
[01:36:25.609 --> 01:36:27.409]  Maybe they're running Al-Qaeda.
[01:36:27.409 --> 01:36:28.970]  I guess an Al-Qaeda attacks us.
[01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:30.370]  They use that to take our rights away.
[01:36:30.370 --> 01:36:33.631]  But the point is, it's just kind of neo-confair.
[01:36:33.631 --> 01:36:39.173]  We're seeing explosive sales of the Obama deception right now because of the interest of just that film alone.
[01:36:39.173 --> 01:36:41.034]  That's available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:36:41.994 --> 01:36:46.018]  And we've got nullification about 10th Amendment states rights as a solution to tyranny.
[01:36:46.018 --> 01:36:49.101]  Behold the Pale Horse, the new film with Charlie Daniels.
[01:36:49.101 --> 01:36:51.743]  We've got why in the world are they spraying with chemtrails.
[01:36:51.743 --> 01:36:53.845]  Dreams of my real father about Obama.
[01:36:53.845 --> 01:36:55.787]  The greater good exposing deadly vaccines.
[01:36:55.787 --> 01:36:56.668]  Pharmageddon.
[01:36:56.668 --> 01:36:58.870]  The attacks on farms.
[01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:59.931]  The Toronto hearings on 9-11.
[01:37:01.312 --> 01:37:04.113]  Indoctrination about the brainwashing in schools.
[01:37:04.113 --> 01:37:07.054]  A noble lie about the staged terror of Oklahoma City.
[01:37:07.054 --> 01:37:08.835]  Scientists under attack on GMO.
[01:37:08.835 --> 01:37:10.456]  The American Dream film.
[01:37:10.456 --> 01:37:13.657]  It's all available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:13.657 --> 01:37:15.158]  And with that, I am done.
[01:37:15.158 --> 01:37:19.500]  Again, get the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:20.060]  Just sign up.
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:24.762]  We'll send you the free magazine, e-version, the daily updates, everything right there on the site.
[01:37:25.622 --> 01:37:32.851]  Now, I'm going to try to shut up now ahead of Steve Quayle coming on because I brought up some of my questions, but we're not just in a vacuum saying Obama's going to stage stuff.
[01:37:32.851 --> 01:37:40.220]  And I want to get back into what your source said, every little piece of data, without you and I going back and forth with provisos here with our guest.
[01:37:41.257 --> 01:37:43.599]  Who I believe, you know, has this source.
[01:37:43.599 --> 01:37:45.360]  You've put out a lot of good info in the past.
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:48.162]  This is what my sources are saying, but more vague.
[01:37:48.162 --> 01:37:53.305]  Just we're told, get ready for all, you know, what to break loose in late October, early November.
[01:37:53.305 --> 01:37:58.169]  Again, and if we're successful in backing off, they'll say, you said this was going to happen.
[01:37:58.169 --> 01:37:59.810]  I'm not saying that was going to happen.
[01:38:01.678 --> 01:38:04.642]  I'm saying this is what our sources are saying.
[01:38:04.642 --> 01:38:13.674]  Our source on the Olympics was confirmed to be a famous TV producer who did infiltrate, and they later admitted it was a security disaster, and they were told something was going to happen.
[01:38:13.674 --> 01:38:15.397]  But they do this quite often.
[01:38:15.397 --> 01:38:16.458]  My issue is...
[01:38:17.119 --> 01:38:19.100]  Did we back it off or was it a PSYOP?
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:37.448]  I don't know, but they're gearing up a billion point, 400 million bullets, 1 billion, 400 million bullets, armored checkpoints, tanks driving around everywhere, giant black armored vehicles everywhere, surveillance going in, all sorts of federalization, police being given federal ID cards.
[01:38:37.448 --> 01:38:41.289]  They're saying they're getting ready for financial collapse in the Washington Post and Fox News.
[01:38:41.289 --> 01:38:42.370]  I mean, all this is there.
[01:38:43.507 --> 01:38:50.913]  And so I'm saying we better be concerned because the stars are aligning with the Iran situation.
[01:38:50.913 --> 01:38:53.996]  Israel's saying they may attack in October or November.
[01:38:53.996 --> 01:38:57.099]  We've got the election, so they love October surprises.
[01:38:57.099 --> 01:39:04.145]  We've got all these things lining up and my gut is saying danger Will Robinson.
[01:39:04.645 --> 01:39:07.347]  You know, Robbie the Robot, whenever something's approaching.
[01:39:07.347 --> 01:39:09.808]  There is something approaching from the Southwest.
[01:39:09.808 --> 01:39:13.271]  I mean, I'm saying this is the season of it.
[01:39:13.271 --> 01:39:25.079]  And I see the preparation, the hyping, the pushing, the conservatives, the libertarians, the talk show hosts like Alex Jones and Matt Drudge and Glenn Beck.
[01:39:25.079 --> 01:39:27.480]  And they're going to cause violence.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:30.442]  They're planning an overthrow.
[01:39:30.442 --> 01:39:32.764]  And then you've got a group that's been caught doing false flags.
[01:39:32.764 --> 01:39:34.265]  Let's not forget they did Fast and Furious.
[01:39:35.205 --> 01:39:41.470]  We would be insane with sources like the one our guest has to not be concerned.
[01:39:41.470 --> 01:39:43.291]  So I want you to continue here, Doug Hagman.
[01:39:43.291 --> 01:39:51.938]  I want to give out your website as well, HomelandSecurityUS.com, where you break down what's really happening with Homeland Security.
[01:39:51.938 --> 01:39:54.199]  HomelandSecurityUS.com.
[01:39:54.199 --> 01:39:58.102]  You've got the floor for the next 20 minutes ahead of Steve Quayle joining us.
[01:39:59.563 --> 01:40:07.530]  A. Why do you think they're so bold in talking about how false flags will help them in front of us on TV like we don't hear them?
[01:40:07.530 --> 01:40:09.052]  What is that?
[01:40:09.052 --> 01:40:11.674]  Or is that just pure criminal hubris?
[01:40:11.674 --> 01:40:13.035]  And then you've got the floor.
[01:40:13.035 --> 01:40:14.697]  Tell me everything your source said.
[01:40:15.618 --> 01:40:33.909]  Well, okay, starting from what you just said, Alex, you know, the boldness, that bothered me a lot because when I deal with the criminal element, they're very covert, they're quiet, the conspiracies are underneath, you know, under the cloak of darkness.
[01:40:33.909 --> 01:40:37.491]  Why do we, why are we hearing about this so openly?
[01:40:37.491 --> 01:40:40.593]  And I think one of the reasons is that
[01:40:42.054 --> 01:40:45.858]  People don't get it, or there's this normalcy bias.
[01:40:45.858 --> 01:40:49.001]  There's this tendency for people not to believe it.
[01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:51.984]  And I asked, look, I asked my sources too.
[01:40:51.984 --> 01:40:54.506]  I said, number one, why, you know, why now?
[01:40:54.506 --> 01:40:58.070]  Why can't you, for example, go public?
[01:40:58.070 --> 01:41:01.193]  And he came back and said, well, what do you think I'm doing?
[01:41:02.314 --> 01:41:03.354]  I am going public.
[01:41:03.354 --> 01:41:04.155]  I am telling you.
[01:41:04.155 --> 01:41:05.996]  I'm trying to get the word out.
[01:41:05.996 --> 01:41:10.379]  You know, it's not like I can go down to the New York Times and they're going to print this.
[01:41:10.379 --> 01:41:15.041]  We have to use people like yourself, and of course I've known this person for a long time.
[01:41:15.041 --> 01:41:21.866]  But that said, I do believe that it's out in the open because
[01:41:23.647 --> 01:41:25.948]  It's almost as if no one really cares.
[01:41:25.948 --> 01:41:28.390]  Or they don't believe it.
[01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:34.293]  Or even if it does happen, they won't believe the origin of it.
[01:41:34.293 --> 01:41:36.855]  Now, what is it?
[01:41:36.855 --> 01:41:38.876]  What are we talking about, for example?
[01:41:38.876 --> 01:41:42.879]  And I ask my source, okay, what should we be looking for?
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:59.387]  And he said, frankly, you know, I'm not sure, because the talk among the high-level people that he has access to has been pretty vague, purposely vague.
[01:41:59.387 --> 01:42:06.630]  Now, as I understand it, as he understands it, there are a couple of different potential possibilities.
[01:42:06.630 --> 01:42:10.892]  When he said, all right, it's going hot, and those were his words.
[01:42:12.613 --> 01:42:14.334]  And he was very adamant about this.
[01:42:14.334 --> 01:42:25.016]  He said, there has been approval from the White House sources, from the White House people, to go ahead with a plan.
[01:42:25.016 --> 01:42:29.977]  Whether it's Plan A, it could be a racially triggered event.
[01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:32.558]  Plan B, an economic triggered event.
[01:42:33.559 --> 01:42:38.824]  Or Plan C. Staging, for example.
[01:42:38.824 --> 01:42:40.266]  Riots in different cities.
[01:42:40.266 --> 01:42:42.768]  They've got the personnel to do this, too.
[01:42:42.768 --> 01:42:43.910]  That was the other thing.
[01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:50.937]  And I'm giving you information that I withheld from any written article.
[01:42:50.937 --> 01:42:52.719]  Because I knew I was going to be doing some interviews.
[01:42:53.980 --> 01:43:16.492]  Look, they've got the people to engage in provocative type of activities to, we'll say, to storm a county courthouse, to storm a federal building in opposition or because of some protest or whatever, or even to storm facilities in Washington.
[01:43:16.492 --> 01:43:19.193]  Remember that shooting at the White House here not too long ago.
[01:43:21.675 --> 01:43:26.217]  My source said one person in particular, Ms.
[01:43:26.217 --> 01:43:30.500]  Jarrett, was very upset that that was not played up better in the media.
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:37.404]  Because here it is, most likely a white gun owner shooting at the house of a black president.
[01:43:37.404 --> 01:43:39.445]  Obama wasn't even in the White House.
[01:43:39.445 --> 01:43:42.326]  Again, they're trying to make this a racial issue.
[01:43:44.007 --> 01:44:03.973]  And so it, the it, the trigger event, the actual event that's being talked about, it's rather vague, but you know, look, it's going to be something that's going, the intent here, according to my source, and I took copious notes when I spoke to him on a couple of different occasions.
[01:44:05.153 --> 01:44:30.332]  The intent is to really galvanize that chasm, that difference between the races or the classes, whatever it might be, to make sure that there is white versus black or white versus, you know, whoever, okay?
[01:44:30.332 --> 01:44:33.214]  Where the gun-owning Christian
[01:44:34.535 --> 01:44:50.414]  Pro-Constitutionalist, they are going to, everything that you pointed out in the MIAC report, the returning veterans, you know, that threat, there's going to be that common threat of that threat involved in whatever stage of event there is.
[01:44:51.375 --> 01:44:58.202]  And, again, this does fit and comport with, as you've stated in the past, the New World Order agenda.
[01:44:58.202 --> 01:45:01.605]  And I asked my source this as well.
[01:45:01.605 --> 01:45:03.507]  I said, is Obama behind this?
[01:45:03.507 --> 01:45:06.210]  I mean, is this just Obama?
[01:45:06.210 --> 01:45:10.234]  And, you know, he said, I don't think so.
[01:45:10.234 --> 01:45:15.218]  He said, I don't think so because, again, the information that he's got
[01:45:16.139 --> 01:45:16.739]  I don't know.
[01:45:31.644 --> 01:45:31.785]  Sure.
[01:45:31.785 --> 01:45:34.766]  I mean, I can imagine they're all wondering, are we still going to be here?
[01:45:53.178 --> 01:45:59.302]  And they say, yeah, don't worry, there's going to be a crisis very soon, and we're going ahead with it.
[01:45:59.302 --> 01:46:08.467]  And that's basically what your source said, because they're on Chris Matthews, not once but twice, saying we need a big catalyzing event to reconnect, another show a year ago.
[01:46:08.467 --> 01:46:12.970]  We need a mass shooting to reconnect, and it's a White House official saying this on the show.
[01:46:14.150 --> 01:46:24.596]  We see the fundraising memos, the Tides Foundation letters, saying there's going to be an event and it's going to be blamed on, you know, talk radio.
[01:46:24.596 --> 01:46:25.336]  We see them.
[01:46:25.336 --> 01:46:30.659]  We see Bill Clinton telling USA Today, I owe my re-election to Oklahoma City.
[01:46:30.659 --> 01:46:31.540]  It brought us together.
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:36.042]  I mean, we know that Robert Shapiro, in fact, guys, type this in.
[01:46:36.042 --> 01:46:36.803]  Robert Shapiro.
[01:46:38.369 --> 01:46:40.631]  Says only terror attack will save Obama.
[01:46:40.631 --> 01:46:42.592]  Show the Financial Times of London on screen.
[01:46:42.592 --> 01:46:44.093]  I don't want to just be saying this.
[01:46:44.093 --> 01:46:46.574]  I know we've shown it hundreds of times, but we haven't shown it today.
[01:46:46.574 --> 01:46:53.859]  I want to show people where he says, barring, this is a quote, a new Oklahoma City or 9-11, the president is not going to get reelected.
[01:46:53.859 --> 01:46:57.120]  I mean, why are they saying this publicly?
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:02.484]  I mean, it's like they're saying, we need it, we need it, we need it, as if we're dumb and don't see this.
[01:47:03.988 --> 01:47:23.267]  Yeah, you know, and this is one thing too, I've talked at length with the author Marinka Peshman, author of The Whistleblower, and in fact she's going to be on our program tonight, but I've talked with her and she said people have to understand the Clintons, number one, have never left power, have never left the Washington power structure.
[01:47:23.687 --> 01:47:29.109]  And number two, the Clintons are interwoven within the Obama power structure.
[01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:51.855]  They're advising Obama, and how well that they use the Oklahoma City tragedy, the bombing there, how well that they put the blame on talk show hosts, radio talk show hosts, the hatred of conservatives, not even conservatives, but the hatred of those who would dare expose their tactics.
[01:47:53.435 --> 01:47:59.120]  This is where the Obama administration is getting their information from.
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:02.743]  And I've got to tell you, it's big.
[01:48:02.743 --> 01:48:04.945]  I mean, the influence is huge.
[01:48:04.945 --> 01:48:20.738]  But when you come down to the logistics of such an operation here, you know, once again, we were striving together to try to figure out if we don't have, we've got pages of their playbook.
[01:48:21.998 --> 01:48:30.500]  We've got their operational playbook, but the plays themselves, we only have bits and pieces of the plays.
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:40.881]  We know, for example, again, you know, it's going to be either racial or economic in terms of a trigger event.
[01:48:40.881 --> 01:48:48.683]  And I'm trying to be as precise as possible, but, you know, just operating off of the information that we have.
[01:48:50.163 --> 01:48:54.810]  It's something that, again, my source says, look, there is something here.
[01:48:54.810 --> 01:48:56.593]  We've heard the discussions.
[01:48:56.593 --> 01:48:57.594]  He's heard the discussions.
[01:48:57.594 --> 01:49:04.684]  He's heard the end of the meeting where they said, okay, it's a go.
[01:49:04.684 --> 01:49:05.626]  It's going to go hot.
[01:49:06.607 --> 01:49:14.530]  But beyond that, in terms of when exactly, I wish I could say it would be October 10th or 12th.
[01:49:14.530 --> 01:49:19.172]  I wish I could say it would be an attempted whatever.
[01:49:19.172 --> 01:49:19.652]  I can't.
[01:49:19.652 --> 01:49:23.073]  I don't have that information, nor does he.
[01:49:23.073 --> 01:49:25.174]  Now, on the other hand, I will say this.
[01:49:26.348 --> 01:49:38.971]  He is working to mitigate, and you pointed this out, and I think this is important for people really to understand, and Steve Quayle, by the way, who's coming on, his sources are saying the very same thing.
[01:49:38.971 --> 01:49:54.414]  Your sources are saying, my sources are saying, of course my DHS source is saying, look, we are working, there are some people here are working to stop this, to throw a monkey wrench into this, into the workings.
[01:49:55.234 --> 01:50:06.117]  I know that we don't have a whole lot of information, but we do know the operational guidelines and operational tactics of DHS.
[01:50:06.117 --> 01:50:10.098]  That said, we know what we can possibly do when the time comes.
[01:50:10.098 --> 01:50:16.720]  We'll know it when we see it, and we're going to try to act accordingly to mitigate whatever it might be.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:20.501]  So there is hope, and as you said, if nothing happens,
[01:50:21.101 --> 01:50:26.465]  Well, people can say, wait, was Doug Hagman, he's a loony toot.
[01:50:26.465 --> 01:50:38.813]  Well, okay, you know, consider over the last eight years, or even the last- No, I hear you, we gotta go to break, but if it does happen, then they'll try to spend it as well, but at least you did what you needed to.
[01:50:38.813 --> 01:50:50.220]  The Financial Times of London article was Obama Faces Growing Credibility Crisis, and in it, Robert Shapiro, White House advisor, is quoted as saying, the stuff about a new Oklahoma City 9-11,
[01:50:52.063 --> 01:50:54.708]  There's also videos on the news breaking it down.
[01:50:54.708 --> 01:50:56.611]  Just type that in and you will get it.
[01:50:56.611 --> 01:51:00.037]  And Paul Watson also wrote an article about it with the quotes in that.
[01:51:02.461 --> 01:51:08.306]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:51:08.306 --> 01:51:13.750]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:15.952]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:51:15.952 --> 01:51:23.238]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:51:23.738 --> 01:51:27.440]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:31.683]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:51:31.683 --> 01:51:38.367]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[01:51:38.367 --> 01:51:41.328]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:51:41.328 --> 01:51:44.350]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:47.992]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[01:51:47.992 --> 01:51:50.414]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:51:50.934 --> 01:51:55.917]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:51:55.917 --> 01:51:57.618]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:52:00.632 --> 01:52:03.795]  My name is Frank Bates, and I've got some urgent news for you.
[01:52:03.795 --> 01:52:08.258]  Did you know that a solar storm in 1989 caused an enormous blackout in Quebec?
[01:52:08.258 --> 01:52:09.960]  Here's the really bad news.
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:16.505]  Experts are predicting that solar storms will get really severe over the next year, and our electric grid is extremely vulnerable.
[01:52:16.505 --> 01:52:25.212]  In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported that we could soon face blackouts lasting weeks or months, leaving major parts of the USA temporarily uninhabitable.
[01:52:25.692 --> 01:52:27.873]  Are you prepared for this coming crisis?

[01:54:01.397 --> 01:54:04.158]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:54:04.158 --> 01:54:06.939]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:08.476 --> 01:54:30.212]  Alright, here is one example of more than nine, I was counting them up during the break, that I could just find during the break, nine TV shows, letters, public statements, Obama faces growing credibility crisis, Robert Shapiro quoted Financial Times of London, here's the quote, this is one of nine times.
[01:54:30.212 --> 01:54:32.774]  Every time I search this I find new ones I didn't know about.
[01:54:33.214 --> 01:54:40.179]  The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, says Rob Shapiro, another former Clinton official and supporter of Obama.
[01:54:40.179 --> 01:54:41.360]  Yeah, he's an advisor.
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:47.385]  He has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence.
[01:54:47.385 --> 01:54:51.448]  And short of a 9-11 event or in Oklahoma City, I can't think of how he can do that.
[01:54:52.375 --> 01:54:56.516]  Now, they go further, other advisors, saying they're going to blame it on us.
[01:54:56.516 --> 01:54:58.016]  And we played those clips in the last hour.
[01:54:58.016 --> 01:55:02.417]  And we're talking right now to the head of the Northeast Intelligence Network, Doug Hagman.
[01:55:02.417 --> 01:55:05.038]  He's on with us right now.
[01:55:05.038 --> 01:55:09.619]  Doug, you got cut off because these are hard breaks when they're, you know, the satellite's fired a certain time.
[01:55:09.619 --> 01:55:15.080]  Last time I had Salente on, people made a, not Salente, but others made a fake controversy that he was starting to get into a subject.
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:16.081]  And I go, oh, got to go to break.
[01:55:16.081 --> 01:55:17.381]  I mean, they're, they're hard-coded.
[01:55:17.901 --> 01:55:26.369]  You know, we come in at 8 after, go out at 20 after, go out at 30 after, come in at 33, go out at 50, 1, you know, come back and show.
[01:55:26.369 --> 01:55:30.653]  Here we are, we got about 6 minutes right now, 5 minutes right now, and we're going to break at the end of the hour.
[01:55:30.653 --> 01:55:31.654]  That's a conspiracy too.
[01:55:31.654 --> 01:55:33.896]  No, no, this is the real conspiracy what's happening.
[01:55:33.896 --> 01:55:38.800]  You were trying to talk about how, hey, if it doesn't happen, they can say, oh, Doug Hagman's wrong.
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:41.483]  You didn't get to finish, so restate what you were trying to say, that thought.
[01:55:41.997 --> 01:56:03.885]  Well, just to expand upon what you said earlier, and I think this is so important, I think really people have to understand this, is that, you know, the more sunshine, the more disinfectant we can pour on these plans, and whatever we can shine, whatever light we can shine on these plans,
[01:56:05.305 --> 01:56:11.708]  It helps to mitigate, to offset, and to upset their plans.
[01:56:11.708 --> 01:56:20.533]  There's a reason Homeland Security in a four-year document is spying on InfoWars.com and this show, and they're worried about our reports about false flags.
[01:56:20.533 --> 01:56:22.954]  Isn't that interesting that they're really looking at that?
[01:56:24.484 --> 01:56:31.507]  You know, when I saw that, Alex, I looked at that and I thought, wow, you know, really, what's behind this?
[01:56:31.507 --> 01:56:33.789]  What would be their motivation?
[01:56:33.789 --> 01:56:51.477]  And again, now you were named specifically, I believe when we talked before, you were named as a subject of InfoWars, Prison Planet, Alex Jones, your entire enterprise was named as a surveillance subject, a subject of surveillance.
[01:56:51.937 --> 01:56:57.042]  And it said basically that I'm kind of a terrorist, and I'm an extremist, and I'm dangerous.
[01:56:57.042 --> 01:56:57.622]  Yeah.
[01:56:57.622 --> 01:56:58.183]  Yeah.
[01:56:58.183 --> 01:56:59.824]  And I wondered why.
[01:56:59.824 --> 01:57:02.046]  I mean, I was thinking, well, wait a minute.
[01:57:02.046 --> 01:57:04.869]  Is it that?
[01:57:04.869 --> 01:57:05.789]  Exactly why?
[01:57:05.789 --> 01:57:07.111]  What are we talking about here?
[01:57:07.791 --> 01:57:11.653]  And Alex, I think that you're right on the money with this.
[01:57:11.653 --> 01:57:21.319]  I do believe that you're getting very close when you talk about false flags and the government involvement in this.
[01:57:21.319 --> 01:57:26.282]  Because people like me, just a few years ago, man, I thought it was nuts.
[01:57:26.282 --> 01:57:27.183]  I didn't believe this.
[01:57:27.183 --> 01:57:30.025]  But now, again, you're convincing a lot of people.
[01:57:30.025 --> 01:57:30.965]  Well, it's not just me, though.
[01:57:30.965 --> 01:57:32.766]  It's the facts coming out.
[01:57:32.766 --> 01:57:36.849]  How bad does it hurt the globalists that they're getting caught in things like Fast and Furious?
[01:57:37.759 --> 01:57:41.761]  Oh, look, it's a game changer.
[01:57:41.761 --> 01:57:46.623]  But you also see, too, with Fast and Furious, you've got a U.S.
[01:57:46.623 --> 01:57:52.826]  attorney that won't pursue the criminal contempt and civil contempt charges against Holder.
[01:57:53.206 --> 01:57:55.467]  You know, what do you do?
[01:57:55.467 --> 01:57:58.449]  And see, this is another thing that my source did tell me.
[01:57:58.449 --> 01:58:00.830]  They've got the perfect arrangement right now.
[01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:10.815]  They've got the guy in the Justice Department, Eric Holder, on their side, a red diaper baby, right along with Obama and Jared and all these people.
[01:58:10.815 --> 01:58:12.836]  So, this is the perfect time.
[01:58:15.798 --> 01:58:19.921]  Well, yeah, that's the word from people I know that are really well-connected who know Romney's bad news.
[01:58:19.921 --> 01:58:23.264]  They say, look, at least it rearranges the chairs.
[01:58:23.264 --> 01:58:25.486]  Obama's got his criminal syndicate in there.
[01:58:25.486 --> 01:58:30.490]  If he gets back in, he's never leaving because he won't be facing re-election.
[01:58:30.490 --> 01:58:33.692]  It takes these presidents time to get their power structure in.
[01:58:33.692 --> 01:58:38.756]  We need to reshuffle the deck just to get the whole system confused.
[01:58:41.383 --> 01:58:44.916]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:00:05.526 --> 02:00:10.350]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:11.951]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.951 --> 02:00:13.493]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.493 --> 02:00:17.676]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.676 --> 02:00:21.740]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.771 --> 02:00:37.836]  Alright, Steve Quayle's coming up in the next segment, finishing up with Doug Hagman from the Northeast Intelligence Network, private investigator.
[02:00:37.836 --> 02:00:42.679]  And you can visit his website, HomelandSecurityUS.com, HomelandSecurityUS.com.
[02:00:42.679 --> 02:00:45.280]  Got about five minutes left here, Doug.
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:48.722]  We were just getting into the fact that, yeah, Fast and Furious is a game changer.
[02:00:48.722 --> 02:00:51.544]  The documents came out, they did it, to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:00:51.544 --> 02:00:53.385]  That's even on CBS News.
[02:00:53.385 --> 02:00:54.846]  So it is a game changer, but
[02:00:55.666 --> 02:00:57.889]  Now, nothing can even be done.
[02:00:57.889 --> 02:01:00.391]  They're just sitting there.
[02:01:00.391 --> 02:01:02.273]  That's why they'll probably even have election fraud.
[02:01:02.273 --> 02:01:08.060]  Not that I think Romney's good, but I don't think, I mean, he's more of a globalist with white gloves on.
[02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:15.167]  With Obama, you're dealing with like, you know, absolute Chicago mafia type stuff where they are nasty, nasty, nasty.
[02:01:15.948 --> 02:01:20.152]  And again, I'm not saying stuff won't get even more hellish with Romney, but probably will.
[02:01:20.152 --> 02:01:22.394]  But I don't, I don't see Obama going anywhere.
[02:01:22.394 --> 02:01:24.276]  I mean, is that what your source is getting at?
[02:01:24.276 --> 02:01:26.578]  Is they're going to pull some chicanery?
[02:01:26.578 --> 02:01:27.439]  Exactly.
[02:01:27.439 --> 02:01:29.801]  And that's, boy, that is so key, Alex.
[02:01:29.801 --> 02:01:33.004]  I'm glad you mentioned that because what my source said
[02:01:33.925 --> 02:01:57.742]  There are too many people, and I'm looking at my notes here almost trying to quote him, there are too many people who want a seat and are guaranteed a seat at the Obama table, that if he loses, they would lose that seat, that they obviously want to work overtime to ensure that Obama does not
[02:01:59.003 --> 02:02:01.785]  It remains in the White House, I should say.
[02:02:01.785 --> 02:02:03.246]  That's the key.
[02:02:03.246 --> 02:02:04.987]  That's the objective here.
[02:02:04.987 --> 02:02:16.817]  We do know, of course, that you've got the different side of the coin, that being Mitt Romney, ultimately answering to the same higher powers.
[02:02:16.817 --> 02:02:23.803]  But with Obama, you've got, look at it this way, you've got a straight interstate highway going right to the objective.
[02:02:24.443 --> 02:02:34.385]  With Romney, you might have a little detour and kind of a more scenic route to the same... A more scenic route to hell!
[02:02:34.385 --> 02:02:35.206]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:02:35.206 --> 02:02:45.868]  You know, with Obama, you've got the Holder Justice Department that's not going to change if Obama stays.
[02:02:45.868 --> 02:02:48.849]  And you've got all of these people.
[02:02:49.829 --> 02:02:54.713]  With the, again, the anti-Second Amendment people.
[02:02:54.713 --> 02:03:05.760]  And as you mentioned before, and people have to understand, the amount of ammunition, just to put this in perspective, could fill 63 Olympic-sized swimming pools.
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:08.902]  This is just under the Obama administration.
[02:03:08.902 --> 02:03:13.245]  63 sized Olympic swimming pools.
[02:03:13.245 --> 02:03:15.086]  Five, on average, five bullets per person.
[02:03:15.086 --> 02:03:17.748]  This is more than, exactly, five bullets per person.
[02:03:18.268 --> 02:03:18.568]  Right.
[02:03:18.568 --> 02:03:20.350]  So, something is up.
[02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:22.833]  I mean, obviously something is up.
[02:03:22.833 --> 02:03:26.517]  Now, the argument on the other side is, well, they've always ordered ammunition.
[02:03:26.517 --> 02:03:28.699]  No, they haven't.
[02:03:28.699 --> 02:03:30.080]  This shot up after 2004.
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:34.865]  Yeah, they've never even ordered, I looked it up, they've never ordered 10% of this in a year.
[02:03:34.865 --> 02:03:35.346]  Exactly.
[02:03:35.626 --> 02:03:45.773]  So, you know, and again, you know, Steve Quayle, his sources, exactly the same information, or relatively the same information, different sources, but the same.
[02:03:45.773 --> 02:03:54.819]  We've had police call up that I later talked to, I confirm, where officers breaking down crying on air because they've been told martial law in September.
[02:03:54.819 --> 02:04:01.323]  Now, again, that doesn't mean it's going to happen, but they're talking about calling in the military, calling in airstrikes on citizens.
[02:04:01.323 --> 02:04:02.103]  I mean, what are they?
[02:04:03.124 --> 02:04:04.085]  Man, I'm freaked out.
[02:04:04.085 --> 02:04:06.788]  I mean, I hope there's some way to turn this around.
[02:04:06.788 --> 02:04:09.291]  In closing, did your source think this could be turned around?
[02:04:09.291 --> 02:04:12.054]  Obviously, kind of in a way, he came to you, so he wants it to get out there.
[02:04:12.054 --> 02:04:20.904]  Yeah, and he said the only way, in his mind, the only way that this could be turned around is through extensive exposure.
[02:04:20.904 --> 02:04:24.348]  On the other hand, there are some patriots within the federal government.
[02:04:24.748 --> 02:04:24.908]  Yes.
[02:04:43.923 --> 02:04:51.653]  Steve Quayle up, but I know he's got some announcements to make, but I want to hold you there because I want to ask Steve if he's got any questions or comments for you.
[02:04:51.653 --> 02:04:53.456]  You're very polite to stay with us.
[02:04:53.456 --> 02:04:56.440]  Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com coming up.
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:59.023]  Boy, he sounded wild 15 years ago talking about this stuff.
[02:04:59.023 --> 02:04:59.564]  Now it's happening.
[02:05:00.965 --> 02:05:06.468]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:05:06.468 --> 02:05:08.889]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:05:08.889 --> 02:05:17.994]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:17.994 --> 02:05:21.435]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:05:21.435 --> 02:05:23.116]  There's no priming required.
[02:05:23.116 --> 02:05:25.397]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[02:05:25.397 --> 02:05:27.899]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:05:28.959 --> 02:05:30.480]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.901]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:05:31.901 --> 02:05:35.064]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:05:35.064 --> 02:05:38.447]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:05:38.447 --> 02:05:40.368]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[02:05:40.368 --> 02:05:42.590]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:05:42.590 --> 02:05:45.332]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:05:45.332 --> 02:05:46.914]  It's what my family uses.
[02:05:46.914 --> 02:05:50.216]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:05:50.216 --> 02:05:55.481]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[02:05:56.021 --> 02:05:59.664]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:05:59.664 --> 02:06:02.106]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.106 --> 02:06:07.690]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:06:07.690 --> 02:06:12.714]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:06:12.714 --> 02:06:13.194]  It's true.
[02:06:13.194 --> 02:06:17.738]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:06:18.278 --> 02:06:23.502]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:06:23.502 --> 02:06:30.606]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:06:30.606 --> 02:06:31.727]  And here's the best part.
[02:06:31.727 --> 02:06:38.091]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:06:38.411 --> 02:06:41.593]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:41.593 --> 02:06:43.815]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:43.815 --> 02:06:44.775]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:06:44.775 --> 02:06:45.015]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:06:45.015 --> 02:06:48.397]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:06:48.397 --> 02:06:50.139]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:00.385 --> 02:07:06.526]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:07:06.526 --> 02:07:09.487]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:07:09.487 --> 02:07:14.888]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:07:14.888 --> 02:07:19.849]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:07:19.849 --> 02:07:27.170]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[02:07:27.490 --> 02:07:31.371]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:07:31.371 --> 02:07:33.152]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:07:33.152 --> 02:07:37.174]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[02:07:37.174 --> 02:07:40.075]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:07:40.075 --> 02:07:42.856]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today.
[02:07:42.856 --> 02:07:47.417]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:07:47.417 --> 02:07:48.077]  Don't wait!
[02:07:48.077 --> 02:07:48.317]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:07:48.317 --> 02:07:49.958]  Or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.

[02:08:05.697 --> 02:08:10.521]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:10.521 --> 02:08:12.102]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.102 --> 02:08:13.643]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.643 --> 02:08:17.846]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.846 --> 02:08:21.949]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:51.378]  Joining us for the rest of the hour here on this Wednesday, the 29th day of August 2012, is Steve Quayle, talk show host, best-selling author, he's written Blueprint for Survival, Investment Perspectives on Precious Metals.
[02:08:52.419 --> 02:08:54.140]  Um, and so many others.
[02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:59.983]  But I remember him talking about chimeras and cross-species clones 15 years ago and going, yeah, right.
[02:08:59.983 --> 02:09:01.624]  And now it's mainstream news.
[02:09:01.624 --> 02:09:11.590]  So one area, though, where you can't debate with him is he's been 100% accurate saying foreign trips, Russians, others were training out in Colorado in places and now it's mainstream news.
[02:09:12.190 --> 02:09:17.775]  Russian special forces, Russian aircraft practicing fighting terrorists in America.
[02:09:17.775 --> 02:09:20.478]  That was in the Associated Press two days ago.
[02:09:20.478 --> 02:09:21.198]  Guys, type that in.
[02:09:21.198 --> 02:09:22.139]  People won't believe it.
[02:09:22.139 --> 02:09:23.780]  People watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:26.203]  For radio listeners, I want to get the exact headline.
[02:09:26.203 --> 02:09:29.325]  It's like Russian Air Force to fight terrorists in drill in America.
[02:09:30.166 --> 02:09:35.732]  I mean, it's so crazy how they're just acclimating us, and it doesn't mean they're going to come get us tomorrow.
[02:09:35.732 --> 02:09:36.974]  It's this global government.
[02:09:36.974 --> 02:09:48.527]  It's the military being told, you're under NATO and UN command now, and Congress being told, sit down, shut up, by the Joint Chiefs and the Chairman and Obama in open letters.
[02:09:48.527 --> 02:09:51.070]  It's the announcements on CNBC that we've been
[02:09:51.610 --> 02:09:55.073]  Taken over by foreign banks and we're slaves to a global government.
[02:09:55.073 --> 02:09:55.953]  Those are quotes.
[02:09:55.953 --> 02:09:58.996]  You've heard me play it probably 50 times in the last few months.
[02:09:58.996 --> 02:10:03.039]  Hundreds of publications announcing, you know, we're under a world government.
[02:10:03.039 --> 02:10:05.621]  It's authoritarian for your own good.
[02:10:05.621 --> 02:10:09.724]  That's the Financial Times of London right there with the Bilderberg group member saying that.
[02:10:09.724 --> 02:10:15.809]  There's Cyber News Service, CNS News, Russian-Americans take part in joint Air Force counter-terror drill.
[02:10:18.297 --> 02:10:18.657]  See?
[02:10:18.657 --> 02:10:19.397]  There you go.
[02:10:19.397 --> 02:10:23.238]  I mean, it's all getting Twilight Zone right now.
[02:10:23.238 --> 02:10:36.542]  It's all getting Twilight Zone because they want to just suspend disbelief, get everybody's normalcy bias going, where we'll put up with anything, like the TSA fishing around in our wives' and children's underwear.
[02:10:36.542 --> 02:10:39.743]  I mean, it is amazing what we'll put up with.
[02:10:39.743 --> 02:10:42.484]  Now we have Obama people on hardball,
[02:10:43.444 --> 02:10:46.646]  On other shows saying we need new shootings, we need new bombings.
[02:10:46.646 --> 02:10:48.067]  This will help get Obama re-elected.
[02:10:48.067 --> 02:10:50.628]  I played those clips in the first hour.
[02:10:50.628 --> 02:10:54.590]  We have all these quotes about a new terror attack.
[02:10:54.590 --> 02:10:56.531]  To be blamed on our enemies will save us.
[02:10:56.531 --> 02:10:58.672]  They don't say they're going to do it, but they leave one degree.
[02:10:59.904 --> 02:11:00.885]  I'm saying they're going to do it.
[02:11:00.885 --> 02:11:04.126]  They're like, gee, a terror attack would sure help, and don't worry, one's coming.
[02:11:04.126 --> 02:11:11.890]  So now we've got Mr. Hagman's source that fits in with my police sources, and my homeland security sources are too scared to talk to me now.
[02:11:11.890 --> 02:11:13.511]  They say everything's surveilled.
[02:11:13.511 --> 02:11:19.894]  I mean, I've got to go meet somebody in a field if I want to, and that's too dangerous, because somebody could be posing as some of my sources.
[02:11:19.894 --> 02:11:24.636]  I've got them in state police, FBI, Justice Department, federal marshals.
[02:11:26.437 --> 02:11:30.879]  You know, in the old days it was still fun and games until they get death threats when they talk to me.
[02:11:30.879 --> 02:11:34.081]  I mean, stuff's being listened to, folks, OK?
[02:11:34.081 --> 02:11:34.882]  I mean, that's come out.
[02:11:34.882 --> 02:11:39.764]  They've got the NSA not spying on foreign terrorists, on people in government.
[02:11:39.764 --> 02:11:43.747]  And somehow you've got to, in fact, I should ask Hagman that because he's about to leave us in a moment.
[02:11:43.747 --> 02:11:53.172]  But I wanted to bring Steve Quayle up if he had any questions for Doug to have the two kind of dovetail together here at the end of our talk with Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network.
[02:11:54.093 --> 02:12:03.600]  That this is all coming to a head and we would be crazy to not be concerned about a false flag when this is when the season of that is upon us.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:14.328]  So Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com joins us because, and I remember him two years ago saying, they're going to weaponize drones and use our GPS coordinates to use them against us.
[02:12:14.648 --> 02:12:18.030]  Comedy Central played the clip of him on the show and said we were insane.
[02:12:44.828 --> 02:12:50.952]  I mean, I know he believes it, but I'm like, my gosh, I know he has these sources, but are they feeding him disinfo?
[02:12:50.952 --> 02:12:51.693]  I hope so.
[02:12:51.693 --> 02:12:52.793]  I hope this isn't true.
[02:12:52.793 --> 02:12:56.536]  Steve Quayle, I don't know how much of the last hour you heard, but what's your take on it all?
[02:12:57.247 --> 02:13:05.189]  Well, right now, Alex, we are absolutely under full-scale occupation by foreign troops under the guise of United Nations, NATO.
[02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:06.729]  It is the New World Army.
[02:13:06.729 --> 02:13:12.470]  What you've warned about, what you've posted videos about, what Doug writes about, it's all in play now.
[02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:19.252]  And, you know, it's amazing because the level of denial and normalcy bias is so accelerating.
[02:13:19.252 --> 02:13:24.513]  In other words, I would have thought that all of our combined efforts and all of our... would wake more people up.
[02:13:24.513 --> 02:13:26.273]  Now, granted, some people are waking up.
[02:13:26.653 --> 02:13:34.404]  But all you have to do is realize that the mainstream media is the inoculation mechanism to totally destroy your brain and...
[02:13:35.612 --> 02:13:37.893]  And keep the people from coming to the knowledge of the truth.
[02:13:37.893 --> 02:13:39.354]  And here's what the truth is.
[02:13:39.354 --> 02:13:41.955]  We are under occupation by the foreign governments.
[02:13:41.955 --> 02:13:43.856]  You just talked about the Air Force.
[02:13:43.856 --> 02:13:45.717]  The Russians are here.
[02:13:45.717 --> 02:13:48.198]  The three statements that they've made publicly.
[02:13:48.198 --> 02:13:52.020]  Now they're in NORAD, one of our most top secret command centers.
[02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:57.883]  They're absolutely supposedly going after the CIA headquarters in Denver as an exercise.
[02:13:57.883 --> 02:14:00.124]  And the NSA in Utah.
[02:14:00.805 --> 02:14:07.153]  The point is, if this wasn't just out of the America series, I don't know what is.
[02:14:07.153 --> 02:14:14.743]  And for the record, ladies and gentlemen, all of the critics and shills out there are trying to keep the biggest secret from you in the world.
[02:14:14.743 --> 02:14:18.048]  We are under communist, global, luciferian,
[02:14:18.768 --> 02:14:35.836]  Occupations soon to go into full-scale warfare, and all that we've warned about, all that we've said is going to happen, the militarization of the police, obviously Alex's appearance at the Bilderbergers, showing you in living color that these entities, I'm going to use that word, Alex, entities exist.
[02:14:35.836 --> 02:14:38.537]  The point is, it's rape, pillage, and plunder.
[02:14:38.537 --> 02:14:40.438]  The United States is going under.
[02:14:40.438 --> 02:14:42.499]  Now, I'm not a fatalist.
[02:14:42.499 --> 02:14:43.199]  I'm a realist.
[02:14:43.619 --> 02:14:44.861]  But you know what it's like, Alex.
[02:14:44.861 --> 02:14:54.873]  You almost have to suspend belief in order to emotionally cope with some of the stuff, but when it all comes rushing to the foreground before your eyes, you can't deny it any longer.
[02:14:54.873 --> 02:14:56.935]  Doug's sources are not my sources.
[02:14:56.935 --> 02:14:59.078]  My sources are not Alex Jones's sources.
[02:14:59.618 --> 02:15:02.099]  You just went on a litany about people are frightened.
[02:15:02.099 --> 02:15:13.441]  I can tell you point-blank that when generals who are four stars say that even they've got to watch what they say and they've got to be careful, everybody is at war with each other.
[02:15:13.441 --> 02:15:21.623]  And so to the men and women that Doug and I addressed last night on his show that are in uniform, you must stand up for what's right.
[02:15:21.623 --> 02:15:25.964]  You took an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:15:25.964 --> 02:15:28.565]  Right now, Alex, we've got so many
[02:15:29.045 --> 02:15:30.307]  We're good to go.
[02:15:50.168 --> 02:15:51.809]  The northern border with Canada.
[02:15:51.809 --> 02:15:55.531]  If you're an American citizen, see how you're treated when you go into Canada.
[02:15:55.531 --> 02:15:57.972]  And let the southern borders wide open.
[02:15:57.972 --> 02:16:02.874]  The head of the Border Patrol, before he quit a number of years ago, called me and said, Steve, I can't take it.
[02:16:02.874 --> 02:16:05.775]  They're putting my men out to slaughter.
[02:16:05.775 --> 02:16:07.696]  And you, Alex, have had Border Patrol guys on.
[02:16:07.696 --> 02:16:09.337]  We've talked about all this stuff.
[02:16:09.337 --> 02:16:13.819]  Listen, Doug's source and my source corroborated, and I'll turn it over to Doug.
[02:16:14.499 --> 02:16:18.002]  How many, if you will, other than Mexicans?
[02:16:18.002 --> 02:16:20.223]  This is not an anti-Latino.
[02:16:20.223 --> 02:16:24.526]  My best friend in the world was a Latino, and bless her heart, Mary Juarez.
[02:16:24.526 --> 02:16:37.915]  The point is that this is an anti-terrorist rant of the fifth column of full-scale warriors, professional warriors, coming in through the southern border, and trust me, they speak other languages than Spanish.
[02:16:37.915 --> 02:16:43.219]  So Doug and I both got the same numbers of how many were coming through, and we both were in disbelief.
[02:16:43.839 --> 02:16:47.522]  Wasn't it, Doug, about, what, $50,000 a month?
[02:16:47.522 --> 02:16:50.945]  Between $40,000 and $50,000, Steve, a thousand a month.
[02:16:50.945 --> 02:16:56.950]  And that's just one specific narrow area that we know of.
[02:16:56.950 --> 02:17:01.974]  There could be others, but, I mean, that alone is staggering to me.
[02:17:04.336 --> 02:17:06.559]  But you're 100% correct.
[02:17:06.559 --> 02:17:22.157]  What normal person, what normal security apparatus for the United States would allow this to happen if there was not... What does your source say the 1.4 million rounds of ammo are for?
[02:17:24.107 --> 02:17:26.309]  Are you talking to me, Alex, or Doug?
[02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:30.432]  Doug and Steve Quill, just briefly as Doug's leaving us.
[02:17:30.432 --> 02:17:31.753]  Let me answer that real quick.
[02:17:31.753 --> 02:17:40.741]  My source is told that that's for the private army that is going to be resurrected out of the mayhem that Obama's already gone on record on.
[02:17:40.741 --> 02:17:42.362]  You've done shows on it, Alex.
[02:17:42.362 --> 02:17:46.366]  You've posted on your website, the New York Times, the Boy Scouts being trained with H&K MP5s.
[02:17:48.167 --> 02:18:07.348]  And I actually calculated how many weapons, how many rounds, how many magazines, and it's pretty interesting because, again, we're talking about, ladies and gentlemen, the federalization, or let's call it even a better word, the luciferic control of all law enforcement, global dominance, perpetual war for perpetual peace,
[02:18:07.728 --> 02:18:13.213]  And this is the exact setting the Bible sets up in the book of Revelation for the reign and rule of Antichrist.
[02:18:13.213 --> 02:18:18.377]  We are going in, Alex, and are already seeing right now the strategic placement.
[02:18:18.377 --> 02:18:35.531]  Those billions of rounds, and I've been in the firearms business for 30 years, so I know a little bit about the gun business, know a lot of people all over the country and world, as a matter of fact, and the source that I got it from basically stated, this is for the civilian private
[02:18:35.731 --> 02:18:36.051]  We're good.
[02:18:53.447 --> 02:18:54.187]  That's a month old.
[02:18:54.187 --> 02:18:55.988]  They're buying millions more.
[02:18:55.988 --> 02:18:57.348]  Now they're classifying it.
[02:18:57.348 --> 02:18:58.728]  It's blacked out.
[02:18:58.728 --> 02:18:59.869]  We reported on that a few weeks ago.
[02:18:59.869 --> 02:19:02.069]  It became an actual story on the new ammo.
[02:19:02.069 --> 02:19:04.490]  But it's giant black armored vehicles.
[02:19:04.490 --> 02:19:06.810]  I've got photos of them, hundreds of them.
[02:19:06.810 --> 02:19:09.071]  Armored pillboxes digging in.
[02:19:09.071 --> 02:19:11.232]  I mean, you can look at the architecture.
[02:19:11.232 --> 02:19:14.832]  It can be sacred, but the public intelligence is how they're set up.
[02:19:14.832 --> 02:19:16.493]  This is being set up for a war.
[02:19:17.474 --> 02:19:20.639]  Against county and city government, not just against the people.
[02:19:20.639 --> 02:19:24.647]  When you look at the configuration, they're preparing to take over state houses.
[02:19:24.647 --> 02:19:28.794]  The architecture of this warfare system is pointed at the states.
[02:19:29.736 --> 02:19:34.960]  Absolutely, and every single state capitol building is already marked.
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:42.044]  It's already, basically, the teams that are going to take those over are already located, literally, if you will, statewide.
[02:20:00.016 --> 02:20:00.717]  Stinkin' camp!
[02:20:20.569 --> 02:20:28.216]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[02:20:28.216 --> 02:20:32.080]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:33.882]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:20:33.882 --> 02:20:37.905]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:20:37.905 --> 02:20:40.528]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:20:40.788 --> 02:20:43.569]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:20:43.569 --> 02:20:48.130]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[02:20:48.130 --> 02:20:48.770]  Don't wait!
[02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:54.031]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:20:54.031 --> 02:20:58.533]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[02:21:05.674 --> 02:21:07.775]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:21:08.704 --> 02:21:17.670]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:21:17.670 --> 02:21:22.593]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:21:46.570 --> 02:21:50.172]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[02:21:57.436 --> 02:21:58.696]  Protect your immune system.
[02:21:58.696 --> 02:21:59.737]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:22:00.816 --> 02:22:01.817]  Hi there.
[02:22:01.817 --> 02:22:03.358]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:22:03.358 --> 02:22:07.181]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:22:07.181 --> 02:22:16.328]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:22:16.328 --> 02:22:23.053]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:22:23.053 --> 02:22:25.235]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:22:25.235 --> 02:22:30.319]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:22:31.039 --> 02:22:38.984]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:22:38.984 --> 02:22:44.568]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:22:44.568 --> 02:22:51.072]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:22:51.072 --> 02:22:56.775]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:22:56.775 --> 02:22:57.896]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:23:00.123 --> 02:23:01.584]  Are you storing food?
[02:23:01.584 --> 02:23:07.769]  Prepared families are storing food for months and years, but only have enough fuel stored for days or weeks.
[02:23:07.769 --> 02:23:12.192]  Stretch your fuel storage by harnessing the power of the sun with a sun oven.
[02:23:12.192 --> 02:23:18.718]  Food can be baked, boiled or steamed at temperatures of 360 to 400 degrees with the power of the sun.
[02:23:18.718 --> 02:23:21.640]  You can use the sun for 50 to 80 percent of your cooking.
[02:23:21.980 --> 02:23:25.064]  Allowing you to preserve your fuel storage for rainy days.
[02:23:25.064 --> 02:23:29.009]  Sun-baked foods stay moister and have less shrinkage and do not burn.
[02:23:29.009 --> 02:23:31.692]  Sun-baked roasts are tastier and more succulent.
[02:23:31.692 --> 02:23:35.076]  And sun-baked bread has unparalleled taste and texture.
[02:23:35.076 --> 02:23:38.821]  Water can be heated in a sun oven for purification or personal hygiene.
[02:23:39.201 --> 02:23:43.623]  For the past 26 years, Sun Ovens have been proudly made in the U.S.

[02:24:05.077 --> 02:24:12.428]  Alright, Steve Quayle is our guest right now and we have Mr. Hagman with us as well.
[02:24:12.428 --> 02:24:15.733]  He's going to leave us here in just a moment.
[02:24:15.733 --> 02:24:20.240]  Doug, was there anything else you'd like to add or say to Steve here or ask Steve?
[02:24:21.621 --> 02:24:23.663]  Well Alex, I just want to say this.
[02:24:23.663 --> 02:24:50.040]  Steve has long been a good friend and our sources now are saying the same exact thing and I've got to tell you this is a perfect segue into Steve's segment because we've talked leading up to this show and compared notes and I've got to tell you everything that Steve is about to tell you is consistent with the information I've received from my sources and I'll just leave it at that and
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:51.061]  All right, Doug.
[02:24:51.061 --> 02:24:51.661]  God bless you.
[02:24:51.661 --> 02:24:52.562]  Thank you so much.
[02:24:52.562 --> 02:24:55.344]  Look, I've had police call in when they had tanks rolling around St.
[02:24:55.344 --> 02:25:03.810]  Louis doing urban warfare drills that they were going to stay in the future and that they were told get ready for collapse in late October, early November.
[02:25:03.810 --> 02:25:10.175]  And the cop broke down crying and then later I confirmed it with other sources and confirmed the police officer and information.
[02:25:11.716 --> 02:25:13.017]  This is going on everywhere.
[02:25:13.017 --> 02:25:17.921]  Special Forces operations to acclimate us, to acclimate the military that this is okay.
[02:25:17.921 --> 02:25:21.104]  Steve, is it a financial collapse they're getting ready for?
[02:25:21.104 --> 02:25:25.487]  I mean, from your sources, how is this going to play out and can we stop it?
[02:25:25.487 --> 02:25:28.750]  You cannot stop it and it's going to play out because it's designed.
[02:25:28.750 --> 02:25:33.354]  You know, not only is the love of money the root of all evil, the control of money is the control of all evil.
[02:25:33.354 --> 02:25:40.460]  By choking off everyone's bank accounts, you know, Alex, we talked about a little bit yesterday on your TV show, the Dredge Report
[02:25:40.860 --> 02:26:07.911]  Carrying the story about the cyber attacks on banks the true amount of money that have Has disappeared from customers account and specific banks over 200 banks The real truth is never given in its totality Unless you talk to the people that know for instance who designed the program that watches banks when they come under cyber attack So here's how it's going to go down and this is what I've been told and this is what's been verified and for the record
[02:26:08.331 --> 02:26:10.513]  The verifications now will come instantly.
[02:26:10.513 --> 02:26:11.314]  You know that, Alex.
[02:26:11.314 --> 02:26:17.579]  We'll do a show, or you'll do a show, and two or three people get ahold of you, and even the people that... And I want to commend your wisdom.
[02:26:17.579 --> 02:26:22.364]  Do not be drawn out into any field with anybody, any time, okay?
[02:26:22.364 --> 02:26:25.126]  They're too good at spoofing identities.
[02:26:25.126 --> 02:26:30.771]  They'll give you real information, and I don't know if you know this, Alex, but we really, really prayed for you and your family.
[02:26:30.771 --> 02:26:33.554]  I did last night on Doug Hagman's show.
[02:26:33.814 --> 02:26:34.715]  I didn't know that, no thank you.
[02:26:53.855 --> 02:26:59.159]  I want those of you who understand the lateness of the hour to recognize that.
[02:26:59.159 --> 02:27:00.620]  You asked me a question, Alex.
[02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:02.402]  I wish I were wrong.
[02:27:02.402 --> 02:27:03.863]  I wish we could stop it.
[02:27:03.863 --> 02:27:10.147]  The only thing that we can do right now is prepare for the worst-case scenario and understand.
[02:27:10.147 --> 02:27:12.169]  This is what I cannot get across to people.
[02:27:12.169 --> 02:27:14.811]  You had Graithwal on your show.
[02:27:15.852 --> 02:27:23.957]  50 million people already are assigned to be assassinated when the next power play goes in place.
[02:27:23.957 --> 02:27:26.880]  This is a full, and I'm not apologizing.
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:30.422]  Well, that was when he was in the Weathermen who are like Obama's bosses.
[02:27:30.422 --> 02:27:36.266]  I mean, he was in the meeting and they said, we're going to put 50 million in, re-education, we're going to kill 25 million.
[02:27:36.266 --> 02:27:37.587]  That's pretty much standard procedure.
[02:27:37.587 --> 02:27:39.889]  But that was back in the 70s.
[02:27:39.889 --> 02:27:42.311]  Now their plan, you're saying, is to kill even more.
[02:27:42.731 --> 02:27:43.552]  Yeah, 57 minutes.
[02:27:43.552 --> 02:27:45.093]  Let me tell you something that's interesting.
[02:27:45.093 --> 02:27:46.854]  This is deep background, Alex.
[02:27:46.854 --> 02:27:56.400]  And for those of you that want to confirm this to Alex, the President of the United States met with Russian generals at Nellis Air Force Base under the cover of a recent Nevada campaign event.
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:59.803]  In other words, you've got to understand this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:00.563 --> 02:28:02.604]  Our country is sold out!
[02:28:02.604 --> 02:28:05.445]  And analysis where a lot of the Russians are entering the U.S.
[02:28:05.445 --> 02:28:08.906]  by air and then they're being dispersed by bus all over the country.
[02:28:08.906 --> 02:28:10.166]  Minneapolis, St.
[02:28:10.166 --> 02:28:10.646]  Paul.
[02:28:10.646 --> 02:28:13.447]  And again, Alex, I just want to share something.
[02:28:13.447 --> 02:28:16.108]  I've gone to a 24-7 format on my website.
[02:28:16.108 --> 02:28:16.868]  This is critical.
[02:28:17.268 --> 02:28:21.449]  When I get news updates like this, I post them on my Q-Alerts.
[02:28:21.449 --> 02:28:24.230]  The Q-Alerts is on the right-hand side of my website.
[02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:29.652]  I used to be, you know, only updating like once a day and that won't work and hasn't worked for some time.
[02:28:29.652 --> 02:28:33.393]  So I've gone to being able to post myself and have others that post.
[02:28:33.393 --> 02:28:38.315]  So the Q-Alerts on my website is where all the important stuff happens.
[02:28:38.315 --> 02:28:45.977]  And so what I'm telling you, point-blank, from the deep background, and I will share this, someone who was at Nellis and saw it happen,
[02:28:46.477 --> 02:28:55.424]  You have, the President of the United States, when he reached over and told Dimitri, give me, wait until the second term, and I've got more leeway.
[02:28:55.424 --> 02:28:58.566]  You even did a, you mentioned that on one of your shows.
[02:28:58.566 --> 02:29:04.391]  The bottom line is, Medvedev said, I will share with Vladimir your statement.
[02:29:04.851 --> 02:29:23.749]  So the point is, is that we have now, if you will, an astonishing amount of foreign troops in this country, and most of the American troops are outside the country, and again, this is open source stuff that's verified by Doug's sources, my sources, Greg Evenson's sources, are fighting men in Iraq,
[02:29:24.970 --> 02:29:25.891]  We're on the march.
[02:29:25.891 --> 02:29:26.511]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.091 --> 02:30:01.535]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.535 --> 02:30:05.016]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or a colloidal silver.
[02:30:05.016 --> 02:30:10.619]  It is a nanocatalytic silver cell technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers of yesterday.
[02:30:10.619 --> 02:30:14.321]  This new molecular structure is permanently bonded to water.
[02:30:14.321 --> 02:30:20.624]  It is the only water-soluble silver that is 99% bioavailable and non-toxic with no known side effects.
[02:30:21.124 --> 02:30:29.111]  Silversol's patented technology has advanced antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties with a 15-year shelf life.
[02:30:29.111 --> 02:30:35.277]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is one of the most important items needed in any emergency.
[02:30:35.277 --> 02:30:42.424]  Independent testing from universities, hospitals, military, and private labs make this the most proven product in the industry.
[02:30:42.424 --> 02:30:44.546]  No silver solution is better or safer.
[02:30:44.966 --> 02:30:47.867]  Protect yourself and your loved ones and be prepared.

[02:31:04.373 --> 02:31:10.317]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[02:31:10.317 --> 02:31:16.902]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[02:31:16.902 --> 02:31:22.605]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[02:31:22.605 --> 02:31:26.248]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[02:31:26.428 --> 02:31:30.231]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.

[02:31:37.337 --> 02:31:41.201]  Don't dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[02:31:41.201 --> 02:31:45.625]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[02:31:45.625 --> 02:31:48.267]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[02:31:48.567 --> 02:31:55.417]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[02:31:55.417 --> 02:32:00.745]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshot.com.
[02:32:00.745 --> 02:32:04.050]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water?
[02:32:04.531 --> 02:32:06.232]  Laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:32:06.232 --> 02:32:08.635]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:32:08.635 --> 02:32:14.360]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there, bar none, is ProPure.
[02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:17.743]  And it's available discounted at Infowars.com.
[02:32:17.743 --> 02:32:21.206]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:32:21.206 --> 02:32:22.867]  There's no priming required.
[02:32:22.867 --> 02:32:25.149]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[02:32:25.149 --> 02:32:27.671]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:32:28.712 --> 02:32:30.233]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:32:30.233 --> 02:32:31.654]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:32:31.654 --> 02:32:34.836]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:32:34.836 --> 02:32:38.218]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:32:38.218 --> 02:32:42.340]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:32:42.340 --> 02:32:45.082]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:32:45.082 --> 02:32:46.663]  It's what my family uses.
[02:32:46.663 --> 02:32:49.985]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[02:32:57.129 --> 02:32:58.391]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:32:58.391 --> 02:33:06.599]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:29.150 --> 02:33:34.074]  Things moved so quick around here yesterday.
[02:33:34.074 --> 02:33:38.177]  Eric Brose has been on the show a few times of Houston Free Thinkers.
[02:33:38.177 --> 02:33:41.900]  I went down and spoke at one of their rallies to end the Fed last year.
[02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:43.341]  He's been on a few times as a guest.
[02:33:43.341 --> 02:33:47.465]  They protested the TSA running checkpoints in Houston.
[02:33:47.465 --> 02:33:48.846]  The city was forced to remove them.
[02:33:51.007 --> 02:33:53.889]  They got detained by Homeland Security and TSA.
[02:33:53.889 --> 02:33:54.849]  There's video of that.
[02:33:54.849 --> 02:33:56.610]  He told me about it yesterday.
[02:33:56.610 --> 02:33:57.530]  The video was coming.
[02:33:57.530 --> 02:33:59.411]  He emailed it to us.
[02:33:59.411 --> 02:34:00.892]  Steve Watson now has it up.
[02:34:00.892 --> 02:34:06.315]  We'll get him on tomorrow or maybe even tonight from Tampa.
[02:34:06.315 --> 02:34:10.737]  But it just went up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com video.
[02:34:10.737 --> 02:34:14.640]  TSA takes over bus station in Tampa.
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:16.781]  DHS agents threaten journalist.
[02:34:17.677 --> 02:34:20.859]  And this is part of a pattern now where they even know who you are.
[02:34:20.859 --> 02:34:27.324]  It was like the We Are Change reporter, Julio, up in Chicago, showed DHS running checkpoints.
[02:34:27.324 --> 02:34:30.967]  A week later, they came up to him on the street and said, we're watching you.
[02:34:30.967 --> 02:34:32.248]  We saw your video.
[02:34:32.248 --> 02:34:33.589]  You don't do that in America.
[02:34:34.369 --> 02:34:37.451]  So, this is all just off the charts insane.
[02:34:37.451 --> 02:34:38.452]  How out of control.
[02:34:38.452 --> 02:34:40.253]  These videos are pretty amazing.
[02:34:40.253 --> 02:34:42.414]  They're up at InfoWars.com video.
[02:34:42.414 --> 02:34:44.876]  TSA takes over bus station in Tampa.
[02:34:44.876 --> 02:34:46.917]  DHS agents threaten journalists.
[02:34:46.917 --> 02:34:51.360]  That's the latest breaking news at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:54.542]  We'll have some clips of those videos tonight on InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:34:55.462 --> 02:35:01.226]  And we'll get, again, Mr. Brose on very quickly, either tonight or tomorrow, from Tampa.
[02:35:01.226 --> 02:35:04.168]  And we're also going to be following the hurricane, hope the levees don't break.
[02:35:04.168 --> 02:35:08.971]  We haven't gotten back with our reporter source, Charles, who reported on us during Katrina.
[02:35:08.971 --> 02:35:11.473]  He said one of the levees had broken in the area he was at.
[02:35:11.473 --> 02:35:13.274]  They're saying water's going over the levees.
[02:35:13.274 --> 02:35:15.556]  We're going to continue to track that.
[02:35:15.556 --> 02:35:18.337]  I remember Steve Quayle 15 years ago talking about weather weapons.
[02:35:18.337 --> 02:35:19.558]  Now that's admitted.
[02:35:19.558 --> 02:35:20.919]  Look, Steve, here's the deal.
[02:35:20.919 --> 02:35:22.720]  I know you're a smart guy.
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:24.842]  You have a lot of sources because you've been around forever.
[02:35:25.422 --> 02:35:27.243]  I'm not denying that you believe this.
[02:35:27.243 --> 02:35:29.625]  You talked about Russian troops secretly training.
[02:35:29.625 --> 02:35:30.786]  Now that's admitted.
[02:35:30.786 --> 02:35:31.687]  Bizarre!
[02:35:31.687 --> 02:35:32.888]  We're in the land of bizarre.
[02:35:32.888 --> 02:35:39.453]  You know, the government shipping guns into Mexico to destabilize things and blame the Second Amendment, a false flag.
[02:35:39.453 --> 02:35:43.616]  But we see Soros and others trying to overthrow Putin.
[02:35:43.616 --> 02:35:46.918]  We see that destabilization campaign.
[02:35:46.918 --> 02:35:52.923]  I know the globalists are running the Chinese government, but the Russians, from my evidence, there's some type of split.
[02:35:52.923 --> 02:35:53.483]  I know that they
[02:35:54.384 --> 02:35:55.304]  Fight with each other.
[02:35:55.304 --> 02:35:58.526]  And I know the globalists like to balance countries against each other.
[02:35:58.526 --> 02:36:01.847]  But I know the US troops are not being let into these secret Russian bases.
[02:36:01.847 --> 02:36:03.828]  They're NORAD equivalent.
[02:36:03.828 --> 02:36:05.209]  So, what is going on?
[02:36:05.209 --> 02:36:13.072]  I mean, you're now saying you think that... I mean, I know they say in NLE09 that they would use foreign troops in America.
[02:36:13.072 --> 02:36:15.933]  I know they say they're doing anti-terror drills with the Russians.
[02:36:15.933 --> 02:36:17.674]  I mean, how would they trigger this?
[02:36:17.674 --> 02:36:19.195]  How would they get away with it?
[02:36:19.195 --> 02:36:21.396]  I mean, I could see our military under foreign command
[02:36:22.236 --> 02:36:30.609]  Or mercenaries mixed in with foreigners, but, and we've seen the drills for that, but how would they get away with Russian troops?
[02:36:30.609 --> 02:36:32.432]  I mean, that's what you're saying, your source?
[02:36:32.432 --> 02:36:36.357]  Because, I mean, that would unify Americans, Russian troops.
[02:36:37.455 --> 02:36:47.385]  Well, unfortunately it won't, because the bottom line is that even our military, most of the good guys have either been outed, meaning outed or assassinated.
[02:36:47.385 --> 02:36:51.429]  Here's the thing, Alex, and this is something that most people don't understand.
[02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:57.615]  Even though there seems to be a consensus amongst the Western European, US,
[02:36:58.235 --> 02:37:02.238]  And some of the Asian and Middle Eastern countries.
[02:37:02.238 --> 02:37:07.180]  Russia and China, a number of years ago, got together and signed a secret accord.
[02:37:07.180 --> 02:37:21.329]  And for the record, one year before that meeting took place, a guy by the name of Dmitry Dudaman, you've probably read of his prophecies, D-U-D-U-M-A-N, saw the meeting and they basically had, and this isn't word for word, but overview.
[02:37:21.329 --> 02:37:23.250]  This will answer your question specifically.
[02:37:23.951 --> 02:37:39.059]  They were aware and they were going to play along with the Americans on their New World Order until the chance came where they could take us out, take us down, and the United States has already been divided up between the Russians and the Chinese.
[02:37:39.059 --> 02:37:41.300]  Henry Groover, A.A.
[02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:43.681]  Allen, I posted these on my website, Dreams and Visions.
[02:37:43.681 --> 02:37:49.504]  I mean, we're talking visions of Russians and Chinese invading the United States from 60 years ago.
[02:37:50.064 --> 02:38:08.168]  And so now the thing is, and you know Stanislav Lunev, Viktor Suvorov, you know, all the different defectors of written books, the number one thing they said, they would be able to succeed because their friends in the government would allow them to pre-position their men and materiels ahead of the takeover.
[02:38:08.168 --> 02:38:12.608]  Now let me make this clear to everybody in the military, even those who are side-by-side.
[02:38:12.608 --> 02:38:15.309]  Some friends of mine in the southern state, I won't give the state away,
[02:38:15.749 --> 02:38:16.629]  Vietnam vets.
[02:38:16.629 --> 02:38:18.149]  God bless every veteran out there.
[02:38:18.149 --> 02:38:20.490]  Vietnam, every war vet out there.
[02:38:20.490 --> 02:38:21.690]  I want to thank you guys.
[02:38:21.690 --> 02:38:28.111]  One of them spoke Russian, and they saw a joint tactical exercise taking place.
[02:38:28.111 --> 02:38:33.112]  And fortunately for their skills learned in the jungle, they were able to track the Russians.
[02:38:33.112 --> 02:38:41.714]  When the American counterparts, which I think were out of Fort Bragg, left, they overheard the Americans, forgive me, the Russians, in Russian, stating
[02:38:42.194 --> 02:38:48.676]  These Americans, once we have put down their enemies, we put them down.
[02:38:48.676 --> 02:38:56.319]  And they were laughing, giving each other high fives and shaking their heads, saying that the very people they're training with, they're going to turn their weapons on them.
[02:38:56.319 --> 02:39:00.280]  Now, Alex, that's from eyewitnesses who speak Russian, having heard it.
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:09.543]  Well, Larry Grafwald, who was in the top Weathermen meetings with the big union chiefs, they said, we're going to bring in Chinese and Russians once we've taken over.
[02:39:10.163 --> 02:39:22.316]  And it all sounds so crazy, but then they're drilling in anti-terror with the Russians, and so it's basically the foreign bankers may do a double take and a triple cross, you're saying, and then do this.
[02:39:22.316 --> 02:39:23.157]  But there's a problem.
[02:39:23.157 --> 02:39:28.282]  As Admiral Yamamoto said, there would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.
[02:39:28.282 --> 02:39:30.425]  No one I know would put up with foreign troops.
[02:39:31.001 --> 02:39:32.161]  We're putting up with them, Alex.
[02:39:32.161 --> 02:39:33.362]  We're putting up with them.
[02:39:33.362 --> 02:39:35.302]  The point is, is that, let me share this with you.
[02:39:35.302 --> 02:39:49.446]  If you go back and do a little history on Spetsnaz, when I first started writing my book, real quick, the 62nd version, Breathe No Evil and Blueprint for Survival, I was really into the Soviet defense policies.
[02:39:49.446 --> 02:39:52.867]  Obviously, I was before, oh, goodnight,
[02:39:53.787 --> 02:39:55.609]  Alexander Labed was murdered.
[02:39:55.609 --> 02:39:56.550]  He was taken down.
[02:39:56.550 --> 02:39:59.053]  He's the one that came and testified to the Welding Committee.
[02:39:59.053 --> 02:40:02.136]  I was in a week away from interviewing him, okay?
[02:40:02.136 --> 02:40:07.101]  General Labed was basically the National Security Advisor for Boris Yeltsin.
[02:40:07.101 --> 02:40:15.230]  To make a long story short, the night he got killed, I said on George Norrie Coast to Coast, I said it was either George or Art that he was murdered.
[02:40:15.430 --> 02:40:23.678]  Well, his brother came out a week later, but understanding Russian defense policy and civil war was my forte and my take.
[02:40:23.678 --> 02:40:31.245]  I was friends with someone whose business partner was the sister of one of the highest ranking members of the KGB.
[02:40:31.245 --> 02:40:32.707]  As a matter of fact, the man that run it.
[02:40:33.247 --> 02:40:34.727]  I ran it before he died.
[02:40:34.727 --> 02:40:38.148]  So the point I'm trying to make in this is they're already here.
[02:40:38.148 --> 02:40:39.689]  What can Americans do right now?
[02:40:39.689 --> 02:40:46.531]  We've seen the prepositioning and the strategic placement of military arms and armament.
[02:40:46.531 --> 02:40:50.032]  We've seen A-10s, we're seeing helicopter gunships in downtown.
[02:40:50.032 --> 02:40:57.574]  And see Alex, you know you can put up the videos on Infowars.com and I can put them up and link to your stuff but people don't get it.
[02:40:57.574 --> 02:41:02.155]  Why are they practicing urban warfare in the cities of America
[02:41:03.155 --> 02:41:05.117]  And the bottom line is, it's you.
[02:41:05.117 --> 02:41:05.897]  It's me.
[02:41:05.897 --> 02:41:09.620]  It's the Americans that are in their targets.
[02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:18.125]  And the point is, is that when Grateful House said that years ago on The Weather Underground, now the number of people they're talking about taking out on the red list is 50 to 75 million people.
[02:41:20.166 --> 02:41:27.290]  And in those days, Alex, it was one thing to say, well, there's, you know, 300 million Americans with, or 300 million guns in America, blah, blah, blah.
[02:41:27.290 --> 02:41:41.058]  But the drones, and the total information awareness, and the constant surveillance, and the license plate readers, and all that stuff... By the way, here's the new purchases just in the last few days, on top of the 1.4 billion.
[02:41:41.058 --> 02:41:41.618]  The U.S.
[02:41:41.618 --> 02:41:43.660]  Forest Service is asking for another 85,000 rounds.
[02:41:47.074 --> 02:42:02.305]  A .40 caliber, 150,000 rounds of .223, 10,000 cartridges of 12-gauge, 10,000 of other types of 12-gauge, 9mm, .45, .38.
[02:42:02.305 --> 02:42:07.648]  And again, there's so many thousands of pages of these, I can't even read all the stuff they're getting.
[02:42:07.648 --> 02:42:09.289]  I mean, that's just reading one of them.
[02:42:09.289 --> 02:42:13.352]  It's just pouring out the weapon systems to be used against us.
[02:42:13.352 --> 02:42:14.433]  No one can deny that.
[02:42:15.506 --> 02:42:17.889]  Well, right, and here's something coming in while we're on the air.
[02:42:17.889 --> 02:42:19.331]  Someone's listening to us.
[02:42:19.331 --> 02:42:22.475]  He says he's talked to the government contractor for 30 years.
[02:42:22.475 --> 02:42:29.284]  This is just in right now, and they are ordering much more than what is publicly on the FedBizOpps website.
[02:42:29.284 --> 02:42:30.406]  Everything has been told to be
[02:42:30.506 --> 02:42:32.867]  Let me stop you guys typing.
[02:42:32.867 --> 02:42:34.027]  I forgot to cover that yesterday.
[02:42:55.051 --> 02:42:59.934]  The TSA just ordered massive amounts of C4.
[02:42:59.934 --> 02:43:00.835]  It is unbelievable.
[02:43:00.835 --> 02:43:02.276]  We're going to be covering that tonight.
[02:43:02.276 --> 02:43:06.438]  Guys, type in TSA order C4 and they claim it's for training.
[02:43:06.438 --> 02:43:09.780]  You don't need, you need a thimble amount to train dogs.
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:13.483]  You don't need giant, you know, containers of it.
[02:43:14.799 --> 02:43:17.362]  Alex, here's what I want people to understand.
[02:43:17.362 --> 02:43:19.644]  You have to have the mentality now.
[02:43:19.644 --> 02:43:25.551]  You are under an occupation by foreign troops and the enemy is you.
[02:43:25.551 --> 02:43:26.752]  The enemy is me.
[02:43:26.752 --> 02:43:32.579]  Look, I don't get a predator over me at a hundred feet because, you know, they want to show me their newest technology.
[02:43:32.579 --> 02:43:34.061]  That's telling me a message.
[02:43:34.421 --> 02:43:36.964]  When Greg, I gotta tell you something, this is really critical.
[02:43:36.964 --> 02:43:39.626]  If I could say nothing more, this should tell everyone.
[02:43:39.626 --> 02:43:44.531]  I had a lieutenant colonel in my office two years ago in Montana from Northcom.
[02:43:44.531 --> 02:43:46.773]  He was in the psychological operations.
[02:43:46.773 --> 02:43:50.056]  He was a Christian, Alex, and he came with tears in his eyes and he said,
[02:43:50.877 --> 02:43:52.979]  He said, I want to share something with you.
[02:43:52.979 --> 02:43:55.001]  I'm scared for where we're heading.
[02:43:55.001 --> 02:43:57.263]  He said, when you, and he mentioned you, Alex.
[02:43:57.263 --> 02:44:06.691]  He said, the guys that have have warned and mourned, we assign cyber warriors to go out and undermine, to place that they do everything in their power.
[02:44:06.691 --> 02:44:09.073]  But then he said something that startled me, Alex.
[02:44:09.073 --> 02:44:11.876]  He said, Steve, I've seen the plans for the US Air Force.
[02:44:12.216 --> 02:44:12.937]  Two days
[02:44:29.056 --> 02:44:30.897]  And this was separate and apart from me.
[02:44:30.897 --> 02:44:32.078]  He did not know that.
[02:44:32.078 --> 02:44:37.922]  In a very short period of time, he gets a call from one of his general friends, and they call it yard farming.
[02:44:37.922 --> 02:44:38.682]  Okay?
[02:44:38.682 --> 02:44:39.863]  Now, that's innocuous.
[02:44:39.863 --> 02:44:54.492]  Yard farming is basically when they send a hellfire missile through my front door, and the Lord rebuke them, and may all their attempts fail, and may the entire command and communication system for every drone in America that will be used against American people fail.
[02:44:54.492 --> 02:44:57.354]  And I just, in the name of the living God,
[02:44:57.614 --> 02:45:00.096]  Made all their communications fail with those things.
[02:45:00.096 --> 02:45:06.121]  But the bottom line, Alex, is that yard farming, now that sounds like, well, gee, that sounds innocuous.
[02:45:06.121 --> 02:45:19.031]  So, again, how is it that the very military now has, and now it becomes problematic because you just threw up on your screen, or told your guys to throw up on the screen, the general of the Russian
[02:45:19.971 --> 02:45:20.632]  We're good to go.
[02:45:41.954 --> 02:45:42.274]  I don't think so.
[02:45:59.091 --> 02:45:59.471]  We're good.
[02:46:13.140 --> 02:46:22.543]  Now, we've been close to crises before, and I agree there's a lot of stuff lined up, a lot of sources, police are being told big stuff's gonna happen.
[02:46:22.543 --> 02:46:27.004]  But, you know, there's been evidence of things gonna happen in the past that didn't happen.
[02:46:27.004 --> 02:46:32.846]  And I believe talking about this does help reduce the fact that it, you know, could take place.
[02:46:32.846 --> 02:46:39.768]  I mean, I think a false flag, a financial collapse, that is probable, unless we get the word out.
[02:46:39.768 --> 02:46:42.129]  But, I mean, my goodness.
[02:46:43.274 --> 02:46:44.195]  I mean, how would it work?
[02:46:44.195 --> 02:46:45.837]  A false flag goes off.
[02:46:45.837 --> 02:46:47.818]  They say domestic groups did it.
[02:46:47.818 --> 02:46:49.560]  Oh, don't worry, the foreign troops are going to help.
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:52.623]  I mean, I know that's in all the declassified admissions now.
[02:46:52.623 --> 02:46:55.086]  Since NLE09, they've admitted it.
[02:46:55.086 --> 02:46:57.888]  I've talked to army officers on air where they're trained to work with foreign troops.
[02:46:57.888 --> 02:47:04.995]  I've been to urban warfare drills where they train with troops from six nations to take on the West Coast and confiscate guns and put us in camps.
[02:47:04.995 --> 02:47:06.477]  It's in my film, Police Day 2000, free online.
[02:47:08.038 --> 02:47:22.026]  So yes, I mean, I know it, but still, I just don't... People are so mind-controlled, though, they might tell, you know, the general public that if you're not for the foreign occupation, you're a terrorist, your neighbors might rat you out.
[02:47:22.026 --> 02:47:22.566]  Of course, right?
[02:47:22.566 --> 02:47:24.608]  Neighbors are ratting out each other right now.
[02:47:24.608 --> 02:47:29.510]  Look at Jason, the first guy that was arrested because somebody heard him on talk radio.
[02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:31.111]  Jason was a talk show host.
[02:47:31.111 --> 02:47:32.292]  I think you carried this story.
[02:47:32.612 --> 02:47:35.354]  We've had him on the show, he had a popular show, he came and got arrested.
[02:47:35.354 --> 02:47:38.997]  We have the Rob fellow, Brandon Robb.
[02:47:38.997 --> 02:47:43.840]  Yeah, and then the other guy, there's another guy named Don M, he's the one I posted that I think you linked to.
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:48.243]  The bottom line is, here's what I want to share with you, Alex Jones, okay?
[02:47:48.243 --> 02:47:51.866]  You're, you're, you're, and this is a good word.
[02:47:51.866 --> 02:48:00.912]  You are so on the tip of the spear, but remember this, like an icebreaker, it's the bow of the ship that has to break the ice so the others can follow.
[02:48:01.352 --> 02:48:20.448]  But again, the hardest thing, and Alex, I gotta admit, this is the hardest thing for me too, so I'm just saying, someone who does what you do, this is the hardest thing for me, to understand that the very military that have taken the oath to defend our nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic, are now, the ones that are left, are now in collusion
[02:48:20.908 --> 02:48:31.677]  With the invading armies that are here, and by the way, I said four weeks, so the prophecy that's on my website, amazing prophetic word of the Lord from Brother Marcus, the bottom line is this guy's got something that's real.
[02:48:31.677 --> 02:48:39.303]  It's not the typical flaky stuff, and there's so much stuff on the internet, but what's amazing to me is it lays out the next three months.
[02:48:39.303 --> 02:48:40.124]  I said four weeks.
[02:48:40.124 --> 02:48:40.704]  Three months.
[02:48:40.704 --> 02:48:44.707]  It also deals with the next four weeks, and I would encourage everybody to go to that.
[02:48:45.788 --> 02:49:05.272]  He's moving everybody who has discernment that we're at a key point here and that we're all in great danger because of the financial situation, the Iran situation, the funding of Al-Qaeda, the 10,000 Libyan missiles they got, and the government arming against us and demonizing us.
[02:49:05.272 --> 02:49:09.093]  I just find it hard to believe that they're going to actually pull the trigger.
[02:49:10.616 --> 02:49:12.898]  I know you did, but again, can I be blunt?
[02:49:12.898 --> 02:49:13.899]  There was a lot of stuff.
[02:49:13.899 --> 02:49:15.160]  For instance, Genetic Armageddon.
[02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:16.922]  You brought it up, and I know we're coming out on that.
[02:49:16.922 --> 02:49:27.972]  When I wrote Genetic Armageddon about the transhumanists and the desire for them to totally destroy the image and likeness of the living God as we were created, and I started talking about, obviously, super soldiers.
[02:49:27.972 --> 02:49:29.934]  Everybody's, you know, the boards were filled.
[02:49:29.934 --> 02:49:32.236]  Ha ha, what a joke, what a crazy guy.
[02:49:32.236 --> 02:49:34.518]  You know, the bottom line is... Now it's all admitted.
[02:49:34.518 --> 02:49:35.179]  It's all been admitted.
[02:49:35.639 --> 02:49:36.259]  It's all admitted.
[02:49:36.259 --> 02:49:57.964]  So what I'm trying to tell you is this, is that when Greg and I did the show last night with Doug Hagman, and as I'm doing the show with you and you had on Doug the hour before I came on, the bottom line is that tension and the panic in law enforcement and the intelligence community and guys going out into fields, not me, I don't meet anybody, any place, any time.
[02:49:57.964 --> 02:49:59.945]  That's just my own security protocol.
[02:50:00.886 --> 02:50:03.428]  I violated it once and it almost cost me my life.
[02:50:03.428 --> 02:50:15.180]  The bottom line is, is that given the fact of everything, the preponderance of evidence, Alex, it's not only the scales that have to come off a man's eyes, it's the scales that have to come off our heart.
[02:50:15.180 --> 02:50:17.542]  These are the issues we're trying to resolve
[02:50:17.982 --> 02:50:18.562]  I think?
[02:50:38.848 --> 02:50:40.309]  Well, that's all admitted.
[02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:44.931]  I just don't see them phase one in a collapse, bringing in the foreign troops.
[02:50:44.931 --> 02:50:57.356]  From what I've studied, they would bring in the collapse, then stage false flags, blame it on domestic groups, let the police and military be chewed up in a fight with the people, then they bring in the I-4 NATO forces, and that's on record.
[02:50:57.356 --> 02:50:59.857]  No matter how crazy it sounds, that is the plan.
[02:50:59.857 --> 02:51:00.277]  We'll be back.
[02:51:01.351 --> 02:51:08.495]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:51:08.495 --> 02:51:26.226]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:51:26.226 --> 02:51:30.329]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:51:30.609 --> 02:51:32.330]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:51:32.330 --> 02:51:40.434]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[02:51:47.958 --> 02:51:48.838]  It's incredible.

[02:52:30.285 --> 02:52:31.526]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:52:31.526 --> 02:52:36.089]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:52:36.089 --> 02:52:41.913]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:52:41.913 --> 02:52:45.535]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:52:45.535 --> 02:52:48.377]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:48.377 --> 02:52:53.320]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:52:53.320 --> 02:52:53.621]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:53.621 --> 02:52:54.982]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:53:01.846 --> 02:53:07.690]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[02:53:07.690 --> 02:53:13.154]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[02:53:13.154 --> 02:53:15.336]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[02:53:15.336 --> 02:53:22.621]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[02:53:23.121 --> 02:53:26.823]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[02:53:26.823 --> 02:53:31.065]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[02:53:31.065 --> 02:53:37.728]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[02:53:37.728 --> 02:53:40.710]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:43.731]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[02:53:43.731 --> 02:53:47.353]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[02:53:47.353 --> 02:53:49.774]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[02:53:50.294 --> 02:53:55.276]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[02:53:55.276 --> 02:54:01.659]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[02:54:01.659 --> 02:54:09.563]  This is the end.
[02:54:09.563 --> 02:54:16.085]  Beautiful prayer.
[02:54:16.085 --> 02:54:17.086]  This is the end.
[02:54:24.503 --> 02:54:25.964]  No safety!
[02:54:25.964 --> 02:54:26.645]  I'll never... again...
[02:54:48.905 --> 02:54:51.406]  Listen folks, we can disagree about timelines.
[02:54:51.406 --> 02:54:52.786]  It's mainstream news.
[02:54:52.786 --> 02:54:58.949]  They train with troops from 15 nations to take on domestic terrorists who they say are our veterans and gun owners.
[02:54:58.949 --> 02:55:00.469]  That's hot treason.
[02:55:00.469 --> 02:55:01.570]  It is public.
[02:55:02.583 --> 02:55:05.025]  That they're arming with all these weapons against us.
[02:55:05.025 --> 02:55:07.167]  It's public, they're setting up face scanning.
[02:55:07.167 --> 02:55:12.631]  So I'm hearing Steve Quayle, and he's talking about all this evidence and stuff, he's been talking about it forever, and I'm hoping he's wrong.
[02:55:12.631 --> 02:55:16.174]  I think we can disagree on timelines, but definitely stuff's getting weird.
[02:55:16.174 --> 02:55:20.978]  And I hope that he's wrong, I hope that none of this unfolds.
[02:55:20.978 --> 02:55:25.661]  But I know he wouldn't be out here saying all this if he and his heart didn't think things were being greenlighted for this.
[02:55:25.661 --> 02:55:28.503]  I just know, I talked to a billionaire lady off record,
[02:55:29.284 --> 02:55:29.625]  I don't know.
[02:55:41.414 --> 02:55:43.415]  And I just happened to run into her in a lawyer's office.
[02:55:43.415 --> 02:55:46.296]  I was there filing some stuff at the big law firm in town.
[02:55:46.296 --> 02:55:48.896]  She had like 50 lawyers, and she was a listener.
[02:55:48.896 --> 02:55:52.378]  And I went and checked who she was after and was like, wow, that really is who she said.
[02:55:52.378 --> 02:55:56.719]  I was like, hmm, why'd you tell me that?
[02:55:56.719 --> 02:55:59.760]  I wish I would have asked more, though.
[02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:00.560]  This is crazy.
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:02.421]  This is like before World War I or World War II.
[02:56:02.981 --> 02:56:17.830]  Everything's lining up for that, so I don't know what's going to happen in the details, but Steve, I hope you're wrong, but you've got, you know, Hagman's sources, I've got police calling and crying, later confirmed with other high-level police, they're told all, you know, what's going to break loose.
[02:56:17.830 --> 02:56:20.631]  I mean, what are your sources saying?
[02:56:20.631 --> 02:56:23.013]  How will this start if indeed they pull the trigger?
[02:56:24.210 --> 02:56:27.931]  Alex, they all say it started, or you wouldn't have seen it implemented.
[02:56:27.931 --> 02:56:32.952]  But when it really gets bad, as on the financial collapse, I've got to spell it out to you.
[02:56:32.952 --> 02:56:40.395]  Imagine everybody in the United States not being able to access their bank accounts, access their credit cards, access their ATM machines.
[02:56:40.395 --> 02:56:42.035]  Imagine the trucks stopping.
[02:56:42.035 --> 02:56:46.796]  Imagine the people who are used to government subsidies being stopped.
[02:56:46.796 --> 02:56:47.757]  It's going to be across the board.
[02:56:47.757 --> 02:56:49.197]  This is going to be affecting everyone.
[02:56:49.557 --> 02:57:02.490]  And then imagine that the gangs that, and you and I talked about this 10 years ago, the gangs that have been given the guns, and oh by the way, I was a crazy when I was talking about all the Chinese arms being shipped into the gangs on the West Coast.
[02:57:02.490 --> 02:57:12.820]  You said it before it was even in the LA Times, and you, I know I wish I could think that you were crazy, you said that they were, the government was arming gangs nationwide and now that's admitted.
[02:57:13.379 --> 02:57:16.620]  Right, so the point is that here's the thing.
[02:57:16.620 --> 02:57:26.265]  The interesting issue that everybody's got to come to grips with, and really has to come to grips with, is look, I don't know the timing, and I will agree with you on one thing.
[02:57:26.265 --> 02:57:34.508]  In the world of special operations, when an operation is made known, everybody cuts contact with that operation.
[02:57:34.508 --> 02:57:38.050]  But the bottom line is that we have the U.S.
[02:57:38.050 --> 02:57:40.971]  complicit, and I'm talking about the military establishment right now,
[02:57:41.491 --> 02:57:52.580]  With the implementation of martial law, the roundups, the assassinations, everything else, but what they are not getting, look, I was the source, and I think this is what you've got to do and I've got to do.
[02:57:52.580 --> 02:58:07.052]  If I've been right, and if my sources have been unfailing, and the ultimate source has been God calling me to be a watchman and proclaiming because God says his people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, and I don't care what a person's position is, they can't argue.
[02:58:07.052 --> 02:58:09.854]  Look, 15 years ago, I was telling people this stuff was happening.
[02:58:10.054 --> 02:58:12.616]  Now a lot of people are writing books on it and everything.
[02:58:12.616 --> 02:58:13.716]  I don't care about that.
[02:58:13.716 --> 02:58:21.161]  But what I'm saying is, if it's taken people 15 years to get where I was 15 years ago, I'm trying to tell people what comes next.
[02:58:21.161 --> 02:58:28.485]  But the total financial collapse coordinated with an attack on Washington, D.C.
[02:58:28.485 --> 02:58:34.189]  and several other major cities, the potential for an EMP attack... Okay, well I want to hear the chain of events.
[02:58:34.189 --> 02:58:34.529]  Stay there.
[02:58:34.529 --> 02:58:37.771]  Let's do five more minutes so you can finish up with Steve Quayle.

[02:59:52.070 --> 02:59:55.654]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.654 --> 02:59:58.858]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:02.346 --> 03:00:08.279]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:00:08.279 --> 03:00:10.825]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:15.527 --> 03:00:27.891]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 29th day of August 2012, and we got foreign troops crawling all over us, government buying billions of rounds of ammo, giant black tanks, armored vehicles.
[03:00:27.891 --> 03:00:30.932]  They're on the news saying, look out, the gun owners and veterans are terrorists.
[03:00:30.932 --> 03:00:31.832]  They're the enemy.
[03:00:31.832 --> 03:00:34.093]  They're going to attack any minute.
[03:00:34.093 --> 03:00:36.193]  I mean, it's just total bizarreness.
[03:00:36.193 --> 03:00:41.995]  We've got judges out in places, you know, in Texas saying they're going to fight the new world order.
[03:00:41.995 --> 03:00:44.676]  I mean, it's just, it's entering just crazy land.
[03:00:45.717 --> 03:00:48.780]  Uh, and I wish it wasn't all happening.
[03:00:48.780 --> 03:00:52.924]  We've got all these different sources saying get ready for all Haitis to break loose in September.
[03:00:52.924 --> 03:00:54.305]  We got about five minutes left.
[03:00:54.305 --> 03:00:57.208]  Steve, lay out from your sources how this would unfold.
[03:00:57.208 --> 03:01:02.514]  Uh, you know, cyber attack, things go down, riots, uh, and then what we begged for the troops?
[03:01:02.514 --> 03:01:03.435]  I mean, what happens?
[03:01:03.868 --> 03:01:10.291]  Well, they want a two to four week period where everybody turns loose on everybody.
[03:01:10.291 --> 03:01:18.935]  By the way, Alex, concurrent with this, the internet goes down, all communications go dead, except the military communications and their high rack and all their new trunk system.
[03:01:18.935 --> 03:01:24.938]  And by the way, they know every single police officer, his allegiance, his alliance and his stuff.
[03:01:24.938 --> 03:01:31.341]  So let's say a police force has a hundred officers and five of them are considered, they're not team players.
[03:01:31.341 --> 03:01:33.042]  In other words, they won't go along with the New World Order.
[03:01:33.482 --> 03:01:36.505]  The five will be locked out of the trunk communication system.
[03:01:36.505 --> 03:01:38.226]  Everything's digital.
[03:01:38.226 --> 03:01:39.367]  95 people get the order.
[03:01:39.367 --> 03:01:42.449]  The five guys will be set up for the other 95.
[03:01:42.449 --> 03:01:45.592]  The blue list goes into effect.
[03:01:45.592 --> 03:01:49.755]  That's when the foreign troops have their pre-assigned targets to assassinate.
[03:01:49.755 --> 03:01:51.276]  By the way, let me tell you something.
[03:01:51.276 --> 03:01:59.322]  When I started talking about GPSing the front doors for Hellfire Missiles, a former helicopter gunship pilot called me and he said,
[03:02:00.263 --> 03:02:06.585]  He said, we have sealed orders and we have all our targets assigned to us in the areas that we'll be dispatched from.
[03:02:06.585 --> 03:02:12.667]  So understand, Alex... Well, pilots have complained that they've been ordered to go around and practice attacking U.S.
[03:02:12.667 --> 03:02:14.607]  cities, not just for foreign targeting.
[03:02:14.607 --> 03:02:15.668]  They're practicing for U.S.
[03:02:15.668 --> 03:02:15.968]  cities.
[03:02:16.448 --> 03:02:17.189]  Well, we're U.S.
[03:02:17.189 --> 03:02:24.396]  individuals, and I mean, you said the other day, I think, when we were on your TV show, that you had, you know, you saw a drone over you.
[03:02:24.396 --> 03:02:28.480]  And the point is, here's what I'm trying to get across to everybody, okay?
[03:02:28.480 --> 03:02:37.369]  If what's obvious, now look, what's obvious, you know, everybody's hoping, and this is where I, hope is good, but misplaced hope is maddening.
[03:02:37.369 --> 03:02:38.991]  What will make a difference?
[03:02:38.991 --> 03:02:40.252]  Here's what will make a difference.
[03:02:40.692 --> 03:02:48.961]  If every man, woman, and fighting person in the military and in the police departments understands.
[03:02:48.961 --> 03:02:51.524]  That's why I spend the time I do.
[03:02:51.524 --> 03:02:52.805]  That's why you spend.
[03:02:52.805 --> 03:02:54.527]  And you're already on a list if you're a patriot.
[03:02:54.527 --> 03:02:55.468]  They already know.
[03:02:55.468 --> 03:02:59.992]  So speak out now and pray and let everybody know that there is a takeover happening.
[03:02:59.992 --> 03:03:02.035]  Because no one can deny the takeover is here.
[03:03:02.035 --> 03:03:03.236]  The question is how severe is it?
[03:03:03.598 --> 03:03:04.739]  Well, can I tell you something?
[03:03:04.739 --> 03:03:05.920]  It's terminally severe.
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:18.669]  You, Alex Jones, cannot interview Grace Wall from the weather underground days and then see all of those same people now coming into play, the mentors of the current administration and all of Obama's hierarchy.
[03:03:18.669 --> 03:03:20.190]  You cannot have a national law.
[03:03:20.190 --> 03:03:24.654]  Listen, the man of perdition, the Bible talks about, is lawlessness.
[03:03:24.654 --> 03:03:28.476]  And lawlessness is defined as each man doing that's what's right in his own sight.
[03:03:28.476 --> 03:03:30.378]  And now you've got people saying that, look,
[03:03:30.798 --> 03:03:45.969]  The Constitution's irrelevant, the Bill of Rights is irrelevant, and to the degree that our Founding Fathers said it's designed for immoral people and the people lose their morality, that's why the effective communist protocols and globalist mind-speak and mind-control.
[03:03:45.969 --> 03:03:52.474]  By the way, concurrent with all this going down, getting back to your question, that's when they turn on the Gwen Towers, okay?
[03:03:52.474 --> 03:03:57.178]  The electromagnetic, if you will, numbing and dumbing down the mind-control.
[03:03:57.718 --> 03:04:10.959]  Well they admitted in the major paper, it was the Baltimore Sun, 12 years ago they bragged the CIA and DARPA had set up, with the tower, systems that can manipulate our minds and calm us.
[03:04:10.959 --> 03:04:12.041]  That was in the newspaper.
[03:04:12.620 --> 03:04:13.160]  Absolutely!
[03:04:13.160 --> 03:04:16.522]  Under 4 Hertz you go to sleep, over 6 Hertz you go agitated.
[03:04:16.522 --> 03:04:23.807]  And that's where, and please everybody, this is not a pitch, but you've got to read my zombie series on my website.
[03:04:23.807 --> 03:04:35.794]  This is Alex when they articulate, when they integrate the radio frequency, when they turn on the power to basically energize a lot of the stuff that's been put into the chemtrails, Frank.
[03:04:35.794 --> 03:04:41.677]  I mean, they're not only talking about zombie protocols, they're talking about generating the zombie apocalypse.
[03:04:41.877 --> 03:04:45.218]  And by that you're talking about a bunch of people out of their minds running around crazy.
[03:04:45.218 --> 03:04:47.519]  They can do that spraying PCP on people too.
[03:04:47.519 --> 03:04:48.340]  Amazing!
[03:04:48.340 --> 03:04:51.041]  Steve Quill, we've got to talk more as this unfolds.
[03:04:51.041 --> 03:04:52.462]  His website is SteveQuill.com.
[03:04:52.462 --> 03:04:54.482]  I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com.

[03:04:57.984 --> 03:04:59.605]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
