[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:40.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.360 --> 00:49.080]  we are live ladies and gentlemen it is Friday the 15th day of May 2009 we're
[00:49.080 --> 00:55.320]  gonna be here live for the next four hours coming up we'll get another update
[00:55.320 --> 01:01.480]  from Jim Tucker from the scene of 2009 Bilderberg in a suburb on the coastline
[01:01.480 --> 01:07.400]  of Athens Greece then we have London Guardian reporter Charlie Skelton we
[01:07.400 --> 01:13.480]  had on yesterday from the police station he's been arrested twice and this
[01:13.480 --> 01:16.840]  isn't even really getting any mainstream media attention there is a news
[01:16.840 --> 01:23.080]  blackout in the United States now there are scores of articles in every major
[01:23.080 --> 01:35.400]  British paper German papers French Israeli Russian Spanish Portuguese Greek
[01:35.400 --> 01:39.040]  admitting they're the world elite admitting that Obama's in their hip
[01:39.040 --> 01:41.880]  pocket admitting that they've engineered the crisis admitting they're
[01:41.880 --> 01:53.880]  setting up world government it is all there but nothing in the United States
[01:53.880 --> 01:59.600]  press the first time in recent years I've actually seen it in the media in the
[01:59.600 --> 02:02.800]  United States where they didn't say it didn't exist was about two months ago
[02:02.800 --> 02:07.320]  month and a half ago the story in Politico they then got picked up by CBS
[02:07.320 --> 02:11.600]  News and actually cited prison planet comm and info wars comm and our
[02:11.600 --> 02:15.200]  reporting in the past and that was actually one of the first mainstream
[02:15.200 --> 02:18.840]  fair articles ever but there's got to be a news blackout here in the United
[02:18.840 --> 02:22.120]  States now because you would think that having Tim Geithner head of the
[02:22.120 --> 02:27.000]  Treasury meeting secretly with other foreign bank heads and private bank
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.200]  owners to chart the future of the planet would be news much more important
[02:33.200 --> 02:39.440]  than the public Davos meeting that's a media extravaganza feeding frenzy but
[02:39.440 --> 02:47.520]  no coverage of this that's another big issue so we got Paul Watson coming on
[02:47.520 --> 02:57.880]  it turns out that a Dutch politician a member of their parliament is
[02:57.880 --> 03:05.280]  criticizing Queen Beatrix who publicly goes to Bilderberg and he's asking them
[03:05.280 --> 03:09.160]  what's really going on on the agenda there and does this violate some of the
[03:09.160 --> 03:13.920]  laws that they have in the Netherlands you know we have the Logan Act here in
[03:13.920 --> 03:18.320]  the United States that states that it's illegal for government officials
[03:18.320 --> 03:23.760]  without the express authorization of Congress or the president to go conduct
[03:23.760 --> 03:29.720]  public business behind closed doors with private interest and that is
[03:29.720 --> 03:37.280]  definitely what is happening so Dutch Prime Minister grilled over Bilderberg
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.480]  following prison planet article it's cited by the member of the Dutch
[03:42.480 --> 03:49.320]  Parliament as his source for knowing after the Dutch Prime Minister again
[03:49.320 --> 03:52.600]  being grilled over Bilderberg following prison planet article that's one key
[03:52.600 --> 03:57.360]  headline at prisonplanet.com and other one is government ready's youth

[04:34.000 --> 04:37.600]  disgruntled vets and in the photo captions from New York Times it
[04:37.600 --> 04:42.560]  said it has the police officers and Homeland Security saying look go in kill
[04:42.560 --> 04:47.680]  that you know kill the shooter that's the first thing you do so they're being

[08:38.320 --> 08:47.400]  Greece I'm gonna play a video clip from the web there's a bunch of these clips
[08:47.400 --> 08:52.560]  there's literally hundreds that I've seen of police all over England all over
[08:52.560 --> 08:56.360]  England you'll have a family out videotaping their children jumping around
[08:56.360 --> 09:00.200]  you know at a public pool police walk over and say that's an act of
[09:00.200 --> 09:06.840]  terrorism you're not allowed to videotape you'll have police coming up to
[09:06.840 --> 09:11.240]  somebody's front yard telling them that they want to look in their rubbish bin
[09:11.240 --> 09:13.760]  or something they'll walk out with a camera and say what do you want officers
[09:13.760 --> 09:18.000]  and they'll say turn the camera off it's a crime and there'd been hundreds of
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.200]  these videos in the last few years but there was no law they would just say it's
[09:23.200 --> 09:26.240]  an act of terrorism I'm gonna arrest you and they would arrest you and then
[09:26.240 --> 09:28.960]  then then the person would have to be freed and the police would get in
[09:28.960 --> 09:34.240]  trouble well then about four months ago they passed a law saying that it's up
[09:34.240 --> 09:38.720]  to police discretion and that it's a terrorism charge all these years in
[09:38.720 --> 09:44.040]  prison huge fines if you videotape police car wrecks police stopping you
[09:44.040 --> 09:48.800]  police doing anything it's up to their discretion whether they believe it could
[09:48.800 --> 09:57.840]  be used in terrorism now remember London has four million cameras in it alone
[09:57.840 --> 10:02.000]  surveilling the people they're putting satellite tracker boxes in the cars to
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.000]  tax you and track you and control your speed by the mile we talked about this
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.880]  10 years ago and they denied they were doing it they're not proposing it here
[10:09.880 --> 10:13.960]  and they're already trying to push the same thing I think I've seen scores of
[10:13.960 --> 10:19.160]  stories where people photograph bridges buildings their kids baseball game
[10:19.160 --> 10:25.000]  police come up arrest them say it's an act of terrorism architecture students
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.680]  are told to go out and take pictures of bridges in San Francisco they get
[10:27.680 --> 10:32.280]  arrested Amtrak puts out a national ad you know promising thousands of dollars
[10:32.280 --> 10:36.400]  of prizes to take photos of Amtrak trains people get arrested on the trains
[10:36.400 --> 10:41.440]  off the trains at the train stations mothers 14 year olds it's all over the
[10:41.440 --> 10:45.160]  news with Amtrak alone just oh you've got your digital camera out taking a
[10:45.160 --> 10:48.960]  picture of an Amtrak train well yeah it's part of the national you know it's a
[10:48.960 --> 10:52.640]  huge I think was like a I forget the articles a month or so ago the last one
[10:52.640 --> 10:56.800]  I saw I think was like some $50,000 prize guys pull that up Amtrak
[10:56.800 --> 11:04.720]  photography hey guys guys we pull up Amtrak photography contest arrest just
[11:04.720 --> 11:09.360]  search that term Amtrak photography arrest it was some huge amount of money
[11:09.360 --> 11:15.360]  so people are all over trying to win the prize and they get arrested of course
[11:15.360 --> 11:19.600]  the photo ops are okay when it's the Air Force one flying through the middle
[11:19.600 --> 11:24.600]  of lower Manhattan with F-16s 50 yards from buildings look I'm already
[11:24.600 --> 11:33.240]  digressing the point is is that when they pass the law in Parliament they
[11:33.240 --> 11:39.040]  said don't worry this is only for real terrorist and now the videos are pouring
[11:39.040 --> 11:47.120]  in you'll have a family out videotaping and there'll be a US Embassy or a
[11:47.120 --> 11:51.080]  government building or just police at a park it doesn't matter where you are or
[11:51.080 --> 11:55.360]  a family trying to videotape Big Ben and by the way this happened to me before
[11:55.360 --> 11:57.800]  they even had the law they walk over and say what are you doing big Ben I'm
[11:57.800 --> 12:03.160]  like is that a joke I don't want you take cameras up on the the eye the London
[12:03.160 --> 12:07.200]  Eye the big Ferris wheel because it could be an act of terrorism and you can be
[12:07.200 --> 12:11.560]  trying to get terror photos I mean this is a joke they don't want us videotaping
[12:11.560 --> 12:17.400]  them see they want to put cameras in school bathrooms and in rest areas in
[12:17.400 --> 12:21.440]  Michigan and Texas and they want to thumb scan you to buy and sell and they
[12:21.440 --> 12:25.800]  want to have satellite tracker boxes in your cars and license plate reading
[12:25.800 --> 12:30.240]  scanners everywhere and they want you to go through the airport and take your
[12:30.240 --> 12:32.920]  shoes off and be searched and photographed and videotaped and have your
[12:32.920 --> 12:37.080]  body scanned biometrically with a naked 360 image of it and put the computer
[12:37.080 --> 12:43.000]  database and they want to take your DNA at checkpoints all over the nation now
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.960]  forcibly taking blood and saying that we can put GPS trackers on your cars
[12:46.960 --> 12:52.800]  without warrants I mean it's all happening but they want to charge you with
[12:52.800 --> 12:58.280]  terrorism if you're say on the Oakland subway and you're in another train and
[12:58.280 --> 13:01.520]  you see him slam a black guy's face down the ground and put him in handcuffs and
[13:01.520 --> 13:07.160]  executing and the cops say that all the train subway cameras malfunction and
[13:07.160 --> 13:10.120]  then it's actually on video as they confiscate people's cameras that were
[13:10.120 --> 13:14.320]  taping it but they didn't confiscate the camera in the train on the other side
[13:14.320 --> 13:18.120]  of the platform that then pulled away and then it turns out the cop gets
[13:18.120 --> 13:23.800]  indicted and they get in trouble they don't want you videotaping what they're
[13:23.800 --> 13:28.280]  doing and they are making it a crime and I saw this incredible video minutes
[13:28.280 --> 13:33.520]  where I went on air of these armed US embassy thugs running over to a British
[13:33.520 --> 13:38.360]  citizen and British cops come over and say you'll be charged with terrorism
[13:38.360 --> 13:44.680]  give me your camera and this happened at the g20 people videotaping cops dressed
[13:44.680 --> 13:48.280]  up like anarchists attacking cops and knocking out windows they would come up
[13:48.280 --> 13:51.840]  and say you can't videotape it's an act of terrorism and they ran up and
[13:51.840 --> 13:57.160]  confiscated cameras of people that saw them beat a newspaper delivery man he
[13:57.160 --> 14:01.600]  just deliver newspapers they run over to the middle-aged guy he says hey I've
[14:01.600 --> 14:05.200]  done nothing I'm delivering papers and they say you know what we're gonna beat
[14:05.200 --> 14:08.720]  you to death and they beat him the cops are laughing they beat him in the head
[14:08.720 --> 14:12.040]  bloods pouring out he goes over collapses and dies and they have one of
[14:12.040 --> 14:16.400]  their little you know government coroners say the guy died of a heart
[14:16.400 --> 14:20.080]  attack the family went got another autopsy and they killed him and the
[14:20.080 --> 14:24.200]  witnesses came forward how their videos were taken they beat that guy to death
[14:24.200 --> 14:27.720]  and they and of course all their cameras malfunctioned a call that was
[14:27.720 --> 14:31.160]  another just like when they killed you know a guy the other day and shot

[15:35.960 --> 15:38.640]  away from barricades and the cop runs over and starts screaming at me and

[16:35.120 --> 16:42.080]  of Human Rights passed by every major signatory to the UN Charter and it

[24:37.360 --> 24:41.440]  you the news articles they were few and far between then we got school
[24:41.440 --> 24:47.080]  documents we're all over the nation you think your kids are getting all a nice
[24:47.080 --> 24:52.120]  law enforcement course when you're in sixth or seventh grade most schools have
[24:52.120 --> 24:57.560]  them ladies and gentlemen they have the kids right dossiers on you they brain
[24:57.560 --> 25:01.760]  wash the kids against your family and they also train them to take on gun
[25:01.760 --> 25:08.040]  owners and veterans now we write a lot of documents over the years that stated
[25:08.040 --> 25:11.000]  the same thing as the myac report and the homeland security report that we
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.520]  also broke in the last two months but people still wouldn't believe us because
[25:14.520 --> 25:18.720]  it wasn't on Fox News and CNN now it is so folks believe me well hidden in
[25:18.720 --> 25:23.640]  plain view in the New York Times they said all over the country the Boy Scouts
[25:23.640 --> 25:28.080]  are training to take on and kill veterans and of course they pose it in a way
[25:28.080 --> 25:34.320]  where it sounds reasonable it's a rogue veteran out shooting people don't these
[25:34.320 --> 25:39.320]  kids realize they're being trained to kill people who were just like them and
[25:39.320 --> 25:42.880]  then there'll be those trained to kill them and that's truly how a hardcore
[25:42.880 --> 25:46.440]  Soviet system works the Nazis did it too but that that's coming up with Paul
[25:46.440 --> 25:51.440]  Watson got a key article up on prisonplanet.com Paul Watson there's
[25:51.440 --> 25:58.640]  been a bunch of articles last few weeks in Politico CBS newspapers and letters
[25:58.640 --> 26:02.480]  you know being written by members of parliament in the Netherlands with Queen
[26:02.480 --> 26:08.400]  Beatrix's father being the founder Prince Bernhard the Nazi but this is
[26:08.400 --> 26:11.680]  amazing I mean prison planet is really getting a lot of attention paid to it
[26:11.680 --> 26:18.240]  and if you click Google News I guess they haven't censored this yet all the top
[26:18.240 --> 26:22.240]  stories are prison planet they're above the Times of London they're above
[26:22.240 --> 26:27.840]  Haritz they're above literally scores of major newspapers this is very exciting
[26:27.840 --> 26:35.480]  Paul indeed it is Alex and you know if there were the same amount of media
[26:35.480 --> 26:40.680]  outlets corporate media outlets that reported on Bilderberg as reported on
[26:40.680 --> 26:45.200]  something like the G8 then we wouldn't be at the top of Google because
[26:45.200 --> 26:48.560]  everybody else will be reporting on it but because nobody is and there's a
[26:48.560 --> 26:54.000]  blackout in the US media not one single report on Bilderberg this year then
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.520]  we're starting to get all the attention and now in the form of questions being
[26:59.520 --> 27:05.600]  asked in the Dutch parliament about Queen Beatrix and the Prime Minister of
[27:05.600 --> 27:13.200]  Holland involvement with Bilderberg it's amazing these are formal request and
[27:13.200 --> 27:16.640]  we know their finance ministers of the Netherlands always are in attendance
[27:16.640 --> 27:20.480]  they were on the list last year Geithner was on the list last year when he was
[27:20.480 --> 27:23.400]  pretty much already running the White House that's now admitted that he was
[27:23.400 --> 27:27.880]  already telling Paulson what to do and that's what Obama deception tries to
[27:27.880 --> 27:32.320]  expose is that this is a seamless integration but still the Obama
[27:32.320 --> 27:36.240]  supporters on the different Obama deception videos that are up on YouTube
[27:36.240 --> 27:40.200]  and Google they sit there commenting going all you Republicans lost haha
[27:40.200 --> 27:44.920]  you're just racist and don't like Obama don't you idiots get it he's now
[27:44.920 --> 27:48.880]  announced the torture and secret arrest and indefinite detention continues he
[27:48.880 --> 27:53.200]  hired nothing but lobbyist he's expanding the wars don't you idiots get it
[27:53.200 --> 27:57.840]  that we're not with George Bush you stinking morons I mean how stupid are
[27:57.840 --> 28:04.040]  these people but we wrote an article a few days after that well it was the day
[28:04.040 --> 28:10.000]  after the election I believe and we set Obama a series of challenges and asked
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.880]  if on each different issue he could reverse what the Bush administration
[28:14.880 --> 28:19.840]  had done and then we revisited it about a month ago and on every single issue he
[28:19.840 --> 28:23.440]  not only continued what Bush had done but he'd done it to an even greater
[28:23.440 --> 28:30.800]  degree so talk about change but the one we're talking about today is this the
[28:30.800 --> 28:38.160]  Dutch parliament article bit of recent history the prime minister of the
[28:38.160 --> 28:43.520]  Netherlands whose name is Balkan Ender I don't know the pronunciation but that's
[28:43.520 --> 28:50.760]  what it looks like to me he became prime minister in July 2002 it was appointed
[28:50.760 --> 28:55.080]  he was asked by Queen Beatrix to form a new government because the previous
[28:55.080 --> 29:00.120]  government had collapsed into disarray because of infighting which is
[29:00.120 --> 29:06.160]  interesting because that government was supposed to have been mainly headed up
[29:06.160 --> 29:09.960]  it was a coalition government but he would have had a major voice in it as
[29:09.960 --> 29:16.320]  one of the parties in this coalition government by a man called Pym 14 who
[29:16.320 --> 29:24.600]  was vehemently anti EU anti Bilderberg populist candidate for prime minister and
[29:24.600 --> 29:29.840]  it looked like he was going to win in the spring of 2002 before he was
[29:29.840 --> 29:35.720]  assassinated and this later led to the Dutch prime minister Balkan Ender
[29:35.720 --> 29:40.760]  becoming the new prime minister after he was appointed by the Queen all right
[29:40.760 --> 29:44.960]  stay there but the Queen has no power she just runs everything we'll be right

[34:25.600 --> 34:30.360]  children if you don't have children let me tell you something this isn't some
[34:30.360 --> 34:34.640]  boss-hog tyranny we're dealing with this is hardcore scientific eugenics
[34:34.640 --> 34:38.920]  tyranny and that's why they pull out all the stops they mean business Boy Scouts
[34:38.920 --> 34:44.360]  trained to become homeland Gestapo hurt Nemo's article yesterday there's a new
[34:44.360 --> 34:51.160]  article today up on prisonplanet.com that is key that says government readies
[34:51.160 --> 34:56.640]  youth cores to take on vets let's come up with Paul Watson in one moment and
[34:56.640 --> 35:01.200]  we're not joking when we say that that's in the New York Times but they just put
[35:01.200 --> 35:05.720]  it out there like it's no big deal kind of like hey video tape cops you get a
[35:05.720 --> 35:08.800]  arrest it as a terrorist what did they say in New York to Luke Kredowski two
[35:08.800 --> 35:13.160]  years ago we know that's not a gun that camera but we're gonna say it is we're
[35:13.160 --> 35:15.800]  gonna say your backpacks a bomb and by the time they figure out you're not a
[35:15.800 --> 35:20.880]  terrorist will be in the whole 30 days and I got arrested in Canada cover
[35:20.880 --> 35:24.200]  Bilderberg and they're arresting I've counted up eight reporters that have
[35:24.200 --> 35:28.520]  been arrested one of them twice and then there's new video out today we'll be
[35:28.520 --> 35:32.680]  talking to him soon if he's not in jail again a Charlie Skelton Lenin guardian
[35:32.680 --> 35:36.880]  with him now following him all over the city and following other reporters and
[35:36.880 --> 35:43.000]  Paul morning who did a great job shooting video that we used in endgame
[35:43.000 --> 35:48.920]  in Istanbul Turkey for the coverage there he got quote detained there's video
[35:48.920 --> 35:52.520]  that up on prisonplanet.com we're getting hit from every angle Paul Watson you
[35:52.520 --> 35:55.800]  know I'd really been kind of cogitating lately and we get back in the
[35:55.800 --> 36:00.640]  Bilderberg and then the youth corps in a minute but you've been doing this now
[36:00.640 --> 36:04.880]  for seven eight years you had propaganda matrix.com which you still do and
[36:04.880 --> 36:08.080]  then I've seen a lot of your writing and really thought this guy really gets it
[36:08.080 --> 36:11.880]  so I hired John here to run prisonplanet prisonplanet.tv with your
[36:11.880 --> 36:16.880]  brother and m4wars.net but what is it like now being this deep into it and
[36:16.880 --> 36:22.240]  knowing that we're just regular guys and I know we critique ourselves and we
[36:22.240 --> 36:25.840]  try to do the best job we can we get nitpicked a lot on everything we do and
[36:25.840 --> 36:31.280]  and I guess we deserve it but I can't believe we're at the forefront of the
[36:31.280 --> 36:35.040]  fight against the new order there's no denying it now and I I just hope listeners
[36:35.040 --> 36:38.880]  realize the dangerous position we're in because I've really come to the
[36:38.880 --> 36:45.520]  realization that I am kind of crazy in a way and I guess you are too and so's
[36:45.520 --> 36:50.800]  Kurt Nemo and Jason Bermas and the rest of our crew and Steve your brother
[36:50.800 --> 36:56.440]  because most people would kind of get psyched out by this most people would
[36:56.440 --> 37:01.120]  not be able to handle the attention number one most people self-destruct
[37:01.120 --> 37:05.640]  either on a power trip or they can't handle it but plus all the other weird
[37:05.640 --> 37:09.840]  stuff that we've gone through in the tap and most of it we don't talk about so I
[37:09.840 --> 37:13.160]  just want to say on there it's it's been great working with you it'll be great
[37:13.160 --> 37:17.360]  working with you in the future but I see everything coming to a head very very
[37:17.360 --> 37:23.480]  soon Paul your thoughts on just the basic thought I'm putting out here well
[37:23.480 --> 37:28.320]  yeah I definitely feel that the heat being turned up the the more prominent
[37:28.320 --> 37:33.760]  we get the more closely we're being scrutinized but and attacked and attacked
[37:33.760 --> 37:39.520]  but as you said it I share the feeling sometimes you feel as if well this is
[37:39.520 --> 37:44.040]  so important well where's everybody else why is it just us that are doing it
[37:44.040 --> 37:48.320]  with it's like a feeling of not even feeling worthy like we should be more
[37:48.320 --> 37:52.920]  perfect because this is such a mammoth task exactly and most people that I see
[37:52.920 --> 37:58.000]  covering this information all they do is nitpick everybody else instead of
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.200]  engaging the enemy and being leaders it hurts me it hurts me that that we're
[38:03.200 --> 38:07.240]  the best there is I mean you see the point I'm making yeah and the thing
[38:07.240 --> 38:11.560]  about it is people think that it's so difficult to have any kind of influence
[38:11.560 --> 38:17.040]  on what's going on in the world today but if I can get up in the morning make
[38:17.040 --> 38:22.520]  a cup of tea write an article and then a week later questions are being asked
[38:22.520 --> 38:27.840]  about it in the Dutch Parliament and what can other people do it's like Mark
[38:27.840 --> 38:34.920]  Dice he puts out a press release about taking on this new Illuminati film and
[38:34.920 --> 38:38.040]  then it's in the United Press International the next day and people
[38:38.040 --> 38:43.000]  don't realize how easy it is to use the media to your own advantage to get
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.200]  important issues highlighters if you all you have to do is how have a basic
[38:47.200 --> 38:51.300]  understanding of how to bring your tension to certain issues and it will
[38:51.300 --> 38:59.080]  take more guys a piece of cake take mark dice he a great point he calls for
[38:59.080 --> 39:02.680]  terror storm to be sent to the troops he gets death threats it becomes a
[39:02.680 --> 39:07.040]  national news story and now a year later we've gotten the feedback a year and a
[39:07.040 --> 39:11.760]  half later I I've had troops come up to be multiple times on downtown Austin
[39:11.760 --> 39:16.160]  just during South by Southwest and other times and phone calls and emails and
[39:16.160 --> 39:21.680]  letters tens of thousands of DVDs were melding care packages to the troops and
[39:21.680 --> 39:26.840]  it will come up and hurt the New World Order again another example if you'll
[39:26.840 --> 39:31.320]  just take in mark somebody who takes action if you'll just quit sucking your
[39:31.320 --> 39:35.400]  thumbs and critiquing people in the arena we enroll up your sleeves and start
[39:35.400 --> 39:39.600]  gunning with the enemy start going up against them we need people not behind
[39:39.600 --> 39:44.520]  us but right beside us and and and we need you to start swinging folks the
[39:44.520 --> 39:48.320]  new world order is coming down on us and what's frustrating is we're drawing
[39:48.320 --> 39:52.640]  blood on the enemy we're getting hits in we're in the fight it's a fight of our
[39:52.640 --> 39:56.800]  lives folks I mean I really mean it when I get on there and I say if they win
[39:56.800 --> 40:00.360]  they're setting up death camps they're gonna have purges and kill most of us
[40:00.360 --> 40:04.400]  and that means you out there that are especially middle-class people even if
[40:04.400 --> 40:08.080]  you've served them these are thieves they're coming after you they're coming
[40:08.080 --> 40:13.440]  after everybody we got to stand up against these people and you know this
[40:13.440 --> 40:18.240]  is real ladies and gentlemen this is real this is life and death this isn't a
[40:18.240 --> 40:24.240]  game Paul Watson right and even even though we were having such a massive
[40:24.240 --> 40:31.080]  impact you know compared to the size of our operation that's also a danger in
[40:31.080 --> 40:35.640]  that was still comparatively a very small operation and there are other people
[40:35.640 --> 40:40.800]  that do similar work that you know don't work directly with us but in
[40:40.800 --> 40:45.000]  comparison there's still very few of us even though we have a lot of people out
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.160]  there who follow our work and you know keep themselves informed but if they
[40:49.160 --> 40:56.560]  would it's just you know 20% or even 10% of them was to take direct action in the
[40:56.560 --> 41:01.800]  form of the things that people like Mark Dice do then the influence that we
[41:01.800 --> 41:07.240]  have will only be greater and I've seen this happen to about 90% of people that
[41:07.240 --> 41:11.200]  really become vocal they immediately do good work write good articles do a good
[41:11.200 --> 41:14.880]  radio show and somebody baits them somebody challenges them somebody says
[41:14.880 --> 41:18.240]  you're an agent or you're this or that and then they end spend all their time
[41:18.240 --> 41:22.040]  knitting and infighting with those people and that's how Co until pro works
[41:22.040 --> 41:25.120]  folks if you know you're good in your heart you know you're good you know
[41:25.120 --> 41:29.080]  you're fighting the new old order ignore the operatives they're attacking you
[41:29.080 --> 41:32.680]  because you're having a victory and I only talk about it because we're
[41:32.680 --> 41:37.240]  command-based alpha and you know we're literally in this so I'm telling folks
[41:37.240 --> 41:40.760]  move forward against the enemy don't listen to enemy transmissions of Tokyo
[41:40.760 --> 41:45.040]  Rose telling us to lay down or that we don't have power we do have power the
[41:45.040 --> 41:49.040]  power that God breathed into us you know the moment we were conceived in our
[41:49.040 --> 41:53.200]  mother's wombs and I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen this is history this
[41:53.200 --> 41:56.760]  is your chance to be on the side of good you know the dark side is quicker
[41:56.760 --> 42:01.560]  easier more seductive don't join it I'm telling you commit it through your fear
[42:01.560 --> 42:09.200]  and great strength will come to you now going back to going back to you Paul
[42:09.200 --> 42:13.320]  Watson and these issues other comments on Bilderberg and I want to get your take
[42:13.320 --> 42:19.480]  on just the amazing Philadelphia Daily News seven years ago where it said they're
[42:19.480 --> 42:23.800]  training youth cores with submachine guns on how to do gun confiscation door
[42:23.800 --> 42:27.080]  to door fugitive apprehension I kept reading that article on air and then I
[42:27.080 --> 42:30.400]  looked into secure core and found out about the law enforcement training with
[42:30.400 --> 42:35.080]  VATF grants and every major school district and Marine Corps grants and
[42:35.080 --> 42:39.280]  all of it's the same get the gun owners kill them get the school the home
[42:39.280 --> 42:43.080]  schoolers kill them these drills are five or six different things home
[42:43.080 --> 42:46.800]  schoolers that are trying to kill people they got to be killed veterans that are
[42:46.800 --> 42:51.000]  trying to not turn their guns in they got to be killed right wingers got to be
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.440]  killed our environmentalists got to be killed it's usually throw one left wing
[42:54.440 --> 42:57.520]  in for every three or four right wing drills you know so they can say it's
[42:57.520 --> 43:02.600]  balanced but the point is it's for everybody and you know this is what
[43:02.600 --> 43:05.920]  they do and now they're training the Boy Scouts which are only two or three
[43:05.920 --> 43:09.680]  years away from combat age these are ages 14 to 17s I guess they're one one
[43:09.680 --> 43:14.160]  year from it in some cases to kill veterans to do seek and destroy so
[43:14.160 --> 43:17.400]  let's get back into billerberg anything else on that ball
[43:17.400 --> 43:19.680]  yet just to finish up it was uh...
[43:19.680 --> 43:21.160]  dutch member of parliament
[43:21.160 --> 43:23.320]  henry van bombel
[43:23.320 --> 43:24.720]  wrote in a web blog
[43:24.720 --> 43:26.280]  two days ago
[43:26.280 --> 43:29.480]  about bill bergen specifically about
[43:29.480 --> 43:35.040]  uh... s dealings information that they plan to demonize anti-eu activists in
[43:35.040 --> 43:37.720]  the media with with the upcoming
[43:37.720 --> 43:41.320]  second referendum in ireland on the lisbon treaty
[43:41.320 --> 43:46.400]  he mentioned that he also mentioned that plan to uh... think the economy again
[43:46.400 --> 43:49.320]  and he referenced our article from May 6
[43:49.320 --> 43:54.040]  and now as a result of that he's asking questions of the dutch prime minister
[43:54.040 --> 43:57.880]  in the dutch parliament about
[43:57.880 --> 44:00.680]  if they attend bill deberg are they aware of it
[44:00.680 --> 44:02.640]  uh... if the lisbon treaty
[44:02.640 --> 44:05.120]  going to be discussed at bill deberg
[44:05.120 --> 44:07.040]  and uh... if they do plan on
[44:07.040 --> 44:11.120]  trying to demonize anti-eu activists in the media
[44:11.120 --> 44:13.440]  so it's just another example about how
[44:13.440 --> 44:17.400]  how much influence we're actually having where we can get mp's to ask
[44:17.400 --> 44:21.560]  questions in major european parliament about this by just putting out an
[44:21.560 --> 44:22.600]  article
[44:22.600 --> 44:23.880]  and it's
[44:23.880 --> 44:26.840]  it's happened in the past i mean on
[44:26.840 --> 44:29.000]  at least for what i've counted
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  a dozen or more occasions
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.160]  questions have been asked in the
[44:33.160 --> 44:38.120]  house of commons in the u k about bill deberg some directly to
[44:38.120 --> 44:41.320]  former prime minister tony blair himself
[44:41.320 --> 44:43.240]  who had to lie
[44:43.240 --> 44:47.480]  brazenly in front of parliament in october two thousand and six when he was
[44:47.480 --> 44:48.800]  asked by
[44:48.800 --> 44:50.920]  mp norman baker
[44:50.920 --> 44:54.080]  also came out in support of a
[44:54.080 --> 44:57.720]  new investigation into the death of dr david kelly
[44:57.720 --> 44:59.120]  baker asked him
[44:59.120 --> 45:01.360]  if he'd attended bill deberg
[45:01.360 --> 45:05.880]  and he blair said quote i have not attended any such meetings
[45:05.880 --> 45:08.280]  despite it being
[45:08.280 --> 45:12.480]  uh... renownly recognize that he attended the nineteen ninety three
[45:12.480 --> 45:14.920]  meeting in greece
[45:14.920 --> 45:18.280]  so he blair just lied in front of parliament which isn't
[45:18.280 --> 45:19.920]  illegal obviously
[45:19.920 --> 45:23.280]  in denying that he ever attended bill deberg but
[45:23.280 --> 45:24.400]  as i said
[45:24.400 --> 45:26.560]  and i've provided a link to it in the article
[45:26.560 --> 45:29.080]  but when you break the law for specter
[45:29.080 --> 45:31.360]  when you break the law for specter
[45:31.360 --> 45:34.080]  which is the bill deberg group they throw at your face with you know in
[45:34.080 --> 45:38.480]  flaming the lss guy right in those those novels that were made into movies
[45:38.480 --> 45:44.760]  when you break the law for specter that's okay you get promoted
[45:44.760 --> 45:46.960]  but now where
[45:46.960 --> 45:50.480]  a lot of attention i mean we've got a lot of
[45:50.480 --> 45:51.240]  neverland
[45:51.240 --> 45:55.080]  they're leaving comments on the article i get emails from him occasionally
[45:55.080 --> 45:58.120]  and there's a lot of uh... attention on bill deberg at the moment in the
[45:58.120 --> 46:00.880]  Netherlands which is why i found it bizarre
[46:00.880 --> 46:03.840]  that we had that incident a few weeks ago
[46:03.840 --> 46:09.120]  where this uh... nutcase who supposedly targeting the royal family
[46:09.120 --> 46:13.240]  tried to car plow through a group of people on the street
[46:13.240 --> 46:14.320]  with the uh...
[46:14.320 --> 46:15.920]  royal cattle paid
[46:15.920 --> 46:20.800]  and the coaches up on his right to the return left to plow was into a pillar
[46:20.800 --> 46:24.480]  and then he died and that's the end of it and illicit for the system sounds
[46:24.480 --> 46:27.280]  like sounds like remote control cars and
[46:27.280 --> 46:29.680]  uh... we know they've got units going back
[46:29.680 --> 46:32.560]  thirty years well they had a world war two for aircraft but
[46:32.560 --> 46:35.560]  thirty years in cars where they just remote control it into whatever they
[46:35.560 --> 46:36.160]  want
[46:36.160 --> 46:38.680]  there's been a bunch of ceo's involved
[46:38.680 --> 46:40.800]  in scams here in texas
[46:40.800 --> 46:44.760]  one of them uh... that did a bunch of scams of the big apartment complex
[46:44.760 --> 46:45.620]  company
[46:45.620 --> 46:48.640]  and then he was out in the panhandle of texas
[46:48.640 --> 46:52.760]  where there was only a concrete pile on every few miles he magically ran into
[46:52.760 --> 46:57.000]  that one pile on a burn up if you believe that
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.960]  if you watch the video is just bizarre because
[46:59.960 --> 47:01.440]  it's a clear road
[47:01.440 --> 47:03.520]  on the right of him ahead of the
[47:03.520 --> 47:06.240]  royal coaches and then on the left is
[47:06.240 --> 47:08.040]  pillar with that you
[47:08.040 --> 47:11.280]  and he just tried straight into the pillar is bizarre
[47:11.280 --> 47:13.440]  anyway there's a lot of attention on it in
[47:13.440 --> 47:17.200]  holland at the moment and now as a result of the article
[47:17.200 --> 47:19.160]  questions are being asked
[47:19.160 --> 47:20.760]  and uh...
[47:20.760 --> 47:22.860]  from what i understand
[47:22.860 --> 47:25.480]  you could probably get the newspaper book
[47:25.480 --> 47:29.220]  there's going to be a major article in a british newspaper on monday
[47:29.220 --> 47:32.240]  a serious article about bill deberg
[47:32.240 --> 47:35.360]  now the times reported on it a few days ago
[47:35.360 --> 47:38.920]  which was then picked up by her at
[47:38.920 --> 47:43.520]  and apart from that there's been a mention in a portuguese newspaper
[47:43.520 --> 47:47.880]  uh... but apart from that basically nothing and nothing out of the uf
[47:47.880 --> 47:49.360]  corporate media
[47:49.360 --> 47:52.720]  yeah you would think that geithner and a bunch of white house officials breaking
[47:52.720 --> 47:54.320]  federal law the logan act
[47:54.320 --> 47:56.920]  with a bunch of other world leaders who brag
[47:56.920 --> 47:58.320]  in their minutes
[47:58.320 --> 48:03.040]  uh... that they've released over time they set up the e you covertly that
[48:03.040 --> 48:06.240]  uh... the nazis had a plan when they were losing in the in the nineteen
[48:06.240 --> 48:07.240]  forty four
[48:07.240 --> 48:08.360]  forty three
[48:08.360 --> 48:10.800]  uh... to to put their money into bill deberg
[48:10.800 --> 48:14.240]  uh... we know large portions of that were nazi funded and then mixed with
[48:14.240 --> 48:15.920]  british and new york money
[48:15.920 --> 48:18.280]  that actually funded the nazis
[48:18.280 --> 48:19.600]  and you see when you watch
[48:19.600 --> 48:23.040]  i actually went out to best buy and bought the first few james bond movies
[48:23.040 --> 48:25.480]  because i knew in flaming
[48:25.480 --> 48:27.560]  and people know where i'm going this in a minute
[48:27.560 --> 48:29.920]  in flaming was os s
[48:29.920 --> 48:33.680]  and so that's british intelligence slash cia propaganda
[48:33.680 --> 48:36.440]  but but in these films you see it's specter
[48:36.440 --> 48:41.440]  and they tell you that specter uses former kgb former m i six
[48:41.440 --> 48:43.960]  former uh... cia people quote
[48:43.960 --> 48:47.760]  and it's these international bankers in their staging terror attacks
[48:47.760 --> 48:51.400]  but really that's what the bill deberg group is they are specter
[48:51.400 --> 48:53.440]  but specter sits above
[48:53.440 --> 48:56.240]  our governments inspector actually runs things
[48:56.240 --> 48:58.640]  so specter stages terror attacks
[48:58.640 --> 48:59.760]  to then blame it
[48:59.760 --> 49:03.280]  on their political enemies so they can stick the supposed good guys the
[49:03.280 --> 49:04.800]  british in the u.s
[49:04.800 --> 49:06.280]  uh... on them
[49:06.280 --> 49:09.600]  and so now i'm you know watching the james bond movies again on the treadmill
[49:09.600 --> 49:10.600]  in the morning
[49:10.600 --> 49:14.320]  just to end and now you know just seeing it it's total
[49:14.320 --> 49:17.560]  complete propaganda you watch the modern james bond movies
[49:17.560 --> 49:18.760]  it's even more
[49:18.760 --> 49:21.880]  where james bond is fighting the secret societies
[49:21.880 --> 49:24.040]  the illuminati in the last one
[49:24.040 --> 49:29.960]  and you know no they are the illuminati paul you want to explain that the folks
[49:29.960 --> 49:31.840]  well that they often
[49:31.840 --> 49:34.920]  is called revelation of the method isn't it
[49:34.920 --> 49:37.440]  it's some kind of uh...
[49:37.440 --> 49:41.680]  code of ethics that they have whereby they have if they do evil they have to
[49:41.680 --> 49:43.600]  reveal it in some sort of way
[49:43.600 --> 49:46.120]  to cleanse their own conscience that's what
[49:46.120 --> 49:48.640]  some people have claimed
[49:48.640 --> 49:51.400]  it's true that you will feel a lot of it in
[49:51.400 --> 49:53.760]  on film
[49:53.760 --> 49:56.280]  you know production like that
[49:56.280 --> 50:00.280]  they do put a lot of it in there to kind of throw it in our faces and at the
[50:00.280 --> 50:01.920]  same time
[50:01.920 --> 50:03.680]  when you talk about it
[50:03.680 --> 50:07.440]  fax people just they all that was just that in a movie or whatever
[50:07.440 --> 50:09.680]  which is what they've done with this
[50:09.680 --> 50:11.080]  demons and angels
[50:11.080 --> 50:13.040]  you know at the end it turns out that
[50:13.040 --> 50:16.840]  the illuminati is just one guy playing a massive joke
[50:16.840 --> 50:21.240]  and uh... it's it's all non-existent so they do that regularly
[50:21.240 --> 50:23.460]  we'll take a scene of royale
[50:23.460 --> 50:26.600]  uh... you've got the first new bond film
[50:26.600 --> 50:29.680]  he and you watch that
[50:29.680 --> 50:33.880]  there's a guy staging terrorism on airlines for put options
[50:33.880 --> 50:39.280]  which is exactly what happened on nine eleven in reality
[50:39.280 --> 50:40.840]  i mean it just
[50:40.840 --> 50:42.680]  absolutely never ends
[50:42.680 --> 50:46.080]  okay watch and let's come back about the youth brigades then we're scheduled

[54:39.920 --> 54:44.360]  Guardian writer with an update coming up in T-minus 35 minutes going back to Paul
[54:44.360 --> 54:50.720]  Joseph Watson Paul government Reddy's youth cores to take on vets now that's the
[54:50.720 --> 54:55.920]  story at prison planet this article needs to go mega viral calling all info
[54:55.920 --> 55:00.400]  warriors calling all info warriors we need you to get this out to people we
[55:00.400 --> 55:03.760]  need to punch through the mainstream media and make this a major story like
[55:03.760 --> 55:06.720]  the Department of Homeland Security saying vets are the number one threat
[55:06.720 --> 55:09.800]  they've been training and Paul I don't know if you added this the article only
[55:09.800 --> 55:12.880]  read the first part of it this morning for I got on air because you posted it
[55:12.880 --> 55:18.120]  right for a one-on-air part 2 to yesterday's story I don't know did you
[55:18.120 --> 55:23.200]  add the part about how they've done improvised explosive devices training
[55:23.200 --> 55:27.000]  with every police department in the nation every medium-sized to big telling
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.840]  the local police we've had them on that they're getting ready for vets to come
[55:29.840 --> 55:33.920]  back and start bombing the police which is just asinine so again it's another
[55:33.920 --> 55:38.960]  big piece the entire attack formation of Homeland Security is for conservatives
[55:38.960 --> 55:46.520]  and gun owners Paul Watson right when I saw this immediately it screamed out
[55:46.520 --> 55:56.000]  Hitler Eugen Hitler youth because in Nazi Germany the Hitler youth originated
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.480]  out of the Boy Scout movement the Boy Scout movement started off as it did
[56:00.480 --> 56:07.160]  in America you know it was about sports and the viable skills and camping and
[56:07.160 --> 56:11.520]  stuff like that and it was when it was taken over by the Nazis it was
[56:11.520 --> 56:18.600]  militarized and rolled into the Hitler youth which at its peak in 1940 had 8
[56:18.600 --> 56:22.680]  million members and they were given the same kind of training that's described
[56:22.680 --> 56:28.520]  in this New York Times article and what what Wikipedia won't tell you about the
[56:28.520 --> 56:34.800]  Hitler youth was that they were just they would just roam around Germany
[56:34.800 --> 56:38.840]  harassing people there's a story in there I mention it every time I come on
[56:38.840 --> 56:43.040]  there because it's such a good book Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William
[56:43.040 --> 56:48.160]  Shira where they're just out roaming around harassing families having picnics
[56:48.160 --> 56:54.920]  and stuff and you know they were a component of the thought police in
[56:54.920 --> 57:00.800]  Nazi Germany the Hitler youth and that's what screamed out to me when I saw
[57:00.800 --> 57:10.280]  this article in the New York Times yesterday all continuing yeah and they
[57:10.280 --> 57:17.480]  as you said they talk about taking on a disgruntled Iraq war veteran and
[57:17.480 --> 57:23.200]  subduing people disarming people suspected terrorists and then if you apply
[57:23.200 --> 57:28.880]  what Homeland Security defines as terrorists from their own lexicon
[57:28.880 --> 57:37.440]  documents and from my act as well on a on the federal level it's going on as
[57:37.440 --> 57:41.820]  people who are aware of their right people who display bomb
[57:41.820 --> 57:45.160]  Paul Watson I got to stop you there I'm gonna need to keep that hole for 15

[1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:44.720]  bunch of reporters the police state and the most importantly every year you hear
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:49.040]  it here first inside knowledge from Bilderberg group contacts of what's
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:52.280]  happening we're now into the first full day of the conference it's now eight
[1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:59.280]  o'clock they're in Greece Jim Tucker tell us what's happening well today
[1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:07.880]  trial built a speech advocating the turning the World Health Organization

[1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:21.120]  creating the IMF International Monetary Fund into a world department of
[1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:26.600]  Treasury both of course under the auspices of the United Nations and of
[1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:30.840]  course this would be a giant step toward world government something the
[1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:35.760]  mission is frustrated frustrated them now for more than a decade their efforts
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:41.480]  but whether or not they go all the way either event would represent a
[1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:48.680]  significant surrender of natural sovereignty so well he made the case
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:54.880]  about how the world is in such horrible economic shape that it takes a
[1:01:54.880 --> 1:02:03.400]  super agency global super agency to fix the problem and because of the they
[1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:08.240]  took over their facts when they invented the swine flu disease but the swine
[1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:13.480]  flu pandemic as they called it he shifted gears and fell back in the old
[1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:21.680]  decades old Bilderberg theme of global warming we're all gonna burn to death
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:25.960]  well in here after he will but Jim Tucker I must interrupt you in the limited
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:30.720]  time we have I know you're busy Jim are you telling me they said they invented
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:39.200]  these the the latest swine flu no often they did because it was Bilderberg
[1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:43.240]  luminaries who first said gee we have this bad pandemic it was not a bad
[1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:49.520]  pandemic every year on average 300,000 Americans could get a flu every year on
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:57.280]  average 30,000 Americans a flu now how many people have died of swine flu what
[1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:01.880]  is too many it does not represent a pandemic and they admit both those six
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:05.240]  so I'll see your point and plus they're now using it as they've said to set up a
[1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:07.960]  new world order you're saying they're saying that internally in the meeting
[1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:12.040]  continue what else is on the agenda what about the global carbon tax the global
[1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:15.400]  court you said you were getting some initial reports of that well what else
[1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:20.760]  is on the agenda Jim that is on the agenda and what so we look by many
[1:03:20.760 --> 1:03:27.720]  people is effective some type of a direct tax on all the world has been long
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:32.480]  only Bilderberg agenda there's three such bills pending before the United
[1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:36.360]  Nations and have been for years and they're trying to pick a time when they
[1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:42.120]  can split it through without doing anybody being really aware of it now
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:47.640]  their favorite global tax has always been a tax on oil at the barrel head it
[1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:51.800]  was start off like the income tax did very low maybe a penny a barrel when you
[1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:56.880]  buy a gallon of gasoline you will not even notice that you're paying two
[1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:03.320]  pennies to the United Nations because you bought two gallons of gas you wouldn't
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:07.640]  even know years ago by you would not even be aware that when you put gas in your
[1:04:07.640 --> 1:04:13.480]  car or your lawnmower for that matter or or any purpose you are paying a tax
[1:04:13.480 --> 1:04:20.280]  direct tax direct tax the United Nations that's a symbol of global sovereignty and
[1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:23.760]  of course like federal income tax would increase over the years and people are
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:29.200]  dug up and grown and then we're there up there unless you say that so much federal
[1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:35.160]  tax so much state tax so much in some cases county tax and oh yes you in

[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:17.400]  we are back live it's bill deberg 2009 frontline exclusives from the kingpin
[1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:23.600]  bill deberg hunter 34 years hunting these guys he's the reason you're seeing
[1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:27.240]  at the mainstream media today the reason we have governments going after him
[1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:33.120]  Jim one comment for you it's up on prisonplanet.com today a member of the
[1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:36.560]  dutch parliament is asking the finance minister the prime minister and others
[1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:41.800]  and the queen if they're attending bill deberg and trying to ram through EU
[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:45.600]  expansion in the Libs and treaty were you aware of this breaking
[1:08:45.600 --> 1:08:54.840]  development not about the queen and whoever but I know that was only a
[1:08:54.840 --> 1:08:59.640]  gender today and there is much discussion about getting the Irish to
[1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:05.920]  sign on to the Lisbon treaty because if all EU countries have to
[1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:11.080]  endorse art could not happen and the Irish voted down before they're going to
[1:09:11.080 --> 1:09:15.000]  try to make them vote again and torture them in pressure them into voting
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:19.360]  reversing themselves and Irish did not want to surrender that much sovereignty
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:24.320]  of course they've already all those countries have surrendered significant
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:28.480]  sovereignty I mean the European parliament can make laws and impose in
[1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:36.200]  the member states European court can make rulings and overturn laws of
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:41.880]  member states they have yet they want to make it stronger and the Irish said no
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:46.480]  in the first referendum in fact Germany in both in Germany and France shows that
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:50.880]  the people strongly opposed the Lisbon treaty but in Germany and France the
[1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:53.560]  state can sign off on it for the elected or not
[1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:58.160]  Ireland requires a referendum the first time it failed they plan a meeting in
[1:09:58.160 --> 1:10:04.240]  June about June 18-19 something like that to try to pressure the Irish into
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:12.800]  Irish voters into reversing themselves a Bilderberg plans to send a group up
[1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:20.400]  there privately to talk privately to the leaders of Ireland to pressure them
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:24.680]  to tell their citizens it's good for you you'll eat better you'll live longer
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:29.880]  okay Jim yeah that plays out Jim and the woman of time is have a lot of other
[1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:34.120]  questions just in the short notes what else is on their agenda from your
[1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:41.840]  sources inside Bilderberg well I think we've mentioned this yesterday but
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:46.880]  President Obama is being pressured well he's willingly he's willingly accepted
[1:10:46.880 --> 1:10:51.440]  the job of trying to slip through ratification of the International
[1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:58.920]  Criminal Court Treaty now when Bilderberg Clinton first signed off on it
[1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:04.360]  a test vote in Congress showed it more than 90 senators voting against it so he did
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:08.600]  not submit it for ratification when Bobo Bush was elected he withdrew the
[1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:16.320]  signature when Obama when Obama was elected he put the signature back on
[1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:22.080]  so they could go before the Senate any time but their tactics are this Obama is
[1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:26.320]  the sweet talk with the many left-wing Democrats in Congress who would really
[1:11:26.320 --> 1:11:32.440]  want to vote for the International Criminal Court Treaty they really want to
[1:11:32.440 --> 1:11:35.800]  they're just scared because patriots maybe you have something to do with us
[1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:40.400]  maybe I did too we're so strongly opposed for surrendering sovereignty that
[1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:44.400]  they were afraid to vote for it politically kept political powers so
[1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:48.240]  Obama is going to sweet talk it and say don't worry we'll have more left-wing
[1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:52.480]  Congress or he'll probably say more liberals sent it after the 2002
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:12:01.680]  election so in January of 11 when the newsman is seated you can ratify it
[1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:05.360]  later on Saturday night it's too late for Sunday morning papers too late to
[1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:12.120]  repand the Sunday talk shows and you'll what even make the Monday papers it'll
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:17.040]  happen nobody will know we'll suffer no political reprisal and we can be a
[1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:23.200]  member of the International Criminal Court and for those that don't know Jim I
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:26.800]  mean for those that don't know this will put Americans under the jurisdiction of
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:31.120]  foreign hate speech laws being arrested for criticizing open borders you know
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:34.280]  Michael Savage can't come to Europe banning internet freedom all of that
[1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:37.840]  now what about Daniel Estolin who's proven to be very accurate with his
[1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:43.200]  sources he says he has to Bilderberg group members the sources and their age he
[1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:48.440]  has been reporting that from his sources that that on their agenda is do they
[1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:52.360]  want to plunge the economy quickly to get people to accept the new world order
[1:12:52.360 --> 1:12:58.000]  now and quote a loss of sovereignty and they they call a loss of standard of
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:05.040]  living a streamlining of the economy or do they want to have a long drawn-out
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:11.160]  depression is that being discussed I mean like you said last year yes it is and
[1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:17.040]  the mood seems to be according to our Treasury Secretary Gessner and built
[1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:23.520]  toward a shorter recession not a 10-year recession now Danny and I've
[1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:27.120]  collaborated for many years he's not here this year for the third straight year
[1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:32.160]  I don't know why couldn't communicate with him he's always been reliable that
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:38.560]  we've collaborated over the years but the tilt is sort of shorter recession
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:45.240]  partly because a 10-year recession would damage a Bilderberg
[1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:54.120]  industrious themselves as much as they won't have a department of the Global
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:14:00.000]  Department of Labor and the Global Department of every treasured everything
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:05.440]  they still like making money and such a prolonged recession would cost them big
[1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:10.720]  bucks industrials nobody's buying their toys but now they're not all industrious
[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:16.560]  so I'm just born to great wealth and why we'll watch it pile up and some are
[1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:21.520]  high officials of government support that tilt is toward keeping it short but
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:26.320]  using it to within two years you can make people miserable enough to accept
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:30.360]  anything seems to be the view okay to be clear Jim you're saying you're
[1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:34.200]  confirming that they as you said three years ago and two years ago and last
[1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:38.400]  year you said they were going to cut oil prices in half when it was at $149 a
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:41.320]  barrel and suddenly it plunged because they really are running things this
[1:14:41.320 --> 1:14:45.280]  isn't predictions this is what the leader saying are you saying that yes
[1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:50.400]  indeed they've engineered the crisis to to terrorize people into accepting the
[1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:55.320]  new bank of the world the new world currency either they engineered are
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:15:04.680]  they're surely celebrating it they will are exploiting it to promote the well as
[1:15:04.680 --> 1:15:09.000]  you said also the new world currency but they've been so far behind their
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.920]  schedule and that in fact the patriots have been winning as I've said so many
[1:15:12.920 --> 1:15:18.320]  times bill billberg was confident having the American Union by the year 2000 and
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:24.520]  that was nine years ago and we don't have them Mario yet they were first
[1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:29.560]  we just dollar eyes Westerners here but now they went to be in the barrier oh so
[1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:32.080]  they do want to go with the Emerald Jim in the limited time we have left just a
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:36.000]  few final questions you said record security that they shut down the entire
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:40.280]  palace area and three hotels in the resort you said you've never seen this
[1:15:40.280 --> 1:15:45.640]  level of security why do you have any insights info on why they're they're
[1:15:45.640 --> 1:15:51.160]  acting so afraid well they're parent whatever year as a secret site they
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:57.240]  tried to make it they get widespread publicity in fact Charlie Shelton will
[1:15:57.240 --> 1:16:03.720]  have a piece I think Monday in the crew edition of his paper the Guardian there's
[1:16:03.720 --> 1:16:10.520]  a lot of freelance reporters here others associated with various broadcast
[1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:15.880]  networks and newspapers and there's well it seems to be just about as many
[1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:21.120]  journalists as there was before it is hard to get the poor demonstrations but
[1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:26.480]  with cars being stopped and people bullied or fully two and a half miles away
[1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:32.320]  from the scene of the gate so others left dramatic protests like you saw a
[1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:38.440]  chantilly last year they're here and the journalists are here Jim Jim I was
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:41.200]  saying police were coming up and arresting people a hundred yards away
[1:16:41.200 --> 1:16:45.000]  you're saying two and a half miles away because I keep seeing videos where it's
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:49.240]  like seashore and trees and no buildings around in highways are there just
[1:16:49.240 --> 1:16:53.560]  one of the tolders police just everywhere arresting people all over the
[1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:58.040]  I mean this is total police state I mean the media should be all over this
[1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:02.960]  with their reporters being arrested oh and they surely are taking the guy's
[1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:07.180]  camera pulling out the film are forcing him to race and have one of those
[1:17:07.180 --> 1:17:11.000]  gizmo camera spirit they could have simply erase it they're doing that they
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:18.200]  did try to shelter three times he's a button for punishment and there's been
[1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:25.000]  a large number of guys have told those experiences okay Jim in Jim Tucker in
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:29.400]  closing when are you getting back to the United States so we can get a full 30
[1:17:29.400 --> 1:17:32.920]  minute report here on air from you when are we going to see the big print

[1:23:53.360 --> 1:24:12.720]  coming
[1:24:23.360 --> 1:24:36.600]  We got a one and guardian reporter coming up in T minus nine minutes.
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:39.880]  A bunch of other guests will tell you about later, but I wanted to finish up with Paul
[1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:40.880]  Watson.
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:43.720]  We got interrupted by having Jim Tucker on.
[1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:46.600]  I'll break down those huge breaking pieces of information.
[1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:49.240]  You watch, all that's now going to happen in the next year.
[1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:52.200]  I mean, it just happens year after year.
[1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:54.360]  These people actually run things.
[1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:58.800]  We actually go to these countries and get arrested and detained and have moles inside
[1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:02.800]  in the Secret Service and Boulderburg group members who don't like it.
[1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:05.200]  And it's so incredible.
[1:25:05.200 --> 1:25:09.160]  I mean, I've been in hotel rooms finding bugging devices and been followed and been
[1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:14.800]  arrested and Jim's been shot at and all this is happening and it's not Cloak and Dagger.
[1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:15.800]  We're not like James Bond.
[1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:21.200]  All fancy and, you know, super handsome and perfectly tailored suits, you know, Mr. Universe.
[1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:27.360]  This is just real people, gum shoe, detective type folks and myself and Paul Watson and
[1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:28.480]  all the other great people.
[1:25:28.480 --> 1:25:32.240]  There's quite a few rogue alternative media people there.
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:35.040]  There's quite a few mainstream people there who were kind of laughing at first, but now
[1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:36.600]  being arrested.
[1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:42.560]  And so if we just point out this is criminal, this is illegal, this is, this is the cabal.
[1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:45.000]  They'll fall and that's starting to happen.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:48.480]  As Paul Watson said with his great article, where the Dutch Prime Minister grilled over
[1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:55.160]  Boulderburg following prison, planet article in the parliament, the Queens being grilled.
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:25:57.440]  You got to have guts because guts is enough folks.
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:25:58.440]  You just believe in it.
[1:25:58.440 --> 1:25:59.440]  Take action.
[1:25:59.440 --> 1:26:00.440]  Tell the truth.
[1:26:00.440 --> 1:26:01.440]  Don't stop fighting.
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:02.440]  And we're going to win this thing.
[1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:03.440]  Paul Watson.
[1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:07.440]  They'll finishing up with government Reddy's youth core cores to take on vets.
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:12.280]  New York Times training the school children to take on the veterans.
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:13.800]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:14.800]  Paul Watson, finish up.
[1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:21.600]  Right, and I mean, in the article, I point out that they're shifting away from the traditional
[1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:29.120]  Boy Scout pursuits of sports, camping, team leadership, survival skills, and they're going
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:34.800]  forward and militarizing it, quote, to confront terrorism, illegal immigration and escalating
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:35.800]  border violence.
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:43.080]  And it's all under the banner of this explorers program, which is exactly how the Hitler youth
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:45.080]  came into being.
[1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:46.080]  It started out as the Boy Scouts.
[1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:51.760]  And then it was militarized and became a preparatory school for the training of future Nazi leaders.
[1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:53.760]  And I don't say that lightly.
[1:26:53.760 --> 1:27:00.520]  I mean, this screams out Hitler youth to me when you see these pictures of these teenagers
[1:27:00.520 --> 1:27:07.920]  with guns and they're being sent out to disarm, disgruntled Iraq war veterans and people like
[1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:11.440]  that who are all catalogued in the Homeland Security.
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:16.160]  Disarm them, there's photos of Homeland, there's photos of Homeland Security saying go in and
[1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:17.160]  kill everybody.
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:20.960]  I mean, the kids are practicing killing adults.
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:21.960]  Good Lord.
[1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:28.800]  You know, this is going to be introduced under the pretext of a national crisis, which relates
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:32.960]  to something that's just, we're just going to post on the website now.
[1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:38.480]  There's a top flu expert, influenza expert called Dr. Henry L. Neiman.
[1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:45.560]  And he's saying that now because there's been a case of swine flu in Scotland, which quote,
[1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:53.560]  fulfills the WHO requirement of community transmission in two or more regions, that the WHO are about
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:28:00.880]  to raise the pandemic level from five to six, even though, you know, swine flu has proven
[1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:03.480]  less deadly than the common influenza.
[1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:08.840]  Which allows them to go around laws, which allows them to basically suspend laws and
[1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:12.000]  bring in that George Bush now Obama emergency.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:16.360]  And they're saying, as I predicted, oh, it will mutate in the fall and kill everybody.
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:21.160]  That's probably hype to folks, but to fear monger everyone into taking the new special
[1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:23.160]  triple shot.
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:27.680]  Now you got to have three flu vaccines every year, Paul.
[1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:33.920]  So good news is that there was a Reuters article yesterday, which did a survey and said that
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:40.080]  only a third of Americans would take a swine flu vaccine and, you know, that's just after
[1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:41.240]  all the fear mongering.
[1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:45.960]  So imagine if it happens again in a few months, that number will be even less.
[1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:49.960]  Hey, do we send you that San Francisco Chronicle article where they were admitting the CIA
[1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:58.480]  released the swine fever flu in Cuba, that's declassified, and that almost every swine flu
[1:28:58.480 --> 1:29:04.840]  outbreak, 1918, 1976, happens at military bases after they're vaccinated, and then admitting
[1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:08.120]  the swine flu shots in the 70s killed a bunch of people.
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:11.200]  I mean, they're going to shoot people up and they're going to die.
[1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:15.240]  And then they just say, oh, that's how it is, you know, I mean, it's such baloney, Paul.
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:22.720]  Right, and then we had the Professor Gibbs a few days ago saying that it looked like
[1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:28.640]  it was manufactured in a lab or accidentally released from a vaccine lab, as it always
[1:29:28.640 --> 1:29:29.640]  became.
[1:29:29.640 --> 1:29:34.400]  By the way, have we gotten the CNN and MSNBC to apologize for attacking us saying we were
[1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:37.040]  cooks for saying it was engineered?
[1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:39.040]  Not that I know of, no.
[1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:40.040]  That doesn't matter.
[1:29:40.040 --> 1:29:41.040]  They're discredited scum, anyways.
[1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:42.040]  Paul Watson, great job.
[1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:46.840]  We'll be talking to you again throughout the weekend, and going into next week, we'll
[1:29:46.840 --> 1:29:50.240]  be right back with Mr. Skeleton and the London Guardian.

[1:31:01.760 --> 1:31:07.840]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:12.360]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:31:12.360 --> 1:31:13.680]  us would like to see.
[1:31:13.680 --> 1:31:18.840]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:31:18.840 --> 1:31:19.840]  of the American people.
[1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:24.600]  Well, Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:31:24.600 --> 1:31:29.720]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:31:29.720 --> 1:31:37.800]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:31:37.800 --> 1:31:41.360]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:48.280]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:31:48.280 --> 1:31:53.880]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high

[1:32:00.760 --> 1:32:02.560]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:04.400]  What does humidity mean to you?
[1:32:04.400 --> 1:32:08.760]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize
[1:32:08.760 --> 1:32:12.160]  that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[1:32:12.160 --> 1:32:15.120]  That's why I'd like you to visit AkolaBlue.com.

[1:33:26.040 --> 1:33:53.560]  The AkolaBlue 28 is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator produced by AkolaBlue 28.
[1:33:53.560 --> 1:34:02.680]  We have him from outside Athens, Greece at the site of Bilderberg 2009.
[1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:06.960]  We're going to go to Charlie Skelton in just one moment, writer for one of the biggest
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:10.000]  newspapers in the world, The London Guardian.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:16.440]  Before we talk to this reporter who was arrested twice in the first two days of this, I heard
[1:34:16.440 --> 1:34:19.200]  he had a fracas today from Jim Tucker.
[1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:20.200]  We'll get to tales.
[1:34:20.200 --> 1:34:24.360]  A bunch of other reporters got arrested and detained.
[1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:30.040]  We will go over that coming up, but first I wanted to tell the listeners about a few
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:33.040]  of our sponsors.
[1:34:33.040 --> 1:34:43.040]  One of those sponsors is Pepperspray.com, again that's Pepperspray.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:47.080]  Be sure and check them out online.
[1:34:47.080 --> 1:34:52.240]  They have the best deals I've seen anywhere on stun guns and tasers and animal repellents,
[1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:57.560]  home safety, personal alarms, big ol' fire extinguisher size, spray bottles of Mason
[1:34:57.560 --> 1:35:01.920]  Pepperspray down to little bitty ones that look like pens, but still spray a lot of
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:02.920]  it out.
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:08.080]  This is the one-stop shop for non-lethal weapons, and again, I believe in citizens having tasers.
[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:10.360]  I believe in citizens having stun guns.
[1:35:10.360 --> 1:35:14.840]  I'm against the police misusing them or citizens misusing them, but everybody should get a
[1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:18.920]  taser and a stun gun, especially if your wife didn't want to have a gun, but she goes to
[1:35:18.920 --> 1:35:22.120]  dangerous places or you're in a city where you can't have a gun, but you can't have one
[1:35:22.120 --> 1:35:23.240]  of these.
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:26.880]  These are powerful tools to protect yourself, ladies and gentlemen, especially if you're
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:31.200]  jogging and things like that, you can put it in your little backpack or fanny pack.
[1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:34.600]  Again, take action, defend yourselves, put it in your car, you never know when you're
[1:35:34.600 --> 1:35:36.240]  going to need it.
[1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:44.240]  Pepperspray.com, 800-908-9988, 800-908-9988, Pepperspray.com, fabulous folks.
[1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:50.440]  Be sure and check them out today, and yes, we are having a money bomb because we built
[1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:54.560]  the new radio slash TV studio here, but we can get the space next door to us.
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:57.280]  The last money bomb is only enough to move to these studios and build us.
[1:35:57.280 --> 1:36:00.320]  We need another money bomb to build the official TV studios.
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:04.240]  We round up money, and we've already raised $15,000.
[1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:09.080]  That would buy one decent studio camera, but we buy even cheaper ones that are 5,000.
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:12.360]  But the point is, it takes a lot of money to do this even on the cheap, so the money
[1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:15.560]  bomb is coming up June 11th.
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:20.120]  You can go ahead and donate now, PayPal, credit card, or mail it in.
[1:36:20.120 --> 1:36:27.800]  You'll put it there on the thermometer we have, going towards $1,500,000, $350,000 that
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:29.520]  we need.
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:34.920]  That's our goal, and that was what the money bomb did a year ago that helped us move into
[1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:36.920]  these facilities, hire more people.
[1:36:36.920 --> 1:36:39.320]  We spend every dime of it on this operation.
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:43.600]  Every dime of the money donated in the money bomb will also go to expand what we're doing
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:44.600]  here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:50.240]  So, again, I want to ask folks to go there and pledge to give on that date of June 11th,
[1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:52.160]  or if you want to go ahead and give now, you can do that as well.
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:54.440]  It's kind of a pledge drive we are doing here.
[1:36:54.440 --> 1:36:58.920]  Another way to support us is your PrisonPlanet.tv memberships now five years up and running.
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:05.720]  We keep adding new functions, new more videos, live feeds for the PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:10.600]  So you can get all of the DVDs and films I produce and the other films we carry at infowarrows.com
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:12.240]  and prisonplanet.com.
[1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:15.720]  Like the new Aaron Russo interview, it's the interview we released on the web for free,
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:20.360]  but some added behind the scenes parts of the interview we didn't put out, and a modern
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:24.760]  commentary by myself with modern events that have happened, and a lot more so you can get
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:30.560]  that as well at infowarrows.com or by calling toll-free 888-2533139.
[1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:36.160]  We have also, in closing, started taking the best interviews every month and putting out
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:40.800]  a new video, and the first edition of this is out with David Ike, Alan Watt, the awesome
[1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:46.280]  police chief, Joe Rogan, a bunch of other people, two-hour film in high quality, digital
[1:37:46.280 --> 1:37:47.880]  quality, and a lot more.
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:51.160]  That is now available, and that is now shipping now at infowarrows.com.
[1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:55.840]  It is the DVD Arsenal Volume 1, and we're going to have a lot more of these coming out in
[1:37:55.840 --> 1:37:56.840]  the next few weeks.
[1:37:56.840 --> 1:38:00.400]  Okay, and then after we're caught up, it'll be every month one comes out.
[1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:02.320]  They're going to be coming out every week now for the next few weeks.
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:06.400]  We've got four or five, because we're doing January, February, March, April, you know,
[1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:08.400]  doing those first four months now.
[1:38:08.400 --> 1:38:09.800]  Okay, enough about that.
[1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:15.400]  Let's go to our guest joining us from right outside the Bilderberg conference.
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:23.400]  He is a London Guardian reporter, and we really do appreciate Mr. Skelton coming on the show
[1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:24.400]  today.
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:30.320]  Charlie Skelton, I heard you had problems again today with the supposed no-free speech
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:33.360]  in the EU.
[1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:34.360]  I did.
[1:38:34.360 --> 1:38:36.360]  I've had a strange day.
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:41.000]  I genuinely wanted to have a quiet day, keep my head down, not be arrested, and just write
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  some reports on Bilderberg.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:48.080]  It didn't turn out that way, because when I got up, went out of a hotel, I realized instantly
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:52.400]  I was being followed by plainclothes policemen.
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:55.200]  And it's been one of the most surreal days of my life.
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:38:56.800]  I've never been followed before.
[1:38:56.800 --> 1:39:02.080]  I'm probably not by girls, obviously, but not by plainclothes Greek policemen.
[1:39:02.080 --> 1:39:09.080]  And anyway, so yeah, I've just gone to the hotel, sorry, to the hotel, to the local police
[1:39:09.080 --> 1:39:13.720]  station for the second time today in order to complain about this, because I thought
[1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:15.840]  I'm going to try and deal with this rationally.
[1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:21.120]  I went lunchtime and I said, look, I'm not a threat.
[1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:25.400]  I think there's something badly wrong if you're following me around here.
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:30.040]  You know who I am, you've checked me out, I'm not a terrorist, I'm not about to kill David
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:31.040]  Rockefeller.
[1:39:31.040 --> 1:39:34.320]  You know, I'm nothing, I'm a nobody.
[1:39:34.320 --> 1:39:35.320]  Can you call them off?
[1:39:35.320 --> 1:39:37.680]  It's just getting annoying.
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:41.160]  And they were very nice and they said, yes, yes, yes.
[1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:44.680]  And then I didn't see anything for a couple of hours and just now I suddenly went, oh,
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:45.680]  here we go.
[1:39:45.680 --> 1:39:46.680]  I'm being followed again.
[1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:49.480]  And I've been really badly followed again for the last, I've been being followed now.
[1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:50.480]  This is weird.
[1:39:50.480 --> 1:39:52.720]  I'm on the phone, I'm being followed.
[1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:56.200]  It sounds very strange saying that I'm being followed, but I'm being followed by a plain
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:57.560]  clothes policeman along the street.
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:02.680]  Oh, try having four of them start punching you and saying you better stop reporting on
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:03.680]  this.
[1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:05.600]  You know, that's the next level of this Mr. Skelton.
[1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:07.880]  That's happened to me before now.
[1:40:07.880 --> 1:40:09.240]  Let's expand on this.
[1:40:09.240 --> 1:40:10.480]  Where are you?
[1:40:10.480 --> 1:40:11.480]  Where are the goons?
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:14.760]  You ought to just pull over and walk over and talk to them or they'll probably drive
[1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:15.760]  past you.
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:19.360]  I would pull over or if you're not in a car, stop, act like you're afraid because they
[1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:20.840]  get off on that.
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:24.800]  Then they'll start coming up closer, get photos and run up and talk to them with the
[1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:25.800]  phone.
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:26.800]  That's the way I would do this.
[1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:32.640]  Well, I've had a few conversations with them and, you know, I had one about 20 minutes
[1:40:32.640 --> 1:40:38.320]  ago with a guy where he, you know, I hate to say this about a police force of which
[1:40:38.320 --> 1:40:40.320]  I don't have much experience, but they don't seem very good.
[1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:44.160]  I mean, I'm not, I'm just, you know, I don't really have my experience of trying to avoid
[1:40:44.160 --> 1:40:45.160]  it.
[1:40:45.160 --> 1:40:46.160]  No, no, no, no.
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:50.080]  Terran, he's always run by guys that, no, no, I mean, they're guys that always, it's
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:54.560]  a mix in Soviet Russia, communist China, Nazi Germany, East Germany, people that look like
[1:40:54.560 --> 1:40:58.640]  they're 14 years old as I've seen the photos with potbelly thugs.
[1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:01.680]  This is, Terran, he always has morons working for it.
[1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:03.560]  So, so where are you now?
[1:41:03.560 --> 1:41:04.680]  Let's go talk to him right now.
[1:41:04.680 --> 1:41:10.960]  You were saying you were talking, they've gone now, there was a guy in a motorcycle.
[1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:11.960]  He circled off.
[1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:12.960]  I headed towards him.
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:13.960]  He circled off.
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:15.960]  So he'll be replaced in a minute.
[1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:17.960]  It's perfectly unbelievable.
[1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:22.520]  It's, I wrote today, it's like being in my own episode of the equalizer.
[1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:23.520]  It's just extraordinary.
[1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:27.280]  Now, what are you going to do when the media says, hold on, let me stop you, Mr. Skelton.
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:31.080]  What are you going to do when newspapers say you're a liar, Bilderberg doesn't exist and
[1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:32.480]  none of this happened?
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:35.080]  Well, I think I would refuse that.
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:36.880]  And they'll call you a cook.
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:40.480]  They'll say it just, they'll say, sir, they'll say Greece doesn't exist.
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:42.680]  You understand that's how they operate.
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:43.680]  I'm not kidding.
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:48.280]  You know, I get emails saying there's no European Union, really?
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:49.280]  Oh yeah.
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:53.560]  These people, Limbaugh says that the CFR doesn't exist.
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:54.560]  Oh my goodness.
[1:41:54.560 --> 1:41:57.760]  Anyways, I'm going to shut up, Mr. Skelton.
[1:41:57.760 --> 1:41:58.760]  You're on with us.
[1:41:58.760 --> 1:42:00.360]  Tell us what it's been like today.
[1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:01.480]  You say you've talked to him.
[1:42:01.480 --> 1:42:02.480]  Please continue.
[1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:08.000]  Well, I, I was just going to say that through about sort of 15, 20 minutes, it was very
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  exciting.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:10.800]  I've got to confess it was very exciting.
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:14.680]  I was being followed along, I managed to double back through a cafe, I managed to make my
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:19.280]  tail, I managed to talk to them, uh, make them admit they were policemen.
[1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:20.280]  I took their photograph.
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:21.280]  They didn't like that.
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:25.360]  And, um, uh, but hopefully that photograph has been published now on the Guardian website.
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:26.360]  No, that's the spirit.
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:27.360]  That's the spirit.
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:30.560]  But, you know, and then it was great.
[1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:32.960]  And then I went to the, I great, it wasn't great, obviously, I've been followed.
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:35.880]  But, um, then I went to the police station, I said, can you stop?
[1:42:35.880 --> 1:42:36.880]  They were very nice.
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:38.320]  And, uh, and they said, yes.
[1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:39.320]  And do you know what?
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:40.320]  And now I'm, I'm annoyed.
[1:42:40.320 --> 1:42:41.320]  I'm curious.
[1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:42.920]  And I feel threatened.
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:45.600]  I feel like I've been criminalized.
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:46.600]  I'm walking around.
[1:42:46.600 --> 1:42:52.320]  I'm, I, to the best of my knowledge, I'm a, uh, I'm a decent, upstanding citizen.
[1:42:52.320 --> 1:42:56.680]  And I've been criminalized by the presence of Bilderberg here by, they have put pressure
[1:42:56.680 --> 1:42:59.600]  onto the local police to follow me around.
[1:42:59.600 --> 1:43:00.600]  And that's just not fair.
[1:43:00.600 --> 1:43:01.600]  They can check me out.
[1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:02.600]  They know who I am.
[1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:05.200]  And can they not make a rational decision on that?
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:06.200]  No, they can't.
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:11.480]  They've got to harass me at a very low level, but it's very, it's just constant.
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:14.920]  And, uh, you know, uh, I'm really disheartened by it.
[1:43:14.920 --> 1:43:15.920]  I really am.
[1:43:15.920 --> 1:43:20.040]  Well, I'm reading some of the headlines of your latest dispatches, the one in Guardian,
[1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:21.240]  as they were on screen.
[1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:22.920]  It sounds almost apologetic.
[1:43:22.920 --> 1:43:24.600]  Like our man is sorry.
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:26.520]  He's causing so much trouble.
[1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:28.360]  Why are, why is that the spin?
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:33.600]  So it's bad secret police keep kidnapping you every day and taking you away.
[1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:35.120]  I mean, you were kidnapped twice.
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:39.440]  You know, when George Bush had a press conference, ordered me kidnapped for an hour and then
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:40.840]  they threw me out on the side of the highway.
[1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:41.840]  That was kidnapping.
[1:43:41.840 --> 1:43:45.720]  I mean, you've been kidnapped and instead it looks like the newspaper's apologizing
[1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:46.720]  for you.
[1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:47.720]  Well, no, that's me apologizing.
[1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:48.720]  That's me.
[1:43:48.720 --> 1:43:49.720]  That's my words.
[1:43:49.720 --> 1:43:54.760]  And I'm saying they're making in that piece, the point of making is that, uh, you know,
[1:43:54.760 --> 1:44:01.480]  I, I'm coming at this, you know, obviously as, as, as an English, uh, guy, I, uh, middle
[1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:05.520]  class, you know, well brought up, uh, by my middle class parents,
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:06.520]  That won't help you.
[1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:07.520]  They know you're in town.
[1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:10.520]  The way I want to deal with this needs to be polite, gentlemanly.
[1:44:10.520 --> 1:44:15.160]  I want to shake hands and say no hard feelings, awfully sorry, can't believe we got you into
[1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:16.160]  this.
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:17.920]  Everyone, you know, it's a terrible situation.
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:18.920]  Sorry, everyone.
[1:44:18.920 --> 1:44:20.600]  Oh, well, let's have a cup of tea, right?
[1:44:20.600 --> 1:44:24.240]  Now that's, that's basically my, the way I've been trying to handle it.
[1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:25.560]  You know, I've been very nice to them.
[1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:30.840]  I'm going to, I'm still nice, but you know, I haven't had that returned back to me and
[1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:32.800]  I'm, I feel let down by that.
[1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:34.640]  And I, you know, that's me being naive.
[1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:41.440]  I know, and I know you'll shout at me now, but, um, it's, I did kind of expect them to
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:46.920]  play the game in a, in a kind of honorable way and to say, okay, we know who you are,
[1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:48.360]  but uh, so we're going to leave you alone.
[1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:49.360]  You're not a threat.
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:54.400]  Listen, they're imploding the government by design, Mr. Skelton, Dinecore and Halliburton
[1:44:54.400 --> 1:45:02.600]  in the financial times of London, BBC, Chicago, Tribune, run giant child kidnapping rings.
[1:45:02.600 --> 1:45:06.960]  The CPS right here in Austin puts bounties out for, you know, what, uh, people, what
[1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:11.280]  adoption agencies, what type of kids they want and go out literally scoping kids out
[1:45:11.280 --> 1:45:14.120]  in public school and, and, and to steal.
[1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:18.720]  I mean, Mr. Skelton, the government is completely criminal worldwide.
[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:20.120]  They're not going to be gentlemanly.
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:22.120]  I mean, are you, I mean, are you kidding?
[1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:23.120]  These are criminals.
[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:28.160]  Uh, well, I'd like to make a distinction between, I'm sorry, it seems to be the whole neighborhood
[1:45:28.160 --> 1:45:29.160]  of dogs barking.
[1:45:29.160 --> 1:45:30.160]  Um, apologize for that.
[1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:34.680]  Uh, I'd like to make a distinction or maintain a distinction between the local police who
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:39.480]  are under pressure by, uh, you know, Bilderberg being here and they obviously are under pressure.
[1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:40.480]  I know that.
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:41.480]  I appreciate that.
[1:45:41.480 --> 1:45:43.120]  Uh, and you know, and they've been bought off or whatever.
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:47.640]  They just under some kind of under the thumb here, uh, and the distinction between them
[1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:52.360]  and the powers that be who are up the hill because basically the local police and me
[1:45:52.360 --> 1:45:54.600]  are at the same level of the pyramid.
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:59.480]  You know, they, they're just me, they just need wearing a silly hat, but, um, you know,
[1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:04.200]  the people up the hill are at the top of the pyramid and we meet neither me nor the police
[1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:05.760]  have got anything to do with them really.
[1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:09.600]  Unfortunately, these guys playing around with their guns and their motorcycles following
[1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:11.000]  me thinking it's such a funny game.
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  Isn't this brilliant?
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  We've got them under surveillance.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:16.720]  They're playing the, they're playing the big government's game and they're playing the
[1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:20.360]  Bilderberg game and it's, that's just infuriating.
[1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:23.520]  You just want to shake them and say, but God's sake, you're following the wrong person.
[1:46:23.520 --> 1:46:26.560]  Well, listen, but they're following the right person.
[1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:32.880]  You're the good guy with a major newspaper trying to show a criminal illegal, violating
[1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:35.160]  federal and I know British laws.
[1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:39.640]  They're in their setting policy and deciding, okay, you want all the power plants in Texas?
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:40.640]  Our guy, Perry's here.
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:41.640]  He'll give them to you.
[1:46:41.640 --> 1:46:42.640]  That actually happened two years ago.
[1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:45.880]  Oh, you want us to hand all the roads over in the U S to a foreign bank.
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:46.880]  Sure.
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:47.880]  Here they are.
[1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:48.880]  Oh, you want a world tax.
[1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:50.320]  You want, you know, I mean, the, the, look.
[1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:55.840]  If the military and police are there to guard the criminal elite, just like in Nazi Germany,
[1:46:55.840 --> 1:46:58.840]  you could say their police and military might not all been bad guys.
[1:46:58.840 --> 1:47:02.640]  In fact, a lot of them were nice guys bouncing babies on their knees when they were at home
[1:47:02.640 --> 1:47:04.740]  at nine and cleaning the dishes.
[1:47:04.740 --> 1:47:07.920]  But during the day, they were lining up families and pits and shooting them.
[1:47:07.920 --> 1:47:12.000]  And let me tell you this following orders to spy on Americans without warrants and this
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:16.360]  following orders to arrest now hundreds of citizens for photographing police in England
[1:47:16.360 --> 1:47:21.640]  under terror charges and, and, and, and you can't buy seeds now under EU law because you're
[1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:24.880]  a terrorist, you know, sir, we're going into bondage.
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:28.280]  That's what happens 99% of the time.
[1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:32.920]  That's why the Magna Carta and Bill of Rights and things like that created the new renaissance
[1:47:32.920 --> 1:47:33.920]  of liberty.
[1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:37.200]  And that's why these enemies of freedom are defecating all over them.
[1:47:37.200 --> 1:47:38.960]  And that's why they're enemies.
[1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:40.560]  They're enemies of everything good.
[1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:46.560]  These are Nazi commo Nazis, whatever you want to call them, they're scum, they're filth,
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:51.280]  they're trash, and we need to address them for what they are instead of apologizing.
[1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:54.200]  I'm, you know, you know, I've watched the famous footage of people in Soviet Russia
[1:47:54.200 --> 1:47:57.880]  being rounded up or people in Germany and, or people being rounded up in China and they're
[1:47:57.880 --> 1:48:01.360]  always apologetic to the police as they're being taken to their deaths.
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:03.960]  I'm not going to be apologetic to criminals.
[1:48:03.960 --> 1:48:05.800]  I don't care how many uniforms they've got.
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:06.800]  Go ahead.
[1:48:06.800 --> 1:48:12.040]  Well, I was just going to, I was just going to continue your thought but to say that what
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:17.920]  I think I've learned so far is that where, where I put my head above the parapet here
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:20.800]  is that I've become an adverticom as a member of the press.
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:22.240]  You know, I'm not really a reporter.
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:26.720]  I'm, you know, I work writing stuff for things, but I'm not, you know, I might be a writer,
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:30.080]  but I'm not a reporter, but I tell you what, as soon as I have a camera and as soon as
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:33.800]  I'm filing copy somewhere, anywhere, I become a threat.
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:38.280]  I become a voice and they hate, they prefer the voiceless and they hate someone with a
[1:48:38.280 --> 1:48:39.280]  voice.
[1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:41.680]  And I just think we're living in a, in a, for a brief period.
[1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:45.760]  I don't know how long in an age where it's technologically possible for everyone to become
[1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:46.760]  a reporter.
[1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:47.760]  Well, let me tell you what happened.
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:52.480]  You know, for everyone to carry, to stick a, to stick a lens in the, in the, in the
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:54.680]  windows of the delegates' cars as they go up to build a.
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:59.880]  And that's why the British government is saying photography in public is an act of terrorism
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:01.000]  because they don't want it.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:05.320]  And I agree with you, the power of the citizen press, not just a London guardian reporter
[1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:06.320]  is incredible.
[1:49:06.320 --> 1:49:08.320]  Now, let me expand on that.
[1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:11.400]  The Bilderberg group made the cold-blooded decision when they drive into events with
[1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:15.160]  black and windows, they hold newspapers up to their faces because they know they're engaging
[1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:18.800]  in criminal acts and, and, and, and, and, you know, taking over nations.
[1:49:18.800 --> 1:49:20.280]  Now you're there.
[1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:21.280]  This is happening.
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:23.600]  They made a cold-blooded decision because I've been told they've arrested and detained
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:24.600]  a bunch of people.
[1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:26.520]  And I want you to tell us about that.
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:27.880]  They've met the cold-blooded decision.
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:29.120]  This is kind of taking the gloves off.
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:33.440]  I've never seen it where they're just arresting and detaining people en masse two plus miles
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:35.280]  away, according to Tucker.
[1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:39.760]  So they've made a conscious decision to get all the bad publicity because they don't want
[1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:43.040]  anybody seeing who is at that meeting.
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:44.920]  Now tell us your take on that.
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:49.400]  Well, you know, their job would be made a lot harder if more people were here.
[1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:55.920]  I have to say, you know, and I, I, I please don't think I'm being self-righteous at all
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:58.000]  in saying that I think it's important that I'm here.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:49:59.880]  I think it's important that Jim Tucker is here.
[1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:04.120]  It's important that, you know, the guy I just spoke to from Romania, he's here.
[1:50:04.120 --> 1:50:07.680]  It's important that Bernie, who went out on the boat to try and get near to take photographs
[1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:09.680]  with them from the sea is, is, is here.
[1:50:09.680 --> 1:50:12.080]  I think it's all important.
[1:50:12.080 --> 1:50:14.240]  And you know what?
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:18.800]  We might be entering an age where everyone has to just change what they do a little bit
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:22.600]  and become a little bit more active and, you know, just a little bit.
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:23.600]  Just a little bit.
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:27.760]  Just pick up a camera a bit more often, write something a bit more other than one of them.
[1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:28.760]  You've done it.
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:29.760]  You've done it.
[1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:30.760]  Oh, another one.
[1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:32.760]  You know, another secret policeman who's shown up now.
[1:50:32.760 --> 1:50:33.760]  Yeah.
[1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:34.760]  Oh, he's circled off.
[1:50:34.760 --> 1:50:36.760]  Oh, to be honest, I think it's on bicycles now.
[1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:38.360]  I think it's because I'm doing a lot of walking.
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:40.760]  They're getting bored of walking after me.
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:43.240]  Anyway, um, so, sorry, I was just saying, you know, it's,
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:44.240]  Stay there.
[1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:45.240]  We're going to come back, sir.
[1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:47.000]  We're going to come back because I want you to tell us what you've seen.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:51.920]  If you got out in the ocean, what happened, who else you've seen being detained or arrested?
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:57.440]  He's Charlie Skelton, Bilderberg 2009 exclusive coverage right here, the tip of the spear.
[1:50:57.440 --> 1:50:58.440]  It is the info war.
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:01.840]  I am Alex Jones.
[1:51:01.840 --> 1:51:06.880]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:10.680]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:51:10.680 --> 1:51:15.600]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[1:51:15.600 --> 1:51:19.160]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:51:19.160 --> 1:51:23.720]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:24.920]  across America.
[1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:28.720]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[1:51:28.720 --> 1:51:32.400]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:51:32.400 --> 1:51:33.400]  healthier I feel.
[1:51:33.400 --> 1:51:36.040]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:51:36.040 --> 1:51:41.240]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[1:51:41.240 --> 1:51:43.760]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:52:01.680 --> 1:52:07.520]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:07.520 --> 1:52:13.560]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:52:13.560 --> 1:52:15.080]  just as well funded.
[1:52:15.080 --> 1:52:20.240]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:52:20.240 --> 1:52:21.240]  of the American people.
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:25.760]  Well Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:25.760 --> 1:52:31.160]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:52:31.160 --> 1:52:37.680]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:52:37.680 --> 1:52:41.240]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:48.160]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:56.360]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[1:52:56.360 --> 1:53:01.120]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:04.520]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:09.160]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[1:53:09.160 --> 1:53:12.680]  It's called protogrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems
[1:53:12.680 --> 1:53:17.360]  to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:20.960]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[1:53:20.960 --> 1:53:25.000]  Protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:28.440]  bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[1:53:28.440 --> 1:53:31.680]  Protogrow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock
[1:53:31.680 --> 1:53:34.240]  the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:37.280]  Protogrow's full spectrum plant fertility needs fruits and vegetables with extraordinary
[1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:39.800]  taste enough to 10 times the nutritional value.
[1:53:39.800 --> 1:53:43.320]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[1:53:43.320 --> 1:53:46.880]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[1:53:46.880 --> 1:53:50.440]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfood should visit the protogrow website
[1:53:50.440 --> 1:53:51.920]  at growlikecrazy.com.
[1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:57.560]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[1:53:57.560 --> 1:54:03.640]  That's 877-327-0365.
[1:54:03.640 --> 1:54:10.200]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:54:10.200 --> 1:54:19.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:29.400]  All right, Charles Skelton, I've been all over the map here, just subsets me to hear
[1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:30.400]  what's happening to you.
[1:54:30.400 --> 1:54:34.200]  Give us a brief, and I appreciate your time, Lennon Guardian reporter joining us from Bilderberg
[1:54:34.200 --> 1:54:35.200]  2009.
[1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:36.200]  A chronological thing.
[1:54:36.200 --> 1:54:39.600]  So you tried to go out in a boat, what happened there, what have you heard about other reporters
[1:54:39.600 --> 1:54:40.600]  being arrested?
[1:54:40.600 --> 1:54:43.600]  Tucker says they're all coming back to meet him at 7, 8 o'clock at night.
[1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:46.560]  He had just talked to him when he came on the show with us, and he said there's a whole
[1:54:46.560 --> 1:54:49.440]  bunch of people getting arrested and detained miles away.
[1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:51.240]  He said two and a half miles away.
[1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:52.240]  What can you tell us?
[1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:58.800]  Well, I've only briefly spoken to a couple of them, and the remaining guy who I believe
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:08.120]  has provided you some footage, enjoyed you today, has been detained, and he managed to
[1:55:08.120 --> 1:55:10.120]  record them, I think, most being detained.
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:13.560]  And Bernie, who I'm afraid I don't know his second name, I think he's from the American
[1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:14.560]  Free Press.
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:18.280]  He went out on the boat, but he said they didn't get within three miles before the Greek Navy
[1:55:18.280 --> 1:55:20.880]  came along and turned the boat around.
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:24.080]  So now you can't even get out the public harbor.
[1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:26.080]  I mean, now you can't even go out in the public harbor.
[1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:27.760]  It's like the gods have landed.
[1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:28.760]  That's the end of it.
[1:55:28.760 --> 1:55:29.760]  Yeah.
[1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:34.480]  I mean, the point that's fascinating about that is that here's a, and what that alarm
[1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:38.240]  is, so I'm going to go away from it, what's fascinating is that here's a situation where
[1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:43.760]  the, you know, people out on the boat are being turned away by the Greek Navy from approaching
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:47.200]  within three miles of a hotel, and it's still not being reported on.
[1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:50.200]  And it's this, I don't quite understand.
[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:56.040]  You know, I'm going to come away from this conference with that one question foremost
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:55:57.040]  in my mind.
[1:55:57.040 --> 1:56:00.360]  I don't understand why it's not being talked about in the press.
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:05.680]  And I know the easy answer is to say that there's a blanket pressure from the top on
[1:56:05.680 --> 1:56:07.840]  each of these newspapers and media outlets.
[1:56:07.840 --> 1:56:08.840]  You know what?
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:09.840]  Maybe that's the case.
[1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:10.840]  I don't know.
[1:56:10.840 --> 1:56:16.640]  But even so, even from within and from below and where is it anywhere, you know, you put
[1:56:16.640 --> 1:56:22.120]  Bilderberg into Google News and it's PrismPlanet.com, PrismPlanet, PrismPlanet, The Guardian, PrismPlanet,
[1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:25.040]  that one article in The Times, and that's about it.
[1:56:25.040 --> 1:56:26.040]  You know, and that's depressing.
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:27.880]  Is that the best that we can do?
[1:56:27.880 --> 1:56:31.240]  Is that the best reporting that we can put together as a globe?
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:33.040]  Jesus, it's pathetic.
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:35.400]  Well, we're getting millions of people.
[1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:36.400]  I'm going to be downbeat today.
[1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:37.400]  I realize.
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:40.160]  No, no, millions of people are Googling Bilderberg and they're finding PrismPlanet.
[1:56:40.160 --> 1:56:42.600]  So see that backfires on the mainstream media.
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:47.360]  That's why we're seeing some reportage now from some mainstream media because they're
[1:56:47.360 --> 1:56:50.760]  losing so much credibility and media market share.
[1:56:50.760 --> 1:56:54.840]  See, the media has denied all this existed until about six, seven years ago.
[1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:59.280]  Now they go, okay, they want world government and they've had mom be out of your own paper,
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:01.360]  come out and say, yeah, we need world government.
[1:57:01.360 --> 1:57:04.960]  He said that yesterday and, yeah, you know, and people that are against it are kind of
[1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:05.960]  kooks.
[1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:07.520]  So go ahead and, you know, don't let them have free speech.
[1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:09.160]  You know, that's kind of where this goes.
[1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:13.040]  But then other reporters said this didn't exist all these years.
[1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:14.880]  They don't want to admit they're wrong.
[1:57:14.880 --> 1:57:18.640]  So it is pressure with the Financial Times of London owned by Bilderberg Group member
[1:57:18.640 --> 1:57:23.040]  Mr. Wolfe, with the Wall Street Journal and stuff with News Corp.
[1:57:23.040 --> 1:57:26.000]  The Bilderberg Group member, he's certainly been there.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:32.360]  There's members and there's guests, Rupert Murdoch, they do have a news blackout on all
[1:57:32.360 --> 1:57:37.760]  of this, but we've exposed it so much that now it just discredits them.
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:39.000]  But you're right.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:41.880]  Having people for two and a half mile, three mile radius is arrested.
[1:57:41.880 --> 1:57:45.520]  You know, that's big news right there alone.
[1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:47.120]  Where do you see this going?
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:50.920]  Well, I think you're absolutely right about credibility.
[1:57:50.920 --> 1:57:57.200]  I think that, you know, with enough different voices all standing here and pointing at it
[1:57:57.200 --> 1:58:00.640]  and going, look, whatever else is happening, whatever you say about it, whether it's good
[1:58:00.640 --> 1:58:03.720]  or bad, these limousines did just pull up.
[1:58:03.720 --> 1:58:05.440]  These helicopters are circling above.
[1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:10.000]  There are people with machine guns there, there are some people in there and they are
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  discussing something.
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:13.320]  Is that not a news story?
[1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:14.320]  Is that not news?
[1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:18.440]  And I think that if you're not covering that and you're deciding to just put an extra page
[1:58:18.440 --> 1:58:27.120]  in the paper to cover some soap opera or whatever or sports event, then you have to lose credibility.
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:28.120]  Surely.
[1:58:28.120 --> 1:58:37.120]  If you have any shred of self-respect as a news editor, surely you're giving it some place.
[1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:39.440]  Thank goodness for the time.
[1:58:39.440 --> 1:58:40.440]  Absolutely.
[1:58:40.440 --> 1:58:41.440]  Stay there.
[1:58:41.440 --> 1:58:42.440]  One more segment.
[1:58:42.440 --> 1:58:45.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:45.480 --> 1:58:51.240]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.240 --> 1:58:52.240]  Hello friends.
[1:58:52.240 --> 1:58:53.240]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:58:53.240 --> 1:58:56.680]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[1:58:56.680 --> 1:58:57.680]  important than ever.
[1:58:57.680 --> 1:59:00.680]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[1:59:00.680 --> 1:59:03.480]  You'll never have to stand in a red line when you have your own bread.
[1:59:03.480 --> 1:59:07.480]  You'll never have to go to the superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in
[1:59:07.480 --> 1:59:09.720]  any emergency if you simply prepare.
[1:59:09.720 --> 1:59:13.000]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation between you.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:17.320]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[1:59:17.320 --> 1:59:21.680]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of
[1:59:21.680 --> 1:59:23.280]  last year's grocery prices.
[1:59:23.280 --> 1:59:28.600]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[1:59:33.280 --> 1:59:34.760]  foods they have to offer.

[1:59:42.760 --> 1:59:46.120]  or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:59:46.120 --> 1:59:47.120]  Take action today.
[1:59:47.120 --> 2:00:13.600]  The first step is getting storeable food.
[2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:27.960]  We are back live, the Bilderberg group is now in the day number two and day three tomorrow
[2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:28.960]  into Sunday.
[2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:34.400]  We'll have a big report for you, 4-6 p.m. Central Standard Time, abbreviated Sunday
[2:00:34.400 --> 2:00:35.400]  Addition.
[2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:39.600]  We'll probably have reports again from the final day of Bilderberg as it's breaking
[2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:40.600]  up and leaving.
[2:00:40.600 --> 2:00:44.400]  You can be two miles away, three miles away trying to get them coming in on the highway
[2:00:44.400 --> 2:00:45.400]  or leaving.
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:50.320]  We'll see on Sunday if people get arrested even trying to videotape the gods leaving
[2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:54.400]  because the men in black limousines with helicopters and troops, they don't exist.
[2:00:54.400 --> 2:00:58.520]  The World Bankers meeting with the royalty when we get their own documents that Jim
[2:00:58.520 --> 2:01:02.920]  Tucker stolen from them before and things openly bragging about world government, none
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:03.920]  of that exists.
[2:01:03.920 --> 2:01:08.240]  So, got to tell the public there just happens to be army and police out here arresting you
[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:09.560]  if you come near.
[2:01:09.560 --> 2:01:11.920]  Things going on, go away.
[2:01:11.920 --> 2:01:15.000]  We're talking in this segment and a little bit into the next, we'll be gone by 10 after.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.280]  We have several other guests and a bunch of other news.
[2:01:17.280 --> 2:01:22.560]  We're going to be covering and I appreciate Charlie Skelton with the Guardian being nice
[2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:23.560]  and coming on.
[2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:27.480]  You know, I saw his first report back on Monday or Tuesday saying, I'm going to Bilderberg
[2:01:27.480 --> 2:01:31.160]  to see if it exists and we kind of said, look, they're going to send this comedy writer
[2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:32.160]  there to make fun of it.
[2:01:32.160 --> 2:01:36.560]  Then I found out his wife's a listener, he's a listener and that, you know, that it was
[2:01:36.560 --> 2:01:39.680]  his idea to go to Bilderberg, but I think that was kind of there, I had to pick him
[2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:42.400]  maybe thinking that, oh, well, he's not an official journalist.
[2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:47.520]  We can kind of poo poo it and we have to ask, why is he the guy that was sent from one of
[2:01:47.520 --> 2:01:48.520]  the biggest papers in the world?
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:52.360]  I mean, it's in the top 10, I think I pulled up its ratings.
[2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:55.760]  They say it's the sixth or seventh largest paper in the world.
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:01:56.760]  Why is he there?
[2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:01.320]  But I think that's maybe backfired on them because he isn't a mind controlled mainline
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:05.440]  journalist like mom be out there calling for world government, the same newspaper.
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:07.400]  Why do you think they sent you?
[2:02:07.400 --> 2:02:10.920]  Why do you think, I mean, you pointed out nobody's going to this, would you like to
[2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:11.920]  send me?
[2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:12.920]  I mean, how did that happen?
[2:02:12.920 --> 2:02:18.920]  Yeah, do it, 10 o'clock, I'll be there at 10 o'clock, okay, 10 o'clock.
[2:02:18.920 --> 2:02:23.560]  Hey, who was that talking to you, Mr. Skelton?
[2:02:23.560 --> 2:02:29.240]  One of them, it's really bizarre, I wish I wouldn't have been babbling when the secret
[2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:30.360]  police came up.
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:32.800]  Tell me, oh, he was polite, he waited until you quit talking.
[2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:35.600]  What did the police officer say to you this time?
[2:02:35.600 --> 2:02:40.560]  Nothing, I just sort of, I turned around and came up in his face again as I've been doing
[2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:41.560]  all the time.
[2:02:41.560 --> 2:02:43.560]  I'm talking to you now, two things are happening.
[2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:45.560]  One, I'm having a conversation with you.
[2:02:45.560 --> 2:02:52.160]  At number two, I'm walking around a small suburb up on the hill with about sort of poor policemen
[2:02:52.160 --> 2:02:56.120]  in playing clothes on various corners and streets and I'm sort of double backing and
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:03:01.120]  saying hello to them and dodging them and I sort of, it almost is a game for myself
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:02.120]  and I'm trying.
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:03.120]  Can we talk to him?
[2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:04.120]  Can we talk to him?
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:08.040]  I know it's not a game, I know it's not a game and you know, that guy didn't really
[2:03:08.040 --> 2:03:10.120]  speak much English so that wouldn't have been a good one.
[2:03:10.120 --> 2:03:12.120]  What was he saying about 10 o'clock?
[2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:16.760]  Oh, I was telling him, I'm going to go back to the station at 10 just to try and clear
[2:03:16.760 --> 2:03:17.760]  up.
[2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:19.680]  Apparently there's a change of command at 10 o'clock and the guy at the gate who's
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:23.080]  quite nice just said, the young guy just said, look, don't speak to the one now, speak
[2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:24.280]  to the one at 10 o'clock.
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:28.640]  You might get somewhere with him, but obviously I won't get anywhere because the amount of
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:32.920]  pressure I can put on these compared to the amount of pressure David Rockefeller can put
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:36.720]  on these, it's slightly different, so I've got a feeling that my request to be left
[2:03:36.720 --> 2:03:37.720]  behind.
[2:03:37.720 --> 2:03:40.880]  But wait a minute, David Rockefeller doesn't exist.
[2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:45.720]  There's no world government, he just wrote his memoir four years ago saying he wants
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:55.120]  to overthrow the US, I mean, Mr. Skelton, there's no world government, Mr. Skelton.
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:04:01.520]  Well, I kind of feel the tentacles of the world government tickling me on the back of
[2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:04.040]  my neck at the moment, and it's not a nice feeling.
[2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:07.760]  Well, what's wrong with him setting up a world government to carry out eugenics and a one
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:12.840]  child policy and taxing you with carbon taxes to micromanage every facet of your life?
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:16.880]  I mean, what's wrong with him banning all your liberties?
[2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:21.440]  To answer your question, I think it is wrong in so many different ways that it's almost
[2:04:21.440 --> 2:04:23.840]  impossible to get your head around it.
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:27.960]  It's almost incomprehensibly bad, and it's so big.
[2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:31.680]  I wrote about this the other day, it's a bit like, I don't know, when you've read the Edgar
[2:04:31.680 --> 2:04:36.960]  Unpo short story where someone hides something in plain view, it's the following letter,
[2:04:36.960 --> 2:04:40.480]  and it's a story about, I'm not going to give it away now, so close your ears if you don't
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:46.080]  hear this, but a letter is stolen and it's hidden in plain view on the wall, and in the
[2:04:46.080 --> 2:04:51.520]  story Edgar Unpo talks about how if you look at a map and look for a word, you won't be
[2:04:51.520 --> 2:04:55.000]  able to see the word if it's the large word written right across in massive letters because
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  you're looking close up.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  And I sort of think that's a good thing.
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  Stay there, this is key!
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:01.560]  This is key, you're talking about a spell!
[2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:05.560]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no
[2:05:05.560 --> 2:05:10.200]  longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:15.520]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:20.680]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[2:06:01.840 --> 2:06:07.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:06:07.200 --> 2:06:13.600]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:06:13.600 --> 2:06:15.240]  just as well funded.
[2:06:15.240 --> 2:06:20.400]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:06:20.400 --> 2:06:21.880]  of the American people.
[2:06:21.880 --> 2:06:26.280]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[2:06:26.280 --> 2:06:31.400]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:06:31.400 --> 2:06:37.920]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:06:37.920 --> 2:06:41.480]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[2:06:41.480 --> 2:06:48.360]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:07:00.360 --> 2:07:05.360]  Hi, my name is MZ, owner of KSCO in Santa Cruz, California.
[2:07:05.360 --> 2:07:09.880]  And like Alex Jones, I'm passionate about talk radio, that great bastion of freedom
[2:07:09.880 --> 2:07:11.240]  of expression for us all.
[2:07:11.240 --> 2:07:15.160]  I'm also passionate about helping people know the joys, benefits, and surprisingly simple
[2:07:15.160 --> 2:07:19.760]  methods of becoming entrepreneurs who work for themselves and not as wage slaves for
[2:07:19.760 --> 2:07:24.600]  someone else, or even worse, for large companies with no heart and soul, nor loyalty to their
[2:07:24.600 --> 2:07:25.600]  employees.
[2:07:25.600 --> 2:07:29.520]  If you're tired of being dependent on others for a living and ready to start owning yourself,
[2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:33.240]  loving your work, and setting the sky as the limit for your earning potential, I want you

[2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:07.240]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's
[2:08:07.240 --> 2:08:31.240]  a war on for your mind.
[2:08:31.240 --> 2:08:38.240]  You know, once Charlie Skelton of London Guardian is back in the U.K., out of one police state
[2:08:38.240 --> 2:08:42.320]  and into another, back from Bilderberg 2009, I want to have him on for like a full hour
[2:08:42.320 --> 2:08:45.840]  and fully brief him, and I really want to thank you, sir, for your courage and what
[2:08:45.840 --> 2:08:49.640]  you've done, and I don't want to say your transformation, but you've certainly now been
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:53.480]  baptized in the tyranny and know how real it is, and that's what I encourage listeners
[2:08:53.480 --> 2:08:54.480]  to do.
[2:08:54.480 --> 2:08:57.200]  Go out, as you said, become citizen activist media.
[2:08:57.200 --> 2:08:59.720]  You will run into tyranny and corruption everywhere.
[2:08:59.720 --> 2:09:03.800]  And it's so corrupt that if you follow almost any judge that you see that's doing evil
[2:09:03.800 --> 2:09:08.080]  things, you'll catch him with hookers and buying drugs, and I mean, I've never found
[2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:11.880]  a politician that wasn't corrupt, you know, that was doing bad things that I couldn't
[2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:16.920]  follow or watch who wouldn't instantly do bad because bad people don't just do one
[2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:17.920]  bad thing.
[2:09:17.920 --> 2:09:19.320]  They just are all over the map.
[2:09:19.320 --> 2:09:23.120]  And if we start following them, videotaping them, going to city council meetings, hanging
[2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:28.680]  out in parking lots, following city council members as citizen media, I mean, it's unbelievable.
[2:09:28.680 --> 2:09:30.760]  People just immediately see evil.
[2:09:30.760 --> 2:09:35.880]  These people just run around continually engaged in wickedness, as the Bible says.
[2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:41.080]  And you know, going and covering global elitists, going and doing everything you're doing.
[2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:42.080]  I just want to commend you.
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:45.760]  And if the citizens start covering what government's doing and ferreting things out and looking
[2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:49.280]  at legislation, there's no way they can get away with this if we all just do a little
[2:09:49.280 --> 2:09:50.280]  bit.
[2:09:50.280 --> 2:09:54.640]  So you're there walking around in Greece with secret police following you everywhere as
[2:09:54.640 --> 2:10:02.240]  the sun is now set, and I appreciate you coming all this closing comments are from you, Charlie
[2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:06.680]  Skelton, reporter for the London Guarding and there at Bilderberg 2009 when you were
[2:10:06.680 --> 2:10:09.040]  finishing up your, your hidden in plain view analogy.
[2:10:09.040 --> 2:10:15.240]  Well, I just finished that point and close off on that, which is that one of the problems
[2:10:15.240 --> 2:10:19.960]  with, you know, what you're engaged in, what anyone who's engaged in alternative thinking,
[2:10:19.960 --> 2:10:24.640]  one of the problems the face system is what do you pick every, even if you were to just
[2:10:24.640 --> 2:10:31.040]  pick one thing, for example, the lies concerning the Iraq war or the, or the, the, the taking
[2:10:31.040 --> 2:10:36.840]  over of genetic, you know, seed varieties by large corporations, any one of those things
[2:10:36.840 --> 2:10:39.640]  is enough to absolutely blow anyone's mind.
[2:10:39.640 --> 2:10:42.840]  And they are, you know, that's, that's the trouble that's so big.
[2:10:42.840 --> 2:10:43.840]  The problem is enormous.
[2:10:43.840 --> 2:10:47.840]  And, you know, I'm, you know, I'm talking to myself here, I don't know what to do.
[2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:51.280]  And I guess one thing you can do is just simply pick something, you know, pick something
[2:10:51.280 --> 2:10:54.200]  and go, you know, I get, do you know what I'm going to do for the next five years?
[2:10:54.200 --> 2:10:59.880]  I'm going to be a bit interested in protecting seed varieties or a bit interested in monitoring
[2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:07.520]  European legislation or a bit interested in, in picking up politicians lies about Iraq
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:10.760]  or, or defense or gaps in defense spending.
[2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:12.000]  One thing I'm going to make it my thing.
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  I don't know.
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  Maybe that's an answer.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  I don't know what the answer is.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  There's lots of possible answers with the question.
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:20.760]  So you were saying exactly what I've instinctively said for you for over a decade or 14 years
[2:11:20.760 --> 2:11:24.120]  now is that absolutely be generalist.
[2:11:24.120 --> 2:11:28.560]  Everybody be involved in different things, different ideas and don't follow one person's
[2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:29.560]  ideas.
[2:11:29.560 --> 2:11:30.560]  So keep an open mind.
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:31.560]  Yeah.
[2:11:31.560 --> 2:11:32.800]  Just don't be cookie cutter.
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:35.080]  And then you'll suddenly notice I live in England.
[2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:39.440]  I just tried to buy old seed varieties and I'm being put on a list.
[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:43.040]  Everywhere you go, then you'll run into tyranny and you'll go, my God, this was a thousand
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:46.160]  times worse than I actually even knew.
[2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:48.760]  And then it opens up and what you said is key.
[2:11:48.760 --> 2:11:53.040]  The globalists make profits off of controlling every facet of society.
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:54.360]  And so it's also their market.
[2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:58.440]  They use a free market system of crony capitalism.
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:02.240]  It's not true capitalism or free market to control everything.
[2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:06.640]  And so that's why they're hitting you from every angle because it's business for them.
[2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:09.200]  And exactly one of these will blow your mind.
[2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:15.320]  There are hundreds of these coming in at you and that's why the general public comes face
[2:12:15.320 --> 2:12:19.160]  to face with the conspiracy so massive that they're just knocked over by it.
[2:12:19.160 --> 2:12:25.320]  As Winston Churchill said, or as the former head of the FBI, Jagger Hoover said, that
[2:12:25.320 --> 2:12:27.960]  you come face to face and the globalists write books about it.
[2:12:27.960 --> 2:12:29.400]  It's not even our opinion.
[2:12:29.400 --> 2:12:30.920]  And they're laughing.
[2:12:30.920 --> 2:12:33.880]  When you read their books, they're laughing going, I know you're reading this.
[2:12:33.880 --> 2:12:35.720]  None of your little slave friends will help you.
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:39.320]  I mean, they've got little statements, you know, basically like that and you're going,
[2:12:39.320 --> 2:12:40.840]  none of my slave friends will help me.
[2:12:40.840 --> 2:12:44.800]  My God, these people are directly talking to the members of the public that actually
[2:12:44.800 --> 2:12:49.400]  read this and you're just like, can't we wake the sheep up to beat these people?
[2:12:49.400 --> 2:12:51.200]  So we appreciate your courage.
[2:12:51.200 --> 2:12:54.320]  Maybe I can get you on for 15, 20 minutes on Sunday.
[2:12:54.320 --> 2:12:55.440]  We're on four to six p.m.
[2:12:55.440 --> 2:12:59.380]  So I'll have Rob call you and we're very thankful for all your time.
[2:12:59.380 --> 2:13:01.320]  Anything we can do for you, Mr. Skelton?
[2:13:01.320 --> 2:13:03.440]  No, no, I'm fine.
[2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:06.560]  I'm probably going to head back towards the lights now that the sun's gone down.
[2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:09.240]  I don't like being followed in the dark, so I'm going to go and sit in a brightly lit
[2:13:09.240 --> 2:13:10.640]  cafe on the sea front.
[2:13:10.640 --> 2:13:11.640]  Okay.
[2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:14.560]  And what's the name of the Edgar Allen post or you didn't finish that about the, uh,
[2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:15.560]  the, uh,
[2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:16.560]  Oh, that's just it.
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:17.560]  Well, that was just, it's the following letter.
[2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:21.520]  It's just a good metaphor for, for how global agenda is passed across people's eyes without
[2:13:21.520 --> 2:13:22.520]  them even seeing it.
[2:13:22.520 --> 2:13:24.160]  It's, it's too big to see.
[2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:25.160]  Absolutely.
[2:13:25.160 --> 2:13:26.800]  They're too close to it.
[2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:28.000]  Thank you so much, Mr. Skelton.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:29.240]  We'll talk to you soon.
[2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:30.240]  Okay.
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:31.240]  Thanks.
[2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:32.240]  Thank you.
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:36.160]  Now here, arrested twice, detained another time, people being arrested left and right,
[2:13:36.160 --> 2:13:40.100]  miles away from the facility, three miles away in the port, which is a big, we've got
[2:13:40.100 --> 2:13:45.300]  photos, big thriving port with sailboats and everything all just shut down, uh, just absolutely
[2:13:45.300 --> 2:13:46.300]  amazing.
[2:13:46.300 --> 2:13:47.300]  Okay.
[2:13:47.300 --> 2:13:52.960]  Coming up, we've got Mark Marano, a, uh, congressman's aide who's been, it has one
[2:13:52.960 --> 2:13:58.060]  of the biggest websites exposing the global warming fraud, that it's not man made, that
[2:13:58.060 --> 2:14:05.460]  natural 11-year cycle. It's like we have four seasons, autumn, winter, spring, summer. Pretty
[2:14:05.460 --> 2:14:08.660]  soon they'll tell school kids, you know, no, summer is global warming or not. It's not
[2:14:08.660 --> 2:14:12.740]  supposed to get hot or it's not supposed to get cold. It's a nice age. We have an 11-year
[2:14:12.740 --> 2:14:17.300]  sun cycle and there's some other earth cycles as well. And we got him coming up and then
[2:14:17.300 --> 2:14:20.740]  Bob Chapman in the last hour. But right now until the break, the next six, seven minutes,
[2:14:20.740 --> 2:14:25.580]  I wanted to bring Steve Shank up because he's one of our best sponsors. He makes so much
[2:14:25.580 --> 2:14:30.580]  what we do here possible. And he's always offering new plans, new ideas for folks to
[2:14:30.580 --> 2:14:36.180]  get high quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid, storeable foods. And, you know, I've told folks that
[2:14:36.180 --> 2:14:39.460]  do whatever you have to, even if you get a one-month supply, a two-month, a three-month,
[2:14:39.460 --> 2:14:43.700]  these are small. They have the, you know, getaway packs that fit in your trunk. They'll feed
[2:14:43.700 --> 2:14:50.740]  a one person 50% more calories than they even need, or as 150% or as it double, you know,
[2:14:50.740 --> 2:14:55.540]  and a little stove that comes with it, everything. I believe in getting self-sufficient. I believe
[2:14:55.540 --> 2:15:00.020]  in being able to take care of yourself. The globalists want us domesticated and he's got
[2:15:00.020 --> 2:15:05.540]  some new programs and new offers. He wanted to tell the folks that visit eFoodsDirect.com
[2:15:05.540 --> 2:15:08.420]  about Steve Shank joining us. Thanks for coming on.
[2:15:08.420 --> 2:15:14.180]  Hey, Alex, we've just had a fire drill haven't we with this swine food fiasco.
[2:15:14.180 --> 2:15:17.940]  Well, the globalists clearly engineered it. That's now admitted its designer. As we said
[2:15:17.940 --> 2:15:22.580]  day one, they're now saying it's going to mutate in the fall and kill us. And we just
[2:15:22.580 --> 2:15:26.620]  posted an article at prisonplanet.com. They're saying they're going to go to level six now,
[2:15:26.620 --> 2:15:32.820]  even though it only killed two people in the U.S. So, yes, it's a fraud, but Jim Tucker
[2:15:32.820 --> 2:15:37.620]  confirmed in Bilderberg that they are planning to use this to bring in world government and
[2:15:37.620 --> 2:15:42.220]  a world government control over health, a world government control over courts, world
[2:15:42.220 --> 2:15:46.460]  government control over taxes, a world army. It's all being formulated right now at Bilderberg
[2:15:46.460 --> 2:15:47.460]  2009.
[2:15:47.460 --> 2:15:53.700]  Well, the problem that we have, Alex, is that this is just another step in cooking frogs.
[2:15:53.700 --> 2:15:58.660]  We've talked about that before. And what has happened as a result of this thing coming,
[2:15:58.660 --> 2:16:07.380]  a big splash, then dying down, is that we're in the most dangerous time for our people
[2:16:07.380 --> 2:16:13.900]  in their minds because nothing happened. It's like Y2K. Nothing happened. Most disasters
[2:16:13.900 --> 2:16:18.100]  are geographically limited, so the rest of the nation can look and say, well, Katrina
[2:16:18.100 --> 2:16:24.300]  was a mess. Let's do something for ourselves. And in this case, it was nationwide. And now
[2:16:24.300 --> 2:16:28.300]  everybody's gone into complacency. The birds are singing, the sun is shining. And this
[2:16:28.300 --> 2:16:32.580]  is the most dangerous time in the world for the simple reason. It will come back, but
[2:16:32.580 --> 2:16:38.500]  we're like people on death row that have said, okay, I've got a three-month reprieve. I don't
[2:16:38.500 --> 2:16:44.540]  have to keep calling my lawyers. I can sit back and say, oh, man, what a relief. And
[2:16:44.540 --> 2:16:46.820]  that is the most dangerous thing that we can have.
[2:16:46.820 --> 2:16:50.620]  Well, regardless, Steve, you got the depression in their engineering. We have their documents.
[2:16:50.620 --> 2:16:54.580]  That's confirmed. IMF World Bank and internal Bilderberg. They're engineering new wars with
[2:16:54.580 --> 2:17:00.300]  Iran, Pakistan. The World Health Organization is saying it's going to come back in the fall.
[2:17:00.300 --> 2:17:04.780]  I think it's all a big fraud, but that's their cover for something bigger. Their excuse for
[2:17:04.780 --> 2:17:09.460]  martial law is the economy implodes. People need firearms. They need water filters. They
[2:17:09.460 --> 2:17:13.020]  need high-quality, storable food. You're the place to get the food and some of the water
[2:17:13.020 --> 2:17:17.820]  filters. Tell folks about some of the things you're offering and the new thing you've got
[2:17:17.820 --> 2:17:21.420]  for folks, because a lot of folks, including Derek, our sales guy, he lives in a little
[2:17:21.420 --> 2:17:24.660]  apartment. That's why he's never gotten storable food, which I think is crazy.
[2:17:24.660 --> 2:17:30.260]  That's right. What we've come up with is something called a one-year stowaway. What this is is
[2:17:30.260 --> 2:17:37.500]  something that people can go on the website, reserve a one-year supply of food. They can
[2:17:37.500 --> 2:17:43.940]  make monthly payments on it. It will be stored. We've acquired a brand new warehouse that
[2:17:43.940 --> 2:17:49.180]  is climate-controlled. We'll store it here. For those folks that are traveling around
[2:17:49.180 --> 2:17:53.900]  the country that are in a situation where they can't keep their food where they are
[2:17:53.900 --> 2:17:57.940]  or they don't know where they're going to be, this is absolutely ideal. They'll be
[2:17:57.940 --> 2:18:02.340]  able to call. Within 48 hours, it'll be shipped to wherever they need it.
[2:18:02.340 --> 2:18:07.620]  The whole idea behind this is that people can break the cost of it down and they can
[2:18:07.620 --> 2:18:13.940]  put in the food that they need. What we learned, we learned something during this last announcement.
[2:18:13.940 --> 2:18:18.700]  The day after, the one working day, the first working day after they announced the bird
[2:18:18.700 --> 2:18:24.300]  flu issue, or not the bird flu, the swine flu issue, we had our lines just jammed up.
[2:18:24.300 --> 2:18:29.020]  The warehouse was covered up and this will not work. It's like people trying to get
[2:18:29.020 --> 2:18:34.300]  out of a disaster area the last minute and they get traffic jammed unless people get
[2:18:34.300 --> 2:18:39.500]  their food in immediately. What we've tried to do with the Stowaway program is set it
[2:18:39.500 --> 2:18:46.060]  up so anyone that can make monthly, that doesn't have room to store it, that is traveling,
[2:18:46.060 --> 2:18:50.380]  they can have it stored at safe, it's here, it can't be stolen, it can't be broken in
[2:18:50.380 --> 2:18:57.100]  on. At the same time, we've come up with some new recipes and we've adjusted the formulations
[2:18:57.100 --> 2:19:02.700]  for these foods to the point where they are literally health foods. Some folks were concerned
[2:19:02.700 --> 2:19:06.380]  about them. Steve, we're almost out of time. Steve, we're almost out of time. It's guaranteed
[2:19:06.380 --> 2:19:13.980]  you'll ship it to them. How fast, when somebody says, ship my food? 48 hours. Okay. Also,
[2:19:13.980 --> 2:19:17.620]  you've got distributor ships. Bob Dacey here in town is doing great shipping your food
[2:19:17.620 --> 2:19:21.740]  out so you're also looking for distributors that want to sell it regionally and locally.
[2:19:21.740 --> 2:19:29.340]  That's going on. Give folks the toll free number. 800-409-5633 and that's eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:19:29.340 --> 2:19:36.220]  800-409-5633. Hey, I think that's a great plan but if folks can, get the one month,
[2:19:36.220 --> 2:19:41.580]  get a year, get it stored yourselves. Shouldn't they want to physically hold it too? If they've
[2:19:41.580 --> 2:19:46.140]  got the money right now? Absolutely. Whichever way, we're just going to help people no matter
[2:19:46.140 --> 2:19:50.860]  how they need to do it. They just got to do it. Let's give that number out again. eFoodsDirect.com.

[2:21:05.100 --> 2:21:10.380]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind
[2:21:10.380 --> 2:21:15.860]  of world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely
[2:21:15.860 --> 2:21:20.420]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[2:21:20.420 --> 2:21:25.100]  Well Obama's already fudging. Yeah. Fudged since day one in this election. If you have
[2:21:25.100 --> 2:21:30.060]  a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist who is imposing the
[2:21:30.060 --> 2:21:38.060]  program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[2:21:38.060 --> 2:21:42.780]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one world government. This film documents
[2:21:42.780 --> 2:21:49.740]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama
[2:21:49.740 --> 2:21:56.700]  deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at presentplanet.tv.

[2:24:26.460 --> 2:24:53.180]  Thank you so much for joining us, John. I wanted to finish up telling you about Steve
[2:24:53.180 --> 2:24:56.940]  Scheng as he got cut short there, the J. Michael Stevens group. Whatever you do, ladies and
[2:24:56.940 --> 2:25:01.220]  gentlemen, I would get physical holdings of storable foods and this is the place to get
[2:25:01.220 --> 2:25:07.300]  it best prices. Longest continually operating company and they got one month supplies, three
[2:25:07.300 --> 2:25:11.100]  day boogie packs, they ve got year supplies, two year supplies. You ll be surprised how
[2:25:11.100 --> 2:25:16.180]  inexpensive it is, but I suggest you get a one month supply and just test it out. Or
[2:25:16.180 --> 2:25:19.820]  do that stowaway thing where they ll keep it in a warehouse for you and ship it within
[2:25:19.820 --> 2:25:30.420]  48 hours anywhere you want and they ve got layaway 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633
[2:25:30.420 --> 2:25:36.140]  or E, the letter E, foodsdirect.com. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I just can t get over
[2:25:36.140 --> 2:25:41.540]  this article that was in the New York Times yesterday and Paul Watson has pointed out
[2:25:41.540 --> 2:25:46.780]  what the article actually says. He has a story, government readies youth corps to take on
[2:25:46.780 --> 2:25:54.780]  vets, scouts trained to fight terrorists and more. Here is the New York Times from yesterday
[2:25:54.780 --> 2:26:02.860]  and when you read the first paragraph, it says 10 minutes into an errant mayhem in his
[2:26:02.860 --> 2:26:07.620]  town near the Mexican border and a gunman, a disgruntled Iraq war veteran, disgruntled
[2:26:07.620 --> 2:26:11.700]  Iraq war veteran, has already taken out two people. One slumped in his desk, the other
[2:26:11.700 --> 2:26:16.460]  covered in blood on the floor. The responding officers, 18-aged boys and girls, the youngest
[2:26:16.460 --> 2:26:23.620]  14, face tripwire, a thin cloud of poisonous gas and loud shouts, bam-bam, fired from behind
[2:26:23.620 --> 2:26:31.140]  a flimsy wall. They move quickly, pellet guns drawn and masked affixed and there, click
[2:26:31.140 --> 2:26:35.260]  on the photos that are on that New York Times page for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers. I mean,
[2:26:35.260 --> 2:26:40.180]  it s got homeland security buses they re practicing with and homeland securities funding all this
[2:26:40.180 --> 2:26:44.540]  and it s not just the Boy Scouts, it s the public schools. Look at them stacked up there
[2:26:44.540 --> 2:26:50.780]  in SWAT team formation in military uniforms. I mean, show people these insanely disgusting
[2:26:50.780 --> 2:26:53.740]  photos. Yeah, scroll through them and then of course, it shows the dead veterans they
[2:26:53.740 --> 2:27:00.220]  simulated killing. Yeah, that s it. There s 14 of them. Scroll through them at the top
[2:27:00.220 --> 2:27:04.780]  for folks right there. See that little clicker there. There the child is in the curtsle helmet.
[2:27:04.780 --> 2:27:10.540]  There they are with the little guns and the little says tactical police unit. There they
[2:27:10.540 --> 2:27:18.100]  are practicing taking over factories. There they are practicing killing terrorists. And
[2:27:18.100 --> 2:27:22.220]  then here s the dead veterans coming up, the dead vets they ve simulated killing. And you
[2:27:22.220 --> 2:27:26.340]  notice the homeland security documents as vets and goners, the number one threat. You notice
[2:27:26.340 --> 2:27:30.140]  that it s an all these other government documents. They re teaching local police. The number one
[2:27:30.140 --> 2:27:34.540]  threat is returning vets and they re going to have IEDs bombing every town soon. They
[2:27:34.540 --> 2:27:39.220]  ve got FEMA out preparing mass graves and telling local police to get ready for vets
[2:27:39.220 --> 2:27:43.380]  to attack them. I mean, they re really getting ready to go after veterans and gun owners
[2:27:43.380 --> 2:27:47.780]  because they know vets know how to fight, have a will to fight. No, it s no big deal
[2:27:47.780 --> 2:27:53.180]  once the fight s going. They re not gelded and so you re the number one target. I mean,
[2:27:53.180 --> 2:27:57.420]  you know, throughout history, you know, George Lucas, about six months after I pointed out
[2:27:57.420 --> 2:28:01.420]  that Revenge of the Sith was about government sponsored terror and government staging terror
[2:28:01.420 --> 2:28:05.100]  attacks. That s how the emperor becomes the emperor is staging terror attacks. I said
[2:28:05.100 --> 2:28:09.660]  and we wrote articles, I wrote an article in Infowars.com, you know, just from the book
[2:28:09.660 --> 2:28:12.780]  before the movie was out, I said, this is about government sponsored terror, Revenge
[2:28:12.780 --> 2:28:17.020]  of the Sith. And I said, Lucas is telling you what George Bush has done because I knew
[2:28:17.020 --> 2:28:21.340]  he changed what the original novel was going to be. Then Lucas comes out, it can and says,
[2:28:21.340 --> 2:28:28.780]  I believe the government s staging events and this is a parallel for today. Now, what
[2:28:28.780 --> 2:28:34.900]  does the emperor target when he finally takes over? He targets the police and military.
[2:28:34.900 --> 2:28:42.820]  He takes the young paramilitary forces led by the young Jedi and he sends them off to
[2:28:42.820 --> 2:28:48.780]  kill the old police and military. This isn t a movie, folks. This is what happened with
[2:28:48.780 --> 2:28:53.180]  Pinochet and Chile. This is what happened in Cuba. This is what happened in China and
[2:28:53.180 --> 2:29:00.420]  Russia and Nazi Germany and Eastern Germany. This is what happens over and over and over
[2:29:00.420 --> 2:29:05.460]  and over. And I told you, police and military, they got dossiers on all of you. They got
[2:29:05.460 --> 2:29:12.060]  merc teams ready for you. They re ready, ladies and gentlemen, to kill you. And I guess a
[2:29:12.060 --> 2:29:15.540]  lot of you re going to roll over, I guess, and just cower and let them win. As for me,
[2:29:15.540 --> 2:29:22.180]  I m not going, I keep telling you, police, you are the target. You are the target. Police,
[2:29:22.180 --> 2:29:26.540]  you re not in these documents, you know, the declassified ones. It just says returning
[2:29:26.540 --> 2:29:32.620]  vets with the number one threat. Most of the cops are the returning vets. See, you re getting
[2:29:32.620 --> 2:29:39.060]  reports about yourselves, fools, and they re training 14, 15, 16, 17-year-olds to seek
[2:29:39.060 --> 2:29:44.940]  and destroy. Read the article to murder you. It s all in writing. Are you going to take

[2:31:27.300 --> 2:31:32.420]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a
[2:31:32.420 --> 2:31:39.420]  group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that s fascism. It s not about left or right.
[2:31:39.420 --> 2:31:45.020]  It s about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he
[2:31:45.020 --> 2:31:52.620]  is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com

[2:32:59.620 --> 2:33:06.220]  win this battle.
[2:33:06.220 --> 2:33:34.320]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[2:33:34.320 --> 2:33:40.060]  You know, it feels good to go from the mainstream media calling me an insane cook for believing
[2:33:40.060 --> 2:33:45.420]  in the Bohemian Grove, Bilderberg Group and CFR to now Bilderberg Group being all of the
[2:33:45.420 --> 2:33:49.420]  news CFR, Trilateral Commission of Bohemian Grove.
[2:33:49.420 --> 2:33:52.340]  And when you read their documents, when you read books by the German Chancellor Helmut
[2:33:52.340 --> 2:33:56.980]  Schmidt or David Rockefeller's memoir four years ago about how he does want to overthrow
[2:33:56.980 --> 2:33:59.860]  the U.S., he actually says that in there, he says, yeah, I'm guilty as charged.
[2:33:59.860 --> 2:34:02.180]  I want a one world government.
[2:34:02.180 --> 2:34:06.100]  They just had a 50 top journalists come out yesterday and called for world governance
[2:34:06.100 --> 2:34:10.820]  and they said, yeah, it's got to be authoritarian to protect the democracy.
[2:34:10.820 --> 2:34:13.620]  It's an authoritarian system that's a democracy.
[2:34:13.620 --> 2:34:16.100]  That is, we let you vote on what we decide you can't.
[2:34:16.100 --> 2:34:21.160]  Like you can decide what color, you know, little helicopter cap to wear.
[2:34:21.160 --> 2:34:22.940]  You want a pink one or a green one.
[2:34:22.940 --> 2:34:26.780]  And then we decide which black schemas police take you to what FEMA can't.
[2:34:26.780 --> 2:34:30.260]  But again, you can decide what clown knows is you want a blue or red clown knows.
[2:34:30.260 --> 2:34:32.020]  That's the, that's the freedom.
[2:34:32.020 --> 2:34:35.340]  You get in the new world order as you get to decide, I guess, what color jumpsuit to
[2:34:35.340 --> 2:34:38.180]  wear in the prison.
[2:34:38.180 --> 2:34:43.100]  But the, when you read the club of Rome documents, CFR documents, everything is the carbon tax.
[2:34:43.100 --> 2:34:45.500]  Taxing the carbon cycle of the planet.
[2:34:45.500 --> 2:34:47.020]  We're carbon based life forms.
[2:34:47.020 --> 2:34:48.340]  The ocean's full of carbon.
[2:34:48.340 --> 2:34:52.780]  The trees, the trees breathe the carbon dioxide and put out oxygen for us.
[2:34:52.780 --> 2:34:58.980]  They've done studies and, you know, the earth is, is starved right now for carbon dioxide.
[2:34:58.980 --> 2:35:01.860]  It's been 14 times higher from the ice core samples.
[2:35:01.860 --> 2:35:07.260]  These grow faster, live longer, humans are healthier, higher oxygen, where oxygen starved.
[2:35:07.260 --> 2:35:08.900]  And we're on an 11 year sun cycle.
[2:35:08.900 --> 2:35:11.420]  That's what mainly controls this, but there's some other things.
[2:35:11.420 --> 2:35:12.420]  They know this.
[2:35:12.420 --> 2:35:15.500]  They brag, you know, Al Gore owns the two big companies that you'll buy the carbon credits
[2:35:15.500 --> 2:35:16.500]  from.
[2:35:16.500 --> 2:35:19.660]  George Soros says, I'm having a great controlled crisis, you're making the biggest profits
[2:35:19.660 --> 2:35:20.660]  in my life.
[2:35:20.660 --> 2:35:22.500]  This is, this is the culmination of my life work.
[2:35:22.500 --> 2:35:23.500]  I've done this.
[2:35:23.500 --> 2:35:24.500]  Ha, ha, ha.
[2:35:24.500 --> 2:35:28.620]  You know, I mean, this is funny to them.
[2:35:28.620 --> 2:35:34.460]  And Mark Morano has probably got the biggest alternative news site, which is the biggest,
[2:35:34.460 --> 2:35:39.260]  a lot of major newspapers, exposing the complete fraud and the new religion.
[2:35:39.260 --> 2:35:43.740]  Now, the elite know it's a fraud, but for the public, they say in their own documents
[2:35:43.740 --> 2:35:46.660]  we've covered here, we're going to give them a new religion of Gaia.
[2:35:46.660 --> 2:35:51.340]  Then this will, you know, this will be organized by the state and we'll have a one child policy.
[2:35:51.340 --> 2:35:53.580]  And this is what Hitler was for.
[2:35:53.580 --> 2:35:59.740]  Hitler was for controlling the population and the vegetarian and animal rights guy.
[2:35:59.740 --> 2:36:00.940]  And this is what they believe.
[2:36:00.940 --> 2:36:04.540]  These are control freaks, Prince Philip, Ted Turner, all of them.
[2:36:04.540 --> 2:36:12.380]  And so climate depot.com, the committee for constructive tomorrow, a environmentalism
[2:36:12.380 --> 2:36:13.380]  think tank.
[2:36:13.380 --> 2:36:17.420]  He worked for director of the Republicans on the U.S. Senate Committee for Environment
[2:36:17.420 --> 2:36:18.420]  and Public Works.
[2:36:18.420 --> 2:36:21.860]  Work for Senator James Inhofe, who we think is one of the better senators up there on
[2:36:21.860 --> 2:36:26.340]  these issues, you know, good thing when this propeller fell off his plane, he didn't die.
[2:36:26.340 --> 2:36:29.020]  They sure like to kill a lot of them that way.
[2:36:29.020 --> 2:36:31.300]  And he just does so much more.
[2:36:31.300 --> 2:36:36.460]  But now we've seen the Republicans flip flop after Bilderberg, 2007, and suddenly a lot
[2:36:36.460 --> 2:36:38.140]  of them have gotten behind it.
[2:36:38.140 --> 2:36:40.340]  So we're in a lot of trouble here.
[2:36:40.340 --> 2:36:43.180]  And people are, they're calling for climate change denial.
[2:36:43.180 --> 2:36:46.300]  If you say it doesn't exist, they say that's like denying the Holocaust.
[2:36:46.300 --> 2:36:48.300]  You should be arrested in Europe.
[2:36:48.300 --> 2:36:51.340]  They're trying to get us to sign on to the criminal court, surrender these laws.
[2:36:51.340 --> 2:36:58.380]  So fellow heretic, fellow thought criminal, a man out there kind of aggregating all this
[2:36:58.380 --> 2:37:02.420]  news and information in the tens of thousands of scientists saying that global warming being
[2:37:02.420 --> 2:37:04.060]  man-made's a fraud.
[2:37:04.060 --> 2:37:09.300]  Mark Murano, a serious thought criminal while we're still able to talk to him.
[2:37:09.300 --> 2:37:10.940]  They're trying to outlaw what we're about to do.
[2:37:10.940 --> 2:37:13.380]  Sir, thank you for coming on Thought Criminal.
[2:37:13.380 --> 2:37:14.380]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:37:14.380 --> 2:37:15.380]  Happy to be here.
[2:37:15.380 --> 2:37:18.100]  Yeah, you mentioned the denier and all that.
[2:37:18.100 --> 2:37:22.700]  We have a CBS news reporter, Scott Pelley, who literally has publicly said he will not
[2:37:22.700 --> 2:37:28.140]  interview any scientists skeptical of Al Gore or the United Nations view of global warming.
[2:37:28.140 --> 2:37:31.940]  Because for the same reason, if he was doing a story on the Holocaust, he would not interview
[2:37:31.940 --> 2:37:34.980]  any people who denied the Holocaust happened.
[2:37:34.980 --> 2:37:39.700]  They have returned this into sacrosanct, and you're right, the late Michael Creighton,
[2:37:39.700 --> 2:37:42.380]  the author, was one of the early ones who called us a religion.
[2:37:42.380 --> 2:37:45.540]  This is a, there's a on my site right now, climateepo.com.
[2:37:45.540 --> 2:37:50.780]  We have a seventh grade girl in school who won an essay where she says we need a climate
[2:37:50.780 --> 2:37:51.780]  exorcism.
[2:37:51.780 --> 2:37:53.460]  And she says we're being haunted.
[2:37:53.460 --> 2:37:55.860]  I mean, these are the words of religion.
[2:37:55.860 --> 2:37:59.260]  These are the words of faith-based thoughts, not science.
[2:37:59.260 --> 2:38:03.340]  And if you look at the polling data, the American people are actually growing more skeptical,
[2:38:03.340 --> 2:38:08.340]  dramatically skeptical in the last few years as the earth has failed to warm, as more scientists
[2:38:08.340 --> 2:38:12.820]  come out, as new studies just make a mockery of what Al Gore has claimed.
[2:38:12.820 --> 2:38:16.940]  But what we're finding is young people are still the most firmly and committed believers.
[2:38:16.940 --> 2:38:21.740]  And I've spoken at elementary schools, kids are worried about polar bears and flooding,
[2:38:21.740 --> 2:38:25.620]  both of which are completely manufactured scares by the global warming industry.
[2:38:25.620 --> 2:38:27.980]  Sea levels, there's no acceleration in sea level.
[2:38:27.980 --> 2:38:31.140]  And if one of the scientists said, if sea level is rising due to global warming, no
[2:38:31.140 --> 2:38:32.140]  one's told sea level.
[2:38:32.140 --> 2:38:37.260]  Well, the ice caps grew by what, 30% this year, Arctic and Antarctic.
[2:38:37.260 --> 2:38:38.260]  Oh, yeah.
[2:38:38.260 --> 2:38:44.460]  But I mean, look, when they show a polar bear on the news and say, look, he's drowning,
[2:38:44.460 --> 2:38:48.540]  they know polar bears are the greatest land swimmers on earth, they can swim hundreds
[2:38:48.540 --> 2:38:49.540]  of miles.
[2:38:49.540 --> 2:38:51.340]  I mean, this is such a scam.
[2:38:51.340 --> 2:38:54.100]  I mean, Gore just is laughing all the way to the bank.
[2:38:54.100 --> 2:38:55.100]  Go ahead.
[2:38:55.100 --> 2:38:56.100]  Yeah.
[2:38:56.100 --> 2:39:00.140]  I mean, particularly polar bears are at adorn their record highs, according to U.S. geological
[2:39:00.140 --> 2:39:01.140]  survey.
[2:39:01.140 --> 2:39:05.580]  The only way they're threatened, and they're not even threatened here, is a computer model.
[2:39:05.580 --> 2:39:08.700]  The bottom line is they've survived much warmer periods than that that's even being
[2:39:08.700 --> 2:39:09.700]  contemplated.
[2:39:09.700 --> 2:39:10.700]  That's right.
[2:39:10.700 --> 2:39:15.580]  And it's all based on computer models, which Ivy League lead expert in forecasting said
[2:39:15.580 --> 2:39:19.580]  the UN climate models violate the basic principles of forecasting.
[2:39:19.580 --> 2:39:24.420]  Something like 70 out of 84 principles that violate 70 of them.
[2:39:24.420 --> 2:39:28.860]  These are just, some people have called them Sony PlayStation video games.
[2:39:28.860 --> 2:39:29.860]  That's how they get the fear.
[2:39:29.860 --> 2:39:34.580]  They have to posit, you know, Obama's energy secretary, Stephen Chiu, is the biggest embarrassment
[2:39:34.580 --> 2:39:35.580]  on this.
[2:39:35.580 --> 2:39:39.260]  He will talk about what he thinks is going to happen in the year 2100 and act as though
[2:39:39.260 --> 2:39:41.300]  it's evidence of today.
[2:39:41.300 --> 2:39:45.340]  Top Japanese scientists just came out in, I believe, January or February and said that
[2:39:45.340 --> 2:39:48.380]  global warming is now akin to astrology.
[2:39:48.380 --> 2:39:50.060]  That's the level we've reached here.
[2:39:50.060 --> 2:39:53.940]  If you read your horoscope every day, it's written in such a way that it's vaguely worded
[2:39:53.940 --> 2:39:56.460]  that pretty much anything happens, you can say your horoscope was right.
[2:39:56.460 --> 2:39:59.780]  Well, the same way with global warming, they're now getting away from the phrase global warming.
[2:39:59.780 --> 2:40:02.380]  They want to call it global weirding in the words of Thomas Friedman.
[2:40:02.380 --> 2:40:03.380]  Exactly.
[2:40:03.380 --> 2:40:09.060]  What I want to ask you about next is the New York Times, as you know, it got leaked that
[2:40:09.060 --> 2:40:13.820]  one of these PR firms had written up the new pitch for the White House and the Democrats
[2:40:13.820 --> 2:40:20.020]  was that we're losing our atmosphere, it's deteriorating, climate change, stress when
[2:40:20.020 --> 2:40:24.860]  it's over cold that that was caused by man, stress when it's hot.
[2:40:24.860 --> 2:40:31.260]  I mean, we've got them red-handed running around, fear-mongering, and now that people
[2:40:31.260 --> 2:40:35.860]  are waking up to them, Gore's now going, we'll all be dead in five years, it's not 20 now.
[2:40:35.860 --> 2:40:37.340]  Give me the money.
[2:40:37.340 --> 2:40:41.980]  And he publicly owns the trading companies in Chicago and England that the money's going
[2:40:41.980 --> 2:40:42.980]  to go into.
[2:40:42.980 --> 2:40:43.980]  I mean, how assinized is this?
[2:40:43.980 --> 2:40:48.780]  Oh, he has poised, he's partnered and affiliated with groups that have already invested a billion
[2:40:48.780 --> 2:40:53.820]  dollars and I think 40 different companies, he has poised, he went from one or two million
[2:40:53.820 --> 2:40:59.460]  dollar net worth to over 100 million now according to Bloomberg News and now he's poised
[2:40:59.460 --> 2:41:04.540]  to be the world's first carbon billionaire, but he's not doing it through entrepreneurship,
[2:41:04.540 --> 2:41:09.500]  he's doing it through lobbying the government to pass unneeded mandates that are going to
[2:41:09.500 --> 2:41:16.380]  make people, real people suffer, but even beyond taxes, it is a moral question.
[2:41:16.380 --> 2:41:22.100]  We have poor Africans and places like Chad who have global warming inspired bans on charcoal,
[2:41:22.100 --> 2:41:25.580]  they can't cook, they can't eat their huts because they're worried about global warming
[2:41:25.580 --> 2:41:29.460]  Mark, I got to stop you again, Mark, I got to stop you and I'm going to try to shut up
[2:41:29.460 --> 2:41:30.460]  and let you talk.
[2:41:30.460 --> 2:41:33.700]  When I hear you saying all this truth, I got to say this and then I want you to go over
[2:41:33.700 --> 2:41:34.700]  it.
[2:41:34.700 --> 2:41:37.540]  I've read the actual U.N. studies, it's not even our studies, it's their studies.
[2:41:37.540 --> 2:41:42.580]  They admit that their global warming cuts of 20% could kill hundreds of millions of people
[2:41:42.580 --> 2:41:45.380]  if they cut it by 50% like they're saying billions.
[2:41:45.380 --> 2:41:49.980]  They know and they're eugenicists and so they brag that they've got to do this to
[2:41:49.980 --> 2:41:51.100]  cut the numbers.
[2:41:51.100 --> 2:41:55.860]  These are cold-blooded killers but then they say we're being paid by oil companies.
[2:41:55.860 --> 2:42:00.900]  We're stating facts, they're the ones that are now being paid by oil companies as Exxon
[2:42:00.900 --> 2:42:03.260]  Mobile's gotten on board for the global scam.
[2:42:03.260 --> 2:42:07.460]  Now I'm going to shut up, go over the numbers of what this will do to the third world.
[2:42:07.460 --> 2:42:11.340]  Well, the third world, as I said, it is a moral question.
[2:42:11.340 --> 2:42:16.220]  We have Thomas Friedman, New York Times columnist who wrote this recent book, he's been on a
[2:42:16.220 --> 2:42:17.220]  book tour.
[2:42:17.220 --> 2:42:22.820]  I believe he was paid, I want to say $175,000 to go speak in San Francisco.
[2:42:22.820 --> 2:42:27.820]  He is telling India, don't follow us, don't follow the U.S. model of economic success,
[2:42:27.820 --> 2:42:30.100]  the earth can't handle it, you don't need to do it.
[2:42:30.100 --> 2:42:34.780]  He's telling a country where 40% of its people don't have access to electricity.
[2:42:34.780 --> 2:42:38.900]  This is what they're calling the new form of colonialism, it's white, wealthy Westerners
[2:42:38.900 --> 2:42:43.580]  telling poor people of color in the third world that they can't have prosperity and
[2:42:43.580 --> 2:42:44.580]  development like we can.
[2:42:44.580 --> 2:42:48.340]  In other words, they need to remain in the nasty, brutish, short life with no running
[2:42:48.340 --> 2:42:54.220]  water, no electricity, no modern medicine, no defibrillators, no treatment, no modern
[2:42:54.220 --> 2:42:59.740]  dentistry, no clean water, no clean air, living in huts made of dung because they're living
[2:42:59.740 --> 2:43:00.740]  eco-friendly.
[2:43:00.740 --> 2:43:05.980]  I've met what I call environmental missionaries, green missionaries, wealthy white people that
[2:43:05.980 --> 2:43:11.700]  come, in this particular case, it was a young woman from Minnesota who was in Africa telling
[2:43:11.700 --> 2:43:15.620]  poor South Africans that they were living more earth-friendly and that the U.S. way of
[2:43:15.620 --> 2:43:19.140]  life was total BS, meaning prosperity and running water, electricity.
[2:43:19.140 --> 2:43:23.260]  And Mark, let me stop you, I've seen all the major studies, their own internal studies,
[2:43:23.260 --> 2:43:28.860]  the Royal Commission, 1944 to 49, they decided to have the population boom to not let the
[2:43:28.860 --> 2:43:34.420]  third world develop and they knew it would increase numbers and actually hurt the environment
[2:43:34.420 --> 2:43:38.500]  the way they're living in squalor, actually hurts the environment instead of moving to
[2:43:38.500 --> 2:43:43.140]  the industrial system and the new advanced cleaner system, so this is economic warfare,
[2:43:43.140 --> 2:43:44.140]  is it not?
[2:43:44.140 --> 2:43:49.740]  Oh, it absolutely is, I mean, the developing world is poised to have the same miracle that
[2:43:49.740 --> 2:43:55.300]  the western world had in the 20th century except for unfounded global warming fears.
[2:43:55.300 --> 2:43:59.100]  Just to give you a few more examples, white, wealthy westerners in England, a grocery market
[2:43:59.100 --> 2:44:04.060]  chain announced they were going to buy local, well, this didn't sit well with poor Kenyan
[2:44:04.060 --> 2:44:09.500]  farmers who livelihood depended on food exports to England, that's another example of this.
[2:44:09.500 --> 2:44:15.620]  You have across, again, using India, environmentalists have opposed various dams to bring in hydroelectric
[2:44:15.620 --> 2:44:19.820]  power because of environmental impacts and I've seen it down in the Amazon rainforest,
[2:44:19.820 --> 2:44:22.100]  I did a documentary in 2000.
[2:44:22.100 --> 2:44:27.460]  Wealthy celebrities fly in on carbon stewing jets, stop some development down there and
[2:44:27.460 --> 2:44:30.100]  then they fly back home to their Bel Air mansion.
[2:44:30.100 --> 2:44:35.500]  This is a new form of colonialism, it's a colonialism that keeps poor people poor.
[2:44:35.500 --> 2:44:40.700]  I interviewed Dr. Walter Williams, he's an African American economist, George Mason University.
[2:44:40.700 --> 2:44:44.300]  He said that many westerners want to see the developing world poor because it's almost
[2:44:44.300 --> 2:44:49.140]  like going to visit, treating people like there's actually a whole thing called poverty
[2:44:49.140 --> 2:44:53.420]  tourism now, where you go and you see people live and you think, oh, isn't that neat, isn't
[2:44:53.420 --> 2:44:54.420]  that great?
[2:44:54.420 --> 2:44:58.220]  And the bottom line is environmental policy is going to keep them living that way.
[2:44:58.220 --> 2:45:04.500]  That's right and these control freak communists who work for the big banks, again, they don't
[2:45:04.500 --> 2:45:09.740]  want a free market either, that's why the ultra rich always fund the poor to set up socialism
[2:45:09.740 --> 2:45:12.460]  to conduit the money and power to the elites.
[2:45:12.460 --> 2:45:17.860]  They are saying they want the same system here, they want to cut the population, Brown's
[2:45:17.860 --> 2:45:24.700]  head eco advisor says cut the population from 60 million to 30 million, population from
[2:45:24.700 --> 2:45:28.140]  25 million, so they want to bring that here.
[2:45:28.140 --> 2:45:31.540]  And then they're going to fly around on their limousine liberal helicopters while we're
[2:45:31.540 --> 2:45:32.780]  in squalor.
[2:45:32.780 --> 2:45:34.300]  These are control freaks.
[2:45:34.300 --> 2:45:35.300]  I've talked to them.
[2:45:35.300 --> 2:45:39.380]  I call it, I compared to the old Soviet Politburo where the members of the party got all the
[2:45:39.380 --> 2:45:40.380]  perks.
[2:45:40.380 --> 2:45:45.020]  You have Arnold Schwarzenegger who in his radio address just three weeks ago told Californians
[2:45:45.020 --> 2:45:48.780]  that to lower their carbon footprint, they should be air drying clothes and if you air
[2:45:48.780 --> 2:45:52.780]  dried your clothes every day for six months, you'd save, I don't know, X amount of pounds.
[2:45:52.780 --> 2:45:57.460]  The same Arnold Schwarzenegger who the LA Times a year before chastised them for commuting
[2:45:57.460 --> 2:46:01.740]  to work in a private jet, a daily commute in his private jet.
[2:46:01.740 --> 2:46:07.060]  He's now telling Californians to use, to hang their clothes on an air dryer out in the air.
[2:46:07.060 --> 2:46:11.220]  This is the level and this is Al Gore flying the private jets Leonardo DiCaprio.
[2:46:11.220 --> 2:46:16.460]  This is the, it's that two tiered system, the masses live one way and the party rulers
[2:46:16.460 --> 2:46:17.460]  live another.
[2:46:17.460 --> 2:46:18.780]  But that's okay.
[2:46:18.780 --> 2:46:23.300]  That's okay because DiCaprio and Schwarzenegger and all of them are heavily invested in the
[2:46:23.300 --> 2:46:25.020]  carbon credit companies.
[2:46:25.020 --> 2:46:27.780]  They buy those from themselves.
[2:46:27.780 --> 2:46:31.700]  And also there's a brag, I mean at one point Gore's film, he bragged that it was carbon
[2:46:31.700 --> 2:46:32.820]  neutral.
[2:46:32.820 --> 2:46:37.220]  Someone did the calculations, he only paid, I want to say the number was under $500.
[2:46:37.220 --> 2:46:38.500]  It was some absurd number.
[2:46:38.500 --> 2:46:42.540]  You can make a whole Hollywood film with all the carbon and claim your carbon neutral for
[2:46:42.540 --> 2:46:44.040]  just $500.
[2:46:44.040 --> 2:46:46.900]  I don't think other people are getting charged so low.
[2:46:46.900 --> 2:46:50.220]  But we're finding Hollywood actors buying, you know, for all the flying they do and for
[2:46:50.220 --> 2:46:51.220]  being an entertainment.
[2:46:51.220 --> 2:46:55.500]  They're buying offsets and what's happening is they're either preserving land in Africa
[2:46:55.500 --> 2:46:57.620]  or planting trees.
[2:46:57.620 --> 2:47:01.540]  Before I left the U.S. Senate, I met with the Norwegian embassy, yeah the Norwegian
[2:47:01.540 --> 2:47:05.780]  embassy and they were touting this new thing that they're essentially going to pay poor
[2:47:05.780 --> 2:47:07.700]  countries not to develop.
[2:47:07.700 --> 2:47:11.460]  And this is the ultimate form of the new colonialism I'm talking about.
[2:47:11.460 --> 2:47:13.460]  I told them I hope they failed.
[2:47:13.460 --> 2:47:15.100]  This was in a meeting in the U.S. Senate.
[2:47:15.100 --> 2:47:16.180]  They sought it out with me.
[2:47:16.180 --> 2:47:19.700]  I said all that's going to happen is your money from the U.N. and from international
[2:47:19.700 --> 2:47:22.580]  agencies are going to go to corrupt third world dictators.
[2:47:22.580 --> 2:47:23.580]  They're going to get the money.
[2:47:23.580 --> 2:47:26.820]  The people are going to suffer as their country continues not to develop as they're living
[2:47:26.820 --> 2:47:28.900]  in huts, you know, made of dung.
[2:47:28.900 --> 2:47:32.220]  These wealthy Norwegians are going to sit back and say, ah, we're saving the planet.
[2:47:32.220 --> 2:47:33.220]  Isn't this great?
[2:47:33.220 --> 2:47:36.420]  And we're helping these poor people by giving to these corrupt governments.
[2:47:36.420 --> 2:47:39.700]  That is what's wrong right now in terms of international policy.
[2:47:39.700 --> 2:47:43.500]  What we need to do, I interviewed a South African activist who said it best, if the
[2:47:43.500 --> 2:47:48.380]  Western wealthy world really doesn't want the developing world to develop, they ought
[2:47:48.380 --> 2:47:50.620]  to lead by example.
[2:47:50.620 --> 2:47:55.300]  In other words, they should level cities like Washington, Rotterdam, London, and return
[2:47:55.300 --> 2:47:59.940]  them back to swamps and jungles before they can tell people in Africa and people in South
[2:47:59.940 --> 2:48:02.500]  America and Asia not to develop their land.
[2:48:02.500 --> 2:48:04.780]  And that didn't go over too well with a lot of development actors.
[2:48:04.780 --> 2:48:08.100]  This was at a U.N. conference that the South Africans said it.
[2:48:08.100 --> 2:48:09.220]  But I think he was dead on.
[2:48:09.220 --> 2:48:13.220]  We have no business telling these countries, paying them, bribing them, whatever word you
[2:48:13.220 --> 2:48:18.340]  want to use, not to develop when it's not our kids that are dying of high inferior
[2:48:18.340 --> 2:48:20.900]  infant mortality and short life expectancy.
[2:48:20.900 --> 2:48:24.020]  I interviewed Chevy Chase on the Mall of one of these Earth days, the actor.
[2:48:24.020 --> 2:48:26.940]  He said socialism works, Cuba was the model.
[2:48:26.940 --> 2:48:29.900]  This is the mindset of the modern environmental movement.
[2:48:29.900 --> 2:48:32.460]  And sadly, it's infected many in this new administration.
[2:48:32.460 --> 2:48:38.940]  And meanwhile, Chevy Chase is worth literally $100 million or more.
[2:48:38.940 --> 2:48:43.140]  Talking to these people in government and reading their writings, the high level ones
[2:48:43.140 --> 2:48:47.620]  cold bloodly know this is a business, this is to control, this is to freeze the third
[2:48:47.620 --> 2:48:48.620]  wave.
[2:48:48.620 --> 2:48:49.620]  They're very honest.
[2:48:49.620 --> 2:48:53.180]  Ben Carden, Democrat from Maryland, told The Washington Post in April, global warming
[2:48:53.180 --> 2:49:00.860]  laws in Washington represent the greatest, the biggest potential, the greatest revenue
[2:49:00.860 --> 2:49:03.660]  generating proposal of our time was the exact quote.
[2:49:03.660 --> 2:49:06.220]  So you can imagine, they don't care about the science.
[2:49:06.220 --> 2:49:08.980]  They care about the greatest revenue generating proposal of their time.
[2:49:08.980 --> 2:49:11.300]  And remember, he controls carbon, controls life.
[2:49:11.300 --> 2:49:14.180]  It's a bureaucrats dream to control carbon dioxide.
[2:49:14.180 --> 2:49:18.700]  We had a scientist from Princeton come and testify, Will Happer, 200 peer reviewed scientific
[2:49:18.700 --> 2:49:19.700]  studies.
[2:49:19.700 --> 2:49:23.660]  He said the level of control we're contemplating when you declare what we exhale from our mouth
[2:49:23.660 --> 2:49:28.700]  of pollutants is something that George Orwell didn't even contemplate in 1984.
[2:49:28.700 --> 2:49:32.580]  We are ceding over, we have the UK, a carbon card proposal where the government's going
[2:49:32.580 --> 2:49:37.420]  to monitor individual people, their carbon allowances, they're going to monitor how
[2:49:37.420 --> 2:49:39.300]  much you drive, where you set your thermostat.
[2:49:39.300 --> 2:49:42.180]  California's already tried regulating thermostats.
[2:49:42.180 --> 2:49:48.860]  No, I had the government advisor on, and he said you will all be rationed, and you only
[2:49:48.860 --> 2:49:53.260]  have enough food to weigh a certain amount, and bureaucrats will control every facet of
[2:49:53.260 --> 2:49:54.260]  your life.
[2:49:54.260 --> 2:49:57.940]  They're now putting the satellite tracker boxes in the cars to now control how fast
[2:49:57.940 --> 2:49:58.940]  you drive.
[2:49:58.940 --> 2:50:00.300]  I mean, it's all happening.
[2:50:00.300 --> 2:50:01.300]  This is their model.
[2:50:01.300 --> 2:50:07.100]  They admit, as you know, sir, that President Bush started the bank bailout, and then Obama
[2:50:07.100 --> 2:50:10.820]  continued with the stimulus packages, and now nationalizing, you know, we're nationalizing
[2:50:10.820 --> 2:50:15.100]  banks, we're nationalizing automobiles, just to put a simple line out, never before in
[2:50:15.100 --> 2:50:20.820]  US history has more power and wealth in decision making been concentrated in the hands of
[2:50:20.820 --> 2:50:21.820]  so few.
[2:50:21.820 --> 2:50:26.740]  You know, the left will talk endlessly about, you know, oh, you know, the corrupt corporations,
[2:50:26.740 --> 2:50:27.740]  big business.
[2:50:27.740 --> 2:50:31.980]  The bottom line is at least big business has shareholders, has accountability to the public.
[2:50:31.980 --> 2:50:36.060]  Government now, we have more power and control in the smallest amount of hands that we've
[2:50:36.060 --> 2:50:42.700]  ever had in US history, and it's only going to continue, and this is inevitable result
[2:50:42.700 --> 2:50:45.260]  be dealing with the New Deal and continuing with the Great Society.
[2:50:45.260 --> 2:50:48.140]  Mark Marrano, five more minutes with you on the other side, five more minutes with Mark
[2:50:48.140 --> 2:50:50.060]  Marrano, it's climatedepot.com.
[2:50:50.060 --> 2:50:54.400]  But then above the government is a very small group of private corporations that operate
[2:50:54.400 --> 2:50:58.860]  like Spectre, and that's the New World Order, that's the Bilderberg group, okay, but I agree
[2:50:58.860 --> 2:50:59.860]  with him.
[2:50:59.860 --> 2:51:00.860]  We'll be right back.
[2:51:00.860 --> 2:51:07.380]  Today, we cannot afford to ignore the current state of our country, the economy, job layoffs,
[2:51:07.380 --> 2:51:13.300]  mass foreclosures, and now we are all at risk of being exposed to this new flu pandemic.
[2:51:13.300 --> 2:51:17.340]  The Center for Disease Control has declared a public health emergency across the United
[2:51:17.340 --> 2:51:18.340]  States.

[2:52:02.660 --> 2:52:06.420]  I'm sitting on a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt
[2:52:06.420 --> 2:52:08.020]  and struggling to make payments.
[2:52:08.020 --> 2:52:12.500]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number, due to a declining economy and credit
[2:52:12.500 --> 2:52:13.500]  crisis.

[2:52:18.500 --> 2:52:20.100]  by calling the bailout group.
[2:52:20.100 --> 2:52:24.940]  This program has already settled over $100 million of debt and are saving individual
[2:52:24.940 --> 2:52:27.060]  consumers thousands of dollars.
[2:52:27.060 --> 2:52:31.060]  Folks, if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments,
[2:52:31.060 --> 2:52:33.500]  the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.

[2:52:43.700 --> 2:52:45.820]  the phone with one simple call.

[2:52:50.820 --> 2:52:52.700]  you thousands of dollars today.
[2:52:52.700 --> 2:53:01.540]  That number again is 1-800-324-6554-80324-6554, the bailout group.

[2:53:56.420 --> 2:54:09.340]  That's 888-654-3447.
[2:54:09.340 --> 2:54:16.140]  You know I get rabid on this subject to start spewing facts and they're facts and they just
[2:54:16.140 --> 2:54:17.140]  say no.
[2:54:17.140 --> 2:54:22.420]  In fact Al Gore a few weeks ago and I wanted to ask Mark Morano of ClimateDepot.com about
[2:54:22.420 --> 2:54:29.500]  this former Senate advisor in aid and researcher, one of the preeminent people, kind of a clearing
[2:54:29.500 --> 2:54:32.020]  house to expose all this.
[2:54:32.020 --> 2:54:34.620]  And they said what about all these thousands of scientists, I mean there are thousands
[2:54:34.620 --> 2:54:35.620]  and thousands.
[2:54:35.620 --> 2:54:38.500]  I've seen letters of 10,000, 20,000 they sign.
[2:54:38.500 --> 2:54:40.060]  The vast majority saying it's all a fraud.
[2:54:40.060 --> 2:54:44.980]  The top climatologists, the top experts on the Arctic, they're everywhere.
[2:54:44.980 --> 2:54:47.460]  They're saying look it's a fraud.
[2:54:47.460 --> 2:54:51.860]  The people that look at the sun, you know, I mean all of it.
[2:54:51.860 --> 2:54:54.860]  And Al Gore just said well there's people that think you know there's flying saucers
[2:54:54.860 --> 2:54:58.540]  and we went to them and we didn't go to the moon.
[2:54:58.540 --> 2:54:59.780]  And that's what they do.
[2:54:59.780 --> 2:55:03.280]  They just say, first they said everyone agrees and they said oh everybody who's credible
[2:55:03.280 --> 2:55:11.060]  agrees and then well everybody who's sane believes and meanwhile it's just an unbelievable
[2:55:11.060 --> 2:55:14.580]  fraud and then they brought up to him, well what about how Ken Lay of Enron came up with
[2:55:14.580 --> 2:55:16.580]  this idea for carbon credits.
[2:55:16.580 --> 2:55:19.060]  And then Al Gore says I don't know anything about that and he goes well your partner was
[2:55:19.060 --> 2:55:20.060]  part of it.
[2:55:20.060 --> 2:55:21.060]  And he goes no, no he's not.
[2:55:21.060 --> 2:55:24.340]  Then we went and looked it up, Al Gore knows that and is involved.
[2:55:24.340 --> 2:55:26.300]  I mean these people are just despicable.
[2:55:26.300 --> 2:55:27.380]  How do we beat them?
[2:55:27.380 --> 2:55:28.820]  How do we stop these bastards?
[2:55:28.820 --> 2:55:32.180]  They're in the Senate right now, they're trying to ram it through, they're saying on the news
[2:55:32.180 --> 2:55:37.300]  we are dead unless we have an international body that taxes and regulates every facet
[2:55:37.300 --> 2:55:41.060]  of our lives and if we don't have weekly bureaucrats inspecting our homes.
[2:55:41.060 --> 2:55:46.300]  Real quick, just so people don't think I'm being conspiratorial here or, you know, Jacques
[2:55:46.300 --> 2:55:50.820]  Chirac, the French president's own words were the UN Global Warming Treaty Kyoto was the
[2:55:50.820 --> 2:55:53.260]  first step to authentic global governance.
[2:55:53.260 --> 2:55:55.140]  These are their own words.
[2:55:55.140 --> 2:55:56.140]  E.U.
[2:55:56.140 --> 2:56:01.580]  Admire, E.U. official came out and said that the Kyoto represented leveling the playing
[2:56:01.580 --> 2:56:05.060]  field for the developed for the world, meaning the take from the rich.
[2:56:05.060 --> 2:56:10.100]  I was at UN conferences where they're proposing a global carbon tax on countries and guess
[2:56:10.100 --> 2:56:15.100]  what, the wealthy nations get hit the hardest and guess what, the UN decided to administer
[2:56:15.100 --> 2:56:16.100]  the funds.
[2:56:16.100 --> 2:56:20.020]  These are their own words that they're saying and they're being very open about their goals
[2:56:20.020 --> 2:56:21.740]  when they do this.
[2:56:21.740 --> 2:56:24.580]  You mentioned Al Gore and the astronaut, I can't let this go by.
[2:56:24.580 --> 2:56:28.700]  He told the House hearing two weeks ago that he compared global warming skeptics to people
[2:56:28.700 --> 2:56:31.060]  who think the moon landing was faked.
[2:56:31.060 --> 2:56:35.380]  Well the bottom line is that talking point is now moot as one of the moon landers himself,
[2:56:35.380 --> 2:56:41.220]  astronaut Jack Smith and a geologist came out and declared himself a skeptic late last
[2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:42.220]  year.
[2:56:42.220 --> 2:56:44.940]  So Gore doesn't even have it updated to his talking point.
[2:56:44.940 --> 2:56:46.220]  You asked about how to defeat this.
[2:56:46.220 --> 2:56:50.460]  The bottom line is the Republicans, surprise, surprise, are actually doing a pretty good
[2:56:50.460 --> 2:56:51.660]  job in the House right now.
[2:56:51.660 --> 2:56:52.660]  They're unified.
[2:56:52.660 --> 2:56:57.460]  A couple Republicans have introduced a carbon tax as a sort of diversion from what I gathered
[2:56:57.460 --> 2:57:00.780]  to, you know, because all the liberals, that would be their dream, but it's not politically
[2:57:00.780 --> 2:57:01.780]  doable.
[2:57:01.780 --> 2:57:05.700]  But the bottom line, Republicans are doing pretty well, led by Congressman Joe Barton.
[2:57:05.700 --> 2:57:07.500]  The Democrats are doing very well.
[2:57:07.500 --> 2:57:10.700]  One of them, a Democrat agricultural chairman, said he's off the train.
[2:57:10.700 --> 2:57:12.860]  He will not support a climate bill.
[2:57:12.860 --> 2:57:17.020]  Waxman, the committee in charge of this in the House, Congressman Waxman has basically
[2:57:17.020 --> 2:57:18.500]  said no votes, no problem.
[2:57:18.500 --> 2:57:21.540]  And he's talking about bypassing the committee if he doesn't have the votes.
[2:57:21.540 --> 2:57:23.060]  How do we stop cities?
[2:57:23.060 --> 2:57:25.660]  How do we stop cities and states doing it?
[2:57:25.660 --> 2:57:30.860]  Well the bottom line is the American people are absolutely indicated every way possible
[2:57:30.860 --> 2:57:35.220]  that not only don't they care about this issue, they couldn't give a damn about this issue.
[2:57:35.220 --> 2:57:39.940]  It ranks dead last among all issues, among environmental issues, it ranks dead last.
[2:57:39.940 --> 2:57:41.220]  Eventually the American people have to wake up.
[2:57:41.220 --> 2:57:44.540]  I think there's been such complacency, they have no idea what's going on.
[2:57:44.540 --> 2:57:49.020]  The first thing we need to do is demand accountability among Republicans to stop paying lip service.
[2:57:49.020 --> 2:57:53.220]  George Bush enjoyed paying lip service to global warming fears, and we need to stop
[2:57:53.220 --> 2:57:54.220]  that first.
[2:57:54.220 --> 2:57:57.220]  There's no reason to concede an inch on the science on this.
[2:57:57.220 --> 2:57:58.980]  It's collapsing underneath them.
[2:57:58.980 --> 2:58:02.220]  It's a laughing stock just in the last few days.
[2:58:02.220 --> 2:58:04.740]  Arctic information came out, Danish Meteorological Institute.
[2:58:04.740 --> 2:58:10.700]  The Arctic has stayed the same since the 1950s, it's probably cooled since 1940s.
[2:58:10.700 --> 2:58:15.900]  We just came out, the Greenland melt scenarios touted by Al Gore and NASA's James Hansen,
[2:58:15.900 --> 2:58:16.900]  not even doable.
[2:58:16.900 --> 2:58:22.020]  Hey, Mark Morano, Mark, we've got a last thing and we need to demand it and once people
[2:58:22.020 --> 2:58:24.940]  realize what it's going to cost, I think the American people will wake up.
[2:58:24.940 --> 2:58:28.140]  Mark, we've got a one minute break and I have another guest in three minutes anyways.
[2:58:28.140 --> 2:58:31.580]  When we come back and just do two more minutes, you can finish up with solutions and tell
[2:58:31.580 --> 2:58:33.060]  folks about the website.
[2:58:33.060 --> 2:58:34.700]  Can you come back and finish up in one minute?
[2:58:34.700 --> 2:58:36.140]  Sure, I can do that.
[2:58:36.140 --> 2:58:37.140]  Okay, fantastic.
[2:58:37.140 --> 2:58:41.140]  Mark Morano, climatedepot.com, our site's infowars.com.

[2:58:51.700 --> 2:58:56.020]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer
[2:58:56.020 --> 2:59:00.340]  provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[2:59:00.340 --> 2:59:05.540]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[2:59:05.540 --> 2:59:10.820]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[3:01:17.180 --> 3:01:21.300]  Environmental left always have to have an eco-scare, whether it's overpopulation, whether
[3:01:21.300 --> 3:01:27.140]  it's disappearing rainforests, the Amazon, whether it's global cooling in the 70s, and
[3:01:27.140 --> 3:01:31.020]  actually the rainforests, if you recall, Sting's Rainforest Foundation, all the Hollywood
[3:01:31.020 --> 3:01:34.500]  celebrities, that was the big issue, dessert in the 80s and 90s.
[3:01:34.500 --> 3:01:39.500]  The New York Times was forced to admit in January of this year that rainforests are
[3:01:39.500 --> 3:01:43.620]  for every acre cut, 50 are growing back, people are leaving the jungles, they're returning
[3:01:43.620 --> 3:01:44.620]  to nature.
[3:01:44.620 --> 3:01:47.900]  There was a scientist saying maybe it wasn't such an urgent cause after all to save the
[3:01:47.900 --> 3:01:48.900]  rainforest.
[3:01:48.900 --> 3:01:53.420]  In other words, they're the most intact forest, least threatened on the planet, and now that
[3:01:53.420 --> 3:01:56.900]  whole issue's died, but no one's out there saying, sorry, you don't see Sting out there
[3:01:56.900 --> 3:01:57.900]  apologizing.
[3:01:57.900 --> 3:02:00.780]  I don't even think he does his concerts anymore, if he does, he doesn't get any attention
[3:02:00.780 --> 3:02:01.780]  with them.
[3:02:01.780 --> 3:02:02.780]  They've moved on to global warming.
[3:02:02.780 --> 3:02:06.700]  So I think what's going to happen is global warming will die when the next eco-scare comes
[3:02:06.700 --> 3:02:07.700]  along.
[3:02:07.700 --> 3:02:08.700]  And what is that?
[3:02:08.700 --> 3:02:12.500]  I don't know yet, there's some people worried about whether we have enough oxygen, there's
[3:02:12.500 --> 3:02:16.340]  people that are going to go after it, whether it's species, I don't know, who knows.
[3:02:16.340 --> 3:02:19.900]  They're always very creative and clever, you don't know what the next scare is going to
[3:02:19.900 --> 3:02:20.900]  be.
[3:02:20.900 --> 3:02:25.300]  That's not to say, I want to be clear here, there's a lot of scientists that are concerned
[3:02:25.300 --> 3:02:30.100]  about this, but I think what's happened is a lot of scientists who should know better
[3:02:30.100 --> 3:02:36.300]  are basically jumped on a bandwagon that has tens of billions of dollars involved in it.
[3:02:36.300 --> 3:02:40.300]  So say you study frogs, you do a study on frogs, no one really pays attention.
[3:02:40.300 --> 3:02:44.260]  You do a study on how global warming may impact frogs in the year 2040, suddenly you're getting
[3:02:44.260 --> 3:02:47.340]  funding, your university is getting press releases, you're getting radio calls.
[3:02:47.340 --> 3:02:51.620]  So it's not that the scientist is necessarily doing anything wrong, he's just going along
[3:02:51.620 --> 3:02:57.300]  with the scientific tenor of the day and it's happened to be global warming because that's
[3:02:57.300 --> 3:02:59.180]  where all the money and attention is.
[3:02:59.180 --> 3:03:03.220]  So I'm not here doing a blanket denunciation, not all scientists are Al Gore or even the
[3:03:03.220 --> 3:03:04.220]  United Nations.
[3:03:04.220 --> 3:03:08.260]  Many of them are concerned and they move forward, but the bottom line is even if we
[3:03:08.260 --> 3:03:11.780]  face the climate crisis, nothing Washington or the U.N. has proposed would have anything
[3:03:11.780 --> 3:03:12.780]  to do with it.
[3:03:12.780 --> 3:03:15.980]  Well that was my final point, is I looked at the studies, if only the U.S. and Western
[3:03:15.980 --> 3:03:23.300]  Europe and Japan made big cuts, all the production would automatically move to third world nations
[3:03:23.300 --> 3:03:25.020]  and it would actually increase greenhouse gases.
[3:03:25.020 --> 3:03:27.020]  Yeah, environmentalists are worried it's going to increase emissions.
[3:03:27.020 --> 3:03:31.660]  I got to jump in now, but thank you very much, enjoyed it and our website's climatedepot.com.
[3:03:31.660 --> 3:03:34.820]  Thank you so much for coming on with this perfect timing there because we now have Bob
[3:03:34.820 --> 3:03:35.820]  Chapman.
[3:03:35.820 --> 3:03:41.220]  I want to get your take of the International Forecaster.com, their once a week visit with
[3:03:41.220 --> 3:03:47.780]  us on what's happening with the economy this week, thousands of dealerships, they're saying
[3:03:47.780 --> 3:03:52.300]  a thousand plus Chrysler, a 1300, I've got the article, I think it's 1300, you can correct
[3:03:52.300 --> 3:03:58.700]  me if I'm wrong, General Motors are being told they're being shut down and it's being
[3:03:58.700 --> 3:04:02.820]  handed over to Fiat, Bilderberg owned, gold is exploding.
[3:04:02.820 --> 3:04:06.700]  Bob, what's coming up in this interview?
[3:04:06.700 --> 3:04:15.700]  Well, I think that Chrysler is talking about 38,000 jobs being lost and I don't think that
[3:04:15.700 --> 3:04:22.900]  figure's been bantied around yet and it's just devastating and of course this is a reflection
[3:04:22.900 --> 3:04:31.940]  of the policies that have been in place since about 1980 of moving all sorts of manufacturing
[3:04:31.940 --> 3:04:37.900]  and industry out of the United States under the guise of free trade globalization, offshoring
[3:04:37.900 --> 3:04:38.900]  and outsourcing.
[3:04:38.900 --> 3:04:42.380]  Stay there, got a break, we'll come back, we'll get into that, yeah, this is the glories
[3:04:42.380 --> 3:04:47.220]  of globalization, this is the glories of NAFTA and GATT, the glories of the New World Order
[3:04:47.220 --> 3:04:51.820]  and there George Soros and others are saying it is glorious for them but not for you, not
[3:04:51.820 --> 3:04:52.820]  for me.

[3:06:02.100 --> 3:06:07.580]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:06:07.580 --> 3:06:13.860]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:06:13.860 --> 3:06:15.500]  just as well funded.
[3:06:15.500 --> 3:06:20.660]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:06:20.660 --> 3:06:22.140]  of the American people.
[3:06:22.140 --> 3:06:26.540]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:06:26.540 --> 3:06:31.660]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:06:31.660 --> 3:06:38.180]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:06:38.180 --> 3:06:41.740]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[3:06:41.740 --> 3:06:48.660]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:07:03.060 --> 3:07:05.100]  Spring is here, growing season.
[3:07:05.100 --> 3:07:09.140]  The economy is not getting any better, in fact it's getting worse.
[3:07:09.140 --> 3:07:14.260]  Think about it, at this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?

[2:51:38.700 --> 3:08:24.540]  England, having the police come over and say, you can't videotape any of these downtown buildings,
[3:08:24.540 --> 3:08:28.220]  it's about 100 yards away from the U.S. Embassy, we're going to charge you with terrorism.
[3:08:28.220 --> 3:08:31.180]  They promise when they pass that law it wouldn't be misused.
[3:08:31.180 --> 3:08:35.540]  They arrested hundreds of journalists, mainline journalists as well, in England, so you can't
[3:08:35.540 --> 3:08:37.380]  videotape anything now.
[3:08:37.380 --> 3:08:39.460]  So they put cameras on you, but you can't put cameras on them.
[3:08:39.460 --> 3:08:43.780]  We're going back to Bob Chapman, here in just a moment, with his economic report on what's
[3:08:43.780 --> 3:08:47.700]  happening, and don't forget I'll be back this Sunday live, four to six p.m. central standard
[3:08:47.700 --> 3:08:48.700]  time here.
[3:08:48.700 --> 3:08:52.140]  If you don't have an am or eth of in your area, you can always listen at infowars.com.
[3:08:52.140 --> 3:08:57.500]  Akola blue dot com, atmospheric water generator for the home, pays for itself in one year
[3:08:57.500 --> 3:09:01.180]  if you buy your water from the store, pure clean water without the fluoride and limited
[3:09:01.180 --> 3:09:04.640]  water from the humidity in the air, know exactly what you're drinking, machine produces up
[3:09:04.640 --> 3:09:08.620]  to 28 liters of water a day, that's 7.5 gallons.
[3:09:08.620 --> 3:09:13.340]  The generated water is passed through seven filters, including reverse osmosis and carbon,
[3:09:13.340 --> 3:09:18.900]  simple to use, no chemicals, pollutants or toxins, neutral pH, your own source of clean
[3:09:18.900 --> 3:09:19.900]  water from the air.
[3:09:19.900 --> 3:09:22.460]  Again, it goes through seven great filtration systems.
[3:09:22.460 --> 3:09:23.460]  This is wonderful.
[3:09:23.460 --> 3:09:24.860]  I have one here in the office.
[3:09:24.860 --> 3:09:26.020]  I have one at my house.
[3:09:26.020 --> 3:09:27.900]  We absolutely love it.
[3:09:27.900 --> 3:09:38.660]  Akola blue dot com, E-C-O-L-O blue dot com, 1-800-691-6043, that number 800-691-6043, Akola blue dot
[3:09:38.660 --> 3:09:39.660]  com.
[3:09:39.660 --> 3:09:40.660]  Okay, going back to Bob Chapman.
[3:09:40.660 --> 3:09:45.260]  Bob, for Stations just joined us, you were getting into what it means to have Chrysler
[3:09:45.260 --> 3:09:51.100]  and GM going under, going into receivership, what's happening with Goal, what's happening
[3:09:51.100 --> 3:09:55.700]  with Stock Market, the Bilderberg Group meeting, Jim Tucker's now got info, I'm going to tell
[3:09:55.700 --> 3:09:59.140]  you the latest info on that, with it just broken hour ago here on air an hour and a
[3:09:59.140 --> 3:10:03.940]  half ago, get your take on that, but continue with the real economy and what's happening
[3:10:03.940 --> 3:10:04.940]  there.
[3:10:04.940 --> 3:10:14.820]  Well, I think, as I said before, that the problems at Chrysler, Ford, General Motors,
[3:10:14.820 --> 3:10:20.380]  and all of the manufacturers in the United States are a product of a planned obsolescence
[3:10:20.380 --> 3:10:25.100]  of American manufacturing, which began almost 30 years ago.
[3:10:25.100 --> 3:10:32.700]  I wrote about it back in the early 80s because I had followed what these people were up to,
[3:10:32.700 --> 3:10:38.900]  in fact, the first article I wrote was in 1967 on this, and of course, I was a madman,
[3:10:38.900 --> 3:10:47.700]  and now I'm not a madman, I'm a mad old man, but anyway, this is part of the plan to deindustrialize
[3:10:47.700 --> 3:10:56.420]  the United States, and it is the very cornerstone of bringing the American economy financially
[3:10:56.420 --> 3:11:04.420]  and economically to its knees so that these people can create and implement world government,
[3:11:04.420 --> 3:11:10.060]  and this is part of the plan, and so it's not surprising to me, it's devastating for
[3:11:10.060 --> 3:11:15.700]  America, it's devastating for our fellow citizens who are going to be losing their jobs, and
[3:11:15.700 --> 3:11:22.140]  as we know, the 5 million jobs that were lost in the last eight years via this method, most
[3:11:22.140 --> 3:11:28.540]  of those fellows and ladies who are making some $30 an hour are now lucky if they can
[3:11:28.540 --> 3:11:35.140]  make 15 and most of them are making less than that, and that obviously is going to continue,
[3:11:35.140 --> 3:11:42.100]  and at the same time, we have pulling at the bottom of the economy probably about 30 million
[3:11:42.100 --> 3:11:49.780]  illegal aliens of which probably 15 or 12 million work, and because of their status,
[3:11:49.780 --> 3:11:56.060]  they receive low wages, and they pull wages down at the lower level, and at the same time,
[3:11:56.060 --> 3:12:02.820]  they take jobs away from Americans, American citizens, so we have this worst of all world
[3:12:02.820 --> 3:12:05.220]  circuit fence that we're going through here.
[3:12:05.220 --> 3:12:14.620]  Now one of the highlights I saw today is that there is a bi-American mode going on, and
[3:12:14.620 --> 3:12:19.620]  I just got a piece out of the Globe and Mail from Toronto regarding that, which is in the
[3:12:19.620 --> 3:12:29.620]  next issue, and they are now in government contracts in the United States demanding American
[3:12:29.620 --> 3:12:37.340]  parts be used, and in Canada, they're retaliating by municipalities and other governmental units
[3:12:37.340 --> 3:12:44.900]  not using made in America implements, equipment, whatever you want to call it, and the point
[3:12:44.900 --> 3:12:50.060]  I'm getting at here is this is the beginning, and it's not a trade war, it's not going to
[3:12:50.060 --> 3:12:58.060]  be a trade war, what it's going to be is an inward facing of each country trying to save
[3:12:58.060 --> 3:13:04.460]  their own economies, and they're all going to tit for tat, they're all going to erect
[3:13:04.460 --> 3:13:09.260]  their little barriers, the Chinese and the Russians have already started doing it some
[3:13:09.260 --> 3:13:15.060]  time ago, and we're going to see a lot more of it, and all I can tell you is that the
[3:13:15.060 --> 3:13:23.900]  best thing that Congress can do is pass tariffs on goods and services, because that will mean
[3:13:23.900 --> 3:13:29.340]  that all of these cheap things that are bought, or I should say less expensive things that
[3:13:29.340 --> 3:13:34.420]  are bought from overseas will have a tariff on them, and they'll have to compete, they
[3:13:34.420 --> 3:13:39.940]  can't compete on their slave labor anymore, and that's good because then Americans can
[3:13:39.940 --> 3:13:45.620]  make those products in America, and then those companies that left our shores can return
[3:13:45.620 --> 3:13:51.420]  because it won't be worthwhile for them to stay outside the country anymore, and unfortunately,
[3:13:51.420 --> 3:13:56.980]  the only commentator and letter writer that I know of who advocates this, and I wish more
[3:13:56.980 --> 3:14:03.220]  would, but anyway, this is where all this came from, this is where it's going, and quite
[3:14:03.220 --> 3:14:08.460]  frankly, if we continue to allow them to do what they're doing, I don't know who's going
[3:14:08.460 --> 3:14:10.900]  to be working at what anymore.
[3:14:10.900 --> 3:14:17.540]  Well, Bob Chapman, let me comment on the two points that you just made.
[3:14:17.540 --> 3:14:23.660]  A, the globalist or corporate raiders, their banker takeover masters, they like to destroy
[3:14:23.660 --> 3:14:30.180]  economies so they can sit up top of their fiat currency and liquidity that they make
[3:14:30.180 --> 3:14:34.380]  out of nothing and back up with the military to then buy everything up as it implodes,
[3:14:34.380 --> 3:14:38.060]  so that's why George Soros, as you know, is bragging this is the best time of his life,
[3:14:38.060 --> 3:14:43.100]  he helped engineer it, oh, it's so wonderful, ha, ha, ha, and he funded Obama, you know,
[3:14:43.100 --> 3:14:48.860]  this is a big joke to them, and then you expand into the tariffs and trade, the first countries
[3:14:48.860 --> 3:14:53.260]  to put their tariffs up are usually the ones that get saved, will be the last to do it,
[3:14:53.260 --> 3:14:57.100]  and then by them will be so shot, the media will say the tariffs did it, you know, that's
[3:14:57.100 --> 3:15:02.420]  how they always do it, and this is a lesson in globalism, this was meant to make us dependent
[3:15:02.420 --> 3:15:05.900]  on the international, this was meant to make all nations dependent on each other, instead
[3:15:05.900 --> 3:15:11.820]  of national sovereignty or the bankers above it, and we're now here, and NAFTA and GATT
[3:15:11.820 --> 3:15:15.980]  have destroyed us, and the World Health Organization, World Trade Organization, all these bureaucracies
[3:15:15.980 --> 3:15:20.020]  are taking over, the Bilderberg Group agendas have set up this new World Health Organization
[3:15:20.020 --> 3:15:24.740]  with total power over all our health departments, everything we talked about is now happening,
[3:15:24.740 --> 3:15:29.180]  and the very bankers that engineered it all are now the saviors, up there posing as our
[3:15:29.180 --> 3:15:35.080]  saviors, and the New York Times reports, like it's a good idea, that government-readies
[3:15:35.080 --> 3:15:41.340]  youth corps to take on vets, and the first line of the New York Times says they're preparing
[3:15:41.340 --> 3:15:47.780]  paramilitary squads of high schoolers, middle schoolers, either scouts to take on gun owners
[3:15:47.780 --> 3:15:52.820]  and veterans, I mean, Bob, as much as we know about this, do you ever still pinch yourself
[3:15:52.820 --> 3:15:55.380]  like we're in the Twilight Zone?
[3:15:55.380 --> 3:15:58.900]  You know, it's hard to believe it's come to this, we always were afraid that it would
[3:15:58.900 --> 3:16:05.660]  evolve this way, and when I saw those children, of course they're young adults, with mock
[3:16:05.660 --> 3:16:12.700]  weapons being trained to combat terrorists, and I have it in the next issue as you have,
[3:16:12.700 --> 3:16:20.660]  and I was shocked, I mean, nothing is sacred as sacrosanct, I think a lot of parents are
[3:16:20.660 --> 3:16:27.100]  going to pull their children out of a Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and Cub Scouts because
[3:16:27.100 --> 3:16:28.100]  of this.
[3:16:28.100 --> 3:16:35.580]  I don't think they want them under the age of something that's like the Hitler-Yunga,
[3:16:35.580 --> 3:16:38.020]  and that's really what this amounts to.
[3:16:38.020 --> 3:16:43.420]  Well, I mean, you worked against the Russians in Berlin, for all the old guys that were
[3:16:43.420 --> 3:16:47.140]  Army officers or in the military, even people that are, you know, 40, 50 who were a member
[3:16:47.140 --> 3:16:52.260]  when we were taught this was tyranny, the American people, even when I was a kid, were
[3:16:52.260 --> 3:16:57.220]  taught this was tyranny, and I'm only 35, I mean, this is tyranny.
[3:16:57.220 --> 3:17:01.580]  One of these things alone would be tyranny, as a London Guardian reporter said earlier,
[3:17:01.580 --> 3:17:06.380]  but there's hundreds of them, I mean, they are going down every check-off list of hardcore
[3:17:06.380 --> 3:17:12.180]  tyranny and double checking, I mean, they are just pulling out all the stops here because
[3:17:12.180 --> 3:17:16.700]  they know the people are going to resist this bank or takeover, and so they've been building
[3:17:16.700 --> 3:17:19.860]  up forever against this.
[3:17:19.860 --> 3:17:22.060]  It doesn't look like it's confirmed, Bob.
[3:17:22.060 --> 3:17:23.140]  They're going for broke.
[3:17:23.140 --> 3:17:24.380]  This is going to get hot.
[3:17:24.380 --> 3:17:25.380]  They're going all the way.
[3:17:25.380 --> 3:17:26.380]  They're not stopping.
[3:17:26.380 --> 3:17:31.860]  I think Alex you're right, and incidentally, I'd like to interject that George Soros was
[3:17:31.860 --> 3:17:38.580]  convicted of market rigging in France in appeal to the highest court and lost, so he's a convicted
[3:17:38.580 --> 3:17:45.860]  felon who paid a fine, and then he was just recently nabbed in Hungary for the same thing,
[3:17:45.860 --> 3:17:48.860]  and he had to pay a large fine there, so the guy is a crook.
[3:17:48.860 --> 3:17:54.380]  So all of you people who didn't know George Soros is a crook.
[3:17:54.380 --> 3:17:55.900]  But why is he so arrogant?
[3:17:55.900 --> 3:17:59.860]  I mean, he's a smart criminal who funds the Big Liberal website to attack me every day
[3:17:59.860 --> 3:18:05.140]  now, and he literally funded Obama, but why would he tell a press conference?
[3:18:05.140 --> 3:18:08.380]  I mean, it was literally in scores of papers a month ago, as you know, Bob.
[3:18:08.380 --> 3:18:09.860]  I'm having the best time of my life.
[3:18:09.860 --> 3:18:11.900]  This is the culmination of my life.
[3:18:11.900 --> 3:18:17.180]  I've basically engineered this, which is him bragging he's only one part of a gaggle
[3:18:17.180 --> 3:18:18.420]  that did that.
[3:18:18.420 --> 3:18:21.380]  Why would the little bastard brag that he's causing all this pain?
[3:18:21.380 --> 3:18:22.380]  I guess it's just...
[3:18:22.380 --> 3:18:27.780]  Well, he's bragging for his whole group because he's an integral part of it, and as you know,
[3:18:27.780 --> 3:18:34.500]  he got his start by deceiving Jewish people in the country in which he was born while
[3:18:34.500 --> 3:18:39.860]  working for the Gestapo so that they could confiscate the goods of Jews.
[3:18:39.860 --> 3:18:42.040]  He being Jewish himself.
[3:18:42.040 --> 3:18:43.420]  Did you know that?
[3:18:43.420 --> 3:18:47.060]  I knew that he was Jewish and that he was connected to some of the thuggery.
[3:18:47.060 --> 3:18:48.060]  Yes.
[3:18:48.060 --> 3:18:49.060]  It's kind of like Madoff.
[3:18:49.060 --> 3:18:50.060]  He is a bad, bad person.
[3:18:50.060 --> 3:18:51.060]  But anyway, the arrogance...
[3:18:51.060 --> 3:18:52.060]  Well, no, no, hold on.
[3:18:52.060 --> 3:18:54.060]  Tell us more about that because, hold on, hold on.
[3:18:54.060 --> 3:18:57.580]  I mean, I vaguely knew about that, but refresh me fully about him.
[3:18:57.580 --> 3:19:02.020]  I mean, I knew Madden Albright's dad was a commissariat who killed over a million.
[3:19:02.020 --> 3:19:06.420]  That's mainline information and all the stolen arts in her house of people they robbed, including
[3:19:06.420 --> 3:19:08.060]  Jews, but also other people.
[3:19:08.060 --> 3:19:14.580]  I know that most people, Jean-Charlie Keshvili's dad was the top Nazi in Poland helping them.
[3:19:14.580 --> 3:19:19.660]  I mean, I know, same thing with all of these people, same thing with Zbigniew Brzezinski,
[3:19:19.660 --> 3:19:24.220]  but you're saying that Soros, tell us about that.
[3:19:24.220 --> 3:19:32.820]  Well, Soros, very simply was probably 12, 14 years old at the time, and the Germans
[3:19:32.820 --> 3:19:39.620]  had invaded, and the Germans were rounding up Jews to send them to internment camps,
[3:19:39.620 --> 3:19:44.780]  and slave labor camps, and extermination camps, or whatever.
[3:19:44.780 --> 3:19:50.900]  And his job, because he was taken on with the Gestapo, I assume he told them that he
[3:19:50.900 --> 3:19:51.900]  wasn't Jewish.
[3:19:51.900 --> 3:19:52.900]  Stay there.
[3:19:52.900 --> 3:19:53.900]  Let's hear about it when we get back.
[3:19:53.900 --> 3:19:54.900]  Got a break, Bob?
[3:19:54.900 --> 3:19:59.300]  More straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen with Bob Chapman, the International Forecaster.com.
[3:19:59.300 --> 3:20:00.300]  Check it out today.
[3:20:00.300 --> 3:20:28.700]  That's the person who wanted our TV.
[3:20:28.700 --> 3:20:54.700]  Thank you so much for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[3:20:54.700 --> 3:21:02.380]  We'll call 800-675-0323, that's 800-675-0323, in order today.
[3:21:02.380 --> 3:21:08.460]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:21:08.460 --> 3:21:12.860]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all
[3:21:12.860 --> 3:21:14.300]  of us would like to see.
[3:21:14.300 --> 3:21:19.460]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:21:19.460 --> 3:21:20.460]  of the American people.
[3:21:20.460 --> 3:21:25.220]  Well, Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:21:25.220 --> 3:21:30.340]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:21:30.340 --> 3:21:38.460]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:21:38.460 --> 3:21:42.020]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:21:42.020 --> 3:21:48.940]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:21:48.940 --> 3:21:54.400]  Find your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in Super
[3:21:54.400 --> 3:22:01.660]  High Quality at PrismPlanet.tv, The Obama Deception, The People Strike Back.
[3:22:01.660 --> 3:22:05.860]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth
[3:22:05.860 --> 3:22:08.340]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[3:22:08.340 --> 3:22:13.380]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many
[3:22:13.380 --> 3:22:16.420]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[3:22:16.420 --> 3:22:20.740]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[3:22:20.740 --> 3:22:24.660]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[3:22:24.660 --> 3:22:28.420]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[3:22:28.420 --> 3:22:29.740]  from Jekyll Island.
[3:22:29.740 --> 3:22:33.820]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[3:22:33.820 --> 3:22:38.780]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[3:22:38.780 --> 3:22:40.220]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[3:22:40.220 --> 3:22:44.940]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[3:22:49.780 --> 3:22:52.860]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[3:23:01.180 --> 3:23:06.100]  With food prices soaring to all time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value,
[3:23:06.100 --> 3:23:10.100]  what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make
[3:23:10.100 --> 3:23:11.940]  it to your dinner table?
[3:23:11.940 --> 3:23:17.460]  Garden in a can, Garden in a can is your source for premium long term storeable seeds.

[3:23:21.140 --> 3:23:22.140]  need them.
[3:23:22.140 --> 3:23:27.100]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds, along with
[3:23:27.100 --> 3:23:31.940]  detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long term protection.
[3:23:31.940 --> 3:23:38.900]  Garden in a can, it's that simple, fresh, healthy, easy, only $69.95 for over a half
[3:23:38.900 --> 3:23:42.620]  acre of safe fresh vegetables, ready when you are.

[3:24:15.300 --> 3:24:23.100]  Now most of the alpha maggots that work for the Neural Order, work for the Soviets or
[3:24:23.100 --> 3:24:32.380]  the Nazis, and then their children are, then the people running things now.
[3:24:32.380 --> 3:24:38.900]  But I knew that Soros had some bad things going on in his background.
[3:24:38.900 --> 3:24:41.220]  Go ahead and finish up with that story Bob Shavin.
[3:24:41.220 --> 3:24:46.020]  Very despicable because what he did was go to Jewish families and tell them, look I'm
[3:24:46.020 --> 3:24:51.220]  Jewish and you know I'll help you hide your stuff and get you out of the country and that
[3:24:51.220 --> 3:24:56.580]  sort of thing and he found out where their wealth was and you know the next day they
[3:24:56.580 --> 3:25:01.220]  marched in with the Gestapo and cooked their wealth and then you know put them on a train
[3:25:01.220 --> 3:25:06.980]  and sent them someplace and so you know this is the worst of the worst, it's just like
[3:25:06.980 --> 3:25:12.100]  made off of what he did to all the Jewish charities and et cetera, et cetera.
[3:25:12.100 --> 3:25:16.860]  I mean it doesn't get any worse than that as a human being and I just want to let people
[3:25:16.860 --> 3:25:25.380]  know this arrogant, connected member of the Illuminati, where he's coming from and it's
[3:25:25.380 --> 3:25:28.580]  not a very illustrious history, that's for sure.
[3:25:28.580 --> 3:25:32.620]  Yeah, I had seen that but I'm glad you gave us more details.
[3:25:32.620 --> 3:25:36.980]  Well you know about Albright, her dad is on record killing a million and then stealing
[3:25:36.980 --> 3:25:37.980]  everybody's stuff.
[3:25:37.980 --> 3:25:42.660]  I mean these people are sick and then she was on 60 Minutes with all these million dollar
[3:25:42.660 --> 3:25:49.620]  famous paintings behind her stolen from famous families by the Soviets, they really want
[3:25:49.620 --> 3:25:50.620]  to do that here.
[3:25:50.620 --> 3:25:54.140]  I mean look at all the Trotskyites came over here and founded the Neocon movement.
[3:25:54.140 --> 3:26:00.140]  I mean it's so weird that every founding Neocon was a Trotskyite who then decided they take
[3:26:00.140 --> 3:26:04.060]  over the conservative movement and they've done it, then you've got the left over here,
[3:26:04.060 --> 3:26:07.540]  they're all controlled by a bunch of criminals Bob.
[3:26:07.540 --> 3:26:13.180]  That's right and it's always been that way and that's what this whole bag is all about.
[3:26:13.180 --> 3:26:20.860]  This is a white collar criminal element if you may and some of them before were not white
[3:26:20.860 --> 3:26:27.180]  collar but they are now and that again is their arrogance, they can get away with anything.
[3:26:27.180 --> 3:26:35.460]  I mean like look as an example, yesterday Carlisle Corporation was fined, I'll guess
[3:26:35.460 --> 3:26:40.660]  a 20 million, it's in this issue coming out tomorrow and what they were doing in order
[3:26:40.660 --> 3:26:47.340]  to get funds from the state of New York to invest for the state of New York, they were
[3:26:47.340 --> 3:26:54.140]  paying people off and they were doing it through intermediaries hoping that if something happened
[3:26:54.140 --> 3:26:58.860]  and they get caught the intermediaries would be blamed and of course they said they didn't
[3:26:58.860 --> 3:27:00.860]  know what they were doing and of course they did.
[3:27:00.860 --> 3:27:02.860]  Bob I had a state senator on here.
[3:27:02.860 --> 3:27:09.420]  The bottom line is this, there's two sets of jurisprudence in America, the guys at
[3:27:09.420 --> 3:27:15.020]  the top never get put in jail or hardly ever and they pay a fine and they go back and do
[3:27:15.020 --> 3:27:16.740]  it the next day.
[3:27:16.740 --> 3:27:20.900]  The average American goes and does that, he's doing 5 to 10.
[3:27:20.900 --> 3:27:26.340]  Absolutely, but the point I was going to interrupt was it's confirmed there's federal bounties
[3:27:26.340 --> 3:27:30.020]  and they have to increase them each year to even get their quota to kidnap kids and that
[3:27:30.020 --> 3:27:34.180]  they're told how to lie, just like recruiters are told to tell kids sign the paper or you'll
[3:27:34.180 --> 3:27:39.220]  be arrested and then they get promoted when they get caught and she was giving documented
[3:27:39.220 --> 3:27:44.220]  cases where they don't just have bounties on kids but where the adoption agencies that
[3:27:44.220 --> 3:27:48.460]  may be getting $400,000 for the blonde or blue eyed kid, they say we need this many
[3:27:48.460 --> 3:27:53.020]  this week, go out and get them and they go out and comb and get them and it may be pedophiles
[3:27:53.020 --> 3:27:56.820]  who want, they say I want a 7 year old blonde hair blue eyed or I want a dark hair girl
[3:27:56.820 --> 3:28:02.020]  or I want a black girl and they literally have been caught, she's got the documents
[3:28:02.020 --> 3:28:07.180]  where they go out and grab your kid and they're getting payoffs and legal money.
[3:28:07.180 --> 3:28:12.740]  I mean pretty soon, I mean will it take bureaucrats eating our children on the front lawn barbecuing
[3:28:12.740 --> 3:28:17.260]  them and then if you don't like it the SWAT team comes, I mean how evil does this government
[3:28:17.260 --> 3:28:19.540]  have to get Bob, how illegitimate?
[3:28:19.540 --> 3:28:27.300]  Well, I think a lot of Americans realize this and I got a report last week from several
[3:28:27.300 --> 3:28:34.500]  different gun shows, people standing 15 deep waiting to buy a minimum, they wouldn't sell
[3:28:34.500 --> 3:28:41.580]  small lots of a thousand rounds or more of ammunition at any given time and they at this
[3:28:41.580 --> 3:28:46.940]  one particular show, I got details on, they brought in two of these great big large trailers
[3:28:46.940 --> 3:28:54.500]  full of all kinds of cased ammunition and in three or four hours it was all gone.
[3:28:54.500 --> 3:28:59.420]  So I think the American public's catching on, they know something's going to happen
[3:28:59.420 --> 3:29:03.620]  and they're trying to prepare for it because they know that their system hasn't been working
[3:29:03.620 --> 3:29:04.620]  for them.
[3:29:04.620 --> 3:29:09.260]  I agree Bob and I think the dirty bankers are used to rolling over Cuba and in Cambodia
[3:29:09.260 --> 3:29:15.460]  and Russia and China, I think they've miscalculated and I think America's going to find its old
[3:29:15.460 --> 3:29:19.740]  vicious instincts and it's going to be a hell pit, it's going to be an absolute wall-to-wall
[3:29:19.740 --> 3:29:22.660]  bloodbath unless the new order backs off now.
[3:29:22.660 --> 3:29:28.700]  Well, I'll tell you one thing, we are not taking any prisoners and if they think they're
[3:29:28.700 --> 3:29:31.500]  going to hide, they're not, we'll find them.
[3:29:31.500 --> 3:29:36.220]  Well that's the issue and when this war is all said and done, I want to make sure all
[3:29:36.220 --> 3:29:41.940]  the bankers are arrested and I mean the elite bankers, not your corner grocer, the delivery
[3:29:41.940 --> 3:29:51.940]  boy, Bob Chapman stay with us financial news straight ahead.
[3:29:51.940 --> 3:30:01.940]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.940 --> 3:30:06.240]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer
[3:30:06.240 --> 3:30:10.580]  provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[3:30:10.580 --> 3:30:15.900]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[3:30:15.900 --> 3:30:21.020]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[3:31:01.980 --> 3:31:07.420]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:31:07.420 --> 3:31:14.060]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:31:14.060 --> 3:31:15.380]  just as well-funded.
[3:31:15.380 --> 3:31:20.540]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests
[3:31:20.540 --> 3:31:22.020]  of the American people.
[3:31:22.020 --> 3:31:26.420]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:31:26.420 --> 3:31:31.540]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:31:31.540 --> 3:31:38.060]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:31:38.060 --> 3:31:41.620]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:31:41.620 --> 3:31:48.540]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:31:56.740 --> 3:32:02.300]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:32:02.300 --> 3:32:06.020]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[3:32:06.020 --> 3:32:10.140]  problems facing the US and the world, and for the first time in their lives, they are
[3:32:10.140 --> 3:32:12.220]  feeling the need for preparedness.
[3:32:12.220 --> 3:32:16.740]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated
[3:32:16.740 --> 3:32:18.740]  foods for almost 40 years.

[3:34:10.680 --> 3:34:14.240]  right let's go back to Bob Chapman Bob I've been asking the questions here I
[3:34:14.240 --> 3:34:17.440]  want you to take a few minutes out to get into anything that you think is
[3:34:17.440 --> 3:34:20.840]  important I would imagine that always seems to be metals where do you see the
[3:34:20.840 --> 3:34:25.440]  market going and metals but also in other commodities we've seen gold and
[3:34:25.440 --> 3:34:29.120]  silver racing up in the big banks trying to pound it down but it seems they're
[3:34:29.120 --> 3:34:32.500]  not having as much success Chinese starting to dump the dollar other
[3:34:32.500 --> 3:34:36.800]  nations publicly dumping the dollar how long can this hold or can they just keep
[3:34:36.800 --> 3:34:40.800]  playing games forever because normally gold be going down in the summer what
[3:34:40.800 --> 3:34:46.080]  are we gonna see this fall I think the rule rules about gold going down at this
[3:34:46.080 --> 3:34:51.480]  time of that time you can throw them out the window because of the intercession
[3:34:51.480 --> 3:34:55.920]  into the markets by the United States government and others in the manipulations
[3:34:55.920 --> 3:35:01.440]  that have gone on that anything can happen at any time the suppression of
[3:35:01.440 --> 3:35:06.040]  gold has happened because central banks in conjunction with one another were
[3:35:06.040 --> 3:35:12.120]  gold sellers and they have been over the past ten years or more and you know we
[3:35:12.120 --> 3:35:18.200]  saw England selling gold at 275 sold out three quarters of their gold and now
[3:35:18.200 --> 3:35:22.560]  they're offside about seven or eight billion dollars that they threw down the
[3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:29.240]  sewer so to speak but the point is this they only had 33,000 tons my guess is
[3:35:29.240 --> 3:35:33.000]  they probably get less than 5,000 tons left and how they've been deceiving
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:40.600]  everybody is that they have been leasing gold two billion market makers
[3:35:40.600 --> 3:35:45.960]  which would be JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs et cetera and they would take this
[3:35:45.960 --> 3:35:50.840]  gold and they would either pay a half or percent interest or no interest or
[3:35:50.840 --> 3:35:56.200]  sometimes they get paid to take the gold off the central banks hands and they
[3:35:56.200 --> 3:36:01.120]  would sell it into the market to depress the price at certain times now what's
[3:36:01.120 --> 3:36:05.120]  happened in the interim they didn't want they the central banks didn't want
[3:36:05.120 --> 3:36:11.240]  people to see them doing that so they leased the gold to the to the bullion
[3:36:11.240 --> 3:36:17.720]  dealers who in turn sold it the little trick here is that in their accounting
[3:36:17.720 --> 3:36:24.440]  procedure all of these central banks are holding this leased gold on the books
[3:36:24.440 --> 3:36:31.760]  is still having had it when in fact it was sold long ago so I tell you that
[3:36:31.760 --> 3:36:35.800]  because they don't have much gold left that's what I was about to ask you I've
[3:36:35.800 --> 3:36:39.320]  seen that in the news where a lot of big nations and corporations are starting to
[3:36:39.320 --> 3:36:44.240]  say we want our gold out of your vaults well Germany just asked for their
[3:36:44.240 --> 3:36:48.640]  Switzerland asked for theirs and you know I got a question today by email well
[3:36:48.640 --> 3:36:53.160]  what why are they doing that well very simply they don't trust the alumnus
[3:36:53.160 --> 3:36:56.120]  running the United States government anymore that's what I was about to say
[3:36:56.120 --> 3:37:00.560]  when you start seeing countries moving their gold reserves on a private
[3:37:00.560 --> 3:37:05.680]  central bank vaults that is a you know that's like seeing a giant thunder head
[3:37:05.680 --> 3:37:09.520]  with lightning and wind blowing at you and it's boiling towards you you don't
[3:37:09.520 --> 3:37:13.440]  have to be a rocket scientist to know that the economic tumult we're already
[3:37:13.440 --> 3:37:20.040]  in is just the just the very leading edge Bob well it's like lightning over the
[3:37:20.040 --> 3:37:27.320]  Treasury building and incidentally Dubai has asked for their gold from the
[3:37:27.320 --> 3:37:33.240]  British and so I think there's a few now countries who would like their gold in
[3:37:33.240 --> 3:37:37.520]  their own vaults so is this the heading towards the exit mark is this the
[3:37:37.520 --> 3:37:43.620]  heading towards the exits yes I think it is and and I don't think they can get
[3:37:43.620 --> 3:37:48.480]  away with this leasing facade much longer and I don't think they have much
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:54.600]  gold left to sell in the market anyway and so I think that this is going to
[3:37:54.600 --> 3:37:58.480]  come to an end and I think it will come to an end as soon as gold and silver
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:03.840]  breakout and they're both in re in reverse head and shoulders formations
[3:38:03.840 --> 3:38:08.760]  technically which means that these are long-term formations which means that
[3:38:08.760 --> 3:38:14.000]  when they do break out the two of them will go berserk and I don't think it's
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:18.960]  very far away and that's why Ted Anderson and I and others have been saying
[3:38:18.960 --> 3:38:24.400]  look take this opportunity created by the alumnus of driving the prices of
[3:38:24.400 --> 3:38:30.160]  these metals down to where they should not be by buying them and then when the
[3:38:30.160 --> 3:38:35.560]  leverage disappears and gold and silver take off you'll be able to keep your
[3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:45.280]  wealth intact and you might even become wealthy Bob what's the time frame on
[3:38:45.280 --> 3:38:50.360]  this then I mean gold's up what fifty something bucks in the last week silver's
[3:38:50.360 --> 3:38:55.520]  up a few bucks I mean you see it going up before it goes back down for another
[3:38:55.520 --> 3:38:58.880]  you know testing a bottom or do you see it just racing back through like we had
[3:38:58.880 --> 3:39:02.560]  last summer but instead of going up to one thousand something one thousand two
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:05.320]  hundred one thousand three hundred one thousand four hundred I mean we're gonna
[3:39:05.320 --> 3:39:10.760]  see the next time it crest how how do you think it'll go well I think it can
[3:39:10.760 --> 3:39:15.680]  easily go to 1200 for starters and then it probably will feed upon itself and get
[3:39:15.680 --> 3:39:21.760]  back up to or go to two thousand on the gold and you know I have a lot of
[3:39:21.760 --> 3:39:28.360]  subscribers who are very heavily involved in gold related assets and they
[3:39:28.360 --> 3:39:31.720]  said well you know I've got another million here I've got another ten
[3:39:31.720 --> 3:39:37.360]  thousand what do I do and I say well you can buy more here I know you've got a
[3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:41.960]  lot already but then again if you want you can wait and we pass through a
[3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:48.440]  thousand and then pay a higher price knowing that we've broken out but I say
[3:39:48.440 --> 3:39:53.640]  that the people who have positions or large positions and you know there's not
[3:39:53.640 --> 3:39:58.520]  much product out there either in the coins or even in the shares there's not
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:05.440]  much to choose that's why you see all these ads in 78 79 that when you had
[3:40:05.440 --> 3:40:09.040]  plenty of it what number now so that's why you see all the hundreds of stocks
[3:40:09.040 --> 3:40:14.600]  in South Africa and I used to do them they used to yield between 12 and 25
[3:40:14.600 --> 3:40:19.400]  percent annually you know the dividend and you know I bought stocks like free
[3:40:19.400 --> 3:40:26.960]  state to the duel did $8 and it went to 50 East ramp proprietary and and and
[3:40:26.960 --> 3:40:37.680]  German deep went from 35 cents to 51 and $54 in the in that time frame of four
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:41.920]  years of course these most of these companies aren't around anymore but the
[3:40:41.920 --> 3:40:47.640]  point is when the game really starts it'll be something else I mean you'll
[3:40:47.640 --> 3:40:56.960]  pick up the paper and you'll see an MS-64 that was trading for $1500 three
[3:40:56.960 --> 3:41:02.960]  months before they're selling for $5,000 or you look at Agnico Eagle which is
[3:41:02.960 --> 3:41:11.320]  selling around 53 and and and now it's selling could be selling at 144 I mean
[3:41:11.320 --> 3:41:15.120]  these are the kind of moves you're gonna see and I've been there I've been in
[3:41:15.120 --> 3:41:21.320]  every bull market in gold since 1960 now Bob the problem is gonna make is you see
[3:41:21.320 --> 3:41:26.040]  these ads everywhere in print on TV radio sell your old gold and they give
[3:41:26.040 --> 3:41:28.760]  them way under what it's worth folks what does that tell you when there's all
[3:41:28.760 --> 3:41:32.880]  these ads trying to buy your gold that's because there's a shortage everywhere
[3:41:32.880 --> 3:41:38.000]  and the and and companies are trying to buy this stuff up right now most coin
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:42.080]  dealers still have very low supplies of gold and silver it's wage act up prices
[3:41:42.080 --> 3:41:45.600]  and speaking of that we got a guest coming up who was an American who was
[3:41:45.600 --> 3:41:48.480]  told he couldn't videotape in England or he'd be charged as a terrorist that
[3:41:48.480 --> 3:41:51.560]  video and audio is coming up here in just a few minutes video for present
[3:41:51.560 --> 3:41:54.800]  planet dot TV viewers audio for everybody else but this video is up on
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:41:59.560]  info wars.com but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up for the weekend because Ted
[3:41:59.560 --> 3:42:03.360]  still has gold and he's almost out of it and this has happened before folks he's
[3:42:03.360 --> 3:42:08.000]  gonna be out soon he still has quite a few different types of coins that are
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:13.720]  collector coins but that he's selling at bullion prices bullion prices from two
[3:42:13.720 --> 3:42:17.680]  weeks ago but he's all he's selling out in fact let's bring Ted up Ted you said
[3:42:17.680 --> 3:42:20.680]  you're getting pretty low but on the sovereigns and on the Franks you got
[3:42:20.680 --> 3:42:23.800]  some other coins that you got at positions you know two weeks ago
[3:42:23.800 --> 3:42:30.360]  gold's up 50 something bucks since then silver's up and you've got the half
[3:42:30.360 --> 3:42:35.200]  dollars tell folks what you've got Ted Anderson I'll do that right now Alex
[3:42:35.200 --> 3:42:38.880]  because yeah you and I kind of went over the inventory last week and we had a
[3:42:38.880 --> 3:42:45.240]  incredible sum of British sovereigns and French Franks at that 880 level the
[3:42:45.240 --> 3:42:48.760]  the they're not all sold out therefore I'm gonna hold it right through the
[3:42:48.760 --> 3:42:53.280]  weekend but I still have the Frank at 214 and have the British sovereign at
[3:42:53.280 --> 3:43:00.120]  267 now Bob is so eloquent about how he articulated what's going on with the
[3:43:00.120 --> 3:43:03.320]  market when it hits that thousand dollar level there's a tremendous amount of
[3:43:03.320 --> 3:43:07.560]  pressure from central banks the countries of the world trying to press it back
[3:43:07.560 --> 3:43:11.880]  down and if you're a trader like me you get to see that you get to read that and
[3:43:11.880 --> 3:43:16.560]  that's why when the gold was down there around 880 it creates a little position
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:20.520]  where I can get in and I can pick up you know a half a million to a million
[3:43:20.520 --> 3:43:24.360]  dollars with the gold coins to have a made available later on because you know
[3:43:24.360 --> 3:43:27.440]  it's like a rubber band you're pushing it down but you know it's gonna spring
[3:43:27.440 --> 3:43:31.320]  back they don't have enough reserves to hold it together and really the gold
[3:43:31.320 --> 3:43:35.320]  market tells the story they're trying to they're trying to put the smoke and
[3:43:35.320 --> 3:43:38.640]  mirrors in front of us but the gold market keeps coming back and raging
[3:43:38.640 --> 3:43:42.120]  through you're right about that head and shoulders things Bob when we get through
[3:43:42.120 --> 3:43:45.600]  that thousand dollar level you know that's that's the resistance point and
[3:43:45.600 --> 3:43:51.200]  when it breaks that point you know I really truly believe we'll see $1500
[3:43:51.200 --> 3:43:55.040]  gold or better and it's not gonna be it's not gonna be a short-term thing it's
[3:43:55.040 --> 3:43:58.120]  gonna just like you'll get through that thousand it'll hold the next thing you
[3:43:58.120 --> 3:44:02.840]  know 1200 1500 and now you're trading at a level where gold comes down to 1200
[3:44:02.840 --> 3:44:08.280]  bucks and looks like a goodbye then but you but Alex at this point in time the
[3:44:08.280 --> 3:44:12.680]  stuff that I've accumulated here just a couple weeks ago a week ago is trading
[3:44:12.680 --> 3:44:18.000]  at 880 range and now we have 930 dollar 930 dollar gold my prices will be going
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:22.680]  up and more than likely I'll have to you know raise those prices on Monday just
[3:44:22.680 --> 3:44:25.840]  because of the fact that you know I'm I'm not a miracle worker I don't I'm not
[3:44:25.840 --> 3:44:30.280]  creating gold from nothing I actually have to buy it and when I have the
[3:44:30.280 --> 3:44:34.520]  opportunities I just hope the central banks try it again because they're
[3:44:34.520 --> 3:44:38.600]  losing that battle and every time they make gold a better buy I'm in there
[3:44:38.600 --> 3:44:42.520]  trying to snap up deals and then I can offer them later on so Chad but you will
[3:44:42.520 --> 3:44:46.080]  guarantee the deal through midnight coming up on Sunday evening into Monday
[3:44:46.080 --> 3:44:49.440]  morning brothers will be there all weekend on the sovereigns on the
[3:44:49.440 --> 3:44:54.320]  Franks what else do you have at that 880 the sober and the Franklin haves at
[3:44:54.320 --> 3:45:01.440]  that 869 level that reflects over at $11 an ounce the the sober has been real
[3:45:01.440 --> 3:45:08.520]  strong and the Lakota coin even at 1966 with sober as strong as it is I'm sure
[3:45:08.520 --> 3:45:11.840]  that thing's gonna be trading over 20 bucks yeah but stop right there let's
[3:45:11.840 --> 3:45:17.320]  explain this to people you had Lakota's at $17 which they're $25 everywhere
[3:45:17.320 --> 3:45:20.520]  else you had to go up to 19 when you bought more because silver gone up so
[3:45:20.520 --> 3:45:26.720]  much you still have silver half dollars the Franklins at the price when
[3:45:26.720 --> 3:45:32.040]  silver was 11 bucks factored in now what is it 14 yeah it's it's trading right
[3:45:32.040 --> 3:45:36.760]  at 14 it pokes up to about $14 and 20 cents then it gets down to the high
[3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:42.760]  13's right now the last time I looked silver was at $14 even hit 14 20
[3:45:42.760 --> 3:45:48.480]  regardless regardless folks we can't figure that out Ted is selling silver at
[3:45:48.480 --> 3:45:53.080]  the price it was when it was $11 an ounce factored in you can find nothing
[3:45:53.080 --> 3:45:58.600]  like this check for yourselves 800 686 237 I just believe in this so much folks
[3:45:58.600 --> 3:46:01.880]  and that's what I bought last week was some silver I bought some Lakota's back
[3:46:01.880 --> 3:46:06.680]  at that 17 level and you can still get it with these half dollars 800 686
[3:46:06.680 --> 3:46:16.720]  2237 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 the trusted name minus resources Patriots
[3:46:16.720 --> 3:46:20.600]  great folks and what other little gold coins you got I know I saw that huge
[3:46:20.600 --> 3:46:23.880]  inventory had a week ago or so you showed me but I know that's almost all
[3:46:23.880 --> 3:46:29.000]  gone what do you got left anything else yeah we do have some buffaloes but
[3:46:29.000 --> 3:46:31.760]  Alex I think if somebody bought 20 of them for me they take out my whole
[3:46:31.760 --> 3:46:35.560]  inventory and I wish I could buy a thousand of them but I just can't can't
[3:46:35.560 --> 3:46:38.840]  get what else you got that tough you know the other thing too is these these
[3:46:38.840 --> 3:46:42.600]  halves that we're talking about just about a year ago at this time I couldn't
[3:46:42.600 --> 3:46:46.400]  get anything at all I mean if I had a if I had a million dollars to buy it
[3:46:46.400 --> 3:46:51.040]  wouldn't matter because nobody had them to deliver and at that time I did so you
[3:46:51.040 --> 3:46:54.480]  know that was just the experience I had just then and the things are breaking
[3:46:54.480 --> 3:46:58.400]  loose here I mean there's so much going on economically that you know that gold

[3:47:08.440 --> 3:47:11.800]  folks take advantage of this deal yeah well not not just midnight tonight going
[3:47:11.800 --> 3:47:15.440]  right through Sunday yeah you can go ahead and we'll honor these prices
[3:47:15.440 --> 3:47:18.880]  clean through the weekend and and we'll see what's going on a Monday maybe who
[3:47:18.880 --> 3:47:21.600]  knows maybe we can get another opportunity to buy them low I doubt it
[3:47:21.600 --> 3:47:25.600]  yeah take advantage of it thank you Ted I just asking you Bob because you're
[3:47:25.600 --> 3:47:29.160]  separate from Genesis and Midas is that a good deal on gold and silver you just
[3:47:29.160 --> 3:47:37.320]  heard oh yes it is and I've been a buyer myself and gold right now is up 350 in
[3:47:37.320 --> 3:47:42.360]  the late trading in the outside month which is June and I don't know what
[3:47:42.360 --> 3:47:48.120]  spot closed at today but gold is acting strongly and I wouldn't be surprised if
[3:47:48.120 --> 3:47:53.200]  it wasn't up firmly on Monday which is not normally a good day for gold and so
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:47:58.440]  you know the prices at anywhere in this level you know people say to me well
[3:47:58.440 --> 3:48:02.560]  should I wait to see if it comes down look you're not traded you can't second
[3:48:02.560 --> 3:48:08.480]  guess this market you just buy it just buy it you know that's what I do I don't
[3:48:08.480 --> 3:48:14.080]  even ask what the price is I just say this is what I've got can you buy this
[3:48:14.080 --> 3:48:21.040]  or that with that and that's it I don't even look well the bottom line is is
[3:48:21.040 --> 3:48:23.880]  that I bought gold it was 300 bucks an ounce that I've done well and I bought
[3:48:23.880 --> 3:48:27.240]  silver almost five bucks an ounce now we got a guest coming out the next final
[3:48:27.240 --> 3:48:31.120]  segment Bob and I and I want you to comment on this briefly when we come
[3:48:31.120 --> 3:48:34.720]  back all over England I've been there they walk up and say you can't have a
[3:48:34.720 --> 3:48:38.600]  camera it's an act of terrorism to videotape them now they're arresting
[3:48:38.600 --> 3:48:42.600]  people in the US videotaping this guy was hundred plus yards away from the
[3:48:42.600 --> 3:48:48.800]  embassy US paramilitary guys come over the British come over and read him the
[3:48:48.800 --> 3:48:51.760]  riot act let's play that video then we'll come back and talk to the man
[3:48:51.760 --> 3:48:55.320]  briefly it happened to and get Bob Chapman's take on it here is the video
[3:48:55.320 --> 3:48:59.200]  for prison planet TV viewers the audio for everybody else but the audio is very
[3:48:59.200 --> 3:49:02.800]  self-explanatory as well here it is
[3:49:12.520 --> 3:49:22.040]  he's on a sidewalk videotaping a statue in England he's unlike a park and he's
[3:49:22.040 --> 3:49:25.400]  probably about a hundred yards away from the entrance now he's about 60 70 yards
[3:49:25.400 --> 3:49:29.600]  but yeah he's a little bit closer that area I guess that's an entrance and how
[3:49:29.600 --> 3:49:34.280]  dare him try to videotape this I was just in Canada a few years ago videotaping
[3:49:34.280 --> 3:49:37.680]  US embassy it's interesting you know you're you mean they've got cameras
[3:49:37.680 --> 3:49:42.200]  everywhere watching us and watch they come over and give him the terrorism
[3:49:42.200 --> 3:49:51.800]  code everything's for terrorism now he's even further away from the embassy he's
[3:49:51.800 --> 3:49:58.040]  walking by some police he's by a city street I guess you can't really take
[3:49:58.040 --> 3:50:02.760]  city streets what is it this criminal done by the way all these reporters are
[3:50:02.760 --> 3:50:10.160]  getting arrested in Greece right now in Builderburg sorry the American

[3:52:13.960 --> 3:52:18.600]  Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[3:52:18.600 --> 3:52:23.200]  interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging yeah fudged since
[3:52:23.200 --> 3:52:27.600]  day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[3:52:27.600 --> 3:52:32.280]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[3:52:32.280 --> 3:52:39.720]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about left to right it's

[3:53:07.360 --> 3:53:11.280]  power grid even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get
[3:53:11.280 --> 3:53:15.160]  closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid some say that this
[3:53:15.160 --> 3:53:19.200]  summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge
[3:53:19.200 --> 3:53:23.960]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting us all in the
[3:53:23.960 --> 3:53:28.600]  dark are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government
[3:53:28.600 --> 3:53:32.720]  created blackouts have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid
[3:53:32.720 --> 3:53:37.600]  and generate your own private supply of electrical power if so this will be the

[3:55:17.440 --> 3:55:21.000]  is what they're doing here as well they're arresting people ever but they
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:26.480]  don't have the law yet Bob Chapman what's that sound like to you it sounds
[3:55:26.480 --> 3:55:32.720]  like a police state and you know these policemen better smart now because they
[3:55:32.720 --> 3:55:37.200]  may end up on the other end of the stick along the way and they just love
[3:55:37.200 --> 3:55:41.720]  calling citizens terrorists they just get off on it it's their excuse let's go
[3:55:41.720 --> 3:55:45.680]  to Charlie beach Charlie you were over there why were you filming the evil
[3:55:45.680 --> 3:55:50.280]  embassy you're some kind of al-qaeda person of course I am yes well I was
[3:55:50.280 --> 3:55:54.360]  just riding my bicycle on a nice sunny day in central London and may fear is
[3:55:54.360 --> 3:55:57.960]  one of the nicest posh is most touristy areas of London and the American
[3:55:57.960 --> 3:56:02.120]  Embassy is very very interesting it's very open it's very public anyone can
[3:56:02.120 --> 3:56:06.800]  walk past and have a look I decided to with my new camera just film along the
[3:56:06.800 --> 3:56:10.800]  right-hand side of it and just um see if there's gonna be a reaction and the
[3:56:10.800 --> 3:56:15.600]  reaction you can go to Google Street view you can everybody it's crap they
[3:56:15.600 --> 3:56:20.160]  don't want us taping them while they tape us so so how did all this end well
[3:56:20.160 --> 3:56:24.960]  after they actually switch the viewfinder of my camera off forcibly and
[3:56:24.960 --> 3:56:28.800]  then they held up my arms by the wrist so I was there like a prostate on the
[3:56:28.800 --> 3:56:33.120]  cross and they actually rifled through my pockets without asking me anything and
[3:56:33.120 --> 3:56:36.920]  they took my ID out and they radioed me in and and they said that the reason they
[3:56:36.920 --> 3:56:40.720]  had to use force was because I wasn't compliant but I was actually being
[3:56:40.720 --> 3:56:44.800]  rude to them and they were actually just saying hey you're a terrorist and you
[3:56:44.800 --> 3:56:48.280]  might be able to use this for terrorist purposes so we have every right to treat
[3:56:48.280 --> 3:56:52.760]  you as such and the reason why I I was probably a bit too polite to them is
[3:56:52.760 --> 3:56:56.240]  because in Britain they have the right to detain you for 28 days without charge
[3:56:56.240 --> 3:56:59.760]  and I was actually scared maybe maybe we should force that issue because these
[3:56:59.760 --> 3:57:03.560]  you know these guys also spy on the parliament without Bob Chapman in
[3:57:03.560 --> 3:57:07.760]  closing I've got video here of a school teacher kicking a five-year-old in the
[3:57:07.760 --> 3:57:12.440]  face the state is treating us like slaves it's out of control Bob Chapman how
[3:57:12.440 --> 3:57:15.880]  do we stand up against this start rolling that folks the background without
[3:57:15.880 --> 3:57:20.920]  audio well I think the the best thing to do is to get your videos out and all the
[3:57:20.920 --> 3:57:25.200]  things that you do Alex and keep on piping it over the way airways and I
[3:57:25.200 --> 3:57:29.440]  keep on telling them the same thing that you are and that's really all we can
[3:57:29.440 --> 3:57:35.600]  do absolutely listen Charlie Beach I want to do a whole show on this with a
[3:57:35.600 --> 3:57:39.440]  bunch of people in England being arrested and detained for videotaping cops
