[00:00.000 --> 00:07.800]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.800 --> 00:15.880]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:19.200 --> 00:24.800]  Stand by, ladies and gentlemen, global transmission against tyranny. Now
[00:24.800 --> 00:30.880]  commencing. T-minus 10 seconds.
[00:34.480 --> 00:40.560]  It is the 20th of March 2008. We're gonna be live here for the next three
[00:40.560 --> 00:45.160]  hours. The head financial writer for the London Guardian, the largest paper in
[00:45.160 --> 00:50.000]  England and Europe will be joining us as he is now exposing the fact that this is
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.800]  an engineered collapse and fraud going on within the banking system. Then Aubrey
[00:55.800 --> 00:59.280]  DeGray, we only had him on about 30 minutes last week. It'll be almost a full
[00:59.280 --> 01:05.000]  hour today to talk about the true development of life extension technologies
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.520]  and how far along it really is and how that ties into the elite and how they
[01:10.520 --> 01:17.040]  wish to suppress these technologies from the public getting access to them. So
[01:17.040 --> 01:21.360]  that is coming up with Aubrey DeGray in the second hour and then we will go to
[01:21.360 --> 01:26.360]  Tibet again or from the border of Tibet from India where the exiled government
[01:26.360 --> 01:35.480]  is and the chairman of the head of the major human rights organization for the
[01:35.480 --> 01:42.000]  Tibetan people. Ujjen Tenzin who joined us on Monday. Big developments in Tibet.
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.160]  Very important broadcast today. I mean I have maybe a show every month or two that
[01:48.160 --> 01:53.000]  has this much news and info and I've got to cover it. It's all too incredible.
[01:53.000 --> 02:00.240]  Drinkers face drug checks. So see now when you go to have a drink, it's not just
[02:00.240 --> 02:04.960]  thumb scan, face scan, some bars, I take a microchip to get in. I'm not getting if
[02:04.960 --> 02:09.120]  you didn't hear about that, check into it. Now all over England they want to make
[02:09.120 --> 02:14.320]  you do a drug check. So all the part of being guilty until proven innocent will
[02:14.320 --> 02:19.800]  be breaking that down. Of course they're putting two-year-olds into probation in
[02:19.800 --> 02:24.080]  England. If their parents had criminal records saying it's genetic in Texas they
[02:24.080 --> 02:27.200]  say they put more than two-thirds of foster kids on drugs because they are
[02:27.200 --> 02:32.720]  quote genetically deficient. Just out of the blue they just say it. Oh we're
[02:32.720 --> 02:37.360]  killing you, poisoning you because you're genetically deficient. We'll be
[02:37.360 --> 02:43.200]  going over that today. I have now read the White House briefing, the brief to the
[02:43.200 --> 02:47.440]  Supreme Court saying you have no second amendment right and that all of your
[02:47.440 --> 02:54.160]  guns can be confiscated. I spent hours and hours last night reading Gunners of
[02:54.160 --> 02:57.040]  America's Brief for the Supreme Court, the Justice Department Brief from the
[02:57.040 --> 03:04.080]  White House. Of course two nights ago I read the entire 90 plus pages of their
[03:04.080 --> 03:09.000]  oral arguments what the Supreme Court justices had to say. It is bad but I've
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.120]  studied even more last night so I have even more information for you on that
[03:12.120 --> 03:19.320]  front. But here's the big news today. Comcast cameras to start watching you and
[03:19.320 --> 03:25.360]  Comcast is announcing themselves that they are going to have cameras on the
[03:25.360 --> 03:29.960]  front of all cable boxes that will watch you. Now this is hidden in plain view.
[03:29.960 --> 03:34.160]  They just come out and announce it happily and it's so shocking and
[03:34.160 --> 03:40.000]  incredible people just go okay it's a mind trick like a Jedi mind trick. Then
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.760]  it goes into psychology, corporate manipulation, Delphi technique, but
[03:45.760 --> 03:51.080]  mainstream news. I mean you will be watched in your home and if you're not
[03:51.080 --> 03:55.040]  for it you're you're a weirdo. But see the way they do this well if you don't want
[03:55.040 --> 04:01.720]  a cable box you don't have to have cable and people will know I'm I want it or
[04:01.720 --> 04:04.920]  like you don't have to have a cell phone we track you with it listen to you you
[04:04.920 --> 04:09.440]  don't have to have a cell phone and I've been telling you for 12 years that all
[04:09.440 --> 04:14.720]  of your DNA at birth if you're 35 or younger been about 35 years since it
[04:14.720 --> 04:20.280]  started started back in 72. All of your DNA is taken and put in an
[04:20.280 --> 04:28.240]  international database in Australia Canada the US New Zealand. It's in five
[04:28.240 --> 04:35.320]  nations. It finally is in the mainstream news so I thought I'd get into that too.
[04:35.320 --> 04:41.320]  Oh yeah they take your baby's blood and it goes right into Homeland Security.
[04:41.320 --> 04:46.120]  Every American is putting a DNA database at birth. It's all part of the freedom.
[04:46.120 --> 04:50.480]  We'll be right back.
[04:52.800 --> 05:01.800]  It is a big idea. A New World Order. In the near future Earth is dominated by a powerful
[05:01.800 --> 05:08.120]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Both their objective being world domination.
[05:08.120 --> 05:13.680]  For thousands of years their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the
[05:13.680 --> 05:18.840]  New World Order their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at
[05:18.840 --> 05:26.120]  hand. For the first time in history the elites plan for world government is
[05:26.120 --> 05:30.520]  blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order
[05:30.520 --> 05:39.120]  agenda. The Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their after these years.

[05:52.280 --> 05:57.000]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 all banks in
[05:57.000 --> 06:00.680]  these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they
[06:00.680 --> 06:04.080]  issue. With never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher
[06:04.080 --> 06:07.640]  interest rates it has become mathematically impossible to repay all
[06:07.640 --> 06:11.440]  debt making all of us slaves to our creditors. The Federal Debt Relief
[06:11.440 --> 06:15.440]  System has created a successful attorney backed program to legally eliminate
[06:15.440 --> 06:19.200]  credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecured debts which
[06:19.200 --> 06:22.680]  have been fraudulently created by the banks. We can terminate your unsecured
[06:22.680 --> 06:26.520]  debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment ending with nothing on
[06:26.520 --> 06:29.840]  your credit report. Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh
[06:29.840 --> 06:33.320]  of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt. Instead of living
[06:33.320 --> 06:36.720]  each day in fear and frustration it's time to take action and turn your life

[08:20.040 --> 08:26.880]  technologies and what's real what's hype joining us in the second hour then of
[08:26.880 --> 08:33.960]  course from India the Dalai Lama's government in absentia will have the
[08:33.960 --> 08:40.320]  head of their human rights and democracy group on joining us urgent tens in
[08:40.320 --> 08:43.320]  coming up in the third hour but I'll be about a 20-minute interview them to cover
[08:43.320 --> 08:49.000]  financial news and some other things of the fifth anniversary of the wondrous
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.840]  war of George Bush's manhood and strength showing off as our war
[08:54.840 --> 09:00.480]  president I'm a war president so we'll be covering that coming up as well at the
[09:00.480 --> 09:04.920]  end of the show today right now Larry Elliott joins us for this segment the
[09:04.920 --> 09:11.160]  next he is the economics editor at the London Guardian biggest paper in England
[09:11.160 --> 09:14.040]  and they do a lot of great reporting there and we're really honored to have
[09:14.040 --> 09:18.680]  him I've read a lot of his a reportage over the years but the story he did
[09:18.680 --> 09:24.880]  earlier in the week America was conned who will pay the South Sea bubble ended
[09:24.880 --> 09:31.280]  in riots as trust was lost will Wall Street to dupe the public and then it
[09:31.280 --> 09:36.600]  goes into what's really happening here and now they're leaving the dollar and
[09:36.600 --> 09:40.760]  the American people holding the bag devaluing our currency we're going to
[09:40.760 --> 09:45.000]  pay back all of these hundreds of billions a month they're pumping in to
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.800]  these brokerage firms and banks love to pay that back in tax money so they're
[09:48.800 --> 09:52.640]  going to taxes and they're devaluing our savings people on Social Security fixed
[09:52.640 --> 09:56.920]  incomes of course you know getting 600 bucks a month your check goes up 2% a
[09:56.920 --> 10:02.400]  year real inflation is about 15% so compounded you've lost half your value
[10:02.400 --> 10:06.560]  the last four years you know the head of the New York Business School on a few
[10:06.560 --> 10:11.760]  weeks ago saying you've lost about half in the last 10 years we could argue
[10:11.760 --> 10:14.880]  most of that in the last four so that's why we've got him on to really talk
[10:14.880 --> 10:19.320]  about this big con job and it's good to see more and more big financial writers
[10:19.320 --> 10:25.400]  and experts telling it like it is and thanks for coming on Mr. Elliott I've
[10:25.400 --> 10:28.680]  you can just elaborate on the article and break down now why you're saying
[10:28.680 --> 10:33.360]  that this was all a big engineered scam well I think the real point about this
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.720]  is that for a lot large part of the last 70 or 80 years since the New Deal I mean
[10:38.720 --> 10:42.520]  certainly for the first half of that America grew in steps so everybody got
[10:42.520 --> 10:47.960]  richer together so rich and poor got got got wealthier and everybody got a fair
[10:47.960 --> 10:50.960]  share of the pie of course the rich stayed rich and the poor stayed poor but
[10:50.960 --> 10:54.640]  everybody got got richer together and I think was John F. Kennedy that said a
[10:54.640 --> 10:58.480]  rising tide lifts all boats and and that was that that for sure happened in
[10:58.480 --> 11:02.920]  the in the 50s and 60s now sort of 70s and 80s some sort of weird stuff happened
[11:02.920 --> 11:06.520]  really which was that all the controls that have been put on big finance on
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.560]  Wall Street by Roosevelt and the New Dealers were gradually stripped away
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.880]  so essentially Wall Street was allowed to do pretty much what it wanted and you
[11:15.880 --> 11:20.960]  saw these stressors for ex salaries and the rich got very much richer than
[11:20.960 --> 11:25.800]  poor people who saw their salaries sort of pretty much stagnate for a large
[11:25.800 --> 11:31.480]  period of time but of course you know you still have to get people to buy stuff
[11:31.480 --> 11:35.720]  otherwise big business doesn't make any money so they came up with this great
[11:35.720 --> 11:38.440]  idea which was that everybody would get on the housing market and they went
[11:38.440 --> 11:44.280]  around and sold loans to to people who really weren't well equipped to pay the
[11:44.280 --> 11:47.560]  loans back and these are subprime and all-time loans and then these sort of
[11:47.560 --> 11:52.200]  this stuff with sort of teaser rates and exploding ARMs and so on people didn't
[11:52.200 --> 11:55.920]  really know at that point what they were signing up for but essentially they
[11:55.920 --> 12:01.240]  were told well the housing market is a great success story you know you might
[12:01.240 --> 12:03.840]  have a bit of trouble paying your mortgage back but actually you know it
[12:03.840 --> 12:07.640]  won't be a problem because you can always sell it for more than you paid for it
[12:07.640 --> 12:11.600]  and of course the what they then did and that was the first the first really
[12:11.600 --> 12:14.240]  dumb thing that happened was that they suckered a whole lot of people in to
[12:14.240 --> 12:18.280]  buying these houses that they really couldn't afford to keep up their payments
[12:18.280 --> 12:22.000]  for and they they they left sort of time bombs ticking away which would explode
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.960]  after one or two years when people had to pay much more to on that for their
[12:25.960 --> 12:29.440]  real estate and the second really dumb thing they did was that they took all
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.040]  these loans and they bundled up some of the really bad loans with some good
[12:33.040 --> 12:37.840]  some good prime loans and they sort of made them into a big paste and then they
[12:37.840 --> 12:41.680]  and they put these into securities which were then sold on Wall Street because
[12:41.680 --> 12:45.000]  Wall Street wasn't particularly well regulated and no one really knew what
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.040]  it was up to and someone described like this you take a sort of a meat pie
[12:50.040 --> 12:55.080]  factory and you take the you you put a few really rancid carcasses in there and
[12:55.080 --> 12:59.200]  you minted all up and put it into some pies and then you sell the pies off
[12:59.200 --> 13:03.640]  into the into the supermarket into Walmart or whatever and no one and then
[13:03.640 --> 13:08.680]  suddenly there's a big panic because the someone says some of these pies have
[13:08.680 --> 13:12.560]  got bad meeting them but nobody actually knows which pies have got the bad
[13:12.560 --> 13:15.520]  meeting so that's what really happened in the financial markets last year was
[13:15.520 --> 13:19.120]  that as the housing market started to go down as it never to be did because it
[13:19.120 --> 13:23.200]  was a gigantic bubble you know people said hang on we've sold all these
[13:23.200 --> 13:27.680]  securities out into Wall Street know some of the big banks are holding them
[13:27.680 --> 13:34.280]  but nobody actually knows how much the exposure is going to be now and so that
[13:34.280 --> 13:37.600]  was that was when that's when the financial markets themselves went into
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.480]  a complete into a complete meltdown because nobody would actually deal with
[13:41.480 --> 13:45.160]  anybody else because nobody knew how much of this toxic waste that got how
[13:45.160 --> 13:48.800]  many of the bad meat pies were actually sitting in city group or in Merrill
[13:48.800 --> 13:52.880]  Lynch or in Lehman Brothers or wherever and so that that's really the
[13:52.880 --> 13:56.120]  genesis of the crisis so ordinary American people who were who were
[13:56.120 --> 14:00.720]  generally I think had gone by and brothers of slick sales people who came
[14:00.720 --> 14:05.400]  round and sold in the loans have actually you know found that they but
[14:05.400 --> 14:09.000]  their loans have gone very bad and the foreclosures are going up and Wall
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.600]  Street has found itself in a state of total panic because it
[14:12.600 --> 14:16.720]  doesn't know how many how big these losses are and that's why I say America
[14:16.720 --> 14:20.000]  has been conned and who is actually going to pay for all this. Well absolutely
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  and the article you wrote America was conned who will pay gets into more detail
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.440]  and a lot of historical perspectives I want to talk about the British
[14:27.440 --> 14:33.320]  experience in the 1730s and of course then we had it in 1815 with the Roth
[14:33.320 --> 14:37.680]  Child and it just happens over and over again but but but to explain this to
[14:37.680 --> 14:42.320]  people in in or to boil it down they always make it a left right political
[14:42.320 --> 14:45.600]  football and I'm a libertarian but by the left would be seen as more right
[14:45.600 --> 14:50.040]  wing it has nothing to do with left or right but Rush Limbaugh and the other
[14:50.040 --> 14:54.880]  big neocons want to make it a political football instead of having a rancid
[14:54.880 --> 14:59.360]  corrupt financial system that's totally corrupt wouldn't we can have a
[14:59.360 --> 15:04.040]  discussion about that they get on the radio and they say evil liberals claim
[15:04.040 --> 15:10.960]  that it was the banks that did this but no it's dumb poor greedy liars and sure
[15:10.960 --> 15:20.240]  I mean I use the analogy of a five-year-old child yeah I use the analogy
[15:20.240 --> 15:23.920]  sure I just heard somebody's cell phone cut into the wire so I was a puzzle
[15:23.920 --> 15:28.520]  being an officer but carry on no no no I totally understand that's fine I was
[15:28.520 --> 15:32.880]  just pausing for you to answer or whatever yeah going back it's like a
[15:32.880 --> 15:37.320]  five-year-old child yeah yes like a five-year-old child who you tell don't
[15:37.320 --> 15:41.520]  play in the front yard and then the kidnapper comes by and kidnaps them the
[15:41.520 --> 15:46.520]  child was bad but the kidnapper is the predator and that's what we have with
[15:46.520 --> 15:50.440]  these brokerage firms and banks they knowingly went and lobbied the federal
[15:50.440 --> 15:54.240]  government to take off the restrictions in the early 90s and then in 99 as you
[15:54.240 --> 15:58.920]  know they then came in they packaged absolute crap with nothing backing it
[15:58.920 --> 16:03.480]  had companies triple a rated and then now they're selling out the dollar
[16:03.480 --> 16:08.600]  selling out having the Federal Reserve bail them out and then and then the
[16:08.600 --> 16:12.760]  average American doesn't even understand how the financial system works or even
[16:12.760 --> 16:18.040]  where DC is or where the US is on a map all they know about is Britney Spears
[16:18.040 --> 16:22.360]  and American Idol so so where do you think we're going with your economic
[16:22.360 --> 16:25.320]  expertise and what you watch with markets how bad do you think this is
[16:25.320 --> 16:29.040]  going to get are we seeing just the beginning or is everything fine I think
[16:29.040 --> 16:33.200]  this could get very bad indeed I think it is actually quite bad in the US at the
[16:33.200 --> 16:38.240]  moment we're already now over here in Britain starting to wonder whether we're
[16:38.240 --> 16:43.080]  going to get a bad dose but I think this credit crisis is is very deep and it's
[16:43.080 --> 16:46.120]  going to last a long time because there's a lot of rottenness in the
[16:46.120 --> 16:50.480]  financial system which has been allowed to build up over the last few years as
[16:50.480 --> 16:54.360]  you say these these big Wall Street firms lobbied the government very hard to
[16:54.360 --> 16:57.240]  take away all the restrictions that were put on for very good reasons in the
[16:57.240 --> 17:01.320]  1930s by the by the new dealers because they realized in the 30s that the
[17:01.320 --> 17:05.440]  problem was not the ordinary American it was the it was the sort of tendency of
[17:05.440 --> 17:09.960]  of the markets to to go for these massive specters of bubbles and that's
[17:09.960 --> 17:13.760]  really why this is no different from the South Sea bubble in the 1720s or
[17:13.760 --> 17:17.600]  tulips and holding the 17th century or the railroad booms that America had in
[17:17.600 --> 17:23.400]  the 19th century it's just a classic a classic bubble which always ends in a
[17:23.400 --> 17:27.240]  very very deep past and that's what we're getting right now and I think what
[17:27.240 --> 17:31.920]  what's interesting about all this politically is that you know Wall Street
[17:31.920 --> 17:36.600]  finds welfare a very very good idea when itself is in trouble where all the time
[17:36.600 --> 17:39.320]  that things are going well it wants the government off its back it wants
[17:39.320 --> 17:43.080]  regulations to be removed it wants it wants the freedoms to exactly what it
[17:43.080 --> 17:46.520]  wants up until the very moment when it gets into trouble then it suddenly finds
[17:46.520 --> 17:51.000]  it was a really big fat check from the US taxpayer to pay to bail it out to get
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.320]  it into it into the research let's get into the South Seas bubble because you
[17:55.320 --> 18:00.040]  call it the classic Ponzi scheme with more crap paper you know chasing more
[18:00.040 --> 18:03.960]  crap paper I mean for the average person who doesn't understand how this works the
[18:03.960 --> 18:07.680]  South Seas example I think it's a good one yeah what happened there
[18:07.680 --> 18:12.360]  people didn't actually know what they were speculating on they had loads of
[18:12.360 --> 18:17.120]  bits of paper floating around London in 1720 and in fact the prospectus of
[18:17.120 --> 18:20.840]  South Seas bubble company says something like it's a company the purpose of which
[18:20.840 --> 18:24.160]  we're not gonna tell anybody what it is that was actually what people were told
[18:24.160 --> 18:27.080]  they were told absolutely nothing about what this company was doing and in fact
[18:27.080 --> 18:29.680]  nobody knew and in fact they wasn't doing anything because it was a complete
[18:29.680 --> 18:33.480]  phony company in many many ways and essentially the markets in recent years
[18:33.480 --> 18:36.640]  have been exactly the same everybody has been buying and selling these
[18:36.640 --> 18:39.920]  securitized loans and mortgage back loans and so on and no one has had the
[18:39.920 --> 18:45.760]  first idea what this stuff is and I met someone a couple of months ago in
[18:45.760 --> 18:49.880]  Switzerland at a meeting in Davos where he said and he was the CEO of a big Swiss
[18:49.880 --> 18:53.120]  company said I was the CEO of a company and we knew these guys were out there
[18:53.120 --> 18:56.640]  doing all these weird stuff and and dealing in these exotic financial
[18:56.640 --> 18:59.480]  instruments and we just turned a blind eye to it because they were making us
[18:59.480 --> 19:01.920]  money and we didn't know what they were doing but we thought hell they're
[19:01.920 --> 19:04.720]  making loads of money let them get on with it I mean that and that was the
[19:04.720 --> 19:08.280]  problem that's why it was exactly the same as a South Seas bubble that it was
[19:08.280 --> 19:11.560]  it was it was people were just buying because everybody else was buying and
[19:11.560 --> 19:16.000]  if you know that and then eventually you it does become a policy scheme and
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.280]  there's yeah and I would say there's no doubt that we could have imploded in the
[19:20.280 --> 19:25.000]  70s the 80s the 90s I mean it already built up but the corruption of the 90s
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.600]  and 2000s makes the stuff of the 60s the 70s look like a tea party and we're now
[19:29.600 --> 19:33.760]  entering the end of this mega global bubble it's not just gonna affect the
[19:33.760 --> 19:37.280]  US it's gonna pull the world down with us I want to come back and get your take
[19:37.280 --> 19:40.560]  on how bad you think it'll get what what the experts are telling you the
[19:40.560 --> 19:46.040]  time frame is with all of this with the financial editor at the London Guardian
[19:46.040 --> 19:50.080]  largest paper in England and probably in Europe one final segment with him if
[19:50.080 --> 19:53.360]  there's a quick break stay with us
[19:53.800 --> 19:58.640]  do you know the truth about cancer treatments do you realize that with all
[19:58.640 --> 20:03.280]  presently accepted methods you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you
[20:03.280 --> 20:08.400]  are mostly fighting to survive the treatment do you realize that mutilating
[20:08.400 --> 20:13.840]  surgery burning and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary

[24:26.360 --> 24:31.240]  all right going back to uh... larry elliott is the financial editor of the
[24:31.240 --> 24:35.040]  london guardian
[24:35.040 --> 24:39.480]  we were talking about uh... collusion and it's admitted that from the big
[24:39.480 --> 24:41.400]  brokerage companies and banks
[24:41.400 --> 24:46.720]  right down to the uh... local appraisers the realtors
[24:46.720 --> 24:51.240]  uh... the and then yes the people taking the loans but they're very i have no
[24:51.240 --> 24:52.200]  money i
[24:52.200 --> 24:55.360]  i have a fake dollar an hour job but i'm getting three thousand dollar house i
[24:55.360 --> 24:55.840]  mean
[24:55.840 --> 24:57.660]  they just did it
[24:57.660 --> 25:01.100]  and uh... so can you speak to that i mean this amazing
[25:01.100 --> 25:03.760]  systemic corruption across the board
[25:03.760 --> 25:05.980]  i i think it's a bit bizarre to
[25:05.980 --> 25:09.400]  to blame the people right at the bottom for this i mean i think that's a rather
[25:09.400 --> 25:12.460]  bizarre they were told that they could leave the american dream and
[25:12.460 --> 25:15.200]  on their own home even though they weren't very well often i don't get this
[25:15.200 --> 25:17.920]  was advertised as the financial instrument
[25:17.920 --> 25:20.240]  yeah i mean i mean alan greenspan has been
[25:20.240 --> 25:24.080]  bang on about this uh... in his memoir saying that the good thing about what
[25:24.080 --> 25:27.040]  happened in the last few years was a little people to get there
[25:27.040 --> 25:30.080]  for on the property that that was the way it was heavily marketed to people i
[25:30.080 --> 25:31.520]  think a lot of people
[25:31.520 --> 25:35.000]  you know they would take that they did raise issues with uh... with the people
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.960]  who came out of all the mall and said
[25:36.960 --> 25:39.760]  you know actually i don't have a full-time job or you know i don't know
[25:39.760 --> 25:42.400]  how much money and people and the people who are telling them a lot of that
[25:42.400 --> 25:45.120]  doesn't matter i mean you know hey chill i mean they said
[25:45.120 --> 25:47.920]  you know we can we can sort that would give you a low-cost loan they didn't
[25:47.920 --> 25:51.200]  actually tell them all the ramifications of it what would happen after one or
[25:51.200 --> 25:54.160]  two years when the real when the real deal kicked in so
[25:54.160 --> 25:58.000]  i think people really were taken for a ride and to blame them for it that's
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.960]  what people are saying in the in the in the u.s i think that's actually
[26:00.960 --> 26:05.040]  pretty poor of them to say that but i mean essentially that the problem
[26:05.040 --> 26:07.600]  was that in order to keep the housing market
[26:07.600 --> 26:10.960]  bubble going you had to actually get those poor people
[26:10.960 --> 26:14.080]  into the into the into the housing market because you you know it's like
[26:14.080 --> 26:17.440]  abducting a child exactly exactly i mean you said that i mean
[26:17.440 --> 26:21.920]  but the markets the markets need a constant supply of first-time buyers
[26:21.920 --> 26:25.360]  uh... in order to keep going prices have gone up so much in the boom that first
[26:25.360 --> 26:28.240]  time buyers couldn't actually afford to get on the housing matter without them
[26:28.240 --> 26:29.280]  being given
[26:29.280 --> 26:32.720]  the special supposedly fees loans and low-cost mortgages so that that was the
[26:32.720 --> 26:36.800]  route and i just want to add that they may have cut interest rates you know
[26:36.800 --> 26:40.480]  down to almost nothing they're not they're still not giving loans to people
[26:40.480 --> 26:44.160]  that have pretty good credit nothing i think i mean the the level of fed
[26:44.160 --> 26:47.760]  funds rate is really irrelevant to the real level of mortgages that people
[26:47.760 --> 26:49.920]  are actually playing because what's happening is that
[26:49.920 --> 26:53.760]  wall street firms have taken such big hits on their profitability as a result
[26:53.760 --> 26:57.040]  of all the stupid stuff they did then they are now trying to make that money
[26:57.040 --> 27:00.320]  back by pushing up the interest rates they're actually charged their
[27:00.320 --> 27:02.800]  customers so i would bet there aren't too many people
[27:02.800 --> 27:07.760]  across the u.s who can get a loan anywhere from a from a from a firm for
[27:07.760 --> 27:10.720]  two percent or anything like it every bank eight or nine percent easily for
[27:10.720 --> 27:13.920]  their mortgage loans and that's going to that's a real hit to people i've actually
[27:13.920 --> 27:18.160]  looked into it because you know i have a mortgage and and and the
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.880]  you know fed fund rate went down and so i checked in they said they said oh
[27:22.880 --> 27:26.400]  you've got a six percent you've got a great deal even with decent credit mr
[27:26.400 --> 27:28.400]  jones you're going to be paying seven and a half
[27:28.400 --> 27:32.160]  yeah exactly so i mean people you know you think about it people are paying
[27:32.160 --> 27:34.720]  seven and a half percent for their mortgage they're seeing the price of gas
[27:34.720 --> 27:37.680]  go up because of hundred dollar oil prices they're seeing the price of food
[27:37.680 --> 27:40.320]  go up because of what's happening in the global food markets
[27:40.320 --> 27:43.360]  they're not getting a big increase in their in their take-home pay i mean
[27:43.360 --> 27:46.560]  that this is these are really really tough time for americans and and
[27:46.560 --> 27:49.440]  that's why i think there's really there's been a sort of con job done here
[27:49.440 --> 27:52.560]  really by the by the big wall street companies in collusion with the
[27:52.560 --> 27:55.440]  ratings agencies in collusion with the real estate well listen i want to come
[27:55.440 --> 27:58.160]  back and ask you just a few more questions we'll keep you about 40
[27:58.160 --> 28:02.320]  after the bigger thing now is we have the credit cards leveraged in coming
[28:02.320 --> 28:05.360]  due and it's simple when i was pouring in college
[28:05.360 --> 28:08.320]  i got a credit card every week in the mail i wasn't dumb enough to use them
[28:08.320 --> 28:12.320]  but now that i'm not insolvent i don't get credit cards in the mail
[28:12.320 --> 28:16.160]  but you know once or you know every you know two months uh that's all coming
[28:16.160 --> 28:18.880]  due now i mean this looks like it just gets worse and worse
[28:18.880 --> 28:22.800]  yeah i mean i think that the problem to the moment is that if you don't need
[28:22.800 --> 28:26.320]  credit you can get loads of it so if you wanted to have a credit card and you're
[28:26.320 --> 28:29.200]  on if you've got a load of equity in your house then you can get it easily but
[28:29.200 --> 28:32.320]  if you do need credit it's very hard to get hold of and very expensive
[28:32.320 --> 28:35.120]  and a lot of people and i mean what's really happened in the states i think
[28:35.120 --> 28:39.120]  over the last 15 years is that one bubble has been sold by creating another
[28:39.120 --> 28:42.320]  bubble so there was a dot-com bubble and that seemed like it was going to fizzle
[28:42.320 --> 28:45.360]  out and dallon greenspan responded to that by
[28:45.360 --> 28:48.720]  creating another even bigger bubble and now all the bubbles run out and that's
[28:48.720 --> 28:52.080]  that that that's where we are which is that all the bills are coming due
[28:52.080 --> 28:55.360]  did you see bush pick people up yeah i did see bush i mean i just thought it
[28:55.360 --> 28:59.600]  what he said was ridiculous really did you see him call it a bubble neck yeah
[28:59.600 --> 29:03.680]  yeah yeah i mean i think i think most
[29:03.680 --> 29:07.920]  ordinary americans were fine what he was saying to be ridiculous really it didn't
[29:07.920 --> 29:11.440]  bear no resemblance to what's happening he says everything's wonderful let them
[29:11.440 --> 29:14.000]  eat cake well it may be wonderful if you live
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.960]  living in the white house and you've got a big right standing crawford but i mean
[29:16.960 --> 29:21.120]  i'm not sure it's particularly wonderful in parts of our zone or in a
[29:21.120 --> 29:25.680]  well we saw the markets plunge after those two
[29:25.680 --> 29:28.160]  speeches people knew it was pure crap yeah
[29:28.160 --> 29:31.120]  stay there sir well just about five minutes on the other side i want to

[33:52.400 --> 33:55.280]  we've got some other really big guests coming up the next few weeks by the way
[33:55.280 --> 34:00.800]  it'll be surprises we always surprise you with a really big guest
[34:00.800 --> 34:04.160]  uh going back just about five minutes left with larry elliott he's also a
[34:04.160 --> 34:08.560]  very prominent best-selling author uh he's also of course the financial
[34:08.560 --> 34:12.960]  editor of the largest paper in england probably the main paper in europe
[34:12.960 --> 34:15.520]  uh no i've seen it everywhere when i'm a bit in europe
[34:15.520 --> 34:19.040]  and we are just honored to have him with us you really great
[34:19.040 --> 34:23.920]  reports uh accurate reports things that mesh with what i'm getting from all the
[34:23.920 --> 34:29.520]  economists and experts we have on and
[34:29.520 --> 34:35.520]  we'll have on all these different experts and they will
[34:35.520 --> 34:38.480]  you know talk about all these serious issues but then most the mainstream media
[34:38.480 --> 34:41.440]  doesn't uh larry why is it that so many
[34:41.440 --> 34:45.440]  you know big financial reporters and people don't want to really put out
[34:45.440 --> 34:48.640]  the hardcore news is that they don't want to rock the boat or it's too
[34:48.640 --> 34:51.040]  controversial or their sponsors are big
[34:51.040 --> 34:54.480]  brokerage firms why is that i really can't talk for any other
[34:54.480 --> 34:58.240]  journalists really i just i just write it as i see it i mean i may maybe
[34:58.240 --> 35:01.120]  the journalists are quite well paid and quite well often
[35:01.120 --> 35:04.080]  and don't really see see things as that as they are on the other side of the
[35:04.080 --> 35:06.880]  tracks or you know it may be that some of them
[35:06.880 --> 35:10.800]  are constrained by what they write because of the ownership of their
[35:10.800 --> 35:14.000]  paper i mean the guardian is is good in that we have complete editorial
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.320]  freedom to write exactly what we want we're not owned by a
[35:16.320 --> 35:19.440]  big proprietor we're owned by trust so we you know we
[35:19.440 --> 35:23.280]  we're allowed to just write what we think is is too inaccurate and that's what i
[35:23.280 --> 35:27.440]  try and do so um it's you know it's quite it's nice if people people want to
[35:27.440 --> 35:30.960]  hear what i've got to say but you know i understand that people have
[35:30.960 --> 35:34.560]  totally different views to mine some some people generally have well well let's
[35:34.560 --> 35:37.520]  talk about let's talk about it in just the last
[35:37.520 --> 35:41.600]  two minutes we've got your personal view on from studying history in the
[35:41.600 --> 35:45.280]  current economy where this is going and then other experts
[35:45.280 --> 35:48.160]  uh pretty much everybody agrees serious recession
[35:48.160 --> 35:52.880]  how deep will it get and then the big issue starting to come up is
[35:52.880 --> 35:57.680]  serious inflationary depression uh i mean give us your basic analysis
[35:57.680 --> 36:00.960]  well there's there's three there's three possibilities in my view one is that
[36:00.960 --> 36:04.720]  we just about get away with it with a quite serious
[36:04.720 --> 36:08.000]  recession that the action the federal reserve has taken this week and the
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.280]  money it's pumping into the system and the support has been given to
[36:11.280 --> 36:14.720]  to wall street banks and so on will eventually turn things around but
[36:14.720 --> 36:18.000]  but not for for quite a while i mean that's the first thing when i think
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.960]  that it's going to be a serious recession i mean house prices are falling
[36:20.960 --> 36:25.200]  across the u.s by around 20 percent a year which is the as far as i'm aware
[36:25.200 --> 36:28.880]  the biggest fall in house prices there's been certainly since 1930 so this is a
[36:28.880 --> 36:32.160]  really serious this is a really serious downturn so that
[36:32.160 --> 36:35.280]  even the baseline case is serious the second thing that could happen is that
[36:35.280 --> 36:38.480]  we could have a return of the 1970s a sort of stagflation
[36:38.480 --> 36:42.720]  that the allowing the dollar to fall is making imported food and fuel more
[36:42.720 --> 36:46.000]  expensive so you get a weak very weak period of the
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.600]  recession in the economy plus higher inflation which is really what the
[36:49.600 --> 36:54.160]  the sort of quite nasty message that we had the mess that we had in the 1970s
[36:54.160 --> 36:58.160]  and i think that would be that that could be prolonged and painful and about that
[36:58.160 --> 37:01.360]  seems to me to be a quite strong possibility and of course
[37:01.360 --> 37:04.560]  the final thing is this is this really the return of the big one i don't
[37:04.560 --> 37:08.000]  actually think there's any real evidence yet to say that it is the return of the
[37:08.000 --> 37:11.920]  big one partly because you know in the 1930s there was a much smaller state and
[37:11.920 --> 37:14.800]  the government will take up some of the slack in the economy
[37:14.800 --> 37:18.960]  but i mean the it it is a possibility that if the financial system really does
[37:18.960 --> 37:22.560]  melt down i mean if that happened if the financial system melted down
[37:22.560 --> 37:26.640]  and you saw really big falls in house prices more just prime loans started to
[37:26.640 --> 37:30.480]  go bad as well as subprime loans people started to get foreclosed on in a big
[37:30.480 --> 37:32.800]  way then of course you could you could be looking
[37:32.800 --> 37:36.800]  uh straight down the barrel of a 1930s experience but i would say that
[37:36.800 --> 37:40.800]  and you know i'd put a 50 50 or 60 percent chance on it being
[37:40.800 --> 37:45.360]  a really uh deep and serious recession about a 30 percent chance on a period of
[37:45.360 --> 37:48.960]  stagflation like we had in the 1970s and about a 10 percent chance of
[37:48.960 --> 37:53.360]  there being uh a return to the you know dreadful
[37:53.360 --> 37:57.040]  experience of the 1930s i mean that's that's a small but a non-negligible
[37:57.040 --> 38:00.880]  risk i would have said yeah it's like walking out your front door and having
[38:00.880 --> 38:03.040]  a 10 percent chance to get struck by lightning you would
[38:03.040 --> 38:06.160]  i i i that those those are just you know i mean it could be it could be different
[38:06.160 --> 38:10.800]  but i mean i i would say that the the the the the biggest risk is of is of a
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.160]  quite serious prolonged downside i think the u.s is already in recession and
[38:14.160 --> 38:17.600]  will remain in recession for a whole of two thousand a i mean i don't think this
[38:17.600 --> 38:20.320]  is going to be changed by the first tuesday in the
[38:20.320 --> 38:23.360]  in november that's by the time that when people choose the next person this is
[38:23.360 --> 38:27.600]  going to be larry ellie this is the big problem and i see
[38:27.600 --> 38:32.640]  the dollar cutting interest rates increasing spending all these wars
[38:32.640 --> 38:37.040]  trillions of dollars uh the war they now says cost almost two trillion
[38:37.040 --> 38:40.800]  uh that everybody's starting to leave the dollar uh there the government's doing
[38:40.800 --> 38:46.240]  everything to drive down the dollar so so i i see long term
[38:46.240 --> 38:49.760]  that more and more bubbles are going to be imploding and i see the depression
[38:49.760 --> 38:54.320]  50 percent chance well i mean you could be right i hope i'm i'm
[38:54.320 --> 38:57.600]  a bit more caution that but i mean uh i think that the the
[38:57.600 --> 39:01.280]  the foreign the value of the dollar is actually pretty serious because you know
[39:01.280 --> 39:05.120]  you at some point the u.s government is going to have to get together to have to
[39:05.120 --> 39:07.840]  drop its unilateral stance and get together with the other countries in
[39:07.840 --> 39:11.440]  the world and stop it happening because at the moment a lot of u.s
[39:11.440 --> 39:14.640]  banks are being bailed out by sovereign wealth funds of rich investors from
[39:14.640 --> 39:17.200]  overseas who are pumping their money into city
[39:17.200 --> 39:20.320]  group and all these other all these other companies and if they think that the
[39:20.320 --> 39:23.600]  dollar is going to go down in value and all their investments are going to be
[39:23.600 --> 39:25.680]  worthless they're going to stop doing that so they
[39:25.680 --> 39:28.880]  you can't have been denying the collectibles absolutely just allow it to
[39:28.880 --> 39:32.000]  fall and if that does happen and people start to pull their money out of the
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.960]  states in a really big way then you would you mean you really are looking at
[39:34.960 --> 39:39.520]  depression well larry elliot the financial editor for the
[39:39.520 --> 39:43.200]  london guardian uh just in closing tell me about the two books you've written
[39:43.200 --> 39:45.680]  in the new one coming out i read a book about
[39:45.680 --> 39:48.400]  how i thought this is all going to happen at ten years ago called the age of
[39:48.400 --> 39:51.760]  insecurity um and then i read a book about the the
[39:51.760 --> 39:55.200]  uk experience under tony blair called fantasy island which came out last year
[39:55.200 --> 39:57.840]  and we've got a new book coming out myself and my
[39:57.840 --> 40:02.000]  co-author dan ackerson in the summer called but the gods that failed and we
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.960]  the gods of the gods of the financial markets wall street and so on
[40:04.960 --> 40:08.000]  and how they completely screwed up the world and messed things up for ordinary
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.040]  people and what we should do about it so that's that's coming out this summer
[40:11.040 --> 40:14.480]  in the in the uk and it should be out in the u.s. sometime in the autumn i hope
[40:14.480 --> 40:18.320]  okay thank you for spending time with us sir okay that's great take care bye
[40:18.320 --> 40:24.000]  all right uh folks so there's the uh financial editor for the london guardian
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.680]  hedging his bet gave you a very conservative estimate of 10 chance of
[40:27.680 --> 40:33.280]  absolute war on the streets type depression uh and uh
[40:33.280 --> 40:37.200]  we're already in stagflation so he was giving that a 30 chance you were
[40:37.200 --> 40:41.520]  hearing massive hedging i guarantee you were drinking a beer with that guy to
[40:41.520 --> 40:44.320]  pub you'd hear oh yeah we're going into depression
[40:44.320 --> 40:48.640]  um now only politically admitting what we're going into could change that
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.920]  only admitting just how bad things are just how serious things are can turn
[40:53.920 --> 40:58.560]  this around okay this next story is personal for me and
[40:58.560 --> 41:02.160]  you're going to hear more about this in the days to come and weeks to come
[41:02.160 --> 41:07.120]  uh because i've only got a few more days to make sure that this doesn't happen
[41:07.120 --> 41:11.120]  uh and it gets into a lot of complex issues and
[41:11.120 --> 41:14.320]  that i want to flesh out because i know we all go through this experience
[41:14.320 --> 41:18.480]  ourselves it's like i know a cell phone is
[41:18.480 --> 41:22.880]  bad but i still use it just because it's so easy convenient and i'm so busy i
[41:22.880 --> 41:26.480]  work when i'm in the car driving home doing business taking care of things
[41:26.480 --> 41:31.360]  but i've cut that back about 95 percent i got cut down like 98 percent just
[41:31.360 --> 41:34.000]  just checking messages on it but i've been so busy lately i've been back on it
[41:34.000 --> 41:40.000]  i've caught myself back on it you're going what are you talking about alex
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.760]  well i know they're bad but i still use it well i know hospitals are pretty much
[41:43.760 --> 41:48.640]  bad but i also know statistically it's tough with a doula or a
[41:48.640 --> 41:54.320]  or a or one of these midwives and i know there can be problems and so we
[41:54.320 --> 41:57.120]  tried to have a baby the first time pretty much natural but he was over 10
[41:57.120 --> 42:02.000]  pounds and for a woman's first baby that's tough so the you know
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.640]  i've had all three of my children in the hospital
[42:04.640 --> 42:08.880]  and uh the doctors the nurses are good they're not bad people individually but
[42:08.880 --> 42:13.680]  the system and how it's set up is very evil
[42:13.680 --> 42:16.400]  and you're sitting there and they go we want to give them vaccines you go no
[42:16.400 --> 42:19.040]  and they say well we don't give our kids either but we were supposed to push
[42:19.040 --> 42:22.880]  you on and they come in look it's it's a mandate it's a state law
[42:22.880 --> 42:25.600]  and i knew it wasn't state law i knew it was all fraud but they're brainwashed
[42:25.600 --> 42:30.080]  idiots we just want the blood and we it's for a blood test and i said and i
[42:30.080 --> 42:34.960]  started telling them i said look um
[42:34.960 --> 42:37.680]  you know i'm just happy the baby's healthy whatever i've been through this
[42:37.680 --> 42:41.840]  three times i said look you may not know this but it's no law it's a health
[42:41.840 --> 42:45.360]  department mandate through the feds to the states
[42:45.360 --> 42:50.160]  it's based right here in texas you know the main center that organizes this
[42:50.160 --> 42:55.120]  in the u.s and then u.s canada australia new zealand
[42:55.120 --> 42:58.560]  england they're all involved now europe's involved but they're the oldest started
[42:58.560 --> 43:03.920]  35 years ago in the u.s and england it's been in australia for 30 plus years
[43:03.920 --> 43:07.920]  and i told them i said i said why don't you do blood test here for blood
[43:07.920 --> 43:10.880]  disorders and they said well we don't know but we're
[43:10.880 --> 43:15.280]  but we got to send this to the health department then more nurses come in
[43:15.280 --> 43:20.000]  and uh you know they say well you signed that form when you were admitted
[43:20.000 --> 43:23.520]  and i just i said you know what just go ahead and do it
[43:23.520 --> 43:27.120]  and i know it goes into the blood database i understand that
[43:27.120 --> 43:31.280]  it's all documented but
[43:32.320 --> 43:35.840]  but i just want parents to consciously think about this and read everything
[43:35.840 --> 43:38.480]  you sign on what you do and you got 45 days to
[43:38.480 --> 43:41.760]  to make them destroy it but it's come out that they don't
[43:41.760 --> 43:45.680]  now here's the issue that makes me mad i know it goes to a federal database
[43:45.680 --> 43:49.440]  and i know they use it to develop bio weapons drugs chemicals by the way i have
[43:49.440 --> 43:53.920]  mainstream news here that's all admitted was in the it's been in the news
[43:53.920 --> 43:57.040]  it's finally back in the news you tell the public this they just laugh at you
[43:57.040 --> 44:00.560]  they've been trained to be slaves and they admit bio weapons development
[44:00.560 --> 44:04.080]  genetic engineering companies they buy your kid's blood the government sells
[44:04.080 --> 44:07.600]  it it goes to the human genome the colesprings harvard
[44:07.600 --> 44:12.880]  genetic engineering facility uh it's all run by ugenesis the head of it just
[44:12.880 --> 44:15.360]  how to you know said black people basically aren't human
[44:15.360 --> 44:19.200]  and he was back running eugenics 60 years ago there i mean it's just it's
[44:19.200 --> 44:23.840]  they're nazis and it's just everywhere and it's criminal and
[44:23.840 --> 44:27.120]  they just do whatever they want
[44:27.280 --> 44:31.040]  uh and they'll tell you it's a law but it isn't a law but then if you tell them
[44:31.040 --> 44:33.760]  it's going to a dna database when it's on the government's own sites they'll
[44:33.760 --> 44:38.800]  laugh at you it's a program nation of cowardly mindless idiots
[44:38.800 --> 44:42.240]  and i guess myself included i'm like a sheep you think alex jones wouldn't be
[44:42.240 --> 44:44.720]  but you get tired fighting this 24 hours a day
[44:44.720 --> 44:48.000]  it's exhausting i spent two three hours last night just reading the other
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.720]  briefings from the supreme court on the second amendment
[44:50.720 --> 44:54.400]  that's just what you know the filings by the white house and others
[44:54.400 --> 44:57.760]  what a revelation there they say you have no right to own guns
[44:57.760 --> 45:02.160]  they say you have a right but they have the right to ban all of them
[45:02.160 --> 45:07.040]  which of course they don't i mean i could talk what do i cover what do i do
[45:07.040 --> 45:10.240]  what do i get into here
[45:10.480 --> 45:14.400]  they without asking you without anything go in there and suck blood out of your
[45:14.400 --> 45:17.360]  baby and then the reason i got mad last night
[45:17.360 --> 45:20.640]  is i knew it went into a international database and i knew it was for ugenics
[45:20.640 --> 45:24.480]  and the rest of it and that they say they own it and they patent proteins and
[45:24.480 --> 45:28.480]  different things in your own dna that's by the way in the mainstream news
[45:28.480 --> 45:31.520]  that i've gotten in front of me here
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.200]  again this is admitted yuppie he's driving along in your car saying this
[45:35.200 --> 45:38.880]  doesn't exist well maybe mad as i learned for the last
[45:38.880 --> 45:41.680]  five years it all goes to homeland security
[45:41.680 --> 45:45.440]  your child is enrolled in a fbi dna database
[45:45.440 --> 45:49.440]  through homeland security for five years with this now and that's what's new
[45:49.440 --> 45:54.080]  they didn't just have the samples and hey someday they might use it for that
[45:54.080 --> 45:58.080]  they are putting your children my babies too
[45:58.080 --> 46:04.240]  in an illegal database with the murdering scum that run homeland security
[46:04.240 --> 46:06.960]  i don't mean the average officer but the people that run it are the ones that
[46:06.960 --> 46:10.400]  carried out 911 they're the ones that take your blood illegally and put in
[46:10.400 --> 46:15.360]  illegal databases they are people playing god they
[46:15.360 --> 46:19.120]  do whatever they want they spray our cities they poison our water
[46:19.120 --> 46:21.920]  they're a bunch of nazis and i'm tired of it
[46:21.920 --> 46:26.320]  america isn't cameras in school bathrooms and and newborn babies
[46:26.320 --> 46:32.960]  in fbi dna databases they're criminals the government is bankrupt
[46:32.960 --> 46:38.960]  retro bait and gone now i'll tell you i do a cost benefit analysis statistically
[46:38.960 --> 46:44.240]  and i'm all for home bursts and all that but statistically
[46:44.240 --> 46:50.320]  um it's more dangerous at home physically for the baby now then
[46:50.320 --> 46:53.440]  statistically it's more dangerous in the hospital for cps to grab your kids
[46:53.440 --> 46:56.480]  but if you've got a little bit of money in our middle class and know your rights
[46:56.480 --> 46:59.760]  and or calm you'll be fine if you take welfare and try to have your
[46:59.760 --> 47:03.040]  kid in his hospital look out
[47:03.680 --> 47:06.880]  but i have to warn people and i have to talk about this i have to even talk
[47:06.880 --> 47:11.120]  about my private life because i care about you you understand that
[47:11.120 --> 47:13.840]  believe me i don't you ever hear me years ago talk about my private life
[47:13.840 --> 47:16.480]  you ever hear me talk about my children or how many i got or any of that
[47:16.480 --> 47:19.520]  now you do all the time because it's just i'm just letting it all
[47:19.520 --> 47:22.320]  be opened and that's just the way it is folks
[47:22.320 --> 47:25.920]  because if you're going to be free i'm going to be free and if i'm going to be
[47:25.920 --> 47:29.600]  free you got to be free i love you
[47:29.600 --> 47:34.720]  i care about your children as much as i care about mine did you understand that
[47:34.720 --> 47:39.840]  that's what it's supposed to be as a healthy tribal human
[47:39.840 --> 47:44.000]  it makes me sick that this is going on
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.040]  and it makes me sick that i don't have enough writers or staff or people that
[47:47.040 --> 47:51.440]  understand this or the time to even be able to do this or the money
[47:51.440 --> 47:54.800]  to to hire the people that understand this stuff to write articles and
[47:54.800 --> 47:58.560]  and show people their rights and i want to create legal centers showing people
[47:58.560 --> 48:02.160]  their rights and easily downloaded forms and we try to put it all together
[48:02.160 --> 48:06.320]  when we give you the vaccine waiver forms for 50 states and made a section
[48:06.320 --> 48:11.280]  and we're working i mean poll watching works 16 hours a day i work 16 hours a
[48:11.280 --> 48:13.760]  day most people at this office work eight hours 10
[48:13.760 --> 48:18.080]  hours erin works about 12 hours robber's about eight
[48:18.080 --> 48:22.000]  sometimes we work 14 15 18 20 sometimes we don't sleep
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.200]  we might you know while making a film there might be 10 15 nights we just
[48:25.200 --> 48:27.760]  don't sleep
[48:28.640 --> 48:31.360]  and then i want to spend time with my family i want to go out on a boat i want
[48:31.360 --> 48:35.680]  to go fishing and i can't i got to stay and do this
[48:35.680 --> 48:39.360]  i got to fight i can't i don't want to sit here and
[48:39.360 --> 48:43.280]  plug sponsors all day but i got to her i can't fund what i'm doing
[48:43.280 --> 48:46.560]  also i least i go out and get good sponsors i believe in unlike a lot of
[48:46.560 --> 48:49.920]  people things that i know are good i just you know
[48:49.920 --> 48:54.720]  there's a lot of give and take here nothing's perfect no one's i i just
[48:54.720 --> 48:58.800]  and you see here i am just ranting emotionally where i coldly last night
[48:58.800 --> 49:02.720]  for an hour and i had to choose i said i want to
[49:02.720 --> 49:06.480]  learn more about this dna illegal out of base i was learning even more last night
[49:06.480 --> 49:10.080]  and i said no i have to stop this and i had to think you know maybe i won't
[49:10.080 --> 49:13.120]  even go in the five days i've got left and stop
[49:13.120 --> 49:17.840]  them from putting her in the fbi database because
[49:17.840 --> 49:22.000]  because i've got to fight for the second amendment and i can i've only
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.440]  got limited things i can cover
[49:26.080 --> 49:29.680]  and so i literally will let my own family go
[49:29.680 --> 49:32.960]  by the wayside to a certain degree just to try to warn you you understand
[49:32.960 --> 49:37.840]  that's the position i'm in i mean i've got my head screwed on straight folks
[49:37.840 --> 49:43.520]  is your screwed on straight is your screwed on straight
[49:43.520 --> 49:47.760]  because that didn't freedom having your newborn babies put
[49:47.760 --> 49:50.480]  in government databases now it came out a year ago that england does the same
[49:50.480 --> 49:54.080]  thing remember three years ago and i want watson or nemo or
[49:54.080 --> 49:56.560]  somebody who got all these articles put them back together
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.560]  or maybe folks on the prison planet dot forum put it together nicely for me
[50:00.560 --> 50:04.000]  because i don't have the staff of the research actually i remember it all
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.280]  you know the european research the australian research i did this i did
[50:07.280 --> 50:10.480]  all this an hour last night on the u.s and the developments i have that in

[54:14.400 --> 54:17.920]  okay so here's a documentation
[54:17.920 --> 54:23.120]  i wish that i could fly into the sky i saw a story
[54:23.120 --> 54:28.240]  from op ed news great folks over there but then i linked through it all the
[54:28.240 --> 54:31.760]  mainstream documents and news stories in their article and it just reminded me
[54:31.760 --> 54:35.840]  and i read the story and the lady you know that they quote in there and the
[54:35.840 --> 54:39.840]  government documents they have in there and the stories they have don't
[54:39.840 --> 54:44.640]  again cover one tenth of what i know and i don't say that as i'm
[54:44.640 --> 54:49.120]  tooting my horn i'm saying it's much worse
[54:49.120 --> 54:52.880]  but then of the 10 percent though a lot of it was tough i didn't know
[54:52.880 --> 54:56.480]  and i didn't just believe it i went and tracked and googled and searched it and
[54:56.480 --> 55:00.400]  it was frankly what they taught me turned out to be much worse than what they
[55:00.400 --> 55:05.280]  even thought it's just from every angle and i got matter and
[55:05.280 --> 55:09.440]  matter but i only spent about an hour on this and
[55:09.440 --> 55:12.560]  you know only an hour on this that's a problem i have a giant stacks of things
[55:12.560 --> 55:16.720]  i spend hours on then i spend minutes here how many just like i start doing
[55:16.720 --> 55:20.240]  like a 10 hour radio show or something
[55:20.240 --> 55:27.440]  um states hand over dna of newborns to dhs op ed news
[55:27.440 --> 55:34.400]  and uh that's marty oakley and it goes into
[55:35.840 --> 55:39.280]  the fact that when they have links to the documents
[55:39.280 --> 55:43.200]  and where they are now putting it in an fbi database they're putting it in
[55:43.200 --> 55:48.000]  nationally in a ground database just like australia just like england started
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.560]  the last three years and we always said hey you're not just
[55:52.560 --> 55:56.560]  taking that blood of the health department we knew 30 plus years ago
[55:56.560 --> 56:00.480]  because they started storing it and we knew that they were using it
[56:00.480 --> 56:04.080]  but but see that's the thing now they're just openly yeah we're putting your kid
[56:04.080 --> 56:10.560]  into criminal database your newborn baby
[56:10.560 --> 56:14.160]  i was i got a newscast from cnn where they went to the house no one was armed
[56:14.160 --> 56:17.040]  no one resisted them they shot and killed the mother with the baby in her
[56:17.040 --> 56:20.880]  arms the bullet shot through the baby's shoulder in hand
[56:20.880 --> 56:24.480]  blowing its shoulder open cutting its fingers off killed the mother and then
[56:24.480 --> 56:27.760]  the cops got him said well we make mistakes and we didn't do anything
[56:27.760 --> 56:33.600]  wrong nobody's getting in trouble it's it's all just nuts we'll put cameras in
[56:33.600 --> 56:36.880]  your bathrooms we'll shoot your babies we'll uh
[56:36.880 --> 56:40.880]  we'll uh just you know the the baby deserves to be in a criminal database
[56:40.880 --> 56:45.520]  two-year-olds and criminal databases in england because of their quote genetics
[56:45.520 --> 56:48.640]  but they don't even do a genetic test they just say well we just say you're poor
[56:48.640 --> 56:55.600]  so you deserve it this is the type of news i've got
[56:55.600 --> 57:00.400]  and so i've got the combined written testimony submitted to the
[57:00.400 --> 57:07.360]  committee in minnesota i got the state legislature hearings on it

[1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:56.800]  it's the same social planners it's run by the same people the anglo-american
[1:00:56.800 --> 1:01:00.000]  establishment and the european establishments like
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.280]  the twin brother i mean it's almost the same but a
[1:01:03.280 --> 1:01:06.560]  little different worse in some cases not in others
[1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:09.680]  uh you know we're worse in some other areas than they are but it's pretty much
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:14.800]  the same system but i mean exactly the same with our five nations
[1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:17.520]  those are all really commonwealth under the queen of england we've been under
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:20.720]  that at least since 1913 back here in the u.s went into
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:25.280]  receivership but then in 33 they expanded with war powers act but they
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:28.480]  take your blood at any hospital in australia england
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:33.840]  u.s canada and many other areas those are the big five
[1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:37.040]  and they put it in a database they use it for genetic engineering and they say
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:40.880]  they own it and they patented and uh they're even talking about charging
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:44.480]  you later for your own genes for gene therapy i might talk about you bagging
[1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:48.240]  your own blood or cord blood for your child later if they need it
[1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:51.920]  with with uh the uh different uh types of
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:55.920]  cells the stem cells i'm talking about they take your
[1:01:55.920 --> 1:01:59.920]  baby's blood and they put in a database now they announced in england australia
[1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:04.160]  and now the u.s in the last three years that yeah it's going into a homeland
[1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:07.200]  security and in those countries scotland yard and the rest
[1:02:07.200 --> 1:02:11.840]  you your child's put in the government database now it's not put into the main
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:15.520]  index but it's entered in and prepared and ready
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:19.600]  no fourth amendment no nothing just criminal government doing what criminals
[1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:24.480]  do now two years ago
[1:02:24.480 --> 1:02:27.600]  i reported because google put a press release out
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:31.200]  that they were going to use cameras built into almost all new computers
[1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:33.920]  by almost i don't know if any computer doesn't have built into the screen or
[1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:38.880]  above it or beside it and microphones uh and people say well yeah that's just
[1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:43.120]  so you can do video conferencing yes but they are going to use it
[1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:49.440]  to watch you and listen to you and then have text ads and audio ads if a dog's
[1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:52.480]  barking they will send you dog food ads that
[1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:56.480]  was their their press release example and it's going to know what you're
[1:02:56.480 --> 1:02:59.520]  watching on television by the audio of it with keyword
[1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:05.200]  computers nsa type technology again the computer puts it into text and the
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:09.440]  google software which is really nsa and it's old generation stuff
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:13.040]  comes in now they're upgrading it comes in and scans it and so
[1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:16.640]  forget just cookies and tracking you on the computer this is your camera
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:20.320]  watching you we'll have repairmen around the
[1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:23.280]  office or people like that and they'll say hey why do you have a piece of tape
[1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:26.960]  over that camera on the computer and they'll kind of laugh at me and
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:29.920]  when i tell them because they can tune in and watch me
[1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:34.000]  oh they're watching you it doesn't matter if google puts out a press release
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.880]  it doesn't matter if they say they're already doing it uh
[1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:43.440]  comcast and this was covered by new tv a big industry blog but you can
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:49.280]  actually go to comcast announcing it comcast cameras to start watching you
[1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:53.120]  and this is going to be in the cable box now remember i told you 10 years ago

[1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:34.080]  the
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:57.320]  You know, very often, pretty much every day, we have guests on who've got so many letters
[1:08:57.320 --> 1:09:01.560]  behind their names and have done so many interesting things and written so many best-selling books
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:10.080]  and award-winning journals that I can't, you know, really give them a good bio here.
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:11.520]  We had him over about 30 minutes last week.
[1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:15.840]  He's with us for the rest of the hour today because it's an important subject, Aubrey
[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:18.400]  DeGray, Dr. Aubrey DeGray.
[1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:23.320]  And you know what, Doc, before we get into all this, it's best for you just to tell us
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:24.320]  about yourself.
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:28.000]  I know you don't like that, but instead of me just going over 20 pages of stuff, what
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.720]  do you think is most important for my listeners to know about you?
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:31.720]  Sure.
[1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:32.720]  I have no trouble doing that.
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:34.720]  Well, I'm a biologist.
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:40.280]  Specifically, I'm a biomedical gerontologist, which means that I'm interested in the biology
[1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:45.360]  of the aging process, but with a view to eventually being able to do something about
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:51.080]  aging, and in particular with a view to being able to defeat it completely in the future.
[1:09:51.080 --> 1:09:57.000]  I was originally a computer scientist, more of an engineer than a basic scientist, and
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:01.640]  one thing that has certainly helped me a lot in being able to make a contribution in my
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:08.440]  chosen field is that I have this sort of bipartite background in engineering training
[1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:12.960]  and also basic science training.
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:15.560]  Tell us about some of the books and journals you've written.
[1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:18.680]  Well, I have a book out that came out about six months ago.
[1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:24.120]  It's called Ending Aging, and it describes the technical details of how I think we're
[1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:27.680]  going to go about ending aging in the foreseeable future.
[1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:32.160]  I have written it very much for a general audience, so nobody who's listening should
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:33.680]  be scared of buying it.
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:37.160]  But at the same time, I don't really cut any corners on the science either.
[1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:41.920]  I go into as much detail as necessary to show that we really do know a great deal about
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:43.880]  how we're going to solve this problem.
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:49.960]  And you head up a foundation that's one of the preeminent groups out there trying to,
[1:10:49.960 --> 1:10:54.240]  I guess, think, take all this information together, but also fund some of the research.
[1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:55.240]  That's absolutely right.
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:11:01.280]  The foundation is called the Methuselah Foundation, and we solicit funds from the general public,
[1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:07.280]  which we then give out again to researchers to perform important critical path research
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:11.000]  in universities around the world so that we can hasten the defeat of aging.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.320]  You've got several sites.
[1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:15.280]  Which ones are important to plug?
[1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:21.400]  Well, it's all really within one site, mfoundation.org, but there are two main parts of the site.
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:26.640]  One of them is dealing with the actual research itself in a more abbreviated form, of course,
[1:11:26.640 --> 1:11:30.640]  than is present in the book, and talking about the particular research we're funding and
[1:11:30.640 --> 1:11:32.480]  what we'd like to fund in the future.
[1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:37.600]  The other part concentrates on our other main activity, which is the M-Prize, a prize competition
[1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:43.280]  that we run, which is simply intended to encourage researchers to try to break the world mouse
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:44.280]  lifespan record.
[1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:50.120]  And the purpose of that is because mice are sufficiently similar to humans that serious
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:56.200]  progress in postponing aging in mice is likely to have a foreseeable biomedical relevance
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:57.200]  to humans.
[1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:59.400]  And they're already living 50% longer.
[1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:02.080]  Well, that's not completely true.
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:08.160]  At the moment, we can get mice to live maybe 40% or 50% longer if we start really early,
[1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:09.160]  especially if we're all...
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:10.160]  But that's what I was saying.
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:11.160]  Yeah.
[1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:14.160]  If we alter some of their genes before they've even been conceived, so we alter the genes
[1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:15.160]  of their parents.
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:18.960]  But for those of us who have them misfortune to be already alive, the important thing,
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:24.680]  of course, is to develop therapies that can be begun in middle age and yet have some effect.
[1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:27.800]  See, I think that's where we got confused last time.
[1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:30.640]  I'd seen years ago, like 10 years ago studies.
[1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:36.160]  I'm sure you've seen them too, but I remember the details better than I do, but talking
[1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:41.040]  about just with diet mice living a lot longer, you're talking about separately genetically
[1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:42.040]  modified mice.
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:43.040]  That's right.
[1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:47.640]  I mean, so basically the genetic modifications that have been discovered so far that make
[1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:52.800]  big increases in the lifespan of mice are actually based on the same sort of science
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:58.320]  as the dietary interventions that were discovered a very long time ago, 70 or so years ago.
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:02.240]  Actually the genetic interventions trick the mouse into thinking that it's not getting
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:07.880]  enough food, and it responds by altering its metabolism in a way that has a side effect
[1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:10.680]  of slowing down its rate of aging.
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:15.040]  But the thing about that intervention, about the dietary intervention of just not feeding
[1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:19.680]  the mouse as much as before, is that unless you start it really pretty early in life,
[1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:21.840]  it doesn't really have much of an effect.
[1:13:21.840 --> 1:13:25.080]  If you start in middle age, it only very slightly increases the lifespan.
[1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:28.680]  When we covered that last time, I want to get into another area.
[1:13:28.680 --> 1:13:33.760]  There are those trees in the high desert areas of California that they think are thousands
[1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:36.680]  of years old, not just the big redwoods, but the smaller ones.
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:40.920]  And I remember reading in some studies long time ago in college that scientists think
[1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:46.440]  that it's brethren lower down that only live 200 years, but these trees are over a thousand
[1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:56.400]  years, is because it's very low water, very low temperatures at night, but also hot during
[1:13:56.400 --> 1:14:02.720]  the day, and is there some type of corollary in plant research to plants that are put under
[1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:03.720]  pressure?
[1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:09.840]  There is some, but we will be very unwise to read too much into it, in terms of its
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:12.160]  relevance to what we could do for ourselves.
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:16.440]  I understand, but why are those trees then up on those mountains living 10 times longer
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:18.320]  than their brethren down in the valley?
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:24.720]  Well, there are a variety of reasons, including simple erosion and the weather that you've
[1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:25.720]  mentioned.
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:29.760]  But the reason why we can't read much into it is because in a tree, the cells that are
[1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:34.240]  actually alive still on the surface of the trunk and in the leaves and so on are all
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:35.760]  continuously dividing.
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:41.200]  I mean not rapidly dividing, but there is not a single living cell in a tree that has
[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:44.080]  spent more than 20 or 30 years without dividing.
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:47.800]  But our brain, our eyes, all these key parts, they stop dividing?
[1:14:47.800 --> 1:14:51.800]  Absolutely, especially the brain and also the heart and one or two other tissues.
[1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:56.040]  And that's really important because a non-dividing cell has much harder problems to solve in
[1:14:56.040 --> 1:15:01.400]  terms of avoiding aging, avoiding the accumulation of damage than a dividing cell does.
[1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:07.880]  If a cell accumulates garbage, a material that is indigestible in some way, and it doesn't
[1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:12.800]  know how to get rid of it, but it divides, then that material is diluted out between
[1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:14.000]  the two cells.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:18.400]  So it can be kept at a constant level within any one cell, and that's an enormously powerful
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:20.680]  rejuvenating influence.
[1:15:20.680 --> 1:15:25.000]  And that also applies to mutations that accumulate in the DNA, for example, you can use selection
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.880]  to get rid of the cells that get the mutations.
[1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:34.200]  So the adoption of, well, the evolution of tissues that have long-lived, non-dividing
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:38.800]  cells, especially the brain, was really the point where we sold our cell to aging.
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:41.560]  And that's why we need biomedical technology to do something about it.
[1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:42.560]  Okay.
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:47.320]  I mean, putting it in layman's simple terms, and you've, again, he's got peer-reviewed
[1:15:47.320 --> 1:15:53.960]  studies, papers by major universities and medical institutions, and they're saying there's
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:57.400]  a lot of evidence, I mean, it's backed up scientifically.
[1:15:57.400 --> 1:16:02.560]  How are you saying that we now know that in the future we'll be able to put it off and
[1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:06.560]  then, as you said, last time you were on, then if we can put it off in the 30, 40, 50 years,
[1:16:06.560 --> 1:16:07.560]  there'll be more advances.
[1:16:07.560 --> 1:16:09.000]  Then we know the development.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:10.160]  I mean, what is proven?
[1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:13.040]  I mean, how do we know you'll be able to do this?
[1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:17.400]  Ultimately, we know it simply because we know that the human body is a machine.
[1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:19.160]  That's really all it comes down to.
[1:16:19.160 --> 1:16:21.320]  We don't know how soon we're going to be able to do it.
[1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:26.120]  I think we have a 50% chance of getting there within, let's say, 30 or 30 years, but we
[1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:29.920]  certainly don't know how long it's going to take, and that's because we don't know enough
[1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:36.000]  about the obstacles that we may encounter going forward, but at the moment, we can describe
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:41.280]  in quite a lot of detail all the various types of damage that the body accumulates as side
[1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:46.160]  effects of its normal operation, molecular and cellular changes throughout life that
[1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:50.520]  start even from before we're born, and that are initially harmless, just in the same way
[1:16:50.520 --> 1:16:54.760]  that it's okay to have a little bit of garbage in your house, but that eventually when they
[1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:58.640]  get too abundant, they start to cause real damage.
[1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:05.080]  We need to repair those various types of damage, those molecular and cellular changes, and
[1:17:05.080 --> 1:17:11.200]  since we can already describe what those types of change are, we can look quite closely at
[1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:16.680]  how we might get rid of them, and my reason for optimism is that we can describe, not
[1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:21.640]  just in general terms, but in a lot of detail, exactly what we need to do, and in some cases
[1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:26.000]  we're pretty close to already being able to do it, to reverse those various changes.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:31.280]  I mean, continue, give me some examples of what we currently know that is working.
[1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:32.280]  Okay, sure.
[1:17:32.280 --> 1:17:39.680]  So in, so one very well-known area of biomedical research is of course stem cell research,
[1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:42.760]  and here I don't just mean embryonic stem cell research, I mean stem cell research in
[1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:43.760]  general.
[1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:45.920]  Yeah, it's in the female breast, it's in fat, yeah.
[1:17:45.920 --> 1:17:50.240]  Yeah, stem cells come from a lot of places, that's right, and we're getting pretty good
[1:17:50.240 --> 1:17:54.480]  at manipulating cells, so that they are the right sort of stem cell.
[1:17:54.480 --> 1:17:58.880]  Now the reason why stem cells are important is because one of the changes that happened
[1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:04.440]  during throughout life is that some of our tissues, especially some parts of the brain
[1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:10.240]  and also the heart and one of the other places, self-die, and they are not naturally replaced
[1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:15.400]  by the division of other cells, so we have to help the body out by putting in new cells
[1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:20.320]  ourselves by medical treatment, so as to maintain these various tissues.
[1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:24.200]  Well that's just like if somebody, and they've seen some success, you probably know more
[1:18:24.200 --> 1:18:28.760]  about all the hundreds of studies, but you know with somebody with Parkinson's, you know
[1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:34.280]  putting brain cells, and they can now culture these in there, and then the body is absorbing
[1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:35.280]  them and using them.
[1:18:35.280 --> 1:18:36.280]  That's exactly right.
[1:18:36.280 --> 1:18:41.000]  Parkinson's disease turns out to be one of the easier applications of stem cell therapies
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:47.400]  because the part of the brain where the cells die is a very well-defined localized one.
[1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:49.440]  Okay, so then...
[1:18:49.440 --> 1:18:53.360]  But what's amazing is the brain is actually using the new cells, that's incredible, I mean
[1:18:53.360 --> 1:18:56.080]  that's a big step towards what you're saying, isn't it?
[1:18:56.080 --> 1:19:00.840]  Oh yes, absolutely, and the reason why these things aren't so hard as they might look is
[1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:07.400]  because the information that the cells need in order to know what to do when you put them
[1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:11.600]  into the brain is already encoded in those cells, so long as they are more or less in
[1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:16.080]  the right state, they will take cues from their environment in just the same way really
[1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:19.120]  as the cells did when the brain was being built in the first place.
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:22.400]  It's like the rest of the brain is a drill sergeant that tells them line up?
[1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:26.320]  Well, do an approximation, yes, that's right.
[1:19:26.320 --> 1:19:29.000]  Just simplification here, because this is complex stuff.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.560]  We'll be right back with our guest for this quick break.
[1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:36.520]  Best-selling author, multiple doctorates, you can go read his bio, you've got five hours.
[1:19:36.520 --> 1:19:42.160]  Aubrey de Grey will be right back on the other side of this quick break, infowarrows.com,
[1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:54.880]  it is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:59.600]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:05.440]  It's known as the Builderburg, but their objective being world domination.
[1:20:05.440 --> 1:20:08.600]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:08.600 --> 1:20:13.600]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:19.000]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:28.320]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:20:28.320 --> 1:20:30.960]  Builderburg is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:34.120]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:36.320]  they're after power, that's their appellation.

[1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:54.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention, Ron Paul did not quit.
[1:20:54.040 --> 1:20:55.600]  He is still in the race.
[1:20:55.600 --> 1:20:59.120]  Most Americans do not understand how the election process works.
[1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:00.520]  The media is lying.
[1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:03.560]  John McCain does not have the Republican nomination.
[1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:06.680]  The popular vote is just a straw poll, believe it or not.
[1:21:06.680 --> 1:21:10.380]  The delegates have the power over the elections, not the voters.
[1:21:10.380 --> 1:21:14.200]  After the mainstream media wrote a hit piece on how Ron Paul quit, many supporters quit
[1:21:14.200 --> 1:21:15.200]  as well.
[1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:19.920]  Ron Paul has stated he will continue his run for presidency as long as he has your continued
[1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:20.920]  support.
[1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:21.920]  Ron Paul has a plan.
[1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:26.560]  The delegates have not yet been voted on, and they are voted first in county, then state,
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:28.640]  all the way to the national convention.
[1:21:28.640 --> 1:21:33.720]  Go to our website at RonPaulFlags.com and click on why Ron Paul will win.

[1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:38.520]  Stand your ground.
[1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:45.440]  Go for the win and fly a Ron Paul flag today, or call 731-664-1526 for more information.
[1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:49.720]  That's 731-664-1526.
[1:21:49.720 --> 1:21:51.720]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[1:21:51.720 --> 1:21:56.240]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest
[1:21:56.240 --> 1:21:57.760]  hour there is hope.
[1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:00.880]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:05.120]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:06.680]  World Order master plan.
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:10.960]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[1:22:50.440 --> 1:22:54.920]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, radical changes need to be implemented if we're
[1:22:54.920 --> 1:22:57.300]  to avert becoming a third world nation.
[1:22:57.300 --> 1:23:01.160]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical, natural alternative health

[1:23:20.680 --> 1:23:23.240]  energy savings of up to 25%.
[1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:27.000]  The possible uses for this device are only limited by your imagination.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:31.440]  For less than the cost of a doctor's visit, you can, have in your hands, a device that
[1:23:31.440 --> 1:23:33.920]  could lead to the end of all your problems.
[1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:36.560]  Health does not need to be expensive or complicated.

[1:24:08.080 --> 1:24:13.560]  We're going to talk about some of the genetic manipulations going on, some of the injection
[1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:21.000]  of stem cells, currently the treatments, and then what the research and some of the advanced
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.080]  stuff that's on the horizon that's being developed.
[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:26.920]  And then we'll talk about the social ramifications and even have some time near the end of this
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:34.040]  hour to take some calls with our guest at 1-800-259-9231.
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:37.440]  Going back to Dr. Aubrey DeGray, please continue.
[1:24:37.440 --> 1:24:43.600]  Okay, so one other area that's very, very important to combating aging and that is really
[1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:49.480]  moving forward very nicely is in the combating of one aspect of Alzheimer's disease.
[1:24:49.480 --> 1:24:53.760]  So Alzheimer's disease, as you may know, is a very complicated phenomenon in which, first
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:57.400]  of all, you have got cell death, very much like in Parkinson's disease, but more distributed
[1:24:57.400 --> 1:24:58.400]  around the brain.
[1:24:58.400 --> 1:25:02.400]  But also, you've got the accumulation of various types of indigestible molecule inside
[1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:04.720]  the neurons and outside the neurons.
[1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:08.840]  And the stuff that accumulates outside the neurons, which is called phenyl plaques, is
[1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:13.240]  believed by a lot of people to be a really major player in the progression of Alzheimer's
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:14.240]  disease.
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:19.000]  So about 10 years ago, a trick was found in mice so that you could actually vaccinate
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:20.120]  against this stuff.
[1:25:20.120 --> 1:25:25.560]  You could get certain cells in the brain called microglia to essentially swallow these chunks
[1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:30.080]  of material that were sitting around in the spaces between cells, and they would be able
[1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:32.360]  to destroy it once it was inside the cells.
[1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:36.640]  So that treatment was so effective in mice that it's already moved to clinical trials
[1:25:36.640 --> 1:25:39.080]  and the clinical trials are going very well.
[1:25:39.080 --> 1:25:46.560]  The phase three clinical trial for final stage has just begun, so that's going nicely.
[1:25:46.560 --> 1:25:48.480]  Other areas, other things that are being developed?
[1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:52.120]  Well, the ones I've mentioned so far are probably the ones that are furthest along.
[1:25:52.120 --> 1:25:56.600]  If we look at things that are not quite so far along but are still going pretty nicely,
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:26:03.240]  one example is the accumulation of really, really difficult to break down things that
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:05.680]  are inside cells already.
[1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:12.640]  For example, various molecules similar to cholesterol that are inside cells in the wall
[1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:14.280]  of our arteries.
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:17.800]  Cholesterol itself is not really a harmful molecule because our cells know how to deal
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:22.280]  with it, but it gets spontaneously modified into forms that our cells don't know how to
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:23.720]  deal with.
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:29.240]  And those forms accumulate and eventually stop the cells in our artery walls from working
[1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:33.000]  and that's where an atherosclerotic blood comes from, that's where heart disease and
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.240]  heart attacks and strokes come from.
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:40.960]  So there's progress going on at the moment, actually a lot of it funded by my foundation
[1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:46.960]  that is looking to identify bacteria in the soil that can break down these things and then
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:51.080]  to identify the genes that they have that allow them to break down these things.
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:55.320]  The idea here is that when we find those genes, we can modify them in some fairly obvious ways
[1:26:55.320 --> 1:27:00.080]  and introduce them into our own cells so as to give them a greater versatility in the
[1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:01.720]  range of things that they can break down.
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:05.560]  So that's a pretty ambitious idea, it will take quite a long time to get to work, but
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:11.080]  when it does work, it will be by far the most effective way to address heart disease and
[1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:16.520]  also various other things like macular degeneration, for example, far more effective than anything
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:17.520]  we have today.
[1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:24.960]  Now, that's just one body of science, isn't it, that fits in as a unit into the larger
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:26.200]  plan that you've devised?
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:27.200]  That's right, yes.
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:32.320]  So I normally describe the range of things that need to be developed and done as breaking
[1:27:32.320 --> 1:27:34.120]  down into seven different categories.
[1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:40.400]  And so I just mentioned that atherosclerosis and macular degeneration are both within one
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:41.400]  category.
[1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:46.280]  That's because the general approach to fixing those two problems is broadly similar.
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:49.760]  It's not exactly similar, though, we have to find different enzymes to break down different
[1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:55.560]  target compounds, but the general approach to finding those enzymes is more or less the
[1:27:55.560 --> 1:27:56.560]  same.
[1:27:56.560 --> 1:28:07.200]  Now, guesstimation, how far along are we until somebody who's say 50 years old can live comfortably
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:10.880]  to 150, or are you saying we're already at that point?
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:17.640]  I think that we have a 50% chance of developing the technologies I'm talking about here within
[1:28:17.640 --> 1:28:19.760]  about 25 or 30 years.
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:24.520]  And the technologies we have at that point should, in my view, be sufficient that we can
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:28.720]  take someone who's, let's say, 60 years old at that point, in other words, let's say 30
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:34.120]  years old now, and give them an extra 30 or so years of healthy life.
[1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:38.160]  In other words, essentially rejuvenate them, not completely, not totally comprehensively
[1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:42.880]  back to a 20-year-old, for example, but maybe back to the age of 40, a biological age of
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:48.920]  40, such that they'll be maybe 90 years old before they get back to being biologically
[1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:50.120]  60.
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:55.360]  And during that time, those 30 years, the therapies will have been improved in terms
[1:28:55.360 --> 1:28:59.040]  of their comprehensiveness, so that we can apply them again, the improved therapies to
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:04.400]  the same people who are now 90, and we rejuvenate them back to, let's say, biologically 30 and
[1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:05.400]  so on.
[1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:09.360]  You know, I am a Christian, and I'm proud of my faith, but I don't like the quacks and
[1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:15.080]  kooks that take it and do a lot of weird things, whether even other groups, saying that even
[1:29:15.080 --> 1:29:19.440]  trying to extend life is impossible, saying folks that said we never fly, you know, that
[1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:22.120]  we never have airplanes, we never have computers.
[1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:29.400]  I don't know how religiously it got to become a dogba that life extension doesn't exist
[1:29:29.400 --> 1:29:31.680]  or is a lie or is of the devil.
[1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:37.120]  So I wanted to kind of get into the social ramifications of this on the other side.
[1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:40.960]  I mean, if you don't die, how do you go to heaven or hell?
[1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:44.640]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:50.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:55.000]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:59.800]  alkaline environment, but as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic
[1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:01.960]  diet and lack of exercise.
[1:30:01.960 --> 1:30:06.120]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention
[1:30:06.120 --> 1:30:07.320]  of disease.
[1:30:07.320 --> 1:30:11.920]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and
[1:30:11.920 --> 1:30:13.000]  loss of weight.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:17.640]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most
[1:30:17.640 --> 1:30:19.240]  people are overly acidic.
[1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:23.160]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[1:30:23.160 --> 1:30:27.440]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[1:30:27.440 --> 1:30:28.440]  it.
[1:30:28.440 --> 1:30:30.520]  Being able toKorean periodic rules Or to know what your body is.
[1:30:30.520 --> 1:30:32.520]  Whether you drink alkaline water or how to oppose your body quality, or vegetables while
[1:30:32.520 --> 1:30:34.340]  you have aife with the foods of�
[1:30:34.340 --> 1:30:37.040]  and père to you, whatever you drink, it is Biden's turn now!
[1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:39.520]  If you happen to need dissolved juice and a cold drink on a diet with alkaline water,
[1:30:39.520 --> 1:30:41.040]  adjust票 for your health.

[1:32:49.660 --> 1:33:12.620]  I hear the train coming, it's rolling around the bed, and I ain't seen the sun shine since I don't know when, I'm stuck in holes in prison, and time keeps dragging on.
[1:33:12.620 --> 1:33:20.260]  But that train keeps rolling on down the saddle.
[1:33:20.260 --> 1:33:44.820]  I don't know if we'll be able to ever, quote, live a thousand years, but I know certainly with technology, people will be able to live a lot longer, there's no doubt of that, will we still be human, and that gets into the whole transhumanist, post-humanist discussion, and I think a lot of what you're talking about borders into that, but you're talking about the admitted technologies that can extend, that are being developed.
[1:33:44.820 --> 1:34:14.260]  But what about people who have trouble dealing with this? In my last film, I quote, futurist, saying, we'll have world government, and we can't let the general public have this stuff, and we're going to get rid of them, and that's in Wired Magazine, Kurzweil's talking about it, I mean, this is all being discussed, and how only the rich are going to be able to have it, and the suicide nihilist will basically turn into spaceships and fly off the planet and blow us up.
[1:34:14.260 --> 1:34:43.380]  I mean, these guys sound nuts, and they're getting huge prizes and money, and they're inventing computer technology, and they're billionaires, so people tend to listen to Bill Joy and others, and he's a good guy, saying he goes to meetings with 200 elitists, and they're talking about all this, so certainly there's a science fiction element to it, but what was science fiction 50 years ago is reality today in so many cases, so my point is, how do you weigh the extremist on one end who are running around saying, we're going to live forever next week
[1:34:43.380 --> 1:34:47.500]  with the people that say it's of the devil to even have a pacemaker?
[1:34:47.500 --> 1:35:01.900]  It's much easier than you would think, actually, because ultimately, all of what I'm talking about evolves around alleviating the suffering that most of us have to look forward to when we get older, and that's an awful lot of suffering, as we all know.
[1:35:01.900 --> 1:35:18.420]  If we find really comprehensive treatment to all of the various things that go wrong with our bodies in later life, then people are going to welcome those things, and that just happens that there's going to be this side effect that we won't tend to die in our sleep anymore.
[1:35:18.420 --> 1:35:28.300]  We will tend to wake up the following morning, and the morning after that, and the morning after that, but it should be regarded as a side benefit, not as the main goal, to live longer for the sake of living longer.
[1:35:28.300 --> 1:35:42.300]  And I think when you talk about it and you think about it that way, the idea that there might be any religious objection to it becomes a good deal, you know, hardest to defend.
[1:35:42.300 --> 1:35:50.900]  I mean, I've just had other guests on like yourself. I've mentioned this in a film, and I've gotten criticism saying, I'm basically a devil for even talking about it, but I mean, how could you not talk about it?
[1:35:50.900 --> 1:36:13.500]  I mean, I remember when I had great-grandparents and grandparents dying when I was a kid, I thought, man, I don't want to watch my parents die. That's when I very young began to think about not even that I was going to get old or die myself, because I was so young, I thought I'd live forever, you know, that bulletproof attitude, but I don't want these people I love to die, so I mean, I don't think it's evil to discuss these things.
[1:36:13.500 --> 1:36:23.900]  Exactly, and they probably didn't want to die either. Even people who are getting quite frail and sick probably don't want to die immediately, and certainly people who are youthful mostly don't seem to want to die anytime soon.
[1:36:23.900 --> 1:36:43.200]  And the question therefore is, how do we arrange to maximize the ability of people to live as long as they want to and to stay healthy as long as they want to? It seems to me that the message from Scripture is very clear there, for example, that we're supposed to do our best to alleviate suffering and to save lives.
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:37:01.000]  And one can't argue that extending lives is in any way different from saving lives, because ultimately we agree that old people are people too, and so if we reject ageism, then we have to agree that things that kill old people are just as bad as things that kill young people.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:27.400]  Well, I certainly have a good point there. My whole concern is that these systems to extend our lives are leaning towards the cybernetic merging with all the genetic engineers, kind of like the whole, well, there's the whole replicant view of Blade Runner, where it's pure biological, designed by machines and humans, versus the cybernetic cyborg merger.
[1:37:27.400 --> 1:37:40.400]  And I just see it leaning more and more towards the cybernetic, and then even on the genetic. I mean, really, once you get into machines and genetics, it's pretty, at least from my novice view, similar in that it's all just programming and setting things up.
[1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:55.600]  So as we begin to play God, I see this erasing a lot of what we were. Now, the transhumanists say that that will actually make us something more human than human. Can you comment on that?
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:38:12.600]  Yeah, I think that it is important not to be too scared about the future decisions that humanity will make sequentially in determining whether to, whether to adopt certain opportunities for progress, because after all, there are plenty of times when we choose not to.
[1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:30.600]  For example, we had a very rapid and successful and enthusiastic advance with regard to powered flight during the first two thirds or so of the last century. But then, what happened? Why do we not have our flying cars now? The answer is not because we couldn't, but because we couldn't be bothered.
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:46.600]  You know, there wasn't enough pressure for them. And similarly, these biomedical advances that may have the opportunity to merge with nonbiological advances will only actually merge with them if the general public aren't enthusiastic about that and they can see some benefits.
[1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:48.600]  Otherwise, the technology just won't be developed.
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:39:01.600]  Well, I happen to love humanity and my heritage and my ancestors and God's creation. I mean, I don't want to fundamentally, I'm all for pacemakers, I'm all for somebody's having seizures to, you know, have a chip put in there.
[1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:15.600]  The problem is, every time I turn around, I mean, there's a big controversy right now. England, the U.S., they take baby's blood, they put it in a DNA database and now they want to use it for law enforcement and they don't tell the soccer moms down in the street that this is going on.
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:23.600]  And we have the eugenics, we have the former head of the Cold Springs Harbor back when it was a eugenics operations, basically saying blacks are inferior.
[1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:35.600]  I mean, we have such a, the bedrock of what is the modern intelligentsia was built on this elitism. And you can say long term, everybody's going to demand these technologies for themselves.
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:45.600]  But in reality with resources, and the elite tend to do this even when there are enough resources, they like to control the resources as a mode of domination.
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:58.600]  And down every avenue I see, I see the haves and the have-nots, you know, I mean, oh, I'm rich, I don't get cancer. You know, I was, I was gently engineered, but, you know, you're a poor person, you're going to get cancer.
[1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:05.600]  I think there's a good answer to that, a very persuasive answer to that prospect and reason why we shouldn't, we don't need to be worrying about it.
[1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:19.600]  Which is simply that the reason why we see inequality of access to important things at the moment is because there is not enough desire on the part of the general public, the less wealthy people, to actually get those things.
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:32.600]  If we look at things that really are very important to everybody, then they are available when, and the ability to pay is found. Like, for example, basic education is available for free in every country in the western world.
[1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:41.600]  And the reason it's free is because there's a general agreement among the population that it's important enough that it ought to be free. I think it's going to be like that.
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:53.600]  I think at the moment the medical treatments that we have just aren't effective enough and therefore aren't important enough to drive that sense of there being a fundamental human right to the point where they're free.
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:59.600]  I mean, everything's growing exponentially. I think sooner than 30 years, a lot of things you're talking about are going to start happening.
[1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:10.600]  Mexican Attorney General, four years ago, made a bunch of his employees taking planable chips. Companies are making employees. I've had police chiefs on from the U.S. saying they would forcibly inject us with chips because it's for our own good.
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:26.600]  Bars make you have it to go into the topless section. All of this is happening. They're just integrating it. And so that's the problem I see is that things like this are going to be forced on people and it's going to be sold as a medical treatment.
[1:41:26.600 --> 1:41:33.600]  Well, we've got to take care of you. We've got all these government paid for clinics with your tax money and then really these will be systems of control.
[1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:40.600]  I really can't see us chaining people down and rejuvenating them by force. It just doesn't seem very ploy...
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:51.600]  See, but I'm not talking about your... I don't want to say narrow. It's a very wide area, but comparatively, it's narrow. I'm not talking about what you're doing or how you see this ship you're captaining where it's going.
[1:41:51.600 --> 1:42:08.600]  I'm talking about your vision, which I think has a lot of reality to it. I mean, from my own layman's perspective, what I'm saying is that I look at a lot of the other genetic engineer people, a lot of the other people in biology, a lot of the other people, and they are really a bunch of freaks.
[1:42:08.600 --> 1:42:18.600]  And I'm sure you know about a lot of your colleagues. I mean, a lot of them are eugenicists, crypto eugenicists, population reduction enthusiasts, a lot of them are control freaks.
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:29.600]  They're being hired out by the defense establishment. I mean, I've got CBS news pieces where they're saying they're going to put ships in the prisoners' brains soon and rehabilitate them with programming.
[1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:31.600]  I mean, that's enslavement, isn't it?
[1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:38.600]  It sounds pretty much like enslavement to me, but I haven't thought about it or studied it at all. I'd rather stick to my own narrow area.
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:52.600]  Well, I mean, by narrow, it's a wide area, but you have the narrow view that because you're a good guy, you're not doing it for bad. It won't be used for bad. I'm just saying, just like we don't have a big debate about life extension, which we should have because it'll make people desire it and then we will get it.
[1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:59.600]  Well, at the same time, when we need a bigger debate about this to make sure it's developed in the right direction instead of being used for bad.
[1:42:59.600 --> 1:43:00.600]  I agree with that.
[1:43:00.600 --> 1:43:02.600]  So how do we do that?
[1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:09.600]  Do we have a big debate? Well, actually, I think progress in going with debate going on life extension may be a good start.
[1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:21.600]  I think a lot of what we've seen in society over the past few decades is really important problems appearing that affect all of us, things like climate change or the ozone layer or whatever.
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:28.600]  And sometimes we develop technological or other solutions that are just in time to stop the mattering, but we're very slow about it.
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:33.600]  And I think a large part of why we're slow is apathy that we don't think. Most of us don't think we can do anything.
[1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:43.600]  And that's, of course, true at the level of democratic influence over what the state does in a whole range of ways.
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:56.600]  So I would say that any progress that we may make in addressing and confronting our oldest foe, namely aging, may actually have a certain amount of role in empowering us, so to speak,
[1:43:56.600 --> 1:44:03.600]  and making us aim a bit higher in terms of our ability to control other things and to make sure that technology is used for the good.
[1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:05.600]  But I see the opposite happening.
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:12.600]  I see the general public completely drunk on entertainment, totally tuning out of reality, the elite providing them,
[1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:19.600]  and it also makes money in the free market with new forms of wire head type cyberpunk distractions,
[1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:26.600]  literally a acquiescence, a self-insertion into a matrix like system.
[1:44:26.600 --> 1:44:30.600]  I really see it inexorably leading towards that.
[1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:33.600]  Well, that's right. That's what I'm saying. This is the apathy I'm talking about.
[1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:41.600]  And I think that that apathy may actually be very strongly diminished once we start to make breakthroughs against this thing that we're also scared of.
[1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:51.600]  Well, I want to take some phone calls to get different angles and perspectives from listeners at 1-800-259-9231,
[1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:57.600]  and we're talking to Dr. Aubrey DeGray and fire out the website again, sir.
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:44:59.600]  Mfoundation.org.
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:03.600]  And we've got links to that up on infowars.com right now.
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:07.600]  Let's go to Merritt in Kentucky. You're on the air, Merritt.
[1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:08.600]  Hi, how are you doing?
[1:45:08.600 --> 1:45:09.600]  Good, sir.
[1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:10.600]  Hello.
[1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:17.600]  Dr. DeGray, I was studying this subject probably a little over a year ago.
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:25.600]  And I was wondering, is, you know, cellular degeneration, is it still being linked to something like oxidation?
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:33.600]  Certainly, yes. Oxidation is a damaging, it's a term that covers a wide range of damaging chemical reactions.
[1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:38.600]  Unfortunately, it also covers a wide range of important and very desirable chemical reactions.
[1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:48.600]  And a large part of the reason why the early attempts to try to control and postpone aging by diminishing the level of oxidation reactions
[1:45:48.600 --> 1:45:53.600]  and the level of the products of those reactions is because of the side effects,
[1:45:53.600 --> 1:45:57.600]  because one was diminishing the things that we wanted to have as well as the things we didn't want to have.
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:04.600]  So that's actually one of the sorts of data that led me to the approach that I tend to follow with regard to combating aging,
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:12.600]  namely to target specifically the undesirable products of things like oxidation rather than targeting the process itself.
[1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:17.600]  It tends to be a good deal more capable of avoiding those sorts of side effects.
[1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:20.600]  And what about telomeres? Are you...?
[1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:28.600]  All right, so the idea that telomere shortening is the dominant influence on the rate of aging is the number one urban myth about aging.
[1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:35.600]  Telomere shortening may have something to do with aging of some very limited tissues,
[1:46:35.600 --> 1:46:42.600]  and it certainly appears to have a role as a sort of ancillary side effect of certain other disease states.
[1:46:42.600 --> 1:46:50.600]  But in general, the cells that we have that need to divide a lot more than they could in some culture,
[1:46:50.600 --> 1:46:55.600]  they're able to do so because they express a sufficient amount of this enzyme called telomerase
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:46:59.600]  that compensates for the telomere shortening that happens when a cell divides.
[1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:03.600]  So the cells in which one observes this thing called the Haiflich limit,
[1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:11.600]  this finite amount of abilities to divide, are cells that, when they're in the body, just don't need to divide very often.
[1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:21.600]  Well, as far as the ethics angle on this, I think if we maintain our honorable intentions behind it,
[1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:29.600]  I think it's a very good technology, but a lot of the socio-political issues that are going around today have to be fixed
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:31.600]  before we actually get into the maze of this thing, I think.
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:34.600]  I think that's right, and so the question is, what do we do?
[1:47:34.600 --> 1:47:40.600]  Do we say, let's slow down the development of the technology until we're satisfied that we know what the first logical solutions are going to be,
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:45.600]  or should we go and develop the technology as soon as possible, but also, and parallel,
[1:47:45.600 --> 1:47:50.600]  do our best to come up with a forward plan in terms of the first logical implications?
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:54.600]  I think that second approach is the best way to go, because ultimately, every day we delay,
[1:47:54.600 --> 1:48:00.600]  we are condemning another 100,000 people to an unnecessarily early death, and that's pretty bad.
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:04.600]  But again, you're willing to give everybody more life.
[1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:08.600]  Now, commerce is the goal of the Tyrell Corporation, that's the line from Blade Runner,
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:16.600]  but at the same time, so many of the elite think tanks and powerful organs think there's too many people
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:23.600]  and have an absolute disgust for humanity, and all they talk about is culling the herd, as Prince Philip likes to do.
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:28.600]  Well, all I can say is that if there are people who want to reduce the size of the human population,
[1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:31.600]  they don't seem to be doing very well.
[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:36.600]  Well, they have reduced the growth, mightily, in China and in Africa and other places.
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:38.600]  I think most of the reduction of growth has happened voluntarily.
[1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:43.600]  Certainly, China is an exception, but in every other country around the world in which there's been a sharp decline
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:46.600]  in the number of children that the average woman is having.
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:48.600]  Well, I don't think infertility is voluntary.
[1:48:48.600 --> 1:48:51.600]  I don't think the infertility numbers are voluntary.
[1:48:51.600 --> 1:48:53.600]  Doctor, have you looked at any data?
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:55.600]  That deals with life infertility and things.
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:01.600]  Ed Weibers sings a massive infertility in women and sperm count numbers, plunging in Western males.
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:05.600]  Certainly, the situation with male fertility, I'm not talking about at all.
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:10.600]  I'm talking about the choices that women are making to have fewer children than they used to and to have them later.
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:19.600]  And my understanding of the data is very much that the overwhelming majority of the decline in fertility that's being seen is voluntary.
[1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:22.600]  Though, of course, there is a small increase in female infertility as well.
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:26.600]  And that could be due to sociological pressures as well.
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:27.600]  Yes, but...
[1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:31.600]  The little hypochondriacs that think they're sick, in fact, make them feel...
[1:49:31.600 --> 1:49:33.600]  Well, look, I've seen the numbers.
[1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:39.600]  A large portion, but not even half, of it is that it's 45-year-old professional women who finally want to have a child.
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:46.600]  But, no, we have massive infertility now developing in 18, 20, 30-year-old women, men.
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:48.600]  I mean, I know a lot of fertility doctors have seen the numbers.
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:50.600]  Something's going on.
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:52.600]  Yes, certainly for men, there's plenty going on.
[1:49:52.600 --> 1:49:54.600]  And there's a lot that's not known about how it's going on.
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:50:08.600]  But, of course, the technologies that I'm talking about are among the applications of those technologies will be technologies that can restore fertility by making, for example, testicular stem cells work better.
[1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:09.600]  I understand.
[1:50:09.600 --> 1:50:10.600]  That's amazing.
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:13.600]  And that certainly is something that's important and can certainly help a lot of people.
[1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:18.600]  We'll be right back in this next segment with a couple more segments with Dr. Robert DeGray.

[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:44.600]  Aubrey de Grey, talked about life extension technologies
[1:55:44.600 --> 1:55:46.600]  What about accidents?
[1:55:46.600 --> 1:55:49.600]  In the future, if people live into 150 years old
[1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:51.600]  will they become accident obsessed?
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:55.600]  Because statistically, the most dangerous thing is automobile accidents
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:57.600]  or electrocution or grounding
[1:55:57.600 --> 1:56:01.600]  I mean, will we become a society basically encased
[1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:04.600]  in styrofoam so as to not be hurt
[1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:07.600]  or will we have robot nannies that take care of us?
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:10.600]  I think we will take much more care
[1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:13.600]  not to expose ourselves to risks
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:16.600]  but I think obsessed, maybe too strong a word
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:19.600]  I think one consequence of an increased quality
[1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:23.600]  and quantity of life will be that we place a higher value on life
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:26.600]  and I think that's going to make a difference
[1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:29.600]  and I think that's going to make the world a much less violent place
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:32.600]  because people just will take other people's lives more seriously
[1:56:32.600 --> 1:56:34.600]  if they take their own more seriously
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:37.600]  but with regard to accidental death
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:41.600]  I think there are going to be lots of ways in which we just throw money at the problem
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:44.600]  For example, with regard to automobile accidents
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:48.600]  we already have in the military plenty of technology available
[1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:51.600]  that can involve very sophisticated sensors
[1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:55.600]  to invoke automatic overrides in the case of human error
[1:56:55.600 --> 1:56:58.600]  whether on the part of the driver or someone or a pedestrian for example
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:01.600]  it's just that those technologies are really expensive
[1:57:01.600 --> 1:57:04.600]  so nobody puts them into your average automobile
[1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:07.600]  Exactly and then we have, as I said, computers keeping us safe
[1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:09.600]  running everything and then they take over
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:11.600]  How do you deal with that?
[1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:14.600]  Because by the time we get these life extension technologies
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:18.600]  and can basically keep postponing death almost indefinitely
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:22.600]  barring hyperactive super viruses that come out of nowhere
[1:57:22.600 --> 1:57:24.600]  or meteors hitting us or jet airplane crashes
[1:57:24.600 --> 1:57:27.600]  I mean, they'll always be something that will have a fix for that
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:31.600]  but it's a practice on ourselves, you know, perfecting it
[1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:36.600]  How do you deal with the artificially intelligent computer taking over?
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:39.600]  Well, I sometimes feel that computers have already taken over my life
[1:57:39.600 --> 1:57:41.600]  I think to spend my entire day fitting at one
[1:57:41.600 --> 1:57:45.600]  But no, seriously, I think that it's a long of its gradual
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:51.600]  so long as we make our own choices with regard to how much we get computers to do for us
[1:57:51.600 --> 1:57:54.600]  and we know that we're making those choices and we can always reverse them
[1:57:54.600 --> 1:57:56.600]  I don't really see a big problem with it
[1:57:56.600 --> 1:58:00.600]  But we've already got computers, pretty much designing computers
[1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:03.600]  and no one person knows how the whole computer works
[1:58:03.600 --> 1:58:07.600]  You've got all these expert eggheads who are geniuses and have trouble understanding it
[1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:10.600]  I mean, we're already getting there where the computers are going to take total control
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:14.600]  Even if they're not AI and evil like the Terminator
[1:58:14.600 --> 1:58:18.600]  it's just that they'll just start making decisions
[1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:21.600]  It is important not to let the whole thing go out of control
[1:58:21.600 --> 1:58:24.600]  and some of my good friends actually are working on precisely that problem
[1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:26.600]  I want to hear a little bit about that
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:29.600]  So stay there so we've got a break, we'll be back in one minute with more calls
[1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:30.600]  Please stay with us
[1:58:32.600 --> 1:58:34.600]  Thank you for listening to GCN
[1:58:34.600 --> 1:58:37.600]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today
[1:58:40.600 --> 1:58:42.600]  It is a big idea
[1:58:42.600 --> 1:58:44.600]  A new world order
[1:58:44.600 --> 1:58:46.600]  In the near future
[1:58:46.600 --> 1:58:47.600]  Earth is dominated by
[1:58:47.600 --> 1:58:49.600]  a powerful world government
[1:58:49.600 --> 1:58:52.600]  It's known as the Builder Bird
[1:58:52.600 --> 1:58:55.600]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:58:55.600 --> 1:58:58.600]  For thousands of years their dark order grew
[1:58:58.600 --> 1:59:01.600]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:06.600]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand
[1:59:08.600 --> 1:59:10.600]  For the first time in history
[1:59:10.600 --> 1:59:14.600]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open
[1:59:14.600 --> 1:59:18.600]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda
[1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:20.600]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government
[1:59:20.600 --> 1:59:22.600]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money
[1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:24.600]  They have all the money they need
[1:59:24.600 --> 1:59:45.600]  Waging war on corruption
[1:59:45.600 --> 1:59:54.600]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[1:59:54.600 --> 1:59:56.600]  Government cover-ups
[1:59:56.600 --> 1:59:57.600]  You want answers?
[1:59:57.600 --> 1:59:59.600]  Well so does he
[1:59:59.600 --> 2:00:03.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[2:00:03.600 --> 2:00:06.600]  And now live from Austin, Texas
[2:00:06.600 --> 2:00:08.600]  Alex Jones
[2:00:08.600 --> 2:00:15.600]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to your calls
[2:00:15.600 --> 2:00:19.600]  Ted in Texas, you're on the air with Dr. Aubrey deGray
[2:00:19.600 --> 2:00:20.600]  Go ahead
[2:00:20.600 --> 2:00:21.600]  Good afternoon gentlemen
[2:00:21.600 --> 2:00:22.600]  Hello
[2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:26.600]  I spoke to you a couple of weeks ago about the swimming pool water
[2:00:26.600 --> 2:00:33.600]  And I have, you know, I originally called it suggested eliminating pouring and tap water
[2:00:33.600 --> 2:00:37.600]  You know, drinking chlorinated tap water might produce some life expansion
[2:00:37.600 --> 2:00:41.600]  And as I researched the article that you asked me to do
[2:00:41.600 --> 2:00:49.600]  I found that they've begun replacing chlorine with chloramines
[2:00:49.600 --> 2:00:52.600]  Which is a far more dangerous oxidizer and chemical
[2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:56.600]  And I was wondering if Dr. deGray knew anything about that
[2:00:56.600 --> 2:00:59.600]  Yeah, the cocktail of toxic waste in our water
[2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:02.600]  You know, I brought up toxins last week with him
[2:01:02.600 --> 2:01:04.600]  And he said that wasn't as big a problem
[2:01:04.600 --> 2:01:06.600]  But from all the studies I've seen
[2:01:06.600 --> 2:01:09.600]  I mean, massive increases in cancers, you name it
[2:01:09.600 --> 2:01:12.600]  With all the stuff they're adding, the stuff we're breathing, and the mercury
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:14.600]  From the coal plants, doctor
[2:01:14.600 --> 2:01:17.600]  Yeah, I mean, I don't want to belittle these things
[2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:19.600]  These things are certainly things that we need to worry about
[2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:21.600]  And we need to try to prevent
[2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:25.600]  However, we have to remember, we have to keep a sense of proportion about it
[2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:29.600]  If we're talking about life extension and the postponement of age-related disease
[2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:34.600]  Because we know that, I mean, life expectancies are continuing to increase
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:37.600]  Despite the increase in all of these pollutants and so on
[2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:40.600]  And that's the simplest form of evidence
[2:01:40.600 --> 2:01:44.600]  That says that the main determinant of how long we live is not what we take in
[2:01:44.600 --> 2:01:48.600]  In terms of pollutants, but rather what's going on intrinsically
[2:01:48.600 --> 2:01:51.600]  In our bodies as a side effect of our normal metabolism
[2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:53.600]  Ted, did you send me that story you put together?
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:01:58.600]  Yes, I do, and you guys have the website, the page that it's on
[2:01:58.600 --> 2:02:00.600]  Okay, did they post it?
[2:02:00.600 --> 2:02:03.600]  I don't know, I just gave it to him, I can give it to you right now
[2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:06.600]  No, just send it to Aaron at InfoWars, thank you
[2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:10.600]  Harry in Florida, you're on the air with Dr. DeGray, go ahead
[2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:13.600]  Yes, hello, Alex, this is Harvey in Florida, how are you doing?
[2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:14.600]  Harvey, go ahead
[2:02:14.600 --> 2:02:16.600]  Yep, it's great to talk to you and your guest
[2:02:16.600 --> 2:02:20.600]  I'd like to ask him about what he thinks about the patent thing
[2:02:20.600 --> 2:02:23.600]  Like Geron patented the telomerase gene
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:27.600]  What does he think about the patenting and how the investments
[2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:31.600]  Well, the tremendous investment leads to a rush to market
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:34.600]  Like it did with the plant genetics
[2:02:34.600 --> 2:02:37.600]  I don't have any real fear in that area
[2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:40.600]  I think the market will look after itself in regard to all of this
[2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:43.600]  And I think one of the main reasons for not being scared
[2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:46.600]  Is that the therapies that are going to be necessary
[2:02:46.600 --> 2:02:48.600]  In order to comprehensively postpone aging
[2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:51.600]  Will have many, many different components
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:53.600]  Each of which will have been developed by different people
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:55.600]  And whose patents will be owned by different people
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:02:58.600]  So there will be a requirement to have a great deal of collaboration
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:01.600]  And business common sense, shall we say, in order to
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:03.600]  Well, let me throw this out, though, Doc
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:05.600]  And I understand you're all positive about all this
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:07.600]  And I'm not saying it doesn't have a positive sign
[2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:09.600]  It's one thing if it's for humans
[2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:11.600]  And we know a lot of bad drugs and things do get on the market
[2:03:11.600 --> 2:03:14.600]  But I agree there's more focus on that than, say, GMO crops
[2:03:14.600 --> 2:03:17.600]  But there's total evidence of GMO crops
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:20.600]  And the ones that have been heavily altered causing all sorts of problems
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:25.600]  And so I don't have confidence that there's not going to be all sorts of disasters
[2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:30.600]  It's certainly important to regulate the experimental testing
[2:03:30.600 --> 2:03:34.600]  Of things that are used on all of the living world
[2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:37.600]  Absolutely, because the knock-on effect can be very unpredictable
[2:03:37.600 --> 2:03:40.600]  And I don't deny that there have been some cases
[2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:43.600]  Not just in the case of drugs applied to humans
[2:03:43.600 --> 2:03:46.600]  In which things have been pushed forward too quickly
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:47.600]  Sure
[2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:49.600]  Anything else, Coller?
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:51.600]  Yes, yes, Alex
[2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:54.600]  Right, I was an early investor in plant genetic companies
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:59.600]  And it seems like mostly the wondrous things that they promised us
[2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:02.600]  They've actually used most of the inventions towards evil
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:05.600]  Like putting more nicotine in the tobacco plants
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:09.600]  May be able to use more chemicals on the plants
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:12.600]  So there's a tremendous potential for this to be meat misused
[2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:18.600]  And in my fact, they forced the people in our country to take it without any labeling
[2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:20.600]  It's all in all our foods without any labeling
[2:04:20.600 --> 2:04:22.600]  I'd like to hear his remarks about that
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:26.600]  Well, this is not really my area of expertise
[2:04:26.600 --> 2:04:28.600]  Mr. DeGray, we've got a break right now
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:30.600]  Come back and finish up, please
[2:04:30.600 --> 2:04:32.600]  And this will be our final segment, Mr. DeGray
[2:04:32.600 --> 2:04:35.600]  Then we're going to then go to Tibet with what's happening there
[2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:37.600]  With a guest as well on that subject
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:53.600]  We'll be right back here on the GCN Radio Network, PrismPlanet.com
[2:05:11.600 --> 2:05:14.600]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose
[2:05:14.600 --> 2:05:18.600]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings
[2:05:18.600 --> 2:05:22.600]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see

[2:05:30.600 --> 2:05:32.600]  Be sure to check out the huge discounts
[2:05:32.600 --> 2:05:34.600]  On films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement
[2:05:34.600 --> 2:05:38.600]  America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles
[2:05:38.600 --> 2:05:41.600]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war
[2:05:41.600 --> 2:05:44.600]  Truth is our weapon, and prismplanet.com has the tools you need
[2:05:44.600 --> 2:05:47.600]  To take the fight back to Big Brother
[2:05:47.600 --> 2:05:50.600]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease
[2:05:50.600 --> 2:05:53.600]  When natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[2:05:53.600 --> 2:05:55.600]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness
[2:05:55.600 --> 2:05:57.600]  Using Reif frequency technology
[2:05:57.600 --> 2:06:00.600]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Reif
[2:06:00.600 --> 2:06:04.600]  Discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies
[2:06:04.600 --> 2:06:08.600]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology
[2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:11.600]  For relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[2:06:11.600 --> 2:06:13.600]  There are no reported side effects
[2:06:13.600 --> 2:06:17.600]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness
[2:06:17.600 --> 2:06:19.600]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause
[2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:23.600]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences
[2:06:23.600 --> 2:06:26.600]  For various health conditions and is very easy to use
[2:06:26.600 --> 2:06:30.600]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back
[2:06:30.600 --> 2:06:36.600]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free at 866-885-6625
[2:06:36.600 --> 2:06:40.600]  That's 866-885-6625
[2:06:40.600 --> 2:06:46.600]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions
[2:06:47.600 --> 2:06:51.600]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:54.600]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[2:06:54.600 --> 2:06:57.600]  While taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:06:57.600 --> 2:07:00.600]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate

[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:56.600]  I can hear someone knocking on the door
[2:08:56.600 --> 2:08:58.600]  There are voices in the street
[2:08:58.600 --> 2:09:01.600]  And the sound are running feet
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:02.600]  And they whisper
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:03.600]  Thank you for joining us today
[2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:06.600]  We're already well into the third hour
[2:09:06.600 --> 2:09:10.600]  And I appreciate Dr. Aubrey DeGray joining us
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:17.600]  Bestselling author, researcher, published, scientist, computer engineer, biologist
[2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:21.600]  And really interesting debates and discussions that we've had today
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:29.600]  We have Urgent Tenzin who is the director for the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy
[2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:32.600]  To give us the inside scoop of what's going on there
[2:09:32.600 --> 2:09:33.600]  And he's on hold right now
[2:09:33.600 --> 2:09:36.600]  Trying to go back to Aubrey DeGray
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:39.600]  Mr. DeGray, thank you for coming on with us
[2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:41.600]  Thank you for spending time with us
[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:44.600]  Just finishing up that fellow's last question
[2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:49.600]  When he was talking about some of the unsavory things he witnessed as an investor
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:51.600]  Yeah, I think this is certainly true
[2:09:51.600 --> 2:09:57.600]  But some things are not always rolled out in the optimal way
[2:09:57.600 --> 2:10:00.600]  But ultimately, let's remember we do all live in a democracy
[2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:04.600]  And our elected representatives are the people who control all this
[2:10:04.600 --> 2:10:06.600]  The ultimate goal is to get re-elected
[2:10:06.600 --> 2:10:09.600]  And so it's really just a question of how much we care
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:13.600]  If we want something to be done, then we can get it done
[2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:16.600]  Well Dr. DeGray, I hope in the next six months or so we can have you back up
[2:10:16.600 --> 2:10:19.600]  To get more in depth in all of this and I really appreciate your time
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:21.600]  Fire out the name of the new book and the website
[2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:26.600]  None of the new book is ending aging and the website is Mfoundation.org
[2:10:26.600 --> 2:10:28.600]  Thanks for spending time with us
[2:10:28.600 --> 2:10:29.600]  Thanks for having me on the show
[2:10:29.600 --> 2:10:30.600]  Take care
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:35.600]  Okay, we do have Mr. Tinzen on the line
[2:10:35.600 --> 2:10:40.600]  Fantastic, getting him lined up there from India
[2:10:40.600 --> 2:10:45.600]  And he's the director of the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:49.600]  We have reports of the Chinese paramilitary police
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:54.600]  Parading people in the backs of flatbed cars all over different cities in Tibet
[2:10:54.600 --> 2:10:59.600]  The Reuters is reporting that the rebellion against the tyranny has spread
[2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:06.600]  We're now seeing neocon propaganda demonizing Tibet
[2:11:06.600 --> 2:11:10.600]  And trying to either make stuff up about the Tibetans or exaggerate things
[2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:12.600]  Or certainly not perfect, no one is
[2:11:12.600 --> 2:11:15.600]  Compared to the Communist Chinese, they hadn't killed 60 million of their own people
[2:11:15.600 --> 2:11:16.600]  I know that
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:19.600]  Penn and Teller attacking them, the list goes on and on
[2:11:19.600 --> 2:11:22.600]  Basically saying a lot of our media is saying China's good
[2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:27.600]  And boy, that's not just a 180 from our government supporting the Tibetans
[2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:30.600]  Who have obviously been invaded and slaved and mass murdered
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:33.600]  And their women forced to marry Chinese
[2:11:33.600 --> 2:11:37.600]  I'm not bashing Chinese either, it's to commit genocide
[2:11:37.600 --> 2:11:38.600]  Destroy their culture
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:44.600]  Our government's gone from the Tibetans are good to neutral to now, they're bad
[2:11:44.600 --> 2:11:49.600]  And by government, I'm seeing the media and others push this
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:54.600]  And we appreciate our guest for coming on with us
[2:11:54.600 --> 2:11:59.600]  Urgent hands in, thank you for coming on
[2:11:59.600 --> 2:12:01.600]  Yes, hello
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:03.600]  Thank you for coming on, can you give us
[2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:07.600]  Because you have, of course, inside sources like no one else inside Tibet right now
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:11.600]  We're seeing a news blackouts as they expelled foreigners three days ago
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:16.600]  And less and less info coming out, what's really happening there?
[2:12:16.600 --> 2:12:19.600]  Now, situation inside Tibet is very tense
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:21.600]  And it's worsening day by day
[2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:25.600]  And according to our informed sources
[2:12:25.600 --> 2:12:31.600]  Now, the Chinese have already started house by house rate
[2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:34.600]  In the cities of Lhasa
[2:12:34.600 --> 2:12:37.600]  Before the deadline given by the Chinese
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:41.600]  So now in the Lhasa streets, you can see only military tranks rolled
[2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:44.600]  People are effort to come outside
[2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:48.600]  And they are effort to speak with outside people
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:54.600]  And we have also got information that more than 1,000 Tibetans have been arrested
[2:12:54.600 --> 2:12:59.600]  And more than 70 people have been killed
[2:12:59.600 --> 2:13:03.600]  And 23 people have already been shot dead by the Chinese in one incident
[2:13:03.600 --> 2:13:05.600]  So it's very unfortunate
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:14.600]  And Chinese, they are continuing with the repressive action against the peaceful Tibetan demonstrators in Tibet
[2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:16.600]  Have you seen the reports in the western media?
[2:13:16.600 --> 2:13:18.600]  They are the minority of the reports
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:20.600]  The majority are neutral
[2:13:20.600 --> 2:13:26.600]  But a minority are actually demonizing the Tibetans with this information
[2:13:26.600 --> 2:13:28.600]  That's the first time I've seen this
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:31.600]  Have you seen this?
[2:13:31.600 --> 2:13:33.600]  Yes, please
[2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:35.600]  I couldn't pick up your question, please
[2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:37.600]  Will you read the question?
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:38.600]  Let me be clear
[2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:41.600]  There are some western media outlets
[2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:46.600]  Some media in the west is siding with the communist Chinese
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:48.600]  Are you aware of that?
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:55.600]  Yes, yes, there are so many western media giving information from Tibet
[2:13:55.600 --> 2:14:05.600]  But the Chinese have now already started sending back western reporters out of Tibet
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:13.600]  We've got press reports about the rebellion by the Tibetans spreading all over the country
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:20.600]  The demonstration in Tibet is now taking all over Tibet
[2:14:20.600 --> 2:14:31.600]  It's outside Tibet Ornum region also, so the demonstration is taking place in all parts of Tibet
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:39.600]  Can you go through any details that you've gotten from your sources inside Tibet that we haven't seen on the news?
[2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:43.600]  More details about the rebellion
[2:14:43.600 --> 2:14:54.600]  The demonstration has first started on 10th March, commemorating the 49th anniversary of Tibetan national uprising
[2:14:54.600 --> 2:15:05.600]  On 10th March, the Tibetan monks in the Dibong Monastery and the Ganden Monastery have initiated the demonstration
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:16.600]  Simultaneously, it took place in other places like Napa County in the Kirti Monastery and other regions also
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:22.600]  It almost took part in all the other regions
[2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:24.600]  Absolutely
[2:15:24.600 --> 2:15:35.600]  Yes, and it is protest, the Tibetan monks, Tibetan nuns, Tibetan students, Tibetan nomads and all the ordinary people
[2:15:35.600 --> 2:15:42.600]  Almost all Tibetan diasporas have rise against the Chinese rule inside Tibet
[2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:55.600]  Well, let's be clear, this all started after 50 plus years of bombings and attacks and arrest and secret police and in the last few weeks going around arresting leaders of the opposition
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:16:05.600]  Then people peacefully on the 50 plus anniversary of a mass murder, as the press has reported, peacefully demonstrating its Chinese domination
[2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:13.600]  And that's when they attack the peaceful people, the Chinese military, now the peaceful people are fighting back
[2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:20.600]  How are they beginning to physically fight back? We are seeing still some video of burning buildings and things like that
[2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:36.600]  The Tibetan people have started the demonstration peacefully and the demonstration was in a number of, so many numbers, it was crossing 2500-3000
[2:16:36.600 --> 2:16:51.600]  So the Chinese armed police, they tried to clamp down on the demonstrators and the crackdowns, started beating them and just shooting guns in the air
[2:16:51.600 --> 2:16:59.600]  So that's why sometimes the cops got frustrated and started throwing stones
[2:16:59.600 --> 2:17:04.600]  They got tired of groveling the thugs and decided to fight back
[2:17:04.600 --> 2:17:12.600]  They got frustrated, they are tired, the military, they are beating like anything
[2:17:12.600 --> 2:17:17.600]  But bullies always push and push and push until you push back, don't they?
[2:17:17.600 --> 2:17:20.600]  Yes
[2:17:20.600 --> 2:17:27.600]  Right here in Austin, they are doubling the size of the SWAT team, swelling with the wrong recruits to dominate and oppress us
[2:17:27.600 --> 2:17:34.600]  But it's all part of the new library here in the country where they forcibly take DNA samples from your children for FBI databases at birth
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:37.600]  It's part of the land of the free, home of the slaves
[2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:43.600]  We're talking again ladies and gentlemen to the director of the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy
[2:17:43.600 --> 2:17:51.600]  Sir, in the time we've got left, anything else that's important for people to know, any other reports, anything that I haven't asked you that people need to know?
[2:17:51.600 --> 2:18:00.600]  Yes, I want to let the people know that the situation inside Tibet is very tense
[2:18:00.600 --> 2:18:07.600]  And now the Chinese government is kicking out all the foreign journalists out of Tibet
[2:18:07.600 --> 2:18:11.600]  And now information is very hard to come from Tibet, you know
[2:18:11.600 --> 2:18:23.600]  So we want to appeal to the world to give attention to the Tibetan issue and send your free media into the world
[2:18:23.600 --> 2:18:30.600]  Because in Chinese, there are billion people in the country and they get only censored information
[2:18:30.600 --> 2:18:36.600]  Whatever the government information is given to them, they receive only that kind of information
[2:18:36.600 --> 2:18:42.600]  So it's very important that there should be a freedom of press inside Tibet
[2:18:42.600 --> 2:18:54.600]  We're just very important and we appeal to all the peace-loving countries and the United Nations to send a fact-finding mission inside Tibet
[2:18:54.600 --> 2:19:00.600]  Otherwise there is no other way to know the real situation inside Tibet
[2:19:00.600 --> 2:19:06.600]  Are the Chinese communists letting the UN in?
[2:19:06.600 --> 2:19:14.600]  Yes, they're trying to pressurize all the other countries because they have super power, they're economically very strong
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:20.600]  So they use their power in the economic market and all
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:23.600]  So the UN isn't going in?
[2:19:23.600 --> 2:19:24.600]  Yes
[2:19:24.600 --> 2:19:26.600]  They are going in?
[2:19:26.600 --> 2:19:32.600]  Yes, UN, UN, as a body, they haven't, I'm like, till now haven't intervened
[2:19:32.600 --> 2:19:38.600]  Yeah, they're doing nothing, of course, sir, sir, they run China, of course, they have the one-shot policy
[2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:42.600]  Our government put Mao in, we'll be right back, stay there
[2:19:47.600 --> 2:19:51.600]  It is a big idea, a new world order
[2:19:51.600 --> 2:19:56.600]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[2:19:56.600 --> 2:20:02.600]  It's known as the Bilderberg, but their objective being world domination
[2:20:02.600 --> 2:20:05.600]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew
[2:20:05.600 --> 2:20:13.600]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand
[2:20:13.600 --> 2:20:20.600]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open
[2:20:20.600 --> 2:20:24.600]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda
[2:20:24.600 --> 2:20:27.600]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government
[2:20:27.600 --> 2:20:31.600]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need, they're after power
[2:20:31.600 --> 2:20:32.600]  That's their affidavit

[2:22:47.600 --> 2:22:49.600]  Gasoline prices are out of control
[2:22:49.600 --> 2:22:52.600]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[2:22:52.600 --> 2:22:57.600]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[2:22:57.600 --> 2:23:00.600]  Very few consumers even know such products exist
[2:23:00.600 --> 2:23:05.600]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run
[2:23:05.600 --> 2:23:07.600]  Yet they don't want you to know about them
[2:23:07.600 --> 2:23:13.600]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store
[2:23:13.600 --> 2:23:15.600]  SFR lasts up to 6 months
[2:23:15.600 --> 2:23:19.600]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars
[2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:24.600]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong
[2:23:24.600 --> 2:23:29.600]  That they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95

[2:23:46.600 --> 2:23:49.600]  We will not be forgotten
[2:23:49.600 --> 2:23:51.600]  We won't be left behind
[2:23:51.600 --> 2:23:55.600]  Our memories live on for a mind
[2:23:58.600 --> 2:24:00.600]  And boys feel
[2:24:02.600 --> 2:24:04.600]  We'll ride again
[2:24:08.600 --> 2:24:10.600]  I am a Midwest farmer
[2:24:10.600 --> 2:24:12.600]  I make a living off the land
[2:24:12.600 --> 2:24:15.600]  I ride a John Deere tractor
[2:24:15.600 --> 2:24:17.600]  I'm a liberated man
[2:24:17.600 --> 2:24:19.600]  But the rain hasn't fallen
[2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:22.600]  Since the middle of July
[2:24:22.600 --> 2:24:26.600]  And if it don't come soon, my crops will die
[2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:29.600]  The bankman says he likes me
[2:24:29.600 --> 2:24:31.600]  But there's nothing he can do
[2:24:31.600 --> 2:24:33.600]  He tells me that he's coming
[2:24:33.600 --> 2:24:36.600]  But the clouds are coming too
[2:24:36.600 --> 2:24:38.600]  He ain't my friend
[2:24:39.600 --> 2:24:41.600]  Okay folks, final segment with our guests
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:45.600]  I've got a ton of news I'm going to shotgun in the last 30 minutes
[2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:47.600]  He is the director of the
[2:24:47.600 --> 2:24:50.600]  The Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy
[2:24:50.600 --> 2:24:52.600]  To boil it down, you heard the U.N. isn't helping
[2:24:52.600 --> 2:24:53.600]  They're not going to help
[2:24:53.600 --> 2:24:54.600]  The U.S. isn't helping
[2:24:54.600 --> 2:24:55.600]  No one's helping
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:24:57.600]  It's all just lip service
[2:24:57.600 --> 2:24:59.600]  And now our media is starting to lie
[2:24:59.600 --> 2:25:01.600]  And exaggerate about the Tibetans
[2:25:01.600 --> 2:25:04.600]  It's just getting sicker and sicker
[2:25:04.600 --> 2:25:06.600]  In closing, sir
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:08.600]  How do we support you guys?
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:09.600]  How do we help you guys?
[2:25:09.600 --> 2:25:12.600]  And any websites, phone numbers
[2:25:12.600 --> 2:25:14.600]  Anything else we need to know, sir?
[2:25:14.600 --> 2:25:20.600]  Yes, if peace-loving people or a country
[2:25:20.600 --> 2:25:23.600]  They want to support Tibetan cause
[2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:27.600]  And they really want to know the Tibetan issue
[2:25:27.600 --> 2:25:30.600]  And to follow up what is going inside Tibet
[2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:32.600]  You can visit our website
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:35.600]  That is dchrd.org
[2:25:35.600 --> 2:25:37.600]  And then you will get all the latest information
[2:25:37.600 --> 2:25:39.600]  About what is happening inside Tibet
[2:25:39.600 --> 2:25:46.600]  And at the time, we appeal to all our supporters
[2:25:46.600 --> 2:25:53.600]  Who love peace and to support us
[2:25:53.600 --> 2:25:56.600]  And appeal your government to pressurize China
[2:25:56.600 --> 2:26:02.600]  To send a tech-finding mission into Tibet
[2:26:02.600 --> 2:26:08.600]  And to resource the human rights of the Tibetan people
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:09.600]  Sure
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:13.600]  Please ask your government to send a free media inside Tibet
[2:26:13.600 --> 2:26:16.600]  Sure, Mr. Tenzin, last question
[2:26:16.600 --> 2:26:18.600]  What do you predict is going to happen?
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:19.600]  Is this going to spread?
[2:26:19.600 --> 2:26:21.600]  Is this going to embarrass the Olympics?
[2:26:21.600 --> 2:26:23.600]  Is this going to get the Olympics boycotted?
[2:26:23.600 --> 2:26:28.600]  I mean, do you think this resistance to tyrants is going to continue?
[2:26:28.600 --> 2:26:33.600]  Yes, I think this has given ample indication
[2:26:33.600 --> 2:26:36.600]  Of human rights violation inside Tibet
[2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:41.600]  So I think now it has become very hard for the Chinese
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:45.600]  It has shown world that how the Chinese are dealing
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:47.600]  With the human rights violation inside Tibet
[2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:51.600]  And under all the participants, now they must really think
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:54.600]  About participating in the Olympic Games
[2:26:54.600 --> 2:26:59.600]  So until and unless China does stop brutal action
[2:26:59.600 --> 2:27:02.600]  Against the peaceful demonstrators, I think all other countries
[2:27:02.600 --> 2:27:06.600]  Should reconsider of what do they in future
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:10.600]  Alright, sir, well thank you for spending time with us
[2:27:10.600 --> 2:27:13.600]  And we'll talk to you in the next few days as this develops
[2:27:13.600 --> 2:27:16.600]  Okay, thank you, Mr. Tenzin
[2:27:16.600 --> 2:27:19.600]  Thank you, man
[2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:23.600]  Now again, I feel empathy for what's happening in Tibet
[2:27:23.600 --> 2:27:26.600]  And I've seen so many news pieces and comedy pieces
[2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:28.600]  And other things
[2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:32.600]  Billing the Dalai Lama is some type of wicked dictator
[2:27:32.600 --> 2:27:35.600]  And how the Tibetans deserve what's happening to them
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:38.600]  And the Chinese or communist Chinese government are good
[2:27:38.600 --> 2:27:40.600]  Want to be sure and differentiate from the Chinese people
[2:27:40.600 --> 2:27:42.600]  And their corrupt government
[2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:44.600]  That's killed at least 60 million of them
[2:27:44.600 --> 2:27:46.600]  And obviously the Dalai Lama is not perfect
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:49.600]  I don't follow his religion, I don't follow what that country did
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:51.600]  Or what they believe in, but they were statistically
[2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:55.600]  A pretty peaceful, prosperous, but also sparsely populated
[2:27:55.600 --> 2:27:59.600]  Roof of the world, you know, on average
[2:27:59.600 --> 2:28:03.600]  About 12,000 feet population
[2:28:03.600 --> 2:28:07.600]  Some of them living up as high as 18,000 feet, incredible
[2:28:07.600 --> 2:28:11.600]  And they had this huge military just roll in
[2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:13.600]  After the communists took over
[2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:16.600]  And it's now been declassified that our government gave them the weapons
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:19.600]  Our government gave the communists Chinese the power
[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:22.600]  They actually blocked and sabotaged the nationalists
[2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:25.600]  And it is just, it is just despicable to see
[2:28:25.600 --> 2:28:28.600]  The way our countries change
[2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:31.600]  The way we've gone from supporting the Tibetans
[2:28:31.600 --> 2:28:33.600]  At least on the surface, because they had to
[2:28:33.600 --> 2:28:35.600]  Meanwhile funding their enemies all day
[2:28:35.600 --> 2:28:40.600]  To now just publicly, yeah, they can, you know, they deserve it
[2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:43.600]  They're bad, they're evil
[2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:45.600]  And that's just basically the end of the story
[2:28:45.600 --> 2:28:47.600]  Okay, here's what I'm going to do
[2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:51.600]  I've got about 50 news articles in front of me
[2:28:51.600 --> 2:28:54.600]  And I'm going to come back and I'm just going to
[2:28:54.600 --> 2:28:57.600]  Read the headline off each article and comment a little bit on it
[2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:00.600]  I'm also going to get into your cable boxes, watching you
[2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:02.600]  Now, I know for our listeners, that's old news
[2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:04.600]  But now it's in the mainstream media
[2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:08.600]  And they just hide incredible things in plain view
[2:29:08.600 --> 2:29:12.600]  It's just all, I mean, I mean, sarcastically
[2:29:12.600 --> 2:29:14.600]  I don't really believe this, but some people do
[2:29:14.600 --> 2:29:17.600]  And maybe they'll just take their mask off
[2:29:17.600 --> 2:29:19.600]  And they'll all have a lizard hedge next week
[2:29:19.600 --> 2:29:24.600]  I mean, you know, it's starting to get that weird
[2:29:24.600 --> 2:29:26.600]  I mean, a huge flying saucer might land
[2:29:26.600 --> 2:29:28.600]  And pigs might walk off of it
[2:29:28.600 --> 2:29:30.600]  And bush goes and shakes their hand
[2:29:30.600 --> 2:29:32.600]  And if you say it's weird, people will say you're crazy
[2:29:32.600 --> 2:29:36.600]  I mean, you know, your cable box, watching you isn't good, folks
[2:29:38.600 --> 2:29:42.600]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[2:29:42.600 --> 2:29:45.600]  And the G-C-N radio network
[2:30:30.600 --> 2:30:32.600]  A stronger immune system
[2:30:32.600 --> 2:30:33.600]  Clear skin
[2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:35.600]  And health in every aspect of your being

[2:31:14.600 --> 2:31:17.600]  Know exactly what you'll need to have hidden to live and how to survive under severe martial law
[2:31:17.600 --> 2:31:20.600]  The worst part of martial law is in the beginning stages
[2:31:20.600 --> 2:31:24.600]  SurviveMarshallLaw.com will show you how to act around controlling troops
[2:31:24.600 --> 2:31:27.600]  Where to store life-saving supplies and what to look for
[2:31:27.600 --> 2:31:30.600]  Surviving can be difficult, but possible
[2:31:30.600 --> 2:31:35.600]  Arm yourself with the knowledge as this is the only weapon you will have to protect your family

[2:31:47.600 --> 2:31:49.600]  Government is best, which governs least
[2:31:49.600 --> 2:31:51.600]  Wake up and smell the fascism
[2:31:51.600 --> 2:31:54.600]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry
[2:31:54.600 --> 2:31:57.600]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[2:31:57.600 --> 2:32:00.600]  It's not who votes the counts, it's who counts the votes
[2:32:00.600 --> 2:32:03.600]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice
[2:32:03.600 --> 2:32:07.600]  Sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech

[2:33:32.600 --> 2:33:37.600]  All of you, the listeners, the affiliates, the sponsors
[2:33:37.600 --> 2:33:45.600]  Don't forget, we're not just here weekdays, 11 to 2 central, 12 to 3 p.m.
[2:33:45.600 --> 2:33:47.600]  Eastern
[2:33:47.600 --> 2:33:49.600]  Oh, we're live
[2:33:49.600 --> 2:33:53.600]  Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[2:33:57.600 --> 2:33:59.600]  Oh, I gotta hear this one little part
[2:33:59.600 --> 2:34:02.600]  It's not the kill
[2:34:02.600 --> 2:34:08.600]  It's the thrill
[2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:30.600]  Okay, let's go ahead and plunge into the news here today
[2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:34.600]  We've already covered some of this in the first hour
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:39.600]  There's no real way to even categorize this, I tried this morning
[2:34:39.600 --> 2:34:43.600]  We've already covered what's happening in Tibet, we've got into live extension technologies
[2:34:43.600 --> 2:34:49.600]  We've also had on the editor from the London Guardian, their financial editor
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:55.600]  Talk about the possibility of coming depression and how our government and corporations engineered
[2:34:55.600 --> 2:34:59.600]  What's happening with the subprime mortgages
[2:34:59.600 --> 2:35:02.600]  In the first hour
[2:35:02.600 --> 2:35:09.600]  You know, I'm not going to do rhyme or reason, I'm just going to borrow into the stack and I'm going to just cover it
[2:35:09.600 --> 2:35:12.600]  Drinkers face drug checks
[2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:18.600]  Customers were tested for drugs before they could go for a pint in an Oxford pub
[2:35:18.600 --> 2:35:24.600]  About 80 people were tested with drugs
[2:35:24.600 --> 2:35:30.600]  I.T.E. Meiser outside the Blackbird in Blackbird Lays last Friday night
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:33.600]  With the promise of more crackdowns to come
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:36.600]  Two people were arrested, seven were searched
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:39.600]  And a quantity of suspected cocaine was found, police said
[2:35:39.600 --> 2:35:45.600]  Landlord Glenn Williams said he wanted to prove drugs were not being taken in his pub
[2:35:45.600 --> 2:35:51.600]  Officers hailed the stop checks, the first such operation in Blackbird, a success
[2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:54.600]  Let's stop right there
[2:35:54.600 --> 2:35:58.600]  This isn't Russia, this isn't Communist China, by the way, they don't do that there
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:35:59.600]  Never did
[2:35:59.600 --> 2:36:05.600]  This is England, the supposed birthplace of modern liberty and what turned into the United States
[2:36:05.600 --> 2:36:07.600]  That's where our system comes from
[2:36:07.600 --> 2:36:13.600]  And I see reports every day where they demand you thumb scan, face scan to go in
[2:36:13.600 --> 2:36:18.600]  Where they demand DNA samples, where they demand to search you
[2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:22.600]  And they are just doing this in mass
[2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:28.600]  And they also set up these mobile vans that they make you walk into, walk through
[2:36:28.600 --> 2:36:34.600]  That scan your body basically with high powered sound waves, some of them use other systems
[2:36:34.600 --> 2:36:39.600]  Then they get a digital naked image of your body
[2:36:39.600 --> 2:36:43.600]  I mean genitals, everything, it's more human than human, it's better than human eye
[2:36:43.600 --> 2:36:46.600]  You can see every pore, everything, and they record that onto a database
[2:36:46.600 --> 2:36:48.600]  And they swipe your card when you go in
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:51.600]  Let me see, they swipe your card, your naked, you go through it
[2:36:51.600 --> 2:36:56.600]  It's just like in England in the US, they put you in a DNA database, they've been doing it for 35 years
[2:36:56.600 --> 2:37:00.600]  And now they've announced Homeland Security's doing it
[2:37:00.600 --> 2:37:06.600]  And I've got direct government websites, University of Texas running it, nationwide here in the US
[2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:09.600]  They don't, they just do it
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:12.600]  You're a newborn baby folks, 45 days after they're born
[2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:18.600]  You don't contest it, it goes into the FBI database under Homeland Security
[2:37:18.600 --> 2:37:22.600]  That's not freedom, that's not liberty, that's not a free society
[2:37:22.600 --> 2:37:26.600]  The government's criminal, okay, see I said I would just read headlines and move on
[2:37:26.600 --> 2:37:29.600]  I can't, it's all interconnected
[2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:36.600]  Customers were tested for drugs before they could go for a pint in an Oxford pub
[2:37:36.600 --> 2:37:39.600]  We got very good feedback and it went without a problem
[2:37:39.600 --> 2:37:43.600]  See, it's a sheep training drill, the cops just ordered them to do it and they would do it
[2:37:43.600 --> 2:37:48.600]  And they said, oh they like it, just like the British News always says, everyone loves the cameras
[2:37:48.600 --> 2:37:50.600]  You have actual polls though, they all hate it
[2:37:50.600 --> 2:37:55.600]  They'll say everyone loves the European Union in England, but they read the polls, 90% now hate it
[2:37:55.600 --> 2:37:58.600]  The polls are from 80 to 90 plus percent
[2:37:58.600 --> 2:38:05.600]  But see, this is written for cattle, the whole article is just to condone, oh we just uh
[2:38:05.600 --> 2:38:09.600]  Only one person refused to go through and that gentleman was arrested
[2:38:09.600 --> 2:38:15.600]  So let's be clear, you don't even have a choice
[2:38:15.600 --> 2:38:21.600]  You think you're going into a bar and boom, they're there drug testing you
[2:38:21.600 --> 2:38:27.600]  I believe it was succession, we will be using the IT miser, that's some kind of tester
[2:38:27.600 --> 2:38:32.600]  Again at the Blackbird and whenever we see fit, whenever we see fit is where the government were God
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:41.600]  This was the first in a line of initiatives to fight drugs that we will bring into lease
[2:38:41.600 --> 2:38:46.600]  We got very good feedback, the overwhelming opinion from people was that it was a good thing
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:50.600]  And they could enjoy a Friday night without worry, without worry
[2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:56.600]  Cocaine, the guy goes, you're not going to test me for drugs, oh we know you've got cocaine, you're arrested
[2:38:56.600 --> 2:39:02.600]  Guilty until proven innocent, just like all your bank accounts are instantly uploaded to the government
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:07.600]  Ten years ago they had to file a suspicious transaction report and they would see your account
[2:39:07.600 --> 2:39:10.600]  Now it's just all there, the government just types in, they go right in
[2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:14.600]  Most of the time they try to cover it up but government people and they're stealing money out of accounts every day
[2:39:14.600 --> 2:39:18.600]  Or giving it to their cousin who steals it, they kind of fence it out
[2:39:18.600 --> 2:39:24.600]  And it's just a reign of corrupt evil, child molesters in every major state run the CPS, Texas, Florida
[2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:30.600]  It's all over the news, Massachusetts, just mainstream news, child molesters in every top position
[2:39:30.600 --> 2:39:35.600]  Mass rape rooms at all the Texas youth homes, all of them the press admits it
[2:39:35.600 --> 2:39:40.600]  The women's prison giant rape rooms making videotape, porno movies of torture films
[2:39:40.600 --> 2:39:45.600]  They shut it down two years ago outside Austin, I can just talk about right where I live
[2:39:45.600 --> 2:39:50.600]  Just total frothing criminals everywhere and then useful idiot morons working next to them
[2:39:50.600 --> 2:39:54.600]  You don't even know, they're sitting next to the devil
[2:39:54.600 --> 2:39:59.600]  Just corruption gone to seed, gone to seed, gone to seed, gone to seed, gone to seed
[2:39:59.600 --> 2:40:02.600]  Just like giving loans to people with no job and no credit
[2:40:02.600 --> 2:40:07.600]  The whole system corrupt, blown, shot, fried
[2:40:07.600 --> 2:40:14.600]  And a huge mass of cattle that still think we're in Mayberry, still think it's leave it to beaver
[2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:16.600]  Who still think everything's alright
[2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:20.600]  There's us, the good people
[2:40:20.600 --> 2:40:26.600]  And then there's just scum running and sucking and feeding off the entire government apparatchas
[2:40:26.600 --> 2:40:31.600]  Apparachic
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:34.600]  And then there's England, and they're starting this year too now
[2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:39.600]  Five million cameras in England, telescreen shouting orders, face scanning, thumb scanning
[2:40:39.600 --> 2:40:43.600]  Transponders taxing you by the mile, total control, no free speech allowed
[2:40:43.600 --> 2:40:47.600]  Police put you in terror databases for videotaping or even talking in groups of bigger than three
[2:40:47.600 --> 2:40:52.600]  Cops suddenly show up, you can be potbellied and look like you're 50 like I do
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:55.600]  And they walk over and tell you, move along, they do it to other people
[2:40:55.600 --> 2:41:00.600]  Just total secret police everywhere feeding on everyone, control freaks running around
[2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:05.600]  Most of the cops are foreigners frothing and laughing and snicker giggling
[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:07.600]  And what do they do? What do they ship in?
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:11.600]  You think that island country with iron clad controls
[2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:15.600]  One of the biggest cocaine users in the world, one of the biggest marijuana users in the world
[2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:21.600]  One of the biggest other, the government is shipping that in and they've been caught
[2:41:21.600 --> 2:41:23.600]  And it's disgusting
[2:41:23.600 --> 2:41:29.600]  You want to hurt these scumbags? Go into rehab, get off the drugs, get kicked
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:33.600]  Decided into big, stop using their filth
[2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:36.600]  It's disgusting
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:42.600]  It's a disgusting, disgusting, disgusting situation
[2:41:42.600 --> 2:41:52.600]  You want me to do 10 or 15 shows three hours long just with experts on all the admissions and news articles of state police, feds, CIA, DEA
[2:41:52.600 --> 2:41:56.600]  All caught shipping in tractor trailers of pure cocaine
[2:41:56.600 --> 2:41:59.600]  You know why that's important? It's pure cocaine, they always get caught shipping in
[2:41:59.600 --> 2:42:03.600]  That means directly from the source
[2:42:03.600 --> 2:42:12.600]  Every time the government gets caught with a plane or a truck or a boat full of it, it's pure
[2:42:12.600 --> 2:42:15.600]  And it's not like it's a debate, don't sit there in your squad car
[2:42:15.600 --> 2:42:20.600]  I mean, a local talk show last week was saying, I just can't believe what the people say
[2:42:20.600 --> 2:42:25.600]  That Alex Jones, that the government ships the drugs in
[2:42:25.600 --> 2:42:32.600]  I've been an officer for years, local talk show hosts now, that's not true
[2:42:32.600 --> 2:42:38.600]  The head of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard Grasso, went to the FARC publicly in front of news reporters
[2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:44.600]  And said, invest your drug money with us and under federal law, they are authorized to
[2:42:44.600 --> 2:42:49.600]  Oh yeah, drug dealings legal at the international and banking level, you didn't know that?
[2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:52.600]  These laws are for you
[2:42:52.600 --> 2:42:58.600]  Because they had to breed a force of federalized local police, because the feds give them the grant money
[2:42:58.600 --> 2:43:02.600]  To kick down doors and drag people out, it didn't for drugs
[2:43:02.600 --> 2:43:07.600]  It also fills the private prisons owned by the drug cartels, that was their first phase
[2:43:07.600 --> 2:43:12.600]  Phase two is huge cadres of black ski mask guys that will come to your house and kill you
[2:43:12.600 --> 2:43:18.600]  And come to your house and take you to the FEMA camp, and don't roll your eyes, it's all over the news now cops
[2:43:18.600 --> 2:43:22.600]  And don't worry, you're working for guys that are going to take your pension and everything you got down the line
[2:43:22.600 --> 2:43:26.600]  So you'll be punished by what you're doing yourself, and by the way, drink some more fluoride water
[2:43:26.600 --> 2:43:29.600]  And listen to kooks like me
[2:43:29.600 --> 2:43:33.600]  Don't listen to me, just you know, I'm a kook, okay?
[2:43:33.600 --> 2:43:36.600]  I'm a kook, I don't like this
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:43.600]  The Chicago Tribune, remember, Janet Jackson had the wardrobe malfunction, and Tevo said three years ago at the Super Bowl
[2:43:43.600 --> 2:43:46.600]  Oh, what was the record, 2.3 rewinds
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:50.600]  And the Chicago Tribune said, well how are you doing that?
[2:43:50.600 --> 2:43:53.600]  Everybody called me Alex, you're right, you're right
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:59.600]  And I said Tevo tracks what we watch and what we do and creates psychological databases on us
[2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:01.600]  And I said, we think I just make that up
[2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:05.600]  And then I told you, because they put a press release out, boy, big detective work on my part
[2:44:05.600 --> 2:44:09.600]  That they're using the audio and cameras in your computers
[2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:11.600]  Multiple companies by the way are doing it
[2:44:11.600 --> 2:44:14.600]  But Google made the announcement to watch you
[2:44:14.600 --> 2:44:18.600]  Oh, that's freedom
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:22.600]  Well, here it is today, Comcast cameras to start watching you
[2:44:22.600 --> 2:44:28.600]  If you have some tinfoil handy, now it might be, see, this is a big TV blog saying this
[2:44:28.600 --> 2:44:31.600]  But see, they still got to do the pre-joke
[2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:36.600]  Well, they're doing it, but you're kooky to even read the article and say you don't want it
[2:44:36.600 --> 2:44:39.600]  See that conditioning, oh well, it's kooky to be against it
[2:44:39.600 --> 2:44:41.600]  I better let them watch me in my house
[2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:47.600]  See, see how being a mindless jellyfish who's a pack follower destroys you
[2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:54.600]  If you have some tinfoil handy, now it might be a good time to fashion a hat at the digital living room conference today
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:44:57.600]  And they have a link to it
[2:44:57.600 --> 2:45:12.600]  Gerard Kunkel, Comcast senior VP of user experience told me that the cable company is experimenting with different camera technologies built into devices so we can know who is in your living room
[2:45:12.600 --> 2:45:21.600]  The idea being that if you turn off your cable box, it recognizes you and pulls up shows already in your profile or makes recommendations
[2:45:21.600 --> 2:45:25.600]  And of course, it's two-way, it goes into how they watch you and track you
[2:45:25.600 --> 2:45:32.600]  If parents are watching TV with children, for example, parental controls could appear to block certain content from appearing on the screen
[2:45:32.600 --> 2:45:37.600]  See, already, it's watching you, it's like Toyota says in a few years they're going to have an infrared camera
[2:45:37.600 --> 2:45:44.600]  And if there's a pressure sensor in the seat and it's hot, it goes ahead and calls the police through the cell phone in your navigation system
[2:45:44.600 --> 2:45:48.600]  Sounds good, but see, then they just dial in and watch, it's control
[2:45:48.600 --> 2:45:55.600]  I mean, folks, do you want your cable box making parental controls and then by the way, calling CPS
[2:45:55.600 --> 2:46:02.600]  If it sees a child in the room and you let them watch an R-rated movie, and believe me, you will see that happen within three years
[2:46:02.600 --> 2:46:05.600]  This is already in place, they're now just announcing it
[2:46:05.600 --> 2:46:10.600]  It's been in place for a decade with the microphones, five years with the cameras
[2:46:10.600 --> 2:46:15.600]  It will happen, do you understand?
[2:46:15.600 --> 2:46:20.600]  I can't believe, I have to even say, it's George Arwell to have cameras watching it
[2:46:20.600 --> 2:46:23.600]  And it says it's going to watch you and make sure you're good
[2:46:23.600 --> 2:46:28.600]  And there's people right now going, good, I like that, that's freedom, that's freedom
[2:46:28.600 --> 2:46:35.600]  The idea is being that if you turn your cable box on, it recognizes you and pulls up shows already in your profile or makes recommendations
[2:46:35.600 --> 2:46:41.600]  If parents are watching TV with their children, for example, parental controls could appear to block certain content from appearing on the screen
[2:46:41.600 --> 2:46:49.600]  Conkel also said the type of monitoring is the holy grail because it could help serve up specially tailored ads
[2:46:49.600 --> 2:46:55.600]  See, what did I tell you years ago? See, because I went and read the research papers on it
[2:46:55.600 --> 2:47:04.600]  And most people don't know why you live in Austin and you're on a Malaysian website or a Japanese website or a German website
[2:47:04.600 --> 2:47:10.600]  And it's popping up with Austin singles ads
[2:47:10.600 --> 2:47:17.600]  It might even say, you know, you're a 30-something year old male, look at this girl
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:23.600]  You're on a mainstream website and all of a sudden a woman is shaking her behind at you up on the top banner
[2:47:23.600 --> 2:47:28.600]  That's just the cookies, Jack, this is light years worse
[2:47:28.600 --> 2:47:34.600]  And remember, first hour I covered the government takes all your baby's blood, now more mainstream news
[2:47:34.600 --> 2:47:39.600]  And now it isn't just they keep it in a federal DNA database, now it goes to Homeland Security
[2:47:39.600 --> 2:47:44.600]  Your child, your daughter, your son at birth is in Homeland Security
[2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:47.600]  Do you understand?
[2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:58.600]  Do you even care enough so when you're in the hospital when they bring the form and say, it's mandated, you need to and push it on you to say no
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:05.600]  Perhaps I've seen enemy of the state to me times, perhaps I'm just naive about the depths to which Comcast currently tracks my every move
[2:48:05.600 --> 2:48:10.600]  I can't trust Comcast with BitTorrent, yeah there are the ones censoring the web and...
[2:48:10.600 --> 2:48:20.600]  So why should I trust them with my must be kept secret DVR clogging addition to keeping up with the...
[2:48:20.600 --> 2:48:24.600]  It must be some pop thing, it's cartoshans
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:32.600]  Conkel also spoke on camera with me about fixing bad Comcast user experiences, the ongoing BitTorrent battle with VOD
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:43.600]  But he mostly towed the corporate line on these issues, the monitoring your living room came up after my camera was put away
[2:48:43.600 --> 2:48:51.600]  But listen, we need to contact this writer, this is a big website, big TV review website and say, hey would you like to go to Google's website?
[2:48:51.600 --> 2:48:54.600]  They explain they're already watching you Bubba
[2:48:54.600 --> 2:48:58.600]  I mean I remember it was like almost three years ago
[2:48:58.600 --> 2:49:02.600]  We first broke and by broke Google put a press release out and no one reported on it
[2:49:02.600 --> 2:49:06.600]  We found like a week old press release where they said we're already watching you, already listening to you, already tracking you
[2:49:06.600 --> 2:49:10.600]  Yahoo's doing it but our system's better and they're doing it but our system's better
[2:49:10.600 --> 2:49:17.600]  That's how I learned of all the other companies was them bragging, oh ours is much more, it tracks everything you're doing
[2:49:17.600 --> 2:49:23.600]  Down to the facial expressions, is the ads Google is showing you or is it upsetting to you?
[2:49:23.600 --> 2:49:31.600]  You know while you're sitting there watching pornography, masturbating and that camera's built into the screen that the government's tuned in with AI computers
[2:49:31.600 --> 2:49:35.600]  Recording that and filing it, guaranteed going on with select subjects
[2:49:35.600 --> 2:49:44.600]  I mean I'm sorry to have to get graphic here with you, this is our level of total patheticness
[2:49:44.600 --> 2:49:52.600]  But they're smart tyrants, they're putting the grid in, now they're gearing up the camps and police and armed robots
[2:49:52.600 --> 2:49:58.600]  On the news yesterday again and hovercraft and poison water
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:04.600]  They had to brainwash the cops and the public incrementally to accept this, now it can begin
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:08.600]  One month the cops swat teaming and pulling a patriot out to go to a camp
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:12.600]  But five years later you'll be dying of your accelerated cancer you were implanted with
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:16.600]  Everyone gets their eugenics shot
[2:50:16.600 --> 2:50:21.600]  That's right your child's dying of leukemia, you trust the government officer
[2:50:21.600 --> 2:50:26.600]  Alex is bad, Alex doesn't like the cameras watching me without a warrant
[2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:29.600]  Just randomly Alex is a radical
[2:50:29.600 --> 2:50:33.600]  Alex Jones is crazy
[2:50:33.600 --> 2:50:39.600]  He doesn't like newborn babies all being put in Homeland Security illegal database
[2:50:39.600 --> 2:50:45.600]  He doesn't like the fact that the cable boxes have been listening for more than a decade and now watching
[2:50:45.600 --> 2:50:47.600]  He's crazy
[2:50:47.600 --> 2:50:51.600]  It is a big idea, a new world order
[2:50:51.600 --> 2:50:56.600]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[2:50:56.600 --> 2:51:02.600]  It's known as the Bilderberg, but their objective being world domination
[2:51:02.600 --> 2:51:08.600]  For thousands of years their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[2:51:08.600 --> 2:51:13.600]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand
[2:51:13.600 --> 2:51:21.600]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open
[2:51:21.600 --> 2:51:25.600]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda
[2:51:25.600 --> 2:51:28.600]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government
[2:51:28.600 --> 2:51:32.600]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need, they're after power

[2:51:45.600 --> 2:51:53.600]  It's a fact, since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 all banks in these United States create money out of thin air
[2:51:53.600 --> 2:51:58.600]  For every single loan they issue with never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates
[2:51:58.600 --> 2:52:04.600]  It has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors
[2:52:04.600 --> 2:52:10.600]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt
[2:52:10.600 --> 2:52:15.600]  Personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks
[2:52:15.600 --> 2:52:21.600]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment ending with nothing on your credit report
[2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:26.600]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt
[2:52:26.600 --> 2:52:31.600]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around

[2:53:46.600 --> 2:54:02.600]  All right, I didn't do what I said I'd do, but I got into four or five stories and they're all up on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com
[2:54:02.600 --> 2:54:06.600]  Stuff I can't even believe we're not even getting into today
[2:54:06.600 --> 2:54:12.600]  But we'll be back tomorrow and then of course, if you missed any of the guests in the first hour, that's about to restart
[2:54:12.600 --> 2:54:20.600]  We had on the editor, the financial editor of the largest paper in Europe in England and Guardian, incredible info on the economy
[2:54:20.600 --> 2:54:27.600]  Then we had the live extension expert on and then if you missed any of that, it starts over at Infowars.com
[2:54:27.600 --> 2:54:33.600]  And I need your help to get more listeners, not just on the AM and FM dial, shortwave satellite, but also on the web
[2:54:33.600 --> 2:54:39.600]  Perfect way, regardless of where you're at, you may not have an AM or FM station in your area, I just want to reach more people
[2:54:39.600 --> 2:54:45.600]  I want them to know, I want to run out in the street and tell people they take your baby's blood at birth, homeland security
[2:54:45.600 --> 2:54:50.600]  But they've been preconditioned, that's crazy, or your cable box, it's watching you
[2:54:50.600 --> 2:54:55.600]  I remember putting the article out and getting emails going, you're a liar, you're nuts in the dig comments
[2:54:55.600 --> 2:54:59.600]  Alex is crazy, I had links to Google, I had their own quotes
[2:54:59.600 --> 2:55:08.600]  It doesn't matter, they've been trained to be slaves, they put cancer viruses in you, everything, they're killing you
[2:55:08.600 --> 2:55:16.600]  Doesn't matter, I got a badge and a gun, they may have been planning me with cancer, my kids may be drinking fluoride, at least I get to act tough
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:22.600]  Now not all cops are like that, but man, tyranny comes in a uniform, you better wake up
[2:55:22.600 --> 2:55:28.600]  By the way, I haven't plugged any of my sponsors today and that's what makes this show possible, so I hope you remember

[2:58:15.600 --> 2:58:20.600]  We can defeat the globalist if we just admit how wicked they are, it's hard to believe how evil they are
[2:58:20.600 --> 2:58:23.600]  That's why we tend to stand down, stop standing down, stand up
