[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:20.800]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex
[00:20.800 --> 00:29.120]  Jones welcome to the alex jones show this Wednesday July 2nd 2014 I'm David
[00:29.120 --> 00:32.640]  night your host for this hour alex is going to be joining us later in the
[00:32.640 --> 00:38.000]  show and we're also going to have an interview with Harry Dent a economist
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.120]  who is going to talk to us about the metrics of what's happening we've got a
[00:42.120 --> 00:47.440]  pretty high stock market right now the Dow hit 17,000 this week he thinks that's
[00:47.440 --> 00:51.320]  at the top and he's going to talk about what he thinks is next and he's not the
[00:51.320 --> 00:55.240]  only one who's talking about that we've got Donald Trump saying that Americans
[00:55.240 --> 00:59.800]  need to prepare for financial ruin but he's going to be joining us later in
[00:59.800 --> 01:03.040]  the show of course yesterday we had Peter Van Buren who was talking about the
[01:03.040 --> 01:09.760]  ghost of Tom Jude essentially a retelling of the depression era story of
[01:09.760 --> 01:13.880]  grapes of wrath putting that in the context of not the dust bowl but the
[01:13.880 --> 01:17.360]  rust belt so that was kind of a fictional take on it today we're going to
[01:17.360 --> 01:20.760]  have someone who's going to talk to us about the economics of it about the
[01:20.760 --> 01:25.200]  metrics of it we have a couple of stories that are breaking you know even as
[01:25.200 --> 01:29.720]  I was driving into work today even PBS is talking about health concerns at the
[01:29.720 --> 01:35.280]  border as the border collapses and we see anyone and everyone coming in as we
[01:35.280 --> 01:39.160]  see people being held in very close quarters and conditions that are less
[01:39.160 --> 01:43.560]  than ideal for sanity we see that even they're talking about it but of course
[01:43.560 --> 01:46.920]  they're downplaying the risk they're talking about it because they want to
[01:46.920 --> 01:51.280]  reassure people that there's not any risk well there actually is and you know
[01:51.280 --> 01:54.560]  as we interviewed people over the weekend we were told by border patrol
[01:54.560 --> 01:59.360]  agents and there's a story that's still up on drudge today two more swine flu
[01:59.360 --> 02:03.240]  cases confirmed among minor detainees and other two treated for flu like
[02:03.240 --> 02:07.600]  symptoms this is Don Salazar story we talked to border patrol agents there
[02:07.600 --> 02:11.520]  they were very concerned border patrol agents are testing positive for some of
[02:11.520 --> 02:15.920]  these diseases not just H1N1 but other diseases that are coming in they
[02:15.920 --> 02:21.000]  contacted the CDC and the CDC said that's not our job clearly they're not
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.800]  worried about it but they are worried enough about it to essentially tell the
[02:24.800 --> 02:28.240]  government mouthpieces and the mainstream media to start reassuring the
[02:28.240 --> 02:31.440]  public that don't worry that we're not going to open the door to a pandemic or
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.840]  maybe to terrorism or to drug cartels it's just for the children that were
[02:35.840 --> 02:40.800]  collapsing the borders also up today we've got a story a further breakdown of
[02:40.800 --> 02:46.360]  what happened with Facebook as people discovered that they were part of a very
[02:46.360 --> 02:52.080]  large experiment to see if Facebook with its massive reach could manipulate the
[02:52.080 --> 02:56.000]  public's mood answer yes they can but there's a little bit more to that
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.600]  actually they're linked to Pentagon research on civil unrest is a story
[03:00.600 --> 03:05.280]  that's up on info wars Steve Watson points out that the research appears to
[03:05.280 --> 03:08.920]  be at least in part connected to a Pentagon led project called the Minerva
[03:08.920 --> 03:12.720]  initiative so we're gonna break that down for you and the connections there at
[03:12.720 --> 03:16.280]  Cornell University but there's a huge story that's coming out of course
[03:16.280 --> 03:23.320]  a bill has been introduced in California California is AB 1014 label the most
[03:23.320 --> 03:28.040]  draconian gun control legislation in the country this is a bill that would
[03:28.040 --> 03:34.840]  allow the police to confiscate guns based on accusation alone based on
[03:34.840 --> 03:41.400]  accusation alone now this is something that ought to concern everyone not just
[03:41.400 --> 03:46.280]  people who favor gun control this is something that even the people who
[03:46.280 --> 03:50.640]  favor gun control should say should be concerned about this because this is
[03:50.640 --> 03:55.920]  another area where they're gutting due process and real trials it's another
[03:55.920 --> 04:01.640]  area where we're moving into a kind of a star chamber legal system you know we
[04:01.640 --> 04:05.840]  have the FISA court that's not a real court it's just a single judge no
[04:05.840 --> 04:11.480]  adversarial relationship there no jury you don't have a jury of your peers
[04:11.480 --> 04:15.560]  before your rights are taken away with this we should be very concerned about
[04:15.560 --> 04:18.960]  things like the FISA court we should be very concerned about things like this
[04:18.960 --> 04:24.160]  California law regardless of the issue whether it's about guns or whatever we
[04:24.160 --> 04:27.720]  should be concerned that people's fundamental rights that their property
[04:27.720 --> 04:32.800]  can be taken away merely by accusation we're gonna be talking more about that
[04:32.800 --> 04:36.520]  and of course at the same time that's happening we learned that on the Wall
[04:36.520 --> 04:41.400]  Street Journal that Janet Yellen the new Fed Commission has this massive
[04:41.400 --> 04:45.400]  security detail surrounding her as if she was a president of the United States
[04:45.400 --> 04:51.080]  that's the double standard we'll be right back stay with us

[08:33.960 --> 08:37.720]  in the show we're also going to have Harry Dent the economist talking to us
[08:37.720 --> 08:41.440]  about what he sees as the challenges ahead of course yesterday we had
[08:41.440 --> 08:46.160]  Peter Van Buren giving us a fictional look at the current situation in America's
[08:46.160 --> 08:51.040]  declines since the 1950s kind of a retelling of the grapes of wrath calls it
[08:51.040 --> 08:57.200]  the ghost of Tom Joed the story of the 99% he looks at the decline since the
[08:57.200 --> 09:04.240]  1950s and of course as we heard Hemingway say in his book the Sun Also Rises
[09:04.240 --> 09:08.080]  one of the characters is asked how he went bankrupt he said well gradually at
[09:08.080 --> 09:12.560]  first and then suddenly and that's the way we believe this is going to roll out
[09:12.560 --> 09:16.160]  things are certainly accelerating we have the collapse of the borders part of
[09:16.160 --> 09:22.200]  the Cloward and Piven strategy strategize back in the 1960s to collapse the
[09:22.200 --> 09:26.720]  United States with a welfare state an entitlement state to rapidly increase
[09:26.720 --> 09:30.480]  that to the point that we could no longer be sustained so they could rebuild
[09:30.480 --> 09:35.160]  on the ruins of America the kind of socialist utopia that they want to see
[09:35.160 --> 09:40.080]  and that is a common recurring theme to see people talking about destroying
[09:40.080 --> 09:44.080]  America so they can rebuild their socialist utopia we went to see America
[09:44.080 --> 09:48.720]  last night by Dinesh D'Souza was an early release its official releases today
[09:48.720 --> 09:52.960]  and that was a common theme you hear that a lot that America has to be
[09:52.960 --> 09:57.040]  destroyed so that we can rebuild something completely different I liked
[09:57.040 --> 09:59.960]  the film I give it a thumbs up I'm going to talk a little bit later though a
[09:59.960 --> 10:03.680]  little bit more qualified about that we went several of us with the info wars
[10:03.680 --> 10:07.440]  went there last night and we uploaded a review that's now up on YouTube
[10:07.440 --> 10:13.000]  Jacari Jackson staff sergeant Joe Biggs kid Daniels and I and my son Travis we
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.440]  all went and we talked to what we saw about that but I wanted to break that
[10:17.440 --> 10:20.480]  down a little bit more because I think there's a little bit more to it you know
[10:20.480 --> 10:26.160]  the movie that I really am anxious to see was the one that they previewed which
[10:26.160 --> 10:31.640]  was about Gary Webb that's coming up in October is called kill the messenger it's
[10:31.640 --> 10:36.320]  played by Jeremy Renner I hope I hope that they're going to really lay out
[10:36.320 --> 10:41.240]  what happened with Iran Contra with the crack cocaine epidemic that the CIA
[10:41.240 --> 10:47.160]  created in LA with freeway Ricky Ross and the murder of Gary Webb not the
[10:47.160 --> 10:51.480]  suicide of Gary Webb you know he was killed I hated to see one of things I
[10:51.480 --> 10:54.600]  didn't like in the Dinesh D'Souza movie was although he talked about Aaron
[10:54.600 --> 10:59.880]  Schwartz he talked about it as if he had been driven to suicide I don't believe
[10:59.880 --> 11:04.960]  that his psychological outlook was one that was conducive to suicide we've
[11:04.960 --> 11:10.120]  seen this so many many times and I don't think that Aaron Schwartz was was
[11:10.120 --> 11:15.560]  driven to suicide Carmen Ortiz the prosecutor there her husband tweeted
[11:15.560 --> 11:20.160]  that they had offered him a deal not a 35-year in prison but just a few months
[11:20.160 --> 11:23.760]  and he turned that down he was a fighter he was every bit as much of a fighter as
[11:23.760 --> 11:29.000]  Dinesh D'Souza and if Dinesh D'Souza suddenly commits suicide I'm not going
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.760]  to believe that either I think you ought to see this movie I think there's a lot
[11:32.760 --> 11:36.120]  to talk about it talks about real substantive stuff I mean go to see it
[11:36.120 --> 11:40.840]  instead of transformers I mean you'll be talking about transformers and asking
[11:40.840 --> 11:44.280]  yourself and everybody that saw it what was that about if you do go waste your
[11:44.280 --> 11:47.320]  money on that but this is something that's real this is something that you
[11:47.320 --> 11:50.640]  can talk about and of course you're not going to agree with everything he has to
[11:50.640 --> 11:54.880]  say because it's politics and nobody agrees totally on politics just like they
[11:54.880 --> 11:59.680]  don't agree on religion now we have a key story that's up on info wars calm
[11:59.680 --> 12:05.320]  today a bill would allow the police to confiscate guns based on accusations
[12:05.320 --> 12:11.440]  alone this is California's bill AB 1014 label the most draconian gun control
[12:11.440 --> 12:16.280]  legislation in the country they would allow the police to confiscate a person's
[12:16.280 --> 12:21.800]  firearms solely on the basis of an accusation made against the gun owner by
[12:21.800 --> 12:26.960]  a family member or a health professional so that's one of the dangerous
[12:26.960 --> 12:33.200]  things that we did in the wake of some of these mass shootings people on the
[12:33.200 --> 12:38.400]  right started saying hey we need to give the psychological community power over
[12:38.400 --> 12:44.720]  our lives that is insane that's really insane and people even people who
[12:44.720 --> 12:49.400]  support gun control should be concerned about this because of the loss of due
[12:49.400 --> 12:56.200]  process in so many areas of our lives we are seeing due process thrown under the
[12:56.200 --> 13:01.560]  bus shredded destroyed whether it's the NDA or whether it's things like this we
[13:01.560 --> 13:07.360]  need to have an adversarial trial we need to have a real trial with a judge
[13:07.360 --> 13:12.560]  with somebody representing the other other side we need to have a jury we've
[13:12.560 --> 13:18.360]  pretty much lost jury trials they've used threats and and escalated the charges
[13:18.360 --> 13:21.920]  so much that most people don't go with the jury trial and part of that is
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.200]  because the judges have been lying to the juries about what their real power
[13:26.200 --> 13:30.960]  and their responsibility is we need fully informed juries who understand that
[13:30.960 --> 13:34.960]  they're not there just to judge the facts of the law they're there to judge the
[13:34.960 --> 13:39.680]  law itself we have many state constitutions that say that explicitly
[13:39.680 --> 13:44.760]  and it is implied in all of the history of English common law that that is the
[13:44.760 --> 13:49.080]  responsibility of juries we have to watch each other's backs that's where
[13:49.080 --> 13:54.080]  the people have their greatest power in veto and that is in vetoing laws that's
[13:54.080 --> 13:58.440]  one of the ways that we stopped alcohol prohibition even before they repeal that
[13:58.440 --> 14:02.160]  amendment so this is something that ought to concern everybody and here's an
[14:02.160 --> 14:07.160]  example that's given out of the out of the article if for example person A goes
[14:07.160 --> 14:11.760]  to a judge and files a complaint about person B person B can then have his or
[14:11.760 --> 14:18.000]  her guns and gun rights taken away without any idea why or to even have a
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.640]  chance to plead their case do you really want to throw due process away to that
[14:23.640 --> 14:28.360]  extent only after law enforcement search person B their family friends place of
[14:28.360 --> 14:31.520]  work anywhere else that police might have thought person B would hide guns
[14:31.520 --> 14:35.800]  with that person then have the right to defend themselves you would be guilty
[14:35.800 --> 14:43.560]  until proven innocent you know we've seen that happen with all of the regulatory
[14:43.560 --> 14:48.560]  agencies they all operate under this civil idea that because they're going
[14:48.560 --> 14:52.480]  to file a quote-unquote civil action against you whether it's the IRS or the
[14:52.480 --> 14:57.400]  EPA or the Bureau of Land Management or whoever it is all of these organizations
[14:57.400 --> 15:03.880]  that have been created the Congress has essentially abdicated their legislative
[15:03.880 --> 15:09.520]  responsibilities to these groups these fiefdoms these bureaucracies they create
[15:09.520 --> 15:14.080]  their own internal courts where you are guilty and have to prove your innocence
[15:14.080 --> 15:18.920]  they even have in many cases now their own police that they're heavily army we
[15:18.920 --> 15:23.240]  need to be very concerned about this trend in America and look at this
[15:23.240 --> 15:27.440]  hypocrisy we see the Wall Street Journal reporting that the security detail for
[15:27.440 --> 15:32.720]  Fed chairwoman irks her neighbors this is Janet Yellen they said one of the most
[15:32.720 --> 15:35.960]  powerful economic policymakers in the world moved to the neighborhood and
[15:35.960 --> 15:40.200]  ruined it according to many they say the neighbors said earlier this year the
[15:40.200 --> 15:43.640]  security detail protecting new Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen
[15:43.640 --> 15:48.920]  barreled through the cul-de-sac where she lives and oversized vans loaded with
[15:48.920 --> 15:54.160]  guns cameras and takeout pizza it established an armed camp they said
[15:54.160 --> 15:59.320]  next door to Mrs. Foreman's town home according to a written bill of grievance
[15:59.320 --> 16:03.280]  presented by concerned neighbors demanding that the uniformed police
[16:03.280 --> 16:07.920]  presence is uncomfortable for residents of various religious persuasions like
[16:07.920 --> 16:11.280]  Quakers but listen to some of the things that they do they had said security
[16:11.280 --> 16:18.360]  trucks weighing approximately 7,000 pounds each set idling on the street for
[16:18.360 --> 16:21.960]  approximately 22 minutes each day as she's getting ready for her morning
[16:21.960 --> 16:26.520]  pickup and then of course they race out along with their secret service police
[16:26.520 --> 16:31.600]  the government is paying $5,000 or $6,000 a month or more to rent an
[16:31.600 --> 16:36.600]  entire town home in Georgetown to put the cops in now this picture that's at
[16:36.600 --> 16:41.520]  the top of the article has a card stuck in the window that says federal
[16:41.520 --> 16:48.760]  reserve police on official business yeah we're offering the kind of protection
[16:48.760 --> 16:53.280]  to this private corporation the head of this private corporation the Federal
[16:53.280 --> 17:00.640]  Reserve is not federal it is private and this bankster this gangster is getting
[17:00.640 --> 17:05.000]  security from the feds like she's the president of the vice president we
[17:05.000 --> 17:08.800]  didn't provide this kind of security probably to the president before World
[17:08.800 --> 17:14.720]  War two and now look at what we do for our banker in chief now as we're talking
[17:14.720 --> 17:18.240]  about prohibition and what they're doing what they're trying to do with guns we
[17:18.240 --> 17:22.920]  should remember how this turned out with alcohol prohibition we should remember
[17:22.920 --> 17:27.360]  how it turned out with marijuana prohibition for example look at this
[17:27.360 --> 17:32.080]  report from Liberty Crier says six months of legal marijuana and Colorado
[17:32.080 --> 17:36.960]  has more cash and less crime now they point out that there's been a 10%
[17:36.960 --> 17:42.960]  decrease in overall crime from the last year in Colorado and a 5.2% drop in
[17:42.960 --> 17:48.360]  violent crime they have taken in ten million dollars in taxes in just ten
[17:48.360 --> 17:57.320]  months guess what we can handle freedom we can handle marijuana and guns what we
[17:57.320 --> 18:02.640]  can't handle is prohibition because prohibition gives a monopoly to the worst
[18:02.640 --> 18:08.240]  elements of society to organized crime that's why you got a lot a lot of law
[18:08.240 --> 18:11.960]  enforcement against prohibition I've talked many times that organization
[18:11.960 --> 18:17.480]  leap we've interviewed him them on the nightly news on the radio here they're
[18:17.480 --> 18:22.920]  against prohibition because prohibition itself is a problem it destroys
[18:22.920 --> 18:28.880]  society it increases crime and you're going to see crime increase a lot if you
[18:28.880 --> 18:34.200]  prohibit guns even more so than the prohibition of marijuana you're going to
[18:34.200 --> 18:40.920]  see guns take a new and virulent form as they're released into a free black
[18:40.920 --> 18:45.040]  market you're going to see design take off just like you've seen in alcohol
[18:45.040 --> 18:49.360]  prohibition the increase in the concentration of alcohol just as you
[18:49.360 --> 18:53.840]  saw in all drug prohibition the increase in concentration even in marijuana
[18:53.840 --> 19:00.280]  they increased it during prohibition and of course news has also come out this
[19:00.280 --> 19:03.920]  is interesting this is up on info wars.com for former Arizona governor
[19:03.920 --> 19:10.080]  Gary Johnson is now becoming the CEO of a pot company he says I'm excited about
[19:10.080 --> 19:16.080]  this I think this is really a change in the world kind of thing the company is
[19:16.080 --> 19:20.920]  going to be Nevada based it's cannabis sativa or sativa I don't know how to

[19:48.040 --> 19:53.000]  Gerald Salenty and others it is accelerating and we need to be aware of
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.760]  what's going on and we need to take precautions it could be right back and

[24:23.680 --> 24:28.880]  joining us live in the studio to cover news as well as to interview Harry Dent
[24:28.880 --> 24:33.200]  on the economy there's a lot of economic news that's popped out in the last
[24:33.200 --> 24:37.480]  couple of days of course we know that the border collapses part of a planned
[24:37.480 --> 24:42.000]  economic collapse of America but it's not just there that is happening we're
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.240]  going to see some massive new taxes everywhere that are going to be rolling
[24:46.240 --> 24:51.040]  out one of those is coming in the form of highway taxes as reported just last
[24:51.040 --> 24:58.160]  week we see all of these mainstream media outlets talking about a 12 cent hike
[24:58.160 --> 25:04.600]  in the federal gas tax a 12 cent hike it's not a 12 cent hike right now the
[25:04.600 --> 25:09.640]  federal to gas tax is 18 cents per gallon so if you add 12 cents to that
[25:09.640 --> 25:16.720]  you're doing a 67% increase in federal taxes now Obama released this plan
[25:16.720 --> 25:22.120]  yesterday it's a very large plan he says his highway plan is not crazy it's not
[25:22.120 --> 25:26.680]  socialism and it's not an imperial presidency well actually it's going to
[25:26.680 --> 25:30.920]  be a lot of corporate cronyism it's going to be a lot of corporate fascism
[25:30.920 --> 25:35.200]  economic fascism but there is a socialist aspect of it even though they're
[25:35.200 --> 25:40.640]  going to increase all of these taxes a lot of these taxes are not going to be
[25:40.640 --> 25:44.040]  going to your roads and to your bridges they're going to be building the
[25:44.040 --> 25:48.640]  socialist dream and that is light rail commuter trains that sort of thing
[25:48.640 --> 25:56.000]  here's a clip from Obama it's not crazy it's not socialism
[25:56.000 --> 26:07.280]  yeah it's not yeah the imperial presidency or no laws are broken we're
[26:07.280 --> 26:11.480]  just building roads and bridges like we've been doing for the last I don't
[26:11.480 --> 26:20.360]  know 50 a hundred years yeah right it's also not a 12 cent bump it is a 67%
[26:20.360 --> 26:25.080]  bump in gas lane taxes and that's not the only place where they're going up on
[26:25.080 --> 26:31.000]  things we got a article on infowars.com from zero hedge it says interest on new
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.240]  student loans are is going to rise by 20% starting July the first all new
[26:37.240 --> 26:46.400]  loans for the 2013-2014 student year will increase from 3.86% to 4.66% and
[26:46.400 --> 26:51.840]  he does the math he actually does math that's a 20% increase but see the
[26:51.840 --> 26:56.160]  mainstream media would present that to you say that's less than a penny what
[26:56.160 --> 26:59.640]  they're doing is look at this in the context of what's happening at the
[26:59.640 --> 27:04.760]  border they're opening the border they're offering either in-state tuition to
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.400]  illegal citizens as John Brown calls them and that's a good way to put it
[27:08.400 --> 27:12.840]  because of course as he said they they're illegal but they get all of the
[27:12.840 --> 27:15.840]  benefits of citizens actually they get even more benefits and citizens
[27:15.840 --> 27:20.120]  citizens can't go to another state that they haven't lived in and get in-state
[27:20.120 --> 27:25.120]  tuition but the illegal citizens can they can even get full ride tuition at
[27:25.120 --> 27:29.240]  many of these places now if you're an American citizen if you're a legal
[27:29.240 --> 27:34.720]  citizen then you're going to have to essentially work for these banksters the
[27:34.720 --> 27:38.120]  rest of your life because even if you go bankrupt you're not going to be able
[27:38.120 --> 27:41.960]  to get rid of this student debt but of course there is a way for you to get out
[27:41.960 --> 27:47.440]  and that is if you will pledge to do indentured servitude to the federal
[27:47.440 --> 27:52.360]  government to Washington people are catching on you know Obama just came
[27:52.360 --> 27:56.680]  out in a Quinnipiac poll that voters think he's the worst president since
[27:56.680 --> 28:02.480]  1945 33% of the voters think that Obama is worse than any other president since
[28:02.480 --> 28:08.960]  World War two George Bush came in second at 28% third place was Richard Nixon and
[28:08.960 --> 28:14.520]  he was at 13% Jimmy Carter was at 8% you know there's something else that people
[28:14.520 --> 28:19.120]  can agree on and this is a very good sign 74% of Americans don't believe that
[28:19.120 --> 28:25.760]  they have to give up privacy for security that is a false trade just like
[28:25.760 --> 28:30.280]  giving up your liberty for security if you give up your liberty for security
[28:30.280 --> 28:35.480]  you will never have any security slaves don't have security to the extent that
[28:35.480 --> 28:40.440]  you give up your liberty to that extent you become a slave and if you give up
[28:40.440 --> 28:44.240]  all of your liberty you live in a prison it's called maximum security and so now
[28:44.240 --> 28:47.960]  people have been have been told that for a long time they need to trade off
[28:47.960 --> 28:51.480]  liberty for security and so many people buy that because they've been
[28:51.480 --> 28:55.360]  propagandized about that for so long but they haven't been propagandized about
[28:55.360 --> 29:00.200]  this privacy issue for very long and the encouraging thing about this is that
[29:00.200 --> 29:05.840]  this is across all seven political categorizations of the Pew Research
[29:05.840 --> 29:10.720]  Center that took this poll and let's look at these different ones that the
[29:10.720 --> 29:16.840]  highest one was the hard-pressed skeptics that was 83% the lowest ones were
[29:16.840 --> 29:22.280]  tied for the next generation left and the faith and family left they only
[29:22.280 --> 29:29.760]  agreed at 66% I thought that we all I thought the left was unified that we
[29:29.760 --> 29:34.120]  all have a right to privacy oh I'm sorry that's just what they mean when they
[29:34.120 --> 29:38.520]  say abortions they don't really want you to have real privacy but at least
[29:38.520 --> 29:43.880]  even there a majority 66% don't want to see that trade-off we're gonna be right
[29:43.880 --> 29:49.080]  back with more news and that review about America Dinesh D'Souza we're on the

[33:41.600 --> 33:46.560]  money is going to be redistributed to crony capitalist to a kind of fascism
[33:46.560 --> 33:52.200]  but it's also going to be reallocated to things other than roads and bridges for
[33:52.200 --> 33:55.320]  the cars and the drivers who are paying those highway taxes a lot of that's
[33:55.320 --> 34:00.440]  going to be redirected to these pet projects these crony core capitalism
[34:00.440 --> 34:06.040]  projects to put in light rail and of course they're also going up on student
[34:06.040 --> 34:10.880]  loans by 20% those are just some of the economic issues things are accelerating
[34:10.880 --> 34:15.440]  Alex Jones is going to be in the show live in studio he's going to go over
[34:15.440 --> 34:18.160]  some of the news that's coming up and I know he's going to have a lot to say
[34:18.160 --> 34:22.800]  about this new California bill that would allow police to confiscate guns
[34:22.800 --> 34:30.000]  just based on accusation shredding the whole idea of due process now last night

[35:50.680 --> 35:55.200]  us with the Info War crew went there last night a Jakari Jackson kid Daniels
[35:55.200 --> 36:01.360]  and I Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs my son we gave our take on it on a iPhone just as
[36:01.360 --> 36:06.000]  we stepped outside the movie theater as I've thought about it more I wanted to
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.200]  kind of I gave it a thumbs up I like it I would recommend that you go to see it
[36:10.200 --> 36:15.000]  we need to support independent film we need to support a variety of voices who
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.800]  are going to give us a different take on things than the Michael Morris of the
[36:18.800 --> 36:24.280]  world than Hollywood we need that other conversation in there and there's some
[36:24.280 --> 36:27.640]  very good things about this movie I thought the production values were
[36:27.640 --> 36:31.960]  excellent as Darren McBreen said the Fox News crowd is going to love their
[36:31.960 --> 36:36.640]  worldview on it it's very Republican very GOP but just like religion and
[36:36.640 --> 36:39.800]  politics there's a lot of disagreement that people are going to have about a
[36:39.800 --> 36:44.360]  lot of different issues one of the strongest things that he had in there
[36:44.360 --> 36:49.480]  was his take on Saul Alinsky his exposition of Saul Alinsky that's very
[36:49.480 --> 36:55.120]  good and if you've got somebody in school if you've got family or children
[36:55.120 --> 37:01.200]  who are in college or somebody that's even in government school his take on
[37:01.200 --> 37:06.080]  Howard Zen and Howard Zen's revisionist history of America that was really the
[37:06.080 --> 37:11.000]  main thrust of the movie in my opinion it was really kind of the academic world
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.480]  in which Dinesh D'Souza really kind of stays for the most part and so that was
[37:14.480 --> 37:18.360]  what he was most concerned about and that was how American history was being
[37:18.360 --> 37:23.960]  changed by Howard Zen and others to try to make us collectively feel guilty
[37:23.960 --> 37:28.040]  because that's a way that they can essentially take down our system of
[37:28.040 --> 37:32.120]  government and at that level he's very right that whole premise is is a very
[37:32.120 --> 37:36.680]  strong premise that we don't want to destroy America and rebuild this
[37:36.680 --> 37:39.760]  socialist paradise and that's the motivation with Howard Zen and many
[37:39.760 --> 37:43.720]  these other people but I think that's also a weakness of the film and that it
[37:43.720 --> 37:49.520]  ignores the police state it ignores what George Bush did when he looks at these
[37:49.520 --> 37:54.120]  various criticisms from the academic left when he looks at the criticisms
[37:54.120 --> 37:58.560]  about slavery when he looks at the criticisms about what how the Indians
[37:58.560 --> 38:01.600]  were treated when he looks at the criticisms about what we're doing with
[38:01.600 --> 38:07.880]  the military industrial complex his defense I thought really fell flat when
[38:07.880 --> 38:13.680]  he talks about slavery it was essentially talking about how the other
[38:13.680 --> 38:17.880]  countries of the world historically and all other countries have had slaves
[38:17.880 --> 38:24.960]  that just doesn't do it it's not enough to say everybody does it we need to
[38:24.960 --> 38:30.000]  condemn it without any reservations categorically and we need to move on
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.280]  where he got it right we're in quotes like from Bono where he talked about
[38:34.280 --> 38:40.960]  the ideals of America that America was essentially an idea and that's what we
[38:40.960 --> 38:44.920]  need to take away from the founders the founders had a wonderful idea of
[38:44.920 --> 38:50.840]  building a country based on individual liberty and certain inalienable rights
[38:50.840 --> 38:55.760]  now they were less than perfect people there was hypocrisy in what they did
[38:55.760 --> 39:00.040]  there was contradiction in what they did we don't need to make excuses for that
[39:00.040 --> 39:05.160]  we can condemn that and still embrace the ideal part of what they did was to
[39:05.160 --> 39:09.920]  give us a system of government of checks and balances that came from their
[39:09.920 --> 39:14.000]  Christian understanding of the fallen nature of man that man is inherently
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.280]  evil because we're not angels we cannot give absolute power to people in
[39:18.280 --> 39:22.440]  government and so they created a system of checks and balances both within the
[39:22.440 --> 39:26.240]  central government and outside of the central government against the central
[39:26.240 --> 39:29.440]  government to balance it in multiple ways because the thing they were most
[39:29.440 --> 39:34.440]  concerned about was consolidation now the tact that Dinesh D'Souza and many
[39:34.440 --> 39:38.960]  conservatives take and this is what I didn't talk about in the review is to
[39:38.960 --> 39:42.880]  counter balance these founders who owned slaves at the beginning of the
[39:42.880 --> 39:48.440]  republic to try to counter them by making Abraham Lincoln into some kind of
[39:48.440 --> 39:55.840]  a a liberating saint to do a hagiography on him and there was far too much naive
[39:55.840 --> 40:00.560]  stuff in there about Abraham Lincoln if you want to know about Abraham Lincoln
[40:00.560 --> 40:04.640]  look up the real Abraham Lincoln by Thomas de Lorenzo or Lincoln the man
[40:04.640 --> 40:10.200]  there's many historical books that point out what happened during the civil war
[40:10.200 --> 40:15.600]  Lincoln destroyed due process he gave us an income tax he gave us a draft we had
[40:15.600 --> 40:19.560]  some of the biggest riots we've ever had in this country he was opposed by many
[40:19.560 --> 40:24.280]  the abolitionists who had supported abolition they said they opposed what
[40:24.280 --> 40:30.800]  Abraham Lincoln was doing that does not balance or justify what happened with
[40:30.800 --> 40:36.800]  these slaves from the founders we don't we don't have to rely on having some
[40:36.800 --> 40:41.600]  kind of a saint replace these initial founders we need to understand that the
[40:41.600 --> 40:47.200]  system itself needs to be reformed in some areas but it's not bad based on
[40:47.200 --> 40:52.720]  evil men or less than perfect men and so we don't need to create a false version
[40:52.720 --> 40:56.960]  of Abraham Lincoln in order to move this country forward that was my biggest
[40:56.960 --> 41:02.600]  criticism of it I was very disappointed to see just the lockstep embrace of what
[41:02.600 --> 41:07.320]  happened in Iraq Afghanistan Vietnam all these continual wars that we've had
[41:07.320 --> 41:12.160]  after World War two not recognizing this this is being driven by the military
[41:12.160 --> 41:15.720]  industrial complex to say that we didn't make any money off of Vietnam that we
[41:15.720 --> 41:19.160]  didn't make any money off of Iraq no there were people who made a lot of
[41:19.160 --> 41:23.720]  money off of those wars they're called the military industrial complex we
[41:23.720 --> 41:29.640]  don't need to excuse it based on that those were excusable lies that were
[41:29.640 --> 41:32.880]  told in the American public a lot of people who are compartmentalized went
[41:32.880 --> 41:38.120]  and fought in those wars for very noble reasons but they were lied to we just
[41:38.120 --> 41:44.280]  had a congressman come out and say that we need to stop talking about how
[41:44.280 --> 41:48.720]  mistakes were made and talk about how we were lied to Dennis Kasinich said
[41:48.720 --> 41:53.640]  that he said that in the Huffington Post in the very next day Harry Reid comes
[41:53.640 --> 41:58.360]  out and said mistakes were made on Iraq no we need to own up to our mistakes we
[41:58.360 --> 42:02.200]  need to own up to the fact that we were lied to about Iraq we need to own up to
[42:02.200 --> 42:06.400]  the fact that slavery was wrong not making excuses for it and understand
[42:06.400 --> 42:10.520]  that even the people who gave us that system of government the founders were
[42:10.520 --> 42:14.640]  less than perfect but that doesn't take away from the ideas of individual
[42:14.640 --> 42:19.040]  liberty and freedom when I went to Bilderberg and was talking to people
[42:19.040 --> 42:23.200]  there in Copenhagen we were talking about how the Constitution had essentially
[42:23.200 --> 42:27.320]  been a just a dead letter a piece of paper according to George Bush as he's
[42:27.320 --> 42:33.120]  reported to have said it's just a blank piece of paper but they said you have
[42:33.120 --> 42:38.520]  something very important that we don't have in Denmark and that is a tradition a
[42:38.520 --> 42:43.240]  history of individual liberty you have a system of government that was based on
[42:43.240 --> 42:46.760]  that and that's something that's very important that we need to hang on to so
[42:46.760 --> 42:50.480]  I would still recommend that you go see the film but I would also recommend that
[42:50.480 --> 42:53.840]  you spend a little bit of time and learn about Abraham Lincoln and not try to
[42:53.840 --> 42:58.880]  justify what the wrongs that other people have done by creating a false
[42:58.880 --> 43:04.480]  hagiography about Abraham Lincoln now there's a story this breaking today
[43:04.480 --> 43:10.760]  HHS bars a congressman in Oklahoma from seeing immigrant children as we've
[43:10.760 --> 43:14.600]  talked about many times there is an opacity about what's going on they're
[43:14.600 --> 43:18.800]  trying to keep this secret they're barring even congressmen from going in
[43:18.800 --> 43:22.920]  this is Jim Bridenstein Republican of Oklahoma he said what are they trying to
[43:22.920 --> 43:27.240]  hide do they not want the children to speak with members of Congress as a
[43:27.240 --> 43:30.600]  Navy pilot I've been involved in operations countering illicit human
[43:30.600 --> 43:35.120]  trafficking I would like to know to whom these children are being released
[43:35.120 --> 43:41.120]  that's a very good point are they being held and released into a human trafficking
[43:41.120 --> 43:45.200]  operation because that happens in America as well he said the security guards
[43:45.200 --> 43:48.760]  would not even let him in he says what kind of a country do we have when even a
[43:48.760 --> 43:52.320]  congressman can't see what's going on and that's what we ran into when our
[43:52.320 --> 43:57.040]  reporters went down to the Nancy Pelosi photo op that happened this last
[43:57.040 --> 44:02.280]  Saturday here's a clip of what happened to Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs as Michael
[44:02.280 --> 44:06.000]  Savage talks about it what the real media is doing I believe in America I
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.320]  believe in the rule of law I believe in borders I believe in language I believe
[44:09.320 --> 44:14.040]  in culture and I am sick and tired of seeing illegitimate illegal aliens
[44:14.040 --> 44:18.080]  running all over my country and running all over Congress and rioting and
[44:18.080 --> 44:22.880]  screaming for what they want why don't we riot why don't we go to a Durban's
[44:22.880 --> 44:26.640]  office and tell them what we think of him it would only take small groups of
[44:26.640 --> 44:31.360]  50 people at any time to start screaming at any congressman a senator
[44:31.360 --> 44:36.200]  wherever they may go groups of 50 that's all it would take you'd get your way I
[44:36.200 --> 44:40.160]  can guarantee you I didn't say hurt anybody that's the last thing you want
[44:40.160 --> 44:45.080]  to do if they'll let illegal aliens break into Congress and start screaming
[44:45.080 --> 44:50.360]  and then spewing hatred demanding amnesty for 30 million illegal aliens
[44:50.360 --> 44:56.200]  why don't you let Durban know Feinstein know Boxer know Pelosi know you know
[44:56.200 --> 45:01.200]  someone tried this from it was from Info Wars over the weekend oh we have a
[45:01.200 --> 45:05.200]  wonderful sound bite one of their reporters try to talk to Ms. Pelosi the
[45:05.200 --> 45:09.960]  Imperius they wouldn't let her near they wouldn't let him near her they said he
[45:09.960 --> 45:14.360]  wasn't a designated journalist do we have that sound bite I do I know we do he
[45:14.360 --> 45:20.040]  went up to her and it's Joe Biggs from Prison Planet in clip number two listen
[45:20.040 --> 45:23.240]  to this and here we are that's the question I asked I didn't get much of a
[45:23.240 --> 45:28.000]  response kind of put her head down and rushed out of here in her convoy but
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.800]  it's kind of funny the spot she picked if you look we got the swing set there's
[45:31.800 --> 45:34.880]  a school in the background because like she said during the conference that it's
[45:34.880 --> 45:39.320]  all about the children this humanitarian crisis is all about the children but when
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.480]  I spoke to the vice president of the border patrol border patrol unit two
[45:43.480 --> 45:48.760]  days ago he said that the cartels were using these children as a beard and what
[45:48.760 --> 45:52.600]  was happening was we're pulling these war patrol agents off our borders and
[45:52.600 --> 45:58.000]  allowing these other you can see that full clip of Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs
[45:58.000 --> 46:03.040]  up on our YouTube channel that's what happens when we go and try to confront
[46:03.040 --> 46:06.600]  people and ask real questions she had a photo op I don't think she even took
[46:06.600 --> 46:10.640]  questions and that's what outraged Michael Savage and it's even worse than
[46:10.640 --> 46:14.080]  that we see congressmen who are not allowed to have access who are not
[46:14.080 --> 46:18.240]  allowed to know what's happening to these children are they being turned over to
[46:18.240 --> 46:22.840]  a child trafficking operation he says any member of Congress this is the
[46:22.840 --> 46:27.120]  congressman from Oklahoma Jim Bridenstine he said any member of Congress
[46:27.120 --> 46:31.040]  should have the legal authority to visit a federal youth detention facility
[46:31.040 --> 46:36.480]  without waiting three weeks now joining us in the studio is Alex Jones welcome
[46:36.480 --> 46:40.600]  back Alex great to have you here David I took off a week to spend time with a
[46:40.600 --> 46:45.840]  family you know over the years I tend to not ever take off and then I get more
[46:45.840 --> 46:51.360]  and more frantic on air and more and more wild which I guess has its place but
[46:51.360 --> 46:54.600]  it's good for me to take off so I did take off and it gives you a lot of
[46:54.600 --> 47:00.480]  retrospective also you can pull back and see the big picture and so I've got a
[47:00.480 --> 47:03.840]  lot of important things to talk about in the second and third hour today again my
[47:03.840 --> 47:09.280]  flight back into the United States was canceled once it got into Houston last
[47:09.280 --> 47:13.920]  night the flight from Houston back in to Austin once I got back into the US and
[47:13.920 --> 47:17.800]  so that was canceled by about one in the morning so I got about five in the
[47:17.800 --> 47:21.480]  morning and then that was held back and then we finally got here about an hour
[47:21.480 --> 47:25.640]  and a half ago sounds like our trip to Copenhagen yeah nothing yours was even
[47:25.640 --> 47:31.000]  after damn being canceled and they lost our luggage canceled our car yeah yeah
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.640]  you can really see America rotting and I think that's the perspective I want to
[47:35.640 --> 47:42.560]  talk about to recognize how far we've fallen so that we can realize why this
[47:42.560 --> 47:47.280]  has been done and how we turn it around so I've got some pretty heavy issues that
[47:47.280 --> 47:51.680]  obviously dovetails with exactly what you're covering here today because what
[47:51.680 --> 48:00.680]  we're witnessing is tyranny and it's now reached a point as we warn people for
[48:00.680 --> 48:05.400]  so long it would where the bottom falls out and there's no restraint and we are
[48:05.400 --> 48:09.240]  now going to see as the criminology and psychology shows for thousands of years
[48:09.240 --> 48:13.400]  before they had the term psychology out of Germany or Russia or England thousands
[48:13.400 --> 48:17.560]  years ago you know rulers and social engineers knew the systems that control
[48:17.560 --> 48:21.080]  populations we also know the types of elites that are out there throughout
[48:21.080 --> 48:26.200]  history and how they manifest and they start acting out a psychopath that's
[48:26.200 --> 48:31.320]  killed 10 15 20 people starts getting wilder and wilder taunting the police they
[48:31.320 --> 48:35.800]  think they do that a lot operating out in the open set a killing one person
[48:35.800 --> 48:40.120]  every few months starts being two or three a weekend sending them clues so
[48:40.120 --> 48:43.600]  that they can almost want to get caught that's what we see happening with these
[48:43.600 --> 48:48.520]  people absolutely I mean it's a fact that amongst these kids are mules it's a
[48:48.520 --> 48:52.880]  fact they've been using basis forever for drug dealing it's a fact that they
[48:52.880 --> 48:58.160]  every time we try to go to a press conference we show up and the military
[48:58.160 --> 49:03.560]  threatens our reporters and says we'll take your military idea wave you keep
[49:03.560 --> 49:06.920]  coming these were like here's the press release there's a press conference but
[49:06.920 --> 49:09.920]  it isn't a press conference they have these things you notice on federal
[49:09.920 --> 49:13.800]  reservations now yeah the congresswomen criminals like plusy
[49:13.800 --> 49:17.280]  this is an arch terrorist criminal we're literally destroying the country right
[49:17.280 --> 49:21.000]  now and then saying we're racist if we don't want one open borders no one has
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.040]  open borders if we bordered Switzerland they wouldn't be letting us in because we
[49:26.040 --> 49:29.240]  don't have the wealth and things they have and and they would want us on their
[49:29.240 --> 49:33.120]  welfare system this is having one of the most failed countries in the world
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.920]  bordering us with the whole world going into depression I mean Latin America the
[49:37.920 --> 49:42.200]  Caribbean the crime rates are more than doubled on average it's all over the news
[49:42.200 --> 49:48.120]  the travel advisers I just came back from the Caribbean and even the places
[49:48.120 --> 49:52.280]  that have been the some of the better areas with low crime I talked to the
[49:52.280 --> 49:56.920]  police they said no we just don't put it in the newspaper watch out and that was
[49:56.920 --> 50:02.920]  in well I'll talk about it coming up later it's just that the world is being
[50:02.920 --> 50:07.320]  artificially collapsed right now and we're gonna be discussing that I come
[50:07.320 --> 50:10.400]  back and put some bookends on this in this next segment and five into the

[54:21.680 --> 54:25.920]  he's been doing relaxing taking some time with his family as we all need to
[54:25.920 --> 54:31.080]  do and he's going to have a lot to say I'm sure about the massive developments
[54:31.080 --> 54:36.880]  that have happened in the last week or so the collapse of the border the now
[54:36.880 --> 54:41.000]  this new bill in California that's going to do away with any due process for
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.680]  anyone who owns a gun you can just have them seized your rights terminated by
[54:45.680 --> 54:52.160]  mere accusation and not even just by a psychiatrist but it can be done by some
[54:52.160 --> 54:56.800]  family member who doesn't like you anyone you don't have a right to a real
[54:56.800 --> 55:01.760]  trial and we see that happening in area after area after area another story
[55:01.760 --> 55:06.840]  story up on info wars calm privacy and civil liberties board is mostly
[55:06.840 --> 55:12.080]  unconcerned about prism or backbone tapping by the NSA now this is an
[55:12.080 --> 55:18.520]  organization the privacy and civil liberties oversight board PCL OB now
[55:18.520 --> 55:23.400]  if you look up this organization on the web you see that they describe
[55:23.400 --> 55:29.000]  themselves as an independent bipartisan agency within the executive branch well
[55:29.000 --> 55:35.760]  they criticize the 215 bulk data collection efforts but now on this 702
[55:35.760 --> 55:41.080]  program they are essentially saying it's legal it's constitutional and it's
[55:41.080 --> 55:46.000]  effective as a counter-terrorism tool no it's not it's not any of those things
[55:46.000 --> 55:49.960]  it's not constitutional it's not legal and it's not effective to have this
[55:49.960 --> 55:56.800]  prism program as well as dragnet backbone tapping you're not going to see
[55:56.800 --> 56:05.360]  the government agencies stand up and back our individual liberties but people
[56:05.360 --> 56:10.560]  are realizing that that's exactly what is happening is that we're we're losing
[56:10.560 --> 56:18.160]  our privacy on just the promise of security a very encouraging report was
[56:18.160 --> 56:21.920]  one that I just talked about where we had the majority of people in seven
[56:21.920 --> 56:26.840]  different demographic areas said that they would not trade their privacy for
[56:26.840 --> 56:32.480]  security and of course the lowest one was 66 percent with a couple of self
[56:32.480 --> 56:40.800]  described left viewing demographics but across the board it went up to 88% and
[56:40.800 --> 56:44.240]  it was every one of them it was a majority of them realized that this is a
[56:44.240 --> 56:48.940]  false promise that we were being given this is a corrupt hypocritical
[56:48.940 --> 56:52.840]  government we see the border collapsing at the same time they continue to do
[56:52.840 --> 56:58.640]  these rollouts internally spying on us handling us with the TSA now we've got
[56:58.640 --> 57:03.160]  another incident and that is Congress people are now no longer going to have
[57:03.160 --> 57:07.200]  to report travel that is paid for by private groups this is something that
[57:07.200 --> 57:10.680]  was done behind closed doors without a public announcement it was done by the
[57:10.680 --> 57:15.400]  House ethics committee they reversed more than three decades of precedent
[57:15.400 --> 57:18.560]  where it was counted as a gift at the same time they're doing that
[57:18.560 --> 57:23.840]  rule net daily points out that the feds are doing gunpoint searches of private
[57:23.840 --> 57:28.680]  planes to such an extent that one congressman is trying to a rather
[57:28.680 --> 57:33.320]  senator Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma is trying to stop that he's putting
[57:33.320 --> 57:38.240]  in a pilots bill of rights we all have a bill of rights we don't need a pilots
[57:38.240 --> 57:43.280]  bill of rights we need to enforce the bill of rights the Fourth Amendment needs
[57:43.280 --> 57:46.400]  to be enforced let's do that for everybody not just a few people but
[57:46.400 --> 57:50.600]  that shows the hypocrisy doesn't it where you've got Congress now saying that
[57:50.600 --> 57:54.840]  they can accept flights to anywhere and it's no longer an ethics issue but
[57:54.840 --> 57:59.800]  meanwhile anybody with a private plane is going to get gunpoint searches that's
[57:59.800 --> 58:03.960]  what we see rolling out as this tyranny is rolling out one of the ways that you
[58:03.960 --> 58:07.600]  can support this operation one of the ways that you can get this information
[58:07.600 --> 58:12.400]  out there and help to get people on is with the Mulan Lave belt buckles we've
[58:12.400 --> 58:16.400]  got 500 of them it's a limited edition they're not going to last long at the
[58:16.400 --> 58:19.000]  rate that they're moving right now a beautiful buckle it's kind of based on
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.840]  that t-shirt design that we have and just like I was saying about the Dinesh
[58:22.840 --> 58:28.760]  DeSousa movie it's a way to support the alternative media it's a way to increase
[58:28.760 --> 58:32.440]  debate it's something that you can talk to people about they're gonna ask you
[58:32.440 --> 58:35.200]  what what's your belt buckle about they're gonna be sold out in just a
[58:35.200 --> 58:39.200]  few weeks so go to infowarstore.com we'll be right back over the break with
[58:39.200 --> 58:52.040]  Alex Jones live I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was
[58:52.040 --> 58:56.640]  helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify most people know
[58:56.640 --> 59:02.400]  that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world iodine is key to so
[59:02.400 --> 59:06.800]  many of the body's functions especially the thyroid I discovered a product being
[59:06.800 --> 59:12.200]  developed by Dr. Group you now know it as survival shield true nascent iodine
[59:12.200 --> 59:16.000]  that your body can really absorb then about a year ago he said listen if you

[1:00:06.320 --> 1:00:13.640]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[1:00:13.640 --> 1:00:23.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:28.880]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight in this last segment that
[1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:32.680]  I'm going to be on Alex is going to be joining us live in studio he's back from
[1:00:32.680 --> 1:00:36.360]  his well-deserved vacation he's got a lot to talk about I know you're going to
[1:00:36.360 --> 1:00:39.520]  want to hear his take on what's happened in the last week with the collapse of
[1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:43.520]  the border leading as we've been telling you for a very long time as Alex Jones
[1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:48.280]  has been telling you leading to a kind of implosion overloading the entitlement
[1:00:48.280 --> 1:00:53.800]  system this has been gamed by socialist planners for a very long time they want
[1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:58.120]  to destroy the country economically so they can rebuild their socialist paradise
[1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:03.200]  now one of the articles that we had earlier this week was the situation in
[1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:08.320]  Detroit where one of the richest areas in the country as we've gutted the
[1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:12.720]  manufacturing there is now declining into a kind of a third-world state where
[1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:17.280]  people can't even pay their water bills they're having their water cut off by the
[1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:20.480]  thousands now if you look at this article from the LA Times if you look at
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:23.840]  this lady who's at the very top here her name is Nicole Hill she's holding up
[1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:27.720]  past due water bills now one of the things that I didn't talk about because I
[1:01:27.720 --> 1:01:31.800]  got on to how these socialists are working with the bankers to collapse
[1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:35.760]  economies here just like they did in the socialist paradise of Venezuela with
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:40.920]  Hugo Chavez they're bragging about how the bankers got 700% return on their
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:44.640]  investment in Bloomberg you've got Barclay saying even though the people
[1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:48.280]  there don't have water even though they have to leave the country in order to get
[1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:53.480]  medicine that they have their first responsibility is to pay their debt to
[1:01:53.480 --> 1:01:57.680]  the bankers but what I didn't talk about and what I meant to talk about the
[1:01:57.680 --> 1:02:01.440]  other day when I showed this was what comes after the economic collapse what
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:05.840]  are they going to rebuild on top of the ruins well to give you a glimpse let's
[1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:10.080]  look at this person here Nicole Hill who's the person that the LA Times uses
[1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:14.280]  essentially is the example of what's going on she says it's frightening
[1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:17.520]  because you think it's something that only happens somewhere in a third world
[1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:23.880]  country like Africa she is a single mother who is studying homeland security at
[1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:29.160]  a local college do you see how this is breaking down she's a homeland security
[1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:35.160]  major Detroit has been collapsed by socialism into a decaying hulk of what
[1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:40.480]  it formerly was the manufacturing jobs have been sent overseas the people can't
[1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:46.040]  pay for their water bills so what's left they can study to become a part of the
[1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:53.280]  police surveillance state it's homeland security that is running the tyranny
[1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:57.200]  internally in this country that is collapsing the borders it's homeland
[1:02:57.200 --> 1:03:00.440]  security that's doing that and it's homeland security that these people are
[1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:08.360]  going to be working for and Alex did you want to say something okay that's
[1:03:08.360 --> 1:03:12.320]  good I know he's gonna have an eruption I know he's gonna have a lot to say
[1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:15.680]  about that I thought you were coming for the mic but that's what they're going
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:20.880]  to build on the ruins of this country we've seen David Petraeus talking about
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:25.460]  what comes after America North America the North American Union we've seen
[1:03:25.460 --> 1:03:29.320]  Nancy Pelosi saying we have a community north and south it just happens to have
[1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:35.520]  a border running through it they are now making an established fact what they
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:41.360]  passed into law 20 years ago and if you look at the NDAA at indefinite
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:46.760]  detention without trial looking changing the declaring the United States to be a
[1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:50.840]  war zone saying that they're going to enact military law they have done Rex
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:56.680]  87 all of these different plans for decades and now they're going to roll
[1:03:56.680 --> 1:04:01.000]  them out just like they're rolling out NAFTA these people who are coming in
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:06.640]  from Central and South America that is all part of the NAFTA plan and that's
[1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:09.880]  what they're going to do with the police state they enact the laws they let
[1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:13.000]  them sit there for a while if they had immediately started arresting people
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.200]  under the NDAA and holding them indefinitely without trial if they'd
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:19.080]  pass that law and started doing that right away there would have been a
[1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:24.680]  massive resistance against it as it was Obama said I'm gonna sign it but don't
[1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:28.600]  worry I'm not really going to enforce it if they had done the same thing with
[1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:32.000]  NAFTA they'd signed the trade agreement and then immediately collapsed the
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.880]  borders people would have woken up they'd let it sit there for decades now

[1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:08.640]  he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:26.360]  well I only took off six days and it feels like I've been gone a hundred
[1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:34.200]  years and we have had emails flooding in phone calls by the hundreds of
[1:08:34.200 --> 1:08:38.760]  thousands of emails people all over YouTube info wars.com prisonplot.com in
[1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:44.240]  the comments where is Alex where is Alex where is Alex and I tell you I am
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:49.320]  really touched by the fact that every time I take a few days off it becomes a
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:54.440]  big deal with the wonderful listeners and I'm extremely humbled by that and I
[1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:58.800]  mean that I'm extremely humbled by it but I got to say a lot of folks I talked
[1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:03.800]  to when I was even out of the country miss it when I'm gone people come up to
[1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:07.560]  me hey you're not on yesterday I guess you're here where I was in the Caribbean
[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:11.840]  I'll tell you about that coming up but boy David Knight and your crew are just
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:16.960]  doing a wonderful job so you know used to we didn't like it when you were gone
[1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:22.080]  and and we still don't but man what what a great crew you've got what a great
[1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:27.200]  find you have in David Knight but you know David Knight who filled in the
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:31.440]  last hour because everybody I talked to and of course the news was reporting on
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:36.960]  this as well but everybody I talked to says the airlines are just a nightmare
[1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:41.880]  now and it seems like the last year every time I fly it's totally screwed up
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:47.480]  and this time was no different and I'm not going to go into the whole story all
[1:09:47.480 --> 1:09:51.920]  of you I'm sure have your own horror stories it's just that this country is
[1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:58.020]  degenerating and degenerating fast and when you go to Europe or you go even to
[1:09:58.020 --> 1:10:04.640]  third-world countries in the Caribbean and and they're more free than the U.S.
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:09.720]  on so many fronts it really freaks you out at least it does from my
[1:10:09.720 --> 1:10:19.760]  perspective and I've got a lot of mixed feelings concerning this because on the
[1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:29.480]  one hand horrible horrible horrible horrible things are happening but on the
[1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:33.520]  other hand incredibly good things are happening as well the old saying is it's
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:38.120]  got to get bad before it gets better or it's always darkest for the dawn we call
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:44.520]  those cliches because people say them so much because it's true truth is strange
[1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:53.840]  with the fiction it's true misery loves company it's true governments if they
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:59.600]  get big will hurt you and hurt you bad it's true government is dangerous servant
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:04.840]  the fearful master George Washington and America somehow in the last 60 years got
[1:11:04.840 --> 1:11:10.080]  at the point of thinking no no no all that is not true it's crazy to not want
[1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:14.440]  to have a giant government that runs your life it's crazy to think that
[1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:20.280]  government might do something wrong why keep the faith as John Kerry and
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:26.960]  Hillary Clinton and Obama and Michelle but also Hollande and Cameron and I
[1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:30.280]  mean you look at their speeches because I look at hundreds of news articles a
[1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:36.160]  day conservatively let's let's be honest 500 to 600 articles I look at a day
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:45.120]  maybe a hundred I read I'm a news junkie and so I'm sure you're seeing this too
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:48.760]  but these are public speeches it's not like it's hidden where they're saying
[1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:51.960]  keep the faith it's gonna get better government loves you governments the
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:55.400]  answer don't listen to people that say that tyranny's right around the corner
[1:11:55.400 --> 1:12:00.880]  and that government some sinister force it's a force of good no the truth is
[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:05.680]  anything big and unaccountable will manifest the worst traits in humanity
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:10.640]  and will wreck civilizations and will burn cities and put people in slave
[1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:15.200]  camps I don't care if it's the Aztecs I don't care if it's the Babylonians I
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:19.640]  don't care if it's the ancient Druids I don't care if it was the Japanese it's
[1:12:19.640 --> 1:12:23.840]  during some periods or whether it was the North Koreans or whether it was
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:33.000]  Africa it's the same story over and over again Rome and I say this a lot but I
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:40.280]  really want to quantify it before I get into all the news we are in a
[1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:46.340]  progressing tyranny it's progressive like brain cancer malignant cancer it's
[1:12:46.340 --> 1:12:56.280]  metastasized it's blooming right now and unequivocally I can say the people
[1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:00.320]  running things are clearly on a stage massive terror attacks and blame it on
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:06.440]  domestic groups and they are going to try to come arrest a lot of people and
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:14.600]  they really are gonna start a civil war and anybody that doesn't want to go
[1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:18.320]  along with their tyranny they'll have ISIS al Qaeda blow something up and
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:22.840]  claim that their day did it with you and it's real simple people either wake up
[1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:28.040]  to that we've been hijacked and we are honest about it or we're gonna lose
[1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:33.240]  everything and I'm a hundred percent sure that's why every time I end up
[1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:40.240]  taking off a week I realize I should do it more because when I do it's just so
[1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:49.600]  much clear but you don't need a bunch of perception or historical perspectives
[1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:56.280]  or super smarts to look at what's going on not just here but all over the world
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:14:04.120]  under globalist management and to see that they've created a really deviant
[1:14:04.120 --> 1:14:11.080]  sick system and we all study history to a certain extent I mean everybody knows
[1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:16.960]  famous things that have happened in history everybody knows that's another
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:22.600]  cliche but it really is true that a leech kill their own family members marry
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:27.960]  their horses dress up like werewolves and tear children's throats out sacrifice
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:33.880]  children on fiery altars bloody altars have giant wars make everyone worship
[1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:38.920]  them as God and then become so psychopathic they commit suicide and if
[1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:44.360]  you study ancient corrupt societies in Rome you name it though it would end up
[1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:49.360]  basically that if the leader or group of leaders had nuclear weapons they would
[1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:59.560]  detonate them just so they could destroy the earth in the old days if it was
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:04.920]  Nero or it was I forget which a lot of the Aztec kings and Toltecs and Olmecs
[1:15:04.920 --> 1:15:12.600]  they would commit suicide as well that that's what the elites do is they kill
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:17.080]  a bunch of people and do weird stuff I mean everybody knows about the elites
[1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:26.560]  and their word sexual proclivities that are bizarre and believe in the general
[1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:30.720]  public has no idea what goes on in Hollywood no idea what goes on rock and
[1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:36.600]  roll I mean people think they know what the royal family of England's into it's
[1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:43.960]  so horrible ladies and gentlemen that I don't even want to talk about it on air
[1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:49.000]  and you see the general public who thinks they know things are corrupt and bad
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:56.040]  but really just don't have any idea how deep the waters really are
[1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:03.120]  you know I say that it's the best of times the worst of times to quote the
[1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:10.880]  internet the intro passage from a tale of two cities but it is the best of
[1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:18.880]  times and the worst of times and we're coming to the final leg in a downward
[1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:28.840]  spiral cycle that is going to be the most insane out of control mass mental
[1:16:28.840 --> 1:16:38.080]  illness breakdown the world's ever witnessed with a bunch of high tech GMO
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:43.280]  nuclear weapons melting down reactors mass pharmacia drugging of the
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:54.360]  population cultural breakdown societal rot if we don't turn the corner soon
[1:16:54.360 --> 1:17:02.720]  it's going to be earth shaking it's going to be biblical in nature it's
[1:17:02.720 --> 1:17:08.160]  going to be a third of the earth's population dead conservatively and that's
[1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:14.960]  what metrics show not what the Bible says the Bible does say that but when you
[1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:21.640]  come face-to-face with what is now about to unfold the purposed purposeful
[1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:34.040]  provisioned lovingly prepared collapse of civilization agenda 21 on PCP
[1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:43.920]  clowered and piven squared with the globalist who tried to convince us that
[1:17:43.920 --> 1:17:48.120]  none of this was being set up none of this was being prepared don't pay
[1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:56.920]  attention to the man behind the mirror go to sleep and now at the edge of the
[1:17:56.920 --> 1:18:03.520]  precipice all they can use is the incredible goodwill and what was good
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:09.480]  in Christendom and the Renaissance those two things mixing together in Western
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:16.760]  culture they use the good better angels of Western civilization to then
[1:18:16.760 --> 1:18:26.240]  manipulate the good men and women that could stop this in to actually aiding
[1:18:26.240 --> 1:18:32.840]  it through the new religion of political correctness that is a religion of
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:43.560]  societal suicide a cultural national abortion of a full-grown civilization a
[1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:52.440]  murder and when you look at the truly evil people running things they have a
[1:18:52.440 --> 1:18:58.400]  real desire to sink the planet I mean look at what globalist to the third
[1:18:58.400 --> 1:19:01.880]  world countries they've been keeping them in squalor and keeping them down and
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:06.400]  dumbing down their culture forever and they've been doing it to a certain
[1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:11.560]  extent here but wanted strong imperial command bases to launch our programs but
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:17.160]  the age of man is coming to an end and so now humanity has to be pulled down
[1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:22.240]  into the slums and have their food supply cut off so they can be socially
[1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:30.120]  engineered to accept full cultural control and absorption into the eugenics
[1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:39.080]  paradigm of forced population reduction on which an HR Geiger like hellraiser
[1:19:39.080 --> 1:19:45.120]  template will be overlaid I mean they're not gonna kill everybody to build
[1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:50.160]  something beautiful the killing the people is the destination the journey is
[1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:58.640]  the destination the seals of hell the very gates of hell are now being open

[1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:35.560]  welcome back that was kind of a meandering last segment let me try to
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:41.760]  hone it in here and boy a clip of Nancy Pelosi dovetailed with General Petraeus
[1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:48.440]  in a moment but when you study criminology when you study psychology
[1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:56.600]  anthropology it's all really the same the patterns are repeated and whether you
[1:24:56.600 --> 1:25:02.320]  believe in a physical devil or not when we let an authoritarian system come into
[1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:08.480]  place the very worst in the culture will end up migrating into positions of
[1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:13.400]  power and you'll have people low-level even in a corrupt system that will
[1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:19.720]  mitigate some of that because they have humanity and they will basically side
[1:25:19.720 --> 1:25:31.320]  step the fraud they will sidestep the oppression they will let you get out of
[1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:40.880]  the net but once the computerized system goes into place and you have zero
[1:25:40.880 --> 1:25:46.040]  ability to make your own decisions in corporate life religious life private
[1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:52.080]  life governmental systems regulatory systems you are now simply a
[1:25:52.080 --> 1:26:02.840]  biological android a robot that is carrying out the orders it's given and
[1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:07.080]  then you're allowed a little tribal stimulation and some soccer games or
[1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:12.800]  football and you're allowed to have some sex and you're allowed to while the
[1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:17.240]  news is being tightened on the species itself and you're being given binary
[1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:27.600]  weapons binary poisons into your body to kill you down the road and they'll
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:34.640]  even make money out of treating the artificial illness that you were given
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:42.320]  and I think that's really what it all comes down to is 100% there is an
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:46.760]  artificial global scientific dictatorship forming that wants full
[1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:54.000]  control and is getting close and the only way to beat it is to fully admit
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:00.680]  how real it is because again the general public are still good people on
[1:27:00.680 --> 1:27:05.760]  average but are just so ignorant because they're being faced with something so
[1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:13.160]  encompassing and I'm like a monkey in a cage that sees the bars and I'm simply
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:17.720]  trying to get the other creatures around me to realize that we're in an
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:24.880]  artificial system that's becoming more and more artificial all the time whose
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:34.720]  aim is our domination and then our slow bleeding out and destruction the goal
[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:40.320]  is to imprison us the goal is to torture us the goal is to destroy our
[1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:46.720]  families destroy our culture and to render us down that's why good people
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:51.480]  tend to lose in the first three quarters of historical fights against evil
[1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:56.400]  because good just can't believe it's happening because it doesn't make sense
[1:27:56.400 --> 1:28:01.200]  from a perspective of someone that has empathy and that has honor and that
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:06.000]  wants to be loving and that wants to be good to have pure darkness coming
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:13.440]  against you you just can't believe you're lying eyes
[1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:23.880]  but the good news is every metric shows that government and the corporate
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:28.520]  systems that control it are in deep trouble 7% approval rating Gallup for
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:33.840]  Congress 14% approval rating down from 17 just a few months ago for the mainstream
[1:28:33.840 --> 1:28:47.240]  media alternative media highest approval ratings ever meteoric metric rise but
[1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:50.560]  then you have to go to the next level and realize the system knows that and it
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:54.280]  knew that all along and it knew this would be unpopular that's why the
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:57.840]  armored vehicles the tanks the helicopters the checkpoints are coming out
[1:28:57.840 --> 1:29:08.460]  of the box and coming out of the subterranean garages is because they're
[1:29:08.460 --> 1:29:15.640]  taking the gloves off but the average person even that's going to enforce all
[1:29:15.640 --> 1:29:20.640]  this is being decompartmentalized as the gloves come off they're going wait a
[1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:26.280]  minute because the Liberty Movement before we got to this point warned
[1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:31.200]  everyone and was demonized and attacked and the enemy's demonization and
[1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:37.560]  hatred and attack of us actually drew attention to us and it's now boomeranging
[1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:43.000]  back on them so we're at this key flux point right now where this could be
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:48.120]  turned around I want to talk about that when we come back but we can stop this
[1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:55.000]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:57.280]  network

[1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:35.960]  just as sure as the sun came up this morning is gonna set in the evening the
[1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:46.280]  globalist do plan and authoritarian hardcore takeover in this country and
[1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:54.800]  it's a marvel of the enemy shy off that we can be in the middle of a global
[1:33:54.800 --> 1:34:06.200]  financial sustained meltdown and have the establishment since 2008 globally
[1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:12.560]  turning the economy off on purpose only giving themselves the literally hundreds
[1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:18.560]  of trillions in in dollars and euros and other currencies and then passing the
[1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:27.920]  debt on to us while creating giant welfare classes whose daily government
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:32.560]  prayers are answered with more welfare and more largesse ready to do
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:37.640]  politically whatever they're told for their handouts
[1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:50.480]  now now continuing here ladies and gentlemen I've got so many hundreds of
[1:34:50.480 --> 1:35:02.240]  points I want to make but we are in the midst of the continued economic
[1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:08.640]  conquest of the planet by the globalist and again they want to economically have
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:14.480]  conquest and control so that they can then run our lives because that's what
[1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:20.720]  they desire to do and they want to run our lives in a very bad direction and
[1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:28.520]  as their plan comes into crisp focus and everyone sees the hypocrisy everyone
[1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:35.600]  sees the fraud everyone sees the security theater for what it is a power grab all
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:40.800]  of us will have a decision to make as it becomes more and more apparent are you
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:47.560]  going to speak out against this when we have a chance to turn it around or are
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:54.240]  you going to be forced to stand up against it when there's not much hope but
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:59.000]  now you realize how evil it is and just your fired flight kicks in there's no
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:05.360]  way to run you fight I just got chills when I said that and then of course there's
[1:36:05.360 --> 1:36:09.520]  a worse time and I'm paraphrasing once in Churchill right now there's a time
[1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:13.520]  when you don't have any hope but you're still gonna fight because it's better
[1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:17.640]  than being on your knees having these wolves pull your guts out your rear end
[1:36:17.640 --> 1:36:22.120]  that's what wolves do folks they eat you from the behind end up because they like
[1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:27.000]  to watch it they like to hurt you they like to hear you cry and beg if they
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:33.640]  enjoy their their red meat with screams the New World Order has already killed
[1:36:33.640 --> 1:36:40.600]  most of us they've already taken 10 20 30 years off our lifespans they've already
[1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:45.360]  fed us a GMO poison they've already filled our water with poison and they
[1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:51.880]  sell us expensive treatments for what they've helped engineer a lot of its
[1:36:51.880 --> 1:36:56.280]  human stupidity and human corruption but guiding it and riding this beast of
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:37:01.880]  corruption directing it like a grand conductor
[1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:20.680]  is the archetype of metastopheles and people ask why because to them great
[1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:27.880]  evil and great suffering of the innocent is a beautiful thing and we are a
[1:37:27.880 --> 1:37:34.160]  nation that rationalized and made up the legal arguments that on many levels can
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:46.800]  make sense to you that 53 million babies since 1973 were not humans and black
[1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:52.560]  people weren't humans to go ahead and inject them with syphilis an appellation
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:56.000]  poor white people weren't humans to go ahead and sterilize them inject them
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:00.480]  with syphilis oh yeah that's come out to it's just you know anybody they can get
[1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:05.880]  their hands on who nobody will believe they're gonna do this to them what do
[1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:10.400]  you think they're doing now when I could sit here for 10 hours and just read
[1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:17.320]  declassified public test of lethal and close to lethal agents on innocent
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:22.480]  populations by the people running this government of course they took blood for
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:27.960]  42 years worldwide at birth from everyone under globalist control that's the
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:31.880]  British Empire Europe in the United States that's that's the global Empire
[1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:36.920]  right now I mean my gosh the Arabs are corrupted out of control the Russians
[1:38:36.920 --> 1:38:40.680]  have got their own corruption but they're not putting cancer viruses in their
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:44.560]  vaccines oh they were back in the Soviet Union that's why they've rejected
[1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:50.160]  everything they were at least on the surface old habits die hard
[1:38:51.640 --> 1:38:58.400]  but it's all real the New World Order is real all the things they're doing to us
[1:38:58.400 --> 1:39:07.680]  are real look at the lawlessness of military bases all over the United
[1:39:07.680 --> 1:39:16.880]  States is staging grounds for the welfare Queens of Latin America and the
[1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:22.000]  rest the world now is coming these aren't the quote hard-working immigrants
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.600]  that would come here in the past who then second generation will become
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:31.080]  welfare Queens like other Americans but still vote for the Democratic Party and
[1:39:31.080 --> 1:39:36.160]  gun control and socialism because that was the group that was their friend even
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:40.080]  as they pushed Gardasil shots on their daughters
[1:39:40.400 --> 1:39:49.920]  sterilization shots now it's literally the criminal dregs the mules the gang
[1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:58.840]  members the mentally disturbed the prisoners and you know 500 pound women
[1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:08.720]  with six kids and six sex underwear dumping them here and then having the
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:20.880]  gall with Nancy Pelosi last weekend coming out and saying we're all
[1:40:20.880 --> 1:40:25.680]  citizens of North America this hemisphere we're all Americans that's
[1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:29.560]  that's the new talking point that's portray us saying what's next North
[1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:36.400]  America but it's not some North America where you mix Switzerland and the
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:40.440]  United States better attributes with the better attributes of Latin America
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:46.120]  there's some good things about Latin America no no no you take the worst
[1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:53.520]  things and you put them on a pedestal and why did the CIA declassify last year
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:41:00.040]  that they would promote second-deviant art and that they would push that on
[1:41:00.040 --> 1:41:05.080]  the American audience because they had to get you in their own words used to
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:10.800]  accepting anything and it's not that I can't handle sick or deviant art it's
[1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:14.400]  not that there isn't even something sometimes too sick or deviant aren't to
[1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:25.640]  illustrate something political it's that they pushed it to sabotage the elective
[1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:33.720]  process that a normal brain would develop over life to push people into
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:36.800]  degeneracy
[1:41:43.840 --> 1:41:51.440]  show that you would be weak and could be destroyed and I told people that for
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:54.840]  years and now it's declassified I mean it's not I don't need to reclassify
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:42:11.720]  documents to look at an operation and again it is as if Satan himself ran our
[1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:24.680]  government whether you believe in the devil or not because the way they get
[1:42:24.680 --> 1:42:30.200]  good people to go along with this and to work for it and to be part of it and
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:35.320]  and and and how deceived they are and how invested in the lie they are
[1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:49.720]  destroying their own future imagine the fact that we broke three weeks ago with
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:58.400]  emergency managers ice agents video of it whistleblowers on camera off camera by
[1:42:58.400 --> 1:43:03.000]  every journalistic standard wasn't the radio host Alex Jones the mad prophet of
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:06.040]  the airwaves as they call me you know the Southern Harvey Law Center Time
[1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:10.760]  magazine up there ranting about it was just reporters being serious going down
[1:43:10.760 --> 1:43:16.600]  doing interviews and a week after we broke it and drudge report carried it
[1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:20.000]  drudge report dot com carried info wars dot com and present one of com articles
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:25.440]  AP came out and said yeah the illegals are being bus deeper in the United States
[1:43:25.440 --> 1:43:29.120]  by the government they didn't go on to say by the way the government pays for it
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:32.920]  and advertises form to come up here but they told most of the story and then
[1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:38.120]  guess who came out as soon as that got traction the White House came out through
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:44.400]  media matters but the White House came out as well and said I mean this is the
[1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:51.040]  anatomy the tissue of a total fraud the structure of it you can study just as one
[1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:55.360]  lie with a master's degree and because once you understood this lie you understand
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:44:02.800]  all the other lies work and how the lie just sits there as a fraud and then it's
[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:07.520]  just an excuse for us to do nothing Congress to do nothing the states to do
[1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:12.920]  nothing while our entire futures are being burned down now this is only the
[1:44:12.920 --> 1:44:15.240]  beginning
[1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:24.400]  you have small towns collapsing all along the 2000 mile border you have crime
[1:44:24.400 --> 1:44:35.440]  exploding and you have the federal government pulling in with buses from
[1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:41.800]  Mexico and no Border Patrol trucks at a stand down and not just us saying it the
[1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:45.920]  Border Patrol Union president and vice president are on info wars dot com
[1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:51.880]  Breitbart on record saying yes we've been ordered three months ago to stand down
[1:44:51.880 --> 1:45:03.960]  from Southern California to Southern Texas from San Diego to Brownsville's
[1:45:03.960 --> 1:45:08.240]  the quote that there is no border enforcement going on I was down in Big
[1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:11.360]  Bend three months ago and told you I used to see border patrol everywhere they
[1:45:11.360 --> 1:45:19.680]  were nowhere I used to pull into the checkpoint Alpine 70 miles in where they
[1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:22.760]  would let illegals through but be told to go after citizens there was no one
[1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:30.080]  there one guy and they just were waving everybody through wide open and Mexico
[1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:39.440]  opened its southern border on record I mean this is the false flag and the
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:45.840]  public is so in the dark that even when AP comes out and admits it no one has an
[1:45:45.840 --> 1:45:53.920]  instinct to get freaked out about it and and and so really I'm just marvelling
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:46:03.920]  taking off six days spending time with family I just just in retrospective it
[1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:11.440]  was just it just hit me it's all real it's really it's all beyond what I
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:15.960]  thought it's so evil and it's all just about to start that you see nothing
[1:46:15.960 --> 1:46:21.000]  nothing yet not they really want to put 50 million of us in camps just in the
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:27.880]  US alone and pull our teeth out with pliers folks and they will do it because
[1:46:27.880 --> 1:46:32.000]  they want to they really are going to blow up federal buildings and blame it
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:37.800]  on us they really are gonna bring in a total world government release bio
[1:46:37.800 --> 1:46:44.440]  weapons in the next phase after that and just start calling people in mass they
[1:46:44.440 --> 1:46:55.640]  really are wrecking everything on purpose and again you go to the TSA and
[1:46:55.640 --> 1:47:00.440]  you say you want to opt out and the public's been bucketing so much they've
[1:47:00.440 --> 1:47:05.760]  made him behave and gotten rid of the more imperious people but I had this one
[1:47:05.760 --> 1:47:11.760]  guy literally bug his eyes I'd go so you want to opt out keep it scaring me this
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:17.360]  in Houston last night coming back through at the end of quote customs and I
[1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:21.560]  started just preaching at him not in a loud voice and they were freaking out
[1:47:21.560 --> 1:47:24.760]  they had like six of them around me they you know and all I was doing was
[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:36.560]  calmly saying listen this is all basically unlawful but I said you know the
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:40.680]  southern border is wide open and I said you're supposed to let me through and
[1:47:40.680 --> 1:47:46.560]  just do your quote pat down you know I've done nothing to you and I'm sad that
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:49.480]  you're such an unhappy person that you were bugging your eyes out of me and
[1:47:49.480 --> 1:47:53.600]  getting mad at me and this went on for about two minutes and they all just
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:57.720]  collapsed and then the head guy came over and apologized and took me through
[1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:03.200]  and I realized the fact that I didn't even get angry at him I literally said
[1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:08.640]  you are a poor slave and I love you and I'm sorry that you've had such an empty
[1:48:08.640 --> 1:48:12.640]  life that this is the only job you've got you're on this petty power trip and
[1:48:12.640 --> 1:48:17.560]  that you know this is a fraud and a lie and you know you're jumping all over me
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:21.440]  this old lady it was like six of them in my face and you're acting like you'd
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:28.120]  like to hurt me look at your fellow citizens with their shoes off to be
[1:48:28.120 --> 1:48:34.960]  humiliated like they're going into a you know the lousy Nazi facility with
[1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:40.800]  their clothes stripped off and just look at how this is a total preparation for
[1:48:40.800 --> 1:48:47.080]  takeover and how they lie to you about the cancer risk of these machines
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:57.080]  and see it wasn't fun anymore because I wouldn't even angry at him but our
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:49:05.920]  borders are wide open and they now have internal highway checkpoints they now
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:10.600]  have snitch systems they now in the news oh yes nationwide we're putting up
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:14.400]  microphones and systems that grab all your data without warrants and track
[1:49:14.400 --> 1:49:17.600]  everything you do in real time to keep you safe it's all completely illegal but
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:22.080]  we're doing it but the borders wide open oh and by the way the Tea Party are
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:25.080]  terrorist and the Pentagon's training that they're going to start a civil war
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:28.800]  and start bombing police stations everywhere with no proof no evidence no
[1:49:28.800 --> 1:49:33.760]  background no history again with all the sitcoms and dramas showing the
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:39.520]  Patriots blowing everything up in almost every TV show out there every cop show
[1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:45.440]  every drama every FBI show every you know 24 type show because they're
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:53.120]  preparing that and they don't care how many people die because they're sitting
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:50:01.680]  offshore they're gonna watch the whole thing and fiddle while America burns and
[1:50:01.680 --> 1:50:05.240]  so really it comes down to this point for the American people and people the
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:09.960]  world as well this is global you may think you're in Switzerland you're gonna
[1:50:09.960 --> 1:50:13.080]  be okay you may think you're having some Caribbean island you're gonna be okay
[1:50:13.080 --> 1:50:23.720]  no you're not this collapse is a spiritual collapse a cultural collapse of
[1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:34.000]  morals and all of it is so expertly done where they only gave the TV licenses to
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:39.160]  the most horrible fake con artist preachers to destroy Christianity I
[1:50:39.160 --> 1:50:47.640]  mean it's just it's genius I mean I marvel at it quite frankly because I see
[1:50:47.640 --> 1:50:54.440]  the whole design and then I see the public walking out of the meat grinder
[1:50:54.440 --> 1:50:57.760]  and I don't even know what to say I'm gonna play the Pelosi Club when we

[1:54:40.760 --> 1:54:49.600]  I think I know this it's infectious especially in a time of great evil we
[1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:55.480]  need to reach out to people and let them know the full story why things are bad
[1:54:55.480 --> 1:55:01.480]  why things don't seem right why things are so twisted think of the arrogance
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:07.760]  of the elite to open the Mexican border to Guatemala and to open the Texas and
[1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:13.920]  California and Arizona and and other borders on the south of the United
[1:55:13.920 --> 1:55:21.560]  States to flood the country and have Nancy Pelosi say oh I love the Hispanic
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:27.280]  children I want to take some home with me if I could as if that multi hundred
[1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:33.200]  millionaires swindling criminal mafia literal witch I mean these are gangsters
[1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:38.960]  folks by every metric Feinstein all of them I mean these are criminal
[1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:50.640]  masterminds and they can open the borders up and say don't be racist take
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:58.720]  home some Hispanic children what and you know this is our family this is
[1:55:58.720 --> 1:56:04.000]  North America this is our our region this is our hemisphere this is our because
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:07.680]  we're in the North American Union and what conservatives have to realize is
[1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:12.520]  George W. Bush signed that in a secret agreement with Vicente Fox declassified
[1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:20.360]  2007 he signed it in 2005 the full agreement remains classified that's
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:24.400]  why I've been freaking out folks they have classified North American Union
[1:56:24.400 --> 1:56:29.200]  agreements and then Bush comes out in 2007 and gives a rose garden speech with
[1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:33.880]  Merkel this is an in-game and Baroso the head of the year of the time
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:40.400]  admitting it all I mean it's like the Southern Barbery Law Center and the
[1:56:40.400 --> 1:56:46.800]  White House mouthpiece the mouth of Soran media matters came out last week and
[1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:52.080]  said you know Fox News CNN picking up Alex Jones's conspiracy theory that
[1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:56.280]  they're letting illegals in it letting them in hell they're paying to ship and
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:57:01.120]  wherever they want to go I mean I have it in triplicate ice whistleblowers

[1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:46.280]  getting deeper fast and as a man as a parent I mean my spider-sense is just
[1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:52.880]  off the charts and you I told you months ago get ready they've got full-scale war
[1:57:52.880 --> 1:57:56.400]  in Ukraine full-scale war in the Middle East and in Africa and Al-Qaeda taking
[1:57:56.400 --> 1:58:00.800]  over everywhere missiles have been given to him by our evil government the
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:05.960]  borders wide open it's like a bad James Bond villain runs America and it's

[2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:49.520]  Americans prepare for financial ruin Trump points out downgrade of US debt is
[2:00:49.520 --> 2:00:54.520]  inevitable yeah we were maneuvered to this point when those of us that said
[2:00:54.520 --> 2:01:00.840]  don't do it you're a conspiracy theorist because you have top economists on you
[2:01:00.840 --> 2:01:06.560]  know and I was so thankful three weeks ago and drudge link to a lot of info
[2:01:06.560 --> 2:01:15.920]  wars calm stories not because it sent traffic to my website and that's that's
[2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:22.960]  that's part of it but because the story then broke and it forced the national
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:27.080]  debate to begin which the White House came out and said this is not happening
[2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:34.200]  we're not letting illegals in and because you didn't have amnesty this is now
[2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:37.400]  happen the answers legalize everybody and that'll make everybody stop coming
[2:01:37.400 --> 2:01:43.080]  what yeah we're gonna realize bank robbing that'll make bank robbery stop I
[2:01:43.080 --> 2:01:48.640]  mean it's it's just it's insane it would increase bank robbery just so you
[2:01:48.640 --> 2:01:54.120]  know and it's a system run by criminals for criminals it's like where they say
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:01:58.680]  you can't have a gun to defend yourself at your bank or your business but the
[2:01:58.680 --> 2:02:02.320]  police aren't gonna respond when you get robbed I mean that's what this is give
[2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:06.600]  us your guns America and we're gonna let the dregs of the world come here and
[2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:10.200]  just walk across the border and we'll put them on a bus and bus them right into
[2:02:10.200 --> 2:02:15.320]  the middle of the country national suicide and I know I keep going back to
[2:02:15.320 --> 2:02:27.480]  that over and over again but I was complaining earlier last week that you
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:32.840]  know the national media was spinning and lying with our story about the border
[2:02:32.840 --> 2:02:37.560]  being wide open but why was I complaining they ignored the border patrol
[2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:44.280]  president and they ignored the vice president saying there's an open stand
[2:02:44.280 --> 2:02:51.800]  down that's the quote there is a stand down there is no border they're told
[2:02:51.800 --> 2:02:55.000]  citizens that come back through look and see if they've got real him and all in
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:59.120]  the car arrest some college kids all we're allowed to do is arrest college
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:06.920]  kids and we don't we want to do it because you because they are not allowed
[2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:11.240]  to enforce the law they enforce the criminal hatred that the globalist have
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:17.440]  for America and for anybody that's American because in these wars if you
[2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:24.040]  study history the globalist hate the seed of America they hate the culture the
[2:03:24.040 --> 2:03:28.920]  idea not of all the bad things America's done but the good things America did
[2:03:28.920 --> 2:03:35.400]  were so revolutionary every one of the world wanted to come here it was special
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:48.640]  it's that quote in from last of the Mohicans right towards the end in the
[2:03:48.640 --> 2:03:59.200]  fight scene where the two you know alpha Native Americans battle to the death and
[2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:04.160]  he says to him I'm gonna kill you and I'm gonna kill your daughters and I'm
[2:04:04.160 --> 2:04:11.600]  gonna wipe your seed off the face of this earth that's real power folks the
[2:04:11.600 --> 2:04:15.720]  globalist aren't just attacking humans they're attacking with trees they're
[2:04:15.720 --> 2:04:20.160]  attacking the fish the amphibians every they're genetically re-engineering
[2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:26.800]  everything with horrible consequences
[2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:36.840]  and then they run the environmental movement again so we're all distracted
[2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:42.240]  onto what plants breathe as the scourge not just the hundreds of horrible
[2:04:42.240 --> 2:04:46.800]  things that are going on that's what I'm saying folks I mean it's like the
[2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:51.760]  elite are evil space aliens come here to destroy us I mean they're that bad I
[2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:57.240]  mean they really are that bad we are in the hands of pure evil that's what I'm
[2:04:57.240 --> 2:05:03.440]  getting at here from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our

[2:05:11.680 --> 2:05:15.520]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans
[2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:19.880]  spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there

[2:05:31.320 --> 2:05:35.000]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:39.400]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[2:05:39.400 --> 2:05:43.240]  cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild

[2:08:24.600 --> 2:08:29.840]  you are listening or watching this emergency global transmission you are
[2:08:29.840 --> 2:08:35.880]  the resistance I'm just a normal person folks who about 22 years ago discovered
[2:08:35.880 --> 2:08:42.240]  a lot of the crimes being conducted by offshore anti-free market corporate
[2:08:42.240 --> 2:08:47.040]  interest through governments in an attempt to shut down free markets while
[2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:51.320]  blaming free markets for their kleptocratic brand of socialism on the
[2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:56.320]  bottom to domesticate the public fascism sitting on top now I've used my
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:09:03.440]  own geopolitical terms married them with husband them with already existing
[2:09:03.440 --> 2:09:09.800]  terms and I have to say much of what I have put into the common parlance is
[2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:24.360]  now now part of the common nomenclature and that shows that those of us that
[2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:32.000]  don't want to go along with the globalist can defeat them if one guy from
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:35.840]  Texas can reach 3 million 4 million people a day 15 20 million people a week
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:40.720]  conservatively what can you do in your area and I don't want to start this
[2:09:40.720 --> 2:09:43.720]  interview talking about myself but I never got to this earlier because I got
[2:09:43.720 --> 2:09:46.800]  my flight got cancelled last night getting back in the country and then I
[2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:49.600]  was late an hour into the show getting here's want to make this point we're
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:56.480]  going to our guests and I want to ask him this up front but when I say it's the
[2:09:56.480 --> 2:09:59.720]  best of times worst of times we're getting some good Supreme Court rulings a
[2:09:59.720 --> 2:10:05.240]  lot of them not just the fact that you can have companies that don't have to
[2:10:05.240 --> 2:10:09.600]  pay for abortions basically like Hobby Lobby and we're seeing some other good
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:14.600]  rulings out of them and we're seeing more and more people talk about crony
[2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:21.680]  capitalism versus real capitalism we're seeing billionaires come out and and
[2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:26.520]  and more and more tell it like it is people like Donald Trump saying that
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:31.280]  prepare for financial ruin and we're seeing more and more the media even MSNBC
[2:10:31.280 --> 2:10:36.320]  and CNN and and if you see NBC they'll say oh yeah there are crony capitalists
[2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:40.560]  that like wrecking things I mean folks are starting to get a basic self
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:44.960]  preservation instinct
[2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:58.320]  and people better because here's the big issue if for three weeks Congress is
[2:10:58.320 --> 2:11:04.480]  the national review has published with a letter by representative from
[2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:12.120]  Oklahoma if members of Congress aren't allowed in to these military bases and
[2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:16.080]  there's private security strutting around and they've detained our reporters
[2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:21.240]  for even trying to go shoot video through the fence and you've got a culture of
[2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:24.600]  total lying and they're busting the illegals in that don't even have skills
[2:11:24.600 --> 2:11:30.960]  they don't even skill workers criminals you name it the question is what comes
[2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:36.680]  next well here's another issue for the establishment this one bring up with
[2:11:36.680 --> 2:11:42.880]  Mr. Dent who's about to join us you've got all this craziness going on a lot of
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:46.520]  good things happening was a lot of bad things happening but the establishment
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:51.360]  acts like they don't care like they know something we don't know and they're just
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:56.160]  invincible I mean Obama in the first campaign and again the last campaign
[2:11:56.160 --> 2:12:01.840]  took about a third of his donations offshore through websites with even fake
[2:12:01.840 --> 2:12:06.160]  names and stuff each case of felony and never gotten trouble I mean that's just
[2:12:06.160 --> 2:12:10.240]  one example of the legions of crimes that are going on while they then use the
[2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:17.760]  IRS to persecute you know the institutes and things that promote
[2:12:17.760 --> 2:12:22.280]  conservative financial ideas or pro-life groups it's real tyranny is what I'm
[2:12:22.280 --> 2:12:30.160]  saying and then meanwhile I'm in the airport yesterday to see this dichotomy
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:34.160]  in Houston and I go to the TSA and I don't want to be put in a good body
[2:12:34.160 --> 2:12:37.560]  scanner so they get all angry at me and act like I've done something wrong and
[2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:40.560]  then I explain to them that they know full well it's all fraud and they
[2:12:40.560 --> 2:12:47.840]  basically let me through and then I go through customs and the guy's a listener
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:52.040]  and said he only got the job because you know he had family that died 9-11 he's
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:55.560]  retired military and then he knows the whole thing's fraud and government
[2:12:55.560 --> 2:13:00.000]  runs ISIS and yeah they put an X on your thing here to be searched and harassed
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:03.840]  but this is all a load of crap I'm sending you through you have no criminal
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:08.960]  record I listen to your show every day by the way I was waiting for what happened
[2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:11.360]  there I even recorded it I don't think I'm gonna air it don't want to get the
[2:13:11.360 --> 2:13:16.360]  guy in trouble the point is is that he he said yeah the machines are taken over
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:20.960]  that program machine that we don't even know who put stuff in it tries to keep
[2:13:20.960 --> 2:13:25.960]  you name it from from from even coming into the country he goes congressman
[2:13:25.960 --> 2:13:29.000]  have trouble getting back in the country you have trouble getting back in the
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:31.920]  country but the illegals can come right in you see that's why they want
[2:13:31.920 --> 2:13:36.480]  computers in there show that it's all centralized and people can't say no to
[2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:39.280]  the tyranny but but there was that dichotomy and then when I was in the
[2:13:39.280 --> 2:13:46.440]  Caribbean in places like Grand Cayman I mean I was mobbed more than even I am
[2:13:46.440 --> 2:13:51.240]  in Austin Texas I mean mobbed by the people at the hotel mobbed at other
[2:13:51.240 --> 2:13:55.560]  hotels by the staff owned the Ritz Carlton for dinner I was some friends
[2:13:55.560 --> 2:14:04.120]  just incredible just just everywhere I went at the airports the police were
[2:14:04.120 --> 2:14:09.040]  listeners it was just completely blowing me away that they all got it on that
[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:15.120]  island so there is hope because I'm not bragging hey Alex Jones is a big deal
[2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:20.560]  I'm saying liberty is popular legalizing freedom is popular as Ron
[2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:27.440]  Paul says and we're selling snow cones in hell they're selling lighting people
[2:14:27.440 --> 2:14:31.280]  on fire on the fourth as you lie people don't want to be burned up folks they
[2:14:31.280 --> 2:14:36.600]  want a snow cone and and and the system is creating a hell right now we're
[2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:42.080]  joined for the rest of the hour by Harry Dent he's the best-selling author a lot
[2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:48.680]  of accurate predictions of course was a top analyst for Bain Capital and he's
[2:14:48.680 --> 2:14:52.360]  been on the show four or five times as a popular guest we appreciate him coming
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:56.120]  back on his new books out he's offering our listeners it's not nice thing he's
[2:14:56.120 --> 2:15:03.120]  sent along at a Harry Dent dot com forward slash Alex Jones a free chapter
[2:15:03.120 --> 2:15:06.120]  from his book and more with some of the key charts and things we're gonna be
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:11.040]  showing here today I want to get into that with him I want to debate inflation
[2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:13.880]  deflation with him not that I even disagree with him but I want to go
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:17.720]  through these nuances with a technical guy just with my layman view maybe he
[2:15:17.720 --> 2:15:22.000]  can explain some of these paradoxes to me but first the last five minutes you
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:26.360]  heard me break down just some of my experiences being out of the country
[2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:29.440]  coming back to the country the borders wide open the government pays the
[2:15:29.440 --> 2:15:33.720]  ship the illegals in on the buses we have video of it and them admitting it
[2:15:33.720 --> 2:15:37.800]  Obama won't admit it and says it's ridiculous we should have amnesty to
[2:15:37.800 --> 2:15:44.560]  fix this when they already are causing it by giving him fiat amnesty people are
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:47.640]  waking up but still things are getting worse the elite are acting like
[2:15:47.640 --> 2:15:50.640]  they don't care in five minutes before we go to break or I'll skip the break
[2:15:50.640 --> 2:15:55.040]  explain to me your perspective on what's happening I mean is this like
[2:15:55.040 --> 2:15:59.280]  Caligula marrying his horse our Nero committing suicide I mean is the elite
[2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:03.960]  going insane like Hitler attacking Russia or or is there some method to this
[2:16:03.960 --> 2:16:09.360]  mr. Dent well I know there's not to me like like he said before people are
[2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:13.960]  destroying natural systems the free market capitalism is a natural organic
[2:16:13.960 --> 2:16:18.840]  biological system that needs the dynamics of opposites it is being
[2:16:18.840 --> 2:16:23.600]  over managed they're trying to run the economy like it's a machine you know
[2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:27.080]  they're not they don't we have the worst immigration policies in the world I've
[2:16:27.080 --> 2:16:31.400]  just back from Australia in February about to go back in July again they have
[2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:34.960]  the best immigration policies in the world and you know you have to be
[2:16:34.960 --> 2:16:39.600]  qualified to get in they attract the people they want you don't you can't
[2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:42.400]  just run across the borders they surround by notions that makes a little
[2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:45.880]  easier for them we've got horrible immigration policies but we have even
[2:16:45.880 --> 2:16:50.600]  worse financial policies the government is basically running our economy now
[2:16:50.600 --> 2:16:55.080]  unlike artificial drugs and that never works out well they're not allowing
[2:16:55.080 --> 2:16:59.920]  debts to rebalance they're not allowing bubbles to rebalance and the economy
[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:02.720]  to rebalance they're just saying the economy can't slow down they've taken
[2:17:02.720 --> 2:17:08.000]  over the economy and again trying to run it like it's an inorganic machine
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:14.120]  which is not so you know I hear all stuff you say about you know pollution in
[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:19.600]  the environment you know modified foods well I mean I just listen to guys saying
[2:17:19.600 --> 2:17:23.520]  you know our intestines are all screwed up because we overused drugs and
[2:17:23.520 --> 2:17:27.600]  antibiotics so much that we killed all the good bacteria while fighting the
[2:17:27.600 --> 2:17:32.440]  bad I mean we don't have enough respect for the wisdom of natural systems Adam
[2:17:32.440 --> 2:17:36.280]  Smith said it you know the invisible hand how our economy runs from the
[2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:40.800]  bottoms up if you just set some good rules and let it let innovation happen
[2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:45.120]  and let booms and bust happen and let inflation and deflation happen in my
[2:17:45.120 --> 2:17:52.080]  work inflation and deflation are the critical incentives for innovation and
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:56.440]  if you don't allow this to happen and most the innovations happen in bus not
[2:17:56.440 --> 2:18:01.040]  in boom and then they they come into our economy in the boom so I economists to
[2:18:01.040 --> 2:18:06.260]  me politicians do not understand our economy they have kind of hijacked it
[2:18:06.260 --> 2:18:11.440]  they are running it for elite interest the top 1% is run away with almost all
[2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:16.920]  the gains now for decades and by keeping this bubble going after creating the
[2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:22.440]  greatest bubble in history debt and and financial assets the government's only
[2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:27.920]  policies to keep the bubble going forever it keeps the top 1% making
[2:18:27.920 --> 2:18:33.720]  outsized gains it tosses all this inequality and polarization in society
[2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:38.640]  it's the worst economic policies I've ever seen in history and that tells me
[2:18:38.640 --> 2:18:42.600]  that it's gonna end badly and of course I've been warning of last few times on
[2:18:42.600 --> 2:18:46.840]  your show as well that the Dow's gonna get to somewhere like 17,000 where it is
[2:18:46.840 --> 2:18:51.160]  recently and by the way you said that just about a month and a half ago on the
[2:18:51.160 --> 2:18:54.320]  show people can go back to it that didn't come true and in fact you don't
[2:18:54.320 --> 2:18:58.080]  like to brag folks go to your website and see some of the past reports Harry
[2:18:58.080 --> 2:19:01.720]  Dent.com but but tell some of the people after some of the predictions you've
[2:19:01.720 --> 2:19:05.480]  made that have been spot on I mean you do have a very accurate prediction
[2:19:05.480 --> 2:19:09.480]  background here that's who we have on the show people that are accurate I mean
[2:19:09.480 --> 2:19:13.280]  you can tune into CNBC most days and just get a bunch of bull because because
[2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:16.120]  they're being literally told to put that out I've talked some behind the scenes
[2:19:16.120 --> 2:19:20.240]  they would lose their jobs like you know Dylan Radigan or whatever if they don't
[2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:25.320]  play ball so so so recap for folks some of the big predictions you've made that
[2:19:25.320 --> 2:19:29.440]  came true. Well first of all the biggest tool we use of many is demographics we
[2:19:29.440 --> 2:19:33.400]  know exactly when people buy the most cars houses when they spend the most
[2:19:33.400 --> 2:19:37.560]  money borrow the most pay for babysitting you name it there's almost
[2:19:37.560 --> 2:19:42.040]  nothing I don't know about the life cycle of consumers and consumers are 70% of
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:46.320]  our GDP and businesses who invest when consumers are growing are another 10
[2:19:46.320 --> 2:19:52.280]  governments only 20 thank God so we use demographics to predict trends and when
[2:19:52.280 --> 2:19:57.340]  I first got these tools in late 89 I came out with my first book and we
[2:19:57.340 --> 2:20:02.120]  predicted simultaneously that Japan would see a giant crash in the 1990s
[2:20:02.120 --> 2:20:05.800]  while the US and Europe would see the greatest boom in history people thought
[2:20:05.800 --> 2:20:10.640]  we were absolutely nuts then in the early 90s when we had the recession that we
[2:20:10.640 --> 2:20:14.000]  put in we said no we're going to come out of this and then the Dow's going to hit
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:19.640]  10,000 or higher by the early 2000s and that happened we called the tech peak in
[2:20:19.640 --> 2:20:24.800]  in February and April we called the internet peak in February and the
[2:20:24.800 --> 2:20:28.680]  NASDAQ peak in April just within one month of the peak and said look this
[2:20:28.680 --> 2:20:32.680]  bubble this is good this is a peak it's going to start to burst then we called
[2:20:32.680 --> 2:20:39.680]  the housing peak in late 2005 I literally moved from Miami to Tampa in that
[2:20:39.680 --> 2:20:44.560]  time period sold my house in Miami rented in Tampa saved a fortune so I
[2:20:44.560 --> 2:20:48.800]  practiced what I preached and we've been saying now for 20 years that in late
[2:20:48.800 --> 2:20:53.720]  2007 the baby boomers would peak and spending and we would start to move into
[2:20:53.720 --> 2:20:58.480]  a downward economy well what we did get our big crash in 2008 right on to but
[2:20:58.480 --> 2:21:01.360]  governments have just said well we won't let that happen anymore we won't let
[2:21:01.360 --> 2:21:05.200]  the economy go down we won't let banks fail we won't let companies fail we
[2:21:05.200 --> 2:21:10.520]  won't let debts be restructured or entitlements which are just off off the
[2:21:10.520 --> 2:21:15.880]  charts unaffordable so they're preventing the very crisis that could
[2:21:15.880 --> 2:21:20.920]  rebalance our economy get rid of this top 1% running away with all the games
[2:21:20.920 --> 2:21:25.040]  and everything but they won't do it and so what's going to happen instead they
[2:21:25.040 --> 2:21:28.760]  just created a bubble they created a bigger bubble again and we've been
[2:21:28.760 --> 2:21:32.200]  telling people and in the in over the last several months somewhere around
[2:21:32.200 --> 2:21:36.200]  Dow 17,000 a little higher this bubble is going to peak it's going to peak soon
[2:21:36.200 --> 2:21:41.760]  and the next crash is going to take us to lower lows than we saw in 2009 about
[2:21:41.760 --> 2:21:46.440]  five to six thousand on the Dow that's a very clear pattern higher highs and
[2:21:46.440 --> 2:21:50.760]  each bubble peak lower lows and each crash the government keeps simulating
[2:21:50.760 --> 2:21:54.120]  to try to avoid the crisis but only create some bigger crisis down the road
[2:21:54.120 --> 2:21:58.000]  just like taking more drugs to keep from coming down that's exactly what they're
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:04.080]  doing so drugs quantitative easing is basically like crack for the economy
[2:22:04.080 --> 2:22:07.440]  again if you just joined us you can visit the website harriedent.com
[2:22:07.440 --> 2:22:12.200]  for us Alex Jones and you can get unpublished chapter so it's an unpublished
[2:22:12.200 --> 2:22:15.680]  chapter that's even better the demographic cliff book it's already a
[2:22:15.680 --> 2:22:20.000]  best-seller we're going to go through some of those graphs today as well if
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:24.040]  you're a TV viewer watching at prisonplanet.tv or infowars.com
[2:22:24.040 --> 2:22:29.080]  forward slash show to find the free feed of the daytime broadcast and
[2:22:29.080 --> 2:22:34.600]  transmission now continuing with Harry Dent just tuned in I'm Alex Jones we're
[2:22:34.600 --> 2:22:39.440]  talking about where the world is today and so many people send me emails it is
[2:22:39.440 --> 2:22:43.640]  a minority but I do get a lot of them and I get it on the street or when I do
[2:22:43.640 --> 2:22:48.680]  radio interviews or TV interviews Alex why are you such a pessimist why are you
[2:22:48.680 --> 2:22:52.520]  complaining why are you saying this is bad or you know this is terrible well
[2:22:52.520 --> 2:22:56.720]  it's because I want to differentiate what's good from bad I socially want to
[2:22:56.720 --> 2:23:00.840]  wake people up to try to make the world a freer more open place now if someone
[2:23:00.840 --> 2:23:05.560]  disagrees with me about what my views are that's fine but it's my free speech
[2:23:05.560 --> 2:23:10.600]  but denying all these trends that are as clear as the nose on my face or your
[2:23:10.600 --> 2:23:15.800]  face is the stuff of societal collapse and and if we don't reverse this we have
[2:23:15.800 --> 2:23:21.560]  a managed economy like Japan or Venezuela two different managed systems one
[2:23:21.560 --> 2:23:25.800]  of the manage much better but still in a 20-year recession slash depression was
[2:23:25.800 --> 2:23:29.360]  signs of total societal collapse nobody's having kids you look at
[2:23:29.360 --> 2:23:33.600]  Venezuela they can't keep the lights on I mean we know that managed systems
[2:23:33.600 --> 2:23:39.200]  don't work and and we know that there's this tiny elite that are scapegoating the
[2:23:39.200 --> 2:23:42.960]  free market while they run away with all the games creating a giant piranha like
[2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:48.200]  underclass that they are using politically to fully socialize the once
[2:23:48.200 --> 2:23:53.000]  great Western nations because the globalists are exempt in most cases
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:58.240]  from what they've done to us so so what I'm asking you is how do we politically
[2:23:58.240 --> 2:24:01.560]  I understand it's important to know these trends and understand them so we can
[2:24:01.560 --> 2:24:04.600]  individually take care of ourselves being a better position maybe even you'll
[2:24:04.600 --> 2:24:09.760]  thrive from it that's a very moral and smart thing to do but at the same time
[2:24:09.760 --> 2:24:14.920]  what do you say about political hope I mean there's some huge awakening
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:18.760]  happening on one side but also incredible arrogance by the ruling class on
[2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:24.200]  the other so where does all this go well you know you only hope I have and it's
[2:24:24.200 --> 2:24:28.200]  exactly what I see happen a crisis is what gets people clear I am just like you
[2:24:28.200 --> 2:24:32.680]  I am crystal clear on debt trends they're off the charts the greatest debt
[2:24:32.680 --> 2:24:37.120]  bubble in history and that never ends well entitlements are even worse than
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:40.640]  that we never even had entitlements in the great depression when that debt
[2:24:40.640 --> 2:24:45.480]  bubble and financial bubble burst we got financial assets overvalued again more
[2:24:45.480 --> 2:24:49.680]  than ever about the burst and we're going to see a crisis because a lot of
[2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:52.760]  wealth is going to disappear when these bubble bursts and a lot of banks are
[2:24:52.760 --> 2:24:55.880]  going to have to fail when people realize the government can't just
[2:24:55.880 --> 2:25:00.360]  artificially create growth forever when the demographic trends and the debt
[2:25:00.360 --> 2:25:04.960]  trends are down so I'm clear on this but I'm also clear unlike economists
[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:09.720]  they're saying that China is the new model state driven capitalism I'm like
[2:25:09.720 --> 2:25:15.120]  you have to be kidding me China makes Japan or any other managed system look
[2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:20.680]  like nothing China has over expanded over managed their economy from top to
[2:25:20.680 --> 2:25:25.160]  bottom and talk about phony capitalism the way you get rich in China is you're
[2:25:25.160 --> 2:25:29.280]  the friend with the local Communist Party mafia leader and that's what it is
[2:25:29.280 --> 2:25:36.080]  it's a big mafia China has 27% of their condos and homes vacant overbuilt
[2:25:36.080 --> 2:25:42.280]  giant malls vacant overbuilt roads to nowhere bridges to nowhere railway
[2:25:42.280 --> 2:25:46.920]  stations that nobody's using they have over managed overbuilt let me just stop
[2:25:46.920 --> 2:25:50.440]  you for a minute history that's what this unpublished chapter I'm giving away
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:53.640]  for free about it didn't make it in time because I was rushing to get the book
[2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:58.600]  out I got it into the Korean and Chinese and in Asian books but I didn't get it
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:02.440]  in the US book so this is the most important chapter it looks at China
[2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:08.480]  thoroughly and shows what exactly what's going on why state managed capitalism
[2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:11.520]  is going to create the biggest disaster in the world it's going to be the
[2:26:11.520 --> 2:26:15.400]  failure of China's managed system that I think is going to most wake up
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:20.120]  politicians and economists and teach them that the free market system works
[2:26:20.120 --> 2:26:23.640]  better as long as you just have some simple rules and then that's what they've
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:28.760]  abandoned because they want more they want to manage sure well they're going to use
[2:26:28.760 --> 2:26:33.240]  well I mean in the brains of the socialist being counters the collapsing
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:36.480]  things gives them more power so they think they're going to survive it but if
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:40.160]  we politically expose them this could really be the end of them I agree with
[2:26:40.160 --> 2:26:45.960]  you the crisis they've been helping create and exacerbate is is their
[2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:50.280]  downfall if we simply tell the truth with a narrative against their narrative
[2:26:50.280 --> 2:26:54.280]  our narrative the truth will defeat their narrative the lie but looking at
[2:26:54.280 --> 2:26:57.600]  China we you hit the nail on the head right there nobody brings this up when
[2:26:57.600 --> 2:27:02.400]  I look at Europe and the US is elites what upsets me about the real controlling
[2:27:02.400 --> 2:27:07.080]  socialist elite is that either exempt from what they're doing to the rest of
[2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:14.240]  us but be there's so anti-freedom anti-market anti-male anti-independence
[2:27:14.240 --> 2:27:19.200]  that they don't even want to lifeblood in their own system that they've got
[2:27:19.200 --> 2:27:24.120]  control of but then they embrace in the Economist magazine every month is I guess
[2:27:24.120 --> 2:27:27.920]  you're talking about that I see it everywhere China that has suicide nets
[2:27:27.920 --> 2:27:33.720]  mobile execution vans forced abortions in their factories just stuff off the
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:38.640]  chart evil rivers getting set on fire they're so toxic and then this is the
[2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:43.400]  model a bunch of Chinese generals that are tax-exempt making millions of
[2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:47.040]  dollars where they're corrupt little royalty mafia families I know I'm
[2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:52.080]  ranting here Harry but but I mean the fact that our elite loves the Chinese
[2:27:52.080 --> 2:27:58.000]  model the Chinese Communist state-run model shows you how much trouble we're
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:01.840]  in yeah you know these people who love this model ought to go over there and
[2:28:01.840 --> 2:28:05.440]  choke on the smog and they're like he said they're the most polluted
[2:28:05.440 --> 2:28:08.600]  environment they're creating the most pollution in the world they're creating
[2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:12.280]  the most they're adding the most of this global bubble that is just going to
[2:28:12.280 --> 2:28:15.720]  burst and again that's what we'll talk later about deflation when you get
[2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:21.040]  bubbles burst when wealth disappears when debts fail and get restructured money
[2:28:21.040 --> 2:28:26.760]  disappears money just disappears and you get look fewer dollars chasing the
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:32.200]  same good you get deflation not inflation and all this over capacity and
[2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:36.000]  overbuilding any China's pretty much overbuilt their economy for the next
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:42.120]  12 years in advance of urbanization and they've urbanized twice as fast as any
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:45.760]  country in history which is dangerous I mean that they're they're uprooting all
[2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:50.160]  their traditions they're basically destroying their economy and then like
[2:28:50.160 --> 2:28:53.800]  you say our economists say oh wow this is such a great model because they grow
[2:28:53.800 --> 2:28:58.640]  8% a year and rarely have recessions and that's an economist dream but if you
[2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:03.560]  look at it and you get this chapter believe me the reason I'm putting all
[2:29:03.560 --> 2:29:07.360]  this stuff out like you is I'm going to be there to say I told you so because
[2:29:07.360 --> 2:29:11.160]  people do need to learn we are going to get this crisis you cannot keep a bubble
[2:29:11.160 --> 2:29:15.080]  going forever you cannot manipulate our economy forever you can't take more and
[2:29:15.080 --> 2:29:19.380]  more financial drugs and not have consequences so this crisis is going to
[2:29:19.380 --> 2:29:24.400]  hit but people need to understand why it happened and what the cause of it was
[2:29:24.400 --> 2:29:28.080]  so we don't repeat this mistakes and so these people do lose credibility that's
[2:29:28.080 --> 2:29:32.600]  right Harry we got a break is screwing our economy Harry Dentz our guest I'm
[2:29:32.600 --> 2:29:37.640]  Alex Jones Dave Bratton Virginia just won the primary as folks know he's an
[2:29:37.640 --> 2:29:43.440]  economist sounds just like mr. Dent and this is a popular idea folks we're gonna
[2:29:43.440 --> 2:29:46.920]  break it all down the other side and and and look at where the economy is going
[2:29:46.920 --> 2:29:54.280]  stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[2:29:54.280 --> 2:30:02.840]  GCN radio network a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine

[2:33:14.200 --> 2:33:24.200]  need to have a new movie with Kurt Russell directed by John Garbender we
[2:33:24.200 --> 2:33:28.360]  didn't get Rowdy Piper back on and we had him on last year about they live that
[2:33:28.360 --> 2:33:34.120]  was awesome we're gonna go back to a Harry Dent again you go to harriedent.com
[2:33:34.120 --> 2:33:37.960]  for slash Alex Jones he's got an unpublished chapter kind of halfway
[2:33:37.960 --> 2:33:42.280]  read this this because I got in late today with the flights and I was like oh
[2:33:42.280 --> 2:33:45.760]  he's posted one of his chapters no no no no he already had some of the chapters I
[2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:50.600]  saw up on the side a few months ago when it first came out but this is an
[2:33:50.600 --> 2:33:53.920]  unpublished one that really came out after the book and we're gonna talk
[2:33:53.920 --> 2:33:59.640]  about his predictions now and perhaps he can explain to my shelf and others out
[2:33:59.640 --> 2:34:04.880]  there what he's getting at saying it's deflation not inflation and I just want
[2:34:04.880 --> 2:34:09.000]  to talk you know to him about what I'm seeing but tomorrow and I may even do
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:12.560]  like an hour overdrive a day because I got here late some stations carry that
[2:34:12.560 --> 2:34:16.920]  fourth hour I won't get into much of this news and take your phone calls I'm not
[2:34:16.920 --> 2:34:21.720]  sure I have time to do that yet but we'll see I'm just more reflective now
[2:34:21.720 --> 2:34:27.040]  because I like to scuba dive I like to snorkel I never get to do it so I went
[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:35.480]  down to the Caribbean and I'd be on the boat and they'd be being real nice to me
[2:34:35.480 --> 2:34:38.160]  with all those people on the boat you know going snorkeling or scuba diving or
[2:34:38.160 --> 2:34:42.840]  going out to see the stingrays or going out to be on a wreck and they would just
[2:34:42.840 --> 2:34:46.720]  can we have a photo now at the end and I'd say what's going on oh we're all
[2:34:46.720 --> 2:34:52.560]  listeners and again one of the tour guides would be a you know a cop who
[2:34:52.560 --> 2:34:59.480]  also runs a company to go out and see the wreck or it would then be I mean I
[2:34:59.480 --> 2:35:05.760]  did probably like six or seven of these tours sometimes two a day and every time
[2:35:05.760 --> 2:35:11.920]  they were listeners I'd be in a grocery store and a cop would walk by and go
[2:35:11.920 --> 2:35:17.400]  Alex Jones like what you're doing I'd be in a dive shop and there'd be you know
[2:35:17.400 --> 2:35:22.480]  three black Caribbean guys in there and I'll go that voice you're Alex Jones I
[2:35:22.480 --> 2:35:27.440]  like what you say I have a lot of the same views we listen and again I'm not
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:32.160]  a pure bragging hey I got a bunch of listeners what I'm saying is we should be
[2:35:32.160 --> 2:35:36.760]  able to turn this around if tea party candidates are winning not just here but
[2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:44.200]  in Europe Le Pen and the UKIP party all over Europe I mean they got the biggest
[2:35:44.200 --> 2:35:51.600]  gains in the EU election and it's happening here so we're gonna go back to
[2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:57.120]  Mr. Dent here in a moment I just want to tell people this is exciting because I
[2:35:57.120 --> 2:36:00.400]  learned it's a particular Caribbean island they would never say anything when
[2:36:00.400 --> 2:36:02.640]  you're at a restaurant or would say anything when you'd gone out on your
[2:36:02.640 --> 2:36:07.400]  trip and at the end they would say I'm a listener or they'd be sitting there
[2:36:07.400 --> 2:36:12.080]  holding me in like reverence and I could tell go are you're a listener well I
[2:36:12.080 --> 2:36:15.360]  didn't want to bother you sir but we really appreciate you I mean it's just
[2:36:15.360 --> 2:36:22.960]  amazing amazing that I can go to England people saw live feeds of this on the
[2:36:22.960 --> 2:36:27.800]  Bilderberg two years ago or now you're in Africa and I just go to Big Bend to a
[2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:32.840]  live feed and there's people walking by by the scores and like half of them are
[2:36:32.840 --> 2:36:36.680]  stopping Alex Jones all Jones quite frankly I don't know where these numbers
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:39.560]  are at because we have millions a day we contract to visit the sites list of the
[2:36:39.560 --> 2:36:44.480]  show and am an FM stuff but I don't know where the numbers are where it's all
[2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:48.840]  coming from YouTube that that can't be it all I'm telling you is there's
[2:36:48.840 --> 2:36:53.640]  government has a 7% approval rating right now we should be able to beat this
[2:36:53.640 --> 2:36:57.640]  we should be able to take the country in the world back that's what I'm getting
[2:36:57.640 --> 2:37:04.360]  out here now before we go back to our guest here this whole broadcast is
[2:37:04.360 --> 2:37:07.560]  lists are supported I can hire more reporters I can pay my reporters better
[2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:12.840]  I can get better equipment you've seen the new studio will be doing the show
[2:37:12.840 --> 2:37:15.600]  out of there full-time soon but I've been a lot of special reports out of
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:19.480]  there what I did last week was before I left town I taped a bunch of reports then
[2:37:19.480 --> 2:37:24.400]  they aired them live on the show with David Knight who was live but they had
[2:37:24.400 --> 2:37:31.200]  taped to air obviously my clips and we're building all of this because of
[2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:34.560]  your support and it costs a lot I don't want to get into how much it costs to
[2:37:34.560 --> 2:37:37.240]  run this whole operation a year but one reason it's been successful is that I
[2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:43.440]  take it's got to be 95% of the money that comes in here and put it right back in
[2:37:43.440 --> 2:37:47.000]  the operation and over the years have created a fund in case the whole
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:50.720]  economy shut off so we can keep running three four months when you talk about
[2:37:50.720 --> 2:37:55.440]  collapse it really scares me because in a collapse we need to be prepared and we
[2:37:55.440 --> 2:38:00.160]  need to get as big as we can and before the collapse comes so that we've told
[2:38:00.160 --> 2:38:03.920]  the story so that we have a position to go to the next level to really try to
[2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:07.880]  change history that's what I'm into I'm not into fancy things I'm not into money
[2:38:07.880 --> 2:38:12.120]  nothing bad about it I'm into money because it gives me freedom the elite
[2:38:12.120 --> 2:38:14.280]  want to make you pour under their control because they want to run your
[2:38:14.280 --> 2:38:19.760]  life and we sell the best products the best supplements the best made in

[2:39:41.560 --> 2:39:48.160]  financial support and that means the armies of people that listen need to

[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:55.360]  those news articles those clips everybody should send the link out of

[2:39:59.760 --> 2:40:04.600]  comes down people then understand our credibility goes even higher why do you
[2:40:04.600 --> 2:40:08.640]  think the show is exploding why do you think Harry Dent's popularity is
[2:40:08.640 --> 2:40:13.680]  exploding or Rand Paul's or Ted Cruz because folks we're on the deck of the
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:18.160]  Titanic saying get to the lifeboats now I've been ranting sir it's just that I
[2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:21.200]  think it's important before we get into the economy and where it's all going and
[2:40:21.200 --> 2:40:25.600]  and some of your charts you're about to show here for TV viewers radio listeners
[2:40:25.600 --> 2:40:29.040]  will be able to find this on YouTube tomorrow our prison planet on TV tonight
[2:40:29.040 --> 2:40:33.520]  but there's a free feed and info wars.com forward slash show right now but
[2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:38.520]  briefly and then I want to get into inflation briefly I mean I'm not a
[2:40:38.520 --> 2:40:43.720]  technical financial scientist like you I just look at it with street smarts as
[2:40:43.720 --> 2:40:48.760]  a layman but how would you quantify what I just said you agree with it about the
[2:40:48.760 --> 2:40:52.480]  awakening a or B am I being too optimistic I mean what does your gut
[2:40:52.480 --> 2:40:57.560]  tell you no I think I study a lot of cycles Alex and one of them is a 250
[2:40:57.560 --> 2:41:02.840]  year revolutionary cycle as in the Revolutionary War 250 years ago and
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:08.760]  and the whole wealth of nations by by Adam Smith and stuff we're do we're
[2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:13.160]  right for a major revolution things do go towards more freedom even though at
[2:41:13.160 --> 2:41:16.080]  times they go the other ways and I think that's what's going to come out of this
[2:41:16.080 --> 2:41:19.480]  I do think it's important I've got the same mission you do I'm just warning
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:23.440]  people the media doesn't want people to hear this politicians don't want people
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:26.800]  to hear it you know Merrill Lynch doesn't want people to hear it you know in
[2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:30.640]  financial institutions and banks but this is the truth I just tell people
[2:41:30.640 --> 2:41:36.000]  here's how much debt we have we have 127 trillion by my last conservative
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:41.120]  count eight times GDP here's what our demographics say it predicted the boom
[2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:45.200]  now it's predicting a bus so I'm not a bearish person I was then bullish for
[2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:50.440]  20 years but the trends are down and now with these bubbles I'm also studied
[2:41:50.440 --> 2:41:54.720]  every bubble in history I got a whole chapter in the book chapter 5 on
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:41:58.240]  bubbles this unpublished chapter on China the greatest bubble of them all
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:02.680]  you got to understand bubbles because people get in denial and so I agree with
[2:42:02.680 --> 2:42:07.000]  you people who hear this sort of stuff who hear the truth need to tell other
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:10.920]  people and warn them because people are going to get their ass handed to them I
[2:42:10.920 --> 2:42:14.600]  hate to say this but you know you think the last crash was bad or the last
[2:42:14.600 --> 2:42:18.480]  recession I think this is going to be more like the Great Depression because
[2:42:18.480 --> 2:42:22.480]  the longer they put this off and the more they pump up of all this
[2:42:22.480 --> 2:42:27.960]  artificial money which again it's just like taking an artificial drug to stay
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:31.840]  high and get higher it's exactly that the worst the come down is going to be so
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:36.200]  people do really do need to be prepared they need to get in safe
[2:42:36.200 --> 2:42:40.440]  investments now don't don't chase this bubble any further it may go up another
[2:42:40.440 --> 2:42:44.940]  few percent it's already bubbly and I tell you if I can show that like the one
[2:42:44.940 --> 2:42:50.440]  chart I should show people is that megaphone chart I alluded to earlier if
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:54.440]  you look at them this is a very simple chart nothing complicated about it each
[2:42:54.440 --> 2:42:59.400]  bubble has taken us to new highs and each crash has taken us to new lows this is
[2:42:59.400 --> 2:43:04.480]  exactly a similar pattern to how the market peaked when the last generation
[2:43:04.480 --> 2:43:08.440]  peaked in their spending the Bob Hope or World War two generation we had three
[2:43:08.440 --> 2:43:14.720]  higher peaks and 65 68 and 72 and then we and we kept having lower lows and of
[2:43:14.720 --> 2:43:19.520]  course the big crash hit in 73 74 and nobody saw that coming this is a very
[2:43:19.520 --> 2:43:24.600]  obvious pattern you talk about common sense our biggest indicator is the
[2:43:24.600 --> 2:43:29.080]  spending wave it's just a 46 year lag for the predictable quantifiable peak
[2:43:29.080 --> 2:43:33.600]  and spending of the average household in this country and it would have told you
[2:43:33.600 --> 2:43:39.600]  decades ago that we would have an unprecedented boom from 1983 to 2007
[2:43:39.600 --> 2:43:43.160]  with the rising baby boomers earning and spending more money getting their kids
[2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:47.440]  in college and all that good stuff and then we would have a downturn from 2008
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:52.960]  to 2020 to 23 that's a very simple indicator common sense people spend
[2:43:52.960 --> 2:43:56.800]  more money as they raise their families who doesn't understand that we we can
[2:43:56.800 --> 2:44:01.520]  quantify we can project this we know when people are born and I just for legal
[2:44:01.520 --> 2:44:06.080]  and illegal immigrants so that it's even more accurate and so these are tools
[2:44:06.080 --> 2:44:10.560]  anybody can understand economists actually are too damn complicated they
[2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:14.760]  get into all the complexity all the detailed indicators end up missing the
[2:44:14.760 --> 2:44:18.040]  forest well you know why it's because they want to specialize in different
[2:44:18.040 --> 2:44:22.200]  schools to then compete with each other to have more textbooks and then to
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:25.280]  confuse the whole thing so nobody can even understand it that's what a lot of
[2:44:25.280 --> 2:44:28.880]  the big banks have been financing for a hundred years is basically conflating
[2:44:28.880 --> 2:44:32.280]  everything but let me ask you this and I want you to go to the charts and and
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:37.320]  basically predict the next shoe to drop with our guests here today Harry Dent
[2:44:37.320 --> 2:44:41.120]  let me ask you this question look I agree with you that when the big depression
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:44.880]  really kicks off we're already in a obvious long-term recession depression
[2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:49.440]  in many areas of the world depression different sectors it's a very managed
[2:44:49.440 --> 2:44:53.280]  economy so some areas are boom but the larger aggregate just looking at it is
[2:44:53.280 --> 2:44:57.320]  bust and even the establishment starting to admit that they're buying armored
[2:44:57.320 --> 2:45:00.720]  vehicles and the Pentagon admits they're preparing for collapse and Europe's
[2:45:00.720 --> 2:45:05.000]  preparing so so we know what's happening but just like when you're on a few
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:10.280]  months ago I said look I get that there is going to be deflation that's probably
[2:45:10.280 --> 2:45:15.800]  where this goes but the elites have been taking trillions bailing out there too
[2:45:15.800 --> 2:45:20.920]  big to fails giving it to themselves and so you can see luxury items Bentley's
[2:45:20.920 --> 2:45:25.680]  big houses helicopters they're all double triple huge inflation because the
[2:45:25.680 --> 2:45:29.560]  elite are being smart they're keeping it all to themselves the problem is it
[2:45:29.560 --> 2:45:35.200]  leaks out there is some trickle down and so now it's causing inflation in a lot
[2:45:35.200 --> 2:45:39.680]  of areas the Q even though it's slowing look at meat prices exploding look at
[2:45:39.680 --> 2:45:43.840]  state everybody I go out everything's going up in price when I was in the
[2:45:43.840 --> 2:45:47.240]  Caribbean I said why stuff so expensive they said well we're pegged to the dollar
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:52.160]  here you know I mean my god they were aware of it and that's how inflation
[2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:55.280]  works correct me if I'm wrong it's generally worse outside the country
[2:45:55.280 --> 2:46:01.120]  first then those dollars start coming back in the different M1 M2 so break down
[2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:07.520]  for me how we're seeing inflation but also there is a deflation in business
[2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:11.880]  deflation in some of the real markets trillions of dollars chasing a stock
[2:46:11.880 --> 2:46:17.360]  market pumping it up with QE dollars or I mean aren't we seeing a stock market
[2:46:17.360 --> 2:46:22.480]  inflation just like we see in some commodities explain this to me what
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:25.680]  you get and this only happens once in a lifetime that's why people don't
[2:46:25.680 --> 2:46:31.080]  understand it and see it the last bubble economy we had was from World War one
[2:46:31.080 --> 2:46:35.520]  into the war in 20s and in that time you get debt growing way faster than the
[2:46:35.520 --> 2:46:41.160]  economy you can't a debt group from 1983 to 2008 at its peak private and public
[2:46:41.160 --> 2:46:46.600]  debt together grew at 2.6 times our economy our GDP you can't do that for
[2:46:46.600 --> 2:46:51.920]  25 years without getting a huge debt imbalance so you get too much debt that
[2:46:51.920 --> 2:46:55.560]  overstimulates the economy the government then on top of that pours and
[2:46:55.560 --> 2:46:59.320]  money every time we have a recession and pushes down interest rates and that
[2:46:59.320 --> 2:47:03.040]  causes even more borrowing and leverage so you create more and more leverage
[2:47:03.040 --> 2:47:07.380]  again like a financial drug like like steroids or crack the financial
[2:47:07.380 --> 2:47:12.600]  enhancing drugs and basically it creates bubbles businesses I understand
[2:47:12.600 --> 2:47:16.800]  here but I mean explain to me how you're saying we're gonna see you know
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:21.600]  depressionary stuff but I mean economists didn't think of the 70s you
[2:47:21.600 --> 2:47:26.520]  could have inflation and depression and then they had stagflation would this
[2:47:26.520 --> 2:47:32.680]  be hyper stag inflation or once it blows up and pops is it so bad then things
[2:47:32.680 --> 2:47:35.560]  will implode and then that will take out the inflation I mean what's happening
[2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:40.240]  yeah actually I was in chapter one of my book I showed four seasons of our
[2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:46.320]  economy spring boom a summer stagflation high inflation recession which
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:49.960]  again economists never understood even when it happened it's part of the model
[2:47:49.960 --> 2:47:53.720]  of repeats once in a lifetime all throughout history then you get a fall
[2:47:53.720 --> 2:47:57.720]  bubble boom when that inflation falls you get very low interest rates that's
[2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:02.480]  when technologies move most mainstream like micro computers in this one and
[2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:05.720]  automobiles and the roaring 20s and stuff like that and that but when you
[2:48:05.720 --> 2:48:10.800]  get this bubble people overborrow over expand over leverage and then when when
[2:48:10.800 --> 2:48:15.680]  the generation cycles turn down the bubbles burst and you get a huge debt
[2:48:15.680 --> 2:48:19.960]  deleveraging I mean in the health industry they call it a detox or somebody's
[2:48:19.960 --> 2:48:24.660]  coming off drugs they call it a detox it's a debt detox what happened in the
[2:48:24.660 --> 2:48:28.840]  great depression is that we went from debt being a hundred ninety percent of
[2:48:28.840 --> 2:48:33.920]  GDP down to sixty percent we shed a ton of debt trillions and trillions of
[2:48:33.920 --> 2:48:37.960]  dollars of debt most of it private debt because government deficits only tend to
[2:48:37.960 --> 2:48:41.160]  go up and down turn because their revenues go down and the cost but we
[2:48:41.160 --> 2:48:45.720]  shed debt the economy rebalance the bubbles burst real estate went back
[2:48:45.720 --> 2:48:51.880]  down to reality stocks crashed 89% see all this these top 1% of people that
[2:48:51.880 --> 2:48:54.920]  are controlling all the assets they're the ones that are going to get hit the
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:48:59.680]  worst when this bubble finally burst and doesn't get cranked back up from me by
[2:48:59.680 --> 2:49:03.720]  the government the government has saved the banks and has saved the top 1% and
[2:49:03.720 --> 2:49:07.640]  it's screwed the everyday household what should have happened is we should have
[2:49:07.640 --> 2:49:11.560]  written down these mortgages which were way over lent by banks and they're the
[2:49:11.560 --> 2:49:15.800]  sophisticated people not the everyday household way over lent against high home
[2:49:15.800 --> 2:49:19.920]  valuations those home valuations need to come down where a young family can
[2:49:19.920 --> 2:49:24.080]  afford a home again mortgages need to be written off if the average person had
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:27.320]  their mortgage written down in half in line with their house they would be a
[2:49:27.320 --> 2:49:32.480]  lot better off instead of worse off so it's this the financial bubbles bursting
[2:49:32.480 --> 2:49:36.880]  dow goes from 17,000 my ultimate target is more like three to four thousand down
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:42.560]  the road around 2020 that's going to destroy you know 80% of people's wealth
[2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:47.160]  you got 18 80 trillion dollars in net worth it could be cut in half that's
[2:49:47.160 --> 2:49:52.360]  money that disappears home prices drop stock prices drop all this sort of stuff
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:56.400]  a lot of debt gets restructured and written off that means as I said
[2:49:56.400 --> 2:50:01.360]  earlier money disappearing it never comes back at least for a long time and
[2:50:01.360 --> 2:50:05.920]  that creates deflation so it's the opposite of the inflation what I call
[2:50:05.920 --> 2:50:09.960]  summer season we saw in the 70s and that's the way the economy goes it goes
[2:50:09.960 --> 2:50:15.040]  from mild inflation in spring the high inflation in summer to falling inflation
[2:50:15.040 --> 2:50:19.280]  again which everybody loves in fall and then to deflation and winter this
[2:50:19.280 --> 2:50:23.520]  happens over and over and again it used to be every 50 to 60 years when our
[2:50:23.520 --> 2:50:27.520]  lifespans were that now our lifespans are more like 80 so this cycles more like
[2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:32.240]  80 years economists don't understand this they don't understand the dynamics of
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:37.800]  the pre-market system why deflation and inflation actually stimulate the
[2:50:37.800 --> 2:50:42.640]  strongest innovations that pay off for decades they also I mean having home
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:46.880]  prices come back down having a lot of debt written off restructuring our
[2:50:46.880 --> 2:50:50.600]  entitlements which we can't even remotely afford what's been promised by the
[2:50:50.600 --> 2:50:54.880]  government for Medicare Medicaid and and so security exactly it makes things
[2:50:54.880 --> 2:50:58.720]  cheaper it makes things cheaper we'll be right back stay with us I want to ask

[2:54:09.520 --> 2:54:16.000]  little frantic on air with guests like mr. Dent because we're not really
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:20.400]  talking about something that's rocket science here it's historical now he takes
[2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:26.080]  it and shows it in a scientific way so people can see the facts for
[2:54:26.080 --> 2:54:30.640]  themselves but this is all common sense and I've studied the establishment they
[2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:34.760]  have created models where they think they're gonna get more power out of this
[2:54:34.760 --> 2:54:41.280]  incremental collapse and domesticators break our will but they're smoking their
[2:54:41.280 --> 2:54:46.320]  own dope they can't manage their way out of a wet paper bag and Obama vacations
[2:54:46.320 --> 2:54:53.000]  four months a year so this is not gonna go well I don't know what's gonna happen
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:59.000]  but it runs from bad to worse with a lot of crazy mixed in and I don't want to
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:03.120]  see this like some planet-of-the-apes scenario I mean I've seen some of these
[2:55:03.120 --> 2:55:05.840]  governmental and corporate interests that have just wrecked other countries
[2:55:05.840 --> 2:55:11.960]  that were great nations and like happened to chili and others and I just am so
[2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:20.680]  sad to see them trying to turn this country into a third-world nation and I
[2:55:20.680 --> 2:55:24.440]  guess I'm involved in collective hand-wringing just saying how do we
[2:55:24.440 --> 2:55:30.680]  wake people up and I think it's with the fundamentals it's the basics but what
[2:55:30.680 --> 2:55:34.120]  do you expect the political class in Europe the United States other places
[2:55:34.120 --> 2:55:38.800]  to do when one of these crises goes over the edge like Ukraine ISIS in the
[2:55:38.800 --> 2:55:43.840]  Middle East China could be blowing up all the time people say where's the
[2:55:43.840 --> 2:55:48.640]  meltdown where's the blow-up look at the societal rot the cities the dozens of
[2:55:48.640 --> 2:55:53.200]  states about to go bankrupt hundreds of cities already bankrupt all the numbers
[2:55:53.200 --> 2:55:57.000]  just just so astronomical I mean it's guaranteed it's like a guy that said five
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:56:02.240]  heart attacks and he's you know 85 years old and they're saying he's got to walk
[2:56:02.240 --> 2:56:06.240]  up the Empire State's building stairway I mean we don't know if you have a
[2:56:06.240 --> 2:56:10.160]  heart attack this time but he's gonna have one soon is what I'm saying I just
[2:56:10.160 --> 2:56:15.960]  look I'm sitting on top of a bunch of lit TNT Harry well it is you know in
[2:56:15.960 --> 2:56:20.320]  addition our demographic cycles I have an innovation cycle every 45 years very
[2:56:20.320 --> 2:56:26.040]  simple a geopolitical cycle that turns negative every 18 I mean every 36 years
[2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:32.560]  from 9 11 into the end of this decade this cycle continues to point down and
[2:56:32.560 --> 2:56:37.200]  everything is going wrong since then the Middle East is an outright Shia Sunni
[2:56:37.200 --> 2:56:40.240]  civil war that's going to blow up now that we're not willing to intervene
[2:56:40.240 --> 2:56:44.200]  anymore and I don't think we should have been the first place in that case China
[2:56:44.200 --> 2:56:49.040]  is going to have unbelievable social unrest when this bubble burst they've
[2:56:49.040 --> 2:56:55.160]  got 221 million unregistered rural citizens living in cities that aren't
[2:56:55.160 --> 2:57:00.040]  even aren't even legal people there and they don't have any skills they're
[2:57:00.040 --> 2:57:03.040]  tolerated like the illegal immigrants here in the United States in the boom
[2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:06.880]  they will not be tolerated in the bus they're gonna have huge problems so
[2:57:06.880 --> 2:57:10.960]  things are gonna get worse and we've got strong polarization in this country and
[2:57:10.960 --> 2:57:15.640]  you know in this bubble burst it's gonna be bad next time and I think what I
[2:57:15.640 --> 2:57:19.920]  see happening is everybody's been telling people it's okay you know the
[2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:24.080]  leaders in Europe the leaders in the US the Chinese oh we can manage this we can
[2:57:24.080 --> 2:57:28.440]  have a soft landing we can engineer our economy these people are gonna lose
[2:57:28.440 --> 2:57:32.720]  credibility because they told us it was going to be okay Warren Buffett's
[2:57:32.720 --> 2:57:36.320]  telling people it's going to be okay and I think he should shut up he's a great
[2:57:36.320 --> 2:57:39.280]  guy but he shouldn't be talking about economics because he doesn't understand
[2:57:39.280 --> 2:57:43.920]  the economy and he's misleading people people are going to be very upset and
[2:57:43.920 --> 2:57:47.040]  that's when they're going to listen to the people who told them the right thing
[2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:51.320]  the first place I you know I'm popular with a certain group of people in a
[2:57:51.320 --> 2:57:55.800]  certain arenas like this CNBC has me on just as a contrary person they don't
[2:57:55.800 --> 2:57:59.800]  agree with me they they don't want to hear what I have to say but people are
[2:57:59.800 --> 2:58:04.240]  gonna remember people like you or I or other people said hey there's a problem
[2:58:04.240 --> 2:58:07.920]  here hey there's a crisis coming so people are gonna naturally listen to
[2:58:07.920 --> 2:58:11.800]  those people and not to the people that told them everything's okay we can
[2:58:11.800 --> 2:58:18.480]  manage sure Harry Dent I don't want to you know bug you too much I know you're

[3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:39.080]  for such health shows to find the unpublished chapter of his book as it
[3:00:39.080 --> 3:00:44.600]  didn't come out in time to get in the bestseller the demographic cliff excellent
[3:00:44.600 --> 3:00:48.640]  reading by the way it's unfortunate but but denying these things only gonna make
[3:00:48.640 --> 3:00:53.480]  it worse so we're here just admitting how serious things have gotten but
[3:00:53.480 --> 3:00:57.160]  continuing with our guests is the four or five minutes we have left in this
[3:00:57.160 --> 3:01:02.280]  segment he was getting cut off talking about he'd come on once he gets back
[3:01:02.280 --> 3:01:06.520]  from Australia that's an interesting point you raise about Australia doing
[3:01:06.520 --> 3:01:11.760]  things better on several fronts they're now moving to vote down carbon taxes I'm
[3:01:11.760 --> 3:01:16.200]  seeing moves try to repeal some of their anti-gun laws there you've been there I
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:18.920]  haven't been to Australia you've been there recently used to go and assess
[3:01:18.920 --> 3:01:25.560]  companies assess countries for major financial institutions out there like
[3:01:25.560 --> 3:01:31.920]  Bain what would you say about a country like Australia versus China versus the
[3:01:31.920 --> 3:01:35.880]  United States well unfortunately Australia's biggest customer for their
[3:01:35.880 --> 3:01:40.200]  exports is China so they're gonna feel that very hard and they do have a big
[3:01:40.200 --> 3:01:43.880]  real estate bubble that they're in denial about but Australian government has
[3:01:43.880 --> 3:01:49.520]  almost no debt like he said they have such potent immigration policies and
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:54.280]  they're attracting highly qualified Asian citizens that may on average be
[3:01:54.280 --> 3:01:59.000]  more educated and more fluent than the average person Australia they're one of
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:02.120]  the few countries in the world of Western rich countries that actually has a
[3:02:02.120 --> 3:02:06.920]  larger echo boom or millennial generation and the baby boom our
[3:02:06.920 --> 3:02:11.760]  generation's not quite the size many countries in Europe have no echo boom at
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:17.120]  all in many countries in East Asia South Korea and Taiwan no echo boom at
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:21.280]  all so so there's some really when people don't have babies you are
[3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:25.520]  basically cheating your future so so demographic will tell us which countries
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:30.200]  are strong and we Australia will probably survive this crisis better than any
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:34.760]  other wealthy country or among the best and it will do much better in the next
[3:02:34.760 --> 3:02:38.360]  boom especially beating on the Pacific rim so I tell you now I thought I'm
[3:02:38.360 --> 3:02:43.440]  moving to Australia I love the country I sell five times as many books per
[3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:47.880]  capita given the smaller population there than I do in the US and then
[3:02:47.880 --> 3:02:50.840]  they're great people and I think they're really lucky they have a lot of
[3:02:50.840 --> 3:02:56.400]  resources and they just they've got better common sense government policies
[3:02:56.400 --> 3:03:00.320]  over there on just about everything and you can't even jaywalk over there
[3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:04.960]  they're very civil you can't speak they got cameras ever so you know they they're
[3:03:04.960 --> 3:03:09.280]  they're kind of law-abiding they have the best demographics in the western
[3:03:09.280 --> 3:03:13.720]  world and they're situated in a good part of the world for the future Asia China's
[3:03:13.720 --> 3:03:16.480]  going to be the problem in Asia but every every other part of Asia but you
[3:03:16.480 --> 3:03:19.720]  almost sound like you're saying it's the new Singapore you're saying Australia is
[3:03:19.720 --> 3:03:23.800]  the new Singapore I wouldn't go with that because it's not as much a financial
[3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:29.880]  center but but you know they are a wealthy country and a major exporter to
[3:03:29.880 --> 3:03:34.600]  the whole Pacific Rim Asian region which is going to be the biggest growth
[3:03:34.600 --> 3:03:38.320]  energy in the future I mean most developed countries are not going to grow
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:42.880]  as fast including the US we got much better demographics in Europe but but
[3:03:42.880 --> 3:03:47.680]  again we should be attracting good the high skilled people because because we
[3:03:47.680 --> 3:03:51.720]  have a board at our next generation so we need to import people I get that we
[3:03:51.720 --> 3:03:55.680]  just don't need welfare moms that will vote democratic I mean literally with
[3:03:55.680 --> 3:03:59.480]  five kids I mean this is this is national suicide we have our quotas on
[3:03:59.480 --> 3:04:03.200]  the high skilled people that we come over here and attract to educate in the
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:06.600]  best universities in the world and then we let people run across the border so
[3:04:06.600 --> 3:04:11.480]  it's not a good immigration policy it's a way to destroy a country Harry Dent
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:15.200]  thank you so much for the time with us sure enjoyed it before dark damn later
[3:04:15.200 --> 3:04:18.440]  and again Harry's a really great guy I agree with him on the economics but you
[3:04:18.440 --> 3:04:21.080]  could see what a nice guy is from the perspective he's like all they got
[3:04:21.080 --> 3:04:26.440]  cameras they don't let you speed but but again it's that attitude of like well
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:29.880]  the system you know is out of control it's corrupt it's dumb but you know all
[3:04:29.880 --> 3:04:33.640]  the cameras you know they're gonna make people be law abiding and see that's so
[3:04:33.640 --> 3:04:39.080]  much the problem is that is that you can always have a good argument for what
[3:04:39.080 --> 3:04:42.440]  the system's doing until you see if another angle but that was my point on
[3:04:42.440 --> 3:04:49.960]  the cameras but all will tell in time glad I was able to get into the
[3:04:49.960 --> 3:04:53.400]  broadcast today great job with the crew I'll take a lot of calls that's a big
