[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:23.240]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.240 --> 00:29.680]  alright just unbelievable betrayal we know it was coming but it's so intense
[00:29.680 --> 00:37.040]  it's so over the top it's so hardcore it's just amazingly blatant it's what
[00:37.040 --> 00:43.600]  the new orders doing everywhere they're just over the top on every issue it's
[00:43.600 --> 00:46.480]  now coming out to that of course they're not really shutting down the
[00:46.480 --> 00:50.520]  concentration camp the torture centers of the United States Obama threatened
[00:50.520 --> 00:55.720]  England and their courts not to bring out secret information about British and
[00:55.720 --> 01:00.680]  US forces torturing people viciously or they would cut off intelligence to them
[01:00.680 --> 01:07.000]  and so we now have Obama protecting the torturers even the New York Times and
[01:07.000 --> 01:14.920]  the London Telegraph and AP admit that there are no caps on CEO bonuses or
[01:14.920 --> 01:19.440]  salaries it's all a stinking lie now you can debate all day whether or not the
[01:19.440 --> 01:24.240]  government should be in the business of capping salaries but the whole thing is
[01:24.240 --> 01:30.000]  a diversion and distraction and it's a blatant lie all the major banks and
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.680]  brokerage firms all the heavy hitters the Federal Reserve shareholders the real
[01:35.680 --> 01:42.280]  global banks not your little Main Street Bank they are exempt and the media
[01:42.280 --> 01:47.400]  keeps talking about billions stolen it's trillions stolen and their secret of
[01:47.400 --> 01:51.560]  about where it all went so he's completely lied about that but he's
[01:51.560 --> 01:55.880]  running nothing you can't even blame Obama remember he's a puppet I'm not
[01:55.880 --> 02:00.020]  gonna be distracted and diverted by the paper cutout I'm gonna look past him to
[02:00.020 --> 02:05.440]  the puppeteer who is pulling the strings so we'll go over that Al Gore got
[02:05.440 --> 02:11.240]  taped talking to a group of 12-year-old middle schoolers 7th and 8th graders
[02:11.240 --> 02:17.600]  11 and 12 years old saying how their parents are basically stupid and the
[02:17.600 --> 02:21.360]  state knows best and I want to go over this because Glenn Beck played a clip of
[02:21.360 --> 02:26.640]  it I want to play the clip today and give you some more intense background on
[02:26.640 --> 02:31.720]  all of this when Beck had talked about this being like Nazi Germany he got
[02:31.720 --> 02:36.680]  criticized this is exactly what they did in Nazi Germany but but side issue I've
[02:36.680 --> 02:40.080]  really gone after Glenn Beck in the past because he said Ron Paul people are
[02:40.080 --> 02:43.720]  dangerous he said the military should be used against us he made fun of the New
[02:43.720 --> 02:48.560]  World Order now suddenly he's totally flipped and it's like Alex Jones has a
[02:48.560 --> 02:54.120]  Fox News TV show but I guarantee you think I've already seen this he's still
[02:54.120 --> 02:58.400]  mixing in New World Order propaganda the establishment knows that anti-New World
[02:58.400 --> 03:04.120]  Order anti-globalist sentiment is the majority it's now a large portion it's
[03:04.120 --> 03:06.800]  the largest minority is everything's broken into minorities you've got a
[03:06.800 --> 03:10.760]  minority of Obama idiots an Obama of Russia limbaugh mainline conservatives
[03:10.760 --> 03:16.800]  but the largest sector the largest piece no doubt from all the statistics and
[03:16.800 --> 03:20.160]  numbers and data we have is people now know about world government they now
[03:20.160 --> 03:23.400]  know about the Illuminati the New World Order and so Glenn Beck is gonna get
[03:23.400 --> 03:28.480]  everybody trusting him and then he's gonna betray Bill O'Reilly eight nine
[03:28.480 --> 03:32.800]  ten years ago would have people on like Tony Brown talking about the New World
[03:32.800 --> 03:37.680]  Order the Illuminati the Bilderberg group how Kennedy was assassinated and Frank
[03:37.680 --> 03:44.800]  Sturges and and he Howard Hunt what is he like today total establishment saying
[03:44.800 --> 03:47.920]  don't question the government more time do whatever they say you watch you'll
[03:47.920 --> 03:55.000]  see a flip-flop within two years from Glenn Beck because it's owned by news
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.200]  core news core in the Wall Street Journal is calling for world government
[03:58.200 --> 04:03.600]  North American Union it's pushing that agenda back when we had a chance to
[04:03.600 --> 04:09.160]  really stop it by electing Ron Paul the mainstream media came in with Beck and
[04:09.160 --> 04:16.480]  and and really zapped Ron Paul and so now that they think it's too late for us
[04:16.480 --> 04:19.960]  to stop them they still want to pose like they're with the people so
[04:19.960 --> 04:23.040]  sophisticated dance going on there but I don't want to divert off into Glenn
[04:23.040 --> 04:27.640]  Beck I'll forget Glenn Beck on the show and you know Glenn Beck may have just
[04:27.640 --> 04:31.000]  caved into the pressure I mean I know he got hundreds of thousands of phone
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  calls and emails when you attack Ron Paul and said 9-11 truthers were terrorists
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.480]  and rest of it so hey you know if he's coming around fine but there's one
[04:40.480 --> 04:44.080]  chance out of about a hundred that that's the case but hey hope springs
[04:44.080 --> 04:48.720]  eternal regardless we march on with the real hardcore info beyond the cutting
[04:48.720 --> 04:54.560]  edge straight ahead all of Obama's betrayals new gun control bills and a

[10:00.120 --> 10:05.800]  little corner of the media universe and we'll be passing by the prison planet
[10:05.800 --> 10:20.440]  soon enough side issue here a couple days ago I did a breakdown of TVA
[10:20.440 --> 10:24.960]  ads one from the Super Bowl was that Tuesday or Monday
[10:24.960 --> 10:30.560]  jaren what day did I show the Tuesday I showed the ads where they're talking
[10:30.560 --> 10:33.760]  about how wonderful high fructose corn syrup is and you're an idiot if it
[10:33.760 --> 10:36.440]  doesn't think you're if you don't think it's good for you and there's nothing
[10:36.440 --> 10:39.800]  bad in it and they say what's your facts are the guy that thinks it's bad and he
[10:39.800 --> 10:43.520]  he can't talk he's stupid and you know they asked some woman why she doesn't
[10:43.520 --> 10:46.600]  like it and she can't talk and stutters and it's stupid then I held up
[10:46.600 --> 10:50.520]  documents where the mainstream news articles where they admit that half of
[10:50.520 --> 10:57.400]  high fructose corn syrup products have high levels of mercury alone in them you
[10:57.400 --> 11:03.400]  know there's your facts and all the diabetes information and how it increases
[11:03.400 --> 11:11.160]  hunger doesn't doesn't fill you up and I also did an analysis of a Super Bowl
[11:11.160 --> 11:15.040]  lab with Alec Baldwin they talk about TV destroying your brain and then they say
[11:15.040 --> 11:17.960]  space aliens are doing it that way if you talk about watching a lot of TV
[11:17.960 --> 11:22.160]  destroying your brain giving you Alzheimer's and brain damage by keeping
[11:22.160 --> 11:26.680]  you in a lower state of consciousness I don't mean that as in a new age way I
[11:26.680 --> 11:31.200]  mean literal brain waves are lower that now oh you think the space aliens did it
[11:31.200 --> 11:35.960]  makes a joke out of it and I punched up on screen the BBC and other publications
[11:35.960 --> 11:39.760]  with studies admitting that watching lots of television does literally brain
[11:39.760 --> 11:48.320]  damage you it brain damages you brain damages you video games are even worse
[11:48.320 --> 11:53.920]  am I attacking video games I'm just stating the facts here I played my
[11:53.920 --> 12:01.560]  fair share years ago decades ago and then I went through some other clips that
[12:01.560 --> 12:06.160]  was such an important part of that prison planet dot TV broadcast and I never
[12:06.160 --> 12:10.880]  when we saw more cash for the radio and I never you know something I think it'll
[12:10.880 --> 12:14.080]  be huge on the web people rip it from prison planet on TV and post it
[12:14.080 --> 12:18.280]  everywhere that's never what's huge it's always something else that was just a
[12:18.280 --> 12:21.320]  little side issue that gets you know hundreds of thousands and then millions
[12:21.320 --> 12:26.720]  of years I want that video to be grabbed off prison planet dot TV and posted all
[12:26.720 --> 12:29.840]  over so please help us out with that folks don't have the personnel get it
[12:29.840 --> 12:33.200]  done ourselves so I think that's important information people see because I
[12:33.200 --> 12:36.840]  was talking to somebody out my front lawn this morning and they were going
[12:36.840 --> 12:40.840]  hey have you seen these high fructose corn syrup ads Alex is that stuff bad
[12:40.840 --> 12:45.320]  for you because of the run an ad saying it's good for you it must be bad I was
[12:45.320 --> 12:51.680]  telling my neighbor no you're dead on target and I just covered that see my
[12:51.680 --> 12:54.680]  neighbor isn't into all this stuff but there's someone familiar with what I do
[12:54.680 --> 12:59.240]  and you know when I first moved in where I live the neighbor was kind of
[12:59.240 --> 13:02.720]  giggling at me when they saw me now they're not giggling anymore and I see
[13:02.720 --> 13:07.880]  that as an important beta test or microcosm of the wider world and what's
[13:07.880 --> 13:12.160]  happening so I do go through those television ads and I'm going to start
[13:12.160 --> 13:18.560]  doing that more and more have we set up joey's email yet joey at info wars
[13:18.560 --> 13:25.520]  dot com and does I guess we need to set up we have two robs here now we need to
[13:25.520 --> 13:30.360]  set up the the new Rob the second producer we need to set up an email for
[13:30.360 --> 13:37.600]  him maybe rob and his initial and info wars dot com we'll get that done good
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.920]  because because I'm gonna start programming this show a little bit more
[13:41.920 --> 13:46.920]  heavily because right now it's just I go wild do whatever I want the time gets
[13:46.920 --> 13:52.240]  away from me and my programming I mean planning out segments a little more
[13:52.240 --> 13:57.760]  we'll still have some free for all because there's so much need to get to
[13:57.760 --> 14:03.400]  it every day I want you to email us tips and then links because most commercials
[14:03.400 --> 14:07.560]  get up getting posted on the web to a commercial you think's interesting and
[14:07.560 --> 14:12.360]  you think has propaganda in it and then I will watch the commercial I will pick
[14:12.360 --> 14:15.640]  from the commercials you send us we will play it here on air and then break it
[14:15.640 --> 14:20.440]  down or you can send us clips of TV shows with anti-family anti-self-defense
[14:20.440 --> 14:25.640]  messages anti sovereignty messages they're everywhere we can't keep track of
[14:25.640 --> 14:29.840]  it number one I don't have time to watch TV number two it's torture for me to
[14:29.840 --> 14:33.160]  watch television is the propaganda so insulting and so frustrating it makes me
[14:33.160 --> 14:36.480]  feel so desperate to beat these people it's just so overt with the enemy
[14:36.480 --> 14:40.120]  layering on our face and I know there's all these billions of people just
[14:40.120 --> 14:46.280]  totally unconscious to the factor being assaulted with with programming and in
[14:46.280 --> 14:52.280]  you know all of this so you can aggregate all that boil it down and be part
[14:52.280 --> 15:01.560]  of the show so send those to Joey Joey V and info wars.com isn't it pardon me
[15:01.560 --> 15:12.080]  David it is Joey V they they both work okay there we go I'm so busy here when
[15:12.080 --> 15:16.400]  I get in here in the morning and that we literally do radio show planning here
[15:16.400 --> 15:24.440]  on the air but that's good it's total transparencies what we're all about so
[15:24.440 --> 15:30.000]  help us out with that because I watched few hours of TV this weekend which I
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.160]  hardly ever do and I just every commercial was propaganda every newscast
[15:34.160 --> 15:41.640]  was brainwashing everything was deception I it is a tissue of lies and
[15:41.640 --> 15:51.920]  spin or they'll take the truth and then stack lies on it or it's just amazing so
[15:51.920 --> 15:56.760]  Dr. Stan Monty Jason Burmese Aaron Zellman joining us and who knows the
[15:56.760 --> 16:06.440]  professor Griff will be popping in all right let's go ahead and get into the
[16:06.440 --> 16:13.880]  news right now we are two and a half weeks into the swearing in the
[16:13.880 --> 16:19.040]  coronation of Barack Obama the most fully financed by Wall Street and the
[16:19.040 --> 16:23.600]  globalist presidential candidate ever seen you lot George Bush senior and Bill

[16:44.520 --> 16:47.680]  closing on time oh but if you read the executive order it says they will look in
[16:47.680 --> 16:52.400]  the next year at closing on time oh and closing other camps but we'll but we'll
[16:52.400 --> 16:56.920]  keep other secret camps the secret camps the real camps around the world open

[18:50.760 --> 18:54.240]  Liberties Union which has generally been harshly critical of President George
[18:54.240 --> 19:01.280]  Bush and praiseworthy of Obama has fired a torpedo across Obama bow after the
[19:01.280 --> 19:05.360]  and that's only happening because their members who aren't controlled leaders are

[19:24.620 --> 19:28.400]  intelligence sharing the Obama administration offered a terse statement
[19:28.400 --> 19:33.400]  seemingly expressing support for President Bush's statement to the BBC the
[19:33.400 --> 19:36.240]  United States thanks the UK government for its continued commitment to protect
[19:36.240 --> 19:39.600]  sensitive national security information and prefers the long-standing

[24:34.640 --> 24:40.920]  Obama administration's position is not changed it is more of the same this
[24:40.920 --> 24:46.040]  represents a complete turnaround and undermining of the restoration of the
[24:46.040 --> 24:51.840]  rule of law the American administration shouldn't be complicit in hiding the
[24:51.840 --> 24:58.600]  abuses of its predecessors hey I get the straight ACLU they are continuing the
[24:58.600 --> 25:07.240]  abuses of the predecessor George W. Bush now we meet the new boss same as the old
[25:07.240 --> 25:13.800]  boss the United States thanks the UK government for a continued commitment to
[25:13.800 --> 25:17.120]  protect sensitive national security information and preserve the long-standing
[25:17.120 --> 25:21.680]  intelligence-sharing relationship that enables both countries to protect their
[25:21.680 --> 25:28.160]  citizens that's what the White House State Department spokespersons said so
[25:28.160 --> 25:36.240]  two days ago on Tuesday a British high court said this person has been tortured
[25:36.240 --> 25:40.720]  secretly arrested secretly held in two torture camps before flown to
[25:40.720 --> 25:47.040]  Guantanamo British tortures oversaw the US and other third-party tortures this
[25:47.040 --> 25:54.240]  is outrageous and we have the government documents and the response was by the
[25:54.240 --> 25:59.720]  White House was to internally threaten the British government that they would
[25:59.720 --> 26:02.680]  stop sharing intelligence with them if they allowed this information to come
[26:02.680 --> 26:07.840]  out the fact that it was sanctioned and ordered not a few rogues and they're
[26:07.840 --> 26:11.520]  getting rough you know the you know the guys just got a little little overblown
[26:11.520 --> 26:16.400]  there this was scientifically applied torture to create patsies and people to
[26:16.400 --> 26:21.560]  confess the things they didn't do we'll get more into that later that's been
[26:21.560 --> 26:27.600]  proven and then 10 Downing Street came out the Prime Minister came out the
[26:27.600 --> 26:30.640]  spokesman for 10 Downing Street came out and said this is not true they've not
[26:30.640 --> 26:34.120]  threatened this it's not true but they didn't check with each other in the
[26:34.120 --> 26:38.360]  lying because right at that time Obama issued a statement saying yes we'll
[26:38.360 --> 26:45.680]  jerk intelligence on you oh man just just incredible and I shouldn't laugh
[26:45.680 --> 26:51.760]  about it all it's just completely sick and notice right on time as all of this
[26:51.760 --> 26:56.400]  is happening two of the people held in Guantanamo for years pop up in classic
[26:56.400 --> 27:02.280]  Islamic dress making mean faces in classic cent com propaganda remember the
[27:02.280 --> 27:05.680]  former head of black ops at the Pentagon former CIA black ops commander
[27:05.680 --> 27:11.360]  before that number two but up beneath a Rumsfeld is the head of the Intel
[27:11.360 --> 27:17.120]  Center that's been caught uploading the videos of al-Qaeda tapes Adam Gadan the
[27:17.120 --> 27:20.880]  ADL head grandson the rest of them and give me a brother the grandson of the
[27:20.880 --> 27:24.560]  ADL who used to go put in jail for beating up Muslims outside mosque he
[27:24.560 --> 27:29.280]  ate them so much pops up as the number three in al-Qaeda and then they look at
[27:29.280 --> 27:35.440]  the al-Qaeda watermark on the video if it's in the same video layer as the
[27:35.440 --> 27:41.800]  Intel Center logo this is so ridiculous if it wasn't so hardcore vicious and
[27:41.800 --> 27:48.240]  evil and right on time they insert their operatives into the camps to put them
[27:48.240 --> 27:53.600]  in with the other prisoners to spy on them to report on them and then they
[27:53.600 --> 27:59.900]  take them back out and put them out with quote Islamic radical cred on the
[27:59.900 --> 28:03.800]  streets of the world to go out and form new al-Qaeda grips with patsies under
[28:03.800 --> 28:08.640]  them to carry out attacks over and over again you'll hear about somebody in
[28:08.640 --> 28:11.960]  custody for two three years in the headlines I could pull these up right
[28:11.960 --> 28:17.360]  now we've covered them you can say you know al-Qaeda cap a captive was
[28:17.360 --> 28:21.520]  informant or was agent that's a good headline for you to pull up it's happened
[28:21.520 --> 28:25.080]  many times will just be a blurb in the main press but mainly foreign press
[28:25.080 --> 28:29.520]  French or German or Dutch or Russian or British it's sometimes in the US it'll
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.600]  say oh yeah they secretly held him at a camp for three years because if they
[28:33.600 --> 28:37.280]  wouldn't have done that radical Muslims would have put a photo out on him and
[28:37.280 --> 28:41.040]  would have killed him because he was an infiltrator but they're always the
[28:41.040 --> 28:45.280]  leaders of the groups every time you hear about some case in Ohio or Michigan
[28:45.280 --> 28:51.600]  or or Toronto Canada it'll be an operative and they'll say oh police
[28:51.600 --> 28:54.920]  just busted a group of radical Muslims planning to blow something up with a
[28:54.920 --> 28:58.920]  money of nitrate and then three or four months later when the trial starts it
[28:58.920 --> 29:03.480]  always falls apart and they basically mistrial it or they plea bargain people
[29:03.480 --> 29:08.360]  out for nothing the teenagers the street kids Miami it was the same case that the
[29:08.360 --> 29:14.680]  feds either agents or their informants will go start the group I mean they
[29:14.680 --> 29:18.120]  don't just go infiltrate a group they go start one find idiots
[29:18.120 --> 29:22.520]  unexperienced morons lead them format try to get them to blow something up
[29:22.520 --> 29:25.920]  they're always too inept to do it so they just bust them with materials or
[29:25.920 --> 29:30.960]  with manuals and then they'll even put the informant in jail a while to kind of
[29:30.960 --> 29:33.920]  cover that up that the fact they were fed but then later release them and they
[29:33.920 --> 29:37.920]  get multi-million dollar cash payments and so these guys are up on TV right
[29:37.920 --> 29:42.800]  now it's just such an insult to everyone's intelligence all right we get
[29:42.800 --> 29:48.600]  back oh Obama's gonna put a cap on the rich people's money you believe that I

[33:47.880 --> 33:56.720]  it's coming out fast day by day that Barack Obama makes Bill Clinton look
[33:56.720 --> 34:03.520]  raw when it comes to slickness and deceit Bill Clinton does not deserve the
[34:03.520 --> 34:11.760]  title of slick willy when we're talking about him and comparison to Barack
[34:11.760 --> 34:17.680]  Obama he is slick but it doesn't matter the people don't trust government now
[34:17.680 --> 34:20.880]  like never before they're getting back their good instincts their common sense
[34:20.880 --> 34:28.760]  approach and his minions are finding out fast my only problem trying to make this
[34:28.760 --> 34:34.400]  Obama film is I keep updating it with the new betrayals that just race out
[34:34.400 --> 34:40.960]  we're gonna be done with it around March 6th have it mastered March 7th it'll
[34:40.960 --> 34:48.280]  go to the factory March 8th and by March 14th we will have them or start
[34:48.280 --> 34:53.080]  pre-orders here in a few weeks and I'm dedicated to this I'm dedicated to
[34:53.080 --> 34:59.040]  making the Obama deception which is just a devastating torpedo to their fraud in
[34:59.040 --> 35:04.680]  their lives the Obama deception net is the website by the way before I get
[35:04.680 --> 35:09.000]  back into all these betrayals ladies and gentlemen do not forget that we are
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.960]  trying to expand as the new world order moves forward expanding its operations
[35:12.960 --> 35:16.160]  against humanity because there are fertile fields out there in the minds
[35:16.160 --> 35:20.440]  of men and women who want to hear the truth now and so we're intensifying
[35:20.440 --> 35:23.800]  everything we're doing here and we need your support more than ever but that
[35:23.800 --> 35:26.960]  itself as a side issue compared to the fact of the films the books the videos

[36:27.120 --> 36:29.840]  transmission we do for at least two hours every day some days three or four
[36:29.840 --> 36:34.800]  hours the whole radio shows sound will cast in the visual realm as well I do
[36:34.800 --> 36:39.320]  the whole four-hour show but focusing on cameras directing it myself doing three
[36:39.320 --> 36:43.800]  four hours is just completely exhausting on top of four hours of radio so
[36:43.800 --> 36:46.000]  we're gonna probably keep it down about two hours most days unless the
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.960]  guests are just too big but on the subject of prison planet on TV we had a
[36:49.960 --> 36:53.920]  Christmas special we extended into a new year special to get five plus months
[36:53.920 --> 36:57.960]  free and I've just been so busy I forgot to have Paul Watson take the special
[36:57.960 --> 37:04.320]  down and so that special will run until next Monday next Monday and then next

[37:26.560 --> 37:29.400]  quality a great activist tool to burn them to this and get them out to folks
[37:29.400 --> 37:40.680]  prison planet dot TV okay so recapping Obama has lied and appointed a bunch of
[37:40.680 --> 37:44.840]  Defense Department banking and other lobbyists directly into cabinet and
[37:44.840 --> 37:49.440]  sub-cabinet positions he's lied and gone back on saying he'd go after nafta and
[37:49.440 --> 37:56.360]  gat he's singing out supports it loves it he has lied on he said he wasn't gonna
[37:56.360 --> 38:00.000]  push for more gun control they're introduced massive bills rampaging
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.200]  forward the most devastating victim disarmament second amendment annihilating
[38:04.200 --> 38:13.720]  bills ever seen just unbelievable he has lied about just countless things
[38:13.720 --> 38:17.120]  beefing up the troops in the Middle East and Central Asia now saying they may
[38:17.120 --> 38:21.840]  not go ahead and even withdraw any of them in the 16 month timetable which they
[38:21.840 --> 38:27.320]  expanded from six months then they'll debate whether you know in 16 months
[38:27.320 --> 38:31.600]  whether it should be another 16 months the same scam same game same things all
[38:31.600 --> 38:35.400]  of it and then he comes out in support of secret arrest secret detention
[38:35.400 --> 38:39.760]  rendition and then when courts are about to bring forward evidence of US and
[38:39.760 --> 38:44.080]  British organized ordered torture which is in all the memos I mean big
[38:44.080 --> 38:49.720]  surprise they threaten Britain to block the release of it and then people spin
[38:49.720 --> 38:52.840]  it in the media yesterday and say Obama didn't do that and then he reaffirms
[38:52.840 --> 39:05.240]  yes we did make that threat so you have that and there's many other lies but the
[39:05.240 --> 39:09.680]  most over the top one so far has been in the last few weeks where every day he
[39:09.680 --> 39:15.160]  goes out gives a speech and says this is outrageous this is ridiculous that we've
[39:15.160 --> 39:20.720]  got hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses and things to executives and
[39:20.720 --> 39:25.800]  increases in pay while while millions of people are losing their jobs meanwhile
[39:25.800 --> 39:31.560]  he's bought and paid for by these people Geithner his new Treasury Secretary is
[39:31.560 --> 39:34.840]  one of the main architects of changing the rules in the 90s with Clinton so they
[39:34.840 --> 39:37.760]  could do all of this that Bush of course continued as a cheerleader
[39:37.760 --> 39:43.440]  nonpartisan theft group of rogues posing like carnival markers will act like
[39:43.440 --> 39:46.360]  they're fighting with each other you know don't go to his ride go to my ride
[39:46.360 --> 39:54.280]  you'll felt like he's your friend go on that rider good cop bad cop so he's up
[39:54.280 --> 39:58.320]  there every day saying I can't believe this bailout this is horrible this bail
[39:58.320 --> 40:01.680]  out didn't work because you stole all the money hundreds of millions of
[40:01.680 --> 40:07.360]  dollars it's really not billions it's trillions billions and billions and
[40:07.360 --> 40:11.800]  billions per brokerage firm and bank in bonuses and in pay raises to the
[40:11.800 --> 40:15.600]  executives as they let go all the retail banker workers because that's not
[40:15.600 --> 40:19.120]  needed anymore they're imploding the economy it's just all a vertical
[40:19.120 --> 40:22.880]  integrated conduit like a giant mosquitoes sucking it dry or a tick
[40:22.880 --> 40:26.960]  sucking something dry it's like a 200 pound tick sucking a hundred pound
[40:26.960 --> 40:33.960]  country dry and then he comes out yesterday and introduces a new idea he
[40:33.960 --> 40:38.760]  says we'll have salary caps throughout industry not just banking but the car
[40:38.760 --> 40:42.520]  industry and anything else in the economy that's in trouble setting the
[40:42.520 --> 40:47.040]  precedent this is double-edged setting the precedent for the federal government
[40:47.040 --> 40:52.240]  to have a managed completely controlled economy run by the central banks of the
[40:52.240 --> 40:56.840]  wall street banks that have hijacked washington but it's being sold as if
[40:56.840 --> 41:01.760]  it's an anti wall street corruption move just like wall street put out ads and
[41:01.760 --> 41:06.600]  editorials attacking the fellow reserve act of 1913 for three years before its
[41:06.600 --> 41:11.120]  passage with JP Morgan and others in the Rockefeller saying we don't want this
[41:11.120 --> 41:17.800]  banking act we do not want the federal reserve it's bad no and the public some
[41:17.800 --> 41:21.920]  of them got fooled and went well then I'm for it I'm for the federal reserve act
[41:21.920 --> 41:28.440]  that'll teach those nasty bankers and stop any depressions or stop any CEO pay
[41:28.720 --> 41:32.560]  there's no discussion of the bank shareholders the private secret
[41:32.560 --> 41:34.800]  shareholders are making the real profits here it's all about the little
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.440]  puppets they put in so there's lies within lies within lies within lies
[41:39.440 --> 41:45.400]  within lies on top of lies stacked on top of lies with still more frauds and
[41:45.400 --> 41:55.800]  spin and corruption and double thing added to it so that's going on and then
[41:55.800 --> 41:59.640]  he comes so imagine taking over the economy that's what they say the new
[41:59.640 --> 42:03.440]  global central bank that they call the bad bank will do it will set interest
[42:03.440 --> 42:07.280]  rates globally will set currencies globally it will if a country doesn't go
[42:07.280 --> 42:10.040]  along with it they'll put sanctions on them they won't allow their money to
[42:10.040 --> 42:14.720]  transfer globally this is the new world order a world government run for buy it
[42:14.720 --> 42:20.200]  off the banks but the select enter banks snatching up the other smaller
[42:20.200 --> 42:24.080]  financial institutions the insurance companies main street banks state banks
[42:24.080 --> 42:30.800]  regional banks real banks credit unions but going after industry to bankrupting
[42:30.800 --> 42:34.160]  everything having the government come in with unlimited fiat currency and say
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.440]  we'll buy a share in you but now you're under our executive control but those
[42:38.440 --> 42:42.400]  federal executives themselves take orders from the private roundtable groups
[42:42.400 --> 42:46.560]  the shadow government which is now not shadow coming out in the open in the
[42:46.560 --> 42:49.840]  financial times of london and newsweek and wall street journal and hundreds of
[42:49.840 --> 42:53.440]  other publications come out and say the only thing they'll say the economy is a
[42:53.440 --> 42:57.480]  north american union is a merger with the EU is a new global currency regional
[42:57.480 --> 43:00.960]  currencies and the bankers running everything exactly what David Rockefeller
[43:00.960 --> 43:04.600]  wrote about many times on a world government run and determined by the
[43:04.600 --> 43:12.120]  private banks and not the population fact I meant to read that quote and I
[43:12.120 --> 43:14.640]  lifted out the car during the break I'll run out and get it coming and read it in
[43:14.640 --> 43:21.720]  the next segment one of many quotes people can't ever believe these David
[43:21.720 --> 43:26.340]  Rockefeller quotes congratulating in 77 the Kremlin on their wonderful party in
[43:26.340 --> 43:30.960]  the communist system congratulating mouse a tongue I've actually gone out to the
[43:30.960 --> 43:36.320]  library and gotten the news articles it came from these are real quotes you're
[43:36.320 --> 43:39.240]  like why would international banker worth trillions of dollars leverage be
[43:39.240 --> 43:42.200]  for communism because it in communism it's a bunch of thugs robbing the
[43:42.200 --> 43:49.760]  daylights out of you and kill in the middle class so Obama wants to take
[43:49.760 --> 43:54.240]  over the entire economy with the banks backing him up in the name of stopping
[43:54.240 --> 44:00.440]  the banks beautiful propaganda beautiful deception but it is in the news
[44:00.440 --> 44:04.840]  that there are quote loopholes of all the major brokerage houses and all the
[44:04.840 --> 44:10.760]  major banks and so the federal regulators they will selectively with
[44:10.760 --> 44:14.120]  smaller banks go in and squeeze them and take them over
[44:14.120 --> 44:18.400]  Obama's executive orders have loopholes what this is out of the
[44:18.400 --> 44:24.400]  Washington Times president Obama's first moves earned him triumphant headlines
[44:24.400 --> 44:29.720]  Obama freezes pay toughens ethics and lobbying rules and Obama sets new
[44:29.720 --> 44:33.880]  course but some of the biggest accomplishments are twined with the
[44:33.880 --> 44:37.200]  word but lobbyists are banned but exceptions can be and will be made
[44:37.200 --> 44:41.160]  orders are ending torture and secret prisons contain loopholes and provisos
[44:41.160 --> 44:46.240]  call it the fine print an exception a waiver but there have been caveats to
[44:46.240 --> 44:49.800]  many of mr. Obama's first actions the lobbying issue has drawn the most
[44:49.800 --> 44:54.000]  higher especially since mr. Obama spent so much time blasting lobbyist on
[44:54.000 --> 45:01.240]  Capitol Hill change we can believe in as long as we pay attention to the word
[45:01.240 --> 45:09.000]  change complained Rachel Maddow liberal talk show host for MSNBC as long as we
[45:09.000 --> 45:16.560]  pay attention to the disappointing esoteric on the word change and it
[45:16.560 --> 45:22.960]  goes on from there some old fudges and loopholes in Obama's new era of ethics
[45:22.960 --> 45:28.280]  London Telegraph goes through it executive loopholes Forbes whether the
[45:28.280 --> 45:31.600]  stimulus bill passes or not president Obama can rest easy knowing he's
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.240]  created work for one creative group of workers lawyers why is planned to curb
[45:36.240 --> 45:41.360]  executive compensation firms that receive taxpayer money including five
[45:41.360 --> 45:45.080]  hundred thousand dollar salary caps for top bosses restrictions on stock
[45:45.080 --> 45:51.440]  compensation and broader limits on golden parachutes is a choke block with
[45:51.440 --> 45:57.160]  loopholes and it goes on whenever the government lays down new rules for
[45:57.160 --> 46:00.480]  corporate America firms will naturally determine the minimum effort for
[46:00.480 --> 46:08.480]  compliance and it goes on and there's chase Manhattan City Bank Bank of
[46:08.480 --> 46:14.480]  America Wells Fargo and then all the big was only five of them private
[46:14.480 --> 46:18.640]  central banks that hold stock in the Federal Reserve they're just completely
[46:18.640 --> 46:22.680]  exempt I couldn't believe it when even when I've got a club of Fox News
[46:22.680 --> 46:26.440]  admitting it right after Obama's speech reading the text of the executive order
[46:26.440 --> 46:30.760]  and it goes on to say there's much murkiness in the language so it's all
[46:30.760 --> 46:39.560]  a bunch of legalese there here is a CNBC headline on it hunt on for loopholes
[46:39.560 --> 46:46.680]  and Obama executive pay banks find loopholes in pay limits and then of
[46:46.680 --> 46:49.360]  course there's the psychological terrorism they're using to get it done
[46:49.360 --> 46:52.320]  Gordon Brown saying there'll be a worldwide depression if you don't do
[46:52.320 --> 46:56.080]  this you don't give the banks unlimited power same thing with Obama
[46:56.080 --> 47:04.080]  Obama warns of catastrophe without stimulus on and on and on and it's the
[47:04.080 --> 47:08.720]  same psychology Cheney warns of new attacks unless Obama keeps rendition and
[47:08.720 --> 47:13.360]  torture and all the rest of it in place Gordon Brown suggests world heading for
[47:13.360 --> 47:17.280]  depression if we don't act now thought we just acted giving the banks unlimited
[47:17.280 --> 47:21.880]  power but that's not enough now it's unlimited power over private industry
[47:21.880 --> 47:26.240]  the big central banks they're gonna do whatever they want you know I found a
[47:26.240 --> 47:31.960]  quote in the New York Times last night in research of David Rockefeller and then
[47:31.960 --> 47:35.000]  I tracked it back to other quotes he always is saying similar things that
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.880]  oh I don't pay one dollar an income tax you know the reports of over 60% of
[47:39.880 --> 47:45.600]  Congress not paying income tax just not paying you hear about all these Obama
[47:45.600 --> 47:51.860]  appointments having to step down because I'm not paying taxes the guy that taxes
[47:51.860 --> 47:54.480]  you for the private federal reserve that you know didn't pay a bunch
[47:54.480 --> 48:05.040]  Geithner and I found these quotes were Rockefeller David Rockefeller is saying
[48:05.040 --> 48:09.880]  I don't pay any income tax not one dime but I send a check out of the goodness of
[48:09.880 --> 48:14.680]  my heart you know why he doesn't pay tax because they did another bait and
[48:14.680 --> 48:19.760]  switch they owned the major newspapers in 1905 they ran giant headlines with the
[48:19.760 --> 48:23.760]  bankers yelling and screaming and the robber barons the Carnegie's all of them
[48:23.760 --> 48:30.220]  saying we don't want this and Sherman anti-trust act we don't like Teddy
[48:30.220 --> 48:35.200]  Roosevelt we don't want this no no don't throw me in the briar patch but what
[48:35.200 --> 48:39.920]  does briar rabbit want he lives in the briar patch so when Farmer Brown grabs
[48:39.920 --> 48:43.840]  him and says I'm gonna take you the chop and block and cut your head off and
[48:43.840 --> 48:48.040]  eat you for dinner he says oh please please do that sir just don't throw me
[48:48.040 --> 48:52.960]  in the briar patch whatever you do don't throw me in there that's the last
[48:52.960 --> 48:57.040]  place I want to be so they say oh whatever you do the banks they don't
[48:57.040 --> 49:01.640]  pass this bill taking us over oh giving us power over everything please don't
[49:01.640 --> 49:07.680]  oh oh whatever you do don't pass the Sherman anti-trust act which allowed
[49:07.680 --> 49:14.400]  the billions of dollars per family at that time around 15 major families the
[49:14.400 --> 49:20.040]  melons the Carnegie's the Asters the list goes on and on the Bundy's the Dupont's
[49:20.040 --> 49:26.320]  to put their money into tax-free foundations true trust and they called
[49:26.320 --> 49:32.000]  it an anti-trust act to trick people now the trust was saying they couldn't have
[49:32.000 --> 49:37.680]  giant monopolies that were trust that the monopolies had to be broken up all
[49:37.680 --> 49:40.640]  that it was created an illusion of choice still on by the same thing into
[49:40.640 --> 49:46.400]  sub-trust and when you read about it the Rockefeller family pays zero tax they
[49:46.400 --> 49:51.560]  own giant palaces helicopters they control whole universities they they
[49:51.560 --> 49:56.600]  control over half of the medical business in this country cancer research I
[49:56.600 --> 50:02.160]  mean they just own it all they almost single-handedly bankrolled Hitler and
[50:02.160 --> 50:09.080]  eugenics just one family we're looking at and they don't pay one dime in taxes
[50:09.080 --> 50:15.960]  now in the modern age they allow a few special people to do this Warren Buffett
[50:15.960 --> 50:20.120]  has put more than 50 billion dollars in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

[54:20.720 --> 54:25.400]  take over any institution company business they want who takes federal
[54:25.400 --> 54:29.960]  money it's our tax money they're gonna buy off the executives of every major
[54:29.960 --> 54:35.240]  industry to then hand over those industries to government control the
[54:35.240 --> 54:41.000]  private banks then sit above government controlling it that's why these guys are
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.160]  in control they are incredibly cunning sneaky and deceptive but if you're just
[54:45.160 --> 54:48.000]  aware that they're a bunch of lying bastards and whatever they're doing you
[54:48.000 --> 54:53.600]  want to do the opposite whether it's gun control open borders taxes I don't care
[54:53.600 --> 55:00.040]  you know you but that's not as easy as it sounds because they don't just come
[55:00.040 --> 55:03.760]  out and say we want these banker bailouts now they mislabel it and call it a
[55:03.760 --> 55:08.280]  banker bailout when it's really a takeover so you have to know what their
[55:08.280 --> 55:12.800]  real intent is and then say no to that because it's always not in the people's
[55:12.800 --> 55:19.440]  best interest by the way we have a top volcanologist coming on who is very
[55:19.440 --> 55:26.600]  very concerned about the giant volcano caldera the opening of the volcano that
[55:26.600 --> 55:32.440]  is Yellowstone Yellowstone Park is the mouth of an ancient volcano a mega a
[55:32.440 --> 55:37.200]  super volcano as they're called and they've had 400 earthquakes in the last
[55:37.200 --> 55:42.520]  what six eight months parts of it are rising a couple feet other parts are
[55:42.520 --> 55:47.640]  lowering suddenly the giant magma chamber the batholiff under it is
[55:47.640 --> 55:52.040]  getting under more and more pressure volcanoes all over the world are
[55:52.040 --> 55:57.760]  erupting and we're not saying the volcanoes going to explode but they
[55:57.760 --> 56:01.480]  told people don't worry about Mount St. Helen in 1980 and Mount St. Helen is
[56:01.480 --> 56:09.800]  like my pinky compared to the Empire State's building in known recorded
[56:09.800 --> 56:15.640]  history civilization the primitive civilizations that we know are before
[56:15.640 --> 56:19.680]  somewhat primitive compared to now no one really knows we know there were
[56:19.680 --> 56:23.320]  civilizations that were destroyed by volcanoes and meteors and other things
[56:23.320 --> 56:32.200]  before Egypt and before Babylon we know large areas of Italy were destroyed by
[56:32.200 --> 56:39.080]  volcanoes just the last 3,000 years 25 our years these are tiny little babies
[56:39.080 --> 56:45.040]  compared to mega volcanoes most the mega volcanoes are on the floor of the sea
[56:45.040 --> 56:52.320]  because 75% of the earth is covered with water but right in the middle of the
[56:52.320 --> 56:57.200]  United States is a mega volcano so that's coming up in the fourth hour
[56:57.200 --> 57:01.360]  today I understand my teeth coming up in the next hour
[57:01.360 --> 57:05.800]  Jason Burmese will be simulcasting with us at prisonplanet.tv and Aaron

[57:18.320 --> 57:25.600]  racking up moving very very quickly but they're going back to Obama we're not
[57:25.600 --> 57:29.440]  going to torture we're just going to rename it harsh interrogation we're
[57:29.440 --> 57:35.400]  going to leave Iraq's maybe someday we'll look at it we're not going to hire
[57:35.400 --> 57:41.480]  lobbyist we're going to hire a lot of lobbyist we're not going to let the
[57:41.480 --> 57:44.840]  CEO's river body off of the bailout money we're going to take over the entire
[57:44.840 --> 57:47.160]  economy
[57:47.160 --> 57:51.360]  meanwhile they're talking about this Friday when the new jobless numbers
[57:51.360 --> 57:55.120]  come out they always come out about a week after the last month they're looking
[57:55.120 --> 58:02.080]  at over 500,000 people losing their jobs in the month of January now remember
[58:02.080 --> 58:06.160]  last year we were looking at 200,000 jobs lost on average each month now it's
[58:06.160 --> 58:09.800]  going to be 500,000 and they say it's probably going to accelerate by the end
[58:09.800 --> 58:17.600]  of the year to 1 million jobs being lost per month how does that sound
[58:17.600 --> 58:26.280]  meanwhile they're building FEMA camps and announcing hardcore battle-hardened

[1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:54.880]  happening in Yellowstone he believes it may erupt and then they're talking about
[1:00:54.880 --> 1:01:01.200]  large rock stones being thrown as far away as Texas as far as Minnesota and
[1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:08.960]  ash all around the planet that will darken the planet and make the
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:16.360]  temperature drop as much as 10 degrees but let's go ahead and go to Ted
[1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:19.960]  Anderson for the next four minutes Ted look I'm not gonna belabor this with the
[1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:26.040]  listeners you're at the very end of the goal you had when it was at the 939 40
[1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:29.440]  level I know you're some of the offers about actually had to go up gold is
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:35.920]  right back up at 920 today and racing up even higher folks are completely nut
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:39.720]  bolts if they don't get into gold and silver now with any assets they've got
[1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:46.400]  they need to diversify now these fools are running into US treasuries holding
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:52.200]  paper and their signaling is trillion-dollar stimulus now it's a
[1:01:52.200 --> 1:01:56.480]  trillion point two they're taught it was 900 billion last week they're talking
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:01.960]  about more trillions in a new banker takeover bill Ted tell us again you made
[1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:05.080]  these purchases a week and a half ago you're almost out of the coins what
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:08.800]  coins do you have left at that lower level because gold just continues to
[1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:12.320]  rise okay here's what I have I mean I'm really running short on British
[1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:15.600]  sovereigns now I know I've been talking about those for a long time and I'm not
[1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:19.720]  sure that I'll be able to carry those in the quantities I did like I did last
[1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:25.600]  year but I do have some of them left at 265 the Frank is the one that I can get
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:31.680]  and get to you quickly that one is currently at 217 now Alex last time I
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:34.880]  was on the air I did a little calculation that's when gold was down
[1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:42.080]  around 900 Franks were at 228 at that time and now gold has gone up over 925
[1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:48.520]  and I have the same coins at 217 so a tremendous discount more than it's
[1:02:48.520 --> 1:02:53.240]  $11 less than what I'd have to enter into the marketplace of gold is 900
[1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:57.520]  explain to people explain to people that's a fifth of an ounce coin explain
[1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:02.800]  to people what it even cost you with no markup to even be able to sell it well
[1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:05.560]  that's how much that would cost you now I mean that's the whole thing I mean
[1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:11.120]  right now entering into the marketplace I'm paying almost 220 for the coin so if
[1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:15.960]  for me to for me to sell I mean I can't buy some of something at 220 and sell it
[1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:23.120]  for 220 you know 217 I'll be out of business I can't do that I mean Alex
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:26.960]  the people that bought I mean we had a lot of people buy here when those
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:31.160]  Franks for a 202 just a short while ago and you got to realize that those
[1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:34.680]  people can turn around and sell them back to me right now and have a handsome
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:38.960]  profit and they'd be absolute idiots to do it because right now I mean the
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:44.360]  unemployment figures at this time is right yet yet other people are selling
[1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:50.640]  quarter ounce and and and and put an ounce for 250 300 so I mean this is that
[1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:54.800]  this is crazy you have it for how much for the Frank well right now it's at
[1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:59.520]  217 and that's Alex that's the supply that I bought when gold was back I'm
[1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:05.160]  just really happy I was able to buy it at 800 and at 870 last time adept and
[1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:09.840]  that supply is sitting there ready to go when I'm out over with this 830 range
[1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:14.880]  prices are gonna jump I can't help it it's okay is this the last day I you know
[1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:19.080]  Alex I I it depends about how many people buy I'm gonna hold it until
[1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:22.960]  midnight and I'll sell even what I don't have and and and take a little loss to
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:29.480]  fill the order 800 to 686 2237 gold is it 925 and rising Ted bought this at
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:34.280]  830 and is offering it to you other places with premiums can't even sell you
[1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:42.960]  gold you do not find deals better than this 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 Ted we

[1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:21.280]  are saying it may blow sky-high last time it blew up it devastated large
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:25.360]  parts of North America depends on which direction it explodes they don't
[1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:31.080]  generally explode straight up and out they blast one direction I don't have
[1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:35.480]  to tell you the little kill millions of people if it does blow up remember they
[1:08:35.480 --> 1:08:38.440]  said Mount St. Helens wasn't gonna blow everything was fine that's a tiny
[1:08:38.440 --> 1:08:45.840]  volcano a little bitty baby compared to a super volcano so we're gonna be talking
[1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:55.720]  to the volcanologist coming up later in the transmission today I want to go
[1:08:55.720 --> 1:09:00.080]  back to Ted Anderson while we're getting a Dr. Stan Monteith on the horn Ted so
[1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:08.120]  you've got European Franks Swiss French and others that are running out period
[1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:14.080]  supply-wise you bought them at the 830 level golds now 925 and rising this is
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:16.880]  the very end of them you said you're almost out you said you're really
[1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:19.160]  getting low on sovereigns what's happening there
[1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:23.040]  oh the problem is I'm having trouble importing them we're buying them out of
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:27.440]  Europe and the supply coming into the United States is starting to choke up
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:30.920]  in other words there isn't a whole lot out there so everybody else has run out
[1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:34.800]  but but but you've been there on top cuz you but you've got the supply 30 years
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:37.840]  in the business you're saying you're even having trouble oh yeah I mean we've
[1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:41.640]  sold millions of these things last year Alex and and everybody that owns them
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:45.800]  from last year can sell them for a nice fat profit and it'd be great if they
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:50.600]  would because I need supply but it'd be idiots for doing it right now I mean I
[1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:54.440]  have been shopping around most of my competitors already have these things
[1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:58.920]  priced in the $300 range I'm usually a little less than they are right now if
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:03.640]  I had them I suppose I'd be somewhere around 281 if I'm buying in the
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:09.080]  marketplace but the the biggest problem is I mean I called one wholesaler they
[1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:13.160]  had them they had them in BU conditional that's what they've been getting me at
[1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:17.600]  the regular cost and now they want to have about a $20 premium per coin let's
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:21.760]  be clear these are in collector mint condition and you've been selling them
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:27.120]  at below spot yeah well in many cases I have been because spot is run up so darn
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:32.600]  much the the thing about it is is that the the coin is from the 1800s and
[1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:37.120]  everybody knows that that it's a good idea to be buying the older coins because
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:41.880]  it gives a better argument for gold confiscation and with this administration
[1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:45.680]  and you know and the last one to I mean nobody can trust it there's so many
[1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:49.720]  folks there's no hundred percent in life they can steal your pension funds they
[1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:53.680]  are they can steal your bank accounts they're getting ready to yes they can
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:56.800]  try to come get your gold I mean my grandmother remembers her parents in
[1:10:56.800 --> 1:11:00.960]  Dallas they owned a car dealership it was actually my grandfather's dad on the
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:05.880]  car dealership the point is they remember it to my my my mother's father's dad on
[1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:09.800]  a Chevy dealership with the first in Dallas the point is is that they
[1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:14.840]  remember having to turn the gold in but they kind of wink wink didn't do it so
[1:11:14.840 --> 1:11:18.520]  you know this is the last line of defense and we're not even saying that's safe
[1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:24.760]  it's the safest thing there is 800-686-2237 yeah Alice for there's no
[1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:28.640]  question about it right now I mean you if you're gonna stay in the paper markets
[1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:32.400]  right now you're gonna be toast I mean we're entering into a certain into a
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:39.040]  situation that'll be very very similar to the depression of the 1930s or even
[1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:42.880]  way worse than that and companies that you think you could rely on are gonna be
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:47.680]  gone I mean Chrysler Corporation right now is about ready to fall apart
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:52.120]  completely like be gone you know and who would ever thought something that big
[1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:57.000]  would fail and of course the the big banks that got all the bailout money
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.800]  you know I mean that's what that's a Baraka's pushing on or Obama I'm sorry
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:06.840]  is pushing on so hard you know it it just right now there's just too many
[1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:10.680]  problems and every time I get a chance if there's a dip in the marketplace I'm
[1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:16.600]  buying and and as much quantity as I can get the problem is I never can get
[1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:21.320]  enough all right so almost everybody else's run out you're now getting close
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:25.840]  to that point other coins you've got to offer well you asked me about silver and
[1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:29.720]  and one of the few things that I have a big supply on right now that I can
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:34.960]  deliver without any problems as mercury dimes I really took a position on with
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:40.360]  those things when when when the gold was down there at about 700 just just about
[1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:46.920]  720 right in that range the the the silver market was closer to 9 but be
[1:12:46.920 --> 1:12:51.160]  trading between 9 and 10 and so now we're up here around 12 and I still
[1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:54.600]  have those dimes and I and I just want to get those in the hands of the people
[1:12:54.600 --> 1:12:58.200]  I mean the main thing is you can buy it in small quantities the person that
[1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:01.120]  doesn't have a whole lot of money you know I bought I bought dimes and half
[1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:05.560]  dollars they're gorgeous little coins and 999 silver folks give them a call
[1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:12.360]  800 686 2237 800 686 2237 but to be clear you're saying you've just got
[1:13:12.360 --> 1:13:15.840]  Frank's at the old level are you saying you're out of sovereigns no I'm not out
[1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:18.720]  of them yet I've got a small supply left but I'm telling you what it's like
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:24.800]  trying to buy it right now 800 686 2237 and that deal will hold till midnight
[1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:28.120]  central standard yeah we'll hold it right through the night tonight all right
[1:13:28.120 --> 1:13:33.480]  thank you Tim absolutely folks we're just so blessed to be in this position
[1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:38.120]  as the owner of this network we want to be a major gold and silver broker and to
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:41.800]  be internationally known and to be one of the few guys he can that can even get
[1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:45.560]  them and then he's selling it lower than anybody else I've ever heard of believe
[1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:50.520]  me I've looked around 800 686 2237 all right for the rest of the hour we're
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:55.680]  joined by dr. Stan Monty 40 plus years in the fight against the new world order
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:14:01.560]  syndicated broadcaster he is also talk show host right here on the GCN radio
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:06.040]  network and I wanted to get him on about all the Barack Obama's betrayals and
[1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:10.920]  his lies and the and and the fact that the media is getting behind Barack
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:16.320]  Obama like he is God himself putting all their power behind him how dangerous is
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:20.440]  this historically when governments and elites and media get behind somebody and
[1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:24.480]  try to build them up as a messianic savior complexion with all of his
[1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:28.960]  decades of experience and research is also an author and filmmaker where he
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:33.280]  sees this going dr. Stan Monty great to have you here with us well it's good to
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:38.600]  be with you again Alex and we are really in trouble here in the United States and
[1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:43.120]  most people will find it very difficult to believe that the government or I
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:47.680]  should say the invisible government is actually has actually precipitated this
[1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:52.760]  whole financial crisis and wants to use it to impoverish our people and destroy
[1:14:52.760 --> 1:14:56.760]  the infrastructure our nation and then of course as you well know we're just
[1:14:56.760 --> 1:15:00.200]  into the world government but the question is how did they do it and
[1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:04.000]  course nobody's telling the American people are the techniques that they
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:08.320]  used it's really incredible as you go back and study it and and they knew
[1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:12.160]  exactly what they were doing and there's only if you go in the trial after
[1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:17.000]  commission only seven eighty seven of Americans American citizens in the
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.160]  northern a group of the trial after Commission and yet right now there are
[1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:26.720]  eleven of them in key positions with in president Obama's regime and they are
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:31.120]  the people who are advising him on finance on foreign policy and the
[1:15:31.120 --> 1:15:35.480]  military in fact the chief of intelligence of the whole country comes
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:39.560]  from the trial after commission at the Blair of the national security advisor
[1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:43.560]  James Jones general Jones comes from the trial after commission the deputy
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:48.200]  national security advisor Thomas Donald and comes from the from the trial after
[1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:53.120]  commission of the Susan Rice the ambassador of the United Nations comes
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:57.280]  from the trial after commission I knew Secretary of the Treasury who is so
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:01.640]  smart he forgot to pay his income tax but he's part of this elite group he
[1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:05.920]  comes from the trial after commission as well as of course all the other parts
[1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:09.360]  of what I call the brotherhood of darkness the change we're going to get
[1:16:09.360 --> 1:16:14.440]  is a change for the worst Obama president Obama promised us change but
[1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:18.600]  of course he is going to lead to the destruction of this nation and the
[1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:22.560]  impoverishment of our people and they're going to destroy our currency and
[1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:27.120]  there's no better way to destroy a nation than to destroy the currency
[1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:32.400]  breakdown that the financial situation we're facing they've done this over and
[1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:35.960]  over again the Federal Reserve and the private banks before they fully took
[1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:40.160]  over organized on record it's mainline history congressional testimony
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:44.040]  organized a bunch of runs on banks and crises and then promised the Federal
[1:16:44.040 --> 1:16:47.600]  Reserve would fix it all and then even use their papers to advertise that the
[1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:51.280]  banks were against the Federal Reserve Act to trick people into going along
[1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:54.760]  with it when they were actually the authors of it from the Jekyll Island
[1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:59.880]  meeting and the parallels with what's happening today I mean what's it like
[1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:04.960]  for you Dr. Stan Montee to actually see the Wall Street Journal market watch the
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:09.320]  Financial Times of London Newsweek hundreds of publications say we have the
[1:17:09.320 --> 1:17:13.120]  answer it's a brand new idea we just got it's called a new world order word for
[1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:16.880]  word it's going to be a private group of banks owning and running the world and
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:22.000]  they will control all industry and you will pay a carbon tax to them and they
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:26.880]  will tell you what to do and we'll have a North American Union with an SPP and
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:33.120]  a marrow I mean there with headlines like a North American Union will fix the
[1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:36.560]  problems a new currency will fix the problems and now for world government
[1:17:36.560 --> 1:17:41.440]  so so a what's happening in your expert analysis with the economy right now with
[1:17:41.440 --> 1:17:45.800]  their attack program and then be why are they now emerging and announcing
[1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:49.640]  everything we've warned people about for decades what does it mean that they're
[1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:54.240]  now going public well I think that they feel that the American people their
[1:17:54.240 --> 1:17:58.320]  minds are so controlled they really will not be able to connect the dots but
[1:17:58.320 --> 1:18:03.280]  your job and my job is to help them connect the dots their ultimate goal is
[1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:08.920]  a one-world government a one-world economic system with one-world currency
[1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:14.120]  but what everybody has missed is the one-world religion and this is really
[1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:17.800]  what it's all about because there are powerful spirits of forces that work
[1:18:17.800 --> 1:18:23.680]  behind this whole movement for one-world government it is not simply by accident
[1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:27.880]  that the logo of the trilateral Commission and any of your listeners can
[1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:32.720]  see it go up to trilateral.org but their logo well if you look at it they're
[1:18:32.720 --> 1:18:38.680]  three curved arrows and you can almost imagine that there's sixes like 666
[1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:43.760]  but there's no way you can miss in the very center of the logo is an upside
[1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:48.680]  down broken cross the emblem of the hatred of Christianity the trilateral
[1:18:48.680 --> 1:18:53.520]  Commission which was organized back in the 1979 at least according to Senator
[1:18:53.520 --> 1:18:59.880]  Bo Goldberry Goldwater in his book with no apologies on page 280 he said the
[1:18:59.880 --> 1:19:05.240]  trilateral Commission was was established to gain financial and
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:10.840]  commercial control and then of course by first taking over the political
[1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:16.320]  government of the United States now they were organized in 1973 Jimmy Carter
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:22.680]  was one of the first members Jimmy Carter became president in 1976 they put
[1:19:22.680 --> 1:19:27.480]  him in power because they control the media they control Time magazine Newsweek
[1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:32.280]  magazine and US News and Road Report they control the conservative media they
[1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:36.640]  control the liberal media and that's how you control a country and of course Jimmy
[1:19:36.640 --> 1:19:41.880]  Carter there were only 50 members of the northern northern American chapter of
[1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:46.720]  the trilateral Commission at that time and 19 of them were controlled the
[1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:49.080]  Carter administration stay there we've got a break
[1:19:49.080 --> 1:19:53.000]  to understand Montee's our guest what's on the Obama agenda what will the
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:56.920]  globalist front man do next you'll hear it from a man who's been studying them
[1:19:56.920 --> 1:20:04.240]  for close to 50 years when times get tough we must all decide what's most
[1:20:04.240 --> 1:20:09.080]  important in life at enduring rose calm we believe that lasting relationships are
[1:20:09.080 --> 1:20:12.920]  what make life most meaningful showing our loved ones that we care is what

[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:41.280]  article just up seconds ago at prisonplanet.com that I got him to do this
[1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:45.240]  morning dovetails with Al Gore going around telling kids I've done their
[1:24:45.240 --> 1:24:50.440]  parents are and that they will rule the future that's coming up democracy don't
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:59.240]  rule the world you better get that through your head
[1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:10.560]  but I guess it goes on said let's go ahead and go back to Dr. Stan Monteef
[1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:15.200]  Dr. Monteef short save will come back in a longer one to get into more detail
[1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:20.920]  but Barack Obama I mean this really is a packaged corporate 2.0 new older
[1:25:20.920 --> 1:25:26.240]  minion isn't he absolutely he you know one of the things we're trying to do is
[1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:31.360]  confuses they want us to focus our attention on his Marxist background his
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:35.200]  association with communist revolutionaries and terrorists you know
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:40.760]  William Aresden Bernadine Torren but the real thing is that he was put in power
[1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:47.000]  by the same people who put in all of our other presidents just 1976 every
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:51.480]  president and or vice president of the United States up until the present
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:55.640]  regime has come from the membership rule for the trial after commission you
[1:25:55.640 --> 1:25:59.600]  could not have that happen by accident I mean eight of our last 10 sex
[1:25:59.600 --> 1:26:03.520]  theories of state came from that organization it'll probably 10 of our
[1:26:03.520 --> 1:26:07.080]  last or eight of our last 12 secretary's defense came from the same
[1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:12.760]  organization I mean the six of our eight last world bank presidents came from
[1:26:12.760 --> 1:26:17.120]  that last organization there are only 87 members at the present time and how
[1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:20.600]  could you possibly have them in key positions of power because they've
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:24.840]  taken over our government we have to government we have a visible government
[1:26:24.840 --> 1:26:28.040]  and we have our legislators and our congressmen they get up and give
[1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:33.360]  speeches they pass laws but the elite doesn't obey the laws we saw that with
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:38.200]  us there's the Thomas Dashel part of the CFR and I think he's a trial out of
[1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:42.400]  commission member but I know he's a CFR member he just didn't bother to pay a
[1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:48.240]  hundred thousand dollars an income tax a Geithner Secretary of the Treasury he
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:53.040]  it was Turbo tax they were the ones who responsible he didn't pay his taxes
[1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:57.520]  these people don't abide by our laws these people create wars and
[1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:01.840]  revolutions and they kill people and they certainly work in close proximity
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:06.240]  with the CIA which is their arm of the that they go out in a higher
[1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:10.320]  professional assassination they kill world leaders they install people in
[1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:14.520]  positions of power and the invisible government doesn't abide by our laws
[1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:20.360]  because now but now it's not invisible the why are they turning off their
[1:27:20.360 --> 1:27:27.040]  cloaking device well they have so much they really control the minds of the
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:31.400]  people of this country I mean all the times how frequently people will call
[1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:35.720]  in and say you know I'm trying to tell people what's going on and they don't
[1:27:35.720 --> 1:27:40.680]  want to hear it or they say oh we're just a conspiracy coop I mean anybody
[1:27:40.680 --> 1:27:44.720]  who's read the article that Henry Kissinger wrote for the International
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:49.800]  Herald Tribune on the 12th of January and if you haven't got it you get it you
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:54.360]  Google it you know on the internet I'll just international Herald Tribune
[1:27:54.360 --> 1:27:59.120]  Henry Kissinger 12th of January new international order will come out and
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:06.560]  the title of it is the the chance for a new world order and then it goes on the
[1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:10.920]  first sentence the first paragraph is to talk about how what's going on is an
[1:28:10.920 --> 1:28:16.280]  opportunity to bring in this new international order they are so convinced
[1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:20.720]  it's going to happen that they have just thrown all caution to the wind and
[1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:24.520]  they're telling us exactly what they intend and they're going to tell us
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:28.840]  there is no alternative I mean you're either going to have the destruction of
[1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:33.400]  our economic system you're going to lose everything you have or you and the rest
[1:28:33.400 --> 1:28:37.400]  of the world are going to go along with it well there is another alternative is
[1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:41.680]  not to expose them and of course to take away the control of our monetary
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:47.160]  system before they destroy the value of our currency do you realize they've
[1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:52.120]  doubled the monetary base in the last three months do you know why it's
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:28:55.800]  hard to get a loan today and I'll tell you why and that and nobody is telling
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:29:00.920]  the American people these things number one certainly on the 3rd of October of
[1:29:00.920 --> 1:29:05.040]  last year the very day when Henry Paulson got his is the greedy little
[1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:09.920]  fingers on the 700 billion dollars he had promised to use to buy up the of the
[1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:14.040]  mortgages so we could stop the foreclosures and then refuse to do it
[1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:18.280]  because he didn't want to stop this crisis that very same day the Federal
[1:29:18.280 --> 1:29:23.600]  Reserve system began paying interest on reserve deposits now to most stay there

[1:33:30.840 --> 1:33:38.520]  at present planet dot tv where the radio show becomes visual going back to
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:43.800]  dr. Stan Montee continuing sir a start over with that last minute where you
[1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:47.040]  explain what they did october 3rd the bait and switch and then what the
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:52.960]  Federal Reserve started doing the day after that as well and I mean break down
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:57.400]  assembly for folks as you can a nutshell studying this monetary situation what
[1:33:57.400 --> 1:34:01.240]  they're doing well of course what they've done is made it so complex that the
[1:34:01.240 --> 1:34:05.200]  average individual can't figure it out but me took me a long time to figure this
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:10.600]  out but basically what they did was on the 3rd of october of last year the
[1:34:10.600 --> 1:34:16.240]  Federal Reserve began paying interest on bank reserves the deposit with them now
[1:34:16.240 --> 1:34:20.880]  most people don't understand the fraction of reserve banking system but a bank
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:26.280]  has to keep say a 10% reserve a fraction of what they're gonna loan out they can
[1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:30.960]  loan out I say a thousand dollars but they've got to keep a reserve of ten
[1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:35.520]  dollars and they deposit that with the Federal Reserve system the Federal
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:39.240]  Reserve doesn't pay any interest on it it holds it but then they can lend out
[1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:44.640]  and ninety dollars that with nothing behind it other than that 10% the fraction
[1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:50.200]  is deposited with the Federal Reserve which is the system foundation of our
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:55.840]  monetary system but on october the 3rd the Federal Reserve began paying the
[1:34:55.840 --> 1:35:00.120]  banks interest on the money that they posited with them that never done it
[1:35:00.120 --> 1:35:04.200]  before well there's a lot of uncertainty out there and the smaller banks mean
[1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:09.040]  can we if we lend our money will we get it back but now we don't have to just
[1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:13.040]  keep it sitting at our coffers why we can lend it to the Federal Reserve and
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:17.840]  they'll pay its interest and so that's what happened and instead of having eight
[1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:22.400]  billion dollars on deposit with the Federal Reserve which was had been
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:27.400]  accustomed that now there's suddenly over a half a trillion dollars and what
[1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:31.800]  the Federal Reserve did all the time they're talking about how we want to get
[1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:36.680]  the monetary system working and get the banks loaning again was actually to
[1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:41.120]  absorb all of the money that was out there for loans interest banks had a
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:44.760]  little money to loan but most of it was in the hands of the Federal Reserve now
[1:35:44.760 --> 1:35:50.440]  if they really want to encourage banks to to loan that stop paying interest or
[1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:53.880]  they would charge them for the money that they have there and then the banks
[1:35:53.880 --> 1:35:57.600]  would loan money you see they tell us they want to solve the problem they
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:01.800]  don't want to solve the problem they want this problem to get worse the major
[1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:08.000]  banks and I'm talking about it ZP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs the people who
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:11.920]  had those banks had just happened to belong to the Trial Outer Commission so
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:16.360]  what they've done is yes they have money to lend but of course they'll lend it
[1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:22.000]  to 10 12 15 to 20 percent Southwest Airlines what is one of the best run
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:27.600]  airlines of this country recently had to borrow money 300 million dollars ten
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:32.200]  point five percent interest mean it's pretty hard to make a profit when you
[1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:36.400]  pay that amount of interest the other large airline companies that have to
[1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:41.560]  borrow money are going to be paying 15 or 20 percent interest okay stop right
[1:36:41.560 --> 1:36:45.800]  there but let's let's explain this very simply because what you said is
[1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:50.360]  absolutely on target they tell us that we need to be globalized they have tax
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:54.200]  incentives for companies to move offshore they destroy the real main street
[1:36:54.200 --> 1:36:58.440]  economy so they were fully dependent on the fiat fractional reserve banking
[1:36:58.440 --> 1:37:04.520]  system then from that point they get everybody leverage in a deep debt then
[1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:09.240]  they come out and have the president and world leaders and prime ministers and
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:12.600]  the head of the treasury and the head of the private Federal Reserve come out
[1:37:12.600 --> 1:37:17.080]  and say we're gonna have a depression to destroy confidence while they were
[1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:20.680]  setting this up they said everything was fine as we pointed out it was a set up
[1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:24.720]  for decades they said oh no that's a conspiracy theory everything's fine then
[1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:28.520]  they implode confidence they get the Congress to pass a law that really wasn't
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:32.440]  a bailout but that gave them dictatorial power where Congress or any court or
[1:37:32.440 --> 1:37:37.720]  agency couldn't review them they then set up rules where real banks or main
[1:37:37.720 --> 1:37:42.960]  street banks can't invest their tiny fraction of real capital with them and
[1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:47.480]  it's the only place they can get a guaranteed investment so everything
[1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:54.040]  floods into the Federal Reserve killing what a little bit of cash was actually
[1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:58.840]  out there too long deepening the recession going into depression then they
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:02.280]  come out with phase two saying we've got to have this big global bank that'll
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:07.120]  take over industry that'll cap salaries that'll control everything to quote get
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:11.000]  the big bad bankers but they have loopholes for themselves they wrote the
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:14.880]  thing and designed to begin with so they're imploding the world economy so
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:18.600]  they can suck it all up in this cash-starved environment because they're
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:22.360]  the only ones that have money you're absolutely right and what we are
[1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:26.520]  witnessing today is the gayest greatest transfer of wealth that has ever
[1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:31.640]  occurred we hear a lot about how we're going to put a new a new bill a new
[1:38:31.640 --> 1:38:35.200]  bailout bill Obama says you don't give me the money you're gonna be
[1:38:35.200 --> 1:38:39.960]  responsible for the catastrophe well if anybody has really studied what's
[1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:47.560]  gone on during the last year year 2008 they put out almost eight trillion
[1:38:47.560 --> 1:38:52.640]  dollars eight trillion dollars up to support and really transferring the
[1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:58.640]  money to the international financiers in fact Ben Bernanke has given two
[1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:02.960]  trillion dollars away and he won't even tell Bloomberg he won't tell Congress he
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:08.000]  won't tell anybody where that money is gone he says it's a trade secret so like
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:12.320]  when a man off you know was asked if somebody could audit his his corporation
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:17.040]  the Ponzi scheme and he said no that's a trade secret risk of we can't let people
[1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:21.720]  do but we're talking about two trip trillion dollars with Bernanke let's
[1:39:21.720 --> 1:39:26.680]  stop there let's stop there was a piker well let's stop there I mean let's stop
[1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:31.880]  there's only your take on this Bloomberg filed suit two weeks after the bailout
[1:39:31.880 --> 1:39:38.080]  so so we're now six seven eight weeks or more out from that it was two plus
[1:39:38.080 --> 1:39:44.360]  trillion then the last number we got which was four weeks after that was eight
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:49.840]  point five trillion so that's the total amount is basically that that is the
[1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:55.160]  total amount that they they pledged or given or lent as of last year but see
[1:39:55.160 --> 1:39:59.560]  well if eight point five trillion wouldn't solve the problem why would we
[1:39:59.560 --> 1:40:03.720]  think that another nine hundred million some of us going to you know for
[1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:07.680]  healthcare for children and some of us going to prevent sexually transmitted
[1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:12.800]  disease and some of us four point two billion are going to go to acorn and
[1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:17.840]  other local community organizations you know that can agitate to change the laws
[1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:23.960]  and the FEMA camps and the FEMA camps why would we none of this is really
[1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:28.160]  going to be maybe 50 a billion of the money is going to go for infrastructure
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:31.360]  development to create jobs but most of those jobs are not going to be around
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:39.320]  until 2010 or 2011 this is all part of the program to destroy our currency why
[1:40:39.320 --> 1:40:43.040]  because where does the money come from well they're not going to tax the people
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:47.640]  they're cutting taxes so they're going to have to borrow the money where is the
[1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:51.080]  good money coming from well since foreigners are not going to continue
[1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:55.120]  funding this they're going to have to create some money and what they have
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:41:00.080]  done is the Federal Reserve has started creating money they've doubled the
[1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:03.680]  monetary base within the last four months but they haven't told the
[1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:08.080]  American people that which means that the value of the currency that you hold
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:12.960]  has really gone down 50% during that period of time but the inflation has
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:18.200]  become apparent however it's going to and if you read Alan Greenspan's book the
[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:21.880]  AIDS of Turbulence which is an excellent source of information Alan
[1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:25.200]  Greenspan is a member of the Trilogy Commission was a member of the
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:29.440]  Bilderbergers was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations regularly
[1:41:29.440 --> 1:41:33.720]  socialized according to the book with David Rockefeller when Henry Kissinger
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:39.040]  David Rockefeller organized the Trilogy Commission the honorary chairman of the
[1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:44.400]  Council on Foreign Relations was the vice chairman for 15 years was the
[1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:48.640]  chairman for 15 years and now he's the honorary chairman he runs that
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:53.320]  organization he always has he's always financed it he's a permanent member of
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:56.800]  the Bilderbergers he is the leading internationalist and here's Alan
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:01.000]  Greenspan you know going going right along with them socializing with him
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:05.960]  and Henry Kissinger who also has the same pedigree but Alan Greenspan in that
[1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:11.000]  book will tell you that the best way to destroy a nation is to debauch the
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:16.120]  currency and not one person in a million will understand what's happening
[1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:20.320]  those are his words not mine and that's what they're going to do if you
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:24.160]  destroy the value of our currency you destroy the value of the pension funds
[1:42:24.160 --> 1:42:30.600]  of the savings the annuities insurance policies you just impoverish our people
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:35.800]  and impoverish people they believe are going to go along with their plan for
[1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:39.160]  the one world government and give up their freedom and that's why they've
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:43.240]  got the concentration camps there they've had them for a long period of
[1:42:43.240 --> 1:42:49.680]  time as you know they maybe they gave haliburton back in 2006 that will kill
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:54.240]  a brown and rooted subdivision of Dick Cheney's haliburton 300 and I think it
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:43:00.160]  was 85 million dollars to be prepared and or to start actually building
[1:43:00.160 --> 1:43:03.960]  detention camps and people thought that it would all in when Obama came in but
[1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:09.000]  instead they're radically expanding it and now openly announcing it and they're
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:13.320]  announcing a new civilian domestic military they're setting up obama's
[1:43:13.320 --> 1:43:19.680]  private population squads running national PSA's to join USA servants
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:23.920]  org which is a group under him they're talking about compulsory service 18 to
[1:43:23.920 --> 1:43:28.360]  24 I mean they're making their move they really are but I think what's so
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:33.240]  important is for the American people to understand this was all planned I mean
[1:43:33.240 --> 1:43:37.200]  Henry Paulson had 700 million dollars you get a stuff billion dollars you could
[1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:41.600]  stop the whole thing started buying up the the bonds these collateralized
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:47.120]  debt obligations made up of insolvent mortgages he absolutely refused to do
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:52.040]  it in fact he couldn't even give away the full 700 billion dollars he could
[1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:57.680]  only give away 350 billion of it they left 350 billion for for you know for
[1:43:57.680 --> 1:44:02.360]  Obama but why didn't he do what was necessary because they don't want to
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:07.120]  stop the problem they do not want to stop the economic collapse it took him
[1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:12.600]  a long time to create it but one of the best stories that nobody's ever told is
[1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:16.320]  the story of Elliot Spitzer and of course everybody remembers when he was
[1:44:16.320 --> 1:44:22.240]  humiliated in March of last year but they don't know what led up to the FBI
[1:44:22.240 --> 1:44:28.000]  story about his cavorting with a high-paid prostitute it was on the 18th of
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  February last year when Elliot Spitzer wrote an article that appeared in the
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:37.680]  in the Washington Post and basically the article said that that all 50 state
[1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:42.080]  attorney general the state of general to attorney generals of every state in the
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:47.800]  Union recognized the danger of the predatory lending practices the in the
[1:44:47.800 --> 1:44:52.000]  insolvent leditoring practices were being carried out to encourage people to
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:56.640]  buy homes that they couldn't afford and the the attorney generals knew this was
[1:44:56.640 --> 1:45:02.440]  going to lead to the destruction of our financial system so all of the 50 state
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:07.560]  attorney generals wanted actually to take action to stop the predatory
[1:45:07.560 --> 1:45:12.120]  lending practices to prevent the destruction of our monetary system but
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:16.800]  the Bush administration intervened and blocked them so that article was written
[1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:22.140]  and published in the Washington that primary in the Washington Post on the
[1:45:22.140 --> 1:45:30.560]  18th of February three weeks later on the on the 11th of March the FBI leaks a
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:36.600]  story the story is that they found out that you know Elliot Spitzer is involved
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:42.240]  with a terrible federal crime he's paying a high-paid prostitute for her
[1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:47.960]  services now why is the FBI investing prostitution if the prostitution is not
[1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:53.240]  a federal crime why did they leak the story on Elliot Spitzer why so that
[1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:57.320]  nobody would dare tell the American people what Elliot Spitzer did and that
[1:45:57.320 --> 1:46:00.640]  is that the government knew what was coming down the line and they let it
[1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:04.760]  happen Alan Greenspan knew it was going coming down the line he was warned by
[1:46:04.760 --> 1:46:09.480]  Ed Gramlich who is a member of the of the board of board of governors of the of
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:12.680]  the Federal Reserve well they only put out little warnings to cover their own
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:16.520]  butts but but let me explain to people how we know what you're saying is right a
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:21.640]  few examples of hundreds I could give the very same international banking
[1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:27.400]  cartel over and over and over again has engineered the same exact operations in
[1:46:27.400 --> 1:46:31.200]  third world nations and the goal is to get them a deep in debt with fiat
[1:46:31.200 --> 1:46:37.360]  currency the bankers pull out of their hat implode the nation and then come in
[1:46:37.360 --> 1:46:41.160]  and take over the full infrastructure and then set up for the IMF World Bank
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:45.800]  rules over their industry their country force the nation to sign treaties to wave
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:50.960]  what's left of their sovereignty another example of them doing this by design
[1:46:50.960 --> 1:46:54.680]  because this is what they do it's like the scorpions on the back of the frog
[1:46:54.680 --> 1:46:57.960]  and says give me a ride across the river and he says but you'll sting me he says
[1:46:57.960 --> 1:47:01.880]  no I won't and when the frog gets him to the other end of the river he stings
[1:47:01.880 --> 1:47:04.800]  him and the frogs dying in the water and he says why'd you sting me I helped you
[1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:11.760]  and he said I'm a scorpion that's the wonderful story because that's what
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:16.320]  scorpions do they sting people but exactly but it's the same thing they
[1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:19.960]  lied over the last few decades in the last two three years ago we were telling
[1:47:19.960 --> 1:47:23.040]  people four years ago we were telling people hey they're gonna implode the
[1:47:23.040 --> 1:47:26.440]  subprime mortgage by design they're gonna announce a new world government
[1:47:26.440 --> 1:47:30.280]  bank they're gonna quote have a bailout and suck us all dry in my film in game
[1:47:30.280 --> 1:47:35.400]  covers this in game 1.5 expands on it on record I mean we're there outside
[1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:42.000]  boulderberg saying this is what inside sources told us and after all of this
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.960]  happens then suddenly with the bailouts they all come out and have their
[1:47:44.960 --> 1:47:48.200]  newspapers say we're going into depression we're going into depression to
[1:47:48.200 --> 1:47:52.600]  destroy confidence and to make people hold on to their money to make lending
[1:47:52.600 --> 1:47:56.720]  and commerce stops so they always lie when they're setting it up then they
[1:47:56.720 --> 1:48:00.880]  always create fear and blow the horn of fear like they did in 29 when they're
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:05.000]  ready to consolidate so they've set this trap for a long long time but we have
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:08.720]  Daniel Estolin who had sources inside boulderberg and Jim Tucker on tape an
[1:48:08.720 --> 1:48:14.040]  in-game and an in-game 1.5 expanded extras and he's you know I'm there in
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:17.000]  the restaurant at the other hotel after we cover boulderberg and he just talked
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:21.600]  to his sources meeting with him secretly in the town these are by the way
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:25.680]  intelligence agents inside and he knows they're good because the info is always
[1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:31.160]  proven accurate and I say okay Daniel we played the clip here what's happening
[1:48:31.160 --> 1:48:35.240]  he said okay they want to sucker everybody back into the stock market so
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:41.600]  they're going to run gas up from $60 a barrel like it is right now to 150 and
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:46.080]  then they're going to implode the subprime mortgages by design if they
[1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:49.040]  want everybody to go bankrupt and then prices are going to fall and then it's
[1:48:49.040 --> 1:48:53.560]  all going to explode again every word-for-word happened this was three
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:59.840]  years ago the price boiled down in from 147 on July 11th the last year to
[1:48:59.840 --> 1:49:04.360]  where it is today and this was all done because they control the markets they
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:08.600]  rigged the markets they manipulate the stock market but they control the media
[1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:13.120]  and you pick up the Wall Street Journal and article after article after article
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:18.400]  doom gloom terrible I mean things could be good if you read the article but the
[1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:21.680]  headline is going to catch your attention and things are going from bad
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:26.800]  to worse and the thing is it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy a half a million
[1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:31.360]  people are losing their jobs every month they lost them you know in November
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:35.480]  they lost them in December they lost them in January you know and it'll be the
[1:49:35.480 --> 1:49:39.920]  same thing or worse this month let me just add a caveat and then come back
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:42.880]  and the time we have left cover other issues or with a doctor Stan Montee if
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:47.000]  it's this people are saying well Alex why are you being gloom and doom well
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:51.280]  understand I'm not the engineer of all of this I'm not standing back and saying
[1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:55.360]  all this is happening because we were greedy and we were bad and and and
[1:49:55.360 --> 1:49:58.120]  people got loans they shouldn't have you know they're suckers they're certainly
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:02.800]  part of it we're here observing the real train of history the MO of these people
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:06.200]  their own documents what they do and so we're telling you it's going to get
[1:50:06.200 --> 1:50:09.200]  really bad because they're going to show us no mercy because they want to bring
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:12.640]  in a total depression so they can consolidate power and bring in even more
[1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:16.920]  control and then make you be beholden and and and domesticated and
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:21.280]  institutionalized in their system we're saying it could be stopped but their
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:26.680]  solutions will only exacerbate it because it's designed to dr. Monteef
[1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:31.480]  I think this this whole thing everything they're doing is bad they're
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:36.720]  saying well this came about because we didn't have enough regulation no the
[1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:41.440]  laws were there they absolutely refused to enforce the law selectively enforced
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:47.000]  selectively and they selectively agreed to this whole thing of people I don't
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:50.920]  even talk about the derivative a time bomb that's out there stay there let's

[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:43.160]  were getting into the derivatives again to explain this the big central banks
[1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:48.360]  and their allied crime syndicate the brokerage firms they come out they
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:54.520]  package debt that again is fiat only taxpayers backing it up with the
[1:54:54.520 --> 1:54:58.800]  nationalization that's really privatization in the final equation for
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:03.480]  them and they sell them all the world and while it still is is while the Ponzi
[1:55:03.480 --> 1:55:07.120]  schemes working they buy up all the real assets around the planet buy off more
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:11.200]  governments buy off more the defense contractors media vertically integrate
[1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:17.880]  the economy and then they leave us holding the bag please continue what
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:21.400]  we're seeing is the greatest transfer of wealth and all recorded history and most
[1:55:21.400 --> 1:55:26.800]  people have no idea what's happened and it's all designed to destroy our economy
[1:55:26.800 --> 1:55:30.200]  and to this and to impoverish our people but the derivative is a really
[1:55:30.200 --> 1:55:36.400]  incredible they they're basically insurance policies on performance that
[1:55:36.400 --> 1:55:39.800]  without any reserves behind them in other words would you buy an insurance
[1:55:39.800 --> 1:55:44.600]  policy a fire insurance policy if the insurance company didn't have any money
[1:55:44.600 --> 1:55:49.280]  would you buy automobile insurance to protect you in case of an accident if
[1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:53.840]  the insurance company didn't have any money of funds behind it but that's what
[1:55:53.840 --> 1:55:59.520]  the derivatives were they were insurance policies on bonds and other investment
[1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:04.520]  vehicles saying well if this bond should default and you should not be getting
[1:56:04.520 --> 1:56:08.920]  your money back then we'll cover it you got nothing to worry about so they made
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:13.320]  you know hundreds of billions of dollars selling these derivatives there are
[1:56:13.320 --> 1:56:20.120]  derivatives out there that are valued somewhere between 700 trillion and a
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:25.840]  quadrillion dollars we don't know but the figure that I read does 600 trillion
[1:56:25.840 --> 1:56:32.440]  700 trillion a quadrillion dollars of derivatives out there and you and I are
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:35.680]  going to be responsible for those because we have already said we're going to
[1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:40.200]  back up you know with JP Morgan if they get into trouble we're already taken on
[1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:47.880]  a 350 billion dollars responsibility for city group probably over you know well
[1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:51.760]  over a trillion dollars on AIG because they have written all these derivative
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:56.200]  contracts when these all come down they're all going to come down on on the
[1:56:56.200 --> 1:56:59.560]  backs of the American taxpayers because they tell us for these companies are
[1:56:59.560 --> 1:57:03.480]  just too big to fall ladies and gentlemen we got to let them fall we've
[1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:09.240]  got to stop this foolishness we've got to expose the financial people that are
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:15.000]  destroying the value of our currency but we also have to explore the spirits of
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:18.720]  forces which energize this whole thing and if I could put a plug in for my
[1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:23.760]  book brotherhood of darkness and for our website radio liberty comm on
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:29.720]  November and December 2008 newsletters tell you exactly how they pulled off this
[1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:35.320]  whole financial scam and what we need is every one of your listeners to get the
[1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:40.000]  information out that the people are going to lose everything they have when
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:44.200]  they destroy our currency it's not happening by accident by intent and the
[1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:48.480]  derivative bomb is the ultimate bomb it's going to come cascading down in the
[1:57:48.480 --> 1:57:53.080]  next couple of years and the destruction that it brings will create a crisis that
[1:57:53.080 --> 1:57:56.320]  they will build their new order on on their own words so give the way the
[1:57:56.320 --> 1:58:02.440]  websites radio liberty radio liberty comm that www dot radio liberty dot com

[1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:26.600]  planet right now only by exposing them and we then have any chance of rallying
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:29.680]  the people who arrest these criminals that's why they have north com standing
[1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:33.120]  by to stop the people from ever bringing the crime syndicate of justice

[2:00:45.080 --> 2:00:51.400]  parents climate beliefs as we questioned segregation so see now if you're not for
[2:00:51.400 --> 2:00:55.320]  accepting global taxes and that there's global warming and that the seasons are
[2:00:55.320 --> 2:00:59.080]  unnatural and it's not supposed to get hotter and colder and that you are a
[2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:03.960]  Holocaust denier you don't like black people you're against civil rights and
[2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:08.320]  before I get to this look at this New York Times story pint-sized eco police
[2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:13.160]  making parents proud and sometimes crazy and public and private school all over
[2:01:13.160 --> 2:01:18.280]  the nation the majority of them I've seen Time magazine for kids saying let's
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:21.280]  give it on the public schools oh your parents are backwards and dumb they don't
[2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:25.920]  know how great it is to get an implantable chip the Nazis the Soviets
[2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:29.200]  they always come and tell the children you're the boss of your parents report
[2:01:29.200 --> 2:01:33.400]  on them and all over the country they have BATF grants to local police to have
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:37.320]  officers in the middle schools writing dossiers on their parents I covered my
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:41.200]  film police state to the takeover I mean this is happening and you read this
[2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:45.160]  article sometimes Jennifer Ross feels she cannot make a move at home without
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:48.360]  inviting the scorn of her daughter's 10 year old grace and seven year old
[2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:52.200]  Alyssa and it shows the daughters bossing her on the photo looking at her
[2:01:52.200 --> 2:01:58.760]  like this and she's yes master the accurate MDX she drives a flagrant
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:04.400]  polluter the bath at night to help her relax a wasteful indulgence the
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:09.720]  reusable shopping bag she forgot again TISC TISC I am very very very
[2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:13.200]  environmentally conscious children more so than me and I'm embarrassed to say
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:16.840]  said miss Ross the social worker in Dobson New York they are on my case
[2:02:16.840 --> 2:02:20.200]  about getting a hybrid car they want me to replace all the light bulbs in the
[2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:23.920]  house with energy-saving bulbs and then now that says they don't use the washer
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:27.560]  they've got clothes lines in the house and her kids are the boss because the
[2:02:27.560 --> 2:02:34.120]  state says so so the state is the boss this is right out of 1984 where you know
[2:02:34.120 --> 2:02:39.880]  the children are spies of the parents now here is the clip there's several of
[2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:44.040]  these one of them back listeners record this about gore to school and this is
[2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:48.720]  him telling the kids that basically their parents don't understand but they
[2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:54.200]  is 11 and 12 year olds in this middle school they do now again it isn't about
[2:02:54.200 --> 2:02:58.800]  the environment folks it's about control it's about bringing in global taxes to
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:02.200]  be paid to the new global central bank openly announces we told you for years
[2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:15.880]  now public we're right here it is
[2:03:32.200 --> 2:04:00.440]  yeah let's go to the next part of the clip
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:15.000]  and it goes on and on there's another clip we'll play later and I'm going to
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:19.040]  comment on this more but understand folks I just remembered this New York Times
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:22.520]  article today and pulled it up there are hundreds in Indian in England they're
[2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:27.360]  having a more climate cop uniforms black white and red climate cops with a patch
[2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:31.000]  on the shoulder and we've been to Obama rallies where they wear green uniforms
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:36.040]  with helmets and they're gonna come out and enforce all of this controlling
[2:04:36.040 --> 2:04:40.640]  every facet of your life taxing and regulating taxing farms ranches factories
[2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:45.360]  businesses they're gonna list carbon dioxide as a toxic waste that's what
[2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:50.200]  plants breathe I mean this is going on so you put your children in public school
[2:04:50.200 --> 2:04:53.800]  in most private schools the state is taking them away from you on these

[2:08:15.720 --> 2:08:20.560]  social economic developments things of that nature some people in this genre
[2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:24.960]  will turn to the media love the fear monger about asteroids hitting the
[2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:28.400]  earth and killing everybody or you know wiping out most of civilization they
[2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:32.240]  love to freak out about tsunamis and earthquakes and certainly that's a big
[2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:35.040]  problem you haven't been one of the areas affected by it hundreds of
[2:08:35.040 --> 2:08:40.800]  thousands of people every a few years get killed by a violent earth changes but
[2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:49.200]  you know that said when I get into the fact that the super volcano in Yellowstone
[2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:55.160]  Park that's the epicenter of it is a very very serious issue it's because I'm
[2:08:55.160 --> 2:08:59.800]  reading what the seismologist the volcanologist and other people that study
[2:08:59.800 --> 2:09:03.520]  this are saying and I remember first reading about this a decade ago with a
[2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:07.080]  lot of big universities and researchers saying this thing looks like it may be
[2:09:07.080 --> 2:09:10.040]  starting to get active again that's that's why you have the guys are just
[2:09:10.040 --> 2:09:15.040]  why you have the mud pits and if it ever erupted you know it could kill
[2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:17.920]  hundreds of thousands millions of people depending on which direction it
[2:09:17.920 --> 2:09:21.840]  explodes it could blast rock you know a third of the way across the country shoot
[2:09:21.840 --> 2:09:25.680]  dust in the atmosphere cooling the earth's temperature for years this is a
[2:09:25.680 --> 2:09:30.000]  super volcano not your little standard ones like a Mount St. Helens but instead
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:34.720]  of myself here coming on this we have a top volcanologist on he's the director
[2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:39.000]  of the International Volcanic Research Center based in Apache Junction Arizona
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:43.600]  and they have researchers that are members of the group worldwide and one
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:46.800]  of the reasons we have him on is that they've had hundreds of earthquakes
[2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:50.000]  there in the last year and in surrounding areas around Yellowstone it's
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:55.800]  rising in some areas falling in others the magma chamber we call the bathalift
[2:09:55.800 --> 2:10:00.160]  is getting bigger recent Yellowstone quake swarms second most intense on
[2:10:00.160 --> 2:10:04.680]  record that's AP Yellowstone quakes died down officials seek to ease super
[2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:10.320]  volcano fears they even had fake evacuation warnings and people panicking
[2:10:10.320 --> 2:10:16.960]  it says after 500 earthquakes on 400 so we've got a top volcanologist Dr. Robert
[2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:23.880]  B. Trombly on with us PhD to break down from his expert opinion and research
[2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:29.520]  exactly what is going on it's studying the volcano himself physically sir it's
[2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:32.560]  it's great to have you here with us well thank you very much for having on the
[2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:38.800]  show delighted to be here with you I was I was listening to you're talking about
[2:10:38.800 --> 2:10:44.280]  asteroids I was originally trained as an astronomer so I was very interested in
[2:10:44.280 --> 2:10:50.720]  that as well but at any rate first of all for starters a relative to Yellowstone
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:57.280]  or there should not be any panic or fear amongst the populace at the at the
[2:10:57.280 --> 2:11:05.160]  moment as of the 4th of February day before yesterday the University of
[2:11:05.160 --> 2:11:13.960]  Utah seismic stations reported that the activity from January 9th to the
[2:11:13.960 --> 2:11:22.320]  12th where we had a secondary swarm of 35 earthquake earthquakes occurred
[2:11:22.320 --> 2:11:28.600]  near the northeast edge of the Yellowstone caldera which is about 10
[2:11:28.600 --> 2:11:34.120]  miles north northeast of the north end of the Yellowstone Lake swarm and for
[2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:39.560]  those of you who do not know what a swarm is it's basically earthquakes that
[2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:46.960]  are closely spaced in time and area are termed swarms and are quite common mode
[2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:53.720]  of seismic energy release at the Yellowstone caldera from 1984 tonight to
[2:11:53.720 --> 2:12:02.880]  2008 there were 80 swarms documented at Yellowstone but at the moment there's
[2:12:02.880 --> 2:12:09.680]  actually this started on December 26th of 2008 the second largest earthquake
[2:12:09.680 --> 2:12:17.120]  swarm at Yellowstone occurred in its history it occurred beneath the north
[2:12:17.120 --> 2:12:24.680]  end of Yellowstone Lake and it has continued into January of 2009 but then
[2:12:24.680 --> 2:12:33.840]  subsided rather quickly in the activity on January 5th so the lake swarm actually
[2:12:33.840 --> 2:12:39.600]  in this case consisted of 813 well-located earthquakes with magnitudes
[2:12:39.600 --> 2:12:49.480]  ranging from 0.8 to 3.9 the sequence contained 19 earthquakes of greater
[2:12:49.480 --> 2:12:58.960]  than 3 magnitude 141 events greater than two but less than three and several of
[2:12:58.960 --> 2:13:03.240]  the greater than three swarm events were felt throughout the National Park and
[2:13:03.240 --> 2:13:09.080]  surrounding area now as I said that's quite a common occurrence at Yellowstone
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:17.560]  and has been for a long long time it last erupted 740,000 years ago I believe
[2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:21.360]  was that the lava creek eruption that ejected stuff all the way into the
[2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:31.200]  Pacific Ocean yes yeah and I believe it was 740,000 years ago right or it was
[2:13:31.200 --> 2:13:35.760]  610 I can't remember 630 is what the graphic says but go ahead 630 that's
[2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:41.040]  it that's it that's right so it's only erupted three times in its entire
[2:13:41.040 --> 2:13:45.760]  history but there is no as I said there's no real cause for alarm at the
[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:56.520]  moment in fact the earthquake activity has subsided quite a bit of late so but
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:14:03.160]  this is a common occurrence that occurs at Yellowstone now you also mentioned
[2:14:03.160 --> 2:14:09.840]  the the growing and that's called deformation ground deformation through
[2:14:09.840 --> 2:14:17.760]  January of this year the continuous ground positioning system data showed
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:22.920]  that much of the Yellowstone caldera continued moving upward although at a
[2:14:22.920 --> 2:14:31.320]  lower rate than the past several years the nearest GPS station to the swarm at
[2:14:31.320 --> 2:14:36.840]  a place called Lake Junction which is about two kilometers from the swarm has
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:43.560]  experienced the ground lift over the last 55 months of about approximately 18
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:49.040]  centimeters so it's really not too much okay let me ask you this because talking
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:57.720]  during the break is there any danger of it erupting and if it did erupt what
[2:14:57.720 --> 2:15:05.040]  would happen looking at the last eruptions okay first of all no there's no
[2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:12.280]  real danger of it erupting at the moment I my my norm my normal take on this is
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:16.480]  it would not probably be erupting for several hundred or even thousands of
[2:15:16.480 --> 2:15:22.960]  years from now the reason basically is because of all of the activity that's
[2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:30.400]  going on the swarming the geysers this is all part of an energy release and when
[2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:37.440]  you're releasing energy even though it's not major bits of energy it's still
[2:15:37.440 --> 2:15:42.960]  relieving the pressure so to speak on the volcano but enough in a scale of
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:47.240]  630,000 years from the last one you're saying in the next few decades next
[2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:51.120]  hundred years next thousand is it though you believe from the evidence entering
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:57.720]  into the cycle of eruption it could be but there's no real indication of that
[2:15:57.720 --> 2:16:03.840]  at the moment I mean it's not it's not acting up in the normal you had told me
[2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:07.800]  off-air I believe that you were saying 61% with the computers though that it
[2:16:07.800 --> 2:16:12.000]  will erupt but I guess you know that was read out read out okay out in Alaska
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:16.280]  oh yeah well let's talk about that one in a moment okay now now this is a
[2:16:16.280 --> 2:16:20.600]  super volcano correct correct can you tell us the difference between this and
[2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:27.360]  say the Mount Redoubt in in Alaska yes first of all the Yellowstone Caldera
[2:16:27.360 --> 2:16:34.040]  is about 32 miles long and about eight miles wide that's how big it is in
[2:16:34.040 --> 2:16:41.760]  reality we normally well let me put an input in the simplest terms as possible
[2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:48.280]  we have a in our business a scale called VEI which means volcano explosive
[2:16:48.280 --> 2:16:55.200]  index it runs on a scale of zero to eight zero being the lowest eight being
[2:16:55.200 --> 2:17:01.280]  the highest and it's a measure of the amount of ash and so forth outputting
[2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:08.600]  from the volcano now for starters it's it's logarithmic which means that as you
[2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:15.320]  go up on the scale and it it means it's ten times more material output from the
[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:22.720]  volcano than the previous one for example exponential yes VEI of two is ten
[2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:28.600]  times more material output than the VEI of one so it's like the record scale yes
[2:17:28.600 --> 2:17:34.080]  and and two yes very much like the Richter scale on a scale of ten that's
[2:17:34.080 --> 2:17:37.840]  right now just to give you some perspective Hawaii is a killer way of
[2:17:37.840 --> 2:17:44.840]  volcano which is right erupting right now is usually at a zero a one and
[2:17:44.840 --> 2:17:51.880]  occasionally a two it's a very fusive type lava Mount St. Helens that most
[2:17:51.880 --> 2:17:57.760]  people are familiar with that erupted in 1980 that was a five on our scale now
[2:17:57.760 --> 2:18:04.880]  there has never been in recorded history an eight eruption but the last one
[2:18:04.880 --> 2:18:12.720]  occurred 76,000 years ago in Tova in Samatra but that type of an eruption of
[2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:17.960]  a super volcano which is a VEI of eight and again there's never been one in
[2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:24.280]  recorded history per se that could cause if it went completely catastrophic it
[2:18:24.280 --> 2:18:31.320]  could cause us into another ice age so I would have global effects but again
[2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:37.880]  that's not even showing any signs whatsoever at Yellowstone at the moment
[2:18:37.880 --> 2:18:43.280]  okay but but on the scale then this would be thousands of times bigger
[2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:47.120]  eruption than what we see with lava just pouring out and covering some jungle
[2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:52.760]  some some some tropic forest in something like what's happening in Hawaii
[2:18:52.760 --> 2:18:58.200]  and can even compare to Mount St. Helen we're talking hundreds or thousands of
[2:18:58.200 --> 2:19:03.000]  times bigger well it'd be thousands times bigger if it were up to the
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:06.400]  catastrophically full scale and that means exploding from the pressure
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:11.880]  building up like St. Helens yes yes because St. Helen now now what are the
[2:19:11.880 --> 2:19:15.480]  three types of volcanoes because you have the the big explosive ones that
[2:19:15.480 --> 2:19:18.040]  shoot all the ash and rock those have a different name don't they the one that
[2:19:18.040 --> 2:19:23.520]  just oozes the the lava yeah we have basically three types of a volcano is
[2:19:23.520 --> 2:19:28.480]  up for the actually we have 14 but the three most common are straddle or
[2:19:28.480 --> 2:19:35.360]  composite volcanoes easier volcanoes like Mount St. Helen and so forth we
[2:19:35.360 --> 2:19:40.680]  also have what are called hotspot volcanoes that would be like Kilauea a
[2:19:40.680 --> 2:19:44.680]  hotspot volcano the simplest explanation for that is if you could imagine
[2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:49.720]  yourself being inside of a basketball with a hot poker and sticking it from
[2:19:49.720 --> 2:19:54.160]  the inside out stay there we got a break this is riveting information we have a

[2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:21.200]  winning scientist in his travel all over the world working on volcanoes Dr.
[2:24:21.200 --> 2:24:24.880]  Trombley is also affiliated with many other volcanology associations he is a
[2:24:24.880 --> 2:24:28.160]  principal designer the highly successful software program called
[2:24:28.160 --> 2:24:32.440]  eruption pro 10.5 which provides long-term range forecast for volcanic
[2:24:32.440 --> 2:24:37.080]  eruptions all over the world one of the top volcano eruption experts out there
[2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:41.640]  in the world we're very very honored to have him I had misplaced his bio game
[2:24:41.640 --> 2:24:44.880]  of shows we went back over that okay this is a short segment long one coming
[2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:48.360]  up next the final segment with you but let's get right back into the three
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:53.320]  types of volcanoes and these these these these very low explosive types that you
[2:24:53.320 --> 2:24:56.720]  were talking about that are just oozing versus amount St. Helens that is so
[2:24:56.720 --> 2:25:01.600]  explosive and then the other type please continue yeah sure that's and so the
[2:25:01.600 --> 2:25:05.120]  we started with the composite and straddles those are like the Mount
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:09.520]  St. Helens and so forth and those are the usually the more explosive type
[2:25:09.520 --> 2:25:16.520]  volcanoes a hotspot volcano such as Kilauea is a relatively what we call a
[2:25:16.520 --> 2:25:21.720]  fuse of output it just a flowing of lava and so forth and the third most
[2:25:21.720 --> 2:25:26.600]  common type of volcanoes called a cinder cone and the reason it's called as
[2:25:26.600 --> 2:25:33.160]  because the output of the volcanoes very much like the cinders you see on a
[2:25:33.160 --> 2:25:36.720]  gravel driveway for example they normally don't explode more than once
[2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:40.960]  or twice in their lifetime that's the classic ones we see in dinosaur
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:46.800]  paintings are in the funstones yes that's right and by the way you can your
[2:25:46.800 --> 2:25:51.400]  listeners can check out all the latest eruptions that we have all over the
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:26:04.120]  world right now on our website which is a www.intlvrc.org so and we'll put that
[2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:07.960]  up on screen for folks as we're also simulcasting the radio show great via
[2:26:07.960 --> 2:26:15.400]  television doctor is overall volcanic activity increasing right now are we
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:19.360]  in an uptick in the cycle just from watching the news it seems like there's a
[2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:24.200]  lot more eruptions going on right now no that's somewhat of an illusion that we
[2:26:24.200 --> 2:26:31.600]  normally have about 40 to 60 eruptions a year the reason that it appears that way
[2:26:31.600 --> 2:26:37.120]  is because of the technology and the mass media we have now I mean you know 10
[2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:43.000]  15 years ago a lot of people didn't even know an eruption went off except those
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:48.040]  of us in the business and sometimes we get that three four weeks later even
[2:26:48.040 --> 2:26:53.320]  longer yeah now it's almost that we if an eruption goes off anywhere in the
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:59.080]  world including in the oceans and so forth like on islands I mean in the
[2:26:59.080 --> 2:27:03.520]  oceans and stuff like that we we know about it within minutes how many other
[2:27:03.520 --> 2:27:07.840]  super volcanoes are there that are somewhat active that aren't dormant
[2:27:07.840 --> 2:27:11.800]  there are well first of all they're all dormant at the moment
[2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:16.720]  fortunately not extinct but dormant which means there's a sleeping there's
[2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:22.760]  about two or three of them a Yellowstone is one the one in Sumatra
[2:27:22.760 --> 2:27:28.240]  Toba and another one in New Zealand called Toppo any undersea ones I would
[2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:32.840]  imagine that super volcanoes that we know of at the moment there's lots of
[2:27:32.840 --> 2:27:38.040]  volcanoes under the ocean but none of them are super volcanoes so this would
[2:27:38.040 --> 2:27:43.280]  be thousands of times what Mount St. Helens was why are people panicking why
[2:27:43.280 --> 2:27:46.120]  are some people moving out of the area why are they having false alerts
[2:27:46.120 --> 2:27:55.160]  if this is just part of a normal cycle well I don't really know why the fear
[2:27:55.160 --> 2:28:00.880]  factor is in there but it could be tied to a few things number one they had a
[2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:07.240]  movie a kind of a semi-documentary on Yellowstone eruption not too long ago
[2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:15.560]  and that was very very accurate by the way so that might be a part of it the
[2:28:15.560 --> 2:28:22.040]  others that you know people are just generally afraid and so forth could it
[2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:25.040]  be that earthquakes have been killing more people and they saw the big tsunami
[2:28:25.040 --> 2:28:29.040]  and folks are realizing this is a planet that's all always changing you know I
[2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:32.560]  hear terms like we've got to stop climate change but the climate's always
[2:28:32.560 --> 2:28:36.160]  changing and I've read that volcanoes put out a lot more co2 and other
[2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:41.520]  greenhouse gases than humans ever ever could that's true that volcanoes do put
[2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:46.760]  out a lot of different kinds of gases and so forth but there I would say
[2:28:46.760 --> 2:28:52.640]  overall that the contribution of volcanoes to climate global warming and
[2:28:52.640 --> 2:29:03.160]  so on is somewhat minor I think more damage is done by human stuff that you
[2:29:03.160 --> 2:29:08.320]  hear about all the time really humans I mean the oceans full of co2 and I've
[2:29:08.320 --> 2:29:12.760]  seen the charts it's just thousands of times with what human activity is but
[2:29:12.760 --> 2:29:18.600]  I mean I guess that's just another issue yes it is you know I do believe in
[2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:23.040]  global warming and so forth but I don't think the volcanoes have a lot I
[2:29:23.040 --> 2:29:27.040]  shouldn't say they don't have anything to do with it they have a very minor
[2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:30.960]  place in that I mean my issue is I thought the Sun was most of climate I
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:34.240]  mean the ice caps on Mars we're getting smaller now they're getting bigger
[2:29:34.240 --> 2:29:40.160]  because things cooled off no that's a normal cycle on Mars yeah these caps
[2:29:40.160 --> 2:29:44.280]  waning and waxing as they were and so I thought it was a normal cycle here too
[2:29:44.280 --> 2:29:47.680]  because we see it all over the solar system but let's get back into volcano

[2:33:13.880 --> 2:33:23.840]  Tromboli PhD doctor of volcanology is our guest and get a lot of calls about the
[2:33:23.840 --> 2:33:28.360]  Yellowstone all these hundreds of earthquakes briefly what's happening
[2:33:28.360 --> 2:33:31.680]  up in Alaska you're saying it's a probability that that is going to
[2:33:31.680 --> 2:33:39.840]  erupt yeah as of today the Alaska volcano observatory is reported that the
[2:33:39.840 --> 2:33:45.520]  redoubt volcano continues seismic activity and it's continued
[2:33:45.520 --> 2:33:53.680]  unrest the seismic activity is remaining at elevated in and is steady and is
[2:33:53.680 --> 2:33:58.800]  well above the background level at the moment however the overall level of the
[2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:04.080]  seismic activity has declined somewhat over the last 24 hours as a matter of
[2:34:04.080 --> 2:34:10.640]  fact we do have webcams and satellite images from this volcano and this
[2:34:10.640 --> 2:34:17.200]  morning have been at red somewhat obscured by the clouds but at any rate
[2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:24.600]  the melting of the glacier has produced a 200 mile hole which is emitting gases
[2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:29.320]  in fact the federal aviation administration has issued a temporary
[2:34:29.320 --> 2:34:36.760]  flight restriction for a 10 mile radius around the redoubt volcano up to a 60
[2:34:36.760 --> 2:34:47.320]  thousand feet so it's still at unrest but it's has not erupted yet it may erupt
[2:34:47.320 --> 2:34:53.400]  we are forecasting it to erupt at about 61% probability right now within days
[2:34:53.400 --> 2:35:00.920]  or weeks and what type of volcano was this how big will the eruption be well
[2:35:00.920 --> 2:35:06.120]  we don't know how big the eruption will be we never know that but it is a
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:13.080]  straddle type volcano so that most of your straddle volcanoes
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:23.840]  lie along plate margins so that's what kind of volcano that is I know you
[2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:27.720]  don't really study hydrogen bombs but there were some debates about if there
[2:35:27.720 --> 2:35:31.720]  was ever you know nuclear testing causing earthquakes and some evidence that
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:35.600]  it was triggering seismic activity around the world and kind of a domino
[2:35:35.600 --> 2:35:41.160]  effect I wonder what happened if a hydrogen bomb went off over Yellowstone
[2:35:41.160 --> 2:35:45.600]  or right in the middle of the caldera could that open up a fissure I mean we
[2:35:45.600 --> 2:35:50.080]  know there's a bunch of tectonic plates floating around on molten magma I'm just
[2:35:50.080 --> 2:35:55.200]  curious because a lot of military bases based out there and things I suppose it
[2:35:55.200 --> 2:36:00.040]  could yes and the reason I'm somewhat laughing is because we we get all kinds
[2:36:00.040 --> 2:36:04.360]  of questions on our on our website we have an email address that people can
[2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:08.400]  write in questions every once in a while we had one guy a couple years ago
[2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:13.080]  want to know if we could plant bombs in Yellowstone to relieve the pressure and
[2:36:13.080 --> 2:36:23.120]  so forth that's not going to happen but sure any type of a bomb could could
[2:36:23.120 --> 2:36:28.600]  cause a rupture in in the magma chamber and so forth the fact there's a very
[2:36:28.600 --> 2:36:34.360]  famous story about World War two in Italy bomber pilots and fighter pilots
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:40.080]  used to drop their unspent bombs supposedly in Vesuvius and that's what
[2:36:40.080 --> 2:36:47.960]  caused it to erupt it last time in 1944 so that never really did happen but
[2:36:47.960 --> 2:36:51.800]  that's what all the Italian people used to say the reason the volcano erupted
[2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:56.680]  because pilots were dropping their bombs in the volcano why Vesuvius sure kill
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:37:04.200]  a lot of people didn't it yes that's right killed quite a few
[2:37:04.200 --> 2:37:07.440]  all right well as things develop we'd like to have you back up sir fire out
[2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:10.400]  that website again for folks want to learn more about volcanic activity
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:24.200]  world-wide website is www.intlvrc.org all right so int lvrc.org

[2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:36.480]  bet okay that ran a little bit over but it's important information so we
[2:37:36.480 --> 2:37:39.160]  covered it there for you to try to answer some of the listeners questions at
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:43.280]  least from his perspective now for the balance of this hour maybe a little bit
[2:37:43.280 --> 2:37:46.280]  in the next hour than Jason Burmese will be with us on prison planet TV
[2:37:46.280 --> 2:37:51.800]  summer casting for via video cam from upstate New York Aaron Zelman with one
[2:37:51.800 --> 2:37:55.400]  of the only real pro second amendment groups in this country we've had Larry
[2:37:55.400 --> 2:37:59.240]  Pratt with his hundreds of thousands of members and governors of America come on
[2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:03.520]  and tell you and read the quotes and documents the NRA was founded as a gun
[2:38:03.520 --> 2:38:09.160]  control organization that it helped pass the 68 gun control act and others
[2:38:09.160 --> 2:38:12.560]  before that it's a judo scope and they've introduced a bunch of bills to
[2:38:12.560 --> 2:38:17.320]  psychologically test to make you become federally licensed to get your all of
[2:38:17.320 --> 2:38:25.600]  your psychological records they've we now have excuse me we now have the chief
[2:38:25.600 --> 2:38:29.200]  of staff Rahm Emanuel saying that they want to have a blacklist the million
[2:38:29.200 --> 2:38:35.280]  plus people now on the no fly list that without ever charging you or even letting
[2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:38.560]  you know that they will put people they don't like on the list so you can own
[2:38:38.560 --> 2:38:42.760]  guns and they're saying we're gonna use the threat of terrorism as a way to sell
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:47.160]  this they've introduced bills to allow the attorney general to executive fiat to
[2:38:47.160 --> 2:38:53.280]  ban any semi-automatics he wishes at any time or any gun that has a something
[2:38:53.280 --> 2:38:56.800]  they don't like not just semi-auto the way it's written and these things are
[2:38:56.800 --> 2:39:00.560]  getting co-sponsors this is rushing forward this is happening we look at
[2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:03.680]  Obama's voting record Rahm Emanuel's voting record in the House and Senate
[2:39:03.680 --> 2:39:10.000]  they are they believe reasonable gun control is DC total ban Chicago ban so I
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:13.840]  wanted to get the director of Jews preservation firearms ownership Aaron
[2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:18.560]  Zellman on with us to get his response to this because in the past the
[2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:22.760]  establishment was came out and tried to push gun control and sell it they've been
[2:39:22.760 --> 2:39:25.960]  losing that battle for the hearts and minds and all the polls so now they're
[2:39:25.960 --> 2:39:30.560]  trying to shut down manufacturers harass gun dealers shut down gun shows make
[2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:35.960]  everybody register now they are just not trumpeting their attack they're just
[2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:40.000]  doing it Aaron Zellman good to have you on with us please give us a report about
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:44.680]  the dire situation the Second Amendment sin well thank you Alex well you are
[2:39:44.680 --> 2:39:51.320]  right about a dire situation we are faced with a war a literally war of war
[2:39:51.320 --> 2:39:58.680]  on gun owners a wage by the government it's a a mission that I guess you could
[2:39:58.680 --> 2:40:02.440]  call it the United States government's final solution to the Second Amendment
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:07.160]  I'm not trying to be funny with words but that's how serious the situation is
[2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:12.040]  with these folks that are now in charge and I would like that every gun owner
[2:40:12.040 --> 2:40:15.960]  who voted for the Obama administration I think they're too damn stupid owner gun
[2:40:15.960 --> 2:40:20.360]  they should give it to someone who appreciates the Second Amendment what
[2:40:20.360 --> 2:40:25.800]  that said let's go forward you know you're right and Larry Pratt is right
[2:40:25.800 --> 2:40:32.240]  too we are I think being sold out by the NRA quite frankly I mean we've been
[2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:37.840]  telling people for a long time at the NRA wrote a letter to one of our members
[2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:44.760]  saying they did not want to abolish the ATF the ATF is the arch enemy of the
[2:40:44.760 --> 2:40:49.400]  Second Amendment the ATF will take its jack booted marching orders from the
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:53.480]  Obama administration to destroy the Second Amendment well look at Holder
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:58.440]  look at Holder he wants a total gun ban he argued before the Supreme Court for
[2:40:58.440 --> 2:41:03.080]  the DC gun ban well that's correct that's right well let me just finish this
[2:41:03.080 --> 2:41:07.720]  one go ahead if someone is doubtful of what I'm saying they go to our website
[2:41:07.720 --> 2:41:13.160]  JPFO.org they can look at the letter the NRA wrote to one of our members make
[2:41:13.160 --> 2:41:17.520]  it very clear they don't want to abolish the ATF so I think people need to
[2:41:17.520 --> 2:41:23.440]  understand that that we have more than just enemies in the open though within
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:29.120]  the White House. Yeah we don't just have enemies without the game. We have
[2:41:29.120 --> 2:41:35.360]  enemies within and without go ahead. That's a good way to put it so I think so
[2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:40.840]  anyway I think that the the I'm glad to say we're working on a project I can't
[2:41:40.840 --> 2:41:44.880]  talk a lot about it now but it hopefully if gun owners will use it it will put
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:50.080]  the Obama administration on the defensive and it will raise the eye of
[2:41:50.080 --> 2:41:54.800]  millions and millions of people who have a vested interest in firearms ownership
[2:41:54.800 --> 2:41:58.640]  and get them motivated will give them the intellectual ammunition they need
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:02.880]  but it's going to be at least 60 days before we have that out. All right let's
[2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:07.320]  go over I mean I've analyzed these bills last week of this week on air but let's
[2:42:07.320 --> 2:42:12.600]  go over the the Armada of the each one of these makes the Assolubus ban look
[2:42:12.600 --> 2:42:17.200]  tame I mean national registration licensing your psychological records by
[2:42:17.200 --> 2:42:22.520]  Fiat the Attorney General banning whatever guns he wants you know shutting
[2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:27.200]  down gun show shutting down private transfer I mean I have never seen
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:34.440]  anything like this this is the full on assault and it's like you hear crickets
[2:42:34.440 --> 2:42:38.360]  well I think the first of all we have to keep an eye on which of these bills
[2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:43.880]  actually gets out of committee that's important that people realize that to
[2:42:43.880 --> 2:42:48.680]  keep an eye on if the bill gets out of committee there are there are people in
[2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:53.440]  the Congress who realize that gun control is a great way for them to lose
[2:42:53.440 --> 2:42:58.520]  an election and that might put a damper on some of this nonsense but it's
[2:42:58.520 --> 2:43:03.520]  dangerous because it's there and the other danger quite frankly is that the
[2:43:03.520 --> 2:43:09.400]  Obama administration will create some kind of must-pass legislation and then
[2:43:09.400 --> 2:43:12.680]  and then some amendments will be tacked on to it
[2:43:12.680 --> 2:43:17.360]  for nothing to destroy the second amendment yes I mean that's that that's
[2:43:17.360 --> 2:43:21.080]  that's what we're dealing with here it's beyond just watching it come out of
[2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:26.200]  committee but so we know we are we really are dealing with some dangerous
[2:43:26.200 --> 2:43:31.840]  fascists who do not want the American pillow defend themselves against the
[2:43:31.840 --> 2:43:36.480]  other I guess ever-growing government or let's be clear let's be clear about
[2:43:36.480 --> 2:43:40.840]  this and I want to get your take on an Aaron Zellman JPFO.org I mean just
[2:43:40.840 --> 2:43:44.080]  boil it down to make it simple these are prominent members of the house
[2:43:44.080 --> 2:43:48.080]  reintroducing legislation that the chief of staff now the White House Roman
[2:43:48.080 --> 2:43:52.840]  manual originally introduced these things have got a lot of political power
[2:43:52.840 --> 2:43:57.240]  they're just waiting for some shooting or something they stage to allow this to
[2:43:57.240 --> 2:44:01.040]  carry out and they're saying they want to use the anti-terror apparatus they
[2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:04.920]  built up in the phony war on terror against the second amendment so so my
[2:44:04.920 --> 2:44:11.080]  point is these bills let us know the Obamanoids intention so can you speak
[2:44:11.080 --> 2:44:16.080]  to that and then speak to the record of Obama of Emmanuel and of Holder and
[2:44:16.080 --> 2:44:20.800]  others well first of all I think their intentions are very clear that they
[2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:26.600]  don't want people to be armed I think that you will see a right I guess we
[2:44:26.600 --> 2:44:32.320]  call it a red flag operation where military pattern weapons are used to
[2:44:32.320 --> 2:44:37.720]  justify calling for a ban and I wouldn't put it past the ATF or other groups
[2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:43.320]  like that to to stage that type of an operation they don't really care if
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:49.680]  human beings are killed it's really not a high priority to them the Obama comes
[2:44:49.680 --> 2:44:53.360]  from Illinois Emmanuel comes from Illinois and they are great fans of
[2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:58.960]  banning guns outright of taxing they have a long history of wanting to
[2:44:58.960 --> 2:45:05.120]  destroy gun ownership and they really are they're very well they're dishonest
[2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:08.320]  in many ways one of them morally bankrupt the other is that they are
[2:45:08.320 --> 2:45:13.720]  intellectually dishonest because they claim that the crime is the reason they
[2:45:13.720 --> 2:45:16.720]  want to ban guns but they don't take a look at what they don't admit is the
[2:45:16.720 --> 2:45:20.880]  cause of the crime and I think in many instances it's what I would call the
[2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:29.400]  narco economy it is the war on drugs that is creating the violence the crime
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:36.040]  stop let me back you up Mexico has hundreds of murders a week sometimes
[2:45:36.040 --> 2:45:41.440]  more they are having tens of thousands of murders drug related there's a total
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:46.680]  gun ban citizens can own guns in Mexico and the whole society is imploding
[2:45:46.680 --> 2:45:50.680]  because the cartels are battling with the government that's been caught dealing
[2:45:50.680 --> 2:45:54.840]  drugs a million times so it's a drug war but the only real drug war is the drug
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:45:58.160]  dealers fighting with each other so you're absolutely right and look at the
[2:45:58.160 --> 2:46:02.760]  places where we have the narco terrorists Chicago New York places like
[2:46:02.760 --> 2:46:06.760]  that most these children dying we hear about the news are gangbanger numbers
[2:46:06.760 --> 2:46:10.520]  of them shooting each other so I was just backing you up please continue yeah
[2:46:10.520 --> 2:46:13.520]  in other words you'll be when you talk about the inner cities usually this is
[2:46:13.520 --> 2:46:18.120]  populated by black people and probably 80% of the crime there's black on black
[2:46:18.120 --> 2:46:22.880]  crime and most of it's related to a fighting over turf for a deal gone bad
[2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:29.120]  or you know or whatever and so this is something that I don't think that Eric
[2:46:29.120 --> 2:46:35.520]  Holder has the the moral decency to acknowledge the truth Obama certainly
[2:46:35.520 --> 2:46:39.600]  the astronomy doesn't have the moral decency to acknowledge the truth of
[2:46:39.600 --> 2:46:44.480]  what the problem is and I think that makes them very dangerous but perhaps
[2:46:44.480 --> 2:46:48.400]  these guys are more dangerous in some respect than we believe because who's
[2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:52.880]  really behind them and community these two guys are puppets and their strings
[2:46:52.880 --> 2:46:58.440]  are being pulled so who's pulling the strings wall street is just hijacked the
[2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:03.920]  nation stolen trillions it's taking over everything and they don't want armed
[2:47:03.920 --> 2:47:09.880]  people they're about to rob oh no not at all I think that it's not just wall
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:13.680]  street that's funny to rob somebody or to board that at the direction of the
[2:47:13.680 --> 2:47:17.880]  government I think that the tax situation in America has gotten out of hand
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:23.960]  and many other issues you know when the government can tell you how many gallons
[2:47:23.960 --> 2:47:26.800]  of water you can have in your toilet when it flushes then I think they've
[2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:32.280]  really invaded your privacy and again that may sound silly but you but you
[2:47:32.280 --> 2:47:37.040]  look at every single area of our life and there's a government there's
[2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:41.440]  government involvement and trying to take more and more of your freedom so it
[2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:45.720]  isn't just wall street that says robbing us at you it is the government is robbing
[2:47:45.720 --> 2:47:49.280]  us at every level no you're right I mean wall streets becoming the government
[2:47:49.280 --> 2:47:53.320]  and you're right what type of light bulb what type of toilet what type of car
[2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:56.760]  training the children going in and saying your parents are dumb global
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:48:00.680]  warming's real we got to have a tax for it I mean this is what we saw in Nazi
[2:48:00.680 --> 2:48:05.080]  Germany Soviet Russia it's classic that Americans can't believe it's really
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:09.240]  happening and one thing that everyone knows but they're not thinking about it
[2:48:09.240 --> 2:48:15.080]  clearly is that it was bad financial times have brought the Nazis to power
[2:48:15.080 --> 2:48:23.240]  and we're already seeing signs of extreme fascism in America so what's the
[2:48:23.240 --> 2:48:27.320]  battle plan Aaron's element well before we get into the battle plan solutions
[2:48:27.320 --> 2:48:31.560]  in the next segment you're always you know focusing on the way they're
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:37.480]  attacking extra judiciously or or extra judicially outside the courts outside
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:42.520]  law harassing gun dealers gun manufacturers what are the boys in black
[2:48:42.520 --> 2:48:50.080]  doing right now well they don't exactly call and tell me they're planning I
[2:48:50.080 --> 2:48:56.800]  think the first thing I would tell the American people is to start be prepared
[2:48:56.800 --> 2:49:02.720]  for some type of a a situation where military pattern weapons are used to
[2:49:02.720 --> 2:49:08.920]  create a massacre that Obama needs that Eric Holder needs that to promote some
[2:49:08.920 --> 2:49:14.160]  gun control scheme so I would suggest that people start to be on the lookout
[2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:18.320]  for it and to tell others to be on the lookout for it and I would tell you the
[2:49:18.320 --> 2:49:22.240]  best way to stop it is when everyone's going to be suspicious of it and not
[2:49:22.240 --> 2:49:28.360]  trusted exactly elaborate I was about to say by us watching we may be able to
[2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:33.360]  stop them police well I think what watch feds when they're in your area sorry go
[2:49:33.360 --> 2:49:39.520]  ahead oh you're right Alex in other words you know we have to put on the
[2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:43.040]  magnifying glass so to speak we have to start looking at every single thing the
[2:49:43.040 --> 2:49:47.840]  feds are doing we have to we have to reach out to other people we know and
[2:49:47.840 --> 2:49:53.640]  tell them to be on the lookout become extremely suspicious of every single
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:49:57.360]  thing the federal government is doing and not just the federal government your
[2:49:57.360 --> 2:50:00.880]  own state government your city government because they are often
[2:50:00.880 --> 2:50:07.000]  pressured by the feds to do things so I think that's step number one for a game
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:12.080]  plan is it we got to get people to wake up quite frankly and to pay more
[2:50:12.080 --> 2:50:15.480]  attention to what's really going on around their lives and they become
[2:50:15.480 --> 2:50:21.200]  extremely suspicious when the government seems to want to take advantage of a
[2:50:21.200 --> 2:50:27.800]  situation that's what we're doing now with the financial problems
[2:50:27.800 --> 2:50:30.480]  we're having to try to take advantage of it
[2:50:30.480 --> 2:50:36.160]  a manual even said that he's a worker to waste a good crisis well at least he's
[2:50:36.160 --> 2:50:41.360]  honest about that right yeah the devil is do right absolutely Aaron Zellman can

[2:54:13.360 --> 2:54:18.760]  this is the real thing they are coming out the second amendment Aaron Zellman
[2:54:18.760 --> 2:54:24.880]  highly respected one of the largest second amendment advocacy grids in the
[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:30.600]  country filmmaker researcher you know to come on this show and to say I believe
[2:54:30.600 --> 2:54:35.720]  they are ready to stage terror attacks stage mass shootings and there's
[2:54:35.720 --> 2:54:38.840]  hundreds of points that back this up and I know those are the points and others
[2:54:38.840 --> 2:54:42.280]  he's going off of and we know that some of the other mass shootings have been
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:46.560]  staged events the evidence is just overwhelming it's very easy for him to
[2:54:46.560 --> 2:54:48.920]  do this and we know other governments have done this has been done in
[2:54:48.920 --> 2:54:54.480]  Australia it's been done in Russia they've been caught in Russia and they
[2:54:54.480 --> 2:54:57.640]  just go in gun down a patsy then their guys in black uniforms shoot a bunch
[2:54:57.640 --> 2:55:01.080]  people in masks they did get a police uniforms drive out the back they always
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:05.200]  ordered the feds always order the locals to stand down that's always for hours
[2:55:05.200 --> 2:55:10.800]  while they clean it up some of the people escape and say I saw more than
[2:55:10.800 --> 2:55:15.040]  one person I saw I saw police shooting people that that happened in Columbine
[2:55:15.040 --> 2:55:18.560]  and that meant that's been in the Denver Post but you know then the police
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:25.880]  cover it up this is sick but I want to flesh that out some more how you see
[2:55:25.880 --> 2:55:29.520]  them doing it or what what police we know most police and even feds aren't
[2:55:29.520 --> 2:55:33.320]  involved in the special units do it about how we can stop them from doing
[2:55:33.320 --> 2:55:36.160]  because clearly you can see they're stacked they're ready they're ready to
[2:55:36.160 --> 2:55:39.120]  launch they're gonna need this event even Rush Limbaugh said he believes they're
[2:55:39.120 --> 2:55:42.640]  staging events in the past you ever notice how when they got a gun bill
[2:55:42.640 --> 2:55:47.080]  introduced something happens Aaron Zelman you want to tell me one more
[2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:52.040]  time to lessons Aaron Zelman just break it down for us break down false flag
[2:55:52.040 --> 2:55:56.560]  attacks well I'm not an expert on it but I think that people can look at past
[2:55:56.560 --> 2:56:00.800]  experience and see how they've done it the mechanics of it but you take a look
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:05.480]  at the stockton massacre with Patrick Purdy very suspicious about how it
[2:56:05.480 --> 2:56:11.520]  happened there've been other events like that and you'll always notice that the
[2:56:11.520 --> 2:56:17.600]  shooter always commit suicide so it's all that it's very clean for the
[2:56:17.600 --> 2:56:22.760]  government they just wrap it up you look at the way they handled Waco I mean
[2:56:22.760 --> 2:56:26.440]  they did a day they do they do it the way they want to if they kill people off
[2:56:26.440 --> 2:56:31.040]  and then they have the official story and so I think the people need to be
[2:56:31.040 --> 2:56:35.760]  always alert about the official story because that that says a whole lot that
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:40.680]  they hope that the people don't read between the lines yeah the I think that
[2:56:40.680 --> 2:56:44.440]  something that everyone get their hands on because the official story will be
[2:56:44.440 --> 2:56:48.840]  trumpeted by you know Charlie Gibson and then Katie Kurek and all the rest of
[2:56:48.840 --> 2:56:54.720]  those morons and they will keep pushing the official story and that's when you
[2:56:54.720 --> 2:56:59.160]  need to be good you have to get very very nervous because that official story
[2:56:59.160 --> 2:57:03.720]  what they want you to believe it isn't exactly the truth well the be the truth
[2:57:03.720 --> 2:57:10.360]  the BATF on record and they covered this up for years out in Arizona did test of
[2:57:10.360 --> 2:57:16.200]  blowing up in the months before 95 Alvar Bimura building bombing of blowing
[2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:20.520]  up rider trucks filled with ammonium nitrate and then they were there minutes
[2:57:20.520 --> 2:57:25.240]  after telling doctors patch me up the doctor said you're not hurt so I mean
[2:57:25.240 --> 2:57:29.320]  they clearly are some dirty guys well there's no surprise there I mean the
[2:57:29.320 --> 2:57:34.400]  ATF as you know frames innocent gun owners and sends them off to prison
[2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:38.440]  claiming that they're semi-automatics or machine guns and I think you're gonna
[2:57:38.440 --> 2:57:43.400]  see more of that where my malfunctioning semi-automatic automatic is
[2:57:43.400 --> 2:57:46.560]  considered to be a machine gun but I think your listeners need to understand
[2:57:46.560 --> 2:57:51.000]  it that there was a point made in a recent court case with a David Olipson
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:56.760]  where the court agreed that according with the ATF that if a firearm of any
[2:57:56.760 --> 2:58:01.320]  kind including your two barrel your double-barrel shotgun for a firearm of
[2:58:01.320 --> 2:58:06.000]  any kind fires more than two rounds at one time with one pull the trigger they
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:12.120]  considered an illegal machine gun oh my gosh I remember seeing that ruling and
[2:58:12.120 --> 2:58:17.040]  expanding on that the bigger issue is that these gun ranges if your gun
[2:58:17.040 --> 2:58:21.280]  accidentally double fires they run and tattle and call the police on you so it
[2:58:21.280 --> 2:58:29.560]  goes to the Stasi secret police Gestapo tattletail culture out there by the
[2:58:29.560 --> 2:58:34.600]  people that claim their pro-second amendment well quite bluntly plenty of
[2:58:34.600 --> 2:58:38.840]  cowards in the pro-second amendment movement but I people like to know more

[3:01:10.120 --> 3:01:15.200]  screen for you a state may compensate juvenile sentenced by judges and this
[3:01:15.200 --> 3:01:20.960]  goes on right here in Austin by the way this is confirmed no judge no jury it's
[3:01:20.960 --> 3:01:25.520]  not a real judge on a real court no due process they they're so lazy when they
[3:01:25.520 --> 3:01:29.600]  kidnap small children they don't even get the names right on the paperwork
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:33.680]  they'll be kidnapped in a newborn baby and say the three-year-old had cigarettes
[3:01:33.680 --> 3:01:37.600]  put on his arm and it's a baby they'll have the name wrong on it I mean I've
[3:01:37.600 --> 3:01:42.040]  been at cases covering it and you can't believe it and the judges are like
[3:01:42.040 --> 3:01:45.240]  demon creatures I mean if they ever needed to have a psychopath for a movie
[3:01:45.240 --> 3:01:48.480]  Holly would should go to central casting out of these family court judges I
[3:01:48.480 --> 3:01:52.440]  mean they're always the same just always just like I mean they'll even make
[3:01:52.440 --> 3:01:55.240]  faces like that and they call the families and they're shaking the
[3:01:55.240 --> 3:01:59.560]  child's done nothing wrong and they'll go you sign this document in this decree
[3:01:59.560 --> 3:02:05.320]  agreement right now or you'll never see your other children again and then the
[3:02:05.320 --> 3:02:10.360]  father will go oh oh no that's yet arrest him and the guy'll start crying

[3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:35.360]  the exception is good courts and in good systems it's totally bankrupt run for
[3:02:35.360 --> 3:02:39.240]  criminals buying for criminals we're gonna do that with him and that dovetails
[3:02:39.240 --> 3:02:47.400]  with the report I was getting into earlier about Al Gore going around
[3:02:47.400 --> 3:02:50.800]  saying your parents are down your parents are stupid you know better than
[3:02:50.800 --> 3:02:56.480]  them you know global warming is real so inducting these children into the
[3:02:56.480 --> 3:03:00.960]  climate change oh my gosh there's seasons that's illegal I better pay
[3:03:00.960 --> 3:03:05.640]  attacks to scare everybody now there there are yearly seasons there are also
[3:03:05.640 --> 3:03:13.760]  decade seasons and hundred year seasons they are called cycles so we will be
[3:03:13.760 --> 3:03:21.440]  getting into that as well with Jason Burma's and you know what I'm not gonna
[3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:30.200]  build up any you know build up too much anticipation at the end of the show
[3:03:30.200 --> 3:03:33.600]  today I'm gonna make a special announcement about the future of this
[3:03:33.600 --> 3:03:37.760]  radio show everything we're doing here with this operation and more so that is
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:44.000]  coming up later in this hour I'm looking for my Al Gore news article and we have
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:49.840]  the audio clips but I want to go over the Al Gore article itself after we come
[3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:53.760]  back from break but the state bottom line is taking over your children the
[3:03:53.760 --> 3:03:58.240]  state is saying they own your children the state is saying in court rulings
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:04:02.280]  that parents don't control their children that the states have no
[3:04:02.280 --> 3:04:06.800]  jurisdiction over their children that parents don't have any custody of their
[3:04:06.800 --> 3:04:11.240]  children that the state mothers and fathers exist to make babies for the
[3:04:11.240 --> 3:04:15.640]  state so the pedophiles that run the state the criminals that run the state
[3:04:15.640 --> 3:04:21.360]  can have their way with them and all over the nation thousands and thousands
[3:04:21.360 --> 3:04:28.400]  of cases of entire jurisdictions entire states entire courts run by people who
[3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:32.360]  were child kidnappers it's legalized child kidnapping whereas they used to
[3:04:32.360 --> 3:04:35.280]  grab people out of the jungles of Africa and put them on slave ships here they
[3:04:35.280 --> 3:04:40.640]  just grabbed your children so we'll look over that with Jason Burness as well

[3:09:15.840 --> 3:09:19.120]  power plant and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless
[3:09:19.120 --> 3:09:22.520]  electricity that's right it generates free electricity remember to the gas
[3:09:22.520 --> 3:09:26.600]  generators need gas but in the blackout gas pumps can't pump gas because they
[3:09:26.600 --> 3:09:29.920]  run an electricity the solar power generators like having a silent power

[3:10:53.120 --> 3:10:58.720]  if you get the website it's linked up on info wars dot com okay let's bring up
[3:10:58.720 --> 3:11:04.480]  Jason Burmes and asking what he thinks most important is going on right now and
[3:11:04.480 --> 3:11:08.480]  his take on just the world today the banker takeover the rest of it then I'm
[3:11:08.480 --> 3:11:12.080]  gonna get into how the state openly as we always warned you they were setting up
[3:11:12.080 --> 3:11:16.040]  for is trying to take over the family takeover society and engaging in every
[3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:19.680]  crime imaginable and some I hadn't imagined Jason Burmes good to have you
[3:11:19.680 --> 3:11:23.720]  here with us well thanks for having me Alex it's a it's a blast to be able to
[3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:28.360]  do this over the video cam we're gonna get more and more of our guests and more
[3:11:28.360 --> 3:11:34.640]  and more folks on air with us via via video cam I think you've got your mic
[3:11:34.640 --> 3:11:37.240]  turned up too loud I don't need a video check with you I don't know about an
[3:11:37.240 --> 3:11:41.440]  audio check so we got a house don't give an air conditioner on the background
[3:11:41.440 --> 3:11:46.880]  look at giant spacecraft is landing or maybe that's my headphones I'm not sure
[3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:50.960]  hopefully I just had it up with them so they said my levels were good oh there
[3:11:50.960 --> 3:11:53.920]  when I got better it doesn't matter I believe it's some kind of head redine in
[3:11:53.920 --> 3:11:57.760]  the audio building up to a feedback but whatever may have a new word head redine
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:01.360]  I think a head redine is a word Google it let's see definition head redine look
[3:12:01.360 --> 3:12:05.640]  it up for me um Jason what do you think's most important what's going on
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:10.760]  right now well really I think it's the combo pack between the glorification of
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:15.480]  Obama and the Obama administration passing every executive order possible in
[3:12:15.480 --> 3:12:18.320]  a very short amount of time I mean they're gonna get this stimulus package
[3:12:18.320 --> 3:12:21.680]  put through they're gonna carry on renditions it doesn't look like they're
[3:12:21.680 --> 3:12:25.120]  gonna get rid of any of these powers and like you highlighted earlier today
[3:12:25.120 --> 3:12:29.480]  Guantanamo Bay won't be gone for another year at least and they're still going to
[3:12:29.480 --> 3:12:33.520]  just have these people in secret prisons on top of that I think we're gonna see a
[3:12:33.520 --> 3:12:38.640]  total redistribution of forces in the Middle East from Iraq to Afghanistan but
[3:12:38.640 --> 3:12:41.920]  I think in the long run not even the long run probably in the next 18 months
[3:12:41.920 --> 3:12:46.280]  you're going to see an increase in troops overseas not a decrease and of
[3:12:46.280 --> 3:12:50.520]  course like you're talking about the creation of this domestic type police
[3:12:50.520 --> 3:12:54.240]  force at home I think that's a huge problem meanwhile every night I turn
[3:12:54.240 --> 3:12:59.040]  the television on Montel Williams is trying to sell me four coins with Obama's
[3:12:59.040 --> 3:13:04.200]  face on them with him with Washington and him with Kennedy so the brainwashing
[3:13:04.200 --> 3:13:09.680]  is definitely and I think that's the biggest danger well I agree with you I
[3:13:09.680 --> 3:13:13.720]  do see a little bit of the Obama mania wearing off and people really thought he
[3:13:13.720 --> 3:13:18.720]  was gonna fix everything overnight and city trying to make things worse yeah I
[3:13:18.720 --> 3:13:23.840]  mean obviously as we progress we're still going to we're gonna have more and
[3:13:23.840 --> 3:13:27.200]  more people wake up and now the right seems to be telling a little bit more
[3:13:27.200 --> 3:13:30.840]  of the truth like you highlighted earlier you know Glenn Beck actually did
[3:13:30.840 --> 3:13:35.800]  this chart you know when he's attacking Al Gore for global warming just like you
[3:13:35.800 --> 3:13:41.000]  would you said and he shows this chart of the inflation how much money's being
[3:13:41.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  printed and literally he gets on a ladder at the very end and shows the top
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:47.240]  of it so I think a lot of people financially on the right are going to
[3:13:47.240 --> 3:13:51.240]  start waking up and it's gonna be good for the gold and silver market you know
[3:13:51.240 --> 3:13:54.920]  you see gold shooting up I think silver is gonna shoot up too I think people are
[3:13:54.920 --> 3:13:57.920]  gonna start getting into hard currencies but as long as they keep this
[3:13:57.920 --> 3:14:02.120]  left-right paradigm alive as long as the Keith Overmans of the world are
[3:14:02.120 --> 3:14:08.000]  worshiping Obama and like you talked about earlier you said this CIA CEO cap
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:12.280]  is absolute nonsense you know they're not gonna be making $500,000 at the
[3:14:12.280 --> 3:14:16.480]  international and national banks so the public you know already I'm hearing
[3:14:16.480 --> 3:14:19.440]  people today saying isn't a great he's capping the salaries he's capping the
[3:14:19.440 --> 3:14:22.760]  salaries and I'm thinking to myself these CEOs that we're making you know
[3:14:22.760 --> 3:14:27.600]  25 million dollars a year on the books and probably another 50 million
[3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:31.680]  dollars off the books aren't going to give up their salaries well what's
[3:14:31.680 --> 3:14:41.200]  happening is it's a bait-and-switch they admit that they are putting in loopholes
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:45.400]  for the big four banks in the US and all of their executives and it doesn't
[3:14:45.400 --> 3:14:50.880]  count for the big companies that took the bailout previously well that was
[3:14:50.880 --> 3:14:54.160]  that's what people say there's two bailouts there's not that the other
[3:14:54.160 --> 3:14:58.320]  bailout is unlimited money total secrecy no one can investigate the private
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:15:04.640]  central banks the new bailout is those banks being given trillions more to go
[3:15:04.640 --> 3:15:10.600]  out and forcibly buy up the depressed economy so it's just an incredible
[3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:16.160]  bait-and-switch yeah absolutely but you know I do see more and more people
[3:15:16.160 --> 3:15:19.960]  waking up to the fact that we've been had you know I was watching some c-span
[3:15:19.960 --> 3:15:24.400]  last night and they were having the Bernie Madoff hearings and at least the
[3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:29.440]  members were attacking the sec for not going after what seemed like any large
[3:15:29.440 --> 3:15:32.880]  of posse scene because we're finding out that there's a lot more posse schemes
[3:15:32.880 --> 3:15:38.600]  other than Bernie Madoff's obviously a reserve system is a Ponzi scheme exactly
[3:15:38.600 --> 3:15:42.000]  and now they're starting to criticize the Fed my only fear is that through
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:46.560]  criticizing the Fed we're just going to have a new international currency
[3:15:46.560 --> 3:15:51.080]  exactly no no they're telling the Fed in name to create the new Federal Reserve
[3:15:51.080 --> 3:15:55.320]  known as the Bank of the US it'll be the fourth bank of the United States but
[3:15:55.320 --> 3:15:58.840]  it's going to be private called the Bank of the US just like the private
[3:15:58.840 --> 3:16:02.080]  Federal Reserve was called the Federal Reserve see they can't now that
[3:16:02.080 --> 3:16:05.480]  everybody knows it's private ten years ago I got laughed at 15 years ago got
[3:16:05.480 --> 3:16:10.320]  laughed at you know David Ray Griffin and you know others get laughed at
[3:16:10.320 --> 3:16:14.840]  people like the fellow that wrote the creature from Jekyll Island and got
[3:16:14.840 --> 3:16:19.480]  left at Dr. Stamont teeth got left at now okay everybody knows it's private
[3:16:19.480 --> 3:16:22.560]  it's offshore it's a scam now they're just setting up a new one calling it the
[3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:28.640]  Bank of the US or the bad bank and it'll be fully run by offshore banks I mean
[3:16:28.640 --> 3:16:33.280]  it's incredible so see now that now the Republicans are out of power the right
[3:16:33.280 --> 3:16:36.120]  wing phony media can start talking about all of this and keep some
[3:16:36.120 --> 3:16:40.640]  credibility because they're out of power but see then the Democrats now they
[3:16:40.640 --> 3:16:43.360]  won't talk about their leadership being involved in corruption because the
[3:16:43.360 --> 3:16:47.120]  petty low-level Democrats feel like that it's an extension of their personal
[3:16:47.120 --> 3:16:50.840]  power through the Democratic Party same thing with the Republicans I mean folks
[3:16:50.840 --> 3:16:55.000]  this is the final new world order move you've got to wake up and stop being so
[3:16:55.000 --> 3:16:59.400]  foolish and having this stupid party loyalty
[3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:05.560]  four years they could bring in the North American Union I mean this could be
[3:17:05.560 --> 3:17:10.720]  the time where Obama gets everybody under a new type of currency and a new
[3:17:10.720 --> 3:17:14.760]  structure for North America I could see that happening under this guy
[3:17:14.760 --> 3:17:18.640]  especially if the economy tanks even further in the next six months which
[3:17:18.640 --> 3:17:22.680]  everybody seems to be predicting so let's say that we double the job losses in
[3:17:22.680 --> 3:17:27.560]  the next two months which could happen I could see them saying well we really do
[3:17:27.560 --> 3:17:31.240]  need to not only restructure the banking industry but we're gonna have to do do
[3:17:31.240 --> 3:17:34.760]  so through infrastructure and this is where they bring in their super
[3:17:34.760 --> 3:17:40.040]  highways that are shown in the SPP documents absolutely I was right about
[3:17:40.040 --> 3:17:44.560]  heterodyne being where a frequency starts feeding back and building up and
[3:17:44.560 --> 3:17:47.920]  building up for two frequencies going together having alternative currents of
[3:17:47.920 --> 3:17:51.080]  two different frequencies that are combined to produce two new frequencies
[3:17:51.080 --> 3:17:54.160]  the sum of the difference of the original frequencies either or which may be
[3:17:54.160 --> 3:17:59.000]  used in radio or television receivers by proper tuning of the filtering so
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:02.360]  there you have I mean I don't know that's actually a heterodyne we were
[3:18:02.360 --> 3:18:08.200]  hearing that's right okay Burmese you know I'm obsessed with words now when we
[3:18:08.200 --> 3:18:13.240]  come back from break I want to get your take on Al Gore caught on tape but they
[3:18:13.240 --> 3:18:16.920]  do this in all the public schools I mean Time Magazine for kids over and over again
[3:18:16.920 --> 3:18:19.880]  every time I see an issue of it it says your parents don't know what's going on
[3:18:19.880 --> 3:18:23.320]  with the environment you're smart and cool get them in line and the New York
[3:18:23.320 --> 3:18:26.840]  Times comes out and says it or your parents need to be tattled on are they
[3:18:26.840 --> 3:18:30.080]  smoking pot what's in their medicine cabinet the cop comes and pats them on
[3:18:30.080 --> 3:18:33.280]  the head and the kid reports on them I mean this is classical East German
[3:18:33.280 --> 3:18:39.360]  Stasi or Soviet Russia but they're just doing it Burmese yeah you know I was
[3:18:39.360 --> 3:18:42.200]  watching the weather channel last night and they're actually admitting they're
[3:18:42.200 --> 3:18:45.760]  like well it's the coldest winter on record and in fact my time Warner was
[3:18:45.760 --> 3:18:49.840]  out earlier today because of the cold I mean there's actually outages going on
[3:18:49.840 --> 3:18:54.000]  not only a cable but internet up here because it's so cold and they poo pooed
[3:18:54.000 --> 3:18:57.400]  it they're like yeah it seems like it's getting colder but then they bring on the
[3:18:57.400 --> 3:19:01.640]  global warming expert and they show this big chart of the globe and they show
[3:19:01.640 --> 3:19:05.760]  this big heating on the top and that's what's causing the cooling in places
[3:19:05.760 --> 3:19:11.480]  like New York and Illinois well they claim last year the ice caps shrunk at
[3:19:11.480 --> 3:19:14.960]  record levels they actually expanded at record levels and we have a satellite
[3:19:14.960 --> 3:19:20.520]  photos their liars yeah absolutely a hundred percent swim they claim polar
[3:19:20.520 --> 3:19:26.080]  bears can't swim it's the best swimming land animal yes and you know I saw that
[3:19:26.080 --> 3:19:29.120]  commercial on last night that there are going to be polar bears in the next ten
[3:19:29.120 --> 3:19:34.080]  years unless we do something and there's this huge huge huge push for green I
[3:19:34.080 --> 3:19:38.240]  mean you hear green everywhere now let's talk about what green really means
[3:19:38.240 --> 3:19:41.840]  it means getting the green out of your wallet for good it means trying your
[3:19:41.840 --> 3:19:44.240]  little kids and little stazies and they'll get them used to tattling and
[3:19:44.240 --> 3:19:48.120]  bossing you on the environment and parents will be like oh junior cares no
[3:19:48.120 --> 3:19:52.080]  juniors being taught how to be a scumbag by the way junior you go tattling on

[3:24:43.080 --> 3:24:47.600]  and save the last remaining greenside cities the brainwashing starts early on
[3:24:47.600 --> 3:24:52.040]  and I don't know how to find footage the actual commercial but I'm sure if

[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:21.640]  freedom with a 1984 quote that's from Kevin S high school student fighting the
[3:25:21.640 --> 3:25:25.200]  new world order inside a government doctor nation camp and Jason I have
[3:25:25.200 --> 3:25:28.760]  stacks of such things we're trying to pull up we have the description of the
[3:25:28.760 --> 3:25:32.320]  game I want to pull the game up on screen and show people the evil co2
[3:25:32.320 --> 3:25:37.240]  monsters I mean folks you have children and raise them and change their diapers
[3:25:37.240 --> 3:25:40.120]  and feed them and everything and love them to hand them over to the degenerate
[3:25:40.120 --> 3:25:44.960]  government Jason Burmese yeah I think this is a sigh up that's been going on
[3:25:44.960 --> 3:25:49.200]  since my generation I mean I remember being sat down and watching a movie with
[3:25:49.200 --> 3:25:54.360]  all these celebrities that I knew Ted Danson I remember the guy from doogie
[3:25:54.360 --> 3:25:58.800]  howser was on a whoopee Goldberg and in one of the segments he was supposedly
[3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:03.880]  coming going outside ten years later and he was in a radioactive suit and it was
[3:26:03.880 --> 3:26:08.480]  going to kill the ozone layer and I believed it I mean I know a lot of
[3:26:08.480 --> 3:26:12.400]  intelligent people that fall for this because inherently I mean we don't want
[3:26:12.400 --> 3:26:17.200]  to pollute the planet Alex we're it's the genetic engineering they're
[3:26:17.200 --> 3:26:21.600]  keeping all the bad stuff going all this is a push for global taxation remember
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:24.680]  how they would deny on the shelves for taxation and now they admit it's for
[3:26:24.680 --> 3:26:30.240]  taxation yeah now you have congressmen you know people like Chris Dodd
[3:26:30.240 --> 3:26:34.640]  introducing this into legislation under a carbon tax and you know I remember
[3:26:34.640 --> 3:26:39.640]  watching your film America destroyed by design some years back and you exposed
[3:26:39.640 --> 3:26:43.880]  the United Nations was actually land grabbing under this this provision of
[3:26:43.880 --> 3:26:47.480]  environmentalism okay this isn't doing anything for us this is giving the
[3:26:47.480 --> 3:26:51.080]  globalist not only large chunks of land but then they're regulating our lives
[3:26:51.080 --> 3:26:55.320]  through carbon taxes through fictional man-made global warming look no one's
[3:26:55.320 --> 3:26:58.520]  saying that the climate doesn't change the climate has changed throughout
[3:26:58.520 --> 3:27:04.400]  history I mean we used to be parents that's a lie it's all kind of and that
[3:27:04.400 --> 3:27:12.440]  we what about captain planet exactly there's only shows well you know what
[3:27:12.440 --> 3:27:16.960]  really got me upset was earlier this year when I was down in Texas and you guys
[3:27:16.960 --> 3:27:22.120]  did that story on the ABC Planet Slayer website where there was just bloody
[3:27:22.120 --> 3:27:26.920]  pig carcasses around and the pigs life was worth more than yours because your
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:31.480]  carbon footprint was up and yeah this is a video game in Australian schools ABC
[3:27:31.480 --> 3:27:35.720]  News Australia and it was on there and it said when do you have to kill yourself
[3:27:35.720 --> 3:27:39.560]  and it was teaching them on the site that at 15 years old it's time to kill
[3:27:39.560 --> 3:27:43.360]  yourself because if you don't kill yourself it's gonna kill the earth
[3:27:43.360 --> 3:27:47.320]  there they're teaching them death education that's why suicides
[3:27:47.320 --> 3:27:50.400]  weigh up all over the west because they teach the little kids don't commit
[3:27:50.400 --> 3:27:54.160]  suicide this way and when you get depressed don't don't go in the
[3:27:54.160 --> 3:27:57.560]  bathroom and hang yourself on the door stall and then it explodes and then now
[3:27:57.560 --> 3:28:02.400]  they just got video games going kill yourself yeah and it's not even 15
[3:28:02.400 --> 3:28:06.640]  years old literally 18 months the children themselves what's wrong with
[3:28:06.640 --> 3:28:11.120]  you they got to save the earth it's unbelievable to me and you know this
[3:28:11.120 --> 3:28:15.200]  does relate to the indoctrination even when I was a kid the dare program you
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:18.920]  know if I remember the commercials you know I learned it by watching you and
[3:28:18.920 --> 3:28:22.400]  of course the kid learned how to smoke pop from his father and his father's the
[3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:28.400]  better guy he should be ratting out his dad I mean it is just unbelievable to me
[3:28:28.400 --> 3:28:32.840]  the amount of propaganda that has been pushed upon me throughout my entire
[3:28:32.840 --> 3:28:37.040]  life and continues to be pushed upon the newer generation that unfortunately Alex
[3:28:37.040 --> 3:28:40.920]  I see them more brainwashed than ever I mean you watch the commercials in the
[3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:45.200]  Super Bowl and another commercial really caught me about how dumbed it down we
[3:28:45.200 --> 3:28:48.800]  are there's this guy sitting in his garage and there's all these monkeys
[3:28:48.800 --> 3:28:53.400]  around him working on his car and literally the monkeys are smarter than
[3:28:53.400 --> 3:28:56.880]  him and his friend that are having this conversation that five-year-olds could
[3:28:56.880 --> 3:29:00.960]  have you know I mean they're talking real slow their eyes are open they don't
[3:29:00.960 --> 3:29:06.600]  know what's going on they're very docile and this is the new acceptance in our
[3:29:06.600 --> 3:29:11.920]  society they're teaching people they're teaching people listen half of the corn

[3:34:00.320 --> 3:34:03.920]  the club of Rome told us they said it's complete fraud they're designing it to
[3:34:03.920 --> 3:34:08.040]  teach us that humans are bad so the state as Richard in Haas quote can wage
[3:34:08.040 --> 3:34:12.880]  war against the population why did Rockefeller fund Hitler on record you know
[3:34:12.880 --> 3:34:17.920]  major university press books on it why did they fund eugenics sterilization
[3:34:17.920 --> 3:34:20.880]  there's too many of us they're saying that's why they're pushing for one child
[3:34:20.880 --> 3:34:24.120]  policies in the u.s. and England and Europe despite the fact the west is
[3:34:24.120 --> 3:34:28.840]  dying and has a negative population growth they're doing all of this even if
[3:34:28.840 --> 3:34:32.000]  you're for eugenics and forward is in the population and see the comments on my
[3:34:32.000 --> 3:34:35.880]  website you have to understand that they just industrialized things with clean
[3:34:35.880 --> 3:34:38.680]  industry and didn't suppress technologies we can fix things there's real
[3:34:38.680 --> 3:34:42.840]  environmental crises genetic engineering toxic waste dumping things of
[3:34:42.840 --> 3:34:47.120]  that nature nuclear weapons do you being used all over the planet but carbon
[3:34:47.120 --> 3:34:50.280]  dioxide is what most of the water in the oceans made up out of it's what the
[3:34:50.280 --> 3:34:54.440]  clouds are made up out of its water vapor basically it's what humans excels
[3:34:54.440 --> 3:34:58.640]  with plants breathe but I see commercials on TV going waste management
[3:34:58.640 --> 3:35:02.520]  companies planting trees that clean the air of deadly carbon dioxide that's
[3:35:02.520 --> 3:35:07.000]  killing our earth four things make life on this planet without these it doesn't
[3:35:07.000 --> 3:35:12.040]  happen without one of these that happened oxygen carbon dioxide water and
[3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:19.920]  sunlight well they're taxing the carbon cycle by doing that and the video game
[3:35:19.920 --> 3:35:23.720]  actually says battle co2 monsters but you're telling me that computer the way
[3:35:23.720 --> 3:35:27.520]  it's hooked up we can't play audio while we have Burma song we got another
[3:35:27.520 --> 3:35:30.560]  computer up so we can do that in here some people go to hear the audio from
[3:35:30.560 --> 3:35:35.360]  this so this is all about eugenics and and they come into the youth and they
[3:35:35.360 --> 3:35:40.080]  say you're so important you're so special you're saving the earth you're a
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:44.800]  hero your parents are backwards and don't know and denying climate change is
[3:35:44.800 --> 3:35:48.880]  like denying the holocaust or denying we needed civil rights they actually say
[3:35:48.880 --> 3:35:51.720]  this and Al Gore went part of the way in a speech we're gonna play in a minute
[3:35:51.720 --> 3:35:58.160]  just a few days ago and so you've got to accept that we're gonna battle for the
[3:35:58.160 --> 3:36:02.280]  co2 and then your children turn into tattletales now in fact Google this
[3:36:02.280 --> 3:36:05.600]  after we show the sponge Bob's I know you've got it pulled up on screen right
[3:36:05.600 --> 3:36:10.040]  now or minimize that and pull this up climate cops just Google climate cops
[3:36:10.040 --> 3:36:13.520]  they pay the kids they wear uniforms in England they're starting in here in the
[3:36:13.520 --> 3:36:18.040]  US and it says boss your parents write your parents tickets will give you
[3:36:18.040 --> 3:36:22.040]  fictitious tickets and see it sounds reasonable they start them out writing
[3:36:22.040 --> 3:36:26.240]  tickets oh it's for the earth and then it's everything else it's spying on you
[3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:30.640]  for what you're saying what you're doing I mean this is classic tyranny pint
[3:36:30.640 --> 3:36:37.560]  size eco police making parents proud and sometimes crazy New York Times New
[3:36:37.560 --> 3:36:42.840]  York Times they're showing the video game on screen right now that oh it's
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:46.360]  making the earth flood the floods aren't natural wind blowing is a natural
[3:36:46.360 --> 3:36:51.160]  we're dying kill the climate monsters here come the saviors but that's coming
[3:36:51.160 --> 3:36:55.240]  up in a moment sometimes Jennifer Ross feels she cannot make a move at home
[3:36:55.240 --> 3:36:59.760]  without inviting the scorn of her daughter's 10 year old grace and seven
[3:36:59.760 --> 3:37:04.480]  year old aliza the accurate mdx she drives a flagrant polluter the bath at
[3:37:04.480 --> 3:37:11.520]  night to help relax her a wasteful indulgence so yeah the reusable shopping
[3:37:11.520 --> 3:37:15.240]  bags she forgot again tis tisk I am very very environmentally conscious
[3:37:15.240 --> 3:37:18.760]  children more so than me and I'm embarrassed to say says miss Ross a
[3:37:18.760 --> 3:37:22.400]  social worker from Dobbs Ferry New York they're on my case about getting a
[3:37:22.400 --> 3:37:25.600]  hybrid car they want me to replace all the light bulbs in the house with the
[3:37:25.600 --> 3:37:29.400]  toxic waste mercury bulbs by the way that give you headaches with energy saving
[3:37:29.400 --> 3:37:33.520]  bulbs miss Ross children are part of that expert say is a growing army of eco
[3:37:33.520 --> 3:37:38.280]  kids stepping in environmentalism at school in houses of worship through
[3:37:38.280 --> 3:37:41.800]  scouting and even via popular culture who try to hold their parents accountable
[3:37:41.800 --> 3:37:47.240]  at home and the state always turns the children loose on their parents this is
[3:37:47.240 --> 3:37:50.640]  the state taking over the children and we have all these different federal and
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:53.280]  state court rulings where they're claiming like the one in California a few
[3:37:53.280 --> 3:37:57.720]  months ago that the state owns your children that you have no parental rights
[3:37:57.720 --> 3:38:01.320]  over them they're trying to pass this united nations rights of the child
[3:38:01.320 --> 3:38:04.920]  where you tell me your religious belief they take your children from you it
[3:38:04.920 --> 3:38:09.960]  says it in there was reading this morning where if you don't let them be
[3:38:09.960 --> 3:38:14.280]  brainwashed by the state then they take them from you I mean this in Obama's
[3:38:14.280 --> 3:38:18.920]  saying is a ratify it this is all right here and so I want to play the salgore
[3:38:18.920 --> 3:38:22.160]  in the sponge bob thing in a moment should put up the main screen with all
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:28.120]  the games eco warriors fighting carbon dioxide monsters and sponge bob and all
[3:38:28.120 --> 3:38:32.400]  the other characters the kids love and identify with they are in there battling
[3:38:32.400 --> 3:38:37.400]  the evil monsters put that up on screen for folks I want them to see it Jason
[3:38:37.400 --> 3:38:41.320]  Burmese your take on all this yeah it's all over the culture and when they're
[3:38:41.320 --> 3:38:44.560]  not promoting you know global warming to kids they're promoting the police state
[3:38:44.560 --> 3:38:48.320]  I mean I look at video games I've got one right here by Microsoft it's called
[3:38:48.320 --> 3:38:53.400]  crackdown Alex and it's all about the new genetically engineered soldier that's
[3:38:53.400 --> 3:38:57.740]  coming into our states to fight crime you know they need these guys as they're
[3:38:57.740 --> 3:39:01.440]  really moving ahead with that go ahead yeah exactly I mean this is the new
[3:39:01.440 --> 3:39:05.240]  domestic police force and it's okay to be genetically enhanced and you're an
[3:39:05.240 --> 3:39:08.560]  agent of justice and there's no restraints whatsoever you can go up and
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:12.640]  now blow somebody's head off in a car and that doesn't matter no trial no
[3:39:12.640 --> 3:39:16.440]  arrest no one has any rights anymore and the kids play this and fantasize
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:22.400]  with it and become that yeah absolutely and I mean you look at a call it call the
[3:39:22.400 --> 3:39:25.920]  duty for the longest time was a game about World War two and it took place
[3:39:25.920 --> 3:39:29.320]  you know either on the beaches in Normandy or on the Pacific Rim but
[3:39:29.320 --> 3:39:33.520]  Call of Duty 4 comes around and where are they there in Iraq Alex you know so
[3:39:33.520 --> 3:39:36.560]  that we're not leaving Iraq anytime soon there's going to be battles in the
[3:39:36.560 --> 3:39:41.080]  Middle East they're bringing in you know these new domestic type games to train
[3:39:41.080 --> 3:39:46.000]  us for that next well I remember games 10 years ago where you hunt down and kill
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:51.520]  militia members and you even torture them yeah yeah and tortures a big part
[3:39:51.520 --> 3:39:55.320]  of games too I mean that that's a huge part of games now these interrogations
[3:39:55.320 --> 3:39:58.760]  that you can do to your victims I mean you can tie them up you can cut them
[3:39:58.760 --> 3:40:03.520]  slowly you can shoot them in the leg I mean it's really gotten to a sadistic
[3:40:03.520 --> 3:40:08.320]  level I never started video games were started as military simulators because
[3:40:08.320 --> 3:40:10.920]  they found that a large percentage of troops wouldn't kill somebody up close
[3:40:10.920 --> 3:40:14.480]  but they did paper targets and desensitized to instinctive shooting they
[3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:18.600]  would now they make it video games and then they're using them for training
[3:40:18.600 --> 3:40:23.600]  doom was originally a military training game yeah it's unbelievable to me those
[3:40:23.600 --> 3:40:27.600]  engines exactly those engines were used by the military to train troops and then
[3:40:27.600 --> 3:40:31.200]  they disperse them among the population I mean if you guys think that you know
[3:40:31.200 --> 3:40:34.960]  the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3 is at the height of the technology at this
[3:40:34.960 --> 3:40:39.000]  point that's laughable I wonder what they're using in military simulators
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:42.400]  especially the ones that are classified right now Alex and you know that's going
[3:40:42.400 --> 3:40:45.920]  to be amongst the kids in the next five to ten years in fact while you were away
[3:40:45.920 --> 3:40:50.280]  I did a story on the head of Sega actually coming out and saying he was
[3:40:50.280 --> 3:40:55.200]  using microchips you'll have to have a chip to play the game you'll have to
[3:40:55.200 --> 3:40:58.960]  have a chip to have a job of the transhumanist who openly in 1952 so
[3:40:58.960 --> 3:41:02.960]  we're changing our name from eugenicist worldwide to the transhumanist society
[3:41:02.960 --> 3:41:08.520]  Julian Huxley the head of the UN UNESCO board change the name to transhumanist
[3:41:08.520 --> 3:41:11.720]  and they say you won't have a job you won't be able to raise your children
[3:41:11.720 --> 3:41:15.480]  you're gonna have to be augmented and then everybody's gonna want it like it's
[3:41:15.480 --> 3:41:19.160]  the new iPhone and we get the new download of it literal cyberpunk
[3:41:19.160 --> 3:41:23.480]  wirehead but controlled by the state and then even if you think the matrix is
[3:41:23.480 --> 3:41:27.040]  fighting against all this still the good guys still jack in to go fight the
[3:41:27.040 --> 3:41:31.120]  evil that's right because eventually there won't be a choice and they're
[3:41:31.120 --> 3:41:35.480]  going to do this initially with video game systems because when your kids are
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:39.120]  whining and saying oh Joey's got this but I can't play it
[3:41:39.120 --> 3:41:43.000]  eventually they're going to get a job after school or come across a game and
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:46.560]  they'll chip themselves you know they'll go beyond their parents literally as
[3:41:46.560 --> 3:41:50.840]  preteens and teenagers Alex and then when their kids are born it won't be a
[3:41:50.840 --> 3:41:54.120]  big thing because they'll probably have three or four different types of RFID
[3:41:54.120 --> 3:41:58.280]  chips under their skin for various and that's what the world order says a
[3:41:58.280 --> 3:42:01.920]  hundred years ago the new man was they're gonna exterminate the majority of
[3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:04.600]  the population but first they're gonna get us to be cybernetically controlled
[3:42:04.600 --> 3:42:08.600]  cybernetically tracked surveilled those of us that don't accept will be put on
[3:42:08.600 --> 3:42:12.480]  reservations like Amish and then control bio weapons releases and then they're
[3:42:12.480 --> 3:42:16.080]  going to kill most of the other you know new transhuman people and the elite
[3:42:16.080 --> 3:42:19.160]  believe they're going to send a level of gods now am I saying that's real and
[3:42:19.160 --> 3:42:23.360]  really going to happen I don't know but they're trying to do it and I go back to
[3:42:23.360 --> 3:42:26.560]  Bill Joey why if he doesn't eat his corner some microsystems he goes to a
[3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:29.760]  meeting in 99 and they're all all these elitist meetings saying we're going to
[3:42:29.760 --> 3:42:34.520]  kill everybody folks this is happening the Air Force is converting over to
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:39.320]  drones to robots to combat mechs they got Terminator 4 coming out what they're
[3:42:39.320 --> 3:42:42.920]  not telling you is the elite actually believe they're gonna merge with the
[3:42:42.920 --> 3:42:48.520]  machines and then kill us this is a message to everyone yeah it's
[3:42:48.520 --> 3:42:52.120]  unbelievable and I think that drone point is an excellent one because you
[3:42:52.120 --> 3:42:55.200]  know let's say there is civil unrest in this country you know they're not going
[3:42:55.200 --> 3:42:59.640]  to send in a squadron of fighters to the resistance you know the 20 or 50 or a
[3:42:59.640 --> 3:43:02.880]  hundred or a thousand people that gather to try to resist no they're gonna send
[3:43:02.880 --> 3:43:06.360]  in drones that are going to fire upon you and you won't have a chance against
[3:43:06.360 --> 3:43:12.360]  them technology right now Alex is just what's public is absolutely astounding
[3:43:12.360 --> 3:43:16.640]  and we have to be very wary of who we put in control of that tech because
[3:43:16.640 --> 3:43:20.240]  here's the bigger issue right now here's the bigger issue the military says we
[3:43:20.240 --> 3:43:23.760]  won't fire American citizens 75% on average so they take those put them
[3:43:23.760 --> 3:43:27.800]  overseas give them deadly inoculations kick them out of the military use PTSD
[3:43:27.800 --> 3:43:30.440]  claims to take away their second amendment that's already happening but
[3:43:30.440 --> 3:43:35.800]  they take that 20 something percent and build up a unit a integrated unit
[3:43:35.800 --> 3:43:39.320]  inside the United States to carry this out against us but in the future with
[3:43:39.320 --> 3:43:44.160]  drone aircraft drone tanks drone soldiers which are now the Air Force by 2012
[3:43:44.160 --> 3:43:48.240]  will be majority drone that they've said that the globalist can pre-program it
[3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:51.720]  and do it all without soldiers even helping and they'll go back to robot
[3:43:51.720 --> 3:43:56.120]  factories to be repaired and upgraded so that's why the future doesn't need us
[3:43:56.120 --> 3:43:59.280]  that's why the elite want to kill us that's what this whole new world order is
[3:43:59.280 --> 3:44:02.760]  about that's why they're having the bank over takeover right now and telling you
[3:44:02.760 --> 3:44:06.080]  austerity you'll have no money you're going to be poor so they can force you
[3:44:06.080 --> 3:44:09.560]  to take the jobs they want to force you like five years ago the attorney general
[3:44:09.560 --> 3:44:13.080]  of Mexico making all of his employees taking planable microchips to have a
[3:44:13.080 --> 3:44:18.880]  job this is real this is happening this is not a movie this is the real world I
[3:44:18.880 --> 3:44:23.560]  want to go to Al Gore this was taped a glenbeck played it in a big school
[3:44:23.560 --> 3:44:30.000]  auditorium last week saying that your parents are okay but you know like my
[3:44:30.000 --> 3:44:33.360]  parents with the civil rights thing they didn't understand it well parents just
[3:44:33.360 --> 3:44:37.120]  don't understand things as well as you the young people do you're smart and the
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:40.920]  state is co-opting them where the 12 year olds these were 12 11 and 12 year
[3:44:40.920 --> 3:44:46.640]  olds go back and say mommy and daddy you know you are gonna do what the state
[3:44:46.640 --> 3:44:50.680]  says we are gonna lower our carbon footprint we're gonna live as feudal
[3:44:50.680 --> 3:44:53.680]  slaves here's the first clip Al Gore
[3:45:20.680 --> 3:45:45.720]  now he comes in with the even more important club about parents you know
[3:45:45.720 --> 3:45:49.640]  really aren't as smart or aren't as aware as their children and it's your job to go
[3:45:49.640 --> 3:45:54.280]  out and you know carry the torch out there to get this job done here it is
[3:45:54.280 --> 3:46:05.400]  there are some things about our world that you know that older people don't know stop
[3:46:05.400 --> 3:46:09.520]  right there you're an 11 and 12 year old kid there are some things in the world
[3:46:09.520 --> 3:46:13.920]  that your parents don't know that you know you know know they've been brainwashed
[3:46:13.920 --> 3:46:17.320]  because the parents were stupid and sent them to a government training camp here
[3:46:17.320 --> 3:46:27.760]  we go one of them things about our world that you know that older people don't
[3:46:27.760 --> 3:46:36.840]  know what's it well in a period of rapid change the old assumption sometimes
[3:46:36.840 --> 3:46:43.040]  just don't work anymore because they're out of date new knowledge new
[3:46:43.040 --> 3:46:48.320]  understandings are much more widely available okay that's enough it goes on
[3:46:48.320 --> 3:46:53.640]  and on it's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com the point here is the what
[3:46:53.640 --> 3:46:57.120]  the children know is playing SpongeBob killing carbon that carbon dioxide
[3:46:57.120 --> 3:47:00.640]  monsters what the kids don't know is they're exhaling that the whole planet
[3:47:00.640 --> 3:47:03.720]  is based on that by the globalist being able to list that as a toxic waste
[3:47:03.720 --> 3:47:06.480]  they're gonna be able to regulate and control everything just like there's
[3:47:06.480 --> 3:47:10.240]  10,000 more polar bears today than there was 20 years ago and polar bears are
[3:47:10.240 --> 3:47:15.000]  all over the place if they can say polar bears are endangered or threatened
[3:47:15.000 --> 3:47:18.640]  they can then take property steal control a large part of the northern
[3:47:18.640 --> 3:47:23.440]  hemisphere see it's all about getting an excuse to sell the public to acquiesce
[3:47:23.440 --> 3:47:28.560]  liberties and freedoms Jason Burmus. Absolutely and what I find extremely
[3:47:28.560 --> 3:47:32.600]  extremely disgusting is that he compared it with the civil rights movement
[3:47:32.600 --> 3:47:36.840]  Alex we are the civil rights movement at this point we're the ones that are
[3:47:36.840 --> 3:47:42.120]  fighting for all of humanity for every man they take a legitimate revolution
[3:47:42.120 --> 3:47:46.440]  and they integrate a fraudulent revolution of the elite against the
[3:47:46.440 --> 3:47:49.200]  people with it and that's what they say in Europe you'll be arrested in some
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:55.400]  areas now it's called climate denial and they're pushing for that they're
[3:47:55.400 --> 3:47:59.000]  trying to make it like a Holocaust denial in other countries where you can
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:03.040]  literally be arrested for for questioning the Holocaust if you question
[3:48:03.040 --> 3:48:06.120]  global warming well you need to be taken to a camp or you need to be
[3:48:06.120 --> 3:48:10.760]  reeducated this is complete and utter nonsense this is against the civil rights
[3:48:10.760 --> 3:48:15.400]  movement what you're trying to do is appear that the earth has more rights
[3:48:15.400 --> 3:48:20.400]  than actual human beings and through that appearance they will then land grab
[3:48:20.400 --> 3:48:24.840]  they will then tax you and they'll really put you to slavery they'll put you in a
[3:48:24.840 --> 3:48:30.080]  camp they'll put you into a compact and this is not our opinion that's how
[3:48:30.080 --> 3:48:33.120]  everything we say comes true because we're reading what they're saying but
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:36.120]  they're so arrogant they know we're playing SpongeBob games instead of
[3:48:36.120 --> 3:48:39.440]  reading their own documents Jason we're gonna go to break and come back with a

[3:54:44.840 --> 3:54:49.440]  Genesis for 24 hours a day myself Jason Bermas and a few other shows that we're
[3:54:49.440 --> 3:54:52.920]  gonna stick up there on the air and so it's gonna be an entirely new feed for
[3:54:52.920 --> 3:54:56.640]  all the stations out there that want to carry other Genesis programming and
[3:54:56.640 --> 3:55:00.840]  association with the info war and so Jason's moving down here to a three-hour
[3:55:00.840 --> 3:55:06.320]  nightly show right here in this seat where I sit and so when he goes back to
[3:55:06.320 --> 3:55:10.240]  visit he's keeping the place with his roommates up in New York when he goes
[3:55:10.240 --> 3:55:13.840]  back up there once a month or so he'll be doing it from there but you gotta get
[3:55:13.840 --> 3:55:16.880]  about our microphone at that setup there whatever that tinker is you got into
[3:55:16.880 --> 3:55:22.160]  good but so Jason Bermas there's the announcement pretty excited I am very
[3:55:22.160 --> 3:55:26.200]  excited you know Alex ever since I came across this information and really came
[3:55:26.200 --> 3:55:30.120]  across your film 9-11 in the road to tyranny I mean it began with this
[3:55:30.120 --> 3:55:35.920]  process of me looking up and verifying these things and then this process of
[3:55:35.920 --> 3:55:40.080]  me overcoming my fears literally you know I was waking up in cold sweats you know
[3:55:40.080 --> 3:55:44.160]  New York City a couple hours away from me growing up around there and for the
[3:55:44.160 --> 3:55:47.960]  World Trade Center to be an inside job and all that evidence pointers that was
[3:55:47.960 --> 3:55:52.200]  very uncomfortable for me but I got past it and I said you know what I need to do
[3:55:52.200 --> 3:55:56.520]  something about this I got involved with loose change it got bigger than you
[3:55:56.520 --> 3:56:01.000]  know really anybody could have imagined I you know got to meet you who was really
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:06.520]  Alex at the time you were my hero you were somebody stop it it's it's it's
[3:56:06.520 --> 3:56:11.360]  ridiculous when I watched you in America destroyed by design in the middle of the
[3:56:11.360 --> 3:56:16.440]  Grand Canyon in front of you know 50 or so tourists trying to explain to them
[3:56:16.440 --> 3:56:20.200]  that this was no longer our land and that this was given over to the alter of
[3:56:20.200 --> 3:56:24.880]  global governance and and just seeing you know your guts I said you know I can
[3:56:24.880 --> 3:56:29.240]  do that you know I've been laughed at before so what you know a lot of times
[3:56:29.240 --> 3:56:32.560]  in history and really the majority of times in history those that are laughed
[3:56:32.560 --> 3:56:36.800]  at by the majority end up being vindicated much sooner than the majority
[3:56:36.800 --> 3:56:40.640]  yeah well gone they got laughed at the abolitionist got laughed at the founding
[3:56:40.640 --> 3:56:44.120]  fathers got laughed at it always happens and now people don't laugh if you go to
[3:56:44.120 --> 3:56:47.080]  the Grand Canyon and say that people aren't laughing anymore because everything
[3:56:47.080 --> 3:56:51.480]  we talked about has come true so now people are paying attention exactly
[3:56:51.480 --> 3:56:55.120]  exactly and you know I'm not here to preach the choir either Alex I know
[3:56:55.120 --> 3:56:59.760]  that your your audience is enormous and tremendous but I think this is that more
[3:56:59.760 --> 3:57:02.920]  than ever is a time to bring in the young people okay we need to bring those
[3:57:02.920 --> 3:57:07.280]  people into this information so that they don't join an Obama youth corps so
[3:57:07.280 --> 3:57:10.480]  they don't join the military so they don't join the New World Order that's
[3:57:10.480 --> 3:57:12.840]  why we're up in our game there's a bunch of other new stuff we're gonna be
[3:57:12.840 --> 3:57:16.960]  announcing in the next month or so as well we're we are gearing up we are
[3:57:16.960 --> 3:57:20.400]  fighting we are taking action a lot of new expenses getting the board ops
