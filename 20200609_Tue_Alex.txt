[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.000]  Cult leaders determine what their followers are allowed to believe, even on their most private thoughts.
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  In order to do this, cults separate people from all they have known before.
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  They force their members to renounce their former lives, their countries, their customs.
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  They allow no loyalty except to the cult.
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  The first thing they attack always is the family.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  Families are the main impediment to brainwashing and extremism.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  That's true in every culture.
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  So if you're going to control individuals, if you're going to transform free people into compliant robots,
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  the first thing you must do is separate them from the ones who love them most.
[01:07.000 --> 01:15.000]  The important thing for white parents to keep in the front of our mind is that if black children in this country are not allowed innocence and childhood
[01:15.000 --> 01:22.000]  without fear of being killed by police or marginalized in some other way, then our children don't deserve innocence.
[01:22.000 --> 01:30.000]  Tamir Rice can be shot dead in a public park, playing with a toy gun, something white children do all over this country every day without the same fear of being shot.
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  If Tamir Rice can be killed, then white children need to be told at least at the same age.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  If they can't be innocent, we don't get to be innocent.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  Who is behind this cultural revolution?
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  Who is behind this Maoist style takeover?
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  From the words of David Rockefeller himself in the New York Times.
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.000]  This whole thing is a Rockefeller UN globalist experiment in China.
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  They believe it's been successful. They're taking the planet over.
[01:59.000 --> 02:06.000]  And that is the ideology. That is what this entire system is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  The President of the United States of America awards this Presidential Medal of Freedom to David Rockefeller.
[02:12.000 --> 02:20.000]  Through his extensive humanitarian efforts to promote world peace, David Rockefeller has worked to improve lives both at home and abroad.
[02:20.000 --> 02:28.000]  His creation of and support for the Tri-Lateral Commission has provided a unique forum for communication and problem solving by world leaders.
[02:28.000 --> 02:36.000]  We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine of their publications, whose directors have attended our meetings
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  and have respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years.
[02:42.000 --> 02:49.000]  It would have been impossible for us to develop our plans for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of the publicity.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  But the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march toward a world government.
[02:54.000 --> 03:04.000]  The negative impact of population growth on all of our planetary ecosystems is becoming appallingly evident.
[03:04.000 --> 03:16.000]  The United Nations can and shouldn't play an essential role in helping the world find a satisfactory way of stabilizing world population.
[03:16.000 --> 03:23.000]  It's just incredible, ladies and gentlemen. But it's okay. They're saying the leftists can demonstrate they can protest.
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  But in leftist cities, the police will arrest you if you leave your house still in many areas or don't wear a mask or social distance.
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  But if you're out ranting and raving and calling for an abolishment of local government,
[03:33.000 --> 03:41.000]  you're a wonderful angel kick because they have to overthrow government first to rebuild on it their nightmare, new world order system.
[03:41.000 --> 03:49.000]  Black Lives Matter is not just a radical idea, making sure that we limit the size, scope and scale of policing in this country.
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  Black Lives Matter! Black Lives Matter!
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  Chanting breaks out in city council today during city budget discussions.
[03:58.000 --> 04:05.000]  You don't want anybody to take a knee. It does not give our communities the resources that they actually need for mental health care,
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  for relief, for COVID, from the things that would actually keep us safe, not cops. We're calling for defunding the police.
[04:12.000 --> 04:20.000]  Now when the cops wrongfully kill somebody and they all get indicted, the whole country melts down and then everybody's guilty for what some bad cops did.
[04:20.000 --> 04:29.000]  And the left says disarm and disband all the police. Well who's going to go out and run all your leftist control systems? They're not getting rid of the police.
[04:29.000 --> 04:54.000]  The left are muscling in on the police and saying you're going to be leftist enforcers now or we're going to cut your funding. That's all this is.
[04:59.000 --> 05:05.000]  It's finally here. Introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[05:05.000 --> 05:11.000]  Listers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[05:14.000 --> 05:22.000]  Our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7000 feet below the earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[05:22.000 --> 05:30.000]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of true nascent iodine working for my body. I can personally feel the difference.
[05:30.000 --> 05:38.000]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels and healthy cognitive function.
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine today.
[05:48.000 --> 05:56.000]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 spray for 33% off at infowarstore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.
[05:56.000 --> 06:24.000]  That's infowarstore.com.
[06:24.000 --> 06:32.000]  It's June 9th, 2020. I'm David Knight, your host. I'll be here at the very beginning. Alex will be coming in later in the broadcast.
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  We'll have Steve Pachinick as well as Paul Joseph Watson.
[06:36.000 --> 06:51.000]  I want to begin by taking a look at this, I don't know, what you call it, shameful or ridiculous display that was put on by Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and these other Democrats yesterday taking the knee in Capitol Hill.
[06:51.000 --> 07:01.000]  Well, I think we've got some exclusive footage of it, don't we? Let's roll that exclusive footage of the attack on the White House and then the submission.
[07:01.000 --> 07:12.000]  Roll that footage.
[07:12.000 --> 07:24.000]  Azuka is nothing works. And then the Democrat Antifa mob here exercises some gun control by seizing the fully automatic weapon and snapping it.
[07:24.000 --> 07:34.000]  Taking the door to the Oval Office Inn.
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  You are the one they called President?
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.000]  I am.
[07:41.000 --> 07:46.000]  See you are practiced in worshipping things that fly.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  Good.
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.000]  Rise before Zod.
[07:51.000 --> 07:52.000]  Oh, she does.
[07:52.000 --> 08:02.000]  Well, now, well, during the moment of silence, I'm sure that those who have been...
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  Kneel before Zod.
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  We will now kneel for our moment of silence.
[08:08.000 --> 08:15.000]  So obedient. So obedient. There she is. They take the knee.
[08:15.000 --> 08:21.000]  You are not the President. No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  That's right. And yet they do kneel, don't they?
[08:24.000 --> 08:35.000]  But they are expecting that you will be kneeling before their policies because understand it is their policies that are at the root of what they are complaining about.
[08:35.000 --> 08:47.000]  You know, we had the family, the attorney for the family of George Floyd has now demanded that the United Nations intervene in what is going on here.
[08:47.000 --> 08:56.000]  He wants them to investigate, to intervene and to recommend what needs to be done here in America to fix all this, the United Nations.
[08:56.000 --> 09:04.000]  And one of the things that he mentioned in that was the militarization of the police and the militarized training.
[09:04.000 --> 09:12.000]  He said, we've got this heavy equipment and so forth. Does he not realize that this was put in by his Lord and Master Barack Obama?
[09:12.000 --> 09:22.000]  Do you remember the NDAA and how they snuck into that annual authorization for the Defense Authorization Act?
[09:22.000 --> 09:32.000]  They snuck in their indefinite detention by the military without due process, even being able to render you to another country where, presumably,
[09:32.000 --> 09:40.000]  you could be treated to torture and so forth by the government if they allowed that there, not being a citizen there,
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  not having any Constitutional Bill of Rights as they have worked so hard to destroy here.
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.000]  We were very concerned about that when that happened along with Republican support because, you know, hey, if they put it in there to support the military,
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  we're not going to pull anything out, right?
[09:54.000 --> 10:02.000]  We've got to give them the authorization for the military to take American citizens and hold them without due process.
[10:02.000 --> 10:12.000]  The Democrats didn't care because it was Obama and now they're complaining and using this as an effort to get more power.
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.000]  This is all this is. This is a power plate. They look like they are submitting, but they are not submitting.
[10:18.000 --> 10:26.000]  This is as phony as the cloth that they have wrapped around their necks, the kente cloth.
[10:26.000 --> 10:34.000]  And you have Democrats one after the other saying that what this is is the Democrats in blackface.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  This is political blackface, said Kira Davis.
[10:37.000 --> 10:46.000]  She said, I've never known any white person to appropriate these patterns for a very public but vague cultural statement.
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  Until today is also bizarre. To me, it was nothing more than political blackface.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  Pelosi and Schumer were donning the colors of a people and a movement that they know nothing about.
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  And I would say they care nothing about if they cared about this.
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  You would not have had the militarization of the police under Obama.
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  You would not have had the crime bill that Biden pushed.
[11:10.000 --> 11:18.000]  They would be talking about ending the war on drugs, which is the root cause of the militarization of the police.
[11:18.000 --> 11:23.000]  As I was saying this morning on the program that I have that precedes this one.
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  And again, you can track it every morning nine to noon Eastern time.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  It's live on in force.
[11:30.000 --> 11:37.000]  But as I was saying this morning, we go back and look at the history of this.
[11:37.000 --> 11:46.000]  And we look at how they have used this war on drugs to eliminate due process to do no knock SWAT team raids.
[11:46.000 --> 11:54.000]  When you go back to the Rodney King riots, it was Daryl Gates, who was a police chief in LA.
[11:54.000 --> 12:02.000]  And he was the first person to really embrace SWAT teams and armored personnel carriers and the militarization of the police.
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  And what did he do when you had a similar situation?
[12:05.000 --> 12:12.000]  You had a, you know, the Rodney King arrest and beating and the optics on it just enraged the black community.
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  They were dragging people like Reginald Denny out of his truck beating him just because he was white.
[12:19.000 --> 12:30.000]  So because of the violence that they saw of the police officers, whether or not it was justified, they were coming after white people, not even the police.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  But the police were not taking any chances.
[12:32.000 --> 12:42.000]  They used all of that militarized power not to protect businesses, not to protect neighborhoods, but to protect themselves.
[12:42.000 --> 12:49.000]  Daryl Gates circled the wagons around the city hall and the police departments.
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  They protected themselves.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  And we see the same pattern happening today.
[12:53.000 --> 13:00.000]  No matter how militarized, no matter how much power is given to the police, they will leave people to defend themselves.
[13:00.000 --> 13:20.000]  And so when we look at this shameless posturing that's being done by Pelosi and others, recognize it for what it is and understand that these reforms that they were passing out to you and telling you to defund the police.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  And we need to reform the police.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  That's the real problem.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  They don't want you to reform the police.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  They want you to get rid of the police.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  But they're not going to get rid of their policies.
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  So who is going to enforce these policies?
[13:34.000 --> 13:44.000]  As Tucker Carlson said, you're going to see the weaponization of this Black Lives Matter racist identity politics.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  You're going to see that weaponized.
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  You can already see it in terms of what is allowed with free speech.
[13:50.000 --> 13:59.000]  Anytime you say something that is against the established narrative and this goes back to COVID-19.
[13:59.000 --> 14:06.000]  If you suggest, just merely suggest that you might have hydroxychloroquine or you might have some other treatment.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  Maybe it's intravenous vitamin C.
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  Maybe it's stem cells.
[14:09.000 --> 14:16.000]  You will not be allowed to say that you will immediately be punished just as today you are immediately punished.
[14:16.000 --> 14:23.000]  If you talk about some solution to this other than jumping in on the racism crisis that they've created.
[14:23.000 --> 14:36.000]  Just as they had focused on a lockdown followed by vaccination, they've now focused on racism followed by Black Lives Matter.
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  And in the next segment, we're going to talk about the history of Black Lives Matter.
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  BLM, the M really stands.
[14:46.000 --> 14:55.000]  You could just call it Blacks Liberals and Marxists because it has had a deep basis in Marxism.
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.000]  If you go back and you look at its origins, going back to 2013, that's when we first had that term used.
[15:01.000 --> 15:07.000]  But when we look at what they're proposing, they do not want to remove the tools of oppression.
[15:07.000 --> 15:14.000]  They turn their eyes away from whenever the Democrats have enacted these structures.
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  They make it purely about politics.
[15:17.000 --> 15:27.000]  And we've got to focus on this and make sure that we don't give a pass to Republicans or to presidents who destroy our liberties as well.
[15:27.000 --> 15:35.000]  Because you understand that the things that are put in place now, whether it is surveillance in the name of tracking looters
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  or surveillance in the name of tracking people who are infected
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  or whether it is vaccines that are going to help us to get out of lockdown,
[15:43.000 --> 15:49.000]  those are going to be used against us by people that we don't like.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  Not just the people that we love.
[15:52.000 --> 16:06.000]  They may use it against us as well. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[16:23.000 --> 16:29.000]  It's the spray cap. It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo,
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  But I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  So, this is a real innovation.
[16:45.000 --> 16:50.000]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it,
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  but it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[16:52.000 --> 17:21.000]  It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[17:22.000 --> 17:29.000]  This new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.000]  from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into the ultimate spray formula.
[17:35.000 --> 17:42.000]  Iodine is an essential mineral that helps support thyroid health, healthy metabolism,
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  and healthy cognitive function.
[17:44.000 --> 17:52.000]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 Spray for 33% off-intro pricing at InfowarsStore.com.
[17:52.000 --> 18:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:24.000 --> 18:30.000]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[18:30.000 --> 18:35.000]  Folks, what we are seeing is a complete cultural revolution,
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  a complete political and economic revolution.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  You have to understand the looting of this country began with the lockdown.
[18:42.000 --> 18:51.000]  We have seen more wealth transferred from the middle class and from Main Street to the elite and to Wall Street
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.000]  than ever in history as they decided that the large companies were essential,
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  but your small business was not.
[19:00.000 --> 19:06.000]  And as I said at the very beginning, it's very much like what Mao did to eliminate any opposition.
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  He was worried that it was going to come from the middle class,
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  he destroyed the middle class with his cultural revolution with his great leap forward.
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.000]  He purged them out of the cities, took them out of their homes, put them out on the fields,
[19:17.000 --> 19:23.000]  ostensibly to raise more food, and yet you had 80 million people starved to death
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  because it was about his power.
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.000]  And let me tell you what you're seeing right now with Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer,
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  all this Black Lives Matter, they don't believe Black Lives Matter.
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  This is not about racism, this is about their political gain.
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000]  And it essentially comes down to power coming out of the barrel of the gun
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  and who is going to be holding the guns.
[19:44.000 --> 19:49.000]  They are setting up as part of this radical revolution.
[19:49.000 --> 19:54.000]  And as I said this morning on the program before this one,
[19:54.000 --> 20:00.000]  I said what we've seen here is a Blitzkrieg information war.
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  This is a lightning war.
[20:02.000 --> 20:07.000]  We've never seen this combination of firepower between the mainstream media
[20:07.000 --> 20:11.000]  owned by three or four companies, everything that you see in broadcast media,
[20:11.000 --> 20:15.000]  everything that you see in entertainment controlled by three or four companies.
[20:15.000 --> 20:19.000]  And social media, everything that you are allowed to say,
[20:19.000 --> 20:24.000]  everything that you're allowed to see in here on social media controlled by three companies.
[20:24.000 --> 20:29.000]  This kind of power, this kind of concentration of power is similar, I think,
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  to what happened at the beginning of World War II.
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  We just had on Sunday the anniversary of D-Day
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  and of course the Antifa people claimed it as their own
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.000]  and many people in the mainstream media said,
[20:42.000 --> 20:48.000]  oh look, what we had going on D-Day was the biggest Antifa rally ever.
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  No, it wasn't.
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  Antifa are looters, thieves, liars, terrorists.
[20:56.000 --> 21:01.000]  They are not the soldiers who defeated the Nazis.
[21:01.000 --> 21:08.000]  And what we have to understand is that it is not just a radical restructuring of our economy,
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  destroying the middle class, getting people accustomed to universal basic income,
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  which has been the plan for decades.
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  UN 2030 Agenda, Smart Cities, universal basic income.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  They are manipulating you.
[21:20.000 --> 21:25.000]  They did this very quickly in the same way that even though we had airplanes in the First World War,
[21:25.000 --> 21:31.000]  they did not realize the power of airplanes, the power of the Blitzkrieg, the lightning war.
[21:31.000 --> 21:38.000]  And we don't realize how powerful this new propaganda power is,
[21:38.000 --> 21:44.000]  but they have been able to radically alter society on a global scale now,
[21:44.000 --> 21:50.000]  two times within three months, with both a lockdown and now with a looting.
[21:50.000 --> 21:58.000]  And you've got people on both sides scared to death by this Blitzkrieg of information war.
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  And they're calling for more government power.
[22:01.000 --> 22:07.000]  And we have to be very careful about the solutions that they have prepared for us.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  You have one of the people in Minneapolis, as they're talking about dismantling the police department,
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  they're even on CNN, Allison Camerado's kind of, well, I'm not really too sure about what you're talking about here,
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  asked about those people who might be concerned about their personal safety.
[22:21.000 --> 22:26.000]  And the person she was talking to from the Minneapolis City Council, the president, Lisa Bender,
[22:26.000 --> 22:32.000]  and of course they were the ones, that City Council were the ones who voted to defund the police
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  and did it over the objections of the mayor.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  And so the president of the City Council was there on CNN and she said,
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  such concerns come from a place of privilege. You understand that?
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  It comes from a place of privilege.
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  People are now experiencing the reality of life for Americans, African Americans.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  This is what they always say about communists, right?
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  They have nothing and they want to share it with you.
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.000]  These people have anarchy, they have fear, they have violence,
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  and they want you to share in that with them.
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.000]  They don't want to end the fear and the violence that they have created
[23:08.000 --> 23:11.000]  in the African American communities across the country,
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  especially in the countries that are run by black Democrats,
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  places like Baltimore and Chicago.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  No, no, no, they don't want to end that fear and violence.
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  They want you to experience it.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  That's what this is really about.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  And so Alison Camarado then came back and said,
[23:28.000 --> 23:33.000]  do you understand the word dismantle or police-free also makes some people nervous?
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  For instance, what if in the middle of the night my home is broken into?
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  Who do I call?
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  Well, yeah, who do you call?
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  Who do you call when you have a riot?
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  As I said before, as we've seen in the LA riots,
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  as we've now seen across the country,
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  the people who are organized to defend themselves.
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.000]  I played a clip last week from a black Chicago woman
[23:55.000 --> 24:00.000]  who was absolutely over the top.
[24:00.000 --> 24:05.000]  We had to heavily censor the language for the broadcast,
[24:05.000 --> 24:12.000]  but she was putting out one F word after the other and one ethnic slur after the other.
[24:12.000 --> 24:23.000]  She was outraged that there were Arabs and a black person surrounding a business holding rifles.
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.000]  And she used every slur she could think of to condemn them.
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  How dare you?
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  Just get away and let people have that stuff.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  You know, you're going to kill somebody over your stuff,
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  your stuff you got from China and so forth.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  Yeah, you know, nobody did anything.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  It was a deterrent.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  And that's the point of the Second Amendment.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  I've had liberals engage me many times and I said,
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  the fundamental purpose of the Second Amendment is not to go hunting.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  It is not even about self-defense.
[24:50.000 --> 24:55.000]  It is about protecting yourself from a government that is out of control.
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.000]  Well, you can't do that.
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  They said the same things that you've heard from Eric Swalwell,
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  from Beto O'Rourke and also from Joe Biden mimicking them saying,
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  oh, we got big weapons.
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.000]  We got nuclear weapons.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  We got jets.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  We got fully automatic weapons and so forth.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  Well, you know, that hasn't really worked out well for them in the asymmetric warfare areas
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  where they have occupied Iraq.
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  They've occupied Afghanistan.
[25:17.000 --> 25:24.000]  They have been defeated over and over again after a conventional warfare that went really, really well.
[25:24.000 --> 25:30.000]  And George W. Bush says mission accomplished and then they decide they're going to do nation building
[25:30.000 --> 25:37.000]  and they get bogged down into a quagmire with people who don't really have anything like comparable weapons.
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.000]  And they've never really won one of those wars yet.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  And if they're smart, they won't do that to the American people.
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  That's what the Second Amendment is about.
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.000]  It's about mutually assured destruction, just like the Cold War was about.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  Both sides having nuclear weapons.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  Fortunately, neither side was crazy enough to use it.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  Will the Democrats be crazy enough to try to take the guns, especially in this kind of a situation?
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  Well, they may take us into that area as Tucker Carlson said yesterday.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  And he was called down on Huffington Post.
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  They were angry about the fact that Carlson said,
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  imagine if a Black Lives Matter rioters had weapons and immunity from prosecution.
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  That's what they're talking about when they talk about partisan law enforcement.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  Here's the new rule and it defines everything.
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  You are not allowed to question Black Lives Matter in any way, full stop.
[26:21.000 --> 26:28.000]  And we've seen this over and over again already in terms of the digital public square.
[26:28.000 --> 26:35.000]  I mean, just look at the examples that we've seen of this new age religion of worshiping Black Lives Matter
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  in their patron saint, George Floyd.
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  We've seen a police chief prostrate on the ground.
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.000]  We've seen other police doing foot washing.
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  We've seen these other Democrats kneeling.
[26:48.000 --> 26:55.000]  Well, we have someone else that we kneeled to and Christ is not being kneeled to by the churches.
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  That's the biggest problem.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  What are champions made of?
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  Here's a man who can show you.
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.000]  Ah!
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  tripleit 2533139
[27:41.000 --> 28:02.200]  Let's go to one in Connecticut here on the air. Thanks for holding. I sure can sir. Thank you
[28:02.200 --> 28:07.720]  Hey Alex before I start man I just wanted to talk to you bro and it's a pleasure to
[28:07.720 --> 28:11.240]  be talking right now. Sir it's an honor to talk to you brother. I'm from New
[28:11.240 --> 28:17.640]  Brink, Connecticut and I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver and two before I have changed
[28:17.640 --> 28:24.360]  the way I drive. Me and my brothers that drive. There's a couple of us. We are Hispanics, Cubans,
[28:24.360 --> 28:31.320]  Puerto Ricans. We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla and I have lost weight because I
[28:31.320 --> 28:35.800]  stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you for that man. Well brother we put more
[28:35.800 --> 28:41.160]  in this than any other long-term high quality energy powder there is. So this this was designed
[28:41.160 --> 28:44.520]  on one of the top guys in the country. He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political
[28:44.520 --> 28:48.280]  issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it and we believe
[28:48.280 --> 28:53.080]  it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life
[28:53.080 --> 28:57.160]  better so that means a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you. Aerodyne
[28:57.160 --> 29:05.320]  Technology Delivery System. The first of its kind pure nascent atomic iodine that can be delivered

[29:33.560 --> 29:38.360]  listeners idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists
[29:38.360 --> 29:42.680]  and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a
[29:42.680 --> 29:48.360]  new and in some ways even better way. Get your Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine spray now
[29:48.360 --> 29:55.720]  at 33% off at infowarstore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[29:58.600 --> 30:01.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:01.240 --> 30:22.760]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show. And now your host, David Knight.
[30:22.760 --> 30:32.440]  Welcome back. I'll be here for one more segment and then Alex Jones will be joining the program
[30:32.440 --> 30:39.320]  and taking it over. I just want to talk in this short period of time that I've got about what is
[30:39.320 --> 30:46.360]  going to happen in terms of the Democrats program. If you look at this program that was put out after
[30:46.360 --> 30:54.360]  Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats took a knee, they introduced their so-called reforms. They call it
[30:54.360 --> 31:00.360]  Justice and Police Act. And the only thing that they talked about that is an actual reform
[31:01.240 --> 31:07.080]  is to reform qualified immunity, which is something that Supreme Court imposed in 1982
[31:07.080 --> 31:12.200]  unilaterally as they do so many things out of the Supreme Court. But the rest of this stuff is
[31:12.200 --> 31:19.560]  basically racial based. You have racial stats and quotas are going to be kept on everything
[31:19.560 --> 31:27.000]  that the police do. You're going to have training about racial bias. They're going to make lynching
[31:27.000 --> 31:33.960]  a federal crime. Now, do we have a lot of lynchings that are going on? But see, lynching is a dog
[31:33.960 --> 31:42.200]  whistle again for race. So it's all about race, except it's not about race. It's about government
[31:42.200 --> 31:47.000]  and about mismanagement of the Democrats. And also the one other thing that they're doing here is
[31:47.000 --> 31:52.520]  change the use of force and other standards from a federal level. You understand that this is a
[31:52.520 --> 31:57.880]  federal takeover of local policing, which is the last thing that we want. I mean, that is even more
[31:57.880 --> 32:02.360]  dangerous than defunding the police at a local level. I mean, if you defund the police in one town
[32:02.360 --> 32:08.920]  and it doesn't work out, that doesn't affect the other towns. But if you change policing from the
[32:08.920 --> 32:14.120]  federal level, this is why for the longest time the John Birch Society has talked about supporting
[32:14.120 --> 32:20.440]  your local police, your local sheriff, whatever. And that's really what I do support. The sheriffs
[32:20.440 --> 32:27.000]  are elected. We didn't have any police in the United States until 1828. And we didn't have much of
[32:27.000 --> 32:34.440]  it very widespread until the 20th century. Institutions change. And we need to understand
[32:34.440 --> 32:41.240]  that they can change for the better or for the worse. We have, as Frank Serpico pointed out,
[32:42.360 --> 32:47.320]  you have bad actors that are going to be in any human institution. The key thing that has to be
[32:47.320 --> 32:53.880]  done is those bad actors have to be purged. And if you don't purge those bad actors, then that
[32:53.880 --> 33:00.280]  corrupts the institution itself. What we have seen and the core problem in most of these police
[33:00.280 --> 33:05.720]  departments is that when you have a bad actor, even if the police chief or the sheriff or the mayor
[33:06.440 --> 33:12.600]  wants to get that person out, the police union stops that. The immunity means that they have
[33:12.600 --> 33:16.200]  no responsibility for what they're doing. And as I pointed out this morning, when we look at
[33:17.400 --> 33:21.160]  people and individuals and institutions and businesses that are given legal immunity,
[33:21.160 --> 33:27.720]  that is an incentive to corruption. Just take a look at the immunity that's been given to the
[33:27.720 --> 33:34.280]  vaccine companies. We don't want that at any level. It is a corrupting factor here. But we
[33:34.280 --> 33:38.840]  especially do not want the federal government controlling law enforcement. That should be
[33:38.840 --> 33:45.960]  done locally. When you look at what happens with these riots, what happened in LA when Daryl Gates
[33:45.960 --> 33:49.880]  refused to use his militarized police department to protect people. And now we've seen this again.
[33:49.880 --> 33:57.240]  What happened was the power of the community. People got together and protected their neighborhood
[33:57.240 --> 34:01.080]  or they protected their business because the police were not doing that. So one of the reasons why
[34:01.080 --> 34:07.720]  Sturm and Ruger have gained 17.5% in just one month because so many people are buying guns.
[34:07.720 --> 34:14.040]  But not the liberals. Tom Arnold says that liberals should borrow our dad's hunting rifles.
[34:14.040 --> 34:20.920]  Yeah, I guess, is Tom Arnold still living in his mom and dad's house? Is he living in the
[34:20.920 --> 34:26.600]  basement or something? Second amendment is for everybody, he says. Oh, really? It is.
[34:27.400 --> 34:32.200]  Well, I've never seen a liberal say that. Then he goes, but it's effing time for us white liberal
[34:32.200 --> 34:37.240]  men to stand up for our brothers and sisters. We need to borrow our dad's hunting rifles
[34:37.240 --> 34:44.760]  and go nose to nose with Trump's gang of misfit tools. Okay, okay, there you go. That's his idea.
[34:45.960 --> 34:49.640]  Because that's really what they're trying to do. They're trying to start a race war.
[34:50.680 --> 34:57.240]  And that's what he's pushing on social media. The problem is, is that when we have, as we've seen
[34:57.240 --> 35:04.280]  many police officers in this lockdown, say, and police chiefs say, I'm not going to enforce these
[35:04.280 --> 35:08.840]  laws. They are unconstitutional. They can tell me to do it, but I'm not going to cite anybody.
[35:08.840 --> 35:13.400]  I'm not going to shut down any businesses. And you've seen police officers who've taken
[35:13.400 --> 35:19.320]  to social media and many of them have been fired. We just had a police chief forced to resign
[35:19.320 --> 35:25.720]  after he supported citizens who armed themselves during a riot. So these people who are talking
[35:25.720 --> 35:31.960]  about the abuse of power still want to have power concentrated in their hands, just like Chairman
[35:31.960 --> 35:35.880]  Mao. And that is why they're destroying the middle class. That's why they're pushing this.
[35:35.880 --> 35:40.440]  They do not want to have reform. Let me give you another example of this. Who will replace the
[35:40.440 --> 35:47.160]  police? Well, Daily Mail talks about what black lives matter and MPD 150 and other activists
[35:47.160 --> 35:52.120]  are saying they want to see happen. Here's some examples. Well, you know, we got this a problem
[35:52.120 --> 35:59.560]  now, but I think we'll solve that by having more homeless shelters or maybe what we will do is
[35:59.560 --> 36:07.400]  we'll legalize marijuana. Well, that hasn't stopped crime in California, has it? And locking
[36:07.400 --> 36:16.360]  people up for that. Look, Eric Garner was choked to death because he was selling cigarettes as
[36:16.360 --> 36:22.920]  individual cigarettes. They called them Lucy's. Why did he do that? He did that because tobacco
[36:22.920 --> 36:28.360]  is so heavily taxed in New York that it makes it profitable for people to buy the cigarettes
[36:28.360 --> 36:34.120]  in another state, bring them in and sell them as individual cigarettes. And so that was a minor
[36:34.120 --> 36:41.160]  infraction and it was an overreaction to say the least of the police to choke him to death
[36:42.280 --> 36:47.160]  for violation of a minor infraction. But understand that legalizing marijuana isn't
[36:47.160 --> 36:52.840]  going to do it. Tobacco is legal, but you can tax it so much that you create a black market for it
[36:52.840 --> 36:58.520]  and then you send out police or maybe even community organizers with a badge. You'll
[36:58.520 --> 37:04.600]  eventually when push comes to shove, wind up choking or shooting or using non-lethal force
[37:04.600 --> 37:09.480]  in a way that is lethal. They say better handling of drug offenses to stop the criminalizing of
[37:09.480 --> 37:16.280]  communities of color, nowhere, nowhere to the Democrats or the even black lives matter, even
[37:16.280 --> 37:21.560]  black lives matter. Nowhere do these people talk about ending the war on drugs. The war on drugs
[37:21.560 --> 37:27.080]  has been the core of police corruption, of the abuse of power, of the militarization of the police,
[37:27.080 --> 37:36.760]  of creating a lucrative black market monopoly between these drug gangs. It has caused black
[37:36.760 --> 37:41.880]  people to be locked up with Biden's crime bill with the mandatory minimum at a rate higher than
[37:41.880 --> 37:47.560]  any society has ever locked people up, but they're not looking at any of these problems to solve.
[37:47.560 --> 37:55.480]  They're looking to use this as racism. Today I talked about in great detail the and I don't have
[37:55.480 --> 38:01.480]  enough time to talk about it, but I was sent by Mark Hall who I've interviewed numerous times
[38:02.520 --> 38:10.760]  about his documentary, Killing Ed, where he talks about charter schools and how you have
[38:11.400 --> 38:14.680]  some corporations and the worst case is the Fatala Ghoulin organization
[38:14.680 --> 38:23.000]  that is operating in every other country as Islamic madrasas, getting massive amounts of money,
[38:23.960 --> 38:32.600]  about 750 million dollars the last time I saw the figures on it, but that was a worst case
[38:32.600 --> 38:39.400]  example, but he has lived in Germany and he sent me a picture going back to 1932, 33, the KPD
[38:39.400 --> 38:44.760]  and the flag, if you can zoom in on the desk here and you can see this, now it's not this is
[38:44.760 --> 38:53.240]  black and white print, but the flag is actually the same color antifascista action and the flag
[38:53.240 --> 39:01.880]  is exactly like the antifa flag. This is a long-term communist group and as I mentioned
[39:01.880 --> 39:09.400]  today I went down the list of people and organizations that are behind this, they are communist
[39:09.400 --> 39:15.480]  organizations, they have been funded by people who are socialists and communists, they pulled together
[39:16.520 --> 39:23.880]  the race war, going back to the weather underground, Bill Ayers, he went into education
[39:24.760 --> 39:29.240]  because he wanted to push white privilege, they called it white skin privilege, when he stopped
[39:29.240 --> 39:34.680]  bombing buildings, when he stopped killing police officers, he decided that he would
[39:34.680 --> 39:39.480]  bomb your children's minds and now what we have seen through common core and the federalization
[39:39.480 --> 39:46.280]  of education, we've now seen thoroughly radicalized youth pushing the agenda of these marxist
[39:46.280 --> 39:51.000]  organizations using a race war because they couldn't do it with a class war, using a race war
[39:51.560 --> 39:56.840]  to overthrow American society and reset it to their dystopia. It's finally here, introducing

[41:16.120 --> 41:21.960]  well I can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger
[41:21.960 --> 41:28.200]  race war, it's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it,
[41:28.200 --> 41:33.800]  the globalists are attacking on every front, that's why now more than ever we have to realize
[41:33.800 --> 41:39.320]  they tried to censor info wars off the air because they knew that when they watched this whole situation

[42:59.800 --> 43:05.400]  populist movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries that's why the new world order
[43:05.400 --> 43:11.320]  is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing
[43:11.320 --> 43:18.360]  your local police and government and destroying essential services this is an attempt to have
[43:18.360 --> 43:23.240]  society collapse and the globalists as they've done in the third world will come in and pick up
[43:23.240 --> 43:29.240]  the pieces you must stand against the UN the IMF the world bank and the EU openly saying
[43:29.240 --> 43:33.800]  they fund the police the police have a lot of problems we all have a lot of problems but this
[43:33.800 --> 43:37.880]  is our government and our local vocabulary and believe me once the globalists have overthrown
[43:37.880 --> 43:42.680]  this country they are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or
[43:42.680 --> 43:47.880]  freedom the globalists believe communist china is the model of the world and they are orchestrating
[43:47.880 --> 43:53.560]  this entire thing the people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed
[43:53.560 --> 43:55.080]  info wars dot com
[43:55.080 --> 44:02.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[44:13.320 --> 44:19.960]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[44:19.960 --> 44:33.080]  front lines of the info war
[44:50.200 --> 45:01.880]  there are now over 50 metropolitan police officers that have been injured some of them
[45:01.880 --> 45:11.880]  seriously and yet my argument here isn't against equality of opportunity it's not to say there may
[45:11.880 --> 45:17.240]  not still be things in society that aren't perfectly fair but it is to say this and to say it very
[45:17.240 --> 45:25.240]  very clearly this black lives matter movement is a dangerous marxist organization help them
[45:25.240 --> 45:31.720]  on anarchy and we need to wake up get some facts into our heads and understand what it is we're
[45:31.720 --> 45:40.520]  fighting the main agenda of the black lives movement and black lives matters is the defunding
[45:40.520 --> 45:46.920]  of the police force that's right they want to effectively close down the established police force
[45:46.920 --> 45:52.280]  in the united states of america and that's what the key activists in this country wanted it as
[45:52.280 --> 46:01.400]  well they're aiming at a radical redistribution of wealth they're hinting at assets being taken
[46:01.400 --> 46:06.360]  from private companies and put in put into the hands of workers i mean look this is a little
[46:06.360 --> 46:16.120]  bit like you know the 1917 Lenin manifesto which saw the communist revolution and that's exactly
[46:16.120 --> 46:22.600]  what this is and everybody's sitting here flat-footed laughing at the left because you see what
[46:22.600 --> 46:34.120]  clowns the minions are but it's not clowns on top of it it is the most powerful wealthy rich people
[46:34.120 --> 46:40.120]  on the planet that are ruthless and cold-blooded and know that we have a heart and know that we care
[46:40.120 --> 46:49.400]  so they use our altruistic nature as weakness and are totally dominating society if you want to rebel
[46:50.600 --> 46:57.720]  against the man and against the system that it's the multinational mega corporations that have set
[46:57.720 --> 47:06.440]  that have set china up as the model of planetary control and it is absolute pure unadulterated
[47:06.440 --> 47:14.520]  complete evil on its face so yes you see the throngs and the masses
[47:17.320 --> 47:19.880]  that they have brainwashed out there as cannon fodder
[47:19.880 --> 47:26.440]  and you have to understand that as they domesticate more people
[47:29.320 --> 47:34.280]  it's only going to get worse and that this is true organized corruption so here's what
[47:34.280 --> 47:40.440]  i want to do today i want to open the phones up for the balance of the next three hours
[47:40.440 --> 47:50.200]  and i want to take your phone calls on the subjects of what's unfolding in the world
[47:53.240 --> 47:59.160]  we are going to attempt as good as we can to break down and lay out
[48:02.360 --> 48:05.400]  exactly what's happening and exactly what's unfolding and i have to tell you
[48:05.400 --> 48:15.800]  when you sit there and you try as best you can to watch and to listen
[48:18.200 --> 48:25.000]  to all the things the left are up to and to see the media misrepresent everything they engage in
[48:25.640 --> 48:29.560]  this is a pure conversion over to evil that has happened with the average leftist
[48:29.560 --> 48:35.800]  there are video after video after video where they throw themselves on the hoods of people's cars
[48:36.680 --> 48:42.120]  and act like they fall down and act like that they've been attacked and the media says oh look
[48:42.120 --> 48:48.120]  someone tried to ram them down and kill them all trying to repeat charlottesville over and over again
[48:48.920 --> 48:57.480]  so it's like a big satanic drama club of victimology control freaks over and over and over again
[48:57.480 --> 49:04.280]  repeating the same garbage and i've experienced it where they come up to your table they say
[49:04.280 --> 49:08.360]  we're going to kill you we hate you and they're waiting at the exit and then they shoot video
[49:08.360 --> 49:14.680]  and you yell back at them and say alex jones came to my table and harass me or they burn down
[49:14.680 --> 49:20.200]  homeless people stuff in downtown austin and then just say we did it and the news runs with it
[49:21.320 --> 49:26.920]  and it's that coupling of mainstream media with these criminal mobs that is so incredibly dangerous
[49:26.920 --> 49:33.160]  and the united states is not the former soviet union it is not communist china it has a different
[49:33.160 --> 49:39.160]  history and it's going to be explosive what unfolds in this nation i've got articles here we're out
[49:39.160 --> 49:45.080]  in california suburbs are defending themselves from armed mobs just peacefully standing in front
[49:45.080 --> 49:50.280]  of their businesses and the media is calling them terrorist and vigilantes because they don't let
[49:50.280 --> 49:55.400]  groups of white methods dressed in black come and burn down their businesses it's just simply
[49:55.400 --> 50:03.240]  insane we also have big developments here in just a moment that we're going to play for you
[50:03.960 --> 50:11.400]  dealing with an exciting new announcement but prince andrew won't be extradited to the us

[50:17.560 --> 50:33.240]  with prince andrew in eppstein attorney now we are also going to look at the whole ongoing
[50:33.240 --> 50:39.320]  covet hoax that we told you four months ago we'll never go away and we'll never stop the eu the un
[50:39.320 --> 50:44.920]  and spain are announcing it's never going to end you're never going to not wear a mask you're never

[50:55.640 --> 51:00.440]  and now it's here i made a film 13 years ago called in game it has everything in it because
[51:00.440 --> 51:06.360]  they said they do it it is a dystopia it is not about your safety and covet 19's a hoax the death
[51:06.360 --> 51:11.720]  numbers are a hoax all of it's a fraud but they can always have their false test and count anybody
[51:11.720 --> 51:16.600]  that dies of car wrecks gunshot wounds you name it saying they test positive for covet it's all a
[51:16.600 --> 51:22.840]  fraud to leverage up the deaths and then bring back the deaths and sit there and idle it up idle it
[51:22.840 --> 51:28.520]  down rev it up rev it down this is the medical tyranny of billa melinda gates of the new world
[51:28.520 --> 51:35.160]  order we are now inside of it we are now absolutely inside of this medical tyranny but we can break
[51:35.160 --> 51:42.360]  out if we admit it oh it's now in the news that the amazon and the apple and the google
[51:44.040 --> 51:49.880]  home assistants will now bark black lives matter orders at you see last week it was takeover spotify
[51:49.880 --> 51:56.200]  and take over apple and take over everything and tell you that white people are bad take over your
[51:56.200 --> 52:02.440]  devices now they're just going to sharp shout orders at you while they listen to you and why not
[52:02.440 --> 52:07.000]  you took devices into your house that are hooked into mega corporations that listen to you
[52:09.320 --> 52:12.120]  you let pedophiles come and teach your children in public school
[52:13.320 --> 52:18.680]  and so they think it's a green light to take everything you've got i've got everybody's got
[52:19.400 --> 52:23.720]  i'm gonna start the next hour get to all this news and take your phone calls
[52:23.720 --> 52:27.560]  throughout the rest of the transmission today really appreciate the crew and i appreciate all
[52:27.560 --> 52:31.640]  the radio stations tv stations and david night sitting in the first 45 minutes i had to be in
[52:31.640 --> 52:37.480]  family court yesterday that's why i missed the first hour and then today i had uh an extraction
[52:37.480 --> 52:41.960]  of a broken tooth set up months ago covid-19 shut that down it took longer than to get to me
[52:41.960 --> 52:45.560]  so they pulled this molar that's been done we're going to go to break here's the big announcement
[52:46.520 --> 52:53.320]  the reason you should buy our new atomic iodine spray is because atomic iodine is so incredibly
[52:53.320 --> 52:59.080]  good for your body and because almost no one else is on the market selling true atomic iodine
[52:59.080 --> 53:04.680]  now it's listeners that started about four months ago begging for us to put a spray bottle
[53:04.680 --> 53:09.960]  on our x2 iodine so we looked into it and the formula we have is not best delivered through
[53:09.960 --> 53:14.520]  a spray bottle it's went to scientists and developers and they said actually it's another
[53:14.520 --> 53:19.160]  great way to aerosolize it and deliver it into the body to reformulate it with this particular
[53:19.160 --> 53:23.880]  type of glycerin and this type of spray bottle but the real reason i went ahead and decided
[53:23.880 --> 53:28.760]  to develop this is i don't like having to take the bottle of x2 around with me that's got the
[53:28.760 --> 53:34.440]  dropper that's good for at home in my medicine cabinet and in my kitchen but then i tend to forget
[53:34.440 --> 53:40.520]  when i'm on the road or i'm on a business trip or vacation to take it with me and the spray bottle
[53:40.520 --> 53:46.280]  is really a refreshing way to do it it also soothes my throat and my larynx i obviously talk a lot
[53:46.280 --> 53:51.560]  and so once we got in some of the test bottles a few months ago i was blown away and i'm now
[53:51.560 --> 53:57.640]  personally hooked on it and this is the way i like to take my x2 so it's proprietary it just came
[53:57.640 --> 54:04.040]  in it's 33 off it's amazing and if you don't know what iodine is and why it's so important the
[54:04.040 --> 54:09.480]  soils are depleted most the food is depleted most the other types of iodine that are out there are
[54:09.480 --> 54:15.960]  bound to other substances and the body has trouble absorbing them that's not the case with our nascent
[54:15.960 --> 54:21.960]  iodine system it's atomic it's pure it's very very clean and what it does for your thyroid the rest
[54:21.960 --> 54:29.480]  of your body is quote essential iodine is essential like oxygen like water you have to have it and one
[54:29.480 --> 54:35.000]  of the best ways to get it is the original x2 or now x2 in the spray bottle i would take advantage
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.400]  of this right now i'm very excited about it by having it in the car i don't forget to take it
[54:39.400 --> 54:43.320]  and again we're discounting it out of the gates at 33 off and at forestore.com
[54:43.320 --> 54:54.440]  it's finally here introducing the new survival shield x2 spray available now for 33 off at

[55:46.520 --> 55:51.640]  the panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms
[55:51.640 --> 55:58.200]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're already into the worldwide depression
[55:58.200 --> 56:03.800]  in the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown
[56:03.800 --> 56:10.520]  persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's
[56:10.520 --> 56:15.000]  been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always said it's important to be a prepper
[56:15.000 --> 56:20.120]  and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that
[56:20.120 --> 56:26.840]  we're under their control they've admitted all of this so remember how does info wars continue
[56:26.840 --> 56:32.440]  years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen because we're
[56:32.440 --> 56:37.400]  following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's dystopic and yes it's
[56:37.400 --> 56:42.760]  scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary it's time
[56:42.760 --> 56:51.560]  to stop the denial and realize what's really happening you're listening to the alex jones show
[56:51.560 --> 57:07.640]  i am so angry about what's going on inside the new world order that i can barely contain myself
[57:07.640 --> 57:13.000]  and do these broadcasts anymore i knew about the new world order i knew about the globalist i knew
[57:13.000 --> 57:19.640]  about their plans really like nobody else does other than the people that running but it's another
[57:19.640 --> 57:24.840]  thing to actually see them launching it and and and really letting us know they're going into the
[57:24.840 --> 57:30.120]  depths of it and i was doing some research last night and i'll cover this at the bottom of the hour
[57:32.200 --> 57:39.160]  into 7277 state department random 7277 and then public law that came out of it it is the law of
[57:39.160 --> 57:47.640]  the united states was passed into law as state department policy and it calls for the total
[57:47.640 --> 57:55.560]  disarmament of the american people and just now folks are starting to pay attention to it last
[57:55.560 --> 58:01.480]  night i text messaged folks that i know that have worked for the cia and the fbi and other places a
[58:01.480 --> 58:08.760]  couple different people and they said i've never seen 7277 and i said look at this i said i'm a
[58:08.760 --> 58:17.000]  cia.gov link talking about it and if one thing got kennedy killed it was this you know i don't
[58:17.000 --> 58:21.640]  think kennedy overall was a bad guy but he was really buying into this world government business
[58:21.640 --> 58:28.680]  and he did buy into the gun confiscation plan and it got him killed it was the last straw when they
[58:28.680 --> 58:37.560]  finally said he's dead and a lot of people that meant well were involved in killing kennedy but
[58:37.560 --> 58:42.200]  then it was an even more evil globalist group that was behind trying to get kennedy to the gun
[58:42.200 --> 58:47.960]  confiscation that was opening up china had this new order plan that he was actually opposing
[58:47.960 --> 58:53.000]  so that's why this gets so sophisticated and so so complex we would have been a lot better off if
[58:53.000 --> 58:56.840]  they hadn't killed kennedy because they would have tried this gun confiscation out in the open and
[58:56.840 --> 59:02.280]  the un's going to take over and it's a good thing and kennedy was believing all this but right at
[59:02.280 --> 59:07.880]  the end he tried to abolish the fellow reserve for to pull us out of vietnam he was smoking the
[59:07.880 --> 59:12.360]  peacenik dope that was only one wing of the new order he didn't have full spectrum analysis
[59:13.160 --> 59:19.160]  and neither does trump and i don't say that from a position of i'm so smart you know the average
[59:19.160 --> 59:24.120]  high-level politician does understand this they've been picked and chosen because they're compartmentalized
[59:24.120 --> 59:30.520]  trump came in from the outside from entertainment and from the service industry and was able to get
[59:30.520 --> 59:38.360]  in by riding a populous wave that steve bannon and steven miller brought to him as his operating
[59:38.360 --> 59:43.080]  system and he trump was familiar with it because his father and because of roi cone and the jaron
[59:43.080 --> 59:49.160]  burt society and identified with it but but it wasn't trump's main operating system now he's
[59:49.160 --> 59:54.600]  been further uh inducted into understanding of the deep state by having it write a barbecue
[59:54.600 --> 1:00:00.520]  and electrocute his arts so we come back we'll talk about what david night points out uh
[1:00:01.960 --> 1:00:06.040]  george floyd is now the patron saint we can rewind that and show that when we come back
[1:00:06.040 --> 1:00:12.680]  he's now the patron saint of the takeover of the police because this is not abolish the police this
[1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:19.480]  is intimidate come in with federal and globalist money uh this is uh operation strong cities
[1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:25.400]  the guys print me something on strong cities loretta lynch wants un to oversee police departments
[1:00:25.400 --> 1:00:33.080]  right bart in four wars ap that's what this is and just as it was in 1963 it is today
[1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:40.840]  there's george floyd the patron saint of the left how many days of funerals how many days of
[1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:46.280]  absolutely just knowing that it touched our hearts seeing and begging for his life
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:51.320]  and so now since our hearts touched we're all guilty we're all bad and we have to kneel
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:57.640]  we have to kneel to sort them get to kneel to lucifer we have to bow to the new world order
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:05.560]  but it's gone too far with white democrats rest up in kwansa outfits stumbling around in the congressional
[1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:15.720]  rotunda that is all coming up absolutely jam-packed transmission and again i uh wild horses couldn't
[1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:22.200]  drag me away i'm in a good spot right now my mouth still numb having a molar that has been cracked
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:30.760]  and rotting for many years finally removed my wife will be happy is that bugger did not have a good
[1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:37.080]  smell to it even if i brush my teeth five times a day the circle is now complete when we return
[1:01:37.080 --> 1:01:43.960]  we're gonna launch into all of it and take your phone calls i'm alex jones remember the only
[1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:49.320]  way we reach new people is when you decide to override the sensors and spread the links to news wars
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:55.800]  dot com forward slash show info wars dot com forward slash show i've hunted a lot of big game
[1:01:55.800 --> 1:02:03.000]  at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an l could say 600 yards even if you
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:09.960]  hit them right in the heart they'll still run 50 60 70 maybe 100 yards they've got that adrenaline
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:14.680]  pumping through their arteries and through their veins but all of a sudden they slow down
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:21.400]  they realize what's happened they fall over and they die then you go bag them and haul them back
[1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:27.400]  in well that's what's going to happen to the entire world now and that's what the economic numbers
[1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:34.040]  show is that we've been shot right in the heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long
[1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:38.680]  horrible depression and a lot of death well for the third world it's going to mean probably over
[1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:43.560]  100 million dead according to you and i believe their numbers because it's the very un that's
[1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:47.880]  orchestrated this to depopulate the third world so that all the leftists had thought it was their
[1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:51.560]  revolution to get rid of trump you're a bunch of suckers and you've bought into something
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:03:11.560]  better than what hitler did
[1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:15.400]  live from austin texas it's alex jones
[1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:21.000]  all right i want to open the phones up throughout the rest of the transmission as we enter the
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:25.880]  second hour i want to cover a ton of news from around the world and really try to bring folks
[1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:33.240]  up to speed as best i can and what we're really facing but what i want to do today is i want to
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:43.800]  open the phones up for leftists who've woken up to tell their stories people that were in
[1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:49.560]  antifa people that were in the communist party people that were in black lives matter to call in
[1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:57.160]  and tell us your story of what you witnessed and what you saw also want to open the phones up
[1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:07.160]  for leftists that really do think trumps bad and really do think that abolishing the police
[1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:16.520]  is a good idea and who really think that the democrats and the globalists have your best
[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:23.960]  interest in heart i'd love to respectfully hear from you if you seriously disagree and there's
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:31.720]  a third group i'd like to hear from people who have been helped by police and i'd like to hear
[1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:39.960]  from people who've been wronged by police and i personally was wronged by police growing up in
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:50.040]  dalis i was not a big drug user and i knew that police were dealing the drugs in rock wall county
[1:04:50.040 --> 1:04:53.800]  where i live they later busted the sheriff dealing drugs they later busted a bunch of the police
[1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:57.880]  department dealing drugs texas monthly heard me talk about that when research and found out was all
[1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:05.000]  true and they would pull me over with my friends when i was 13 14 15 i had older friends who were
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:10.120]  driving a lot of times girlfriends and they'd search the car and find a six pack occurs and
[1:05:10.680 --> 1:05:17.320]  take us to juvenile and i'd be like man i saw you three years ago deliver ecstasy and marijuana
[1:05:17.320 --> 1:05:22.840]  to that pool party because i lived in a wealthy area you know mic mansions and mansions and swimming
[1:05:22.840 --> 1:05:28.120]  pools and i'd see my friends moms getting drugs delivered to them i'd be at a party where the
[1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:32.760]  high school kids were there college kids and then i mean sometimes they'd pull up cops in
[1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:36.920]  their private truck but they'd be in uniform with a jacket on or hand them a bag of drugs
[1:05:37.640 --> 1:05:42.040]  so when the very cop that's a drug dealer is taking me to jail i'm like hey buddy i saw you
[1:05:42.040 --> 1:05:48.280]  deliver drugs that's when they flipped out threatened to kill me a couple years into it they
[1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:54.360]  told my dad through through our lawyer they said that you need to move out of here or your son's
[1:05:54.360 --> 1:05:59.640]  gonna end up being hung dead in the jail so are there bad police departments you better believe
[1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:06.200]  there are and can police be oppressive and do bad things you bet come the courts do it it's our
[1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:11.880]  system though and you look at the other systems they're even worse and it's all about the character
[1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:18.440]  of the people and how we stand up and what we say no to the tsa is a total hoax islamics
[1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:23.720]  attackers the borders are wide open but they're gonna grope your genitals don't blame the average
[1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:29.960]  tsa agent if you only do civil disobedience and you know opt out that's great but don't don't
[1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:39.160]  say they're the problem we let congress do this we need to change the law just like we need vaccine
[1:06:39.160 --> 1:06:43.160]  liability vaccine damage liability where they can hurt you with the vaccines or kill you with your
[1:06:43.160 --> 1:06:48.280]  family and then its secret court if you can jump through a hundred hoops you get paid a paltry sum
[1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:53.560]  average is about a hundred thousand dollars for people that die your kid dies you get a hundred
[1:06:53.560 --> 1:07:02.840]  grand wow you get paralyzed you get a hundred grand so there's a lot of things we need to change but
[1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:07.480]  us just killing each other because we're black and we're white or because it's a cops he's wrong
[1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:13.240]  and i gotta tell you prom's been going back up because with all the trayvon martin justice
[1:07:13.240 --> 1:07:17.720]  department financed garbage to create a race war for the last six seven eight years the police are
[1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:25.080]  slow rolling into black communities and that is causing people to be fed on by criminals that know
[1:07:25.080 --> 1:07:30.200]  that they can't get in trouble and i'll just say it george floyd was in security a lot of people
[1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:34.680]  at nightclubs or drug dealers we all know security usually deals with drugs in a place it's corrupt
[1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:39.640]  he drops a baggie out of his pants when he's in the surveillance video he had enough fentanyl
[1:07:39.640 --> 1:07:47.160]  to kill two grown men in him but he's now the patron saint it actually got a you know funeral
[1:07:47.160 --> 1:07:54.520]  going on with him as a as a saint as an angel uh with wings ladies and gentlemen maybe we can
[1:07:54.520 --> 1:08:02.760]  back that up five minutes and show the viewers but this is ridiculous i'm sad he's dead but a
[1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:09.960]  christlike figure he is not and i'm not taken on the guilt of the police officers that have all
[1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:17.080]  been indicted what is it five of them that were there i didn't do that and i'm not going to take
[1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:23.240]  on some guilt because of what color i am that is cult brainwashing that is the essence of being in
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:29.640]  a cult and now black lives matter is coming out saying if your family isn't for black lives matter
[1:08:29.640 --> 1:08:35.320]  and that means the george soros planned parenthood uh break up the traditional family abort black
[1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:41.240]  babies adopt a marchesland in his worldview they just use black people as a shield as a cover
[1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:45.560]  as a sales point oh you're guilty about black people being mistreated sometimes well you just
[1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:52.680]  better do whatever the new old order says that's all this is and now there he is up there as the
[1:08:52.680 --> 1:09:01.640]  patron saint george floyd think about that and and think about are you going to take this guilt on
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:07.160]  i mean here's an example there is ten to one black on white crime in this country by every
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:12.520]  crime statistic there is we'll pull up this article instagram sensors fbi crime stats graph
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:24.440]  as hbc this is the fbi's own numbers and if you look at the white's killed by blacks it's 9.63
[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:31.480]  blacks killed by whites at 0.77 or more than 10 times more likely for blacks to kill whites
[1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:41.240]  blacks killed by blacks is 53.94 compared to blacks killed by white 0.77 so where's the problem
[1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:45.720]  the left destroyed the black community they've delegitimize they've broken up the families
[1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:49.960]  they've shipped drugs into it welfare this is their plan for everybody they admit
[1:09:50.520 --> 1:10:00.840]  is total domestication and enslavement look at these numbers white on black 9 59,778 59,000
[1:10:00.840 --> 1:10:08.840]  versus 547,000 black on white attacks this is what they arrest you for in europe in germany
[1:10:08.840 --> 1:10:16.680]  or sweden if you show statistics that are exactly the same there except it's muslim against white
[1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:25.560]  when you pull up these numbers there they will arrest you if you even say the race of someone
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:31.000]  that attacked somebody unless they're white so this is what the left's covered up they brought in
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:36.920]  groups taught them to hate the country they're in and taught them that whiteness is inherently
[1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:42.040]  bad and then tell whites you're guilty for these cherry-picked events that we blow up
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:49.720]  mountains out of molehills and then we say you're all guilty that's a cult look at these headlines
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:58.200]  new york times columnist demands white people ditch family members who don't support black
[1:10:58.200 --> 1:11:04.280]  lives matter well i thought Scientology's bad when they tell family members that don't support
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:09.400]  it you're supposed to ditch it but the real culture folks is the democratic party everything they do
[1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:13.880]  is cult-like we're going to go to break we're going to come back and show you the democrats
[1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:19.960]  bowling again this time house members wearing quons the outfits there's no end to the virtue
[1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:27.640]  signaling but with trump he doubled more than doubled funding for black colleges and specifically
[1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:34.680]  earmarked a hundred billion dollars in tax breaks for corporations to relocate in predominantly black
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:42.440]  areas and even put earmarks on it that it was supposed to go to minorities to have those jobs
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:48.840]  i almost think that's discriminatory but if you want to firehose jobs and infrastructure at people
[1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:56.600]  instead of just checks to go buy democrat drugs with then that's what you do because the democrats
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:12:01.800]  when you're on skid row in austin or skid row in la you go down there there's an open-air drug market
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:06.840]  disgusting drug doubt prostitutes on fentanyl and they all get their paycheck there's local
[1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:10.760]  leptis groups that sign them up for other welfare they can get and the leptis groups take about a
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:15.080]  third of the money on average and they'll be getting a hundred thousand dollars two hundred
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:19.240]  thousand dollars a year there's somebody that's got a disability and that person is in a wheelchair
[1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:24.280]  on fentanyl doesn't know what planet they're on and the local leptis groups will be in three-story
[1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:29.640]  five-story buildings all around downtown right there milking them like they're a cow they go sign
[1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:33.800]  them up they make sure they stay on the fentanyl of the drugs and then and then those local community
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:41.240]  groups milk the homeless drug addict and that's all this is a milking operation and then to distract
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:45.720]  what the democrats are doing oh look a cop in a democrat city trying to do choke holds by the
[1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:50.440]  democrats let's let's make it all about white people and republicans everywhere let's all make
[1:12:50.440 --> 1:12:55.720]  it their fault the united states is not communist china we don't have three million people in
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:13:01.480]  concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents and sell their
[1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:07.800]  organs but all over the news we see the u.n. billable indicates w.a.h.o. mainstream corporate
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:13.960]  media praising communist china for their response and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints
[1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:18.680]  and weld people into their houses and has robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:23.880]  that and on top of it cities like san Antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:29.880]  virus well now qualmo in new york's calling it the european virus these people are out of control
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:34.760]  control freaks and they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their
[1:13:34.760 --> 1:13:40.680]  criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab the resistance lives at bandot video
[1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:46.280]  and info wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the censors throats and then we'll be able
[1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:55.640]  to defeat their operation that much quicker aerodyne technology delivery system the first of its kind
[1:13:55.640 --> 1:14:02.360]  pure nascent atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle the next level of innovation
[1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:09.240]  of x2 is here introducing survival shield x2 spray the great part about the x2 spray is it's great
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:13.720]  on the go when you've got it in the dropper it's great at your house it's you know great at work
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:19.240]  but this is great for the car it's great to keep with you and again it's also good for the throat
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:24.360]  and mouth to get the effects of iodine not to just ingest it into the stomach we're really excited
[1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:30.120]  about it it's 33 off out of the gates it was listeners idea asking for us to come up with a
[1:14:30.120 --> 1:14:34.280]  spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:39.400]  aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways even better way get your

[1:16:10.920 --> 1:16:16.440]  okay let's get into the cult brainwashing so the new york times and the major universities and all
[1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:21.000]  of them were lockstep whether it's europe whether it's in australia whether it's here in the united
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:26.680]  states or canada white people are inherently bad it's original sin to be white this is the most racist
[1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:33.720]  stuff you could ever imagine but if you don't agree with that you're racist and so now they
[1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:38.760]  had the senators had the moment of silence of friday and then get on their knees well now
[1:16:39.400 --> 1:16:44.840]  we've seen nadler and polosi but they wanted to one up we're gonna play the audio here in a moment
[1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:52.280]  uh the senators so they all wore quonset outfits and quanta mask i guess some type of like
[1:16:52.280 --> 1:17:00.040]  kenyan pattern talk about virtues signaling talk about cultural appropriation it's just pandering
[1:17:01.080 --> 1:17:07.880]  it's so transparent it's so disgusting and then of course these individuals could hardly even get
[1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:14.760]  back up once they've gotten on their knees but through this they want america to get on its knees
[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:23.800]  in cult programming of wearing mask and wearing quonset outfits and and bowing it's it's all about
[1:17:23.800 --> 1:17:29.880]  virtues signaling it's all about distracting everybody because these are the mentally ill slaves
[1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:36.360]  polosi and others that the system has to offer so uh here here's the uh first video of polosi
[1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:46.120]  talking about it for those who wish to we will now kneel for our moment of silence
[1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:52.280]  this is a complete total clown show trump's actually trying to stop the fentanyl pouring in
[1:17:52.280 --> 1:17:57.160]  that's killing millions actually trying to get jobs industry all that's real doubling the funding
[1:17:57.160 --> 1:18:02.360]  the black universities all that actually helps people no ladies and gentlemen they want to siphon
[1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:08.840]  off and milk the welfare off of these drug dens they run in order the police is not to patrol
[1:18:08.840 --> 1:18:15.160]  or protect they want open crime red light districts that they control now let's go
[1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:21.240]  for these skexies trying to get back up here it is
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:36.920]  i mean what a joke these people are on another planet so she's bad she's bound to show that
[1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:41.400]  she's able because she's white because they tell black folks don't do it and the police
[1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:46.760]  she's go that's not enough we're gonna get on our bellies and put our hands behind our backs
[1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:54.520]  and now the british prime minister that ended slavery england didn't even have it but they
[1:18:54.520 --> 1:18:59.800]  sent ships out to attack slave ships and and hundreds of thousands of british sailors and
[1:19:00.520 --> 1:19:06.680]  marines were lost in the next 50 years with massive wars to to end slavery well now they're
[1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:13.480]  trying to take down his statue uh that article is up on info wars dot com left us want to topple
[1:19:13.480 --> 1:19:18.360]  statue of british prime minister whose government ended slavery that's right
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:24.440]  statue of charles and url gray a former british prime minister despite the fact that he
[1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:30.040]  oversaw the abolition of slavery in the british empire that's a bad person they attacked
[1:19:30.040 --> 1:19:35.240]  abraham lincoln memorial a few days ago and the black memorial for civil war that's just who the
[1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:40.040]  left is because they're good and you're bad and facts don't matter to them because they're god
[1:19:40.040 --> 1:19:47.400]  well here's the islamist city con who banned uh outdoor advertising in london if it shows
[1:19:47.400 --> 1:19:52.840]  a woman uh in a bathing suit because he's an islamist he allows all the rape gangs and grooming to
[1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:58.120]  go on uh he now is going to have a commission he will decide what can be seen and what will be
[1:19:58.120 --> 1:20:02.840]  taken down so this is the cult of islam you know they love to cut down your statues when they
[1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:08.120]  conquer you and you know later take your women as slaves so here's city con are we taking statues
[1:20:08.120 --> 1:20:14.520]  down i suspect the recommendations of the commission may well be some of the statues be
[1:20:14.520 --> 1:20:20.920]  taken down for example some of the slavers uh for whom there are statues across our city uh i
[1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:26.760]  suspect the commission may come back and say it's not appropriate to be memorializing to be
[1:20:26.760 --> 1:20:31.560]  celebrating these people they're not icons and they may all come back and say our recommendation
[1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:36.920]  is to take these statues down but it's a discussion we should have and it's really important
[1:20:36.920 --> 1:20:43.000]  to bring in diverse voices do you think of any in particular i don't want to name them but we can
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:47.880]  imagine the slavers so for example there are statues of people who are involved in the royal
[1:20:47.880 --> 1:20:53.560]  african company in london so it always starts that way doesn't it oh we're just taking this down but
[1:20:53.560 --> 1:20:57.240]  it's a commission of thought police have the power to take down whatever they want and they want
[1:20:57.240 --> 1:21:03.640]  winston tertio taken down they've now taken down some of the kings in europe it's a joke you can go
[1:21:03.640 --> 1:21:09.080]  to africa right now and they're slavery and i don't defend the institution of slavery itself
[1:21:09.080 --> 1:21:14.600]  christ spoke out against it was going on all over the world then but let me tell you africa
[1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:19.000]  should think it's lucky stars that industry and the west was ever brought there because it helped
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:23.160]  build it up so should the rest of the world everybody knows that but now the globalists are
[1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:29.560]  here to deindustrialize and get rid of everybody but that's okay black lives matter new york times
[1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:33.960]  writer says if your family doesn't support whatever the latest propaganda is the latest
[1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:40.040]  demand to get on your knees or your belly don't associate with them any more you know what the
[1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:48.040]  good news is everyone's running away from you and everyone is running away from leftist ideologies
[1:21:48.040 --> 1:21:52.840]  and the blue states are collapsing i know your plan is to just take the whole country over
[1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:58.840]  and make us submit to you but um this is the death rows of the new world order and we don't
[1:21:58.840 --> 1:22:04.680]  just get buffaloed by it and buy into it it's going to collapse in on itself now when we come back
[1:22:04.680 --> 1:22:11.960]  we're gonna go to your phone calls and then i have the footage all over the country people are coming
[1:22:11.960 --> 1:22:18.600]  up and throwing themselves on the hoods of people's cars it's like a new ride of passage and then they
[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:23.560]  go oh i was attacked a white supremacist kind of remember look at this video let's let's play
[1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:30.200]  again for two viewers we watch they jump up from the side they jump up on the hood they try to jump
[1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:37.160]  in front of the car they picked a small car on the little mini cars and oh that's how you're
[1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:42.280]  really in the inside group and battle hardened like the troops storming normandy as they compare
[1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:45.880]  themselves to while they try to pull down the statue of the commander of it once the church
[1:22:45.880 --> 1:22:52.280]  fell and it's a bunch of white kids with trash can lids running around picking on women driving
[1:22:52.280 --> 1:22:59.720]  mini cars cars to go so again this is the whole takeover plan meanwhile shock video police say
[1:22:59.720 --> 1:23:04.920]  leftist lawyer george floyd protester shot driver in the head the guy's in the truck he doesn't
[1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:11.080]  drive over him he just stops shoots him in the head and look at the satisfaction on the face
[1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:17.960]  for your tv viewer of the liberal lawyer he is a hero he shot a man in the head on video
[1:23:17.960 --> 1:23:25.640]  who stopped to the stop sign he's a hero and the left is celebrating him saying you know what
[1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:33.720]  that truck tried to run him over when it didn't he'd but let's see it's all about oh a lady had
[1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:39.240]  a heart attack and died in starletsville oh a guy drove a car into a crowd let's just go jump
[1:23:39.240 --> 1:23:44.920]  in front of cars and recreate that to again create the civil war let's just start attacking people
[1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:49.400]  on highways and beating them up like all the footage we've got on tape the people of the world
[1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:55.080]  have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the globalists out
[1:23:55.080 --> 1:24:00.200]  of their countries that's why the new world order is instituting race war and division
[1:24:00.200 --> 1:24:06.040]  and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government
[1:24:06.040 --> 1:24:13.240]  and destroying essential services this is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalists as
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:18.360]  they've done in the third world will come in and pick up the pieces we must stand against the un the
[1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:24.120]  imf the world bank and the e you openly saying the fund the police the police have a lot of
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:28.760]  problems we all have a lot of problems but this is our government and our localist tabulary and
[1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:33.400]  believe me once the globalists have overthrown this country they are going to put in a real
[1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:37.240]  police state where you have no due process or freedom the globalists believe communist china
[1:24:37.240 --> 1:24:42.600]  is the model of the world and they are orchestrating this entire thing the people helping them are
[1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:49.960]  collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed info wars dot com it's finally here introducing

[1:26:43.800 --> 1:27:06.600]  victorious we must fight this or lose our souls you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:14.040]  welcome back i'm your host alex jones we're going to talk to anonymous in texas a former leftist
[1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:20.920]  athin in michigan charles in michigan joe in north carolina and many others on whatever topic they
[1:27:20.920 --> 1:27:25.480]  want to raise or the issues that i brought forward about what does it like to be a leftist or do you
[1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:30.520]  still defend the left you still think this isn't a globalist takeover funded by the most rich and
[1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:36.440]  powerful people on earth it asked the question to what does trump going to do to reverse this
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:43.400]  with 146 days down from this election but i wanted to play this video since i mentioned it for
[1:27:43.400 --> 1:27:50.280]  tv viewers radio listeners on their rated just last weekend we had savannah hernanda is out
[1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:56.760]  there during the riots and they blocked out 35 and a white dude gets out of his car and says hey i
[1:27:56.760 --> 1:28:01.080]  love black lives matter but you know i've been stuck out here for a long time and a big black
[1:28:01.080 --> 1:28:05.800]  dude starts punching him and beating him knocks his glasses off and the dude keeps attacking him
[1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:13.240]  so he can't get his glasses and savannah gets in the guy's face and says stop let me tell you
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:19.640]  these are some ballsy demonstrates because i guarantee you that's rioting that's blocking
[1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:28.200]  people you start hitting people folks are got guns in those cars but that's all this has become
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:33.640]  is an excuse for thugs to go crazy and nobody's lionizing the poor white people being attacked
[1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:40.840]  but then we have the footage of the man in the car getting shot in the head this is happening all
[1:28:40.840 --> 1:28:46.120]  over the place and new videos coming out of the left jumping from the side on the hoods and then
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:51.880]  calling police and saying i was attacked i was attacked it's all jesse smolleting on a grand scale
[1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:58.200]  and every leftist goes out to see how they can pose and be a victim now watch that video again
[1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:04.360]  they're jumping in front and on the side of the car look at that from the side of the car
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:11.160]  jumping up on it in fact guys i want to do this as a stunt have one of the crew go to a local
[1:29:11.160 --> 1:29:16.360]  rental car place get a small car and then we'll just reenact this after the show and it'll be
[1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:20.920]  i'll just say stop it with the trash can and jump i don't go i'm a hero and i'll call the police
[1:29:20.920 --> 1:29:26.200]  not literally but i'll do it figure to illustrate this because it keeps happening so here's the
[1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:32.920]  footage with the audio of savannah hernanda is having to defend a skinny white dude being beat up
[1:29:32.920 --> 1:29:48.840]  by a big black dude for no reason other than his race here it is
[1:29:56.920 --> 1:30:00.920]  and i'll jump right on top that dude with my knees jump up straight with my knees on his chest
[1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:08.040]  head goes down bye bye you guys ought to be glad you're messing with little little kids man
[1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:11.320]  boom
[1:30:15.960 --> 1:30:20.440]  and then a woman has to stop him she's trying to find his glasses
[1:30:20.440 --> 1:30:28.040]  we're the men in america are threatened to beat her up
[1:30:33.160 --> 1:30:36.280]  so they shut the highway down you're with your screaming babies everything
[1:30:39.160 --> 1:30:42.920]  because they're the communists they're the good people why george floyd he's our graven idol
[1:30:44.120 --> 1:30:48.840]  when he's not shooting porn movies or working as a bouncer at the club or got bags of fentanyl
[1:30:48.840 --> 1:30:52.520]  falling out of his pocket turns out there's two videos of drugs falling out of his pocket
[1:30:54.280 --> 1:30:58.280]  okay i don't want him to die my point is he's not jesus he's not my god
[1:30:58.280 --> 1:31:02.280]  what's the bible say old testament thou shall have no other gods before me
[1:31:03.880 --> 1:31:08.440]  that goes on into having a graven image you worship
[1:31:11.400 --> 1:31:18.120]  thou shall not make unto thee any graven image or that it goes on that shall not bow down thyself
[1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:25.240]  to it nor serve them for i the lord thy god and a jealous god visiting the iniquity of
[1:31:25.240 --> 1:31:30.280]  thine fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me
[1:31:31.240 --> 1:31:36.520]  and shooing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
[1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:42.840]  boy can you imagine how our generations are going to pay for all the abortion and the rest of it
[1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:50.600]  and now bowing to george soros's black lives matter bowing to black lives matter run by
[1:31:50.600 --> 1:31:55.240]  planned parenthood that wants to abort babies they're bowing to a grip that i love black people
[1:31:55.240 --> 1:32:00.040]  oh a couple of cops did something wrong so we represent black people and then it's planned
[1:32:00.040 --> 1:32:05.240]  parenthood mainly funding it look look it up because if you're there to kill the black people

[1:32:25.400 --> 1:32:29.320]  taught they're bad because of what color they are imagine what it was like for black people
[1:32:29.320 --> 1:32:34.520]  in some areas to be taught they were bad because of what color they were and now repeating it
[1:32:34.520 --> 1:32:40.280]  to supposedly end it how sick is that and the very party that ran that in this country as an
[1:32:40.280 --> 1:32:46.760]  institution is the one teaching it to us now they got a word for that it's called sick as you know

[1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:40.840]  to police from a nearby business that captured the moments leading up to the shooting now we

[1:34:46.200 --> 1:34:52.440]  reporter chelsea brentzel security footage time stamped at 555 thursday evening shows the moment
[1:34:52.440 --> 1:34:58.440]  surrounding a shooting during a protest in downtown alamosa you can see about a dozen protesters
[1:34:58.440 --> 1:35:03.640]  lining main street with signs in hand next a black truck pulls up and as the driver goes through
[1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:08.680]  the crosswalk this protester appears to reach in their pocket pull out what police say is a gun
[1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:13.960]  in aims it at the passenger window of the truck within 11 seconds of nearing the crosswalk the
[1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:18.840]  truck comes to a halt in the middle of the intersection protesters scatter cars continue
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:24.280]  to drive around the stop truck for about two and a half minutes after and then the truck moves
[1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:30.120]  through the intersection alamosa police say they found the driver 49-year-old danie pruitt alert
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:35.000]  about a half mile away from the scene of the shooting shortly after police arrested alamosa
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:40.600]  defense attorney 27-year-old james marshal on several charges including attempted murder and
[1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:46.360]  assault on friday afternoon some protesters told kardio the driver plowed through the crowd but
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:50.920]  here's what alamosa investigators told us about that claim so we heard the same thing um again
[1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:56.680]  it's still an ongoing investigation um i could say that we have no evidence to show that he was
[1:35:56.680 --> 1:36:03.000]  driving into or through the protesters meanwhile many of the protesters in alamosa are stunned by
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:09.800]  the violence sad that things turned the way they turn in a matter of a second i mean you're talking
[1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:17.480]  seconds um it was just the wrong the wrong town at the wrong place black lives matter
[1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:22.120]  and those who have been at the protest all week hope they remain peaceful as they were
[1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:29.560]  before thursday night in alamosa chelsea brentzel kardio news channel 13 we don't know the driver's
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:35.080]  condition right now but a gofund me created by his family indicates he is on life support
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:40.040]  the fundraiser page also says the driver is a single father and a veteran who lives in canyon
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:47.880]  city but a leftist wanted to virtually signal and bust a cat and take a scalp and he did i'm always

[1:40:51.000 --> 1:41:14.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:16.400]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:21.200]  Submitting to the left doesn't get them off your back, it makes them demand more because
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:25.840]  they've got a giant group of people of every race, color, and creed all over the world
[1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:29.120]  that want you to bow and that want you to say you're a racist, so they're going to call
[1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:34.160]  everything racist, everything a microaggression, so they have an excuse to be mean and dominate
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:39.760]  you and then demand a list of demands that you acquiesce to and now you must join their
[1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:44.480]  cult, you must announce yourself, you must say that you're a bad person, you must announce
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:51.440]  your family, you must say America sucks, but never say Bill Gates sucks, never say Ted
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:58.040]  Turner sucks, never say Jeffrey Epstein's bad, never expose the New World Order, never expose
[1:41:58.040 --> 1:42:02.760]  Jeff Bezos and the people worth hundreds of billions of dollars that finance us all killing
[1:42:02.760 --> 1:42:11.320]  each other and turning George Floyd into the patron saint of the UN taking over our local
[1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:12.320]  police.
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:16.520]  That's the evidence of that next hour, but right now let's go to Anonymous in Texas,
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:19.440]  former leftist, thank you for calling, welcome Anonymous.
[1:42:19.440 --> 1:42:22.000]  Hi, how are you Alex?
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:26.800]  I'm doing pretty good, here on air, still able to be on air with a massive censorship
[1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:27.800]  thanks to all of you.
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:34.400]  Well, good, good, I'm a little bit nervous, I think I've called in several times since
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:39.880]  I started listening in 2011 and I ended up hanging up because of the long wait, but
[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:45.360]  I was really rather pleasantly surprised at how long I didn't have to this time.
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:51.240]  Well, I'm working on that, you know, the problem is, is that we have like 20 phone
[1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:55.560]  lines and so if you call in number 15 or number 20, you're waiting hours, but if you
[1:42:55.560 --> 1:42:59.360]  call in first like you did, you're out of the gate, so welcome, go ahead.
[1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:04.520]  Wow, I don't even know where to begin, here's something that's really ironic, you know,
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:09.280]  I listen to whatever I can every day, you know, my husband and I had been listening
[1:43:09.280 --> 1:43:14.240]  to Robert Barnes quite a bit, we really liked David Knight.
[1:43:14.240 --> 1:43:19.560]  We've really, really been following this, you know, especially in terms of recent events
[1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:26.040]  and the irony, excuse me, I am nervous, the irony is I wanted to sit down and write you
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:32.400]  guys a long letter because I've had thoughts as you've been broadcasting over the years
[1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:45.600]  being a former leftist that I, I think you're definitely correct in this way, there a segment
[1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:52.840]  of I was in the anti-war peace and justice movement here in North Texas.
[1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:57.040]  I wasn't a leader, but I was one of the core organizers.
[1:43:57.040 --> 1:44:07.080]  I would say from 1988 off and on until 2003, so it's, you've got a broad spectrum of people
[1:44:07.080 --> 1:44:12.520]  and sometimes I think, and I don't mean to be, well, sometimes I think you're painting
[1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:19.800]  everybody with the same brush, definitely you're correct in that there were some very
[1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:26.080]  militant people that were advocating for violence and overthrow of the government.
[1:44:26.080 --> 1:44:32.280]  I know that for a fact, because I went to one of their meetings and what's happening
[1:44:32.280 --> 1:44:36.400]  now is what they were dreaming of, okay?
[1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:38.040]  So you are very correct in that.
[1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:42.320]  Well, let me just say this to be clear, is the world so complex that I'll oversimplify
[1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:46.680]  on a case by case, what's attractive to me about Democrats 20 years ago was they were
[1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:48.800]  supposedly anti-war.
[1:44:48.800 --> 1:44:52.760]  Now they're the pro war ones, Trump's trying to pull us out of Afghanistan, hold us out
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:55.160]  of Syria, that's a wonderful thing.
[1:44:55.160 --> 1:44:56.800]  The Democrats have totally abandoned that.
[1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:02.440]  I used to be nonpartisan and absolutely there are a lot of great people that are liberals
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:04.760]  who I've known that are really caring good people.
[1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:10.040]  I'm seeing now the multinational corporations and Soros have fully taken over all those
[1:45:10.040 --> 1:45:17.480]  movements from the top down and now by and large they are psychotic, hateful cults.
[1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:22.600]  Absolutely though, I know there are wonderful people that have been in the anti-war movement
[1:45:22.600 --> 1:45:27.960]  and so what are they saying now because Trump really is trying to get us out of these wars?
[1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:30.080]  Yeah, here's something really interesting.
[1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:38.640]  So my last stint with the peace and justice movement was back in 2003 when we were bombing
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:41.560]  whatever, I'm still a little bit nervous.
[1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:42.560]  What weren't we doing?
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:43.560]  Iraq.
[1:45:43.560 --> 1:45:44.560]  Iraq.
[1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:45.560]  Yes, Iraq.
[1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:51.320]  The National Day of Resistance 2003, February, Iraq, that was my last stint.
[1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:57.440]  And so then I was busy, it was a busy mom, you know, I kind of retired from political
[1:45:57.440 --> 1:46:07.200]  work was a busy mom and we, my husband and I, this was when you were at the federal
[1:46:07.200 --> 1:46:09.840]  building, I'm giving away my city, I'm from Dallas.
[1:46:09.840 --> 1:46:13.600]  The Federal Reserve actually, the federal building in 2011.
[1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:17.040]  Yeah, yeah, the private federal reserve, yes, that was the Federal Reserve in Dallas.
[1:46:17.040 --> 1:46:21.880]  Yeah, and then there was the Occupy protest right across the street from you.
[1:46:21.880 --> 1:46:22.880]  Yes.
[1:46:22.880 --> 1:46:27.800]  So my husband and I, we thought, this is kind of interesting, let's go check this out.
[1:46:27.800 --> 1:46:35.160]  So we went down and I kind of just kind of looked at some of the Occupy people and said
[1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:42.320]  hello and all that and then I went over to your side and none of the Occupy people I
[1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:48.520]  even recognized as part of the original peace and justice movement that I worked so closely
[1:46:48.520 --> 1:46:49.920]  with years before.
[1:46:49.920 --> 1:46:55.480]  It was a whole, but then again, the progressive movement, and I really feel this is because
[1:46:55.480 --> 1:47:02.960]  of Obama being elective, the progressive movement really took hold in Dallas after
[1:47:02.960 --> 1:47:11.680]  I left and they had people organizing outside of your traditional peace and justice movement,
[1:47:11.680 --> 1:47:16.960]  which by the way, included people that worked directly with Martin Luther King, yadda yadda
[1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:17.960]  yadda.
[1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:20.640]  Well, exactly, and all that's being thrown out.
[1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:24.280]  Now it's not about don't look at color, it's only look at color, and I could talk to you
[1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:27.440]  for hours, God bless you, and I'm glad you called in, I'm glad you brought up the issue
[1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:35.520]  that the original liberals in America are good people and you've been hijacked and taking
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:40.840]  control of the old Republican blueblods, we've hijacked them with our populist movement.
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:46.200]  So we're the insurrection, and we're against these needless wars, we're against the global
[1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:50.720]  government, we do want a strong military, and we're just here to help.
[1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:52.680]  And that's what is happening here.
[1:47:52.680 --> 1:47:55.800]  All right, God bless you, man, I really appreciate your call.
[1:47:55.800 --> 1:48:02.440]  Let's take another call, does anybody disagree and I'll go to them.
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:07.600]  Let's talk to Justin in Idaho, former leftist union organizer, welcome Justin, tell us what's
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:08.600]  happening.
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:11.200]  Hi Alex, God bless you.
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:12.200]  God bless you.
[1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:23.160]  Yeah, so I was a former leftist guy, I'm a little nervous, I was hanging around with
[1:48:23.160 --> 1:48:30.200]  some of the WSA guys, the workers solidarity alliance and student bombs people, and the
[1:48:30.200 --> 1:48:36.520]  whole Occupy Wall Street thing hanging around those people just disgusted me and I woke
[1:48:36.520 --> 1:48:45.600]  up you know, I woke up after 9-11 when I was 16 years old, I knew that wasn't a, I just
[1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:51.120]  knew that it wasn't a real thing, you know, I could just tell that's whenever I found
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:58.000]  you in high school, and then I kind of, George Bush, I hated George Bush so much, that it
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:03.280]  kind of pushed me towards the left, you know.
[1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:12.320]  Really and now, George W. Bush has endorsed Biden, right, and then I like Winston Churchill
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:15.760]  quote that actually makes me feel a little better, he said, if you weren't, if you're
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:19.960]  not a liberal when you're young, you have no heart, you know, become a conservative as
[1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:23.880]  you get older, I probably even butchering this, you have no brain, that's what he said,
[1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:26.880]  made me feel better.
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:31.520]  Winston Churchill was a really smart guy and now they want to pull his statue down, their
[1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:32.520]  statue down.
[1:49:32.520 --> 1:49:37.480]  They're calling him a fascist but they're comparing themselves to the D-Day invasion
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:39.800]  when he commanded that.
[1:49:39.800 --> 1:49:40.800]  Right.
[1:49:40.800 --> 1:49:41.800]  Yeah.
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:45.560]  They have no sense of irony, have you noticed that, because the liberals I used to know
[1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:48.640]  knew history and were informed.
[1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:51.680]  I like them more than main line conservatives that were all just blue bloods and thought
[1:49:51.680 --> 1:49:57.120]  they were elitist and I mean the average Republican was an establishment person, they didn't care
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:50:00.840]  about the Second Amendment or freedom, they were elitist, they weren't populist, so I
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:04.120]  thought the liberals had some good in them because they were populist.
[1:50:04.120 --> 1:50:09.840]  But now that's all gone man, it's all stinking sorrows, neoliberal corporate poison.
[1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:16.200]  Yeah, then I worked for my union, I was an organizer, I got appointed to that position
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:23.720]  and I was just disgusted by, so I never met any gangsters, I think the guys that run the
[1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:28.440]  union, they're not necessarily, at least the ones, by experience, they didn't let me in
[1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:30.320]  on that, I guess it wasn't part of the club all the way.
[1:50:30.320 --> 1:50:33.400]  No, no, no, the average union guys are just taking orders from on top and they're just
[1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:35.120]  trying to get a better deal for their people.
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:39.800]  I don't think you really find the evil in the unions, I mean it's all the academics,
[1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:44.520]  it's the anti-fights, the politicos, they're just the scum of the earth.
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:49.600]  It was the bankers that I got the evil feelings from whenever we would do like we'd have meetings
[1:50:49.600 --> 1:50:55.000]  with the guys that controlled our fund and my union's a pretty big union, we have billions.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:59.040]  Oh, it's famous, that's his stealing the money brother, exactly.
[1:50:59.040 --> 1:51:01.480]  That's who I was disgusted by, it was, it was great.
[1:51:01.480 --> 1:51:05.280]  And whose finance and black lives matter in anti-fights, the big banks.
[1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:06.280]  Right, yeah.
[1:51:06.280 --> 1:51:11.480]  What does Willie Nelson say, bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do,
[1:51:11.480 --> 1:51:16.200]  he says he's coming to take my property but the clouds are coming too, he ain't my friend
[1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:17.200]  and I'll ride again.
[1:51:17.200 --> 1:51:21.920]  Thank you so much Justin, more calls straight ahead than Dr. Steve Pachina to give his take
[1:51:21.920 --> 1:51:26.360]  on this attempt to overthrow the republic and replace it with a nightmare, his job used
[1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:28.480]  to be overthrowing governments.
[1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:32.480]  He's an expert on it, we'll talk to him coming up, but first more of your phone calls, stay
[1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:33.480]  with us.
[1:51:33.480 --> 1:51:43.080]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut, you're on the air, thanks for holding, I sure can sir,
[1:51:43.080 --> 1:51:44.080]  thank you.
[1:51:44.080 --> 1:51:48.160]  Hey Alex, before I start man, I just, I just wanted to talk to you bro and it's a pleasure
[1:51:48.160 --> 1:51:50.240]  to be talking right now with you man.
[1:51:50.240 --> 1:51:56.440]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you brother, I just want to plug in, I'm a truck driver
[1:51:56.440 --> 1:52:02.520]  and two before us have changed the way I drive, me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple
[1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:10.120]  of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, we used to be on Monster and Red Bull
[1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:14.320]  and Rolla and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just
[1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:15.520]  want to thank you for that man.
[1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:20.120]  Well brother, we put more in this than any other long term high quality energy powder
[1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:23.800]  there is, so this was designed on one of the top guys in the country, he didn't want his
[1:52:23.800 --> 1:52:26.880]  name on it because obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for
[1:52:26.880 --> 1:52:30.800]  this formulation just for the design of it and we believe it is the best, strongest but
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:34.720]  healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life better so that means
[1:52:34.720 --> 1:52:35.720]  a lot to me, thank you.
[1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:39.800]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[1:52:39.800 --> 1:52:46.720]  This is the end my friends, my only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of
[1:52:46.720 --> 1:52:53.760]  everything that stands, the end, the safety, the delusion, it's all over ladies and gentlemen
[1:52:53.760 --> 1:53:01.640]  because it was only the mirage of safety, movies and partying and living like children,
[1:53:01.640 --> 1:53:08.040]  ever growing up, ever caring about other people, this delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[1:53:08.040 --> 1:53:12.040]  Just like the history book show, it's just like the Bible states, every time Israel became
[1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:17.280]  corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity because their
[1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:23.600]  people sold out to special interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved.
[1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:29.680]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:32.160]  absolute bondage.
[1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:36.240]  Info Wars has decided to fight for freedom and Info Wars has had great victory thanks
[1:53:36.240 --> 1:53:42.000]  to your support and your prayers.
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:53.960]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:53.960 --> 1:54:03.000]  I am a shotgun rider, I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto line, the desert is my
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  brother, my skin is cracked and dry, I was riding on a folk coast and everything was
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:18.760]  fine till we took a shorter road to save some time, bandits only fired once they shot me
[1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:19.760]  in the chest.
[1:54:19.760 --> 1:54:25.160]  They may have wounded me, they may have wounded me, but they'll never get the best of better
[1:54:25.160 --> 1:54:26.160]  men.
[1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:31.680]  Thank you for joining us on this live Tuesday edition or your phone call is coming up right
[1:54:31.680 --> 1:54:36.560]  now but just during the break I was watching one of the founding members of the real Black
[1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:42.600]  Panther Party, Larry Pinkney on with one of the other talk show hosts here, they were
[1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:48.160]  showing footage of people climbing on top of 18 wheelers and knocking the windows out
[1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:49.160]  and stuff.
[1:54:49.160 --> 1:54:56.200]  I mean this is brutal robbery and all that matters is they're white and it's mainly white
[1:54:56.200 --> 1:54:58.840]  people attacking them.
[1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:06.080]  It's so damn creepy and you know I don't want to kill anybody, I don't want to kill
[1:55:06.080 --> 1:55:10.080]  people plus I don't want the trouble that comes with it, man let me tell you something.
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:12.960]  You start trying to knock the windows out of my car and grab me on my car, I'm gonna
[1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:16.120]  feel your ass full of lead.
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:19.960]  These people are really lucky, but they got cases where they're trying to drive people
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:23.160]  out of their cars and they're shooting people now, the police are arresting them.
[1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:28.000]  It's another virtue signal because the media and the culture is trying to encourage the
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:31.960]  rioting and Trump's advisors are telling him, oh don't come out against it, you'll look
[1:55:31.960 --> 1:55:38.280]  bad knowing that it actually hurts Trump with his constituents and they're afraid of that
[1:55:38.280 --> 1:55:43.680]  wrong image you know of a cop doing something wrong, people know this is all hysteria, people
[1:55:43.680 --> 1:55:48.360]  know it's out of control, people know that the average person can't even run their own
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:53.280]  life even if you're competent, but just imagine everybody's trying to pull you out of your
[1:55:53.280 --> 1:56:01.480]  car, they knock your window out, you shoot somebody and now they've arrested that guy
[1:56:01.480 --> 1:56:06.840]  because he didn't want metal barriers blocking his car in so he could swear fealty and get
[1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:15.560]  on his knees or get killed.
[1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:20.600]  Left awoke, Katie in North Carolina, Katie, then we'll go to Dre, Jordan, Joe, James,
[1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:23.640]  Jack, Katie you're on the air, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:30.600]  Thank you so much for taking my call, I was 19 when I voted for Obama, I loved America,
[1:56:30.600 --> 1:56:39.040]  I loved my country and I believed Obama, he was very convincing and it was during Benghazi,
[1:56:39.040 --> 1:56:46.840]  the media, the way they completely didn't tell the truth and I saw they didn't tell
[1:56:46.840 --> 1:56:53.120]  the truth with information that was coming out, you could watch videos on it, the different
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:59.960]  men that were over there you know contradicted what the media was saying happened and I started
[1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:05.360]  doing research and I found you, I watched in game, I probably watched in game like 20
[1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:11.720]  times, I share it to everybody I know and I'm just really scared for the way that our
[1:57:11.720 --> 1:57:19.980]  children is, they've been undereducated, over indoctrinated and they've literally turned
[1:57:19.980 --> 1:57:21.480]  our youth into anarchists.
[1:57:21.480 --> 1:57:27.040]  Well that's the plan exactly, don't teach them history or geography or math, make them
[1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:33.480]  totally dumb and weak, totally ignorant and then fill them full of microaggression and
[1:57:33.480 --> 1:57:38.840]  whites are bad, I mean this is the most evil crap, it's what it is, it's Nazi, the Nazis
[1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:43.120]  taught people everything was about what color you were and now they're literally teaching
[1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:47.760]  it the Democratic Party is, it's just crazy.
[1:57:47.760 --> 1:57:55.720]  My main question to you is how do we get the children to wake up because honestly I believe
[1:57:55.720 --> 1:58:02.000]  the majority of the people in this country love being American, people come to this country
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:05.640]  because they love what we stand for.
[1:58:05.640 --> 1:58:09.320]  Exactly and now they come here to be victims, oh I'm coming here because you're going to
[1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:14.480]  oppress me, it's all a load of crap and everyone knows it but we've got to get up against all
[1:58:14.480 --> 1:58:19.520]  the big corporations are lined up, it's the elite doing this, it's not the grassroots,
[1:58:19.520 --> 1:58:23.880]  it's the elite funding the whole thing, Katie we love you, we appreciate your call, the
[1:58:23.880 --> 1:58:30.080]  key to this is exposing that it's the big billionaires to almost a man and woman that
[1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:34.120]  are funding this whole deal with the Chinese Commies, the Chinese Commies don't allow
[1:58:34.120 --> 1:58:36.840]  a bunch of race planning in their country because they're in the authoritarian regime
[1:58:36.840 --> 1:58:41.760]  they know it weakens them but boy do they fund it here and it's disgusting, we're back
[1:58:41.760 --> 1:58:46.640]  in 60 seconds with Barbo and others.
[1:58:46.640 --> 1:58:51.240]  It's finally here, introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true
[1:58:51.240 --> 1:58:56.160]  atomic iodine, listeners have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made
[1:58:56.160 --> 1:59:00.320]  with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine, after extensive development it's
[1:59:00.320 --> 1:59:01.320]  finally here.
[1:59:01.320 --> 1:59:05.800]  Our proprietary new aerodine technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine
[1:59:05.800 --> 1:59:10.280]  crystals from 7000 feet below the earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula, I
[1:59:10.280 --> 1:59:14.280]  have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power
[1:59:14.280 --> 1:59:18.320]  of true nascent iodine working for my body, I can personally feel the difference.
[1:59:18.320 --> 1:59:22.680]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy
[1:59:22.680 --> 1:59:27.640]  metabolism, healthy hormone levels and healthy cognitive function, iodine may also support
[1:59:27.640 --> 1:59:32.200]  your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins, get your daily dose of
[1:59:32.200 --> 1:59:36.600]  essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine today, get the new

[2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:27.640]  you to choose a side, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:00:30.400 --> 2:00:35.680]  That's virtue signaling for you right there and the democratic party it now just broke
[2:00:35.680 --> 2:00:43.680]  on infowars.com, money laundering global donations to blacklivesmatter.com funded and funneled
[2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:49.480]  to the DNC, Democrats openly conducting illegal money laundering operation at the same time
[2:00:49.480 --> 2:01:01.080]  in the name of saving black lives, of course total complete exploitation, all right, let's
[2:01:01.080 --> 2:01:07.400]  go ahead and take more calls here who's been holding longest, that would be Dre in Chicago,
[2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:15.240]  Dre thanks for calling, yeah you hear me, yes sir go ahead, I was calling because people
[2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:21.000]  talk about systematic racism in America and they don't really like I don't hear no leaders
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:28.920]  nobody talk about this as far as how generational wealth, black people was never got a chance
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:34.240]  to experience generational wealth because of what we went through throughout the history
[2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:40.280]  of America and that's really what's causing the effect of what we see right now in black
[2:01:40.280 --> 2:01:50.080]  communities and you know, the bad things that we go through, I agree with you is that it's
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:55.400]  the generational wealth system that's why Trump has talked about tax credits for black
[2:01:55.400 --> 2:02:02.520]  businesses that are new to not pay taxes for say 10 years, I never heard of that, that's
[2:02:02.520 --> 2:02:09.000]  what Trump has been proposing they're trying to block it, and that's another thing to like
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:14.280]  this, I could agree that black people should need to wake up on this part, I'm not sure
[2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:19.480]  how politics or anything would help us with that, and I think they're doing that purposely
[2:02:19.480 --> 2:02:25.720]  through the music, like say music, movies and everything that they glamorize and all that,
[2:02:25.720 --> 2:02:38.040]  but we do get like we studied, I forgot what I was talking about, I forgot what I was talking
[2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:40.480]  about, I know how it is man, you're sitting on hold 20 minutes, you forget what you're
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:45.160]  going to say, I did the same thing myself, but no, but no, but yeah, we do basically
[2:02:45.160 --> 2:02:49.480]  got to wake up so it's not trusting, you know, like falling, keep falling into what they
[2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:54.720]  basically doing right now, you know what I'm saying, they using our, our, somebody said
[2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:58.280]  it on your show, they pepping our, our pain, you know what I'm saying, well there's no
[2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:02.280]  doubt, I mean, what do you think of a bunch of white Democrats kneeling and bowing and
[2:03:02.280 --> 2:03:07.360]  wearing Kenya outfits, I mean, that's, I mean, if I said to somebody, I'm sorry for what
[2:03:07.360 --> 2:03:11.960]  happened to you, I'd say it, I wouldn't dress up an African outfit and by the way, I'm not
[2:03:11.960 --> 2:03:17.280]  against cultural appropriation, but if you like how a foreign outfit looks, wear it,
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:23.160]  but I'm saying they all dress up in Africa outfits with, with Kenyan dress on and then
[2:03:23.160 --> 2:03:27.280]  go out there to say they're in, it just, to me, it's very patronizing, patronizing.
[2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:31.880]  Patronizing people, man, like they're really, and then how they acted at George Floyd's
[2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:37.880]  show, I'm like, it's shocked how black people not waking up to how they, how they act, you
[2:03:37.880 --> 2:03:38.880]  know what I'm saying?
[2:03:38.880 --> 2:03:42.520]  Well, you talk about pimping, they've had funerals going on since Friday.
[2:03:42.520 --> 2:03:44.880]  How many days of funerals are going to have?
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:45.880]  Right, exactly.
[2:03:45.880 --> 2:03:51.320]  But no, what happened was, I've seen that video and it was a black lady that helped
[2:03:51.320 --> 2:03:55.320]  Pelosi out when she was in a fall, I think, and that black lady, she should be fired.
[2:03:55.320 --> 2:03:59.960]  Ain't no way she should help a racist white lady who blamed herself for George Floyd's
[2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:00.960]  death.
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:01.960]  That's crazy.
[2:04:01.960 --> 2:04:02.960]  God bless you, Dre.
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:03.960]  Appreciate the call.
[2:04:03.960 --> 2:04:04.960]  All right.
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:06.240]  Who's been holding the longest after that?
[2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:09.240]  That would be Jack in Canada, disagrees.
[2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:10.240]  Go ahead.
[2:04:10.240 --> 2:04:11.240]  You're on the air.
[2:04:11.240 --> 2:04:12.240]  Welcome.
[2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:13.240]  Oh, hey there, Jonesy.
[2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:17.440]  Can you keep your mouth shut to let me get my point across quickly?
[2:04:17.440 --> 2:04:20.160]  Well, you sound like a nasty leftist, but go ahead, please.
[2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:21.160]  You called.
[2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:24.200]  Well, I just can't believe you've been there for the past half hours.
[2:04:24.200 --> 2:04:25.880]  I got an onion ring right here.
[2:04:25.880 --> 2:04:29.000]  They went and got me from one of my favorite places called Dan's.
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:31.120]  So while you sit there and talk, I may eat this iron.
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:33.320]  Oh, no, you already got to be off.
[2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:34.320]  It's okay.
[2:04:34.320 --> 2:04:35.320]  I do know what's going to happen.
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:36.320]  You go ahead, Jones.
[2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:37.320]  You're on the air.
[2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:38.320]  Go ahead.
[2:04:38.320 --> 2:04:39.320]  Okay.
[2:04:39.320 --> 2:04:40.320]  Well, I'd like to know.
[2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:48.320]  I've done a little research into your info wars and what happened to the old firepower
[2:04:48.320 --> 2:04:49.320]  news?
[2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:52.920]  Where's where's your old black anchor?
[2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:53.920]  Huh?
[2:04:53.920 --> 2:04:55.920]  Your racist?
[2:04:55.920 --> 2:04:56.920]  That's right.
[2:04:56.920 --> 2:05:01.680]  We're racist because we ended up not doing firepower news due to lack of crew and we've
[2:05:01.680 --> 2:05:05.040]  been trying to hire more crew and it still hasn't worked out.
[2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:10.360]  That's why for at least a month or two, we're going to have to suspend doing the latest
[2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:11.360]  show.
[2:05:11.360 --> 2:05:12.360]  We're doing barns.
[2:05:12.360 --> 2:05:13.360]  The show is very popular.
[2:05:13.360 --> 2:05:14.960]  We just haven't been able to hire the crew or get the crew.
[2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:18.960]  We're probably going to suspend that for about two months until the election so we can
[2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:24.960]  bring a countdown America back with Barnes and of course I'm being racist against Barnes
[2:05:24.960 --> 2:05:25.960]  as well.
[2:05:25.960 --> 2:05:30.280]  We've had a big crew problem getting enough high quality crew in here to run the show.
[2:05:30.280 --> 2:05:37.720]  So if I hire a black guy and have him on as a guest and then we do a show as a test and
[2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:41.840]  then we have to stop the show for a while, that is inherently bad.
[2:05:41.840 --> 2:05:45.640]  So I mean, this is like real weird leftist ideology.
[2:05:45.640 --> 2:05:49.680]  You're like calling in to say that I've engaged in an evil racist act.
[2:05:49.680 --> 2:05:52.520]  Tell me more about what I did.
[2:05:52.520 --> 2:05:54.360]  I'm totally nothing with you.
[2:05:54.360 --> 2:05:56.840]  I follow this.
[2:05:56.840 --> 2:05:57.840]  I use bodies.
[2:05:57.840 --> 2:05:59.840]  I use it to say it's all awesome.
[2:05:59.840 --> 2:06:00.840]  I was just that.
[2:06:00.840 --> 2:06:01.840]  All right.
[2:06:01.840 --> 2:06:02.840]  I appreciate your call, Jack.
[2:06:02.840 --> 2:06:04.640]  We're not trying to make jokes about this.
[2:06:04.640 --> 2:06:12.440]  I wanted to continue firepower and literally you think Texas is conservative.
[2:06:12.440 --> 2:06:16.040]  Most people that come and ask for the job interview, they find out it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:16.040 --> 2:06:17.800]  They won't even take the job.
[2:06:17.800 --> 2:06:22.240]  We got a great crew now, but they're overworked and they're exhausted and we've not been
[2:06:22.240 --> 2:06:25.720]  able to launch all the new shows I want because we've had problems getting new people hired
[2:06:25.720 --> 2:06:27.800]  and getting them in and getting it set up.
[2:06:27.800 --> 2:06:30.920]  Maybe it's a bottleneck with the crew or the folks that are hiring people, but we're
[2:06:30.920 --> 2:06:34.280]  trying to get it done right now.
[2:06:34.280 --> 2:06:35.600]  That was a caller trolling us.
[2:06:35.600 --> 2:06:36.600]  That's not funny.
[2:06:36.600 --> 2:06:41.960]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Texas.
[2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:42.960]  Go ahead, James.
[2:06:42.960 --> 2:06:43.960]  Democrat term Republican.
[2:06:43.960 --> 2:06:44.960]  Tell us what happened.
[2:06:44.960 --> 2:06:45.960]  Good.
[2:06:45.960 --> 2:06:46.960]  Good, brother.
[2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:47.960]  Hi.
[2:06:47.960 --> 2:06:54.320]  I was just wondering when is Trump going to pick Rand Paul as his VP because I really
[2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:55.680]  just don't trust Pence.
[2:06:55.680 --> 2:07:01.600]  I'm from Indiana and I've just heard him say good things about booty judge and there's
[2:07:01.600 --> 2:07:06.520]  a lot of rumors, you know, that he's just kind of deep enrooted as a blue blood in Indiana.
[2:07:06.520 --> 2:07:14.160]  So I'm just wondering, is he going to just pick Rand Paul and clear out his cabinet?
[2:07:14.160 --> 2:07:16.520]  Pence has said good things about booty judge.
[2:07:16.520 --> 2:07:22.800]  Well, yeah, like when booty judge was getting up in the polls, you know, they asked Pence
[2:07:22.800 --> 2:07:26.000]  about a couple of things that booty judge has said and he just said that he was like
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:30.480]  a nice guy and that they had worked together on a couple of different bills, you know,
[2:07:30.480 --> 2:07:34.160]  and I'm not saying he should talk bad about him or anything, but like, I don't know.
[2:07:34.160 --> 2:07:39.360]  I just don't know if I trust Pence because, I mean, honestly, I feel like if Rand Paul
[2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:46.000]  was the vice president, more people would come to his base, you know.
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.360]  I like Rand Paul more than Pence.
[2:07:48.360 --> 2:07:50.040]  You say you're a Democrat, Trump Republican.
[2:07:50.040 --> 2:07:51.040]  Tell us about that.
[2:07:51.040 --> 2:07:56.840]  Well, I mean, I used to be like a really big activist, you know, I, you know, I grew
[2:07:56.840 --> 2:08:02.360]  up in the early nineties and from in Indiana, kind of right by South Bend and, you know,
[2:08:02.360 --> 2:08:04.560]  there's just a real blue state now.
[2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:10.360]  It used to be more red, but I just feel like right around the time of Benghazi and Fast
[2:08:10.360 --> 2:08:16.240]  and Furious, I just really started waking up to how Obama just really wasn't saying what
[2:08:16.240 --> 2:08:17.240]  he meant.
[2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:21.240]  You know, he was just kind of, I feel like he was just reading lines and stuff.
[2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:25.760]  And then I feel like right around that, Trump came out with the birther thing and it kind
[2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:28.320]  of just woke me up a little bit.
[2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:32.000]  Well, there's no doubt that Obama's trying to hide his origins, but it's because his
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:38.520]  father is a famous communist from Chicago and it's all confirmed, it's incredible.
[2:08:38.520 --> 2:08:45.000]  That's why they planted Hillary first planted Obama being born in Kenya story and nobody's
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  bad researching it.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.640]  The body was bad that questioned it.
[2:08:48.640 --> 2:08:53.860]  His Harvard, he was the editor of the Harvard law review.
[2:08:53.860 --> 2:08:56.640]  They said in there he was born in Kenya.
[2:08:56.640 --> 2:09:01.440]  So people saw all that, but that was just him being trendy early on, lying about that
[2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:02.440]  too.
[2:09:02.440 --> 2:09:07.640]  Obama and these Democrats will just say whatever they want at the moment because they think
[2:09:07.640 --> 2:09:09.600]  you don't have a memory.
[2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:10.600]  And so that's what they're really doing.
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:17.600]  I think like a lot of leftists, like, especially right now are kind of waking up and coming
[2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:22.840]  more to the center, especially when they see how the Democrats are just blatantly, you
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:26.800]  know, taking money from anybody in China and everything.
[2:09:26.800 --> 2:09:28.240]  I hear your brother, God bless you.
[2:09:28.240 --> 2:09:30.640]  I'm glad that you're taking action.
[2:09:30.640 --> 2:09:31.640]  Republicans aren't perfect either.
[2:09:31.640 --> 2:09:35.440]  They got their own problems, but they hate Trump because he's not been part of their
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:36.440]  club.
[2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:39.640]  We'll be right back with Dr. Steve Pachennick and your calls.
[2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:50.120]  Please stay with us.
[2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:55.840]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russia gate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:09:56.840]  hoax.
[2:09:56.840 --> 2:10:02.360]  And now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:06.800]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next, what I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch
[2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:11.360]  of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race for.
[2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:17.160]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:19.760]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[2:10:19.760 --> 2:10:23.880]  That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor them for wars
[2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:28.960]  off the air because they knew when they launched this whole situation that they didn't want
[2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:34.520]  the people's voice to still be on air, but thanks to you and our crew, we are still on
[2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:35.520]  air.

[2:11:49.840 --> 2:12:05.160]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:11.400]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, give it a believe, you got one!
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:24.280]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:25.960]  That was 12 years ago.
[2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:32.280]  It just so happens I'm wearing the very same T-shirt today when I gave that speech in Dallas.
[2:12:32.280 --> 2:12:33.280]  Welcome back.
[2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:34.280]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:36.280]  Dr. Steve Piccinic is going to be joining us in a moment.
[2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:37.680]  We're having some skype issues.
[2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:40.080]  He'll be with us a little bit in the next hour.
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:41.520]  We'll also get to your calls.
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:44.920]  We do have an exciting announcement.
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:49.960]  X2 that is Deep Earth Crystal, pure iodine that's essential to the body and such a game
[2:12:49.960 --> 2:12:51.440]  changer is about to sell out.
[2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:52.440]  But I'm keeping it.
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:57.720]  Even though the main sale is over, it's 60% off until it sells out because we're getting
[2:12:57.720 --> 2:12:58.720]  more in about a month.
[2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:02.600]  I don't want folks to put on the fence about clean iodine to find out how great it is at
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:06.160]  InfowarsStore.com and have a chance to support the broadcast.
[2:13:06.160 --> 2:13:08.080]  That's very close to cost at that price.
[2:13:08.080 --> 2:13:13.160]  A lot of people requested Survival Shield X2 in a spray bottle, but with the formulation
[2:13:13.160 --> 2:13:14.960]  we had, it didn't work as well.
[2:13:14.960 --> 2:13:21.320]  Well, we've got a new technology, a new form of X2, it's the same Deep Earth Crystal iodine,
[2:13:21.320 --> 2:13:23.920]  and it's a great way to ingest it.
[2:13:23.920 --> 2:13:29.760]  It's a great way to not forget to take it because in a dropper, it can get on things.
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:33.200]  It's good for your bathroom, good for your kitchen, good for the dinner table, but this
[2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:35.280]  is just a great way to deliver it.
[2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:39.120]  So aerosolizes into the throat, has some good effects there.
[2:13:39.120 --> 2:13:47.760]  So X2 spray out of the gates, discounted 40% off at InfowarsStore.com, we're really excited
[2:13:47.760 --> 2:13:48.760]  about it.
[2:13:48.760 --> 2:13:53.120]  Survival Shield X2, InfowarsStore.com, 40% off in the 1920s, the medical establishment
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:54.120]  was clear.
[2:13:54.120 --> 2:13:59.600]  You need iodine to live, without it, you die, but at the very least you will probably have
[2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:04.480]  a reduced IQ, but even today, iodine deficiency is still a serious problem.
[2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:08.960]  The World Health Organization estimates there are nearly 50 million people still suffering
[2:14:08.960 --> 2:14:12.560]  some kind of mental impairment related to iodine deficiency.
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:19.720]  That's why it's important for you to try Survival Shield X2, the only source of 99.999 ultra-deep
[2:14:19.720 --> 2:14:24.760]  Earth iodine crystals from way more than 7,000 people below the surface.
[2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:31.080]  That's exclusively available through InfowarsLife.com for an entirely extremely affordable price.
[2:14:31.080 --> 2:14:39.320]  So again, get your X2 now in the spray bottle at InfowarsStore.com, or you can call toll-free,

[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:49.120]  And it's just a little side note, I'd ask for the X2 new write-up.
[2:14:49.120 --> 2:14:55.400]  This is about a two-year-old write-up, not sure how that happened, not a big deal.
[2:14:55.400 --> 2:15:01.960]  It's just that I put together the new write-up for the new X2.
[2:15:01.960 --> 2:15:06.640]  And I really wanted that, and I don't have that.
[2:15:06.640 --> 2:15:10.440]  And since I'm going to say something on air, I get it, because the crew's great.
[2:15:10.440 --> 2:15:15.720]  So it's not bitching on air, it's just maybe, can I get that, that'd be good.
[2:15:15.720 --> 2:15:23.720]  Separately, another big announcement, all Infowars shirts available at cost, all Infowars
[2:15:23.720 --> 2:15:26.320]  shirts available at cost.
[2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:32.280]  With the campaign here, with the attacks on free speech, with the shutdown of civilization
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:39.240]  and society, we have all Infowars shirts available at cost.
[2:15:39.240 --> 2:15:42.640]  We haven't done this since the last campaign in 2016.
[2:15:42.640 --> 2:15:46.040]  Now the average shirt costs us about $9.95.
[2:15:46.040 --> 2:15:49.520]  Some costs us $5, some costs us $15 to make.
[2:15:49.520 --> 2:15:54.600]  But right now, everything, whether it's an inexpensive shirt or one of the fancy designer
[2:15:54.600 --> 2:15:59.120]  shirts, there's too many shirts, hundreds of shirts that go through each one to pick
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:00.360]  a special price.
[2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:09.720]  We're just going to cost $9.95 on average on over 100 shirts, all apparel at InfowarsStore.com
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:16.560]  is $9.95, and that averages out to cost, so you can get an Infowars.com shirt, you can
[2:16:16.560 --> 2:16:20.640]  get a Betsy Ross Infowars.com shirt, you can get one of the new Space Force shirts, you
[2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:26.360]  can get the Don't Tread on Me shirts, there's over 100 shirts, some shirts we've got a couple
[2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:32.480]  hundred of, some shirts we've got a few thousand of, but as supplies last until we sell out
[2:16:32.480 --> 2:16:38.600]  of the massive shirts, they're all at cost at InfowarsStore.com, I want to thank you
[2:16:38.600 --> 2:16:43.680]  all for your support, but that's how we spread the word.
[2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:51.480]  And again, the crew's great, I just asked for the new X2 ad, and I saw 40% off, X2 60%
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:56.360]  off right now, till it sells out, that's why I was kind of double taking.
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:17:03.240]  The new one, there's not even enough money in it to do 40% off or 50% off, so here is
[2:17:03.240 --> 2:17:05.640]  the new ride up.
[2:17:05.640 --> 2:17:12.840]  It's finally here, introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray available for 33% off, 1995
[2:17:12.840 --> 2:17:17.720]  for a pricing at InfowarsStore.com, listeners have been asking us for months to develop
[2:17:17.720 --> 2:17:22.640]  an iodine spray made with our exclusive Deep Earth Crystal, nascent iodine, after extensive
[2:17:22.640 --> 2:17:27.280]  development it's finally here, introducing the first of its kind nascent iodine spray
[2:17:27.280 --> 2:17:33.080]  made with true atomic iodine, our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness
[2:17:33.080 --> 2:17:38.200]  the full power of ancient iodine crystals from below 7000 feet in the Earth's surface
[2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:42.840]  and the ultimate spray formula, I've been using X2 spray every day the last few months
[2:17:42.840 --> 2:17:47.760]  and I really feel good, not just the effects but knowing the power of true to nascent iodine
[2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:50.640]  can now be carried with me to deliver it even better.
[2:17:50.640 --> 2:17:55.320]  I can personally feel the difference, we know iodine is an essential mineral that supports
[2:17:55.320 --> 2:18:00.560]  thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels and healthy cognitive
[2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:05.120]  function, iodine may also support your body and a healthy response to environmental and

[2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:27.600]  we sell out of our limited first shipment, that's InfowarsStore.com and let's shift a
[2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:32.720]  phone for Pachennic, I'm just going to tap out at this point, say I have 10 minutes,
[2:18:32.720 --> 2:18:41.160]  15 minutes trying to get him on, oh we have him now on Skype, okay well I'm going to try
[2:18:41.160 --> 2:18:48.040]  to go to him now, so much happening in the world, so much unfolding, obviously this is
[2:18:48.040 --> 2:18:52.800]  an attempt to destabilize the country after the whole COVID hysteria and now we're off
[2:18:52.800 --> 2:18:57.600]  the races again, Pachennic is the best selling author, researcher, co-wrote books of course
[2:18:57.600 --> 2:19:02.840]  with Tom Clancy and ran psychological warfare operations, the state department, we don't
[2:19:02.840 --> 2:19:08.080]  have time really to get into this now, but just in the next minute and a half, what do
[2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:13.080]  you make of Floyd without addressing it from a political perspective but just from a historical
[2:19:13.080 --> 2:19:17.680]  perspective, is this not an attempt to create basically civil unrest?
[2:19:17.680 --> 2:19:23.680]  Yes, it's called agitation propaganda, Floyd is almost irrelevant to the whole story, his
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:28.960]  history is one of a convicted criminal or he's been in prison five different times over
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:33.680]  ten years, this is the type of individual we would have kept at St. Elizabeth's hospital
[2:19:33.680 --> 2:19:38.120]  for the criminally insane most of his life, so the fact that he was released, he was on
[2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:43.760]  fentanyl methamphetamine, he was already a convicted felon, that's almost secondary
[2:19:43.760 --> 2:19:48.200]  to the whole issue, what really what this is about is an attempt to destabilize the
[2:19:48.200 --> 2:19:54.320]  government agitation propaganda and it's not working, it's not working because it's
[2:19:54.320 --> 2:19:59.360]  ending up to be a parody of itself and what's coming out is to show the absurdity of the
[2:19:59.360 --> 2:20:04.600]  liberals and the ineffectiveness and their inability to really do anything other than
[2:20:04.600 --> 2:20:10.640]  to parody themselves and to look at an attempt to destroy the country and it won't happen
[2:20:10.640 --> 2:20:15.800]  because most of us in the conservative, even in the democratic parties, will maintain the
[2:20:15.800 --> 2:20:21.440]  viability of the republic, Nancy's never understood the viability of the republic,
[2:20:21.440 --> 2:20:22.440]  she never knew the difference.
[2:20:22.440 --> 2:20:26.040]  Let's talk about Big Picture and who the players are with the democrats, the chai comms and
[2:20:26.040 --> 2:20:31.080]  how we stop this destabilization, Dr. Steve Pachinick on the other side, StevePachinick.com,
[2:20:31.080 --> 2:20:34.880]  please stay with us, excellent website, a lot of important videos and articles, you
[2:20:34.880 --> 2:20:42.520]  will get anywhere else, StevePachinick.com.
[2:20:42.520 --> 2:20:47.000]  What info wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:54.440]  word of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic, this is the battle for the
[2:20:54.440 --> 2:21:02.280]  future of humanity and now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate
[2:21:02.280 --> 2:21:09.080]  the planet, now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized, you
[2:21:09.080 --> 2:21:14.720]  must decide which side you are on, living in denial, having mastocone syndrome, learned
[2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:21.480]  help will only deliver you into misery, destruction and finally death, and this is a spiritual
[2:21:21.480 --> 2:21:28.200]  death we are talking about, not just a physical death, the delusions must end now, info wars
[2:21:28.200 --> 2:21:33.400]  was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy, most people
[2:21:33.400 --> 2:21:38.280]  that are aware of the new order decide to join it out of fear, they are truly fools,
[2:21:38.280 --> 2:21:43.760]  we must fight this or lose our souls.
[2:21:43.760 --> 2:21:48.600]  We are living in insanely dangerous times and I told folks going back three months ago
[2:21:48.600 --> 2:21:52.280]  I am not buying storeable food because I am worried about the COVID-19 virus, I am worried
[2:21:52.280 --> 2:21:56.520]  about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now it is admitted that a chain
[2:21:56.520 --> 2:22:00.600]  reaction has begun that has already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and
[2:22:00.600 --> 2:22:04.760]  ranches across the United States and it is even worse in the third world, so I hope Trump
[2:22:04.760 --> 2:22:08.600]  with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it, but with the election fraud and the
[2:22:08.600 --> 2:22:13.320]  COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on,
[2:22:13.320 --> 2:22:18.120]  now is the time to get storeable foods because they will last for 25 years, they are in easily
[2:22:18.120 --> 2:22:22.480]  totable bags, it is high quality food and it is good to have that box checked off to be
[2:22:22.480 --> 2:22:26.120]  ready and it funds the info wars, so we have storeable food available again, info wars
[2:22:26.120 --> 2:22:31.680]  store.com or call toll free triple A 253 3139 or whatever you do, get prepared and get ready
[2:22:31.680 --> 2:22:36.120]  again because the globalists want you dependent on them, they do not want you to be self sufficient,
[2:22:36.120 --> 2:22:41.880]  get your storeable food at infowarstore.com right now while you still can.
[2:22:41.880 --> 2:22:47.400]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the
[2:22:47.400 --> 2:22:52.440]  globalist out of their countries, that is why the new world order is instituting race
[2:22:52.440 --> 2:22:57.960]  war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local
[2:22:57.960 --> 2:23:04.960]  police and government and destroying essential services, this is an attempt to have society
[2:23:04.960 --> 2:23:09.120]  collapse and the globalists as they have done in the third world will come in and pick
[2:23:09.120 --> 2:23:14.920]  up the pieces, they must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank and the EU openly
[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:19.480]  saying they fund the police, the police have a lot of problems, we all have a lot of problems
[2:23:19.480 --> 2:23:23.960]  but this is our government and our local tabulary and believe me once the globalists have overthrown
[2:23:23.960 --> 2:23:28.600]  this country they are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process
[2:23:28.600 --> 2:23:33.360]  or freedom, the globalists believe communist China is the model of the world and they are
[2:23:33.360 --> 2:23:38.160]  orchestrating this entire thing, the people helping them are collaborators and are idiots
[2:23:38.160 --> 2:24:03.160]  and must be opposed, info wars dot com, you are listening to the alex jones show,
[2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:08.640]  dr steve pacinic of steve pacinic dot com author researcher for the state department psychological
[2:24:08.640 --> 2:24:13.520]  warfare, ran some major operations including regime change, we just joined us, I like him
[2:24:13.520 --> 2:24:17.120]  to start over so he is not up against the break with what we are witnessing with George
[2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:24.240]  Floyd, what the democrats are doing, the bowing, the kneeling, the mask, all of this classic
[2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:30.240]  cult programming behavior and what he expects them to pull next with 146 days out, you are
[2:24:30.240 --> 2:24:36.320]  a psychological warfare expert, you are a psychiatrist, you are also a veteran of these
[2:24:36.320 --> 2:24:41.640]  type of non-operations you ever launched, this looks like a communist style deal following
[2:24:41.640 --> 2:24:47.480]  Mao's cultural revolution, they even admit that, what are the democrats turning into,
[2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:50.800]  what are they doing, for people that aren't experts in this, what are we witnessing?
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:58.160]  What we are really witnessing is a mad magazine version of agitation propaganda and the reason
[2:24:58.160 --> 2:25:05.120]  I say that with a smile is because Nancy Pelosi is not very bright, neither are the leaders
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:10.240]  of the democratic party and what you are seeing is a parody of what agitation propaganda
[2:25:10.240 --> 2:25:15.360]  is supposed to be, people like myself who have been in the business of agitation propaganda,
[2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:21.080]  we normally create all kinds of disturbances and send things on fire and we know exactly
[2:25:21.080 --> 2:25:25.680]  what it is we want to do, we want to polarize the country to the extent that police force
[2:25:25.680 --> 2:25:34.160]  comes in and basically engages that populace in some form of covert or overt warfare.
[2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:41.240]  In this case, it's a complete disaster, number one George Floyd is the wrong example to deify
[2:25:41.240 --> 2:25:48.120]  or to make the key element of agitation propaganda, number one he's a felon, he's a career felon,
[2:25:48.120 --> 2:25:52.680]  what happened to him is unfortunate but it happens to all the felons and whether they
[2:25:52.680 --> 2:25:56.600]  are white and black, police have to do what they have to do.
[2:25:56.600 --> 2:26:01.000]  Let's get to the more important part, the reason this is occurring now is because of
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:05.960]  the coronavirus, the three months that should not have been shut down but nevertheless people
[2:26:05.960 --> 2:26:11.640]  are totally restless, there's need for agitation, there's need for them to get outside.
[2:26:11.640 --> 2:26:16.440]  So the democrats said, okay, we're going to use this and Millie, the millionaire, your
[2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:21.720]  person, the millennium Millie did an excellent job of explaining agitation propaganda.
[2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:26.880]  Number one, we get all the people necessary in order to protest, number two, we create
[2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:32.600]  a cause celebrity, in this case it's George Frey, a person who was killed.
[2:26:32.600 --> 2:26:38.320]  The third thing is we create all kinds of symbols that have, that should resonate with
[2:26:38.320 --> 2:26:39.320]  the public.
[2:26:39.320 --> 2:26:42.400]  Unfortunately, this is not the case in what's happening now.
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:48.520]  The democrats came in, the Obama people who are total sociopaths and quite ignorant really
[2:26:48.520 --> 2:26:54.280]  in how to create agitation propaganda are sponsoring this from the covert part.
[2:26:54.280 --> 2:26:59.200]  You've got the CI elements, you've got the FBI elements, you've got some of the other
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:04.280]  elements within our deep state, which is, you guys explained quite well.
[2:27:04.280 --> 2:27:06.240]  Now let me tell you who the leaders are.
[2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:08.480]  First, you have Alan Sharpton.
[2:27:08.480 --> 2:27:09.760]  I grew up in Harlem.
[2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:11.480]  I went to Book of T. Washington.
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:16.560]  You're looking at a Hispanic kid or a white guy who grew up in a black neighborhood.
[2:27:16.560 --> 2:27:21.200]  The Al Sharptons of the world, we wouldn't take them seriously, neither black nor white
[2:27:21.200 --> 2:27:24.400]  would have said to us, this guy, listen, get out of here.
[2:27:24.400 --> 2:27:25.480]  You're a punk.
[2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:26.880]  You never went to college.
[2:27:26.880 --> 2:27:29.080]  When you did go to college, you never finished it.
[2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:31.600]  You married your sister-in-law.
[2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:36.040]  And more importantly, what's not known, and this is important, is Al Sharpton has been
[2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:41.800]  a snitch for the FBI and the intelligent community for the past 40 to 50 years.
[2:27:41.800 --> 2:27:43.320]  Let me repeat it again.
[2:27:43.320 --> 2:27:49.560]  In Harlem, we would have taken Al Sharpton out because he was a snitch for the FBI, and
[2:27:49.560 --> 2:27:54.600]  he snitched on other black operatives, and he snitched on the Gambino family, the Genovese
[2:27:54.600 --> 2:27:58.760]  family, all the families that he was involved with, narcotics.
[2:27:58.760 --> 2:28:07.880]  Number two, we have Obama, a completely created CIA manchurian candidate who is so sociopathic,
[2:28:07.880 --> 2:28:09.200]  you have no idea.
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:14.720]  In a world where we had the Hillary Clinton's, the Bill Clinton's, already pretty good sociopaths,
[2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:17.960]  then you had Bush Jr., who was a dumb sociopath.
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:23.080]  Now you got Obama, whose every word he's told you is a complete lie.
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:25.000]  He was born a homosexual.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:31.520]  His father was CIA, and Kenya's mother was CIA, maternal grandmother, maternal grandfather,
[2:28:31.520 --> 2:28:32.520]  all CIA.
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:38.040]  He was a pathetic product of a pathetic CIA, namely John Brennan.
[2:28:38.040 --> 2:28:42.480]  Another failed operative, a Catholic operative who became a Muslim.
[2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:44.440]  So let's go down the list.
[2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:45.760]  Nancy Pelosi.
[2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:52.320]  We've talked about Nancy Pelosi before, 20, 30 years ago when she was lucid and attractive,
[2:28:52.320 --> 2:28:53.880]  she did some good things.
[2:28:53.880 --> 2:28:59.920]  However, as she's aged and became debilitated and somewhat senile, she's really trying to
[2:28:59.920 --> 2:29:02.360]  do what we call the last hurrah.
[2:29:02.360 --> 2:29:08.800]  So she's bending down, she's wearing kinty clothes, African clothes, and tries to assimilate
[2:29:08.800 --> 2:29:11.800]  what an African look, and it's absurd.
[2:29:11.800 --> 2:29:17.600]  The blacks in America, I find it offensive, but I find it so ridiculous that a bunch
[2:29:17.600 --> 2:29:23.640]  of other white guys, Jews and Christians, are following this nonsensical bowing down
[2:29:23.640 --> 2:29:25.080]  and praying.
[2:29:25.080 --> 2:29:30.000]  Are they not trying to launch a type of new religion, Dr. Pachennik, liberation theology
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  on steroids?
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:34.760]  Well, you're too sophisticated.
[2:29:34.760 --> 2:29:39.080]  Liberation theology actually came out of the Jesuits, you were brilliant to say that.
[2:29:39.080 --> 2:29:41.440]  And that was true in Latin America.
[2:29:41.440 --> 2:29:43.800]  She doesn't know what liberation theology is.
[2:29:43.800 --> 2:29:47.880]  She didn't even know what a democracy was and a republic.
[2:29:47.880 --> 2:29:51.400]  So you don't have that kind of insights that you had.
[2:29:51.400 --> 2:29:56.080]  What you're saying is it's all very infested and it looks very immature and very...
[2:29:56.080 --> 2:29:58.240]  It looks immature, it's pathetic.
[2:29:58.240 --> 2:30:01.240]  You go down the list, so who's next online?
[2:30:01.240 --> 2:30:03.080]  I've got Colin Powell.
[2:30:03.080 --> 2:30:05.320]  He says the president is a liar.
[2:30:05.320 --> 2:30:10.520]  Oh my God, Colin Powell, I've known you since the days you came out of Harlem and said you
[2:30:10.520 --> 2:30:13.120]  spoke Yiddish, you BS artist.
[2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:18.320]  I knew you when Weinberger brought you in the Nixon administration and made you a hero,
[2:30:18.320 --> 2:30:24.520]  although you lied on the lie and you let Private Kelly take the blame for the massacre.
[2:30:24.520 --> 2:30:31.120]  When you lied again, you pathological liar, when you were secretary of state about anthrax.
[2:30:31.120 --> 2:30:32.120]  And what does he say?
[2:30:32.120 --> 2:30:33.840]  It's called projection, my friend.
[2:30:33.840 --> 2:30:36.600]  He says the president lies.
[2:30:36.600 --> 2:30:42.480]  Really Colin Powell, you have to be the epitome of the liar and the pathetic general.
[2:30:42.480 --> 2:30:50.880]  Then I have General Mattiff, another what we call shit, Jerry Marine, 40 years unmarried,
[2:30:50.880 --> 2:30:52.280]  self-aggrandizing.
[2:30:52.280 --> 2:30:54.160]  What was he in the military field?
[2:30:54.160 --> 2:30:59.840]  Let's see, he was a Marine general and had an amphibious landing to a landlocked country
[2:30:59.840 --> 2:31:02.080]  like Afghanistan.
[2:31:02.080 --> 2:31:07.480]  And he almost had Osama bin Laden, but he couldn't quite capture him in Torah Bora.
[2:31:07.480 --> 2:31:11.520]  Then he was arrested when he was 19 years old on drug charges.
[2:31:11.520 --> 2:31:13.080]  Oh, let me see.
[2:31:13.080 --> 2:31:18.080]  This man created an image of himself as an intellectual, yet none of his papers are
[2:31:18.080 --> 2:31:19.480]  written by himself.
[2:31:19.480 --> 2:31:20.800]  I don't believe he went to any.
[2:31:20.800 --> 2:31:26.640]  I was about to say, when he talks, he comes off as the biggest fop fake who can't even
[2:31:26.640 --> 2:31:28.880]  string sentences together.
[2:31:28.880 --> 2:31:29.880]  You're correct.
[2:31:29.880 --> 2:31:37.040]  But you use that other word almost correctly, fop, he is a fake fop, he is totally a feat.
[2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:39.440]  And this is what I call the paper generals.
[2:31:39.440 --> 2:31:45.720]  These are guys who go out and they make themselves seem important, yet what do they really do?
[2:31:45.720 --> 2:31:49.800]  Trump has pulled out our men from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
[2:31:49.800 --> 2:31:55.720]  Well, yeah, you've got the architects of the fake Iraq wars and all of it saying Trump
[2:31:55.720 --> 2:31:58.840]  is a liar when it's the opposite.
[2:31:58.840 --> 2:32:01.520]  Trump neurotically says what he really thinks.
[2:32:01.520 --> 2:32:03.400]  That's exactly my point, Alex.
[2:32:03.400 --> 2:32:08.560]  That's why I said at the end, he said excuse, in French, we said those who excuse themselves
[2:32:08.560 --> 2:32:09.560]  accuse themselves.
[2:32:09.560 --> 2:32:16.680]  He killed more people in a lousy, stinking war in Afghanistan where we had no right to
[2:32:16.680 --> 2:32:17.680]  be.
[2:32:17.680 --> 2:32:20.440]  We were in the 70s and warned our people to stay out.
[2:32:20.440 --> 2:32:23.040]  Then he went into Iraq, he lost there.
[2:32:23.040 --> 2:32:26.240]  And so you've got General Dempsey also lost.
[2:32:26.240 --> 2:32:30.440]  But with General Dempsey, I have to give him an important plug.
[2:32:30.440 --> 2:32:35.440]  He was one of the few men and he never said it, but he helped us out and helped me out
[2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:40.160]  and the former assistant surgeon general to contain the Ebola epidemic.
[2:32:40.160 --> 2:32:46.160]  He never said a word, but he allowed me to send 3,000 troops into Sierra Leone and Liberia
[2:32:46.160 --> 2:32:50.000]  and he deserves the credit for allowing me to send 3,000 troops.
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:51.000]  Sure.
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:32:52.000]  What about Milley?
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:53.840]  I'm told by folks, Milley's good.
[2:32:53.840 --> 2:32:59.320]  Milley is very good, but basically his problem is that he has an association with not too
[2:32:59.320 --> 2:33:00.320]  good generals.
[2:33:00.320 --> 2:33:05.560]  And if I were he, I'd just walk out quietly and come back in another administration.
[2:33:05.560 --> 2:33:11.360]  This is a force and the force is that these generals should keep their mouth shut because
[2:33:11.360 --> 2:33:15.160]  that's what did you make of the Secretary of Defense saying Trump's wrong and maybe
[2:33:15.160 --> 2:33:17.680]  Trump was wrong to say insurrection act.
[2:33:17.680 --> 2:33:18.680]  Maybe that was...
[2:33:18.680 --> 2:33:19.680]  He is wrong.
[2:33:19.680 --> 2:33:20.680]  You know what?
[2:33:20.680 --> 2:33:24.000]  He may have been wrong, but his job was to keep his mouth quiet and the Esper went to
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:30.320]  West Point and then spent the rest of his battlefield as a process soldier doing the Heritage
[2:33:30.320 --> 2:33:35.680]  Foundation, the Center for Relations, never really been in combat, never really saw anything
[2:33:35.680 --> 2:33:36.680]  in a crisis.
[2:33:36.680 --> 2:33:37.680]  Well, stay there.
[2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:39.240]  Let's talk about what's really going on when we come back.
[2:33:39.240 --> 2:33:41.680]  Stay with us.
[2:33:41.680 --> 2:33:51.200]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[2:33:51.200 --> 2:33:58.960]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, Super Male Vitality, specifically
[2:33:58.960 --> 2:34:06.000]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  in males.

[2:35:43.200 --> 2:35:48.040]  The United States is not communist China. We don't have 3 million people in concentration
[2:35:48.040 --> 2:35:52.960]  camps. We don't blow up churches. We don't kill political dissidents and sell their
[2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:59.360]  organs. But all over the news, we see the U.N. Billable Indigates, WHO, mainstream corporate
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:05.480]  media praising communist China for their response. And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:09.800]  and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people, well then gee,
[2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:13.640]  we've got to do that. And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying we'll
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:18.840]  arrest you if you say Chinese virus. Well now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European
[2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:24.680]  virus. These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time
[2:36:24.680 --> 2:36:28.880]  because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:34.960]  power grab. The Resistance lives at Bandot Video at InfoWars.com. Spread those links
[2:36:34.960 --> 2:36:39.120]  and jam it down the censors' throats, and then we'll be able to defeat their operation
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:50.160]  that much quicker. Globalists have gotten away with their Russia
[2:36:50.160 --> 2:36:59.360]  Gate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the race riot hoax of
[2:36:59.360 --> 2:37:04.480]  2020. We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next. I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch
[2:37:04.480 --> 2:37:10.320]  of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war. It's going to be economic
[2:37:10.320 --> 2:37:16.520]  collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it, the globalists are attacking
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:21.160]  on every front. That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor
[2:37:21.160 --> 2:37:26.440]  InfoWars off here because they knew. When they launched this whole situation, they didn't
[2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:31.800]  want the people's voice to still be on air. But thanks to you and our crew, we are still
[2:37:31.800 --> 2:37:43.480]  on air. So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now, more than ever.
[2:37:43.480 --> 2:38:03.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:11.640]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex
[2:38:11.640 --> 2:38:15.880]  Jones. Okay, enough of me babbling. We only got two more segments with you. I'm sorry,
[2:38:15.880 --> 2:38:20.480]  we got you on late. We'll Skype this year. There's so much for you to talk about that
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:26.080]  used to be involved in psychological operations. To look at these, and to see the media is
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:32.880]  so unified and so much censorship and to see all the virtues signaling and just the escalation.
[2:38:32.880 --> 2:38:37.840]  And I've got articles here out of CBS News on InfoWars.com, homes displaying American
[2:38:37.840 --> 2:38:43.080]  flags being targeted by arsonists. And I see highways being taken over and people being
[2:38:43.080 --> 2:38:48.480]  attacked. I mean, I get it, you're saying it's backfiring. I hope you're right. And I understand
[2:38:48.480 --> 2:38:51.280]  that if they can get Trump to go out with a big military response, that maybe somebody
[2:38:51.280 --> 2:38:55.840]  gets killed and now, you know, with the adjuvant, they get what they want. But at a certain
[2:38:55.840 --> 2:38:59.440]  point, you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't. And I just really want Trump
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:03.920]  to win reelection in 146 days. What are the big issues we should be aware of? And why
[2:39:03.920 --> 2:39:08.520]  are you saying it's blowing up in their face?
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:15.520]  Basically, this is gone on for too long and it's not really working. What you're getting
[2:39:15.520 --> 2:39:21.840]  is a coverage of this area being burnt, that area, but it has no impact on the vitality
[2:39:21.840 --> 2:39:27.760]  of America. And what do I talk about vitality? We here in the South, the Midwest, the Southwest
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:33.560]  and the West, where you basically have Christian fundamental values and you have people who
[2:39:33.560 --> 2:39:37.640]  are workers. You're talking about the middle class, the real middle class. I'm not talking
[2:39:37.640 --> 2:39:41.640]  about those who have garnered wealth and then make believe they're liberals. I'm talking
[2:39:41.640 --> 2:39:45.840]  about people who go to work every day. They build a building. They're in construction.
[2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:51.280]  They're building roads. That's going on through all of America. That's what I'm seeing here.
[2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:55.000]  This is in the South of Florida, where we're in the North Central part of Florida, but
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:58.400]  we have a very active economy that never, never shows up.
[2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:01.800]  You're saying they're trying to demoralize us, but the state of the economy is strong
[2:40:01.800 --> 2:40:05.880]  and the economy is coming back faster. So the left now wants to keep us locked down
[2:40:05.880 --> 2:40:09.400]  with COVID. How do we challenge that fraud?
[2:40:09.400 --> 2:40:14.840]  Because basically by bringing the economy back, which is what Trump has done and the
[2:40:14.840 --> 2:40:20.080]  stock market believes the economy will come back, even though we declared, quote, an official
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:27.640]  recession, meaning that there were two periods of time where we had a decreased growth. That's
[2:40:27.640 --> 2:40:33.560]  not relevant to what's really happening because we have pent up capacity and the planes will
[2:40:33.560 --> 2:40:38.960]  start flying. Hotels will be filled up. The beaches will be filled up. Small businesses
[2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:44.600]  will reconstitute themselves. Unfortunately, some that went under will have to refinance
[2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:49.960]  themselves and come back up. But the fact that he had provided PPP, that he had provided
[2:40:49.960 --> 2:40:55.800]  the money and Mnuchin did a brilliant job of providing all that capital, we're back
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:40:59.280]  and forth. So what do we do when the left though keeps
[2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:02.960]  taking regular deaths and putting them in the COVID column and tries to bring the hysteria
[2:41:02.960 --> 2:41:06.240]  back in the fall? How does Trump counter that?
[2:41:06.240 --> 2:41:11.840]  He doesn't. What he does is basically to allow them to self-destruct. The American public
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:17.000]  is a lot smarter than what anybody thinks. And that's what you said. That's what I said.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:22.080]  What he basically has to do is to do exactly what he did. I'm talking about the economy.
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:27.000]  I'm going to bring back the economy. I want an infrastructure capacity. In other words,
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:31.960]  he has to bring out the fact that we're going to be building roads, highways, tunnels. I
[2:41:31.960 --> 2:41:37.000]  think that'll be important. At the same time, he has to reconfigure some of this White House.
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:40.640]  I don't want to get in the particulars, but he needs people who are a lot sharper like
[2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:42.640]  Mnuchin. Well, he needs to get rid of Jared Kushner,
[2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:46.880]  doesn't he? Well, it's up to him. The family issue is
[2:41:46.880 --> 2:41:49.320]  a very delicate issue. No, no. I've not been at war with Kushner,
[2:41:49.320 --> 2:41:53.440]  but I really trust Tucker Carlson, and he's been on the inside. And he tells me that Kushner
[2:41:53.440 --> 2:41:57.760]  is literally the worst thing on the planet. All right. I have no problem with that. I
[2:41:57.760 --> 2:42:01.960]  say that up front, but that's his family, but he has to get rid of Jared Kushner. He has
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:07.600]  to get rid of Vesper. He has to rebuild a team that's not based on the neocons. When he brought
[2:42:07.600 --> 2:42:13.360]  in George John Bolton, that was a very bad signal to me. And in fact, he had to pay for
[2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:18.880]  that for many months later. The issue now is he has to bring in economists and people
[2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:25.080]  who are involved in companies where they are big, the Boeing's, the Lockheed Martin's.
[2:42:25.080 --> 2:42:30.760]  I don't care about the military industrial complex. It has to come back online very effectively.
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:36.800]  And at the same time that he has to assign, I would put women entrepreneurs who can build
[2:42:36.800 --> 2:42:42.600]  up the small businesses. Now, the small business would be a key element of his new agenda. Small
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:48.120]  business means any business below 500 million. And I would recruit women who come from different
[2:42:48.120 --> 2:42:53.760]  parts of the area to show that he's interested in feminine entrepreneurship and that we're
[2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:57.640]  interested in serial entrepreneurship. You know, that's a great idea. He tried that and
[2:42:57.640 --> 2:43:01.480]  Facebook's been banning his ads. What should Trump do about the internet censorship? He
[2:43:01.480 --> 2:43:05.280]  says he's going to do something. Do you have any sources on what he's planning to do? No,
[2:43:05.280 --> 2:43:09.800]  I have no sources, but I know very well that Trump will do what he's always done, which
[2:43:09.800 --> 2:43:15.560]  is to shut down what doesn't work. And that means Facebook and Twitter, Dorsey's online,
[2:43:15.560 --> 2:43:20.720]  Zuckerberg is online for that. And he will come in and make sure that we have freedom
[2:43:20.720 --> 2:43:26.840]  of expression. And if the government has to take over YouTube or Twitter or Facebook,
[2:43:26.840 --> 2:43:30.800]  I have no problem with it. I don't either because they're already the equivalent of
[2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:34.480]  a government. They're any more powerful than the NSA. They're just doing whatever they
[2:43:34.480 --> 2:43:38.680]  want, working with China. What the hell? Yeah, but more importantly, what I've said,
[2:43:38.680 --> 2:43:45.080]  and you said before for 25, 30 years, it was DARPA that created the internet. I was trained
[2:43:45.080 --> 2:43:52.400]  by defense advanced research project agencies in the 70s at MIT. It was started by DARPA.
[2:43:52.400 --> 2:43:57.320]  It was started by the CIA. And this has to do with the province of the government has
[2:43:57.320 --> 2:44:01.680]  nothing to do with Zuckerberg. There's nothing to do with Bill Gates has nothing. And by
[2:44:01.680 --> 2:44:06.160]  the way, they know they're just frontmen and placeholders with why are they? I guess it's
[2:44:06.160 --> 2:44:14.280]  a rogue coup trying to like take over our infrastructure. Well, on the surface, it looks like a rogue
[2:44:14.280 --> 2:44:19.640]  coup, but in reality, it's not a coup at all because they've been watching too many movies
[2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:24.080]  where they think if they can disrupt a certain number of cities, which by the way happened
[2:44:24.080 --> 2:44:28.800]  to be liberal. But by the way, they're really in trouble. And by the way, they're led by
[2:44:28.800 --> 2:44:36.520]  people like the Blasio who just assumed a $7 billion debt service for New York City,
[2:44:36.520 --> 2:44:41.920]  which is going into bankruptcy. And on top of that, he's putting $7 more billion dollars
[2:44:41.920 --> 2:44:47.360]  where I calculated he's going to pay $11 billion in interest. This is where you have the self
[2:44:47.360 --> 2:44:53.560]  destructive. I agree with you. The blue states are committing Shepa coup, but I'm worried
[2:44:53.560 --> 2:44:56.600]  about them dragging us with them. Why do they seem so confident?
[2:44:56.600 --> 2:45:02.160]  They're confident because the arrogance of the liberal has always been the sine qua
[2:45:02.160 --> 2:45:07.480]  nona being a liberal. That means you garner your wealth, whatever you did in before like
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:14.400]  Nancy Pelosi, corruption. She was the daughter of Mafioso and basically garner her wealth
[2:45:14.400 --> 2:45:19.000]  and then goes out and make believe that she's a liberal, that she cares about blacks. And
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:23.240]  it's a holier than now activity of a bunch of sociopathic criminals.
[2:45:23.240 --> 2:45:29.520]  Correct. And that's what sociopathy is. It's not an accident. You have Colin Powell, black.
[2:45:29.520 --> 2:45:38.200]  You have Susan Rice, sociopath, black. Obama, sociopath, black. Condoleezza Rice, lied,
[2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:44.440]  black. Am I saying only blacks are sociopaths? But I can say what I want about growing up
[2:45:44.440 --> 2:45:49.360]  in Harlem and going to school at Booker T Washington because I don't know any other
[2:45:49.360 --> 2:45:53.960]  so-called liberals who did and I didn't come out to be liberal. I didn't come out to love
[2:45:53.960 --> 2:45:59.600]  whites or blacks. I just treat people as they are, but I'm going to call a spade a spade.
[2:45:59.600 --> 2:46:05.920]  And that's exactly what's been happening. And Nancy Pelosi is a disaster. She will destroy
[2:46:05.920 --> 2:46:13.200]  the entire political liberal establishment along with, guess what? On top of that, I'm
[2:46:13.200 --> 2:46:20.080]  putting a senile white man to run for president. You and I could not have created that scenario
[2:46:20.080 --> 2:46:21.080]  in a fiction book.
[2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:26.840]  You said two years ago he has cognitive degeneration. Now that's confirmed. Exactly. Who would come
[2:46:26.840 --> 2:46:30.800]  up with a horse in a race that can hardly walk?
[2:46:30.800 --> 2:46:36.480]  I have no idea. But when I said it years ago, everybody thought I was nuts. No, I'm a neurologist,
[2:46:36.480 --> 2:46:44.680]  psychiatry, board examiner. He is senile. So this is the epitome of the democratic establishment.
[2:46:44.680 --> 2:46:51.320]  Horse, self-destruction, and leak, which means they want to destroy what the Republicans
[2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:55.440]  and particularly Trump. Now let me tell you why Trump is a problem for them. Trump says
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:47:01.120]  what he wants to say. I've known about Trump for 30 years. He can say and dance whatever
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:05.880]  he wants, but guess what? He got paid for saying what he wants. That is, on the reality
[2:47:05.880 --> 2:47:10.800]  show he could say whatever absurdities he wanted to. But the reality of Trump is what
[2:47:10.800 --> 2:47:16.800]  the Democrats don't understand. People like me and you do understand. He gets things done.
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:23.200]  He eliminated regulation. He got our economy back on place. But the first time in our history
[2:47:23.200 --> 2:47:30.320]  we shot an American rocket. Think of that. An American rocket into space from an American
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:36.560]  site. That means for 40 years with Obama, the Clintons, the Bushes, we had to use Russian
[2:47:36.560 --> 2:47:43.920]  rockets at the cost of 75 million each shot to go into space and from Kazakhstan. Here's
[2:47:43.920 --> 2:47:48.080]  a president of the United States says, you know what? I'm going to make space war and
[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:51.640]  I'm going to make NASA the most important. And I know folks that were there. He called
[2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:57.320]  Muskin and said, do it and cut the regulations. He did it. In one year, an American rocket
[2:47:57.320 --> 2:48:01.400]  in American space with American. Let me tell you this. I'm sure you know this. The guys
[2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:04.520]  that told me this were in the meeting. I said, this is classified. They said, it's okay.
[2:48:04.520 --> 2:48:09.160]  You can say they've got a deal him and must to actually in like a year. They've already
[2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:13.560]  got robots up on the moon with these 3D printers and they're already building a base on the
[2:48:13.560 --> 2:48:18.600]  dark side of the moon for them for the Mars shot. Now that they told you that that's correct.
[2:48:18.600 --> 2:48:22.720]  They're going from that and they're going straight into Mars. That's correct. They've
[2:48:22.720 --> 2:48:27.160]  already got robots doing it. Well, hold on. We're going to stay right there. We'll be
[2:48:27.160 --> 2:48:34.520]  right back. Stay with us. The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporates
[2:48:34.520 --> 2:48:41.320]  media and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression. In fact, we're already
[2:48:41.320 --> 2:48:45.840]  into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world. But it's critical
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:52.040]  to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be. A month
[2:48:52.040 --> 2:48:57.320]  of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[2:48:57.320 --> 2:49:01.760]  That's what we've always said. It's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[2:49:01.760 --> 2:49:07.040]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:12.960]  They've admitted all of this. So remember, how does in full wars continue years and decades
[2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:17.920]  in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen because we're following
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:23.200]  the globalist blueprint and their battle plan. And yes, it's dystopic. And yes, it's scary.
[2:49:23.200 --> 2:49:27.680]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary. It's time
[2:49:27.680 --> 2:49:33.960]  to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[2:49:33.960 --> 2:49:38.520]  We're living in insanely dangerous times. And I've told folks going back three months
[2:49:38.520 --> 2:49:42.320]  ago, I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus. I'm
[2:49:42.320 --> 2:49:46.720]  worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse. And now it's admitted that a chain
[2:49:46.720 --> 2:49:51.240]  reaction has begun. It's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches
[2:49:51.240 --> 2:49:55.120]  across the United States. And it's even worse in the third world. So I hope Trump, with
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:59.840]  his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it. But with the election fraud and the COVID-19,
[2:49:59.840 --> 2:50:04.080]  all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on, now is the
[2:50:04.080 --> 2:50:08.880]  time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years. They're in easily totable
[2:50:08.880 --> 2:50:13.240]  bags. It's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready.
[2:50:13.240 --> 2:50:17.120]  And it funds the InfoWars. So we have storeable food available again. InfoWarsStore.com or
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:20.800]  call toll free, triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, whatever you do, get
[2:50:20.800 --> 2:50:24.960]  prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent on them. They do not want
[2:50:24.960 --> 2:50:29.400]  you to be self-sufficient. Get your storeable food at InfoWarsStore.com right now while you
[2:50:29.400 --> 2:50:30.840]  still can.
[2:50:30.840 --> 2:50:49.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:49.240 --> 2:50:53.640]  Our final segment of our secret clinic went about him back up for an hour, two hours. Soon
[2:50:53.640 --> 2:50:57.520]  to cover the whole waterfront and to take calls while Joseph Watson is about to take
[2:50:57.520 --> 2:51:02.480]  over. But suddenly we've been told there's no human future. It's all going to just be
[2:51:02.480 --> 2:51:07.760]  us here in virtual reality, but Trump is definitely with Elon Musk, who got that big, biggest
[2:51:07.760 --> 2:51:12.000]  heavy lifting rocket in the world up into space, big coup. And it's, you know, we're
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:16.440]  back in space. America is going to release all these suppressed technologies, disruptive
[2:51:16.440 --> 2:51:20.200]  technologies as they're called. That's why a lot of the corrupt power structures are
[2:51:20.200 --> 2:51:24.720]  so upset that a lot of other groups are very, very excited. And I was told by folks that
[2:51:24.720 --> 2:51:28.400]  we're in the meetings with the president and Musk, and I was told, go ahead and talk about
[2:51:28.400 --> 2:51:32.400]  it, that they've already got a little base on the dark side of the moon. They've got
[2:51:32.400 --> 2:51:36.640]  3D printers ready. They've got a bunch of other stuff to do a test rocket to Mars. In
[2:51:36.640 --> 2:51:40.200]  the next couple of years, they're just going to announce it unmanned, and then they're
[2:51:40.200 --> 2:51:44.000]  going to have man to go. And then the excitement around that is exactly what we need. So in
[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:49.600]  closing, Dr. Pachennick, how important is humans going back into space?
[2:51:49.600 --> 2:51:54.000]  Exceedingly important. Let me put it this way. I want people to think of the following.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:52:01.960]  You're putting two men into a capsule, which is going at 17,000 miles per hour, Mach 2,
[2:52:01.960 --> 2:52:07.960]  and at the same time, they're traveling for 19 hours straight right into space. From that
[2:52:07.960 --> 2:52:14.400]  point on, we have to get to Mars, which is many, many weeks away from the moon. And that
[2:52:14.400 --> 2:52:21.120]  becomes an imperative dynamic for Trump. Trump will increase the amount of money and the
[2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:29.040]  amount of allocations that will go to the space warfare, also the missiles, and our spaceships.
[2:52:29.040 --> 2:52:34.320]  He's committed to that. Secondly, Trump is committed to increasing the funding of our
[2:52:34.320 --> 2:52:40.280]  infrastructure. He will start putting money out. And I think once he gets reelected, you
[2:52:40.280 --> 2:52:44.440]  will see tunnels, bridges, and people going back to work.
[2:52:44.440 --> 2:52:48.200]  The beauty of our republic, and they have to understand this, we've been through many
[2:52:48.200 --> 2:52:55.200]  revolutions and internal disruptions. The problem I have is that, unfortunately, the
[2:52:55.200 --> 2:53:04.120]  African American or the black is used as the model of inefficiency or being the scapegoat.
[2:53:04.120 --> 2:53:10.120]  That's pathetic, and that's arrogant, and that's absolutely incorrect because the blacks
[2:53:10.120 --> 2:53:14.320]  have improved over the past 30 years. They're in the middle class. They're working. They
[2:53:14.320 --> 2:53:19.960]  have their own businesses, and they could care less for what the liberals have to say.
[2:53:19.960 --> 2:53:24.760]  What has to happen if we're going to have a dynamic relationship in politics is that
[2:53:24.760 --> 2:53:31.880]  we need a completely new, newly constituted democratic party. But that's not my problem.
[2:53:31.880 --> 2:53:37.000]  That's the problem of the democrats. If you keep all those old Jewish men in, the old
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:43.080]  Italians, it's like the mafia. It's where Maya Lansky and Longings Willman and Luciano
[2:53:43.080 --> 2:53:48.680]  all got together, but it's antiquated. That's what you have with Nancy Pelosi and Schumer.
[2:53:48.680 --> 2:53:54.760]  It's basically a mob, the old Italian Jewish mob. It's antiquated. Trump doesn't represent
[2:53:54.760 --> 2:53:59.360]  that. Ironically, he comes from New York, but he's not liked by anybody. He was never
[2:53:59.360 --> 2:54:04.960]  in the Shishi public. He's a multi-billionaire. What he is is he's an individualist, and he
[2:54:04.960 --> 2:54:11.640]  treats you as an individualist. The irony, and what I'm glad to have seen, is that Mike
[2:54:11.640 --> 2:54:18.520]  Pence, the vice president, has really come forward both as an executor and executive
[2:54:18.520 --> 2:54:25.280]  of the COVID problem and the space warfare and the space relationship. He's come forth
[2:54:25.280 --> 2:54:31.000]  as a very effective candidate to become president of the United States. I'm pleased by that
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:35.560]  because it could be Trump for another four years, and after that, it'll be eight years
[2:54:35.560 --> 2:54:37.160]  of Mike Pence.
[2:54:37.160 --> 2:54:42.040]  But he said that I'm saying it only because I do have faith in our republic, and those
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:47.000]  elements that are trying to destroy our republic, they're not relevant. The only reason they're
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:52.840]  relevant is much sound and fury, which signifies nothing. And in effect, they know this is
[2:54:52.840 --> 2:54:57.960]  the end of their own entourage and their own little kabuki because it's painful.
[2:54:57.960 --> 2:55:00.760]  And you're saying, though, from all the folks you know and different intelligence agencies
[2:55:00.760 --> 2:55:06.080]  everywhere else, who are patriots overall, they're done with the old system. It's done,
[2:55:06.080 --> 2:55:08.600]  no matter what they pull, it's not going to work.
[2:55:08.600 --> 2:55:13.400]  Exactly, because, look, are we going to use tanks and airplanes in the future? No, we're
[2:55:13.400 --> 2:55:19.680]  going to use cyber command. So what becomes important? National Geospatial Agency, NGA,
[2:55:19.680 --> 2:55:25.000]  cyber command. Which general is important? A general called Nakasone, who's now the head
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  of cyber command.
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  All right, steppichining.com. Unfortunately, we're out of time. Always amazing. Please
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:35.400]  join us again soon. Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over and he is ready, ready
[2:55:35.400 --> 2:55:39.920]  to knock a grand slam.
[2:55:39.920 --> 2:55:47.760]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System. The first of its kind, pure, nascent, atomic iodine
[2:55:47.760 --> 2:55:53.400]  that can be delivered through a spray bottle. The next level of innovation of X2 is here,
[2:55:53.400 --> 2:55:58.800]  introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray. The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great
[2:55:58.800 --> 2:56:03.480]  on the go. When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house. It's great at work,
[2:56:03.480 --> 2:56:08.080]  but this is great for the car. It's great to keep with you. And again, it's also good
[2:56:08.080 --> 2:56:12.640]  for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the
[2:56:12.640 --> 2:56:17.360]  stomach. We're really excited about it. It's 33% off out of the gates. It was listeners
[2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:21.840]  idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists
[2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:25.880]  and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body
[2:56:25.880 --> 2:56:30.840]  in a new and in some ways, even better way. Get your Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine
[2:56:30.840 --> 2:56:37.840]  spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent
[2:56:37.840 --> 2:56:48.600]  iodine for yourself. Transmuting Worldwide from the summit.new studios in the United
[2:56:48.600 --> 2:56:58.720]  Kingdom, you're listening to Paul Joseph Watson. Well, the Cultural Revolution continues
[2:56:58.720 --> 2:57:04.800]  the erasure of history continues today in the UK and in other European cities. We've
[2:57:04.800 --> 2:57:11.360]  seen yet more statues be faced, more statues removed. They're now removing TV shows because
[2:57:11.360 --> 2:57:16.640]  back in the day, they weren't seen as as offensive as they are now. But as the BBC said earlier
[2:57:16.640 --> 2:57:22.720]  in an article, times have changed. Now they're literally going back into their on demand
[2:57:22.720 --> 2:57:30.320]  service and removing TV shows from 15 years ago, because some people are offended today.
[2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:36.840]  Heinrich Heiner, the German playwright once wrote, where they burn books, they will in
[2:57:36.840 --> 2:57:44.400]  the end also burn people. Now the past few days in the UK, we've seen statues being pulled
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:48.920]  down, dragged into the river. How long before they start dragging people into the river?
[2:57:48.920 --> 2:57:53.800]  Well, because everyone's racist, right? Everyone who disagrees with me is racist, so why not
[2:57:53.800 --> 2:58:00.200]  people? And I made the point earlier that given that much of history is now digitized
[2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:05.000]  and therefore prone to woke revisionism, you know, we've literally got Wikipedia being
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:10.520]  edited in real time to hide history. We've got the way back machine on the internet being
[2:58:10.520 --> 2:58:17.080]  changed to delete old content that was on the internet. Given the history is now digitized,
[2:58:17.080 --> 2:58:21.040]  at least much of it, don't be surprised if the mob starts burning books and museums
[2:58:21.040 --> 2:58:28.160]  next. They literally are going to get to that stage where they have mass bonfires of books
[2:58:28.160 --> 2:58:32.800]  in the streets. They're going to start burning museums down because they contain offensive
[2:58:32.800 --> 2:58:37.520]  things. They all will move the statues to the museum. No, still offensive. They need
[2:58:37.520 --> 2:58:42.840]  to go. They will start attacking museums, mark my words. And of course, lefty academics
[2:58:42.840 --> 2:58:50.200]  and historians will applaud it as a courageous act of progressivism. So what's been happening
[2:58:50.200 --> 2:58:56.840]  today? We'll start in Belgium. Headline Belgian city removes statue of longest serving king
[2:58:56.840 --> 2:59:02.360]  after it was defaced by Black Lives Matter protesters. This was in the Belgian city of
[2:59:02.360 --> 2:59:07.600]  Antwerp, which if you look at the population of Antwerp, the demographics, very interesting
[2:59:07.600 --> 2:59:13.760]  correlation after Black Lives Matter protesters in the Belgian city of Antwerp defaced the
[2:59:13.760 --> 2:59:19.760]  statue of King Leopold II Belgium's longest reigning monarch. Authorities removed it and
[2:59:19.760 --> 2:59:25.800]  said it will be put in a museum. As you can see, it was dogged with paint, the statue
[2:59:25.800 --> 2:59:32.280]  in front of the church in Antwerp, Belgium, prompting its immediate removal by local authorities.
[2:59:32.280 --> 2:59:38.240]  However, according to your hand, the man, spokesman for Antwerp's mayor Bart de Vever,
[2:59:38.240 --> 2:59:42.960]  the statue will not be returned to its original position after restoration and will instead
[2:59:42.960 --> 2:59:48.120]  likely end up in a museum. And since this article went up, I've literally seen video
[2:59:48.120 --> 2:59:55.400]  after video of Congolese migrants climbing the top, all these other statues in Antwerp
[2:59:55.400 --> 3:00:02.520]  in other cities in Belgium, defacing them, demanding their immediate removal. Now, this
[3:00:02.520 --> 3:00:07.840]  official said because of renovation work plan for 2023 in the square in which it was placed,
[3:00:07.840 --> 3:00:11.520]  the statue will not be replaced. Of course, that's the excuse. He went on to say it will
[3:00:11.520 --> 3:00:18.080]  probably become part of the museum collection. So, consigned to history, the statue of Belgium's
[3:00:18.080 --> 3:00:23.680]  longest serving king. They started with the slave traders. Now they're moving on to their
[3:00:23.680 --> 3:00:29.840]  literal kings and queens that are on the throne for decades and decades, because of course,
[3:00:29.840 --> 3:00:36.360]  he was a colonizer. An online petition created by teenage Congolese migrant calling for all
[3:00:36.360 --> 3:00:43.120]  kingly upholster second statues to be removed now has 60,000 signatures. So those, the rest
[3:00:43.120 --> 3:00:48.400]  of them in other cities in Belgium may not remain standing along. And this is the key
[3:00:48.400 --> 3:00:55.400]  point. Apparently, Belgium is so racist that millions of migrants chose to live there.
[3:00:55.400 --> 3:01:03.080]  53.2% of residents in Antwerp, Belgium's most populous are now of immigrant origin.
[3:01:03.080 --> 3:01:08.200]  So literally more than half the population is of immigrant origin, and they start removing
[3:01:08.200 --> 3:01:14.720]  the city's history. Some kind of connection there. Now, if you look at what's been happening
[3:01:14.720 --> 3:01:21.060]  in Antwerp over the past couple of years, as I point out in this article, with the mass
[3:01:21.060 --> 3:01:28.240]  deluge of migrants that's taken place since 2015 from the refugee wave, it's become a
[3:01:28.240 --> 3:01:33.800]  somewhat more violent place. Back in October 2018, a 68-year-old man in Turnau, Antwerp
[3:01:33.800 --> 3:01:40.400]  had his face broken in 11 places. After receiving a vicious beating from migrants, why was he
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:45.760]  beaten because they were offended about how his dog smelled? He was beaten to within an
[3:01:45.760 --> 3:01:52.360]  inch of his life. Cultural enrichment strikes again. Earlier that year, a dozen migrants
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:57.200]  in Antwerp pelted a handicapped elderly lady with large stones while calling her a dirty
[3:01:57.200 --> 3:02:04.240]  smelly Belgian during an alarming attack. These are the new citizens of Antwerp. First,
[3:02:04.240 --> 3:02:10.640]  it was statues of slavers. Now it's longest-serving kings. What's next? Well, what's next in the
[3:02:10.640 --> 3:02:17.080]  United Kingdom is a statue which was on the east docks of London, and this happened just
[3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:24.480]  about an hour ago, two hours ago. It was on private property. This was a statue of somebody
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:28.400]  who wasn't even directly involved in the slave trade. It was his family that was involved
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:32.960]  in the slave trade. And because this statue is next to the River Thames, which was used
[3:02:32.960 --> 3:02:37.880]  to import goods during the slave trade, that statue has been removed. This is a statue
[3:02:37.880 --> 3:02:44.600]  of Robert Milligan, removed from West India Key in East London. They had what looks like
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:50.140]  a little ceremony. They had a JCB tractor turn up and yank it down because it was on
[3:02:50.140 --> 3:02:54.760]  private property. And of course, the owner of the land immediately cooked after seeing
[3:02:54.760 --> 3:02:59.560]  the footage here out of Bristol a couple of days ago. And this is what happened that you're
[3:02:59.560 --> 3:03:05.400]  seeing on your screen right now. It was owned by a private land owner that owned this piece
[3:03:05.400 --> 3:03:09.560]  of land. By the way, this is in front of a museum, which is all about slavery. So the
[3:03:09.560 --> 3:03:14.760]  statue is literally in front of a museum. It's basically part of the museum land, but
[3:03:14.760 --> 3:03:19.200]  it was removed anyway. Is this going to go to a basement in the museum? Are they going
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:23.360]  to hide it away? Or are they just going to throw it in the River Thames? So you have
[3:03:23.360 --> 3:03:29.160]  that happening. By the way, in central London Parliament Square today, yet another mob has
[3:03:29.160 --> 3:03:34.840]  surrounded the statue of Winston Churchill, which of course was defaced horrifically on
[3:03:34.840 --> 3:03:39.700]  Sunday. And the people who tried to protect it were moved on by the police, allowing the
[3:03:39.700 --> 3:03:45.280]  mob to come in and attack it. The exact same thing is happening today. You see this footage
[3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:51.920]  out of the Saturday incident where there are a group of football lads, they call them protecting
[3:03:51.920 --> 3:03:57.400]  this statue. The police deliberately removed those trying to protect the statue, left it
[3:03:57.400 --> 3:04:03.960]  vulnerable to attack by the mob. Thankfully, groups of volunteers cleaned off the graffiti,
[3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:11.160]  but now today the mob is back. Once again, to desecrate the statue of Winston Churchill,
[3:04:11.160 --> 3:04:19.880]  the arch-racist who literally fought off the Nazi war machine. Meanwhile, Guido Forks reports
[3:04:19.880 --> 3:04:25.000]  left erected oppressive statues. It says while the left are busy trying to tear down statues
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  of Britain's history, their opposition to oppressive statues is very newly found. In
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:35.640]  2017, Manchester Council permitted artist Bill Collins to erect a statue of Engels, who by
[3:04:35.640 --> 3:04:40.360]  the way used child labour in its factories. They don't care about that. They had been
[3:04:40.360 --> 3:04:45.080]  torn down and dismantled by Ukrainians after their liberation from decades of communist
[3:04:45.080 --> 3:04:51.000]  oppression and genocide. Perhaps given the current climate lefty activists will now reconsider
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:56.560]  the offensive statue. And they've set up a website, which is being shared by all the
[3:04:56.560 --> 3:05:00.920]  left-wing activists on Twitter, demanding that all these different statues around the
[3:05:00.920 --> 3:05:07.040]  country be removed. One of those statues, headline, leftists want to topple statue of
[3:05:07.040 --> 3:05:12.080]  British Prime Minister, whose government ended slavery. Yes, one of the statues on the list
[3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:17.360]  that they want to remove was literally the Prime Minister of Britain, when we ended slavery
[3:05:17.360 --> 3:05:26.080]  throughout the British Empire. This is Charles II Earl Grey, former British Prime Minister,
[3:05:26.080 --> 3:05:30.960]  and since the toppling of a statue in Bristol of slaver Edward Colston and the desecration
[3:05:30.960 --> 3:05:35.440]  of Winston Churchill statue in London, Black Lives Matter supporters are salivating the
[3:05:35.440 --> 3:05:41.520]  prospect of what historical monuments they can tear down next. And Charles Grey, II Earl
[3:05:41.520 --> 3:05:46.960]  of Grey, a longtime leader of multiple reform movements under whose government slavery was
[3:05:46.960 --> 3:05:53.720]  abolished in the British Empire, is next on the list. This Prime Minister literally set
[3:05:53.720 --> 3:06:02.120]  aside 40% of Britain's GDP to buy slaves and then free the slaves. But they still want
[3:06:02.120 --> 3:06:08.800]  to tear down his statue because part of that money went to pay off slave owners with reparations.
[3:06:08.800 --> 3:06:14.000]  So even though he literally oversaw the movement that became the first government in the world
[3:06:14.000 --> 3:06:19.280]  to abolish slavery, which by the way, still goes on in many countries of the world, none
[3:06:19.280 --> 3:06:25.200]  of which are white. Now they want to tear down his statue. Christopher Snowden tweeted
[3:06:25.200 --> 3:06:30.720]  they want to topple the statue of the guy who abolished slavery. Now London Mayor Sateek
[3:06:30.720 --> 3:06:35.960]  Khan wants more London landmarks removed to reflect diversity. We'll get into it more
[3:06:35.960 --> 3:06:42.240]  after the break summit.news.go away. The people of the world have awakened to globalism. And
[3:06:42.240 --> 3:06:47.800]  so populist movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries. That's why the New
[3:06:47.800 --> 3:06:53.520]  World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about
[3:06:53.520 --> 3:07:00.000]  overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services. This is
[3:07:00.000 --> 3:07:05.120]  an attempt to have society collapse. And the globalist as they've done in the third world
[3:07:05.120 --> 3:07:10.400]  will come in and pick up the pieces. We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank
[3:07:10.400 --> 3:07:15.480]  and the EU openly saying they fund the police. The police have a lot of problems. We all
[3:07:15.480 --> 3:07:20.000]  have a lot of problems. But this is our government and our localist tabulary. And believe me,
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:24.640]  once the globalists have overthrown this country, they're going to put in a real police state
[3:07:24.640 --> 3:07:28.080]  where you have no due process or freedom. The globalist belief coming to China is the
[3:07:28.080 --> 3:07:33.080]  model of the world. And they are orchestrating this entire thing. The people helping them
[3:07:33.080 --> 3:07:38.080]  are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed. Infowars.com.
[3:07:38.080 --> 3:07:42.600]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[3:07:42.600 --> 3:07:43.600]  Hello. Can you hear me?
[3:07:43.600 --> 3:07:44.600]  I sure can, sir. Thank you.
[3:07:44.600 --> 3:07:50.280]  Hey, Alex. Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you. Go and it's a pleasure to
[3:07:50.280 --> 3:07:51.280]  be talking right now.
[3:07:51.280 --> 3:07:53.280]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[3:07:53.280 --> 3:07:58.360]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver and two
[3:07:58.360 --> 3:08:03.960]  before us have changed the way I drive. Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple
[3:08:03.960 --> 3:08:11.800]  of us. We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans. We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and
[3:08:11.800 --> 3:08:16.000]  Rolla. And I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar. And I just want to
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:17.000]  thank you for that, man.
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:21.560]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long term high quality energy powder
[3:08:21.560 --> 3:08:25.240]  there is. So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country. He didn't want his
[3:08:25.240 --> 3:08:28.360]  name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for
[3:08:28.360 --> 3:08:32.160]  this formulation just for the design of it. And we believe it is the best, strongest,
[3:08:32.160 --> 3:08:35.960]  but healthiest energy out there. And you're saying that it's made your life better. So
[3:08:35.960 --> 3:08:42.680]  that means a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you.
[3:08:42.680 --> 3:08:45.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:45.360 --> 3:09:07.160]  The new form of government that we now seem to be under, if you can call it government,
[3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:13.360]  is what the Greeks called oclocracy. And if you look this up on Wikipedia, it's termed
[3:09:13.360 --> 3:09:19.840]  as a form of mob rule, which is the rule of government by mob or mass of people, or the
[3:09:19.840 --> 3:09:25.440]  intimidation of legitimate authorities, which is what we've seen over the past week with
[3:09:25.440 --> 3:09:32.800]  them caving every possible opportunity to these individuals as a pejorative for majoritarianism
[3:09:32.800 --> 3:09:39.000]  as akin to the Latin phrase mobile vulgous, meaning the fickle crowd from which the English
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:45.880]  term mob originally was derived in the 1680s. So the ancient Greeks saw this mob oclocracy
[3:09:45.880 --> 3:09:53.000]  or oclocracy as one of the three bad forms of government, which is tyranny, oligarchy
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:59.440]  and oclocracy. We are now entering the oclocracy with the tearing down of these statues by
[3:09:59.440 --> 3:10:05.640]  violent mob surrounding them, demanding their removal. Even to the extent as I was talking
[3:10:05.640 --> 3:10:11.080]  about before the break, they now put on the list of statues they want removed. The prime
[3:10:11.080 --> 3:10:15.480]  minister who was in control of the country and oversaw the policy to be the first country
[3:10:15.480 --> 3:10:20.520]  in the world to literally abolish slavery throughout the world. He's next on the list.
[3:10:20.520 --> 3:10:26.760]  People think Winston Churchill is safe. I don't think so. Charles II Earl of Grey, who
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:32.960]  oversaw the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, is now on the list of statues that
[3:10:32.960 --> 3:10:39.640]  they want removed. And Mayor Sadiq Khan has chimed in, obviously. Headline Mayor Khan
[3:10:39.640 --> 3:10:45.960]  sets up commission to review all London landmarks to ensure they comply with diversity. So this
[3:10:45.960 --> 3:10:52.280]  is a guy who's overseen massive knife crime, violent crime in general, acid attacks across
[3:10:52.280 --> 3:11:00.200]  the capital city, moped robbing gangs, explosion of FGM cases, gang warfare, grooming gangs
[3:11:00.200 --> 3:11:05.240]  who aren't prosecuted. That's all gone under the radar. But as soon as there's a racist
[3:11:05.240 --> 3:11:11.840]  statue to be removed, he's hot on the case. This is a guy who was overseen a knife crime
[3:11:11.840 --> 3:11:17.800]  epidemic in London, where 73%, according to the superintendent of the Met, who is black,
[3:11:17.800 --> 3:11:24.560]  by the way, 73% of knife offenders and 53% of victims were from black or ethnic minority
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:29.320]  backgrounds. He's done nothing to stop that bloodshed. But as soon as there's a racist
[3:11:29.320 --> 3:11:35.680]  statue to be removed, he is right on the case. London Mayor Sadiq Khan faced backlash Tuesday
[3:11:35.680 --> 3:11:39.560]  after he announced the formation of a commission to review all London landmarks and street
[3:11:39.560 --> 3:11:44.240]  names. Yes, the statues aren't enough. Now they're going to be changing the names of
[3:11:44.240 --> 3:11:49.280]  the streets. I mean, it's not enough to have rainbow LGBT crossings everywhere. It's not
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:11:55.280]  enough to have transgender traffic lights. Now we have to rename the streets. Khan promised
[3:11:55.280 --> 3:12:00.280]  to review and improve London diversity in the wake of BLM protests at which statues
[3:12:00.280 --> 3:12:06.400]  at Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln were defaced. Yes, the guy who went to war to end
[3:12:06.400 --> 3:12:13.000]  slavery, Abraham Lincoln, his statue was defaced as well. Khan told Sky News that the commission
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:18.040]  for diversity in the public realm will review all London landmarks, including murals, street
[3:12:18.040 --> 3:12:25.520]  art, street names, and other public memorials. Now the response to this. Well, one of the
[3:12:25.520 --> 3:12:30.280]  responses was, why don't you start with this fella, Muhammad and slavery, the Prophet Muhammad
[3:12:30.280 --> 3:12:36.240]  who Sadiq Khan worships did not try to abolish slavery and bought, sold, captured and owned
[3:12:36.240 --> 3:12:40.440]  slaves himself. Not going to talk about that. Are we not going to talk about the Barbary
[3:12:40.440 --> 3:12:46.560]  slave trade? We're not going to ask reparations for that. Somebody else responded to Sadiq
[3:12:46.560 --> 3:12:53.120]  Khan protect our heritage. No cultural revolution. ISIS destroy history. Yes, that's true. They
[3:12:53.120 --> 3:12:59.640]  literally once they take over a region violently, they destroy the history of the region. Really
[3:12:59.640 --> 3:13:05.480]  people to aspire to, aren't they? And I object to a 1000 capacity mega mosque in Piccadilly
[3:13:05.480 --> 3:13:11.520]  Circus. Yes, there are plans to build a 1000 capacity mega mosque right in central London.
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:18.320]  I guess a lot of people will be offended by that. It's going ahead right on schedule.
[3:13:18.320 --> 3:13:23.440]  Somebody else said, take Churchill's statue down so he can stop and see the start of civil
[3:13:23.440 --> 3:13:28.000]  war. Really? Well, the people who have tried to protect it so far have been immediately
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:33.720]  removed by police. So I don't see how that's going to happen. Somebody else pointed out
[3:13:33.720 --> 3:13:38.200]  that the statue of Nelson Mandela remains untouched in said central London, even though
[3:13:38.200 --> 3:13:43.920]  he literally and his party literally used necklacing, which was placing burning tires
[3:13:43.920 --> 3:13:47.920]  on his political enemies and setting them on fire. We don't talk about that anymore.
[3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:53.520]  Do we? Again, certain parts of history, they can stay even if they're just as brutal as
[3:13:53.520 --> 3:13:58.400]  others because of the narrative. Somebody else said, I'd like to knock down the Roman
[3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:04.080]  part of London wall that is still visible because they used slaves. Another respondent
[3:14:04.080 --> 3:14:09.800]  said the Tower of London will have to go. Yes, people were imprisoned and tortured
[3:14:09.800 --> 3:14:14.480]  in the Tower of London. Maybe we need to knock that down. Somebody else said, not sure the
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:19.480]  French are too happy about Trafalgar Square and Nelson's column. There are thousands
[3:14:19.480 --> 3:14:25.000]  of them in London now. Do we care? No, stop wasting London's budget. Yes. And Nelson's
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:29.680]  column is not just offensive to the French. It's offensive to a lot of left wing identitarians
[3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:34.640]  who have openly called for that to be torn down too. So Sadiq Khan says he's going to
[3:14:34.640 --> 3:14:42.480]  replace these monuments, tear some down with diversity specialized monuments. Maybe Stormzy
[3:14:42.480 --> 3:14:49.880]  will replace Nelson at the top of Nelson's column. Who knows? Absolutely incredible.
[3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:55.560]  And then you contrast that with how black people are literally being killed by each
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:14:59.240]  other on the streets of London on a regular basis to the point where once our knife crime
[3:14:59.240 --> 3:15:05.520]  was worse than New York City, nothing whatsoever done about that, other than saying London
[3:15:05.520 --> 3:15:14.280]  is open. Absolutely incredible. The spectator reports Sadiq Khan's statue review is a mistake.
[3:15:14.280 --> 3:15:17.720]  This is an article by Emma Webb. She writes, what should we make of the clamor for more
[3:15:17.720 --> 3:15:23.200]  statues to meet the same fate as Edward Colston's? One thing to say is that the toppling of monuments
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:29.360]  is rarely historically literate. During the French Revolution, Parisians destroyed 28
[3:15:29.360 --> 3:15:35.000]  statues of biblical kings from the West facade of Notre Dame Cathedral. In their zeal, it
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:41.320]  didn't matter that the 500 year old statues didn't actually portray the kings of France.
[3:15:41.320 --> 3:15:45.480]  Countless pieces of art books and historical artifacts have been lost to this kind of ideological
[3:15:45.480 --> 3:15:51.360]  erasure. Finding themselves in the illustrious company of the Taliban and Islamic State,
[3:15:51.360 --> 3:15:58.920]  it's wrong to describe this weekend's iconoclasts as mere vandals. The good news, there was a
[3:15:58.920 --> 3:16:04.800]  poll by Yougov here in the UK, which asked people, do you approve or disapprove of protesters
[3:16:04.800 --> 3:16:11.000]  in Bristol pulling down the statue of Edward Colston? And only 13% of them said that they
[3:16:11.000 --> 3:16:16.160]  approved of the statue being removed in the way that it was done. I mean, 40% said it
[3:16:16.160 --> 3:16:22.560]  shouldn't be removed, but at least only 13% think that you should empower violent mobs
[3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:27.720]  of people to go rampaging around cities, tearing down anything that offends them. I guess maybe
[3:16:27.720 --> 3:16:35.240]  it's alarming that 13% think that, but at least it remains a noisy minority. But again,
[3:16:35.240 --> 3:16:38.960]  if the police don't stop them, what's the point in doing polls? What's the point in
[3:16:38.960 --> 3:16:43.960]  tweeting about it? The police, when these monuments get torn down, literally say, oh,
[3:16:43.960 --> 3:16:49.360]  we thought it would look bad if we got in the way of them tearing these statues down.
[3:16:49.360 --> 3:16:54.120]  Because it's not like whether police or anything, is it? It's not like literally our one job
[3:16:54.120 --> 3:16:59.400]  is to stop people committing crimes, is it? No, they don't only let them get on with it.
[3:16:59.400 --> 3:17:05.920]  They remove the people protecting the statues. There was a guy in London after the Winston
[3:17:05.920 --> 3:17:11.080]  Churchill statue was doped with graffiti, who merely went up to the statue and knocked
[3:17:11.080 --> 3:17:16.240]  away a few Black Lives Matter signs. Because the mob fingered him, the Salem witch trial
[3:17:16.240 --> 3:17:22.160]  mob, and immediately chanted, witch or racist in modern parlance, the police went directly
[3:17:22.160 --> 3:17:28.960]  after him. So if our own police force can't stop rampant acts of criminality on the capital
[3:17:28.960 --> 3:17:34.680]  street, what can we do tweeting about it? Absolutely incredible. We'll be back with
[3:17:34.680 --> 3:17:41.680]  more on the other side. Summit.News.
[3:18:04.680 --> 3:18:11.680]  We'll be back with more on the other side.

[3:20:40.160 --> 3:20:51.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:51.040 --> 3:21:06.240]  Now, of course, it's not enough just to remove statues. It's not enough just to try and change
[3:21:06.240 --> 3:21:14.640]  history. They now are going after TV shows that are as recent as 15 years ago, comedy
[3:21:14.640 --> 3:21:20.800]  TV shows in the United Kingdom, and having them removed from on-demand services, which
[3:21:20.800 --> 3:21:25.560]  is quite ironic in the case of this show, Little Britain, which today has been removed
[3:21:25.560 --> 3:21:32.120]  from BBC iPlayer, Britbox, and Netflix because the creators of this show, David Wolliams
[3:21:32.120 --> 3:21:37.080]  and Matt Lucas are the most insufferably woke people you could imagine. That didn't stop
[3:21:37.080 --> 3:21:42.960]  the mob coming after them. Headline Little Britain is removed from BBC iPlayer, Britbox,
[3:21:42.960 --> 3:21:48.080]  and Netflix. And it also can come fly with me, which was another show created by the
[3:21:48.080 --> 3:21:52.400]  same people, and it concerns that the use of blackface characters on the series is no
[3:21:52.400 --> 3:21:59.800]  longer acceptable. Now, this is a show from about 15 years ago, which satirized every
[3:21:59.800 --> 3:22:05.120]  different demographic in the United Kingdom. And in fact, most of the comedy was aimed
[3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:11.520]  at working class white people and making fun of them, making a mockery of them. It offended
[3:22:11.520 --> 3:22:16.840]  everybody. The characters in it, which were blackface, were not meant to be derogatory
[3:22:16.840 --> 3:22:21.760]  towards black people at all. They were just characters. But now Little Britain has been
[3:22:21.760 --> 3:22:25.680]  removed from Netflix, BBC iPlayer, and Britbox, and it concerns that the use of blackface
[3:22:25.680 --> 3:22:32.720]  characters on the series is no longer acceptable. This is Socialist Realism 2020. This is exactly
[3:22:32.720 --> 3:22:37.600]  what the Stalinist did as I'm going to get onto. In an apparent reaction to Black Lives
[3:22:37.600 --> 3:22:42.520]  Matter protest, Netflix pulled the Matt Lucas and David Wolliams series on Friday along
[3:22:42.520 --> 3:22:48.280]  with the pair's other comedy, Come Fly With Me. Then yesterday, BBC and Britbox both confirmed
[3:22:48.280 --> 3:22:53.120]  they had also decided to remove Little Britain, saying times have changed since the show first
[3:22:53.120 --> 3:22:59.880]  aired. So because times have changed, because you've allowed this hysterical woke outrage
[3:22:59.880 --> 3:23:05.560]  mob to seize control of culture, now we have to erase history down to the point of purity
[3:23:05.560 --> 3:23:11.080]  tests for entertainment. The show includes scenes where the comedians portray characters
[3:23:11.080 --> 3:23:17.960]  from different ethnic backgrounds with the use of makeup. And in fact, they portray racist
[3:23:17.960 --> 3:23:23.120]  white people. That's why the show is called Little Britain, because it's about small-minded
[3:23:23.120 --> 3:23:30.080]  people in Britain being bigoted in some of these sketches. No, not good enough. It suggests
[3:23:30.080 --> 3:23:34.720]  a certain uncertain future for other popular comedy series which feature similar techniques,
[3:23:34.720 --> 3:23:39.640]  though many are still available to watch on streaming sites. There's a movie from 2004
[3:23:39.640 --> 3:23:46.040]  by the way called White Girls, which shows two black actors in whiteface portraying white
[3:23:46.040 --> 3:23:51.440]  women. I'm sure that will be deleted too. Don't hold your breath. But League of Gentlemen,
[3:23:51.440 --> 3:23:56.800]  another UK series, features a blackface character is still both on Netflix and BBC iPlayer.
[3:23:56.800 --> 3:24:03.280]  I'm sure that will be gone within 24 hours. And while Beau Selector, which has since sparked
[3:24:03.280 --> 3:24:07.160]  a tearful apology from its creator, Lay Francis, is no longer available on all four. It can
[3:24:07.160 --> 3:24:13.400]  still be viewed on Prime Video. That's right. The creator of Beau Selector basically wallowed
[3:24:13.400 --> 3:24:18.560]  in his white gill and cried on the internet a few days ago apologizing for using blackface
[3:24:18.560 --> 3:24:25.160]  because he wore masks depicting black people in a comedy show. The entire show was about
[3:24:25.160 --> 3:24:29.280]  putting all these characters, whether they be black or white, in the position of being
[3:24:29.280 --> 3:24:34.480]  from Northern England doing stupid accents to make them funny. It had nothing to do with
[3:24:34.480 --> 3:24:40.360]  the color of their skin. But no, that's probably on its way out too. As is the film Tropic Thunder
[3:24:40.360 --> 3:24:45.280]  in All Likelihood in which Robert Downey Jr. appears in blackface, that's still available
[3:24:45.280 --> 3:24:50.000]  on Prime. So now we're going to have to go through every single movie and TV show over
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:57.400]  the past 50 years to see if it meets the standards of the new woke mob. This is what they did,
[3:24:57.400 --> 3:25:03.640]  by the way, during the 60s and 70s, not film classifications, not age ratings, but they
[3:25:03.640 --> 3:25:11.000]  had to put movies and TV shows before a panel of people who decided whether it was too offensive.
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:17.160]  Now back in the day, that was Christians, that was conservatives, that was, you know,
[3:25:17.160 --> 3:25:23.440]  people on the authoritarian side of the cultural divide. They had the power to censor and ban
[3:25:23.440 --> 3:25:29.040]  controversial content. It was wrong then. So why is it not wrong now? It's just the
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:34.120]  sands have shifted and the people judging whether this is offensive or the people who
[3:25:34.120 --> 3:25:40.320]  are literally offended by everything. And it's basically a purity test. I did an article
[3:25:40.320 --> 3:25:46.160]  back a few months ago, headline new purity test tool to scan Hollywood scripts for diversity
[3:25:46.160 --> 3:25:51.200]  bias. There's major Hollywood studios are set to use a new tool that scans movie and
[3:25:51.200 --> 3:25:56.000]  TV scripts and flags up any examples where diversity is not portrayed positively in a
[3:25:56.000 --> 3:26:01.360]  chilling new development as echoes of Soviet realism. And as I point out in the article,
[3:26:01.360 --> 3:26:08.520]  this is borrowed right from Stalinist Russia, running art through an Orwellian purity test
[3:26:08.520 --> 3:26:13.400]  before it can be allowed to be seen throughout the course of the Soviet Empire dictates as
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:21.800]  mandated that socialist realism either prescribed style of idealized art, art, paintings, whatever
[3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:26.880]  productions, theater productions, movies had to be run through the Soviet sensor. They
[3:26:26.880 --> 3:26:32.880]  had to be socialist realism. This meant that every sculpture, statue and painting had to
[3:26:32.880 --> 3:26:38.160]  conform to an established aesthetic in order to educate citizens on how to be the perfect
[3:26:38.160 --> 3:26:44.520]  Soviets. That is the exact same process we see today. But it's indoctrinating people
[3:26:44.520 --> 3:26:49.800]  on how they can and must join the mob. In order to entrench loyalty to the Communist
[3:26:49.800 --> 3:26:55.160]  Party and advance a utopian image of Soviet society, the purpose of Soviet socialist realism
[3:26:55.160 --> 3:27:01.000]  was to limit popular culture to a specific highly regulated faction of emotional expression
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:06.400]  that promoted Soviet ideals. The key word there is limit. This is going to make our
[3:27:06.400 --> 3:27:12.200]  culture infinitely more bland and sterile. Because I mean, you can't even get a work
[3:27:12.200 --> 3:27:19.480]  of art in an art museum in many cases. Now, if it doesn't amplify a social justice message,
[3:27:19.480 --> 3:27:23.920]  the most important thing about the work of art is the social justice message, not the
[3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:31.200]  quality of the art itself, which by no coincidence is why modern art is completely turd. So they're
[3:27:31.200 --> 3:27:36.880]  literally implementing socialist realism, Stalinist thought control in the arts and
[3:27:36.880 --> 3:27:42.560]  entertainment industry. In fact, there's a new thing where actors in both TV shows and
[3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:48.120]  movies, in their contract, they have to sign a thing which says, if you're targeted by
[3:27:48.120 --> 3:27:54.080]  a woke outrage mob and we fire you as the production company or the studio, then we're
[3:27:54.080 --> 3:27:58.840]  not going to compensate you. Once they come after you, once they try to cancel you, they
[3:27:58.840 --> 3:28:05.240]  literally have to agree to that in their contract before it signed. And now little Britain has
[3:28:05.240 --> 3:28:10.640]  fallen by the wayside as a result of that same mindset. Despite, as I said before, its
[3:28:10.640 --> 3:28:15.200]  creators being the most insufferable woke people you could imagine, that didn't save
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:20.040]  them from the mob, because there's no room for tolerance, because these are such tolerant
[3:28:20.040 --> 3:28:27.000]  people. RT reports, Apple and Google woke if I virtual assistants to educate users on
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:31.800]  Black Lives Matter. Of course, last week, we had the article Apple freezes browse feature
[3:28:31.800 --> 3:28:37.920]  of music app and replaces it with F the police playlist. They literally broke their own app
[3:28:37.920 --> 3:28:42.040]  to try and force people to listen to a Black Lives Matter playlist that included the song
[3:28:42.040 --> 3:28:48.280]  F the police, which, if you read the lyrics, is about massacring police officers. That's
[3:28:48.280 --> 3:28:53.240]  trendy. And that, again, like with Google, when they break their own search engine to
[3:28:53.240 --> 3:28:58.520]  gain their own algorithm and not provide you with the search result you need, Apple did
[3:28:58.520 --> 3:29:04.760]  that. Well, now Apple and Google have programmed their trademark voice assistance to respond
[3:29:04.760 --> 3:29:09.240]  to questions about Black Lives Matter movement, as well as to scold those who ask about all
[3:29:09.240 --> 3:29:14.200]  lives matter. Business entire reports, tech companies across the board are training their
[3:29:14.200 --> 3:29:19.720]  voice assistance to respond to questions on the BLM movement. So somebody asked, this
[3:29:19.720 --> 3:29:24.440]  is a sports blogger, David Garner, tweeted a video showing his Google Home smart speaker
[3:29:24.440 --> 3:29:28.520]  responding to the question, do Black Lives Matter in response, Google's voice assistant
[3:29:28.520 --> 3:29:33.960]  parroted the party line. Black Lives Matter, this is said in an NPC voice, no doubt. Black
[3:29:33.960 --> 3:29:37.680]  Lives Matter, black people deserve the same freedoms afforded to everyone in this country.
[3:29:37.680 --> 3:29:42.600]  Yet what freedoms the black people not have that everybody else has. And recognizing the
[3:29:42.600 --> 3:29:46.920]  injustice they face is the first step towards fixing it. So now they're programming voice
[3:29:46.920 --> 3:29:53.040]  assistance with this cult indoctrination message in case people didn't get the message the
[3:29:53.040 --> 3:30:00.320]  first time around. Absolutely incredible. So what's next? I mean, if there's a show
[3:30:00.320 --> 3:30:06.320]  from 15 years ago, which is, which makes a mockery out of every single demographic in
[3:30:06.320 --> 3:30:13.880]  the country. And in fact, in some of the sketches, exposes quote, bigotry of small minded or
[3:30:13.880 --> 3:30:19.280]  little minded people in Britain. If that's not safe, then what is safe? I mean, are we
[3:30:19.280 --> 3:30:24.640]  going to go back and erase all the Bond movies from the 80s because they're full of misogyny,
[3:30:24.640 --> 3:30:29.760]  gone with the wind? That's racist, right? Everything literature arts movies, it's all
[3:30:29.760 --> 3:30:39.800]  up grabs. Everything must go. They'll go away. It's finally here. Introducing the new survival

[3:31:44.280 --> 3:31:53.400]  gate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax. And now it's the race riot hoax of
[3:31:53.400 --> 3:31:58.560]  2020. We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next. I can tell you it's going to be a bunch
[3:31:58.560 --> 3:32:04.840]  of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war. So the economic collapse
[3:32:04.840 --> 3:32:11.000]  China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it. The globalists are attacking on every
[3:32:11.000 --> 3:32:15.640]  front. That's why now more than ever we have to realize they tried to censor them for wars
[3:32:15.640 --> 3:32:20.680]  off the air because they knew when they launched this whole situation that they didn't want
[3:32:20.680 --> 3:32:26.240]  the people's voice to still be on air. But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on
[3:32:26.240 --> 3:32:31.760]  air. So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever info
[3:32:31.760 --> 3:32:38.000]  wars.com lives. I don't like coming to you every day on the
[3:32:38.000 --> 3:32:41.800]  radio and TV stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling you all these horrible
[3:32:41.800 --> 3:32:47.160]  things. But you notice almost everything we've talked about horrible has come true. We were
[3:32:47.160 --> 3:32:53.200]  warning everybody to try to stop it. It's like telling somebody if you got a pool, put
[3:32:53.200 --> 3:32:56.640]  a fence around it. If you have little kids, because even if they're good swimmers, they
[3:32:56.640 --> 3:33:00.120]  can hit their head and drown. People don't listen. They go out and their kids dead in
[3:33:00.120 --> 3:33:02.760]  the pool. Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death
[3:33:02.760 --> 3:33:08.160]  of the third world, the collapse of the first world. And this is 21st century warfare carried
[3:33:08.160 --> 3:33:13.600]  out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated it. They admit it's good to save
[3:33:13.600 --> 3:33:17.720]  the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make us poor so they
[3:33:17.720 --> 3:33:23.720]  can dictate our surrender to this post human technocracy. I know all this sounds insane
[3:33:23.720 --> 3:33:28.440]  when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public because it's their operations
[3:33:28.440 --> 3:33:33.320]  manual. I wish this wasn't the case, but there really are evil psychopaths in control of
[3:33:33.320 --> 3:33:36.560]  most major institutions that we've got to stop them.
[3:33:36.560 --> 3:33:40.320]  I'm always excited about info wars life products. They're amazing. They're cutting edge. You
[3:33:40.320 --> 3:33:45.120]  love them. I love them. And they find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[3:33:45.120 --> 3:33:51.880]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development. That is amazing. The
[3:33:51.880 --> 3:33:59.480]  only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[3:33:59.480 --> 3:34:06.040]  And there's another innovation. It's the spray cap. It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:11.760]  gross goo, but it's high quality. It aerosolizes it in a really great way. I like to put it
[3:34:11.760 --> 3:34:16.440]  on my hands, rub a little bit on my face. It's got organic alcohol in it. So spray it
[3:34:16.440 --> 3:34:21.760]  right in your eyes. But I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:25.320]  So this is a real innovation. I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with
[3:34:25.320 --> 3:34:30.360]  a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it. So it doesn't dry you out. It smells
[3:34:30.360 --> 3:34:53.160]  great. It's so refreshing. This is a big winner. You're listening to the Alex Jones show broadcasting
[3:34:53.160 --> 3:35:01.200]  internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom. It's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:35:01.200 --> 3:35:06.480]  I'm going to switch gears here in a second and get into some coronavirus news. But I'm
[3:35:06.480 --> 3:35:12.920]  going to go to this Tucker Colson clip first because the statues fall as TV shows are literally
[3:35:12.920 --> 3:35:17.200]  being removed from history because people are offended. If you cave to the mob, this
[3:35:17.200 --> 3:35:20.680]  is only going to get worse. And this is the point that Tucker makes in this monologue.
[3:35:20.680 --> 3:35:29.120]  So let's roll it right now. Here it is. What is going on? What is this about? Even the
[3:35:29.120 --> 3:35:33.800]  outlines are blurry at this point. But we know this. No matter what they tell you, it
[3:35:33.800 --> 3:35:39.760]  has very little to do with black lives, if only it did. If Democratic leaders cared about
[3:35:39.760 --> 3:35:43.960]  saving the lives of black people and they should, they wouldn't ignore the murder of
[3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:47.760]  thousands of young black men in their cities every year. They wouldn't put abortion clinics
[3:35:47.760 --> 3:35:53.160]  in black neighborhoods. They wouldn't, instead, do their very best to improve the public schools
[3:35:53.160 --> 3:35:59.000]  and to encourage intact families, which we know beyond a shadow of it out, is central
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:03.280]  to the life prospects of children. They try to make black neighborhoods as safe as their
[3:36:03.280 --> 3:36:07.840]  own neighborhoods. They would close the payday lenders that have so much misery to the lives
[3:36:07.840 --> 3:36:12.120]  of poor people of all colors. But they don't even consider doing any of this. They don't
[3:36:12.120 --> 3:36:17.680]  even try. Instead, they encourage theft and mayhem as if that will help. It will not
[3:36:17.680 --> 3:36:24.160]  help. This may be a lot of things this moment we're living through, but it is definitely
[3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:30.200]  not about black lives. And remember that when they come for you and at this rate, they will.
[3:36:30.200 --> 3:36:34.160]  Anyone who's ever been subjected to the rage of the mob knows the feeling. It's like being
[3:36:34.160 --> 3:36:39.760]  swarmed by hornets. You cannot think clearly. And the temptation is to panic, but you can't
[3:36:39.760 --> 3:36:44.760]  panic. You've got to keep your head and tell the truth. Tell the truth. If you show weakness
[3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:49.800]  of any kind, they will crush you. Ask Drew Brees. By some accounts, poor Drew Brees is
[3:36:49.800 --> 3:36:56.120]  on his fourth apology for the crime of defending the American flag. He decided to apologize
[3:36:56.120 --> 3:37:00.680]  and now they're using him as a propaganda organ, hostage tape after hostage tape. At
[3:37:00.680 --> 3:37:05.000]  a moment like this, there is no advantage in cowardice, in being Mitt Romney. You think
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:10.600]  you're saving yourself, you're just empowering the worst people, people who hate you. Before
[3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:15.080]  you know it, you're confessing to crimes you didn't commit. Don't start. Tell the truth.
[3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:19.160]  And the truth is this is a good country, better than any other. Of course we are flawed, but
[3:37:19.160 --> 3:37:24.560]  we are trying unlike most places and we have nothing to be ashamed of. None of us. Immigrants
[3:37:24.560 --> 3:37:28.880]  know that best of all. That's why they come here. A million new Americans every year.
[3:37:28.880 --> 3:37:34.320]  They're not coming because America is a racist country. They're coming because it's not.
[3:37:34.320 --> 3:37:38.600]  That's all true. And in our clear moments, we know it's true. Even the people claiming
[3:37:38.600 --> 3:37:43.640]  it's not. Truth is a defense. No matter what they're telling you at this moment, this moment
[3:37:43.640 --> 3:37:48.040]  will pass. Remember that. All moments do. When it does, we will look back at what we
[3:37:48.040 --> 3:37:54.600]  just saw in a horror and disbelief. But if you're honest now, you will keep your dignity.
[3:37:54.600 --> 3:38:00.360]  And ultimately, you will be very glad about that. Life is not worth living without it.
[3:38:00.360 --> 3:38:06.120]  There you have it. It took a constant thing. Don't cave to the mob. Not many people paid
[3:38:06.120 --> 3:38:10.680]  heed to that message. Have the corporations, individuals, celebrities, they've all gone
[3:38:10.680 --> 3:38:16.320]  all in with brainwashing with the mob intimidation. I'm going to switch gears now though. Because
[3:38:16.320 --> 3:38:22.320]  you remember when the World Health Organization claimed in January, January 14th that there
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:26.800]  had been no human to human transmission of the coronavirus? Of course, they were only
[3:38:26.800 --> 3:38:33.960]  told about it by China in December. Well, now we have this headline out of CNBC. Satellite
[3:38:33.960 --> 3:38:39.000]  images and online searches indicate China had coronavirus in the fall. Harvard study finds
[3:38:39.640 --> 3:38:45.960]  COVID-19 may have been circulating in China as early as August 2019. A new study from Harvard
[3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:50.360]  Medical School claims. The virus, which is widely believed to have originated in a wildlife
[3:38:50.360 --> 3:38:57.480]  market in Chinese city of Wuhan, was first reported to WHO in late December. So China lied
[3:38:57.480 --> 3:39:02.360]  about it for at least three months, failed to tell the World Health Organization, but
[3:39:02.360 --> 3:39:07.240]  were told we can't criticize China. We can't call it the China virus. We can't call it the
[3:39:07.240 --> 3:39:12.920]  Wuhan virus. Don't blame China. That's racist. And don't blame the WHO either because they've
[3:39:12.920 --> 3:39:19.640]  been straight with us all along, haven't they? It turns out no. WHO scrambles to clarify comments
[3:39:19.640 --> 3:39:26.600]  on asymptomatic coronavirus spread says much is still unknown. CNBC again, the World Health
[3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:31.160]  Organization scrambled Tuesday to clarify its comments earlier this week that transmission
[3:39:31.160 --> 3:39:35.720]  of the coronavirus by people who never developed symptoms is very rare. It's due skepticism from
[3:39:35.720 --> 3:39:41.560]  physicians and others across social media. They've literally changed the line on this
[3:39:41.560 --> 3:39:48.120]  asymptomatic carrier thing three different times. In fact, Cernovich tweeted something earlier under
[3:39:48.120 --> 3:39:54.200]  the words, the scientists are all fake, where he points out referencing the tweets of Andy Slavitt,
[3:39:54.200 --> 3:40:01.000]  who at first said breaking WHO clarifies they estimate 16% of people are asymptomatic and
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:08.440]  transmit the virus. Then later they said WHO says 40% of transmissions may be through asymptomatic
[3:40:08.440 --> 3:40:14.120]  people. And now they're saying the who made a surprising announcement asymptomatic people
[3:40:14.120 --> 3:40:23.240]  with COVID rarely spread it. So it went from 16% to 40% to now barely zero percent. Remember,
[3:40:23.240 --> 3:40:27.960]  you will be banned if you disagree with the World Health Organization and health experts even though
[3:40:27.960 --> 3:40:33.400]  they've literally changed their story on every single facet of this over and over again. It's
[3:40:33.400 --> 3:40:38.280]  going to be hard to keep up with that, isn't it? In fact, that's something that lockdownskeptics.org
[3:40:38.280 --> 3:40:45.000]  is talking about in regard to face masks. They write, my heart goes out to the Porge
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:49.960]  Roger YouTube charged with overseeing the removal of any content that challenges the WHO's official
[3:40:49.960 --> 3:40:56.200]  guidance on COVID-19. Because of course, Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube, told CNN at the end of
[3:40:56.200 --> 3:41:00.600]  April, the social media platform would be removing information that is problematic,
[3:41:00.600 --> 3:41:05.240]  including anything that goes against World Health Organization recommendations. The problem is,
[3:41:05.800 --> 3:41:11.000]  those recommendations change from one day to the next. So how is YouTube's censoring chiefs
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:17.000]  supposed to keep up? And they give the example of face masks. Those readers with long memories
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:21.720]  will recall this WHO video, which tentatively recommended the wearing of masks in combination
[3:41:21.720 --> 3:41:28.360]  with other protective measures. That was before April. Then on April 6th, the WHO updated its
[3:41:28.360 --> 3:41:33.240]  advice. Now, apparently, there was no point in wearing face masks. So they changed it once.
[3:41:34.040 --> 3:41:37.560]  They said there is currently no evidence that wearing a face mask, whether medical or other
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:44.520]  types by healthy persons in the wider community setting, can prevent infection. But then in its
[3:41:44.520 --> 3:41:50.120]  latest official guidance, they've changed the narrative once again. Published on June 5th,
[3:41:50.120 --> 3:41:56.360]  WHO recommends that everyone should wear masks in public areas. WHO's technical lead expert on
[3:41:56.360 --> 3:42:00.920]  COVID-19 said in a Reuters interview, we are advising governments to encourage the general
[3:42:00.920 --> 3:42:06.520]  public wear a mask. No doubt in a few weeks time, the WHO's advice will change again. It's almost
[3:42:06.520 --> 3:42:10.760]  as if the organization is trolling us now. And remember, if you disagree with that,
[3:42:10.760 --> 3:42:17.080]  you're liable to get banned. Your videos get removed off of YouTube, even though you could be
[3:42:17.080 --> 3:42:21.800]  right or you could be in disagreement with the WHO based on what they're saying from one day to the
[3:42:21.800 --> 3:42:30.200]  next because they don't seem to know their arse from their elbow. Absolutely incredible. Meanwhile,
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:34.920]  George Floyd protesters asked about white woman killed by Somali Minneapolis police officer.
[3:42:34.920 --> 3:42:40.760]  This is an angle to the George Floyd story that people like to gloss over. Because in 2017,
[3:42:41.560 --> 3:42:49.480]  Justin Damon, an Australian American woman was killed by a Minneapolis police department officer.
[3:42:50.440 --> 3:42:55.480]  Don't remember any mass protests in 2017 against the Minneapolis police department, do you?
[3:42:57.080 --> 3:43:01.400]  Why not? Well, she was white and he wasn't 40 year old justice,
[3:43:01.400 --> 3:43:07.240]  Damond, an Australian American woman was fatally shot by Mohammed Noor, a Somali American Minneapolis
[3:43:07.240 --> 3:43:14.120]  police department officer. This is July 2017. Damond had called 911 to report the assault of
[3:43:14.120 --> 3:43:20.600]  a woman in an alley behind her house, but was shot by Noor as she approached his police car despite
[3:43:20.600 --> 3:43:26.600]  being unarmed. So an unarmed woman shot dead by a Minneapolis police department officer.
[3:43:26.600 --> 3:43:31.880]  Don't remember any giant riots or protests. Don't remember anyone burning down businesses.
[3:43:31.880 --> 3:43:37.320]  Don't remember anyone wanting any statues pulled down. Suffice to say the incident didn't spark
[3:43:37.320 --> 3:43:44.040]  global protests. And then Abby Yemeni went out to Black Lives Matter Melbourne to ask people
[3:43:44.040 --> 3:43:49.720]  if they'd heard of this and if they care about it. Asked if Damond's death was just as bad as George
[3:43:49.720 --> 3:43:53.880]  Floyd's death. One black protestor commented, no, it's not. And then immediately walked away.
[3:43:53.880 --> 3:43:59.800]  Another woman said it was S word that people were saying all lives matter. When asked if all lives
[3:43:59.800 --> 3:44:06.200]  did matter, she responded, not right now. When asked by there were no protests in Australia over
[3:44:06.200 --> 3:44:11.400]  Justin Damond, another woman remarked, well, I'd have to say that's a bit of white supremacy. Yes,
[3:44:11.400 --> 3:44:17.560]  she literally said that. And when pressed, why is it white supremacy? The woman responded, well,
[3:44:17.560 --> 3:44:25.880]  because she's white. So apparently being murdered while white by a non white person is incredibly
[3:44:25.880 --> 3:44:30.680]  racist. New York Times columnist demands white people ditch family members who don't support
[3:44:30.680 --> 3:44:36.920]  Black Lives Matter. This is in an article published yesterday. And he said, if your family members
[3:44:36.920 --> 3:44:42.840]  don't protest in favor of Black Lives Matter, or if they don't make financial donations to Black
[3:44:42.840 --> 3:44:48.920]  Lives Matter, then you literally need to withdraw from them and basically put them by the wayside.
[3:44:48.920 --> 3:44:54.920]  Your own family members, which of course is classic cult behavior, where they separate people
[3:44:54.920 --> 3:45:00.360]  from their families to indoctrinate them with the prescribed message. And of course, the left
[3:45:00.360 --> 3:45:06.840]  just loves to use the cult of victimhood to break up families. That is their raison d'etre.
[3:45:06.840 --> 3:45:12.440]  Chicago sees its deadliest day in 60 years with 18 murders in 24 hours. Nobody's going to protest
[3:45:12.440 --> 3:45:18.040]  about that because they don't actually care about Black Lives. They only care about power.
[3:45:18.040 --> 3:45:37.560]  Gonna wrap it up, warrens coming up next summit.news.go.
