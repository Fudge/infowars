[00:00.000 --> 00:12.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.640 --> 00:21.440]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.440 --> 00:34.040]  cbs news is reporting in st louis missouri near ferguson the department of
[00:34.040 --> 00:40.040]  homeland security has moved in they quote broke that today actually our
[00:40.040 --> 00:45.080]  reporters broke it yesterday the info wars dot com and on this syndicated
[00:45.080 --> 00:50.260]  radio broadcast and paul watson has an article out on it navy vet labeled a
[00:50.260 --> 00:58.000]  terrorist close quote for posting images of dhs vehicles in missouri they
[00:58.000 --> 01:03.960]  went to the hotel reworked and had him fired boy that sounds like some folks
[01:03.960 --> 01:09.360]  that want to live in a free country imagine being dhs and someone shows
[01:09.360 --> 01:13.800]  that you're massing vehicles outside ferguson and then you go and get them
[01:13.800 --> 01:21.300]  fired we're seeing more and more of this what type of company would fire someone
[01:21.300 --> 01:27.780]  that simply did citizen journalism and reported on this this is the mass of
[01:27.780 --> 01:31.860]  chilling effect that we're talking about a government that is totally out of
[01:31.860 --> 01:35.660]  control the verdict could come today come tomorrow come the next day but
[01:35.660 --> 01:39.500]  they're saying it'll be this week our reporters your courage action and of
[01:39.500 --> 01:47.180]  course joe bigs are on the ground and to show you how political this is report
[01:47.180 --> 01:50.660]  homeland security moves in police nationwide brace for unrest obama
[01:50.660 --> 02:01.780]  quietly met with activists and said stay on course demonstrators hold dying so
[02:01.780 --> 02:06.260]  this is a giant political distraction i'm reading from drudge the headlines
[02:06.260 --> 02:11.900]  here feds raid nfl suspicion drugs illegally given to players on the
[02:11.900 --> 02:17.980]  field six teams targeted on sunday bag search surprise doctors checked at
[02:17.980 --> 02:22.700]  airports either using homeland security selectively through the tsa harass
[02:22.700 --> 02:26.740]  folks not about terrorism of course they're on drugs of course there's
[02:26.740 --> 02:32.740]  manipulation going on of course lambs armstrong was on steroids i mean give me
[02:32.740 --> 02:37.780]  a break most the cops are on it it's totally hypocritical so why why is this
[02:37.780 --> 02:43.260]  important because the nfl's been backing off promoting anti-gun stuff and
[02:43.260 --> 02:46.620]  pushing obama care because of backlash and the feds are letting them know
[02:46.620 --> 02:53.100]  listen you do what we say or we're gonna blackmail you we will ruin your life
[02:53.100 --> 03:01.460]  you will do what we say when we say back to the front you will die when i say
[03:01.460 --> 03:07.980]  you must die back to the front you coward you servant you blind man back to
[03:07.980 --> 03:15.580]  the front to quote metallica back to the front you will do what i say when i
[03:15.580 --> 03:20.580]  say back to the front and just a nation of cowards groveling to this and so we
[03:20.580 --> 03:25.340]  go into a new dark age of tyranny it's just like the bill cosby stuff 30 year
[03:25.340 --> 03:28.100]  old allegations that have been disproven before i don't know if he had
[03:28.100 --> 03:32.900]  never forced himself on a woman i just know that's the favorite thing now is
[03:32.900 --> 03:36.860]  for men and women to claim that someone is prominent has sexually abused them
[03:36.860 --> 03:42.060]  and when it's real and the person's part of the establishment like al gore or
[03:42.060 --> 03:46.100]  dinecore actually getting caught shipping women and children out of
[03:46.100 --> 03:49.740]  central europe and eastern europe to be taken to slave brothels in the middle
[03:49.740 --> 03:54.260]  east nothing's done oh but everybody can have consternation about bill cosby
[03:54.260 --> 03:59.220]  you know why is he criticized obama care and obama and open borders and told
[03:59.220 --> 04:02.740]  black folks to stop being in a gangbanger culture you actually try to
[04:02.740 --> 04:05.860]  lift black people up and that's why they're slapping down like a few years
[04:05.860 --> 04:08.900]  ago he started bashing obama i said get ready for the drop the hammer on bill
[04:08.900 --> 04:14.020]  cosby because they want to send a message to everybody else i've talked to a
[04:14.020 --> 04:17.540]  bunch of hollywood stars that are pro-gun anti-vaccine you name it well
[04:17.540 --> 04:21.380]  you saw the guy that criticized vaccines the big comedian a few months ago they
[04:21.380 --> 04:28.420]  just they just fired him rob schneider this is how they we wonder why people
[04:28.420 --> 04:31.700]  go along with the system it's because they come after people say why they come
[04:31.700 --> 04:36.740]  after you alex oh believe me they have but by the grace of god we're going 110

[08:29.940 --> 08:33.140]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on
[08:33.140 --> 08:38.500]  this live monday worldwide transmission it is already the 17th day
[08:38.500 --> 08:43.300]  of november 2014 we'll be here lord willing for the next three hours
[08:43.300 --> 08:47.060]  we've got investigative journalist john rapaport joining us to cover a host of
[08:47.060 --> 08:50.500]  issues uh in the third hour but namely he's
[08:50.500 --> 08:54.100]  been focusing in on all the german dutch british
[08:54.100 --> 08:58.660]  uh african you name it mainstream news articles
[08:58.660 --> 09:02.180]  and and catholic bishops and and scientists
[09:02.180 --> 09:08.740]  going public uh indian scientists indian doctors london guardian you
[09:08.740 --> 09:12.580]  name it on the un sterilization program
[09:12.580 --> 09:15.940]  that is admitted to be going on worldwide through the vaccines
[09:15.940 --> 09:19.460]  i'm going to say that again there are un programs that they've caught them in
[09:19.460 --> 09:22.500]  the eighties nineties and again in the two thousands
[09:22.500 --> 09:28.100]  and now in the teens in 2014 catching them sterilizing women because the
[09:28.100 --> 09:32.100]  sterilization process sometimes kills them
[09:32.100 --> 09:35.060]  through vaccines but also they're taking them in
[09:35.060 --> 09:38.660]  and chopping their uteruses out
[09:38.660 --> 09:42.740]  they're doing surgery they're actually grabbing women on the street
[09:42.740 --> 09:46.100]  and we're going to have a discussion about overpopulation in the third hour
[09:46.100 --> 09:49.620]  and go over some of the actuary numbers for folks but even if you believe the
[09:49.620 --> 09:52.820]  world's overpopulated certainly in some areas you can say people are too
[09:52.820 --> 09:57.300]  concentrated don't have enough resources is the answer then driving around
[09:57.300 --> 10:01.060]  shooting them up with sterilants because here's the news flash
[10:01.060 --> 10:04.500]  they're doing the same thing here just not with sterilants
[10:04.500 --> 10:09.140]  that are a hundred percent they're doing it with soft kills so that it's not as
[10:09.140 --> 10:12.980]  obvious that mitigates what they hit you from five or six angles
[10:12.980 --> 10:16.740]  with the fluoride that lowers fertility with the estrogen mimicers that lowers
[10:16.740 --> 10:19.860]  fertility and with all the other chemicals
[10:19.860 --> 10:25.700]  the male sperm count last time i checked in the us is down over 90 percent
[10:25.700 --> 10:29.300]  same thing in europe just just type in male sperm count down over nine percent
[10:29.300 --> 10:34.180]  you'll get mainstream bbc ap roiders what's going on i mean here's a bloomberg
[10:34.180 --> 10:38.420]  headline all timers test the text disease
[10:38.420 --> 10:44.180]  decades ahead of onset uh why don't we ask why the neurons are
[10:44.180 --> 10:47.220]  degenerating why don't we ask why neurological
[10:47.220 --> 10:52.660]  disorders on average in the west get ready for this
[10:52.660 --> 10:56.100]  and the numbers vary are up between three thousand
[10:56.100 --> 11:01.060]  and ten thousand percent you heard me right look it up yourself
[11:01.060 --> 11:04.900]  why is diabetes up three thousand percent in hispanics
[11:04.900 --> 11:08.580]  up almost a thousand percent in caucasians two thousand percent in
[11:08.580 --> 11:15.140]  blacks why why is cancer of every type off the
[11:15.140 --> 11:18.340]  chart new cancers everywhere pediatric cancer up on
[11:18.340 --> 11:22.100]  average over 10 thousand percent journal of pediatrics
[11:22.100 --> 11:29.540]  and by the way if you're a radiologist you can write down what i say
[11:29.540 --> 11:33.780]  and then you can go and look it up okay in fact just type in television
[11:33.780 --> 11:38.100]  all timers link you'll get bbc ap roiders admitting
[11:38.100 --> 11:42.500]  television more than two hours a day is linked to a doubling in all timers
[11:42.500 --> 11:46.980]  type in more than three flu shots and you double your chances of all timers
[11:46.980 --> 11:51.620]  see they're doing it 2001 tv link to all timers bbc
[11:51.620 --> 11:55.780]  understand you can write down what i say
[11:55.780 --> 11:59.620]  and pull it up this is not coming from me
[11:59.620 --> 12:05.300]  you need to face what's going on i need to face it we need to deal with it
[12:05.300 --> 12:08.740]  they want to make trillions now off putting people on the equivalent of
[12:08.740 --> 12:11.700]  statins for the brain
[12:12.260 --> 12:15.060]  they're claiming oh we've got to put people on chemicals for life to stop the
[12:15.060 --> 12:19.060]  brain suddenly degenerating it's pesticides in the food it's
[12:19.060 --> 12:23.380]  gmo it's estrogen mimicers it's the chemicals it's the
[12:23.380 --> 12:28.340]  microwave radiation it's a cocktail that's killing us
[12:28.340 --> 12:34.900]  killing us killing us and it's a serious issue
[12:34.900 --> 12:37.380]  it makes them smoke the cigarettes and drink and whiskey
[12:37.380 --> 12:42.100]  look healthy you ask well why is government getting rid of cigarettes
[12:42.100 --> 12:44.580]  well it was the government and surgeons generals that told folks cigarettes
[12:44.580 --> 12:47.860]  were good for you and you know got a cold go you
[12:47.860 --> 12:51.940]  go buy a pack of camels or lucky strikes
[12:51.940 --> 12:54.980]  the army handed out cigarettes so they were good for the troops they knew was
[12:54.980 --> 12:57.460]  giving people cancer 80 years ago 90 years ago
[12:57.460 --> 13:01.620]  they're moving on from that now to tax it and regulate and control it
[13:01.620 --> 13:05.060]  and pose as if they're against cigarettes so they can then move on
[13:05.060 --> 13:08.180]  everything else like fat and salt and the rest of it
[13:08.180 --> 13:12.820]  it's not fat and salt that's the problem it's the gmo it's the chemicals
[13:12.820 --> 13:18.100]  it's the glyphosates we ate much more unhealthy diet 60 70 years ago
[13:18.100 --> 13:22.020]  most people were skinny they had a piece of pie at lunch and dinner
[13:22.020 --> 13:26.500]  drank 100 pure you know milk smoked cigarettes drank every night
[13:26.500 --> 13:30.340]  sat around smoking cigars playing cards and you didn't have cancer at these
[13:30.340 --> 13:32.580]  rates
[13:33.540 --> 13:36.580]  they say oh we're living longer no we're not US life expectancy has actually
[13:36.580 --> 13:40.820]  dropped and if you average out infant mortality
[13:40.820 --> 13:44.660]  it's true that until about 20 years ago now our infant mortality is going back
[13:44.660 --> 13:48.500]  up because of the vaccines and things it's shown
[13:48.500 --> 13:53.700]  that if you live to age 10 then you tended to live to be about 85
[13:53.700 --> 13:58.180]  there were a lot of 100 year old people in the neighborhood
[13:58.900 --> 14:01.780]  but if you look at it then if you average out the fact that infant
[14:01.780 --> 14:05.700]  mortality went down starting in about the 30s until about
[14:05.700 --> 14:09.780]  the early 90s it's still lower than it was back in the 20s
[14:09.780 --> 14:13.460]  but it's gone back up some just pull up the graphs infant mortality graph
[14:13.460 --> 14:16.500]  look at a hundred year US infant mortality graph
[14:16.500 --> 14:20.820]  you'll be on the Johns Hopkins website is the top link last time i checked
[14:20.820 --> 14:23.940]  they'll show you what i'm saying
[14:24.020 --> 14:29.460]  if you take out infant mortality people are living about 10 years less
[14:29.460 --> 14:33.460]  and russia is the same thing and europe is the same thing even though we've
[14:33.460 --> 14:36.660]  cut back on the smoking take all these drugs what they have though is more
[14:36.660 --> 14:40.180]  advanced treatments to treat and keep you alive longer
[14:40.180 --> 14:44.420]  sucking all your money out of you instead of you doing an endowment or
[14:44.420 --> 14:47.940]  building something or donating to a school your money goes to medical care
[14:47.940 --> 14:51.780]  the last 20 years of your life so they can also keep you alive
[14:51.780 --> 14:55.060]  as they kill you and then suck all the money out of you and the average
[14:55.060 --> 14:58.500]  doctors aren't aware of this the more and more of them that i talked to are
[14:58.500 --> 15:01.700]  aware of because of deep compartmentalization so i kind of went off on
[15:01.700 --> 15:04.340]  a rant on that front that's coming up in the third
[15:04.340 --> 15:08.260]  hour today but why don't we get a test to find out
[15:08.260 --> 15:11.860]  why everybody's getting neurological disorders geon beret
[15:11.860 --> 15:14.660]  narcolepsy
[15:15.860 --> 15:21.940]  massive increases in epilepsy alzheimer's type spectrum diseases
[15:21.940 --> 15:27.140]  autism spectrum diseases why are they opening neurology clinics everywhere
[15:27.140 --> 15:31.620]  because we're being killed we're being brain damaged we're being assaulted
[15:31.620 --> 15:36.420]  we're being murdered again i don't want everywhere i go
[15:36.420 --> 15:39.620]  race for the cure give money go to a restaurant
[15:39.620 --> 15:45.940]  go to a you name it grocery store anywhere they push give money for
[15:45.940 --> 15:48.900]  breast cancer give money for breast cancer well why aren't you
[15:48.900 --> 15:52.340]  well if you had a organization out there trying to find out why everybody's
[15:52.340 --> 15:57.140]  getting it and trying to prevent it if you had an anti smoking campaign
[15:57.140 --> 16:00.420]  that was private i'd give to that if you had an anti gmo campaign i'd give to it
[16:00.420 --> 16:03.780]  and i have if you had a campaign to get glyphosate out of the water
[16:03.780 --> 16:07.780]  i'd do it if you had a campaign to get fluoride out of the water i'd do it

[24:24.340 --> 24:28.260]  l.a. style riots if the hype on facebook and twitter

[24:44.100 --> 24:47.460]  out at the start of the next segment
[24:47.460 --> 24:52.020]  there is so much to break down but first off from barack obama's own
[24:52.020 --> 24:58.260]  words shock flashback obama says illegal immigration
[24:58.260 --> 25:02.900]  hurts blue collar americans strains welfare
[25:02.900 --> 25:07.940]  now you can understand folks it's the republican rhino blue blood leadership
[25:07.940 --> 25:11.140]  that used to be bigger on open borders than even democrats
[25:11.140 --> 25:13.860]  because democrats had a lot of blue collar workers across the u.s i don't
[25:13.860 --> 25:17.300]  care if they were black white ispanic who understood that a bunch of people
[25:17.300 --> 25:21.300]  influxing would drive down their wages like ross perot said a giant sucking
[25:21.300 --> 25:25.380]  sound well how about you bring the giant sucking sound here
[25:25.380 --> 25:28.420]  but the bigger issue is can the president just by fiat
[25:28.420 --> 25:32.260]  outside of law do this and the answer is no it is impeachable
[25:32.260 --> 25:36.580]  and even mainline crowd hammer is now set it and that's big because rippard
[25:36.580 --> 25:40.420]  murdoch has instructed news corps folks i've talked to news corps insiders on a
[25:40.420 --> 25:43.780]  whole bunch of them they've been told back off obama
[25:43.780 --> 25:46.820]  they can attack him they can mess with him for ratings but don't
[25:46.820 --> 25:50.500]  actually try to bring him down don't talk about impeachment
[25:50.500 --> 25:54.580]  and don't criticize the republican leadership
[25:54.580 --> 25:57.860]  well they have crowd hammer come out last week in fact cue that up after this
[25:57.860 --> 26:01.940]  clip is a big deal believe me because crowd
[26:01.940 --> 26:07.060]  hammer is very respected and very very smart
[26:07.060 --> 26:11.380]  hovington post charles crowd hammer calls potential obama immigration action
[26:11.380 --> 26:16.820]  and impeachable offense no it's not it's not
[26:16.820 --> 26:21.860]  you know potential it is obama is planning to do it he's already done it by
[26:21.860 --> 26:24.740]  fiat it is impeachable it's beyond impeachable
[26:24.740 --> 26:28.580]  you've got to impeach as crowd hammer says are you endorse
[26:28.580 --> 26:32.900]  lawless criminal executive branch and katie bar the door
[26:32.900 --> 26:37.540]  let's go ahead and play this clip from obama's own mouth
[26:37.540 --> 26:41.380]  from the book on tape the audacity of total bs excuse me
[26:41.380 --> 26:45.220]  the audacity of hope here it is there's no denying that many blacks share the
[26:45.220 --> 26:49.220]  same anxieties as many whites about the wave of illegal immigration
[26:49.220 --> 26:52.340]  flooding our southern border the number of immigrants
[26:52.340 --> 26:55.140]  added to labor force every year is of a magnitude
[26:55.140 --> 26:59.620]  not seen in this country for over a century if this huge influx of mostly
[26:59.620 --> 27:03.460]  low-skill workers provide some benefits to the economy as a whole
[27:03.460 --> 27:07.380]  it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue collar americans
[27:07.380 --> 27:11.860]  and puts strains on an already overburden safety net
[27:12.580 --> 27:17.540]  let's play that clip one more time from the lord and savior who said he wouldn't
[27:17.540 --> 27:20.580]  come out with the guns it would cut your health care costs in half the power of a
[27:20.580 --> 27:25.220]  phone bill is two plus two does equal four
[27:25.220 --> 27:28.740]  everything he said he went back on
[27:28.740 --> 27:32.180]  to a level never before seen by a politician in this country here it is
[27:32.180 --> 27:36.420]  there's no denying that many blacks share the same anxieties as many whites
[27:36.420 --> 27:40.260]  about the wave of illegal immigration flooding our southern border
[27:40.260 --> 27:44.340]  the number of immigrants added to labor force every year is of a magnitude
[27:44.340 --> 27:48.820]  not seen in this country for over a century if this huge influx of mostly
[27:48.820 --> 27:52.580]  low-skill workers provide some benefits to the economy as a whole
[27:52.580 --> 27:56.500]  it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue collar americans
[27:56.500 --> 28:01.380]  and puts strains on an already overburden safety net
[28:01.380 --> 28:06.020]  well i think michael schneider at info wars dot com says it well in his article
[28:06.020 --> 28:09.060]  obama here equals a death panel for the economy
[28:09.060 --> 28:13.620]  did you know that some americans are being hit with health insurance rates
[28:13.620 --> 28:17.300]  increases of more than 500 percent that's impeachable
[28:17.300 --> 28:22.900]  and then meanwhile obama is set sometime this week they're now saying to
[28:22.900 --> 28:26.660]  announce the blanket total amnesty and that any kid in the world
[28:26.660 --> 28:32.900]  can get amnesty status as a refugee that means the government will pay for them
[28:32.900 --> 28:35.860]  i mean this will bring the country down and by the way
[28:35.860 --> 28:40.020]  the influx is about nine times the biggest numbers of immigrant influxes
[28:40.020 --> 28:44.820]  we saw in the 1890s through 1910 or so to the east coast
[28:44.820 --> 28:47.860]  and back then you didn't get welfare these people work like slaves
[28:47.860 --> 28:51.460]  and help build this country it cheap labor did help build because we were
[28:51.460 --> 28:54.180]  at expanding frontier had low taxes let's go to crowd
[28:54.180 --> 28:57.860]  hammer as we go to break on impeachment look i believe it is an
[28:57.860 --> 29:01.700]  impeachable offense if the circumstances were different
[29:01.700 --> 29:06.020]  if we were at the beginning of a presidency if we hadn't had years when
[29:06.020 --> 29:10.100]  the congress has been supine and unresponsive
[29:10.100 --> 29:14.660]  at other grabs of their authority by the executive
[29:14.660 --> 29:18.340]  like obama unilaterally changing obama care
[29:18.340 --> 29:23.860]  after it was passed about 30 times with no response from the congress
[29:23.860 --> 29:28.660]  the same as obama sensually rewriting some of the drug laws
[29:28.660 --> 29:32.340]  this idea prosecutorial discretion is really a travesty
[29:32.340 --> 29:36.180]  it is intended for all right we're gonna go to break but i mean there you go if
[29:36.180 --> 29:39.460]  you don't do this it'll set the president that the house
[29:39.460 --> 29:43.060]  the senate and the legislative in the states as well and the courts the
[29:43.060 --> 29:46.980]  judicial just our vestigial ceremonial
[29:46.980 --> 29:50.180]  nothing i mean that's it we're on the march
[29:50.180 --> 29:57.460]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:06.020 --> 33:15.380]  a potential program run amuck but when you actually look at
[33:15.380 --> 33:19.140]  the details then i think we've struck the right balance
[33:19.140 --> 33:22.900]  and if people can't trust not only the executive branch but also
[33:22.900 --> 33:29.540]  don't trust congress and don't trust federal judges to make sure that we're
[33:29.540 --> 33:32.740]  abiding by the constitution due process and rule of law
[33:32.740 --> 33:38.900]  then we're gonna have some problems the alex jones show because there is a war
[33:38.900 --> 33:44.340]  on or your mind we've been conquered
[33:44.340 --> 33:49.140]  we've been occupied like france by the nazi germans
[33:49.140 --> 33:54.340]  and if we don't wake up and realize that we have no hope
[33:54.340 --> 33:59.220]  that's why they have the white house run msnbc cnn and media matters
[33:59.220 --> 34:03.780]  publicly run by the white house demonizing yours truly because they
[34:03.780 --> 34:08.580]  know the real power of this broadcast is not the 18 20 million people we reach
[34:08.580 --> 34:14.100]  every week the real power is that you reach people
[34:14.100 --> 34:18.820]  and that the information we lay out here now is the talking points
[34:18.820 --> 34:22.820]  for the rest of talk radio and for congress
[34:22.820 --> 34:27.140]  to a great extent and that scares them just like drudge report dot com scares
[34:27.140 --> 34:30.580]  them because drudge can point at some bill or
[34:30.580 --> 34:35.140]  some obscure video and get a major debate going that's what
[34:35.140 --> 34:38.900]  we're able to do so many times that's why this
[34:38.900 --> 34:42.260]  broadcast is so special it's a great responsibility
[34:42.260 --> 34:46.020]  i get excited when i see other alternative media
[34:46.020 --> 34:50.740]  becoming the dominant media breaking big stories i don't get mad and say man i
[34:50.740 --> 34:54.340]  wish we had broke that story the daily caller did
[34:54.340 --> 34:57.780]  or man look at the attention world net daly's getting
[34:57.780 --> 35:00.980]  or man look at the attention this local talk show host is getting
[35:00.980 --> 35:04.100]  i get excited
[35:04.260 --> 35:08.100]  that people understand what's going on i get excited that we're not
[35:08.100 --> 35:12.180]  one of the only organizations out there now that can do this
[35:12.180 --> 35:16.020]  because there's safety in numbers and it means we can win
[35:16.020 --> 35:19.060]  i want the big win i don't want to bankrupt the country
[35:19.060 --> 35:23.060]  i don't want to collapse i want a future for my children just like you do i
[35:23.060 --> 35:27.220]  want prosperity i want justice i don't want to go
[35:27.220 --> 35:30.900]  quietly into that long night with the new world order
[35:30.900 --> 35:35.700]  i mean look at jerry brown preparing to run for president right bar's reporting
[35:35.700 --> 35:40.420]  and his meeting with donors this week talk about night marish
[35:40.420 --> 35:44.260]  back in 92 he ran with jesse jackson
[35:44.260 --> 35:50.900]  we can put that article up on screen i mean that is just simply simply
[35:50.900 --> 35:57.060]  amazing that that is going on and you know what if he's able to get
[35:57.060 --> 36:01.220]  by the breach in california another 30 40 50 million illegals and get them all
[36:01.220 --> 36:04.580]  voting cards and you know california gets up to 60 70 million
[36:04.580 --> 36:09.060]  people that california will decide the election
[36:09.060 --> 36:12.100]  because you only get a hundred and million people are so ended up voting in
[36:12.100 --> 36:15.700]  presidential elections california is 37 million right now or
[36:15.700 --> 36:18.660]  whatever it is i mean you get said to be like 50 million
[36:18.660 --> 36:23.140]  in a couple years because it's the north american union
[36:23.140 --> 36:28.180]  the globalists are collapsing us into this greater union
[36:29.620 --> 36:33.300]  and obama says he's ready with executive action
[36:33.300 --> 36:36.340]  to move forward executive order immigration would ignite
[36:36.340 --> 36:41.220]  a political firestorm but obama says he's going to go ahead with it now he
[36:41.220 --> 36:43.860]  lies so much that tells me he may not do an executive order
[36:43.860 --> 36:49.140]  may back off they call it a victory but already since january the border is
[36:49.140 --> 36:53.380]  totally wide open the border patrol loads the illegals on grayhound buses and
[36:53.380 --> 36:56.340]  others and gives them a federal voucher to go anywhere they
[36:56.340 --> 36:59.060]  want the country
[36:59.220 --> 37:02.260]  anywhere you want to go to upstate new york from
[37:02.260 --> 37:05.140]  texas you can you want to go from california to main you can
[37:05.140 --> 37:08.820]  you want to go from california to the keys of florida you can you want to go
[37:08.820 --> 37:13.300]  from california to minnesota you can
[37:13.300 --> 37:17.460]  this is unbelievable this is organ the border patrol has gone on fox
[37:17.460 --> 37:21.620]  television and said we complete the smuggling process
[37:21.620 --> 37:24.900]  exactly what we said from our sources we showed you the video
[37:24.900 --> 37:29.540]  from mcallin with the emergency manager going yes the border patrol loads them
[37:29.540 --> 37:34.180]  gives them vouchers a sort of and then lets them go in kids with their families
[37:34.180 --> 37:39.860]  under any name they want biometric scans are not even taken
[37:39.860 --> 37:42.660]  when you get a driver's license biometrics are taken they said it was for
[37:42.660 --> 37:45.940]  the illegals back in the 90s when clinton got it put in nationwide
[37:45.940 --> 37:50.260]  and i told you it wasn't folks they just let people in and you can be whoever
[37:50.260 --> 37:53.460]  you want you want five identities you want to pull five different welfare
[37:53.460 --> 37:56.660]  roles go ahead
[37:57.860 --> 38:03.140]  when police pull illegals over now on record they don't even give them tickets
[38:03.140 --> 38:07.300]  because they can't no id no nothing above the law
[38:07.300 --> 38:11.220]  not complying we though comply with every form of government abuse
[38:11.220 --> 38:14.420]  every form of government rape every form of government
[38:14.420 --> 38:17.060]  shellacking
[38:18.260 --> 38:24.100]  and so we are the right whale and again the right whale was a slow sweet fat
[38:24.100 --> 38:28.740]  whale that was almost extinct by the 1960s when hunting it was
[38:28.740 --> 38:31.940]  banned it was like three dozen left or
[38:31.940 --> 38:34.900]  something one of the most plentiful whales in the
[38:34.900 --> 38:38.580]  ocean there are three species of large
[38:38.580 --> 38:43.060]  baleen whales of the genus the north atlantic whale
[38:43.060 --> 38:46.980]  the north pacific right whale and the southern right whale
[38:46.980 --> 38:50.740]  they're classified the family of the baleen of the
[38:50.740 --> 38:56.020]  bowhead whale right whales have round bodies
[38:56.020 --> 39:00.580]  v-shaped blowholes and dark gray and black skin
[39:00.580 --> 39:04.740]  their most distinguishing feature is the right whale is the rough
[39:04.740 --> 39:09.460]  patches of skin on the head if you guys read deeper why they call it the rule
[39:09.460 --> 39:12.340]  there it is right whales with a preferred target for whalers
[39:12.340 --> 39:16.260]  because their docile nature their slow surface skimming
[39:16.260 --> 39:20.500]  feeding behaviors their tendencies to stay close to the coast
[39:20.500 --> 39:24.900]  and their high blubber content which makes them float when they are killed
[39:24.900 --> 39:29.860]  and which produces high yields of whale oil
[39:31.140 --> 39:34.180]  today the north atlantic and north pacific right whales are among the
[39:34.180 --> 39:38.340]  most endangered whales in the world
[39:39.860 --> 39:44.340]  and america and the average american is known as the schmuck whale
[39:44.340 --> 39:51.140]  the joke whale the chump male the mark whale the target whale
[39:51.140 --> 39:54.500]  we are known as the joke of the planet we are known
[39:54.500 --> 39:58.180]  as the idiots of the world as i've told you and as groober tells you
[39:58.180 --> 40:01.540]  hi you stupid americans well who are you working for
[40:01.540 --> 40:08.100]  we can rip you off and keep it secret and you're so dumb
[40:08.100 --> 40:11.380]  yeah i met with obama and he said i can't afford to run this through it
[40:11.380 --> 40:14.500]  how are we going to hide this and i came up with a plan of how to deceive
[40:14.500 --> 40:19.220]  everybody and you know what you are the right
[40:19.220 --> 40:23.220]  whale not our general audience but our new listeners
[40:23.220 --> 40:27.140]  i'll sit here and tell you man you need to wake up
[40:27.140 --> 40:31.700]  i just played obama the jamie fox calls lord and savior
[40:31.700 --> 40:34.980]  saying that open borders would wreck the country and bankrupt us
[40:34.980 --> 40:38.580]  he better believe that was the plan jack
[40:38.580 --> 40:41.860]  all right obama yeah let's play that again right now
[40:41.860 --> 40:47.060]  come on oh oh clap first of all give an honor to god
[40:47.060 --> 40:54.660]  and our lord and savior barack obama
[40:54.660 --> 41:00.100]  barack obama y'all stand up you know what jamie fox does
[41:00.100 --> 41:03.380]  he's not stupid he's made over a hundred million dollars
[41:03.380 --> 41:06.180]  he sits back and knows he's chomping everybody he knows he's gaming
[41:06.180 --> 41:11.620]  everybody from texas he's up from where i'm from
[41:11.620 --> 41:14.740]  i think he's a good actor but every time i watch him now i can't
[41:14.740 --> 41:17.540]  i have to turn the television off or leave the movie because
[41:17.540 --> 41:22.340]  this is a guy like zuckerberg who knows that his viewers and his fans are
[41:22.340 --> 41:26.580]  dumb efforts that's another quote
[41:26.580 --> 41:31.220]  and it's just real funny let me tell you i've been around high-level democrats
[41:31.220 --> 41:36.260]  they know it's a chomp game they know their jobs to go out there
[41:36.260 --> 41:39.700]  and and tell everybody that it's cool to be a slave but bill cosby comes out and
[41:39.700 --> 41:43.540]  says obama cares bad obama's bad being a black gangbangers bad that black leaders
[41:43.540 --> 41:47.700]  want to keep blacks down and basically pimp them which is the
[41:47.700 --> 41:51.700]  game that margaret sanger came up with and boy you notice they're going after
[41:51.700 --> 41:55.140]  him now that matters no evidence they're going to get him
[41:55.140 --> 41:58.580]  they're going to get him they're going to teach him good
[41:58.580 --> 42:05.380]  you understand that until we wake up to it
[42:05.540 --> 42:10.660]  until we understand what's happening i want to get more into obama care more
[42:10.660 --> 42:18.180]  into uh super bird flu more on putin four kills in chemical leak at la
[42:18.180 --> 42:22.420]  la port plant i said la port i saw la la port plant
[42:22.420 --> 42:27.300]  in texas ktrk uh reports well the answer is ban chemical plants if anyone
[42:27.300 --> 42:30.740]  ever got got hurt no the answer is that's just part of life
[42:30.740 --> 42:33.860]  and we've got a lot safer plants than we used to in this country and we're an
[42:33.860 --> 42:37.540]  industrial society but i'm sad for those that died
[42:37.540 --> 42:41.540]  my point is if four people got shot it'd be the top news story into the world
[42:41.540 --> 42:46.500]  ban all the guns even though guns frustrate crime
[42:46.500 --> 42:49.700]  70 something times the numbers vary from 44 to
[42:49.700 --> 42:53.620]  100 and something but on average 70 plus times
[42:53.620 --> 42:57.940]  guns stop crime for when they're used in a crime in fact criminals
[42:57.940 --> 43:01.220]  pretty much just sneaking houses that are
[43:01.220 --> 43:04.900]  vacant now or people aren't home and steal stuff out of your car if it's not
[43:04.900 --> 43:10.420]  locked uh because everywhere with gun proliferation
[43:10.420 --> 43:13.300]  i mean you it's russian roulette robin somebody or
[43:13.300 --> 43:16.420]  conquering somebody on the head because a lot of women don't listen to gloria steinham now
[43:16.420 --> 43:18.740]  a lot of women go out and buy guns and go out and get training and
[43:18.740 --> 43:22.660]  you try to rape him or rob them they're gonna light you up light you up like
[43:22.660 --> 43:27.700]  christmas
[43:29.060 --> 43:32.580]  i just love seeing the culture liberty proliferate as they try to force this
[43:32.580 --> 43:35.620]  tyranny in and they saw the awakening happening the last decade
[43:35.620 --> 43:39.860]  so they came in hard with obama to be their closer
[43:39.860 --> 43:42.740]  and now he's looking at it and sees everybody waking up and he's just
[43:42.740 --> 43:45.940]  planning all these executive orders and he thinks his republican buddies over
[43:45.940 --> 43:48.660]  there baner and mcconnell i'll be able to protect him
[43:48.660 --> 43:57.780]  from political backlash go ahead make my day punk go ahead
[43:57.780 --> 44:01.300]  because it takes you guys acting like the tyrants you are nakedly
[44:01.300 --> 44:05.540]  to get the american people up off their patuts i won't open the phones up in

[44:22.500 --> 44:26.100]  unbelievable it's like the affordable care act ain't affordable
[44:26.100 --> 44:28.980]  or the patriot acts the opposite of being a patriot
[44:28.980 --> 44:32.180]  or they tell you go ahead and wear a condom and then you're going to be safe
[44:32.180 --> 44:40.820]  you know how often condoms burst you know often people put condoms on wrong
[44:40.820 --> 44:48.420]  and then there's nothing safe about that type of sex
[44:48.420 --> 44:53.140]  my goodness but they put the word on it
[44:53.140 --> 44:57.140]  like affordable care act or the dream act we want kids to dream
[44:57.140 --> 45:02.820]  oh my goodness our future is a country run by somebody like jerry brown
[45:02.820 --> 45:06.820]  totally sickening if we don't turn this around there's an article up on info

[45:25.700 --> 45:30.180]  anxiety lethargy and catatonia i guess is the word
[45:30.180 --> 45:33.780]  did not vastly improve until doctors diagnosed her with a vitamin b12
[45:33.780 --> 45:37.460]  deficiency which normally they don't do a blood test now doctors are going you
[45:37.460 --> 45:39.780]  know what i'm not going to listen to the pharmaceutical company or
[45:39.780 --> 45:43.700]  obama care guidelines we're going to do a blood test
[45:43.700 --> 45:51.460]  according to a little known study the woman who also suffered from
[45:51.460 --> 45:55.220]  disturbances such as hearing her name called out
[45:55.220 --> 45:59.460]  was teetering and was treated with anti psychotic and anti
[45:59.460 --> 46:02.820]  depressive medications for months with little effect but once doctors began
[46:02.820 --> 46:06.100]  treating her with b12 she revered to a stable mental state
[46:06.100 --> 46:09.780]  she had an experience for 14 years and then it goes through
[46:09.780 --> 46:13.620]  the study and we have links to it in the article
[46:13.620 --> 46:18.260]  up on info wars dot com
[46:20.100 --> 46:23.380]  a lot of the b12 available on store shelves consists of the former
[46:23.380 --> 46:29.620]  two types we break it down stayed in the combination of latter two
[46:29.620 --> 46:34.420]  anyways going over the study it's linked up on info wars
[46:34.420 --> 46:42.980]  dot com we have sold out basically of secret 12
[46:42.980 --> 46:48.020]  but it looks like we're going to get the next shipment in it it's basically
[46:48.020 --> 46:51.860]  complete now it's being labeled and then they have to test one more time
[46:51.860 --> 46:56.500]  though it's been tested twice that batch and then it will be
[46:56.500 --> 46:59.540]  shipped out probably friday i'll probably be here
[46:59.540 --> 47:04.260]  next tuesday so i'm not going to take it down
[47:04.260 --> 47:09.380]  we're going to say that expected it will ship within two weeks though
[47:09.380 --> 47:14.420]  it'll probably ship next week but what's coming in is only half of what we
[47:14.420 --> 47:17.620]  already sold so so we have enough to cover
[47:17.620 --> 47:21.460]  the orders now i just went and checked during the last break
[47:21.460 --> 47:25.220]  but if we can go a couple more days at this rate
[47:25.220 --> 47:29.300]  and then we'll be completely sold out unfortunately for two thousand
[47:29.300 --> 47:34.180]  and fourteen of secret 12 this proprietary form
[47:34.180 --> 47:37.860]  of two different types of organic vitamin b12 80 percent of it is the
[47:37.860 --> 47:40.980]  mythical bolliman that is the type that you inject
[47:40.980 --> 47:44.340]  and from the research we've done it has much higher absorption rates
[47:44.340 --> 47:49.060]  than other even organic sublingual vitamin b12 compounds
[47:49.060 --> 47:52.740]  and i mix it in with water every day
[47:52.740 --> 47:56.340]  three times a day couple squirts my supermail vitality
[47:56.340 --> 48:02.340]  my survival shield x2 nason iodine and sometimes with colloidal silver i do
[48:02.340 --> 48:04.900]  that a few times a week just to bolster because it's
[48:04.900 --> 48:10.020]  it's the season for all the super resistant bacteria and viruses and
[48:10.020 --> 48:11.940]  the rest of it so that's what i'm personally doing
[48:11.940 --> 48:14.820]  we have we've been sold out of silver bullet for six weeks
[48:14.820 --> 48:18.500]  silver bullet our proprietary what we believe the best colloidal silver
[48:18.500 --> 48:23.620]  nano-sized particles out there and very affordable as well
[48:23.620 --> 48:26.660]  we private label out of the biggest manufacturer in the country that
[48:26.660 --> 48:29.460]  supplies whole foods and others they sell it for about ten dollars more than
[48:29.460 --> 48:32.740]  what we sell the exact same bottle labeled silver bullet
[48:32.740 --> 48:37.540]  and we are going to have some of that in in fact some already came in but i'm
[48:37.540 --> 48:40.660]  not going to start selling it until there's enough in at least have it for
[48:40.660 --> 48:45.700]  a week or so so we are going to sell out a secret 12
[48:45.700 --> 48:51.700]  infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 and the win-win is you're getting a
[48:51.700 --> 48:55.940]  really high quality nutraceutical but you're also funding this operation so
[48:55.940 --> 48:59.300]  i can send you kary jackson and joe biggs for a week up to ferguson to cover
[48:59.300 --> 49:01.860]  it so i can send reporters to cup and hang in to cover
[49:01.860 --> 49:05.060]  bilterberg or to london or to greece or to switzerland
[49:05.060 --> 49:08.420]  or to virginia so i can send reporters to the border
[49:08.420 --> 49:11.620]  and uh if you continue to fund us and buy the high quality products the water
[49:11.620 --> 49:14.500]  filters the t-shirts the books of videos i'm going to hire three or four more
[49:14.500 --> 49:18.100]  reporters and i'm going to hire three or four more writers
[49:18.100 --> 49:21.620]  and then just because i can't handle the management and and also trying to
[49:21.620 --> 49:24.500]  accelerate and make the money i think we're going to try to stop growing at
[49:24.500 --> 49:31.060]  that point and then move in later to maybe having
[49:31.060 --> 49:37.140]  reporters that are part-time in 10 locations or something around the
[49:37.140 --> 49:42.020]  country that we can activate and pay to you know but have guidelines and train
[49:42.020 --> 49:45.140]  them and end vet them and you know everything there's a lot of
[49:45.140 --> 49:47.540]  mainstream reporters that are out of jobs or whatever we might hire some of
[49:47.540 --> 49:51.300]  them as well but we like grass roots folks so we can have people on the ground
[49:51.300 --> 49:55.300]  within an hour or two of any location in this country
[49:55.300 --> 49:58.740]  and they'll be pitching us ideas every day to be activated i mean i got a lot
[49:58.740 --> 50:01.460]  of ideas i got to launch the show on cable and tv
[50:01.460 --> 50:04.100]  this is already dominating on the internet the nightly news but it is

[50:09.540 --> 50:12.980]  but it's not a stadium because you come you're in the fight you're in the info

[55:28.900 --> 55:33.540]  ron paul internet gambling ban a losing bet for the rest of us
[55:33.540 --> 55:36.340]  yeah government just wants to run it if you want to be an idiot gamble that's
[55:36.340 --> 55:38.980]  your problem uh obama met with fergus and
[55:38.980 --> 55:44.500]  activists said he's concerned they stay on course
[55:44.500 --> 55:47.460]  and we've got a report that all hell's going to break listen ferguson
[55:47.460 --> 55:52.740]  with gun sales tripling up 300 that's all up on info wars dot com
[55:52.740 --> 55:56.740]  also want to talk with listeners about the flashback obama in his own book and
[55:56.740 --> 56:00.660]  his own audiobook saying open borders and all these illegals hurt america
[56:00.660 --> 56:04.820]  hurt jobs and hurt the social safety net weighing down the country
[56:04.820 --> 56:08.740]  till it collapses i want your take on that as well 800
[56:08.740 --> 56:14.900]  2599231 but this navy vet that got fired for

[56:18.260 --> 56:21.940]  is illegal in america that's the big enemy because if you ever start doing
[56:21.940 --> 56:25.300]  that become your own intelligence network we don't need the system anymore
[56:25.300 --> 56:28.100]  and then they can't lie to us about the real obama cases
[56:28.100 --> 56:33.220]  obola cases they can't cover all this stuff up
[56:33.220 --> 56:36.260]  so that's just some of the news that we're going to be breaking
[56:36.260 --> 56:44.180]  down on that front uh i also want to
[56:44.180 --> 56:47.220]  get into the economy what's happening with russia
[56:47.220 --> 56:54.980]  saudi prince paid for 9 11 pilots to learn to fly that's in the daily mail
[56:54.980 --> 56:57.300]  that is just some of what we're going to be breaking down
[56:57.300 --> 57:00.660]  boomburg reports us navy deploys first laser weapon
[57:00.660 --> 57:04.260]  in the persian gulf they've deployed on a command ship of the persian gulf the
[57:04.260 --> 57:08.740]  first ever laser weapon capable of destroying
[57:08.740 --> 57:12.500]  a target the amphibious transport ship the uss
[57:12.500 --> 57:17.380]  pounce has been patrolling with a prototype 30 kilowatt class laser weapon
[57:17.380 --> 57:20.180]  system since late august according to officials
[57:20.180 --> 57:23.540]  the lasers mounted facing the bow and can be
[57:23.540 --> 57:27.220]  fired in several modes from dazzling warning flashes
[57:27.220 --> 57:31.540]  to a destructive beam and can set a drone
[57:31.540 --> 57:35.860]  or small boat on fire that we've shown video of that before
[57:35.860 --> 57:40.980]  pretty interesting since 2011 the navy has boosted its presence in the persian
[57:40.980 --> 57:44.660]  gulf then they get sent to testing the weapon all
[57:44.660 --> 57:51.700]  extremely interesting obviously and uh that's tinker toys
[57:51.700 --> 57:56.260]  compared to what they're really facing islamic state the globalist run cia
[57:56.260 --> 57:59.620]  front is now threatening to kill 11 e soldiers and they're

[58:03.060 --> 58:06.580]  soldiers which i told you a long time ago because that's the number of al-qaeda
[58:06.580 --> 58:10.100]  operatives that are in the so-called syrian liberation army
[58:10.100 --> 58:14.900]  that's over 90 al-qaeda so all just an attempt to
[58:14.900 --> 58:20.820]  divert and distract the public that is coming up in the second hour as well

[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:27.380]  those border closed we cannot count on man
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:33.780]  man will not save us only yeshua my second talking point is you got a
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.300]  problem with revelations it says revelations
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:43.780]  310 it says i will keep you from the hour of the
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:49.460]  trial that dwells on those on the earth
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:54.020]  okay not the believers and then you got first timothy
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:02:00.740]  416 it says for the lord himself will descend from heaven with
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:04.820]  a cry of command with the voice of a art
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:08.900]  angel with the sound of the trumpet of god and
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:12.340]  are you saying i think that you believe in a pre
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:17.460]  tribulation rapture oh yeah all right well listen i got a jump
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:20.740]  because i said you know we're getting into like 20 topics i threw out
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.980]  and i guarantee i don't think one of these callers will be on one of those
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:25.860]  topics and that's fine that's the weird thing we do on the show
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.740]  sometimes it's great sometimes it's not i'm not mad at you but i'm not having a
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:33.060]  theological debate right now it says the beast will wage war on
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.700]  the saint should overcome them how how'd that happen when they're all
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:39.060]  teleported out of here what happened to jesus what happened to
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:43.300]  his disciples did they get raptured what happened to christians in nazi
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:48.820]  germany or the soviet union god helps those that helps themselves
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.580]  you you you take action and god gives you providence
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:55.940]  george washington just sit there and pray that god would come destroy the
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:00.580]  redcoats he prayed that god would guide his hand defeating them
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:04.740]  trust in god but type your camo is the old better one saying i agree with it
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:10.020]  hunter s thompson said trust in god but we're away from the rocks
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:14.020]  and we could control our border we could prosecute people that hire illegals
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.900]  we could not give them all free welfare and they wouldn't be here they
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.100]  incentivize it and that's what goes on these big mega churches that's all that
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.780]  goes on is a lay down don't get involved do what you're
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:28.260]  told it's a government doctrine of failure i'm not mad at you sir
[01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:31.220]  and i understand we should trust in god i do trust in god that's why i'm not in
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.900]  fear but i'm just always hearing from so-called christians
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:40.100]  hey you're always gonna take care of it but i still gotta put my shoes on in
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.540]  the morning i still gotta take care of my kids

[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:36.740]  celebrities doing something good with their power
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:39.700]  neil young has come out and said that because
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:44.180]  starbucks has joined a lawsuit against the state of vermont
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:48.820]  and their new law saying that gmo products have to be labeled
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:52.260]  well you know how much sugars in them you know how much
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:56.180]  fats in them of course you should know if a genetically modified organism is in
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:59.540]  there like bt corn that kills the honeybees that
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.980]  come in contact with it it's designed to kill bugs so that
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:06.660]  the crops don't get eaten but it also hurts you he says i used to line up and
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:12.660]  get my latte every day but yesterday was my last one the rocker announced
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:16.180]  and then separately that story is up on info wars dot com
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:22.340]  via rolling stone we now have pat sage act coming out
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:27.780]  saying that gruber comments about how americans are
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:32.100]  dumb and how they deceived them illustrates the elitism of the left
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.020]  and said that's what the politicians really think of the american people in
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:40.180]  a tweet good job pat sage act and of course
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:43.940]  look for neil young to get harassed now look for pat sage act to get harassed
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:49.780]  just like bill cosby now did bill cosby in his long
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:54.580]  careers a superstar ever forced himself on a woman maybe
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:59.700]  he doesn't fit that mo but a woman 30 years ago and then after that other
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:04.100]  women claim 30 years later
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:09.620]  that he raped them and you'd think it was the end of the world right now
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:13.620]  for the former jello sponsor
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:19.860]  i know this this is politically motivated clearly to punish him for
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:23.780]  criticizing obama care and obama in the last few years i've said look out bill
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:26.660]  cosby because i've seen this over and over again
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:32.580]  they come after you they fire you they restrict you just like the
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:36.020]  comedian a month ago who criticized vaccines and autism
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:41.380]  they dropped him from his insurance sponsoring
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.820]  state farm rob steiner
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:52.660]  so that's what i think is going on here and we have to learn to support people
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:55.780]  who get targeted i'm going to your calls but i want to tie it into this
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:58.740]  we're gonna talk to our reporters on the ground coming up
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:03.140]  navy vet labeled a terrorist for posting images of dhs vehicles in
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:06.100]  missouri hotel staffer acid vehicles were linked
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:10.980]  to impending ferguson arrest and so dhs went and got him fired from his
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.100]  job well somebody needs to contact them and get him rehired
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:18.100]  or said hire this navy vet who's now been fired for simply being
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:21.540]  a citizen asking questions and putting it out on their facebook
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:26.900]  see our reporters get targeted so does vice of hbo so does alga's era
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:31.220]  by the police you'll see the commanders you know basically ordering
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:34.340]  the troops as they call them the militarized police to shoot us rubber
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:38.580]  bullets when we are there 200 yards away covering it
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:42.420]  they won't go after looters don't get your folks with malloff cocktails
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.460]  they go after the press because they're being trained because the government
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:48.580]  wants information dominance well that's not what you do in a free
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:51.780]  society that's why obama has persecuted the press
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:56.180]  like no one else in history even the left admits
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:01.060]  nobody's going after the press and indicted and arrested people
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:05.700]  for reporting on corruption like barack hussain obama
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:10.500]  also coming up school teaches kids that the government gives us our rights

[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:20.020]  we could get him indicted not only him but everyone that's involved with
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:23.780]  with with this fraud i mean i think it's a giant screw job
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:28.100]  and he openly you know admits it so i was wondering how do we get them all
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:32.340]  indicted well i i appreciate that question it's
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.980]  an excellent question i'll put you on hold while i answer it and go back to
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:39.940]  you kevin the way this should work is they call
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:43.300]  gruber they call a zeke lomanual they call all the people that shot their
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:46.420]  mouths off about how it's death panels how it's
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.940]  meant to wreck health care how it's a screw job how it's meant to kill old
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:53.620]  people how it's meant to bankrupt the country how they lie about what it cost
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:57.380]  how they lied about the tax and you grill them
[01:13:57.380 --> 01:14:01.620]  so it becomes a media spectacle and you get their crimes out in the open
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:06.180]  then you indict obama in the house of representatives
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:10.180]  you indict him and then you have the trial in the senate
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:13.140]  and the thought is well that makes him a victim and might boost his poll
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:17.300]  numbers no not when it's this egregious not when everybody's being hit with the
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:22.340]  premium increases in obama care the democrats are screaming for vengeance
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:28.260]  and then you impeach obama there'll be a landslide
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:31.060]  bainer will be removed from the house as the
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:34.420]  speaker the leader of the senate will be removed
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:37.780]  and not from office but will be removed from leadership
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.580]  in that landslide will give cover to all those politically they're being black
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.180]  no longer attacked we could route the entire group
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:46.980]  then you've got to put heat on the next power group not to be bought off of the
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:50.340]  same interest letting them know they'll be politically destroyed
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:55.700]  and that we're done playing games but that's what a wake electorate would do
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:59.460]  that's what you would do if you wanted to reverse the course of the country
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:03.140]  instead they'll repeal a few parts of obama care keep the screw job rolling
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:06.020]  into the future and then bring all these other screw jobs in
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:09.700]  because why not they got away with this why not amnesty
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:14.900]  why not everything else why not a north american union because you will put up
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:18.340]  with that the sky's the limit you can also have
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:22.340]  class action lawsuits that draw attention to things all of us being hit
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:25.700]  with it premium increases are being kicked off our insurance
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:31.140]  or having our identity stolen by the networks that they set up
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:35.140]  the data mining for democratic party the fraud of the website
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:40.100]  a bunch of lawsuits can be filed on that front and have accelerated
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:43.460]  timetables because people are being currently hurt who don't have health care
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:46.260]  and that's another way and then you could have grand juries
[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:50.100]  off those civil lawsuits use those as roadmaps
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:55.220]  to indict the state and federal level for fraud and racketeering
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.100]  and then people like gruber will be indicted
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:02.340]  four hundred thousand dollars as a professor he gets his professor's money
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:05.700]  400 that's just one government contract to go work with obama
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:10.100]  in being the expert name to doll the thing up and put his name
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:12.980]  on an economic report to shove it through congress
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:16.580]  oh look mit says this won't increase prices
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:19.860]  we screwed everybody that's how arrogant they think they are
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:23.940]  they've pulled off the heist of the century they're saying
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:28.420]  obama care will cost trillions of dollars of the next 10 years of taxpayers
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:31.940]  death panels total screw job and he's laughing
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:35.620]  about how he robbed fort nox basically in my opinion
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:40.020]  and you know what he made it away with it remember folks returning veterans and
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:42.660]  gun owners and christians are called terrorist
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:46.100]  in official homeland security training they go to months of training every
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:50.100]  few years to see clips of me played ron paul
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:53.540]  demonized rand paul demonized i mean they call an fbi
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:58.500]  atf federal marshals state police are sent to this local cops
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:01.780]  and it's so over the top as they badmouth the george washington stuff
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:05.700]  that it's waking the people up even their people are going i'm actually in a
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:08.580]  meeting with an image of george washington on the screen
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:13.860]  we've been sent these these power points we've shown folks
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:16.580]  and they just get up there in badmouth george washington i mean these people
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:23.060]  are traitors these people are nuts they say two plus two equals five
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:27.700]  kevin any other points on that i just would like to know how gruber
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:30.660]  sleeps at night knowing that you know he conned everything
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:34.340]  and how would he feel if we caught as the american public turned around and
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:39.780]  conned him you know i mean think about it if we if we did what he did
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:43.700]  you know for sure that we would be indicted or
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:47.620]  or would be in in some type of trouble for the you know
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:51.860]  for the stuff that he pulled and the other thing i was wondering too um is it
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.300]  possible to uh maybe make a sign and go to a legal
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:59.060]  and awful area and say hey these people are nothing but criminals
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:02.180]  well you can't do that anywhere in dalis they say no signs are allowed in your
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.820]  hand anywhere because the first amendment is nothing but
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:09.620]  but uh birdcage liner but i still do it in dalis myself routinely
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:13.380]  just because they passed that illegal law i appreciate your call
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:16.180]  uh yeah no i think everybody should be going to
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:19.860]  grubers all the monitor professors like him only teach a few weeks out of the
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:24.020]  year find out gruber schedule and then obviously everyone
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:27.460]  should go into the clash or afterwards and confront him
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:31.060]  about you know being a big fat liar let's do one more call
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:35.700]  dion in illinois you're on the air
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:39.220]  hey alex how you doing good
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:45.060]  my question is um do you think mexico is the next
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:50.420]  key of they have uh missing 43 students that were murdered by the cartel
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:54.500]  and they had pro prep processors using government offices
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:58.820]  and then november 20 there's going to be a general strike a national general
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:04.340]  strike and do you think they'll have economic impact in the market
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:08.260]  well i think you're absolutely right uh that there is a strike
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:12.900]  uh coming up very very soon in mexico uh there
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:16.740]  the government basically is the cartels that's why they've torched the police
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:20.660]  stations and taken over state capital because the young people know they're
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:24.740]  being fed on by a bunch of armed thugs if the young people could be armed this
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.300]  wouldn't happen but you see the government run
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:31.860]  cartels the only ones they're allowed to be armed
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:36.100]  and the government split between the marines and the army
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.220]  our government claims the marines are less corrupt i've seen evidence that's
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:42.260]  the case that's why the marines control all the tourist
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:46.100]  areas uh mexico is basically collapsing i think your
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:49.220]  question is an excellent one what do you think
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:53.940]  yeah i think it will be the next key and i think it will affect the

[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:25.540]  about sending a reporter down there uh and we go now back to the caller dion
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:29.140]  in illinois your other points about this
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:34.820]  yeah my other point about this is that um like in argentina in 1980s they would
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:38.580]  target lawyers protesters anything that was a threat
[01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:43.620]  to the establishment they would kidnap them and have them disappear
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:47.540]  so they're doing the same tactics in mexico as student protesters in the
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:51.220]  u and i think if there is a collapse it's
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:54.820]  going to affect the food commodities and we're going to see higher food prices
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:57.540]  in the food oh yeah well already california drought
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:00.420]  and the rest of it too
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:06.420]  what else do you think's going to happen um well i think there's going to be an
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:10.980]  increase in migration to texas uh because of what
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:15.380]  will happen if it does collapse and do you think it should be considered
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:18.660]  a political refugee
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.820]  well that's what's being prepared see they know mexico is collapsing
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:26.500]  and so yes they're preparing to basically merge our countries under the
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:30.740]  guys of helping mexico but that's only designed to collapse our country as well
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:36.900]  as obama admittedly said in his own book and his own book on tape the
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:40.980]  audacity of destroying america excuse me the audacity of hope
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:44.260]  here's that clip thank you go denying that many blacks share the same
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:48.500]  anxieties as many whites about the wave of illegal immigration flooding our
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:52.180]  southern border the number of immigrants added to labor force
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:56.740]  every year is of a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:59.460]  if this huge influx of mostly low-skill workers
[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:03.620]  provides some benefits to the economy as a whole it also threatens to depress
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:07.540]  further the wages of blue collar americans and put strains on an already
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:10.580]  overburden safety net
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:17.140]  absolutely right barack obama pre-election let's go to brad and

[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:21.780]  rad wanted to comment on the furthest of situation with police departments
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:25.300]  across the country and they're bracing for la riot
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:32.100]  style events we've got feds massing dozens and dozens of trucks nearby
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:35.540]  hotel manager took photos of it got fired for doing so
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:40.260]  the video of that and the trucks is up on info wars dot com
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:43.460]  simply amazing and the way the media has been hyping this
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:46.820]  and building it up if the verdict comes tonight tomorrow who knows
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:50.180]  they're saying sometime this week it could be explosive we appreciate the
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:52.180]  courage of our reporters out there on the ground
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:55.700]  we'll talk to joe biggs and jacari jackson
[01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:58.660]  who are in the middle of this story here in just a moment but brad what's your
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:02.340]  point my point is that it's 10 it tends to be
[01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:05.460]  everything that comes out of dc tends to be a psi op
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:08.900]  and you you know it as well as anybody you pointed out all the time alex and
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:13.380]  and like paul joseph watson and you always know it's a order out of chaos so
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:16.820]  what i hope i just hope and pray that all the blacks out there
[01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:20.740]  especially the blacks don't you know lose our mind and ride over this because
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:23.540]  it is it looked like the guy was guilty and i mean
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:26.260]  i'm not saying it's right that the guy that the cops shot and killed him
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:30.420]  obviously that's not good but he was defending himself that appears and the
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:32.900]  guy did rob the convenience store or was
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:36.340]  they act like a thug in there and i'm sorry that he was killed but
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:40.900]  it's no reason for people to ride and and uh they're just using it to
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:45.460]  to get a word out of chaos that's my point you're right we're gonna get
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:49.060]  joe biggs and jacari jackson's take they're out there asking people
[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:53.540]  why do you think gun sales are up 300 they've got those reports coming up
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:56.420]  they're out there asking demonstrators and folks on the ground what do you
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:35:00.180]  think's going to happen if people start burning down businesses and things
[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:05.940]  and people shoot back what'll happen if people shoot back
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:11.220]  and then you got more dead people but at the same time
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:14.020]  i think there's the mistrust because there's like two black officers out of
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:19.380]  50 something officers and the community 70 black that that's a problem
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:23.620]  but that doesn't mean then somebody can thug out
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:27.380]  and you know run around an act like that and that's what bill cosby talked
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:30.260]  about was the thug culture this pink promoter everywhere not just the black
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.820]  community and of course now he's being destroyed
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:37.060]  anybody that stands up against that the system really wants this
[01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:41.060]  so we'll talk to our reporters on that subject and then i'm going to cover this
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:44.420]  and take your calls school teaches kids the government
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:48.100]  gives us rights close quote god given freedoms are in fact
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:52.820]  special privileges quote close quote granted by the state says handout
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:56.580]  hey cops knew 30 years ago that driving wasn't a privilege now they'll tell you
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:01.620]  it's a privilege they're now saying guns are a privilege it's not true
[01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:06.100]  i'm going to explain that coming up in a moment says being a good citizen
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:09.380]  imma the little girl filled that out in that cute
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:12.500]  we'll be covering that in a moment also two gop presidents
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:16.820]  acted unilaterally on immigration ap saying that's why obama can do it no
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:21.140]  i told you the republicans are behind this the blue bloods but when reagan
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:24.660]  did it he had congressional approval and so then he did it
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:27.940]  executively and the same thing with another
[01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:32.500]  president george h w bush but it only encouraged more people to come in
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:35.540]  than more amnesty so we're against that too
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.420]  even though it was much smaller just because republicans did something bad
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:40.740]  doesn't mean it's okay just because democrats did something
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:43.540]  bad didn't mean it's okay but you watch when republicans get in they're going
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:48.820]  to say oh look obama did all this just as we said they would
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:53.780]  it doesn't set a precedent when you commit a crime to be able to keep
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:57.380]  committing more crimes unless we let you do it and we're saying we're done
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:02.660]  joining us from ferguson is joe begs reporting from full wars dot com joe
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:07.220]  looks like it's pretty cold out there that would be an understatement alex it
[01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:11.060]  is uh it's about 20 degrees here it is a pretty cold yes
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:14.580]  uh we're actually standing outside uh if you see the flag in the background
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:17.860]  waving around we're standing uh right outside of the
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:21.380]  courthouse in clayton missouri and that's where the
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:24.980]  verdict is supposed to come down uh either today or tomorrow sometime this
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:27.700]  week but uh it looks like it'll be tonight uh
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:30.820]  on the verdict of whether or not darin wilson is found guilty of the murder
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:34.260]  mike brown uh just a little bit ago there were some protesters
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:38.260]  walking around uh through the streets and uh immediately
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:41.700]  a bunch of cop cars went right behind them followed them down the road
[01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:46.100]  and uh you know tell them the whole way uh that's starting to uh dissipate a bit
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:48.660]  and everyone's starting to move out other than that
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:51.460]  there's not a lot of people out on the streets right now i think a lot of
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:54.900]  people are kind of you know
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:58.180]  taking heed to the fact that something might happen i mean there's a pretty
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:38:02.100]  good chance from what you see that the the buzz on social media
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:05.620]  you know saying hey if you board your windows up that's not going to stop us
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:09.220]  we'll just burn your building down so there's a lot of tension going on around
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:12.340]  this area and uh you know clayton's only to the east
[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:16.660]  i'd say about a 20 minute drive from the downtown st lewis area
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:21.060]  and about a 15 minute drive south of ferguson but this is where the st lewis
[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:24.580]  county police department's headquarters is in the courthouse so
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:27.700]  this is working uh the uh the action will begin
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:31.620]  if the verdict is released tonight and you know like we say to you know
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:36.820]  nhl uh stanley cup finals someone wins they still ride so regardless people
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:40.340]  are expecting to go crazy out here and we're going to be here to document
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:44.340]  that for you guys to watch at home that's right you guys had hundreds of
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:46.820]  thousands of viewers at one time when you were doing
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:51.220]  live use streams that we had up on info wars dot com when jacari got hit by
[01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:54.660]  the the gas you got hit by rubber bullets they attacked the alga zero
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:58.740]  camera people and then said they were helping them then the police officer
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:03.300]  threatened to effing kill you with a shotgun for no reason he got suspended
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:07.380]  we're not here trying to get cops in trouble but we have a right to be out
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:10.820]  there covering it you went up and told them where the cash of mall off
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:14.740]  cocktails were and they told you you know get the f back
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:18.500]  uh which it looked like that was provocateur you later talked to cops
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:21.860]  off duty who said oh yeah it's definitely provocateur
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:25.300]  you talked to some in their riot gear who said no we know it staged
[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:28.900]  so obviously a lot of cops know what's going on the problem is they're under
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:33.700]  orders and it's one thing to say hey don't follow orders like nurenberg
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:36.580]  but at the same time there's a lot of peer pressure
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:40.340]  what is your gut telling you is going to happen when this announcement comes
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:43.460]  out i know a lot of the groups have said they're still going to riot even if they
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:47.380]  indict the cop yeah well my biggest fear is this time
[01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:51.460]  is the uh the agent provocateur i think there's going to be a lot more
[01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:56.740]  undercover uh dhs employees uh i i've been i've had one that maybe some
[01:39:56.740 --> 01:40:00.820]  national guard uh type people will be undercover as well as protesters
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:04.340]  so i think that's going to be the key tonight if the verdict comes out
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:08.820]  if these guys are able to incite a riot and get a lot of these uh
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:12.980]  a lot of these protesters uh i would say angry and willing to go to that level
[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:15.860]  to start burning stuff this is something that you know the
[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:20.020]  government wants they want these riots to happen because that helps them
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:23.220]  you know and state their militarized police state
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:27.140]  and lock us down again like martial law you know uh
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:31.140]  some people i know that uh you know do a lot of the computer stuff sent me a
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:35.860]  grid where it shows an outline of them uh basically like a
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:39.620]  grid around the surrounding area where cops are going to be stationing
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:44.340]  uh tonight possibly and then closing in on everyone and locking it down so you
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:48.100]  were sent by one of your sources the inside police perimeter
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:51.620]  grid will you please get that to to show tips at info wars dot com or to paul
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:54.580]  watson or one of the riders that's big news show
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:59.620]  yeah i just got that earlier so right now that kind of coincides with the fact
[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:03.060]  the those uh dhs vehicles you got a kettling map is what you're saying
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:05.300]  you got the map of how they're going to control people
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:08.980]  yeah they want to take that area lock it down and start pushing through like
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:12.260]  they did except this time it's going to be a much larger area
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:15.700]  but we know that they brought in over 2000 outside police officers
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:19.060]  you know we've seen the pictures of all those dhs vehicles
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:22.500]  um you know over the past couple weeks there's been multiple
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:26.020]  Apache helicopter sightings in the area that have never been seen
[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:30.020]  in this area so they're preparing for martial law say once again and by the
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:33.140]  way last year they sent in the armored vehicles the tanks
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:37.300]  and said this was a preparation for civil unrest bizarre that they sent it to
[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:41.300]  that very area uh all over st louis south and north but
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:45.540]  near Ferguson as well and did the training for martial law and then
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:49.460]  magically this pops up there again the average cop is compartmentalized
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:53.380]  doesn't know this but we know from the trayvon martin case
[01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:56.660]  uh it came out in mainstream florida news that indeed the justice department
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:42:01.540]  was caught running the meetings advising people to go out and loot
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:06.420]  walgreens and a riot trying to get it to blow up then the feds can come in
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:11.220]  when local cops respond say they did something wrong and set the precedent
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:14.500]  for federalization this is all about federalization
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:17.940]  that's why the feds want there to be riots all over the country
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:22.180]  it's why msnbc and others race bait with their fbi informant
[01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:29.140]  of course uh al uh sharpton exactly you know a lot of the people around here
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:32.500]  from you know that i've spoken to thus far a lot of people are worried that
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:35.460]  something like this is going to happen you know when i spoke to the gun store
[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:39.220]  owner the other day he said most of the people that were coming in
[01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:42.260]  were families of the police officers that work
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:44.820]  in the st louis county the police department so they're worried about
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:48.980]  their retaliation against police officers and their families as well
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:51.620]  so those people are in fear for their lives you know you get a lot of
[01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:54.820]  protesters or antagonizers whatever you want to call them
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:57.860]  running around saying that you know that if you're white you've got a good
[01:42:57.860 --> 01:43:02.100]  chance at uh being killed or shot so i mean here's my problem i don't care if
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:04.580]  you're black or white or what color you are you threaten me i'm going to get
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:08.260]  real mad and listen all these gang beggars need to know
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:11.620]  the citizens are all armed to the teeth and i don't know what they think is
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:15.060]  going to happen if they try to go to some cops house and kill people i mean
[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:18.100]  this is going to get really nasty and then if it blows up here
[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:21.620]  i think obama who's behind the scenes trying to stir this up he's been caught
[01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:25.220]  once a race war that could be his only surprise now
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:28.580]  in his last two years of office i think it's a very serious situation i mean
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:31.780]  he's he's trying to pass this amnesty bill so it turns the
[01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:34.740]  hispanic voter against the republicans so he can
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:38.740]  you know have the the hispanic voter on the democrat side so i mean this is all
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:42.820]  a race war at the end of the day exactly the problem is
[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:46.340]  hispanic americans in the polls aren't for open borders
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:49.620]  like i saw a poll where 31 of democrats are supporting it
[01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:52.900]  and that's dropping every day if you're a hispanic american
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:56.500]  how does bringing 40 million unskilled people i mean we used to get skilled
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:44:00.100]  people from mexico at least they'd work a lot of americans are spoiled
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:03.460]  so yeah i mean i'll i'll i'll grant it that
[01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:07.060]  you know mexican laborers carpenters folks worked their butts off
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:11.300]  are good people on average the problem is now latin america is collapsing
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:15.540]  all the welfare queens from down there weigh 500 pounds i'm not being mean
[01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:20.340]  you know six x underwear that's who's showing up or unaccompanied kids
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:26.340]  this is a total drain on the system we have high unemployment if we had 100
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:30.020]  percent or 98 percent employment bring in foreigners we don't need it it's
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:33.700]  bad for the country
[01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:36.580]  exactly and this stuff's not going to help at all either i mean
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:39.860]  you know they're expecting things in atlanta to pop off as well
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:44.420]  chicago la and new york you know because after the
[01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:50.340]  initial uh protest that uh jacari and uh josh owens and marcos and i were at
[01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:54.260]  originally you know that was sparking protests all
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:57.140]  across the country but a violence breaks out here this
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:00.260]  sets a precedent for all these other uh big cities
[01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:03.300]  across the country and a lot of people are going to follow in those steps just
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:06.340]  like they did back in august for the hands up don't shoot thing
[01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:09.380]  now once they start burning buildings down and they start attacking people
[01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:12.180]  who are innocent walking up and down the street because of the color of their
[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:15.220]  skin it's going to happen everywhere we're going to have a huge problem
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:18.580]  and then you're going to see martial law just being locked down
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:22.420]  everywhere and all these major cities it's going to be crazy you know people
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:25.700]  need to prepare for the worst expect the best
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:30.500]  but at the same time you know just be smart about it i mean you know being
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:33.220]  out here today this is a pretty busy area we were out here
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:36.740]  yesterday uh driving around there's a lot of people out walking around today
[01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:39.620]  it's it's pretty dead i think a lot of people are taking the
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:42.660]  threat seriously and they're waiting to see what happens tonight
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:46.740]  what about the bad weather i was hoping bad weather when the verdict came out
[01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:51.540]  uh would keep people from going crazy that's not going to happen all people
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:55.380]  the people are still showing up they're still talk on twitter you know i found a
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:59.860]  lot of the people who uh uh organized a lot of these protests for the area
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:03.140]  and coordinate a lot of that stuff and it from the you know the chatter i've
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:06.340]  seen on twitter not one person is going to be stopped by the
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:10.180]  weather whatsoever they're determined to come out here have their voices be heard
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:13.700]  and if they have to in their opinions get violent with the police
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:17.220]  and burn down buildings to get their point across the snow will not stop well
[01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:20.660]  i'll say this i've studied the law when the police shoot our reporters rubber
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:23.780]  bullets that's criminal that's a felony attack on the first
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:27.140]  amendment but when so-called demonstrators on twitter
[01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:30.340]  and facebook say they're going to kill cops or burn things down
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:34.740]  that is felonies as well we need to get our our reporters
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:38.660]  to go look at those i've seen those myself do articles and say why aren't the
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:41.300]  police arresting people calling for violence because
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:46.820]  you have a first amendment until you say let's all meet up at the corner of
[01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:50.500]  you know six street and lo vaca and and and you know attack stuff
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:54.500]  hypothetically in austin i mean if i said that they should
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:58.340]  hear that it's probable cause you don't even need a warrant
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:02.020]  come arrest me i mean if i got on air and said go kill people
[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:05.620]  go burn things down let's go they would be knocking on the door
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:09.220]  well that's what you should do i mean if i see somebody organizing to go kill
[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:11.620]  somebody i'm gonna call the police or i'm gonna i mean
[01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:15.620]  this is outrageous that they let al qaeda and all these other groups i notice
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:19.300]  isis recruit on facebook and twitter but our stuff gets censored
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:22.820]  but the funny thing is though is that you know we've got this whole
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:25.700]  you know buzz in the air that the kkk is going to be out here
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:29.300]  and that's another thing to incite violence and to piss off a lot of these
[01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:33.220]  people you got you should go out and i forgot that angle asked locals if they
[01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:36.980]  know that most of the time these kkk demonstrations all fbi agents and stuff
[01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:41.380]  you can you can print off like orlando sentinel fbi
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:45.300]  you clan leader fbi leader it's not like they're in the group to watch them
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:49.140]  they organize they lead them and it turns out the entire leadership will
[01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:52.500]  be feds or southern boundary law center to get stuff going
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:57.540]  if you google the man who's saying he is uh the head of the kkk area around here
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:48:01.140]  frank and kona the first two things that pop up on google
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:06.580]  are his name on the fbi death list what does that mean
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:10.580]  uh people that are no longer alive at the fbi is
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:14.980]  oh yeah i know that guy from missouri he he turned out he wasn't informant i saw
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:18.500]  that but also a white supremacist leader and he's supposedly dead
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:22.260]  and yes he's on the fbi kill our dead list and then you know some of these
[01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:25.380]  other people that have popped up you know the anonymous group
[01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:28.820]  put out a list of all the kkk members they found in this area
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:32.740]  a lot of them are supposedly police officers firefighter see that's the
[01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:36.180]  problem with anonymous anonymous is anonymous so sometimes it's good people
[01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:39.460]  sometimes it's bad people anybody can use that name
[01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:44.660]  yeah look folks the syopsin we're trying to de-escalate the situation
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:48.100]  other people are trying to escalate the situation the fact that there aren't a
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:51.700]  rest being made of these violent facebook and twitter's
[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:55.220]  is is simply outrageous these are terroristic threats
[01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:59.940]  these are organizing criminal activity this is racketeering it's illegal
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:04.100]  and it makes good protesting look bad is why the feds are in it i guarantee you
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:06.820]  it's the justice department quarterbacking this we're going to skip
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:09.220]  this one network breaks we can talk to jacari jackson
[01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:13.460]  and go to phone calls ahead of john rapaport uh ronda in hawaii

[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:49.380]  all right that's joe biggs from combat in afghanistan and iraq
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:52.660]  uh to uh ferguson and the border and the rest of it
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:56.100]  one of our investigative journalists there on the ground
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:59.620]  i could see his teeth are chattering so i want to get this interview with jacari
[01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:03.380]  done and let them get back to a warm area we could do it from the hotel rooms
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:06.500]  but it looks better to have them out there in the snow covered park across from
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:10.420]  the uh courthouse two great reporters and a great team people keep asking why i
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:13.940]  send uh jacari and joe out together with josh
[01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:16.820]  showans when he can go he's not there right now
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:21.620]  it's because they work as a great team uh jacari i please don't freeze the death
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:25.060]  my friend i'm doing my best alex i'm pretty layered
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:27.860]  of it but it is really cold out here it's carry jackson
[01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:31.780]  fordton plate before from uh clain missouri like joe said if you're just
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:33.700]  now joining us we're right in front of the courthouse
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:37.220]  where they expect to uh hear the verdict on officer wilson there are some
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:40.980]  people out here protesting earlier today and i don't want everybody to lose the
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:44.420]  fact that there are peaceful protesters out here peaceful demonstrators
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:47.140]  uh they just recently finished but you have peaceful people who are walking
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:50.260]  around to say hey we want to find out what's going on we want to get to the
[01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:54.020]  bottom of the situation you know uh i know we hear a lot about the people
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:56.900]  threatening to burn things down and loot things but we also have the peaceful
[01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:58.980]  people who just want to find out what's going on
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:02.740]  in their community well that's why the feds are infiltrating and trying to
[01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:05.220]  radicalize things because they can demonize
[01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:09.220]  demonstrations while acting like they're the saviors from the local police what's
[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:13.540]  your take on the overall shyop well i think
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:17.940]  thus far you know it's been a real strong divide i think they managed to get
[01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:21.460]  that racial divide in here pretty early because we see
[01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:25.300]  um episodes of police brutality that's not debatable like a
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:28.980]  for example kelly thomas out in california the guy was beat to death
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:32.100]  you know with cops standing over him over courts of 20 mansions begging for
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:34.820]  his daddy to come and save him you know and there's nothing
[01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:38.420]  alleged about that you know there's a lot of questions a lot of speculation about
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:41.540]  what happened to mike brown and by the way they indicted those cops but they
[01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:44.100]  got off and they really shouldn't have gotten off
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:47.460]  they should have gotten some prison time and of course notice
[01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:52.660]  that guy's dad was a cop so she cops are having their sons killed by crazy cops
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:56.100]  yeah i mean you're not safe from the system and like we were out here the
[01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:59.540]  original time back in august and i was talking to some of the SWAT officers i
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:01.860]  was like you know your kids have to live in this country too
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:04.980]  you know so one day they want to come out here and protest about something
[01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:07.940]  uh they think is wrong or they think is right you know they have to deal with
[01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:11.380]  this police force they have to deal with officers pointing rifles at them for
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:15.220]  just being in a crowd on a street in the united states of america
[01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:19.540]  so hopefully the cool ahead will prevail go ahead alex what what was it like for
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:23.700]  you when they were aiming m4s with real bullets at you
[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:27.060]  when you're doing nothing and joe's doing nothing and then they're letting
[01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:30.740]  rioters operate a block away why do you think they were able to
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:35.540]  get the cops to just have such hatred for the press
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:38.740]  i think you know what it is a lot of it they didn't want the story to be told
[01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:41.700]  because the footage that we got the first night we got here because mike got
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:45.460]  shot on a saturday i believe it was we got here that following tuesday
[01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:48.740]  and you know they're aiming guns at people in the crowd and as far as i know
[01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:52.020]  we broke that story you know they're putting laser dots on people's chest
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:54.900]  and even though there are some local news outlets out there i didn't see that on
[01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:58.340]  any local news that there are aiming guns at people in the crowd until you know
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:00.820]  a couple days later when you don't see it in and the rest of the
[01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:04.420]  the big boys came out here to play so you know they don't want the press to get
[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:07.380]  the story out of course Al Jazeera everybody knows that i was right there
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:10.740]  when it happened you know they have the cameras they have the light set up
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:13.540]  yelling press press and i said mama they don't care that your friends they want
[01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:16.100]  to shoot you so you know you have to be concerned about
[01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:18.900]  things like that uh will it continue tonight i don't know
[01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:22.980]  thus far we have not had any conflicts with the police there are multiple
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:26.260]  police agencies out here this is where the county police are but some of the
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:29.620]  small towns they all have their cars rolling around here just in case
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:33.300]  something happens so we'll be here to report it hopefully that we won't have
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:37.140]  any static like we did last time but we do have the infidel body arm and we're
[01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:40.340]  definitely not thankful for that in case well they start shooting at us again
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:43.540]  in case they pulled out some live ordinance you know of course joe bigs got
[01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:46.020]  shot last time with a rubber bullet and then
[01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:49.940]  joe then they come out and say they didn't shoot any rubber bullets they came out
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:52.900]  and said that uh in a press release by the uh
[01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:56.500]  the st louis county police that no rubber bullets were fired
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:54:00.580]  no cs gas was used no flash bangs no baton rounds
[01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:03.780]  and here we are even though you picked up dozens of them big old
[01:54:03.780 --> 01:54:08.500]  50 caliber ones whoever's in my in my office in the reporter room i have on
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:12.180]  my desk a cs canister picked that up running into alex
[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:15.140]  because we brought that back from uh furgus in missouri but they said that
[01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:18.100]  was never used the rubber bullets that joe has uh
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:21.620]  they said that i had to retweet a whole bunch of pictures on twitter and it's
[01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:25.220]  now gone viral because everyone's saying oh maybe they didn't use and i had to go
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:28.260]  and publish them again to show what's being used because
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:32.100]  they're still lying it's november this happened in august they still have the
[01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:35.780]  gall to lie about it again yeah they lied about it and remember the night i
[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:38.340]  got tear gas we all got tear gas and they came out
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:42.100]  uh to all the people who were in the free speech so i said that's not tear gas
[01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:45.060]  and then and so one of the greatest some of the greatest footage that you'll
[01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:49.620]  never see on cnn uh me and joe we had to run like three miles
[01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:53.620]  outside of the the perimeter to get back to our car and i'm like man let's just go
[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:57.140]  it's soaking wet you know i'm got snot dripping on my nose and joe walks out
[01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:00.660]  to some guy sent to the cnn guy i think the camera was off there on a commercial
[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:04.020]  break or something he's like you guys are cowards tell what you said joe
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:07.540]  i was like you guys are a bunch of a bunch of cowards you're not reporting the
[01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:12.100]  truth i'm like you guys need to be real americans
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:15.540]  do your job as a journalist report what's going on stop lying
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:19.140]  for these police officers stop lying for the government and tell them that you're
[01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:21.780]  using these baton rounds let them know that you're shooting
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:25.140]  at journalists with rubber bullets well i was about to say
[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:28.740]  how can they cover up Ebola cases we know are in the u.s are disappearing people
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:32.100]  because the Forbes writers said they all met and agreed before the press conference
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:36.340]  to lie and that was even in Forbes and confirming what we
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:40.420]  have eyewitnesses and how do they cover up their bus and the illegals in
[01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:43.700]  hold on alex we have a we have a gentleman come on in here sir
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:46.580]  now tell us what you were just telling us when you when you walked up here
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:50.660]  well it happened i observe a gentleman when he was speaking i say i can't believe
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:54.580]  that i've been a walk to my truck and all the journalists and the newscasters
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:58.500]  that i ran into they just been telling falsehood is a steady line
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:01.700]  covering up for one another and i can't believe that
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:05.060]  they steady steady asking questions like what's going to happen
[01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:08.820]  after the verdict and it's such a such everybody know what's going on everybody
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:12.820]  know from the governor down what's going on to cover up and why they're doing
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:16.180]  what they're doing to me to be honest with you i honestly
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:21.380]  think they're trying to incite a riot in here in st. Louis Missouri i guess it's
[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:25.380]  for a revenue purpose or i don't know what it's for but i can't say this
[01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:29.540]  what they're doing it's uncaused for us it's unjustice and they steady line
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:33.940]  because day one they said never was a call that came across the radio
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:37.140]  was the officer approached the gentleman in the streets
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:42.260]  and now 101 days later you said that it was a call that came across the radio
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:45.780]  so what is the truth you know the truth don't need no support and one thing
[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:48.660]  about it i'm glad that these gentlemen out here
[01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:52.260]  are expressing the truth doing what needs to be done
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:56.740]  and shame on all the other newscasters that's in st. Louis Missouri
[01:56:56.740 --> 01:57:00.500]  the reporters that's not putting out the truth and you got to deal with that

[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:34.500]  investigative journalists ronda in hawaii thanks for holding great to have you
[02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:38.900]  on the broadcast hi alex thanks for having me
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:43.220]  welcome um what i wanted to say uh for us is so many things but
[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:47.380]  essentially i heard you referencing a constitutional convention
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:51.140]  and and the possible need for that um even though it's been
[02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:58.020]  highly uh i guess demonized uh with the law of the land has essentially been
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:01.140]  abolished and we know that all the things that we're seeing at the first
[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:03.700]  amendment the bill of rights is completely being crushed underneath the
[02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:07.060]  the tyranny of our own government supposedly our own government
[02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:10.100]  what people don't understand is that they are the rightful owners of
[02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:13.380]  everything that exists in this nation because we have essentially paid for it
[02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:18.340]  with our labor so why are people uh much like yourself
[02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:23.300]  and uh on all of the the i guess the underground media
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:26.900]  people afraid to organize a constitutional convention
[02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:30.180]  and and model is similar to the women's suffrage movement which was the most
[02:01:30.180 --> 02:01:33.860]  successful political movement ever i mean in three years they had a an amendment
[02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:37.460]  to the constitution and we had the right to vote and it was done at a local
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:40.500]  community level through people who understood the foundation of our
[02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:43.700]  liberties and our freedom and you know
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:48.500]  nothing that i hear on in the media it even comes close to telling us how we
[02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:52.500]  can actually correct what's wrong in this country
[02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:55.700]  well that's right and i've always been against a concon because they could
[02:01:55.700 --> 02:01:58.180]  rewrite everything while they're doing it but now
[02:01:58.180 --> 02:02:01.620]  they're just ignoring the entire bill of rights and constitution to begin with
[02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:04.740]  and the states i trust a lot more at this point you're supposed to have a
[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:08.980]  balance of power than the globalist so we need the states to go in
[02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:13.140]  and have a concon to remove the federal government of need be and reconstitute
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:15.380]  it because this is not a federal government this is a
[02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:19.540]  criminal gang taking over i mean i'm reading this article by paul joseph
[02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:23.300]  watson that i've got to go over with uh with with rapaport school
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:29.540]  teaches kids the government gives us rights and i was reading it and it says
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:33.460]  the president makes sure the country's laws are fair the commands of government
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:36.980]  officials must be obeyed by all the choices the president
[02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:39.860]  affect everyone it basically says the president's a dictator
[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:43.460]  though number six the ones this is common core the ones of the individual
[02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:48.180]  are less important than the than the uh the the wants of an individual are
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:51.380]  less important than the well-being of the nation
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:54.340]  well no the individual is taking care of them that's the cellular level the
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:58.020]  nation's healthier the individuals once are less important than well-being
[02:02:58.020 --> 02:03:03.060]  than the nation i mean they have everybody just repeat all this and it's
[02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:06.500]  written so that a parent reading this will like go along with it
[02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:12.340]  the job of the president is not easy i mean it's all just so sick what do you
[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:15.780]  think about that well i think that if we had an
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:19.620]  actual president we might have a chance if we had the
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:23.140]  the executive office operating according to its constitutional
[02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:26.900]  limitations for power rather than as a dictatorship we might have a chance of
[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:30.340]  correcting some of the ills of our nation but we had a supreme court
[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:34.340]  that operated within the constraints of the constitutional
[02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:38.820]  outline that was established to keep these different legislative different
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:42.420]  branches in check we might have a chance of correction but that's not the case
[02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:46.660]  any longer nobody in power respects the law of the
[02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:49.620]  land consequently we the people are the rightful
[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:53.780]  owners of that and we are the means of correction
[02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:57.140]  that's what thomas jefferson that's what the founders tried to tell us and teach
[02:03:57.140 --> 02:04:01.060]  us we are the only hope of restoring the law of the
[02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:03.780]  land and we have to do it at a local level
[02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:07.300]  with personally chosen individuals who represent
[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:10.180]  obviously the minority that's what the constitutional convention is about
[02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:12.820]  because the majority are a bunch of dumbed-down sheeples
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:17.060]  who are agents of a socialist democracy that's right destroy our country
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:20.660]  that's right we've reached a point where the government is completely alien to
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:24.340]  the original bill of rights and constitution it's totally illegitimate
[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:26.980]  and anybody can read the Declaration of Independence compared to what we have
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:31.220]  now it's night and day and it's only going to get worse until
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:35.220]  people realize it's the corruption that's destroying the prosperity
[02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:38.820]  and people have to instinctively stand up against corruption
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:42.340]  every way they can god bless you i appreciate your call

[02:08:57.300 --> 02:09:02.500]  first ryan and illinois you're on the air worldwide
[02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:06.580]  hey alex appreciate what you and the team do trying to wake everybody up
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:11.140]  what's going on with our food supply and and the land all across the country
[02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:15.060]  but the poison and yes sir just the absolute
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:20.980]  i mean just all out of fault all we're doing is raising the alarm
[02:09:20.980 --> 02:09:26.500]  and i'm a fourth generation farmer and then 98 we switched over and started
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:30.500]  raising our crops or animals organically because we saw
[02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:36.900]  what was going on and it's just what big ag corporations are doing there
[02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:41.460]  slowly as the small farmers drop out and things get more and more consolidated
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:46.180]  with a fewer and fewer farmers out there it's easier to control them
[02:09:46.180 --> 02:09:49.380]  and they they don't they think they're independent but they
[02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:53.220]  they aren't farming their own ground these big ag companies are
[02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:57.700]  pushing a message and they're all just like zombies just falling in line falling
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:10:02.180]  in line and and it's raising a huge huge food
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:05.140]  security all across the country like what happened in
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:08.980]  2012 we we experienced a drought and we're on some of the most
[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:11.940]  productive ground in the world in central illinois
[02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:16.020]  and that drought just caused food prices to spike well it's because everybody's
[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:20.020]  doing the same thing there's no engine of growth in the farming
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:24.740]  community anymore that's why they use farm subsidies
[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:28.820]  and manipulation and big agra to take us from being the supplier of the
[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:33.220]  world's food to having to import food now that's a really important point
[02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:36.260]  but i know more and more people are purchasing organic
[02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:40.740]  and so that's been helping some of the smaller farmers get established or
[02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:44.820]  convert over to that have you been able to survive
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:49.380]  yeah actually we we've gone from where we were in 98 and we're not big many
[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:52.980]  means but in 98 we switched over and it's taken
[02:10:52.980 --> 02:10:56.180]  probably five six years to get things going but
[02:10:56.180 --> 02:11:02.260]  the the thing that worries me is the longer this continues where people
[02:11:02.260 --> 02:11:07.220]  in the community like our ag community the longer these farmers keep doing the
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:10.580]  same status quo thing that they're getting
[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:14.820]  brainwashing and doing the more the soil becomes dead and the longer it's
[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:18.100]  going to take to get it back
[02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:21.540]  interesting point yeah they're trying to kill the original diverse farming
[02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:24.980]  culture where all you know is this chemical poisonous agriculture
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:28.820]  thank you so much ryan and the studies out there of what all these chemicals

[02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:10.100]  line in the sand well i mean nuremberg was all about don't

[02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:20.500]  info wars.com you know they call it a school
[02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:24.980]  handout or homework but really what it is is brainwashing
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:28.020]  school teaches kids the government gives us rights
[02:12:28.020 --> 02:12:31.380]  god-given freedoms are in fact quote special privileges
[02:12:31.380 --> 02:12:35.460]  granted by the state and it goes in to say
[02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:41.300]  that everything is a privilege rights and special privileges the government
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:44.500]  gives you close quote because the government gives us rights we have the
[02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:47.620]  duty to be good citizens these are quotes
[02:12:47.620 --> 02:12:50.660]  we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal
[02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:54.180]  that they are endowed by their creator that's been taken out and then it goes
[02:12:54.180 --> 02:12:57.860]  on to say that the president's job is not easy
[02:12:57.860 --> 02:13:02.980]  the nation's people do not always agree the president chooses
[02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:07.220]  choices affect everyone he makes sure the country's laws are fair
[02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:11.220]  the government commands must be obeyed and they have the kid copy that
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:14.900]  really no government commands that are unconstitutional and obviously illegal
[02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:19.460]  are not obeyed but they just sit there and brainwash the kids
[02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:23.220]  this is nothing but school to prison pipeline period
[02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:27.620]  premeditated does that mean the average cop or jailkeeper is a bad person no
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:30.500]  but our economy is converting to a prison system
[02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:33.860]  this is happening they're expanding and it's a nightmare i appreciate your

[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:18.340]  all their rights i mean this is common core this is
[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:21.860]  cult level just showing us who runs this government
[02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:25.380]  it's so premeditated when we come face to face with tyranny
[02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:29.380]  do we have the capacity to recognize it and say no
[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:33.060]  and then also under common core this is out of the egan news
[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:37.380]  report chicago school teaches quote safe anal sex
[02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:40.820]  to fifth graders a graphic sexual education curriculum here for chicago
[02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:43.780]  public schools fifth and sixth grade shock parents
[02:14:43.780 --> 02:14:47.300]  during a presentation given during report and pickup at andrew jackson
[02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:50.980]  language academy the presentation includes slides that are clearly not
[02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:56.100]  age appropriate including demonstrations of applying male and female condoms
[02:14:56.100 --> 02:15:00.180]  and it goes on while cps uh spokesman bill mccaffey
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:03.060]  has said a statement that this objection material presented
[02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:06.740]  at andrew jackson language academy this week is not and never was part
[02:15:06.740 --> 02:15:10.820]  of the sexual orientation curriculum as reported at the local nbc affiliate
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:14.180]  the slides show the parents are also posted
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:17.620]  at walters elementary school as part of sexual health education
[02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:21.620]  look folks we used to tell people 10 years ago that they were giving kids
[02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:25.780]  flu shots without consent they would lie about it then they'd say it was an
[02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:28.980]  accident now from alabama to california
[02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:32.500]  those two states just this month have been caught giving kids flu shots
[02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:37.940]  without consent that's a felony but they just do it
[02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:43.620]  are they attempting to overthrow reality it seems their propaganda is back
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:48.180]  firing on them it seems it's not working but they
[02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:50.740]  still keep doing it is there a method of the madness
[02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:55.460]  or has the establishment insulated from real criticism and echo chambers
[02:15:55.460 --> 02:15:59.620]  become delusional we know elites go insane there's a central global
[02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:04.580]  conspiracy a program that's public but more and more i see an unraveling
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:09.300]  because their own operatives have been above the law and so
[02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:13.620]  they're outside of the free market of being punished and so they're becoming
[02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:16.420]  delusional john rapaport you're a smart guy when it
[02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:19.460]  comes to psyops no more fake news dot com what do you
[02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:23.540]  think's really going on yeah i think they've gone crazy alex
[02:16:23.540 --> 02:16:27.220]  i think uh we're looking at you know end stage
[02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:31.140]  insanity here the government commands
[02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:37.140]  you obey uh the rights that you have come from the government
[02:16:37.140 --> 02:16:42.340]  i mean that on the face of it is complete lunacy and it's the kind of uh
[02:16:42.340 --> 02:16:48.420]  you know we're entitled to tell you where your rights come from what you can do
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:51.940]  what you can't do there's nothing you can do about that
[02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:56.660]  because we're immune we're buffered off from any criticism we've got the media
[02:16:56.660 --> 02:17:00.660]  under control and then when they this insane
[02:17:00.660 --> 02:17:04.740]  you know these sex programs education programs in school
[02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:08.820]  the one you just mentioned the anal sex you know deal
[02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:12.420]  they always deny this i mean i've seen this happen time time again
[02:17:12.420 --> 02:17:17.140]  we didn't put this up this isn't really part of the system that we teach
[02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:22.420]  and then they'll say well it's an optional program and it's actually funded
[02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:25.940]  by somebody else they just keep tap dancing and lying but the
[02:17:25.940 --> 02:17:29.380]  truth is they're doing it they're doing it all the time
[02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:32.900]  and this is just you know these are mind control
[02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:38.740]  factories these schools and so the elites who have been running these
[02:17:38.740 --> 02:17:43.060]  programs forever these programs in public schools
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:48.260]  are just now automatic they just churn themselves out without any
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:51.380]  nobody has to make a phone call from high up to get them
[02:17:51.380 --> 02:17:55.620]  to do what they're going to do they're just following their
[02:17:55.620 --> 02:18:00.660]  instructions from years and years ago and they keep expanding this insanity
[02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:05.060]  and nobody calls them on that's the problem
[02:18:05.060 --> 02:18:08.180]  i mean these parents at the chicago schools
[02:18:08.180 --> 02:18:13.860]  should rise up unmasked march on the school demands to talk to the principal
[02:18:13.860 --> 02:18:17.780]  the the head of the board of education
[02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:22.420]  we want you to say why you put this in who told you to put it that's right let
[02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:27.620]  me throw this in this is a great example uh gruber comes out now in five tapes
[02:18:27.620 --> 02:18:31.620]  and says he met with the president developed the lies to rip everybody off
[02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:34.980]  they use non transparency and the public stupidness
[02:18:34.980 --> 02:18:38.980]  to get it done and it's making everybody upset this is the attitude
[02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:42.180]  but in these videos in three of the five he's teaching
[02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:47.780]  phd's how things really work that's why they have delphi technique they send
[02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:51.780]  them these training seminars to say there is no vaccine exemption form when
[02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:54.580]  they know it's there to say we didn't shoot your cut up without
[02:18:54.580 --> 02:18:57.460]  your permission to say we didn't teach your
[02:18:57.460 --> 02:19:02.020]  five-year-old how to have anal sex they are just lying as you said and then the
[02:19:02.020 --> 02:19:05.620]  parents go to the next school and it's hanging on the wall
[02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:09.700]  so again that's what's so diabolical is that they're teaching
[02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:13.940]  right down to the grassroots how to deceive everybody else it's it is a
[02:19:13.940 --> 02:19:19.300]  massive criminal conspiracy no question about it and the only i mean
[02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:22.660]  the only vulnerability that exists at the level of children
[02:19:22.660 --> 02:19:30.180]  is when the parents stand up and refuse okay here we are
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:34.100]  600 parents knocking on your door mr principal
[02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:38.260]  now you have a choice we'll either take our kids out of school all together

[02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:23.540]  tortured way to make sure cbo did not score the mandate as taxes
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:26.260]  if cbo scored the mandate as taxes the bill dies
[02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:29.780]  okay so it's written to do that in terms of in terms of
[02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:33.700]  risk-rated subsidies to get a law which said healthy people are going to pay in
[02:24:33.700 --> 02:24:36.340]  it made explicit the healthy will pay in and sick people get money it would not
[02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:39.540]  have passed okay just like the people
[02:24:39.540 --> 02:24:43.380]  transparent lack of transparency is a huge political advantage
[02:24:43.380 --> 02:24:46.740]  and basically you know call it the stupidity american voter or whatever
[02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:49.620]  all right but basically that was really we're going to get into
[02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:52.820]  sterilization here in a minute but but this is important because it's the
[02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:57.220]  playing dumb and what john rapaport and i just got into if you just tuned in
[02:24:57.220 --> 02:25:01.540]  i'm your host alex jones you're listening to info wars
[02:25:02.580 --> 02:25:08.900]  everywhere they teach cops how to lie they teach school teachers how to lie
[02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:12.900]  they teach the school administrators how to lie they teach the county how to lie
[02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:16.180]  they teach the city how to lie the state attorneys i had this one of the main
[02:25:16.180 --> 02:25:20.580]  state attorneys on for maryland when they were saying it's the law all the
[02:25:20.580 --> 02:25:24.100]  kids have to have the shots it was on cnn like six seven years ago they were
[02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:26.100]  going in crying to get shots at the courthouse
[02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:29.700]  and i said but there's a waiver because it's not a law it's a school policy
[02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:32.500]  you're supposed to give them the waiver he goes you ought to be a lawyer you're
[02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:36.580]  right the judge has those at his desk but you've got a request one
[02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:39.620]  and no one tells them and i said do you take vaccines he goes no
[02:25:39.620 --> 02:25:44.340]  neither did my kids started laughing like we were winners he was laughing with
[02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:48.740]  me on and off air because we were laughing at all the people
[02:25:48.740 --> 02:25:52.340]  with swat teams and police dogs barking as they went into the courthouse
[02:25:53.060 --> 02:25:59.380]  as this image of you've got to take vaccines so so ignorant people watching tv
[02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:02.820]  would see that and believe they had to take shots and was mainly black people
[02:26:02.820 --> 02:26:08.740]  going in to be shot up in maryland they're in uh baltimore and so what i'm getting
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:15.220]  at here is it's a culture of fraud and tyranny really is when organized crime
[02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:20.100]  and fraud takes over your government and i'll say it again i'm not bashing police
[02:26:20.100 --> 02:26:23.140]  because i found they're more awake on average the general public
[02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:29.220]  the military is very awake so so it's a natural ally at one level but also a
[02:26:29.220 --> 02:26:34.660]  very dangerous situation but john what i'm trying to get at here is
[02:26:34.660 --> 02:26:38.660]  it's amazing just like the sterilization it's in all the un documents the funding
[02:26:38.660 --> 02:26:42.980]  they've been caught for 50 years over and over again doing it giving people polio
[02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:48.900]  spreading it shooting people up with sv 40 sterilizing women with the tetanus shots
[02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:52.340]  they just got caught again you just wrote about it but the few minutes we've
[02:26:52.340 --> 02:26:55.940]  gotten the short segment speak to what i'm getting at how do we articulate this
[02:26:55.940 --> 02:27:00.500]  to people because they call it and go my school you know in austin says it's the
[02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:04.020]  law my kid will be kicked out and i'll be arrested and i go they're going to use
[02:27:04.020 --> 02:27:07.860]  policy to kick them out and claim truancy but the law doesn't say they can kick
[02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:11.780]  you out for no vaccine they're they're fraudulently going to have the police
[02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:17.060]  come in and arrest you for the truancy but they're not supposed to so it's
[02:27:17.060 --> 02:27:22.180]  fraud but the cop doesn't even know that themselves and neither will even the
[02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:25.860]  grand jury if it was to go to them if you don't play bargain
[02:27:25.860 --> 02:27:31.700]  i mean i used to actually go to these courts and warn people in the
[02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:34.980]  outside i did this just a few times and then we get so upset so what i'm saying
[02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:39.220]  is it's a it's an organized crime deal but only the judge and only the school
[02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:42.340]  administrators know of the fraud isn't that incredible
[02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:46.900]  oh yeah it's that incredible and more i mean
[02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:50.980]  remember what polosi said about obama care you know you have to
[02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:55.380]  we have to pass the legislation in order for you to be able to know what it
[02:27:55.380 --> 02:27:59.060]  says which indicated of course what everybody knew
[02:27:59.060 --> 02:28:04.100]  which was none of the congressman who voted for it even knew what was in it
[02:28:04.100 --> 02:28:09.380]  the thousands of pages so when i when i heard this you know when i recovered from
[02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:13.460]  it this was some time ago i thought back to when i grew up
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:17.220]  i mean if the new york times had printed on the front page
[02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:22.420]  congress passes law affecting all americans without reading it
[02:28:22.420 --> 02:28:26.420]  you know that would have been a gigantic scandal i mean that would have never
[02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:31.380]  stopped but drip by drip drop by drop the
[02:28:31.380 --> 02:28:36.180]  lying the fraud becomes so embedded in public life
[02:28:36.180 --> 02:28:40.660]  private life everywhere corporate life that people don't even blink now when
[02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:44.500]  this guy groover says well of course we're not transparent i mean
[02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:49.060]  what idiot would be transparent that's not the way to get a law passed
[02:28:49.060 --> 02:28:54.020]  we live in a pr society everything is about public relations
[02:28:54.020 --> 02:28:57.780]  and the public unfortunately has gotten used to that
[02:28:57.780 --> 02:29:02.660]  and accepts it to a tremendous degree that people will say and do anything in
[02:29:02.660 --> 02:29:06.740]  order to achieve their objectives and they say well of course i mean
[02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:09.940]  that's the way the world works so who would think it'd be any different you
[02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:13.460]  know but it's of course it's different i mean
[02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:18.020]  as you say this is organized crime all the way to the top
[02:29:18.020 --> 02:29:23.300]  and people have to start rebelling against it that is what wakes people up
[02:29:23.300 --> 02:29:28.020]  usually wait too late will be like mexico or north korea never get out of it
[02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:32.420]  because it'll just become so systematic this is what destroys wealth it's what
[02:29:32.420 --> 02:29:36.020]  destroys civilizations and it's reached cuckoo level

[02:33:27.860 --> 02:33:32.580]  this just went live on prisonplanet.com and info wars dot com lawsuit
[02:33:32.580 --> 02:33:36.740]  comes at the worst possible time as protesters
[02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:43.460]  stage in ferguson or protesters mass in ferguson missouri
[02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:47.940]  a pregnant woman says she was raped in jail by a ferguson police officer last
[02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:51.060]  october according to a federal lawsuit filed friday
[02:33:51.060 --> 02:33:56.100]  the woman jw in her initials in the suit was stopped by the accused officer
[02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:59.060]  jaris hayden on october 13 because her license plate
[02:33:59.060 --> 02:34:02.260]  were expired she should have just been illegally to let her go
[02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:06.420]  and hayden arrested her after she gave a false name
[02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:09.620]  you smell good jw claims officer hayden said
[02:34:09.620 --> 02:34:12.740]  to her during her booking this will teach you a lesson
[02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:16.660]  jw's boyfriend eventually posted her bond but officer hayden
[02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:21.620]  said she still had a traffic warrants for other cities
[02:34:21.620 --> 02:34:25.460]  and then it goes on in exchange for securing her release officer hayden
[02:34:25.460 --> 02:34:31.220]  took jw to a boiler room and proceeded to have sex with her
[02:34:31.220 --> 02:34:34.260]  and she did not resist out of fear according to the lawsuit
[02:34:34.260 --> 02:34:38.500]  the suit also claims that officer hayden led her to a side room and told her to
[02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:40.580]  stay close to the building when leaving to
[02:34:40.580 --> 02:34:42.740]  presumably stay on the side of security cameras
[02:34:42.740 --> 02:34:47.060]  jw went to the hospital afterwards and dna tests confirmed pubic hair on her
[02:34:47.060 --> 02:34:50.980]  body from hayden looks bad according to the lawsuit
[02:34:50.980 --> 02:34:53.780]  lawyers will put stuff in lawsuits aren't true though i'm not saying it
[02:34:53.780 --> 02:34:56.740]  didn't true i'm just saying i don't believe anything i see these days
[02:34:56.740 --> 02:35:00.260]  the conduct of the city of ferguson law enforcement and engaging in
[02:35:00.260 --> 02:35:02.660]  repeated acts of violence and constitutional violations against the
[02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:05.380]  citizens constitutes a pattern of lawsuits says
[02:35:05.380 --> 02:35:09.380]  lawsuit comes at a poor time for the city as protesters are expected to riot
[02:35:09.380 --> 02:35:14.420]  in response to the jury decision on whether to
[02:35:14.420 --> 02:35:18.260]  then died officer darren wilson who shot and killed 18-year-old michael
[02:35:18.260 --> 02:35:22.020]  brown during altercation great job turning this out just as it breaks
[02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:26.820]  kit daniels but we might just add the point here that
[02:35:26.820 --> 02:35:31.460]  thugs are you are planning to use protesters cover to riot
[02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:38.180]  and and delegitimize because we just say protesters are expected to riot
[02:35:38.180 --> 02:35:42.740]  and that's what the media says but we don't have time to edit stuff here on
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:45.460]  the air and i'm trying to they got a great team has to do all this out
[02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:48.500]  openly on the air ferguson cop rapes woman in jail
[02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:53.860]  lawsuit claims lawsuit comes at worst possible time as protesters
[02:35:53.860 --> 02:35:57.940]  mass stages the word in ferguson good good report there we'll see what happens
[02:35:57.940 --> 02:36:01.620]  from it you know i wouldn't believe stuff like
[02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:06.020]  this if so many cops weren't pleading guilty to raping women
[02:36:06.020 --> 02:36:09.300]  and the old thing is you know cops pull up by the topless bar on the dance was
[02:36:09.300 --> 02:36:12.340]  leave it to pull them over and say look you know
[02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:16.180]  give me oral sex and i won't take in for dwi
[02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:19.380]  i don't know if this guy's guilty or not it's just a lawsuit i also know
[02:36:19.380 --> 02:36:24.980]  criminals lie a lot it's amazing how people in this world of fraud
[02:36:24.980 --> 02:36:30.180]  think making something up gives them power and so when you've had people make
[02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:35.060]  stuff up about you you name it you just start to like want to see some
[02:36:35.060 --> 02:36:38.660]  proof and i want to see it from cops when they
[02:36:38.660 --> 02:36:40.980]  say i'm about you know something about me and i want to see them people say
[02:36:40.980 --> 02:36:43.780]  something about them
[02:36:44.420 --> 02:36:50.180]  so um it's what rabble port was just getting into the corruption of society
[02:36:50.180 --> 02:36:53.860]  this is what brought mexico down it's what's bringing latin america and asia
[02:36:53.860 --> 02:36:59.940]  down and the middle east down they're not economies based on honor
[02:36:59.940 --> 02:37:06.980]  based on doing business with folks that you can do a handshake deal with people
[02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:10.580]  think i think half the public if you're nice to them
[02:37:10.580 --> 02:37:14.500]  don't be mean to them treat them good with respect
[02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:17.540]  that you're there to be fed on you're there to be pushed around you're there
[02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:21.460]  to be used and you know that they get an advantage by screwing somebody
[02:37:21.460 --> 02:37:24.660]  well you might the first couple times when you end up dying alone you end up
[02:37:24.660 --> 02:37:27.540]  being alone and i just think my lucky star is every
[02:37:27.540 --> 02:37:30.900]  day that i am part of a culture of honorable people
[02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:34.660]  and folks that don't backstab and play games and and and and
[02:37:34.660 --> 02:37:39.140]  so many people are sociopathic now where they think that if they can screw you
[02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:42.980]  over that's winning even though a real sociopath would know
[02:37:42.980 --> 02:37:45.860]  being honorable
[02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:49.460]  long term is actually the best way to be successful
[02:37:49.460 --> 02:37:53.460]  i was always honorable because that's how i was raised in my genetics
[02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:57.300]  that's why they always attack my honor in the media because they want to say i'm
[02:37:57.300 --> 02:37:59.940]  dishonorable because they know my greatest attribute is that i am
[02:37:59.940 --> 02:38:03.540]  honorable so the young people out there staying
[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:08.900]  out of the system is winning becoming independent that means wealthy
[02:38:08.900 --> 02:38:11.940]  even if it's middle class or just you know working class if you own your own
[02:38:11.940 --> 02:38:15.220]  business your own house you don't have to answer anybody
[02:38:15.220 --> 02:38:18.100]  you're successful
[02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:21.860]  it's the gang mentality rapid port i'm ranting here figure
[02:38:21.860 --> 02:38:24.100]  give me your comment on what i just said about that and then i want to get
[02:38:24.100 --> 02:38:27.860]  into the sterilization
[02:38:27.860 --> 02:38:31.220]  i see it at all levels alex just like we're discussing here
[02:38:31.220 --> 02:38:36.820]  as you say how can i take advantage of the situation in order to lie
[02:38:36.820 --> 02:38:43.460]  cheat steal commit fraud it's just one giant i mean talk
[02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:48.500]  about the melding pot that's what this country keeps on becoming
[02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:52.580]  over and over in bigger and bigger terms at every level
[02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:58.900]  is the fraud getting over on people the sociopathic behavior
[02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:03.540]  etc etc you see it at every single possible level
[02:39:03.540 --> 02:39:10.420]  from the biggest down to the smallest and somewhere this is learned behavior
[02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:14.900]  i mean because we don't have a hundred percent sociopaths in this country
[02:39:14.900 --> 02:39:18.820]  i mean this is more this is the culture this is learned
[02:39:18.820 --> 02:39:22.980]  this is understood it's learned through television it's learned through schools
[02:39:22.980 --> 02:39:27.220]  it's learned through parents it's learned through institutions of society
[02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:33.780]  and government especially because if a person experiences the intrusion
[02:39:33.780 --> 02:39:38.660]  of government on their life in a completely illegal fraudulent
[02:39:38.660 --> 02:39:41.940]  way and goes through that experience and understands
[02:39:41.940 --> 02:39:46.420]  even a little bit of how it feels from that point on
[02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:50.420]  that person is going to be changed they're not going to be the same person
[02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:56.500]  so we see it everywhere and you know the only solution to it
[02:39:56.500 --> 02:40:01.780]  is as you say to work in an honorable way because when you do people recognize
[02:40:01.780 --> 02:40:06.020]  that they understand this is different this is what i want
[02:40:06.020 --> 02:40:10.260]  this is what i thought america was this is where i'll put my allegiance
[02:40:10.260 --> 02:40:16.820]  not with these other maniacs will we ever hit a bottom i mean is there no level
[02:40:16.820 --> 02:40:22.020]  of obama people making fun of us laughing at us calling a stupid
[02:40:22.020 --> 02:40:26.580]  how far can they go i don't think there is any bottom
[02:40:26.580 --> 02:40:34.340]  i think like everything else that counts we're talking about grassroots
[02:40:34.340 --> 02:40:39.380]  revolution a revolution in which people
[02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:43.700]  stand up in every possible way for principles
[02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:46.740]  regardless of what other people say about them regardless of what other
[02:40:46.740 --> 02:40:51.380]  people do and there's something
[02:40:51.380 --> 02:40:56.180]  fortunately that's very contagious about that when people see it happening
[02:40:56.180 --> 02:41:00.260]  you've come across these stories you know somebody defends their home
[02:41:00.260 --> 02:41:08.020]  against an intruder successfully legally with a gun somebody is growing
[02:41:08.020 --> 02:41:11.940]  their own food somebody is standing up for what's right
[02:41:11.940 --> 02:41:16.020]  and all of a sudden a huge number of people say that's right
[02:41:16.020 --> 02:41:19.300]  this is what we thought america was supposed to be
[02:41:19.300 --> 02:41:26.180]  so the more of that we can see the better the chances that you know we win
[02:41:26.180 --> 02:41:29.780]  but as far as how low those other guys will sink
[02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:36.100]  uh man there's no bottom there is no bottom until they go from smart criminal
[02:41:36.100 --> 02:41:39.220]  conspirators but still evil to delusional
[02:41:39.220 --> 02:41:42.500]  nutcases that think they can burn down half the city because they want to
[02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:49.620]  expand their palace aka uh nero exactly when that happens
[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:53.220]  then they you know then they've committed suicide and you know
[02:41:53.220 --> 02:41:57.060]  that's going to happen it's already starting to happen why do elites whether
[02:41:57.060 --> 02:42:00.020]  it's hitler or stallin we know stallin was poisoned
[02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:03.380]  why do they always push till they fail if hitler would have stopped
[02:42:03.380 --> 02:42:06.580]  it just poland and czechoslovakia and austria
[02:42:06.580 --> 02:42:10.020]  he was going to be left alone then he goes and gets france
[02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:13.940]  attacks england declares war on the u.s and then
[02:42:13.940 --> 02:42:20.180]  turns against the russians you know 170 million of them that in a whole
[02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:24.820]  bunch of wars and never give up i mean i don't know what he was thinking
[02:42:24.820 --> 02:42:28.420]  when his big hero uh napoleon got defeated by him
[02:42:28.420 --> 02:42:32.180]  bismarck couldn't beat him uh i mean imagine somebody trying to invade america
[02:42:32.180 --> 02:42:34.340]  you can only do it from within the way we're seeing
[02:42:34.340 --> 02:42:37.460]  and opening the borders up you couldn't do it the other way so i give the
[02:42:37.460 --> 02:42:42.180]  globalist that i mean why is it that evil elites always
[02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:48.100]  who show that they're genius early on go crazy and do things that destroy them
[02:42:48.100 --> 02:42:53.460]  i think it's because you can't turn back when you've committed a certain amount
[02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:57.700]  of evil because in order to turn back or stop
[02:42:57.700 --> 02:43:01.860]  what you're doing you have to admit that there's another way
[02:43:01.860 --> 02:43:05.460]  that there's another viewpoint that there's that there's a thing called
[02:43:05.460 --> 02:43:09.220]  right and the thing called wrong that's what
[02:43:09.220 --> 02:43:13.940]  tortures these psychopaths but if they were to stop
[02:43:13.940 --> 02:43:18.420]  they would have to think and reflect and realize what they've done
[02:43:18.420 --> 02:43:22.260]  so they just give in to this contagion of evil and they do
[02:43:22.260 --> 02:43:25.940]  insane things and then they destroy themselves
[02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:30.820]  they can't stop because to stop is eventually to admit
[02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:35.540]  and understand what you've done that's why they just don't ever stop until
[02:43:35.540 --> 02:43:40.500]  somebody stops them well that's right and
[02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:44.180]  21 million germans died in world war two
[02:43:44.180 --> 02:43:47.300]  that's more than the third of their population they're about 75 million when
[02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:51.060]  the war started they were less than 55 million when it was over
[02:43:51.060 --> 02:43:55.220]  conversely 22 million russians died in that war folks you need to understand
[02:43:55.220 --> 02:43:59.300]  that when politicians go crazy this is where it leads
[02:43:59.300 --> 02:44:02.420]  and i'm seeing the exact type of craze-eyed
[02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:05.620]  nuttiness out of our elites and i've studied
[02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:09.300]  our previous elites eisenhower people before them they had their own issues
[02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:14.260]  but they were not as delusional they had been in
[02:44:14.260 --> 02:44:18.420]  frontline combat in world war one they had been in
[02:44:18.420 --> 02:44:21.140]  real-world events they'd been on the boxing club
[02:44:21.140 --> 02:44:26.420]  they'd been sharecroppers they'd been now the elites are so insulated and so
[02:44:26.420 --> 02:44:30.020]  weak when i look at gruber and people that
[02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:33.860]  it really gives me a sick feeling to realize that our leadership
[02:44:33.860 --> 02:44:40.100]  is a bunch of soft trash remember that famous statement of madeline albright's
[02:44:40.100 --> 02:44:45.060]  between the two wars in iraq when she was asked well you know the
[02:44:45.060 --> 02:44:51.220]  sanctions against iraq have killed 500 000 children in iraq do you
[02:44:51.220 --> 02:44:55.540]  think that's worth it and she sat there on 60 minutes and said you know
[02:44:55.540 --> 02:45:00.500]  yes i do i think it really was it's a tough call
[02:45:00.500 --> 02:45:04.740]  but yes it's worth it i mean that's you know
[02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:11.220]  how much more sociopathic can you get and how much more insulated can you get
[02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:14.500]  than to be sitting in some high perch somewhere
[02:45:14.500 --> 02:45:17.460]  making a decision that's going to kill half a million kids
[02:45:17.460 --> 02:45:21.460]  remember george soros did 60 minutes and admitted he helped hitler and helped
[02:45:21.460 --> 02:45:25.300]  round up thousands and said he felt no guilt for it
[02:45:25.300 --> 02:45:29.300]  there you go what about i mean why would he go on tv and say i feel no
[02:45:29.300 --> 02:45:32.820]  guilt i mean i just you know
[02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:40.180]  yeah i mean that's like asking you know why is the lunatic a lunatic uh he can't
[02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:43.460]  turn back you know i mean how much more wealthy
[02:45:43.460 --> 02:45:46.900]  does he want to get he's still manipulating markets he's
[02:45:46.900 --> 02:45:52.260]  still going after more money and more money is why he has you know he could
[02:45:52.260 --> 02:45:57.140]  live 50 lifetimes at least on the on whether wealth he's accumulated
[02:45:57.140 --> 02:46:01.460]  already because he can't stop because if he were to stop
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:05.380]  and engage in real conversation with people and actually meet
[02:46:05.380 --> 02:46:09.620]  some genuine people outside his elite circles
[02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:16.500]  he would begin to fathom how evil he is he just has to keep on going
[02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:19.780]  that's right there are a bunch of insulated super elites
[02:46:19.780 --> 02:46:24.100]  who hate the middle class and new wealth who are believing their own bs and i'm
[02:46:24.100 --> 02:46:28.260]  just here to tell you guys you're going down everybody knows who's done it
[02:46:28.260 --> 02:46:31.060]  i don't care you got half the public not knowing their name or finding their
[02:46:31.060 --> 02:46:34.820]  butt with both hands a large minority worldwide knows who you are
[02:46:34.820 --> 02:46:37.940]  you're going to be brought to justice we're coming for you
[02:46:37.940 --> 02:46:41.380]  so i would suggest for your kids and grandkids future
[02:46:41.380 --> 02:46:44.660]  you back off now instead of threatening to destroy the whole planet in the
[02:46:44.660 --> 02:46:47.140]  process now let's shift gears they look at the
[02:46:47.140 --> 02:46:49.860]  giant third world with the stain want to reduce their population
[02:46:49.860 --> 02:46:53.140]  because i see them as a plague living on their property
[02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:55.940]  john certainly if you've been to calcutta or mexico city
[02:46:55.940 --> 02:46:59.060]  there are too many people in certain areas but we've done the population
[02:46:59.060 --> 02:47:02.340]  actuary if you don't have two kids for every two adults things collapse
[02:47:02.340 --> 02:47:05.140]  population will plane off at about nine billion
[02:47:05.140 --> 02:47:08.500]  all the actuary show there are some problems with dirty technology but
[02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:11.780]  we're cleaning it up but regardless of that debate you can
[02:47:11.780 --> 02:47:15.940]  correct me if you don't agree with that we can't have the un running around
[02:47:15.940 --> 02:47:19.860]  putting sterilants in the tetanus shod and in live polio clearly in a
[02:47:19.860 --> 02:47:23.860]  population reduction program but even if the yuppies are for that
[02:47:23.860 --> 02:47:29.300]  in some deep-seated you know greed that well there's less people i get more
[02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:34.660]  they're doing it also to us here as well uh with weaker compounds so it's not as
[02:47:34.660 --> 02:47:38.340]  noticeable in the soft kill get into your report on this that's at no more
[02:47:38.340 --> 02:47:42.340]  fake news dot com and info wars dot com that we put up
[02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:47.940]  last week uh breaking all of this down depopulation vaccine in kenya and
[02:47:47.940 --> 02:47:52.980]  beyond we've now got major scientists and catholic bishops going public
[02:47:52.980 --> 02:47:57.060]  yeah they're going public and basically what it is
[02:47:57.060 --> 02:48:03.460]  is one of the more primitive research tools of the depopulation gang
[02:48:03.460 --> 02:48:09.460]  which means rockfeller fund world health organization united nations so
[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:16.020]  beloved uh on the left you know uh the population council
[02:48:16.020 --> 02:48:20.740]  rockfeller it money is everywhere in this and has been
[02:48:20.740 --> 02:48:30.100]  for 50 years more hcg which is a hormone that assists in maintaining
[02:48:30.100 --> 02:48:34.500]  pregnancy has been put into vaccines in kenya it was done in the
[02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:40.020]  philippines and other places the body woman's body reacts by
[02:48:40.020 --> 02:48:44.740]  treating it as an invader as a disease entity
[02:48:44.740 --> 02:48:48.900]  and tries to destroy it so that when later on she gets pregnant she's going to
[02:48:48.900 --> 02:48:52.580]  have a miscarriage because she treats that sustaining
[02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:59.300]  life-giving hormone as if it were a virus or some other kind of germ
[02:48:59.300 --> 02:49:03.940]  in my article which people can read i indicate the studies that have been done
[02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:07.140]  where they were done when they were done the unit admits they did this for those
[02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:10.260]  who don't know it also then soft kills the women because
[02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:14.580]  now they have autoimmune responses every time hcg is released in lower
[02:49:14.580 --> 02:49:18.740]  amounts outside of pregnancy they create an autoimmune response
[02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:22.900]  to the hcg so it also ends up basically killing the women
[02:49:22.900 --> 02:49:28.020]  but it's long and grueling yeah that's the horrible part of it and that's just
[02:49:28.020 --> 02:49:31.700]  one way to depopulate people
[02:49:31.700 --> 02:49:34.980]  medically i mean there are chemicals there of course
[02:49:34.980 --> 02:49:38.580]  operations surgeries we've just been reading about one that went
[02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:42.980]  horribly wrong uh and there are there is
[02:49:42.980 --> 02:49:48.340]  you know research ongoing all the time on how to introduce
[02:49:48.340 --> 02:49:52.900]  anti-fertility and sterility compounds into vaccines

[02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:25.140]  that how could this even happen because hcg is a natural hormone in the body
[02:50:25.140 --> 02:50:28.180]  how could i mean it doesn't even make sense they bind it to tetanus it's

[02:50:39.860 --> 02:50:43.860]  because they don't want to start looking at their own vaccine programs

[02:54:34.660 --> 02:54:37.940]  for myself personally we've already gone over all the facts surrounding it
[02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:41.940]  the usual medical quality 80 percent of it is the metha cabalamin
[02:54:41.940 --> 02:54:45.140]  of the type that is injectable you you don't inject this and you shouldn't
[02:54:45.140 --> 02:54:48.180]  inject it but it's the same molecule it's it's it's the
[02:54:48.180 --> 02:54:50.980]  same exact type and the other 20 percent is it is the other
[02:54:50.980 --> 02:54:54.340]  type that fuses in with it but they're both organic
[02:54:54.340 --> 02:54:57.940]  it's sold out faster anything we'd ever had
[02:54:57.940 --> 02:55:04.020]  and we'd already they were late shipping as the whole shipment

[02:56:43.380 --> 02:56:47.940]  uh just ignoring this isn't going to protect them
[02:56:47.940 --> 02:56:51.060]  when you know Bill Amell and the Gates Foundation gives a million kids the
[02:56:51.060 --> 02:56:55.380]  polio vaccine and 64 000 get paralyzed 3000 die
[02:56:55.380 --> 02:57:00.500]  i mean they can't cover this up anymore no and this is one of the most vital
[02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:04.980]  movements uh really on the planet is people
[02:57:04.980 --> 02:57:09.060]  understanding what vaccines are really doing i mean there are many many people
[02:57:09.060 --> 02:57:12.580]  on the planet groups individuals what have you
[02:57:12.580 --> 02:57:17.220]  mothers of autistic children and so forth they know the score
[02:57:17.220 --> 02:57:21.940]  there's no fooling them this is one of these issues where
[02:57:21.940 --> 02:57:26.820]  tremendous advance is being made regardless of what the doctors are
[02:57:26.820 --> 02:57:29.860]  saying regardless of the propaganda and the height
[02:57:29.860 --> 02:57:36.340]  from the cdc so in this case you had you know some catholic a handful of
[02:57:36.340 --> 02:57:42.180]  catholic uh prelates who got vials of this vaccine in Kenya
[02:57:42.180 --> 02:57:46.820]  sent it to different independent labs and they all came back with a verdict
[02:57:46.820 --> 02:57:51.140]  okay there's hcg in here this is an anti fertility
[02:57:51.140 --> 02:57:55.700]  vaccine and the government down there is trying to pretend nothing is happening
[02:57:55.700 --> 02:58:00.420]  nothing ever did happen let's bring it out into the open
[02:58:00.420 --> 02:58:05.220]  let's bring it all out into the open and see that this has been going on for
[02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:08.260]  50 years it's nothing new here what's new
[02:58:08.260 --> 02:58:13.460]  is possibly the numbers of women who have been vaccinated
[02:58:13.460 --> 02:58:17.540]  over a million maybe three million which makes it
[02:58:17.540 --> 02:58:21.780]  incredible ongoing crime and that's just one vaccine we have the
[02:58:21.780 --> 02:58:24.580]  hpv vaccine for supposedly cervical cancer
[02:58:24.580 --> 02:58:27.860]  being given to women worldwide and being causing infertility
[02:58:27.860 --> 02:58:32.660]  death autoimmune disorders and now bill gates wants to put it in the food

[03:00:32.820 --> 03:00:37.860]  court keeps claimants waiting back in the 70s they created the secret
[03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:42.020]  vaccine court expanded in the 80s and they cover up all people to get killed
[03:00:42.020 --> 03:00:44.900]  or die for the vaccine when they you know you drop dead right there they have to
[03:00:44.900 --> 03:00:49.380]  pay it out an ap read hundreds of decisions conducted
[03:00:49.380 --> 03:00:53.380]  more than 200 interviews and analyzed the database of more than 14,500
[03:00:53.380 --> 03:00:57.620]  cases filed in a special vaccine court that database with current as of
[03:00:57.620 --> 03:01:00.340]  2013 the government has refused to release
[03:01:00.340 --> 03:01:04.180]  an updated version since and they will not pay when people
[03:01:04.180 --> 03:01:08.340]  win so see government just and i think there's
[03:01:08.340 --> 03:01:12.420]  four billion dollars in the fund of taxpayer money they won't
[03:01:12.420 --> 03:01:16.020]  even why not it's just criminal it's ruled by the gun
[03:01:16.020 --> 03:01:18.900]  john rabib or you've got the floor of the last four minutes where do you see
[03:01:18.900 --> 03:01:23.060]  all this going okay so first of all with this vaccine court
[03:01:23.060 --> 03:01:28.020]  the government compensation system people have to realize
[03:01:28.020 --> 03:01:33.300]  you can't sue the vaccine maker this was a deal that was cooked up in the
[03:01:33.300 --> 03:01:36.420]  1980s between the manufacturers of vaccines and the
[03:01:36.420 --> 03:01:40.340]  government u.s. government the makers came in and they said look we're getting
[03:01:40.340 --> 03:01:44.100]  out of the business because there are too many lawsuits
[03:01:44.100 --> 03:01:49.140]  we're losing too much money so if you want us to stay in the business
[03:01:49.140 --> 03:01:53.380]  you the federal government are going to have to create a system whereby
[03:01:53.380 --> 03:01:57.220]  you do it your way you compensate people who are destroyed
[03:01:57.220 --> 03:02:01.620]  killed kids brain damage whatever you handle it
[03:02:01.620 --> 03:02:05.620]  nobody sues us and the government said fine we'll do it
[03:02:05.620 --> 03:02:11.540]  so they set up this labyrinthine system where you have to crawl through it
[03:02:11.540 --> 03:02:15.140]  and defend yourself and prove this and that
[03:02:15.140 --> 03:02:20.420]  and it's all semantic word games it's like going into orals 1984
[03:02:20.420 --> 03:02:24.500]  to get compensation for the government because your child got vaccinated with
[03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:28.420]  the nmr vaccine and left the world like that
[03:02:28.420 --> 03:02:34.020]  and you have to prove that somehow an official disease or disorder was
[03:02:34.020 --> 03:02:37.780]  contracted through the vaccine when the mother was there
[03:02:37.780 --> 03:02:41.940]  she knew what happened that's what she's saying
[03:02:41.940 --> 03:02:45.460]  so this is insane punishment on top of punishment
[03:02:45.460 --> 03:02:49.300]  and where all this is going alex is into
[03:02:49.300 --> 03:02:53.540]  a popular revolution against the fraud of vaccines
[03:02:53.540 --> 03:02:57.060]  not just the fraud the danger the destruction
[03:02:57.060 --> 03:03:00.580]  between a hundred thousand and one point two million
[03:03:00.580 --> 03:03:05.060]  adverse reactions serious adverse or adverse reactions
[03:03:05.060 --> 03:03:11.700]  to vaccines every year in the u.s. that's what we're dealing with at minimum
[03:03:11.700 --> 03:03:14.900]  all that's being covered up by the government who says well
[03:03:14.900 --> 03:03:19.700]  all these vaccines are incredibly safe you rarely see an adverse effect
[03:03:19.700 --> 03:03:23.220]  that's total baloney they're lying through their teeth they're
[03:03:23.220 --> 03:03:27.620]  covering up primes for the vaccine makers who are
[03:03:27.620 --> 03:03:30.900]  behind the scenes laughing up their sleeves
[03:03:30.900 --> 03:03:34.340]  and the bigger the house of cards the harder it'll fall
[03:03:34.340 --> 03:03:37.380]  i see the house of cards on so many friends falling
[03:03:37.380 --> 03:03:41.860]  absolutely and this is one of the major ones no question about it
[03:03:41.860 --> 03:03:46.900]  the rebellion is in full force on this you can count on it and they've doubled
[03:03:46.900 --> 03:03:50.260]  down though with the flu they're like nurses stomping down the street
[03:03:50.260 --> 03:03:54.180]  and in businesses they'll go get your flu shot to random people not just me
[03:03:54.180 --> 03:03:57.780]  so now the cult is getting more aggressive they're shooting kids up at
[03:03:57.780 --> 03:04:01.940]  school without consent i mean they're doubling down no question
[03:04:01.940 --> 03:04:07.700]  and nurses are being fired from their jobs as they won't take the flu shot
[03:04:07.700 --> 03:04:11.140]  i get emails all the time yeah that's in the news that's in the news
[03:04:11.140 --> 03:04:15.220]  so so so there's a full on war going on right now no question about it and
[03:04:15.220 --> 03:04:19.220]  that's a good thing let's win it that's what i say well yeah because if they get
[03:04:19.220 --> 03:04:23.380]  found out on this it's over for them it's a domino the globalists have so many
[03:04:23.380 --> 03:04:27.540]  dominoes about to fall obama care is already fallen i don't think they can
[03:04:27.540 --> 03:04:30.500]  man i tell you this is an incredible time it is
[03:04:30.500 --> 03:04:33.940]  yeah and you're right these dominoes are all interconnected
[03:04:33.940 --> 03:04:38.260]  if that vaccine domino falls and it's going to fall there's gonna be a loud
[03:04:38.260 --> 03:04:42.100]  crash of a lot of other dominos count on it
