[00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:10.318]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.318 --> 00:00:11.899]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:13.441]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:17.643]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:21.686]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:31.137]  CBS News is reporting in St.
[00:00:31.137 --> 00:00:33.139]  Louis, Missouri, near Ferguson.
[00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:36.822]  The Department of Homeland Security has moved in.
[00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:39.665]  They, quote, broke that today.
[00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:47.072]  Actually, our reporters broke it yesterday via Infowars.com and on this syndicated radio broadcast.
[00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:49.074]  And Paul Watson has an article out on it.
[00:00:49.074 --> 00:00:52.598]  Navy vet labeled a terrorist, close quote.
[00:00:53.587 --> 00:01:01.530]  For posting images of DHS vehicles in Missouri, they went to the hotel, reworked, and had him fired.
[00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.312]  Boy, that sounds like some folks that want to live in a free country.
[00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:15.375]  Imagine being DHS, and someone shows that you're massing vehicles outside Ferguson, and then you go and get them fired.
[00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.516]  We're seeing more and more of this.
[00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:19.197]  What type of company would fire
[00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:26.915]  Someone that simply did citizen journalism and reported on this.
[00:01:26.915 --> 00:01:29.756]  This is the massive chilling effect that we're talking about.
[00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:33.116]  A government that is totally out of control.
[00:01:33.116 --> 00:01:37.238]  The verdict could come today, it could come tomorrow, it could come the next day, but they're saying it'll be this week.
[00:01:37.238 --> 00:01:43.439]  Our reporters, Jakari Jackson, and of course, Joe Biggs are on the ground.
[00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.040]  And to show you how political this is,
[00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:57.278]  Report, Homeland Security moves in, police nationwide braced for unrest, Obama quietly met with activists and said, stay on course.
[00:01:57.278 --> 00:02:01.659]  Demonstrators hold, die in.
[00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.560]  So this is a giant political distraction.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.940]  I'm reading from Drudge, the headlines here.
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.881]  Feds raid NFL.
[00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:12.182]  Suspicion, drugs illegally given to players on the field.
[00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:15.488]  Six teams targeted on Sunday.
[00:02:15.488 --> 00:02:16.229]  Bag search.
[00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:17.170]  Surprise!
[00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.491]  Doctors checked at airports.
[00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:22.395]  See, they're using Homeland Security selectively through the TSA.
[00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:23.095]  Harass folks.
[00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:24.457]  Not about terrorism.
[00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:26.178]  Of course they're on drugs.
[00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:29.682]  Of course there's manipulation going on.
[00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:32.364]  Of course Liam Armstrong was on steroids.
[00:02:32.364 --> 00:02:33.826]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:02:33.826 --> 00:02:35.727]  Most of the cops are on it.
[00:02:35.727 --> 00:02:36.688]  It's totally hypocritical.
[00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:37.409]  So why?
[00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.250]  Why is this important?
[00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:45.533]  Because the NFL's been backing off promoting anti-gun stuff and pushing Obamacare because of backlash.
[00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:51.176]  And the feds are letting them know, listen, you do what we say or we're going to blackmail you.
[00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:53.497]  We will ruin your life.
[00:02:53.497 --> 00:02:57.538]  You will do what we say, when we say.
[00:02:57.538 --> 00:02:59.739]  Back to the front!
[00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.720]  You will die when I say you must die!
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.881]  Back to the front!
[00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:05.442]  You coward!
[00:03:05.442 --> 00:03:06.762]  You servant!
[00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:07.703]  You blind man!
[00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:08.543]  Back to the front!
[00:03:09.534 --> 00:03:13.835]  To quote Metallica, back to the front.
[00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:17.116]  You will do what I say, when I say, back to the front.
[00:03:17.116 --> 00:03:22.098]  And just a nation of cowards groveling to this, and so we go into a new dark age of tyranny.
[00:03:22.098 --> 00:03:27.439]  It's just like the Bill Cosby stuff, 30-year-old allegations that have been disproven before.
[00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.100]  I don't know if he had never forced himself on a woman.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.961]  I just know that's the favorite thing now.
[00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:37.187]  Is for men and women to claim that someone who's prominent has sexually abused them.
[00:03:37.187 --> 00:03:45.699]  And when it's real and the person's part of the establishment, like Al Gore or DynCorp, actually getting caught shipping women and children out of...
[00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:50.463]  Central Europe and Eastern Europe to be taken to slave brothels in the Middle East.
[00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:51.563]  Nothing's done.
[00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:54.925]  Oh, but everybody can have consternation about Bill Cosby.
[00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:55.305]  You know why?
[00:03:55.305 --> 00:04:01.548]  Because he criticized Obamacare and Obama and open borders and told black folks to stop being in a gangbanger culture.
[00:04:01.548 --> 00:04:05.209]  He actually tried to lift black people up and that's why they're slapping him down.
[00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.330]  In fact, a few years ago he started bashing Obama.
[00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.311]  I said, get ready for them to drop the hammer on Bill Cosby.
[00:04:10.862 --> 00:04:13.543]  Because they want to send a message to everybody else.
[00:04:13.543 --> 00:04:17.524]  I've talked to a bunch of Hollywood stars that are pro-gun, anti-vaccine, you name it.
[00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:21.326]  Well, you saw the guy that criticized vaccines, the big comedian, a few months ago.
[00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:23.767]  They just fired him.
[00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:26.028]  Rob Schneider.
[00:04:26.028 --> 00:04:29.569]  This is how they... You wonder why people go along with the system?
[00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.129]  It's because they come after you.
[00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:32.450]  People say, why did they come after you, Alex?
[00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.671]  Oh, believe me, they have.
[00:04:34.671 --> 00:04:36.832]  But by the grace of God, we're going 110% into this fight.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.521]  And we've got Providence on our side, at least for now.
[00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:45.303]  But look, if I get destroyed tomorrow, that's God's will.
[00:04:45.303 --> 00:04:47.163]  I'm just not going along with this.
[00:04:47.163 --> 00:04:50.785]  But no weapon formed against us has prospered so far.
[00:04:50.785 --> 00:04:52.265]  Wise as a serpent.
[00:04:52.265 --> 00:04:54.286]  Peaceful as a dove.
[00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:54.927]  Walk softly.
[00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:56.507]  Carry a big stick.
[00:04:56.507 --> 00:04:56.967]  Stay with us.
[00:04:56.967 --> 00:04:57.608]  We'll be back.
[00:04:59.571 --> 00:05:00.912]  The experts are clear.
[00:05:00.912 --> 00:05:08.017]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:05:08.017 --> 00:05:14.301]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslime.com.
[00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:17.884]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:22.226]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:05:22.226 --> 00:05:27.548]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:05:27.548 --> 00:05:28.568]  Not our iodine.
[00:05:28.568 --> 00:05:32.369]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:34.910]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:05:59.724 --> 00:06:03.387]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:03.387 --> 00:06:07.670]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.451]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:09.451 --> 00:06:17.317]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:06:17.317 --> 00:06:18.458]  But for how long?
[00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:25.103]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:25.103 --> 00:06:27.905]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:29.438 --> 00:06:40.003]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:06:40.003 --> 00:06:46.447]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:48.788]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:58.753]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:06:59.173 --> 00:07:04.417]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:07:04.417 --> 00:07:10.743]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:07:10.743 --> 00:07:18.049]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:27.957]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[00:07:28.537 --> 00:07:34.701]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:37.783]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:07:37.783 --> 00:07:39.545]  And adenosylcobalamin.
[00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:43.147]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, lied on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:07:43.147 --> 00:07:45.028]  No needles, no injections.
[00:07:45.028 --> 00:07:46.689]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:47.890]  Try it for yourself.
[00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.192]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:15.627]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.094 --> 00:08:36.559]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Live Monday Worldwide Transmission.
[00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.402]  It is already the 17th day of November 2014.
[00:08:39.402 --> 00:08:43.505]  We'll be here, Lord willing, for the next three hours.
[00:08:43.505 --> 00:08:49.870]  We've got investigative journalist John Rappaport joining us to cover a host of issues in the third hour.
[00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:55.955]  But namely, he's been focusing in on all the German, Dutch, British, African, you name it
[00:08:56.969 --> 00:09:10.692]  Mainstream news articles and Catholic bishops and scientists going public, Indian scientists, Indian doctors, London Guardian, you name it, on the U.N.
[00:09:10.692 --> 00:09:16.094]  sterilization program that is admitted to be going on worldwide through the vaccines.
[00:09:16.094 --> 00:09:17.754]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:09:17.754 --> 00:09:18.494]  There are U.N.
[00:09:18.494 --> 00:09:21.175]  programs that they've caught them in the 80s, 90s and again in the 2000s.
[00:09:22.677 --> 00:09:32.200]  And now in the teens, 2014, catching them sterilizing women because the sterilization process sometimes kills them.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:39.222]  Through vaccines, but also they're taking them in and chopping their uteruses out.
[00:09:39.222 --> 00:09:40.102]  They're doing surgery.
[00:09:40.102 --> 00:09:41.723]  They're actually grabbing women off the street.
[00:09:42.944 --> 00:09:48.509]  And we're going to have a discussion about overpopulation in the third hour and go over some of the actuary numbers for folks.
[00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:55.136]  But even if you believe the world's overpopulated, certainly in some areas, you can say people are too concentrated, don't have enough resources.
[00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:59.279]  Is the answer then driving around shooting them up with sterilents?
[00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:01.161]  Because here's the newsflash.
[00:10:01.161 --> 00:10:04.905]  They're doing the same thing here, just not with sterilents that are 100%.
[00:10:06.323 --> 00:10:20.014]  They're doing it with soft kills so that it's not as obvious that mitigates, but they hit you from five or six angles with the fluoride that lowers fertility, with the estrogen mimickers that lowers fertility, and with all the other chemicals.
[00:10:20.014 --> 00:10:23.877]  The male sperm count last time I checked in the U.S.
[00:10:23.877 --> 00:10:25.859]  is down over 90%.
[00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:26.579]  Same thing in Europe.
[00:10:26.579 --> 00:10:29.402]  Just type in male sperm count down over 90%.
[00:10:29.402 --> 00:10:32.384]  You'll get mainstream BBC AP Reuters.
[00:10:32.384 --> 00:10:33.365]  What's going on?
[00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:34.666]  I mean, here's a Bloomberg headline.
[00:10:36.189 --> 00:10:42.431]  Alzheimer's test detects disease decades ahead of onset.
[00:10:42.431 --> 00:10:45.713]  Why don't we ask why the neurons are degenerating?
[00:10:45.713 --> 00:10:57.617]  Why don't we ask why neurological disorders on average in the West, get ready for this, and the numbers vary, are up between 3,000 and 10,000%.
[00:10:57.617 --> 00:10:59.218]  You heard me right.
[00:10:59.218 --> 00:11:01.219]  Look it up yourself.
[00:11:01.219 --> 00:11:02.839]  Why is diabetes up 3,000% in Hispanics?
[00:11:05.111 --> 00:11:10.054]  Up almost 1,000% in Caucasians, 2,000% in blacks.
[00:11:10.054 --> 00:11:11.475]  Why?
[00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:15.637]  Why is cancer of every type off the chart?
[00:11:15.637 --> 00:11:17.058]  New cancers everywhere.
[00:11:17.058 --> 00:11:22.161]  Pediatric cancer up on average over 10,000% Journal of Pediatrics.
[00:11:22.161 --> 00:11:25.363]  And by the way, if you're a radio listener, you can write down what I say.
[00:11:29.648 --> 00:11:32.309]  And then you can go and look it up, okay?
[00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:42.571]  In fact, just type in television Alzheimer's link, you'll get BBC, AP, Reuters admitting television more than two hours a day is linked to a doubling in Alzheimer's.
[00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:47.073]  Type in more than three flu shots and you double your chances of Alzheimer's.
[00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:48.013]  See, they're doing it.
[00:11:48.013 --> 00:11:51.674]  2001, TV linked to Alzheimer's, BBC.
[00:11:51.674 --> 00:11:56.435]  Understand, you can write down what I say and pull it up.
[00:11:58.148 --> 00:11:59.709]  This is not coming from me.
[00:11:59.709 --> 00:12:01.670]  You need to face what's going on.
[00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.891]  I need to face it.
[00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:05.433]  We need to deal with it.
[00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:12.378]  They want to make trillions now off putting people on the equivalent of statins for the brain.
[00:12:12.378 --> 00:12:17.321]  They're claiming, oh, we've got to put people on chemicals for life to stop the brain suddenly degenerating.
[00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:18.903]  It's pesticides in the food.
[00:12:18.903 --> 00:12:20.284]  It's GMO.
[00:12:20.284 --> 00:12:22.045]  It's estrogen mimickers.
[00:12:22.045 --> 00:12:23.166]  It's the chemicals.
[00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:24.927]  It's the microwave radiation.
[00:12:24.927 --> 00:12:27.308]  It's a cocktail that's killing us.
[00:12:28.328 --> 00:12:31.070]  Killing us.
[00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.232]  Killing us.
[00:12:33.232 --> 00:12:35.053]  And it's a serious issue.
[00:12:35.053 --> 00:12:40.016]  It makes smoking cigarettes and drinking whiskey look healthy.
[00:12:40.016 --> 00:12:42.258]  You ask, well, why is the government getting rid of cigarettes?
[00:12:42.258 --> 00:12:45.921]  Well, it was the government and Surgeon Generals that told folks cigarettes were good for you.
[00:12:45.921 --> 00:12:48.062]  And, you know, got a cold?
[00:12:48.062 --> 00:12:49.904]  Go buy a pack of Camels or Lucky Strikes.
[00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.692]  The Army handed out cigarettes so they were good for the troops.
[00:12:54.692 --> 00:12:57.614]  They knew it was giving people cancer 80 years ago, 90 years ago.
[00:12:57.614 --> 00:13:08.302]  They're moving on from that now to tax it and regulate it and control it and pose as if they're against cigarettes so they can then move on to everything else like fat and salt and the rest of it.
[00:13:08.302 --> 00:13:10.843]  It's not fat and salt that's the problem.
[00:13:10.843 --> 00:13:11.924]  It's the GMO.
[00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:12.965]  It's the chemicals.
[00:13:12.965 --> 00:13:14.326]  It's the glyphosates.
[00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:18.269]  We ate much more unhealthy diets 60, 70 years ago.
[00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:19.210]  Most people were skinny.
[00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.831]  They had a piece of pie at lunch and dinner.
[00:13:22.153 --> 00:13:29.370]  Drank 100% pure milk, smoked cigarettes, drank every night, shot around smoking cigars, playing cards.
[00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.632]  You'd have cancer at these rates.
[00:13:33.663 --> 00:13:34.883]  They say, oh, we're living longer.
[00:13:34.883 --> 00:13:35.423]  No, we're not.
[00:13:35.423 --> 00:13:35.723]  U.S.
[00:13:35.723 --> 00:13:37.664]  life expectancy has actually dropped.
[00:13:37.664 --> 00:13:52.387]  And if you average out infant mortality, it's true that until about 20 years ago, now our infant mortality is going back up because of the vaccines and things it's shown, that if you lived to age 10, then you tended to live to be about 85.
[00:13:52.387 --> 00:13:56.168]  There were a lot of 100-year-old people in the neighborhood.
[00:13:59.025 --> 00:14:11.570]  But if you look at it, then if you average out the fact that infant mortality went down starting in about the 30s until about the early 90s, it's still lower than it was back in the 20s, but it's gone back up some.
[00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.571]  Just pull up the graphs, infant mortality graph.
[00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:15.072]  Look at a 100-year U.S.
[00:14:15.072 --> 00:14:16.612]  infant mortality graph.
[00:14:16.612 --> 00:14:20.974]  You'll be on the Johns Hopkins website, is the top link, last time I checked.
[00:14:20.974 --> 00:14:24.235]  They'll show you what I'm saying.
[00:14:24.235 --> 00:14:28.337]  If you take out infant mortality, people are living about 10 years less.
[00:14:29.648 --> 00:14:32.951]  And Russia is the same thing, and Europe is the same thing.
[00:14:32.951 --> 00:14:42.039]  Even though we've cut back on the smoking, take all these drugs, what they have though is more advanced treatments to treat and keep you alive longer, sucking all your money out of you.
[00:14:42.039 --> 00:14:49.266]  Instead of you doing an endowment or building something or donating to a school, your money goes to medical care the last 20 years of your life.
[00:14:49.266 --> 00:14:54.111]  So they can also keep you alive as they kill you and then suck all the money out of you.
[00:14:54.631 --> 00:15:00.955]  And the average doctor's not aware of this, though more and more of them that I talk to are aware of it because of compartmentalization.
[00:15:00.955 --> 00:15:02.997]  So I kind of went off on a rant on that front.
[00:15:02.997 --> 00:15:06.199]  That's coming up in the third hour today.
[00:15:06.199 --> 00:15:10.922]  But why don't we get a test to find out why everybody's getting neurological disorders?
[00:15:10.922 --> 00:15:19.808]  Guillain-Barre, narcolepsy, massive increases in epilepsy, Alzheimer's-type spectrum diseases,
[00:15:22.125 --> 00:15:24.387]  Autism spectrum diseases.
[00:15:24.387 --> 00:15:27.269]  Why are they opening neurology clinics everywhere?
[00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:29.010]  Because we're being killed.
[00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.491]  We're being brain damaged.
[00:15:30.491 --> 00:15:31.752]  We're being assaulted.
[00:15:31.752 --> 00:15:34.834]  We're being murdered.
[00:15:34.834 --> 00:15:44.900]  Again, I don't want everywhere I go, race for the cure, give money, go to a restaurant, go to a, you name it, grocery store, anywhere.
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.522]  They push, give money for breast cancer, give money for breast cancer.
[00:15:47.522 --> 00:15:48.243]  Well, why aren't you?
[00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:58.455]  Well, if you had an organization out there trying to find out why everybody's getting it and trying to prevent it, if you had an anti-smoking campaign that was private, I'd give to that.
[00:15:58.455 --> 00:16:01.497]  If you had an anti-GMO campaign, I'd give to it, and I have.
[00:16:01.497 --> 00:16:04.438]  If you had a campaign to get glyphosate out of the water, I'd do it.
[00:16:04.438 --> 00:16:07.940]  If you had a campaign to get fluoride out of the water, I'd do it.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.682]  These are major things we can mitigate now.
[00:16:11.682 --> 00:16:18.346]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid or fluoride, Harvard study, you drink it as a child for five years, 10-point IQ reduction on average.
[00:16:19.926 --> 00:16:25.569]  You can have up to a 21 point reduction if you drink it from birth up and through life.
[00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:28.191]  Massive cancer, 7-fold increase in bone cancer.
[00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:28.811]  Don't believe me?
[00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:32.313]  Type in fluoride 7-fold increased bone cancer.
[00:16:32.313 --> 00:16:34.114]  You'll get Associated Press right now!
[00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:36.189]  That's not Alex Jones.
[00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:37.190]  That's admitted.
[00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.271]  They even tell you what they're doing.
[00:16:39.271 --> 00:16:40.972]  I want the fluoride out right now.
[00:16:40.972 --> 00:16:45.413]  I want to cease using glyphosates from the same folks that brought us Agent Orange.
[00:16:45.413 --> 00:16:52.676]  Glyphosate is basically liquid plant estrogen that does the same thing in humans.
[00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:55.658]  Men, do you like prostate cancer up massively?
[00:16:55.658 --> 00:16:57.418]  Women, do you like breast cancer?
[00:16:57.418 --> 00:17:03.161]  Because, you know, we know what the main accelerant is of hormone-based tissue cancers.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:11.024]  That's your ovaries, that's your uterus, that's your breast, that's your cervix, that's your vagina in women.
[00:17:11.024 --> 00:17:13.025]  In men, it's your breast.
[00:17:13.025 --> 00:17:14.605]  You've got breast tissue in there as well.
[00:17:14.605 --> 00:17:17.027]  Men are starting to get breast cancer.
[00:17:17.027 --> 00:17:20.629]  You've got the same basic system, which is a lot smaller than women.
[00:17:20.629 --> 00:17:24.431]  You don't have the milk-producing enzymes and things, but you've got some breast tissue.
[00:17:24.431 --> 00:17:25.591]  Men are getting breast cancer.
[00:17:25.591 --> 00:17:27.692]  Men are getting testicular cancer at record levels.
[00:17:27.692 --> 00:17:31.394]  Men are getting cancer of the prostate off the chart.
[00:17:31.394 --> 00:17:32.175]  Everybody knows that.
[00:17:34.099 --> 00:17:48.328]  I saw a number just a few weeks ago of a medical journal that in black men above the age of 55 in just a decade, a doubling, and they already had double the white rate of prostate cancer.
[00:17:48.328 --> 00:17:50.949]  Look it up!
[00:17:50.949 --> 00:17:54.992]  Black men are just, it's incredible.
[00:17:54.992 --> 00:17:55.752]  And you know why?
[00:17:55.752 --> 00:18:00.716]  Because you cross a bunch of estrogen with somebody with high testosterone and blacks have higher testosterone on average.
[00:18:00.716 --> 00:18:01.256]  Sign of effect.
[00:18:02.628 --> 00:18:04.289]  It's a death sentence.
[00:18:04.289 --> 00:18:06.310]  Why do blacks have such high blood pressure?
[00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:10.652]  Why do they have such high cancer rates?
[00:18:10.652 --> 00:18:12.452]  But everybody's going up.
[00:18:12.452 --> 00:18:15.234]  Don't worry, everybody's going to get to share in this.
[00:18:15.234 --> 00:18:19.916]  It's just that it's really hitting black people hard.
[00:18:19.916 --> 00:18:22.657]  Now, blacks aren't hit as hard by diabetes like Hispanics.
[00:18:22.657 --> 00:18:25.438]  Hispanics' genetic makeup cannot handle it.
[00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:28.219]  Cannot handle all this high fructose corn syrup.
[00:18:28.219 --> 00:18:30.060]  It's a death sentence.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.361]  Fluoride's a death sentence.
[00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:32.061]  Eat your pancreas.
[00:18:33.823 --> 00:18:38.426]  See, it hits everybody different ways, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:38.426 --> 00:18:41.729]  Whites are having higher levels of neurological disorders.
[00:18:41.729 --> 00:18:43.150]  Hits the brain harder.
[00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.711]  There are differences.
[00:18:45.711 --> 00:18:47.272]  It's just like a breed of dog.
[00:18:47.272 --> 00:18:52.076]  You know, this breed of dog can't handle this, that breed of dog can't handle that.
[00:18:52.076 --> 00:18:54.798]  They're all dogs at the end of the day.
[00:18:54.798 --> 00:18:56.799]  They can all breed.
[00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:58.060]  They're all basically the same.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.461]  They all got red blood, but they're different.
[00:19:00.964 --> 00:19:04.125]  But overall, we're all in the same boat together, getting killed.
[00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:08.707]  Now, when we come back, Dutch authorities identify a highly contagious bird flu strain.
[00:19:08.707 --> 00:19:13.269]  Surgeon who contracted Ebola virus in Sierra Leone dies at Nebraska Hospital.
[00:19:13.269 --> 00:19:19.391]  Microsoft hires Dalek-style robocops to guard Silicon Valley HQ.
[00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:23.993]  In Ferguson, tactics set for grand jury decision in the Michael Brown case.
[00:19:23.993 --> 00:19:26.354]  Obama quietly meets with him.
[00:19:26.354 --> 00:19:28.915]  Just stay the course, trying to hype things up.
[00:19:30.168 --> 00:19:34.690]  Navy vet labeled terrorists for posting images of DHS vehicles in Missouri.
[00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.231]  DHS visits his workplace, gets him fired.
[00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:38.812]  Shame on that place for doing that.
[00:19:38.812 --> 00:19:44.894]  Hacker Group Anonymous publishes names of Ferguson KKK members.
[00:19:44.894 --> 00:19:49.116]  Saudi Prince paid 9-11 pilots to fly Daily Mail.
[00:19:49.116 --> 00:19:55.018]  Chicago schools teaching anal sex to 5th graders confirmed.
[00:19:55.018 --> 00:19:57.439]  Why did Vladimir Putin leave the G20?
[00:19:57.439 --> 00:19:59.060]  And shock info on Obamacare.
[00:19:59.972 --> 00:20:02.094]  The human body is extraordinary.
[00:20:02.094 --> 00:20:06.299]  Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it, it still works hard to stay in balance.
[00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:11.605]  Thousands upon thousands of people rely upon hardened body extract to help their body stay balanced.

[00:20:59.208 --> 00:21:03.171]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[00:21:03.171 --> 00:21:08.695]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:21:08.695 --> 00:21:11.077]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:21:13.907 --> 00:21:18.193]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:20.295]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:21:20.295 --> 00:21:23.579]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:21:23.579 --> 00:21:24.821]  Children left with no homes.
[00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:26.663]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:21:26.663 --> 00:21:29.507]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:21:29.687 --> 00:21:30.667]  It's time to prepare!
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.881]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:22:00.881 --> 00:22:04.501]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:22:04.501 --> 00:22:05.862]  A pair of scissors.
[00:22:05.862 --> 00:22:11.663]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:16.584]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:22:16.584 --> 00:22:17.565]  The phone line.
[00:22:17.565 --> 00:22:22.826]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:22:22.826 --> 00:22:26.547]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:22:26.727 --> 00:22:30.051]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[00:22:30.051 --> 00:22:32.514]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[00:22:59.061 --> 00:23:00.062]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:23:00.062 --> 00:23:03.503]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:23:03.503 --> 00:23:05.184]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[00:23:05.184 --> 00:23:07.125]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:12.968]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:23:12.968 --> 00:23:13.808]  I know, right?
[00:23:13.808 --> 00:23:15.109]  You love it, too!
[00:23:15.109 --> 00:23:16.550]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:17.590]  Let's go get some!

[00:23:27.975 --> 00:23:30.695]  Are you ready to surrender your right to buy body armor?
[00:23:30.695 --> 00:23:31.456]  No joke.
[00:23:31.456 --> 00:23:34.156]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[00:23:34.156 --> 00:23:36.756]  And if House Bill H.R.
[00:23:36.756 --> 00:23:41.257]  5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.
[00:23:41.257 --> 00:23:44.058]  Don't put off your body armor purchase any longer.
[00:23:44.058 --> 00:23:46.558]  Go now to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:50.479]  Thousands of military veterans trust their lives to Infidel Body Armor.
[00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:51.599]  You should too.
[00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:54.560]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.000]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.140]  Just won't quit.
[00:24:05.675 --> 00:24:07.396]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:07.396 --> 00:24:07.956]  to 2 p.m.
[00:24:07.956 --> 00:24:10.118]  Central, we're here live.
[00:24:10.118 --> 00:24:13.219]  You're tuned in to the Monday edition.
[00:24:13.219 --> 00:24:23.265]  Coming up, in the middle of the next hour, we're going to talk to our reporters in Ferguson, Missouri, Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson, on what could be the eve of the announcement, as police departments across the U.S.
[00:24:23.265 --> 00:24:31.370]  brace for what they believe could be L.A.-style riots, if the hype on Facebook and Twitter and the rest of the Internet is accurate and can be believed.
[00:24:33.194 --> 00:24:34.235]  So that's coming up.
[00:24:34.235 --> 00:24:38.278]  I intend to open the phones up, as I did yesterday, and take a lot of phone calls.
[00:24:38.278 --> 00:24:40.939]  I think we did a great job yesterday taking about 20 phone calls.
[00:24:40.939 --> 00:24:47.544]  We're going to do that again today, but I'll give that number out at the start of the next segment.
[00:24:47.544 --> 00:25:01.574]  There is so much to break down, but first off, from Barack Obama's own words, shock flashback, Obama says illegal immigration hurts, blue-collar Americans strains welfare.
[00:25:03.012 --> 00:25:11.214]  Now, you need to understand, folks, it's the Republican rhino, blue-blood leadership that used to be bigger on open borders than even Democrats.
[00:25:11.214 --> 00:25:13.795]  Because Democrats had a lot of blue-collar workers across the U.S.
[00:25:13.795 --> 00:25:19.817]  I don't care if they were black, white, Hispanic, who understood that a bunch of people influxing would drive down their wages.
[00:25:19.817 --> 00:25:21.957]  Like Ross Perot said, a giant sucking sound.
[00:25:21.957 --> 00:25:23.818]  Well, how about you bring the giant sucking sound here?
[00:25:25.572 --> 00:25:29.795]  But the bigger issue is, can the president just by fiat, outside of law, do this?
[00:25:29.795 --> 00:25:31.056]  And the answer is no.
[00:25:31.056 --> 00:25:35.138]  It is impeachable, and even mainline Krauthammer has now said it.
[00:25:35.138 --> 00:25:43.944]  And that's big, because Rupert Murdoch has instructed News Corp folks, I've talked to News Corp insiders, I know a bunch of them, they've been told, back off Obama.
[00:25:43.944 --> 00:25:52.650]  They can attack him, they can mess with him for ratings, but don't actually try to bring him down, don't talk about impeachment, and don't criticize the Republican leadership.
[00:25:54.690 --> 00:26:00.914]  Well, to have Krauthammer come out last week, in fact, cue that up after this clip, is a big deal.
[00:26:00.914 --> 00:26:07.198]  Believe me, because Krauthammer is very respected and very, very smart.
[00:26:07.198 --> 00:26:12.782]  Huffington Post, Charles Krauthammer calls potential Obama immigration action an impeachable offense.
[00:26:12.782 --> 00:26:18.425]  No, it's not, it's not, you know, potential.
[00:26:18.425 --> 00:26:18.686]  It is.
[00:26:19.847 --> 00:26:21.089]  Obama is planning to do it.
[00:26:21.089 --> 00:26:22.431]  He's already done it by fiat.
[00:26:22.431 --> 00:26:23.653]  It is impeachable.
[00:26:23.653 --> 00:26:24.835]  It's beyond impeachable.
[00:26:24.835 --> 00:26:31.186]  You've got to impeach, as Krauthammer says, or you endorse lawless criminal executive branch.
[00:26:31.186 --> 00:26:32.067]  And Katie barred the door.
[00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:40.839]  Let's go ahead and play this clip from Obama's own mouth, from the book on tape, The Audacity of Total B.S.
[00:26:40.839 --> 00:26:42.702]  Excuse me, The Audacity of Hope.
[00:26:42.702 --> 00:26:43.143]  Here it is.
[00:26:43.143 --> 00:26:50.452]  There's no denying that many blacks share the same anxieties as many whites about the wave of illegal immigration flooding our southern border.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:58.186]  The number of immigrants added to the labor force every year is of a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century.
[00:26:58.186 --> 00:27:10.016]  If this huge influx of mostly low-skill workers provides some benefits to the economy as a whole, it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue-collar Americans and put strains on an already overburdened safety net.
[00:27:12.708 --> 00:27:25.317]  Let's play that clip one more time from the Lord and Savior who said he wouldn't come out with the guns, it would cut your health care costs in half, the power of a phone bill is 2 plus 2 does equal 4.
[00:27:25.317 --> 00:27:31.262]  Everything he said he went back on to a level never before seen by a politician in this country.
[00:27:31.262 --> 00:27:32.362]  Here it is.
[00:27:32.362 --> 00:27:39.668]  There's no denying that many blacks share the same anxieties as many whites about the wave of illegal immigration flooding our southern border.
[00:27:40.472 --> 00:27:47.414]  The number of immigrants added to the labor force every year is of a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century.
[00:27:47.414 --> 00:27:59.237]  If this huge influx of mostly low-skill workers provides some benefits to the economy as a whole, it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue-collar Americans and put strains on an already overburdened safety net.
[00:28:01.598 --> 00:28:06.220]  Well, I think Michael Schneider at Infowars.com says it well in his article.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.761]  Obamacare equals a death panel for the economy.
[00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:15.665]  Did you know that some Americans are being hit with health insurance rates increases of more than 500%?
[00:28:15.665 --> 00:28:17.506]  That's impeachable.
[00:28:17.506 --> 00:28:19.867]  And then meanwhile, Obama is set
[00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:31.518]  Sometime this week they're now saying to announce the blanket total amnesty and that any kid in the world can get amnesty status as a refugee.
[00:28:31.518 --> 00:28:33.100]  That means the government will pay for them.
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.041]  I mean, this will bring the country down.
[00:28:35.041 --> 00:28:45.049]  And by the way, the influx is about nine times the biggest numbers of immigrant influxes we saw in the 1890s through 1910 or so to the East Coast.
[00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:46.290]  And back then you didn't get welfare.
[00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.053]  These people worked like slaves and helped build this country.
[00:28:50.213 --> 00:28:59.657]  Look, I believe it is an impeachable offense.
[00:28:59.657 --> 00:29:17.743]  If the circumstances were different, if we were at the beginning of a presidency, if we hadn't had years when the Congress has been supine and unresponsive at other grabs of their authority by the executive, like Obama unilaterally changing Obamacare,
[00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:32.515]  After it was passed about 30 times, with no response from the Congress, the same as Obama essentially rewriting some of the drug laws, this idea of prosecutorial discretion is really a travesty.
[00:29:32.515 --> 00:29:35.878]  It is intended for... Alright, we're going to go to break, but I mean, there you go.
[00:29:35.878 --> 00:29:46.147]  If you don't do this, it'll set the precedent that the House, the Senate, and the legislative and the states as well, and the courts, the judicial, just are vestigial, ceremonial,
[00:29:47.047 --> 00:29:47.448]  Nothing.
[00:29:47.448 --> 00:29:48.889]  I mean, that's it.
[00:29:48.889 --> 00:29:50.290]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:51.871]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.871 --> 00:29:55.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.694 --> 00:30:09.358]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:30:09.358 --> 00:30:19.282]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy-Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:30:19.282 --> 00:30:22.203]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[00:30:22.403 --> 00:30:23.024]  I think so.
[00:30:37.538 --> 00:30:37.898]  We're good.
[00:31:00.097 --> 00:31:02.058]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:31:02.058 --> 00:31:06.600]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.063]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:31:11.063 --> 00:31:18.366]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:31:18.366 --> 00:31:27.451]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:27.671 --> 00:31:33.215]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[00:31:33.215 --> 00:31:40.800]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.382]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:31:43.382 --> 00:31:48.466]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the Info War.

[00:32:00.457 --> 00:32:07.123]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:32:07.123 --> 00:32:12.268]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:32:12.268 --> 00:32:14.250]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:32:16.314 --> 00:32:27.333]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:32:29.458 --> 00:32:41.267]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:32:41.267 --> 00:32:43.068]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:43.068 --> 00:32:45.950]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.013]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:32:50.013 --> 00:32:52.575]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:32:52.575 --> 00:32:55.276]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:32:55.276 --> 00:32:56.858]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:56.858 --> 00:32:57.658]  Got it.
[00:32:57.658 --> 00:32:58.138]  Others don't.
[00:33:01.323 --> 00:33:06.812]  You can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential...
[00:33:12.728 --> 00:33:13.568]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.568 --> 00:33:15.169]  Because there is a war on.
[00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.449]  For your mind.
[00:33:41.877 --> 00:33:44.519]  We've been conquered.
[00:33:44.519 --> 00:33:49.362]  We've been occupied like France by the Nazi Germans.
[00:33:49.362 --> 00:33:54.505]  And if we don't wake up and realize that, we have no hope.
[00:33:54.505 --> 00:34:09.134]  That's why they have the White House run, MSNBC, CNN, and Media Matters publicly run by the White House, demonizing yours truly, because they know the real power of this broadcast is not the 18, 20 million people we reach every week,
[00:34:10.606 --> 00:34:24.398]  The real power is that you reach people, and that the information we lay out here now is the talking points for the rest of talk radio and for Congress, to a great extent.
[00:34:24.398 --> 00:34:34.827]  And that scares them, just like DrudgeReport.com scares them, because Drudge can point at some bill or some obscure video and get a major debate going.
[00:34:34.827 --> 00:34:36.108]  That's what we're able to do.
[00:34:37.697 --> 00:34:38.497]  So many times.
[00:34:38.497 --> 00:34:40.478]  That's why this broadcast is so special.
[00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:42.479]  It's a great responsibility.
[00:34:42.479 --> 00:34:49.422]  I get excited when I see other alternative media becoming the dominant media, breaking big stories.
[00:34:49.422 --> 00:34:54.524]  I don't get mad and say, man, I wish we'd have broke that story the Daily Caller did.
[00:34:54.524 --> 00:34:57.966]  Or man, look at the attention World Net Daily's getting.
[00:34:57.966 --> 00:35:01.147]  Or man, look at the attention this local talk show host is getting.
[00:35:01.147 --> 00:35:02.208]  I get excited
[00:35:04.383 --> 00:35:06.104]  That people understand what's going on.
[00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:12.246]  I get excited that we're not one of the only organizations out there now that can do this.
[00:35:12.246 --> 00:35:16.228]  Because there's safety in numbers and it means we can win.
[00:35:16.228 --> 00:35:17.548]  I want the big win.
[00:35:17.548 --> 00:35:19.209]  I don't want to bankrupt the country.
[00:35:19.209 --> 00:35:20.810]  I don't want to collapse.
[00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.090]  I want a future for my children just like you do.
[00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:24.411]  I want prosperity.
[00:35:24.411 --> 00:35:26.532]  I want justice.
[00:35:26.532 --> 00:35:29.333]  I don't want to go quietly into that long night with the New World Order.
[00:35:31.052 --> 00:35:38.457]  I mean, look at Jerry Brown preparing to run for president, Breitbart's reporting, and his meeting with donors this week.
[00:35:38.457 --> 00:35:40.558]  Talk about nightmarish.
[00:35:40.558 --> 00:35:44.380]  Back in 92, he ran with Jesse Jackson.
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.083]  You can put that article up on screen.
[00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:53.426]  I mean, that is just simply, simply amazing that that is going on.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:55.760]  And you know what?
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:09.230]  If he's able to get, by the breach in California, another 30, 40, 50 million illegals in and get them all voting cards, and California gets up to 60, 70 million people, California will decide the election.
[00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:13.993]  Because you only get 100 million people or so ending up voting in presidential elections.
[00:36:13.993 --> 00:36:16.455]  California's 37 million right now, or whatever it is.
[00:36:16.455 --> 00:36:21.298]  It's set to be like 50 million in a couple of years, because it's the North American Union.
[00:36:23.305 --> 00:36:26.019]  The globalists are collapsing us into this greater union.
[00:36:29.793 --> 00:36:34.256]  And Obama says he's ready, with executive action, to move forward.
[00:36:34.256 --> 00:36:41.000]  Executive order on immigration would ignite a political firestorm, but Obama says he's going to go ahead with it.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.982]  Now he lies so much, that tells me he may not do an executive order.
[00:36:43.982 --> 00:36:45.203]  May back off.
[00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:50.486]  They call it a victory, but already since January, the border's totally wide open.
[00:36:50.486 --> 00:36:57.030]  The Border Patrol loads the illegals on Greyhound buses and others, and gives them a federal voucher to go anywhere they want in the country.
[00:36:59.358 --> 00:37:00.599]  Anywhere.
[00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:02.700]  You want to go to upstate New York from Texas?
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.380]  You can.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.741]  You want to go from California to Maine?
[00:37:04.741 --> 00:37:05.101]  You can.
[00:37:05.101 --> 00:37:07.702]  You want to go from California to the Keys of Florida?
[00:37:07.702 --> 00:37:08.382]  You can.
[00:37:08.382 --> 00:37:10.843]  You want to go from California to Minnesota?
[00:37:10.843 --> 00:37:13.445]  You can.
[00:37:13.445 --> 00:37:15.346]  This is unbelievable.
[00:37:15.346 --> 00:37:18.107]  The Border Patrol has gone on Fox Television.
[00:37:19.457 --> 00:37:23.618]  And said, we complete the smuggling process, exactly what we said from our sources.
[00:37:23.618 --> 00:37:37.181]  We showed you the video from McAllen with the emergency manager going, yes, the Border Patrol loads them, gives them vouchers, and then lets them go in, kids with their families, under any name they want.
[00:37:37.181 --> 00:37:39.962]  Biometric scans are not even taken.
[00:37:39.962 --> 00:37:42.203]  When you get a driver's license, biometrics are taken.
[00:37:42.203 --> 00:37:46.104]  They said it was for the illegals back in the 90s when Clinton got it put in nationwide.
[00:37:46.104 --> 00:37:47.364]  And I told you it wasn't, folks.
[00:37:48.513 --> 00:37:50.714]  They just let people in and they can be whoever you want.
[00:37:50.714 --> 00:37:52.255]  You want five identities?
[00:37:52.255 --> 00:37:54.356]  You want to pull five different welfare rolls?
[00:37:54.356 --> 00:37:57.998]  Go ahead.
[00:37:57.998 --> 00:38:05.522]  When police pull illegals over now, on record, they don't even give them tickets because they can't.
[00:38:05.522 --> 00:38:08.503]  No ID, no nothing, above the law, not complying.
[00:38:08.503 --> 00:38:15.147]  We though comply with every form of government abuse, every form of government rape, every form of government shellacking.
[00:38:18.399 --> 00:38:21.381]  And so, we are the right whale.
[00:38:21.381 --> 00:38:30.466]  And again, the right whale was a slow, sweet, fat whale that was almost extincted by the 1960s when hunting it was banned.
[00:38:30.466 --> 00:38:33.588]  There was like three dozen left or something.
[00:38:33.588 --> 00:38:37.290]  One of the most plentiful whales in the ocean.
[00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:45.855]  There are three species of large baleen whales of the genus the North Atlantic whale, the North Pacific right whale, and the Southern right whale.
[00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:52.512]  They're classified in the family of the baleen of the bowhead whale.
[00:38:52.512 --> 00:39:00.676]  Right whales have round bodies, V-shaped blowholes, and dark gray and black skin.
[00:39:00.676 --> 00:39:06.238]  Their most distinguishing feature is the right whale is the rough patches of skin on the head.
[00:39:07.452 --> 00:39:10.133]  If you guys read deeper why they call it the... there it is.
[00:39:10.133 --> 00:39:31.279]  Right whales were the preferred target for whalers because their docile nature, their slow surface skimming feeding behaviors, their tendencies to stay close to the coast, and their high blubber content which makes them float when they are killed and which produces high yields of whale oil.
[00:39:31.279 --> 00:39:36.421]  Today the North Atlantic and North Pacific right whales are among the most endangered whales in the world.
[00:39:40.054 --> 00:39:51.321]  And America, and the average American, is known as the Schmuck Whale, the Joke Whale, the Chump Male, the Mark Whale, the Target Whale.
[00:39:51.321 --> 00:39:53.662]  We are known as the joke of the planet.
[00:39:53.662 --> 00:39:58.325]  We are known as the idiots of the world, as I've told you, and as Gruber tells you.
[00:39:58.325 --> 00:39:59.766]  Ha, you stupid Americans!
[00:39:59.766 --> 00:40:01.687]  Well, who are you working for?
[00:40:01.687 --> 00:40:05.490]  We can rip you off and keep it secret, and you're so dumb!
[00:40:08.251 --> 00:40:11.213]  Yeah, I met with Obama, and he said, I can't afford to run this through it.
[00:40:11.213 --> 00:40:12.793]  How are we going to hide this?
[00:40:12.793 --> 00:40:18.096]  And I came up with a plan on how to deceive everybody.
[00:40:18.096 --> 00:40:18.696]  And you know what?
[00:40:18.696 --> 00:40:19.997]  You are the right whale.
[00:40:19.997 --> 00:40:23.379]  Not our general audience, but our new listeners.
[00:40:23.379 --> 00:40:27.321]  I'll sit here and tell you, man, you need to wake up.
[00:40:27.321 --> 00:40:35.205]  I just played Obama, that Jamie Foxx calls Lord and Savior, saying that open borders would wreck the country and bankrupt us.
[00:40:35.205 --> 00:40:36.666]  He better believe that was the plan, Jack.
[00:40:39.952 --> 00:40:41.973]  You know what Jamie Foxx does?
[00:40:41.973 --> 00:40:43.333]  He's not stupid.
[00:40:43.333 --> 00:40:44.714]  He's made over 100 million dollars.
[00:40:44.714 --> 00:40:48.795]  He sits back and knows he's chumping everybody.
[00:40:48.795 --> 00:40:55.476]  He knows he's gaming everybody.
[00:40:55.476 --> 00:40:57.237]  From Texas.
[00:41:09.653 --> 00:41:11.753]  He's up from where I'm from.
[00:41:11.753 --> 00:41:13.314]  I think he's a good actor.
[00:41:13.314 --> 00:41:24.196]  But every time I watch him now, I have to turn the television off or leave the movie because this is a guy like Zuckerberg who knows that his viewers and his fans are dumb appers.
[00:41:24.196 --> 00:41:26.837]  That's another quote.
[00:41:26.837 --> 00:41:29.817]  And it's just real funny.
[00:41:29.817 --> 00:41:31.198]  I've been around high-level Democrats.
[00:41:31.198 --> 00:41:32.678]  They know it's a chump game.
[00:41:34.482 --> 00:41:50.446]  They know their job is to go out there and tell everybody that it's cool to be a slave, but Bill Cosby comes out and says Obamacare's bad, Obama's bad, being a black gangbanger's bad, that black leaders want to keep blacks down, and basically pimp them, which is the game that Margaret Sanger came up with.
[00:41:50.446 --> 00:41:52.066]  And boy, you notice they're going after him now.
[00:41:52.066 --> 00:41:55.287]  Doesn't matter if there's no evidence, they're going to get him.
[00:41:55.287 --> 00:41:58.748]  They're going to get him, they're going to teach him good.
[00:41:58.748 --> 00:42:01.629]  You understand that?
[00:42:01.629 --> 00:42:03.409]  Until we wake up to it.
[00:42:05.632 --> 00:42:08.774]  Until we understand what's happening.
[00:42:08.774 --> 00:42:16.278]  I want to get more into Obamacare, more into super bird flu, more on Putin, four kills and chemical leak at LA.
[00:42:18.311 --> 00:42:21.353]  La Porte plant, I said La Porte, I saw L.A., L.A.
[00:42:21.353 --> 00:42:25.316]  La Porte plant in Texas, KTRK reports.
[00:42:25.316 --> 00:42:28.177]  Well, the answer is ban chemical plants if anyone ever got hurt.
[00:42:28.177 --> 00:42:37.704]  No, the answer is that's just part of life and we've got a lot safer plants than we used to in this country and we're an industrial society, but I'm sad for those that died.
[00:42:37.704 --> 00:42:42.487]  My point is if four people got shot, it'd be the top news story, end of the world, ban all the guns.
[00:42:44.048 --> 00:42:56.921]  Even though guns frustrate crime 70-something times, the numbers vary from 44 to 100 and something, but on average 70 plus times guns stop crime for when they're used in a crime.
[00:42:56.921 --> 00:43:08.312]  In fact, criminals pretty much just sneak in houses that are vacant now or people aren't home and steal stuff out of your car if it's not locked because everywhere with gun proliferation
[00:43:10.566 --> 00:43:16.270]  I mean, it's Russian Roulette robbing somebody or conquering some lady on the head, because a lot of women don't listen to Gloria Steinem now.
[00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:21.655]  A lot of women go out and buy guns and go out and get training, and you try to rape them or rob them, they're going to light you up.
[00:43:21.655 --> 00:43:29.240]  Light you up like Christmas!
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:38.628]  I just love seeing the culture of liberty proliferate as they try to force this tyranny in, and they saw the awakening happening in the last decade, so they came in hard with Obama to be their closer.
[00:43:39.983 --> 00:43:44.407]  And now he's looking at it and sees everybody waking up and he's just planning all these executive orders.
[00:43:44.407 --> 00:43:51.292]  And he thinks his Republican buddies over there, Boehner and McConnell, will be able to protect him from political backlash.
[00:43:51.292 --> 00:43:52.193]  Go ahead.
[00:43:52.193 --> 00:43:55.015]  Make my day, punk.
[00:43:55.015 --> 00:43:57.997]  Go ahead.
[00:43:57.997 --> 00:44:03.562]  Because it takes you guys acting like the tyrants you are nakedly to get the American people up off their patoots.
[00:44:04.744 --> 00:44:07.365]  I want to open the phones up in the next segment right through the next hour.
[00:44:07.365 --> 00:44:09.346]  Our reporters are joining us from Ferguson.
[00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:12.047]  That's just some of the news that's coming up today.
[00:44:12.047 --> 00:44:17.649]  Chicago schools teaching safe anal sex to fifth graders.
[00:44:17.649 --> 00:44:18.629]  Oh my goodness.
[00:44:18.629 --> 00:44:22.731]  I didn't know there was a safe form of that.
[00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:23.971]  Unbelievable.
[00:44:23.971 --> 00:44:26.272]  It's like the Affordable Care Act ain't affordable.
[00:44:26.272 --> 00:44:28.053]  Or the Patriot Act's the opposite of being a patriot.
[00:44:29.175 --> 00:44:32.317]  Or they tell you, go ahead and wear a condom, and then you're gonna be safe.
[00:44:32.317 --> 00:44:35.219]  You know how often condoms burst?
[00:44:35.219 --> 00:44:40.922]  You know how often people put condoms on wrong?
[00:44:40.922 --> 00:44:48.546]  And then there's nothing safe about that type of sex.
[00:44:48.546 --> 00:44:50.147]  My goodness.
[00:44:50.147 --> 00:44:51.188]  But they put the word on it!
[00:44:53.325 --> 00:44:54.867]  Like Affordable Care Act!
[00:44:54.867 --> 00:44:55.708]  Or the DREAM Act!
[00:44:55.708 --> 00:44:57.550]  We want kids to dream!
[00:44:57.550 --> 00:45:02.937]  Oh my goodness, our future is a country run by somebody like Jerry Brown.
[00:45:02.937 --> 00:45:04.739]  Totally sickening.
[00:45:04.739 --> 00:45:05.740]  If we don't turn this around.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.362]  There's an article up on Infowars.com.
[00:45:10.367 --> 00:45:12.968]  Very important article.
[00:45:12.968 --> 00:45:17.569]  Study links depression, anxiety, and lethargy to vitamin B12 deficiency.
[00:45:17.569 --> 00:45:22.371]  Vitamin B12, not SSRIs, brought suicidal woman back to stable mental state.
[00:45:22.371 --> 00:45:26.892]  A suicidal 52 year old woman suffering from severe depression, anxiety, lethargy, and
[00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:36.529]  Katatonia, I guess is the word, did not vastly improve until doctors diagnosed her with a vitamin B12 deficiency, which normally they don't do a blood test.
[00:45:36.529 --> 00:45:38.130]  Now doctors are going, you know what?
[00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:40.711]  I'm not going to listen to the pharmaceutical company or Obamacare guidelines.
[00:45:40.711 --> 00:45:43.812]  We're going to do a blood test.
[00:45:43.812 --> 00:45:48.795]  According to a little known study, a woman who also suffered from
[00:45:51.633 --> 00:46:01.958]  Disturbances such as hearing, her name called out, was teetering and was treated with antipsychotic and antidepressant medications for months with little effect.
[00:46:01.958 --> 00:46:06.299]  But once doctors began treating her with B12, she reverted to a stable mental state.
[00:46:06.299 --> 00:46:07.920]  She hadn't experienced for 14 years.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:14.503]  And then it goes through the study and we have links to it in the article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:46:20.293 --> 00:46:24.838]  A lot of the B12 available on store shelves consist of the former two types.
[00:46:24.838 --> 00:46:31.005]  We break it down, state of the combination of the latter two.
[00:46:31.005 --> 00:46:36.511]  Anyways, going over the study, it's linked up on Infowars.com.
[00:46:36.511 --> 00:46:40.675]  We have sold out, basically, of Secret 12.
[00:46:43.095 --> 00:46:46.919]  But it looks like we're going to get the next shipment in.
[00:46:46.919 --> 00:46:48.801]  It's basically complete now.
[00:46:48.801 --> 00:46:50.082]  It's being labeled.
[00:46:50.082 --> 00:46:55.607]  And then they have to test one more time, though it's been tested twice, that batch.
[00:46:55.607 --> 00:46:58.149]  And then it will be shipped out probably Friday.
[00:46:58.149 --> 00:47:01.753]  It'll probably be here next Tuesday.
[00:47:01.753 --> 00:47:04.415]  So I'm not going to take it down.
[00:47:04.415 --> 00:47:08.059]  We're going to say that, expect that it will ship within two weeks, though.
[00:47:09.551 --> 00:47:16.594]  It'll probably ship next week, but what's coming in is only half of what we already sold.
[00:47:16.594 --> 00:47:19.115]  So we have enough to cover the orders now.
[00:47:19.115 --> 00:47:29.859]  I just went and checked during the last break, but if we can go a couple more days at this rate and then we'll be completely sold out, unfortunately, for 2014 of Secret 12, this proprietary form.
[00:47:34.426 --> 00:47:36.768]  of two different types of organic vitamin B12.
[00:47:36.768 --> 00:47:41.191]  Eighty percent of it is the methylcobalamin, that is the type that you inject.
[00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:49.337]  And from the research we've done, it has much higher absorption rates than other even organic sublingual vitamin B12 compounds.
[00:47:49.337 --> 00:47:59.304]  And I mix it in with water every day, three times a day, a couple squirts of my Supramel Vitality, my Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine,
[00:48:00.584 --> 00:48:12.108]  And sometimes with colloidal silver, I do that a few times a week just to bolster because it's the season for all the super-resistant bacteria and viruses and the rest of it, so that's what I'm personally doing.
[00:48:12.108 --> 00:48:14.969]  We've been sold out of Silver Bullet for six weeks.
[00:48:14.969 --> 00:48:22.332]  Silver Bullet, our proprietary, what we believe is the best colloidal silver nano-sized particles out there and very affordable as well.
[00:48:23.792 --> 00:48:28.115]  We private label out of the biggest manufacturer in the country that supplies Whole Foods and others.
[00:48:28.115 --> 00:48:32.937]  They sell it for about $10 more than what we sell, the exact same bottle labeled Silver Bullet.
[00:48:32.937 --> 00:48:36.039]  And we are going to have some of that in.
[00:48:36.039 --> 00:48:42.603]  In fact, some already came in, but I'm not going to start selling it until there's enough in to at least have it for a week or so.
[00:48:42.603 --> 00:48:50.567]  So we are going to sell out of Secret 12, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:48:50.567 --> 00:48:53.209]  And the win-win is you're getting a really high quality nutraceutical.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:59.902]  But you're also funding this operation so I can send Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs for a week up to Ferguson to cover it.
[00:48:59.902 --> 00:49:06.464]  So I can send reporters to Copenhagen to cover Bilderberg, or to London, or to Greece, or to Switzerland, or to Virginia.
[00:49:06.464 --> 00:49:08.624]  So I can send reporters to the border.
[00:49:08.624 --> 00:49:16.867]  And if you continue to fund us and buy the high quality products, the water filters, the t-shirts, the books and videos, I'm going to hire three or four more reporters, and I'm going to hire three or four more writers.
[00:49:18.257 --> 00:49:26.681]  And then just because I can't handle the management and also trying to accelerate and make the money, I think we're going to try to stop growing at that point.
[00:49:26.681 --> 00:49:42.188]  And then move in later to maybe having reporters that are part-time in 10 locations or something around the country that we can activate and pay to, you know, but have guidelines and train them.
[00:49:43.277 --> 00:49:44.798]  And VETM and everything.
[00:49:44.798 --> 00:49:47.059]  There's a lot of mainstream reporters that are out of jobs or whatever.
[00:49:47.059 --> 00:49:49.821]  We might hire some of them as well, but we like grassroots folks.
[00:49:49.821 --> 00:49:55.464]  So we can have people on the ground within an hour or two of any location in this country.
[00:49:55.464 --> 00:49:57.946]  And they'll be pitching us ideas every day to be activated.
[00:49:57.946 --> 00:49:59.166]  I mean, I've got a lot of ideas.
[00:49:59.166 --> 00:50:01.108]  I've got to launch the show on cable and TV.
[00:50:01.108 --> 00:50:06.150]  This is already dominating on the internet, the nightly news, but it is your funding.
[00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.911]  Field of Dreams.
[00:50:06.911 --> 00:50:07.531]  We build it.
[00:50:07.531 --> 00:50:08.412]  You come to the stadium.
[00:50:09.693 --> 00:50:17.576]  But it's not a stadium, because you come, you're in the fight, you're in the info war, you're funding the rocket fuel in the missile that we're firing at the Globalist.
[00:50:17.576 --> 00:50:19.056]  I mean, you're there.
[00:50:19.056 --> 00:50:28.139]  And I commit to you to go in 110% against the enemy, to not be cowardly, to tell the truth, the whole truth, but the truth, so help me God, and to commit.
[00:50:28.139 --> 00:50:36.822]  I commit that you've backed us, you've believed in us, and I'm going to get in the gladiatorial arena and I'm going to 110% focus on taking the enemy out politically.
[00:50:37.282 --> 00:50:40.866]  I am going to savagely attack them with every ounce of truth, energy I've got.
[00:50:40.866 --> 00:50:41.747]  I'm not going to back down.
[00:50:41.747 --> 00:50:43.388]  I'm not going to submit.
[00:50:43.388 --> 00:50:45.410]  I'm going to just go in through and beyond.
[00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:47.873]  I'm going to run them over.
[00:50:47.873 --> 00:50:50.575]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:50:50.575 --> 00:50:53.518]  I'm going to give the number out.
[00:50:53.518 --> 00:50:55.500]  When we come back, we'll start taking calls next hour.
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:55.841]  Stay with us.

[00:51:30.422 --> 00:51:32.223]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:51:32.223 --> 00:51:33.883]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:51:33.883 --> 00:51:36.704]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:51:36.704 --> 00:51:39.004]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:51:39.004 --> 00:51:43.505]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:51:43.505 --> 00:51:47.446]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[00:51:47.446 --> 00:51:51.227]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.

[00:51:51.647 --> 00:51:52.968]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:51:59.585 --> 00:52:04.949]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[00:52:04.949 --> 00:52:08.812]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[00:52:08.812 --> 00:52:13.976]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[00:52:13.976 --> 00:52:15.878]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[00:52:15.878 --> 00:52:19.341]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[00:52:19.341 --> 00:52:22.203]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[00:52:22.883 --> 00:52:28.866]  After consuming one world away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[00:52:28.866 --> 00:52:35.889]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[00:52:35.889 --> 00:52:38.250]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:42.771]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[00:52:42.771 --> 00:52:43.712]  Wow!
[00:52:43.712 --> 00:52:44.072]  Call 888-988-3325.

[00:52:46.352 --> 00:52:46.792]  W-H-E-Y.com.
[00:52:58.223 --> 00:53:03.526]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[00:53:03.526 --> 00:53:10.469]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.
[00:53:10.469 --> 00:53:17.953]  If this sounds familiar, call us now, because we're shipping free bottles of Super Beta Prostate to listeners of this station.

[00:53:27.958 --> 00:53:29.519]  Just call 1-800-852-1820.
[00:53:29.519 --> 00:53:42.128]  In clinical trials, the ingredient in Super Beta Prostate was shown to reduce urges to urinate, improve bladder emptying, reduce waking at night to urinate, and improve quality of life.
[00:53:42.128 --> 00:53:46.330]  This Super Beta Prostate free offer is for listeners of this station.
[00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:47.771]  But it won't last.
[00:53:47.771 --> 00:53:48.712]  Don't wait.
[00:53:48.712 --> 00:53:49.192]  Just call 1-800-852-1820.
[00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:49.472]  That's 1-800-852-1820.
[00:53:49.472 --> 00:53:49.633]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[00:54:12.208 --> 00:54:15.050]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:20.214]  The toll free number to discuss any of these issues we've thrown out today, I'd love to hear from all of you, is 800-259-9231.
[00:54:20.214 --> 00:54:20.534]  800-259-9231.
[00:54:20.534 --> 00:54:21.395]  All I ask is you have a good telephone.
[00:54:21.395 --> 00:54:24.717]  I took about 20 calls yesterday, so I'm getting good at going to calls.
[00:54:35.273 --> 00:54:40.077]  After 20 years, I was actually good at it day one, but got bad at it over time.
[00:54:40.077 --> 00:54:41.559]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[00:54:41.559 --> 00:54:45.342]  We will go to your phone calls.
[00:54:45.342 --> 00:54:50.066]  Pat Sajak says, Gruber demonstrates leftist elitism.
[00:54:50.066 --> 00:54:54.850]  Gruber said what politicians think about the American people.
[00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:59.854]  Gruber has shined a light on the disdain many self-proclaimed champions of the little people
[00:55:00.714 --> 00:55:01.754]  That's the left.
[00:55:01.754 --> 00:55:03.355]  Have for those people.
[00:55:03.355 --> 00:55:03.935]  He tweeted that.
[00:55:03.935 --> 00:55:07.696]  We're going to tweet back at him saying he's absolutely right.
[00:55:07.696 --> 00:55:08.997]  School teaches kids.
[00:55:08.997 --> 00:55:10.237]  The government gives us rights.
[00:55:10.237 --> 00:55:11.938]  We're going to get into that article.
[00:55:11.938 --> 00:55:18.820]  A Navy vet labeled a terrorist for posting images of DHS vehicles in Missouri loses his job.
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:23.782]  Georgia National Guard buys riot gear as Brown verdict looms.
[00:55:23.782 --> 00:55:27.203]  Study links depression, anxiety, lethargy, and vitamin B12 deficiency.
[00:55:28.973 --> 00:55:33.659]  Ron Paul, internet gambling ban, a losing bet for the rest of us.
[00:55:33.659 --> 00:55:34.961]  Yeah, government just wants to run it.
[00:55:34.961 --> 00:55:37.584]  If you want to be an idiot and gamble, that's your problem.
[00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:42.951]  Obama met with Ferguson activists, said he's concerned they stay on course.
[00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:50.453]  And we've got a report that all hell's gonna break loose in Ferguson with gun sales crippling up 300%.
[00:55:50.453 --> 00:55:52.474]  That's all up on Infowars.com.
[00:55:52.474 --> 00:55:55.415]  I also want to talk with listeners about the flashback.
[00:55:55.415 --> 00:56:05.980]  Obama, in his own book, in his own audiobook, saying open borders and all these illegals hurt America, hurt jobs, and hurt the social safety net weighing down the country till it collapses.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:07.881]  I want your take on that as well.
[00:56:07.881 --> 00:56:07.921]  800-259-9231.
[00:56:13.407 --> 00:56:17.070]  But this Navy vet that got fired for daring to show all the DHS vehicles massing.
[00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:19.792]  See, a citizen being a journalist is illegal in America.
[00:56:19.792 --> 00:56:20.853]  That's the big enemy.
[00:56:20.853 --> 00:56:25.496]  Because if you ever start doing that and become your own intelligence network, we don't need the system anymore.
[00:56:25.496 --> 00:56:29.539]  And then they can't lie to us about the real Obama cases, Ebola cases.
[00:56:29.539 --> 00:56:33.422]  They can't cover all this stuff up.
[00:56:33.422 --> 00:56:39.948]  So that's just some of the news that we're going to be breaking down on that front.
[00:56:39.948 --> 00:56:41.429]  I also want to
[00:56:44.301 --> 00:56:45.382]  Get into the economy.
[00:56:45.382 --> 00:56:47.302]  What's happening with Russia?
[00:56:47.302 --> 00:56:52.385]  Saudi Prince paid for 9-11 pilots to learn to fly.
[00:56:52.385 --> 00:56:55.146]  That's in the Daily Mail.
[00:56:55.146 --> 00:56:57.487]  That is just some of what we're going to be breaking down.
[00:56:57.487 --> 00:56:58.688]  Bloomberg reports U.S.
[00:56:58.688 --> 00:57:02.229]  Navy deploys first laser weapon in the Persian Gulf.
[00:57:02.229 --> 00:57:07.352]  They've deployed on a command ship of the Persian Gulf the first ever laser weapon capable of destroying
[00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:20.354]  A target, the amphibious transport ship, the USS Pounce, has been patrolling with a prototype 30 kilowatt class laser weapon system since late August, according to officials.
[00:57:20.354 --> 00:57:33.939]  The laser is mounted facing the bow and can be fired in several modes, from dazzling warning flashes to a destructive beam, and can set a drone or small boat on fire.
[00:57:33.939 --> 00:57:36.000]  Now, we've shown video of that before.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:36.620]  Pretty interesting.
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:42.343]  Since 2011, the Navy has boosted its presence in the Persian Gulf.
[00:57:42.343 --> 00:57:44.044]  Then it gets into testing the weapon.
[00:57:44.044 --> 00:57:49.729]  All extremely interesting, obviously, and that's Tinker Toys.
[00:57:51.809 --> 00:57:53.910]  Compared to what they're really facing.
[00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:59.453]  Islamic State, the globalist-run CIA front, is now threatening to kill Lebanese soldiers.
[00:57:59.453 --> 00:58:00.613]  And they're expanding their attack.
[00:58:00.613 --> 00:58:10.278]  It's now being reported there are at least 200,000 IS soldiers, which I told you a long time ago because that's the number of Al-Qaeda operatives that are in the so-called Syrian Liberation Army.
[00:58:10.278 --> 00:58:13.140]  That's over 90% Al-Qaeda.
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:17.062]  So all just an attempt to divert and distract the public.
[00:58:17.842 --> 00:58:20.983]  That is coming up in the second hour as well.
[00:58:20.983 --> 00:58:26.904]  The phone lines are loaded, but when you hear someone hang up, that's your chance to call 800-259-9231.
[00:58:26.904 --> 00:58:30.125]  An hour of calls.
[00:58:30.125 --> 00:58:35.826]  Our reporters will also join us from Ferguson briefly as they file special reports live on the ground.
[00:58:35.826 --> 00:58:36.926]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:36.926 --> 00:58:41.407]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.358 --> 00:58:45.542]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:49.611 --> 00:58:50.871]  Another major health threat.
[00:58:50.871 --> 00:58:55.853]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:58:55.853 --> 00:58:58.514]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:58:58.514 --> 00:59:05.556]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:05.556 --> 00:59:08.577]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:08.577 --> 00:59:11.578]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:11.578 --> 00:59:13.518]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:13.518 --> 00:59:16.359]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:16.459 --> 00:59:22.182]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:22.182 --> 00:59:25.684]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:25.684 --> 00:59:28.765]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:36.089]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:59:46.195 --> 00:59:47.417]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:06.711]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.711 --> 01:00:08.473]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.473 --> 01:00:10.235]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.235 --> 01:00:11.817]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:13.358]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.358 --> 01:00:17.562]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.562 --> 01:00:21.627]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.814 --> 01:00:38.496]  Coming up, the Feds raid the NFL.
[01:00:38.496 --> 01:00:40.577]  Why do I think they're doing that?
[01:00:40.577 --> 01:00:44.040]  Obama says that open borders are strange.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.062]  The country hurts blue-collar Americans, hurts the welfare system.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.863]  That's all coming up as he prepares to become a true dictator with all these executive orders.
[01:00:52.863 --> 01:00:55.165]  But I want to take a lot of your phone calls in this hour.
[01:00:55.165 --> 01:00:58.407]  Head of investigative journalist John Rappaport joining us.
[01:00:58.407 --> 01:01:02.390]  Dan, Kevin, Mike, Dion, Brad, we're going to all of you.
[01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:04.851]  And again, when you hear somebody hang up, that's your cue to call in.
[01:01:04.851 --> 01:01:06.432]  I'm taking a lot of calls.
[01:01:06.432 --> 01:01:09.314]  Dan in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:01:09.314 --> 01:01:10.475]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[01:01:10.475 --> 01:01:13.457]  This is Bible Dan with the Bible in his hand.
[01:01:13.457 --> 01:01:13.817]  All right.
[01:01:13.817 --> 01:01:16.299]  I got two talking points here.
[01:01:16.299 --> 01:01:17.340]  One is the border.
[01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:25.204]  Well, the Lord is going to make sure... He's the only one we can count on to keep those borders closed.
[01:01:25.204 --> 01:01:27.445]  We cannot count on man.
[01:01:27.445 --> 01:01:31.487]  Man will not save us, only Yeshua.
[01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:35.929]  My second talking point is, you've got a problem with Revelations.
[01:01:35.929 --> 01:01:46.034]  It says, Revelations 3.10, it says, I will keep you from the hour of the trial that dwells on
[01:01:47.256 --> 01:01:52.397]  Are you saying that you believe in a pre-tribulation rapture?
[01:02:15.302 --> 01:02:16.022]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:16.022 --> 01:02:23.806]  Alright, listen, I gotta jump, because I said, you know, we're getting into like 20 topics I threw out, and I guarantee you I don't think one of these callers will be on one of those topics.
[01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:24.386]  And that's fine.
[01:02:24.386 --> 01:02:26.027]  That's the weird thing we do on the show.
[01:02:26.027 --> 01:02:27.187]  Sometimes it's crazy, sometimes it's not.
[01:02:27.187 --> 01:02:31.629]  I'm not mad at you, but I'm not having a theological debate right now.
[01:02:31.629 --> 01:02:34.830]  It says the beast will wage war on the saints and overcome them.
[01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:37.912]  How'd that happen when they're all teleported out of here?
[01:02:37.912 --> 01:02:38.712]  What happened to Jesus?
[01:02:38.712 --> 01:02:39.732]  What happened to his disciples?
[01:02:39.732 --> 01:02:40.673]  Did they get raptured?
[01:02:42.227 --> 01:02:44.208]  What happened to Christians in Nazi Germany?
[01:02:44.208 --> 01:02:46.370]  Or in the Soviet Union?
[01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:49.532]  God helps those that help themselves.
[01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:52.714]  You take action and God gives you providence.
[01:02:52.714 --> 01:02:56.757]  George Washington didn't just sit there and pray that God would come destroy the Redcoats.
[01:02:56.757 --> 01:03:00.740]  He prayed that God would guide his hand defeating them.
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:04.943]  Trust in God, but tie up your camel is the old Bedouin saying, and I agree with it.
[01:03:04.943 --> 01:03:08.986]  Hunter S. Thompson said, trust in God, but roll away from the rocks.
[01:03:10.257 --> 01:03:11.598]  And we could control our border.
[01:03:11.598 --> 01:03:14.139]  We could prosecute people that hire illegals.
[01:03:14.139 --> 01:03:15.779]  We could not give them all free welfare.
[01:03:15.779 --> 01:03:16.760]  And they wouldn't be here.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.980]  They incentivize it.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.681]  And that's what goes on in these big mega-churches.
[01:03:19.681 --> 01:03:21.802]  That's all that goes on.
[01:03:21.802 --> 01:03:22.642]  It's a lay-down.
[01:03:22.642 --> 01:03:23.482]  Don't get involved.
[01:03:23.482 --> 01:03:24.243]  Do what you're told.
[01:03:24.243 --> 01:03:26.704]  It's a government doctrine of failure.
[01:03:26.704 --> 01:03:28.444]  And I'm not mad at you, sir.
[01:03:28.444 --> 01:03:29.965]  And I understand we should trust in God.
[01:03:29.965 --> 01:03:30.685]  I do trust in God.
[01:03:30.685 --> 01:03:32.746]  That's why I'm not in fear.
[01:03:32.746 --> 01:03:37.408]  But I'm just always hearing from so-called Christians, hey, Yahweh is going to take care of it.
[01:03:38.971 --> 01:03:40.492]  But I still got to put my shoes on in the morning.
[01:03:40.492 --> 01:03:41.753]  I still got to take care of my kids.
[01:03:41.753 --> 01:03:44.035]  I got to tell my kids don't run out in the street.
[01:03:44.035 --> 01:03:45.756]  They were little.
[01:03:45.756 --> 01:03:46.696]  No, I'm not going to tell them, dude.
[01:03:46.696 --> 01:03:51.320]  I'm just going to... Or if somebody speeds down my street, I'm not going to say something to them because God will handle it.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.261]  No, I'm going to say something to them.
[01:03:53.261 --> 01:04:04.129]  If I'm at the gas station 20 minutes later and see the guy that went 80 miles an hour down my street, I'm going to say, listen, I'm not looking for trouble, buddy, but you're going to run over somebody's kid going down the street like that.
[01:04:04.129 --> 01:04:07.131]  And if they blow up, want to physically attack me, I'm going to beat that... I'm going to defeat them.
[01:04:07.824 --> 01:04:08.744]  Because they're going to kill somebody.
[01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:10.185]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[01:04:10.185 --> 01:04:15.727]  But, you know, you see somebody driving 80 miles an hour down the street, you've got to go tell them, don't do it!
[01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:21.970]  Remember, I used to drive down the street maybe 35, 40 miles an hour.
[01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:26.492]  And I'd see neighbors getting mad and stuff and, you know, see them say, hey, slow down!
[01:04:26.492 --> 01:04:33.294]  And I kind of would slow down going, oh, I guess they're right, but still wasn't being reckless.
[01:04:33.294 --> 01:04:36.376]  But man, now I see people going down residential areas like 80 miles an hour.
[01:04:37.398 --> 01:04:39.019]  I want to, you know, I get really angry.
[01:04:39.019 --> 01:04:39.979]  That's dangerous, folks.
[01:04:39.979 --> 01:04:40.840]  You're going to kill somebody.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.720]  All I'm going to do is just pray to God.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.982]  Yeah, I pray to God my kids are safe every day when they drive, when people drive them around.
[01:04:46.982 --> 01:04:50.284]  The number one cause of death for kids is automobile accidents.
[01:04:50.284 --> 01:04:53.965]  But at the same time, I tell the nanny or whatever, I want you to drive extra safe.
[01:04:53.965 --> 01:04:56.926]  You know, the person I hire to be a nanny has got to have a perfect driving record.
[01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.227]  You understand that?
[01:04:59.525 --> 01:05:10.069]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:16.531]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:05:16.531 --> 01:05:18.872]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:05:18.872 --> 01:05:21.973]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[01:05:21.973 --> 01:05:28.836]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:05:29.276 --> 01:05:32.939]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:32.939 --> 01:05:37.222]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:37.222 --> 01:05:39.003]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:39.003 --> 01:05:46.868]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:46.868 --> 01:05:48.009]  But for how long?
[01:05:48.009 --> 01:05:50.231]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:05:50.231 --> 01:05:54.654]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:05:54.654 --> 01:05:57.456]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:06:00.075 --> 01:06:01.437]  In the near future.
[01:06:01.437 --> 01:06:05.923]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:06:05.923 --> 01:06:07.145]  Security alert.
[01:06:07.145 --> 01:06:09.168]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:09.168 --> 01:06:12.873]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operation.
[01:06:12.873 --> 01:06:15.457]  We let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[01:06:15.677 --> 01:06:17.738]  We are the ones responsible.
[01:06:17.738 --> 01:06:18.759]  Prime Directive.
[01:06:18.759 --> 01:06:20.280]  Take credit, Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.162]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:23.162 --> 01:06:26.404]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:26.404 --> 01:06:28.705]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:28.705 --> 01:06:30.246]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:06:30.246 --> 01:06:33.068]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:33.068 --> 01:06:35.029]  They are never going to stop.
[01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:39.052]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:06:42.674 --> 01:06:53.485]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out!
[01:06:53.485 --> 01:06:55.827]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it!
[01:06:58.499 --> 01:07:04.925]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[01:07:04.925 --> 01:07:05.926]  It has changed my life.
[01:07:05.926 --> 01:07:09.629]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now, pounding the weights, staying in shape.
[01:07:09.629 --> 01:07:12.152]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:07:12.152 --> 01:07:13.613]  You've heard the callers to the show.
[01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:17.617]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:19.598]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[01:07:19.598 --> 01:07:22.261]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:07:22.381 --> 01:07:40.295]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shields, Oxy Powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:40.295 --> 01:07:45.879]  Dash 2, just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.
[01:07:45.879 --> 01:07:46.640]  It's great stuff.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.741]  I'm going to promote something.
[01:07:47.741 --> 01:07:50.722]  It's got to be something I personally use and that I believe in.
[01:07:50.722 --> 01:08:01.849]  Check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[01:08:01.849 --> 01:08:04.631]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.631 --> 01:08:07.433]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:29.412 --> 01:08:36.836]  There's a couple of examples out today of celebrities doing something good with their power.
[01:08:36.836 --> 01:08:50.945]  Neil Young has come out and said that because Starbucks has joined a lawsuit against the state of Vermont and their new law saying that GMO products have to be labeled, well you know how much sugar's in them, you know how much
[01:08:52.358 --> 01:08:53.458]  Fats in them.
[01:08:53.458 --> 01:08:56.959]  Of course you should know if a genetically modified organism is in there.
[01:08:56.959 --> 01:09:00.660]  Like BT corn that kills the honeybees that come in contact with it.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:05.602]  It's designed to kill bugs so that the crops don't get eaten, but it also hurts you.
[01:09:05.602 --> 01:09:12.824]  He says, I used to line up and get my latte every day, but yesterday was my last one, the rocker announced.
[01:09:12.824 --> 01:09:17.345]  And then separately, that story's up on Infowars.com, via Rolling Stone,
[01:09:18.971 --> 01:09:36.867]  We now have Pat Sajak coming out saying that Gruber comments about how Americans are dumb and how they deceived them illustrates the elitism of the left and said that's what the politicians really think of the American people in a tweet.
[01:09:36.867 --> 01:09:38.668]  Good job, Pat Sajak.
[01:09:38.668 --> 01:09:42.232]  And of course, look for Neil Young to get harassed now.
[01:09:42.232 --> 01:09:44.574]  Look for Pat Sajak to get harassed, just like
[01:09:46.837 --> 01:09:48.177]  Bill Cosby.
[01:09:48.177 --> 01:09:53.059]  Now, did Bill Cosby, in his long career as a superstar, ever force himself on a woman?
[01:09:53.059 --> 01:09:53.319]  Maybe.
[01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:57.441]  But he doesn't fit that M.O.
[01:09:57.441 --> 01:10:06.664]  But a woman 30 years ago, and then after that, other women, claim, 30 years later, that he raped them.
[01:10:06.664 --> 01:10:09.825]  And you'd think it was the end of the world right now.
[01:10:09.825 --> 01:10:14.427]  For the former Jell-O sponsor.
[01:10:14.427 --> 01:10:14.967]  I know this.
[01:10:17.318 --> 01:10:22.161]  This is politically motivated, clearly, to punish him for criticizing Obamacare and Obama.
[01:10:22.161 --> 01:10:26.763]  In the last few years, I've said, look out, Bill Cosby, because I've seen this over and over again.
[01:10:26.763 --> 01:10:28.964]  They come after you.
[01:10:28.964 --> 01:10:30.985]  They fire you.
[01:10:30.985 --> 01:10:36.148]  They restrict you, just like the comedian a month ago who criticized vaccines and autism.
[01:10:36.148 --> 01:10:41.551]  They dropped him from his insurance sponsoring.
[01:10:41.551 --> 01:10:42.892]  State Farm, Rob Schneider.
[01:10:47.475 --> 01:10:50.456]  So, that's what I think's going on here.
[01:10:50.456 --> 01:10:53.738]  And we have to learn to support people who get targeted.
[01:10:53.738 --> 01:10:55.439]  I'm going to your calls, but I want to tie it into this.
[01:10:55.439 --> 01:10:57.720]  We're going to talk to our reporters on the ground coming up.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:04.005]  Navy vet labeled a terrorist for posting images of DHS vehicles in Missouri.
[01:11:04.005 --> 01:11:11.773]  Hotel staffer asked if vehicles were linked to impending Ferguson arrest and so DHS went and got him fired from his job.
[01:11:11.773 --> 01:11:20.883]  Well somebody needs to contact them and get him rehired or said hire this Navy vet who's now been fired for simply being a citizen asking questions and putting it out on their Facebook.
[01:11:21.676 --> 01:11:28.241]  See, our reporters get targeted, so does Vice of HBO, so does Al Jazeera, by the police.
[01:11:28.241 --> 01:11:38.788]  You'll see the commanders ordering the troops, as they call them, the militarized police, to shoot us with rubber bullets, when we are there, 200 yards away, covering it.
[01:11:38.788 --> 01:11:41.310]  They won't go after looters, they'll go after folks with Molotov cocktails.
[01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:47.352]  They go after the press because they're being trained because the government wants information dominance.
[01:11:47.352 --> 01:11:49.513]  Well, that's not what you do in a free society.
[01:11:49.513 --> 01:11:54.534]  That's why Obama has persecuted the press like no one else in history.
[01:11:54.534 --> 01:12:03.716]  Even the left admits nobody's going after the press and indicted and arrested people for reporting on corruption like Barack Hussein Obama.
[01:12:06.286 --> 01:12:10.667]  Also coming up, school teaches kids that the government gives us our rights.
[01:12:10.667 --> 01:12:13.767]  That's a Paul Joseph Watson article on InfoWars.com.
[01:12:13.767 --> 01:12:25.029]  And study links, depression, anxiety, and lethargy, the vitamin B12 deficiency, that report's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:12:25.029 --> 01:12:28.190]  I covered that last hour, important information.
[01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:32.671]  Meanwhile, Chicago schools teaching safe anal sex to fifth graders.
[01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:41.177]  Presentation includes instructions on applying condoms prior to anal sex.
[01:12:41.177 --> 01:12:45.179]  Maybe they'll teach him about sex with someone's ear.
[01:12:45.179 --> 01:12:48.660]  I mean, you know, why not?
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:49.441]  Same-sex marriage?
[01:12:49.441 --> 01:12:51.722]  Well, how about... Alright, I'm just going to leave it right there.
[01:12:52.984 --> 01:12:54.786]  That's not what school's about, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:54.786 --> 01:12:59.891]  That shouldn't be going on with seniors, much less with fifth graders.
[01:12:59.891 --> 01:13:01.332]  Outrageous.
[01:13:01.332 --> 01:13:04.956]  Kevin, Luke, Dion, Brad, Rhonda, I'm going to your calls.
[01:13:04.956 --> 01:13:05.937]  Bang, bang, bang.
[01:13:05.937 --> 01:13:06.938]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[01:13:06.938 --> 01:13:07.939]  You want to talk about Gruber.
[01:13:07.939 --> 01:13:09.860]  Go ahead.
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:15.306]  I was wondering how Gruber sleeps at night and was wondering how we
[01:13:15.996 --> 01:13:18.997]  Well, I appreciate that question.
[01:13:18.997 --> 01:13:21.637]  It's an excellent question.
[01:13:21.637 --> 01:13:25.218]  I'll put you on hold while I answer it and then go back to you, Kevin.
[01:13:37.708 --> 01:14:01.719]  The way this should work is they call Gruber, they call Ezekiel Emanuel, they call all the people that shot their mouths off about how it's death panels, how it's meant to wreck health care, how it's a screw job, how it's meant to kill old people, how it's meant to bankrupt the country, how they lied about what it cost, how they lied about the tax, and you grill them so it becomes a media spectacle and you get their crimes out in the open.
[01:14:01.719 --> 01:14:04.660]  Then you indict Obama in the House of Representatives
[01:14:06.345 --> 01:14:10.367]  You indict him, and then you have the trial in the Senate.
[01:14:10.367 --> 01:14:13.508]  And the thought is, well, that makes him a victim and might boost his poll numbers.
[01:14:13.508 --> 01:14:14.049]  No.
[01:14:14.049 --> 01:14:15.649]  Not when it's this egregious.
[01:14:15.649 --> 01:14:19.811]  Not when everybody's being hit with the premium increases in Obamacare.
[01:14:19.811 --> 01:14:22.493]  The Democrats are screaming for vengeance.
[01:14:22.493 --> 01:14:25.674]  And then, you impeach Obama.
[01:14:25.674 --> 01:14:26.815]  There'll be a landslide.
[01:14:26.815 --> 01:14:31.977]  Boehner will be removed from the House as the Speaker.
[01:14:31.977 --> 01:14:33.598]  The leader of the Senate will be removed.
[01:14:35.263 --> 01:14:37.964]  Not from office, but we'll be removed from leadership.
[01:14:37.964 --> 01:14:41.627]  In that landslide, we'll give cover to all those politically that are being blackmailed or attacked.
[01:14:41.627 --> 01:14:44.389]  We could rout the entire group.
[01:14:44.389 --> 01:14:52.114]  Then you've got to put heat on the next power group not to be bought off of the same interest, letting them know they'll be politically destroyed and that we're done playing games.
[01:14:52.114 --> 01:14:55.857]  But that's what an awake electorate would do.
[01:14:55.857 --> 01:14:58.579]  That's what you would do if you wanted to reverse the course of the country.
[01:14:59.591 --> 01:15:06.777]  Instead, they'll repeal a few parts of Obamacare, keep the screwjob rolling into the future, and then bring all these other screwjobs in, because why not?
[01:15:06.777 --> 01:15:07.857]  They got away with this.
[01:15:07.857 --> 01:15:09.819]  Why not amnesty?
[01:15:09.819 --> 01:15:12.901]  Why not everything else?
[01:15:12.901 --> 01:15:14.162]  Why not a North American Union?
[01:15:14.162 --> 01:15:17.385]  Because if we'll put up with that, the sky's the limit.
[01:15:17.385 --> 01:15:21.708]  You can also have class action lawsuits that draw attention to things.
[01:15:21.708 --> 01:15:29.194]  All of us being hit with premium increases, or being kicked off our insurance, or having our identities stolen by the networks that they set up.
[01:15:31.345 --> 01:15:43.637]  The data mining of the Democratic Party, the fraud of the website, a bunch of lawsuits can be filed on that front and have accelerated timetables because people are being currently hurt who don't have health care.
[01:15:43.637 --> 01:15:44.517]  And that's another way.
[01:15:44.517 --> 01:15:53.566]  And then you could have grand juries off those civil lawsuits, use those as roadmaps to indict the state and federal level for fraud and racketeering.
[01:15:55.382 --> 01:15:59.003]  And then people like Gruber will be indicted.
[01:15:59.003 --> 01:16:00.904]  $400,000 as a professor.
[01:16:00.904 --> 01:16:02.825]  He gets his professor's money.
[01:16:02.825 --> 01:16:13.188]  That's his one government contract, to go work with Obama in being the expert name to doll the thing up and put his name on an economic report to shove it through Congress.
[01:16:13.188 --> 01:16:16.690]  Oh look, MIT says this won't increase prices.
[01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:17.950]  We screwed everybody!
[01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:19.971]  That's how arrogant they think they are.
[01:16:19.971 --> 01:16:22.452]  They've pulled off the heist of the century.
[01:16:22.452 --> 01:16:22.972]  They're saying
[01:16:24.105 --> 01:16:28.509]  Obamacare will cost trillions of dollars over the next 10 years to taxpayers.
[01:16:28.509 --> 01:16:29.710]  Death panels.
[01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:30.690]  Total screw job.
[01:16:30.690 --> 01:16:35.815]  And he's laughing about how he robbed Fort Knox, basically, in my opinion.
[01:16:35.815 --> 01:16:36.255]  And you know what?
[01:16:36.255 --> 01:16:38.357]  He made it away with it.
[01:16:38.357 --> 01:16:40.979]  Remember, folks, we're turning veterans into gun owners.
[01:16:40.979 --> 01:16:44.842]  And Christians are called terrorists in official Homeland Security training.
[01:16:44.842 --> 01:16:46.644]  They go to months of training every few years.
[01:16:47.478 --> 01:16:51.779]  To see clips of me played, Ron Paul demonized, Rand Paul demonized.
[01:16:51.779 --> 01:17:03.142]  I mean, they call in FBI, ATF, federal marshals, state police are sent to this, local cops are... And it's so over the top as they badmouth the George Washington stuff that it's waking the people up.
[01:17:03.142 --> 01:17:08.724]  Even their people are going, I'm actually in a meeting with an image of George Washington on the screen.
[01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:11.005]  We've been sent these PowerPoints.
[01:17:11.005 --> 01:17:11.825]  We've shown folks.
[01:17:14.113 --> 01:17:16.054]  And they just get up there and badmouth George Washington.
[01:17:16.054 --> 01:17:17.374]  I mean, these people are traitors!
[01:17:17.374 --> 01:17:19.414]  These people are nuts!
[01:17:19.414 --> 01:17:23.195]  They say 2 plus 2 equals 5!
[01:17:23.195 --> 01:17:24.616]  Kevin, any other points on that?
[01:17:24.616 --> 01:17:30.857]  I just would like to know how Gruber sleeps at night knowing that, you know, he conned everything.
[01:17:30.857 --> 01:17:35.339]  And how would he feel if we, as the American public, turned around and conned him?
[01:17:35.339 --> 01:17:37.559]  You know, I mean, think about it.
[01:17:37.559 --> 01:17:40.260]  If we did what he did, you know,
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:49.484]  For sure that we would be indicted or would be in some type of trouble for the, you know, for the stunt that he pulled.
[01:17:49.484 --> 01:17:59.189]  And the other thing I was wondering, too, is it possible to maybe make a sign and go to a legal and lawful area and say, hey, these people are nothing but criminals?
[01:17:59.189 --> 01:18:00.869]  Well, you can't do that anywhere in Dallas.
[01:18:00.869 --> 01:18:04.631]  They say no signs are allowed in your hand anywhere because the First Amendment is nothing but
[01:18:06.559 --> 01:18:11.900]  Birdcage liner, but I still do it in Dallas myself routinely just because they passed that illegal law.
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.660]  I appreciate your call.
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:18.081]  Yeah, no, I think everybody should be going to Gruber's alma mater.
[01:18:18.081 --> 01:18:20.522]  Professors like him only teach a few weeks out of the year.
[01:18:20.522 --> 01:18:30.103]  Find out Gruber's schedule and then obviously everyone should go into the class or afterwards and confront him about, you know, being a big fat liar.
[01:18:30.103 --> 01:18:31.164]  Let's do one more call.
[01:18:31.164 --> 01:18:32.504]  Dion in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:18:35.905 --> 01:18:37.066]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:18:37.066 --> 01:18:41.268]  Good!
[01:18:41.268 --> 01:18:45.891]  My question is, do you think Mexico is the next Kiev?
[01:18:45.891 --> 01:19:02.661]  They have the missing 43 students that were murdered by the cartel, and they have protesters seizing government offices, and then November 20 there's going to be a general strike, a national general strike, and do you think that will have economic impact in the market?
[01:19:04.502 --> 01:19:11.808]  Well, I think you're absolutely right that there is a strike coming up very, very soon in Mexico.
[01:19:11.808 --> 01:19:15.671]  The government basically is the cartels.
[01:19:15.671 --> 01:19:23.137]  That's why they've torched police stations and taken over a state capital, because the young people know they're being fed on by a bunch of armed thugs.
[01:19:23.137 --> 01:19:26.259]  If the young people could be armed, this wouldn't happen.
[01:19:26.259 --> 01:19:29.202]  But you see, the government-run cartels are the only ones that are allowed to be armed.
[01:19:32.123 --> 01:19:36.245]  And the government split between the Marines and the Army.
[01:19:36.245 --> 01:19:38.346]  Our government claims the Marines are less corrupt.
[01:19:38.346 --> 01:19:40.487]  I've seen evidence that's the case.
[01:19:40.487 --> 01:19:43.509]  That's why the Marines control all the tourist areas.
[01:19:43.509 --> 01:19:45.750]  Mexico is basically collapsing.
[01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:47.431]  I think your question is an excellent one.
[01:19:47.431 --> 01:19:49.312]  What do you think?
[01:19:49.312 --> 01:19:55.735]  Yeah, I think it will be the next Kiev and I think it will affect the commodities from Mexico.
[01:19:55.735 --> 01:19:56.636]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:19:56.636 --> 01:19:57.456]  This is a smart call.
[01:19:57.456 --> 01:19:58.677]  I want to hear more of what you have to say.

[01:21:58.615 --> 01:22:03.918]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[01:22:03.918 --> 01:22:10.862]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.

[01:22:58.448 --> 01:23:00.369]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:23:00.369 --> 01:23:03.990]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:05.350]  A pair of scissors.
[01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:11.152]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:16.054]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:23:16.054 --> 01:23:16.834]  The phone line.
[01:23:17.054 --> 01:23:22.302]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:23:22.302 --> 01:23:26.207]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:23:26.207 --> 01:23:29.532]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[01:24:08.015 --> 01:24:14.758]  I asked the question, Alex Jones here back live, yesterday on the Sunday edition of the show.
[01:24:14.758 --> 01:24:15.999]  When will we hit rock bottom?
[01:24:15.999 --> 01:24:19.161]  How much will we put up with?
[01:24:19.161 --> 01:24:24.483]  From Obamacare, and them publicly laughing at us, and the foreign banks looting the country.
[01:24:24.483 --> 01:24:27.065]  Well look at Mexico, where's the bottom there?
[01:24:27.065 --> 01:24:37.130]  Whole cities collapsing, government just machine gunning innocent people, kids disappearing, women being raped and murdered, mass graves being found almost every day, full of hundreds of people.
[01:24:38.055 --> 01:24:43.619]  Now it's 100,000 dead they know of, with hundreds of thousands missing in the last eight years.
[01:24:43.619 --> 01:24:46.462]  I mean, it is just a collapse of tyranny.
[01:24:46.462 --> 01:24:51.045]  General strike on November 20th for missing students.
[01:24:51.045 --> 01:24:52.887]  And now they've done stuff like take over state capitals.
[01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:57.070]  They say they're going to seize the 20th, the International Airport in Mexico City.
[01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:59.012]  I mean, Mexico is going to be wild.
[01:24:59.012 --> 01:25:01.374]  I'm thinking about sending a reporter down there.
[01:25:02.495 --> 01:25:03.975]  Yeah, my other point about this is that
[01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:42.195]  Like in Argentina in the 1980s, they would target lawyers, protesters, anything that was a threat to the establishment, they would kidnap them and have them disappear.
[01:25:42.195 --> 01:25:55.581]  So they're doing the same tactics in Mexico as student protesters in the U. And I think if there is a collapse, it's going to affect the food commodities and we're going to see higher food prices in the food.
[01:25:55.581 --> 01:25:58.363]  Oh yeah, well already California drought and the rest of it too.
[01:26:02.455 --> 01:26:05.359]  What else do you think is going to happen?
[01:26:05.359 --> 01:26:13.290]  Well, I think there's going to be an increase in migration to Texas because of what will happen if it does collapse.
[01:26:13.290 --> 01:26:16.734]  And do you think they should be considered political refugees?
[01:26:19.226 --> 01:26:20.708]  Well, that's what's being prepared.
[01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:22.991]  See, they know Mexico's collapsing.
[01:26:22.991 --> 01:26:30.901]  And so, yes, they're preparing to basically merge our countries under the guise of helping Mexico, but that's only designed to collapse our country as well.
[01:26:30.901 --> 01:26:36.248]  As Obama admittedly said in his own book and his own book on tape,
[01:26:36.829 --> 01:26:39.232]  The audacity of destroying America, excuse me.
[01:26:39.232 --> 01:26:41.135]  The audacity of hope.
[01:26:41.135 --> 01:26:41.796]  Here's that clip.
[01:26:49.997 --> 01:26:56.922]  The number of immigrants added to the labor force every year is of a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century.
[01:26:56.922 --> 01:27:11.313]  If this huge influx of mostly low-skill workers provides some benefits to the economy as a whole, it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue-collar Americans and put strains on an already overburdened safety net.
[01:27:11.313 --> 01:27:13.995]  Absolutely right.
[01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:14.976]  Barack Obama.
[01:27:14.976 --> 01:27:16.377]  Pre-election.
[01:27:16.377 --> 01:27:17.658]  Let's go to Brad in PA.
[01:27:17.658 --> 01:27:18.398]  Thanks for holding, Brad.
[01:27:18.398 --> 01:27:19.359]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:27:20.632 --> 01:27:21.813]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[01:27:21.813 --> 01:27:23.234]  Good, brother.
[01:27:23.234 --> 01:27:26.317]  Hey, that clip of Obama, it's just another example.
[01:27:26.317 --> 01:27:29.560]  He is just the best pathological liar they've ever come up with.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:30.561]  It's unbelievable.
[01:27:30.561 --> 01:27:33.584]  Everything he says, you just gotta check it and you just analyze it.
[01:27:33.584 --> 01:27:34.885]  And yes, he's lying again.
[01:27:34.885 --> 01:27:36.647]  Yes, he's perfect at it.
[01:27:36.647 --> 01:27:39.770]  They picked the perfect guy for this job.
[01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:40.871]  Unbelievable.
[01:27:40.871 --> 01:27:42.953]  Hey, are you a radio broadcaster?
[01:27:42.953 --> 01:27:44.134]  No, but I'd love to be.
[01:27:44.898 --> 01:27:46.419]  You have a good radio voice.
[01:27:46.419 --> 01:27:57.924]  Yeah, thanks, but you're the best radio guy out there, man, and I don't mean to just say that, but I've listened to you since 9-11 or after that, and it's like a history lesson every day, and I just love listening to you, Alex.
[01:27:57.924 --> 01:28:01.166]  You only spit the truth out there like no one else.
[01:28:02.086 --> 01:28:07.231]  It's just a pleasure every day that I get to listen to you or watch on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:07.231 --> 01:28:13.036]  I'd highly recommend anybody join because you can Roku it, you can skip right through the commercials.
[01:28:13.036 --> 01:28:16.139]  It's an excellent way to watch it or listen to it.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:24.684]  Well, yeah, and tell your friends and family, if they've got cable or smart boxes, they can use prisonplanet.tv.
[01:28:24.684 --> 01:28:27.526]  You can give them your username and passcode.
[01:28:27.526 --> 01:28:30.647]  Up to 11 people can simultaneously use it.
[01:28:30.647 --> 01:28:32.889]  And as we get more bandwidth and more funds come in,
[01:28:33.789 --> 01:28:38.256]  I'm thinking about changing the system where 30 people can use it.
[01:28:38.256 --> 01:28:48.109]  So you go get a membership so you can give it to friends and family with a username and passcode or where it creates a group of account numbers or something so you can hand them out.
[01:28:49.318 --> 01:28:49.718]  I don't know.
[01:29:11.476 --> 01:29:13.777]  Because I know we put in bigger, better servers now.
[01:29:13.777 --> 01:29:15.378]  It hasn't been having problems.
[01:29:15.378 --> 01:29:17.619]  Even we have up to 100,000 people watching at once.
[01:29:17.619 --> 01:29:20.600]  So I just want to go up to 20.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:23.521]  Because most people don't share it with more than 11.
[01:29:23.521 --> 01:29:25.162]  Share the username and passcode.
[01:29:25.162 --> 01:29:27.923]  Make sure it's not the same username and passcode you have everything else.
[01:29:27.923 --> 01:29:29.004]  You can go change it if you want.
[01:29:29.004 --> 01:29:30.184]  Make it unique.
[01:29:30.184 --> 01:29:31.965]  And give it to friends and family.

[01:29:36.266 --> 01:29:49.339]  Yeah, I would just like to mention, you know, people out there listening, as far as what's going on in Ferguson, it's another, they seem to, everything seems to be... I'm gonna come back to you, I'm gonna come back to you.
[01:29:49.339 --> 01:29:52.722]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.722 --> 01:29:55.405]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:12.138 --> 01:30:19.204]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[01:30:19.224 --> 01:30:19.904]  We're good to go.
[01:30:40.049 --> 01:30:40.590]  We're good.
[01:30:59.421 --> 01:31:09.968]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:31:09.968 --> 01:31:16.431]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:31:16.431 --> 01:31:18.773]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:31:18.773 --> 01:31:21.875]  I look forward to waking up and taking my Super Male Vitality.

[01:31:29.255 --> 01:31:32.918]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:31:32.918 --> 01:31:37.201]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:37.201 --> 01:31:38.982]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:38.982 --> 01:31:44.306]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:31:44.306 --> 01:31:46.848]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:31:46.848 --> 01:31:47.989]  But for how long?
[01:31:47.989 --> 01:31:50.210]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:54.634]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:31:54.634 --> 01:31:56.495]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:31:56.495 --> 01:31:57.436]  Just won't quit.
[01:31:59.195 --> 01:32:00.496]  The experts are clear.
[01:32:00.496 --> 01:32:07.622]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:13.888]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[01:32:13.888 --> 01:32:17.491]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:32:17.611 --> 01:32:21.833]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:32:21.833 --> 01:32:27.155]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:32:27.155 --> 01:32:28.156]  Not our iodine.
[01:32:28.156 --> 01:32:34.518]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:33:04.858 --> 01:33:10.903]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:10.903 --> 01:33:13.425]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.422 --> 01:33:27.686]  Brad wanted to comment on the Ferguson situation with police departments across the country saying they're bracing for LA riot-style events.
[01:33:27.686 --> 01:33:31.268]  We've got feds mashing dozens and dozens of trucks nearby.
[01:33:31.268 --> 01:33:35.690]  A hotel manager took photos of it, got fired for doing so.
[01:33:35.690 --> 01:33:38.492]  The video of that and the trucks is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:40.362 --> 01:33:46.509]  Simply amazing, and the way the media's been hyping this and building it up, if the verdict comes tonight, tomorrow, who knows?
[01:33:46.509 --> 01:33:49.753]  They're saying sometime this week it could be explosive.
[01:33:49.753 --> 01:33:52.336]  We appreciate the courage of our reporters out there on the ground.
[01:33:52.336 --> 01:33:58.003]  We'll talk to Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson, who are in the middle of this story, here in just a moment.
[01:33:58.003 --> 01:33:58.984]  But Brad, what's your point?
[01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:04.204]  My point is that everything that comes out of D.C.
[01:34:04.204 --> 01:34:07.287]  tends to be a psy-op, and you know it as well as anybody.
[01:34:07.287 --> 01:34:09.389]  You point it out all the time, Alex.
[01:34:09.389 --> 01:34:14.794]  Like Paul Joseph Watson and you always note, it's an order out of chaos.
[01:34:14.794 --> 01:34:20.380]  I just hope and pray that all the blacks out there, especially the blacks, don't lose their mind and riot over this.
[01:34:21.841 --> 01:34:23.383]  It looked like the guy was guilty.
[01:34:23.383 --> 01:34:26.446]  I mean, I'm not saying it's right that the cop shot and killed him.
[01:34:26.446 --> 01:34:30.371]  Obviously, that's not good, but he was defending himself, it appears.
[01:34:30.371 --> 01:34:34.535]  And the guy did rob a convenience store or was acting like a thug in there.
[01:34:34.535 --> 01:34:38.780]  And I'm sorry that he was killed, but it's no reason for people to riot.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:42.063]  And they're just using it to get order out of chaos.
[01:34:42.063 --> 01:34:42.644]  That's my point.
[01:34:43.885 --> 01:34:44.445]  You're right.
[01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:47.287]  We're going to get Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson's take.
[01:34:47.287 --> 01:34:52.109]  They're out there asking people, why do you think gun sales are up 300%?
[01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:53.670]  They've got those reports coming up.
[01:34:53.670 --> 01:35:02.175]  They're out there asking demonstrators and folks on the ground, what do you think is going to happen if people start burning down businesses and things and people shoot back?
[01:35:02.175 --> 01:35:06.117]  What will happen if people shoot back?
[01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:09.058]  And then you got more dead people.
[01:35:09.058 --> 01:35:09.959]  But at the same time,
[01:35:11.383 --> 01:35:18.206]  I think there's a mistrust because there's like two black officers out of 50-something officers in the community, 70% black.
[01:35:18.206 --> 01:35:19.486]  That's a problem.
[01:35:19.486 --> 01:35:26.029]  But that doesn't mean then somebody can thug out and, you know, run around and act like that.
[01:35:26.029 --> 01:35:28.710]  And that's what Bill Cosby talked about was the thug culture.
[01:35:28.710 --> 01:35:30.651]  It's being promoted everywhere, not just in the black community.
[01:35:30.651 --> 01:35:33.012]  And, of course, now he's being destroyed.
[01:35:33.012 --> 01:35:36.093]  Anybody that stands up against that, the system really wants this.
[01:35:37.168 --> 01:35:42.231]  So we'll talk to our reporters on that subject, and then I'm going to cover this and take your calls.
[01:35:42.231 --> 01:35:46.354]  School teaches kids the government gives us rights, close quote.
[01:35:46.354 --> 01:35:50.456]  God-given freedoms are in fact special privileges, close quote.
[01:35:50.456 --> 01:35:53.018]  Granted by the state, says handout.
[01:35:53.018 --> 01:35:56.180]  Hey, cops knew 30 years ago that driving wasn't a privilege.
[01:35:56.180 --> 01:35:57.461]  Now they'll tell you it's a privilege.
[01:35:57.461 --> 01:35:59.082]  They're now saying guns are a privilege.
[01:35:59.082 --> 01:35:59.942]  It's not true.
[01:35:59.942 --> 01:36:03.825]  I'm going to explain that coming up in a moment.
[01:36:03.825 --> 01:36:05.146]  It says being a good citizen.
[01:36:06.238 --> 01:36:08.139]  Emma, the little girl, filled that out.
[01:36:08.139 --> 01:36:09.480]  Isn't that cute?
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:10.680]  We'll be covering that in a moment.
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:14.202]  Also, two GOP presidents acted unilaterally on immigration.
[01:36:14.202 --> 01:36:16.143]  AP's saying that's why Obama can do it.
[01:36:16.143 --> 01:36:16.984]  No.
[01:36:16.984 --> 01:36:19.865]  I told you the Republicans are behind this.
[01:36:19.865 --> 01:36:20.486]  The bluebloods.
[01:36:20.486 --> 01:36:23.707]  But when Reagan did it, he had congressional approval.
[01:36:23.707 --> 01:36:25.948]  And so then he did it executively.
[01:36:25.948 --> 01:36:29.570]  And the same thing with another president, George H.W.
[01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:29.751]  Bush.
[01:36:30.908 --> 01:36:35.689]  It only encouraged more people to come and then more amnesty, so we're against that too!
[01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:36.990]  Even though it was much smaller.
[01:36:36.990 --> 01:36:39.750]  Just because Republicans did something bad doesn't mean it's okay.
[01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:41.711]  Just because Democrats did something bad doesn't mean it's okay.
[01:36:41.711 --> 01:36:45.832]  But you watch, when Republicans get in, they're gonna say, oh look, Obama did all this.
[01:36:45.832 --> 01:36:50.653]  Just as we said they would.
[01:36:50.653 --> 01:36:55.834]  It doesn't set a precedent when you commit a crime to be able to keep committing more crimes unless we let you do it.
[01:36:55.834 --> 01:36:57.455]  And we're saying we're done.
[01:36:57.455 --> 01:36:58.735]  Joining us from Ferguson,
[01:37:01.116 --> 01:37:07.199]  That would be an understatement, Alex.
[01:37:07.199 --> 01:37:09.119]  It's about 20 degrees here.
[01:37:09.119 --> 01:37:11.481]  It is pretty cold, yes.
[01:37:11.481 --> 01:37:27.028]  We're actually standing outside, if you see the flag in the background waving around, we're standing right outside of the courthouse in Clayton, Missouri, and that's where the verdict is supposed to come down either today or tomorrow, sometime this week, but it looks like it'll be tonight.
[01:37:27.632 --> 01:37:31.515]  Uh, on the verdict of whether or not Darren Wilson is found guilty of the murder of Mike Brown.
[01:37:31.515 --> 01:37:43.845]  Uh, just a little bit ago, there were some protesters, uh, walking around, uh, through the streets, and, uh, immediately, a bunch of cop cars went right behind them, followed them down the road, and, uh, you know, tell them the whole way.
[01:37:43.845 --> 01:37:47.628]  Uh, that's starting to, uh, dissipate a bit, and everyone's starting to move out.
[01:37:47.628 --> 01:37:50.951]  Other than that, there's not a lot of people out on the streets right now.
[01:37:50.951 --> 01:37:53.293]  I think a lot of people are kind of, you know,
[01:37:55.051 --> 01:37:57.453]  Taking heed to the fact that something might happen.
[01:37:57.453 --> 01:38:05.739]  I mean, there's a pretty good chance from what you see that the buzz on social media, you know, saying, hey, if you board your windows up, that's not going to stop us.
[01:38:05.739 --> 01:38:07.460]  We'll just burn your building down.
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:10.303]  So there's a lot of tension going on around this area.
[01:38:10.303 --> 01:38:15.747]  And, you know, Clayton's only to the east, I'd say about a 20 minute drive from the downtown St.
[01:38:15.747 --> 01:38:18.669]  Louis area and about a 15 minute drive south.
[01:38:19.170 --> 01:38:20.871]  of Ferguson, but this is where the St.
[01:38:20.871 --> 01:38:24.213]  Louis County Police Department's headquarters is, and the courthouse.
[01:38:24.213 --> 01:38:29.795]  So, this is where the action will begin if the verdict is released tonight.
[01:38:29.795 --> 01:38:35.778]  And, you know, like we say too, you know, NHL Stanley Cup Finals, someone wins, they still riot.
[01:38:35.778 --> 01:38:42.462]  So regardless, people are expecting to go crazy out here, and we're going to be here to document that for you guys to watch at home.
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:39:02.205]  That's right, you guys had hundreds of thousands of viewers at one time when you were doing live U-Streams that we had up on InfoWars.com when Jakari got hit by the gas, you got hit by rubber bullets, they attacked the Al Jazeera camera people and then said they were helping them, then the police officer threatened to effing kill you with a shotgun for no reason.
[01:39:02.205 --> 01:39:03.465]  He got suspended.
[01:39:03.465 --> 01:39:05.126]  We're not here trying to get cops in trouble.
[01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:08.768]  But we have a right to be out there covering it.
[01:39:08.768 --> 01:39:16.893]  You went up and told them where the cache of Moloff cocktails were, and I told you, you know, get the F back, which it looked like that was provocateured.
[01:39:16.893 --> 01:39:22.015]  You later talked to cops off-duty who said, oh yeah, it's definitely provocateured.
[01:39:22.015 --> 01:39:25.477]  You talked to some in their riot gear who said, no, we know it's staged.
[01:39:25.477 --> 01:39:27.939]  So obviously a lot of cops know what's going on.
[01:39:27.939 --> 01:39:29.360]  The problem is they're under orders.
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:36.666]  And it's one thing to say, hey, don't follow orders like Nuremberg, but at the same time, there's a lot of peer pressure.
[01:39:36.666 --> 01:39:40.569]  What is your gut telling you is going to happen when this announcement comes out?
[01:39:40.569 --> 01:39:44.893]  I know a lot of the groups have said they're still going to riot even if they indict the cop.
[01:39:44.893 --> 01:39:49.977]  Yeah, well, my biggest fear is this time is the the agent provocateur.
[01:39:49.977 --> 01:39:55.162]  I think there's going to be a lot more undercover DHS employees.
[01:39:55.162 --> 01:39:57.604]  I've had one that maybe some National Guard
[01:39:58.217 --> 01:39:58.638]  I think so.
[01:40:08.888 --> 01:40:14.712]  A lot of these protesters, I would say angry and willing to go to that level to start burning stuff.
[01:40:14.712 --> 01:40:16.734]  This is something that the government wants.
[01:40:16.734 --> 01:40:27.262]  They want these riots to happen because that helps them, you know, instate their militarized police state and lock us down again like martial law.
[01:40:27.262 --> 01:40:28.183]  Some people I know that
[01:40:29.073 --> 01:40:30.613]  You know, do a lot of the computer stuff.
[01:40:30.613 --> 01:40:43.856]  Sent me a grid where it shows an outline of the basically like a grid around the surrounding area where cops are going to be stationing tonight possibly and then closing in on everyone and locking it down.
[01:40:43.856 --> 01:40:48.397]  So you were sent by one of your sources the inside police perimeter grid.
[01:40:48.397 --> 01:40:52.998]  Will you please get that to to showtipsandinfowars.com or to Paul Watson or one of the writers?
[01:40:52.998 --> 01:40:53.918]  That's big news, Joe.
[01:40:54.656 --> 01:40:56.578]  Yeah, I just got that earlier.
[01:40:56.578 --> 01:41:03.146]  So, right now, that kind of coincides with the fact that those DHS vehicles... You got a kettling map, is what you're saying.
[01:41:03.146 --> 01:41:05.449]  You got the map of how they're going to control people.
[01:41:05.449 --> 01:41:09.354]  Yeah, they want to take that area, lock it down, and start pushing through like they did.
[01:41:10.029 --> 01:41:12.372]  Except this time it's going to be a much larger area.
[01:41:12.372 --> 01:41:15.817]  But we know that they've brought in over 2,000 outside police officers.
[01:41:15.817 --> 01:41:19.361]  You know, we've seen the pictures of all those DHS vehicles.
[01:41:19.361 --> 01:41:25.730]  You know, over the past couple weeks, there's been multiple Apache helicopter sightings in the area that have never been seen.
[01:41:28.411 --> 01:41:35.975]  And by the way, last year they sent in the armored vehicles, the tanks, and said this was a preparation for civil unrest.
[01:41:35.975 --> 01:41:39.818]  Bizarre that they sent it to that very area, all over St.
[01:41:39.818 --> 01:41:47.722]  Louis, south and north, but near Ferguson as well, and did the training for martial law, and then magically this pops up there.
[01:41:47.722 --> 01:41:50.784]  Again, the average cop that's compartmentalized doesn't know this, but we know
[01:41:51.664 --> 01:41:52.885]  From the Trayvon Martin case.
[01:42:22.424 --> 01:42:27.186]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:27.186 --> 01:42:34.188]  You know, a lot of the people around here that I've spoken to thus far, a lot of people are worried that something like this is going to happen.
[01:42:34.188 --> 01:42:41.851]  You know, when I spoke to the gun store owner the other day, he said most of the people that were coming in were families of the police officers at work.
[01:42:42.452 --> 01:42:43.072]  I mean, here's my problem.
[01:42:43.072 --> 01:42:44.833]  I don't care if you're black or white or what color you are.
[01:42:44.833 --> 01:42:46.593]  You threaten me, I'm gonna get real mad.
[01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:15.064]  Listen, all these gangbangers need to know, the citizens are all armed to the teeth, and I don't know what they think is going to happen if they try to go to some cop's house and kill people.
[01:43:15.064 --> 01:43:26.750]  I mean, this is going to get really nasty, and then if it blows up here, I think Obama, who's behind the scenes trying to stir this up, he's been caught once a race war, that could be his only surprise now in his last two years of office.
[01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:28.230]  I think it's a very serious situation.
[01:43:28.230 --> 01:43:33.893]  Well, I mean, he's trying to pass this amnesty bill, so it turns the Hispanic voter against the Republicans.
[01:43:34.193 --> 01:43:37.854]  So he can, you know, have the Hispanic voter on the Democrat side.
[01:43:37.854 --> 01:43:41.496]  So, I mean, this is all a race war at the end of the day.
[01:43:41.496 --> 01:43:41.956]  Exactly.
[01:43:41.956 --> 01:43:46.497]  The problem is Hispanic Americans in the polls aren't for open borders.
[01:43:46.497 --> 01:43:51.479]  Like, I saw a poll where 31% of Democrats are supporting it, and that's dropping every day.
[01:43:51.479 --> 01:43:57.781]  If you're a Hispanic American, how does bringing 40 million unskilled people... I mean, we used to get skilled people from Mexico.
[01:43:57.781 --> 01:43:58.641]  At least they'd work.
[01:43:58.641 --> 01:44:00.262]  A lot of Americans are spoiled.
[01:44:00.262 --> 01:44:02.663]  So, yeah, I mean, I'll grant it that
[01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:08.707]  You know, Mexican laborers, carpenters, folks work their butts off are good people on average.
[01:44:08.707 --> 01:44:11.489]  The problem is now Latin America is collapsing.
[01:44:11.489 --> 01:44:14.311]  All the welfare queens from down there weigh 500 pounds.
[01:44:14.311 --> 01:44:15.072]  I'm not being mean.
[01:44:15.072 --> 01:44:20.535]  You know, 6X underwear, that's who's showing up are unaccompanied kids.
[01:44:20.535 --> 01:44:23.798]  This is a total drain on the system.
[01:44:23.798 --> 01:44:25.639]  We have high unemployment.
[01:44:25.639 --> 01:44:29.081]  If we had 100% or 98% employment, bring in foreigners.
[01:44:29.081 --> 01:44:30.042]  We don't need it.
[01:44:30.042 --> 01:44:31.543]  It's bad for the country.
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:34.641]  Exactly.
[01:44:34.641 --> 01:44:36.243]  And this stuff's not going to help at all either.
[01:44:36.243 --> 01:44:51.558]  I mean, you know, they're expecting things in Atlanta to pop off as well, Chicago, L.A., and New York, you know, because after the initial protests that Jakari and Josh Owens and Marcos and I were at originally, you know,
[01:44:52.557 --> 01:44:55.458]  That was sparking protests all across the country.
[01:44:55.458 --> 01:45:01.579]  But if violence breaks out here, this sets a precedent for all these other big cities across the country.
[01:45:01.579 --> 01:45:06.461]  And a lot of people are going to follow in those steps, just like they did back in August with the hands up, don't shoot thing.
[01:45:06.461 --> 01:45:13.822]  Now, once they start burning buildings down and they start attacking people who are innocent, walking up and down the street because of the color of their skin, it's going to happen everywhere.
[01:45:13.822 --> 01:45:15.383]  We're going to have a huge problem.
[01:45:15.383 --> 01:45:20.204]  And then you're going to see martial law just being locked down everywhere in all these major cities.
[01:45:20.644 --> 01:45:21.844]  It's gonna be crazy.
[01:45:21.844 --> 01:45:29.746]  You know, people need to prepare for the worst, expect the best, but at the same time, you know, just be smart about it.
[01:45:29.746 --> 01:45:32.807]  I mean, you know, being out here today, this is a pretty busy area.
[01:45:32.807 --> 01:45:34.807]  We were out here yesterday driving around.
[01:45:34.807 --> 01:45:36.407]  There's a lot of people out walking around.
[01:45:36.407 --> 01:45:38.348]  Today, it's pretty dead.
[01:45:38.348 --> 01:45:42.809]  I think a lot of people are taking the threat seriously, and they're waiting to see what happens tonight.
[01:45:42.809 --> 01:45:43.829]  What about the bad weather?
[01:45:43.829 --> 01:45:49.370]  I was hoping bad weather, when the verdict came out, would keep people from going crazy.
[01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:51.663]  That's not going to happen at all.
[01:45:51.663 --> 01:45:53.426]  The people are still showing up.
[01:45:53.426 --> 01:45:54.849]  There's still talk on Twitter.
[01:45:54.849 --> 01:45:56.472]  You know, I found a lot of the people who, uh...
[01:45:57.685 --> 01:45:58.365]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:45:58.365 --> 01:45:59.066]  I've studied the law.
[01:45:59.066 --> 01:46:01.607]  When the police shoot our reporters rubber bullets, that's criminal.
[01:46:01.607 --> 01:46:03.388]  That's a felony attack on the First Amendment.
[01:46:24.941 --> 01:46:32.015]  But when so-called demonstrators on Twitter and Facebook say they're going to kill cops or burn things down, that is felonies as well.
[01:46:32.015 --> 01:46:33.578]  We need to get our reporters...
[01:46:34.895 --> 01:46:40.959]  To go look at those, I've seen those myself, do articles, and say, why aren't the police arresting people calling for violence?
[01:46:40.959 --> 01:46:52.587]  Because you have a First Amendment, until you say, let's all meet up at the corner of, you know, 6th Street and Lavaca and, you know, attack stuff, hypothetically, in Austin.
[01:46:52.587 --> 01:46:59.652]  I mean, if I said that, they should hear that, it's probable cause, you don't even need a warrant, come arrest me!
[01:46:59.652 --> 01:47:03.755]  I mean, if I got on air and said, go kill people, go burn things down, let's go,
[01:47:04.355 --> 01:47:05.717]  Yeah, they would be knocking on the door.
[01:47:05.717 --> 01:47:07.520]  Well, that's what you should do.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:18.856]  I mean, if I see somebody organizing to go kill somebody, I'm gonna call the police or I'm gonna... I mean, this is outrageous that they let Al-Qaeda and all these other groups, I notice, ISIS recruit on Facebook and Twitter, but our stuff gets censored.
[01:47:19.431 --> 01:47:29.657]  But the funny thing is though is that we've got this whole buzz in the air that the KKK is going to be out here and that's another thing to incite violence and to piss off a lot of these people.
[01:47:29.657 --> 01:47:35.541]  You should go out and, I forgot that angle, ask locals if they know that most of the time these KKK demonstrations...
[01:47:37.061 --> 01:47:43.204]  You can print off like Orlando Sentinel, FBI, clan leader, FBI leader.
[01:47:43.204 --> 01:47:45.345]  It's not like they're in the group to watch them.
[01:47:45.345 --> 01:47:52.709]  They organize, they lead them, and it turns out the entire leadership will be feds or Southern Poverty Law Center to get stuff going.
[01:47:52.709 --> 01:48:03.594]  If you Google the man who's saying he is the head of the KKK area around here, Frank Ancona, the first two things that pop up on Google are his name on the FBI death list.
[01:48:05.558 --> 01:48:07.260]  What does that mean?
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:10.903]  People that are no longer alive that the FBI is dealing with.
[01:48:10.903 --> 01:48:13.365]  Oh yeah, I know that guy from Missouri.
[01:48:13.365 --> 01:48:15.567]  It turned out he wasn't informant, I saw that.
[01:48:15.567 --> 01:48:17.749]  But also a white supremacist leader and he's supposedly dead.
[01:48:18.763 --> 01:48:21.345]  And yes, he's on the FBI kill or dead list.
[01:48:21.345 --> 01:48:28.952]  And then, you know, some of these other people that have popped up, you know, the anonymous group put out a list of all the KKK members they found in this area.
[01:48:28.952 --> 01:48:32.375]  A lot of them are supposedly police officers, firefighters.
[01:48:32.375 --> 01:48:33.876]  Well, see, that's the problem with anonymous.
[01:48:33.876 --> 01:48:34.957]  Anonymous is anonymous.
[01:48:34.957 --> 01:48:36.378]  So sometimes it's good people.
[01:48:36.378 --> 01:48:37.739]  Sometimes it's bad people.
[01:48:37.739 --> 01:48:39.601]  Anybody can use that name.
[01:48:39.601 --> 01:48:39.741]  Yeah.
[01:48:40.543 --> 01:48:42.404]  Look, folks, the PSYOP's in.
[01:48:42.404 --> 01:48:44.824]  We're trying to de-escalate the situation.
[01:48:44.824 --> 01:48:47.165]  Other people are trying to escalate the situation.
[01:48:47.165 --> 01:48:53.747]  The fact that there aren't arrests being made of these violent Facebook and Twitters is simply outrageous.
[01:48:53.747 --> 01:48:55.328]  These are terroristic threats.
[01:48:55.328 --> 01:48:57.588]  These are organizing criminal activity.
[01:48:57.588 --> 01:48:58.869]  This is racketeering.
[01:48:58.869 --> 01:48:59.469]  It's illegal.
[01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:03.192]  And it makes good protesting look bad is why the feds are in it.
[01:49:03.192 --> 01:49:06.394]  I guarantee you it's the Justice Department quarterbacking this.
[01:49:06.394 --> 01:49:12.038]  We're going to skip this one network break so we can talk to Jakari Jackson and go to phone calls ahead of John Rapoport.
[01:49:12.038 --> 01:49:18.083]  Rhonda in Hawaii, Angela, Shamus, Ryan and Indico Kid will go to all of you.
[01:49:18.083 --> 01:49:21.546]  Thank you, Joe Biggs, for your courage to be there reporting this.
[01:49:21.546 --> 01:49:25.749]  You guys stay dry and stay focused and just keep filing reports.
[01:49:25.749 --> 01:49:26.470]  Great job.
[01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:28.031]  If you need somebody in Mexico, I'm there.
[01:49:29.565 --> 01:49:31.025]  You want to go to Mexico?
[01:49:31.025 --> 01:49:32.486]  I'll go anywhere.
[01:49:32.486 --> 01:49:33.826]  Well, it's going on the next few days.
[01:49:33.826 --> 01:49:34.426]  I've got to decide.
[01:49:34.426 --> 01:49:35.426]  But I know you like that.
[01:49:35.426 --> 01:49:37.226]  But you don't want to go to Mexico City.
[01:49:37.226 --> 01:49:38.587]  They say there's nothing more hellish.
[01:49:38.587 --> 01:49:40.587]  But it's also pretty in some ways.
[01:49:40.587 --> 01:49:42.567]  But we'll figure it out, Joe.
[01:49:42.567 --> 01:49:43.028]  Great job.
[01:49:43.028 --> 01:49:43.908]  Let me talk to Shaqari.
[01:49:43.908 --> 01:49:44.628]  Thank you.
[01:49:44.628 --> 01:49:44.908]  All right.
[01:49:44.908 --> 01:49:52.869]  That's Joe Biggs from combat in Afghanistan and Iraq to Ferguson and the border and the rest of it.
[01:49:52.869 --> 01:49:55.110]  One of our investigative journalists there on the ground.
[01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:58.172]  I can see his teeth are chattering.
[01:49:58.172 --> 01:50:02.135]  So I want to get this interview with Jakari done and let them get back to a warm area.
[01:50:02.135 --> 01:50:08.140]  We could do it from the hotel rooms, but it looks better to have them out there in the snow-covered park across from the courthouse.
[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:09.601]  Two great reporters and a great team.
[01:50:09.601 --> 01:50:15.266]  People keep asking why I send Jakari and Joe out together with Josh Owens when he can go.
[01:50:15.266 --> 01:50:16.207]  He's not there right now.
[01:50:16.207 --> 01:50:19.510]  It's because they work as a great team.
[01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:22.072]  Jakari, please don't freeze to death, my friend.
[01:50:23.045 --> 01:50:24.306]  I'm doing my best, Alex.
[01:50:24.306 --> 01:50:27.068]  I'm pretty layered up, but it is really cold out here.
[01:50:27.068 --> 01:50:30.431]  It's Gary Jackson reporting from Clayton, Missouri.
[01:50:30.431 --> 01:50:37.016]  Like Joe said, if you're just now joining us, we're right in front of the courthouse where they expect to hear the verdict on Officer Wilson.
[01:50:37.016 --> 01:50:44.602]  There were some people out here protesting earlier today, and I don't want everybody to lose the fact that there are peaceful protesters out here, peaceful demonstrators.
[01:50:44.602 --> 01:50:49.786]  They just recently finished, but you have peaceful people who are walking around just saying, hey, we want to find out what's going on.
[01:50:49.786 --> 01:50:51.447]  We want to get to the bottom of the situation.
[01:50:51.807 --> 01:51:00.789]  You know, I know we hear a lot about the people threatening to burn things down and loot things, but we also have the peaceful people who just want to find out what's going on in their community.
[01:51:00.789 --> 01:51:09.130]  Well, that's why the feds are infiltrating and trying to radicalize things, because they can demonize demonstrations while acting like they're the saviors from the local police.
[01:51:09.130 --> 01:51:12.311]  What's your take on the overall psyop?
[01:51:12.311 --> 01:51:17.451]  Well, I think thus far, you know, it's been a real strong divide.
[01:51:17.451 --> 01:51:20.632]  They managed to get that racial divide in here pretty early, because we see
[01:51:21.807 --> 01:51:24.950]  Um, episodes of police brutality that's not debatable.
[01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:28.754]  Like, for example, Kelly Thomas out in California, the guy was beat to death.
[01:51:29.158 --> 01:51:33.442]  You know, with cops standing over him over courts of 20 minutes, he's begging for his daddy to come and save him.
[01:51:33.442 --> 01:51:35.604]  And you know, there's nothing alleged about that.
[01:51:35.604 --> 01:51:39.547]  You know, there's a lot of questions, a lot of speculation about what happened to Mike Brown.
[01:51:39.547 --> 01:51:42.550]  And by the way, they indicted those cops, but they got off.
[01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:44.192]  And they really shouldn't have gotten off.
[01:51:44.192 --> 01:51:46.033]  They should have gotten some prison time.
[01:51:46.033 --> 01:51:49.116]  And of course, notice, that guy's dad was a cop.
[01:51:49.116 --> 01:51:51.859]  So see, cops are having their sons killed by crazy cops.
[01:51:52.722 --> 01:52:14.800]  Yeah I mean you're not safe from the system and like we were out here the original time back in August and I was talking to some of the SWAT officers I was like you know your kids have to live in this country too you know so one day they want to come out here and protest about something they think is wrong or they think is right you know they have to deal with this police force they have to deal with officers pointing rifles at them for just being in a crowd on a street in the United States of America.
[01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:17.441]  So hopefully the cool heads will prevail.
[01:52:17.441 --> 01:52:18.761]  Go ahead Alex.
[01:52:18.761 --> 01:52:29.164]  What was it like for you when they were aiming M4s with real bullets at you when you're doing nothing and Joe's doing nothing and then they're letting rioters operate a block away?
[01:52:29.164 --> 01:52:34.185]  Why do you think they were able to get the cops to just have such hatred for the press?
[01:52:35.712 --> 01:52:38.835]  I think, you know what it is, a lot of it, they didn't want the story to be told.
[01:52:38.835 --> 01:52:45.060]  Because the footage that we got, the first night we got here, because Mike got shot on a Saturday I believe it was, we got here that following Tuesday.
[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:48.042]  And you know, they're aiming guns at people in the crowd.
[01:52:48.042 --> 01:52:49.904]  And as far as I know, we broke that story.
[01:52:49.904 --> 01:52:52.246]  You know, they're putting laser dots on people's chests.
[01:52:52.246 --> 01:53:02.434]  And even though there are some local news outlets out there, I didn't see that on any local news, that they were aiming guns at people in the crowd until, you know, a couple days later when, you know, CNN and the rest of the big boys came out here to play.
[01:53:02.954 --> 01:53:05.056]  So, you know, they don't want the press to get the story out.
[01:53:05.056 --> 01:53:06.857]  Of course, Al Jazeera, everybody knows that.
[01:53:06.857 --> 01:53:08.378]  I was right there when it happened.
[01:53:08.378 --> 01:53:11.860]  You know, they have the cameras, they have the lights set up, yelling, press, press.
[01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:13.421]  And I said, mama, they don't care that you're French.
[01:53:13.421 --> 01:53:14.322]  They want to shoot you.
[01:53:14.322 --> 01:53:17.524]  So, you know, you have to be concerned about things like that.
[01:53:17.524 --> 01:53:18.664]  Will it continue tonight?
[01:53:18.664 --> 01:53:19.085]  I don't know.
[01:53:19.085 --> 01:53:22.567]  Thus far, we have not had any conflicts with the police.
[01:53:22.567 --> 01:53:24.188]  There are multiple police agencies out here.
[01:53:24.188 --> 01:53:30.432]  This is where the county police are, but some of the smaller towns, they all have their cars rolling around here just in case something happens.
[01:53:31.115 --> 01:53:32.536]  So, we'll be here to report it.
[01:53:32.536 --> 01:53:36.799]  Hopefully, we won't have any static like we did last time, but we do have the IFDL body armor.
[01:53:36.799 --> 01:53:42.483]  We're definitely thankful for that in case they start shooting at us again, in case they pull out some live ordnance.
[01:53:42.483 --> 01:53:45.626]  You know, of course, Joe Biggs got shot last time with a rubber bullet.
[01:53:45.626 --> 01:53:49.509]  And then, Gerald, didn't they come out and say they didn't shoot any rubber bullets?
[01:53:49.509 --> 01:53:52.331]  They came out and said that in a press release by the
[01:53:53.049 --> 01:53:53.609]  The St.
[01:53:53.609 --> 01:54:01.633]  Louis County Police that no rubber bullets were fired, no CS gas was used, no flash bangs, no baton rounds, and here we are.
[01:54:01.633 --> 01:54:05.275]  Even though you picked up dozens of them, big ol' .50 caliber ones.
[01:54:05.275 --> 01:54:10.718]  Whoever's in my office, in the reporter room, I have on my desk a CS canister.
[01:54:10.718 --> 01:54:12.519]  Picked that up, run it into Alex.
[01:54:12.519 --> 01:54:16.321]  We brought that back from Ferguson, Missouri, but they said that was never used.
[01:54:16.321 --> 01:54:17.661]  The rubber bullets that Joe has.
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:29.503]  I had to retweet a whole bunch of pictures on Twitter and it's now gone viral because everyone's saying, oh, maybe they didn't use it and I had to go and publish them again to show what's being used because they're still lying.
[01:54:29.503 --> 01:54:30.524]  It's November.
[01:54:30.524 --> 01:54:31.484]  This happened in August.
[01:54:31.484 --> 01:54:33.825]  They still have the gall to lie about it again.
[01:54:33.825 --> 01:54:34.865]  Yeah, they're lying about it.
[01:54:34.865 --> 01:54:36.486]  And remember the night I got tear gas?
[01:54:36.486 --> 01:54:42.248]  We all got tear gas and they came out to all the people who were in the free speech zone and said, that's not tear gas.
[01:54:42.248 --> 01:54:46.969]  And then, and one of the greatest, some of the greatest footage that you'll never see on CNN.
[01:54:46.969 --> 01:54:48.910]  Me and Joe, we had to run like three miles
[01:54:49.582 --> 01:54:51.583]  I was like, you guys are a bunch of cowards.
[01:54:51.583 --> 01:54:53.303]  You're not reporting the truth.
[01:55:09.787 --> 01:55:12.249]  I'm like, you guys need to be real Americans.
[01:55:12.249 --> 01:55:13.410]  Do your job as a journalist.
[01:55:13.410 --> 01:55:14.611]  Report what's going on.
[01:55:14.611 --> 01:55:16.893]  Stop lying for these police officers.
[01:55:16.893 --> 01:55:18.334]  Stop lying for the government.
[01:55:18.334 --> 01:55:20.716]  And tell them that you're using these baton rounds.
[01:55:20.716 --> 01:55:23.678]  Let them know that you're shooting at journalists with rubber bullets.
[01:55:23.678 --> 01:55:27.622]  Well, I was about to say, how can they cover up Ebola cases we know are in the U.S.
[01:55:27.622 --> 01:55:28.843]  that are disappearing people?
[01:55:28.843 --> 01:55:33.026]  Because the Forbes writer said they all met and agreed before the press conference to lie.
[01:55:33.026 --> 01:55:34.888]  And that was even in Forbes.
[01:55:34.888 --> 01:55:37.310]  And confirming what we have eyewitnesses,
[01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:40.452]  And how do they cover up their bus in the Illegals Inn?
[01:55:40.452 --> 01:55:41.173]  Hold on, Alex.
[01:55:41.173 --> 01:55:42.594]  We have a gentleman.
[01:55:42.594 --> 01:55:43.855]  Come on in here, sir.
[01:55:43.855 --> 01:55:46.117]  Now tell us what you were just telling us when you walked up here.
[01:55:46.673 --> 01:56:00.122]  Well, I happen to observe a gentleman when he was speaking, I say, I can't believe that I finna walk to my truck and all the journalists and the newscasters that I ran into, they just been telling falsehoods, they just steady lying, covering up for one another.
[01:56:00.122 --> 01:56:05.887]  And I can't believe that they steady, steady asking questions like, what gonna happen after the verdict?
[01:56:05.887 --> 01:56:08.428]  And it's such and such, everybody know what's going on.
[01:56:08.428 --> 01:56:13.432]  Everybody know from the governor down, what's going on, the cover up and why they doing what they doing.
[01:56:13.968 --> 01:56:20.231]  To me, to be honest with you, I honestly think they're trying to incite a riot in St.
[01:56:20.231 --> 01:56:21.012]  Louis, Missouri.
[01:56:21.012 --> 01:56:22.693]  I guess it's for a revenue purpose.
[01:56:22.693 --> 01:56:24.894]  I don't know what it's for, but I can say this.
[01:56:25.552 --> 01:56:26.793]  What they doing?
[01:56:26.793 --> 01:56:43.624]  It's uncaused for, it's unjustice and they stay in line because day one they said never was a call that came across the radio was the officer approached the gentleman in the streets and now 101 days later you saying that it was a call that came across the radio so what is the truth?
[01:56:43.624 --> 01:56:47.747]  You know the truth don't need no support and one thing about it I'm glad that these gentlemen out here
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:55.863]  Expressing the truth, doing what needs to be done, and shame on all the other newscasters that's in St.
[01:56:55.863 --> 01:57:03.547]  Louis, Missouri, the reporters that's not putting out the truth, and you got to deal with that consequence yourself because the blood is on everybody's hands.
[01:57:03.547 --> 01:57:04.307]  Absolutely.
[01:57:04.307 --> 01:57:04.928]  Ask him his name.
[01:57:04.928 --> 01:57:05.768]  If you choose to lie.
[01:57:05.768 --> 01:57:06.728]  What's your name, sir?
[01:57:06.728 --> 01:57:08.169]  My name is Andre Anderson.
[01:57:08.169 --> 01:57:09.230]  All right, good to talk to you.
[01:57:09.230 --> 01:57:10.410]  Steady lying.
[01:57:10.410 --> 01:57:11.651]  That's a good word to describe it.
[01:57:11.651 --> 01:57:13.992]  Ja'Kari, we'll check in with you on the nightly news tonight.
[01:57:13.992 --> 01:57:15.733]  BreakingReportsInfoWorks.com.
[01:57:15.733 --> 01:57:16.353]  Fabulous job.
[01:57:17.325 --> 01:57:18.065]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:57:18.065 --> 01:57:18.966]  Thank you, Jakari.
[01:57:18.966 --> 01:57:22.627]  All right, folks, we're going to end this hour, come back, take some more calls.
[01:57:22.627 --> 01:57:26.949]  We're going to hold Rappaport until I'm done with Rhonda, Chad, Shamus, Ryan, Indico, Kevin.
[01:57:26.949 --> 01:57:32.251]  We should get to him about 15 after or so on the Global Sterilization Program.
[01:57:32.251 --> 01:57:36.413]  We're just trying to report all sides and the facts wherever they take us.
[01:57:36.413 --> 01:57:38.154]  And that's what we're doing here at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:40.598 --> 01:57:42.499]  We are selling out.
[01:57:42.499 --> 01:57:55.365]  In fact, I think it'll be sold out by tomorrow of the Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2, and it looks like it'll be about two weeks till more of that is out, and we will be sold out in the next few days of Secret 12.
[01:57:55.365 --> 01:58:02.688]  We were able to get a little bit more of an in that'll be in next week, so I don't call that backordered, but we are officially sold out of what's in stock.
[01:58:03.752 --> 01:58:04.112]  I think so.
[01:58:26.238 --> 01:58:28.699]  Check it out for yourself and help support the transmission.
[01:58:28.699 --> 01:58:32.700]  Secret 12, Survival Shield X2, Oxy Powder, Super Mel Vitality.

[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.501]  Third hour coming up.

[01:58:41.042 --> 01:58:42.062]  Stay with us.

[01:59:01.707 --> 01:59:10.433]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:10.433 --> 01:59:13.676]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[01:59:32.517 --> 01:59:35.398]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:59:46.301 --> 01:59:47.082]  Got it.
[01:59:47.082 --> 01:59:47.962]  Others don't.
[01:59:51.511 --> 01:59:54.120]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:05.478 --> 02:00:06.779]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.779 --> 02:00:08.541]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.541 --> 02:00:10.302]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.302 --> 02:00:11.883]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.883 --> 02:00:13.444]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.444 --> 02:00:17.628]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.628 --> 02:00:22.872]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.872 --> 02:00:25.414]  Well, we cover on the waterfront mainly secret U.N.
[02:00:25.414 --> 02:00:27.436]  sterilization programs that have been discovered.
[02:00:28.971 --> 02:00:33.033]  With John Rappaport coming up, investigative journalist, Rhonda in Hawaii.
[02:00:33.033 --> 02:00:34.134]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:34.134 --> 02:00:36.395]  Great to have you on the broadcast.
[02:00:36.395 --> 02:00:37.415]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:37.415 --> 02:00:38.976]  Thanks for having me.
[02:00:38.976 --> 02:00:40.397]  Welcome.
[02:00:40.397 --> 02:00:54.464]  What I wanted to say, Augusta, is so many things, but essentially I heard you referencing a constitutional convention and the possible need for that, even though it's been highly, I guess, demonized.
[02:00:55.722 --> 02:00:59.726]  The law of the land has essentially been abolished, and we know that.
[02:00:59.726 --> 02:01:07.252]  All the things that we're seeing, the First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, are completely being crushed underneath the tyranny of our own government, supposedly our own government.
[02:01:07.252 --> 02:01:14.798]  What people don't understand is that they are the rightful owners of everything that exists in this nation because we have essentially paid for it with our labor.
[02:01:14.798 --> 02:01:16.360]  So why are people
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:31.726]  Much like yourself, and all of the, I guess the underground media, people afraid to organize a constitutional convention, and model it similar to the Women's Suffrage Movement, which was the most successful political movement ever.
[02:01:31.726 --> 02:01:36.188]  I mean, in three years they had an amendment to the Constitution, and women had the right to vote.
[02:01:36.188 --> 02:01:41.610]  And it was done at a local community level, through people who understood the foundation of our liberties and our freedom.
[02:01:43.792 --> 02:01:52.655]  Nothing that I hear in the media even comes close to telling us how we can actually correct what's wrong in this country.
[02:01:52.655 --> 02:02:03.698]  Well that's right, and I've always been against a con-con because they can rewrite everything while they're doing it, but now they're just ignoring the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution to begin with, and the states I trust a lot more at this point.
[02:02:03.698 --> 02:02:08.140]  You're supposed to have a balance of power than the globalists, so we need the states to go in
[02:02:09.164 --> 02:02:14.547]  And have a con-con to remove the federal government, if need be, and reconstitute it, because this is not a federal government.
[02:02:14.547 --> 02:02:17.808]  This is a criminal gang taking over.
[02:02:17.808 --> 02:02:23.091]  I mean, I'm reading this article by Paul Joseph Watson that I've got to go over with Rapoport.
[02:02:23.091 --> 02:02:26.272]  School teaches kids the government gives us rights.
[02:02:26.272 --> 02:02:32.616]  And I was reading it, and it says, the president makes sure the country's laws are fair.
[02:02:32.616 --> 02:02:35.077]  The commands of government officials must be obeyed by all.
[02:02:35.936 --> 02:02:37.797]  The choices of the president affect everyone.
[02:02:37.797 --> 02:02:40.257]  It basically says the president's a dictator.
[02:02:40.257 --> 02:02:51.540]  Number six, the wants of the individual are less important than the well-being of the nation.
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:53.341]  Well, no, the individual's taking care of them.
[02:02:53.341 --> 02:02:54.321]  That's the cellular level.
[02:02:54.321 --> 02:02:55.462]  The nation's healthier.
[02:02:55.462 --> 02:02:59.143]  The individual's wants are less important than well-being than the nation.
[02:02:59.143 --> 02:03:00.123]  I mean, they have everybody.
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:06.666]  Just repeat all this and it's written so that a parent reading this will like go along with it.
[02:03:06.666 --> 02:03:10.851]  The job of a president is not easy.
[02:03:10.851 --> 02:03:12.173]  I mean it's all just so sick.
[02:03:12.173 --> 02:03:12.934]  What do you think about that?
[02:03:14.366 --> 02:03:18.368]  Well, I think that if we had an actual president, we might have a chance.
[02:03:18.368 --> 02:03:28.915]  If we had the executive office operating according to its constitutional limitations of power, rather than as a dictatorship, we might have a chance of correcting some of the ills of our nation.
[02:03:28.915 --> 02:03:32.317]  But we had a Supreme Court that operated within the constraints of the
[02:03:32.917 --> 02:03:37.820]  That's what Thomas Jefferson, that's what the founders tried to tell us and teach us.
[02:03:58.337 --> 02:04:01.660]  We are the only hope of restoring the law of the land.
[02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:08.566]  And we have to do it at a local level with personally chosen individuals who represent, obviously, the minority.
[02:04:08.566 --> 02:04:17.053]  That's what the Constitutional Convention is about, because the majority are a bunch of dumbed-down sheeples who are agents of a socialist democracy designed to destroy our country.
[02:04:17.193 --> 02:04:22.936]  That's right, we've reached a point where the government is completely alien to the original Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:04:22.936 --> 02:04:27.699]  It's totally illegitimate, and anybody can read the Declaration of Independence compared to what we have now.
[02:04:27.699 --> 02:04:35.384]  It's night and day, and it's only going to get worse until people realize it's the corruption that's destroying the prosperity.
[02:04:35.384 --> 02:04:40.507]  And people have to instinctively stand up against corruption every way they can.
[02:04:40.507 --> 02:04:42.488]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:04:42.488 --> 02:04:42.809]  Rhonda.
[02:04:43.789 --> 02:04:50.154]  It's just so good to talk to these callers, these people that really love freedom and are passionate about fighting fraud.
[02:04:50.154 --> 02:04:53.717]  If we had a nation more like these people, we wouldn't be in this problem.
[02:04:53.717 --> 02:04:58.881]  Alright, we're gonna come right back with Ryan and with Shamus, Chad, Indigo Kid, and others.
[02:04:59.662 --> 02:05:03.323]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:03.323 --> 02:05:07.605]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:07.605 --> 02:05:09.385]  Can you put two and two together?

[02:05:58.900 --> 02:06:00.901]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:06:00.901 --> 02:06:05.424]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[02:06:05.424 --> 02:06:09.887]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:06:09.887 --> 02:06:17.211]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:06:17.211 --> 02:06:26.277]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[02:07:00.565 --> 02:07:04.128]  The new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:07:04.128 --> 02:07:10.432]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:07:10.432 --> 02:07:17.757]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:07:17.757 --> 02:07:27.604]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.

[02:07:34.408 --> 02:07:39.252]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:07:39.252 --> 02:07:42.854]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[02:07:59.406 --> 02:08:04.434]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:08:27.529 --> 02:08:38.455]  John Rappaport, investigative journalist, will be joining us to cover the waterfront from social engineering in the public schools to India's mass sterilization in the London Guardian being reported.
[02:08:38.455 --> 02:08:41.236]  That's just some of the news.
[02:08:41.236 --> 02:08:43.917]  Depopulation vaccine in Kenya and beyond.
[02:08:43.917 --> 02:08:49.400]  Is the UN using vaccines to secretly sterilize women?
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:50.701]  Do walruses have tusks?
[02:08:52.489 --> 02:08:54.431]  That's all coming up today.
[02:08:54.431 --> 02:08:57.433]  Rappaport's coming up in a few minutes, but I want to go to some more of your calls.
[02:08:57.433 --> 02:09:02.638]  First, Ryan in Illinois, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:09:02.638 --> 02:09:04.700]  Hey Alex, appreciate what you and the team do.
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:06.761]  Trying to wake everybody up.
[02:09:06.761 --> 02:09:11.325]  What's going on with our food supply and the land all across the country.
[02:09:11.325 --> 02:09:13.908]  But the poison and... Yes, sir.
[02:09:13.908 --> 02:09:18.371]  Just the absolute... I mean, just... All out of salt.
[02:09:18.371 --> 02:09:19.873]  All we're doing is raising the alarm.
[02:09:21.229 --> 02:09:31.673]  And I'm a fourth generation farmer, and in 98 we switched over and started raising our crops or animals organically, because we saw what was going on.
[02:09:31.673 --> 02:09:35.934]  And it's just what big ag corporations are doing.
[02:09:35.934 --> 02:09:46.318]  They're slowly, as the small farmers drop out and things get more and more consolidated with fewer and fewer farmers out there, it's easier to control them.
[02:09:46.318 --> 02:09:47.138]  And they don't
[02:09:47.682 --> 02:09:51.084]  They think they're independent, but they aren't farming their own ground.
[02:09:51.084 --> 02:09:58.628]  These big ag companies are pushing a message, and they're all just like zombies, just falling in line, falling in line.
[02:09:58.628 --> 02:10:05.892]  And it's raising a huge food security all across the country, like what happened in 2012.
[02:10:05.892 --> 02:10:14.977]  We experienced a drought, and we're on some of the most productive ground in the world in central Illinois, and that drought just caused food prices to spike.
[02:10:14.977 --> 02:10:17.118]  Well, it's because everybody's doing the same thing.
[02:10:17.881 --> 02:10:22.983]  There's no engine of growth in the farming community anymore.
[02:10:22.983 --> 02:10:23.424]  That's right.
[02:10:23.424 --> 02:10:31.727]  They've used farm subsidies and manipulation and Big Agra to take us from being the supplier of the world's food to having to import food now.
[02:10:31.727 --> 02:10:33.408]  That's a really important point.
[02:10:33.408 --> 02:10:42.652]  But I know more and more people are purchasing organic and so that's been helping some of the smaller farmers get established or convert over to that.
[02:10:42.652 --> 02:10:43.653]  Have you been able to survive?
[02:10:44.901 --> 02:10:48.042]  Yeah, actually we've gone from where we were in 98.
[02:10:48.042 --> 02:10:55.125]  I mean, we're not big by any means, but in 98 we switched over and it's taken probably five, six years to get things going.
[02:10:55.125 --> 02:11:09.871]  But the thing that worries me is the longer this continues where people in the community, like our area, the ag community, the longer these farmers keep doing the same status quo thing that they're getting
[02:11:10.692 --> 02:11:18.234]  Brainwashed in the doing, the more the soil becomes dead and the longer it's going to take to get it back.
[02:11:18.234 --> 02:11:19.095]  Interesting point.
[02:11:19.095 --> 02:11:25.116]  Yeah, they're trying to kill the original diverse farming culture where all you know is this chemical poisonous agriculture.
[02:11:25.116 --> 02:11:26.917]  Thank you so much, Ryan.
[02:11:26.917 --> 02:11:30.918]  And the studies out there of what all these chemicals do to the farmers is just incredible.
[02:11:30.918 --> 02:11:32.899]  Seamus in California, you're on the air.
[02:11:32.899 --> 02:11:33.239]  Go ahead.
[02:11:40.154 --> 02:11:41.838]  Yep, you're on the air.
[02:11:41.838 --> 02:11:42.801]  Oh, how's it going, Alex?
[02:11:42.801 --> 02:11:43.803]  This is, uh, Seamus.
[02:11:43.803 --> 02:11:46.390]  I'm the lead singer and the drummer for the Otis Bogg People.
[02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:48.414]  We're a hard rock band out of Chico, California.
[02:11:48.414 --> 02:11:48.836]  Interesting.
[02:11:48.836 --> 02:11:49.658]  I'd like to check it out.
[02:11:51.251 --> 02:11:56.456]  I look around every day on media and I see open borders, I see these militarized police.
[02:11:56.456 --> 02:11:58.838]  Everywhere I look I see loss of freedom.
[02:11:58.838 --> 02:12:05.523]  We got police in our schools, they're indoctrinating our kids to this injustice system at early and earlier ages.
[02:12:05.523 --> 02:12:06.644]  When is it going to be too much?
[02:12:06.644 --> 02:12:08.085]  Where's the line in the sand?
[02:12:08.085 --> 02:12:15.892]  Well, Nuremberg was all about don't follow orders of a corrupt government, but we have a training manual up on InfoWars.com
[02:12:17.312 --> 02:12:25.117]  You know, they call it a school handout or homework, but really what it is is brainwashing.
[02:12:25.117 --> 02:12:28.119]  School teaches kids the government gives us rights.
[02:12:28.119 --> 02:12:33.082]  God-given freedoms are in fact, quote, special privileges granted by the state.
[02:12:33.082 --> 02:12:38.146]  And it goes in to say that everything is a privilege.
[02:12:39.465 --> 02:12:39.885]  We're good to go.
[02:13:02.839 --> 02:13:04.600]  Uh, choices affect everyone.
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:07.382]  He makes sure the country's laws are fair.
[02:13:07.382 --> 02:13:09.383]  The government commands must be obeyed.
[02:13:09.383 --> 02:13:11.264]  And they have the kid copy that.
[02:13:11.264 --> 02:13:11.664]  Really?
[02:13:11.664 --> 02:13:15.707]  No, government commands that are unconstitutional and obviously illegal are not obeyed.
[02:13:16.997 --> 02:13:19.598]  But they just sit there and brainwash the kids.
[02:13:19.598 --> 02:13:24.240]  This is nothing but school to prison pipeline period premeditated.
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:26.902]  Does that mean the average cop or jailkeeper is a bad person?
[02:13:26.902 --> 02:13:27.702]  No.
[02:13:27.702 --> 02:13:30.583]  But our economy is converting to a prison system.
[02:13:30.583 --> 02:13:31.804]  This is happening.
[02:13:31.804 --> 02:13:33.284]  They're expanding and it's a nightmare.
[02:13:33.284 --> 02:13:34.205]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:35.376 --> 02:13:49.084]  Now, let's shift gears to John Rappaport, and before I get into India, mass sterilization, and the London Guardian, Catholic bishops coming out saying they've caught the government sterilizing women in Kenya through vaccines.
[02:13:49.084 --> 02:13:59.870]  Before we get to all that, I wanted to raise this to John Rappaport, who's an investigative journalist, author, frequent contributor to InfoWars.com, the radio show on the nightly news.
[02:14:01.246 --> 02:14:07.116]  What do you make of the turning up of the heat now and all these government handouts all over the country?
[02:14:08.234 --> 02:14:16.716]  This is out of Fairfield, Connecticut, being handed out to second grade students that they must submit to the government, and the government gives them all their rights.
[02:14:16.716 --> 02:14:18.016]  I mean, this is Common Core.
[02:14:18.016 --> 02:14:21.997]  This is cult level, just showing us who runs this government.
[02:14:21.997 --> 02:14:23.257]  It's so premeditated.
[02:14:23.257 --> 02:14:29.498]  When we come face to face with tyranny, do we have the capacity to recognize it and say no?
[02:14:29.498 --> 02:14:32.099]  And then also under Common Core, this is out of the Egan News,
[02:14:33.146 --> 02:14:38.809]  Report, Chicago school teaches quote safe anal sex to fifth graders.
[02:14:38.809 --> 02:14:48.493]  A graphic sexual education curriculum for Chicago Public Schools fifth and sixth grade shock parents during a presentation given during report and pickup at Andrew Jackson Language Academy.
[02:14:48.493 --> 02:14:54.956]  The presentation includes slides that are clearly not age appropriate including demonstrations of applying male and female condoms.
[02:14:56.277 --> 02:15:17.726]  And it goes on, while CPS spokesman Bill McAfee said in a statement that this objectionable material presented at Andrew Jackson Language Academy this week is not and never was part of the sexual orientation curriculum, as reported at the local NBC affiliate, the slides show the parents are also posted at Walters Elementary School as part of sexual health education.
[02:15:17.726 --> 02:15:23.388]  Look, folks, we used to tell people ten years ago they were giving kids flu shots without consent.
[02:15:24.048 --> 02:15:29.133]  They would lie about it, then they'd say it was an accident, now from Alabama to California.
[02:15:29.133 --> 02:15:33.757]  Those two states just this month have been caught giving kids flu shots without consent.
[02:15:33.757 --> 02:15:35.098]  That's a felony.
[02:15:35.098 --> 02:15:38.702]  But they just do it.
[02:15:38.702 --> 02:15:42.045]  Are they attempting to overthrow reality?
[02:15:42.045 --> 02:15:44.367]  It seems their propaganda is backfiring on them.
[02:15:46.675 --> 02:15:49.337]  It seems it's not working, but they still keep doing it.
[02:15:49.337 --> 02:15:50.999]  Is there a method to the madness?
[02:15:50.999 --> 02:15:57.063]  Or has the establishment, insulated from real criticism and echo chambers, become delusional?
[02:15:57.063 --> 02:15:58.584]  We know elites go insane.
[02:15:58.584 --> 02:16:05.990]  There's a central global conspiracy, a program, that's public, but more and more I see it unraveling because their own operatives
[02:16:07.185 --> 02:16:14.593]  have been above the law and so they're outside of the free market of being punished and so they're becoming delusional.
[02:16:14.593 --> 02:16:17.977]  John Rappaport, you're a smart guy when it comes to PSYOPs.
[02:16:17.977 --> 02:16:19.218]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[02:16:19.218 --> 02:16:20.340]  What do you think's really going on?
[02:16:21.072 --> 02:16:23.674]  Yeah, I think they've gone crazy, Alex.
[02:16:23.674 --> 02:16:29.237]  I think we're looking at, you know, end-stage insanity here.
[02:16:29.237 --> 02:16:37.302]  The government commands you obey the rights that you have come from the government.
[02:16:37.302 --> 02:16:44.267]  I mean, that on the face of it is complete lunacy and it's a kind of, you know, we're entitled to tell you
[02:16:45.942 --> 02:17:08.292]  Where your rights come from, what you can do, what you can't do, there's nothing you can do about that, because we're immune, we're buffered off from any criticism, we've got the media under control, and then when this insane, you know, these sex programs, education programs in school, the one you just mentioned, the anal sex, you know, deal,
[02:17:08.932 --> 02:17:10.392]  They always deny this.
[02:17:10.392 --> 02:17:12.473]  I mean, I've seen this happen time and time again.
[02:17:12.473 --> 02:17:13.753]  We didn't put this up.
[02:17:13.753 --> 02:17:17.295]  This isn't really part of the system that we teach.
[02:17:17.295 --> 02:17:23.796]  And then they'll say, well, it's an optional program and it's actually funded by somebody else.
[02:17:23.796 --> 02:17:25.737]  They just keep tap dancing and lying.
[02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:27.718]  But the truth is, they're doing it.
[02:17:27.718 --> 02:17:28.938]  They're doing it all the time.
[02:17:29.558 --> 02:17:35.042]  And this is just, you know, these are mind control factories, these schools.
[02:17:35.042 --> 02:17:39.885]  And so the elites who have been running these programs forever,
[02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:44.872]  These programs in public schools are just now automatic.
[02:17:44.872 --> 02:17:53.438]  They just churn themselves out without any... Nobody has to make a phone call from high up to get them to do what they're going to do.
[02:17:53.438 --> 02:18:00.862]  They're just following their instructions from years and years ago, and they keep expanding this insanity.
[02:18:00.862 --> 02:18:02.864]  And nobody calls them on it.
[02:18:03.564 --> 02:18:05.185]  That's the problem.
[02:18:05.185 --> 02:18:16.292]  I mean, these parents at the Chicago schools should rise up unasked, march on the school, demand to talk to the principal, the head of the Board of Education,
[02:18:17.879 --> 02:18:20.921]  We want you to say why you put this in.
[02:18:20.921 --> 02:18:22.081]  Who told you to put it in?
[02:18:22.081 --> 02:18:22.441]  That's right.
[02:18:22.441 --> 02:18:25.243]  Let me throw this in because this is a great example.
[02:18:25.243 --> 02:18:31.706]  Gruber comes out now in five tapes and says he met with the president, developed the lies to rip everybody off.
[02:18:31.706 --> 02:18:36.989]  They use non-transparency and the public stupidness to get it done and it's making everybody upset.
[02:18:38.069 --> 02:18:39.150]  This is the attitude.
[02:18:39.150 --> 02:18:45.837]  But in these videos, in three of the five, he's teaching PhDs how things really work.
[02:18:45.837 --> 02:18:47.478]  That's why they have Delphi Technique.
[02:18:47.478 --> 02:18:52.943]  They send them to these training seminars to say there is no vaccine exemption form when they know it's there.
[02:18:52.943 --> 02:18:55.486]  To say we didn't shoot your kid up without your permission.
[02:18:55.486 --> 02:18:59.230]  To say we didn't teach your five-year-old how to have anal sex.
[02:18:59.770 --> 02:19:05.752]  They are just lying, as you said, and then the parents go to the next school and it's hanging on the wall!
[02:19:05.752 --> 02:19:13.536]  So again, that's what's so diabolical, is that they're teaching, right down to the grassroots, how to deceive everybody else.
[02:19:13.536 --> 02:19:16.337]  It is a massive criminal conspiracy.
[02:19:16.337 --> 02:19:17.677]  No question about it.
[02:19:17.677 --> 02:19:26.241]  And the only, I mean, the only vulnerability that exists at the level of children is when the parents stand up and refuse.
[02:19:27.546 --> 02:19:29.490]  Okay, here we are.
[02:19:29.490 --> 02:19:33.376]  600 parents knocking on your door, Mr. Principal.

[02:19:43.626 --> 02:19:47.047]  That's right, that's why they're training the kids with food worse than Supermax.
[02:19:47.047 --> 02:19:54.808]  Prison food, full of GMO, with the president's wife directing it, just to break their will and train them to be prisoners.
[02:19:54.808 --> 02:19:58.249]  This is the takedown of America by a culture of criminal scum.

[02:21:07.417 --> 02:21:11.580]  According to top insiders, the largest financial meltdown in history is coming.
[02:21:11.580 --> 02:21:15.884]  You can prepare, but if you're living paycheck to paycheck, how do you find the cash?
[02:21:15.884 --> 02:21:20.267]  If you're fortunate enough to have retirement savings, it's probably not enough.
[02:21:20.267 --> 02:21:24.010]  And if it's in the market, it could be wiped out just like the last crash.
[02:21:24.010 --> 02:21:26.993]  But this time it will almost certainly be much worse.

[02:23:35.504 --> 02:23:37.105]  And your rights are at risk.

[02:23:56.140 --> 02:23:56.981]  Come and take it.
[02:24:09.212 --> 02:24:10.793]  It's just, you can't do it.
[02:24:10.793 --> 02:24:11.194]  Politically.
[02:24:11.194 --> 02:24:12.775]  You just literally cannot do it.
[02:24:12.775 --> 02:24:13.295]  Okay?
[02:24:13.295 --> 02:24:14.616]  Transparent financing.
[02:24:14.616 --> 02:24:17.118]  And let's not just transparent financing, also transparent spending.
[02:24:17.118 --> 02:24:23.723]  I mean, this bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.
[02:24:23.723 --> 02:24:26.385]  If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.
[02:24:26.385 --> 02:24:26.885]  Okay?
[02:24:26.885 --> 02:24:28.286]  So it was written to do that.
[02:24:28.286 --> 02:24:36.873]  In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in, it made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed.
[02:24:37.549 --> 02:24:43.573]  Okay, just like people, lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[02:24:43.573 --> 02:24:46.896]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever.
[02:24:46.896 --> 02:24:47.256]  Alright.
[02:24:47.256 --> 02:24:53.601]  But basically, that was really... We're going to get into sterilization here in a minute, but this is important because it's the playing dumb.
[02:24:53.601 --> 02:25:02.727]  And what John Rappaport and I just got into, if you just tuned in, I'm your host Alex Jones, you're listening to InfoWars.
[02:25:02.727 --> 02:25:05.229]  Everywhere, they teach cops how to lie,
[02:25:06.769 --> 02:25:15.232]  They teach school teachers how to lie, they teach the school administrators how to lie, they teach the county how to lie, they teach the city how to lie, the state attorneys.
[02:25:15.232 --> 02:25:22.295]  I had one of the main state attorneys on for Maryland when they were saying, it's the law, all the kids have to have the shots.
[02:25:22.295 --> 02:25:24.015]  It was on CNN like six, seven years ago.
[02:25:24.015 --> 02:25:26.296]  They were going in crying to get shots at the courthouse.
[02:25:26.296 --> 02:25:29.798]  And I said, but there's a waiver because it's not a law, it's a school policy.
[02:25:29.798 --> 02:25:31.438]  You're supposed to give them the waiver.
[02:25:31.438 --> 02:25:32.479]  He goes, you ought to be a lawyer.
[02:25:32.479 --> 02:25:32.819]  You're right.
[02:25:32.819 --> 02:25:35.880]  The judge has those at his desk, but you've got to request one.
[02:25:36.775 --> 02:25:37.575]  And no one tells him.
[02:25:37.575 --> 02:25:38.656]  And I said, do you take vaccines?
[02:25:38.656 --> 02:25:39.777]  And he goes, no.
[02:25:39.777 --> 02:25:40.497]  Neither did my kids.
[02:25:40.497 --> 02:25:42.118]  I started laughing.
[02:25:42.118 --> 02:25:43.558]  Like, we were winners.
[02:25:43.558 --> 02:26:01.948]  He was laughing with me, on and off air, because we were laughing at all the people, with SWAT teams and police dogs, barking as they went into the courthouse, as this image of, you've got to take vaccines, so ignorant people watching TV would see that and believe they had to take shots.
[02:26:01.948 --> 02:26:05.209]  And it was mainly black people going in to be shot up in Maryland.
[02:26:05.209 --> 02:26:06.410]  There in Baltimore.
[02:26:08.004 --> 02:26:18.011]  And so what I'm getting at here is it's a culture of fraud and tyranny really is when organized crime and fraud takes over your government.
[02:26:18.011 --> 02:26:23.355]  And I'll say it again, I'm not bashing police because I found they're more awake on average than the general public.
[02:26:23.355 --> 02:26:26.157]  The military is very awake.
[02:26:26.157 --> 02:26:31.040]  So it's a natural ally at one level but also a very dangerous situation.
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:32.942]  But John, what I'm trying to get at here is
[02:26:34.887 --> 02:26:36.688]  It's amazing, just like the sterilization.
[02:26:36.688 --> 02:26:38.850]  It's in all the UN documents, the funding.
[02:26:38.850 --> 02:26:43.633]  They've been caught for 50 years over and over again doing it, giving people polio, spreading it.
[02:26:45.069 --> 02:26:49.032]  Shooting people up with SV40, sterilizing women with the tetanus shots.
[02:26:49.032 --> 02:26:50.373]  They just got caught again.
[02:26:50.373 --> 02:26:51.673]  You just wrote about it.
[02:26:51.673 --> 02:26:54.936]  But in the few minutes we've got in this short segment, speak to what I'm getting at.
[02:26:54.936 --> 02:26:56.537]  How do we articulate this to people?
[02:26:56.537 --> 02:27:00.980]  Because they call in and go, my school, you know, in Austin says it's the law.
[02:27:00.980 --> 02:27:02.881]  My kid will be kicked out and I'll be arrested.
[02:27:02.881 --> 02:27:06.483]  I go, they're going to use policy to kick them out and claim truancy.
[02:27:06.483 --> 02:27:09.806]  But the law doesn't say they can kick you out for no vaccine.
[02:27:09.806 --> 02:27:14.469]  They're fraudulently going to have the police come in and arrest you for the truancy.
[02:27:15.309 --> 02:27:26.039]  But they're not supposed to so it's fraud but the cop doesn't even know that themselves and neither will even the grand jury if it was to go to them if you don't plea bargain.
[02:27:26.039 --> 02:27:32.324]  I mean I used to actually go to these courts and warn people in the outside.
[02:27:32.324 --> 02:27:34.646]  I did this just a few times and then we get so upset.
[02:27:34.646 --> 02:27:41.092]  So what I'm saying is it's an organized crime deal but only the judge and only the school administrators know of the fraud.
[02:27:41.092 --> 02:27:41.873]  Isn't that incredible?
[02:27:42.556 --> 02:27:43.702]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:43.702 --> 02:27:45.834]  It's that incredible and more.
[02:27:45.834 --> 02:27:46.096]  I mean...
[02:27:47.128 --> 02:28:06.354]  Remember what Pelosi said about Obamacare, you know, you have to, we have to pass the legislation in order for you to be able to know what it says, which indicated, of course, what everybody knew, which was none of the congressmen who voted for it even knew what was in it, the thousands of pages.
[02:28:06.354 --> 02:28:12.576]  So when I, I heard this, you know, when I recovered from it, this was some time ago, I thought back to when I grew up.
[02:28:13.627 --> 02:28:25.512]  I mean, if the New York Times had printed on the front page, Congress passes law affecting all Americans without reading it, you know, that would have been a gigantic scandal.
[02:28:25.512 --> 02:28:26.893]  I mean, that would have never stopped.
[02:28:27.734 --> 02:28:43.865]  But drip by drip, drop by drop, the lying, the fraud becomes so embedded in public life, private life, everywhere, corporate life, that people don't even blink now when this guy Gruber says, well, of course we're not transparent.
[02:28:43.865 --> 02:28:46.607]  I mean, what idiot would be transparent?
[02:28:46.607 --> 02:28:49.208]  That's not the way to get a law passed.
[02:28:49.208 --> 02:28:51.190]  We live in a PR society.
[02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:54.152]  Everything is about public relations.
[02:28:54.152 --> 02:29:00.436]  And the public, unfortunately, has gotten used to that and accepts it to a tremendous degree.
[02:29:00.436 --> 02:29:05.539]  That people will say and do anything in order to achieve their objectives.
[02:29:05.539 --> 02:29:10.682]  And they say, well, of course, I mean, that's the way the world works, so who would think it'd be any different, you know?
[02:29:10.682 --> 02:29:12.704]  But of course it's different.
[02:29:12.704 --> 02:29:17.407]  I mean, as you say, this is organized crime all the way to the top.
[02:29:18.197 --> 02:29:21.465]  And people have to start rebelling against it.
[02:29:21.465 --> 02:29:23.429]  That is what wakes people up.
[02:29:23.429 --> 02:29:26.276]  Because if we wait too late, we'll be like Mexico or North Korea.
[02:29:26.276 --> 02:29:27.298]  Never get out of it.
[02:29:28.211 --> 02:29:30.953]  Because it'll just become so systematic.
[02:29:30.953 --> 02:29:32.294]  This is what destroys wealth.
[02:29:32.294 --> 02:29:34.375]  It's what destroys civilizations.
[02:29:34.375 --> 02:29:36.176]  And it's reached cuckoo level.
[02:29:36.176 --> 02:29:39.098]  You're gonna have the floor, John Rappaport, when we come back.
[02:29:39.098 --> 02:29:43.581]  Getting into the huge stories that you've been kind of collating.
[02:29:43.581 --> 02:29:47.384]  The admissions of the secret sterilization program worldwide.
[02:29:47.384 --> 02:29:47.824]  Stay with us.
[02:29:47.824 --> 02:29:49.205]  Wonder why you can't have a baby?
[02:29:49.205 --> 02:29:50.246]  Take your shots.
[02:29:59.912 --> 02:30:06.315]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[02:30:06.315 --> 02:30:07.375]  It has changed my life.
[02:30:07.375 --> 02:30:09.476]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[02:30:09.476 --> 02:30:10.977]  Counting the weights, staying in shape.
[02:30:10.977 --> 02:30:13.058]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:13.058 --> 02:30:14.999]  You've heard the callers to the show.
[02:30:14.999 --> 02:30:19.001]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[02:30:19.001 --> 02:30:20.982]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[02:30:20.982 --> 02:30:23.643]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[02:30:23.763 --> 02:30:41.678]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shields, Oxy Powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:41.678 --> 02:30:47.282]  Dash 2, just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.
[02:30:47.282 --> 02:30:48.123]  It's great stuff.
[02:30:48.183 --> 02:30:49.105]  I'm gonna promote something.
[02:30:49.105 --> 02:30:52.131]  It's gotta be something I personally use and that I believe in.

[02:31:19.658 --> 02:31:22.579]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:31:22.779 --> 02:31:23.400]  I think so.
[02:31:37.756 --> 02:31:37.996]  We're good.
[02:32:00.097 --> 02:32:01.358]  Another major health threat.
[02:32:01.358 --> 02:32:06.342]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:32:06.342 --> 02:32:09.024]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:32:09.024 --> 02:32:16.069]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:32:16.069 --> 02:32:19.071]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:32:19.071 --> 02:32:22.013]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:32:22.013 --> 02:32:24.035]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:32:24.035 --> 02:32:26.857]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:32:26.937 --> 02:32:32.679]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.

[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:20.941]  Welcome back, I'm your host...
[02:33:24.275 --> 02:33:27.979]  Ferguson cop rapes woman in jail lawsuit claims.
[02:33:27.979 --> 02:33:31.802]  This just went live on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:33:31.802 --> 02:33:39.770]  Lawsuit comes at the worst possible time as protesters stage in Ferguson.
[02:33:39.770 --> 02:33:42.112]  Or protesters mass in Ferguson, Missouri.
[02:33:43.627 --> 02:33:51.255]  A pregnant woman says she was raped in jail by a Ferguson police officer last October, according to a federal lawsuit filed Friday.
[02:33:51.255 --> 02:34:00.424]  The woman, JW, in her initials on the suit, was stopped by the accused officer, Jaris Hayden, on October 13th because her license plates were expired.
[02:34:00.424 --> 02:34:05.129]  She should have just been illegally let her go, and Hayden arrested her after she gave a false name.
[02:34:06.533 --> 02:34:08.014]  You smell good, J.W.
[02:34:08.014 --> 02:34:11.155]  claims Officer Hayden said to her during her booking.
[02:34:11.155 --> 02:34:12.856]  This will teach you a lesson.
[02:34:12.856 --> 02:34:13.356]  J.W.'
[02:34:13.336 --> 02:34:21.759]  's boyfriend eventually posted her bond, but Officer Hayden said she still had a traffic warrants for other cities.
[02:34:21.759 --> 02:34:22.580]  And then it goes on.
[02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:26.622]  In exchange for securing her release, Officer Hayden took J.W.
[02:34:26.622 --> 02:34:29.663]  to a boiler room and proceeded to have sex with her.
[02:34:31.348 --> 02:34:34.390]  And she did not resist out of fear, according to the lawsuit.
[02:34:34.390 --> 02:34:42.916]  The suit also claims that Officer Hayden led her to a side room and told her to stay close to the building when leaving to presumably stay out of the sight of security cameras.
[02:34:42.916 --> 02:34:48.699]  JW went to the hospital afterwards and DNA tests confirmed pubic hair on her body from Hayden.
[02:34:48.699 --> 02:34:50.281]  Looks bad, according to the lawsuit.
[02:34:51.261 --> 02:34:53.282]  Lawyers will put stuff in lawsuits that aren't true, though.
[02:34:53.282 --> 02:34:56.944]  I'm not saying it isn't true, I'm just saying I don't believe anything I see these days.
[02:34:56.944 --> 02:35:05.068]  The conduct of the city of Ferguson law enforcement in engaging in repeated acts of violence and constitutional violations against the citizens constitutes a pattern, a lawsuit says.
[02:35:05.068 --> 02:35:09.970]  The lawsuit comes at a poor time for the city, as protests are expected to riot in response
[02:35:11.937 --> 02:35:19.742]  To the jury decision on whether to indict Officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown during altercation.
[02:35:19.742 --> 02:35:23.765]  Great job churning this out just as it breaks, Kit Daniels.
[02:35:23.765 --> 02:35:37.974]  But we might just add the point here that thugs are planning to use protest as cover to riot and delegitimize, because we just say protesters are expected to riot.
[02:35:37.974 --> 02:35:39.615]  I know that's what the media says, but
[02:35:41.513 --> 02:35:43.814]  We don't have time to edit stuff here on air and I'm trying to.
[02:35:43.814 --> 02:35:46.796]  They've got a great team that has to do all this out openly on the air.
[02:35:46.796 --> 02:35:49.637]  Ferguson cop rapes woman in jail lawsuit claims.
[02:35:49.637 --> 02:35:56.561]  Lawsuit comes at worst possible time as protesters mass, I guess stage is the word in Ferguson.
[02:35:56.561 --> 02:35:57.382]  Good report there.
[02:35:57.382 --> 02:36:00.263]  We'll see what happens from it.
[02:36:00.263 --> 02:36:05.206]  You know, I wouldn't believe stuff like this if so many cops weren't pleading guilty to raping women.
[02:36:06.218 --> 02:36:10.722]  And the old thing is, you know, cops pull up by the topless bar and the dancers leave it too.
[02:36:10.722 --> 02:36:16.326]  Pull them over and say, look, you know, give me oral sex and I won't take you in for DWI.
[02:36:16.326 --> 02:36:17.667]  I don't know if this guy's guilty or not.
[02:36:17.667 --> 02:36:18.628]  It's just a lawsuit.
[02:36:18.628 --> 02:36:22.011]  I also know criminals lie a lot.
[02:36:22.011 --> 02:36:28.756]  It's amazing how people in this world of fraud think making something up gives them power.
[02:36:28.756 --> 02:36:33.220]  And so when you've had people make stuff up about you, you name it.
[02:36:33.220 --> 02:36:35.442]  You just start to like want to see some proof.
[02:36:36.718 --> 02:36:44.484]  And I want to see it from cops, when they say something about me, and I want to see them people say something about them.
[02:36:44.484 --> 02:36:50.309]  So, it's what Rappaport was just getting into, the corruption of society.
[02:36:50.309 --> 02:36:52.051]  This is what brought Mexico down.
[02:36:52.051 --> 02:36:56.434]  It's what's bringing Latin America and Asia down, and the Middle East down.
[02:36:56.434 --> 02:37:04.160]  They're not economies based on honor, based on doing business with folks that you can do
[02:37:05.225 --> 02:37:25.245]  Handshake deal with people think I think half the public if you're nice to them don't Be mean to them treat them good with respect That you're there to be fed on you're there to be pushed around you're there to be used and you know that they get an advantage By screwing somebody well you might the first couple times we end up dying alone you end up being alone
[02:37:26.141 --> 02:37:33.263]  And I just think my lucky star is every day that I am part of a culture of honorable people and folks that don't backstab and play games.
[02:37:33.263 --> 02:37:40.724]  And so many people are sociopathic now, where they think that if they can screw you over, that's winning.
[02:37:40.724 --> 02:37:49.686]  Even though a real sociopath would know being honorable long term is actually the best way to be successful.
[02:37:49.686 --> 02:37:52.647]  I was always honorable because that's how I was raised and my genetics.
[02:37:53.629 --> 02:38:01.252]  That's why they always attack my honor in the media, because they want to say I'm dishonorable, because they know my greatest attribute is that I am honorable.
[02:38:01.252 --> 02:38:06.253]  So to young people out there, staying out of the system is winning.
[02:38:06.253 --> 02:38:16.117]  Becoming independent, that means wealthy, even if it's middle class or just working class, if you own your own business, your own house, you don't have to answer to anybody, you're successful.
[02:38:19.130 --> 02:38:20.251]  It's the gang mentality.
[02:38:20.251 --> 02:38:22.032]  Rappaport, I'm ranting here.
[02:38:22.032 --> 02:38:28.017]  Give me your comment on what I just said about that, and then I want to get into the sterilization.
[02:38:28.017 --> 02:38:31.380]  I see it at all levels, Alex, just like we're discussing here.
[02:38:31.380 --> 02:38:40.348]  As you say, how can I take advantage of the situation in order to lie, cheat, steal, commit fraud?
[02:38:41.826 --> 02:38:43.148]  It's just one giant.
[02:38:43.148 --> 02:38:44.890]  I mean, talk about the melting pot.
[02:38:44.890 --> 02:38:55.545]  That's what this country keeps on becoming over and over in bigger and bigger terms at every level is the fraud getting over on people.
[02:38:56.607 --> 02:39:00.028]  The sociopathic behavior, etc, etc.
[02:39:00.028 --> 02:39:07.411]  You see it at every single possible level, from the biggest down to the smallest.
[02:39:07.411 --> 02:39:10.613]  And somewhere this is learned behavior.
[02:39:10.613 --> 02:39:15.035]  I mean, because we don't have 100% sociopaths in this country.
[02:39:15.035 --> 02:39:17.436]  I mean, this is more, this is a culture.
[02:39:17.436 --> 02:39:18.216]  This is learned.
[02:39:18.937 --> 02:39:20.179]  This is understood.
[02:39:20.179 --> 02:39:21.701]  It's learned through television.
[02:39:21.701 --> 02:39:23.103]  It's learned through schools.
[02:39:23.103 --> 02:39:24.825]  It's learned through parents.
[02:39:24.825 --> 02:39:30.373]  It's learned through institutions of society and government, especially.
[02:39:30.373 --> 02:39:35.280]  Because if a person experiences the intrusion of government on their life,
[02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:48.146]  In a completely illegal fraudulent way and goes through that experience and understands even a little bit of how it feels from that point on that person is going to be changed.
[02:39:48.146 --> 02:39:50.549]  They're not going to be the same person.
[02:39:50.549 --> 02:39:52.712]  So we see it everywhere and.
[02:39:53.792 --> 02:39:59.776]  You know, the only solution to it is, as you say, to work in an honorable way.
[02:39:59.776 --> 02:40:02.598]  Because when you do, people recognize that.
[02:40:02.598 --> 02:40:03.899]  They understand.
[02:40:03.899 --> 02:40:04.639]  This is different.
[02:40:04.639 --> 02:40:06.160]  This is what I want.
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:08.302]  This is what I thought America was.
[02:40:08.302 --> 02:40:10.383]  This is where I'll put my allegiance.
[02:40:10.383 --> 02:40:14.086]  Not with these other maniacs.
[02:40:14.086 --> 02:40:15.446]  Will we ever hit a bottom?
[02:40:15.446 --> 02:40:22.091]  I mean, is there no level of Obama people making fun of us, laughing at us, calling us stupid?
[02:40:22.091 --> 02:40:23.352]  How far can they go?
[02:40:25.077 --> 02:40:26.698]  I don't think there is any bottom.
[02:40:26.698 --> 02:40:36.005]  I think, like everything else that counts, we're talking about grassroots revolution.
[02:40:36.005 --> 02:40:47.334]  A revolution in which people stand up in every possible way for principles, regardless of what other people say about them, regardless of what other people do.
[02:40:49.074 --> 02:40:56.282]  And there's something, fortunately, that's very contagious about that when people see it happening.
[02:40:56.282 --> 02:40:58.124]  You've come across these stories.
[02:40:58.124 --> 02:41:02.489]  You know, somebody defends their home against an intruder.
[02:41:02.489 --> 02:41:04.771]  Successfully.
[02:41:04.771 --> 02:41:05.572]  Legally.
[02:41:05.572 --> 02:41:06.072]  With a gun.
[02:41:07.145 --> 02:41:09.026]  Somebody is growing their own food.
[02:41:09.026 --> 02:41:12.048]  Somebody is standing up for what's right.
[02:41:12.048 --> 02:41:16.151]  And all of a sudden, a huge number of people say, that's right.
[02:41:16.151 --> 02:41:19.413]  This is what we thought America was supposed to be.
[02:41:19.413 --> 02:41:26.357]  So the more of that we can see, the better the chances that, you know, we win.
[02:41:26.357 --> 02:41:31.840]  But as far as how low those other guys will sink, there's no bottom.
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:32.701]  There is no bottom.
[02:41:33.832 --> 02:41:47.356]  Until they go from smart criminal conspirators, but still evil, to delusional nutcases that think they can burn down half the city because they want to expand their palace, aka Nero.
[02:41:47.356 --> 02:41:48.017]  Exactly.
[02:41:48.017 --> 02:41:52.258]  When that happens, then they, you know, then they've committed suicide.
[02:41:52.258 --> 02:41:54.339]  And, you know, that's going to happen.
[02:41:54.339 --> 02:41:55.619]  It's already starting to happen.
[02:41:55.999 --> 02:42:01.822]  Why do elites, whether it's Hitler or Stalin, we know Stalin was poisoned, why do they always push till they fail?
[02:42:01.822 --> 02:42:08.705]  If Hitler would have stopped at just Poland and Czechoslovakia and Austria, he was going to be left alone.
[02:42:08.705 --> 02:42:21.872]  Then he goes and gets France, attacks England, declares war on the U.S., and then turns against the Russians, you know, 170 million of them, that in a whole bunch of wars and never give up.
[02:42:22.824 --> 02:42:28.568]  I mean, I don't know what he was thinking when his big hero, Napoleon, got defeated by him.
[02:42:28.568 --> 02:42:30.650]  Bismarck couldn't beat him.
[02:42:30.650 --> 02:42:32.271]  I mean, imagine somebody trying to invade America.
[02:42:32.271 --> 02:42:35.453]  You can only do it from within, the way we're seeing, and opening the borders up.
[02:42:35.453 --> 02:42:37.175]  You couldn't do it the other way.
[02:42:37.175 --> 02:42:39.136]  So I give the Globalist that.
[02:42:39.136 --> 02:42:48.303]  I mean, why is it that evil elites always, who show that they're genius early on, go crazy and do things that destroy them?
[02:42:48.303 --> 02:42:49.364]  I think it's because
[02:42:50.660 --> 02:43:08.326]  You can't turn back when you've committed a certain amount of evil, because in order to turn back or stop what you're doing, you have to admit that there's another way, that there's another viewpoint, that there's a thing called right and a thing called wrong.
[02:43:08.326 --> 02:43:12.928]  That's what tortures these psychopaths, that if they were to stop,
[02:43:14.045 --> 02:43:18.507]  They would have to think and reflect and realize what they've done.
[02:43:18.507 --> 02:43:26.032]  So they just give in to this contagion of evil and they do insane things and then they destroy themselves.
[02:43:26.032 --> 02:43:33.296]  They can't stop because to stop is eventually to admit and understand what you've done.
[02:43:33.296 --> 02:43:38.058]  That's why they just don't ever stop until somebody stops them.
[02:43:38.058 --> 02:43:39.139]  Well, that's right.
[02:43:39.139 --> 02:43:39.259]  And
[02:43:40.903 --> 02:43:44.305]  21 million Germans died in World War II.
[02:43:44.305 --> 02:43:46.146]  That's more than a third of their population.
[02:43:46.146 --> 02:43:48.427]  There were about 75 million when the war started.
[02:43:48.427 --> 02:43:51.209]  There were less than 55 million when it was over.
[02:43:51.209 --> 02:43:54.330]  Conversely, 22 million Russians died in that war.
[02:43:54.330 --> 02:43:59.453]  Folks, you need to understand that when politicians go crazy, this is where it leads.
[02:43:59.453 --> 02:44:02.995]  And I'm seeing the exact type of crazy-eyed nuttiness.
[02:44:04.059 --> 02:44:13.125]  Out of our elites, and I've studied our previous elites, Eisenhower, people before him, they had their own issues, but they were not as delusional.
[02:44:13.125 --> 02:44:19.309]  They had been in frontline combat in World War I. They had been in real-world events.
[02:44:19.309 --> 02:44:21.231]  They'd been on the boxing club.
[02:44:21.231 --> 02:44:23.072]  They'd been sharecroppers.
[02:44:23.072 --> 02:44:28.536]  They'd been... Now the elites are so insulated and so weak, when I look at Gruber and people,
[02:44:29.645 --> 02:44:37.433]  That it really gives me a sick feeling to realize that our leadership is a bunch of soft trash.
[02:44:37.433 --> 02:44:48.704]  Remember that famous statement of Madeleine Albright's between the two wars in Iraq when she was asked, well you know the sanctions against Iraq have killed 500,000 children in Iraq.
[02:44:51.024 --> 02:44:52.465]  Do you think that's worth it?
[02:44:52.465 --> 02:44:56.828]  And she sat there on 60 Minutes and said, you know, yes, I do.
[02:44:56.828 --> 02:44:58.770]  I think it really was.
[02:44:58.770 --> 02:45:00.611]  It's a tough call.
[02:45:00.611 --> 02:45:02.092]  But yes, it's worth it.
[02:45:02.092 --> 02:45:07.917]  I mean, that's, you know, how much more sociopathic can you get?
[02:45:07.917 --> 02:45:10.479]  And how much more insulated can you get?
[02:45:11.334 --> 02:45:17.595]  Then to be sitting in some high perch somewhere making a decision that's going to kill half a million kids.
[02:45:17.595 --> 02:45:25.377]  Remember George Soros did 60 Minutes and admitted he helped Hitler and helped round up thousands and said he felt no guilt for it.
[02:45:25.377 --> 02:45:26.997]  There you go.
[02:45:26.997 --> 02:45:29.958]  I mean why would he go on TV and say I feel no guilt?
[02:45:29.958 --> 02:45:33.618]  I mean I just you know.
[02:45:33.618 --> 02:45:39.780]  Yeah I mean that's like asking you know why is a lunatic a lunatic?
[02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:40.840]  He can't turn back.
[02:45:41.857 --> 02:45:45.119]  You know, I mean, how much more wealthy does he want to get?
[02:45:45.119 --> 02:45:46.760]  He's still manipulating markets.
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:49.822]  He's still going after more money and more money.
[02:45:49.822 --> 02:45:50.222]  Why?
[02:45:50.222 --> 02:45:58.326]  He has, you know, he could live 50 lifetimes at least on the wealth he's accumulated already.
[02:45:58.326 --> 02:45:59.527]  Because he can't stop.
[02:45:59.527 --> 02:46:11.074]  Because if he were to stop and engage in real conversation with people and actually meet some genuine people outside his elite circles, he would begin to fathom
[02:46:12.344 --> 02:46:14.885]  How evil he is.
[02:46:14.885 --> 02:46:16.666]  He just has to keep on going.
[02:46:16.666 --> 02:46:17.466]  That's right.
[02:46:17.466 --> 02:46:23.949]  They're a bunch of insulated super elites who hate the middle class and new wealth, who are believing their own BS.
[02:46:23.949 --> 02:46:26.570]  And I'm just here to tell you guys, you're going down.
[02:46:26.570 --> 02:46:28.431]  Everybody knows who's done it.
[02:46:28.431 --> 02:46:32.172]  I don't care you got half the public not knowing their name or finding their butt with both hands.
[02:46:32.172 --> 02:46:34.974]  A large minority worldwide knows who you are.
[02:46:34.974 --> 02:46:36.514]  You're going to be brought to justice.
[02:46:36.514 --> 02:46:38.035]  We're coming for you.
[02:46:38.035 --> 02:46:40.436]  So I would suggest for your kids and grandkids future,
[02:46:41.513 --> 02:46:45.717]  You back off now instead of threatening to destroy the whole planet in the process.
[02:46:45.717 --> 02:46:46.718]  Now let's shift gears.
[02:46:46.718 --> 02:46:52.043]  They look at the giant third world with disdain and want to reduce their population because they see them as a plague living on their property.
[02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:59.682]  John, certainly if you've been to Calcutta or Mexico City, there are too many people in certain areas, but we've done the population actuary.
[02:46:59.682 --> 02:47:02.483]  If you don't have two kids for every two adults, things collapse.
[02:47:02.483 --> 02:47:06.685]  Population will plane off at about 9 billion, all the actuaries show.
[02:47:06.685 --> 02:47:10.046]  There are some problems with dirty technology, but we're cleaning it up.
[02:47:10.046 --> 02:47:12.867]  But regardless of that debate, you can correct me if you don't agree with that,
[02:47:13.789 --> 02:47:15.110]  We can't have the U.N.
[02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:21.774]  running around putting sterilants in the tetanus shot and in live polio, clearly in a population reduction program.
[02:47:21.774 --> 02:47:27.418]  But even if the yuppies are for that, and some deep-seated, you know, greed that, well, there's less people, I get more.
[02:47:29.403 --> 02:47:36.365]  They're doing it also to us here as well with weaker compounds so it's not as noticeable in the soft kill.
[02:47:36.365 --> 02:47:37.886]  Get into your report on this.
[02:47:37.886 --> 02:47:45.908]  It's at nomorefakenews.com and infowars.com that we put up last week, breaking all of this down.
[02:47:45.908 --> 02:47:48.789]  Depopulation vaccine in Kenya and beyond.
[02:47:48.789 --> 02:47:53.110]  We've now got major scientists and Catholic bishops going public.
[02:47:53.110 --> 02:47:54.530]  Yeah, they're going public.
[02:47:54.530 --> 02:47:55.911]  And basically what it is,
[02:47:57.168 --> 02:48:16.223]  It is one of the more primitive research tools of the depopulation gang, which means Rockefeller Fund, World Health Organization, the United Nations, so beloved on the left, the Population Council.
[02:48:16.223 --> 02:48:21.567]  Rockefeller, money is everywhere in this and has been for 50 years, more.
[02:48:23.886 --> 02:48:37.215]  HCG, which is a hormone that assists in maintaining pregnancy, has been put into vaccines in Kenya, it was done in the Philippines and other places.
[02:48:37.215 --> 02:48:43.440]  The body, woman's body reacts by treating it as an invader, as a disease entity.
[02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:59.417]  And tries to destroy it so that when later on she gets pregnant, she's going to have a miscarriage because she treats that sustaining life-giving hormone as if it were a virus or some other kind of germ.
[02:48:59.417 --> 02:49:05.801]  In my article, which people can read, I indicate the studies that have been done, where they were done, when they were done.
[02:49:05.801 --> 02:49:06.961]  The UN admits they did this.
[02:49:06.961 --> 02:49:07.622]  For those who don't know,
[02:49:08.547 --> 02:49:09.808]  Yeah, that's the horrible part of it.
[02:49:09.808 --> 02:49:10.409]  And that's just one
[02:49:29.472 --> 02:49:32.774]  Way to depopulate people medically.
[02:49:32.774 --> 02:49:36.597]  I mean, there are chemicals there, of course, operation surgeries.
[02:49:36.597 --> 02:49:41.480]  We've just been reading about one that went horribly wrong.
[02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:47.584]  And there are there is, you know, research ongoing all the time on how to introduce
[02:49:48.530 --> 02:49:52.976]  Anti-fertility and sterility compounds into vaccines.
[02:49:52.976 --> 02:49:54.598]  Standard vaccine programs.
[02:49:54.598 --> 02:49:58.984]  I mean, these are not esoteric, sneaked in the middle of the night.
[02:49:58.984 --> 02:50:03.631]  These are your regular, you know, CDC type vaccine programs.
[02:50:04.211 --> 02:50:09.936]  This is a long-term depopulation agenda that's been going on forever.
[02:50:09.936 --> 02:50:14.659]  And a reader wrote me who talked to some doctor who tried to poo-poo the whole thing.
[02:50:14.659 --> 02:50:20.784]  And this incredible idiot doctor was trying to say that how could this even happen?
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:25.262]  Because HCG is a natural hormone in the body.
[02:50:25.262 --> 02:50:27.083]  How could... I mean, it doesn't even make sense.
[02:50:27.083 --> 02:50:28.123]  They bind it to tetanus.
[02:50:28.123 --> 02:50:29.123]  It's declassified.
[02:50:29.123 --> 02:50:29.684]  The U.N.
[02:50:29.684 --> 02:50:31.084]  admitted it in 96.
[02:50:31.084 --> 02:50:32.285]  They just got caught again.
[02:50:32.285 --> 02:50:36.567]  This doctor's ignorance doesn't trump that we're informed.
[02:50:36.567 --> 02:50:38.208]  No, of course not.
[02:50:38.208 --> 02:50:44.030]  The doctors will always say that because they don't want to start looking at their own vaccine programs.
[02:50:44.030 --> 02:50:45.591]  I mean, all you have to do
[02:50:46.636 --> 02:50:51.118]  You say to a mother, we're going to indoculate your kid with toxic chemicals and a lot of germs.
[02:50:51.118 --> 02:50:53.139]  Is that okay with you?
[02:50:53.139 --> 02:50:55.520]  And if you put it that way, she would say, of course not.
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:55.981]  That's right.
[02:50:55.981 --> 02:50:57.041]  John Rebenford, stay there.
[02:50:57.041 --> 02:50:59.182]  Powerful info.

[02:51:26.331 --> 02:51:31.654]  Are you ready to surrender your right to buy body armor?
[02:51:31.654 --> 02:51:32.434]  No joke.
[02:51:32.434 --> 02:51:35.115]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[02:51:35.115 --> 02:51:36.396]  And if House Bill HR
[02:51:36.616 --> 02:51:42.198]  If 5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.
[02:51:42.198 --> 02:51:45.018]  Don't put off your body armor purchase any longer.

[02:51:55.521 --> 02:51:56.962]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:51:56.962 --> 02:51:58.082]  Just won't quit.
[02:51:58.522 --> 02:52:04.907]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[02:52:04.907 --> 02:52:05.968]  It has changed my life.
[02:52:05.968 --> 02:52:07.970]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[02:52:07.970 --> 02:52:09.571]  I'm in the weight-staining shape.
[02:52:09.571 --> 02:52:12.113]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:52:12.113 --> 02:52:13.574]  You've heard the callers of the show.
[02:52:13.574 --> 02:52:17.537]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[02:52:17.537 --> 02:52:19.519]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[02:52:19.519 --> 02:52:22.181]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[02:52:22.261 --> 02:52:39.743]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shields, Oxy Powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[02:52:40.163 --> 02:52:41.865]  There's two.
[02:52:41.865 --> 02:52:45.708]  Just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.
[02:52:45.708 --> 02:52:46.468]  It's great stuff.
[02:52:46.468 --> 02:52:50.571]  If I'm going to promote something, it's got to be something I personally use and that I believe in.
[02:52:50.571 --> 02:52:57.317]  Check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[02:52:58.086 --> 02:53:02.272]  There may be a hidden danger lurking in our homes and surroundings.
[02:53:02.272 --> 02:53:05.035]  Without the right equipment, you'll never know it's there.
[02:53:05.035 --> 02:53:12.786]  Natural and man-made nuclear radiation can find its way into our living environment, and maser instruments are your best line of defense.
[02:53:13.166 --> 02:53:22.239]  Unlike lower-cost products, Maser Instruments detects all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays.
[02:53:22.239 --> 02:53:28.028]  Most products require you manually turn them on for each use, but Maser Instruments are different.
[02:53:28.769 --> 02:53:29.289]  We're good.
[02:54:00.891 --> 02:54:06.713]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:06.713 --> 02:54:09.074]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:09.074 --> 02:54:20.839]  It'll be ready to ship Friday from South Texas, the laboratory where it's been developed.
[02:54:20.839 --> 02:54:22.179]  We'll have it next week.
[02:54:22.179 --> 02:54:28.522]  For all intents and purposes, we're not sold out of Secret 12, the proprietary, super organic,
[02:54:29.697 --> 02:54:32.739]  It's sold out faster than anything we've ever had.
[02:55:00.515 --> 02:55:06.256]  We already, they were late shipping us the whole shipment, so some of it's getting labeled right now.
[02:55:06.256 --> 02:55:16.279]  That hasn't come in yet, but it'll be in either this week or next week, so essentially you can still order it, but this will be it for 2014, barring a miracle.
[02:55:16.279 --> 02:55:18.779]  We might get some, you know, right around Christmas, I doubt it.
[02:55:18.779 --> 02:55:20.660]  We're looking first week, second week of January.
[02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:22.461]  Uh, to get it.
[02:55:22.461 --> 02:55:25.464]  Survival Shield X2 is selling out, will sell out within a week.
[02:55:25.464 --> 02:55:27.206]  That's the proprietary nascent iodine.
[02:55:27.206 --> 02:55:32.891]  The Oxy Powder, we have enough of that for another week or so, but it already sold out for a week or so earlier.
[02:55:32.891 --> 02:55:34.153]  And that flushes the guts out.
[02:55:34.153 --> 02:55:36.275]  DNA Force is close to selling out.
[02:55:36.275 --> 02:55:38.517]  Super Male Vitality is close to selling out.
[02:55:38.517 --> 02:55:40.218]  Super Female Vitality, we got plenty of that.
[02:55:41.213 --> 02:55:46.100]  Uh, the, uh, Survival Shield, uh, biodefense pack, 10% off, still going on that.
[02:55:46.100 --> 02:55:47.542]  That'll end Thursday.
[02:55:47.542 --> 02:55:53.730]  With the Survival Shield X2, the Occupower, got plenty of that because it just came in last week after six weeks of being sold out.
[02:55:53.730 --> 02:55:55.112]  Almost sold out of Lung Cleanze.
[02:55:56.053 --> 02:56:00.836]  Almost sold out of Fluoride Shield, and your purchase supports the broadcast InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:56:00.836 --> 02:56:07.760]  So you're going to hear me plug in t-shirts and books and videos at InfoWarsStore.com soon, because everything's going to be sold out.
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:12.123]  And we're just trying to capitalize so we can get more of the quality products that fund the operation.
[02:56:12.123 --> 02:56:13.664]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:56:13.664 --> 02:56:17.086]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:56:17.086 --> 02:56:20.228]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:56:20.228 --> 02:56:23.070]  But it's word of mouth on these products is why they're selling so well.
[02:56:23.590 --> 02:56:29.592]  I mean, these things are the Rolls Royce or the Bentley at a Ford, you know, LTD price.
[02:56:29.592 --> 02:56:31.093]  So thank you all for your support.
[02:56:31.093 --> 02:56:35.254]  John, we're doing five minutes of overdrive because I cut you short getting into other topics.
[02:56:35.254 --> 02:56:40.256]  In your article, you link to mainstream news in Europe where you got major Catholic bishops and scientists.
[02:56:40.256 --> 02:56:42.637]  I mean, they're looking at it, they're catching them.
[02:56:45.205 --> 02:56:55.035]  Just ignoring this isn't going to protect them when, you know, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gives a million kids the polio vaccine and 64,000 get paralyzed, 3,000 die.
[02:56:55.035 --> 02:56:57.118]  I mean, they can't cover this up anymore.
[02:56:57.836 --> 02:57:07.280]  No, and this is one of the most vital movements really on the planet is people understanding what vaccines are really doing.
[02:57:07.280 --> 02:57:15.544]  I mean, there are many, many people on the planet, groups, individuals, what have you, mothers of autistic children and so forth.
[02:57:15.544 --> 02:57:16.545]  They know the score.
[02:57:17.325 --> 02:57:19.386]  There's no fooling them.
[02:57:19.386 --> 02:57:31.688]  This is one of these issues where tremendous advance is being made, regardless of what the doctors are saying, regardless of the propaganda and the hype from the CDC.
[02:57:31.688 --> 02:57:46.352]  So in this case, you had, you know, some Catholic, a handful of Catholic prelates who got vials of this vaccine in Kenya, sent it to different independent labs, and they all came back with a verdict.
[02:57:47.032 --> 02:57:48.935]  Okay, there's HCG in here.
[02:57:48.935 --> 02:57:52.661]  This is an anti-fertility vaccine.
[02:57:52.661 --> 02:57:55.866]  And the government down there is trying to pretend nothing is happening.
[02:57:55.866 --> 02:57:58.691]  Nothing ever did happen.
[02:57:58.691 --> 02:58:00.594]  Let's bring it out into the open.
[02:58:00.594 --> 02:58:02.016]  Let's bring it all out into the open.
[02:58:03.146 --> 02:58:06.027]  And see that this has been going on for 50 years.
[02:58:06.027 --> 02:58:07.068]  There's nothing new here.
[02:58:07.068 --> 02:58:13.670]  What's new is possibly the numbers of women who have been vaccinated.
[02:58:13.670 --> 02:58:14.510]  Over a million.
[02:58:14.510 --> 02:58:16.751]  Maybe three million.
[02:58:16.751 --> 02:58:19.792]  Which makes it incredible ongoing crime.
[02:58:19.792 --> 02:58:20.993]  And that's just one vaccine.
[02:58:20.993 --> 02:58:31.697]  We have the HPV vaccine for supposedly cervical cancer being given to women worldwide and being causing infertility, death, autoimmune disorders, and now Bill Gates wants to put it in the food.
[02:58:32.777 --> 02:58:34.440]  Where you can't escape it.
[02:58:34.440 --> 02:58:36.424]  We'll be right back at 70 Seconds in Overdrive.
[02:58:36.424 --> 02:58:37.406]  Everybody else, goodbye.
[02:58:37.406 --> 02:58:40.110]  See you on the Nightly News tonight at 7 o'clock Central.

[02:59:02.058 --> 02:59:09.002]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest
[02:59:09.002 --> 02:59:09.222]  I think?
[02:59:25.481 --> 02:59:29.283]  Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shield, Oxy Powder.
[02:59:29.283 --> 02:59:40.107]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[02:59:40.107 --> 02:59:51.973]  Folks, check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[02:59:51.973 --> 02:59:54.594]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.827 --> 03:00:13.369]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:13.369 --> 03:00:20.936]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:20.936 --> 03:00:29.063]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:29.063 --> 03:00:30.785]  In fact, they came in and gave it to me earlier.
[03:00:30.785 --> 03:00:31.386]  Here it is.
[03:00:31.386 --> 03:00:32.427]  AP Impact.
[03:00:32.427 --> 03:00:34.769]  Vaccine court keeps claimants waiting.
[03:00:36.314 --> 03:00:46.860]  Back in the 70s, they created the secret vaccine court, expanded it in the 80s, and they cover up all people that get killed or die for the vaccine when they, you know, you drop dead right there, they have to pay it out.
[03:00:46.860 --> 03:00:56.164]  An AP read hundreds of decisions, conducted more than 200 interviews, and analyzed a database of more than 14,500 cases filed in a special vaccine court.
[03:00:56.164 --> 03:00:58.306]  That database was current as of 2013.
[03:00:58.306 --> 03:01:04.489]  The government has refused to release an updated version since, and they will not pay when people win.
[03:01:06.414 --> 03:01:11.217]  So see, government just, and I think there's $4 billion in the fund of taxpayer money.
[03:01:11.217 --> 03:01:13.358]  They won't even, why not?
[03:01:13.358 --> 03:01:14.719]  It's just criminal.
[03:01:14.719 --> 03:01:16.120]  It's rule by the gun.
[03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:18.561]  John Rappaport, you've got the floor for the last four minutes.
[03:01:18.561 --> 03:01:19.922]  Where do you see all this going?
[03:01:19.922 --> 03:01:30.328]  Okay, so first of all, with this vaccine court, the government compensation system, people have to realize you can't sue the vaccine maker.
[03:01:31.420 --> 03:01:37.305]  This was a deal that was cooked up in the 1980s between the manufacturers of vaccines and the government, U.S.
[03:01:37.305 --> 03:01:38.265]  government.
[03:01:38.265 --> 03:01:44.190]  The makers came in and they said, look, we're getting out of the business because there are too many lawsuits.
[03:01:44.190 --> 03:01:46.272]  We're losing too much money.
[03:01:46.272 --> 03:01:52.637]  So if you want us to stay in the business, you, the federal government, are going to have to create a system whereby
[03:01:53.497 --> 03:01:54.759]  You do it your way.
[03:01:54.759 --> 03:02:00.486]  You compensate people who are destroyed, killed, kids brain damaged, whatever.
[03:02:00.486 --> 03:02:01.767]  You handle it.
[03:02:01.767 --> 03:02:03.509]  Nobody sues us.
[03:02:03.509 --> 03:02:05.712]  And the government said, fine, we'll do it.
[03:02:05.712 --> 03:02:08.575]  So they set up this labyrinthine system.
[03:02:09.176 --> 03:02:17.678]  Where you have to crawl through it and defend yourself and prove this and that and it's all semantic word games.
[03:02:17.678 --> 03:02:28.580]  It's like going into Orwell's 1984 to get compensation for the government because your child got vaccinated with the NMR vaccine and left the world like that.
[03:02:28.580 --> 03:02:37.842]  And you have to prove that somehow an official disease or disorder was contracted through the vaccine when the mother was there.
[03:02:37.842 --> 03:02:38.782]  She knew what happened.
[03:02:39.704 --> 03:02:42.028]  That's what she's saying.
[03:02:42.028 --> 03:02:45.655]  So this is insane punishment on top of punishment.
[03:02:45.655 --> 03:02:53.028]  And where all this is going, Alex, is into a popular revolution against the fraud of vaccines.
[03:02:53.670 --> 03:03:08.982]  Not just the fraud, the danger, the destruction, between 100,000 and 1.2 million adverse reactions, serious adverse reactions to vaccines every year in the U.S.
[03:03:08.982 --> 03:03:11.864]  That's what we're dealing with at minimum.
[03:03:11.864 --> 03:03:17.408]  All that's being covered up by the government who says, well, all these vaccines are incredibly safe.
[03:03:17.408 --> 03:03:19.810]  You rarely see an adverse effect.
[03:03:19.810 --> 03:03:21.031]  That's total baloney.
[03:03:21.693 --> 03:03:23.094]  They're lying through their teeth.
[03:03:23.094 --> 03:03:31.037]  They're covering up crimes for the vaccine makers who are behind the scenes laughing up their sleeves.
[03:03:31.037 --> 03:03:34.598]  And the bigger the house of cards, the harder it'll fall.
[03:03:34.598 --> 03:03:36.819]  I see the house of cards on so many fronts falling.
[03:03:37.572 --> 03:03:38.573]  Absolutely.
[03:03:38.573 --> 03:03:40.214]  And this is one of the major ones.
[03:03:40.214 --> 03:03:41.955]  No question about it.
[03:03:41.955 --> 03:03:45.296]  The rebellion is in full force on this.
[03:03:45.296 --> 03:03:46.277]  You can count on it.
[03:03:46.277 --> 03:03:48.178]  And they've doubled down with the flu.
[03:03:48.178 --> 03:03:50.439]  They're like nurses stomping down the street.
[03:03:50.439 --> 03:03:54.341]  And in businesses, they'll go, get your flu shot to random people, not just me.
[03:03:54.341 --> 03:03:56.783]  So now the cult is getting more aggressive.
[03:03:56.783 --> 03:03:59.064]  They're shooting kids up at school without consent.
[03:03:59.064 --> 03:04:00.405]  I mean, they're doubling down.
[03:04:01.161 --> 03:04:02.081]  No question.
[03:04:02.081 --> 03:04:07.884]  And nurses are being fired from their jobs if they won't take the flu shot.
[03:04:07.884 --> 03:04:09.284]  I get emails all the time.
[03:04:09.284 --> 03:04:10.205]  Yeah, that's in the news.
[03:04:10.205 --> 03:04:11.465]  That's in the news.
[03:04:11.465 --> 03:04:14.006]  So there's a full-on war going on right now.
[03:04:14.006 --> 03:04:15.227]  No question about it.
[03:04:15.227 --> 03:04:16.768]  And that's a good thing.
[03:04:16.768 --> 03:04:17.448]  Let's win it.
[03:04:17.448 --> 03:04:18.248]  That's what I say.
[03:04:18.248 --> 03:04:21.350]  Well, yeah, because if they get found out on this, it's over for them.
[03:04:21.350 --> 03:04:22.210]  It's a domino.
[03:04:22.210 --> 03:04:25.331]  The globalists have so many dominoes about to fall.
[03:04:25.331 --> 03:04:26.872]  Obamacare's already fallen.
[03:04:26.872 --> 03:04:29.233]  I don't think they can... Man, I tell you, this is an incredible time.
[03:04:29.887 --> 03:04:30.767]  It is.
[03:04:30.767 --> 03:04:31.708]  And you're right.
[03:04:31.708 --> 03:04:34.149]  These dominoes are all interconnected.
[03:04:34.149 --> 03:04:40.811]  If that vaccine domino falls, and it's going to fall, there's going to be a loud crash of a lot of other dominoes.
[03:04:40.811 --> 03:04:42.311]  Count on it.
[03:04:42.311 --> 03:04:44.152]  All right, John Rapoport, thank you so much.
[03:04:44.152 --> 03:04:45.633]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[03:04:45.633 --> 03:04:48.194]  Always compelling, hard-hitting, well-documented journalism.
[03:04:48.194 --> 03:04:49.814]  Thank you so much for all the time.
[03:04:49.814 --> 03:04:50.434]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:04:50.434 --> 03:04:51.495]  Always appreciate it.
[03:04:51.495 --> 03:04:52.295]  What a great guy.
[03:04:52.295 --> 03:04:53.916]  And you're a great audience and great crew.
[03:04:53.916 --> 03:04:56.136]  And the Lord's certainly the best.
[03:04:56.136 --> 03:04:57.637]  And we just appreciate you all.
