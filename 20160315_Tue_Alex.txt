[08:27.400 --> 08:34.320]  much for joining us on this worldwide ides of march global transmission it is tuesday
[08:34.320 --> 08:42.680]  the 15th day of march 2016 another super tuesday another primary and trump has already won
[08:42.680 --> 08:48.040]  in the marianas islands and is set to win in most other states the ides of march again
[08:48.040 --> 08:52.440]  is the assassination of julius caesar and how it changed the world and it's been seen
[08:52.440 --> 08:58.800]  ever since then in western culture as a very unlucky day similar to friday the 13th i don't
[08:58.800 --> 09:03.520]  know why do we have friday the 13th that's when the knights template were taken out and
[09:03.520 --> 09:11.920]  exterminated in spain and france in simultaneous hit squad directives from the pope some of
[09:11.920 --> 09:17.480]  them got word and escaped to scotland and that's when you see the black nobility move
[09:17.480 --> 09:26.600]  out of france and out of italy and to scotland and then to london and you see the rise of
[09:26.600 --> 09:37.120]  the british empire interesting little history note for folks okay where to begin unprecedented
[09:37.120 --> 09:45.520]  calls to arrest donald trump or to silence him at whitehouse.gov the chinese government
[09:45.520 --> 09:49.680]  is panicking again the japanese government is panicking we're going to break it down
[09:49.680 --> 09:55.800]  there are just scores of stories out there not just snl not just the new york times
[09:55.800 --> 10:01.120]  but now they are putting activists on tv that try to physically attack trump and that call
[10:01.120 --> 10:09.640]  for killing trump to legitimize in the minds of easily influenced mental patients out there
[10:09.640 --> 10:13.440]  that they should go out and try to kill trump because they're going to be martyrs they're
[10:13.440 --> 10:19.720]  going to be heroes if i got up on air and said as a talk show host of millions of listeners
[10:19.720 --> 10:29.120]  somebody should try to go kill x i could be sued civilly for terroristic threats and i
[10:29.120 --> 10:36.240]  could be investigated and probably charged for a call to action you have free speech
[10:36.240 --> 10:43.280]  and i'm a total supporter of it but when you try to organize people to frustrate free
[10:43.280 --> 10:52.880]  speech to go out and attack rallies and you call for people to kill someone it has a name
[10:52.880 --> 11:02.680]  it's called racketeering and it is an organized crime practice of group intimidation basically
[11:02.680 --> 11:10.160]  and what we see soros the democratic party the mainstream media and the rest of them
[11:10.160 --> 11:19.440]  doing is organizing a giant hoax to go after donald trump and then that means all of our
[11:19.440 --> 11:26.840]  free speech you see trump only goes up in polls as all these racist soros funded activists
[11:26.840 --> 11:32.520]  and others go out and attack trump and his supporters but if we didn't have a leader
[11:32.520 --> 11:38.960]  who was standing up and willing to be attacked then resistance wouldn't be victory let me
[11:38.960 --> 11:46.680]  explain you go up and you grab and you're sitting there with your feet touching the
[11:46.680 --> 11:55.000]  ground and you go up and you grab a high-powered tension line it is going to fry you into a
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.560]  crispy critter in seconds your eyes are going to pop out of your head blood's going to
[11:59.560 --> 12:06.280]  spray out your ears you're going to fry right there on the spot i've gotten into transformers
[12:06.280 --> 12:10.400]  and things i've been working on before out at the ranch when i was a teenager doing dangerous
[12:10.400 --> 12:15.000]  work like that and you get into an old transformer that had blown there'd be a fried rat inside
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.840]  of it where he he was the connection now you're saying where you going with this allegory let's
[12:20.840 --> 12:26.720]  think about liberty as electricity or political movement as electricity you've got massive
[12:26.720 --> 12:31.520]  rebellion you've got massive resistance you've got massive awakening against the oppression
[12:31.520 --> 12:38.080]  the usurpation the takeover it's rightful revolt you got someone that gets it and isn't afraid
[12:38.080 --> 12:44.120]  to go out and say the right things and punch the populace buttons he is what is making
[12:44.120 --> 12:49.960]  the connection the electricity is already flowing but it can't get to the political process
[12:49.960 --> 12:53.400]  because the globalists have bought off the republican and democratic leadership they
[12:53.400 --> 13:02.840]  control most the states the big institutions the big banks the big real estate companies
[13:02.840 --> 13:11.000]  the colleges the think tanks and they create a mass wall of cognitive dissonance or what
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.600]  the cia calls gaslighting that's where you basically just punch somebody in the face
[13:16.600 --> 13:21.040]  and then tell them i didn't just punch you in the face and if you're highly suggestible
[13:21.040 --> 13:25.720]  people will actually believe it and if you have other people with you and your authority
[13:25.720 --> 13:30.120]  figures and you tell someone no you didn't just see that they will start thinking they're
[13:30.120 --> 13:34.800]  insane and believe you and they've got big studies out you can look it up since the advent
[13:34.800 --> 13:40.560]  of television in the forties when it became more ubiquitous by the fifties obviously invented
[13:40.560 --> 13:47.280]  in the twenties but became popular by the forties and fifties and became again almost
[13:47.280 --> 13:53.440]  at every home by the sixties and became the center of daily life where you don't sit around
[13:53.440 --> 13:57.560]  talk to each other around the kitchen table you sit there and you watch television and
[13:57.560 --> 14:06.200]  then it becomes the arbiter the chief of your life the noble witch doctor or the noble shaman
[14:06.200 --> 14:13.680]  the noble chief of the tribe that tells you how to run your life and since then IQs have
[14:13.680 --> 14:20.840]  dropped physically we've gotten dumber the brains have been rewired the language has
[14:20.840 --> 14:27.680]  shrunk the life expectancy has shortened the family has disintegrated but more importantly
[14:27.680 --> 14:32.680]  the brain waves have lowered look it up to a near sleep state while you're watching television
[14:32.680 --> 14:37.160]  and a lot of people stay in that state after that because on average there's eight hours
[14:37.160 --> 14:43.520]  in the united states a day of some type of screen time some people have up to 14 hours
[14:43.520 --> 14:52.280]  of it think about that and where I'm going with this is Trump is breaking the trance
[14:52.280 --> 14:55.480]  and that's why the elite are panicking that's why they're saying arresting that's why they're
[14:55.480 --> 14:59.760]  saying killing that's why they're saying they're going to steal the election out in the open
[14:59.760 --> 15:07.360]  this is such a historic moment it isn't about trump folks he was simply the conduit he was
[15:07.360 --> 15:15.320]  simply the pigeon that landed on a power pole and accidentally touched one wire to the other
[15:15.320 --> 15:22.360]  and you see a white flash and feather shoot everywhere he's the detonator how many times
[15:22.360 --> 15:27.600]  have you seen I saw a hawk do it I saw a grackle do it and I've seen pigeons do it twice where
[15:27.600 --> 15:33.720]  you there's a flash day or night like a laser just and there's feathers everywhere they
[15:33.720 --> 15:41.960]  explode one time I was walking back from a swim team I could walk two miles and I like
[15:41.960 --> 15:49.680]  to walk to swim team and then walk back I was like 11 years old and there was a flash
[15:49.680 --> 15:56.920]  above me and then a black grackle male grackle fell right in front of me with smoke coming
[15:56.920 --> 16:03.240]  off of it pretty amazing but I'm digressing Trump is simply allowing the connection to
[16:03.240 --> 16:10.120]  happen boom and then notice it makes his poles go up and it panics him because once you breach
[16:10.120 --> 16:14.680]  the enemy defenses once you actually take the fight to him once you have resistance
[16:14.680 --> 16:21.040]  that's victory because we have history common sense and right on our side if we don't care
[16:21.040 --> 16:25.680]  about being demonized if we don't care about being attacked if we get past our fear we
[16:25.680 --> 16:34.640]  realize the only thing we have to fear is fear itself one of the truer things said by
[16:34.640 --> 16:42.000]  the president during world war two so look at this for yourself this is so important
[16:42.000 --> 16:47.680]  why I'm taking so much time on this for right of the news Trump is here let's go to drugs
[16:47.680 --> 16:54.800]  real quick it's also up on m4s.com but Trump hits 53 a national pole Soros freaks China
[16:54.800 --> 17:00.760]  warrants Japan fears we've never seen foreign governments and the Pope and everybody else
[17:00.760 --> 17:10.200]  saying you can't have Donald Trump we've never seen this behavior because he is giving vent
[17:10.200 --> 17:16.320]  to the anger and letting us know we have power he's not a steam valve ladies and gentlemen
[17:16.320 --> 17:20.520]  he is a conduit and that's why they've got to try to destroy him and stop him and stop
[17:20.520 --> 17:25.040]  this wave of awakening but this wave is only going to get bigger and Trump again is only
[17:25.040 --> 17:35.760]  a manifestation of that Trump breaks 50 a national support for the first time we're
[17:35.760 --> 17:40.200]  going to break that down after the break but that's what they're panicking about right
[17:40.200 --> 17:45.720]  now so what are they doing they're going with Nazi flags and Trump armbands to the events
[17:45.720 --> 17:50.360]  doing photo ops putting it out to their viewers and people say why would Hillary come out
[17:50.360 --> 17:54.840]  and say nobody died and been you know in in in Libya when of course people did die US
[17:54.840 --> 17:59.760]  forces did die and hundreds of thousands of innocent people died because she knows her
[17:59.760 --> 18:06.120]  constituents don't know where Libya is why does she continue to come out and say things
[18:06.120 --> 18:11.720]  that are complete lies folks ask what planet is she's living on she's living on the planet
[18:11.720 --> 18:17.960]  of her supporters have you seen most of her supporters they are the dumbest pseudo intellectual
[18:17.960 --> 18:25.560]  uninformed sad desperate scared people a lot of them mean well but a lot of others have
[18:25.560 --> 18:34.360]  been raised on the government education system and I've got multiple videos at US universities
[18:34.360 --> 18:42.280]  with black students and Muslim students this is every day now saying we just need to kill
[18:42.280 --> 18:47.200]  all white people period you see but that's not racism that's not genocide it's because
[18:47.200 --> 18:54.320]  whites are inherently bad and they believe it's okay and they're being taught by George
[18:54.320 --> 19:01.360]  Soros funded groups by the Ford Foundation who want this Balkanization who want us at
[19:01.360 --> 19:09.800]  each other's throats also up on info wars dot com our team in Florida was able to Richard
[19:09.800 --> 19:13.520]  Reeves and Josh Owens talked to Bill Clinton where he admits that yeah you know George Soros
[19:13.520 --> 19:17.200]  is basically really helps him out a lot of things is basically helping Hillary's campaign
[19:17.200 --> 19:21.360]  right now and the police are coming out Chicago saying yeah it was Hillary supporters throwing
[19:21.360 --> 19:26.160]  things and attacking and posing a Sanders people and we told you that back on Saturday
[19:26.160 --> 19:33.040]  but that's confirmed now folks this is how dirty these people are and they think Sanders
[19:33.040 --> 19:39.040]  supporters are dumb and we'll get into this now when Trump attacks them Trump did take
[19:39.040 --> 19:44.040]  the bait on that and then they'll shift from Hillary on to him attacking him but Trump
[19:44.040 --> 19:48.660]  gets it now he's been tweeting out that he understands it but this is how sophisticated
[19:48.660 --> 19:52.960]  this garbage gets big broadcasts today I'll tell you about the guests we got coming up

[24:23.280 --> 24:28.760]  now I wanted to go ahead and just get into this article Trump breaks 50 in national
[24:28.760 --> 24:33.280]  support for the first time and there are new stories out of the official newspapers in
[24:33.280 --> 24:43.440]  Japan in China in Europe you name it absolutely panicking and what they're scared of is not
[24:43.440 --> 24:50.920]  Trump they're scared of nationalism returning because the liberal super popular mayor of
[24:50.920 --> 24:57.040]  London being the mayor of London is almost like being co-prime minister is now becoming
[24:57.040 --> 25:02.480]  libertarian and speaking out against globalism and even criticizing some political correctness
[25:02.480 --> 25:08.560]  and saying yeah we did we do need to vet Muslims that they're not radical he's doing that because
[25:08.560 --> 25:13.920]  his constituents are fed up you've got all these movie stars overseas domestically coming
[25:13.920 --> 25:22.200]  out and saying I'm not liberal or conservative I'm 1776 you got Marie Lapin saying we need
[25:22.200 --> 25:29.040]  a revolution like America had in 1776 we need to stop the radical Muslim invasion they arrested
[25:29.040 --> 25:34.320]  her but she's facing court next week the presidential front runner they want to shut
[25:34.320 --> 25:42.440]  us up and all they can do is bring in populations of people who are humans and who can be tribal
[25:42.440 --> 25:47.480]  anybody can be tribal and they tell the minorities be tribal be racist whites are out to get
[25:47.480 --> 25:52.960]  you the average white person is just like everybody else working two jobs trying to
[25:52.960 --> 25:57.360]  get home trying to have dinner trying to watch a couple TV shows go to bed do it all over
[25:57.360 --> 26:02.560]  again go to a softball game and you go to a softball game you play softball everybody
[26:02.560 --> 26:07.640]  you know white black Hispanic half the people are mixed what's the system going to do when
[26:07.640 --> 26:13.120]  like half the kids or where I go aren't white or black they're just humans or or the you
[26:13.120 --> 26:20.800]  know the it's it's ridiculous and so they are just weaponizing it so nakedly and then
[26:20.800 --> 26:27.840]  you see these swollen I say swollen I don't mean physically fat these angry petulant thug
[26:27.840 --> 26:35.200]  like white students black students you name it going whites are inherently bad and we
[26:35.200 --> 26:42.960]  need to kill them they need to die I see that in the news every week from professors black
[26:42.960 --> 26:52.080]  professors that say we need to just get rid of white people period well that's what racist
[26:52.080 --> 26:58.640]  groups of whites have said is get rid of you it's so stupid but now they've gone into complete
[26:58.640 --> 27:03.800]  panic mode showing little sign of a ceiling Donald Trump has only grown in support with
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.680]  the exit of Ben Carson and Marco Rubio's collapse in the last two weeks Republican front runner
[27:08.680 --> 27:13.440]  Donald Trump has won more delegates and primary caucuses even while his opponents have launched
[27:13.440 --> 27:18.560]  new attacks and questions have been raised about his supporters this week's economist
[27:18.560 --> 27:25.360]  you go pull finds Trump still the top GOP voters preference with a wider lead than ever with
[27:25.360 --> 27:31.440]  Florida senator Marco Rubio seems most damaged by two weeks of attacks and counter attacks
[27:32.320 --> 27:38.480]  and then it goes through the numbers but he's breaking 50 nationally unprecedented ladies
[27:38.480 --> 27:44.320]  and gentlemen Rubio is sagging case it has gone up a tiny bit but I mean he's already so low it
[27:44.320 --> 27:49.440]  doesn't matter it's like a snail crawling over a grain of sand and then you got Ted Cruz there
[27:49.440 --> 27:55.760]  being propped up and I tell you all these purest Republicans out there are not sophisticated enough
[27:56.960 --> 28:02.720]  to understand that Ted Cruz is a sleeper operative there's no doubt the bushes are behind him
[28:03.440 --> 28:08.400]  there's no doubt he's even doing Obama pauses now there's no doubt his wife was at Goldman
[28:08.400 --> 28:15.200]  Sachs CFR running key trade deals there is no doubt that as a strict constructionist he can't be
[28:15.200 --> 28:20.880]  president because his father wasn't born here and he was born in another country sorry just can't do it
[28:21.680 --> 28:28.400]  and when he was a senator battling and doing some good things and champion against Obamacare and
[28:28.400 --> 28:33.840]  for the Second Amendment I support his votes and what he did but let me tell you he is uncloaking
[28:33.840 --> 28:41.520]  at the key moment now do I trust Trump I trust him to be his own person and that's why they hate him
[28:41.520 --> 28:48.080]  again he could be a disaster it doesn't matter it's the will of the people the whole of leader angry
[28:49.440 --> 28:59.600]  they're panicking and I know this we can directly tweet at Trump and say you're wrong it's Hillary
[28:59.600 --> 29:05.760]  setting up Sanders so the Sanders people turn against you in the general election instead of
[29:05.760 --> 29:15.200]  Hillary and then Trump comes out and gets it I have seen him get it over and over and over again
[29:15.200 --> 29:19.200]  where he says well these are Christians being murdered of course we got to bring in the refugees
[29:19.200 --> 29:23.040]  you know Obama launched these attacks with ISIS we have to do it then he goes wait they're radical
[29:23.040 --> 29:28.960]  jihadis aren't being vetted they don't even check their IDs we got to stop all that he does it flip
[29:28.960 --> 29:36.160]  flop other than going from bad positions to getting more info and changing and he always
[29:36.160 --> 29:43.760]  changes to the good that's that's what I see here he's learning on the job that's why they're so
[29:43.760 --> 29:50.560]  scared he's influenced by common sense we'll be back stay with us we're on the march the empires on
[29:50.560 --> 30:02.000]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network in a rather bizarre statement presidential candidate
[30:02.000 --> 30:08.480]  hillary clinton has said that the us didn't lose a single person in libya which is to say the former
[30:08.480 --> 30:14.240]  secretary of state is ignoring the murder of ambassador christopher stevens now libya is
[30:14.240 --> 30:20.080]  perfect isn't it clinton said libya was a different kind of calculation and we didn't lose a single
[30:20.080 --> 30:25.280]  person we didn't have a problem in supporting our european and the arab allies in working with
[30:25.280 --> 30:31.600]  nato mrs clinton conveniently skipped over the attack of september 11th 2012 on the diplomatic
[30:31.600 --> 30:37.440]  special mission compound and cia annex in Benghazi the left ambassador christopher stevens foreign
[30:37.440 --> 30:44.000]  management officer shawn smith and cia contractors tyrone s smith and glenn dory dead there's even a
[30:44.000 --> 30:50.000]  movie out about it called 13 hours and this isn't the first time hillary has had a selective memory

[34:00.240 --> 34:05.200]  over the place every day with other journalists understanding how important they are and i love
[34:05.200 --> 34:09.600]  actually seeing our stuff on drugs through other people's work through other people's sites because
[34:09.600 --> 34:15.120]  that's what i want to do is defeat the globalist not get a bunch of credit for info wars but look
[34:15.120 --> 34:22.320]  the american mirror video hillary staffer struggles to fire up unenthusiastic fans and
[34:22.320 --> 34:26.800]  we're going to play the video later it's so pathetic it's like yay come on get excited come
[34:26.800 --> 34:34.640]  on everybody and it looks like maybe maybe 50 60 people waiting to hear hillary speak
[34:34.640 --> 34:42.960]  she said crowds in san Antonio of maybe 500 in austin of maybe 300 400 in dallas but i look
[34:42.960 --> 34:50.720]  at liberal cities maybe a couple thousand birdie sanders 30 40 50 000 they lied and said he had
[34:50.720 --> 34:57.280]  100 000 out the airport the news did and out the racetrack i was like 10 000 so sometimes
[34:57.280 --> 35:00.880]  i have to correct myself because i go off mainstream media and it's not true but the point is he's
[35:00.880 --> 35:06.960]  got much bigger crowds than she does she's stealing all these states but at a certain point it becomes
[35:06.960 --> 35:11.840]  a self-fulfilling prophecy where she's winning so people just go ahead and vote for her even though
[35:11.840 --> 35:18.000]  they weren't supporting her before so now she wants to get the burning people to go after trump
[35:18.000 --> 35:23.600]  and that's why they're sending operatives out soros funded that's how dumb they think we are
[35:23.600 --> 35:30.880]  is soros admits and hillary admits that they're funding these groups but then they still have
[35:30.880 --> 35:40.400]  bernie blamed for it and their constituents buy it because they are the most uninformed cult-like
[35:41.200 --> 35:50.640]  group think package of so-called politicos i've ever seen now before i go any further
[35:50.640 --> 35:56.480]  uh on this front i wanted to start going through some of these videos and then i'm going to break down
[35:59.120 --> 36:04.480]  the specifics of the calls to arrest trump they have sheriff's department's calling for it
[36:04.480 --> 36:10.080]  the washington post calling for it white house petitions calling for it they're really beating
[36:10.080 --> 36:16.640]  this drum so that when they assassinating god forbid or when they hype somebody up to have
[36:16.640 --> 36:24.000]  an attempt on his life well he deserves it it's just rhetoric think of this unprecedented time
[36:25.360 --> 36:30.720]  think about it we deserve to have sovereignty and we deserve to not just let people come in
[36:30.720 --> 36:36.560]  and get free stuff oh my gosh we're gonna abolish obama care oh my gosh we're gonna have fair trade
[36:36.560 --> 36:40.880]  deals i love free trade i love free trade believe me but we're not gonna have these one side of
[36:40.880 --> 36:46.720]  trade deals that's what they are they go watch out protectionism caused the great depression
[36:46.720 --> 36:53.760]  no it didn't go read the history books it wasn't smooth hauling and that that stuff came in during
[36:53.760 --> 37:00.960]  the crash right as it was happening ridiculous and i'm not for a bunch of protectionism
[37:01.600 --> 37:06.720]  except when countries are using slave labor and they have no environmental regulations
[37:06.720 --> 37:14.320]  the factories are owned by chinese generals they don't pay taxes no one can compete with it
[37:16.640 --> 37:22.560]  it's incredible you have to deal with that hillary came out and said hey coal mining's
[37:22.560 --> 37:28.800]  going fine hey nobody died in libya hey when obama's on tape saying if you have a coal power plant
[37:28.800 --> 37:34.560]  we're gonna bankrupt you that's a close quote we will bankrupt you that is the president
[37:34.560 --> 37:41.840]  of the united states right before he got elected in 2008 saying you can have a plant but we will
[37:41.840 --> 37:48.640]  bankrupt you and the average trending goes good the reason i hype on coal i own no coal no stocks
[37:48.640 --> 37:55.520]  no nothing it's because i want prosperity and i know the power bills in this country have almost
[37:55.520 --> 38:00.160]  doubled the last eight years for good reason they've shut down over a thousand coal power plants
[38:00.160 --> 38:06.800]  modern clean systems that put out nothing into the atmosphere they produce distillates that are
[38:06.800 --> 38:15.680]  used in steel and other alloy production and it's just an amazing science we have enough coal for
[38:15.680 --> 38:23.680]  a thousand plus years at current rates and that's why the economy's dead you come explain this
[38:23.680 --> 38:27.680]  i'm sorry it's very very slowly all the trendies i know you tune in and the show's like a big joke
[38:27.680 --> 38:35.920]  to you do you understand that just eight years ago about 65 percent of our power came from coal
[38:37.120 --> 38:44.240]  now it's more like 40 percent and you're paying almost double for that power they didn't replace it
[38:46.640 --> 38:47.520]  you understand that
[38:51.440 --> 38:55.840]  so this whole carbon tax thing is about shutting off the cheapest form of power
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.480]  and that's why the oil companies if you actually do the research the big ones
[39:01.280 --> 39:10.320]  dutch roll shell bp exon mobile and others have been financing research and movements and lobbying
[39:10.320 --> 39:16.800]  to have coal completely shut off because the oil companies also own a lot of natural gas
[39:16.800 --> 39:22.720]  which they can then replace the plants with it's more expensive and by the way my family has gas
[39:22.720 --> 39:28.320]  wells so if i wanted to just think about me that's how the average scumbag thinks i would go out yeah
[39:28.320 --> 39:32.880]  get rid of coal because i might get some money of natural gas ever goes back up i've never gotten
[39:32.880 --> 39:40.240]  money from natural gas my mom's mom a little bit my dad a little bit i mean that there's so many of
[39:40.240 --> 39:44.000]  them and you don't really really get that much money but i guess if gas ever exploded in price
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.360]  you would but i just the average person i'll talk to him i don't care about this i'm invested in this
[39:49.360 --> 39:55.280]  as if you screw over some industry you take a resource and then that makes your industry rise
[39:55.280 --> 40:03.040]  when everything else sinks that's not free market it's a scam and it makes me fundamentally get angry
[40:04.960 --> 40:09.440]  i've run into so many people that are petroleum geologists and so many lease hounds and so many
[40:09.440 --> 40:14.080]  people that are involved in exploration of oil and gas and that family that were petroleum geologists
[40:14.080 --> 40:20.320]  and family that's run you know run refineries major refineries my dad's uncle he's dead now
[40:20.320 --> 40:27.280]  ran one of the biggest refineries in houston was a plant manager for 30 years and
[40:30.240 --> 40:33.520]  i've just shot around and talked to him and they go everybody knows that sure yeah
[40:34.320 --> 40:40.560]  yeah that's i've been to the board meetings when they take out natural gas and when they take out
[40:40.560 --> 40:45.920]  to a coal natural gas will then be you know move we're lobbying for that and and then oil's also
[40:45.920 --> 40:50.720]  financing and i mean it's just a fact in these oil company level discussions
[40:52.480 --> 40:58.240]  and it's so frustrating but let me finish the part of the equation i'm going to quit ranting
[40:59.520 --> 41:05.520]  china builds multiple coal power plants that have no scrubbers and spew poison of the air
[41:05.520 --> 41:15.360]  and then we shut down multiple plants per week while they open multiple per week you cannot
[41:15.360 --> 41:22.080]  compete with energy that is basically a third the price of ours factories have to go there
[41:23.280 --> 41:30.320]  mexico has built over 50 coal power plants just in the matilda doras in the last six seven years
[41:30.320 --> 41:35.920]  and its us and multinational coal companies move in some cases one mile over the border
[41:36.640 --> 41:41.600]  build a coal power plant and the factory moves there and why does the american factory move there
[41:44.240 --> 41:54.720]  because you have to or your electricity bill is two to three to four times more in many cases
[41:54.720 --> 42:00.240]  texas had some of the cheapest electricity in the nation because we had so many coal power
[42:00.240 --> 42:05.040]  plants it's not the case anymore it wasn't just no income tax state income tax it wasn't just
[42:05.040 --> 42:09.680]  things like that it was that we had the cheapest power texas was supplying the surrounding four
[42:09.680 --> 42:18.800]  states with their power austin owned four power plants couple of more multi-billion dollar plants
[42:18.800 --> 42:27.280]  you know what austin did they divested and in one case wouldn't even let anyone buy them out
[42:27.280 --> 42:36.400]  and turn the plant back on they just shut it off let me explain that austin didn't want
[42:39.360 --> 42:43.440]  the close to a billion dollars they could have sold or was it their Fayetteville plant
[42:43.440 --> 42:51.280]  they just scuttled that part of the plant it's got three plants look it up for yourself i'm
[42:51.280 --> 42:57.600]  going from memory but but again get get your mind around that get your mind around that
[42:59.840 --> 43:06.880]  for a nation to operate it's got to have power our government is unplugging us from the power cord
[43:06.880 --> 43:12.880]  oh they really want us to be wealthy and have prosperity and hillary's going to give you that
[43:15.600 --> 43:25.920]  let's go to the clips let's go ahead and start with black students advocate white genocide
[43:25.920 --> 43:33.920]  at harvard now now remember at harvard and at Yale and at a bunch of universities they're
[43:33.920 --> 43:41.200]  getting rid of the word master a master painter a master fencer a master at jujitsu
[43:43.600 --> 43:50.080]  they're getting rid of the word lynch on buildings they're banning costume parties
[43:50.080 --> 43:55.120]  and if a professor says we need free speech that's true liberalism they scream at them and then
[43:55.120 --> 44:00.320]  they're fired you ask why would the elite want this all over the world they want to end free
[44:00.320 --> 44:06.160]  speech and these are cults they're creating of absolute racial divide who they will then deploy
[44:06.880 --> 44:12.400]  but basically phd's they're given to go run your city in your town and make it all about race
[44:12.400 --> 44:18.400]  and have us all each other's throats it is a military program to have brainwashed idiot racist
[44:18.400 --> 44:24.400]  getting a degree in black kukluks clan behavior and mecha and la raza hispanic kukluks clan
[44:24.400 --> 44:31.920]  behavior all soros for foundation funded with black professors not just students saying
[44:31.920 --> 44:38.080]  we should kill all whites this is funded by the elite and let me give you a newsflash you're not
[44:38.080 --> 44:42.960]  going to get to kill all whites this is meant to make whites then racist set up a prison style
[44:42.960 --> 44:50.000]  economy and so whites under desperation will join with the state in the overall actual oppression
[44:50.000 --> 44:57.120]  of everybody it's a divide and conquer strategy the opposite of what martin luther king talked about
[44:57.120 --> 45:02.320]  let's go ahead and go to that club why do white people have a right to affirm their life
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.080]  because all whites have that right really have how so why does white life have value
[45:11.040 --> 45:16.000]  well i think for who why no excuse me for who our argument is that white life is wrong why
[45:16.000 --> 45:21.120]  why our argument is our argument is that we should never affirm white life that you're
[45:21.120 --> 45:25.760]  arguing just affirming all life in general is not good especially not good for black people when
[45:25.760 --> 45:32.240]  white life itself is based off of black people you're probably white i am white why should we
[45:32.240 --> 45:36.640]  affirm my life i don't say why i have to care about your life anyways there's no ethical reason
[45:36.640 --> 45:41.040]  that's why white people deserve to live but foreign black life means that i mean that white death has
[45:41.040 --> 45:46.240]  recurred that's why you should lose this band while your life ain't worth affirming myself like
[45:46.240 --> 45:54.000]  under your arguments okay so should we kill myself i don't see one other why why should we do that
[45:54.000 --> 45:59.040]  how does that it's ethical how is it ethical we all have some form or another privilege why does
[45:59.040 --> 46:04.240]  that mean we kill ourselves because you have white privilege what why is having white privilege
[46:04.240 --> 46:08.160]  necessarily mean i should kill myself why shouldn't i like struggle against the structures that
[46:08.160 --> 46:12.000]  of course struggle against the structure means putting yourself on the line putting your body
[46:12.000 --> 46:18.800]  on the line do it a friend who's to decide that's well that's true i mean this email is one little
[46:18.800 --> 46:26.000]  form is one little step in the right direction all right arrogant racist so-called black guys
[46:26.000 --> 46:33.280]  that they look like they're about 80 caucasian entitled feeling like they're royal because
[46:33.280 --> 46:40.400]  they're the oppressed that's how this victimology works like it's it's like stars on your shoulder
[46:40.400 --> 46:44.800]  you know like you're a general the more you've been abused the more you've heard somebody did
[46:44.800 --> 46:50.880]  something bad to you and you've got these bozo looking you know white college students and
[46:50.880 --> 46:55.360]  i'm not knocking them but that's white people probably want to go play video games watch football
[46:56.080 --> 47:00.240]  they're just like hey i'm white i won't do anything wrong i think all life matters like
[47:00.240 --> 47:05.760]  yeah go kill yourself whites just need to die all of you and that's the attitude
[47:08.320 --> 47:11.760]  i mean imagine if the klan was saying kill all the black people be oh how horrible
[47:12.720 --> 47:17.200]  and that's what you pay to send your kids to public school most of private schools and to
[47:17.200 --> 47:25.360]  secondary education now most of it is learning how to be a social justice warrior and then they get
[47:25.360 --> 47:30.880]  the first year freshman in to the sensitivity training courses you got to go to now most colleges
[47:30.880 --> 47:36.240]  and you're bullied and you're beat down and then after that happens you're taken to a party about
[47:36.240 --> 47:43.280]  two three months into it and it's like oh you're all right now and they'll have phd students there
[47:43.280 --> 47:48.880]  that are all controlling it it's it's cult induction and then if you just accept it then it's all right
[47:48.880 --> 47:53.360]  now everybody's going to be nice to you you can go to college and that's what it came out is happening
[47:53.360 --> 48:00.160]  at me zoo and it's now being reported me zoo may pay price for campus protest as enrollment plunges
[48:00.160 --> 48:03.920]  member of the famous white professor lady coming over and saying get me some muscle
[48:03.920 --> 48:09.360]  take these people out beat them up safe spaces may become empty spaces at the university of
[48:09.360 --> 48:14.160]  missouri where officials acknowledged and expected sharp decline upwards of 25
[48:16.640 --> 48:21.520]  and when they questioned folks they said look we don't want to go to college for social justice
[48:21.520 --> 48:25.520]  training and sensitivity training tend to learn how bad we are
[48:29.840 --> 48:37.040]  we just want to live our lives and so people are also seeing an enrollment go way down around
[48:37.040 --> 48:43.920]  the country because most of these college degrees are near worthless going and working
[48:43.920 --> 48:47.040]  in the field you want to be in is the way to go now obviously you have to go through the
[48:47.040 --> 48:50.800]  rights of passage if you want to be a lawyer or if you want to be a doctor or if you want
[48:50.800 --> 48:54.720]  to be an engineer you can certainly learn things in those disciplines but really you're just meeting
[48:54.720 --> 48:59.360]  the right people and learning how to be charming so many young people out of college they think
[48:59.360 --> 49:08.720]  acting arrogant distant uh empowered but you're bad they think because i mean i run into this all
[49:08.720 --> 49:14.880]  over you you see it everywhere they think acting arrogant like in junior high that got them ahead
[49:15.920 --> 49:20.640]  because you must be cool is what gets you ahead in business and life no knowing what you're doing
[49:20.640 --> 49:26.880]  showing up on time working really hard and most important being charming playing golf with the
[49:26.880 --> 49:32.240]  boss going to the christmas party because if you're charming there you're going to be charming in
[49:32.240 --> 49:40.480]  sales you're going to be charming and everything else i got another clip it's in it's in turkish
[49:41.760 --> 49:45.200]  but it ties to this turkish muslims want to kill non-believers
[49:45.200 --> 49:51.520]  i shall stab them one by one whenever i find them catch them and kill them they don't believe in
[49:51.520 --> 49:55.760]  Allah or the Quran they are unbelievers and animals they are not human they are not human
[49:55.760 --> 50:00.080]  they are not like us god bleeping them they don't believe in Allah to help them this course the
[50:00.080 --> 50:04.400]  folks that are coming into europe this is the left particularly wants we're going to skip this break
[50:04.400 --> 50:14.960]  because then you can bully everyone to tell them to submit to this you've been taught to be politically
[50:14.960 --> 50:19.280]  correct you have no immune system you have no cultural resistance and so here come
[50:21.120 --> 50:25.520]  third world hardcore folks that are constantly killing each other and they're going to muscle
[50:25.520 --> 50:30.960]  they're going to run you down and and and and men in the west i don't care if you're japanese or
[50:30.960 --> 50:35.280]  you're you're american and you're hispanic or whatever americanized you know westernized
[50:36.480 --> 50:40.400]  metrosexual men women think those are cute and those are their buddies that's not what they're
[50:40.400 --> 50:46.240]  looking for and so these guys just run right over and get your daughter they just run right up and
[50:46.240 --> 50:51.760]  just grab them when they're 16 or they're 14 or 15 and there'll be no statutory rape charges for
[50:51.760 --> 50:56.080]  them in germany they're allowed to have sex with five year olds if you're a muslim they just the
[50:56.080 --> 51:00.560]  police have said it's your culture you're by the way you want to rape somebody's 10 year old in
[51:00.560 --> 51:08.000]  sweden do it they're white they deserve it and so you get the big emom of jerusalem gets up and says
[51:08.000 --> 51:16.320]  we are coming to germany or women right because nobody stands up only we we just we do nothing
[51:16.320 --> 51:22.720]  but roll over and run up white flags and of course these arrogant people who could never
[51:22.720 --> 51:29.760]  take us down before who feared the west now are on these power trips because they know we're weak
[51:29.760 --> 51:34.000]  they know we're pathetically know we're servile we they know we want to fall
[51:34.000 --> 51:44.400]  and just the arrogant slimy seedy dirtiness of it all i mean let me tell you there are
[51:44.400 --> 51:48.240]  sectors in the middle east they treat women well a lot of culture and science came out
[51:48.240 --> 51:54.480]  but let me tell you with the slave trade and the spice trade and human trafficking slavery never
[51:54.480 --> 51:58.880]  got brought to the levels it did in the middle east that's why we're always lectured by the
[51:58.880 --> 52:05.440]  imams and folks about the west and slavery because they're the king daddies of it everything's inverted
[52:07.840 --> 52:10.160]  you want women chained up in sex slaves
[52:12.560 --> 52:18.240]  you want male slaves with their genitals cut off you want hundreds of millions killed baby
[52:19.920 --> 52:26.640]  the wahambi is know how to deliver it and they have no respect for you because
[52:26.640 --> 52:31.440]  quite frankly i don't deserve respect america doesn't deserve respect we have to admit how
[52:31.440 --> 52:35.680]  pathetic we are you know when i go out and do a man on the street a person on the street
[52:38.000 --> 52:41.840]  see the full correctness don't follow any of it anymore when i go out to do a man on the street
[52:45.040 --> 52:49.600]  when we go out there to talk to people we don't do it to make fun of them and put them down you
[52:49.600 --> 52:53.600]  think i like to in the night i did a facebook mentions buckley and leon are like stop it you know
[52:53.600 --> 52:59.200]  you're making them feel bad it's embarrassing it's meant to be embarrassing i'm not out there
[52:59.200 --> 53:03.680]  making fun of people because i like it you think i like getting in front of a thousand people and
[53:03.680 --> 53:08.960]  tell them how stupid they are and how pathetic they are one of them can get you can take offense i

[53:14.800 --> 53:21.040]  south by southwest thing is a fraud on record i know the founder of it it's where you pay thousands
[53:21.040 --> 53:27.040]  of dollars to go have corporate garbage spewed on to you it's the biggest joking hoax in marketing
[53:27.040 --> 53:32.960]  i've ever seen they told us two years ago we couldn't hand out pamphlets in downtown and
[53:32.960 --> 53:36.800]  ordered two different groups of police to do it then they had code enforcers come over and i said go
[53:36.800 --> 53:42.320]  ahead i know the code you're gonna get sued and they had to back off but they don't let people
[53:42.320 --> 53:48.800]  20 miles from austin have a rock concert during it they show up like gangsters and say you better
[53:48.800 --> 53:57.520]  watch it they charge 80 dollars parking during it it's a joke with all these people thinking
[53:57.520 --> 54:03.600]  they're coming there to find out the secret how to be successful just like college i don't take
[54:03.600 --> 54:10.960]  personal pleasure out of going down to ut and i don't care if they're asian white black you name it
[54:10.960 --> 54:19.280]  90 of them look like the walking dead i was at the beach years ago with richard reeves he would
[54:19.280 --> 54:24.160]  drive the bus when i was on the road doing doing a tour i'd take my family with me and richard said
[54:24.160 --> 54:30.320]  you notice anything here and we'd be at you know the beach and i go yeah women don't look like they

[54:40.880 --> 54:47.200]  true you i mean me included i mean it's been a battle to lose 60 something pounds you look at
[54:47.200 --> 54:52.960]  black and white photos you look at old you know super eight reels people eight smoked more you

[55:10.240 --> 55:16.480]  and gray skin greenish skin i don't care what call they are just just shuffling around they're dead
[55:16.480 --> 55:22.960]  already i'm not putting them down to make myself feel good i'm saying look how dumb you are i don't
[55:22.960 --> 55:29.280]  want to go show that 90 of people don't know what the fourth amendment is so we look big we have to
[55:29.280 --> 55:34.160]  do these man on the streets to show people that are awake it's why they have national polls every
[55:34.160 --> 55:38.400]  year of college grads and you know 67 percent don't know who the second president was or
[55:38.400 --> 55:43.440]  don't know the three branches of government you do that to show as a gauge you know my car
[55:44.480 --> 55:50.160]  had one of the gaskets blow off about a month ago uh from the water cooler and the water
[55:50.160 --> 55:54.160]  dumped out as i was going down the road i saw some water smoke i thought oh and i saw the heat
[55:54.160 --> 55:58.560]  going up it wasn't a power trip against my car that the heat went up and i knew that i'd lost the
[55:58.560 --> 56:06.640]  water wasn't an arrogance to go oh look i'm more powerful than the car it's hot it was it's a gauge
[56:06.640 --> 56:12.480]  that we're in trouble but see that's the political correctness that permeates everybody
[56:13.920 --> 56:17.520]  where you don't want to show somebody they've been screwed over or they're in trouble
[56:17.520 --> 56:20.800]  you don't want to be strong about it because you're putting them down and i'm not putting Buckley
[56:20.800 --> 56:27.200]  and Leanne down but it's the judgment on me see that i must have been doing that because i wanted
[56:27.200 --> 56:32.080]  to be mean to somebody i don't want them to take the vaccines i don't want them to get robbed by
[56:32.080 --> 56:37.840]  the fellow reserve i want them to have a future i'm in their face because i love them don't you
[56:37.840 --> 56:42.800]  get that but see it's not my mom will get mad my dad will get mad it's not that they're bad
[56:42.800 --> 56:48.080]  they're good sweet people and we've been run over because we're too sweet it's time to stop being
[56:48.080 --> 56:54.480]  sweet about any of this they're selling baby parts they're keeping them alive we've been screwed over
[56:54.480 --> 57:03.680]  here we've got anger for a reason like i'm going down there and i'm getting all their faces
[57:04.640 --> 57:10.240]  sick of it you see people walking into a concentration camp you better warn them
[57:11.120 --> 57:16.160]  especially they're laughing at you those people need to be ridiculed into waking up

[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.720]  are being scammed by south by southwest but i've actually had multiple people i know over the years
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.040]  who are being caught in a known marketing scam and they won't believe that it's a scam so i talk
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:15.600]  into a compulsive gambler that goes and plays slot machines and it's one thing if you can do it and
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:19.280]  you don't have a family but if you're mortgaging the house to do it you need to be ridiculed
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:26.080]  some ironies to get in your face i mean how else do you get people to wake up i found ridicules
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:36.880]  really one of the ways to do it very painful to do it but i'll do it i don't enjoy it but i enjoy
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:42.400]  seeing it get results i think it's fun to get up here two months four nine eleven and say they're
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:49.040]  going to blow up the world trade center and blame it on ben laden did it i will do what has to be done
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.920]  i could care less when i've been at city council years ago and they're all laughing at me about
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:59.040]  fluoride causing cancer and i have the studies right there i'm trying to save lives you think i care
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:08.960]  what big bags of filth think about me and see trump doesn't care either and that's why this is so
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:13.280]  exciting and trump needs to come out and say we're not going to shut off our coal plants
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:17.200]  that's the real reason we can't compete with china that's the real internal tariff and i'm
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:24.560]  going to tweak that at him actually during the break shutting off coal power plants is what's
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:37.280]  making it shutting off coal plants obama shutting down coal plants is helping china trump please
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:44.240]  turn the turn the coal back on something like that or or trump please promise to defend coal
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.680]  give us super energy that's the key to competing with china
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:55.360]  because i'm telling you i relay messages through stone trump some i've seen it through other people
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:01.440]  and trump responds it is amazing i was like please talk to him today about the fellow reserve saying
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.960]  he wants to audit it where he stands he goes well actually i know he's against it and i know he
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.680]  wants to go up against him and i'll talk to him and then like the next week he did it
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.400]  stones like i don't get it too much inside baseball but it's pretty amazing it's pretty
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.800]  amazing when he talks to him a lot he don't want people to know how much but the point is uh is
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.640]  that i've been sitting there with him at dinner when trump calls up he leaves for 20 minutes um
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:28.320]  repeatedly so he's like his buddy and see that's what stone says it's weird is that
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.880]  these guys have been like going out to dinner and hanging out on when trump was divorced and
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.720]  stuff you know they go out in double date forever i'm not supposed to be telling all this the point
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:42.160]  is the stones like his buddy is the only guy one of his best friends and uh the inside baseball is
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.520]  just incredible and that's why the system is so scared of trump folks he is a wild man just he's
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:56.560]  a real guy but i'm digressing we need to nakedly say what we think even if i disagree with people
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:00.000]  on some things i like it when they say what they really think and that's what this is all about
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:05.600]  now we're going to come back uh with Gerald Salente and talk about all this and more and
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:12.400]  now the whole power structure is coming after trump the military news the trends you name it and
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:20.800]  also the fact that stone had mentioned this yesterday this tommy dimosimo and i'd heard this and read
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:27.120]  this but sure enough on his own facebook it's him with an al-qaeda flag and an uzi and that's what
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:32.720]  i've seen it left us a bit this guy like goes around and stomps on american flags and waves ices flags
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:39.120]  and yeah you know this guy isn't even a muslim he they're just into anything trashy and seedy
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:46.560]  and evil because there's their wimps their punks and they want to intimidate our free speech and
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:52.320]  shut our free speech down it's never gonna happen and the fact that we now have a conduit where we
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.640]  can see the results of resistance is the beginning of the end for the establishment i'm telling you
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:03.440]  this is a big time to be alive a 7-eleven shopper in washington state relied on his concealed carry
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:09.200]  firearm over the weekend to subdue a man who attacked customers and staff with a small axe
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:15.120]  just before six a.m. sunday a masked man entered a convenience store in seattle and began swinging
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:21.760]  a hatchet at both customers and the store clerk before attacking the cashier reports ko mo news
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:27.680]  we don't know if the intent was to commit a robbery because the suspect didn't say anything
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:33.280]  a king county sheriff sergeant said and armed store patron was sitting and having coffee at
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:40.000]  the exact moment the axe-wielding suspect entered the 60-year-old man who has reportedly visited
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.800]  the store nearly every day for the past 12 years shot and killed the suspect the store clerk age

[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.560]  minutes long up on info wars dot com they're in one of the uh photo lines but our crew in florida
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.360]  just got and i'm not going to play it because the time issues it's on info wars dot com if you
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:00.000]  want to see it he talks about george soros and how he got to know him back during the Balkans
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:06.160]  he's been helping a lot yeah i'm not serb i'm not croat i'm not muslim okay but i studied it the
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:12.880]  un reported myths that the croats and the muslim started the fights not once but twice that is
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.760]  literally where the crusades began that area because they kept getting invaded albania is uh
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:25.120]  sunni muslim same folks that have gone to syria and they killed double the number of serbs they
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.520]  started both wars but they've got dozens and dozens of hollywood movies and tv shows and
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.480]  christina i'm on poor showing a guy with tuberculosis behind a un bar bar fence trying to get in the
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:40.480]  food saying he was a concentration camp victim remember that and british itn admitting it was
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:44.960]  all lies and then they bombed belgrade with du weapons and blow up their water plants their
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:54.400]  power plants their tv stations and give a third of the country of syria that borders albania to
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.520]  the muslims and now a decade plus later on record they've killed almost all of them are driven
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.760]  them out over a million people they go door to door and they kill the christians that stayed
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:11.600]  so just get your mind around that and hillary says that libya they got their objectives it's not
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.240]  a failed state they wanted a failed state and nobody died not the hundreds of thousands of
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.720]  non radical muslims and blacks because the racial hobbyists from syria arabia that ran that out of
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.600]  Benghazi they don't like black people they wrote the book saying they weren't human so they could
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.680]  enslave them cut their genitals off as unix and use them as slaves unestimated what's the number
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.960]  300 million black slaves killed by the muslims i'm not even bashing muslims here i'm just saying
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:43.120]  what went on out of saudi arabia but that's okay it's okay they're killing the blacks right now
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:47.440]  in libya because that's cutesy right that's why lewis fair cons even come out against obama
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:51.760]  because he knows he knew qaddafi these are the unbelievable war crimes and she just says hey
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:58.080]  everything's wonderful lie after lie and you know she had bigger lies than brian williams
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:04.320]  about being shot at speaking of uh the the balkans all lies but to her constituents it doesn't
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:10.880]  matter but i want to ask jerry solente what he thinks about this moment in time and and and how
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:16.240]  this affects his trends and where he sees this going to have the washington post saying maybe
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.160]  trump needs to be indicted or arrested that's his fault people are attacking him for his speech
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.360]  that's political correctness on steroids and you got the sheriff's department saying it you
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:30.000]  got all these people saying it but that's only one block of what i want to talk about with him
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.120]  the economy's unraveling all over the world frightening over the top signs it's hard to
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:41.360]  leave it in the news here they just tell us how great we're doing separately you got north korea
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.360]  threatened to nuke south korea threatened to nuke japan threatened to nuke manhattan to the point of
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.960]  the chinese and the russians are threatening intervention the russians who have a border
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.440]  with them in their north the north of north korea borders a small sliver with russia
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.680]  russia is threatening to invade it has a big military force there last week i see a meme on
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:06.000]  the internet that i made that up type in russia threatens to invade and you get foreign russia
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:12.080]  news rt british news almost no u.s news and then a meme that i'm fear mongering
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:20.640]  so again america is so insulated from the rest of the world they have no idea how crazy it is and
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.720]  what does jerole talk about in history when an economic collapse accelerates they always take
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:31.600]  you to war they're trying well jerole i'm ranting i set the table there uh you want to tackle the
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:35.440]  geopolitical stuff first or do you want to get into trump and the election first because i mean i
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:40.320]  know your view but i want you to elaborate trump is the manifestation of the populace rebellion
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.120]  and the rnc saying officially we're going to take the delegates and not give it to him
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:50.720]  will they really be that willing to be that naked and are we reaching that magic moment now
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:57.200]  where the where the scales come off the eyes and never go back again jerald well first i'd like to
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:03.760]  start with what you're talking about with syria and and how that bloody war was started by the
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:09.840]  clinton administration bill clinton and clinton's hands are filled with blood people forget that he
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:17.040]  was bombing bag dad and and and a rock during his entire two terms matter of fact that was one of the
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:23.680]  first things he did was bombs away over bag dad and you know i hear hitlery clinton talking about
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:30.560]  her being a progressive liberal and you look at their again the blood on their hands is that
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:37.600]  interview with madeline albright the secretary of state under clinton and she's asked by leslie
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:44.640]  stall and anyone could of course google this up if the price of sanctions that bill clinton put on
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:54.800]  a rock were worth the price of 500 000 iraqi children under the age of five dead and madeline
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:02.400]  albright says yes it was and then you talked about the serbian war and all those bernie sanders
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.400]  supporters out there you know this bernie sanders you know you know i know the act the coney island
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:15.680]  act bernie save it what they don't talk about is bernie bs bernie who plays i voted against the
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:23.760]  iraq war he got people arrested for protesting bill clinton's serbian kosovo war but they never
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:33.840]  talk about that either on to the donald trump issue the i'm there's things i like about trump
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:38.880]  things i don't i'm not going to take a stand on it but i do take a definite stand on this
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:46.000]  you know we held occupy peace over here uh in kingston this past september we put our own
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:52.720]  money into making it happen we had ralph nader cindy she and dr robert thurman gary know and you

[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:27.760]  coming through run you over and then you're not allowed to defend yourself they want a silent
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:32.240]  speech they admit they want to shut trump up well they can shut him up they can shut any of us up
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:38.400]  exactly they have no right they have no right doing it and to make the point where all these
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:45.200]  little liberals you know like the kind we have over here in woodstock you know the phonies up there
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:53.760]  try try speaking out at a public meeting a school board meeting when your time is up
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:02.880]  try speaking out in city hall try speaking out in the senate ds committee meetings or congressional
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:07.360]  man they've got you lost that's right they're trying to shut down citizen demonstrations
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:12.320]  they're trying the government's trying with social engineering to disrupt true populist movements
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:18.560]  what i'm saying is you're not allowed to do it you're not allowed to do it in any of those venues
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:25.440]  that i just talked about what right does some clown with a big mouth and a bad attitude have
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:32.800]  to go into somebody else's show and yell and scream they have no right at all but the meat again
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.800]  go to your school board meetings your city hall meetings town hall meetings senate committee
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:45.040]  meetings and try speaking out and interrupting how long would they take it and if you said get this
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:52.240]  guy out here who is that he or she you're not condemned for it but yet when you know trump
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:56.880]  saying you know who are these people every time i'm talking disrupting me people came from all over
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.000]  to come and hear me speak and it's the same thing with me if i'm speaking and having i don't want
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.400]  somebody yelling out put on your own show they came here to hear me they didn't come here well
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:10.960]  that's right he pays for arenas he pays for the hangers and then i mean to be one thing if he was
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:14.720]  doing it the town square then you can see some protests or something but these are pretty much
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:19.040]  private events and they're trying to attack free association they're trying to take our free speech
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:25.120]  away and then they'll go in with a hundred people and space it out uh to just ruin the whole event
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:33.600]  now going to chicago you know i made was it move on was it george soros yes let's put something else
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.440]  into perspective here just to make it really clear and i'm not making this a war criminal
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:47.200]  nazi collaborator piece of filth i i lived in chicago for six years here it is this is from
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:58.720]  last may make may 28th 2015 from chicago's cranes business news chicago is still number one for
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:06.960]  public corruption it's ranked that high for like 40 years in a row one of the most corrupt cities
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:14.160]  in the united states and who's the mayor or rama manuel rama manuel hey wasn't he with the bill
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:24.320]  clinton gang yeah yeah what was he let's see rama manuel he was um president clinton's uh
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.760]  president for political affairs under clinton assistant to the president for political affairs
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:36.960]  senior advisor to the president for policy and strategy 1992 presidential campaign he was the
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:44.720]  director of the finance committee oh oh and by the way he um he was also president barack obama's

[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:15.200]  i mean look at the gang running the show over there you think this did happen by mistake you
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:20.800]  think they couldn't have quieted it down or seen it coming and done something it's one of the most
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:27.440]  corrupt it is the most corrupt city in the united states and they showed it live and that's the
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:31.440]  model of government they want the late great erin russo who you know produced a lot of big
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:38.080]  hollywood movies with eddie murphy you name it who died of cancer in 2007 or was 2008 i was talking
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:42.800]  to him about the last few days he died and he told the story about when he was first bringing
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:47.600]  led zeppelin to the us and they had like 10 000 people at this theater he bought in chicago
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:51.760]  and first they came and said give us protection money he said no so that the fire department
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.160]  come in and dump garbage everywhere in front of them then they had the inspector behind them to
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:01.680]  give them huge fees and they said listen you give us the money you let us see how much you're making
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:06.640]  you pay it directly to the police and to us or we're going to basically shut you down he paid
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:12.160]  them off for a year and a half then the government itself through a city official opened another theater
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:18.080]  down the road came in dumped garbage around everywhere beat him up and the police took him
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.680]  in the back of the patty wagon he said okay i'm not resisting and they said we don't care you think
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:27.120]  you're gonna make money and they literally began beating his testicles with the billy club so you
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:33.840]  want to live under that folks that's who the the clintons and obama are they are literal chicago
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:38.480]  machine mafia and that's what they want jaryl is that what you're getting at that's exactly
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:43.440]  what i'm getting at let's call it what it is oh and by the way where did obama come from
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:49.440]  oh chicago right the community organizer that never organized anything and who is the front
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:56.880]  forum oh the pritzker family pritzker hide hotel oh those pritzkers oh who's the commerce secretary
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:04.080]  penny pritzker oh where's penny going now to cuba what are they doing now oh you think they'll
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:11.600]  open up any hotels the game is rigged it's the mafia but not the don't blame the italians man
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:20.400]  daily's not italian rama minewell's not italian mafia comes in all races creeds and colors so save
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.560]  it folks it's not sure i don't bring this up because you're italian but we talked about this many times
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:31.280]  at dinner it's true it's another great hoax they branded the only organized crime as italian so all
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.840]  the real organized crime could sit there and operate and do whatever it wanted to i've actually
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:40.720]  studied organized crime the most powerful organized crime are the big robber barron families
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:47.360]  that own and run the whole show it's not it's not guys shaking down you know uh mom and pop stores
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:52.720]  in new york city i mean what a scam yeah and when i've been saying what i just mentioned to you
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:58.160]  about chicago nobody's talking about that that is the most corrupt city in america and look at the
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:03.840]  people running the show you can't get closer than than the obamas and clinton's and democrats
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:08.240]  so when a republican goes in there you think they're gonna try to cut them out oh by the way
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:13.680]  i remember the uh presidential race under kennedy and all of a sudden he wins illinois
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.440]  it's amazing but but instead of blaming their own corrupt government
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:24.400]  it's fun to just go beat up some people that came out for free speech and i was talking to
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.920]  folks that were there a lot of more than even supporters they just came to see what was going
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:32.560]  on to hear for themselves and hear of people attacking them what do you make of the mainstream
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:37.920]  media trying to legitimize arresting trump are they not trying to set a precedent to really restrict
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:43.600]  free speech i mean i'm supporting trump just out of free speech alone well again what do you
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.080]  saw with the republicans i mean it's been out there in the open they're trying to derail his
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:54.000]  campaign he's not a member of the club and then you look at who is this republican club they got
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.680]  to bring about a little lightweight like mittens romney to come fight trump look who the other
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:10.640]  republicans are lindsay graham a mitch mcconnell ryan a bunch of little nobody nothing's john insane
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:16.960]  mccain so that's the republican establishment that's why trump is fighting against no one
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:21.920]  and they're gonna do everything they can to bring him down and of course the democrats want to knock
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:27.840]  him out because he's the only real contender against them well the republicans are corrupt
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.680]  and bought and paid for and the elite put weak leaders in so they can control them they're scared
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:36.480]  of trump because he is his own guy uh and and the people elect him you know that's their issue we
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.880]  need to keep him on a short leash if he does get elected but i've never seen him hitting the panic
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.760]  button like this but also look at europe look at what else i want to segue into the economy with
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:49.680]  you because boy have you been proven right with with how this thing is starting to collapse and i
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.320]  want to know how long you think they can cover up just how bad it's really gotten but first wow
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:00.560]  wow you and rights expert north korea leader should be prosecuted another example of statism kim
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.400]  jung-un threatening to blow up seoul south korea with nukes threatening to blow up manhattan
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:09.360]  threatening to attack japan the russians as you know will put that up on screen for folks that
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:16.400]  just tuned in via tv or radio um that the russians have quote threatened to invade uh if they don't
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:21.280]  stop threatening world war three almost no coverage of this in our media and i wanted to get
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:26.960]  your inside baseball take on why the russians are suddenly pulling out of syria saying it's the cease
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:32.160]  fire uh i think it's something much bigger and very ominous i'm not quite sure what but i'm
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:38.000]  telling you my spidey sense has never been redlining like this you know i don't know why
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:44.560]  they're doing it and uh but i don't think they're going to do much of it is my my analysis or look
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.920]  at what what i've been reading and again i'm on the outside over here i think they're what they're
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:56.640]  saying is that we have a peace process going on they're still bombing away but they're going to
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:02.960]  start you know uh bringing down their troop strength and are they bringing it down because
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.960]  they're concerned about something else happening very likely and with the north korean situation
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:15.520]  the other side of the story that's never told is the united states aggression over there as well
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:21.760]  continually threatening them with all these so-called war games and if you put somebody in a corner
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:27.760]  they're going to react the way they are again you know i was it was it north korea that invaded
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:33.120]  libya no no i know they're the ones that overthrew iraq no no it was north korea that went into
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:38.560]  afghanistan yeah that's right no it was it's north korea that said Assad has to go
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:46.720]  no you know what i'm saying so the united states militarism you know it's freaking these people out
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.040]  they don't know if they're going to be next so of course they're threatening them you blow me up i'm
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:55.440]  going to blow up manhattan sure and i misspoke earlier what i was saying is russia has threatened
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:01.680]  to invade north korea i mean that is so unprecedented jerald what do you make of that that's what i was
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.960]  trying to get at no no they're not going to rush to invade them no again you know what russia's
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:13.520]  saying is that what as what the chinese are saying is they want peace in this area and then they
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:20.400]  could see you look at the united states you listen to the generals you listen to this ashton carter
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:26.560]  you listen to all of them and it's pivot to asia china's our great nemesis absolutely and now you
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:30.640]  got china built in these sand castles but it's not just the western elite that's out of control
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:35.920]  north korea is out of control china's doing some saber rattling why would these governments suddenly
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:42.400]  all be going into a military mode why historically jerald when we see economic collapse globally
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:48.000]  does it take us to war every time why are so many historians saying the climate is almost exactly like
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.840]  the beginning of world war one and all it's going to take is the wrong spark because again you as you
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:59.120]  mentioned the economies are collapsing what happens when they devalue a currency you keep
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:07.280]  hearing currency wars so go back you have a depression a crash a depression currency wars trade
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:13.760]  wars world war look at the shipping indexes here at all time loads where's the biggest failures
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.120]  from asia to europe so what's happening is everybody's fighting for a piece of the pie
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:24.640]  devaluing their currencies the currency wars and by the way that's not going to increase their trade
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:32.480]  global trade is down this year last year down almost 14 percent today the retail numbers came out
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:41.120]  in the united states down oh and by the way alex they also revised downwards sharply from an increase
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:50.640]  of 0.6 percent in january they devalued it now it's like a minus 0.4 percent in january the

[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:09.200]  and some 340 000 retail jobs last year as the retail sector is collapsing so china's economy

[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:21.200]  said libya was a different kind of calculation and we didn't lose a single person we didn't

[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:51.360]  the research because here's a big story out of bloomberg yesterday and we're going to our
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:57.200]  guests and your calls about how gut bacteria are shaking up cancer research and it goes through
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:03.200]  roach holdings and all the other big pharma companies genetic engineering companies are saying
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:10.000]  at the university of chicago you name it that the gut is dead that kills your immune system your body
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.640]  stops fighting cancer you die now this has been known since the time of apocrates thousands of years
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:26.560]  ago that health starts in the gut to quote him but another big part of that is true pure iodine
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:31.280]  which according to our research no one else really even has it's all different types that are bound
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:37.920]  and you don't really absorb x2 is a pure form of iodine injected into organic palm oil and a
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:43.440]  patented process a secret process and believe me big companies have called us tried to buy it
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:47.760]  tried to figure it out as a true blessing this fell into our hands about a year after we had
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:55.040]  our other iodine out that was the best at that time and was a similar process we were just able
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.640]  to expand on it through doctor group scientists and everyone should be taking survival shield
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:08.480]  mason iodine x2 here's the article the thyroid gut connection and you can read about that for
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:14.560]  yourself just type in thyroid immune connection and there's all these scientific papers out there
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:21.200]  look at it for yourself here's anthony gucciardi four years ago antibiotics could be to blame for
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:26.560]  skyrocketing mental illness rates gets into the gut gets into autism all the stuff wakefield said
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:32.000]  20 years ago then they demonize him and said he lied he's since been exonerated well now it's in
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.680]  bloomberg now it's in the new york times here's another one mcdonald's destroys the gut bacteria
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:46.400]  of a college kid in 10 days they tested his this is extremely his you know what before and then
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:51.760]  after totally dead after 10 days uh tech times researchers find link between gut bacteria and
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:57.200]  mental health i'm just pointing out again huffington post science the surprising between gut bacteria
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.720]  and anxiety it's all in your gut your brain and your gut are connected through nerves in the spine

[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:57.920]  up in new york i've been dealing with a lot of launch operations family stuff family illnesses
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:02.080]  you know it seems like things come in threes all hell's been breaking loose for me the last year
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:07.360]  for good and bad but your trends forecast is so incredible your news alerts are so amazing
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:13.600]  how do folks sign up to get your magazine because even if they know stuff uh and think they know it

[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:23.120]  to hopefully wake them up as well Gerald how do folks subscribe to that they could go to trends
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:28.800]  research trendsresearch.com and of course beyond the trends journal which is accordingly and you

[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:47.840]  the news broadcast each weekday night so it was really you know in my humble estimation
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:52.800]  the only place where you could read history before it happens and we've been doing it since 1980
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:59.440]  and let me explain people need to also invest time and money in the liberty movement all flavors
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:04.640]  of free expression and openness that's how we build the new economy is with our actions
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:09.760]  something you've been writing about for 30 years yes and it is very important that people you know
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.560]  support the people that they believe in you know it's not going to happen after we we talk about
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.680]  you know move on and all these other things that are funded by the by the you know the the multi
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:25.760]  billionaires and uh if it if we the people don't make it happen and support each other and then we
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:31.040]  could see the future it's they're going to be theirs not ours i'd like you know very pro probiotic
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:36.320]  by the way and and i don't know if you know this but this was the first book that i worked on
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:41.520]  i did natural healing wasn't like a number one new york times my seller it was not this one but
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:48.640]  another one very soon this was a warner book it was a big book 1988 and i also have a honorary
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:55.520]  doctorate uh from the uh of law from the unit national university of health sciences for the
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:02.240]  work that i've done over the years and integrative and and complimentary medicine and putting out the
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:07.360]  information about it and no i know you wrote about gut flora 30 years ago how big a deal is
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:11.840]  that now the top scientists are saying we didn't know this it's incredible it's incredible this
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:17.360]  could this could reduce cancer by 80 percent i mean that's in the news now well what i'm also
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:22.480]  saying is that this is one of the great big trends that we're looking at in the whole
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:29.360]  element of the of what the products that you put out there whole health healing is the only way out
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:36.800]  as we see it there's not one drug on the market that cures a chronic degenerative disease all
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:43.200]  they do is mask the symptoms they don't cure you yes you know if i got i got bit by a tick a
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:49.680]  couple of times yeah i go for those antibiotics but then i also go for the probiotics and i do
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:55.600]  other things to heal myself and to build my system back up in a natural way so i'm not saying i'm
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:00.960]  anti-drug they have their place sure there's a balance exactly but not in whole health
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:06.080]  healing so what i'm saying is that the people listening in to really pay attention to what
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:12.640]  you're saying in the whole context of it you know one of our top trends for 2016 is you know the
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:18.160]  baby boomers might be one of them you know this we're hitting 70 this year and we don't want to
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:25.280]  end up as inmates in nursing homes so you want to stay healthy until you you know until the lights
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:31.600]  go out basically so i'm urging people to really consider listening to what you're saying the
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:37.440]  products they have available because it's going to help them because the only way that i see this
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:46.160]  movement moving forward that we're interested in and that is truth of life and peace and prosperity
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:54.720]  is that we have to be in the best shape we can physically emotionally and spiritually and i'm
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.760]  not talking religiously i'm talking about the truth within yourself so i'm just saying this
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:04.000]  because it's very important that people we have to get healthy we have to get centered and and for
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.760]  some of us got out of shape it's a long journey but you get there and it's it's it's it's life
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:12.880]  changing great points Gerald Salentes our guest trendsresearch.com let's start going to your calls
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:18.320]  George Daniel Dave John mr. x and many others toll free number to join us after callers hang up
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:27.680]  800-2599-231 800-2599-231 let's go to Connecticut first let's talk to George in Connecticut you're
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:32.720]  only here with Gerald Salentes hi Gerald it was nice being up at that demonstration in Kingston
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:38.720]  the beautiful town uh yeah that guy was a jerk buddy but maybe we can put that in our path
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:44.400]  anyway my question is uh do you see any trends uh leading to uh maybe people finally getting
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:49.200]  up and and stopping the corruption whether state local or or federal yes clearly there's
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:53.760]  massive and i mean stay there want you to follow up but clearly Gerald what are other manifestations
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:59.520]  of the populist awakening all over the world going to be investigative journalism lawsuits
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:04.560]  people voting with their dollars we see it all is it the discovery of the power we really have
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:08.960]  or uh what are other manifestations you're looking for well again you know it depends
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:14.720]  where you are look what just happened in Germany over the past week sunday the afd party you know
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:19.840]  there's the got the biggest rise it ever has since the end of world war two what are their stances
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:29.040]  anti-immigration and pulling out of the eurozone you put in and again like or dislike and i'm not
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:36.080]  taking a stand on either of them why are people following bernie sanders because he's well besides
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:43.280]  you're going to get a free free college tuition you know besides that rap he's going after the
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:50.800]  wall street gang just as trump is doing on another end the people are ready they're ready to move
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:44:00.480]  as i see it we need a unified movement without a political overtone to it to push us forward the
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:06.960]  people are ready you can see it by it by the crowds turning out look at the look at the increase for
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:14.240]  example on the republican end of the amount of people going and voting on primaries and then
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:19.040]  they claim that he's a divider when he's growing the party more than reagan did it's like well
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:26.960]  up like 40 percent you know and again you're seeing go around the world you're seeing it happen
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:33.440]  the people want to live in peace they don't want this stuff and so what i'm saying is we need a
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:40.000]  unified movement as i see it to bring us all together and not a movement but a movement with
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:46.480]  with directions focus and exactly i see it as an anti-globalist movement where the globalist
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:51.440]  can't be tax exempt offshore and then reap the rewards of this country because look at
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:56.400]  john claud von dawn coming on against globalism lapin coming on against globalism even the liberal
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:02.240]  mayor of london coming out against globalism in the e you anti-globalism is getting which is really
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:06.560]  anti-neocolonialism it's like the corporations are now conquering the countries and they're
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:11.920]  conquering the old world and the new world and as people wake up to that paradigm it's game over
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:17.680]  george in connecticut you're on the air with your old salenta go ahead finish up your point well i i
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:22.240]  just i i have a specific reason for that because i've dealt with that myself i try to help people
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:29.200]  locally and uh when i uh against a major uh billionaire project and what happened was uh
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:33.360]  they used the police to come after me and threaten the life of my wife and myself
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:38.560]  and anybody that got into it i'm talking serious stuff death death threats and they track me down
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:44.320]  so this is the type of stuff people in the ordinary world does not understand happens
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:49.520]  that these people will use the police as a weapon as if there's some some crime and it's really
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:55.040]  the police are being used as thugs well that's certainly in a democratic party areas and i'm
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.960]  not saying the republicans are perfect they're very corrupt but with democrats from my research
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:04.720]  on average they're more of the chicago new york big city crime machine and that's where i see the
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:10.080]  police actually operate at least certain divisions of them they've got corrupt nest usually at the
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:15.520]  top uh that will actually engage in organized crime activities that's that's well known gerald
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:19.440]  is that an oversimplification because you know it's kind of like republicans tend to get caught
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:25.200]  cheating with a guy on their wife and then and then with democrats it seems to always be
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:30.880]  heterosexual it's just weird trends but but it does seem democrats are more of the old big
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:35.360]  city machine crime stuff is that an accurate statement or an oversimplification i think it's
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:40.720]  where you come from you know and again to me the democrats and the republicans and i don't say
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:47.840]  this facetiously are no different than the bloods in the crypts i mean how many more people do they
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:54.720]  have to murder around the world in the name of bringing free dumb and democracy oh in a humanitarian
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:47:00.800]  mission like our Nobel Peace Prize we did in you and how much more of our dough do they have to
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:08.720]  steal in the names of too big to fails talk bailouts loan guarantees tax breaks and all the other so
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:15.600]  it they're just different branches to me of the same corrupt corrupt bloods in the crypts
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:21.520]  well i just said we should just start giving him Nobel prizes on a daily basis every time he
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:26.000]  bombs another country because this is their attempted inversion of reality thank you george
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:31.280]  daniel in california you're on the air with gerald salante go ahead hi alex thanks for taking my
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:37.280]  call uh my question to you is regarding the whole uh anonymous thing recently in the news just like
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:41.760]  came out that they're on a full on attack again on donald trump and wants to know what your views
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:47.040]  of anonymous are and who like funds them and everything do you want gerald's or mine or both
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:51.680]  gerald gerald give us your view well again you know as i said you're they're gonna do anything
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:59.440]  they can to stop trump they've made it very clear again how could you play such a weak card by
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:08.400]  bringing out mittens romney a total little loser to attack trump they have nobody there
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:15.600]  what you see is what it is they're desperate they will try anything who's gonna stop trump
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:22.240]  mitch mcconnell linsey graham i mean who they so of course they're doing this they're going to do
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:30.640]  everything they can by the way i see donald trump not as a republican uh candidate i see him as a
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:37.280]  third party candidate that moved into the republican party to pull off what he wanted to do and by the
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:43.760]  way that's how he sees himself uh just so folks know little inside baseball um good good point
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:50.480]  daniel anything else well i was just wondering i know like uh if if trump were to ever not like
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:55.840]  get the republican uh let's say primary do you think he would go third party or what would you
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:59.520]  think you know i think he's thinking about it but he doesn't want to give it to hillary i want to get
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:04.560]  gerald's take on that but getting back to anonymous my problem with anonymous is this
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:09.680]  most of the anonymous people are good folks but it's anonymous any group can just take the name
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:14.480]  anonymous and then it's and then it's as if they speak as if they're a good organization when you
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:19.840]  look at who is anonymous it's not anonymous when it comes to trump it's soros it's saudi arabia
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:25.680]  it's the chinese communist it's the pope i mean look at all these foreign groups lecturing us
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:29.920]  gerald why do you think they're lecturing us so much i mean don't they know that's backfiring
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:34.400]  or is that just part of the hubris and they think america's still uh in a catatonic state
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:39.120]  oh it's part of the hubris that's all it is and who are they to tell us what to do
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:45.600]  yeah just tony blare coming out and saying how bad it would be if trump or sanders he mentioned
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:51.200]  both of them who's this wall little war criminal shooting his mouth off mind your own business
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:55.360]  and oh by the way it's not only saudi arabia they're coming out of kawaii they're coming out of
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.240]  dubai all of them are all coming out against trump what is he gonna do upset the military
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:06.640]  industrial complex i don't know but what business is it of theirs how dare they tell us mind your
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:12.160]  own business could you handle that one and then again on the same in the reverse we should mind
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:16.640]  our own business in other countries well that's what you've always said and that's part of globalism
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:20.640]  is it gets to where we are so controlled by foreign countries and they're elites
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:27.360]  and basically the elites of the world china the us europe passed their populations around uh you know
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:32.240]  like uh a hooker you use in a snuff film i mean i mean it's not like they're just passing us around
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:36.400]  they're hurting us they're putting cigarettes out on us if you want to use that allegory great

[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:37.800]  let's go ahead and talk to Mr. X in FEMA region 6 I guess I might be Texas what is the 25th amendment I I forget some of those higher amendments what's your question or point Mr. X great thank you gentlemen and gang and team and all that good jazz everybody keep just doing the hard work that you're doing stay awake stay focused 25th amendment question at what level degree at how many
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:55.800]  people had what extent of upon millions hundreds of millions of people do we know this organized gang of criminals and nothing but corrupt system is going to have to kill to say that we obviously have a corrupt leader to say that he's not saying this obviously come out of the news as well by several
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:25.760]  facts like I trust stating that this guy has got several issues that are just way off whack to say how can he be in charge of so many people sure I got your question I appreciate your call and of course 25th amendment was passed in July of 65 ratified in 67 25th amendment changed a portion of article 2 section 1 section 1 in case of the removal of the president from officer is death or resignation the vice president shall become president and before they had a different way of doing that so I guess the caller
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:47.760]  was getting into why can't you know we were moved president Obama or I shouldn't have hung up on the car he was just so excited I couldn't understand him I'm not sure what he was getting at there about the 25th amendment but you know if I don't want Obama to ever get shot or hurt because it'll turn him into a martyr God forbid that happened at the same time look how bad his vice president is where do you think he
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:57:13.760]  was going with that Joe Salenta well I think he was saying you know bomb is out of his mind and he should go and I think if they're all out of their mind they're a bunch of psychopaths and sociopaths by their dean you shall know them I you know I'm really good at killing people that's what he was quoted as saying with his drone strikes he never denied it it's in a book so to me if somebody said that I call the guy a
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:29.760]  psychopath absolutely and then there's Hillary Clinton you know that famous one we came we saw he died he how happy she was when she heard these are like villains out of a out of a science fiction movie let's talk to bill in Ohio only about a minute and a half bill what's your point for Joe Salenton
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:49.760]  hey guys I appreciate you taking my call hey it's kind of a comment I wanted your opinion and Alex I wanted thank you a while back I am the guy who did the marine veteran and friends confront Hillary at book signing you guys played it on your show and the hits have gotten crazy
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:58:09.760]  I remember the reason why I did that yeah and I appreciate it the reason why I did that was to show people that you could confront her in a respectful way you were not going to get thrown out I'm a marine and they just received my DNA and thank God you really got me south on her
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:25.760]  anyway my comment is this guy is I think what we've done is if people would educate people how and that's the reason why I did the video was to how to get your point across and get more out of this
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:39.760]  I think we don't do like Black Lives Matter and go stop people's events go to the events when they take questions or whatever get in there and expose what's happening and if enough of us do that it'll bring the system down it's on the edge already we'll be back we'll be back with five more minutes for our guests

[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:18.760]  moving quick here we're going to go into the next segment and continue taking your phone calls and covering a bunch of news that's breaking like these two articles
[02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:34.760]  Trump first and only candidate to qualify as GOP nominee Trump meets delegate threshold for GOP's rule 40 they're talking about that's a certain threshold even be considered they're talking about taking people that don't qualify on a rule 40 and letting them come and take the primary from
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:54.760]  and that's in another article by Kurt Nemo RNC says delegates not bound to primary votes we already knew that but they're openly saying they're getting ready to steal it and nobody said an article on this that I could see it was buried in article Federal Reserve gives money to Hillary Cruz and nothing to Trump that is another huge populist endorsement against the private
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:01:06.760]  foreign banking cartel certainly it is for me you know there are articles like Federal Reserve official under fire for donating to Hillary there's other articles mentioning who the Federal Reserve gave to and who their employee union gave to
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:17.760]  it's the employee union but the union directs where it goes from the top people and that was again to Hillary none to Trump that tells me everything I need to know Gerald Salenty
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:35.760]  well you know you talk about the Federal Reserve I don't know I this came out last week Fed President Dick Fisher admitted quote the Fed front loaded an enormous market rally in order to create a wealth effect he said that a few months ago at the
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:56.760]  anniversary of when they began this scheme of quantitative easing and zero interest rate policy just a week and a half ago he told CNBC quote we injected cocaine and heroin into the system to enable this wealth effect that he admits
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:16.760]  didn't work and he says quote now we are maintaining it with riddle in and official also confirmed that the quote the Fed is a giant weapon that has no ammunition left so in thinking about the Federal Reserve and using those words heroin and
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:34.760]  cocaine isn't that illegal heroin cocaine and that's all this was it's it's injections heroin and cocaine injections to keep the money junkies alive and by the way the Federal Reserve has been caught I remember the AP when I was first on
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:48.760]  there in 96 the Texas Fed and San Antonio got caught with multi billions in cocaine money in it so they also launder the money physically but then also have the allegory of injecting us with heroin and cocaine
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:03:04.760]  so is it any surprise that they're backing the people that support them that created they I mean the look with the look with the Clinton administrations did for the Federal Reserve and the whole banking system you remember that was the
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:18.760]  amazing Ron Paul really should and I get he's a purist he should really come out as a populist just as an anti-establishment move for Trump and then I guarantee a Trump would adopt a lot of his policies I know he admires Ron Paul I know that when
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:33.760]  Rand attacked who I also like attack Trump Trump hit back and so I know you know somebody called my son a weasel and a wimp and an idiot you know I wouldn't like it but I think that those three ought to reconcile because this is really important let's talk to Mark in Illinois he wants to talk about
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:50.760]  Trump and the media real quick we're almost out of time okay very good yeah with you guys having shows like you have you know with Mr. Soros you know Stone Zone and and yourself your show why couldn't Trump you know using the media like he's got refer
[02:03:50.760 --> 02:04:04.760]  to his website where he can have us go to that I'm sure there's just millions of folks that just use mainstream media well sure Trump Trump sends out links and stuff on his Twitter to tens of millions and he's come on the show and others and he is using a lot
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:19.760]  of you know alternative media new media he is doing that but Trump Trump Trump's getting more hardcore as he goes and he isn't fully on board with them with our ideas but clearly he's got the system upset I appreciate your call closing comment on that Gerald Salente
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:36.760]  well yes he does and again this shows you the the opportunity for a new direction and to me by the way the only way it's really going to happen is with a new third party again you put the more the same as the again and Trump I think is that third
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:47.760]  party candidate and possibly something could happen from it but to me the Republicans and Democrats I've had enough of them for the rest of my life do you think he's in danger to being assassinated

[02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:16.760]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:42.760]  you know Sunday I played a poll Joseph Watson video
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:09:02.760]  that I said is the model of how to expose tyranny I said it's pretty much better than anything I've done and just in content and how he lays it out is about as hardcore as it gets just straight clean facts devastating
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:30.760]  jacari Jackson does some one minute news vignettes that are as strong in fact I just brainstorm up here on air that's why I say a lot of my ideas on air is I'll never have time to say it off air jacari does such great reports but when he does those one minutes they're so hard hitting that's what I think jacari should do we should all do is take like one minute of voiceover but then leave it in with a couple clips and or maybe a report or something like that
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:39.760]  and or maybe a report but it's that style jacari does it is just sounds like
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:51.760]  you know million dollar voice broadcaster but then it's also course a million into million billion dollar voice broadcaster but then it's the content and the words he chooses night has a great talent
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:10:10.760]  big's all of them I mean they're all talented it's just that Watson does like these three and four minute videos that are over the top strong he did one on Sunday dealing with what the media doesn't want you to see I think was the headline at the Chicago rally
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:27.760]  and they did another one about the media promoting the assassination of Trump that's gone viral but you know getting a half million views just isn't enough we have videos that have you know 20 million views apiece I want to dominate
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:42.760]  but here's a new story on info wars dot com info wars featured in new Trump campaign video that takes a clip of Paul's report which Trump's welcome to use whatever we do obviously I think some of our graphics crew with the debate coverage
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:57.760]  graphics they made much better than anything Trump ever had I'm just saying we're just offering our services here to the battle against the elite I mean you got George Soros the communist Chinese the pope the whole new world order foreign governments the Clintons the
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:11.760]  public establishment said they're going to steal the popular vote from this guy and we're not going to get behind him it's an absolute no brainer so Paul's got a bunch of these videos and I've been meaning to play him factors another one that I'm going to play
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:27.760]  this is your car report on plate physical good I just I want to go to your calls I want to go to Dominic I want to go to Jeff Dave Mel Cameron and others but but this video needs to go viral and again if you scroll down you can see the assassination of
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:41.760]  Donald Trump that's the latest video but Paul needs to add his other video under it let's just go to his YouTube channel and give me the actual names of it so I start stuttering and bumbling around on there it's exact it's because I can't get the answer to something yeah there it is
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:57.760]  that one only has 124,000 views is another one as a half million views and again we've got videos with like 800,000 views that are people fighting with each other but then something really important like this doesn't get any views yeah here's the one the truth about the anti-Trump Chicago
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:13.760]  riot 675,000 views sounds great doesn't it no it's 500,000 yesterday it needs to be 67 million we'll know the country's being saved when instead of it being Justin Bieber and his underwear you know getting 100 million views
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:29.760]  somebody battling to at least allow us to have a level playing field for our industry when people start getting concerned with that that's when we know we've turned the corner the assassination of Donald Trump's one of the videos the truth about the
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:43.760]  anti-Trump Chicago riot and when you look at this and you look at how he puts it all together in their own words it's powerful so let's play the new Donald Trump campaign ad great job the crew just scrambled and just got this the last minute when I was told about it
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:59.760]  and then we will go back to your calls and more news but it is extremely important that you realize the real viral videos in the new war are going to come from you from we the people from all of us
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:15.760]  Trump isn't advertising and spending money with the establishment he just puts out his videos counting on the grassroots that's what we do we count on you to take action they're doing everything they can to hack attack us to denial of service attack us to have horrible
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:31.760]  people come after us dirty tricks you name it I don't complain about it I'm not a victim I'm an overcomer and I love fighting tyrants they think they're better think they're smarter they think they got it all figured out I've got to do what I'm doing
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:47.760]  because my guts won't let me do anything else you understand that my guts run the show folks and I can't screw anybody over but let me tell you something somebody tries to screw me over I don't take any pleasure in defeating them except the satisfaction of the fact that
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:14:01.760]  they're not going to be able to go on hurting others or they're going to certainly been taught a serious lesson these people want to dominate you and your family because they're lusting after power because they're not powerful people you are powerful when you send an info wars link out on
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:21.760]  Twitter Facebook YouTube Instagram or a thousand other platforms when you tell folks on I heart radio to tune into us in our podcast when you tell people to you know to check out our videos and our free feeds you are changing the world you have the incredible power to crush the globalist to break their back

[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:50.760]  folks work about it roll down your window tell somebody to tune into the local station you're listening to right now to listen to this broadcast become a sponsor of the local station go ask to speak in front of the church get up there and just talk about the attack on free speech in
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:15:07.760]  American say you may not even support Donald Trump but the fact that churches aren't supposed to talk about our leaders and America is wrong we have a right we must exercise our free speech or losing these are the type of things you need to do you have to get out of your comfort zone and I know many of you have done it but it's only a fraction of the
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:25.760]  listeners and actually buy products and inform store dot com we know it is a fraction of the audience that spreads the word and shares links we know we have the analytics and I'm telling you just a few more percentage points that you buy the products and a few more percentage
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:40.760]  of you out there spread the word and send out links and shoot your own YouTube videos or do your own little radio show I don't know just do it all of us doing something right now this is the season of change the enemy is coming in right now to take over
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:16:00.760]  but there is a spirit rising against it be part of that be part of history it's the animating contest get excited don't let them grind you down it's enjoyable say lifting weights is an analogy to
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:16.760]  and first you start pushing those big heavy dumbbells up and maybe a little tight and hurts but after the second third set you got a lot bigger weights in your hands and it just feels so good to be doing it it's like politics or life you think it's not fun till you make it fun
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:29.760]  it's so satisfying when you don't clean your garage out you feel all sick about it and you procrastinate first kind of head a key and you don't want to do it not going to watch TV or go to the park or go to a movie or I got to balance my checkbook online
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:36.760]  you just go I'm just going to clean the garage you just clean the garage throw it all out sweep it all out two hours later you're sweating take a shower you feel great you have the best weekend ever
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:49.760]  we got to clean out Washington we got to clean out our neighborhoods we got to clean out our own lives as well and just get out of being spectators being run over and in the arena that's where the animating contest is
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:17:01.760]  I'm going to go to your phone calls from Costa Rica to South Carolina from Pennsylvania to FEMA region three but first in full wars featured new Donald Trump campaign video here it is
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:16.760]  I am officially running for president of the United States and we are going to make our country great again
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:31.760]  time magazine last week did an incredible cover story they said it's a movement and that's what it is it's an incredible movement with incredible people incredible people
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:46.760]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president they are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump it's it defies the reason
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:18:06.760]  pik yapt's assault and attack police and that's the piano signs and bad fire guns in the air and customers are saying the liberal media and Ted Cruz and Prince boy Marco Rubio are all blaming
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:14.760]  You know Frankly, Donald has created a very toxic environment.
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:22.680]  dividing people and liberals are always first in line to try to restrict the
[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:26.920]  first amendment rights of others and I want to say a word about these other
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:32.640]  spineless GOP candidates you know instead of exploiting this situation to
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:36.760]  try to prop up their failing campaigns what they ought to be doing is standing
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:40.800]  up and saying you know we may not agree with everything Trump says we may not
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:45.760]  even like the way he says it but we are standing in solidarity with his first
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:50.200]  amendment rights they won't do that because they're too weak to do that which is why
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:52.840]  they're losing
[02:18:55.640 --> 02:18:59.520]  and that's why they push all those weak political candidates is because they
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:03.080]  will bend over they will lay down they will sell out they think it's cute they
[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:07.440]  think it's fine they don't believe in you they don't believe in freedom they
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:12.360]  want to silence everyone and if they can silence Trump they can silence
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:18.000]  everybody the good news is the people are waking up to it they're seeing through
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.560]  it in a big way that's a strong video but I'm telling you it's nothing compared
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:25.200]  to the two Paul Watson videos that are also linked to the same story at info

[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:24.840]  teleprompter free talking point free this is it mel in Costa Rica you're on
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:30.640]  the year worldwide thanks for calling Wow mr. Alex Jones it's been since 1999
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:34.840]  that I've been trying to talk with you it's unbelievable I'm very excited right
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:38.800]  now very emotional to tell you truth I gotta I've been listening to you
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:43.360]  religiously my friend forever I tell everybody listen to you there is no
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:47.280]  new world order in Costa Rica if there is one I could tell you the cops do not
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:53.280]  enforce it okay Donald Trump is cough and nails to the new world order there's
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:58.000]  no question about I hope they don't kill him I hope he wears a helmet on his
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:01.240]  head because they might take a shot and go for his head let me tell you
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:05.720]  something there's a movement going on in the United States it almost makes me
[02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:09.040]  want to move back to the United States for like six months out of the year as
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:13.960]  long as Trump is in power but I'll tell you what mr. Jones they're going to do
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:17.320]  everything in the book to try and derail him they're gonna come up with every
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:20.240]  dirty trick in the book let me tell you something when they come up with
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:27.520]  something like hey you know they his wife throws naked who would you rather
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:32.880]  picture naked her or Barbara Bush right for example also it's all selective he
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:36.400]  doesn't hide any of that that's why evangelicals are voting he goes because
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:39.640]  he doesn't do back like a fake Christian he is a Christian he's not a Pharisee
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:43.040]  though who does all this evil stuff secretly but then acts pious in public
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:47.480]  he says hey they don't like Ted Cruz because he's a liar and so that's what
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:52.440]  it comes down to is that people got to understand that you know Hillary is
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:55.800]  literally funding jihad he's to kill hundreds of thousands of Christians and
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:26:00.120]  and you know Hillary's got all these girlfriends that'll never be an issue but
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:03.440]  the fact that Trump's been divorced and that Trump said girlfriends when he was
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:08.120]  divorced or that he you know dated playboy playmates big deal and I'm not
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:11.760]  pushing that as something I want my daughter to do but I know this I'd much
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:16.600]  rather you know Mike you know something like that than my daughter be out there
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:21.240]  say working on an abortuary you know there's scales of all this none of us
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:26.040]  are perfect we want to love God we want to be good but we don't sit there using
[02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:29.800]  it as a way it's like Christian political correctness there's all these
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:35.360]  social justice warrior Christians that kind of pull correctness comes out of
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:39.800]  who go around hin pecking everybody men and women about how good they are
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:45.160]  policing your speech or your behavior or how you act they ought to get the beam
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:48.760]  out of their eye first brother so what do you think they'll happen if they do
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:54.520]  assassinate Trump because I'll just be honest I think there's about a 70% chance
[02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:57.960]  somebody's gonna take a shot at him I think there's about a 40 50% chance
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:01.600]  they're gonna kill him I really he's for real there's no doubt I think they're
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:04.920]  gonna try to kill him and I think there's a 70% chance somebody's gonna pull a
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:09.200]  trigger again 40 50% chance is gonna hit him and a good chance is gonna kill him
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:14.640]  what do you think well I hope not and I tell you what if even if he wins by
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:18.920]  overwhelming demand and they fix the voting machines because they are
[02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:23.040]  programmed by the government unfortunately and if you trust these voting
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:25.960]  machines you don't need you need to go to go get a checkup from the neck up
[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:30.200]  okay the reality is that I think that there'll be riots all over the United
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:37.280]  States like maybe times 10 or 20 what we saw in LA for Rodney King from coast
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:41.080]  to coast not just in that right then they'll activate black lives matter to
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:44.560]  go out and riot and they'll call it a race war you'll have Trumpians upset
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:48.840]  rioting in key areas and then you'll have the Soros activate to cause a civil
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:54.220]  war we do not want that by the way reports Trump left off some Florida
[02:27:54.220 --> 02:27:58.360]  ballots dozens of complaints that's from the Gateway pundit that's up on
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:02.440]  drudgereport.com and info wars.com right now good to hear from you Mel in
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:08.020]  Costa Rica yeah Costa Rica is a government globalist command base safe
[02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:12.280]  zone kind of like Switzerland I don't know if it'll be as good a Switzerland
[02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:15.320]  forever but the word is I need to get down there and check it out the word is
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:21.520]  is it is the cats meow of Central America but it's surrounded by collapsing
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:26.240]  third-world hells so good thing they got a strong border fence and good thing they
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:29.480]  picked folks up to try to work very legally because they don't want their
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:32.600]  country collapsing and their wages driven down I've studied Costa Rica but
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:35.920]  haven't been there quite frankly it's my next stop the next time I leave the
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:38.320]  United States that's where I'm going unless I gotta I may go cover
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:41.600]  Bilderberg I'm trying to decide right now my kids really need me and I kind of
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:45.520]  need to run the command base here I want to go cover Bilderberg I mean one of
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:48.800]  our reporters will I gotta have a meeting if I want to go I should have
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:52.120]  reporters fighting for that plum position we'll see what happens John and
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:56.480]  FEMA region three are on the year worldwide go ahead yeah how you doing
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:02.280]  Alex I'm doing all right brother hey listen I wanted to ask Gerald but you'd
[02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:06.080]  be just as good this first thing I want to say is that the Republicans are
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:11.160]  fully aware what was going on in Chicago of course they're all involved that's
[02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:14.320]  why they have the Republican leaders all come out from Ted Cruz to you name it
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:19.000]  say shame on Trump how dare them the Democrat Party thugs attack and the
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.360]  Republican leadership and Megan Kelly she is the best-looking transvestite I've
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:29.000]  ever seen gets up there on television and demonizes Trump can you believe that
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.200]  yeah well I'll tell you what really stunned me is that Friday night I was
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:38.200]  watching Fox Kelly show you know just to see what he had to say and she had
[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:42.960]  Rubio on the phone and he came out with it would sound like a preferred
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:46.480]  statement you know I'm gonna come back to you John this is a point I want to
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:53.160]  talk about we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:53.160 --> 02:30:01.940]  GCN radio network in a rather bizarre statement presidential candidate
[02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:06.560]  Hillary Clinton has said that the US didn't lose a single person in Libya
[02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:10.920]  which is to say the former Secretary of State is ignoring the murder of
[02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:15.760]  Ambassador Christopher Stevens now Libya is perfect isn't it Clinton said
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:20.040]  Libya was a different kind of calculation and we didn't lose a single
[02:30:20.040 --> 02:30:23.840]  person we didn't have a problem in supporting our European and Arab
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:27.960]  allies in working with NATO Mrs. Clinton conveniently skipped over the
[02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:33.040]  attack of September 11th 2012 of the diplomatic special mission compound in
[02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:37.440]  CIA annex in Benghazi the left ambassador Christopher Stevens foreign
[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:42.360]  management officer Sean Smith and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Smith and Glenn
[02:30:42.360 --> 02:30:47.280]  Doherty dead there's even a movie out about it called 13 hours and this isn't
[02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:50.920]  the first time Hillary has had a selective memory but what difference

[02:33:11.760 --> 02:33:26.540]  I'm going to go back to one of these calls then pop into dr. group for 10
[02:33:26.540 --> 02:33:29.980]  minutes then back to your calls and into some geopolitical news I need to hit
[02:33:29.980 --> 02:33:36.820]  but to answer my own question I asked Gerald Salinte a question that he
[02:33:36.820 --> 02:33:41.500]  answered excellently but I wanted to add to it last hour I said why in history
[02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:47.200]  when there's economic meltdown do you always see major powers go to war
[02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:52.000]  especially of both sides are having problems and it's because it makes the
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:56.000]  domestic groups shut up and not try to overthrow their own government because
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:59.160]  instead they're putting all their anger onto the other group and all the young
[02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:03.480]  men are getting killed or maimed battling the other groups young men
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:08.240]  there's famous letters between you know different kings in Europe there's one
[02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:13.280]  between the king of France and the king of England where they talk about yeah
[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:19.080]  we're having some uprising some issues it's time for another war and it
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:25.000]  consolidates power and it destroys surplus equipment so you've got to buy
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:29.720]  more equipment you got to go deeper in debt when you enter these perfect storms
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:32.600]  though like before World War one or World War two and almost all historians agree
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:36.200]  we're in that that sector right now the most dangerous time to ever be alive
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:40.120]  because the weapons we now have Pentagon says that the minute Ministry of
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:46.360]  Defense says that in England it's also that the political class is basically an
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:50.120]  oligarchy it's a big group of thieves at the top who kind of decide things by
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:56.720]  consensus and board meetings at Davos Bilderberg you name it now the public
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:01.040]  knows those consensus meetings are going on they never even wanted to have that
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:07.040]  discussion as if they didn't even exist now people are discussing the elites now
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:10.840]  we can look at how they're exempt from taxes and regulations so that's a huge
[02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:15.560]  victory but the other big factor that's entered into this equation into this
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:23.840]  calculus is that when a system's coming to an end or when major changes are
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:26.880]  happening at the end of a cycle or the beginning of a cycle it's pretty much the
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:30.960]  same point you can't tell when you're ending and when you're beginning until
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:33.760]  you've already gone out of it but we're definitely in the major time of change
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:39.880]  right now pretty deep into it I'd say a third in and with the acceleration of
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:43.880]  time compression because of technology and everything and the move towards the
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:49.720]  mathematical gravity of a singularity because we're entering into that and
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:54.200]  it's compressing time and change it might be a year might be five years but
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:58.360]  it's it's moving quick whereas previously changed like this would take 20
[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:02.160]  years might take five years might take a year might take a month who knows it's
[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:08.280]  accelerating is all we know we're in uncharted territory and so the other big
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:12.880]  factor is that there's so many special interests that have these consortium
[02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:18.160]  meetings it's hard to find the head to ever stop it that's a strength of it
[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:22.880]  for its system but it's also a weakness because the consortiums are fake and they
[02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:28.600]  all stab each other in the back more and more as the system destabilizes so
[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:32.480]  they're all stealing everything back stabbing each other many of them are
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:35.680]  running for the hills I told you that six seven years ago folks that I was a
[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:38.640]  fear monger now it's all over the news that a leacher building bunkers and
[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:41.440]  moving to the middle of nowhere and digging in and building offshore
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:48.080]  pleasure palaces and their own private armies because they know the mountain of
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:54.240]  TNT we're sitting on top of historically and politically so you add that factor in
[02:36:54.240 --> 02:36:57.840]  that's a real wild card and and so that's why it's gonna look like they're
[02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:03.400]  confident doing wilder and wilder things stealing openly openly announcing all
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:07.480]  this evil that's not a sign of strength folks it's a sign of weakness that
[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:12.520]  they're just busy going okay forget it steal all we can as they get their
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:19.880]  private jets warmed up these elites have jets warm 24 hours a day with crews with
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:24.400]  containers just full of diamonds and emeralds and art and and and just all
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:28.800]  sorts of stuff I mean it's admitted they are now in panic mode that's in the
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:34.840]  news now with their jets warmed up with the helicopters ready for nuclear war
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:40.720]  bio war total collapse power outages asteroids I don't know but they're
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:44.120]  acting like it's the end of the world now I'm gonna go Dr. Group here in just a
[02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:47.320]  moment but finishing up with John in Famer Region 3 because he was mentioning
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:50.000]  it I should have talked about this or told my crew to work on it but we can
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:56.400]  only do so much I've seen Casey I've seen Soros I've seen with the but on the
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:01.080]  subject Republicans I've seen Cruz I've seen Rubio I've seen them all come out
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:06.520]  and criticize Trump for Chicago when he didn't say or did they cancelled his
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:11.040]  event they cancelled his free speech with threats he did nothing his rhetoric's
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:16.320]  not incendiary it's like can you believe Alex Jones is against open borders it's
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:21.640]  so evil can you believe Alex Jones is against screen doors on submarines they
[02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:26.480]  just invert reality so I wanted you to be able to finish up is I actually heard
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:31.560]  the rubio call you're talking about on XM Fox go ahead
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:37.920]  people got speaking you couldn't see him because he was on the phone so I would
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:43.120]  think that he was reading off a paper but not more than a minute later after he
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:49.440]  got off the phone they had a live feed from a hotel in Chicago with Cruz came
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:55.280]  out first thing out of his mouth was the exact same rhetoric exactly they had
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:59.600]  him already while Chicago was happening that's the tell to tell you the first
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:04.960]  story to spend it that it was Trump's fault all concerted that was the turning
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:10.360]  point for me I mean that was really absolutely stunning to me so so so you
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:13.920]  saw toto pull back the curtain that was that was the final piece of evidence for
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:20.600]  you yep I actually saw the man behind the curtain and I don't like it so tell
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:23.360]  me were you liking Cruz before but when you saw him in a concerted effort with
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:29.720]  Rubio you saw it well you know back a couple years ago when they had the shut
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:34.600]  down of the government and Cruz and failing around there at the shut down
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:40.240]  veterans memorial in Washington you know he seemed pretty good to me you know and
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:46.880]  then the Bundy thing happened and everybody ran everybody ran away from
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:52.280]  that like they had the plague whether it should have been supporting them Cruz did
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:56.240]  a lot of really great stuff and and that's why I ignored the CFR stuff and
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:39:59.920]  the rest of it I said I was concerned but now the stuff he's doing if he wasn't
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:03.560]  bad before he's made a really bad turn and he may rehabilitate himself and
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:07.280]  still be a good senator and make some good votes but if he tries to steal the
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:10.960]  election when he doesn't have as many delegates from Trump he is committing
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:16.000]  political suicide my view God bless you John thanks for calling now we talk
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:20.720]  about the big scene of things but we also talk about what's happening down
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:23.880]  here on the ground individually and that's why I've got him coming on today
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:29.720]  because I saw this article yesterday and I was well aware of this fact
[02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:37.280]  obviously and so were you but to see it in Bloomberg business and to see that
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:45.160]  it's two of the biggest drug companies saying it and Chicago researchers and
[02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:48.840]  top genetic genome project group of the federal government I mean it's just
[02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:53.320]  group of group coming out saying biggest discovery ever we discovered it
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:56.800]  they're saying give us prizes most cancer is being caused because your
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:01.640]  autoimmune system is shutting off in the gut it's like HIV if your muses is
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:08.080]  already run down you get it and then your body basically stops fighting it
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:11.800]  attacks your T lymphocytes that are the program cells that go out and tell folks
[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:16.640]  who the enemy is they're basically generals takes out your generals and
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:22.360]  your colonels down to your majors but the gut is the is the major front line and
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:26.640]  so when it turns off and stops communicating with the rest of the
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:29.440]  body and stops communicating with the white blood cells in the brain it's
[02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:33.920]  came over folks they knew this thousands of years ago I quoted Anthony quoted
[02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:37.640]  apocrates we get the Hippocratic oath do no harm they quit giving that 10 years
[02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:40.600]  ago by the way about 12 years ago no more no more Hippocratic oath for the
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:44.920]  doctors ought to be a red flag for folks and I just thought about group who's
[02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:49.520]  been the strongest person out there talk about the studies the research the facts
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:56.360]  about the gut and then I thought about and how are we doing Nico getting the
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:00.840]  medical doctor on who they famously dental deep yes dr. Wakefield who lives
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:05.000]  in Austin who did study showing that it autism was being caused by the gut
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:10.360]  shutting off and then he found vaccine derivatives in the stomach antibodies
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:15.040]  and that that was linked to it and then it was toxic poisoning the brain well
[02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:19.000]  point is there's now hundreds of big studies coming out proving it they've
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:24.400]  always known they've been trying to cover it up and groups been proven correct
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:27.720]  yet again now it's not just probiotics that are needed and we're gonna come out
[02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:31.600]  with one soon we're working on it years of group we want to have the super you
[02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:35.800]  know the very best but whatever you do there's a lot of brands out there will
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:39.760]  get his expert if you don't want he thinks is good but I had died I'm gonna
[02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:43.400]  show you the studies is just as important with the thyroid ordering the
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:47.600]  stomach to basically turn on and activate now that's in layman Dumbo terms and
[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:51.720]  about the group break it down for you but how gut bacteria are shaking up
[02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:55.640]  cancer research is the Bloomberg article and it goes right through word for word
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:42:59.080]  what group and all these others have been saying forever and of course
[02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:02.040]  Bill and Melinda Gates are obsessed with it they're heavily researching it they
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:05.400]  know what they're doing and a lot of stuff's killing your gut floor it's the
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:10.000]  pesticides the roundups the big one this is all been engineered my question to
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  group first is congratulations being right yet again because this is what you
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:19.080]  mainly focus on but also why are they now admitting it when we know these
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:22.680]  studies have been going on forever what's the sea change there it's like two
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:27.560]  weeks ago the New York Times said most cancers from viruses as if they discovered
[02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:30.440]  that it's been known for a hundred years and they're actually putting it in the
[02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:34.520]  vaccine we've caught them so so what do you think's happening here dr. Group well
[02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:38.640]  I think they're being forced to join the bandwagon because they see the amount of
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:42.280]  money that's being made in the organic industry and in the natural health care
[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:46.560]  industry and they know that we're all putting lots of money and lots of time
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:51.040]  and lots of effort into educating the public I mean Hippocrates also said all
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:56.040]  disease begins in the in the gut when I came out with my first book back in the
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:44:00.920]  late 90s it was called health begins in the colon well disease also begins in the
[02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:05.800]  gut because we spent two years researching the root cause of all disease
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:10.760]  cancer illness and we came back to the general conclusion that it's all caused
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:15.120]  by all these chemicals and toxins and GMOs and high fructose corn syrup and
[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:21.120]  pesticide residue and guess what it all ends up coming and leaking through the
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:26.320]  gut into your body that's how all disease happens so what's amazing to me
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:31.480]  reading the Bloomberg article yesterday or the day before when it came out here
[02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:35.320]  you have pharmaceutical companies investing hundreds of millions of
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:40.920]  dollars into probiotics but they're still missing the root cause you still
[02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:44.280]  have to address the root cause of the illness it doesn't matter if you have
[02:44:44.280 --> 02:44:48.520]  the best probiotics in the world which by the way you mentioned we've been
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:53.720]  working on some amazing technology that you're gonna be the first our company
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:56.440]  and your company is going to be the first ones in the world to come out with
[02:44:56.440 --> 02:45:04.680]  this new probiotic formula which has strains from 10,000 years ago we were
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:08.280]  able to get some from up into bed in the Himalayan Mountains which I'm
[02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:14.000]  extremely excited about but it all boils back to how the gut reacts with
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:17.800]  everything else in the body and the gut is just a pipe it's the outside I mean
[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:22.320]  what you take in through the food and the beverages that you consume on a
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:27.560]  daily basis the stuff that's not supposed to go into your body is supposed to go
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:32.160]  out the other end the gut is just a tube it's 35 feet long if you were to take it
[02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:36.120]  out and cut it open it would be the size of a tennis court but what the
[02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:40.600]  pharmaceutical companies and the doctors and by the way big pharma and the
[02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:45.480]  medical profession this was the the highly guarded secret to health they
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:50.560]  did not want you to figure out that if you heal the gut you heal the body so
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:54.080]  what do I call this video so people we put on YouTube and Facebook will care
[02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:59.960]  about themselves biggest you know medical tyranny secret exposed elite
[02:45:59.960 --> 02:46:04.000]  scared that this secret has finally gotten out because as you know we've
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:08.360]  documented on our long shows Bill and Melinda Gates the elite they're obsessed
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:12.840]  they're all taking probiotics that's how it leaked out they know it's the
[02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:17.240]  roundup they know it's the autism they know it's everything and they're doing
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:20.680]  everything they can to shut this down this is a big victory that it's all
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:27.680]  coming out now so in a normal human you have a hundred trillion let's say
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:32.240]  organisms that are good that are friendly that are actually fighting for
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:36.840]  you it's the army within your own body well it's a planet they're the buffers
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:41.120]  that live in all the nooks and crannies so bad bacteria and bad viruses can't
[02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:46.400]  move in when they all get wiped out the bad guys now have homes and that's
[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:49.960]  exactly what they do with the high fructose corn syrup and everything else
[02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:54.560]  in the food and the preservatives and everything what's killing our guts and
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:59.200]  on top of probiotics what are some of the better brands how important is the
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:02.800]  nascent iodine because that is a plug it's a win-win folks this is really the
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:05.760]  other part of the equation just as important according to you and others
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:10.880]  as the probiotics itself the thyroid the nerves the gut if the fluoride's in
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:13.920]  there it can't communicate properly explain that to folks well that's
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:18.480]  another that's another attack with the toxic halogens because the gut if you
[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:22.200]  look at it is the largest endocrine gland and we talk all the time about the
[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:27.120]  attack on the endocrine system which is the thyroid the pineal the parathyroid
[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:35.320]  the pancreas the ovaries the breast the testicular functioning in males all of
[02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:39.800]  these endocrine glands the glandular system is what's being attacked and
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:44.760]  there's a connection there and without iodine iodine is necessary for all of
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:48.520]  our glands in the endocrine system to function so what they do is they put
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:53.560]  fluoride chlorine bromide in the water in the food supply which shuts down our
[02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:58.960]  glandular function as a matter of fact estrogen itself limits the absorption of
[02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:04.200]  iodine so with all the Zeno estrogens too so iodine is an important part and
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:07.400]  that's what they're forgetting you know you have to have you can't just have
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:12.520]  probiotics without all the other things working in in unison as well they'll
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:15.920]  probably end up maybe putting some iodine in with the probiotics but it's
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:22.640]  an essential factor for a functioning endocrine system if you if you don't have
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:26.960]  the proper amount of iodine in your body then your thyroid is malfunctioning
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:32.240]  then your pancreas is malfunctioning your gut is malfunctioning T3 and T4
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:36.680]  which are produced by the thyroid have been shown to protect the gut and
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:43.360]  mucosal lining to protect it from leaky gut syndrome Hashimoto's has been
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:49.360]  associated with a leaky gut so thyroid mental everything is linked to the gut
[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:52.920]  I mean the Russians and the Germans knew that years ago and they analyzed the
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:57.760]  appendix which our medical system still says the appendix is useless they found
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:02.080]  that the appendix is the brain of the body and the brain is actually located
[02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:07.000]  at the small intestine and large intestine juncture the appendix is the
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:12.040]  micro computer it actually sends relays and messages to the endocrine the
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:17.480]  neurological the lymphatic all of the systems in the body so every single thing
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:24.480]  is regulated in the gut your immune system your serotonin dopamine production
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:31.720]  for the brain the T lymphocytes the everything that you can think of so and
[02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:37.200]  that's usually functioned by and controlled by the amount of probiotics
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:41.520]  that you have inside the gut and that's why I think that the pharmaceutical
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:46.360]  companies are realizing that they finally have to go down that path that's
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:50.200]  what they're doing I mean look at Bloomberg coming out with the article
[02:49:50.200 --> 02:49:54.800]  on probiotics and cancer so it is the main thing well what's happening is
[02:49:54.800 --> 02:50:01.720]  mainstream media mainstream science is literally coming out and confirming
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:05.440]  everything that you and a bunch of other medical doctors and the top experts on
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:10.160]  the show have said for the last 20 years not just saying something similar with
[02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:15.800]  major huge studies at the human genome project in the Chicago Medical Center and
[02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:20.340]  all of it saying the exact thing you have been saying which is what the
[02:50:20.340 --> 02:50:25.600]  ancients said which is what is just been known and so congratulations to
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:31.320]  everybody this is another huge victory and folks obviously you need probiotics
[02:50:31.320 --> 02:50:35.600]  and you need to get a group you talk about the pickled foods let's talk
[02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:37.880]  about some of the foods folks get at the grocery store it's not just about
[02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:43.040]  buying our products that also help with the gut but again folks you can't lose
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:47.880]  the weight group told me you're gonna lose weight you're going to tan better
[02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:51.960]  without tan spots watch it I got an eye-dye that for six months I didn't

[02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:30.080]  Knight coming up they have put glyphosate in the food and water by the folks look
[02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:33.560]  up worldwide amount of glyphosate use since the 70s I forget it's something
[02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:37.600]  like it's something like sets in such million billion tons and I couldn't
[02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:40.400]  even believe the number when I've seen it on the news and stuff so I don't want
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:45.560]  to get it wrong and it's just designed to turn mammals off and give us cancer
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:50.120]  it's designed to kill our guts they're finding that farm animals are getting
[02:54:50.120 --> 02:54:56.680]  sick that eat corn and stuff raised with the roundup they won't give this stuff
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:55:01.920]  to show cattle and show horses because they're not healthy they won't give
[02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:11.120]  vaccines now veterinarians to their own animals except maybe once this is a
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:14.080]  revolution against this medical oppression there are a lot of good
[02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:19.280]  things in Western medicine but it's been taken over and the fact is every day I
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:23.880]  see top news admitting and coming out with the studies they already had going
[02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:28.680]  okay you're right it's true group what are the good ways to get probiotics what
[02:55:28.680 --> 02:55:31.960]  do you think the best brands are obviously you've been super neurotic we've
[02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:35.240]  checked into it and in a good way you are coming out with stuff that people
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:38.280]  basically only get medical clinics in Germany and stuff kind of bring it to
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:41.960]  the public it's gonna have ice bags with it and stuff we ship it to people but
[02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:45.840]  it's next level stuff but separate from that because I want to know what's the
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:48.680]  best brands for me to take I'm taking a couple different ones I give them to the
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:53.360]  kids and then what other foods are good to eat and then how important is the
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:57.760]  iodine in closing because it mean it really is the supercharger yeah okay so
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:03.120]  as far as the best probiotics to take I mean I I spent seven years putting
[02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:07.360]  together the product that we currently have called fluorotrex and yours the
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:10.680]  one that we're going to be coming out with is even going to be better it has
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:16.360]  50 billion organisms that are live inside the formula and it's 18 different
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:19.880]  strains we're gonna add an additional six strains and then we're also gonna add
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:24.960]  that unique those unique strains that we got from high up in the Himalayas so
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:29.280]  that's available right now you should have yours in stock probably I'm hoping
[02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:33.600]  in the next few months as well and that's something everybody should take on a
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:39.480]  regular basis as far as just getting good probiotics naturally good organic raw
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:45.160]  foods and then fermented foods kombucha is great organic apple cider vinegar
[02:56:45.160 --> 02:56:51.480]  any type of fermented food yogurts I want I do recommend that if you are going
[02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:55.600]  to take in any type of yogurt cottage cheese anything like that that you use
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:57:01.320]  a certified organic source and move forward with that and as far as iodine
[02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:06.640]  is concerned yes it's all about teaching people how to heal themselves and you
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:09.960]  can have one thing this is why the pharmaceutical companies will never be
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:13.320]  successful at this even though they're jumping on the bandwagon to do these
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:17.000]  probiotics they're still not telling people to eliminate the high fructose
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:20.800]  corn syrup to eliminate all the pesticide residue in their food so they're
[02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:24.360]  gonna take the probiotics and they're just gonna be killed off by all the
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:29.480]  things that are in so so stay away from the GMO but bare minimum you know things
[02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:33.680]  like shower crowd kombucha you know let your kids eat dirt folks so that's why
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:37.920]  kids that don't are so sick now again x2 nasa and I and I and why is it the best
[02:57:37.920 --> 02:57:41.040]  form of iodine from our research and and why is it so important and why did it
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:44.520]  make me lose so much weight why did I get better suntans with it and you said
[02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:48.800]  that I thought you were crazy what does it do to me well first of all we have a
[02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:52.800]  every single person in the world right now has a hormone problem and that means
[02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:57.240]  they have alterations in their estrogen testosterone progesterone whatever it's
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:58:01.920]  not like you know five out of ten people have that we all are being attacked
[02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:05.840]  including me on our endocrine glands and those are your hormone producing
[02:58:05.840 --> 02:58:11.200]  glands so iodine is the number one mineral and nutrient that will help
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:15.480]  detoxify the fluoride the chlorine and the bromine and it'll actually help
[02:58:15.480 --> 02:58:20.880]  repair your glandular tissue so when you help when you have a functioning
[02:58:20.880 --> 02:58:24.680]  endocrine system which means your thyroid is functioning good your gut is
[02:58:24.680 --> 02:58:28.120]  functioning well you're able to break down foods and everything is
[02:58:28.120 --> 02:58:33.440]  synergistically combining to where you're healthy you end up losing

[03:00:36.440 --> 03:00:42.840]  final calls here but there is a new article up on info wars dot com this
[03:00:42.840 --> 03:00:45.920]  news came out a day ago day but night covered on the nightly news but was
[03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:50.760]  just buried in a headline that the private federal reserve employees and the
[03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:56.400]  federal reserve is endorsing Hillary and giving her the union money well the
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:01:00.480]  real angle there is the federal reserve gave zero to trump and gave money to
[03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:05.160]  Hillary and Cruz here's the headline in full wars dot com fellow reserve funds
[03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:13.640]  Hillary and Cruz but not trump again federal reserve funds Hillary and Cruz
[03:01:13.640 --> 03:01:19.200]  but not trump fed gives 18,000 to Clinton 2000 to Cruz and zero to Trump
[03:01:19.200 --> 03:01:25.800]  which is why everybody that supports Ron Paul should not support Donald Trump
[03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:31.680]  no you should support Donald Trump the elite have now hit total pull their hair
[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:36.600]  out run around like chickens with their heads cut off this is so obvious max in

[03:01:57.200 --> 03:01:59.800]  on the phone with you but I know that there's going to be other callers and you
[03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:02.320]  want to be even four or five minutes before David Knight comes on so I'm more
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:06.040]  up to the chase right sure so things look you know what we're in the middle of a
[03:02:06.040 --> 03:02:10.560]  yeah in the middle of a spiritual battle right between good and evil and I can
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:14.480]  help you up on all this stuff many years ago and I studied a research of many
[03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:17.960]  many great people you know about the standing Monty and he was one of two
[03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:20.680]  people who understood that this was a spiritual battle not just you know
[03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:24.600]  economically political or whatever but the main guy who I studied and what
[03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:28.160]  one that's what everything from was she ever griffin and he's been on a program
[03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:31.440]  a few times and he's not beyond for a few years now somewhere this is what I
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:34.360]  basically want to talk to you about you know I'm no offense yeah I like it she
[03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:38.200]  ever griffin on he's a good guy and a friend he's kind of retired so he got a
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:42.680]  twist his arm to get him on let's get you ever griffin on this week or next week
[03:02:42.680 --> 03:02:47.760]  absolutely the creature of Jekyll Island a great guy we should definitely get him
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:52.160]  on the broadcast what do you think about people all over the world waking up to
[03:02:52.160 --> 03:02:57.080]  globalism for me it's just corporate colonialism and corporate exploitation
[03:02:57.080 --> 03:03:02.840]  blaming free market capitalism when really it's a form of monopoly so India
[03:03:02.840 --> 03:03:07.960]  kicked out the the colonialist you know when will America kick out the
[03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:12.240]  globalist max no no no listen listen listen listen because the same problems
[03:03:12.240 --> 03:03:16.480]  here that you guys have over there and listen I mean I know they I know global
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:19.520]  came back I mean I know they came back but it's just another form of the same
[03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:24.520]  thing well we have the false right and the false left
[03:03:24.520 --> 03:03:28.200]  it's the same thing the exact same thing but our point is you know what and in a
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:31.160]  way it's a false that's right paradigm but in a way it's not there is a real
[03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:35.320]  right versus left it's individualism versus connectivism and that's the key
[03:03:35.320 --> 03:03:38.760]  you see the point is they are an ideological warrior the guys who are
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:42.880]  opposing us the only way to beat them is to defeat them ideologically because
[03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:47.240]  all they got going for them is ideology that's it it's an info war it is
[03:03:47.240 --> 03:03:50.920]  ideology and that's why they want to shut our speech down worldwide from Europe
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:54.760]  to India to the United States God bless you I appreciate your call and that's
[03:03:54.760 --> 03:04:01.320]  why I'm so opposed to Islam I've had Arab friends Muslim friends Islam has had
[03:04:01.320 --> 03:04:04.800]  periods in its time when it was actually less barbaric than Europe that's just a
[03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:07.840]  fact I did have a couple hundred year period where it was a force for good but
[03:04:07.840 --> 03:04:11.520]  radical Islam has basically taken Islam over just like radical left has taken the
[03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:17.120]  Democrats over and it's a global program and radical left is working with the
[03:04:17.120 --> 03:04:21.480]  megabanks and radical jihadists to bully everybody's free speech and I'm not
[03:04:21.480 --> 03:04:25.280]  putting up with it and we're gonna defend Christianity we're gonna defend
[03:04:25.280 --> 03:04:28.680]  everybody else's religion I mean you talk about India we look the Muslims who
[03:04:28.680 --> 03:04:32.800]  over there bullying the Hindus and others it's just out of control and they
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:36.360]  try to brand it as racist that Trump is against radical Muslims coming in
[03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:40.680]  India doesn't want them Japan won't let them in not one Muslims led into Japan
[03:04:40.680 --> 03:04:45.760]  for a reason they're not putting up with it because Islam doesn't put up with
[03:04:45.760 --> 03:04:50.520]  other people's freedoms anymore it's a tyranny hey David Knight's coming up I'm

[03:08:28.720 --> 03:08:33.240]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this
[03:08:33.240 --> 03:08:38.800]  Tuesday March 15th 2016 of course today we'll begin the winner take all
[03:08:38.800 --> 03:08:44.680]  primaries we have five primaries today they are going to be most of winter take
[03:08:44.680 --> 03:08:47.680]  most if not winter take all the only one that's truly proportional to North
[03:08:47.680 --> 03:08:51.360]  Carolina and of course actually should say there are six contests one of them
[03:08:51.360 --> 03:08:57.000]  has already taken place and that is in the northern Mariana Islands Donald
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:03.720]  Trump won 73% of the vote there he got all nine delegates and looks like it's
[03:09:03.720 --> 03:09:08.760]  going to be that type of night tonight as well the only state that appears to
[03:09:08.760 --> 03:09:11.640]  be according to the early polls the only state that appears to be in play
[03:09:11.640 --> 03:09:15.400]  assuming that the ballots aren't going to be stuffed and we'll talk about that
[03:09:15.400 --> 03:09:21.120]  the only state that appears to be legitimately in play is Ohio now they've
[03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:25.120]  made a big deal about the fact that this is Kasek's comeback because it's not so
[03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:29.160]  much a case it is going up in the polls but it's that Rubio is crashing and
[03:09:29.160 --> 03:09:34.520]  burning big time if we were to look at this as a sporting contest as I mentioned
[03:09:34.520 --> 03:09:37.800]  last night this is kind of like the final four you know I'm from North Carolina
[03:09:37.800 --> 03:09:41.760]  we always heard about the final four March Madness the NCAA tournament
[03:09:41.760 --> 03:09:46.000]  imagine if you had four teams of the final four and only one of them even
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:52.240]  had a winning record okay that's what we got tonight okay 27 states territories
[03:09:52.240 --> 03:09:58.400]  so far Kasek is 0 and 27 and we're supposed to take him seriously as a
[03:09:58.400 --> 03:10:04.840]  contender okay even if he wins tonight in Ohio and loses the rest of these he
[03:10:04.840 --> 03:10:13.440]  will have a record of one win 31 losses one win and 31 losses only in the game
[03:10:13.440 --> 03:10:17.520]  of politics is that something that people can hold up with a straight face and
[03:10:17.520 --> 03:10:20.800]  say well we're going to continue to soldier on of course when he was back
[03:10:20.800 --> 03:10:24.920]  in New Hampshire remember he invested a great deal of time in New Hampshire
[03:10:24.920 --> 03:10:29.440]  unlike Chris Christie who spent a lot of time there and did not do well he said
[03:10:29.440 --> 03:10:34.080]  all right no this isn't the time for me Kasek just kept going and he'd said to
[03:10:34.080 --> 03:10:37.080]  everybody if I don't pull it out here with all the time and money that I've
[03:10:37.080 --> 03:10:41.440]  spent here in New Hampshire is over folks well it wasn't over for him and now he
[03:10:41.440 --> 03:10:47.120]  thinks that he's you're gonna see if he wins Ohio tonight because he only has to
[03:10:47.120 --> 03:10:52.000]  win narrowly to get all the delegates you are going to see all the ticker tape
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:57.640]  parades down Wall Street for him through Fox News for him they're gonna be rolling
[03:10:57.640 --> 03:11:02.760]  out the red carpet there you're gonna see a Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes
[03:11:02.760 --> 03:11:07.440]  blowing the trumpets alongside the red carpet for him let's take a look at these
[03:11:07.440 --> 03:11:12.880]  other guys okay you got Rubio 3 and 24 record okay plus he won the district of
[03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:16.240]  Columbia of course he would win the district of Columbia all the status
[03:11:16.240 --> 03:11:21.520]  okay Rubio is gonna have to do major ballot stuffing and all kinds of games
[03:11:21.520 --> 03:11:26.640]  in Florida just to save enough face so that he doesn't have a career ending
[03:11:26.640 --> 03:11:31.320]  embarrassment that's what he's got in front of him is he gonna be so embarrassed
[03:11:31.320 --> 03:11:35.000]  that's the question tonight is Rubio gonna be so embarrassed is he gonna get a
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:40.160]  third or fourth place finish in Florida so that that's essentially the end of
[03:11:40.160 --> 03:11:45.200]  his career the guy has it's not a height issue it's a stature issue and he's
[03:11:45.200 --> 03:11:50.600]  lost his stature then you got Ted Cruz now here's the real contender we're told
[03:11:50.600 --> 03:11:57.200]  okay he's got a win-loss record of eight and 18 okay eight and 18 now what's
[03:11:57.200 --> 03:12:00.280]  gonna happen after tonight let's look at the delegate counts because it's not
[03:12:00.280 --> 03:12:04.840]  just the up to this point the delegates have been awarded proportionally some of
[03:12:04.840 --> 03:12:08.520]  them will still be awarded proportionally after tonight to some degree and of
[03:12:08.520 --> 03:12:12.520]  course even when the delegates were awarded proportionally in South
[03:12:12.520 --> 03:12:17.920]  Carolina Donald Trump got all 50 delegates in South Carolina they
[03:12:17.920 --> 03:12:23.920]  awarded them it was a winner-take-all by each congressional district and Donald
[03:12:23.920 --> 03:12:27.160]  Trump won all of the delegates in South Carolina and of course that could
[03:12:27.160 --> 03:12:30.040]  happen tonight the states that we really need to look at are going to be
[03:12:30.040 --> 03:12:35.640]  Illinois and Missouri those will really determine which path we are on tonight
[03:12:35.640 --> 03:12:42.560]  is a fork in the road and the question is do we move down the road where the
[03:12:42.560 --> 03:12:46.640]  voters have a say or are we gonna take the fork in the road where the
[03:12:46.640 --> 03:12:51.000]  establishment changes the rules where the establishment picks the winner
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:55.040]  that's really what we're looking at tonight because tonight depending on how
[03:12:55.040 --> 03:13:00.720]  this goes Donald Trump could sock it away or put himself so far out in front
[03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:04.160]  that it is essentially mathematically impossible for the other guys to catch
[03:13:04.160 --> 03:13:08.720]  him let me explain how this works tonight for example if John Kasich were
[03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:15.200]  to win Ohio tonight and get the 60 or so delegates that are there all right he
[03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:19.200]  would still need after tonight because he's gonna lose these other other states
[03:13:19.200 --> 03:13:24.880]  and that's going to be 358 delegates that's one third of the delegates needed
[03:13:24.880 --> 03:13:29.000]  to win the GOP nomination going to be awarded tonight and he's only going to
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:33.760]  get one state of those about 60 delegates or so he would need to get
[03:13:33.760 --> 03:13:37.040]  John Kasich would need to get a hundred and six percent of the delegates
[03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:43.480]  moving forward in order to legitimately win the nomination of course he's not
[03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:47.040]  looking to legitimately win the nomination he's looking for people like
[03:13:47.040 --> 03:13:53.440]  Mitt Romney to coronate him at a crooked convention you know I talked about the
[03:13:53.440 --> 03:13:58.960]  sports analogy you know what if we had a final four only one team has a winning
[03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:02.040]  record and they say yeah but you know what all these games up to this point
[03:14:02.040 --> 03:14:04.960]  they don't count you know just like little kids do that's what my son said
[03:14:04.960 --> 03:14:07.880]  this is like what the little kids do okay all right it doesn't matter we're
[03:14:07.880 --> 03:14:11.760]  gonna wipe out all these other contests anything and only this last one we're
[03:14:11.760 --> 03:14:15.240]  gonna have a sudden death contest sudden death over time that's what the
[03:14:15.240 --> 03:14:19.680]  convention that they want will be sudden death over time and the league which
[03:14:19.680 --> 03:14:25.560]  doesn't like this winning team and the referees are gonna conspire together to
[03:14:25.560 --> 03:14:29.760]  throw the flags to change the rules to make sure that somebody they pick wins
[03:14:29.760 --> 03:14:34.160]  that's what we're looking at moving forward from here if this doesn't work
[03:14:34.160 --> 03:14:37.640]  out tonight if this is a crash and burn but nobody expects that to happen
[03:14:37.640 --> 03:14:41.800]  unless there's massive fraud and there's evidence that there is a lot of fraud in
[03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:47.120]  Florida what a surprise surprise that there would be fraud in Florida in the
[03:14:47.120 --> 03:14:53.920]  republicans let's look at the situation tonight as 538 points out if Trump
[03:14:53.920 --> 03:14:58.120]  would win Florida Illinois Missouri and Ohio moving forward he would only need
[03:14:58.120 --> 03:15:04.400]  to pick up 44% of the remaining delegates that's a really low bar what if he
[03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:08.600]  loses Ohio but wins these other states wins Florida Illinois Missouri he would
[03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:15.320]  still only need 50% what if well and we're not even looking at Ted Cruz
[03:15:15.320 --> 03:15:18.560]  winning any states he might get some delegates tonight from North Carolina
[03:15:18.560 --> 03:15:22.240]  but if he doesn't win any delegates tonight then of course that's not going
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:25.840]  to be the case but just we don't know how that's going to be split in North
[03:15:25.840 --> 03:15:31.240]  Carolina but he would need moving forward Ted Cruz needs 83% of the
[03:15:31.240 --> 03:15:35.520]  delegates remaining to win do you see how this is looking do you see how
[03:15:35.520 --> 03:15:41.720]  ridiculous it is that the establishment continues to push this idea that they're
[03:15:41.720 --> 03:15:46.520]  going to that we really got a contest still going on here we got a contest
[03:15:46.520 --> 03:15:50.120]  because of things like this we got reports Gateway Pundit this is on
[03:15:50.120 --> 03:15:55.240]  Drudge Report Trump left off of some Florida ballots they left him off the
[03:15:55.240 --> 03:15:59.440]  ballots down Alex Jones talked about that earlier in the show we've got other
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:03.160]  places in Florida that it ran out of the ballots I guess they had a lot of
[03:16:03.160 --> 03:16:07.200]  pre-stuffing going on and so they've they've run out of ballots in a popca
[03:16:07.200 --> 03:16:12.000]  Florida several Orange County locations they've run out of Republican ballots
[03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:17.480]  that tells you two things folks it tells you that being Florida the first thing I
[03:16:17.480 --> 03:16:21.800]  would expect is that there's fraud going on but we know that there has been
[03:16:21.800 --> 03:16:26.640]  record voting going on everywhere because of who Donald Trump it's not
[03:16:26.640 --> 03:16:30.400]  going on because of John Kasich it's not going on because of Marco Rubio or Ted
[03:16:30.400 --> 03:16:35.600]  Cruz the record voting is because of Donald Trump and we're seeing massive
[03:16:35.600 --> 03:16:41.360]  movement of people moving from independent and from Democrat to voting
[03:16:41.360 --> 03:16:45.080]  in these primaries when they're allowed to that's why the only places that Ted
[03:16:45.080 --> 03:16:51.400]  Cruz is one are the closed caucuses where only people who have registered in
[03:16:51.400 --> 03:16:56.440]  advance as Republicans are allowed to vote and he's allowed to go in and work
[03:16:56.440 --> 03:17:00.400]  his magic like he did in Iowa telling people that Ben Carson was going to be
[03:17:00.400 --> 03:17:04.600]  dropping out that's the kind of that's the kind of candidate that Ted Cruz is
[03:17:04.600 --> 03:17:08.760]  also I thought this is very interesting we see Trump breaking 50% for the first
[03:17:08.760 --> 03:17:14.720]  time in national polls remember Carl Rove started this meme back in November
[03:17:14.720 --> 03:17:19.920]  and he said okay fine fine Trump is in first place but he only gets 30% 40%
[03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:24.040]  everywhere you go he's got a ceiling of 30 to 40% that's like well you know the
[03:17:24.040 --> 03:17:28.880]  problem with that Carl and I've mentioned this many times is that by the same
[03:17:28.880 --> 03:17:35.600]  logic the candidates that you support like Ted Cruz have a ceiling of 20%
[03:17:35.600 --> 03:17:40.800]  okay they don't ever say that the assumption is is that all these candidates
[03:17:40.800 --> 03:17:46.080]  are going to coalesce behind one of the establishment's favorites that hasn't
[03:17:46.080 --> 03:17:50.840]  happened it isn't going to happen they are people understand what is going on
[03:17:50.840 --> 03:17:56.240]  there is a massive move people understand as Pat Caddell points out the
[03:17:56.240 --> 03:17:59.640]  American people figured out they're being screwed they're being screwed by
[03:17:59.640 --> 03:18:05.040]  the establishment they're being screwed by these trade deals and here's one way
[03:18:05.040 --> 03:18:09.240]  to look at this the establishment knows who the outsider is look at the story
[03:18:09.240 --> 03:18:14.000]  the kid Daniels just put up on info wars.com the Federal Reserve funds Hillary
[03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:19.000]  and Cruz but not Trump now these are donations from Federal Reserve employees
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:24.920]  Federal Reserve employees have given $18,000 to Hillary Clinton $2,000 to
[03:18:24.920 --> 03:18:29.360]  Ted Cruz which is the most they've given to any Republican candidate and not a
[03:18:29.360 --> 03:18:34.960]  cent to Donald Trump and that's coming from Federal Election Commission data
[03:18:34.960 --> 03:18:39.440]  Donald Trump had pointed out back in February says it's very important to
[03:18:39.440 --> 03:18:43.040]  audit the Fed it's too bad that Ted Cruz missed the vote on audit the Fed look
[03:18:43.040 --> 03:18:49.080]  the Federal Reserve employees understand that Ted Cruz is no threat to their
[03:18:49.080 --> 03:18:53.240]  future employment it is going to be business as usual with the Federal
[03:18:53.240 --> 03:18:57.440]  Reserve it will be business as usual the IRS with the rest of the bureaucracy if
[03:18:57.440 --> 03:19:02.760]  Ted Cruz is getting in there not withstanding all of the speeches that
[03:19:02.760 --> 03:19:08.720]  he's made look there were articles in the National Review back in December
[03:19:08.720 --> 03:19:13.720]  criticizing Ted Cruz for repeating the phrase neocon labeling all these people
[03:19:13.720 --> 03:19:17.280]  as neocons and you know what the very people that he was labeling as neocons
[03:19:17.280 --> 03:19:23.120]  in December are now his inner circle of advisors on foreign policy they
[03:19:23.120 --> 03:19:26.760]  said you're calling us warmongers yeah they were people like John Bolton and
[03:19:26.760 --> 03:19:30.400]  others you're calling us near you're calling us warmongers and you're using
[03:19:30.400 --> 03:19:36.800]  this phrase neocon it's a pejorative it's a dog whistle to your base that's
[03:19:36.800 --> 03:19:42.320]  precisely the point that's what Ted Cruz does he does the data mining he throws
[03:19:42.320 --> 03:19:46.760]  out the dog whistles he climbs over the back of his colleagues to show himself
[03:19:46.760 --> 03:19:51.840]  as an outsider when he's the ultimate insider he now has these people as his
[03:19:51.840 --> 03:19:57.920]  supporters as his campaign donations the Jebs and the bushes are pulling in
[03:19:57.920 --> 03:20:01.360]  behind Ted Cruz status will be right back are you an unhappy timeshare owner
[03:20:01.360 --> 03:20:05.600]  have you ever asked yourself how can I get rid of my timeshare does your story
[03:20:05.600 --> 03:20:09.800]  go something like Stacy's story goes here's Stacy now my husband and I went
[03:20:09.800 --> 03:20:15.520]  and visited a resort and they kind of attacked us and they kept sending more
[03:20:15.520 --> 03:20:18.400]  and more people and so we finally said yes then we bought this timeshare and
[03:20:18.400 --> 03:20:21.600]  then we were stuck in this time here that we couldn't get rid of and we tried
[03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:25.520]  all different ways they made it seem like it was a really great deal and when
[03:20:25.520 --> 03:20:28.960]  we said no originally then they brought the price down and then when we still
[03:20:28.960 --> 03:20:32.560]  said no they brought in the manager and they brought the price down even lower
[03:20:32.560 --> 03:20:35.080]  and they started breaking in different ways to make it look like it was this
[03:20:35.080 --> 03:20:38.400]  really awesome deal the reality was it wasn't an awesome deal at all to

[03:24:09.600 --> 03:24:14.240]  and we're just talking about the fork in the road tonight this is a major decision
[03:24:14.240 --> 03:24:17.480]  tonight whether or not we are going to go down a crooked path to a rigged
[03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:21.720]  convention or whether or not the votes of the American people are really going
[03:24:21.720 --> 03:24:27.280]  to count what is this election about I think we can get a perspective on this
[03:24:27.280 --> 03:24:31.000]  sometimes by looking outside of ourselves let's take a look at this
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:37.280]  Brexit debate the will Britain exit the EU and of course this entered into the
[03:24:37.280 --> 03:24:40.920]  American news simply because it was a back-and-forth between Boris Johnson the
[03:24:40.920 --> 03:24:47.840]  mayor of London and Barack Obama basically then Boris Johnson told Obama
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:52.600]  to butt out of their internal politics and he had some interesting things to
[03:24:52.600 --> 03:24:58.640]  say he said of all the exorbitant hypocrisy for the U.S. to urge Britain to
[03:24:58.640 --> 03:25:03.440]  stay in the EU given that the U.S. defends its own sovereignty with
[03:25:03.440 --> 03:25:09.400]  hysterical vigilance I wish we did we're about to do that if we get Trump and his
[03:25:09.400 --> 03:25:13.480]  president we're going to defend our own sovereignty with hysterical vigilance
[03:25:13.480 --> 03:25:19.320]  and I would point out that extremism and defense of liberty is no vice okay
[03:25:19.320 --> 03:25:24.680]  moderation and pursuit of justice is no virtue either now he points out he said
[03:25:24.680 --> 03:25:29.360]  with NAFTA the North American Free Trade Agreement which is put in this
[03:25:29.360 --> 03:25:33.040]  article here that's out of Britain they put it as the North Atlantic Free Trade
[03:25:33.040 --> 03:25:36.640]  Agreement no it's a North American Free Trade Agreement which comprises US
[03:25:36.640 --> 03:25:40.400]  Canada and Mexico he says it doesn't come with a commission a parliament or a
[03:25:40.400 --> 03:25:45.960]  court of justice he pointed out well not yet not yet that's why we talk about
[03:25:45.960 --> 03:25:48.840]  the North American Union and we need to understand that when we look at these
[03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:52.600]  trade agreements when we look at all these agreements and we look at what the
[03:25:52.600 --> 03:25:58.760]  situation is in in Europe the EU does have a commission a parliament a court
[03:25:58.760 --> 03:26:05.200]  of justice that is the problem so they started out as an economic union what
[03:26:05.200 --> 03:26:09.320]  they did then was they made it into a political union and they want to make it
[03:26:09.320 --> 03:26:13.960]  into a tighter political union because they have rigged the system to fail
[03:26:13.960 --> 03:26:18.440]  using the economic levers that they were given by that economic union do you
[03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:24.560]  understand how this works that's the process they create these trade areas
[03:26:24.560 --> 03:26:29.200]  consolidation they consolidate several countries together into a an economic
[03:26:29.200 --> 03:26:34.680]  union which doesn't work out very well for the countries that were rich it's a
[03:26:34.680 --> 03:26:38.760]  transfer of wealth it's a transfer of sovereignty ultimately because they're
[03:26:38.760 --> 03:26:43.360]  going to rig the system so that as it fails they say as they're saying now in
[03:26:43.360 --> 03:26:48.120]  Europe the only way that we're going to save the euro the economic union the
[03:26:48.120 --> 03:26:52.720]  only way we're going to save this euro is to have tighter political controls
[03:26:52.720 --> 03:26:56.720]  that's why there's this move in Britain to say we're going to back out of this
[03:26:56.720 --> 03:27:02.280]  and you have to understand Jeff sessions senator sessions who looked at these new
[03:27:02.280 --> 03:27:06.720]  trade agreements that will unify the United States with a block of Asian
[03:27:06.720 --> 03:27:11.360]  countries that will unify the United States with Europe that is the globalist
[03:27:11.360 --> 03:27:15.040]  trade agreement with the United States as the backbone with these two trade
[03:27:15.040 --> 03:27:19.120]  agreements both of these trade agreements have been negotiated at the same
[03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:24.600]  time by the same people in secret they have the same structure that structure
[03:27:24.600 --> 03:27:28.800]  sets up an international trade commission that is not answerable or
[03:27:28.800 --> 03:27:34.360]  controllable by our governments it is an international commission that will
[03:27:34.360 --> 03:27:37.880]  manage our economies we're not talking about free trade here we're talking
[03:27:37.880 --> 03:27:42.600]  about foreign management of our economies by an unelected elite
[03:27:42.600 --> 03:27:47.240]  commission that's what senator sessions has pointed out the only person who
[03:27:47.240 --> 03:27:51.240]  cares about that is Donald Trump that's why senator sessions endorsed at Donald
[03:27:51.240 --> 03:27:57.600]  Trump the only presidential candidate senator sessions has ever endorsed that
[03:27:57.600 --> 03:28:01.880]  is a major reason to vote for Donald Trump he is authentic on this issue he's
[03:28:01.880 --> 03:28:07.720]  pushed on this issue for 35 years I trust him on this issue I don't trust him
[03:28:07.720 --> 03:28:11.400]  on individual liberty I don't trust him on so many other things but there are
[03:28:11.400 --> 03:28:16.960]  ways that we can control these issues not everything will be accomplished by
[03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:20.400]  electing somebody as president you have to understand that that's one of the
[03:28:20.400 --> 03:28:25.840]  reasons why evangelicals are not falling in line behind the public piety of Ted
[03:28:25.840 --> 03:28:30.120]  Cruz first of all most of them like me don't believe that it's authentic looks
[03:28:30.120 --> 03:28:37.200]  like a stench but they also understand that's not the the the jurisdiction of
[03:28:37.200 --> 03:28:42.120]  government government has failed we have tried that since the days of Reagan and
[03:28:42.120 --> 03:28:48.520]  all it has done is make the Christian churches weaker it has made a lot of
[03:28:48.520 --> 03:28:54.120]  glitterbug preachers very wealthy by positioning themselves into the political
[03:28:54.120 --> 03:28:58.800]  arena but it has not done much for the spiritual health of this country we
[03:28:58.800 --> 03:29:02.880]  understand it is a failed practice and so when we look at this we look at this
[03:29:02.880 --> 03:29:08.080]  from an international standpoint look at what's happening in Europe same people
[03:29:08.080 --> 03:29:11.520]  same tactics that's why they have the open borders it's a different group of
[03:29:11.520 --> 03:29:16.440]  immigrants going in there to some degree but it's the same globalists who are
[03:29:16.440 --> 03:29:20.360]  doing to Europe what they want to do to America Europe is just a little bit
[03:29:20.360 --> 03:29:24.000]  farther along than we are and their course there is this article that was on
[03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:28.320]  Drudge report today unprecedented UN global data gathering yeah the UN
[03:29:28.320 --> 03:29:32.280]  statistical Commission wants to get all kinds of stuff to have targets in order
[03:29:32.280 --> 03:29:37.600]  to transform global society this is the globalism that is there when you look at
[03:29:37.600 --> 03:29:41.560]  what they're doing they're feeding this agenda that we see here in the United
[03:29:41.560 --> 03:29:44.200]  States as well stay with us we're gonna come back and break this down for you
[03:29:44.200 --> 03:29:53.480]  further we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN
[03:29:53.480 --> 03:30:01.880]  radio network in a rather bizarre statement presidential candidate
[03:30:01.880 --> 03:30:06.480]  Hillary Clinton has said that the US didn't lose a single person in Libya
[03:30:06.480 --> 03:30:10.840]  which is to say the former secretary of state is ignoring the murder of
[03:30:10.840 --> 03:30:15.720]  ambassador Christopher Stevens now Libya is perfect isn't it Clinton said
[03:30:15.720 --> 03:30:19.960]  Libya was a different kind of calculation and we didn't lose a single
[03:30:19.960 --> 03:30:23.760]  person we didn't have a problem in supporting our European and the Arab
[03:30:23.760 --> 03:30:28.480]  allies in working with NATO Mrs. Clinton conveniently skipped over the attack of
[03:30:28.480 --> 03:30:33.920]  September 11th 2012 of the diplomatic special mission compound and CIA annex
[03:30:33.920 --> 03:30:37.840]  in Benghazi the left ambassador Christopher Stevens foreign management
[03:30:37.840 --> 03:30:43.000]  officer Sean Smith and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Smith and Glenn Doherty dead
[03:30:43.000 --> 03:30:47.840]  there's even a movie out about it called 13 hours and this isn't the first time
[03:30:47.840 --> 03:30:52.040]  Hillary has had a selective memory but what difference doesn't make you can

[03:31:55.280 --> 03:32:01.320]  Pro Max shower filter from Pro Pure today thousands of years ago there was a
[03:32:01.320 --> 03:32:06.520]  basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the
[03:32:06.520 --> 03:32:11.680]  warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years
[03:32:11.680 --> 03:32:16.840]  ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had
[03:32:16.840 --> 03:32:22.360]  drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent
[03:32:22.360 --> 03:32:27.280]  weapons for quiet war. Pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of
[03:32:27.280 --> 03:32:32.160]  plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our
[03:32:32.160 --> 03:32:36.080]  journey towards death. I personally counter this onslaught with

[03:33:41.200 --> 03:33:45.440]  course there's been a lot of news the last couple of days the mainstream medical
[03:33:45.440 --> 03:33:51.920]  community has said what we've been saying for 20 years that the essence of your
[03:33:51.920 --> 03:33:56.240]  health in terms of fighting cancer with your immune system is the health of your
[03:33:56.240 --> 03:33:59.920]  gut that's what Dr. Group and info wars been telling you for 20 years now
[03:33:59.920 --> 03:34:02.720]  they're admitting it and of course in that article the guy says five years
[03:34:02.720 --> 03:34:07.360]  ago I would have said what are you crazy because they were saying hey you're
[03:34:07.360 --> 03:34:12.960]  crazy but we knew better okay so now the AMA and others have looked at research
[03:34:12.960 --> 03:34:18.160]  they understand that now iodine of course helps your gut to promote optimal
[03:34:18.160 --> 03:34:22.480]  health they've taken it out of the food supply large degree we've talked about
[03:34:22.480 --> 03:34:29.320]  that we've seen a drop in IQ points and when we saw populations gain and IQ
[03:34:29.320 --> 03:34:32.960]  points when it was added back in salt in the 1990s let me read you some of the

[03:34:49.120 --> 03:34:53.400]  because of convenience what a great product to clean your system here's
[03:34:53.400 --> 03:34:56.960]  another one from Rob in Las Vegas Nevada he says I cannot go without this

[03:35:42.880 --> 03:35:45.240]  background here there's a couple interesting articles that came out today
[03:35:45.240 --> 03:35:50.920]  about what happened this last Saturday in Chicago is it Saturday or Friday night
[03:35:50.920 --> 03:35:56.400]  anyway a new poll shows that left-wing protesters drive people in the arms of
[03:35:56.400 --> 03:35:59.320]  Donald Trump this is an article it's up on info wars.com it's actually from
[03:35:59.320 --> 03:36:03.320]  Reason magazine and they're looking at a poll from Monmouth University and the
[03:36:03.320 --> 03:36:06.920]  reason writer says it confirms something I've long suspected and have argued in
[03:36:06.920 --> 03:36:11.240]  previous articles that the antics of left-wing agitators are driving ordinary
[03:36:11.240 --> 03:36:15.040]  people into the arms of Trump and then we have this other article that's up on
[03:36:15.040 --> 03:36:20.600]  info wars.com a Chicago cop posted after the fact the anti-Trump mob was far
[03:36:20.600 --> 03:36:23.920]  more aggressive and destructive than reported he says it seems like the
[03:36:23.920 --> 03:36:28.400]  media imagine that the media aren't broadcasting footage of the debris being
[03:36:28.400 --> 03:36:34.160]  thrown across various streets at Trump fans at the Trump fans the officer who
[03:36:34.160 --> 03:36:38.240]  posted anonymously on second city cop blog also noted the media didn't report
[03:36:38.240 --> 03:36:42.400]  the protesters running through parking lots breaking the windows of cars that
[03:36:42.400 --> 03:36:46.760]  had Trump stickers on them or that the department called out emergency incident
[03:36:46.760 --> 03:36:50.600]  teams to cope with anti-Trump riots at the University of Illinois in Chicago
[03:36:50.600 --> 03:36:54.880]  later the same day the officer posted a second much longer post to detail the
[03:36:54.880 --> 03:37:00.000]  failures of the police leaders to plan for to respond to the protests and of
[03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:04.640]  course you've got Ted Cruz jumping in with the rest of the establishment GOP
[03:37:04.640 --> 03:37:09.440]  saying Trump is responsible let's blame Trump you know we had riots this last
[03:37:09.440 --> 03:37:13.880]  weekend as well spring break riots in Miami's South Beach was that Donald
[03:37:13.880 --> 03:37:19.400]  Trump's fault too I'm sure if Ted Cruz John Kasich Marco Rubio and Carl Rove
[03:37:19.400 --> 03:37:23.760]  knew about it they would try to blame that on on Donald Trump as well had
[03:37:23.760 --> 03:37:28.360]  people there what what was a possible justification for them to create a brawl
[03:37:28.360 --> 03:37:32.680]  to climb on top of cars to break bottles all over the place they had to call out
[03:37:32.680 --> 03:37:36.640]  the riot police there they said it wasn't a full-on riot nevertheless it was
[03:37:36.640 --> 03:37:42.080]  chaos reported by CBS News and here's what a resident there said this is Mara
[03:37:42.080 --> 03:37:47.800]  Day Los Angeles a Miami Beach resident told CBS the spring break visitors were
[03:37:47.800 --> 03:37:53.200]  hordes of filthy barbarians what was the reason for that is it just that they're
[03:37:53.200 --> 03:37:57.880]  spoiled college brats or was it Donald Trump's fault according to Ted Cruz I'm
[03:37:57.880 --> 03:38:02.680]  sure it was Donald Trump's fault let's go to Owen and FEMA 7 when you were there
[03:38:02.680 --> 03:38:08.520]  at the Chicago Trump rally. Hey David, I'm Nathan I-9 user and I want to
[03:38:08.520 --> 03:38:14.120]  clarify actually I was at the St. Louis rally oh okay and I am actually the guy
[03:38:14.120 --> 03:38:19.880]  in the plaid shirt on the anti-Trump protesters go berserk video oh okay I
[03:38:19.880 --> 03:38:24.040]  wanted to well first off I wanted to say thank you for all the support on the
[03:38:24.040 --> 03:38:29.160]  video and unfortunately for the people that were asking who I am or where they
[03:38:29.160 --> 03:38:33.560]  can find me I was blocked from Google Plus and YouTube here lately so I haven't
[03:38:33.560 --> 03:38:37.240]  been able to comment or share my page or anything. Well there you go that's that's
[03:38:37.240 --> 03:38:42.160]  the way you that's the response of the mainstream if they don't get the the
[03:38:42.160 --> 03:38:44.720]  optics that they want if they don't get the story that they want they just shut
[03:38:44.720 --> 03:38:50.040]  it down so they shut they blocked you from Google Plus. Yes and I haven't been
[03:38:50.040 --> 03:38:54.020]  able to do my live show but I have been able to upload videos from my phone but
[03:38:54.020 --> 03:38:58.360]  that's it no comment or anything else but I do think that the St. Louis rally
[03:38:58.360 --> 03:39:02.920]  actually illustrates what you were just talking about just as much if not more
[03:39:02.920 --> 03:39:08.400]  and the video that I'm in illustrates that when the guy who comes in and starts
[03:39:08.400 --> 03:39:13.920]  accusing me of being a racist he was inciting people to fight him all day
[03:39:13.920 --> 03:39:19.120]  long we captured in that video he even says put your hands on me and then
[03:39:19.120 --> 03:39:23.400]  later that day you've seen the headline on New York Daily News he's on the
[03:39:23.400 --> 03:39:28.520]  front page blooded headline what is on Don's hand that's right that's right
[03:39:28.520 --> 03:39:32.760]  me or break that's the way they spin it yeah yeah how's that for one side of
[03:39:32.760 --> 03:39:36.360]  the point it's absolutely amazing you know we were watching somebody put up a
[03:39:36.360 --> 03:39:40.560]  stream about a half hour stream of what happened in Chicago and I was sitting
[03:39:40.560 --> 03:39:44.840]  there watching it with my family one point there was a black protestor who
[03:39:44.840 --> 03:39:50.040]  got up on the on the dais behind the podium and these guys are trying to get
[03:39:50.040 --> 03:39:53.160]  him off and he's fighting them he's swinging and then later on he's swinging
[03:39:53.160 --> 03:39:56.760]  at somebody else and so why isn't I said why doesn't somebody just punch him I
[03:39:56.760 --> 03:40:00.800]  mean I'm not that's not my reaction to things anybody knows me knows I'm not a
[03:40:00.800 --> 03:40:05.040]  fighter like that but I mean it just it makes me angry you know I don't think
[03:40:05.040 --> 03:40:08.760]  that when Donald Trump reacts like that looking at that and it's not
[03:40:08.760 --> 03:40:13.520]  necessarily an incitement it's a response to this kind of in-your-face
[03:40:13.520 --> 03:40:17.880]  provocation this kind of bullying and the fact that won't somebody just get him
[03:40:17.880 --> 03:40:21.200]  out of here I mean just remove him by force he's injected himself into a
[03:40:21.200 --> 03:40:25.400]  private rally and that's the point at which he is no longer free speech now
[03:40:25.400 --> 03:40:30.480]  he is aggressively in your space with that and that's the thing that people
[03:40:30.480 --> 03:40:33.560]  need to understand these are private rallies they come in there one person
[03:40:33.560 --> 03:40:37.080]  will create a disturbance they'll move that person out and then the next person
[03:40:37.080 --> 03:40:41.040]  is sitting there as soon as things start to calm down they get up they just want
[03:40:41.040 --> 03:40:46.760]  to shut down your speech well and I think that video not only illustrates that
[03:40:46.760 --> 03:40:51.520]  but also the ignorance of most of the left supporters and I think it's
[03:40:51.520 --> 03:40:55.760]  terribly ironic that every other candidate in the race not just the
[03:40:55.760 --> 03:41:01.240]  Democratic candidate but even the Republicans are asking for Trump to ask
[03:41:01.240 --> 03:41:06.320]  his supporters to stop inciting violence when it's clearly the Democratic
[03:41:06.320 --> 03:41:10.840]  supporters they say it on record and then how about this they will accuse
[03:41:10.840 --> 03:41:15.200]  Donald Trump or they will compare Donald Trump to Hiller while they're
[03:41:15.200 --> 03:41:20.800]  funded by George Soros a Nazi collaborator that's right that's right
[03:41:20.800 --> 03:41:25.400]  and you know people see through this people understand that this is just
[03:41:25.400 --> 03:41:30.880]  naked opportunism this is nothing but political ambition that we've seen on
[03:41:30.880 --> 03:41:35.800]  the part of Ted Cruz doing this this is as obnoxious as what he did to Ben
[03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:41.680]  Carson at the Iowa caucus spreading lies that he knew full well were lies and
[03:41:41.680 --> 03:41:45.560]  when that first information came out that it said they were basing the lies
[03:41:45.560 --> 03:41:49.240]  and the rumors of Ben Carson dropped out the person who tweeted that tweeted
[03:41:49.240 --> 03:41:52.840]  immediately there's a pair of tweets one of them said and oh by the way he's
[03:41:52.840 --> 03:41:55.560]  made it clear he's not dropping out and they did that 20 minutes before the
[03:41:55.560 --> 03:42:00.040]  caucus started and then after the caucuses started 20 minutes later the
[03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:04.640]  Ted Cruz people start spreading that lie and of course Ted Cruz chose a
[03:42:04.640 --> 03:42:10.120]  campaign manager who was noted for being a dirty trickster they continued to
[03:42:10.120 --> 03:42:13.240]  spread that lie for another half hour and so when he does this and we had this
[03:42:13.240 --> 03:42:18.160]  article up this weekend info wars.com thank you oh and I'm gonna move on on
[03:42:18.160 --> 03:42:22.000]  Saturday Ted Cruz law support a prominent conservatives and they talk
[03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:28.200]  about the fact that these other officers I just read this cop this second
[03:42:28.200 --> 03:42:33.240]  city cop blog comments from one Chicago cop going into more detail but this came
[03:42:33.240 --> 03:42:39.520]  out right away on Saturday and this was a John Cardillo who was tweeting the
[03:42:39.520 --> 03:42:44.360]  sound he says no blocking ambulances assaulting police officers are not
[03:42:44.360 --> 03:42:48.840]  protected by the First Amendment and as I point out anti-Trump protesters
[03:42:48.840 --> 03:42:53.680]  blocking ambulances screaming at the emergency workers f you f you back up
[03:42:53.680 --> 03:42:58.680]  and go around you know what that is not free speech okay that is not
[03:42:58.680 --> 03:43:04.320]  appropriate speech but nobody Ted doesn't condemn them instead he condemns
[03:43:04.320 --> 03:43:08.760]  his political opponent tries to throw him under the bus just as he has his
[03:43:08.760 --> 03:43:13.280]  Senate colleagues okay this is what made this kind of thing that he did to Ben
[03:43:13.280 --> 03:43:18.760]  Carson what he's doing to Donald Trump with this Chicago rally this is what
[03:43:18.760 --> 03:43:25.200]  made Ted Cruz the the pariah of the Senate he immediately began running for
[03:43:25.200 --> 03:43:28.760]  Senate he immediately threw his colleagues under the bus at every
[03:43:28.760 --> 03:43:32.520]  opportunity to climb over their backs so that he could become president that's
[03:43:32.520 --> 03:43:38.200]  why he's so resoundingly hated and he's now showing this side to the American
[03:43:38.200 --> 03:43:42.480]  voters but let's look at this report that Darren McBreen put together that
[03:43:42.480 --> 03:43:49.400]  shows how the media is spinning all of this the Democrats and the corporate
[03:43:49.400 --> 03:43:54.800]  controlled mainstream media have joined forces with the establishment
[03:43:54.800 --> 03:44:01.200]  Republicans to form an alliance against what has become their common enemy and
[03:44:01.200 --> 03:44:07.360]  that is Donald Trump who is clearly the GOP front-runner and is on target to
[03:44:07.360 --> 03:44:12.800]  win the Republican nomination and that my friends has both the left and the
[03:44:12.800 --> 03:44:18.840]  right in a total panic mode look we've all seen the demonization of Donald
[03:44:18.840 --> 03:44:22.840]  Trump by the national media I mean he was never accused of being a racist
[03:44:22.840 --> 03:44:28.840]  until he ran for president Trump's bigotry and pandering to win the support
[03:44:28.840 --> 03:44:34.920]  of prejudice voters well it's a myth it's a slanderous character assassination
[03:44:34.920 --> 03:44:40.200]  all too common with the politically correct left and if they disagree with
[03:44:40.200 --> 03:44:45.480]  you they play the race card most Americans we've had enough I mean we're
[03:44:45.480 --> 03:44:49.560]  getting sick of it and by now I'm sure you've all seen the video of the
[03:44:49.560 --> 03:44:54.760]  protester at the Trump rally who got sucker punched in the face after
[03:44:54.760 --> 03:44:59.040]  disrupting Trump's speech and then flipping off the crowd as he was being
[03:44:59.040 --> 03:45:05.280]  escorted out of the building 78 year old John McGraw there in the cowboy hat
[03:45:05.280 --> 03:45:11.280]  well he took a cheap shot at the protester Rakeem Jones and naturally the
[03:45:11.280 --> 03:45:15.960]  mainstream news media is having a field day with this I mean they're making it
[03:45:15.960 --> 03:45:21.000]  sound as if it was Donald Trump himself who punched the guy and and we all know
[03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:25.680]  it was a cowardly thing to do maybe the old man was trying to play the knockout
[03:45:25.680 --> 03:45:30.400]  game all right that was a cheap shot too but you know the biggest and most
[03:45:30.400 --> 03:45:34.880]  vicious sucker punches are coming from the mainstream media and they're
[03:45:34.880 --> 03:45:38.400]  landing on Donald Trump you know it's something you never want to see happen
[03:45:38.400 --> 03:45:42.440]  but again it's not connected to the campaign whatsoever it's just it's
[03:45:42.440 --> 03:45:46.960]  something that happened in the crowd by bystanders I guess Jeff what what some
[03:45:46.960 --> 03:45:50.160]  would say here and let me ask you some would say it is connected to the
[03:45:50.160 --> 03:45:54.040]  campaign or maybe it's connected to the campaign in terms of the tone and the
[03:45:54.040 --> 03:45:57.880]  atmosphere that the candidate himself is creating and most of the time when
[03:45:57.880 --> 03:46:03.840]  when there is a disruption at a Trump rally it is a setup remember the guy
[03:46:03.840 --> 03:46:10.000]  who showed up at a Trump rally who said we have a problem with Muslims in this
[03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:15.720]  country we problem in this country it's called Muslims we know our current
[03:46:15.720 --> 03:46:20.680]  president is one well that guy was a Democratic plant in Trump's audience
[03:46:20.680 --> 03:46:24.840]  he's an operative an agent provocateur whatever you want to call him he's not
[03:46:24.840 --> 03:46:30.280]  a real Trump supporter he's notorious for showing up at tea parties wearing
[03:46:30.280 --> 03:46:36.160]  Nazi t-shirts well at the same time contributing to left-wing blogs and
[03:46:36.160 --> 03:46:41.680]  anti tea party websites he's a fake he's a fraud and he was planning there in
[03:46:41.680 --> 03:46:47.800]  the audience to make the average Trump supporter look like a dumbass and a
[03:46:47.800 --> 03:46:52.480]  racist I mean the mainstream media played this exchange over and over again
[03:46:52.480 --> 03:46:57.880]  on television but they never revealed to the public that the guy was a fraud much
[03:46:57.880 --> 03:47:03.840]  like the time Jeb Bush sent one of his own staff members to a Trump rally to
[03:47:03.840 --> 03:47:09.960]  play the role of a female antagonist it was quickly revealed by independent
[03:47:09.960 --> 03:47:15.960]  media that she was planted there to frame Donald Trump but that didn't stop
[03:47:15.960 --> 03:47:22.160]  CNN from framing the narrative did mom ever stare at you like this Donald and
[03:47:22.160 --> 03:47:26.560]  just when Trump thought it was safe to go on to the next question if you become
[03:47:26.560 --> 03:47:31.040]  president will a woman make the same as a man and do I get to choose what I do
[03:47:31.040 --> 03:47:36.840]  with my body you're gonna make the same if you do as good a job and I happen to
[03:47:36.840 --> 03:47:41.480]  be pro-life so there's your stereotypical hit piece from CNN they
[03:47:41.480 --> 03:47:46.040]  refused to tell their audience that the angry woman there at the Trump rally
[03:47:46.040 --> 03:47:50.840]  was working for Jeb Bush there you go and guess who else is working for Jeb
[03:47:50.840 --> 03:47:54.240]  Bush that's a an excellent special report from Darren McBrain that's an
[03:47:54.240 --> 03:47:57.840]  example of what we do in the nightly news you can see the rest of that at our
[03:47:57.840 --> 03:48:03.160]  YouTube channel and that has already had quite a few views as has been posted on
[03:48:03.160 --> 03:48:07.040]  social media you need to go back and remember those kind of dirty tricks that
[03:48:07.040 --> 03:48:11.000]  Jeb Bush did with his staffer there that's a I almost forgotten about that so
[03:48:11.000 --> 03:48:14.840]  much has happened in the election that was really rigging it but of course now
[03:48:14.840 --> 03:48:19.200]  Jeb Bush is going around meeting with Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, John Kasich
[03:48:19.200 --> 03:48:25.200]  strategizing about how they can stop Trump because Jeb Bush is a mess okay he
[03:48:25.200 --> 03:48:30.440]  can never get that live that down and he and his dad when his dad did the thing
[03:48:30.440 --> 03:48:34.240]  across his neck you know the Bushes the Bush crime family wants to take down
[03:48:34.240 --> 03:48:38.200]  Donald Trump in the worst way I want to go to one of our callers here Bill and
[03:48:38.200 --> 03:48:43.480]  Pennsylvania said you want to talk about Ted Cruz go ahead Ted go ahead yeah I'm
[03:48:43.480 --> 03:48:50.080]  beginning to think that Ted Cruz was a plant from the very beginning so that
[03:48:50.080 --> 03:48:55.920]  when they say they're going to hold their nose and stall Cruz in there I think
[03:48:55.920 --> 03:49:00.480]  again with his connections with his wife to big corporate banking and stuff that
[03:49:00.480 --> 03:49:09.080]  he'd been a plant all along and his logo instead of trusted should be mistrusted
[03:49:09.080 --> 03:49:17.040]  yeah yeah I agree mistrusted yeah I have said that all along I couldn't agree
[03:49:17.040 --> 03:49:20.840]  with you more I was very disturbed this is a guy who when he was running for
[03:49:20.840 --> 03:49:23.520]  Senate and everybody said oh wait a minute his wife is a Goldman Sachs
[03:49:23.520 --> 03:49:27.600]  banker who was working on North American Union issues with a council on
[03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:30.800]  foreign relations he goes oh they're a pit of vipers and just as I pointed out
[03:49:30.800 --> 03:49:33.200]  earlier you know he's throwing around the word neocon and they're saying he's
[03:49:33.200 --> 03:49:37.680]  using that as a dog whistle absolutely he's using that as a dog whistle there's
[03:49:37.680 --> 03:49:43.280]  an article up on it on a drudge report today talking about how he has his data
[03:49:43.280 --> 03:49:48.240]  people at South by Southwest talking about how they are data mining
[03:49:48.240 --> 03:49:52.440]  everything they can determine precisely what the issues are that you want to
[03:49:52.440 --> 03:49:56.680]  hear and tell you precisely what you want to hear and that's what Ted Cruz has
[03:49:56.680 --> 03:50:00.680]  been doing he has been there from the very beginning I agree with you he has
[03:50:00.680 --> 03:50:05.720]  been the inside plant man to take the libertarian vote away the oxygen in the
[03:50:05.720 --> 03:50:10.360]  room away from Rand Paul I think Rand Paul was authentic on these issues I do
[03:50:10.360 --> 03:50:13.960]  not think that Ted Cruz was authentic on these issues one of the things that
[03:50:13.960 --> 03:50:20.920]  really concerns me Bill about this is what he's done portraying himself as a
[03:50:20.920 --> 03:50:24.840]  Christian and I had completely missed what happened back in November until
[03:50:24.840 --> 03:50:30.160]  the drudge put this up on Monday about him going to this conference where this
[03:50:30.160 --> 03:50:33.920]  pastor his name is Kevin Swanson I didn't know anything about this guy but
[03:50:33.920 --> 03:50:38.240]  he's essentially like these Westboro Baptist people if you look at this clip
[03:50:38.240 --> 03:50:42.200]  we're gonna play this clip for you when we come back it absolutely is
[03:50:42.200 --> 03:50:47.480]  astounding to me and as a Christian I want to disavow this and I want to ask
[03:50:47.480 --> 03:50:53.800]  Ted Cruz why would you not disavow Kevin Swanson say what this will be right
[03:50:53.800 --> 03:50:58.200]  back

[03:54:49.360 --> 03:54:54.760]  you today doing good yeah I'm calling about the two-year anniversary of the
[03:54:54.760 --> 03:55:02.480]  Crimean referendum I've been in Crimea for about 15 years and I'm looking at
[03:55:02.480 --> 03:55:09.920]  what's going on since the referendum and the hypocrisy that's going on is just
[03:55:09.920 --> 03:55:14.720]  amazing if we listen to what Felenty was saying earlier about what happened in
[03:55:14.720 --> 03:55:20.280]  Kosovo there you have an armed group of Muslims take over part of the country
[03:55:20.280 --> 03:55:24.240]  the international community just approved it gave them their own country and
[03:55:24.240 --> 03:55:31.880]  so on and so forth in Crimea they had a CIA back to using neo-Nazis
[03:55:31.880 --> 03:55:35.280]  overthrow the duly elected government it may not have been the best government
[03:55:35.280 --> 03:55:40.280]  but it was duly elected and and I'm not just saying it's a CIA back to if you
[03:55:40.280 --> 03:55:45.800]  Google oh yeah relationship we reported on that quite a bit you see that they're
[03:55:45.800 --> 03:55:49.200]  being in the country then you see the same thing we've reported on this is
[03:55:49.200 --> 03:55:53.000]  starting of course we know Victorian New Orleans is talked about this we know
[03:55:53.000 --> 03:55:56.720]  we've we talked about the George Soros NGOs that are behind that and of course
[03:55:56.720 --> 03:56:00.560]  that has been the American foreign policy it's not a policy of defense it's a
[03:56:00.560 --> 03:56:05.640]  policy of chaos and we see the same thing happening in Syria Assad is not a
[03:56:05.640 --> 03:56:10.200]  perfect guy okay but just as we saw in Libya in spite of what Hilary Clinton
[03:56:10.200 --> 03:56:14.120]  says and of course lying is her superpower she can say we went into
[03:56:14.120 --> 03:56:18.440]  Libya and we didn't lose anybody really really you not only lost American
[03:56:18.440 --> 03:56:21.720]  citizens you even lost your ambassador you might remember that but she doesn't
[03:56:21.720 --> 03:56:26.160]  remember that but the fact is that we have turned that place into an arms
[03:56:26.160 --> 03:56:31.400]  bizarre for ISIS and we just create chaos everywhere we go overthrowing
[03:56:31.400 --> 03:56:34.640]  regime so we know the same thing's gonna happen in Syria that's what they're
[03:56:34.640 --> 03:56:38.920]  trying to do at the underbelly of Russia and they started up the Cold War now
[03:56:38.920 --> 03:56:41.640]  from my perspective I don't know what you think about this my perspective is
[03:56:41.640 --> 03:56:46.520]  what's behind this is they want to get the big ticket items of the military
[03:56:46.520 --> 03:56:51.720]  industrial complex going again what do you think oh yeah they're doing just
[03:56:51.720 --> 03:56:55.520]  stock options and stuff like that with us you know saying oh we're gonna bomb
[03:56:55.520 --> 03:56:59.960]  Syria and react on the stock goes through the roof so you know is they don't
[03:56:59.960 --> 03:57:03.560]  even need to start the war anymore they can do a bubble on the stock market so
[03:57:03.560 --> 03:57:08.560]  oh yeah it's really well I agree with you David I think that's exactly what's
[03:57:08.560 --> 03:57:11.680]  going on it's interesting that you see the same thing happening there on the
[03:57:11.680 --> 03:57:15.080]  ground real quickly because about at a time I want to go to Doug in Tennessee
[03:57:15.080 --> 03:57:19.200]  Doug you think that we're talking about pushing Trump too much go ahead well
[03:57:19.200 --> 03:57:24.880]  yeah I mean I'm a 10 year long listener to the show so I'm not just please take
[03:57:24.880 --> 03:57:29.800]  this criticism and again good good spirits when you have Roger Stone on it
[03:57:29.800 --> 03:57:34.600]  an operative for the Trump campaign citing anonymous sources that Ted Cruz
[03:57:34.600 --> 03:57:38.920]  offered to drop out of the race in exchange for a Supreme Court seat that
[03:57:38.920 --> 03:57:42.280]  was mentioned a couple Sundays ago and never mentioned since so apparently
[03:57:42.280 --> 03:57:48.240]  there was nothing to that secondly if I want to listen to the job we don't we
[03:57:48.240 --> 03:57:52.480]  don't necessarily know and I mean you know Roger Stone has had even though he
[03:57:52.480 --> 03:57:55.920]  uses anonymous sources he has predicted a lot of stuff like what he said about
[03:57:55.920 --> 03:58:01.760]  Romney that that became a public I agree with you in the sense that I don't
[03:58:01.760 --> 03:58:06.240]  want to become a cheerleader for Trump but I got to say that on these issues of
[03:58:06.240 --> 03:58:09.840]  globalism with the trade treaties with the climate treaties with the open
[03:58:09.840 --> 03:58:15.840]  borders these are the things that are the fundamental critical path for the
[03:58:15.840 --> 03:58:19.600]  globalist just as we realize the last election we there gave us two candidates
[03:58:19.600 --> 03:58:24.040]  both of who were going to give us Obamacare the fix was in we understand
[03:58:24.040 --> 03:58:27.880]  the fix was in for this the only person pushing against that fix on that issue
[03:58:27.880 --> 03:58:32.640]  is Donald Trump and that's a big issue join us tonight for returns of these
[03:58:32.640 --> 03:58:50.800]  critical states as they come in
