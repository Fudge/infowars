[00:00.000 --> 00:12.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.560 --> 00:21.320]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.320 --> 00:32.720]  it is Monday the 26th day of July 2010 coming up in the middle of the next
[00:32.720 --> 00:38.560]  hour in the first half of the third hour we have John Young of Crypto formerly
[00:38.560 --> 00:44.200]  with WikiLeaks joining us to talk about the big scandal thousands of
[00:44.200 --> 00:50.720]  documents released dealing with reported massacres in Afghanistan and then Wayne
[00:50.720 --> 00:55.560]  Madsen who worked with the NSA and Naval Intelligence he'll be joining us to
[00:55.560 --> 01:01.840]  give us his take now we have exchanged emails the last year several times with
[01:01.840 --> 01:05.720]  the founder of WikiLeaks and he said he's gonna come on many times but then
[01:05.720 --> 01:09.800]  we're never able to get him on we'd like to hear from him specifically on this
[01:09.800 --> 01:14.600]  his spokesperson when he was in hiding for a few months was Brigitte Jones
[01:14.600 --> 01:18.920]  dottieur the Icelandic parliament who I think is a really great person has done
[01:18.920 --> 01:24.520]  a lot of important work and I think WikiLeaks is good I mean I can't say
[01:24.520 --> 01:28.720]  that a hundred percent because I'm not omnipresent but studying them I think
[01:28.720 --> 01:35.280]  they're real does that mean they could be fed this info perhaps could they be
[01:35.280 --> 01:41.160]  used to identify people leaking inside government yes but I respect John Young
[01:41.160 --> 01:49.200]  and Wayne Madsen and they have both said they're suspicious of WikiLeaks I'm
[01:49.200 --> 01:52.800]  gonna pick their brain today and you know put them on the hot seat in a
[01:52.800 --> 01:58.800]  friendly way and you know really ask them to explain to me why they're saying
[01:58.800 --> 02:03.920]  this because as I'm sure you know the top story in the last 24 hours is
[02:03.920 --> 02:09.840]  thousands of pages of secret documents that make the Pentagon papers leaked by
[02:09.840 --> 02:17.560]  Daniel Ellsberg look like child's play separately I've had a chance to scan
[02:17.560 --> 02:21.600]  over what is in some of these documents and and to read the news boil downs on
[02:21.600 --> 02:29.480]  it and most of it is already publicly available it came out early on that US
[02:29.480 --> 02:36.320]  troops would put thousands of Taliban fighters in containers standing in
[02:36.320 --> 02:42.240]  standing position sardine Dan and then in four or five days they would all be
[02:42.240 --> 02:47.000]  dead basically it's a form of crucifixion or like an iron maiden you
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.560]  cram a bunch of people where they can barely breathe together in hot
[02:52.560 --> 02:57.160]  temperatures when this was done in the summer in Afghanistan years ago it's
[02:57.160 --> 03:01.160]  going to kill them and that's what kills you with crucifixion is the fact you
[03:01.160 --> 03:08.600]  can't breathe because you're nailed to the cross and your diaphragm basically
[03:08.600 --> 03:15.680]  gets exhausted and we know about a lot of other massacres that have gone on I
[03:15.680 --> 03:20.280]  remember private Gruckheimer in the Ithaca Times back in 2002 made national
[03:20.280 --> 03:23.440]  headlines when he came home and gave interview and said yeah we go into
[03:23.440 --> 03:28.280]  villages and kill everyone men women and children and then the Pentagon went on
[03:28.280 --> 03:33.800]  Fox News and said well we want to clarify this only in certain villages do
[03:33.800 --> 03:39.800]  we kill everyone and of course there was a lot of criticism of general
[03:39.800 --> 03:46.880]  McChrystal because the last year and a half two years he changed that and said
[03:46.880 --> 03:49.120]  we're not going to be doing that and I'm certainly not saying he's a good guy
[03:49.120 --> 03:55.480]  I'm just going off of what he said we know that the late Pat Tillman
[03:55.480 --> 03:59.320]  criticized opium production the fact that the war was a fraud and there were
[03:59.320 --> 04:03.120]  massacres going on he wrote home about that said he was going to come home and
[04:03.120 --> 04:09.280]  become a big peace activist and they of course killed him and it's on record that
[04:09.280 --> 04:12.760]  the army coroner said that he had been killed and then it was foul play and
[04:12.760 --> 04:18.960]  then it was a cover-up so we know that McChrystal was in command of that
[04:18.960 --> 04:22.840]  cover-up so I'm not saying McChrystal's good it's just that McChrystal at least
[04:22.840 --> 04:29.040]  on paper said stop these massacres now the CIA is also trying to take over the
[04:29.040 --> 04:33.560]  army right now and there's a bunch of in-fighting going on they want to
[04:33.560 --> 04:38.160]  supplant the regular military mainly the army with contractors and so are they
[04:38.160 --> 04:42.000]  using wiki leaks to burn the army look a lot of weird stuff goes on in
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.120]  government and so we're gonna pick the brain of John Young and Wayne Madsen on
[04:46.120 --> 04:50.080]  this and why they're critical of wiki leaks and why they think it's the CIA or
[04:50.080 --> 04:54.360]  private corporate intelligence front I will be discussing that and all this
[04:54.360 --> 04:58.320]  news got a bunch of economic news as well it's all coming up after the break
[04:58.320 --> 05:04.720]  stay with us thousands of Americans are facing evacuation if you or any of your

[08:15.720 --> 08:20.960]  radio listeners and Prison Planet dot TV viewers we're gonna be taking a very
[08:20.960 --> 08:26.040]  close look at WikiLeaks coming up about an hour and a half we have two guests
[08:26.040 --> 08:32.480]  joining us Wayne Madsen and of course John Young of Cryptome give us their
[08:32.480 --> 08:36.400]  take on WikiLeaks some of these thousands of documents coming out that
[08:36.400 --> 08:42.000]  reportedly show the true nature of the war mass murder war crimes being the
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.720]  official policy but is this any news I mean our government has promoted
[08:46.720 --> 08:55.120]  torture secret arrest the torture of people's children in front of them we
[08:55.120 --> 09:01.080]  have a unlawful illegal government who we know pays the Taliban to give them
[09:01.080 --> 09:05.920]  innocent 12 13 14 year olds to be tortured at bases all around the world
[09:05.920 --> 09:10.400]  to create fake intelligence meanwhile the true Al Qaeda and Taliban commanders
[09:10.400 --> 09:15.600]  are released according to Newsweek Associated Press in the financial times
[09:15.600 --> 09:21.160]  of London as part of the airlift of evil so we'll be discussing all of that I
[09:21.160 --> 09:25.320]  have to say the information WikiLeaks is released looks very accurate to me and
[09:25.320 --> 09:30.040]  much of it's already publicly available information it's it's come out here and
[09:30.040 --> 09:37.320]  there and so the very clear picture that they've been able to create releasing
[09:37.320 --> 09:43.840]  these documents that were leaked to them I think jives with reality but some are
[09:43.840 --> 09:48.400]  critical of WikiLeaks not just saying they're traitorous for releasing the
[09:48.400 --> 09:52.400]  information but saying they have connections to intelligence agencies
[09:52.400 --> 09:59.120]  again in my gut I don't really see evidence of that but I do respect mr.
[09:59.120 --> 10:03.600]  Young and mr. Madsen so we'll be talking to them and getting their concerns
[10:03.600 --> 10:10.080]  coming up today right now let's go ahead and go into the news and there is a
[10:10.080 --> 10:15.440]  lot of it I want to hear from callers and get your take on this we're going to

[10:27.680 --> 10:31.040]  air I'd love to get your take on any of the news I'm about to cover or any news

[10:42.280 --> 10:49.520]  number to join us today but right now let's go ahead and get into the news this
[10:49.520 --> 10:56.640]  is a curtain memo story up at info wars.com and he boils down all the
[10:56.640 --> 11:01.480]  mainstream reportage that's going on plus some of the back story of what's
[11:01.480 --> 11:08.120]  been happening but former head of the NSA and former CIA boss he's been in both
[11:08.120 --> 11:15.080]  positions says Iran attack inexorable basically something that's a foregone
[11:15.080 --> 11:21.800]  conclusion according to Michael Hayden a CIA boss under George W. Bush Iran's not
[11:21.800 --> 11:27.360]  having a nuke is just as dangerous as it having one this is the guy who lied
[11:27.360 --> 11:30.840]  about spying on the American people without warrants and then got caught
[11:30.840 --> 11:41.080]  doing it Hayden predicted Iran's plans to get itself that step right below a
[11:41.080 --> 11:48.360]  nuclear weapon that permanent breakout stage so the needle isn't quite in the
[11:48.360 --> 11:52.400]  red for the international community Hayden said that reaching even that
[11:52.400 --> 11:56.880]  level would be a destabilizing to the region is actually having a weapon and
[11:56.880 --> 12:02.400]  it will result in an attack by the US Israel or both killing Iranians now
[12:02.400 --> 12:07.440]  quote seems inexorable and may not be the worst of all possibilities or
[12:07.440 --> 12:13.880]  outcomes according to Hayden and of course that's not just info wars.com
[12:13.880 --> 12:21.240]  reporting it here is the Associated Press X CIA chief strike on Iran seems
[12:21.240 --> 12:30.880]  more likely now Israel's also saying the same thing here's a report out of Iran
[12:30.880 --> 12:35.960]  Iran's military leaders try to raise their nation's confidence in face of a
[12:35.960 --> 12:47.160]  possible attack. Continuing here's Haritz US strike on Iran likelier than ever
[12:47.160 --> 12:55.680]  former CIA chief says so that really is the most important news today in my
[12:55.680 --> 13:00.760]  humble opinion the establishment is clearly positioning the public mind
[13:00.760 --> 13:06.420]  that it's a foregone conclusion that Iran will be struck meanwhile there's
[13:06.420 --> 13:11.400]  other reports today where the White House is saying that Pakistan is funding
[13:11.400 --> 13:16.200]  Taliban and al-Qaeda groups Pakistan of course was aided by the United States and
[13:16.200 --> 13:21.920]  the EU in the last 15 years getting nuclear weapons and delivery systems
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.480]  that can deliver them more than 3,000 kilometers our government of course
[13:26.480 --> 13:29.040]  aided India and getting nuclear weapons the
[13:29.040 --> 13:40.280]  strategic not a word but the strategic outlook there is to get Pakistan and
[13:40.280 --> 13:49.160]  India fighting with each other but a very very dangerous system very very
[13:49.160 --> 13:54.600]  dangerous gambit there and we'll be going over some of that information
[13:54.600 --> 13:59.880]  coming up but now it's admitted there are US special forces after years of
[13:59.880 --> 14:05.920]  denial commanding different factions inside Pakistan so the United States is
[14:05.920 --> 14:12.960]  now opening up a new war there as we go bankrupt at home wiki leaks founder
[14:12.960 --> 14:18.160]  Julian Assange says documents on thousands of possible US war crimes in
[14:18.160 --> 14:27.320]  Afghanistan paint a picture of just how brutal this war is US forces fighting
[14:27.320 --> 14:31.760]  in Afghanistan could be investigated for thousands of possible war crimes
[14:31.760 --> 14:36.480]  allegedly committed when the Bush administration was running the war that
[14:36.480 --> 14:40.280]  was the shocking claim Monday from the head of the website that has already
[14:40.280 --> 14:45.680]  released a trove of damning documents suggesting Americans were misled about
[14:45.680 --> 14:51.040]  how well the Afghan war was being waged it's up to the court to decide really
[14:51.040 --> 14:56.880]  if something in the end is a crime wiki leaks founder said in London Assange
[14:56.880 --> 15:05.840]  said the leaked documents thus far were dated from January 04 to December 09 and
[15:05.840 --> 15:09.840]  it goes on to say only scratch the surface of what's really going on in
[15:09.840 --> 15:14.960]  particular he pointed to the deadly missile strike occurring by task force
[15:14.960 --> 15:19.560]  373 a unit allegedly charged with hunting down and killing Taliban targets
[15:19.560 --> 15:24.120]  well I mean again everything that's in these documents is already out there
[15:24.120 --> 15:29.880]  even under Obama they now have expanded this saying we will now kill unnamed
[15:29.880 --> 15:34.440]  terrorists in fact drone attacks to expand to no name terrorist search that
[15:34.440 --> 15:37.880]  term want to show people on the TV screen that are watching at prison
[15:37.880 --> 15:41.040]  planet dot TV or you can just search that term as a radio listener they
[15:41.040 --> 15:45.120]  admitted what a month and a half ago yes if anybody has a weapon in Pakistan or
[15:45.120 --> 15:49.760]  Afghanistan and basically everybody has a gun there it's while while west that
[15:49.760 --> 15:56.520]  the army and the air force separately and they have the CIA also running
[15:56.520 --> 16:03.960]  drones you know literally guys in suits so the CIA now has its own branch gets
[16:03.960 --> 16:07.760]  the fifth branch of the military with the contractors there it is no name
[16:07.760 --> 16:14.640]  terrorist now CIA drone targets CNN and they just going to report that if you
[16:14.640 --> 16:19.400]  have a weapon we kill you and they openly say it's collateral damage if
[16:19.400 --> 16:24.040]  there's a wedding with 500 people at it and they kill a couple hundred of them
[16:24.040 --> 16:28.520]  to kill that one person they think that maybe Taliban are all kind of that's
[16:28.520 --> 16:35.080]  okay and now the Pentagon is removing the pain raise the microwave guns from
[16:35.080 --> 16:39.280]  Afghanistan and saying they weren't really that useful but that they will be
[16:39.280 --> 16:42.800]  deployed in the United States and of course that was in the San Diego paper
[16:42.800 --> 16:47.160]  a few months ago and other newspapers that they are deploying the pain raise
[16:47.160 --> 16:51.640]  against the American people so you can't really legally use it against foreign
[16:51.640 --> 16:56.200]  enemies but hey American enemies you know the evil Tea Party people that are
[16:56.200 --> 16:59.960]  constitutionalist that support the Bill of Rights the Constitution they are the
[16:59.960 --> 17:06.240]  enemy of this foreign offshore banking cartel that's taken over the country
[17:06.240 --> 17:12.320]  business insiders got a good article says get ready for one day of talk about
[17:12.320 --> 17:17.200]  Afghanistan ten days of talk about WikiLeaks and the future of the media
[17:17.200 --> 17:21.560]  today the White House is dealing with the fallout of this weekend's massive
[17:21.560 --> 17:26.000]  Afghanistan document breach but now you know that last night the New York
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.400]  Times they're speaking on the Guardian simultaneously produced reports on the
[17:30.400 --> 17:33.960]  staggering document cash published by the increasingly influential site
[17:33.960 --> 17:43.680]  WikiLeaks which paints an ugly picture of the war in Afghanistan but again
[17:43.680 --> 17:46.440]  looking at these documents and the reports on the documents it's everything
[17:46.440 --> 17:51.600]  that was already admitted it's accurate info and this is not what the
[17:51.600 --> 17:55.880]  establishment wants to see or hear right now so I don't see how WikiLeaks could
[17:55.880 --> 18:00.680]  be the bad guys unless they're trying to set the precedent with good info to
[18:00.680 --> 18:06.080]  later give people bad info or I can see the argument well this info is already
[18:06.080 --> 18:09.920]  known I mean it's kind of like they arrest people that follow the orders to
[18:09.920 --> 18:16.160]  torture in Afghanistan and Iraq I mean scores of these contractors and army
[18:16.160 --> 18:21.720]  people are serving long prison sentences and then Bush comes out a month ago and
[18:21.720 --> 18:32.880]  says he'd ordered the torture and he'd order it again so there does seem to be
[18:32.880 --> 18:41.560]  a certain flaunting of all of this but I don't know it's all cloak and dagger and
[18:41.560 --> 18:45.120]  of course here's another article dealing with the WikiLeaks situation US
[18:45.120 --> 18:52.680]  condemns release of documents on Afghan war Pakistan said the disclosure of
[18:52.680 --> 18:58.080]  92,000 classified documents on the war in Afghanistan wouldn't affect us
[18:58.080 --> 19:01.120]  relations with the US or its role in the conflict over the White House
[19:01.120 --> 19:08.400]  condemned the leak these things have been regurgitated from time to time by
[19:08.400 --> 19:12.840]  the media by low-level officials without any endorsement by the US
[19:12.840 --> 19:17.000]  government the spokesman for Pakistan president said in a phone interview from
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.440]  Islamabad there's nothing much in this I tend to agree if you actually know
[19:22.440 --> 19:26.280]  what's already come out and what's been admitted I mean the the massacres are
[19:26.280 --> 19:29.240]  all admitted I mean they'll just line up hundreds of people and shoot them
[19:29.240 --> 19:37.880]  they've got giant torture camps where they admittedly torture people to death
[19:37.880 --> 19:43.520]  I mean it's they've got them all over Europe they've got them in the US they've
[19:43.520 --> 19:49.920]  got them everywhere regardless will continue to break it down on the other
[19:49.920 --> 19:54.280]  side and your phone calls got a lot of financial news police state news and some

[24:10.600 --> 24:14.720]  next segment another issue I'd like to hear from callers on is the fact that
[24:14.720 --> 24:19.520]  Rush Limbaugh came out on Friday and said that it's the ruling class versus
[24:19.520 --> 24:24.600]  the country class he said blue blood robber baron families run the
[24:24.600 --> 24:29.720]  government and are basically getting corporate welfare and hate the American
[24:29.720 --> 24:36.120]  people and want to destroy this country and I'm not really even praising Limbaugh
[24:36.120 --> 24:39.720]  I'm just giving credit where credit is due I certainly don't trust him as soon
[24:39.720 --> 24:44.280]  as the mainline Republicans are back in office I would imagine him to continue
[24:44.280 --> 24:50.400]  with his neocon pro-war pro-torture pro-drug war propaganda but the fact
[24:50.400 --> 24:54.640]  that Rush Limbaugh the biggest media figure in this country nobody has more
[24:54.640 --> 25:00.560]  listeners he's the biggest media event period I went over some of his quotes
[25:00.560 --> 25:06.440]  yesterday on the Sunday show it's amazing and it cannot be disputed that
[25:06.440 --> 25:15.000]  this shows how far the exposure of the shadow government has come and the fact
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.280]  that Glenn Beck's talking about world government in the new world order and
[25:18.280 --> 25:23.440]  is talking about Goldman Sachs being criminal shows that this information is
[25:23.440 --> 25:27.920]  now mainstream so I would ask listeners why do you think they're doing this
[25:27.920 --> 25:33.040]  because I've been monitoring them off and on and overall I think that their
[25:33.040 --> 25:38.520]  listeners are of course my listeners and they just can't get away anymore with
[25:38.520 --> 25:41.880]  denying the fact that there is a world government that there is a global
[25:41.880 --> 25:47.800]  government being formed that the power structure in this country is illegal is
[25:47.800 --> 25:55.640]  criminal is predatory and that you have clicks of power that are waging war
[25:55.640 --> 26:02.040]  against the new vorice the new rich the middle class it's just an amazing
[26:02.040 --> 26:08.880]  admission by Limbaugh and this makes my job a lot easier now that you know his
[26:08.880 --> 26:16.600]  20-plus million listeners are now hearing their iconic leader L. Rushbo
[26:16.600 --> 26:21.360]  coming out and telling the truth to a certain point it shows that to stay in
[26:21.360 --> 26:28.840]  the game to stay relevant they're being forced to do this MSNBC and CNN have
[26:28.840 --> 26:34.000]  decided to continue to report that world governments being formed as our savior
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.520]  and the Federal Reserve is not private and that if you don't want government
[26:38.520 --> 26:42.240]  health care you're a racist and so they're just sticking their head further
[26:42.240 --> 26:46.000]  in the sand and going along with the official line and losing literally
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.520]  almost all of their viewers they are in freefall implosion they are a joke and
[26:51.520 --> 26:57.280]  so we are literally dragging the country from ignorance into enlightenment and
[26:57.280 --> 27:05.200]  it's very exciting news and so that's why I covered that for much of an hour
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.000]  yesterday so if you heard Limbaugh talk about it or you went to info wars.com
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.680]  and red curtain emo story does rush Limbaugh finally get it about the ruling
[27:14.680 --> 27:19.360]  class because I've heard him just in the last year I don't listen often it
[27:19.360 --> 27:22.360]  probably once a week I listened to a few minutes of it you know the banks are
[27:22.360 --> 27:27.200]  good it's okay that Goldman Sachs is getting you know tens of billions of
[27:27.200 --> 27:33.600]  dollars and extra profits and you know oh the socialists want to take over
[27:33.600 --> 27:37.760]  health care and the insurance companies are good the insurance companies wrote
[27:37.760 --> 27:42.080]  the stinking health care bill even the Wall Street Journal admits that
[27:42.080 --> 27:47.280]  Goldman Sachs has swindled us with the derivatives Goldman Sachs isn't just
[27:47.280 --> 27:51.360]  taking down our country many other countries and I've got to say Beck's
[27:51.360 --> 27:55.640]  going even further than Limbaugh though I've never heard Limbaugh attack Ron Paul
[27:55.640 --> 27:58.760]  and others that's why I really have been angry at Beck in the past and I'm
[27:58.760 --> 28:02.920]  certainly not trusting Beck I mean my instincts tell me he's super bad news
[28:02.920 --> 28:08.880]  it's just the fact that Limbaugh and Beck are having to cover these issues is
[28:08.880 --> 28:14.240]  the news story why are they doing that that's my question to you to boil it
[28:14.240 --> 28:20.520]  down to a simple one line statement why are they more and more telling the
[28:20.520 --> 28:26.120]  truth now I do monitor Sean Hannity I hear nothing but mainline neocon blue
[28:26.120 --> 28:32.480]  blood Rockefeller Republican garbage from him and that's why you don't see
[28:32.480 --> 28:39.320]  him rising he's he's plateaued and is even sinking a bit I think that Limbaugh
[28:39.320 --> 28:43.240]  and Beck want a big audience and they know where the audience is the American
[28:43.240 --> 28:47.120]  people have been educated by the internet they have been educated by this
[28:47.120 --> 28:52.760]  radio show they have been educated by my films but I'm powerless without you you
[28:52.760 --> 28:58.600]  are the muscle you move this machine of awakening and I just can't commend you

[33:11.080 --> 33:23.600]  I'm going to your phone calls here in about one minute then I want to get to a
[33:23.600 --> 33:31.360]  story that Hurt Nemo wrote on Friday Ocean Energy Institute founder says new
[33:31.360 --> 33:39.280]  hurricane will require Gulf evacuation this was said on MSNBC and in a
[33:39.280 --> 33:44.000]  Bloomberg article we have another Council on Foreign Relations member of
[33:44.000 --> 33:50.320]  course a few weeks ago in the Washington Post saying this thing is quote 80 times
[33:50.320 --> 33:55.600]  worse than we had previously thought there will be Gulf evacuations when the
[33:55.600 --> 33:59.200]  hurricanes kick up and we're now entering that season and blow those
[33:59.200 --> 34:03.600]  hundreds of millions of gallons of oil and methane gas that's being released
[34:03.600 --> 34:13.000]  from the oil the natural gas into Texas Louisiana Mississippi Alabama Florida
[34:13.000 --> 34:20.120]  all the way up into Oklahoma and Nebraska and other states look I don't
[34:20.120 --> 34:25.360]  know if this is true for two months people have been hyping the end of the
[34:25.360 --> 34:30.240]  world and that there's going to be evacuations in the entire South you know
[34:30.240 --> 34:34.800]  going in 500 miles with really no evidence of that though we do know the
[34:34.800 --> 34:38.960]  government is making preparations in coastal towns for evacuations and we
[34:38.960 --> 34:42.600]  know that during Katrina they use the hurricane as an excuse to come in and
[34:42.600 --> 34:47.400]  confiscate guns and engage in a psychological warfare laboratory so I
[34:47.400 --> 34:51.880]  have no doubt that the government may be planning to use this as some type of
[34:51.880 --> 34:56.920]  big political distraction and fake emergency or hyped up emergency I mean
[34:56.920 --> 35:02.640]  there's there's some reality to it and use that as a distraction going into
[35:02.640 --> 35:08.560]  the election because look at the peak of hurricane season it will be September
[35:08.560 --> 35:13.600]  October November that's the peak it really kicks off in late July starts
[35:13.600 --> 35:18.080]  getting going during August and then September October that's the peak right
[35:18.080 --> 35:24.120]  into November and the election so I don't know what's gonna happen I mean
[35:24.120 --> 35:29.200]  Obama's been lying every time I see him on TV saying nobody's sick the 40 plus
[35:29.200 --> 35:34.040]  million gallons of core exit isn't a problem nobody needs to wear respirators
[35:34.040 --> 35:39.160]  we know he's lying about that so if they were gonna hype a big evacuation and
[35:39.160 --> 35:43.040]  fear monger wouldn't they be fear mongering over the real issues so I
[35:43.040 --> 35:47.360]  don't know we're getting a lot of mixed messages and I'm not even criticizing
[35:47.360 --> 35:50.560]  people that think it's the end of the world and there's gonna be evacuations
[35:50.560 --> 35:55.000]  I think you will see some evacuations at least from coastal towns and there's the
[35:55.000 --> 36:02.040]  devastation of the economy in these Gulf areas but I've seen maps online with no
[36:02.040 --> 36:08.240]  scientific evidence with bad grammar you know with a black line saying get ready
[36:08.240 --> 36:13.960]  to evacuate a red line below it going from Texas through Georgia everything
[36:13.960 --> 36:18.880]  south of it Florida Louisiana Mississippi Alabama saying you know get out
[36:18.880 --> 36:26.600]  of there run for the hills and that just doesn't make sense to me that okay a
[36:26.600 --> 36:31.880]  bunch of this oil comes into shore and you've got to evacuate some of the town
[36:31.880 --> 36:38.960]  the issue is will the feds be in there confiscating guns again I mean are the
[36:38.960 --> 36:43.400]  feds gonna come out and say evacuate 200 miles inland if that happens there's
[36:43.400 --> 36:48.320]  nowhere to put these tens of millions of people remember Houston when they had a
[36:48.320 --> 36:51.960]  hurricane a few years ago and for days people were stuck on the highway and some
[36:51.960 --> 36:57.320]  of them dying of heat exhaustion look all right I said I'd covered it later I'm
[36:57.320 --> 37:00.080]  already covering it now I'm gonna get more into this we start the next hour
[37:00.080 --> 37:03.920]  and a bunch of other news and we'll take your calls on that subject as well but
[37:03.920 --> 37:09.720]  before I go to your phone calls remember last week how the Obama deception got
[37:09.720 --> 37:16.640]  censored and there was such public outcry that YouTube put it back up we
[37:16.640 --> 37:21.600]  are still offering these but I'm getting rid of this special in another week this
[37:21.600 --> 37:27.040]  special is gonna go down because I can't even afford to reprint these at the
[37:27.040 --> 37:31.640]  price I'm shelling them when the DVDs I have or sold we estimate will be about a
[37:31.640 --> 37:37.400]  week Obama deception will go back up to 1995 a piece right now you can get four

[40:04.520 --> 40:07.640]  God bless you I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for making this
[40:07.640 --> 40:13.400]  historical operation we're running possible you are the key and I want to
[40:13.400 --> 40:17.360]  thank you again okay let's go ahead and go to your phone calls let's talk to
[40:17.360 --> 40:22.520]  Peter in Washington Peter you're on the air yes Alex I've known about
[40:22.520 --> 40:28.280]  conspiracies for over 20 years and about two years ago I saw endgame which
[40:28.280 --> 40:34.440]  focused the thing to me now what I'd like to talk about today is I don't think
[40:34.440 --> 40:40.200]  fascism is the correct term for it I'll tell you what I the correct term is
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.360]  first the one I believe is better and then I'll tell you why fascism isn't
[40:44.360 --> 40:49.860]  right I think it's best described as homicidal putocracy well homicidal
[40:49.860 --> 40:56.640]  speaks for itself and putocracy comes to the word Pluto was the pagan god of
[40:56.640 --> 41:01.400]  both wealth and death so the two work together perfectly works better than
[41:01.400 --> 41:06.760]  oligarchy which is it inferior form of government now I don't think fascism
[41:06.760 --> 41:12.240]  because what you're describing is not a government controlling the private
[41:12.240 --> 41:16.820]  sector but the privates is part of the private sector controlling the
[41:16.820 --> 41:24.880]  government and you look at fascism you had a an incorporation of all elements
[41:24.880 --> 41:29.800]  of society into various unions and I don't think that's the theory with the
[41:29.800 --> 41:37.720]  dictator who supposedly reflect all of society and decides various quarrels
[41:37.720 --> 41:42.600]  between them you know I just don't think fascism is right I think calling it
[41:42.600 --> 41:52.720]  homicidal putocracy which shows its basic illegality even how oligarchy is
[41:52.720 --> 41:57.880]  an inferior form of government it's still a government you know they were
[41:57.880 --> 42:02.000]  the rich people think they're doing the best for the rest of society this is
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.960]  this is much more illegal well anyway that's my opinion and I thank you for
[42:07.960 --> 42:12.200]  the time that you've given me well Peter stay there because you're very well
[42:12.200 --> 42:19.920]  spoken and your information is crystal clear and I agree with you when I use
[42:19.920 --> 42:26.600]  terms like fascism or socialism those are derivative terms that the general
[42:26.600 --> 42:33.080]  public in their semantical lexicon can understand and if you look at this
[42:33.080 --> 42:43.400]  system the closest term to describe it is that's in popular use would be
[42:43.400 --> 42:48.520]  fascism because the public sold that this is socialism well they socialize
[42:48.520 --> 42:53.280]  our wealth for social engineering to control us but it is a process of
[42:53.280 --> 42:58.400]  consolidation of power in the hands of the mega rich the ultra elite who are
[42:58.400 --> 43:05.800]  predatory against everyone else it is a click it is a mafia a corporate mafia
[43:05.800 --> 43:09.480]  that's taken control of every major nation on earth but a handful those
[43:09.480 --> 43:12.360]  those nations that aren't under their control because governments are
[43:12.360 --> 43:16.800]  generally corrupt those rogue nations are generally bad as well and have their
[43:16.800 --> 43:21.000]  own problems they're just not as sophisticated and imperial so they're
[43:21.000 --> 43:28.560]  not the threat Libya Iran you can list a few others there North Korea but I do
[43:28.560 --> 43:34.680]  agree homicidal plutocracy is a good term but I would call it a scientific
[43:34.680 --> 43:40.800]  dictatorship because that's how the controllers describe themselves so it
[43:40.800 --> 43:47.320]  is a mafia of royalty of robber barons who in the last 150 years said we want
[43:47.320 --> 43:52.120]  to understand controlling the individual not just nations and how to dumb
[43:52.120 --> 43:57.000]  people down and and the Germans also were competing with their systems of
[43:57.000 --> 44:04.200]  social control so it is 20th and 21st century social control and the elites and
[44:04.200 --> 44:09.800]  all their major publications have openly decided to create the final
[44:09.800 --> 44:15.920]  revolution against humanity a scientific dictatorship that seeks to take
[44:15.920 --> 44:22.100]  control of all industry all production all farming language it's full spectrum
[44:22.100 --> 44:27.760]  dominance to then dumb the population down where they are incapable of
[44:27.760 --> 44:33.120]  revolting because they have been turned into mindless sheep as Bertrand Russell
[44:33.120 --> 44:38.320]  said in the near future under the scientific dictatorship engineered by
[44:38.320 --> 44:45.680]  us in his words he said us a revolt by the proletariat or the or the general
[44:45.680 --> 44:52.000]  population the unwashed masses will be as unthinkable as a revolt of sheep
[44:52.000 --> 44:57.680]  against the practice of eating mutton or sheep for those that don't know what
[44:57.680 --> 45:01.720]  mutton is and so it's like saying you know looking at your front window if you
[45:01.720 --> 45:05.680]  raise sheep and you share them every year but you also sell some for meat and
[45:05.680 --> 45:09.920]  saying yeah the sheep aren't going to come in our house with clubs and beat us
[45:09.920 --> 45:15.840]  over the head and have a revolt and so for the globalist world government is
[45:15.840 --> 45:20.960]  only the beginning once it's in place once you're purely bankrupted and
[45:20.960 --> 45:24.880]  controlled by the nanny state that the health department established in the
[45:24.880 --> 45:29.160]  u.s. around a hundred about 95 years ago or so in England about a hundred and
[45:29.160 --> 45:33.920]  thirty years ago then it was founded for social hygiene racial hygiene for
[45:33.920 --> 45:38.000]  infanticide sterilization drugging of the water that's all publicly stated and
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.800]  that's the plan and it's all being carried out the food's poison the water the
[45:41.800 --> 45:48.360]  drugs the vaccines and it's it's it's meant to block the increase in life
[45:48.360 --> 45:53.400]  expectancy that industrialization brings then the homicidal plutocracy as you
[45:53.400 --> 45:59.760]  amply describe it in good term you've coined there peter they've been profit
[45:59.760 --> 46:04.840]  on extending life when you would be dying at about 65 because of the
[46:04.840 --> 46:08.480]  poisons and things they've introduced they can now extend that a decade or so
[46:08.480 --> 46:13.400]  but they ensure that all of your wealth is then extracted and the average doctor
[46:13.400 --> 46:18.040]  is compartmentalized and isn't aware of this so use what term you want scientific
[46:18.040 --> 46:26.720]  dictatorship monopoly eugenics endgame dictatorship homicidal in-game
[46:26.720 --> 46:35.080]  plutocracy you can use whatever term you want but this is full spectrum
[46:35.080 --> 46:41.680]  dominance how do you have a population of a tribe really fought the Romans if a
[46:41.680 --> 46:48.920]  German tribe or a Austrian tribe or a British tribe would submit and become
[46:48.920 --> 46:52.520]  part of the auxiliaries you have the main legions with the auxiliary foreign
[46:52.520 --> 46:57.960]  armies behind them if they submitted they would be brought into the auxiliaries
[46:57.960 --> 47:02.160]  and normally they'd have to submit and let some of their women be shipped off
[47:02.160 --> 47:06.120]  to slavery and their children be shipped off to be gladiators or to be house
[47:06.120 --> 47:09.800]  servants you know submission was a pretty tough lot but the warrior class
[47:09.800 --> 47:14.280]  would then be allowed to have some whores and have some booty have some gold
[47:14.280 --> 47:19.560]  have some goodies about a third of what the Romans got well many of the Roman
[47:19.560 --> 47:23.280]  tribes weren't citizens yet they had to serve 25 years then become citizens and
[47:23.280 --> 47:30.520]  but if you resist it they would kill everyone every man woman and child the
[47:30.520 --> 47:35.200]  Israelites did this as well they exterminated those in that surrounding
[47:35.200 --> 47:41.320]  area when they took over what is Israel today Jerusalem and of course other
[47:41.320 --> 47:46.600]  countries other tribes did that as well they didn't invent that and use and then
[47:46.600 --> 47:52.360]  they would also salt the earth so no plants could grow in case anybody had
[47:52.360 --> 47:56.720]  run to the hills after the Romans pulled out no one could resist them so the
[47:56.720 --> 47:59.840]  scientific dictatorship said look there's billions of people they're
[47:59.840 --> 48:07.360]  eating up all the resources they're a bunch of dumbed-down masses you know I
[48:07.360 --> 48:10.320]  can go to the shopping mall or Schlitter bond and look at the crowds and they
[48:10.320 --> 48:14.640]  look like hell they look dumbed down I mean maybe people looking at me I look
[48:14.640 --> 48:19.080]  pretty bad but the point is I want to lift those people up not kill them all
[48:19.080 --> 48:22.880]  but the elites look at people and say we want to get rid of these people right
[48:22.880 --> 48:28.480]  now and the globalists say look the public's too dumb to even realize what
[48:28.480 --> 48:32.200]  patriots like myself and you were warning about Peter so why should they
[48:32.200 --> 48:39.440]  even give the population a shot at living and being part of the future when
[48:39.440 --> 48:44.160]  the population doesn't want it they want to die that's the globalist view but
[48:44.160 --> 48:58.080]  anything else Peter no that's fine thank you for giving me the time and I have
[48:58.080 --> 49:02.680]  nothing more to say except I wish you well well I wish you well sir and God
[49:02.680 --> 49:08.200]  bless you I mean it is painful to sit in restaurants or on the street or swimming
[49:08.200 --> 49:14.080]  in a river and to hear adults speak I mean I remember 30 years ago people
[49:14.080 --> 49:18.080]  could speak much better they do now I mean they're like a bunch of animals it's
[49:18.080 --> 49:24.200]  like they've been hit by mutation rays and doesn't matter what color they are
[49:24.200 --> 49:29.400]  or what socio-economic strata even no one says you're welcome when you say
[49:29.400 --> 49:34.080]  thank you or they say no problem you know that means like it's a problem that
[49:34.080 --> 49:41.040]  I'm bringing you a glass of beer at a restaurant adults can't talk I have
[49:41.040 --> 49:44.760]  conversations with people with college degrees who make hundreds of thousands
[49:44.760 --> 49:48.960]  of dollars a year and I'll be using words to describe things and they say
[49:48.960 --> 49:56.200]  what does that mean or they'll think I'm showing off I have had many of my crew
[49:56.200 --> 50:00.240]  when they talk about their rights to police police say you're reading too
[50:00.240 --> 50:06.720]  much we've had TSA repeatedly when people talk about their rights and TSA
[50:06.720 --> 50:12.360]  checkpoints say you're reading too much don't use those fancy words with me if
[50:12.360 --> 50:17.280]  you see Mike judges excellent film idiocracy when he's you know 500 years
[50:17.280 --> 50:24.080]  in the future in a court hearing with a judge the judge can hardly talk and just
[50:24.080 --> 50:28.280]  because the guy has I mean he's kind of like a blue collar dummy in the year
[50:28.280 --> 50:35.720]  2010 but in the year 2300 or whatever it is I forget the exact date no one can
[50:35.720 --> 50:41.920]  even hardly talk they can just make jokes and giggle and laugh and people's
[50:41.920 --> 50:46.760]  easy chairs or toilets because all they do is watch television well I got news
[50:46.760 --> 50:49.840]  for you the globalist aren't gonna let you get to that point they're killing

[54:09.800 --> 54:13.680]  your calls now but it was a really important point he brought up if you
[54:13.680 --> 54:18.160]  underestimate how predatory the ruling class is you've got a problem and
[54:18.160 --> 54:22.360]  finally Limbaugh last Friday admitted there's a corrupt blue blood robber
[54:22.360 --> 54:27.160]  baron these are quotes ruling class that uses government to expand their power
[54:27.160 --> 54:31.880]  and that wants to destroy the middle class and America he finally admits
[54:31.880 --> 54:38.240]  there's a corrupt clique running America he's always denied that this is a big
[54:38.240 --> 54:41.960]  deal it just shows how far we've come now we can have a real debate about this
[54:41.960 --> 54:45.600]  and we would have already been able to have a real debate because we're making
[54:45.600 --> 54:50.000]  Limbaugh and others pass say because they won't cover the real issues very
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.600]  exciting let's talk to Eric in California Eric you're on the air well
[54:54.600 --> 54:58.880]  thank you for taking my call I'm very honored to speak with you I'm a proud
[54:58.880 --> 55:04.040]  prison planet TV member I'm also a former air traffic controller in the US
[55:04.040 --> 55:10.640]  Air Force and once the shock of 9-11 wore off my training pretty much
[55:10.640 --> 55:15.560]  disclosed how absurd 9-11 was but that's not the reason I'm calling the
[55:15.560 --> 55:21.640]  reason I'm calling is that you know with this whole wiki leak story I kind of
[55:21.640 --> 55:29.960]  feel that this is maybe possibly the beginning of the end of independent
[55:29.960 --> 55:35.640]  news to be at the internet I almost get the feeling that it's like a false
[55:35.640 --> 55:40.720]  flag well I agree with you I agree with you whether wiki leaks are is good or
[55:40.720 --> 55:44.680]  not and I tend to think they're good they are now trying to use oh look they
[55:44.680 --> 55:49.000]  use this clip of this government official saying I wouldn't help the white
[55:49.000 --> 55:53.880]  farmer but it was out of context I'm seeing a drumbeat everywhere of the
[55:53.880 --> 55:57.840]  mainstream media needs to shut down the alternative media and now because of
[55:57.840 --> 56:02.280]  this wiki leaks thing we've got to have a gatekeeper to check things first
[56:02.280 --> 56:07.040]  before it can be put on the web because this is just too dangerous and yes
[56:07.040 --> 56:10.280]  that's one of the points I was gonna bring up very very dangerous time go
[56:10.280 --> 56:15.320]  ahead well hey that's all I had to say Alex just keep up the good work and you
[56:15.320 --> 56:19.960]  were very you've enlightened me in many many ways I appreciate that well well
[56:19.960 --> 56:24.480]  let's go back though Eric because the truth is the truth and norad did stand
[56:24.480 --> 56:29.160]  down there were CIA drills and the very targets being hit at the very same time
[56:29.160 --> 56:32.960]  we have the police saying get back the government's gonna blow up building 7 I
[56:32.960 --> 56:38.160]  mean that's seeing in I mean we know the official stories a lie and we can't
[56:38.160 --> 56:43.040]  just choose to say well I'll buy what the government says about 9-11 because it
[56:43.040 --> 56:47.360]  feels better now as a air traffic controller with the Air Force formerly
[56:47.360 --> 56:54.080]  what I mean what what sent up red flags for you well you know 757s are not
[56:54.080 --> 57:01.800]  stealth and you know we were trained to control planes from hitting one another
[57:01.800 --> 57:09.040]  and if beacons went down if communications went down as a controller
[57:09.040 --> 57:15.320]  we still had the responsibility to keep that aluminum from hitting and so we
[57:15.320 --> 57:19.160]  have a primary target that's being painted on a radar screen that's going
[57:19.160 --> 57:26.640]  off its airway you know which is its flight path to its destination and they
[57:26.640 --> 57:31.840]  their story is that they turn the transponders off well when I was
[57:31.840 --> 57:38.240]  controlling from 1983 to 87 you know we could tag those targets and put our own
[57:38.240 --> 57:44.080]  tracking data on it meaning that you know we could have that target and they
[57:44.080 --> 57:49.380]  did mark the targets but then norad came in and took control and put
[57:49.380 --> 57:55.440]  simulation overlays and was removing it well I don't know I mean I don't think
[57:55.440 --> 57:58.960]  any of us know because I had really talked about it but what's absurd is is
[57:58.960 --> 58:04.280]  that those targets those don't go away and if they're off course and you've got
[58:04.280 --> 58:08.920]  a controller that's responsible for that particular aircraft he's also
[58:08.920 --> 58:13.640]  responsible for other aircraft that he's controlling and and then this target is
[58:13.640 --> 58:17.120]  getting ready to hit some other controllers airspace that they have to
[58:17.120 --> 58:21.520]  control they have to let people know and it's not only a controller but that
[58:21.520 --> 58:25.320]  controller has an assistant next to him and then standing over his head he's
[58:25.320 --> 58:30.040]  got a supervisor so the whole damn thing is absurd completely Eric I
[58:30.040 --> 58:33.520]  appreciate your call but what I'm telling you is we have the tapes there
[58:33.520 --> 58:38.240]  were simulations going on to confuse the air traffic controllers we'll be right

[1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:32.640]  calls i need to get into a bunch of important news dealing with the oil
[1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:38.840]  possible evacuations in the gulf the economy also an interesting story i
[1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:44.880]  saw out friday and it's up on info wars dot com where they admit that prozac
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:49.120]  levels going into the gulf of mexico because all the major water supplies
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:53.560]  end up feeding out through those rivers is dumping prozac most of it passes
[1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:57.760]  through you and making the shrimp commit suicide basically they'll swim right up
[1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:03.440]  to birds because it just makes them feel completely confident that's the same
[1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:07.720]  reason in almost every case mass murderers you know people who aren't
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:12.560]  psychopaths mothers who chop their babies arms off mass shooters at schools
[1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:16.760]  they're on the serotonin re uptake inhibitors because it takes all in
[1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:20.600]  addition away and i've known women in college that were on this stuff and let
[1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:25.320]  me tell you they were wild something was wrong with them and i'd date them and
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:30.360]  then i'd quit dating them because something was wrong with them i'll just
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:36.040]  leave it at that but it makes people very promiscuous you name it it just
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:41.720]  shuts off the thinking process let's go ahead and talk to cliff in virginia cliff
[1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:46.760]  you're on the air well yeah look how you're doing good sir i don't want to
[1:01:46.760 --> 1:01:49.880]  talk about some of the wiki league stuff that's been going on
[1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:55.480]  uh... it's difficult of of what they do in the mainstream media is that they
[1:01:55.480 --> 1:02:00.680]  demonize uh... people who try to get the truth out patriots become
[1:02:00.680 --> 1:02:05.960]  terrorists and if you do allow me i'd like to relate a personal antidote
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:11.800]  along those lines uh... if you recall last uh... last october 11th the
[1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:13.720]  anniversary last year
[1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:17.960]  they had a false flag event on the potomac with a coast guard
[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:21.480]  and that incident uh... prompted me to write an email
[1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:23.160]  and my company
[1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:27.040]  and it's a pretty short uh... if you allow me to read it
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:29.760]  uh... these entitled public service announcement
[1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:32.600]  with him with high importance
[1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:36.480]  but today is the eighth anniversary of the day the bush administration
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:38.920]  murdered three thousand people
[1:02:38.920 --> 1:02:42.320]  to enable the illegal invasion of the middle east
[1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:47.280]  this level of treason is unprecedented in the history of this nation
[1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:50.720]  the attacks of september 11th 2001
[1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:54.360]  were not only a physical attack there were a psychological attack on the
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:55.840]  people of this country
[1:02:55.840 --> 1:02:58.560]  in order to sway public opinion
[1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:02.560]  for invasion of the middle east all fields
[1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:04.360]  was home of the lot
[1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:07.240]  at absolutely nothing to do with nine eleven
[1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:09.480]  and publicly stated that fact
[1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:12.640]  the american people have been brainwashed lied to
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:16.120]  deceived and murdered
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:19.080]  george w bush and dick team dick cheney
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:21.960]  or murderers traders and war criminals
[1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:24.400]  they should be tried convicted
[1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:26.440]  and publicly executed
[1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:29.320]  hung by their necks until they are dead
[1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:33.880]  which under the military tribunals is the accepted form of punishment for
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:35.560]  treason
[1:03:35.560 --> 1:03:38.280]  uh... john or is this uh... or is this clef
[1:03:38.280 --> 1:03:39.160]  this is what
[1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:41.680]  yeah clef
[1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:46.360]  i do call for government people to be brought to justice through a legal court
[1:03:46.360 --> 1:03:50.480]  uh... but this is a large platform and my show is not the place
[1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:54.760]  talk about uh... executing former presidents and vice presidents
[1:03:54.760 --> 1:03:57.160]  uh... and so i appreciate your call
[1:03:57.160 --> 1:04:00.960]  i do agree that nine eleven's a false flag attack we know the official story
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:02.120]  is a fraud
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:04.600]  we know that cheney was clearly involved
[1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:06.960]  as for bush he's a complete puppet
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:11.560]  uh... but uh... in in in in in my position
[1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:14.400]  president bush and change you go to prison tomorrow
[1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:16.200]  and all this evil is going to continue
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:18.320]  they are mid-level puppets
[1:04:18.320 --> 1:04:22.480]  uh... and uh... believing this is not the place
[1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:24.720]  for you to probably come on air and
[1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:28.360]  even i understand you're saying after court finds and guilty in all of this
[1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:30.760]  uh... just i don't want any violence
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:33.720]  or to talk about any violence against obama bush
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:34.960]  or any of these people
[1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:36.800]  we're under extreme scrutiny
[1:04:36.800 --> 1:04:39.080]  but separate from that
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:42.600]  i don't believe talk about violence is the way to go
[1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:45.960]  i just want to try to reach out to people
[1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:47.640]  and get them to see the larger
[1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:49.000]  picture of what's happening
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.840]  and then we can come together and decided society
[1:04:51.840 --> 1:04:53.320]  what we're going to do about that
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:56.600]  and i appreciate your call interesting email you sent around work
[1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:58.280]  okay we'll go to uh...
[1:04:58.280 --> 1:05:02.720]  others when we come back up to this quick break

[1:07:04.680 --> 1:07:08.560]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[1:07:08.560 --> 1:07:09.880]  bill number two
[1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:13.960]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[1:07:13.960 --> 1:07:14.760]  you to have
[1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:18.920]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:20.400]  technology is coming
[1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:24.040]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:24.800]  overloaded
[1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:28.720]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:32.240]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:35.320]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:07:35.320 --> 1:07:39.360]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:42.520]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power
[1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:46.120]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[1:07:46.120 --> 1:07:50.880]  can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar
[1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:51.960]  backup dot com
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:56.200]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com or
[1:07:56.200 --> 1:08:03.200]  call one eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five
[1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:14.680]  we are on the march the empire is on the run
[1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:21.680]  alex jones and the gc n radio network
[1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:24.680]  okay coming up
[1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:28.040]  in about twenty five minutes we've got john young of cryptone
[1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:32.320]  give us his inside take on wiki leaks the organization itself
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:36.080]  and these tens of thousands of documents that are
[1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:39.560]  damning to the afghan war
[1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:45.920]  that we're now entering the eighth year off so that is coming up and i want to
[1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:47.840]  hit some other news before he joins us
[1:08:47.840 --> 1:08:52.160]  so let's go quickly to your calls right now john in washington you're on the
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:53.760]  air
[1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:54.720]  alex
[1:08:54.720 --> 1:08:56.720]  yes sir
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:08:58.320]  i read the new york times
[1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:01.320]  right up on the wiki leaks
[1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:04.680]  and it's the headline was the i f i
[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:07.160]  was behind a lot of the
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:08.880]  the attack and
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:12.000]  porting and coordinating that caliban
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:17.440]  uh... and then i watched fox news this morning and they were talking about
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:18.480]  how big of a
[1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:20.640]  security breach it was and how
[1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:22.320]  is going to endanger
[1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:23.280]  troops
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:26.800]  and i know you're going notice exactly i was going to get to that when our guest
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:27.800]  joins us
[1:09:27.800 --> 1:09:31.840]  so now this bolster is having u s troops in pakistan
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:34.800]  they just announced two weeks ago that u s troops are in
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:36.000]  pakistan
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.760]  uh... ron paul and kasinich last week
[1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:40.240]  uh...
[1:09:40.240 --> 1:09:44.240]  tried to create a resolution that they want the house to pass they've
[1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:47.600]  the other now sponsoring it to say this is illegal
[1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:51.920]  i mean we you know we uh... forget just declaring war now congress isn't even
[1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:53.640]  aware of what's going on
[1:09:53.640 --> 1:09:55.760]  and so are you saying that
[1:09:55.760 --> 1:09:58.560]  this was given to wiki leaks by the government
[1:09:58.560 --> 1:09:59.840]  by the pentagon
[1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:03.200]  as a roundabout way to demonize pakistan
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:06.120]  well that's possible but what i was thinking is
[1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:08.800]  they might have it might have just been an actual week
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:11.280]  and it actually shows that the whole war
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:13.360]  is an intelligence operation
[1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:17.560]  it's sort of uh... it's sort of the dog and pony show by the c-i-a-n-i-s-i
[1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:21.080]  i mean that the uh... i-s-i started to move out in the eighties
[1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:24.360]  well we already know this is actually nineteen seventy nine
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:25.680]  speaking bruisinski
[1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:29.720]  in the carter administration brags he started it had them attack the russian
[1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:31.120]  controlled areas
[1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:35.480]  uh... the nation's bordering afghanistan got the russian response then
[1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:39.240]  uh... to take place so the u s didn't get involved later
[1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:41.680]  the united states of the people running our country were involved from the
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:45.240]  start pakistan's been given new expire government
[1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:47.880]  uh... and clearly they have been working with the united states with the
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:49.120]  taliban al-qaeda
[1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:52.840]  remember the airlift of evil guys search engine the airlift of evil
[1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:55.080]  msnbc newsweek
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:58.400]  associated press financial times of london
[1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:01.400]  six thousand taliban al-qaeda leaders
[1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:03.360]  just turned themselves in
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:06.600]  during the afghan war were flown out to safety in pakistan
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:09.600]  to continue the fake war so yes it is stage
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:13.480]  and you're saying from the documents uh... you uh... you think that means
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:14.160]  that
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:16.560]  this adds validity to it
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:19.960]  yeah i think what i think the main thing is to be one of the documents
[1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:22.000]  come out of it uh...
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.760]  i don't know if wikileaks is released and just give it to uh...
[1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:26.720]  there's people in the new york times but
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:27.600]  what's those
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:29.000]  documents come out
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:32.440]  we should uh... do the best we can to pour through those and get some hardcore
[1:11:32.440 --> 1:11:34.200]  evidence of the fraud
[1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:35.400]  this war is
[1:11:35.400 --> 1:11:39.600]  well how do you pour through ninety two thousand classified document some of
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:40.440]  them
[1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:44.200]  uh... can be extremely long portions of them have as you said been published
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:45.880]  now by these papers
[1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:49.160]  uh... and i think wikileaks if they're gonna release it they should release it
[1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:50.440]  to the world
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:54.840]  and i was trying to look around and found a little bit of it but not much in that
[1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:58.440]  that that is a little suspicious so we'll see what uh... john young and of
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:11:59.560]  course
[1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:00.840]  uh...
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:06.680]  wayne madson have to say about this because they're suspicious of wikileaks
[1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:09.880]  i have an open mind on it but i do think we should look at all the angles on
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:12.240]  this what do you think
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:15.840]  i don't know but i thought julie nissange did a ted talk
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:16.720]  and uh...
[1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:18.080]  the ted people are
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:20.680]  the screaming globalist i don't i don't know about this
[1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:21.840]  so i've got it
[1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:26.560]  you know the bleached hair and sort of a sort of an icon that could just be him
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:28.960]  could be the face of uh...
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:33.200]  the free internet i don't know who knows
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:34.400]  what do you think
[1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:38.640]  i don't know uh... i'm analyzing it i'm looking at it i'm talking to people
[1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:40.640]  from every different angle
[1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:44.360]  i'd like to talk to uh... julie nissange myself
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:46.240]  and he's literally what
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:49.200]  more than ten times he mailed us back and forth and says he'll come on and
[1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:50.280]  then doesn't
[1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:53.760]  i mean how many times is it jaren
[1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:56.880]  okay five times i just know we've emailed him more than ten
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:12:59.920]  so he's agreed to come on many times and we want him here
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:04.640]  he's to come on this radio show now his spokesperson when he was in hiding
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:07.360]  brigitte jones dot the air who's a nothing but good work
[1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:09.240]  i mean we know she's for real
[1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:11.960]  uh... you know leading the charge against goldman sacks trying to have a
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:13.920]  internet free zone
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:16.040]  uh... where people can go and blog
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:20.200]  uh... i mean i i i i know she's a great lady and i haven't seen anything to be
[1:13:20.200 --> 1:13:22.640]  able to say i know he's a bad guy
[1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:27.160]  uh... but the whole thing is very important obviously continue to analyze it
[1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:28.480]  i appreciate your call john
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:30.960]  dug in utah you're on the air dug
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:32.800]  well and i i think
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:34.000]  and i
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:35.920]  hey i uh...
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:39.040]  i got three points to make real quickly the first one in answer to your
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:40.480]  question why
[1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:44.320]  are back in limbaugh now looking beyond the left-right paradigm
[1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:48.200]  it could be that it's just now making a lot more sense to them
[1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:52.920]  than it ever did before this paper i read it by uh... kota via
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:56.880]  and it's a very articulate and very right on
[1:13:56.880 --> 1:13:59.680]  i was hoping maybe you'd address the last part
[1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:04.040]  of his paper which is i think about the ninth or tenth paragraph
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:07.960]  uh... from the bottom where he says yet to defend the country class to break
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:10.880]  down the ruling classes presumptions
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:15.720]  uh... the country class has no choice but the imitated democrats at least in
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:19.960]  some ways and for a while and he gives reasons why it really be great to see
[1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:21.120]  the analyze
[1:14:21.120 --> 1:14:24.040]  his ideas on that and then the second thing is
[1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:27.120]  uh... i've been trying to call you for some time
[1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:31.400]  uh... and can't get through but at one point long time ago you talked about the
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:32.880]  mormons a little bit and
[1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:36.600]  i appreciate uh... how you uh... took a neutral stand but
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:41.240]  but i just wanted to get it on the record that the mormons are trying to
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:44.840]  teach the people that the god of this land is jesus christ
[1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:48.520]  jojoba and that he had them a whole lot to say
[1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:52.480]  about the death in the of america in light of these murderous combinations of
[1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:53.760]  the colvin
[1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:57.840]  that uh... we now see all around the states in large part of your effort
[1:14:57.840 --> 1:15:02.040]  and so we're discussing this on my website out of the death dot org and i
[1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:05.080]  just wanted to get that in and then finally
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:06.160]  uh...
[1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:10.040]  after watching your last interview with max keiser i was so intense that the
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:11.160]  bankers
[1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:14.880]  that i went down and made sure i got right in the front row
[1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:17.680]  of our town hall meeting with oren hatch
[1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:22.640]  and uh... i confronted him i i prepared what i'm going to ask him from
[1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:25.320]  from the videos of you and max keiser
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:28.480]  discussing what max called the banking vermin
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:31.760]  and i confronted him and he wanted to dance around it
[1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:36.560]  and uh... and i and i i called him on it i said you don't get it sir and he
[1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:42.800]  got really angry he vowed to go after the banking vermin and and uh... and
[1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:45.560]  well he didn't use those terms that's max uh...
[1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:49.320]  uh... frank well listen i don't listen i had a job was i got news i have to get
[1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:51.200]  to you but i appreciate your points
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:54.320]  i don't get into bashing religious groups
[1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:58.560]  whether it's catholics protestants mormon seventh day adventist
[1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:01.520]  uh... that's a muslims jews
[1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:04.680]  i try to just stand up for what's right
[1:16:04.680 --> 1:16:07.680]  and speak out against government corruption
[1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:10.360]  and then people can make their own decisions
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:13.080]  so many other shows
[1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:17.400]  all they do is in fight with each other all they do is just to send
[1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:21.000]  uh... into arguing with each other and and i'm just here
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.840]  to cover what's happening in the world
[1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:24.960]  and to
[1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:28.360]  try to stop the banks from bankrupting our nation by design to try to stop
[1:16:28.360 --> 1:16:30.880]  world war three with iran
[1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:33.840]  and try to get our troops out of these fraudulent wars
[1:16:33.840 --> 1:16:35.880]  uh... in afghanistan iraq
[1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:39.280]  and to try to get a liberty bill of rights culture back
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:41.280]  i mean that's what i stand for
[1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:44.960]  is getting people realize there's more going on what the mainstream media tells
[1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:48.880]  them and to think for themselves it's very simple
[1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:51.240]  and i'm trying to avert a
[1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:53.800]  violent revolution in this country
[1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:55.920]  but the establishment wants that
[1:16:55.920 --> 1:16:59.080]  and i'm exposing government sponsored terror we have caught the criminals that
[1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:00.120]  run our government
[1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:04.440]  staging terror attacks over and over again
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:07.920]  that's one good thing wiki leaks did what last year they released a two
[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:09.160]  thousand and four
[1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:12.440]  that was the last year that they know it was used
[1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:16.360]  an army training manual for captains in the u.s army
[1:17:16.360 --> 1:17:18.360]  who were in special operations
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:19.600]  captains and above
[1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:22.440]  how to stage false flag terror attacks
[1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:25.480]  and the army admitted it was a real document so they were seeking
[1:17:25.480 --> 1:17:27.960]  to criminally charged whoever gave that to them
[1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:29.960]  they never found out who did it
[1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:32.800]  they've criminally charged the army officer
[1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:35.160]  that released the uh...
[1:17:35.160 --> 1:17:37.440]  gun camera
[1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:38.760]  video footage
[1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:41.960]  from the apaches in two thousand seven and bagdad
[1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:44.000]  killing kids and laughing about it
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:45.840]  shooting up the roiders reporter
[1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:48.040]  i don't know i mean you lay this
[1:17:48.040 --> 1:17:51.040]  i don't like just bashing people without proof
[1:17:51.040 --> 1:17:52.840]  and i see a lot of people
[1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:55.720]  that i respect saying you know they don't trust wiki leaks we're gonna find
[1:17:55.720 --> 1:18:00.600]  out coming up about fifteen minutes uh... but uh...
[1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:03.920]  i just think all the evidence is wiki leaks is good
[1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:06.680]  now does that sometimes they may be fed stuff
[1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:09.960]  by intelligence agencies that they want out there
[1:18:09.960 --> 1:18:11.880]  i'm sure that's going on
[1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:13.800]  uh... but
[1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:18.360]  if you can confirm a documents real you've got to put it out
[1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:20.760]  if it shows wrongdoing and i
[1:18:20.760 --> 1:18:25.240]  my gut tells me wiki leaks is good but
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:26.680]  i don't know that
[1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:28.280]  i can't prove that
[1:18:28.280 --> 1:18:30.720]  uh... but we're gonna have a discussion about it because it's important
[1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:33.040]  this is the top story out there right now
[1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:35.360]  uh... let's go ahead and jam in another call here
[1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:38.360]  let's talk to mike in texas mike you're on the air
[1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:42.000]  hey alex uh... my name is mike i'm state of station here for good i'm originally
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:43.320]  from dallas
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:46.720]  uh... one of the people in my home so i'm sorry to do so you might already know
[1:18:46.720 --> 1:18:49.040]  about it but if you do this might verify
[1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:52.520]  uh... i just got back to mature in iraq a few months ago
[1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:55.560]  and what i did there was a security escort car
[1:18:55.560 --> 1:18:58.440]  and uh... the best way to describe that would be uh... the opening scene of
[1:18:58.440 --> 1:19:00.680]  ironman the people taking tony stark around
[1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:02.120]  uh... that's what we did
[1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:05.520]  course none of the civilians were near school so it was a little bit difficult
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:08.960]  uh... most of them are doctors of agriculture and doctors of science we
[1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:12.000]  uh... transport them all around but uh... the most interesting thing and of
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:13.840]  course i have stories about that but
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:15.680]  for another time it's a little bit lengthy
[1:19:15.680 --> 1:19:17.400]  uh... but most importantly uh...
[1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:19.920]  one day we had uh... at one of our mission briefings of the very early
[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:21.960]  morning uh... we had two guys
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:24.400]  come out when uh... green jumpsuits
[1:19:24.400 --> 1:19:27.120]  and that it looked like a mechanic jumpsuits but uh... and they were in
[1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:31.200]  our gear as far as bulletproof that's going to i'd be able to keep these
[1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:34.840]  uh... and i thought that's a bit further than american flags but they
[1:19:34.840 --> 1:19:36.200]  had often
[1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:36.840]  what
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:39.800]  patches
[1:19:39.800 --> 1:19:42.520]  for the deaf yeah from austin texas
[1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:46.480]  yes from austin texas uh... now these are veterans uh... not veterans of our
[1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:49.640]  war but veterans of all of austin texas walking
[1:19:49.640 --> 1:19:52.840]  and it turns out what they were doing there was uh... training
[1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:56.480]  to learn how we set up our military police checkpoints and how we do raids

[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:16.120]  on the GCN radio network I remember 12 years ago when the Delta Force was
[1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:21.360]  telling emergency manager Thomas Sanchez they were preparing for gun
[1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:26.360]  confiscation and martial law they were just testing and actually finding out
[1:24:26.360 --> 1:24:29.800]  who would work with them and who wouldn't then I interviewed the san
[1:24:29.800 --> 1:24:35.960]  Antonio police chief he kicked him out of their town then I went to the Travis
[1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:40.640]  County SWAT team and warned him and they laughed at me and then six months later
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:46.000]  Lieutenant Beck was his name called up and apologized and said come to my
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:49.440]  office here's Delta Force's card they were here do you know what this is
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:55.520]  about and so all over the country since then they federalized our police it's
[1:24:55.520 --> 1:25:01.000]  part of infraguard it's part of the secret USA last week the Washington
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:05.480]  Post reported on eight hundred and fifty four thousand private corporate
[1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:11.000]  chiefs with infraguard licensed to kill and see that a corporate takeover of
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:15.720]  the government so they're federalizing the police but the feds themselves have
[1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:20.200]  been taken over the military is being converted to contractors and they are
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:24.520]  training the military on how to set up checkpoints lockdown cities go door to
[1:25:24.520 --> 1:25:29.240]  door and take guns and now it's admitted in New York and Illinois the
[1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:34.840]  military is going door to door in knock-and-talk but Mike going back to
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:40.440]  you how long ago was this in Afghanistan and specifically Afghanistan is under
[1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:44.560]  martial law you know tell us about the type of military checkpoints you know
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:49.040]  you're training a man and I mean they thought this was normal I mean give us
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:52.960]  any information you got Mike absolutely but before you before I'm
[1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:57.800]  misinterpreted this is actually in Iraq oh I right Iraq I right and this was I
[1:25:57.800 --> 1:26:02.640]  just got back up about six months ago and I was there for a year now what they
[1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:05.000]  were doing is they were seeing how they were doing we're setting up our check
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:09.480]  points and you've got to understand I'm sure that you do know but in Iraq it is
[1:26:09.480 --> 1:26:13.200]  complete and total martial law and it's been going on for so long that the
[1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:16.800]  people are completely oblivious that they're even being oppressed you would
[1:26:16.800 --> 1:26:20.600]  drive through one military checkpoint get your vehicle searched and before you
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:23.880]  even leave that checkpoint two kilometers down the road you can see where
[1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:27.560]  the next military checkpoint is going to be so I don't even understand how they
[1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:31.320]  could possibly think then another car could get on the highway from no exit
[1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:34.200]  but there will be another checkpoint just to make sure they did not miss
[1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:39.880]  anything now these checkpoints are set up with barricades and they have a pull
[1:26:39.880 --> 1:26:43.400]  over station with the covered in case they really wanted deep search these
[1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:49.440]  vehicles they have dogs each each checkpoint has roughly 12 people so
[1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:53.320]  they make sure to get the vehicle through relatively quickly but it's
[1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:56.880]  still traffic all the time now these people are so used to martial law that
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:27:00.600]  when we're driving down the road in our military trucks and we are about to hit
[1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:04.960]  traffic too dangerous for us to stop so we bump over the median and cross on the
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:08.640]  oncoming traffic traffic now if that were to happen here Americans would be
[1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:11.840]  freaking out pulling out the road calling the police but over there they
[1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:15.120]  just know to pull over and slow down because it's happening again it happens
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:20.880]  all the time now for those that don't know well here's an example I took my
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:26.200]  children to tube in the comal river and we were staying by slitter bond and
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:34.200]  leaving Saturday afternoon the police were there by the dozens and they were
[1:27:34.200 --> 1:27:39.160]  taking photographs of the people getting off the tube trucks because you know the
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:43.160]  truck picks them up at the end of the river and harassing them and taking
[1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:48.280]  photos of everyone they had a checkpoint and a cover and Americans are just being
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:52.680]  bathed in tyranny and now they have marine checkpoints army checkpoints
[1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:58.120]  against citizens that's admitted did these Austin SWAT team guys understand
[1:27:58.120 --> 1:28:02.600]  how they were being acclimated and trained or do they think it was fun I'm
[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:05.320]  gonna be honest with you they thought it was smart now these were guys that were
[1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:08.600]  fresh out of SWAT school these were veterans hardened that are gonna take
[1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:11.960]  what they learned here and go back and train the rest of their buddies and the
[1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:16.240]  noobs that come in now I mean there's a lot of theories and I'm sure there's so
[1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:19.920]  many theories about how exactly and why exactly the Iraq war started because
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:23.480]  there's so many can't even live in a god admits it's a giant laboratory one
[1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:28.480]  reason is to train a giant cohort of troops to come here for martial law go
[1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:32.880]  ahead that's absolutely right that's all it is we've been there and everyone in
[1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:36.960]  my year everyone in the army who's been to Iraq that's pretty much all you do is
[1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:43.520]  you you create martial law you're okay with it is anybody seeing through this
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:46.800]  they know that the bankers have taken over do they know they're planning to
[1:28:46.800 --> 1:28:51.640]  cut our energy off with the carbon tax I'm trying to wake them up not many but
[1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:56.320]  enough to start something what were these guys names in the Austin SWAT team
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:29:01.160]  they did they this was what was weird they had no name tapes the only thing on
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:03.800]  the uniform was Austin SWAT and they thought it was great that they were out
[1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:07.280]  there in fact they're passing out patches to us like we enjoyed having them
[1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:11.440]  out there it's totally illegal well they've expanded Austin SWAT and the
[1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:16.440]  city is completely criminal run they just rob everything the carbon taxes have
[1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:21.280]  been passed and we just live in in a hell because wherever there's money the
[1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:24.680]  parasites are going to be there sucking our blood and I don't even want to go
[1:29:24.680 --> 1:29:27.280]  to new Braunfels now I even got a ticket while I was there I didn't even

[1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:07.160]  it's the top story all over the news I'm sure you've seen it that wiki leaks has
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:11.720]  released 92,000 plus documents mainly dealing with the Afghan war and what
[1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:16.680]  they say are massacres and what I noticed immediately is much of what's in
[1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:19.400]  these documents we haven't had time to go through them all most of them haven't
[1:35:19.400 --> 1:35:22.040]  been released they've been given to the mainstream media which makes me question
[1:35:22.040 --> 1:35:26.520]  things I don't know what's really happening here wiki leaks released an
[1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:30.000]  army document a few years ago where they train captains and above how to
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:35.760]  stage terror attacks in black ops they've released a lot of good stuff but I
[1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:40.040]  know that people I respect like John Young have had some questions Madsen goes
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:45.080]  even further he's joining us coming up in about 25 minutes to give us his take
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:52.400]  on what's happening both with these new documents and what he thinks of wiki
[1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:56.400]  leaks it's also been pointed out and by callers and it is in the New York Times
[1:35:56.400 --> 1:36:01.240]  today that these documents point to the army believing that Pakistan is
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:04.920]  protecting and working with the Taliban well our own government I put up the
[1:36:04.920 --> 1:36:10.360]  MSNBC article it's in my film road to tyranny I put out eight years ago or three
[1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:15.000]  or four months over 9-11 more than eight years ago where they flew 6,000
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:19.440]  Taliban al-Qaeda leaders out to safety it was basically a staged war and we know
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:23.400]  the CIA created the Taliban al-Qaeda we know the CIA admitted a month ago they
[1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:28.440]  created fake bin Laden videos so I don't know what to think of this and it'll
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:34.360]  take a time to really burrow down into it but joining us is John Young kind of
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:39.320]  the proto wiki leaks that's you've been around for more than a decade and was one
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:42.600]  of the guys that helped found with the Electronic Frontiers Foundation and
[1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:47.080]  many other organizations so we know John's a good guy and John give us your
[1:36:47.080 --> 1:36:51.360]  take on this big story well the first thing I'd like to say is that we don't
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:56.240]  know if these files and they are digital files these are not documents these are
[1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:59.880]  not paper documents they're only digital files we don't know if they're authentic or
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:05.240]  not probably have we have three versions and major newspapers and one
[1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:09.480]  version on wiki leaks and these are only digital versions and apparently the
[1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:15.600]  files are made in the field on computers and sent in to headquarters and the
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:19.200]  problem and so I'll just say is first of all when they say it's the biggest dump
[1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:22.640]  of military documents these are not documents these are digital files and
[1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:26.480]  the reason I emphasize that is that digital files are notoriously easy to
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:33.160]  manipulate forage change and doctor and so and none of these three newspaper
[1:37:33.160 --> 1:37:36.560]  sites are wiki leaks provides the original files they only provide
[1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:40.760]  doctored and package versions and so wiki leaks has been known to put up
[1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:44.960]  original documents as does my site but these are not original documents and
[1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:49.000]  they're only digital files so that has not been pointed out how easy it is to
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:53.560]  manipulate digital files and many of the world's intelligence services are
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:58.360]  dumping huge amounts of digital files onto the internet right now and so we
[1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:03.040]  don't know for sure whether this is a major revelation or not our wiki leaks
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:06.360]  has been snookered or if these newspapers have been snookered and it
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:10.240]  hasn't been talked about actually now say this because wiki leaks in the past
[1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:14.080]  has used digital signatures on every one of their documents to prove
[1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:18.320]  authentication this is the first time they've not done that so none of these
[1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:22.080]  files are digitally authenticated by wiki leaks and I'll be fine that
[1:38:22.080 --> 1:38:26.280]  curious we also find it curious that for the first time wiki leaks released
[1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:30.080]  documents to major media before they released it to the public they've
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:34.200]  never done that before they've always opposed that approach so we don't know
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:40.480]  what this means actually whether this is an orchestrated dump of documents how
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:43.760]  would they were able to get this these major newspapers are normally extremely
[1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:49.560]  skeptical of wiki leaks to join this campaign and so the many answers yet to
[1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:54.960]  be answered about whether this is a legitimate release of information or
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:38:58.840]  not so we don't have any we don't have the original files we don't know why
[1:38:58.840 --> 1:39:02.280]  they hooked up this deal with these major newspapers who typically don't work
[1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:10.200]  together like this and there you have it well I think you've I think you've
[1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:16.080]  crystallized it well there and I had noticed that they'd always had digital
[1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:20.640]  signatures before I had noticed that they'd always give it to the public
[1:39:20.640 --> 1:39:24.600]  first and so a lot of things are changing and I noticed the last few months
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:30.040]  the media normally tries to ignore what wiki leaks is doing they've hyped and
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:35.240]  hyped to peak our interest this data dump that now took place and we've seen
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:43.280]  Carl Rove and others famously inject fake documents say into George W. Bush's
[1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:51.480]  Texas National Air Guard record as a way to try to poison the well to discredit
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:56.920]  future documents that come out but we saw them indict the Army officer that
[1:39:56.920 --> 1:40:01.400]  gave wiki leaks the video of the apaches shooting the kids and the
[1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:07.640]  Reuters reporters so I agree with you that this whole thing needs to be examined
[1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:10.880]  and we don't know what's really happening but this is unorthodox for wiki
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:18.560]  leaks it is and and so I'd like to hear from Wayne's view on this he's an expert
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:22.440]  in this kind of thing so disinformation is big business right now in digital
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:28.480]  form because it's so easy to do and that I'm surprised that wiki leaks didn't
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:35.120]  account for itself more and my suspicion is they needed the the cover of these
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:39.080]  major newspapers for this data that they didn't have the confidence to go out on
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:44.160]  it on its own as it usually does so they've somehow managed to induce these
[1:40:44.160 --> 1:40:47.480]  major newspapers to play this role and I'm saying well that's that's rather
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:52.240]  rude that's that's pretty good because it's actually not easy to snooker these
[1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:58.200]  people and so and by the way one of the things that happens which you get this
[1:40:58.200 --> 1:41:01.600]  kind of coverage in major newspapers it's very hard to go back and get people
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:04.720]  to look at the original documents which are tedious and hard to read takes
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:10.520]  forever so the newspaper version starts to prevail and it gets a life of its own
[1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:14.480]  now we know this has happened several times in connection with the Obama
[1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:18.280]  administration where a news report has taken on a life of its own and it's very
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:23.280]  hard to correct it and so we're very surprised that the for example the
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:27.200]  White House has issued this statement by General Jones however DOD has issued no
[1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:32.000]  statement says we're studying the documents we have no statement to me so
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:35.120]  they don't know if they're legitimate or not because they of course one of the
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:39.280]  things that they've done they've they've initiated disinformation campaigns using
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:42.600]  cyberworld they have a whole new command to do that and so they know they're
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:46.520]  pumping out false information themselves and so one of the things that's now
[1:41:46.520 --> 1:41:49.560]  starting to happen in cyberworld is something called blowback where they
[1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:54.640]  for your own attack come back to haunt you and we know that they've been going
[1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:58.840]  after Pakistan with disinformation campaigns and so we would like to see
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:03.160]  what they're going to do now notice that Pakistan and Afghanistan are saying
[1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:08.280]  what's going on here and so they're suspicious that this is an actual
[1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:13.000]  orchestrated campaign I don't want to add fire to the attacks on WikiLeaks we
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:16.800]  have to think that they're doing their best but we also know that governments
[1:42:16.800 --> 1:42:20.640]  are immensely resourceful and using all sorts of outlets to get their message
[1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:26.200]  out well I did notice that the New York Times is able to cherry pick from the
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:31.640]  92,000 documents and say oh look there's evidence in these that Pakistan is
[1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:37.080]  helping the Taliban right as the news is announced that US forces special forces
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:41.160]  are on the ground just a few months ago the Pentagon lied and said we have no
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:45.960]  forces in Pakistan now we know they're lying about that if these documents are
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:50.800]  authentic and so it's pointing the finger at Pakistan yep and as you know
[1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:58.680]  that's a long-running campaign right now and listen it's all fair you know this
[1:42:58.680 --> 1:43:02.080]  is what war is about that the amount these disinformation campaigns as part
[1:43:02.080 --> 1:43:06.720]  of your your on the ground campaigns and the internet is a favorite way to do
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:10.280]  this these days that's why we're we've grown a little bit cautious about stuff
[1:43:10.280 --> 1:43:14.400]  we receive there's so much of this phony information going out in
[1:43:14.400 --> 1:43:18.920]  digital form well I mean here's an example here's an example when I got the
[1:43:18.920 --> 1:43:24.320]  Mayak report from a police officer and then from another federal officer I
[1:43:24.320 --> 1:43:29.360]  got a Homeland Security report I called the phone numbers on it and I did data
[1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:33.320]  searches and found out that that was an FBI office I was about to call and I
[1:43:33.320 --> 1:43:37.120]  called the person said who gave this to you you know let me put you to my
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:42.040]  superior and I kind of flummoxed them and they said yeah that's real you're not
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:46.160]  supposed to have that and plus I'd already seen previous documents they put
[1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:50.640]  out that had been released and declassified in decades before and I
[1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:54.120]  knew it was ADL Southern Poverty Law Center I could even search whole
[1:43:54.120 --> 1:43:58.760]  paragraphs and find it in ADL Southern Poverty Law Center reports so I went on
[1:43:58.760 --> 1:44:01.840]  air and I said it was real and they later came out and had a congressional
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:05.600]  investigation they had a state house investigation and confirmed they were
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:09.760]  real but so many documents I get I just say delete that out of the inbox
[1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:15.240]  there's no way to find the providence of that and and again I don't have a big
[1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:21.680]  crew and I'm I'm pretty much the only person I trust you know because my my
[1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:24.800]  butts on the line to be able to go forward with stuff so most stuff I've
[1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:29.400]  been sent goes right in the shredder or gets deleted just because I mean
[1:44:29.400 --> 1:44:33.160]  absolutely I mean because most of the stuff I get sent is disinfo
[1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:38.680]  yep well then your term provenance is a good one because you know in many fields
[1:44:38.680 --> 1:44:42.320]  this is crucial to figure out whether something is fraudulent or not is to
[1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:46.400]  have a traceable provenance and in digital world this is extremely difficult
[1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:52.280]  to do and so that but turns out Alex you probably know and Wayne can talk more
[1:44:52.280 --> 1:44:56.400]  about that there are a tactical means to trace a digital document below what most
[1:44:56.400 --> 1:45:01.160]  people have access to there are spores and clues that are left in that unless
[1:45:01.160 --> 1:45:06.320]  it's very thoroughly sanitized by professionals in fact all computers put
[1:45:06.320 --> 1:45:12.120]  secret codes in the text printers put secret code in the text and then every
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:15.080]  time the computer makers and printer makers get caught they go oh it's an
[1:45:15.080 --> 1:45:19.520]  accident but no I mean they've got a data stream in all of this well here's
[1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:22.520]  one of the technical things and I'm not an expert is that everything that goes
[1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:27.600]  over there that you know it's broken into packets and then reassembled an
[1:45:27.600 --> 1:45:31.920]  expert can trace those packets backward because that's how the system is able to
[1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:37.560]  breathe assemble the packets and it's a well-known spy technique to trace
[1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:41.640]  through this packet route not the entire file but the packets contain the code
[1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:46.360]  for their reassembly at the receiving end so unless you sanitize it very
[1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:49.480]  carefully something's going over the internet the next bird can go right back
[1:45:49.480 --> 1:45:53.360]  to the source now that's not well known because these people people are doing
[1:45:53.360 --> 1:45:58.800]  that want to keep it secret well the best way to do it is from a computer that
[1:45:58.800 --> 1:46:03.920]  you didn't buy from a store and then to pull up outside of a coffee shop jack
[1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:08.560]  into their network and use something like a gmail account because then there's
[1:46:08.560 --> 1:46:12.240]  almost no way for him to track it back
[1:46:13.840 --> 1:46:17.920]  depends and I don't want to sound too mysterious here but I'm saying well the
[1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:21.720]  the technology is pretty far advanced so a lot of the stuff that we read in the
[1:46:21.720 --> 1:46:26.680]  newspaper about capabilities is not all there is to it only because the how to
[1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:31.760]  do this is so valuable is that it's just not going to come out and so one of
[1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:34.760]  the things that are one of our critiques of WikiLeaks is that they're going
[1:46:34.760 --> 1:46:39.400]  sunshine about the protection they offer their sources I happen to look at
[1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:43.280]  their side a lot and watch it over the years and it is it's completely leaky
[1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:48.080]  their side is a consumer-grade snake all about protection
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:53.400]  Julian the son who's very skilled at this probably knows that the thing is
[1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:57.680]  that only a person who's been at this for several years know what's wrong with it
[1:46:57.680 --> 1:47:02.240]  but so I call it a consumer-grade protection but it's not something that
[1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:07.120]  would ever keep an expert from getting into their stuff and tracing it but
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:10.160]  experts never tell you what they're doing because that's too valuable keep it
[1:47:10.160 --> 1:47:13.960]  to themselves and so WikiLeaks now it's quite possible that WikiLeaks has
[1:47:13.960 --> 1:47:18.360]  another side that they handle very sensitive stuff and this consumer-grade
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:24.840]  is just for consumer stuff and that you know intelligence agencies have multiple
[1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:29.320]  ways they move communication including all the phony ways so one of things I'm
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:35.440]  intrigued with WikiLeaks is whether they actually think that their side because
[1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:38.800]  they have a page after page after page are the ways that they protect people
[1:47:38.800 --> 1:47:43.320]  and that's the usual sign of snake all actually you're over promising and I
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:48.720]  don't know why they're doing that actually because it doesn't make sense to
[1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:52.600]  security experts to go on at length this way but you're a sign of deception
[1:47:52.600 --> 1:47:58.240]  well you know the Army officer that reportedly gave him that video he
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:02.880]  didn't get protected too well but the word is he shot his mouth off well you
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:06.960]  often see those stories it's what I call the lost laptop story it's called a
[1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:13.120]  misleading story about how it happened and so there are a number of subterfuges
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:17.080]  out to cover up how people are actually traced and some of you said my god how
[1:48:17.080 --> 1:48:20.680]  could they have been so stupid so how did someone get drunk in a bar and lose a
[1:48:20.680 --> 1:48:25.040]  laptop and so lost laptops or something of a joke as a reason for
[1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:30.360]  orchestrated leaks so we actually don't know yet by the way WikiLeaks is aware
[1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:35.000]  of this they they're cautious about whether about the reality of the
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:41.960]  Bradley Manning ploy and so that they've never owned up that this is a
[1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:46.680]  legitimate story well we can also get a bird's-eye view into what's really
[1:48:46.680 --> 1:48:50.240]  happening here by the way the media responds analyzing the way they're
[1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:56.320]  putting these reports out the angles they're going with this story at your
[1:48:56.320 --> 1:49:00.600]  preliminary investigation at your gut level from decades of researching this
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:03.720]  Mr. Young what do you think's really going on here
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:08.800]  a willing suspension of disbelief that many of these reporters are not
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:13.800]  technically adept about what about information security and they so much
[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:20.400]  want a work person like a science that he's working on like made-off does so
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:26.120]  there's a I call it media entertainment he's very entertaining guy now wait a
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:29.400]  minute first you're saying you think they're trying to do a good job and you
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:33.200]  don't want to bash him and now you're comparing him to made-off well I'm saying
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:38.400]  you said he's doing a good job about promotion of WikiLeaks he's really
[1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:44.600]  media savvy he's a very photogenic guy he's a good performer he's got a side
[1:49:44.600 --> 1:49:49.120]  that looks very appealing to someone who's not very technically adept and
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:55.520]  so he's a human and that's what expel fraudsters are good at well here's my
[1:49:55.520 --> 1:50:02.640]  concern here's my concern I think and callers have broached this as well that
[1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:07.520]  they're going to use this to quote have a gatekeeper and the whole echelon NSA
[1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:10.760]  takeover of the web in fact they're already actually saying that that oh
[1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:14.120]  because this classified stuff keeps getting out on the web we've got to have
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:17.120]  everything go through a gatekeeper first and that's the way that the
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:20.720]  establishment is going to announce the fact that everything's already going
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:28.440]  through a gatekeeper that's already seen in the works but having lived for 500
[1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:32.400]  years there's an answer to that there's always another answer to that and so I
[1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:36.040]  can say this about WikiLeaks is I think they kicked the ball down the road a
[1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:42.520]  little bit further that I think that they have to expose some communication
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:47.920]  vulnerabilities that will be closed on it and new ones will come along and
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:51.080]  they'll be people come along after WikiLeaks learning from their experience
[1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:55.640]  I'm sorry learning from them stay there stay there final segment with John
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:51:02.160]  young of krypton.org I'm Alex Jones with info wars.com stay with us hi this is

[1:51:12.760 --> 1:51:16.200]  gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:19.960]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at

[1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:10.200]  remember five years ago a couple hundred photos from Ambu, Grain but that
[1:54:10.200 --> 1:54:15.800]  released it turned out that Congress was given one day by the Pentagon I guess
[1:54:15.800 --> 1:54:21.040]  as the Pentagon's the boss of Congress everything's backwards to look at
[1:54:21.040 --> 1:54:25.240]  thousands of videos and photos and they admitted it showed children being
[1:54:25.240 --> 1:54:30.000]  raped tortured and a lot of evidence showed that those photos were actually
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:33.720]  leaked by the government because they knew that more of this stuff was about
[1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:37.920]  to come out as a way to whitewash and they released some of the more tame
[1:54:37.920 --> 1:54:43.560]  abuse that was going on that could kind of be laughed off I mean I've seen so
[1:54:43.560 --> 1:54:48.640]  many confirmed reports of torture people being killed massacres in Afghanistan
[1:54:48.640 --> 1:54:54.440]  and now you see all this stuff coming out look look I don't know the truth
[1:54:54.440 --> 1:54:59.280]  about WikiLeaks and I think they've done a lot of good work I mean a lot of the
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:02.280]  stuff I've seen them put out I guarantee you the Pentagon's not happy about and
[1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:07.200]  they've confirmed it's real so I guess this is a hall of mirrors that we're in
[1:55:07.200 --> 1:55:13.360]  but time will tell John Young from Krypton any other points you want to
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:17.640]  add along this line that's about it Alex
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:27.520]  overall I mean what correct me if I'm wrong but early on you did work with
[1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:33.240]  WikiLeaks some correct yep for a month and then and then what what made you
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:38.560]  pull out well is that they said they're gonna raise five million dollars the
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:44.680]  first year and I said you can only do that by corrupt means or by government's
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:47.480]  funding you and I don't want to be part of anything like that you got to
[1:55:47.480 --> 1:55:52.960]  establish credibility first so they kicked me off the list and I still think
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:56.120]  that's what you're up to I think they're gonna monetize this operation and start
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:55:58.960]  selling stuff on the black market if they're not already doing it or selling
[1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:03.520]  it to the news media or so the government's it's a honeypot but it's
[1:56:03.520 --> 1:56:07.640]  also a potential black market operation and so I'm just saying that's what it
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:11.120]  looks like to me from the outside you go there and you look and you see this
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:16.520]  and if you don't suspend disbelief it stinks well that's what Madsen says of
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:20.480]  course he worked with the NSA and others he's made connections to Soros and
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:26.600]  others and he says they want to make Iceland kind of a backwater where they
[1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:32.840]  can selectively decide what they want to release basically like Carl Rove burning
[1:56:32.840 --> 1:56:39.440]  the ambassador and the CIA people that this is a way to fence that information
[1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:45.680]  out well and and the issue here comes back to the fact that we don't actually
[1:56:45.680 --> 1:56:49.440]  know who they are or how they operate or what the money is or anything else and
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:53.720]  so but they're lack of and I hate the term transparency because it's terribly
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:59.400]  abused these days but we don't actually know what they're up to and so that just
[1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:05.720]  looking at what they say they certainly behave like fraudsters and so I'll just
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:10.520]  say look at the obvious that they're they're not behaving like trustworthy
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:15.000]  people trustworthy people are not this cautious they don't exaggerate their
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:17.960]  accomplishments they don't lie about who they are and what they're up to they
[1:57:17.960 --> 1:57:22.280]  don't withhold this information but people are up to no good do exactly that
[1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:26.400]  and you're saying wiki leaks has done that I mean at the start of the interview
[1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:29.920]  you said that you thought they were trying to do some good things well I'm
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:33.520]  saying is that the intent of putting out documents without going through
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:40.000]  authoritative sources is a noble goal but the way they're operating makes you
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:44.040]  wonder why is this being done you're saying you're saying you smell a rat
[1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:50.240]  well I'm saying is the documents are to be trusted they are not and this last
[1:57:50.240 --> 1:57:53.680]  few months where they shut down the site and gone on a PR campaign and
[1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:57.080]  fundraising campaign all the documents have stopped and so and now they come
[1:57:57.080 --> 1:58:01.560]  out with digital documents which are typically fraudulent they still haven't
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:05.840]  put out reliable documents in six months I don't know why they've done that well

[2:01:54.040 --> 2:01:57.320]  Press Club and I spent a lot of time reading much of his bio because we don't
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:02:05.600]  normally do that he's specifically well vetted and and has a lot of gravitas on
[2:02:05.600 --> 2:02:09.720]  not just the NSA Homeland Security cybersecurity takeover that's past
[2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:15.640]  committee now going to the full Senate but wiki leaks and black ops and dirty
[2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:19.720]  tricks and basic sneakiness and so we're going to break here in three minutes
[2:02:19.720 --> 2:02:24.840]  but Wayne we can talk about what this what these reports look like to you how
[2:02:24.840 --> 2:02:28.440]  they may use it to censor the internet what you think of wiki leaks you've
[2:02:28.440 --> 2:02:35.760]  got the floor let's let's go over it well Alex what I've seen with the what
[2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:42.680]  the reporting these 90,000 documents are they're the highest classification is
[2:02:42.680 --> 2:02:47.880]  secret now we know that the intelligence community is overclassifying
[2:02:47.880 --> 2:02:52.720]  things so really what do we have here do we have anything that's really
[2:02:52.720 --> 2:02:58.960]  shadowing or do we have something that probably could be found on it on the
[2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:05.480]  front page of any daily newspaper we know we know that from these leaked
[2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:11.720]  documents that there's a mess in Afghanistan and Pakistan well we already
[2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:17.160]  knew that we knew that from Ambassador Carl Likenberry's cables back to
[2:03:17.160 --> 2:03:21.880]  Washington to the State Department that stated that you know backing this guy
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:30.400]  Hammett Karzai is the total disaster and so what do we know that's new what we
[2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:35.960]  have here are three newspapers selected for these leaks the New York Times the
[2:03:35.960 --> 2:03:41.320]  Guardian in the UK and their spiegel in Germany and I think all three are
[2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:46.000]  problematic when it comes to leaks because these are well-known papers that
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:50.160]  work like hand and glove with intelligence absolutely and we know that
[2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:55.480]  their spiegel for example is pushing for the war against Iran they supported the
[2:03:55.480 --> 2:04:01.800]  United States and the Russian war in South Ossetia against Georgia we know
[2:04:01.800 --> 2:04:06.360]  that the Guardian has some links to George Soros there and again and we know
[2:04:06.360 --> 2:04:11.560]  that Soros and his friends like Cass Sunstein are big promoters of wiki
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:17.480]  leaks which is bizarre because we've got Sunstein saying censor the internet
[2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:21.280]  this looks like it could be their excuse but that's what I noticed yesterday
[2:04:21.280 --> 2:04:24.480]  and today reading these articles is notice they're saying oh look it shows
[2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:28.920]  that Pakistan's helping the Taliban right as the West wants to go into
[2:04:28.920 --> 2:04:33.360]  Pakistan and admits we have special forces on the ground so it's very
[2:04:33.360 --> 2:04:38.600]  suspicious Wayne Madsen stay there let's come back and go over all of this and
[2:04:38.600 --> 2:04:44.080]  talk about the fact that these communiques 92,000 of them are in digital
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:49.840]  format so we'll discuss it all straight ahead with Wayne and Madsen I'm Alex
[2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:56.760]  Jones you're listening to the GCN radio network GCN live.com is the website
[2:05:00.160 --> 2:05:04.120]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[2:05:04.120 --> 2:05:08.440]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[2:05:08.440 --> 2:05:12.640]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[2:05:12.640 --> 2:05:16.680]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[2:05:16.680 --> 2:05:20.560]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[2:05:20.560 --> 2:05:24.680]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:05:24.680 --> 2:05:29.000]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:33.280]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:37.000]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:41.200]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[2:05:41.200 --> 2:05:44.560]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[2:08:05.440 --> 2:08:12.160]  Jones on the GCN radio network all right investigative journalist Wayne Mattson
[2:08:12.160 --> 2:08:16.560]  is working in the NSA written for some of the biggest newspapers in the country
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:22.280]  is our guest bottom line we're only a few days into this WikiLeaks situation
[2:08:22.280 --> 2:08:26.600]  reportedly documenting massacres in Afghanistan but that's already been in
[2:08:26.600 --> 2:08:33.360]  the news from your well-researched position what do you bottom line things
[2:08:33.360 --> 2:08:39.920]  going on here Wayne well there's a number of journalists long-time journalists
[2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:44.640]  in Washington were very suspicious of the motives behind WikiLeaks and these
[2:08:44.640 --> 2:08:52.240]  so-called leaks we you know it's clear that WikiLeaks has been engaged in a
[2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:59.400]  big fundraising operation and the John S. Knight Foundation actually turned them
[2:08:59.400 --> 2:09:04.200]  down for a grant because they just didn't think that they passed the smell test
[2:09:04.200 --> 2:09:09.120]  and as I say there's many people first of all the job of any journalist is to
[2:09:09.120 --> 2:09:14.520]  protect their sources now this guy this army private who supposedly leaked some
[2:09:14.520 --> 2:09:19.360]  of this information to WikiLeaks he was outed by a guy out of San Francisco who
[2:09:19.360 --> 2:09:25.480]  had a relationship with WikiLeaks who's in a former computer hacker a song is a
[2:09:25.480 --> 2:09:30.440]  former Julian Assange is a former hacker that now this ever goes back to the
[2:09:30.440 --> 2:09:37.680]  1980s and the computer hacking on defense computer systems which I was
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:43.040]  involved with from the government side and all of a sudden we have these guys
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:49.320]  pop up again they they had this group one of the groups was the chaos computer
[2:09:49.320 --> 2:09:55.440]  club out of Hamburg Germany they did real damage the national security so I
[2:09:55.440 --> 2:10:02.440]  think it's significant today is the anniversary of the 1988 internet worm
[2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:06.920]  launch that was launched on the internet brought down a lot of computer
[2:10:06.920 --> 2:10:12.600]  systems defense government corporate computers and the guy who released it
[2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:17.880]  Robert Morris Jr. released that worm from Cornell University his father was
[2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:22.360]  the chief scientist for the National Security Agency now everybody at the
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:27.880]  time was of the opinion that this is obviously just an experiment by NSA to
[2:10:27.880 --> 2:10:33.120]  pulse the net to see how vulnerable it was to this type of malicious software
[2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:37.400]  and that's where you that's that's exactly where I was going and and perhaps
[2:10:37.400 --> 2:10:42.760]  WikiLeaks if this is the case doesn't know that they're being used but you
[2:10:42.760 --> 2:10:46.960]  notice that right as they're trying to pass cybersecurity it's past the Senate
[2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:51.760]  Committee now to admittedly take over the web funnel everything through the NSA
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:57.040]  to gatekeep and to surveil right is this happening we've seen the last year
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:01.080]  cybersecurity command it's already been set up and operating the Air Force has
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:07.320]  said we're gonna launch attacks on ourselves to test this and now they're
[2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:10.720]  trying to use this as a way to say oh we've got to start gatekeeping the web
[2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:17.120]  to stop security leaks like this I mean I just see the timing of all of this you
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:22.440]  know really doesn't pass the smell test but I've also seen some good work by
[2:11:22.440 --> 2:11:26.600]  WikiLeaks but at the same time isn't that what an intelligence group or a
[2:11:26.600 --> 2:11:30.320]  private corporate intelligence group would do I mean you know any double or
[2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:35.320]  triple agent is going to put out some good information so that the other side
[2:11:35.320 --> 2:11:40.800]  whatever that side is will then start taking the bait right you've got to
[2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:45.520]  establish your bona fide credentials and that that would be all part of that
[2:11:45.520 --> 2:11:50.880]  to give people if they give us the appearance that you're actually engaged
[2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:54.720]  in leaking information now a lot of people are looking at this as the
[2:11:54.720 --> 2:12:01.800]  Pentagon papers the redux but it's totally different because the Pentagon
[2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:06.960]  papers there was no question as to their authenticity when they were released by
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:12.440]  Dan Ellsberg but in this case as you mentioned that these these documents
[2:12:12.440 --> 2:12:17.480]  are in digital form and we know that that the neocons stock and trade is
[2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:22.760]  forgeries and misinformation and disinformation and I would be very
[2:12:22.760 --> 2:12:26.600]  suspicious of anything that comes in over the
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:34.640]  transom in just digital form 48 hours into this you've been analyzing the way
[2:12:34.640 --> 2:12:38.800]  the news is covering it there's Spiegel the Guardian in the New York Times and I
[2:12:38.800 --> 2:12:43.760]  see them trying to say oh look Pakistan's working with the Taliban I mean
[2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:47.600]  out of the gates I see it being used against Pakistan and Pakistan is in the
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:52.400]  news today saying we find this to be very suspicious well also you know I
[2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:57.360]  noted in the guard in the Guardian article that they went to page to convince
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:01.240]  the readers that they paid no money to WikiLeaks for these documents that
[2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:07.320]  WikiLeaks had no editorial control were not involved with the writing of the
[2:13:07.320 --> 2:13:13.240]  the story and that they double-checked a lot of the information with other
[2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:18.040]  sources my god what what are you double-checking your this information you
[2:13:18.040 --> 2:13:23.800]  can double-check any major newspaper or any other news website and then find
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:29.240]  out that the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan is disastrous so we're not
[2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:33.720]  breaking any new ground here with these so-called revelation well that's like
[2:13:33.720 --> 2:13:41.080]  the lithium story there was a Russian report from 85 there was a 2001 and 2002
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:45.160]  US report they knew that lithium was there they mean they know there's
[2:13:45.160 --> 2:13:49.480]  trillions of oil there what did you make of that supposed leak that we were
[2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:53.440]  really there for the lithium well I think it did you know there's a lot of
[2:13:53.440 --> 2:13:58.360]  people that would then say oh we have to be in Afghanistan because we need access
[2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:03.480]  to these critical national security resources yeah I was very suspicious of
[2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:10.440]  that as I'm suspicious of any any time there's a discovery of oil or some other
[2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:15.760]  critical natural resource like cocaine which has allowed the US to increase its
[2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:19.920]  military presence in Central Africa Wayne I want to be specific though
[2:14:19.920 --> 2:14:24.440]  because I don't know Julian Assange he seems like he's done some good work but
[2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:31.800]  I respect you I respect the John Young from Cryptome and I've seen a lot most
[2:14:31.800 --> 2:14:34.720]  of what you've talked about unfortunately has come true so I know
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:39.720]  you're a really good source and and I believe that that you know you believe
[2:14:39.720 --> 2:14:42.800]  you have well-founded reasons to not trust them but going back are you
[2:14:42.800 --> 2:14:48.600]  specifically saying that this Julian Assange guy is a famous hacker involved
[2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:52.680]  in going after US military computers in the 80s well this is this is the
[2:14:52.680 --> 2:14:57.200]  background of the WikiLeaks group one of the principles with WikiLeaks it has
[2:14:57.200 --> 2:15:03.360]  been associated with a chaos computer club in Germany I think the fact is
[2:15:03.360 --> 2:15:08.880]  that these people travel around the world they say that there's government
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:14.120]  agents after them I think that there needs to be more transparency with
[2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:18.200]  this organization well they'll come back as well we have to be secretive
[2:15:18.200 --> 2:15:22.200]  because of the information and the people we're dealing with well if this
[2:15:22.200 --> 2:15:26.120]  private manning is any indication of how they protect their sources there
[2:15:26.120 --> 2:15:29.880]  just more failures because this guy is looking at years in prison because he
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:34.440]  was outed by one of these one of these people that was associated with WikiLeaks
[2:15:34.440 --> 2:15:38.560]  that's not how an investigative journalist deals with their sources they
[2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:43.600]  go to great pains to protect their identities and so far their track
[2:15:43.600 --> 2:15:49.520]  record gets a big fat F what about the providence of these documents young
[2:15:49.520 --> 2:15:52.960]  pointed out they had digital signatures on them before that they were actual
[2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:58.880]  physical documents scans of those and that this disgorgement of 92,000 plus
[2:15:58.880 --> 2:16:05.720]  documents breaks with two things they're entirely digital a you know they're
[2:16:05.720 --> 2:16:11.680]  their texts they're not copies of paper a their digital text B they didn't
[2:16:11.680 --> 2:16:15.560]  disgorge them to the public first as they've always done they went directly
[2:16:15.560 --> 2:16:20.560]  to powerhouse mainstream media establishment groups like the New York
[2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:24.800]  Times that help lie about yellow cake and aluminum tubes in Iraq
[2:16:24.800 --> 2:16:30.200]  Oh absolutely I think with the track record of the New York Times and the
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:37.280]  track record with Der Spiegel on Iran I think we have to be very skeptical now
[2:16:37.280 --> 2:16:43.880]  it could be fair that WikiLeaks they were criticized before for not
[2:16:43.880 --> 2:16:50.360]  engaging the media the journey journalists but I think I think they
[2:16:50.360 --> 2:16:55.160]  went the other direction here by selectively making this information
[2:16:55.160 --> 2:17:00.080]  available to some media sources that have shown themselves in the past
[2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:05.840]  not to be all that trustworthy what does your gut tell you Wayne well my
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:11.600]  gut my gut tells me that this could be even though the Obama White House is
[2:17:11.600 --> 2:17:17.960]  criticizing this quote-unquote leak as terrible I think we have to look there's
[2:17:17.960 --> 2:17:23.240]  a lot of people in the in the military who think that this foray into
[2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:28.520]  Afghanistan is a law's cause that we ought to pull out so are they you know
[2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:34.760]  is the White House you know are they shedding crocodile tears over this or
[2:17:34.760 --> 2:17:42.680]  do they see a long-range opportunity to start to convince the public that look
[2:17:42.680 --> 2:17:47.840]  this is such a failed policy maybe we need to think about some sort of
[2:17:47.840 --> 2:17:51.520]  withdrawal well if that was the case to interrupt if that was the case and hold
[2:17:51.520 --> 2:17:55.360]  that thought then we would see that mirrored in the mainstream news and we've
[2:17:55.360 --> 2:17:59.840]  suddenly seen a lot of big Republicans the the Republican Party chairman and
[2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:05.080]  many others saying Afghanistan is Obama's war we need to get out of there
[2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:09.200]  and we've been hearing the Pentagon say that and so I think that adds a lot of
[2:18:09.200 --> 2:18:12.520]  validity to what you just said Wayne right and we get what we have coming out
[2:18:12.520 --> 2:18:17.320]  we have a big election coming up and and the Democrats are being seen as
[2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:21.680]  possibly losing a number of seats in the Senate in the House so this could be an
[2:18:21.680 --> 2:18:25.920]  effort at some sort of damage control this could be what I call a control
[2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:30.320]  hemorrhage leaking this information the White House is oh this could put our
[2:18:30.320 --> 2:18:34.400]  troops in jeopardy well you know I mean we already know it's a mess over there
[2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:38.440]  how are they going to be in any more jeopardy when they release the highest
[2:18:38.440 --> 2:18:42.520]  level secret which with over classification that would at best be
[2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:50.000]  confidential or for official use only or unclassified in the past yeah because
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:54.840]  Ellsberg's reports those were the highest level government and in think tank
[2:18:54.840 --> 2:19:00.200]  analysis from the big brain bugs that the war was a complete failure not
[2:19:00.200 --> 2:19:04.800]  battlefield communicates no you're right the Pentagon papers came out of the
[2:19:04.800 --> 2:19:09.200]  rain corporation which was basically writing policy in Vietnam and in the
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:15.840]  China so what we have here you know what what do we have emails cable
[2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:20.920]  traffic between a diplomat the U.S. diplomats and State Department I mean
[2:19:20.920 --> 2:19:26.920]  where's the where's the criticality here except for the fact that these
[2:19:26.920 --> 2:19:31.560]  documents all approve what we already knew that there's a lot of dissension
[2:19:31.560 --> 2:19:37.720]  in the ranks with this totally messed up policy we have in Afghanistan but that
[2:19:37.720 --> 2:19:41.960]  also gives validity that it's real and wiki leaks are doing a good job because
[2:19:41.960 --> 2:19:45.120]  that's the type of thing they're gonna be leaked is something that a captain or
[2:19:45.120 --> 2:19:49.960]  colonel who's mad can put on a memory stick and give to him so it's it's just
[2:19:49.960 --> 2:19:53.400]  a hall of mirrors I want to come back and talk about the cyber security act
[2:19:53.400 --> 2:19:57.800]  itself and the end of the free internet as we know it with Wayne Mads and

[2:24:05.560 --> 2:24:11.040]  big news blitz coming up Wayne Madsen's our guest Wayne they've passed the
[2:24:11.040 --> 2:24:16.020]  Cybersecurity Act out of the Senate Committee as you know it's publicly the
[2:24:16.020 --> 2:24:21.080]  end of the free internet if they're able to get it launched and carry it out the
[2:24:21.080 --> 2:24:25.760]  public is starting to wake up to this and as a security expert and internet
[2:24:25.760 --> 2:24:31.920]  expert give us your view on the future of the web well I think the idea of the
[2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:37.640]  president having the authority to throw a kill switch should send shutters down
[2:24:37.640 --> 2:24:43.400]  everyone's fine we have to look at the three senators who proposed this who
[2:24:43.400 --> 2:24:47.240]  really shepherds through the Senate Joe Lieberman and we don't have to say
[2:24:47.240 --> 2:24:52.400]  anything more about him but the the other one Susan Collins remain but the
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:56.960]  other one Jay Rockefeller from West Virginia and you know I mean that last
[2:24:56.960 --> 2:25:02.560]  name should tell everybody who's behind this and what the motives are well we
[2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:05.720]  know his quote we would have been better off without ever inventing an internet
[2:25:05.720 --> 2:25:09.440]  you got Lieberman saying we don't want to censor the web we just need the power
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:15.360]  that China has to control it well and China and it does effectively control
[2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:19.960]  the internet they have their own search engine called by do they did they didn't
[2:25:19.960 --> 2:25:23.960]  like Google of course now Google apparently has settled its problems with
[2:25:23.960 --> 2:25:29.800]  China but the but many websites are blocked in China and is that what
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:35.000]  Lieberman's referring to he's he's he's putting China up as a some great
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:39.040]  example for this country to follow I mean I can't believe the people of
[2:25:39.040 --> 2:25:44.040]  Connecticut can constantly be putting this guy back in office but we have to
[2:25:44.040 --> 2:25:48.520]  remember Connecticut is the home of the Bush family it's the home of William F.
[2:25:48.520 --> 2:25:57.060]  Buckley and it's the home of a number of Wall Street gangsters so should we
[2:25:57.060 --> 2:26:01.120]  expect anything less from the state of Connecticut probably not Wayne I want to
[2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:04.520]  bring up two other points with you you probably didn't hear it but last Friday
[2:26:04.520 --> 2:26:11.140]  Rush Limbaugh came out and said there's a blue blood elite in New York and DC the
[2:26:11.140 --> 2:26:14.800]  banks are ripping us off they want to destroy the middle class and the
[2:26:14.800 --> 2:26:19.400]  Republicans are controlled by the same elite he's always acted as a gatekeeper
[2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:27.440]  to deny that we have a corrupt oligarchy running things he really went far on
[2:26:27.440 --> 2:26:31.680]  Friday is that because if he doesn't do that and change with the times because
[2:26:31.680 --> 2:26:36.480]  the public's already waking up he won't be relevant or is there a fight within
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:39.840]  the establishment what's your view on that well I think he's trying to be like
[2:26:39.840 --> 2:26:44.520]  you Alex he probably sees your ratings and and his ratings and he figures he's
[2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:49.720]  gotta repackage himself and rebrand himself but you know if he really
[2:26:49.720 --> 2:26:55.600]  believes this I say you know welcome to the real world rush Limbaugh but let's
[2:26:55.600 --> 2:27:00.880]  see if he maintains this stance it may change with time well I tend to agree
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:10.000]  with you lastly really chilling news here Haritz reporting the Jerusalem post
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:16.280]  Associated Press X CIA chief says strike on Iran seems more likely now and that
[2:27:16.280 --> 2:27:21.640]  even if they don't get a nuke they need to be attacked this from Hayden amazing
[2:27:21.640 --> 2:27:26.400]  statements it seems that the drums for war are really intensifying give us give
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:30.360]  us your view from being inside the beltway there what the chatter is is
[2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:34.360]  this getting ready to be green lighted well of course we have the Republicans
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:39.400]  in Congress trying to get a resolution passed to support an Israeli attack on
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:44.600]  Iran so absolutely there's a lot of a lot behind all this this noise I would
[2:27:44.600 --> 2:27:50.080]  point out that Michael Hayden is in business now with Michael chair top in
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:55.080]  the security consulting business and should we expect anything less from
[2:27:55.080 --> 2:28:01.920]  him but yeah I think I think the drums are beating very loudly for warring on
[2:28:01.920 --> 2:28:08.280]  Iran and if that happens I think we're looking at you know a potential
[2:28:08.280 --> 2:28:13.200]  catastrophe of course and the two minutes we've got left what type of
[2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:18.320]  catastrophe well look the first thing the Iranians will do they're gonna attack
[2:28:18.320 --> 2:28:22.080]  this out of the oil fields you're gonna close the straight of our moves we've
[2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:26.520]  already got Hugo Chavez and then as well saying if he's attacked from Colombia
[2:28:26.520 --> 2:28:31.040]  which is the host of seven new US military bases courtesy of Obama that he
[2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:34.760]  will cut off the oil to the United States I think we're talking about
[2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:44.320]  something akin to the oil blockade of the 1970s only probably 20 times worse and
[2:28:44.320 --> 2:28:49.120]  we now see them the military priming the propaganda saying that they think nuke
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:54.520]  components are being shipped from Venezuela via ship to Iran that's a
[2:28:54.520 --> 2:28:58.200]  perfect way to attack Venezuela and claim because they were helping with
[2:28:58.200 --> 2:29:03.000]  weapon systems well of course and here we go with the phony intelligence which
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:07.800]  I again I reiterate that the that is the neocon stock and trade
[2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:13.440]  host intelligence focus intelligence forged documents that we saw in a with
[2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:20.040]  the war in Iraq and we're seeing it play out again all over again what's the
[2:29:20.040 --> 2:29:29.840]  timeframe on an Iran strike well I said in 2004 there were plans to try to do it
[2:29:29.840 --> 2:29:34.600]  before the November election I think we're looking at electioneering
[2:29:34.600 --> 2:29:38.800]  politics and what better way to rally support for the White House than to
[2:29:38.800 --> 2:29:44.200]  have a war with Iran and say early October we'll keep watching it thanks

[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:41.160]  this story last Friday from curtain ammo and now in the aftermath of it I
[2:35:41.160 --> 2:35:47.960]  want to discuss it because I get no exaggeration hundreds of emails a day
[2:35:47.960 --> 2:35:54.400]  phone calls message board comments people on the street people that I know
[2:35:54.400 --> 2:36:00.200]  saying Alex why aren't you talking about the looming evacuations of the Gulf
[2:36:00.200 --> 2:36:05.440]  well I have talked about a council on foreign relations member a month ago who
[2:36:05.440 --> 2:36:08.920]  told the Washington Post that he believes it's going to happen it could be 20
[2:36:08.920 --> 2:36:12.440]  million people I have talked about other people in government that have
[2:36:12.440 --> 2:36:17.320]  discussed it but I don't know if that's the true or if that is indeed going to
[2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:21.400]  happen now the hurricane season is starting and it's going to run right
[2:36:21.400 --> 2:36:29.040]  through November right into the election and most of the oil is offshore the
[2:36:29.040 --> 2:36:33.880]  rig is 50 miles off and in most of its plume doubt in the currents even more
[2:36:33.880 --> 2:36:40.520]  south and some of it has gone through the keys towards the Atlantic and if the
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:45.160]  hurricanes come in on their tracks driving it in to Texas Louisiana
[2:36:45.160 --> 2:36:49.320]  Mississippi Florida hundreds of millions of gallons of oil hitting the
[2:36:49.320 --> 2:36:55.200]  beach will be a catastrophe but I don't know that's going to happen and I want
[2:36:55.200 --> 2:36:58.440]  to be careful here I don't want to feed into the government's hype you know I
[2:36:58.440 --> 2:37:01.560]  mean I become more sophisticated and doesn't mean I'm sophisticated I'm
[2:37:01.560 --> 2:37:08.280]  saying I become more sophisticated as time goes on we didn't know what was
[2:37:08.280 --> 2:37:14.520]  happening in January of last year a year and a half ago we just knew that the
[2:37:14.520 --> 2:37:18.560]  military and FEMA were preparing police departments for all-out martial law
[2:37:18.560 --> 2:37:21.720]  telling them there was going to be a flu pandemic it was going to kill millions
[2:37:21.720 --> 2:37:27.720]  and we got the state of California the state of New York Illinois we got the
[2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:32.520]  documents we got the eyewitness reports from emergency managers that they were
[2:37:32.520 --> 2:37:36.240]  being told this was going to happen then when out of season in the wrong
[2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:41.720]  hemisphere this novel flu pops up the H1N1 I went on air and I said this could
[2:37:41.720 --> 2:37:46.640]  be real or it could be hype or it could just be a drill for federalization I
[2:37:46.640 --> 2:37:53.480]  don't know and then we saw doctors being told the state level in Texas and other
[2:37:53.480 --> 2:38:00.360]  states that it was much worse the deaths were much worse this was in April and the
[2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:07.800]  following months April May and then into June and within a month and a half I
[2:38:07.800 --> 2:38:13.640]  knew it was a fraud and just a hoax but we saw doctors being told by the feds
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:16.920]  there will be mass death it's real so they would go out and then scare
[2:38:16.920 --> 2:38:20.600]  everybody and they weren't bad they were repeating what they've been told by the
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:27.040]  feds so yes if that oil comes in in a large percentage of it comes in and
[2:38:27.040 --> 2:38:31.040]  it starts backing up in the rivers and estuaries and it's off-gassing methane
[2:38:31.040 --> 2:38:36.040]  gas we could have a serious problem but we don't want the feds to over hype it
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:40.280]  or use the internet to over hype it as they did the flu to then get everybody
[2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:46.280]  totally afraid where they buy into a forced evacuation you know 50 miles a
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:50.720]  hundred miles 200 miles in that will cause a collapse of the economy in those
[2:38:50.720 --> 2:38:55.640]  states and nationwide to a certain extent and we'll be used as a political
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:39:04.720]  diversion going into the election so let's go ahead and go over this report
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:10.880]  by Kurt Nemo where he quotes Matthew Simons founder of the Ocean Energy
[2:39:10.880 --> 2:39:16.560]  Institute Ocean Energy Institute founder says new hurricane will require Gulf
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:21.560]  evacuation thank God that storm deteriorated and didn't turn into a
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:26.480]  hurricane is now broken up but the season is just getting started and they
[2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:30.520]  say it's going to be a doozy of a hurricane season the US National
[2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:34.920]  Hurricane Center has warned that a weather system near Cuba center between
[2:39:34.920 --> 2:39:42.680]  the islands of Akelin's and great in Agua if I'm pronouncing that right may
[2:39:42.680 --> 2:39:46.560]  move into the Gulf of Mexico this weekend reports Bloomberg but again it
[2:39:46.560 --> 2:39:51.760]  didn't but what happens with the next one reports Bloomberg I am still worried
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:55.240]  about how it will move the oil slick into the coastal areas of Louisiana
[2:39:55.240 --> 2:39:59.640]  Mississippi meteorologist Jim Rollier said we're gonna try to get him on as
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:04.760]  well and response to the approach of the tropical cyclone BP workers and the
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:09.200]  Gulf of Mexico have stopped drilling a relief well and preparing to evacuate
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:14.160]  but they were able to stop that on Sunday reports the BBC on Wednesday
[2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:19.760]  National Incident Commander Thad Allen said a tropical storm in the area would
[2:40:19.760 --> 2:40:24.960]  push back the timetable 10 to 14 days Matthew Simons founder of the Ocean
[2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:30.080]  Energy Institute told Bloomberg on Wednesday that a leak into the deep
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:33.280]  water horizon site may require an evacuation of the Gulf Coast in a
[2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:38.480]  hurricane strikes the area some five to ten miles away is what NOAA research
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:42.960]  vessels have provided as a deep oil leak that is growing by the day and is
[2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:47.760]  very toxic oil and its gases are very lethal and basically we have a hurricane
[2:40:47.760 --> 2:40:55.340]  now we need to evacuate the Gulf Coast Simons said that's a pun Simons
[2:40:55.340 --> 2:41:02.080]  Simons also said BP has covered up the severity of the oil gusher as it has
[2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:07.920]  told the truth they would go to jail and then we go over all of that and it goes
[2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:11.080]  on on June 24th Matthew Simons who's a member of the Council of Farm Relations
[2:41:11.080 --> 2:41:15.400]  and subscribes to the Club of Rums limits to growth propaganda as says
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:20.160]  he's also a oil proponent of peak oil so it just sounds like he's out there
[2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:26.240]  hyping it and I'm not saying we shouldn't be concerned I just my opinion is
[2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:30.680]  this could be used as a diversion and it is a distraction as another federal
[2:41:30.680 --> 2:41:34.880]  takeover drill just like the flu was which they now admit is a fraud British
[2:41:34.880 --> 2:41:42.480]  Medical Journal EU 47 member board Wolfgang Wudar do we had on but we're
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:45.360]  gonna work on getting both these individuals that are quoted in this
[2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:53.400]  article on the show as soon as we can okay let me continue now with other news
[2:41:53.400 --> 2:41:57.680]  I'm just gonna quickly go through headlines now this is from the Daily

[2:42:11.720 --> 2:42:16.320]  Trade Commission so they really are talking about this media matters is
[2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:21.880]  engaged in more hoaxes right wing and that means George Soros is right wing
[2:42:21.880 --> 2:42:28.040]  bloggers push rumor that Mexican gangs have invaded the US well in Texas and
[2:42:28.040 --> 2:42:32.200]  Arizona they've got federal signs up in Arizona 80 plus miles in saying don't go

[2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:15.720]  collapsing the United States remember a few weeks ago Harry Reid told the
[2:43:15.720 --> 2:43:19.800]  reporters that there's no illegal aliens working in construction in Nevada
[2:43:19.800 --> 2:43:25.480]  turns out they have the highest rate in the country 36 plus percent so just

[2:43:36.360 --> 2:43:39.600]  turns on bloggers we have the video clip at the bottom of the article I don't
[2:43:39.600 --> 2:43:46.920]  have time to play it but there is a whole bunch of mainstream news media
[2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:50.160]  there's a bunch of these videos posted in here where they say we've got to have
[2:43:50.160 --> 2:43:54.360]  a gatekeeper on the internet why we've seen this poor lady that worked for the
[2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:58.240]  federal government with the white farmer comment and the internet was able to do
[2:43:58.240 --> 2:44:01.560]  that and we need to be able to shut them down because it's dangerous what
[2:44:01.560 --> 2:44:05.960]  about the mainstream media line about WMD's what about the mainstream media
[2:44:05.960 --> 2:44:10.760]  trying to lie all the time again they can't survive up against the alternative
[2:44:10.760 --> 2:44:17.000]  media when I can have an operation that runs on one one-hundredth or less of
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:25.680]  what MSNBC does and have close to the same viewership and readership as some
[2:44:25.680 --> 2:44:30.120]  of their top shows they've got a major problem
[2:44:31.440 --> 2:44:36.400]  continuing I saw this report last week but now there's more out on it from
[2:44:36.400 --> 2:44:44.720]  Salon National Geographic and others shrimp on Prozac are killing
[2:44:44.720 --> 2:44:50.720]  themselves a study shows that drug traces in our water in our wastewater
[2:44:50.720 --> 2:44:58.720]  can affect marine life behavior but concrustaceans have feelings and in
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:05.880]  major prestigious reports government studies find that shrimp are just
[2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:10.280]  swimming right up to birds and being eaten they're overconfident they've
[2:45:10.280 --> 2:45:19.040]  had their governors removed they've had their compulsions removed they've had
[2:45:19.040 --> 2:45:22.800]  their fear level and this is what the studies when they approved prozac and
[2:45:22.800 --> 2:45:27.000]  81 had shown that's why it's now on the drug insert that oh yeah most of the
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:29.400]  time you're gonna be having a great time it's a hallucinogen it's in a
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:34.680]  psychotropic category but some days if you get angry or you don't take the right
[2:45:34.680 --> 2:45:37.920]  amount of the medication or you try to go off of it or you mix it with other
[2:45:37.920 --> 2:45:43.880]  things you will break and go in and kill 20 people at a school or you'll chop
[2:45:43.880 --> 2:45:48.600]  your baby's arms off or you'll put your kids all in their car seats chain them
[2:45:48.600 --> 2:45:53.320]  in and drive them off a cliff in every case in every case they've always been
[2:45:53.320 --> 2:45:59.400]  on it and I've talked to so many police they say they'll pull up it to a call
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:03.680]  and there'll be a beautiful naked woman in one case a cop tell me about cutting
[2:46:03.680 --> 2:46:07.880]  herself with butcher knives on the roof and then she'll just jump off the roof
[2:46:07.880 --> 2:46:13.360]  breaking her legs she's on prozac or a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and they
[2:46:13.360 --> 2:46:18.280]  found the same thing with shrimp shrimp will just come up and start attacking
[2:46:18.280 --> 2:46:23.440]  crabs when the crabs are just gonna eat them or they will they will just come up
[2:46:23.440 --> 2:46:31.720]  to the service and not be afraid their inhibitions have been taken away and it
[2:46:31.720 --> 2:46:35.600]  goes on study shows that drug traces in our waste here's the national
[2:46:35.600 --> 2:46:41.400]  geographic prozac pollution making shrimp reckless anti-depressants key
[2:46:41.400 --> 2:46:46.000]  ingredient is flushed into coastal water studies says well yeah think about it
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:53.760]  Houston six million people Metro you got upwards of 15% on prozac most of its
[2:46:53.760 --> 2:46:59.800]  past to the body you got all those other towns all the major water supplies
[2:46:59.800 --> 2:47:03.160]  end up from the entire company dumping out in the Gulf of Mexico or on the
[2:47:03.160 --> 2:47:08.120]  Atlantic or Pacific Ocean out of these rivers and estuaries and you've got the
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:12.280]  shrimp and that's what the studies have found there they're just full of it but
[2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:15.720]  then there's all the drugs and chemicals and fluoride and pesticides that are
[2:47:15.720 --> 2:47:22.640]  also running into the water and the shrimp there's also reports about the
[2:47:22.640 --> 2:47:29.000]  feminization of fish and frogs large percentages of them are bisexual or they
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:35.360]  have both sexual organs and remember we're drinking this water too we're not
[2:47:35.360 --> 2:47:39.080]  just taking these drugs we're drinking it as well so if it's doing this to
[2:47:39.080 --> 2:47:43.840]  shrimp and the frogs and the fish and to alligators that are turning into
[2:47:43.840 --> 2:47:47.960]  hemaphridites what is it doing to you well we see all of these same
[2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:53.960]  symptoms in humans but this is done by design and AP did a study two years ago
[2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:58.200]  finding they found levels of serotonin reuptake inhibitors prozac is you know
[2:47:58.200 --> 2:48:02.000]  the main brand name of one of the variants at levels many times higher
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:06.360]  than should be there from simple runoff from sewage they're adding it to the
[2:48:06.360 --> 2:48:10.400]  water and then I have Fox news clips promoting prozac in the water and
[2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:16.880]  statins and lithium so here's the news flash they're already doing it okay
[2:48:16.880 --> 2:48:22.880]  there's no happy ending for shrimp exposed to mood booster prozac remnants
[2:48:22.880 --> 2:48:27.240]  of antidepressant drugs flush into waterways worldwide are altering shrimp
[2:48:27.240 --> 2:48:31.120]  behavior and making them easier prey experts say to mimic conditions in the
[2:48:31.120 --> 2:48:36.080]  wild scientists exposed the estuary dwelling shrimp to the antidepressant
[2:48:36.080 --> 2:48:42.920]  florextine or florextine at levels it's just a fluoride that's what prozac is
[2:48:42.920 --> 2:48:46.160]  is a fluoride molecule derivative scientists have said on the show at
[2:48:46.160 --> 2:48:51.360]  levels detected in average sewage treatment waste and it goes on to say
[2:48:51.360 --> 2:48:57.840]  florextine is the key ingredient in the drugs prozac and serifum shrimp
[2:48:57.840 --> 2:49:01.720]  normally gravitate towards safe dark corners when exposed to the chemical
[2:49:01.720 --> 2:49:05.320]  the shrimp were five times were likely to swim towards a bright region of water
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:10.040]  the team discovered the behavior makes them much more likely to be eaten by a
[2:49:10.040 --> 2:49:15.480]  predator such as a fish or a bird see and this is what the public's like they're
[2:49:15.480 --> 2:49:24.240]  like zombies on fluoride which is a similar molecule to this and the prozac
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:29.120]  people are on and that's why when they started death education federally in
[2:49:29.120 --> 2:49:34.840]  public schools in 1991 even 2020 to report on this in to in 1994 I covered
[2:49:34.840 --> 2:49:39.760]  that screenshots of it in the police state to the takeover they go in and
[2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:44.120]  they say we're gonna teach you eighth graders how to not commit suicide for a
[2:49:44.120 --> 2:49:48.560]  week-long class and they show them videos of a girl strangling herself with
[2:49:48.560 --> 2:49:52.160]  her shoelaces and then the little girl takes her shoelaces off she's depressed
[2:49:52.160 --> 2:49:56.800]  she's got zits her boyfriend broke up with her she's 12 years old she walks
[2:49:56.800 --> 2:50:02.800]  into the bathroom on the coat rack they're even removing the coat hangers
[2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:06.880]  in the bathrooms around the country you can search that term that search schools
[2:50:06.880 --> 2:50:13.600]  removing coat hangers from bathrooms because of suicide and they just saw it
[2:50:13.600 --> 2:50:17.680]  they were taught how to do it and they just hang themselves and they're
[2:50:17.680 --> 2:50:22.720]  always on serotonry uptake inhibitors they're highly suggestible you're like
[2:50:22.720 --> 2:50:25.840]  why doesn't the public care why aren't they involved why don't they wake up
[2:50:25.840 --> 2:50:30.160]  why don't they get angry about the banks looting us you're on fluoride it
[2:50:30.160 --> 2:50:35.640]  makes you docile it's the main ingredient in prozac it makes the shrimp and the
[2:50:35.640 --> 2:50:41.560]  frogs and the fish do the same thing you're being chemically hit it's a
[2:50:41.560 --> 2:50:45.680]  hundred percent whether it's on purpose or not and we know it's on purpose but
[2:50:45.680 --> 2:50:50.080]  whether it's on purpose or not we know it's doing this now do you care about
[2:50:50.080 --> 2:50:54.320]  your family enough to wake up to it well you can't you're on fluoride the
[2:50:54.320 --> 2:50:59.960]  ingredient of prozac so you can't you can't you've been chemically lobotomized
[2:50:59.960 --> 2:51:05.200]  the right back hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters

[2:52:17.200 --> 2:52:21.200]  addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their
[2:52:21.200 --> 2:52:25.960]  control the United Nations would take over America the trilateral Commission
[2:52:25.960 --> 2:52:30.520]  would control the world invisible Empire Chronicles how men of power and
[2:52:30.520 --> 2:52:34.480]  influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[2:52:34.480 --> 2:52:38.440]  world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a
[2:52:38.440 --> 2:52:42.160]  world constitution for the global financial system global governance with
[2:52:42.160 --> 2:52:46.440]  the establishment of the G20 so it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then

[2:54:05.080 --> 2:54:10.600]  one more point on the shrimp they go on to report that it's concentrating not
[2:54:10.600 --> 2:54:15.000]  just in shrimp and other animals and then we are eating the shrimp and other
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:19.360]  fish we're at the top of the food chain so we take the Prozac it goes into the
[2:54:19.360 --> 2:54:23.920]  water goes into other water supplies humans drink it they're adding fluoride
[2:54:23.920 --> 2:54:27.680]  that has a similar effect it's the base chemical that they're making it out of
[2:54:27.680 --> 2:54:32.320]  then that goes out to the to see the shrimp then eat it we then eat the
[2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:37.120]  shrimp the fish eat the shrimp we eat the fish and we are at the top of the
[2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:44.240]  food chain so we are just a toxic brew so there's that Prozac story in other
[2:54:44.240 --> 2:54:54.720]  news I got to move quick now HR 5741 national compulsory bill we call it
[2:54:54.720 --> 2:55:01.120]  the slave bill that's up at GCN live.com Rob do just wrote this article GCN
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:08.280]  live.com also on info wars.com HR 5741 bill now in committee and it's a
[2:55:08.280 --> 2:55:12.720]  national mandatory service act not just for the military but to serve in other
[2:55:12.720 --> 2:55:16.400]  groups we also have the article about Rush Limbaugh it seems starting to wake
[2:55:16.400 --> 2:55:22.320]  up clash of the classes does Rush Limbaugh finally get it that's also up at
[2:55:22.320 --> 2:55:28.920]  GCN live.com and I'm trying to find my final news that I wanted to hit which
[2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:35.920]  was so exciting ah here it is this is in the New York Times but they're
[2:55:35.920 --> 2:55:41.040]  horrified in this report they say cities and counties that own all this land
[2:55:41.040 --> 2:55:47.880]  they're going back to the Homestead Act of 1862 and selling state and county
[2:55:47.880 --> 2:55:55.960]  land and city land to citizens at low prices God forbid to raise money there
[2:55:55.960 --> 2:56:01.680]  are many states that upwards of 90% like Nevada and Utah are federal and then the
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:06.560]  rest of the land most of it is state and the feds have now created legislation to
[2:56:06.560 --> 2:56:12.440]  buy even more land up instead of empowering our economy and having
[2:56:12.440 --> 2:56:16.400]  people become landowners but it says cities view homesteads as source of
[2:56:16.400 --> 2:56:22.960]  income it hardly sounds like a prudence scheme but it's a bit of deja vu that is
[2:56:22.960 --> 2:56:28.720]  exactly what this small Nebraska city aims to do oh and they it's terrible you
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:32.000]  know the city's hogging all this land that they got when they were
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:37.760]  incorporated through the Homestead Act that was meant to be for for people to
[2:56:37.760 --> 2:56:41.640]  stake a claim to you're supposed to all that federal and state land you're
[2:56:41.640 --> 2:56:46.360]  supposed to get it it's supposed to be yours you're supposed to be able to get
[2:56:46.360 --> 2:56:53.080]  40 acres of that no no no no and then you can improve it and sell it so imagine
[2:56:53.080 --> 2:56:56.680]  the New York Times these globalists that represent the trillionaires the people
[2:56:56.680 --> 2:57:00.920]  that run the planet they don't want you having a piece of state or federal
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:04.360]  property and paying for the stinking thing you're not even supposed to pay
[2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:11.200]  for it supposed to pay a little filing fee for the claim office oh it makes me
[2:57:11.200 --> 2:57:15.320]  mad these people are so sick they want you bankrupt here's another one there's
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:20.400]  some more good news this is how to AP LA suburb residents march over high city
[2:57:20.400 --> 2:57:26.480]  salaries thousands of city employees some of which being paid $787,000 plus
[2:57:26.480 --> 2:57:30.920]  bonuses and the citizens point out they've raised taxes the roads aren't
[2:57:30.920 --> 2:57:37.840]  being fixed 40,000 of them live in poverty in the town in the suburb and
[2:57:37.840 --> 2:57:44.000]  they are angry and they want the mayor Oscar Hernandez and others to stop
[2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:48.800]  being paid so much money absolutely government paychecks are going up for
[2:57:48.800 --> 2:57:53.200]  the bureaucrats going down for the people so people are starting to really
[2:57:53.200 --> 2:57:56.320]  figure out who their enemies are here's another report I see these every day
[2:57:56.320 --> 2:58:02.120]  city terminates all but two in police force well you know what it says the
[2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:08.200]  small Texas town of Kauffman County the Combine City Council laid off their
[2:58:08.200 --> 2:58:11.680]  only deputies well there's already County police County sheriffs you know we
[2:58:11.680 --> 2:58:15.920]  don't need cops to just write us tickets and then let the illegal aliens go so
[2:58:15.920 --> 2:58:19.080]  another issue is we don't need all these cops but you notice where do you always
[2:58:19.080 --> 2:58:22.440]  see the cops where the money's at because they're there sucking off
[2:58:22.440 --> 2:58:26.040]  everybody for the government they're tax collectors that doesn't mean we don't
[2:58:26.040 --> 2:58:30.680]  need some police but more and more they're just tax collectors so that was
[2:58:30.680 --> 2:58:34.120]  interesting and quite informative jeb bush is setting his sights on the
[2:58:34.120 --> 2:58:39.600]  White House give me a break great job crews stay with us info wars dot com
[2:58:39.600 --> 2:58:42.240]  we'll be right back
[2:58:42.240 --> 2:58:53.640]  thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN live comm today hi folks
[2:58:53.640 --> 2:58:57.280]  this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now
[2:58:57.280 --> 2:59:01.480]  you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution
[2:59:01.480 --> 2:59:04.920]  directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
