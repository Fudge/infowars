[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in occupied North America.
[00:14.000 --> 00:17.000]  There is a war. It's happening now.
[00:17.000 --> 00:22.000]  It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come.
[00:22.000 --> 00:32.000]  We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  We're here, ladies and gentlemen. It's hard to believe so much has happened in the last year.
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  Happy New Year. It's now January 1st, 2018.
[00:42.000 --> 00:53.000]  And if you thought 2016 and 2017 were momentous, building towards the cultural, spiritual, technological singularity.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  Well, you ain't seen nothing yet, as they say.
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  I am extremely thankful to God, my family, the crew here at Info Wars.
[01:01.000 --> 01:11.000]  All of you that are out there watching and listening to make this transmission possible, I am very, very humbled to be your host.
[01:11.000 --> 01:22.000]  Well, today, on New Year's, I thought we should go back and look at one of the biggest, if not one of the most important events in 2017.
[01:22.000 --> 01:30.000]  And that was the inauguration, not just the election of Donald John Trump as the 45th President.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  It was a referendum on the globalist.
[01:32.000 --> 01:40.000]  It was an overthrow and an overturning of their propaganda, of their lies, of their attempts to steal elections,
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  their operations having millions of people vote with the names of dead people from the voter registration rolls.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  It was a repudiation of everything they threw against us.
[01:50.000 --> 02:03.000]  And it is part of a larger global trend of nationalism and populism that even the Financial Times of London and many others admit is basically unstoppable.
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  Here's an article from just last week of the Sunday Express.
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  Populous uprising, anti-EU parties will continue to soar.
[02:11.000 --> 02:21.000]  Tony Blair's think tank admits as if we need Mr. E.U., Mr. Globalist, Mr. Arab Spring to tell us something we don't already know.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  The point is they're losing.
[02:23.000 --> 02:35.000]  We're winning as the establishment has less and less credibility as people more and more trust their own instincts, their own research and get back to common sense populism
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  and common sense free market.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  That is the vanguard of human thinking.
[02:39.000 --> 02:46.000]  That is the new system in the last 400 years known as the Renaissance that built this high tech world we live in.
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  The good, the bad and the ugly.
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.000]  But definitely it is the main engine of innovation.
[02:51.000 --> 03:06.000]  So, coming up, we have got a breakdown of President Trump and the inauguration from that day when I was live in D.C. and so much more.
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  And then I got back to town that Sunday morning after the inauguration that was on Friday.
[03:11.000 --> 03:20.000]  And I did a breakdown in studio with clips from Trump's historic speech that was extremely important and powerful, obviously.
[03:20.000 --> 03:36.000]  And then we could see, not even a year later, but I guess exactly 11 months and a few days later, 11 months in change, 11 months and a day later,
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  look how the world has already changed so much.
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  It has technically been 11 months and 10 days or so.
[03:43.000 --> 03:51.000]  So, this is an incredible, incredible, incredible time to be alive.
[03:51.000 --> 04:03.000]  And it is just such a blessing that humanity is beginning to start the process of waking up and digging out of the cultural and spiritual cancer
[04:03.000 --> 04:14.000]  that is the new order system that seeks to end competition, end families, end independence in a final revolution against humanity as they've openly called it.
[04:14.000 --> 04:27.000]  So again, from my family to your family and to everyone else out there across the world who breathes the same air on this planet and has the same visions and dreams for their children,
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.000]  or what color we are and where we came from, we have to come together and understand that everything the globalists are pushing,
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.000]  though it's all packaged with a bunch of sugar coating, is absolute total and complete poison.
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000]  So please be part of the second global revolution against tyranny, not just the second American Revolution,
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  and spread the live links to this feed or the local radio station that you're listening to or TV station you're watching,
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  because again, you are the reason we're overriding their censorship and control.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  You're the reason we're breaking their back. You're the reason we defeated Hillary, because you are the resistance.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and Biotru Selenium.
[05:06.000 --> 05:11.000]  This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.
[05:11.000 --> 05:18.000]  Biotru Selenium's formula is far from synthetic and is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[05:18.000 --> 05:27.000]  Our super high quality nascent iodine is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[05:27.000 --> 05:35.000]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[05:35.000 --> 05:42.000]  With inadequate thyroid hormones, you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[05:42.000 --> 05:48.000]  Survival Shield X2 and Biotru Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  Take control of your chemistry today with this super combo.
[05:52.000 --> 06:00.000]  Discover the power of Survival Shield X2 and Biotru Selenium at infowarslife.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:08.000]  So as true classical liberals in the vein of Thomas Jefferson, I want to salute all of you of every race, color and creed,
[06:08.000 --> 06:12.000]  color one race, red blood, who understand the globalists are in trouble.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  You broke the back of Hillary Clinton and the crime syndicate.
[06:16.000 --> 06:21.000]  You went up against the mainstream fake news media and broke their will.
[06:21.000 --> 06:28.000]  You stood like a lighthouse out on a promontory in a raging storm and beamed out the truth.
[06:28.000 --> 06:33.000]  You are the victors. You are the resistance.
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.000]  You are the power. You are the windows through which God's light shines into our world.
[06:38.000 --> 06:44.000]  You are destiny. And this isn't some Oprah Winfrey name it and claim it secret stuff.
[06:44.000 --> 06:55.000]  This is real, the history, the culture, the will, the understanding, the Christian ethos, the English common law ethos,
[06:55.000 --> 07:06.000]  the classic Judaic ethos of the Old Testament, not of the modern forms of Judaism,
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  but the ancient forms about not being corrupt, not being part of the manipulative systems.
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.000]  That all is coming back into the world right now.
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  And the knowledge is coming back into the world.
[07:19.000 --> 07:24.000]  And the knowledge of Solomon is coming back into the world.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  And with it is great danger. The globalists are afraid of information.
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  They're afraid of freedom because it does incredible things,
[07:30.000 --> 07:36.000]  but they're the ones suppressing information and suppressing humanity and creating something with abominations.
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  And so a great unchaining of humanity is in the process right now.
[07:41.000 --> 07:51.000]  No one can deny it. The globalists in their own elite publications that they think we don't read admit that globalism, if Hillary fell, was basically done.
[07:51.000 --> 07:57.000]  And now they're in complete panic mode saying, get rid of Trump. We've hijacked the U.S. before.
[07:57.000 --> 08:04.000]  They've taken control of our main command base. If we can't get rid of him, it's over for us.
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  And so they're in complete panic mode and they admit we have broken their will.
[08:08.000 --> 08:14.000]  We have broken their back thanks to God Almighty, the Creator.
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  This is a historic time to be alive right now.
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  And that's why Hollywood's dying. It's why the NFL's dying.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  Again, we're not just saying they're dying. They're dying.
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  It's why the modern cults are falling apart.
[08:27.000 --> 08:37.000]  It's why people are pulling away from fraud everywhere and getting back to basic common sense and back to God and back to humbleness
[08:37.000 --> 08:46.000]  and realizing that Hollywood and mainstream media and none of these systems are going to deliver anything but bondage and enslavement and fraud.
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  Look at the collapse of their system. Look at the scandals. Look at their ratings plunge.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  Look at Hollywood doing the worst it's done in its history.
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.000]  Yes, there's large numbers of victims, a large remnant of victims that they still prey upon and control and program.
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  But those people are followers. Those people are slaves.
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  Those people are seen as cattle by the globalist.
[09:10.000 --> 09:19.000]  They are victims. Don't ever let their bullying or their attempted group thing to intimidate you ever make you cave in
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  because you're caving into the master signal of programming.
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  And that's what I want you to know.
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.000]  Despite the rigging of Google, Facebook, Twitter, despite them throwing everything they could, Trump was elected.
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  Is he perfect? No, none of us are. But he means well.
[09:34.000 --> 09:42.000]  He's not out to get America and he's doing classical things that will create a boom in the economy and rising wages and rising savings.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  And they are cutting some areas of government.
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  They need to cut more so that we can pay down the deficit, not just expand it.
[09:49.000 --> 09:57.000]  But compared to the globalists that were going to expand the deficits, bankrupt things, pick the winners and losers, bring an austerity like it's a cool thing
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  and make us permanently poor in their own admissions to control us.
[10:01.000 --> 10:08.000]  That's called feudalism. That's called servitude. That's called serfdom where that term comes from.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  And again, it's the admitted plan of the globalist.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  Their arrogance has and will continue to be their downfall.
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.000]  They can't help it. They have a disdain for everyone around them.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  They don't want to teach people. They want to hurt people.
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  They're like spiders. They do not create.
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  And they're being broken right now.
[10:29.000 --> 10:38.000]  Their main push to totally take over the world and totally have had hegemonic world government and totally destroy the family and totally break down society
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  finally brought humanity out of a coma into an awakening.
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  And we're laying on our bed in a coma for years.
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  We have trouble moving, but our focus is coming back.
[10:50.000 --> 10:51.000]  Our memory is coming back.
[10:51.000 --> 10:58.000]  We're now getting up from the bed as they attempted to get us to lay back down and take their poison culture back.
[10:58.000 --> 11:06.000]  We're now pushing away towards the doors, out towards the front porch, out towards the sun, and the beautiful vista God has prepared for us.
[11:06.000 --> 11:16.000]  Out there, out leaving this filthy, fetid coffin, this matrix box, this artificial construct that they had been putting us into.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  We're coming out of it in 2017.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  2016 was a great time of awakening.
[11:22.000 --> 11:36.000]  2017 was a great time of explosive change and honor and delivery and truth and expansion of that and of globalist counter-strike.
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  It was a great year of battle as the storms come together.
[11:41.000 --> 11:48.000]  But 2018 is going to be the deciding year as the globalists have always threatened, you don't give us world government.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  We're going to bring you into World War III. That's why they gave the Soviets the weapons.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  They gave the Chinese the weapons.
[11:54.000 --> 11:55.000]  They couldn't develop those.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  They didn't have the technology, the communists.
[11:57.000 --> 12:06.000]  And they built up that threat to then create a global threat so a global government was needed to fight that threat.
[12:06.000 --> 12:14.000]  And so every time a nation tries to come out of that and the strangling anti-family, anti-Christian globalism, they try to invoke it again.
[12:14.000 --> 12:26.000]  So Trump, instead of running away from the threat of war, is running headlong to face it in an attempt to show real strength and conviction to break the will of the communist Chinese that run North Korea
[12:26.000 --> 12:37.000]  and the globalists that have been manipulating it as a detonator for war and a way to get the U.S. in line to allow Chinese expansion globally for the last few decades.
[12:37.000 --> 12:44.000]  America was about getting away from royalty and away from like North Korea's royalty and being about the individual.
[12:44.000 --> 12:56.000]  So you see the tabloids and the media worshiping and like, oh, Trump might get rejected by Hollywood and he might get rejected by some sniveling prince that sits there and has some effete, effeminate,
[12:56.000 --> 13:10.000]  foppish interview with Obama and then, oh, the world rejects Trump and the royalty rejects him and then the scared British prime minister, you know, in her kept nation run by Islamicists,
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  oh, Khan, the Islamic mayor of London, we don't want you.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  This is ridiculous.
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  Trump is a rock star with the people in the U.K. now and a leader for fighting globalism.
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  Info wars is incredibly popular. We're winning because royalty hates us, because Hollywood hates us.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  This is all a good thing.
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  I've had invitations from the highest levels of globalism, highest levels of rock and roll, all of it.
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  And I just don't even accept them anymore because I'm just not part of it.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  Even if they're halfway decent people, the whole system they represent is a giant rotting carcass.
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  And I don't want to be part of an old rotting, diseased, fetid, demonic carcass.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  I trailblaze. I'm into the future. I want us to go to space. I want life extension technology.
[13:53.000 --> 14:02.000]  I believe in the people. I want to build a world for and by humans, not technocracy, not the age of humans as dead, not all this crap we get told.
[14:02.000 --> 14:13.000]  We just accept that we're supposed to watch NFL sports become giant fat people, roll over, and then the tech giants who worship the AI gods that I first told you about 10 years ago in in-game,
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  then take over and overwrite the world and build this perfect new thing.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  Well, they don't even know where they came from or who they are.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  And that's in the news as well.
[14:23.000 --> 14:30.000]  Remember in-game, told you about the tech gods, how they worship the AI computer, because that's in their internal writings that are public.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  Now, Elon Musk comes out and says, beware those that tell you about tech gods.
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  They're exterminists that want to take over the planet and think humans are obsolete.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  They're programming the AI right now to get rid of us and make us obsolete.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  That's because that's what they've been planning.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  How many years have I told you?
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  I've known about that 18 years.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  It's just the evergreen film is in-game.
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.000]  It's free online.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  Get it. Copy it. Show it to people. Get it out there.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  Buy the DVD at forestore.com.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  The point is, that's the reality.
[15:05.000 --> 15:12.000]  And here's some of these articles. 2017, the year AI took over. That's RT.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  They're already putting AI in to run everything.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  It's not self-aware, but it's artificially intelligent.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  It knows what you're going to order from Amazon before you order it.
[15:21.000 --> 15:29.000]  My God, might as well commit suicide if you're going to just keep giving everything to Amazon, everything to Google, and just letting them run your life.
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  When their owners have already said you're obsolete and you're showing you're obsolete.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  Rasmussen, Trump approval hits one month high. He's at 45.
[15:38.000 --> 15:45.000]  And Rasmussen, again, adding 9 to 12 usually, you can go look up their particular nomenclature here and their methodology.
[15:45.000 --> 15:51.000]  So what's that got Trump at? 65? 55?
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  I mean, God only knows.
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  Are tax debts crippling you? I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[16:21.000 --> 16:28.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX. That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.000]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.000]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000]  See guidelines, discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.000]  Go to libertyoncall.org. That's libertyoncall.org.
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[17:01.000 --> 17:06.000]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  But the symptoms are there.
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.000]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[18:09.000 --> 18:14.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico
[18:14.000 --> 18:18.000]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  that so many other coffees give me personally.

[19:06.000 --> 19:14.000]  probiotic flora life that is so critical to having a healthy gut and a healthy life

[19:17.000 --> 19:23.000]  The other part is a compound like Mycos EX that has all these key ingredients of organic herbs
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.

[20:03.000 --> 20:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:11.000 --> 20:18.000]  It's the year their BS stopped working on a majority of people and it's getting worse for them by the minute.
[20:18.000 --> 20:24.000]  All the evidence shows, all the graph show, all the feedback shows, all the bellwethers,
[20:24.000 --> 20:28.000]  all the weather veins, all the statistics, all the real raw data shows,
[20:28.000 --> 20:32.000]  a global explosive awakening against everything mainstream.
[20:32.000 --> 20:38.000]  Hollywood, not just here but the Hollywoods they've got in France and the Hollywoods they've got in Italy
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  and the Hollywoods they've got in Japan.
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  All the establishment media, people are running away from it.
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  They're sick of it. They can't stand it.
[20:47.000 --> 20:54.000]  The establishment gurus, the establishment systems, the establishment new age stuff, all of it.
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  People are running away from it and rejecting it.
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  GMO, they're rejecting. Vaccines, they're rejecting because we know they're tainted and being spiked.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  Globalism, mainline sports, all of it.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  And their answer is we'll march EU armies in if you try to leave Europe, the EU.
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  We'll get rid of your national sports teams.
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  That'll make you love the EU. There's only our sports team.
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  All of this is a desperate attempt and it's not working.
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.000]  And their final big desperate attempt was to say anyone that likes Trump is Hitler.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  Anyone that's a nationalist is Hitler.
[21:26.000 --> 21:31.000]  We're going to call you horrible names and destroy you and fire you or kill you or shoot you
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  like Congressman Scalise if you don't give in to us and it didn't work.
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.000]  People turned the corner to the bullies.
[21:37.000 --> 21:44.000]  They took the fact that we were calm and the fact that we were asleep for weakness.
[21:44.000 --> 21:52.000]  Instead, now the sleeping giant has awoken like when Admiral Yamamoto telegraphed back December 7, 1941,
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  the day they live in infamy. He telegraphed back the next day.
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  He said, fear, we've awakened a sleeping giant.
[21:59.000 --> 22:06.000]  So just think about that, how we've been domesticated, what we've been turned into and now we're turning the corner.
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  So all they've got is racism now.
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.000]  Divide and conquer, how the British would go into India or other places and be outnumbered a thousand to one or more and take over.
[22:13.000 --> 22:22.000]  I mean, a couple thousand British troops and their sociologists that they would send in years before as traders and stuff to get businesses,
[22:22.000 --> 22:28.000]  they would come in and play tribes off against each other and in a matter of years they took over China, they took over India,
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  divide and conquer and this is how they did it, tribe against tribe.
[22:32.000 --> 22:39.000]  You know the Indians look the same, act the same, even the same culture, they played them off against each other and that's their plan.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  Hindu against Muslim, you name it.
[22:41.000 --> 22:48.000]  Racist, buzzfeed, list things, white people need to stop running in 2018 and this is the whole thing from universities everywhere.
[22:48.000 --> 22:51.000]  Whites are inherently bad. Whites are inherently evil.
[22:51.000 --> 22:55.000]  Whites are inherently not good genetically.
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  What is Sink Uggur?
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  Or Chink, what do you say his name, Jinger Gugur?
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  Clink Blunger.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  I'm really not making fun of his name, I can't ever.
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  Chink Unger.
[23:04.000 --> 23:14.000]  You know in his writing he's like these women are genetically trash and garbage and well he's a Muslim from Turkey folks.
[23:14.000 --> 23:24.000]  I mean of course he has an, I mean it's just like Linda Sir Sir's mother writes books about chopping all women's genitals off and then she leads the women's marches.
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.000]  I mean it's all about force feeding you something ridiculous and that's it right here.
[23:30.000 --> 23:38.000]  Buzzfeed has published a list of 37 things, white people need to stop running in 2018, yet another example of lefts brazen anti-white racism.
[23:38.000 --> 23:44.000]  And then it just goes over the list of things that is just absolutely incredible.
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  So this is all they've got.
[23:48.000 --> 23:59.000]  I mean can you imagine what you could say about 30 things that blacks do that's bad and then stereotype and say horrible things.
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  I mean it would be terrible.
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  It would be a horrible thing.
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  This is beyond that and it just shows who they are.
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.000]  They're desperate.
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.000]  They've always used race to control manipulator body and they're the enemy of prosperity and everything else that's happening right now.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  It's miraculous what's happening.
[24:16.000 --> 24:17.000]  We should all give thanks.
[24:17.000 --> 24:18.000]  I give thanks to God.
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  I give thanks to you.
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.000]  And I just want you to know we've blown Hillary Clinton's operation sky high.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  You've really devastated the globalist.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  You've done an incredible job.
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  I love you.
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  I appreciate you.
[24:28.000 --> 24:34.000]  And I'm going to really codify through the next few weeks every day just examples of the successes and the good things that have happened.
[24:34.000 --> 24:41.000]  And just how much amazing things have gone on and how we stood up to the bullying and how we have rallies and half the folks there aren't white.
[24:41.000 --> 24:51.000]  That is so good because they always told minorities you can't be part of the Tea Party or libertarianism when it's been socialism and colonialism and collectivism that have absolutely enslaved everybody.
[24:51.000 --> 24:56.000]  And here we are at this great new renaissance that's happening.
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  And humanity's found its fight again.
[24:58.000 --> 25:05.000]  And it's because of you and the great crew here and all of us little people standing up to Hollywood and mainstream media and the globalist.
[25:05.000 --> 25:12.000]  And they've just thrown everything they've got at us, even though it's destroying the NFL and destroying the NBA and destroying Hollywood.
[25:12.000 --> 25:18.000]  They just can't stop because it's all about the spiritual control they want because they're from the chicken shit dimension.
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  Basically is what I call it.
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.000]  That's my term.
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  The chicken shit dimension.
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.000]  I invented that.
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  They just have it out for green fields and happy families and fly over country and people coming together.
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  That's the will of evil is to take things over and then destroy it.
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  And they wonder why they're so desperate, why they're so unhappy, why things are so terrible.
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  If they could just pull down somebody that they think is better than them, then they would be somebody.
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  And they're really projecting that they're trying to pull themselves down.
[25:46.000 --> 26:02.000]  Because if they weren't ugly before, they have become spiritually and physically ugly because they have gone into an economy of envy and an economy of class warfare.
[26:02.000 --> 26:08.000]  That even conservatives and libertarians claim we're not trying to be part of, but that permeates everything.
[26:08.000 --> 26:16.000]  And then sometimes you have to fight that culture war with its own symbols, even though you realize that you're even playing into it at a certain level.
[26:16.000 --> 26:27.000]  But there's an equation where it does more good than bad because you can't even communicate to people at a zombie level unless you enter into that paradigm of the false left-right system.
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  But the truth is we're all children once.
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.000]  We all have hopes and dreams.
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  We all have amazing ancestors from one point or another.
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  We wouldn't be here.
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  And we're going through a lot right now through this process like we're space traveling to Mars.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  And when you get to Mars after a year of voyage, a lot of people would be able to walk or even hardly get up.
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  Like I said, getting out of the coma.
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  And it's like that.
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  We're in this artificial world now going through all these changes, good and bad.
[26:52.000 --> 27:04.000]  And it's a great quickening and a great time of testing and a great time for us to realize that the great destiny and continuum of humanity is the great arc of history and the great arc of the future.
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  And the great arc that ties us to the past, present and through our dreams and genetic time flow to the future.
[27:10.000 --> 27:19.000]  And so there is an eternal life guaranteed within the spectrum of life and knowledge and information we transfer forward.
[27:19.000 --> 27:33.000]  But that everything being multi-dimensional in God's master plan, there are other dimensions to that spiritually that also live on but resonate towards the energy and towards the force that it is likened to.
[27:33.000 --> 27:41.000]  So the hell is those that are evil and corrupt, vampires not having anyone spiritually to feed on together forever.
[27:41.000 --> 28:01.000]  And good is ever higher levels of joining with God as God opens up more and more of the universe to those that are able to grasp the face of God than the mind of God, the soul of God and the continuum of God as we join closer and greater with God.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  And these are the secrets they don't want you to know.
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  And it's transcended.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  So I love you and I appreciate you and I thank you.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  Celebrate your victories.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  Celebrate what you've done.
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.000]  Celebrate the commitment you've made and where we're going together.
[28:15.000 --> 28:21.000]  Because I want to salute all of you as I've always done and thank you for what you've done.
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.000]  Because these globalist bullies think they can dominate and control humanity.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  But as I've said a thousand times, I don't know how all this is going to end.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  But if they want to fight, they better believe they got one.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  Because it's the fight that matters.
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  It's the fight and the resistance is the destination.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  The journey is the destination.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  The journey is the destination.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  You are fulfilled.
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  You are strong.
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.000]  You are beautiful.
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.000]  You are good.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  Hollywood tells you you're not.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  The whole system tells you you're crap because you don't have these markings or these systems.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  It's a load of ****.
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.000]  It's a no-brainer.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.

[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  That's true.
[29:30.000 --> 29:35.000]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?

[32:42.000 --> 32:50.000]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on.
[32:50.000 --> 32:55.000]  And if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[33:20.000 --> 33:27.000]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[33:27.000 --> 33:32.000]  That I will faithfully execute.
[33:32.000 --> 33:38.000]  The office of President of the United States.
[33:38.000 --> 33:43.000]  And will to the best of my ability.
[33:43.000 --> 33:48.000]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  The Constitution of the United States.
[33:53.000 --> 33:54.000]  So help me God.
[33:54.000 --> 33:55.000]  So help me God.
[33:55.000 --> 34:24.000]  Congratulations.
[34:25.000 --> 34:47.000]  Thank you.
[34:47.000 --> 35:13.000]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere the 45th President of the United States of America,
[35:13.000 --> 35:40.000]  Donald J. Trump.
[35:40.000 --> 35:52.000]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans,
[35:52.000 --> 36:01.000]  and people of the world, thank you.
[36:01.000 --> 36:17.000]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[36:17.000 --> 36:26.000]  Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[36:26.000 --> 36:34.000]  We will face challenges, we will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.
[36:34.000 --> 36:41.000]  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[36:41.000 --> 36:53.000]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[36:53.000 --> 37:03.000]  We have been magnificent. Thank you.
[37:03.000 --> 37:15.000]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning, because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another,
[37:15.000 --> 37:34.000]  or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[37:34.000 --> 37:46.000]  For too long a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.
[37:46.000 --> 37:53.000]  Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.
[37:53.000 --> 38:01.000]  Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed.
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.000]  The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.
[38:08.000 --> 38:15.000]  Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
[38:15.000 --> 38:27.000]  And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
[38:27.000 --> 38:43.000]  That all changes starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you.
[38:43.000 --> 39:07.000]  It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day, this is your celebration, and this, the United States of America, is your country.
[39:07.000 --> 39:23.000]  What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
[39:23.000 --> 39:44.000]  January 20, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
[39:44.000 --> 39:54.000]  The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
[39:54.000 --> 40:11.000]  Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before.
[40:11.000 --> 40:21.000]  At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
[40:21.000 --> 40:31.000]  Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.
[40:31.000 --> 40:41.000]  These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.
[40:41.000 --> 40:46.000]  But for too many of our citizens a different reality exists.
[40:46.000 --> 40:58.000]  Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.
[40:58.000 --> 41:09.000]  An education system flushed with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.
[41:09.000 --> 41:21.000]  And the crime, and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
[41:21.000 --> 41:38.000]  This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
[41:38.000 --> 41:49.000]  We are one nation, and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success.
[41:49.000 --> 41:57.000]  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
[41:57.000 --> 42:09.000]  The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
[42:09.000 --> 42:24.000]  For many decades we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
[42:24.000 --> 42:36.000]  We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.
[42:36.000 --> 42:48.000]  And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
[42:48.000 --> 43:00.000]  We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
[43:00.000 --> 43:11.000]  I'm so excited. The new product at infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[43:11.000 --> 43:20.000]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[43:20.000 --> 43:31.000]  I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  And I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers.
[43:35.000 --> 43:50.000]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[43:50.000 --> 43:59.000]  It is amazing. Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com and your purchase of the operation.
[43:59.000 --> 44:08.000]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war, a 360 win.
[44:08.000 --> 44:15.000]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarsore.com.
[44:15.000 --> 44:23.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[44:29.000 --> 44:35.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[44:35.000 --> 44:42.000]  Just go to infowarsstore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[44:42.000 --> 44:49.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com, this is a sure win.
[44:49.000 --> 45:00.000]  10% off on auto ship, win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50 and all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[45:00.000 --> 45:18.000]  We have developed with the top firms in the United States powerful 50 billion live organism probiotic fluorolive that is so critical to having a healthy gut and a healthy life and that has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[45:18.000 --> 45:27.000]  The other part is a compound like mycozx that has all these key ingredients of organic herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.
[45:27.000 --> 45:37.000]  That's why as we go through Christmas and now into the new year, we're extending the free shipping and 50% off on all our best selling items while supplies last.
[45:37.000 --> 45:44.000]  You can also get the two products together and get them at 50% off when you combo them.
[45:44.000 --> 45:55.000]  So popular, sold out for more than six months, now back in stock for limited time at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.000]  That bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[46:19.000 --> 46:28.000]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[46:28.000 --> 46:35.000]  Fluorolive supports your body's core where you need it most including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[46:39.000 --> 46:44.000]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[46:44.000 --> 46:52.000]  Fluorolive is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[46:52.000 --> 47:10.000]  Head to infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of fluorolive probiotics today. That's infowarslife.com.
[47:22.000 --> 47:33.000]  We are one nation and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success.
[47:33.000 --> 47:41.000]  We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny.
[47:41.000 --> 47:53.000]  The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
[47:53.000 --> 48:08.000]  For many decades we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
[48:08.000 --> 48:20.000]  We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.
[48:20.000 --> 48:32.000]  And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
[48:32.000 --> 48:44.000]  We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
[48:44.000 --> 48:59.000]  One by one the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.
[48:59.000 --> 49:11.000]  The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.
[49:11.000 --> 49:27.000]  But that is the past and now we are looking only to the future.
[49:27.000 --> 49:38.000]  We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power.
[49:38.000 --> 49:45.000]  From this day forward a new vision will govern our land.
[49:45.000 --> 50:00.000]  From this day forward it's going to be only America first, America first.
[50:00.000 --> 50:13.000]  Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
[50:13.000 --> 50:31.000]  We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.
[50:31.000 --> 50:36.000]  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
[50:36.000 --> 50:50.000]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down.
[50:50.000 --> 50:59.000]  America will start winning again, winning like never before.
[50:59.000 --> 51:17.000]  We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.
[51:17.000 --> 51:29.000]  We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.
[51:29.000 --> 51:44.000]  We will get our people off of welfare and back to work rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
[51:44.000 --> 51:55.000]  We will follow two simple rules, buy American and hire American.
[51:55.000 --> 52:09.000]  We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.
[52:09.000 --> 52:25.000]  We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example, we will shine for everyone to follow.
[52:25.000 --> 52:45.000]  We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.
[52:45.000 --> 53:00.000]  At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
[53:00.000 --> 53:14.000]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[53:14.000 --> 53:23.000]  The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
[53:23.000 --> 53:33.000]  We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.
[53:33.000 --> 53:45.000]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[53:45.000 --> 53:52.000]  There should be no fear. We are protected and we will always be protected.
[53:52.000 --> 53:58.000]  We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement.
[53:58.000 --> 54:12.000]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[54:12.000 --> 54:17.000]  Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.
[54:17.000 --> 54:25.000]  In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.
[54:25.000 --> 54:43.000]  We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it.
[54:43.000 --> 54:55.000]  The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.
[54:55.000 --> 55:01.000]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[55:01.000 --> 55:06.000]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[55:06.000 --> 55:13.000]  We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[55:13.000 --> 55:24.000]  We stand at the birth of a little millennium ready to unlock the mysteries of space to free the earth from the miseries of disease
[55:24.000 --> 55:30.000]  and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.
[55:30.000 --> 55:38.000]  A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.
[55:38.000 --> 55:48.000]  It's time to remember that all wisdom, our soldiers, will never forget that whether we are black or brown or white,
[55:48.000 --> 55:59.000]  we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
[55:59.000 --> 56:12.000]  We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.
[56:12.000 --> 56:20.000]  And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska,
[56:20.000 --> 56:30.000]  they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life
[56:30.000 --> 56:40.000]  by the same almighty Creator.
[56:40.000 --> 56:50.000]  So to all Americans in every city, near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words.
[56:50.000 --> 56:59.000]  You will never be ignored again.
[56:59.000 --> 57:07.000]  Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny.
[57:07.000 --> 57:13.000]  And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
[57:13.000 --> 57:18.000]  Together, we will make America strong again.
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  We will make America wealthy again.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  We will make America proud again.
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.000]  We will make America safe again.
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  And yes, together, we will make America great again.
[57:33.000 --> 57:39.000]  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  Thank you.
[57:41.000 --> 58:10.000]  God bless America.
[58:11.000 --> 58:19.000]  In the history of M4's life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, SuperMail Vitality, and so many others.
[58:19.000 --> 58:25.000]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[58:25.000 --> 58:31.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products, and this part is most important.
[58:31.000 --> 58:38.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.000]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure.
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the info war.
[58:44.000 --> 58:47.000]  That's infowarslives.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[58:47.000 --> 59:09.000]  Now before we sell out, 2017 has been an earth shaking year. In 2018, guaranteed is even going to be wilder.
[59:09.000 --> 59:19.000]  We're extending free shipping store wide at infowarstore.com into early January and the massive 50 to 67% off all our best selling items.
[59:19.000 --> 59:25.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, where it's colloidal silver, or brain force, or micro zx, or fluorolife, they're now back in stock.
[59:25.000 --> 59:30.000]  They're all massively discounted with free shipping at infowarstore.com.
[59:30.000 --> 59:39.000]  Take advantage of it right through the new year in a salute to the info warriors and into a thanks to all of you that have made this operation possible.
[59:39.000 --> 59:42.000]  From myself, the entire info wars crew, thank you for your support.
[59:42.000 --> 59:45.000]  Thank you for bringing America back from the edge of death.
[59:45.000 --> 59:52.000]  And thank you for standing against the globalist and their bullying garbage.
[59:52.000 --> 59:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:05.000]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  From the front lines of the info world, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  It was 11 months and 10 days ago that President Trump was inaugurated the 45th president of the United States against all the odds and against the globalist.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  And we knew they were going to try to block his agenda and block making America great again.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  But Trump has really come through. You have really come through.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  And none of us are perfect, but we're not out to get America.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  We're not out to get capitalism. We're not out to get Christians.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  We're not out to get anybody who wants to live and let live in Western free society and culture.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  That again, isn't perfect, but has been the Renaissance the last 400 to 500 years.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  That said, this hour coming up, we get to the real meat and potatoes of the live events and speeches and breakdown that took place 11 months and 10 days ago in D.C.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  Then in the third hour, we get into the Sunday show after I came back a few days later and really went through Trump's speech and more and made my predictions that have come true.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  So very, very powerful transmission and it's key that we celebrate the victories we've had and be thankful to God, our families, to everybody that made it possible, including ourselves.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  So great job, everybody, and bravo, no matter what color you are, where you came from. If you support free market capitalism and open free society and really care about making America great again, we are all brothers and sisters together.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  So I salute you all. That said, I don't plug quite enough to fund our operation the way we need to.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  We really worked a lot harder in 2017 to bring in the same amount of capital we brought in just barely in 2016. It was a giant election year and record ratings, obviously, for M4s.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  We grew, grew, grew in 2016, doubled our audience that year. It dropped down some from that peak, but still, that was a new peak.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  Our new plateau was way above what it had been previously. But the audience under censorship and under attack, again, has been about 70% of what it was in 2016.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  And I want to continue the trend of the plateau to get back to where we were growing because the globalists are really trying to shut us down.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  Please spread the word, the articles, the videos, the live links, the podcasts, the free apps to everybody you know. It's that word of mouth that's unstoppable.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  And get great game-changing products at infowarstore.com that have changed my life and so many others. Read the five-star reviews for yourself or thousands of them on MycoZX.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  It's been sold out for over six months. It's very hard to source the organic compounds that are in it and have them at the highest standards available.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  And it really is frustrating to me that this has been sold out for more than six months.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  It's back in, but it's so powerful that I'm offering it with free shipping as a New Year's special with 50% off when you get it with our amazing Floralife Advanced Restoration 50 billion live probiotic.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  This is the top of the line, highest quality probiotic out there. There are many other probiotics that are double, triple its regular retail price that are basically the same thing.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Because they mark up high-end stuff way, way high. We don't do it, but a lot of money goes into Floralife.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  A lot of money goes into each caplet in each bottle of MycoZX. And so when we do 50% off, that is basically all the profit that we have in it.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  When you sign up also for things like auto-ship additional 10% off, well, then it's a lost leader.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  So I want you to experience how great Floralife is. That's something you regularly take just for good gut bacteria because the pesticides kill the good ones as you know.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  I mean, just 20 years ago people laughed at probiotics. Now it's admittedly one of the top sciences out there and it's just an absolute game changer.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  But what people aren't aware of is all the fungus, mold, and yeast that gets in the gut. And that's where MycoZX comes in.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  And I first took MycoZX when it was being developed a few years ago before it was even released.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  And it was so amazing what it did and the way it flushed me out and the way I lost weight and how healthy I was.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  I kicked myself just realizing the last time it sold out that I hadn't done another regimen myself because I'm just not somebody that was ever brought up with supplements and things.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  It's something I've learned to do to be healthier. It's made my life so much better.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  So get free shipping at infowarslife.com or call AAA-2533139 and get 50% off on these products when you get them together.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  They go really well together. It's critical. You can't lose because you get great products to help your body and your family and you find the info war.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  So thank you all.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air. Another Matt, go ahead.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of InfoWars.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  And I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  And that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  It might seem like a simple thing, but they're particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  Well, thank you. My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  And it's a big Deglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, infowars.com on the right arm.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  And the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt, trigger warning t-shirt,
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign in the infowars.com on the back.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at infowars.com.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  Alex Jones. He was a nice guy, actually. You like him?
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  That's good. Alex was an Alex Jones, nice guy.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  I know now from top people that you actually are for real and you understand you're in danger and you understand what you're doing is-
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be looking at me in a year or two years.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  Let's give me a little bit of time to run things.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that interview.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  He said he was going to do it and he did a great job. You'll be very proud of our contents.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  So while with it, you probably read it. It was in Drudge, who's great, by the way. Drudge is amazing.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  But the story in Drudge and Big Store, it's all over the place now.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  They're swimming across and big bags of stuff, drugs, swimming across the river, right?
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  They're swimming right across.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  We just caught these guys coming across the border. They're jumping in. They just jumped in the rafts.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  They're coming up in one, two, three, four. They have big satchels.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  And actually, the camera crew or the reporters were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  Because they're showing this on camera. The guys carrying bags of stuff, it was drugs.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  Help me! Help me!
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  Thank you.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncripple America. Thank you so much, sir.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  You will be attacked for coming on and we know you know that. Thank you.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  Thank you very much.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  Joining us now is Alex Jones from Washington, D.C. Alex.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  Well, thank you, David. Yes, it's an amazing print. I'm shocked that the guy's a listener, a big fan, and very famous.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  He's the official, you know, guy that does it for the Republican Party.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  And of course, the famous drawing of Ronald Reagan with the cowboy hat. That's him.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  But that's a side issue. I'm just going to take over here for about 10 minutes at the hand of Tom back to you guys.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  I'm going to come in later in the 14 hour marathon broadcast with you guys.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  First off, let me just take a deep breath here and break down what just happened here today.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  Undoubtedly, this was Providence. This was American destiny being invoked.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  This was Trump declaring the birthright of this Republic that George Washington talked about.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  And that Providence started back in 1776.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  He invoked it. It was so historical. And I knew they were going to invoke it.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  It just came into my mind. And I knew, even though he hasn't given the speech, and I haven't talked to Trump about this,
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  I knew what was about to happen. And I said, I've got a tweet that they're going to re invoke the birthright.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  I just feel it. That's really what this is.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  And then the media was asking me, even the New York Times had seen the tweet. They said, did you talk to Trump?
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  And how'd you go? Wasn't the speech somebody else did? And I said, no, this is American.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  You see, we're reading the same book. It's the same spirit. So I will tell them what I've talked about with Trump.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  The spirit of America. Can you feel it rising?
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  Trump feels it. He knows it. He loves it.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  He wants to serve the people and empower the people to have America be incredibly wealthy again and empower the globe.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  Back when we had 50% of the world's wealth just 30 years ago, we were sending more money to companies than we are now in more industry.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  Now all we send is corporate, the bullish, or monopoly men that do not want us to be prosperous.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  And so the message we heard in the speech has been my message for over a decade.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  I mean, longer than that, but this is Americanism versus globalism.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  So Trump isn't reading from my sheet of music. It's the sheet of music that's reality.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  And that's why it's so similar when I say on the show, no, you hear Trump say later, okay?
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  And yes, Trump obviously does listen to the show. It's filming.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  Unless you just move past all that, what really matters here is that the people are so awake.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  I mean, I'm not kidding. Every second person I walk by is a listener.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  I mean, it is blowing my mind. You've seen a lot of feeds.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  The amount of young people, the amount of teenagers are listeners.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  This is indicative of the huge, incredible awakening that is happening on a planetary scale, not just here.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  So make no mistake, this revolution against globalism, this revolution against globalism is something that belongs to the people.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  And Trump said that this revolution is about you. You are what empowers it. You are the future.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  And we're going to get out of your way and let you have your destiny, have your dreams.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  And we understand America's special in that destiny and that as America goes, the rest of the world goes.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  Washington envisioned all of this in his farewell address.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  He saw this in Providence.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  And now it's all come true. The enemy knew that. That's why they always evoke the occult.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  Evoke. Don't talk about God or Christ. Don't talk about Providence.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  Don't say America's great and all this stuff to demoralize us, not to have this birthright.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  It's why they teach you in school how horrible the idea of American Providence and manifest destiny and all of this is.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  And talk about the problems and crimes associated.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  There's problems and crimes associated with any humans or any movement.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  But overall, the greater destiny to defeat tyranny worldwide and to stop a great evil in the future.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  I believe it's going to be this republic in the future that defeats the entire world, government, anti-human, eugenics-based, technocracy system.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  So we're here. This is a giant victory for humanity.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  It is massive and looking at Michelle and looking at Obama up on the jumbotron.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  When they were singing the Tarspanel banner, Obama with that arrogant smug feeling that he's better than everybody looked like he was dying.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  A fake smile. Michelle was frowning the entire time because these are cult members who were put in power by the globalists so that they could help destroy the country and divide the nation.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  They're absolutely evil and want poor people not to have a future. That's why he goes to Africa and says, you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  Because he is literally there to hurt poor people across the board and they needed that face, though, as their cover to carry it out.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  Donald Trump right now is making hundreds of phone calls a day trying to get jobs into Detroit, trying to get jobs into Atlanta, trying to get jobs into all these places in the Midwest as well.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  Very, very, very exciting stuff is happening. This is just an incredible time to be alive and I cannot stress to everybody how historical this is because everything the New World Order has done has been designed to bring this country down
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  because they can't have a big free, open, wealthy nation state with a big fat mill class, upwardly mobile people inside this impoverished, anti-human world government system they're establishing.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  The American system gives too much competition for them. They admit that in the white papers. The British government 200 years ago wrote they couldn't compete with the American system.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  And again, the British now are throwing off globalism. They're throwing off these monopoly systems.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  So this is an incredible time to be alive. It is an amazing time to be alive and it is quite frankly so humbling and stunning.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  The fact that we go through these crowds of people, people of every race, color, creed are all just humans with red blood. This is breaking the will of the media that's trying to create racial division and trying to say that if you're not a white person, you can't have guns or private property or a future.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  You don't have the American birthright. You don't have a future of wealth. That's your enemy. That's racist.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  This is a cult programing to make people poor and make them the slaves of the globalists who all over the world will play different groups up against each other, which Ukraine will play Catholic off against Orthodox.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  Or it's a country in Africa. They'll play the Christians off against the, you know, the animus of the Muslims or vice versa. It's all divide and conquer because the elite are destroying nations.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  They're trying to make us poor. So America died basically in the last few years. It was a globalist program, bushes and clippings behind it with criminal elements of the intelligence agencies.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  But America isn't just a person. I'm sure a person doesn't get resurrected unless it's Jesus or Lazarus, but a country can come back from the dead.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  And America began to come back from the dead in the last few months and now has come back to life. The Phoenix is coming up right now.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  And how powerful that Phoenix is, how incredible that destiny is, is up to us. We are what breathes life into the spirit, it into us.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  And the enemy knows everything's energy. You see, forget all the religious books and all the stuff you can hear from the preachers who are there to control the paradigm.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  They, the enemy wants to destroy our spirit, make us feel weak so we don't take our birthright destiny.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  We're taking the destiny in our hands. We're breathing life into it. And those devil worshipers out there, the enemy, Chuck E. Schumer, devil worshiper, Obama, devil worshippers, well known.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  These are devil worshippers. What's a devil worshipper? They want to hurt other people. They want to be number one. They don't like seeing somebody succeed.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  Okay? What's somebody that wants prosperity and renaissance? They want wealth, cornucopia. They're not jealous of somebody who's got a big house or a good looking wife or vice versa.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  As long as you don't take something from me, I think your success is great. These people are devil worshippers. And what happened today was the chief executive invited God back in and said,
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  the door's open and the set of the people, the door's open now to you. If you want this birthright, if you want goodness, we've all got to be good. We've got to come together and we've got to, your black heart, white people, your white heart, whatever.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  We've got to come together about issues that we stand for and what we believe in and transcend all the control. The media pushed way too hard with all the race garbage.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  Now they're saying he's a Russian spy. Now they're saying they've got communiques with him and the Russians. And literally now, he tells. It's not just Maxi Waters.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  It's the New York Times that says that Putin actually told him Hillary was crooked.

[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  It's not just Max C. Waters, it's the New York Times now says that Putin actually told him Hillary was crooked.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  That's right America, you can't have your own idea. You can't have a strong leader.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  The Russians are the reason Trump got elected and everything comes from the Russians.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  That's BS. Nothing against the Russians, but we, American events, a lot of stuff too.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  We come up with a lot of stuff. Yeah, I mean, give me a break.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  You don't think we can't come up with crooked Hillary? Hell, somebody with a lobotomy can come up with that.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  That'd be that smart to come up with a crooked Hillary.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  So this is history happening right now. I want to skip this network break and David and I and the crew can pop it whenever they want here.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  But I'm going to go get settled down in an office and just take a shower or something and just get on my knees and pray to God.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  I'll be honest with you. I want to get in a room by myself and hit my knees and start crying because this is so good.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  If I'm telling you, man, the evil's going to strike back. We got to be watching them. We got to be ready.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  But we know who they are. We know their plan and I got to say it. It's been info wars.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  It's been info wars and you the people and our analysis has led the way as the blueprint battle plan to blow the hell out of them.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  I'll tell you, people always want me to take credit. I'm a humble person, but we need to take credit to know what we're doing is working.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  Info wars and our guests and myself and you the listeners, the eyes and ears on the ground and Matt Drudge and all of us together are the info war.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  We are the blueprint of the operating system that just kicked the new orders ass.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  We got it. It's America 2.0 supercharged, ready, common, committed and our spirit, Trump sure is a thousand to one and our presidents even got the name Trump.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  So get ready. Yeah. The answer to 1984 is 1776. Hey, what's to get in here? Hey, you guys feel the energy?
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  Americanism, my globalism will be our credo.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  Bless you, sir. God bless you. God bless you. It's okay to love freedom. It's okay to believe. It's okay to be strong.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  Here's the deal. We're not just getting hyped up by Trump and then feeling good. We have the tools. We have the means. We have the history.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  We got the pedigree. We got it all. Everybody here is America and we and as long as the globalists bring people in, turn them against America.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  We're going to be able to bring a lot of people in once they're not getting brainwashed as soon as they get here. It's incredible time to be alive. Go ahead, sir.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  I'm with the break part. What did you think of the speech? They really laid the wood to him.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  He laid the wood to him, but he empowered the people and let them know you are this revolution. You are the victory.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  And he just brought what everything George Washington envisioned back, America 2.0, and just basically rebooted and launched the system.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  And it came out of there like a fiery phoenix, fiery, the dragon, the globalists are crapping their drawers right now.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  This was pure Americana and trailblazing and science and vision and just absolutely empowering this country.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  Because under globalism, the decision was made to just shut us down and ship it overseas and parlay that into global power so some corporations could play God.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  But these corporations don't even have a vision or a spirit. It's just a bunch of empty guys up there claiming they're free market, but they're not free market.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  They're about to see real free market. They're about to see the Republic get up off of its knees and it's happening now. America was reborn today.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  The spirituality of the speech was a very spiritual speech, unlike a lot of the rally speeches.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  And I tweeted right before I said he's going to invoke the providence. He's going to invoke the covenant and he did it because that's the key.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  Listen, I didn't even be that much of a religious person till I got deeper in and study these people. They all understand that they have to get God out, not let us feel empowered, not let us know about America's destiny,
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  not teach what George Washington said they need to kill that narrative because from their atheist or globalist view from psychological view, it gives us a culture that unifies us.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  So they've been killing our culture and then they've been bringing in this alien culture of everybody hating each other and fighting with each other and trying to bring us down.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  But then while they suck and sap our energy. So the second phase of slavery just fell today.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  If humans are trying to progress through the future, it's what they call themselves the progressives. They're the opposite. They're not the progressives.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  They're regressives. That's what the Jacobin Party was about. And that's what the Democrats were called was the Jacobin or French Revolution Party.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  They wanted to regress everything and basically set up their own new tyranny. What you're seeing here is the real renaissance and what you're seeing here is the real 1776.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  That's the last thing. So the subtext of Senator Schumer's speech about going into battle, was that a call to arms to the left to keep fighting?
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  Yes, he was trying to get everybody to boo him so he could say, oh, I came and I was nice and they were mean to me.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  But everybody slept through it.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  Everybody slept through it. He was clearly putting the knife in. Sorry. I'm like, you know, trying to twist it. People didn't really take the bait.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  I caught myself trying to take the bait and I went, no, no, he's trying to set us up. And then it just failed. He was just trying to bring back all this open old wounds.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  Like in a mess?
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  Big mess. Yeah, Donald Trump had a grand slam today and Chuckie Schumer or Chuckie Scammer. I mean, it just, it was a total foul ball. He failed.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  Thank you very much, sir.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  All right, thank you so much.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  Still on here.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  All right. Yes, sir. God bless you. Anybody else want to get on team radio?
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  Here, sir. Come on in here. Start breastfella. What's your name, sir?
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  Marshall McGill.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  Marshall McGill, we'll talk about your takeover.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  Hey, hey, you know what? Today was the beginning of something new. We've been waiting for this for a long time. And you know, the most important thing I saw the day was that our president is putting back America first.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  We've been compromising. We've been putting everybody else second. We didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings. We were politically correct.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  And today our president says America has nothing wrong with any other country putting themselves first. But we're going to put ourselves first.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  And we're going to focus on building our inner cities. We're going to focus on building our rural areas out west.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  We're going to be focusing on education. And most of all, what I got today was that our president says we're going to put God first.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  Right.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  And the Bible says in Proverbs 14 and 30 that righteous is exaltation and sin brings it down.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  That's right. He brought the power back here.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  There you go. We can't do anything without God. And when we put God first, nothing will be impossible for us.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  So the most important thing it is today out of all the different agendas and so forth was putting God first.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  And if we seek God first, everything else will be added to it.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  So I'm encouraged today that we're starting over and I'm encouraged today that we're putting God first.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  And I believe this nation is going to see a quick turnaround.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  I'm not talking about years and years, but we're going to see the first year seem like he's been in office 10 years because God is going to be on it.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  You watch what God says.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  I want to continue. Listen, it's not mumbo jumbo.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  They were very sick about this piece, but I could feel it when I was going in there.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  I said, I feel like Providence, he's going to invoke God and bring God back in and ask us to accept God in.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  And that will just like fill the vacuum and push all this evil out.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  I mean, you take God out, evil pours in, you can feel it.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  It's about who you pursue.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  And wherever you pursue and wherever your aims are, that's where the energy and the power is going to come from.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  And we put God first.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  Like we're doing today, it's just the beginning.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  It's not night is going to happen.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  But when we begin to pursue God, this might say at one time, if you can't run a walk, if you can't walk, then crawl.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  And if you can't crawl, just look that way.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  And when you turn your eyes that way, and God, he looks at us.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  Pretty soon you can crawl.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  Then you start walking, then you start running, and then you begin to see changes.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  And I really believe that the day America has woken up.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  And you know what, regardless of what your political party is, what you believe, personally, morally or whatever.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  But the fact is that we have to embrace democracy.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  America spoke, America won, and America has its country back.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  Absolutely. And I want to warn the elite, even if they kill Trump, the spirit is us, as we kept saying.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  It's already been opened up, it's already rising, and they're not going to stop it.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  All of the world countries are trying to get off under the globalists.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  The globalists are very, very evil, and they're trying to set up their world government that the Bible tells us about.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  These are evil people.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  Yeah, we're living in the last days.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  We're living in perilous times.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  And the Bible says that the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violence is taken by force.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  We can no longer be passive.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  We can no longer just sit back and watch our country go to hell.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  We can't do that.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  We've got to stand up for what is right, and we've got to take our positions as men and women of God.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  Not just for us, but we're going to be judged by what happens to the generation behind us.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  It's a no-brainer.

[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  We have to be good. We have to be pure. We have to be strong. We have to build prosperity. We have to bring everyone of every race, color, and creed together
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  if we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believed we were going to fail, who believed their divide and conquer would work.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  Yes, we've won the first phase, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just begun.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  But Obama and Hillary and Soros, he were losers from the day you were born.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  This is the heart of 1776. Get a white male. It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning. I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking alive.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones. This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. David Knight and the rest of the great crew are there in studio. I'm going to talk to a few more people out here on the street, and then I'm going to go get a little bite to eat, and then I'm going to be back on.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  I really need to focus, write some notes, and just be very humble, because this is a very special time.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  The evil that was getting ready to unfold, you thought things were already evil? They were about to launch the full evil.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  Total takeover of the media, arresting patriots, torturing us, I mean the whole nine yards.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  And it was so horrible that even the intelligence agencies just said, we just can't do this. This is crazy. It's like a comic book of evil. I mean, it's just so evil.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  You see movies, you read history books, both fiction and non-fiction. You think things like this can't really be happening until you see it happen.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  And we saw a guy trying to get three llamas in this morning past Homeland Security, and it's like, we had sick photos out there. No one would believe it.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  I'm going to put those up later. It's like, bomb in the llama or something. I mean, it's just so much.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  My point is, crazy stuff's going on. Roger Stone shows up in a huge top hat. He's been poisoned by polonium.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  We're living in crazy times. To the left, the right, all points of the compass, it is wild. Sir, tell us who you are and tell us what you think about this today.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  Nice to be here. Nice to be here. Nice to see you. And my name is Philip Thomas. I'm a naturalized American citizen.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  I lived in many parts of the world. I lived in Muslim countries, and I know how human rights are being violated.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  And people of other religions are treated like dirt.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  And this country is a great country for the past eight years. We had a nightmare with Obama.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  And that nightmare is over today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  The African American brother said a lot of quotation he gave from the Bible. You read Daniel chapter two.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  You will find God is the installer and God is the remover of kings. Today, God had installed Mr. Trump as the president of this country.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  That's right. We voted, but nothing the enemy could do worked. It all turned against it was Providence.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  I can't tell you the Providence I've experienced.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  You know, my heart bleeds when I see the young people supporting Democratic Party, which is directionless.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  And now, you know what's happening with Democratic Party? They're trying to take Keith Ellison as the chief and he is Islamist.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  He wants to destroy United States. And Americans should wake up.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  If you don't wake up, you will be in your slumber and your slumber will lead to death.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  The war Muslims are divided the world into two parts, Darul Harb and Darul Islam.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  Where Islamic rule is there, it is known as Darul Islam, which means house of Islam. And when there is no Islamic rule, it is known as Darul Harb, which means house of war.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  And the house of Islam should wage constantly war against the house of war, which is Darul Harb.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  Now, America is considered as Darul Harb by the Darul Islam, and they are waging a war against us.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  What he had is the weapon they are using.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  And so we have to be careful. And Alex Jones is doing a great job. I've been watching his videos on YouTube.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  And my son, who lives in India, always calls and tells me, don't forget, don't neglect Alex Jones' views.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  It's very important and it will save America. And I'm so glad.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  You have a huge listeners in India.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  Yeah, of course you have. And after tomorrow, I'm flying to India. And I'm going to be an ambassador for Mr. Trump.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  Great. But enough about me. Talk about where you see the country going.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  Pardon?
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  Talk about me. I mean, talk about where you're going.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  Oh, sorry. Yeah, yeah. So we have to be very careful about the Islamic agenda.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  You know, they say Muslims are all good. Oh, let them be good at home.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  Okay. But they want to destroy United States.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  Outside the United States, they said America is a devil. But here they say God bless America.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  There's an Arabic, the Muslim doctor called Al-Takia, lie before your enemy, but hate them in your heart.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  That's what's happening. So America should wake up and give an answer.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  Well, I think America is starting to wake up.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  Yes.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  If they kill Trump, which I know they're seriously considering doing, I think it'll be an even bigger defeat for them.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  I don't think that will happen because our police, our military, our secret service, they're all strong.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  They're the best.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  I agree, but they're going to try as I'm saying.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  Oh, yeah, of course. Yes. Yes. Of course, they'll try, but they try being vain.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  But Trump will triumph.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  Jesus will protect. Jesus will protect. Yes.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  Because God is the installer and has installed Mr. Trump to become the president of this greatest nation
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  and the greatest superpower ever in the history of mankind.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  So I'm so glad to be here.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  And if you want some of my views, I can tell you what America should become strong.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  A strong America is the one to stop Islamization of this world.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  Well, let's talk about this. I mean, look at how the globalists are so upset right now.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  They can tell the tide's turning. Q, I've got to get your view. You've got to use all this thing. Get over here.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  No, you're getting on there. I'm sorry, you're doing it.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  Thank you, sir.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  Thank you very much.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  What do you think about this situation? Hey, sir, you get in there. I didn't know sir was here.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  This entire inauguration has been extremely historic, obviously.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  And just seeing the energy completely, seeing the energy.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  A seismic old shaft, a supernova of enlightenment, a tidal release of the Titans of Liberty.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, go ahead.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  The look people had going in this morning was obviously already high energy, but just leaving today,
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  seeing all the people leaving, they're re-energized. They're rejuvenated and ready to make America great again.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  Absolutely. And again, it's not that the Republican establishment's had to get Trump.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  I hate the Republican establishment, but some of the Democrats, it's so obvious that he's anti-New World Order and awesome.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  You're awesome. Come on here on air.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  I made it here.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  Well, you're awesome.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  Oh my God, I love you.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  You're awesome. You're awesome. Here, talk to folks out there.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  I love you.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  Come on, sir.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  Here, talk to folks out there.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  I have my info wars right now here.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  I have my info wars live. Thank you. Go ahead, talk to folks.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  Oh my God, somebody take a picture of me, please.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  What do you think about the whole inauguration?
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  I am like so, I am like, my heart is so happy. I just, I just love this. I love Mr. Trump.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  I met him in 2013, and he is such a good person. And when I found out he was running, I had to run down and fly down to Miami.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  And he has such a good heart. He is not a racist. He loves this country.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  And he just wants to unite us just like he said in this speech, we all bleed red.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  Every one of us, white, red, white, you know, black, Hispanic, Japanese, whoever you are, we are all red.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  And we are patriots. And I love Alex Jones because he's the only one I listen to.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  Well, thanks for coming. It was awesome. History happened. I was going to bring my son, but it's just too dangerous.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  They were attacking women. I mean, all of them were coming by bleeding. I go, what's going on?
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  Women on crutches. Old ladies are like, they're beating us up, trying to get in.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  The leftists down there, and I went down there and they attacked us.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  I mean, it's just like, what the hell? And they really go, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  I'm like, what the hell are you talking about? They're like, Putin's a Nazi.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  It's the Russians who beat the Nazis, dumbass. They just don't know anything.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  They just have no historical end. They just believe MSNBC.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  I'll tell you, only a few thousand of the protesters, millions of people away, and your BS is coming to an end.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  So, yeah, yeah, 1776 worldwide.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  All right, listen, guys, David Knight, you guys can pop in whenever you want here.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  David, what do you think of all this? Leigh Ann, everybody.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  Well, you know, Alex, listening to the preachers that have been there and the other crowd that have been there,
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  I think it's pretty important to go back and look at what Franklin Graham said.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  You know, he said in the Bible, as he got up and spoke, he said,
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  the Bible reign is a sign of God's blessing, and it started to reign when he came to the platform.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  Not to grieve. You developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  Why is this so good?
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslives.com.

[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.

[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  And if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.

[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  In fact, my good friend Stephon Malinu said it's going to be like the Battle of the Gods, Ragnarok.

[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  Take advantage of it right through the new year in a salute to the info warriors and into a thanks to all of you that have made this operation possible.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  From myself, the entire info wars crew, thank you for your support.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  Thank you for bringing America back from the edge of death.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  And thank you for standing against the globalist and their bullying garbage.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  I'm here with Alex Jones. We're celebrating one of the most historic things that ever have happened in the United States of America.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  We actually got the power of actual people.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  Donald Trump gave us that power today.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  And God bless us. God bless America. God bless Donald Trump today.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  And I just thank God for you, Alex Jones, for helping to wake so many people up.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  You don't realize how many people you touched.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  I've been listening to you for over a decade and been following the truth.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  And I'm like, God bless you. It's very humbling. Thank you. But God bless you guys for being involved in the not letting the media bully you into submission.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  Ladies who wanted to talk for a bit of a great job.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  Thank you. Thank you.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  I'll tell you this. I'm going to say something to these ladies.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  What's happening here is the globalist got so delusional that all their hate and all their lies and all their disinfo didn't turn people the way they thought it turned them away from them.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  They have become insane and they can't admit their failing on every front.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  And Trump has said he's changed the last few years. I have two, but so does everybody else.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  It's like the hundred monkeys. If you want to not believe in spirit or six cents that's been proven.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  It's that they'll have like an island with monkeys 20 miles away, the same species.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  And as soon as a certain number of monkeys on one island learn something, they don't know why suddenly the other one's 20 miles away learning.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  And so there's something going on and it's like it's the invisible human internet.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  And so right now Trump is growing too. And Trump is imagining all the stuff he's getting hit by in the discernment.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  And he's asking God for providence and to lead God and direct him.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  Imagine what he's going to be given just as George Washington grew, grew, grew with all the discernment he was given.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  Come on, man. Come on in here. Whoever wants to get in here.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  And I'm going to hand the baton over right now the next 15 minutes. David Knight, you guys will be over in a minute.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  Come on in here, sir.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  Or whoever wants to talk, just jump in.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  OK, I just want to say it's an amazing experience being here and finally having a previous regime end.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  And he, I don't know, given the truth and a new light by Alex and all the people in the new media.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  And I just an unabashed plug DNA of force by a true selenium pleased by the products.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  They're fantastic. And, you know, I know you don't plug enough.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  And so just by support of freedom, we're crushing the old stream media and it's a new dawn.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  It's a new era. It's exciting. It's I can't believe it's over.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  And I like that the old stream.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  It's the era of the people. It's the era of a new America.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  Beautiful, brother. Beautiful. All right, guys.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  Anybody else want to hand the baton back to our crew?
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  All right, run on in here. Come on in.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  I'm a college student. I just want to say it's been incredible to watch how much the political landscape has changed in the last couple of months.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  Just being able to express yourself has been something that we've been unable to do because as soon as you say something, you're labeled, you're attacked.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  And it's a way of controlling our speech and it's a way of controlling us.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  And it's just been amazing to see that ship change.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  And it's important that young people start to get involved and we start fighting back against this political correctness that is completely destroyed academia.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  I mean, it's been it's been another nightmare.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  It's been to destroy pretty thought. Absolutely.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  Well, it's important that we start fighting back because that's all we have.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  We need to be autonomous and independent and we need to think analytically and critically.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  And if we do that, we'll be more informed.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  Hey, I love you guys. I got to roll out.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  You guys, great job.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  All right, anybody else want to say something?
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  I just want to say one thing real quick.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  Go ahead.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Southeast Regional Office.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  And I worked against the GOP to support Trump.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  There are a lot of people that were just not on board for Trump where I work.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  And it was all volunteer.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  We grassroots Pennsylvania.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  So good day for Trump.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  Yay.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  All right, thank you.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  Anybody else want to work against people in their own party?
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  Well, continue.
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  This is Glenn Zarmanoff reporting live from Washington, D.C.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  We are changing New Jersey, Jersey City for 9 11 truth.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  I've been in the info war since 2001 since I found Alex Jones.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  I was already awake to 9 11 truth before that because I'm a 9 11 eyewitness.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  You can please check out my YouTube channel, Glenn Zarmanoff, G L E N N Z A R M A N O V.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  And you can find the five terabytes that came out in 2000 and test declassified from
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  NIST that they withheld intentionally 5,000 gigabytes of previously kept secret videos
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  and photos from 9 11 that proves the whole thing is an inside job before we had speculation
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  and conjecture.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  Now we have five terabytes.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  Please check it out.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  Glenn Zarmanoff.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  Hey, guys, I'm running low on batteries for maybe like two more people and then we'll
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  have to end it.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  But here's here's another fine fellow that came up.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  Here you go, sir.
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  Oh, hi.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  I'm Will Cody.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  I was just walking down there from the rally right coming over here.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  And he's like, he's Antifa guys.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  I don't know what they like they're wearing black like bandanas on, you know, all black.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  They're getting a big flag like the hammer and sickle on it.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  And they like they spit on me like this is terrible.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  Like they're all radicalized there.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  People are just terrible.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  All right, man, thanks a lot.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  Looks like the crowd has dissipated as soon as Alex Jones walked off.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  And so I'm going to throw it back to you guys.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  I'm running low on battery anyways is Rob do reporting from just outside the capitals
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  right over there.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  And that's where they swore in Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  We've got some live footage here.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  They're already flashing with police.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  This is Fox News showing tear gas being fired at people and protesters attacking people
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  because, you know, we cannot have a peaceful transition of power if these brats don't get
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  their way.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  Well, they do whatever they want.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  These are the children of Obama.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  These are people who like Obama don't respect the democratic process.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  He didn't get what he wanted from our elected representative.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  So he just did executive orders.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  These people don't get what they want out of the election.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  So what do they do?
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  They take to the streets, they attack people and call it free speech.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  No, it's not.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  Let's call it what it is.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  Okay, they're setting fire to a crowded theater.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  This is what these people are doing and they need to be shut down.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  And so this is back and forth.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  Back and forth, yeah, protesters just threw it back at the police there.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  I guess they deployed some at the to disperse the crowd.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  But obviously things are already getting wild.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  The parade hasn't even started and they had been planning these protests to go all along
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  the parade route today.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  Of course, there's about 8000 people participating in this parade with all of these Antifa people
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  here on the sides.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  And of course, Donald Trump said he was going to be getting the power back to the people,
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  but I don't think he meant these people.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  The key thing, and this is a report that's up on info wars.com.
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  And we're going to show you this clip of this in just a moment.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  Alex Jones said what they're doing here is the DC police who are really under the control
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  of President Obama.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  These people have been standing down and allowing this to happen with the protesters.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  And that's what you need to understand.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  They have taken a non-confrontational viewpoint to allow this to happen.
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  They want this to happen.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  The mainstream media is going to run with this and say, look at this.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  We have a divided America.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  Info war has broken out.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  This is not a legitimate president.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  All the stuff that we've been hearing, that's the narrative that they want you to see.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  This is what they want to have happen.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  That's why Obama allowed this to happen.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  And the report we have up on info wars.com is police allow BLM to attack women at the
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  Trump inauguration.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  Of course, we've seen not only rain, but we've seen the police in DC allow the free reign
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  of Black Lives Matter.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  And you've got an article here where you got an example of how the mainstream press is trying
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  to create a narrative saying, look, nobody showed up for Donald Trump's inauguration.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  Such a divided country here.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  People, you know, what a difference it is between him and President Obama.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  I mentioned this earlier with the optics that the media is trying to use.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  So here's this is CNN.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  If you guys can get this picture here on this iPad.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  So they say the inaugural crowds, Trump's versus Obama's.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  He campaigned on the huge crowd sizes.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  But the turnout for President Trump's inauguration appears to be smaller than that of his predecessor.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  And so they're using a photograph from early this morning before the crowd was even there
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  versus this is probably when the actual Obama's inauguration was going on.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  So they're going to just let this fake news roll out.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  And we all saw with our own eyes as the inauguration was happening with Donald Trump.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  This place was packed.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  But this is what CNN fake news is saying the inauguration look like because people are
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  so against public enemy number one, President Donald Trump.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  And of course, as you, as we began the program, we were talking about the glowing terms in
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  which the mainstream media was describing Obama's inauguration eight years ago.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  They're talking about the beautiful weather, how unseasonably warm it was, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  So this is against the weather.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  This is against the Black Lives Matter people who have been allowed to shut down the
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  entrances, getting into the inauguration area as well.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  And so they create all of this and then come out with their scene.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  We told you so, and then nobody showed up.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  That's not true.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  Hillary won the popular vote.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  I want to play this clip that we have as part of this article.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  This is from our crew and Alex Jones in Washington, D.C., showing how Black Lives Matter was
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  allowed to attack women, showing how the police have stood down to allow this to happen.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  Here's that clip from Alex Jones and crew.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  I pulled myself up by his testicles.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  Okay, the leftists, now they are blocking the gates.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  And ma'am, tell folks who you are and what happened to you.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  I'm Shannon Martinez.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  I was trying to get in the gate back there.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  I went to cross the line.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  As you can see, I have a cane.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  I have RSD.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  They yanked me to the ground.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  Who did?
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  They started kicking me, the protesters.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  They started kicking me.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  I got kicked in the face, and a grown man kicked me twice in the chest.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  The only thing that saved me was my motorcycle.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  Did they get arrested?
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  No.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  The police were standing there.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  When I got up and was crying, the police literally turned their back to me.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  The reporters were the ones that asked if I was okay.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  Where are these protesters?
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  Black Lives Matter.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  Are they still there right now?
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  Yes.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  You know where John Marshall Park is?
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  They entered to John Marshall Park.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Right that white check way down there.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  Did they attack you?
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  They attacked me.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  They attacked everyone.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  They literally yanked me to the ground, took my cane, and started kicking me.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  For the sake of honesty, I think that's the only gate they were blocking.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  I didn't see that.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  They blocked the steps too.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  Did the guys go to the police?
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  We got a great president.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  Well, hey, in a little while.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  In a little while.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  Okay, I'm going out in a minute.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  Yeah.

[01:59:55.600 --> 02:00:04.600]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:12.600]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:15.600]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:20.600]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about growing up the White House.
[02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:27.600]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:38.600]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:44.600]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:48.600]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:54.600]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:59.600]  From the front lines of the info wheel, it's Alex Jones.
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:15.600]  Welcome to the beginning of the third hour of the first transmission of 2018.
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:19.600]  That's going to take some getting used to.
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:22.600]  The globalists don't want us to build our own economy.
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:25.600]  But when you fund the info war, you fund your own future.
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:28.600]  You've seen the dividends just in the tax cuts, the sovereignty,
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:31.600]  our borders getting secure that supporting info war has already brought you.

[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:40.600]  Right now at infowarstore.com, this special is about to end.
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:44.600]  But let's also look at the victims of globalism and how welfare is used to control them.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:50.600]  I know people, they work three jobs and they live next to somebody who doesn't work at all.
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:55.600]  And the person who's not working at all and has no intention of working at all
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:03.600]  is making more money and doing better than the person that's working his and her ass off.
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:07.600]  And it's not going to happen. Not going to happen.
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:11.600]  Give me my food stamps.
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:14.600]  Do you really want to work or do you just want to get a free check?
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:17.600]  I just want to get a free check.
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:19.600]  There's a sign behind you that says Waverly Job Center.
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:24.600]  Do you have any intention of going in to get a job or are you just going to get the food stamps?
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:27.600]  I'm not looking for a job.
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:32.600]  Why should I have to go work at retail and deal with snobby customers?
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:38.600]  Why? Why should I have to dare choose to do that?
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:42.600]  We call the Department of Children and Families to see what they've been doing to help.
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:49.600]  DCF says Hillsborough Kids Incorporated has been helping by paying Adam's rent, even providing her furniture.
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:52.600]  Adam says it isn't enough.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:56.600]  Somebody needs to pay for all my children.
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:02:59.600]  And my and Gary all are suffering.
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:03.600]  Somebody needs to be held accountable and they need to pay.
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:12.600]  I honestly don't want to work and I'm not going to.
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:13.600]  Can't force me.
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:16.600]  I need my food stamps. I need them.
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:21.600]  Okay, this is not a joke. Just give me my food stamps. It's all I'm asking for.
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:31.600]  They are not incapacitated in any way or they don't have a mental or physical disability that's documented and or could be observable.
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:39.600]  More counties will join them as federal exemptions to the requirements expire now that unemployment is below 10% for each affected county.
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:44.600]  I felt really bad about being on food stamps for a while. They're just for people who really, really need it.
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:47.600]  I thought and I'm like living this flippant lifestyle in San Francisco.
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:49.600]  Do you think you really, really need it?
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:55.600]  Well, yeah. And eventually I just sort of realized that even though I'm 24, I still have responsibilities.
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:01.600]  I still have like hopes for my future and if I need to be on food stamps to make that happen, then maybe I do really need it.
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:02.600]  Are you employed?
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:03.600]  No.
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:05.600]  How do you feel about that?
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:13.600]  I'm comfortable with it and I feel like I don't need to work for one because I get a check from the government every month.
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:18.600]  Do you feel guilty about using your food stamp card when you have $850,000 in the bank?
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:29.600]  No. No, I don't. I'm going by the rules and if they need to change their rules, they can change their rules.
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:31.600]  But I don't see I'm doing anything wrong.
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:33.600]  How much do you collect and benefits?
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:40.600]  I give $780 in food stamps, $550 in tenants and I get Medicaid and WIC.
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:44.600]  Give me my food stamps.
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:52.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:56.600]  Welfare reform. Does anybody want welfare reform?
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:07.600]  I'm so excited. The new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:16.600]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:28.600]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:37.600]  and I came up with our own formulae working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:46.600]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:49.600]  It is amazing.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:59.600]  Red pill now available at m4warsstore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:36.600]  Nobody is untouchable. No one is invincible. No one's untouchable by other men, much less God.
[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:51.600]  And God is beginning to cut down the globalists like rats, the corrupt evil communist pope, the communist Chinese, the biggest mass murders in history, Saudi Arabians that oppress women and murder people worldwide.
[02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:57.600]  They're all panicking against our new president, Donald John Trump.
[02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:07.600]  I got told me two years ago to get behind Trump, but Ted Cruz had better rhetoric. So I was for him the first few months, but then I saw some things I didn't like.
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:14.600]  And even before the dirty tricks in Iowa and places, I went for Trump and I said, my guts never wrong.
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:18.600]  And as I get older, I learned to always follow. When I was young, I wouldn't prove me right.
[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:34.600]  And man, I am humbled by President Trump. I am humbled by his discernment, his knowledge, his piercing discernment and analysis.
[02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:47.600]  Now, in this first hour, I'm going to air 20 plus minutes of the entire inaugural speech. Some of it is him thanking the Clintons and other presidents, but it's all backhanded because then he says,
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:53.600]  you did a great job doing all this horrible stuff, but now that all comes to an end.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:08:11.600]  And there are Ted Brits in there. And again, I was there just two days ago, just right below the podium, witnessing it and the rebirth of America.
[02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:19.600]  And the biggest piece of news, the biggest Trump secret I'm going to give out here, and you're going to say, oh, I've heard this a bunch the last year on your show. Yes.
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:26.600]  Trump, but you notice what you hear on the show, and even the New York Times and a bunch of other publications had to admit this.
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:34.600]  What you hear here, you then hear from Trump, but not because Trump's getting it from me. This is the spirit of America and the truth.
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:45.600]  Do you understand that it's admitted in congressional hearings that they call it disruptive technologies, a 200 mile to the gallon carburetor they had 25 years ago.
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:57.600]  Hell, 40 years ago, they had 100 something mile solar panels that basically never break, never go out and that have five times the gathering capacity of the very best systems today, things like that.
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:08.600]  They're slowly doling out the technology. The elites are on incredible power trips, sequestering it for a breakaway civilization. The future is here. It's just not evenly distributed.
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:23.600]  Trump intends to flood the entire planet with true globalism with America as the operating system, the true America, not the modern liberal globalist eugenics America,
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:39.600]  but really working with people, really standing up for cultures that have good societies, crushing radical Islam and transferring to the public and transferring and ordering the pharmaceutical companies to know we're not going to treat all these cancers.
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:47.600]  You're going to give them the cures. And when I say cures, some people individually won't respond, but they've got stuff that's 99% effective.
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:54.600]  The elites are getting and it's how they're living 110, 150.
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:10:04.600]  So if you're educated and informed, you know all this and a lot of people under the old globalist model were clamoring to be part of the new civilization that they thought would be separate from humanity.
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:16.600]  And if they groveled with the new world order, they would get the cancer treatments. They would get the life extension. They could be part of the secret programs and projects.
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:24.600]  I guess those on Elysium would have access to. That's not happening now.
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:42.600]  If Trump has his way, the biggest secret of Trump is that he intends to turn loose all these disruptive technologies and to actually let partners have them and to work with Russia and others that also have advanced technologies
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:52.600]  because he knows a deal was made to let China take over with economic warfare and let them control the system because they'd proven themselves evil, killing over 100 million of their own people.
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:11:01.600]  So our elite went to work with China just like they had meant in the last month. I told you months ago, they'll plan on China propping up world government, China to save this collapsing system.
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:07.600]  And then they come out in the news in hundreds of publications, communist China to save the new world order and to defeat Trump.
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:17.600]  See, our own media siding with people that oppress their own population. People ask, especially intelligence agencies and military and others, they go, how does Jones know this?
[02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:30.600]  I had the New York Times walk into me and say, you had to talk to Trump. I talked to you. I said, yeah, you tweeted that Trump is going to declare the new American century and godly providence and invoke God and take the birthright.
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:40.600]  Did you talk to him? I said, I said, I'm not going to comment because I just talked to him that week. I said, I didn't talk to him about that.
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:50.600]  I listed that New York Times guy who was just empty sold an intellectual smart but empty sold. And I said, it's the spirit, like the sixth sense, the ether, the brain's internet.
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:12:01.600]  I said, this is the destiny of America that people 500 years ago in England and Germany and the Netherlands in France envisioned in their minds this whole future.
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:09.600]  Hell, 200 years ago they were envisioning biometrics computers. They drew the double helix before an electron microscope was invented. They knew it.
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:29.600]  That's how beautiful humans are. And Trump knows that and wants to empower people, not enslave them. He feels small when you're small. The elite are so small, they feel good when you're down on the ditch, poor, a peon.
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:40.600]  So they're all over the news saying he's destroying the American run world government, the new world order. It's not American run. They used our power, our ingenuity, our system to build it and to destroy it.
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:54.600]  They build their world government while they destroy us and they don't deliver any of the promises of the new global Atlantis that they got all the loving smart, hardworking people to join them.
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:13:12.600]  They got so many members of my family in the last 60 years who are all tops of their classes or the best in the army or the best of what they did to join them believing they were there to help poor people, believing they were there to deliver technology, believing they were there to really do all this and it was all a lie.
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:24.600]  Well, Trump knows about all this and this is now not a lie, ladies and gentlemen, and that's why the enemy of humanity is freaking out, pulling out every stop, having convulsions.
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:42.600]  Next hour, I'm going to show you what has just recently been re-released from 60 Minutes in 1964, Gloria Steinem of Miss Magazine and the whole feminist movement admitting she worked for the CIA and the whole plan was to get women to work for the government and to basically end the family.
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:49.600]  They are so arrogant. They are so evil. This is all coming up in the next hour.
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:14:01.600]  Donald Trump's new world order puts nation over globe. Trump challenge the world order. Trump's new world disorder. Will Trump be the end of the Pax Americana?
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:15.600]  Trump's taking off the spells end of the world for 20th century German FM Steinmeier, the end of liberal world order. The liberal world order? I saw this weekend going. It's the end of the liberal world order.
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:31.600]  China will save it. He'll save the democratic order as the Chinese president spoke at Davos. China's unelected. China enslaves its people. Trump was elected.
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:44.600]  Their world government's anti-human, anti-nation state, anti-prosperity. Let me tell you what Russia's involved in. Russia kicked the oligarchs out about 17 years ago and I wasn't sure if it was real for a while.
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:55.600]  They were teaching Christianity and family and paying people to have kids and paying people to not eat GMO and they say they're stopping the vaccines and they're going to be the world distributor of non-GMO food.
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:05.600]  And the light came back in the Russians' eyes all of a sudden. That was an example of the world. I was already doing this before Russia did it. But they didn't get it from me. They just were rediscovering their humanity.
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:20.600]  And now Trump and everybody else and Brexit and Spain and Italy pulling out of the Euro. It's happening everywhere. They're in crisis because their world government was admittedly about austerity and starving people and eugenics and anti-human.
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:31.600]  And it was a breakaway civilization where they steal all the treasure of humanity and give it to themselves, not us.
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:41.600]  So does Trump take me serious? When his top advisors, his generals, unanimous listeners, he damn well he does. But his discernment spirit already believes it and knows it and loves it.
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:50.600]  So people ask why I talk to Donald Trump. Talk to him every day. Right here on the air. So get that through your heads, folks. We're freaking out, yeah.
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:16:15.600]  We talk to Donald Trump, the president, every day, and you too.

[02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:33.600]  So, don't believe me. Just listen to Trump's speech.
[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:41.600]  We're about to discover the keys to ending disease and death. The keys to hell and death.
[02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:48.600]  All of it now manifesting. We're about to discover the secrets of energy in the universe and space travel.
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:53.600]  Look at his face. He just looks happy but disgusting as he's getting the briefings.
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:57.600]  Everything he was already told by the top generals and the patriots, sir, we've got everything.
[02:20:57.600 --> 02:21:00.600]  They've already got it. They don't know how to deliver it to people.
[02:21:00.600 --> 02:21:04.600]  Well, the answer is export the excess population to space.
[02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:07.600]  Give people the technology. Give them the life extension.
[02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:12.600]  Let them know how magic the universe is. Don't keep them diverted with a bunch of NFL and fake culture.
[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:18.600]  You've artificially fed them. Put wind into humanity's sails.
[02:21:18.600 --> 02:21:23.600]  And America is not going to just shrink away and not be strong. We're going to be stronger than ever.
[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:26.600]  We've been used to empower the world government.
[02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:30.600]  Let me actually start getting to the speech. It'll take the rest of the hour to get to.
[02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:33.600]  And then the next hour, guess who was funding?
[02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:37.600]  I mean, I already knew this as I checked a few of the groups. I didn't know...
[02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:42.600]  I didn't know that 40 of the 52 groups were Soros funded. I said it was obviously Soros.
[02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:50.600]  A bunch of women in little pink, purple, color-revolution hats, screaming,
[02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:54.600]  F-U, white, male, Alex Jones, go to hell, hope you die.
[02:21:54.600 --> 02:22:00.600]  And then saying, but we love you, love Trump's hate.
[02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:06.600]  And I'm sorry, I said 40 for memory. It's 50 partners of the Women's March on Washington, which is almost every group.
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:09.600]  The other major group is funded by the Islamic jihad.
[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:16.600]  And I saw all these women, including American women, Hispanic, black, white, Ian Hajib saying,
[02:22:16.600 --> 02:22:22.600]  this is how we empower women. You're bullying Muslims. We're going to put hoods on and go under Islam.
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:26.600]  Talk about being cuckold. Talk about Stockholm syndrome.
[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:31.600]  Women's March organizer recently met ex-Hamas operative, family as ties of terror group.
[02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:36.600]  Yeah, the leader of it is a woman that promotes, just like Uma Abadi's mother did, genital mutilation.
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:40.600]  She's the leading person pushing it.
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:45.600]  And that's how women are empowered as wearing hoods, not being able to drive cars, being stoned to death
[02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:48.600]  if they go outside and don't follow their husband's orders.
[02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:55.600]  And I'd bring this up to them. We have a clip coming up next hour where one of our reporters brings it up.
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:59.600]  And the women go, that's a lie. Trump was funded by Saudi Arabia.
[02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:04.600]  Trump got zero money from Saudi Arabia, zero money from Goldman Sachs, zero money from the big globalists.
[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:12.600]  But it doesn't matter. They should scream and spit at us and say he did.
[02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:17.600]  And it's just a bunch of weird corporate-owned, I mean, I love drudgereport.com. Can we punch that up?
[02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:24.600]  I'm a woman, hear me roar. It's glorious style. I've had a bunch of kids, but she says you shouldn't have a kid.
[02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:27.600]  She's proud of abortion, says that's how you prove your woman's kill your baby.
[02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:30.600]  I'm not attacking you if you had abortion. The point is she makes it a sacrament.
[02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:37.600]  And then she's admittedly CIA funded to break up the family, turn men into betas, and make us easy to assimilate.
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:44.600]  And she admits that in a book she wrote and interviews, and there she is out there smiling with her victims.
[02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:50.600]  This is how you kill cultures in society. This isn't my opinion. This is declassified.
[02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:57.600]  It's all coming up in a second hour. But let's start with the beginning.
[02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:04.600]  Let's start with the beginning of the speech with a star-spangled banner because I was watching the Jumbotron,
[02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:09.600]  because I couldn't see the Obama's. They were kind of back because I was so close. I was looking up at the podium.
[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:14.600]  I could only see people who were up speaking at it. There was just the top of Donald's head.
[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:21.600]  I could see the rabbi and the preachers, you know, just the top of them. I could see them on the Jumbotron.
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:29.600]  And they just looked so pissed off the whole time. And so entitled because they never worked for this.
[02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:36.600]  They were just given it as minions of this corporate takeover.
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:40.600]  America on its deathbed finally awakened to globalism and said no to it.
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:44.600]  And you could feel the title resistance surging. They're so scared.
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:49.600]  So let's just play the intro and him being nice. But I love how he wrote this himself.
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:56.600]  No president since Kennedy has written a speech himself. They admit this. I love it.
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:20.600]  Music
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:27.600]  Again, there's also a Star Spangled Banner. We're going to play later. A lot of stations cut away from that.
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:32.600]  Music
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:37.600]  So again, here they are singing.
[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:50.600]  Talking about America the Free.
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:53.600]  Here they are singing America the Free.
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:58.600]  And then Trump comes up and he says, oh, you've done an exceptional job. Yeah, raping the country.
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:03.600]  But now all that is. And then he gets into the real meat and potatoes.
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:14.600]  And there aren't words to describe how ultra, how ultra over the top cool this is.
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:21.600]  Everything he says is dialed into truth. It countermands how America was used to build the tyrannical world government.
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:29.600]  It was designed to fall after it was set up with all this internal strife and racial strife and strife in the family.
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:34.600]  And all of that against declassified. All that is admitted. My film Endgame breaks it down.
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:37.600]  The plan to break down the family. The plan to turn this against each other.
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:41.600]  The plan to say, don't say you have a mother and father. Somebody else might not have it.
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:48.600]  The plan to destroy free speech. America's not perfect, but the ideal of it changed the world, empowered the planet,
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:53.600]  invented most of the technologies we have. Because the idea of empowering humanity and innovation.
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:59.600]  The American dream just being 10% realized. Created the modern world we have.
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:04.600]  And then it was hijacked. And turned into a system of total control.
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:11.600]  And the technologies were hidden. They were twisted. They were given to people like the smart phones and other things.
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:22.600]  With back doors and Trojan horse control systems. Think about that.
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:26.600]  And they dumb the public down to where they say, he's rich. He wants to be poor.
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:31.600]  No, America's about wealth and empowerment and individual liberty and free association.
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:38.600]  And that creates incredible wealth. The problem is it then creates a decadence.
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:43.600]  Now, they come back from break. We're going to go right to Trump's speech.
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:48.600]  And I'm even going to skip the part at the intro to it.
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:52.600]  He says she chefs Roberts and Carter and Clinton and all the rest of them.
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:58.600]  We the citizens of America are now joining a great nation effort to build our country and restore its promise for all our people.
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:02.600]  Together we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come. That's true.
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:09.600]  We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:16.600]  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transition of power.
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:25.600]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious and throughout the transition.
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:31.600]  They have been magnificent. Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:37.600]  We're going to start there, there. When we come back on the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:43.600]  This is the Info War. We're breaking down the secrets that are now being revealed of the real national treasure.

[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:31.600]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:39.600]  Just go to infowarstore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:46.600]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:31:46.600 --> 02:31:51.600]  10% off on auto ship. Win, win, win at infowarslife.com. Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:56.600]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:31:56.600 --> 02:32:01.600]  Introducing fluorolife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by infowarslife.
[02:32:01.600 --> 02:32:06.600]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:15.600]  Fluorolife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:24.600]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:31.600]  Fluorolife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:35.600]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:40.600]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[02:32:40.600 --> 02:32:47.600]  It's sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[02:32:47.600 --> 02:33:16.600]  Head to infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of fluorolife probiotics today. That's infowarslife.com.
[02:33:17.600 --> 02:33:37.600]  Well, Foxconn has the slaves. Nets, the suicide nets, is an ounce that they're going to build factories in the U.S.
[02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:40.600]  There won't be slaves there, obviously. That's under Trump.
[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:59.600]  All those other big companies are announcing they're coming here as this accelerates. President Trump has declared a new Declaration of Independence for America against the multinational, unelected corporations that have set up a world where it's acceptable for China to have slave factories and have us buy goods.
[02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:12.600]  Or it's acceptable for Obama to open up the borders and let people with TB, syphilis, gonorrhea, every other disease you can imagine, even wet leprosy to come into America.
[02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:16.600]  These globalists are very evil and they look like demons being exercised yesterday.
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:29.600]  So let's go into John Roberts administering the oath. Let's go into what happened and then it'll go a little bit of the next hour. I want to start really just getting to this historic speech. I'm just going to write notes here and then have brief comments to analysis.
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:37.600]  But in the next few days, I'm going to shoot a special report where I break down and decode the larger meanings of what Trump's saying.
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:46.600]  A lot of it's very, very boilerplate. I mean, it's very, very clear. We're going to release the secret technologies, the life extension. We're going to harness the secrets of the universe.
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:35:03.600]  We're going to have America lead by freedom again, not by control. So this isn't America relinquishing control. This is America recognizing and helping dismantle a corrupt world government, a corporate world government that's been set up that we've been used to create.
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:18.600]  So this is America getting redemption back from the crimes that we've been used to basically commit. This is incredible. And only Donald Trump can write this. He wrote this speech admittedly himself. They made fun of him for it.
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:27.600]  As if a president couldn't write his own speech. Donald Trump is a godsend, ladies and gentlemen. Let's go to a swearing end. Here it is.
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:39.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's an honor to introduce the Chief Justice of the United States, John G. Roberts Jr., who will administer the presidential oath of office. Everyone please stand.
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:36:08.600]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:34.600]  That I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:38.600]  So help me God. So help me God. Congratulations, Mr. President.
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:17.600]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:38.600]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:59.600]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:09.600]  And again, folks, I've heard a lot of this already on the show. We don't have time to ask why was there so much of this influence. It's not an influence. It's Americana. Here's President 45, now President.
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:22.600]  Said it couldn't happen, but two years ago it was going to happen.
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:31.600]  He's just as Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama.
[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:37.600]  He does this just to be classy. He knows their enemies. And people of the world, thank you.
[02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:42.600]  But he knows they're a public somewhat brainwashed joke, so he wants to diffuse things as they're creating division.
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:57.600]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:15.600]  And we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:33.600]  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power. And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:45.600]  The truth is they didn't burn Hillary. They have been magnificent. It was Hillary and Soros fighting. Obama actually set it out. I don't want to give him credit, but I'm going to let you know the inside until Obama backed off. Keep going.
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:57.600]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another.
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:08.600]  Or from one party to another. But we are transferring power from Washington D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:16.600]  These people folks, this is Americana Reboot. You are witnessing history. Unbelievable.
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:28.600]  Too long a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.
[02:40:28.600 --> 02:40:43.600]  Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed.
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:57.600]  The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:09.600]  And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:14.600]  Unlimited welfare is the technology. Folks, we don't have anything.
[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:25.600]  That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you.
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:32.600]  Not the state, but the people. You just did it. You did this. Folks, they've got actuaries.
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:43.600]  It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration.
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:49.600]  And this, the United States of America, is your country.
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:55.600]  That's right. The globalists in Concord America, they had hijacked it. We now have peacefully had a counter to and restored it.
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:42:05.600]  What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:13.600]  Back it up. Ten seconds when we come back, we'll continue there. It just gets more epic if you know what you're hearing.
[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:18.600]  For the first time ever, this isn't about parties. This is about who controls the government.
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:25.600]  It's about do they stand with the people and prosperity in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution? What do they actually do instead of a bunch of end fighting?
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:33.600]  And then he goes into racially coming together. And by the way, the Trump plans public. They just always took it out of context.
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:39.600]  I've met people that have been here 20 years legally that can't become citizens because the Republicans and Democrats made it almost impossible.
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:45.600]  They want you illegal, poor as a new permanent underclass who they control. No, no, no.
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:51.600]  Under Trump, you don't have a criminal record. You're hardworking. No matter what color you are, you're here a year or so to work hard.
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:55.600]  You do good stuff. Boom. Boom, you're right in. You're a felon.
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:43:09.600]  We have developed with the top firms in the United States powerful 50 billion live organism probiotic fluorolive that is so critical to having a healthy gut and a healthy life.
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:22.600]  And that has changed my life and so many other people's lives. The other part is a compound like my cozy X that has all these key ingredients of organic herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.

[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:10.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:18.600]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:24.600]  Look, the enemy media has already figured out that we can see for thousands of miles.
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:31.600]  They've already figured out that we're not playing games.
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:34.600]  Keep it rolling for a minute.
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:47.600]  We can see for miles and miles and miles and miles.
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:52.600]  I mean, this show's not talk, folks. It's a real deal. This is Americana.
[02:47:52.600 --> 02:48:02.600]  I can't believe how honored I am to be 100% Americana and to be in the zeitgeist and to be part of the plan to launch humanity to the stars.
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:04.600]  I got goodwill.
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:08.600]  I want to empower you. I don't want to put you down so I can rule over you.
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:14.600]  I don't have a competition in me that if somebody else is doing well, I want to destroy them.
[02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:18.600]  I want you to do well as long as it's not at my expense.
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:25.600]  And with the large yes in the non-zero sum game, the 360 win, as I call it, that we have with technology, it's there.
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:31.600]  In fact, there's more than you could ever imagine or want to do with what the species can do.
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:38.600]  Look how far we've come from the fire and the wheel, the spacecraft, and all the medicine we have.
[02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:43.600]  And the biggest thing from his speech is America's ideas and culture.
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:46.600]  That's what's going to make us dominate worldwide.
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:51.600]  But in free trade and openness, globalism is all about making people poor.
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:54.600]  Nico was just telling me, he said, hey, boss, you know, you skip a lot of breaks.
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:57.600]  You never plug anything. Network's the ones that run all the ads.
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:01.600]  You never plug something. Yeah, we're running a special that ends today.
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:05.600]  We've been running since Christmas. We extended it to call it the inauguration special.

[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:37.600]  You know what the crazy part about
[02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:41.600]  meeting people in the military who are big
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:45.600]  listeners and fight for this country and fighting for Trump is that they don't
[02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:49.600]  even tell you don't talk about it.
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:53.600]  And then you just, it's so crazy that you can't even tell
[02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:57.600]  people. I mean, some of it got caught on tape when I was in DC, but
[02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:01.600]  one guy, he looked like the Flash. Or who's the guy
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:05.600]  that's real fast? It was like Ant-Man, but who's the Flash?
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:09.600]  It's like this guy's attacking me and all of a sudden people are like, is that real?
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:13.600]  Boom, knock this guy down. And then it's like
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:17.600]  it's like, is that even real?
[02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:21.600]  Like, oh, we're just here to help you protect you because this is a threat against you.
[02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:25.600]  And then after they leave, like, you know that was like, no, I don't know. Well, that's
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:29.600]  just like, it's like...
[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:33.600]  They are hitting this with polonium and killing people though every day. I mean, so
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:37.600]  to actually watch the real American government come in, like, Alex,
[02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:41.600]  you're crazy enough to come down here, watch what happens, and then boom, it's like
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:45.600]  I mean, I'm a tough guy. Okay.
[02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:49.600]  These guys would probably kick my ass in about 30 seconds.
[02:50:49.600 --> 02:50:53.600]  It's just so crazy to be in the heart of the American dream now.
[02:50:53.600 --> 02:50:57.600]  And it's so real. Everybody can feel it and see it.
[02:50:57.600 --> 02:51:01.600]  I gotta get to this because Lance come up in about 20 minutes.
[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:05.600]  There's like 13 minutes left to his speech. It's so epic. Let's air some more of this
[02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:09.600]  and I'll try to limit my comments, but this is such an amazing time to be alive. Here's Trump
[02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:13.600]  being inaugurated 48 hours ago right there in the District of Criminals
[02:51:13.600 --> 02:51:17.600]  as he turns the tide.
[02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:21.600]  What truly matters is not which party controls our
[02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:25.600]  government, but whether our government is controlled
[02:51:25.600 --> 02:51:29.600]  by the people. That's it. For the people.
[02:51:29.600 --> 02:51:33.600]  You've never heard that. January 20th
[02:51:33.600 --> 02:51:37.600]  2017 will be remembered as the day
[02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:41.600]  the people became the rulers of this nation
[02:51:41.600 --> 02:51:45.600]  again. Paul, let's back it up.
[02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:49.600]  January 20th is the new July 4th. If we deliver on
[02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:53.600]  this, if this happens, if we're moral and good and work hard and do this
[02:51:53.600 --> 02:51:57.600]  in 100 years, it will be celebrated as bigger than July 4th.
[02:51:57.600 --> 02:52:01.600]  It's a fact. But Trump is doing this selfishly. He loves his kids,
[02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:05.600]  his grandkids and the kids that come after that. He understands the continuum.
[02:52:05.600 --> 02:52:09.600]  He understands how big
[02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:13.600]  this is and that globalism is designed to make us poor.
[02:52:13.600 --> 02:52:17.600]  All we gotta do is turn that off. It's not that he's even perfect.
[02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:21.600]  Again, Donald Trump, mark this down, is not out to get you.
[02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:25.600]  And he has a vision and he loves America
[02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:29.600]  and he knows about the secret destiny, which in days to come I'll lay out fully.
[02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:33.600]  But believe me folks, life extension technologies alone
[02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:37.600]  saying we have them, we're gonna give them to you. That's come up in a moment.
[02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:41.600]  Yes, people that own chemotherapy patents are not gonna make any more money.
[02:52:41.600 --> 02:52:45.600]  They've already made hundreds of billions, shut up.
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:49.600]  They're like, well, what do we do when people can live to 200? It's gonna happen.
[02:52:49.600 --> 02:52:53.600]  We'll figure it out, okay? But then we won't be in control of it. I mean, the public, a bunch of dumbasses
[02:52:53.600 --> 02:52:57.600]  we can't give it to them. You made them dumb. How about you
[02:52:57.600 --> 02:53:01.600]  die? I don't want to kill you. But stop saying we gotta die.
[02:53:01.600 --> 02:53:05.600]  We're gonna get some of this dirt, dammit.
[02:53:05.600 --> 02:53:09.600]  We built it. We made it. Stop it.
[02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:13.600]  Africa should be jewels. Those are strong good people. They've been suppressed.
[02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:17.600]  Never got off from under colonialism. We're gonna end that.
[02:53:17.600 --> 02:53:21.600]  And you turn loose the super storm of human potential. I don't care what color you are.
[02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:25.600]  That spirit's right. I mean, I'm gonna be honest with you.
[02:53:25.600 --> 02:53:29.600]  Just because I don't want to be condescending like, oh, I like gay people or I like
[02:53:29.600 --> 02:53:33.600]  black people. Oh, really? Some of your best friends, I was out there and there were
[02:53:33.600 --> 02:53:37.600]  Indians and black people and Hispanics and people coming up to speak on the microphone.
[02:53:37.600 --> 02:53:41.600]  All these live feeds that were so eloquent. Their spirits were so strong that I didn't
[02:53:41.600 --> 02:53:45.600]  feel weak that I was next to the spirit so strong. I felt good like, oh, thank God
[02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:49.600]  there's people out there that get it. I just love them so much.
[02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:53.600]  And it didn't matter what color their skin was, even though, quite frankly, I try to get the best
[02:53:53.600 --> 02:53:57.600]  tan I can get. I thought their dark skin looked great. The point was is I love them as fellow
[02:53:57.600 --> 02:54:01.600]  humans and they were my brothers and sisters because they got it. And most of the people
[02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:05.600]  I saw that were minorities, they totally understood it and rejected
[02:54:05.600 --> 02:54:09.600]  it from the Kenyan driver of my SUV back to the airport to
[02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:13.600]  the Mexican driver that picked me up to everybody I met. It was like they were
[02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:17.600]  free. But let me tell you, if I saw some black man or Hispanic or whatever person
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:21.600]  who looked good and was strong and had strength and had
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:25.600]  light in their eyes, I knew before I talked to them they loved me or agree with me.
[02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:29.600]  But if I saw somebody who looked like their soul been sucked out, they hated me. It's spiritual.
[02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:33.600]  It's what's in our hearts and what's in these people's hearts that love God
[02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:37.600]  and Liberty is the same as mine, the same as in Trump. He feels it. He wants
[02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:41.600]  to be the one that delivers us. He wants to be the new
[02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:45.600]  Moses. He wants to do it.
[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:49.600]  And I don't even want to sit here and say this, but the truth's the truth. Donald Trump's
[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:53.600]  so good, ladies and gentlemen, that I don't even know if we deserve
[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:57.600]  him. He is so fricking strong. He's so high on the spirit. He
[02:54:57.600 --> 02:55:01.600]  works 20 hours a day without even
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:05.600]  working. And he can't stop working. And he just sees
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:09.600]  it's incredible. He's a modern prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:09.600 --> 02:55:13.600]  We'll have a few minutes to break. I'm going to go as long as I have to to finish this
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:17.600]  before Leanne comes in. Let's just go back to it. Here it is.
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:21.600]  January 20th,
[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:25.600]  2017 will be remembered
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:29.600]  as the day the people became the rulers
[02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:33.600]  of this nation again. July 4th.
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:37.600]  True collectivism, our will together.
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:41.600]  The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:45.600]  no longer. They've turned us against each other so we don't join
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:49.600]  wills together. See, they have a false collectivism.
[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:53.600]  You can't buy the tens of millions to become part of a
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:57.600]  historic movement, the likes of which the world
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:01.600]  has never seen before. You back Trump, you go to the stars.
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:05.600]  You don't genocide and death. And the elite are crazy to merge with computers.
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:09.600]  This movement is a crucial conviction
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:13.600]  that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:17.600]  Americans want great schools for their children,
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:21.600]  safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:25.600]  for themselves. These
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:29.600]  are just and reasonable
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:33.600]  demands of righteous people.
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:37.600]  You're going to give it to us. Too many of our citizens a different
[02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:41.600]  reality exists. Mothers and children trapped
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:45.600]  in poverty in our inner cities. Rusted out factories
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:49.600]  scattered like tombstones across the landscape
[02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:53.600]  of our nation. An education system
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:57.600]  flush with cash but which leaves our young
[02:56:57.600 --> 02:57:01.600]  and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge
[02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:05.600]  and the crime and the gangs
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:09.600]  and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed
[02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:13.600]  our country of so much unrealized potential.
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:17.600]  This American carnage
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:21.600]  stops right here and stops
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:25.600]  right now. See sounds like talk but if you invoke it
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:29.600]  you will have it. He knows he says you have the power. I need you
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:33.600]  to step into your destiny. We are one nation
[02:57:33.600 --> 02:57:37.600]  and they're one nation. They keep saying divide, divide that we're dividing.
[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:41.600]  We'll be back folks. I'm going to do two more segments
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:45.600]  to play this. He's getting into the suppressed technologies next.
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:49.600]  I want to plow into all of this. Then I'm going to spend a few minutes
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:53.600]  here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:57.600]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems

[02:58:59.600 --> 02:59:03.600]  fantastic and that really is a great way to deal with this battle
[02:59:03.600 --> 02:59:07.600]  in the info war. It might seem like a simple thing but particularly
[02:59:07.600 --> 02:59:11.600]  the slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely
[02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:15.600]  amazing. Well thank you my favorite new one is the

[02:59:19.600 --> 02:59:23.600]  Gadsden snake and then it's got the American flag Infowars.com on the right arm
[02:59:23.600 --> 02:59:27.600]  I mean that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread
[02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:31.600]  the word and also exercise free speech and the newest one is

[02:59:43.600 --> 02:59:47.600]  at info wars.com
[02:59:47.600 --> 02:59:51.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:59:51.600 --> 02:59:55.600]  from
[02:59:55.600 --> 02:59:59.600]  the front lines of the information war
[02:59:59.600 --> 03:00:03.600]  it's Alex Jones watch me
[03:00:03.600 --> 03:00:07.600]  I got something

[03:00:19.600 --> 03:00:23.600]  I got something I'm super bad
[03:00:23.600 --> 03:00:27.600]  I got something that tells me what it's all about
[03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:31.600]  I'm super bad
[03:00:31.600 --> 03:00:35.600]  I'm so good
[03:00:35.600 --> 03:00:39.600]  I got a move that tells me what to do
[03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:43.600]  I got a move that tells me what to do
[03:00:43.600 --> 03:00:47.600]  I think Trump's got a move that tells him what to do and he knows a devil when he sees it
[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:51.600]  devil doesn't want you to do good wants to trick you wants to run your life
[03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:55.600]  God wants to empower you and see you grow let's go back to the epic speech
[03:00:55.600 --> 03:00:59.600]  of President Trump here it is
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:03.600]  we are one nation and their pain is our pain
[03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:07.600]  their dreams are our dreams and their success
[03:01:07.600 --> 03:01:11.600]  will be our success all connected
[03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:15.600]  we share one heart one home and one
[03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:19.600]  glorious destiny now that's the key
[03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:23.600]  the oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance
[03:01:23.600 --> 03:01:27.600]  to all Americans
[03:01:27.600 --> 03:01:31.600]  for many decades
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:35.600]  this oath of office is an allegiance to you
[03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:39.600]  I'm no president this is it
[03:01:39.600 --> 03:01:43.600]  that's what he tells you personally and on air I'm not going to let you down
[03:01:43.600 --> 03:01:47.600]  I'm fully committed to you I'm going to do the best I can and he doesn't
[03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:51.600]  and I can't believe how dumb the leftists were out on the trail they don't think Trump brought any jobs back
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:55.600]  when he was president elect he was already doing it let's go back
[03:01:55.600 --> 03:01:59.600]  we reached foreign industry at the expense of American
[03:01:59.600 --> 03:02:03.600]  industry subsidized the armies of other countries
[03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:07.600]  while allowing for the very sad depletion of our
[03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:11.600]  military we've defended other nations
[03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:15.600]  borders while refusing to defend our
[03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:19.600]  own
[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:23.600]  and spent trillions
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:27.600]  of dollars overseas while America's
[03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:31.600]  infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:35.600]  decay we've made other countries rich
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:39.600]  while the wealth strength and confidence
[03:02:39.600 --> 03:02:43.600]  of our country has dissipated over
[03:02:43.600 --> 03:02:47.600]  the horizon one by one
[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:51.600]  the factory shuttered and left our shores
[03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:55.600]  with not even a thought about the millions and
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:02:59.600]  millions of American workers that were left behind
[03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:03.600]  the wealth of our middle class has been
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:07.600]  ripped from their homes and then redistributed
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:11.600]  all across the world
[03:03:11.600 --> 03:03:15.600]  but that is the past and now
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:19.600]  we are looking only to the future
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:23.600]  which means build ourselves up be independent then help others
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:27.600]  not have capitulation dictated to us
[03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:31.600]  we assembled here today are issuing a new
[03:03:31.600 --> 03:03:35.600]  decree to be heard in every city in every foreign
[03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:39.600]  capital and in every hall of power
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:43.600]  from this day forward a new vision will
[03:03:43.600 --> 03:03:47.600]  govern our land from this day forward
[03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:51.600]  it's going to be only America
[03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:55.600]  first America first
[03:03:55.600 --> 03:03:59.600]  it means humanity first
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:03.600]  every decision on trade
[03:04:03.600 --> 03:04:07.600]  on taxes on immigration on foreign
[03:04:07.600 --> 03:04:11.600]  affairs will be made to benefit American workers
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:15.600]  and American families we must protect our borders
[03:04:15.600 --> 03:04:19.600]  from the ravages of other countries
[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:23.600]  making our products, stealing our companies and destroying
[03:04:23.600 --> 03:04:27.600]  our jobs
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:31.600]  alright we're going to come back

[03:04:39.600 --> 03:04:43.600]  are openly run by the CIA that's hijacked by foreign powers
[03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:47.600]  whether Trump clean up the CIA or will he fail
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:51.600]  all the Zimors trade ahead do you want the cancer cures

[03:06:23.600 --> 03:06:25.600]  we'll soon see the end of the globalist
[03:06:25.600 --> 03:06:29.600]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States
[03:06:29.600 --> 03:06:31.600]  it's not true
[03:06:31.600 --> 03:06:33.600]  that's impossible
[03:06:33.600 --> 03:06:37.600]  search the things who know it to be true
[03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:59.600]  this is the heart of 1776
[03:06:59.600 --> 03:07:03.600]  it's also what happens when you
[03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:07.600]  listen to the radio host Alex Jones
[03:07:07.600 --> 03:07:11.600]  move bitch get out the way
[03:07:11.600 --> 03:07:17.600]  we pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag
[03:07:17.600 --> 03:07:21.600]  info wars help to fuel the rumor that president Obama is an ISIS support
[03:07:21.600 --> 03:07:25.600]  it's been a cozy relationship from the beginning
[03:07:25.600 --> 03:07:29.600]  I will not let you down you'll be very very impressed I hope
[03:07:29.600 --> 03:07:33.600]  and I think we'll be speaking alive
[03:07:33.600 --> 03:07:39.600]  this means that Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States
[03:07:39.600 --> 03:07:41.600]  Waging war on corruption
[03:07:41.600 --> 03:07:45.600]  it's Alex Jones
[03:07:45.600 --> 03:07:49.600]  well folks we are impressed with Donald Trump and what he's done
[03:07:49.600 --> 03:07:53.600]  he's a pro-human pro-liberty
[03:07:53.600 --> 03:07:57.600]  president and right as world government was openly being announced
[03:07:57.600 --> 03:08:01.600]  like a phoenix under the fire of hell
[03:08:01.600 --> 03:08:05.600]  our republic is rising again
[03:08:05.600 --> 03:08:09.600]  I want to finish up with his historic inaugural speech
[03:08:09.600 --> 03:08:13.600]  January 20th Friday 2017
[03:08:13.600 --> 03:08:17.600]  we're going to come back and get into the globalist counter-offensive
[03:08:17.600 --> 03:08:21.600]  how they hope to enslave humanity but he gets to the key points here about
[03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:25.600]  life extension technology and other technologies that are going to be deployed to the public
[03:08:25.600 --> 03:08:29.600]  I can tell you many of these are suppressed
[03:08:29.600 --> 03:08:33.600]  they're seen as disruptive and it will be disruptive when people can easily live to 200
[03:08:33.600 --> 03:08:37.600]  but that's the big secret let's go to it
[03:08:41.600 --> 03:08:45.600]  every decision on trade
[03:08:45.600 --> 03:08:49.600]  on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs
[03:08:49.600 --> 03:08:53.600]  will be made to benefit American workers
[03:08:53.600 --> 03:08:57.600]  and American families
[03:08:57.600 --> 03:09:01.600]  we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:05.600]  making our products, stealing our companies
[03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:09.600]  and destroying our jobs
[03:09:13.600 --> 03:09:17.600]  protection will lead to great prosperity and strength
[03:09:17.600 --> 03:09:21.600]  I will fight for you
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:25.600]  the wealth in my body
[03:09:25.600 --> 03:09:29.600]  and I will never ever let you down
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:37.600]  America will start winning again
[03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:41.600]  winning like never before
[03:09:41.600 --> 03:09:45.600]  we will bring back our jobs
[03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:49.600]  we will bring back our borders
[03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:53.600]  and we will bring back our dreams
[03:09:59.600 --> 03:10:03.600]  we will build new roads and highways and bridges
[03:10:03.600 --> 03:10:07.600]  and airports and tunnels and railways
[03:10:07.600 --> 03:10:11.600]  all across our wonderful nation
[03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:15.600]  we will get our people off of welfare and back to work
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:19.600]  rebuilding our country with American hands
[03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:23.600]  and American labor
[03:10:23.600 --> 03:10:27.600]  we will sabotage
[03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:31.600]  we will follow two simple rules
[03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:35.600]  buy American and hire American
[03:10:35.600 --> 03:10:39.600]  we will seek friendship and goodwill
[03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:43.600]  with the nations of the world
[03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:47.600]  with the understanding that it is the right of all nations
[03:10:47.600 --> 03:10:51.600]  to put their own interests first
[03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:55.600]  we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone
[03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:59.600]  but rather to let it shine as an example
[03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:03.600]  we will shine for everyone to follow
[03:11:03.600 --> 03:11:07.600]  America didn't need to take over them, he had the best
[03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:11.600]  we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones
[03:11:11.600 --> 03:11:15.600]  with the civilized world against radical Islamic
[03:11:15.600 --> 03:11:19.600]  terrorism which we will eradicate completely
[03:11:19.600 --> 03:11:23.600]  from the face of the earth
[03:11:23.600 --> 03:11:27.600]  huge, the left is totally allied with it, I was there
[03:11:27.600 --> 03:11:31.600]  the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance
[03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:35.600]  to the United States of America and through our loyalty
[03:11:35.600 --> 03:11:39.600]  to our country we will rediscover our loyalty
[03:11:39.600 --> 03:11:43.600]  to each other, that's right
[03:11:43.600 --> 03:11:47.600]  when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room
[03:11:47.600 --> 03:11:51.600]  for prejudice, that's right
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:55.600]  just because the left is anti-white stuff, people need to not buy into that
[03:11:55.600 --> 03:11:59.600]  you want these people to win, you better come together
[03:11:59.600 --> 03:12:03.600]  the Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is
[03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:07.600]  when God's people live together in unity
[03:12:07.600 --> 03:12:11.600]  openly, debate our disagreements honestly
[03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:15.600]  in different ways, pursue solidarity
[03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:19.600]  when America is united, America is totally unstoppable
[03:12:19.600 --> 03:12:23.600]  that's right, I thought I hated it
[03:12:23.600 --> 03:12:27.600]  come together for prosperity and treat people good, just be nice
[03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:31.600]  and stop being a bunch of people, there should be no fear, we are protected
[03:12:31.600 --> 03:12:35.600]  and we will always be protected
[03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:39.600]  by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement
[03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:43.600]  and most importantly
[03:12:43.600 --> 03:12:47.600]  we will be protected by God
[03:12:47.600 --> 03:12:51.600]  Keith, brought God back in, and I ask God for the protection
[03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:55.600]  he just did it
[03:12:55.600 --> 03:12:59.600]  finally, we must think big and dream even bigger
[03:12:59.600 --> 03:13:03.600]  in America we understand that a nation is only living
[03:13:03.600 --> 03:13:07.600]  as long as it is striving
[03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:11.600]  we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk
[03:13:11.600 --> 03:13:15.600]  and no action, constantly complaining but never doing
[03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:19.600]  anything about it
[03:13:19.600 --> 03:13:23.600]  you deliver, you don't get more power when you screw up
[03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:27.600]  the time for empty talk
[03:13:27.600 --> 03:13:31.600]  is over, now arrives the hour
[03:13:31.600 --> 03:13:35.600]  of action
[03:13:35.600 --> 03:13:39.600]  we have the power, humans can do anything
[03:13:39.600 --> 03:13:43.600]  do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done
[03:13:43.600 --> 03:13:47.600]  no challenge can match the heart
[03:13:47.600 --> 03:13:51.600]  the secrets of the atom will not fail
[03:13:51.600 --> 03:13:55.600]  our country will thrive and prosper again
[03:13:55.600 --> 03:13:59.600]  we stand at the birth of a little millennium
[03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:03.600]  ready to unlock the mysteries of space
[03:14:03.600 --> 03:14:07.600]  to free the earth from the miseries of disease
[03:14:07.600 --> 03:14:11.600]  and to harness the energies, industries and technologies
[03:14:11.600 --> 03:14:15.600]  of tomorrow
[03:14:15.600 --> 03:14:19.600]  back it up ten seconds, I'm going to come back finish it and go to the heavenly end
[03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:23.600]  and for the rest to get into the counters track against all this with the brainwashing of women
[03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:27.600]  and turning the species against itself, that's how you kill fire ants or anything else
[03:14:27.600 --> 03:14:31.600]  we're going to, in the ravages of disease
[03:14:31.600 --> 03:14:35.600]  we've already done it, folks they already have it, it's admitted
[03:14:35.600 --> 03:14:39.600]  it's in major white papers, not 100% cures but in general
[03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:43.600]  they've got it all, they're suppressing a ton of stuff
[03:14:43.600 --> 03:14:47.600]  back it up 15 seconds, I'll be able to hear this again
[03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:51.600]  and Trump wants you to have that, he doesn't want to just go to Switzerland and get it for himself
[03:14:51.600 --> 03:14:55.600]  because he feels like crap getting that when you don't get it, like the Queen of England does
[03:14:55.600 --> 03:14:59.600]  he's like okay so well there's about too many people, we'll just figure it out and do something in space
[03:14:59.600 --> 03:15:03.600]  we're not going to do this, so let's go out to break, here's President Trump
[03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:07.600]  he's now president, I told you he'd be president, we will not fail
[03:15:07.600 --> 03:15:11.600]  our country will thrive and prosper again
[03:15:11.600 --> 03:15:15.600]  we stand at the birth of a little millennium
[03:15:15.600 --> 03:15:19.600]  ready to unlock the mysteries of space
[03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:23.600]  to free the earth from the miseries of disease
[03:15:23.600 --> 03:15:27.600]  to harness the energies, industries and technologies
[03:15:27.600 --> 03:15:31.600]  of tomorrow, a new national pride
[03:15:31.600 --> 03:15:35.600]  will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our
[03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:39.600]  division, it's time to remember that
[03:15:39.600 --> 03:15:43.600]  old wisdom, our soldiers will deliver this to everybody, America will fulfill

[03:20:09.600 --> 03:20:13.600]  the globalist great error is to believe that as they collapse

[03:20:17.600 --> 03:20:21.600]  the truth is humanity is coming down fast but we're miles above them

[03:20:29.600 --> 03:20:33.600]  Trump is delivering on every front getting more intense as he becomes president
[03:20:33.600 --> 03:20:37.600]  not selling out the constituents again there's so much wealth of the planet
[03:20:37.600 --> 03:20:41.600]  it's in all the big globalist books they admit it they want to make people poor
[03:20:41.600 --> 03:20:45.600]  it's their own admission and their argument is being wealthy
[03:20:45.600 --> 03:20:49.600]  hurts the earth no we just create clean versions of it which they're
[03:20:49.600 --> 03:20:53.600]  suppressing land market is about a drum of the balance of the hour looking at their
[03:20:53.600 --> 03:20:57.600]  counter strike against all this I was there but first let's finish up with president
[03:20:57.600 --> 03:21:01.600]  Trump's speech where he's breaking down unlocking the secrets of the universe
[03:21:01.600 --> 03:21:05.600]  which I can tell you my father at UT
[03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:09.600]  in high school in the plan to program in the mid 60s they had CD
[03:21:09.600 --> 03:21:13.600]  ROMs and computers we didn't see till the 80s they have suppressed
[03:21:13.600 --> 03:21:17.600]  technology 30 years behind Trump knows it he wants it rolled out
[03:21:17.600 --> 03:21:21.600]  to the public this is the biggest issue you want disclosure about all the secret
[03:21:21.600 --> 03:21:25.600]  technologies the rest of it they admit they're suppressing AI you name it
[03:21:25.600 --> 03:21:29.600]  no human world in future Donald Trump let me explain something people
[03:21:29.600 --> 03:21:33.600]  that's just Trump real saying this destroys the enemy
[03:21:33.600 --> 03:21:37.600]  the entire globalist program is against Trump right now and is in death
[03:21:37.600 --> 03:21:41.600]  throws they're panicking everywhere he got a standing ovation
[03:21:41.600 --> 03:21:45.600]  CIA CNN said the CIA hated him they said nobody
[03:21:45.600 --> 03:21:49.600]  showed up and showed a shot of the morning early before the gates open
[03:21:49.600 --> 03:21:53.600]  they said he took Martin Luther King's bust out and threw it the street it was right there
[03:21:53.600 --> 03:21:57.600]  they are freaking out I'll talk to you in a moment but here's the conclusion
[03:21:57.600 --> 03:22:01.600]  that it cannot be done no challenge
[03:22:01.600 --> 03:22:05.600]  can match the heart and fight and spirit of America
[03:22:05.600 --> 03:22:09.600]  we will not fail our country will
[03:22:09.600 --> 03:22:13.600]  thrive and prosper again
[03:22:13.600 --> 03:22:17.600]  we stand at the birth of a little millennium ready to
[03:22:17.600 --> 03:22:21.600]  unlock the mysteries of space to free the earth
[03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:25.600]  from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies
[03:22:25.600 --> 03:22:29.600]  industries and technologies of tomorrow
[03:22:29.600 --> 03:22:33.600]  a new national pride will stir ourselves
[03:22:33.600 --> 03:22:37.600]  lift our sights and heal our divisions
[03:22:37.600 --> 03:22:41.600]  it's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers
[03:22:41.600 --> 03:22:45.600]  will never forget that whether we are black
[03:22:45.600 --> 03:22:49.600]  or brown or white we all
[03:22:49.600 --> 03:22:53.600]  lead the same red blood of patriots
[03:22:57.600 --> 03:23:01.600]  we all enjoy the same glorious
[03:23:01.600 --> 03:23:05.600]  freedoms and we all salute the same
[03:23:05.600 --> 03:23:09.600]  great American flag
[03:23:09.600 --> 03:23:13.600]  and whether a child is born
[03:23:13.600 --> 03:23:17.600]  in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the
[03:23:17.600 --> 03:23:21.600]  West Web Plains of Nebraska they look up at the same night sky
[03:23:21.600 --> 03:23:25.600]  they fill their heart with the same dreams
[03:23:25.600 --> 03:23:29.600]  and they are infused with the breath of life
[03:23:29.600 --> 03:23:33.600]  by the same almighty creator
[03:23:33.600 --> 03:23:37.600]  you know Billy Corrigan this is a couple years ago
[03:23:37.600 --> 03:23:41.600]  he said Alex the key of what you do is you talk about looking at the night sky
[03:23:41.600 --> 03:23:45.600]  coming together as humans
[03:23:45.600 --> 03:23:49.600]  from mountain from ocean to ocean hear these words
[03:23:49.600 --> 03:23:53.600]  you will never be ignored again
[03:23:53.600 --> 03:23:57.600]  again you say oh that's just hype
[03:23:57.600 --> 03:24:01.600]  no he's saying you little people of the power you're powerful
[03:24:01.600 --> 03:24:05.600]  demand action demand the truth it's like Bannon said keep us
[03:24:05.600 --> 03:24:09.600]  on to stay on us help us spur us and he's saying you have the power
[03:24:09.600 --> 03:24:13.600]  everything else is about oh you need us be powerful no no you come first
[03:24:13.600 --> 03:24:17.600]  you are what dictates the destiny all of us together
[03:24:17.600 --> 03:24:21.600]  let's finish the speech
[03:24:21.600 --> 03:24:25.600]  your voice your hopes

[03:24:37.600 --> 03:24:41.600]  back in five seconds what did I say on that promo that we've been running for two weeks
[03:24:41.600 --> 03:24:45.600]  I said this is American destiny and was taken but we have to be good
[03:24:45.600 --> 03:24:49.600]  we have to be loving we have to come together racially culturally we have to do this
[03:24:49.600 --> 03:24:53.600]  we are the power and notice Trump saying it he didn't get it from me
[03:24:53.600 --> 03:24:57.600]  it's the truth this is the true spirit of humanity that America
[03:24:57.600 --> 03:25:01.600]  was the greatest example of and that's why the enemies and controllers
[03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:05.600]  are now making a joke out of themselves let's finish
[03:25:05.600 --> 03:25:09.600]  and your courage and goodness and love
[03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:13.600]  will forever guide us along the way
[03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:17.600]  together we will make America strong again
[03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:21.600]  we will make America wealthy again
[03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:25.600]  we will make America proud again
[03:25:25.600 --> 03:25:29.600]  we will make America safe again and yes
[03:25:29.600 --> 03:25:33.600]  together we will make America great again
[03:25:33.600 --> 03:25:37.600]  thank you God bless you and God bless America
[03:25:37.600 --> 03:25:39.600]  thank you
[03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:43.600]  and you understand the entire globalist program is about moving individuals disempowered
[03:25:43.600 --> 03:25:47.600]  dependent he's saying no you're the power we're going to empower you
[03:25:47.600 --> 03:25:51.600]  you're going to empower us there's no way he's not real because
[03:25:51.600 --> 03:25:55.600]  this message is like sunlight to vampires this is the antithesis
[03:25:55.600 --> 03:25:59.600]  of the new world order leon we're going to cover all this coming back your view
[03:25:59.600 --> 03:26:03.600]  as a woman of the supposed million woman march which got damn close to it
[03:26:03.600 --> 03:26:07.600]  was there yesterday and what they were saying and doing and they were so evil and
[03:26:07.600 --> 03:26:11.600]  horrible it was like cartoonish that what was happening but I want to show how the CIA runs it
[03:26:11.600 --> 03:26:15.600]  and sorrows to the Muslims a Muslim group literally was
[03:26:15.600 --> 03:26:19.600]  running it that would put you in a dungeon I mean this is a
[03:26:19.600 --> 03:26:23.600]  one of the top ones but overall I don't know your
[03:26:23.600 --> 03:26:27.600]  view I haven't talked to you until you got her 10 minutes ago at the studio but I mean what is your view of
[03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:31.600]  what you saw well you know for me I think obviously
[03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:35.600]  this thing is kind of a cornerstone of our republic so I'm like fine go out
[03:26:35.600 --> 03:26:39.600]  there do what you need to do I feel truly like we are living in a dual
[03:26:39.600 --> 03:26:43.600]  reality with these people truly the dimensions have split and we are super
[03:26:43.600 --> 03:26:47.600]  imposed on top of them because we could listen to Donald Trump's
[03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:51.600]  speech and say wow incredible this is this
[03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:55.600]  all about unity it's it's we the people have the power back and like he's even getting like
[03:26:55.600 --> 03:26:59.600]  white supremacists to stop being racist I'm right now I mean he's like really this is real
[03:26:59.600 --> 03:27:03.600]  yeah and I mean let's you know walk it back a few months when he had
[03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:07.600]  the standing ovation at the RNC when he brought up gay
[03:27:07.600 --> 03:27:11.600]  people and said look it's time for the RNC.
[03:27:11.600 --> 03:27:15.600]  They did not even cover
[03:27:15.600 --> 03:27:19.600]  that in the mainstream media because they want to continue pushing this narrative that all of
[03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:23.600]  our civil rights are now a threat that Donald Trump has been put in power
[03:27:23.600 --> 03:27:27.600]  it just total crap and I was triggered this morning I went to the gym
[03:27:27.600 --> 03:27:31.600]  and I think I'm gonna have to switch to the YMCA because they have banned
[03:27:31.600 --> 03:27:35.600]  CNN from being played at their gym but CNN was on and they had the picture up
[03:27:35.600 --> 03:27:39.600]  side-by-side the fake news photo with a you know 8 30 in the morning
[03:27:39.600 --> 03:27:43.600]  when they took the photo of the crowd and said look here's the inauguration. Oh I know they're
[03:27:43.600 --> 03:27:47.600]  celebrating that no one showed up they were beating people up so they couldn't get in.
[03:27:47.600 --> 03:27:51.600]  I was personally punched repeatedly. Yeah and even CNN they have
[03:27:51.600 --> 03:27:55.600]  I couldn't get in at like nine I had to go like four miles around
[03:27:55.600 --> 03:27:59.600]  and I got attacked there couldn't get in everybody was on video live I had to go like
[03:27:59.600 --> 03:28:03.600]  so I barely got in didn't even get my seats like right up at the front. Right well they
[03:28:03.600 --> 03:28:07.600]  would have 40 people across six six rows deep blocking people off
[03:28:07.600 --> 03:28:11.600]  with like a human chain saying this this entry is blocked
[03:28:11.600 --> 03:28:15.600]  this entry is blocked. The weird thing is it was Black Lives Matter they were almost all white
[03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:19.600]  they'd punch me and say you're a white male FU. Right and it was so racist.
[03:28:19.600 --> 03:28:23.600]  Right well and and then also too I was seeing a tons of signs at the women's march
[03:28:23.600 --> 03:28:27.600]  posted all over social media about how white women voted for Trump don't forget it's white women's
[03:28:27.600 --> 03:28:31.600]  fault you know and then you have these conservative pro-life women who
[03:28:31.600 --> 03:28:35.600]  wanted to be a part of the march and they were excluded from it this isn't about women and equality
[03:28:35.600 --> 03:28:39.600]  in a women's march this is a total. Well I want to get your view on this because I mean I got to say
[03:28:39.600 --> 03:28:43.600]  they were so comically evil hateful and the men were the most
[03:28:43.600 --> 03:28:47.600]  beta like zombies like reanimated corpses

[03:33:07.600 --> 03:33:11.600]  the empire is on the run
[03:33:11.600 --> 03:33:15.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:33:15.600 --> 03:33:19.600]  I'm waiting
[03:33:19.600 --> 03:33:23.600]  I'm waiting in my cold cell
[03:33:23.600 --> 03:33:27.600]  when the bell begins to chime
[03:33:27.600 --> 03:33:31.600]  reflecting on my past life
[03:33:31.600 --> 03:33:35.600]  and let's be honest we at this show have changed the world
[03:33:35.600 --> 03:33:39.600]  and I'm more humble than I was 20 years ago
[03:33:39.600 --> 03:33:43.600]  and at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pool
[03:33:43.600 --> 03:33:47.600]  I mean they're openly saying they want to kill me they're saying shut us down
[03:33:47.600 --> 03:33:51.600]  I still have love for these wrongs of people
[03:33:51.600 --> 03:33:55.600]  that they were defeating me not in the way they thought
[03:33:55.600 --> 03:33:59.600]  as thousands of women every few minutes went by me screaming
[03:33:59.600 --> 03:34:03.600]  you hope you die fascist Nazi and I try to talk to them
[03:34:03.600 --> 03:34:07.600]  it was all on facebook mentions millions watching they wouldn't talk they just screamed
[03:34:07.600 --> 03:34:11.600]  I was the enemy and then go Trump not hate or hate not Trump
[03:34:11.600 --> 03:34:15.600]  and all this crazy froth and I was just like trying to talk and they wouldn't
[03:34:15.600 --> 03:34:19.600]  humanize me they wouldn't speak to me
[03:34:19.600 --> 03:34:23.600]  they wouldn't listen to me when the whole corporate world government is against
[03:34:23.600 --> 03:34:27.600]  Trump in America they couldn't see
[03:34:27.600 --> 03:34:31.600]  because they thought MSNBC and ABC was God
[03:34:31.600 --> 03:34:35.600]  and now I see the mainstream media and the attacks on America and nationalism
[03:34:35.600 --> 03:34:39.600]  and a global system that's going to destroy national sovereignty
[03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:43.600]  going into high gear what haven't they learned from their defeats
[03:34:43.600 --> 03:34:47.600]  Leigh Ann? Well it's just surreal watching the
[03:34:47.600 --> 03:34:51.600]  mainstream media is absolutely still trying to delegitimize Trump
[03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:55.600]  and every single move there once he called them out on that fake photo
[03:34:55.600 --> 03:34:59.600]  to pick on his crowd size that became their whole thing and so there are still
[03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:03.600]  you're like why are you complaining we said no one showed up or
[03:35:03.600 --> 03:35:07.600]  they're like oh he got rid of Martin Luther King you're like no I didn't hear it as well just shut up
[03:35:07.600 --> 03:35:11.600]  quit bitching they hate the fact he calls them they go he's obsessed with himself
[03:35:11.600 --> 03:35:15.600]  yeah the truth every time you lie he counters you exactly he's got more energy
[03:35:15.600 --> 03:35:19.600]  than all of you they can't stand it let me say I'm 43 I got more energy I thought
[03:35:19.600 --> 03:35:23.600]  Trump's me and it's not a Trump ass kissing contest
[03:35:23.600 --> 03:35:27.600]  Leigh Ann it started to get spooky no I mean here's the thing
[03:35:27.600 --> 03:35:31.600]  is when I was at the gym and CNN was on and I just saw the picture up there I didn't
[03:35:31.600 --> 03:35:35.600]  even stop to watch it I just got so angry because I was in my mind
[03:35:35.600 --> 03:35:39.600]  I'm thinking people only get there are people out there that
[03:35:39.600 --> 03:35:43.600]  I meant to give this to the crew if we don't do it today we'll show it tomorrow that they should like
[03:35:43.600 --> 03:35:47.600]  830 the shot with no one there and said look no one showed up meanwhile it was a record crowd of
[03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:51.600]  like 1.8 million I mean it's just like God I guess we thought
[03:35:51.600 --> 03:35:55.600]  they'd be discredited they go away no they're now like we're discredited let's just
[03:35:55.600 --> 03:35:59.600]  say the moon's made of cheese well and just to prove that they used a photo
[03:35:59.600 --> 03:36:03.600]  from earlier in the morning guys just Google left runs with fake photo
[03:36:03.600 --> 03:36:07.600]  there it is yeah yeah that's what they do you have the meme so I
[03:36:07.600 --> 03:36:11.600]  saw this photo that was out at about you know when I got here
[03:36:11.600 --> 03:36:15.600]  about nine o'clock the other day and I went on at 1030 and told
[03:36:15.600 --> 03:36:19.600]  David Knight I said watch they're gonna use this photo and say that Donald Trump doesn't have
[03:36:19.600 --> 03:36:23.600]  a crowd there you know they're already pushing this and it's all it's right there on the record
[03:36:23.600 --> 03:36:27.600]  at 1030 and then a little bit later they said look sure enough there it is they
[03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:31.600]  tweeted out the photo when their own gigapixel photo that they have shows
[03:36:31.600 --> 03:36:35.600]  a huge crowd but yet they're still gonna roll out that picture today
[03:36:35.600 --> 03:36:39.600]  and say Donald Trump says we're lying but here's the photo proof
[03:36:39.600 --> 03:36:43.600]  and that's what makes me so angry is that there are people out there that only get
[03:36:43.600 --> 03:36:47.600]  their news from CNN and they truly believe this alternate
[03:36:47.600 --> 03:36:51.600]  you know I was telling these women they're like oh Trump did bring
[03:36:51.600 --> 03:36:55.600]  jobs back and I'm like Chrysler Ford Carrier
[03:36:55.600 --> 03:36:59.600]  Foxcom all and they were just like liar and then they go
[03:36:59.600 --> 03:37:03.600]  after you white males all white women I was like that's so racist
[03:37:03.600 --> 03:37:07.600]  well then you get back to the real world there's actually a video up on the dredge report about this
[03:37:07.600 --> 03:37:11.600]  woman who was on the plane and she's you know flying out of DC talks to the
[03:37:11.600 --> 03:37:15.600]  person next to her to come here to protest or to celebrate and he's
[03:37:15.600 --> 03:37:19.600]  polite so once she finds out he was there to support
[03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:23.600]  celebrate democracy she starts going after him saying well I'm entitled to
[03:37:23.600 --> 03:37:27.600]  get drunk and puke on your lap I'm gonna you make me sick don't talk to me
[03:37:27.600 --> 03:37:31.600]  don't look at me don't even use the armrest move I'm gonna make you know and just totally
[03:37:31.600 --> 03:37:35.600]  being you discuss me you're a bigot get off this plane and he's like well
[03:37:35.600 --> 03:37:39.600]  ma'am the very definition of bigotry is disparaging someone prior to knowing
[03:37:39.600 --> 03:37:43.600]  them simply by their beliefs and opinions and she's like uh no you get
[03:37:43.600 --> 03:37:47.600]  forced him up and the stewardess shuts her down and says ma'am
[03:37:47.600 --> 03:37:51.600]  you don't have the right to kick this guy off the plane or to force him to move
[03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:55.600]  seats and then she ended up kicking this old lady off the plane
[03:37:55.600 --> 03:37:59.600]  that's what I'm saying I was there I don't know if you saw the live feeds
[03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:03.600]  yeah they would I mean they were just like
[03:38:03.600 --> 03:38:07.600]  we run this world now you get off the plane it was like I didn't exist
[03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:11.600]  yeah we'll see and that's the thing you know I'm glad that you brought that up because I feel like
[03:38:11.600 --> 03:38:15.600]  we could all be really tempted to attack them in the same
[03:38:15.600 --> 03:38:19.600]  way that they are no they're victims they're not you know
[03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:23.600]  they're like getting somebody out of like a major cult exactly I feel like
[03:38:23.600 --> 03:38:27.600]  Pence did a great job in the debate when you saw how that was
[03:38:27.600 --> 03:38:31.600]  I forget his name the Grinch Hillary Clinton's VP Tim Cain how he was
[03:38:31.600 --> 03:38:35.600]  trying to really just egg him on with all this buzzword crap and he just
[03:38:35.600 --> 03:38:39.600]  calmly was like you know come on let's just I feel like that's how we need
[03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:43.600]  to respond to these people just bringing them the facts and not falling for their
[03:38:43.600 --> 03:38:47.600]  for their bait because it's total crap it's delusional it's not
[03:38:47.600 --> 03:38:51.600]  agree but what do you think happens as we start restoring prosperity bringing
[03:38:51.600 --> 03:38:55.600]  people together what do they do next because they are hysterical how do you resist
[03:38:55.600 --> 03:38:59.600]  prosperity how do you resist freedom that's why I feel like I hope
[03:38:59.600 --> 03:39:03.600]  Donald Trump just kind of that's a bumper sticker how do you resist freedom
[03:39:03.600 --> 03:39:07.600]  exactly that's the thing is like I feel I really hope how do you resist
[03:39:07.600 --> 03:39:11.600]  your birthright how do you resist something so obviously because my guts
[03:39:11.600 --> 03:39:15.600]  never wrong right and I didn't like Trump before because I thought it like TV and I was like
[03:39:15.600 --> 03:39:18.600]  Trump and my guts is Trump Trump Trump exactly it was like why are you like a Trump
[03:39:18.600 --> 03:39:22.600]  I got my gut says it and thank God the last two years I sort of fall my gut I just
[03:39:22.600 --> 03:39:26.600]  God they want to kill him though I just and I hate I've never
[03:39:26.600 --> 03:39:29.600]  admired somebody like this it's like I actually feel embarrassed how much I
[03:39:29.600 --> 03:39:33.600]  admire him but he just keeps doing everything right I'm curious that was such
[03:39:33.600 --> 03:39:37.600]  inclusive loving speech and we were all wondering just waiting for them for the
[03:39:37.600 --> 03:39:41.600]  mainstream to get back to their little computers and type up their story like
[03:39:41.600 --> 03:39:45.600]  wondering how are they going to tear his speech apart and make it bad and he said
[03:39:45.600 --> 03:39:49.600]  it was ominous and scary it was the opposite yeah someone said it's reminding me of
[03:39:49.600 --> 03:39:53.600]  the ninth very unlock the diseases and cure people oh it's so scary
[03:39:53.600 --> 03:39:58.600]  yeah he's reminding me of the anti-semitic speech you know it's just
[03:39:58.600 --> 03:40:03.600]  what what speech were you listening to what that's what I'm saying oh I love he's
[03:40:03.600 --> 03:40:08.600]  anti-semitic right when he wants to move the Israeli US consulate from
[03:40:08.600 --> 03:40:12.600]  Tel Aviv Jerusalem yeah I mean it's just all made up crap because they know the
[03:40:12.600 --> 03:40:15.600]  average liberal doesn't know that like Jews were dancing in the streets yeah
[03:40:15.600 --> 03:40:18.600]  when Obama was like the most hostile president to Israel I know it's all
[03:40:18.600 --> 03:40:23.600]  upside down it's it's that's it's crazy like we are typically the ones
[03:40:23.600 --> 03:40:26.600]  checking the government we would typically be there going oh Trump making fun of
[03:40:26.600 --> 03:40:30.600]  his every move and like checking him and call but it's why my sir comes out it was
[03:40:30.600 --> 03:40:34.600]  a press conference and it's like all true and he was like all moral authority
[03:40:34.600 --> 03:40:39.600]  and hitting them and being honest I was like what is going on it is we are living
[03:40:39.600 --> 03:40:43.600]  in Lala it's crazy I'm curious how you felt though just being out there I know
[03:40:43.600 --> 03:40:47.600]  you kept kind of breaking down we saw you on the life you just I just felt
[03:40:47.600 --> 03:40:51.600]  really bad 20 years but this is 20 when they would March 5 say if you if you
[03:40:51.600 --> 03:40:55.600]  you're a racist yeah and you hate women when I don't just flipping me off just
[03:40:55.600 --> 03:40:58.600]  like it was like a cult mm-hmm it was like it was hundreds and hundreds of women
[03:40:58.600 --> 03:41:02.600]  an hour going f you I mean we're into fans to every other Trump supporter was
[03:41:02.600 --> 03:41:08.600]  an info warrior but I would try to say no no Edward Bernays the CIA it's to hurt
[03:41:08.600 --> 03:41:11.600]  them it would just go f you oh well and then one of the big things they were
[03:41:11.600 --> 03:41:16.600]  doing was putting on he jobs to show there's all I saw that it's like how
[03:41:16.600 --> 03:41:20.600]  dare you you big at being it's Islam when it totally enslaves women and I
[03:41:20.600 --> 03:41:24.600]  wasn't even bringing up Islam at first of oppression it's a symbol of that you
[03:41:24.600 --> 03:41:27.600]  know when you want to practice show me a lot of you want to come to work with a
[03:41:27.600 --> 03:41:30.600]  bag yeah it's like you have to be submissive imagine how to send those

[03:42:10.600 --> 03:42:14.600]  the article right here she was on Rachel Maddow before this March talking about it
[03:42:14.600 --> 03:42:20.600]  saying you know 22 states in this country don't allow sharia law they don't allow
[03:42:20.600 --> 03:42:24.600]  us to practice our religion it's like no sure you could practice Islam but sharia
[03:42:24.600 --> 03:42:28.600]  law is you're not gonna take a newborn girl and cut her genitals off but a tenant of
[03:42:28.600 --> 03:42:31.600]  the religion is kind of an aside so it's like here yeah they're using our
[03:42:31.600 --> 03:42:35.600]  freedom and here's our constitution you know version of it and it's like no it's
[03:42:35.600 --> 03:42:40.600]  liberal women saying the West that empowers women has enslaved them in my face

[03:47:32.600 --> 03:47:38.600]  11 a.m. the 3 p.m. Central with the rest of great crew for the weekday show is I
[03:47:38.600 --> 03:47:41.600]  want her to be able to get through all she wants to talk about because I was
[03:47:41.600 --> 03:47:44.600]  frustrated as a man I can't imagine a woman I'm just saying if you're a woman
[03:47:44.600 --> 03:47:48.600]  you're for Hillary you're for George Soros it is so crazy but speaking of
[03:47:48.600 --> 03:47:52.600]  Gloria Steinem I remember hearing Rush Limbaugh when I was a senior in high
[03:47:52.600 --> 03:47:58.600]  school like 1992 say Gloria Steinem in her new book admits that she was CIA and
[03:47:58.600 --> 03:48:01.600]  it was meant to break up the family and take control of things for social
[03:48:01.600 --> 03:48:05.600]  engineering so I went home was I knew my mother had seen that book on the coffee
[03:48:05.600 --> 03:48:09.600]  table like a month before and I picked it up and flipped to where Russian said and
[03:48:09.600 --> 03:48:13.600]  there it was so I'd mentioned that many times over the years and I would get
[03:48:13.600 --> 03:48:17.600]  emails and the news would say you can look this up Jones claims the CIA ran the
[03:48:17.600 --> 03:48:23.600]  feminist movement yeah they did stuff like almost no women smoke cigarettes how
[03:48:23.600 --> 03:48:26.600]  do we get them to worldwide well just say it's feminist smoke cigarettes ever
[03:48:26.600 --> 03:48:30.600]  Bernays we got articles on that like tomorrow I'll do more on this but you
[03:48:30.600 --> 03:48:34.600]  guys pulled up some of the articles for me there it is the torches of freedom is
[03:48:34.600 --> 03:48:37.600]  what they call it their husband won't let you smoke cigarettes the point is
[03:48:37.600 --> 03:48:41.600]  smoke one of you want they just said be a woman be cool torches of freedom
[03:48:41.600 --> 03:48:46.600]  because they targeted women Hitler did as well and then the next thing was you
[03:48:46.600 --> 03:48:50.600]  know ever Bernays and all this other garbage about going after the family
[03:48:50.600 --> 03:48:55.600]  breaking it up and then Gloria Steinem in this magazine the CIA and ugly art and
[03:48:55.600 --> 03:49:01.600]  break down the family it's all there so today I said hey Google her book and
[03:49:01.600 --> 03:49:07.600]  Nico acoustic our head producer goes no no look this is 60 minutes in the 60s and
[03:49:07.600 --> 03:49:12.600]  so I was like whoa this just went up a little while ago here's part of it where
[03:49:12.600 --> 03:49:17.600]  she talks about the CIA and the foundations wanted to work with her
[03:49:17.600 --> 03:49:21.600]  again it's the found it's not about empowering women it's about making you
[03:49:21.600 --> 03:49:26.600]  totally poor turning men into betas at ending society here it is Gloria at the
[03:49:26.600 --> 03:49:32.600]  festival you worked for the independent research service seven well exactly when
[03:49:32.600 --> 03:49:38.600]  did your own association with the CIA start and in what fashion they come to
[03:49:38.600 --> 03:49:44.600]  you or did you go to them in 1958 when I came home for me and from India I
[03:49:44.600 --> 03:49:50.600]  discussed with student leaders past and present many of them active with the
[03:49:50.600 --> 03:49:56.600]  National Student Association this kind of small foundation to encourage
[03:49:56.600 --> 03:50:02.600]  Americans to go they thought it was a good idea to I was then told by
[03:50:02.600 --> 03:50:08.600]  foundations and professors and friends that it that I should not do this that
[03:50:08.600 --> 03:50:12.600]  I would get in trouble with House and American Activities Committee the
[03:50:12.600 --> 03:50:19.600]  American Legion all of us are still battling this 50s people and I became
[03:50:19.600 --> 03:50:23.600]  convinced that it was impossible it was at that point that the student leaders
[03:50:23.600 --> 03:50:28.600]  said to me that they had in the past received funds for international
[03:50:28.600 --> 03:50:33.600]  programs from the CIA and that they felt that this was important and could also
[03:50:33.600 --> 03:50:38.600]  be partly funded by the stop right there you feel it miss magazine the mainstream
[03:50:38.600 --> 03:50:43.600]  media all of it not to empower women but to totally enslave women look at the
[03:50:43.600 --> 03:50:47.600]  statistic today illegitimacy it's all collapsing the elitist the of the
[03:50:47.600 --> 03:50:52.600]  illiteracy it's all there Leanne it's crazy this is in her book and I can
[03:50:52.600 --> 03:50:56.600]  pull the articles when they said it didn't exist now we have her on film
[03:50:56.600 --> 03:50:59.600]  right yeah I remember doing a big report about this and just cultural
[03:50:59.600 --> 03:51:03.600]  Marxism and where it really all started and and it wasn't about empowering
[03:51:03.600 --> 03:51:08.600]  women to get them in the workforce it was about creating new tax income new
[03:51:08.600 --> 03:51:12.600]  slave workers breaking up the family I mean this is a whole big plan that as
[03:51:12.600 --> 03:51:17.600]  we can see Gloria Steinem has been a part of it for decades and you know women
[03:51:17.600 --> 03:51:21.600]  just think that it's there we are ripping away their rights their free
[03:51:21.600 --> 03:51:25.600]  and they think making men it's like we're in competition with men right and
[03:51:25.600 --> 03:51:29.600]  already are 40% of the college graduates it's all don't worry men are gone
[03:51:29.600 --> 03:51:33.600]  there's no men left it's all over you've everything's wrecked it was all
[03:51:33.600 --> 03:51:38.600]  literally I have an in-game 2.0 all the documents where they admit everything
[03:51:38.600 --> 03:51:42.600]  the chemicals in the water the in men it's really bad well here's the thing
[03:51:42.600 --> 03:51:46.600]  that's really infuriating to me is that women are always kind of at the front
[03:51:46.600 --> 03:51:49.600]  lines when there's any kind of a movement civil rights this and that but
[03:51:49.600 --> 03:51:52.600]  who's going to speak up for them when they're obsolete because if you look at
[03:51:52.600 --> 03:51:56.600]  the cover of National Geographic magazine and it's like the gender revolution
[03:51:56.600 --> 03:52:03.600]  they have a man they have a transgender man a bi-gender woman a transgender
[03:52:03.600 --> 03:52:07.600]  woman a transgender woman and then some other thing that's very well you just
[03:52:07.600 --> 03:52:10.600]  said that's what you just said it's so astute actual in in Charlotte
[03:52:10.600 --> 03:52:14.600]  israeli's documents she released from as the head of the Department of Education
[03:52:14.600 --> 03:52:20.600]  she was the number two in it mr. in the 80s they say it's brave new world 1932
[03:52:20.600 --> 03:52:26.600]  the the plan is no gender all test tubes so of course they get women to go oh
[03:52:26.600 --> 03:52:29.600]  men and your enemy you're the main target because women are the species
[03:52:29.600 --> 03:52:32.600]  everybody's a girl when they're first embryonic right and then the genetics
[03:52:32.600 --> 03:52:36.600]  chooses to make a male to defend the women but you're just your heterosexual
[03:52:36.600 --> 03:52:42.600]  female woman not represented at all on there a woman who is just just your
[03:52:42.600 --> 03:52:47.600]  typical woman who wants to love a man and start a family and you're unnecessary
[03:52:47.600 --> 03:52:51.600]  you're not a part of the gender revolution I mean to me that is insane like
[03:52:51.600 --> 03:52:55.600]  women fight almost they're like don't talk about your period because not all
[03:52:55.600 --> 03:52:59.600]  women have vaginas like I'm sorry what you're going to just it's all about an
[03:52:59.600 --> 03:53:03.600]  attack on the species it's all about a shut down the species land right I want
[03:53:03.600 --> 03:53:06.600]  to show a clip here because this is come back tomorrow you promise for an hour
[03:53:06.600 --> 03:53:10.600]  I promise because this is so huge again I'm going to show you all I have them
[03:53:10.600 --> 03:53:15.600]  we printed them all up this is all declassified and I want to play a clip
[03:53:15.600 --> 03:53:20.600]  of one of our reporters there in DC yesterday at the women's march and
[03:53:20.600 --> 03:53:23.600]  there's there's dozens of hours of this with our four or five reporters that were
[03:53:23.600 --> 03:53:29.600]  there including myself and they would say hey Saudi Arabia is who really funds
[03:53:29.600 --> 03:53:33.600]  Hillary they would say oh no Donald Trump's the one that got that funding and
[03:53:33.600 --> 03:53:36.600]  then we kind of moved on but the point is he got zero money from Saudi Arabia
[03:53:36.600 --> 03:53:40.600]  that literally enslaves women that's what's so crazy they're bitching at the
[03:53:40.600 --> 03:53:44.600]  West that was about in the whole West about worshiping the goddess let's just
[03:53:44.600 --> 03:53:48.600]  get down the brass tacks the entire Magna Carta western government the whole
[03:53:48.600 --> 03:53:52.600]  Renaissance is about empowering women we're the place that empowered them and
[03:53:52.600 --> 03:53:56.600]  now they're like there was Islamic jihad wearing hoods on their heads saying
[03:53:56.600 --> 03:54:01.600]  you're a white male or you're a Westerner F you so this is this is this is
[03:54:01.600 --> 03:54:06.600]  total victims worshiping their abusers here it is
[03:54:31.600 --> 03:54:33.600]  we all deserve
[03:54:33.600 --> 03:54:37.600]  same rights we all deserve respect we all deserve to be treated exactly like men are
[03:54:37.600 --> 03:54:43.600]  treated maybe even like we're not asking for special permission we're asking for
[03:54:43.600 --> 03:54:46.600]  like the same like
[03:54:46.600 --> 03:54:49.600]  did you guys support Hillary Clinton
[03:54:49.600 --> 03:54:54.600]  well did you know that Hillary Clinton took millions of dollars
[03:54:54.600 --> 03:54:56.600]  for Saudi Arabia
[03:54:56.600 --> 03:54:59.600]  for her campaign
[03:54:59.600 --> 03:55:04.600]  she raised millions of dollars for her campaign
[03:55:04.600 --> 03:55:08.600]  and she came here to Donald Trump raised like being comparable
[03:55:08.600 --> 03:55:13.600]  he used the money that he raised to pay for a portrait of so much
[03:55:13.600 --> 03:55:17.600]  I think what Hillary Clinton did is amazing and it's a shame
[03:55:17.600 --> 03:55:22.600]  alright so these same women don't know she raised 50 times the corporate money
[03:55:22.600 --> 03:55:26.600]  Trump did literally the Saudi Arabia gave no money they just say oh a portrait
[03:55:26.600 --> 03:55:31.600]  oh he had no crew he had no audience Saudi Arabia loves me
[03:55:31.600 --> 03:55:33.600]  this is upside down world leon
[03:55:33.600 --> 03:55:38.600]  it's absolutely flipped inverted reality we are dealing with people who are living in a dual reality
[03:55:38.600 --> 03:55:40.600]  and we have to remember that that's why it feels
[03:55:40.600 --> 03:55:43.600]  how do women look under Islam versus with Trump
[03:55:43.600 --> 03:55:47.600]  women are like on a pedestal with Trump how are they with Islam
[03:55:47.600 --> 03:55:51.600]  well they're oppressed just by nature you are the underclass
[03:55:51.600 --> 03:55:55.600]  you can get stoned for being raped you can get phoned in jail if you're the victim of rape
[03:55:55.600 --> 03:55:58.600]  they do that you get raped and you report it
[03:55:58.600 --> 03:56:01.600]  because rape is ubiquitous you are killed
[03:56:01.600 --> 03:56:04.600]  and then you've shamed your family so they can you know honor kill you
[03:56:04.600 --> 03:56:05.600]  or acid on your face
[03:56:05.600 --> 03:56:06.600]  right I mean
[03:56:06.600 --> 03:56:09.600]  yeah what kind of dad kills their 10 year old daughter
[03:56:09.600 --> 03:56:12.600]  there's a bunch of thugs raper I'll go kill those people I'm not gonna kill my daughter
[03:56:12.600 --> 03:56:15.600]  yeah it's your fault you know because you didn't cover your hair
[03:56:15.600 --> 03:56:18.600]  or you let your ankles show in public
[03:56:18.600 --> 03:56:22.600]  so or you went out to the grocery store by yourself without your mail
[03:56:22.600 --> 03:56:27.600]  let's just say it modern Islam particularly is about
[03:56:27.600 --> 03:56:29.600]  covering the sun that is women
[03:56:29.600 --> 03:56:32.600]  it's all about just putting a bag over the most beautiful thing there is
[03:56:32.600 --> 03:56:35.600]  well women in the West have more rights than anyone
[03:56:35.600 --> 03:56:38.600]  we're more free than any other country
[03:56:38.600 --> 03:56:41.600]  men have less rights than us frankly
[03:56:41.600 --> 03:56:44.600]  we have it great here so the fact that you have all these women out there
[03:56:44.600 --> 03:56:46.600]  in just a total Wally work
[03:56:46.600 --> 03:56:49.600]  I'm not just saying this look at chivalry it's all about women or on a pedestal
[03:56:49.600 --> 03:56:53.600]  let me let me open the door for you and yes someone will say oh well that's
[03:56:53.600 --> 03:56:58.600]  because they assume that I'm just weaker and I'm like no obviously I can open up a door
[03:56:58.600 --> 03:57:01.600]  but I really appreciate it when a guy's like here you go
[03:57:01.600 --> 03:57:05.600]  woman like what says it's been a way to die for their families
[03:57:05.600 --> 03:57:09.600]  exactly and I mean that's that to me is one of the reasons why
