[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:31.460]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:31.460 --> 00:35.780]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:35.780 --> 00:40.020]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:40.020 --> 00:42.020]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:42.020 --> 00:59.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is November 1, 2019.
[00:59.500 --> 01:07.380]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[01:07.380 --> 01:14.580]  Congressman Louis Gilmour gave an extremely powerful nine-minute speech from the floor
[01:14.580 --> 01:20.100]  of the House, and we're going to air it in its entirety, coming up at the start of the
[01:20.100 --> 01:21.100]  next segment.
[01:21.100 --> 01:26.540]  That's just the best way to do this here.
[01:26.540 --> 01:48.180]  Now, the system intends to remove the President, and everyone continues to say, well, he hadn't
[01:48.180 --> 01:52.940]  done anything wrong, so he's not going to be removed.
[01:52.940 --> 02:04.340]  And it's precisely because of that that they intend to remove the President.
[02:04.340 --> 02:08.940]  That's the whole point.
[02:08.940 --> 02:19.380]  And so we have reached that crossroads now, where individuals are going to have to decide
[02:19.380 --> 02:27.540]  what they're going to do to resist this, because the criminals that have taken control of much
[02:27.540 --> 02:33.820]  of the world want final control of the United States, and if they remove Trump, there is
[02:33.820 --> 02:42.340]  going to be a reign of terror against the American people, and they've said they're
[02:42.340 --> 02:47.460]  going to engage in a reign of terror, and they're already engaging in one.
[02:47.460 --> 02:52.940]  Now, Louis Gomer is the canary in the coal mine.
[02:52.940 --> 02:59.300]  We're going to play this clip a lot today on air, not just the full clip, but we're
[02:59.300 --> 03:13.540]  going to play where he talks about the fact that revolutions don't start with guns.
[03:13.540 --> 03:22.580]  Guns come at the end, and he says we're going into an area where there's going to be guns
[03:22.580 --> 03:35.740]  involved, and he says, I don't want guns to be involved.
[03:35.740 --> 03:42.260]  But he says downstairs in a secret room, they're not letting even Congress see what's
[03:42.260 --> 03:48.180]  going on, and that's never been done before, and we have all these other witnesses in transcripts
[03:48.180 --> 03:53.060]  showing the president didn't do anything, and the head of the committee has read into
[03:53.060 --> 03:58.540]  the record a fake transcript, and they've been caught in all these other hoaxes, and
[03:58.540 --> 04:06.220]  they have armed men keeping us out of there, and then the few witnesses that are in there
[04:06.220 --> 04:13.540]  say that Schiff's telling the witnesses what to say, and the list of witnesses all worked
[04:13.540 --> 04:21.260]  for Obama, and Hillary, and Clapper, and Brennan, and hate Trump with an absolute passion and
[04:21.260 --> 04:27.900]  are lying just like in the whole cabinol hearings we saw.
[04:27.900 --> 04:43.620]  So they have passed, and they have initiated the beginning of the impeachment process its
[04:43.620 --> 04:52.620]  life, and they know that it's going to trigger unrest if they remove Trump, and they're planning
[04:52.620 --> 04:53.940]  on that.
[04:53.940 --> 04:54.940]  This is it.
[04:54.940 --> 04:56.740]  This is the greatest challenge to America in its history.
[04:56.740 --> 04:59.380]  We couldn't fall from without, but we're falling from within.
[04:59.380 --> 05:02.940]  However you're watching, however you're listening on AM and FM stations, TV stations, or at
[05:02.940 --> 05:07.820]  infowars.com, or at band.video, or wherever you are, tell people to tune in.
[05:07.820 --> 05:09.100]  This is history.
[05:09.100 --> 05:13.460]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds, and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[05:13.460 --> 05:15.340]  I don't care what your views are.
[05:15.340 --> 05:18.580]  I hope you articulate them, and defend them, and listen, and debate them.
[05:18.580 --> 05:19.580]  That's important.
[05:19.580 --> 05:20.860]  But we have something in common.
[05:20.860 --> 05:24.980]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[05:24.980 --> 05:30.140]  Clinton, deep state bag man, Comey, thinks it's funny that he was the leaker, and that
[05:30.140 --> 05:32.140]  he lied to Congress and the world.
[05:32.140 --> 05:36.460]  He thinks committing crimes are funny, and he thinks if he acts confident, he won't
[05:36.460 --> 05:37.460]  get indicted.
[05:37.460 --> 05:42.380]  But word is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[05:42.380 --> 05:45.220]  From my new home in New Zealand, I will...
[05:45.220 --> 05:50.700]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[05:50.700 --> 05:52.580]  Not so fast, criminal.
[05:52.580 --> 05:56.540]  We're going to bring you to justice, and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[05:56.540 --> 06:01.260]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[06:01.260 --> 06:06.060]  But the American people know how much you hate us, and we're fighting back at infowars.com,
[06:06.060 --> 06:31.340]  newswars.com, and band dive video.
[06:31.340 --> 06:35.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this November 1st.
[06:35.380 --> 06:40.700]  2019 Worldwide Broadcast, I'm Alex Jones.
[06:40.700 --> 06:44.140]  And the establishment wanted us off air before they tried to remove Trump.
[06:44.140 --> 06:46.460]  They wanted everybody else's silence as well.
[06:46.460 --> 06:48.780]  And now they're banning Republican ads on the internet.
[06:48.780 --> 06:53.060]  They're banning Republican congressmen from even speaking on Twitter and Facebook.
[06:53.060 --> 06:56.380]  They're banning Trump from running pro-women ads.
[06:56.380 --> 07:00.260]  And Trump's put up with it so far, and so it's eliciting this criminal response.
[07:00.260 --> 07:04.660]  The good news is, the president has done what we've said he should do three years ago,
[07:04.660 --> 07:11.580]  start having fireside chats, national addresses, weekly to the American people to bypass all
[07:11.580 --> 07:12.820]  this and cut right to it.
[07:12.820 --> 07:14.660]  But that's too little too late.
[07:14.660 --> 07:20.220]  He has to do emergency addresses to the nation about how Schiff and Hillary and all of them
[07:20.220 --> 07:24.620]  are running this, and how they plan to run Hillary again after he's been impeached and
[07:24.620 --> 07:27.500]  Pelosi is the president.
[07:27.500 --> 07:34.340]  And now CNN is saying they're going to remove Trump and then Pence and put in Pelosi.
[07:34.340 --> 07:35.740]  That's the Constitution.
[07:35.740 --> 07:38.620]  She will then appoint Hillary as the vice president.
[07:38.620 --> 07:42.700]  But that might not be even needed because Hillary can then run against weak Republicans
[07:42.700 --> 07:43.900]  once Trump's been removed.
[07:43.900 --> 07:46.020]  They mean to do it.
[07:46.020 --> 07:47.020]  This is dangerous.
[07:47.020 --> 07:49.540]  Now, Louis Gohmert laid it out.
[07:49.540 --> 07:52.860]  It's up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[07:52.860 --> 07:58.500]  Texas congressman, he said, revolutions don't start violently.
[07:58.500 --> 08:04.020]  The shooting comes later and he explains that we're now entering that wheelhouse of a shooting
[08:04.020 --> 08:06.740]  war and that they're eliciting it.
[08:06.740 --> 08:11.580]  If they illegally try to remove the president and don't follow procedures correctly, then
[08:11.580 --> 08:15.220]  it becomes a discussion of force against this illegitimate group.
[08:15.220 --> 08:19.180]  If the Justice Department and everybody else won't act, the Democrats and the globalists
[08:19.180 --> 08:23.820]  funded by foreign states have brought America to its greatest crisis in its history.
[08:23.820 --> 08:24.820]  Make no mistake.
[08:24.820 --> 08:28.540]  The full video is on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[08:28.540 --> 08:33.260]  We'll put that headline back up for TV viewers and radio listeners, and I'm asking everyone
[08:33.260 --> 08:35.060]  to go there.
[08:35.060 --> 08:39.780]  Representative Gohmert says coup to push America into civil war.
[08:39.780 --> 08:46.780]  Now, here is much of what he had to say in the floor of the House yesterday.
[08:46.780 --> 08:53.220]  You get to ask the questions, you see the questions, you get to hear the answers, and
[08:53.220 --> 08:56.940]  you get to observe the witnesses.
[08:56.940 --> 09:00.620]  It's important.
[09:00.620 --> 09:15.580]  And yet, under orders of the Speaker and Chairman Schiff, this so-called comparative grand jury
[09:15.580 --> 09:26.380]  kept the huge majority out of those hearings where we could hear and see for ourselves.
[09:26.380 --> 09:32.620]  And now, we find out through the vote today that, yeah, the Judiciary Committee is ultimately
[09:32.620 --> 09:40.020]  going to get this from the Intelligence Committee, but never in the history of this country have
[09:40.020 --> 09:49.260]  we had such gross unfairness that one party would put armed guards with guns to prevent
[09:49.260 --> 09:56.300]  the duly authorized people from being able to hear the witnesses and see them for themselves.
[09:56.300 --> 10:03.660]  And then, oh, we hear from this resolution today, we're going to send you the depositions
[10:03.660 --> 10:09.500]  after we get through doctoring and looking at and editing the transcripts.
[10:09.500 --> 10:14.780]  We'll send you those so you have the evidence you need.
[10:14.780 --> 10:22.500]  That's not the kind of evidence that a coup should be based on.
[10:22.500 --> 10:27.860]  If we're going to have what they're trying to legalize as a coup, we ought to have a
[10:27.860 --> 10:32.020]  right to see each of those witnesses.
[10:32.020 --> 10:39.900]  And the only potential use for the depositions should be impeachment of those witnesses.
[10:39.900 --> 10:44.620]  Nothing else, not for anything substantive.
[10:44.620 --> 10:52.540]  The president's attorney, unlike in 74 and 98, were not allowed to be there, even seeing
[10:52.540 --> 10:55.660]  here the witnesses.
[10:55.660 --> 11:04.260]  So the references to this being a star chamber are not inappropriate.
[11:04.260 --> 11:12.380]  It's outrageous what's been going on for people who truly care about due process.
[11:12.380 --> 11:21.740]  Regarding the procedures now, the Judiciary Committee must operate pursuant to the procedures
[11:21.740 --> 11:26.500]  imposed by the chairman of the Rules Committee.
[11:26.500 --> 11:33.260]  Well, previously, on the oldest committees in the House of Representatives, the Judiciary
[11:33.260 --> 11:42.980]  Committee and prior impeachments made the rules for the impeachment hearing.
[11:42.980 --> 11:49.180]  We didn't have it dictated by the Rules Committee, no, because this is the Judiciary Committee.
[11:49.180 --> 11:55.820]  These are people that are supposed to have expertise in constitutional issues.
[11:55.820 --> 12:03.580]  So when you have the committee that has more expertise in constitutional issues, what did
[12:03.580 --> 12:05.140]  the majority do?
[12:05.140 --> 12:10.700]  We don't want the committee with the most expertise on constitutional issues dealing
[12:10.700 --> 12:12.900]  with these constitutional issues.
[12:12.900 --> 12:22.780]  We want to put armed guards outside a hearing and have it in a secret compartmented information
[12:22.780 --> 12:31.180]  facility, and we're not going to let the other side call their own witnesses so we get a
[12:31.180 --> 12:36.820]  fair picture of what actually went on, and we're not even going to let them ask questions.
[12:36.820 --> 12:37.820]  We don't want them to ask.
[12:37.820 --> 12:46.540]  We'll instruct the witnesses not to answer, because you see, they want it to be a one-sided
[12:46.540 --> 12:55.060]  non-due process sham court, and it's about to push this country to a civil war if they
[12:55.060 --> 12:58.380]  were to get their wishes.
[12:58.380 --> 13:03.740]  And if there's one thing I don't want to see in my lifetime, I don't want to ever have
[13:03.740 --> 13:07.860]  participation in, it's a civil war.
[13:07.860 --> 13:15.340]  Some historian, I don't remember who, said guns are only involved in the last phase of
[13:15.340 --> 13:18.100]  a civil war.
[13:18.100 --> 13:25.500]  What's gone on here is not protected the Constitution, it's not protected the institutions, it's
[13:25.500 --> 13:35.540]  not protected this little experiment in self-government, know what it has done, has put it all at risk.
[13:35.540 --> 13:42.220]  Because what some people in this body don't seem to understand is, when you set a precedent
[13:42.220 --> 13:52.260]  as dangerous as what we have been watching for the last three years, it won't be me,
[13:52.260 --> 13:58.220]  but there will be Republicans, if this isn't stopped, there will be Republicans that will
[13:58.220 --> 14:05.220]  take the precedent of what the Democrats have done here and use it against a Democratic
[14:05.220 --> 14:10.820]  president, try to set him up and create a coup.
[14:10.820 --> 14:15.260]  Like I say, it won't be me, but that's the way history works.
[14:15.260 --> 14:22.540]  Then somebody sets a precedent, then eventually somebody also not concerned about due process
[14:22.540 --> 14:30.100]  is going to try to mimic that and go one further.
[14:30.100 --> 14:39.780]  In 1974, 1998, the committee procedures during those Clinton and Nixon impeachment processes,
[14:39.780 --> 14:45.540]  they included the ability of the president's counsel to attend all hearings, including
[14:45.540 --> 14:52.540]  those in executive session, question any and all witnesses called before the committee,
[14:52.540 --> 14:59.220]  submit written questions for additional testimony, and precise summaries of what he would propose
[14:59.220 --> 15:05.940]  to show and respond to evidence received and testimony presented either orally or in writing
[15:05.940 --> 15:08.340]  as determined by the committee.
[15:08.340 --> 15:14.620]  The president's counsel could also review all evidence obtained in the course of the
[15:14.620 --> 15:17.740]  impeachment inquiry.
[15:17.740 --> 15:21.860]  Not only has the president's counsel not been allowed to do any of those things that
[15:21.860 --> 15:29.780]  have been done in the past to ensure due process and fairness, even the rest of this voting
[15:29.780 --> 15:36.340]  body that will have to vote on an impeachment were not allowed to see the witnesses, to
[15:36.340 --> 15:42.660]  hear the witnesses, to review the transcripts until after they're through working with the
[15:42.660 --> 15:44.160]  transcripts.
[15:44.160 --> 15:51.060]  This resolution today bifurcates the impeachment, only allows president's counsel to participate
[15:51.060 --> 15:53.380]  in judiciary committee proceedings.
[15:53.380 --> 15:58.580]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, did you hear that?
[15:58.580 --> 16:01.060]  Civil wars don't start with shooting.
[16:01.060 --> 16:02.060]  That comes at the end.
[16:02.060 --> 16:05.100]  And we're beginning to approach that point.
[16:05.100 --> 16:06.100]  This is real.
[16:06.100 --> 16:07.100]  This is happening.
[16:07.100 --> 16:36.100]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.

[17:22.460 --> 17:27.700]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.

[19:11.780 --> 19:17.020]  A few days ago, my 11 year old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[19:17.020 --> 19:21.700]  She said, dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and
[19:21.700 --> 19:26.180]  it says that 2 billion people have low IQs are mentally retarded on the planet Earth.
[19:26.180 --> 19:28.020]  Because they didn't get enough iodine.
[19:28.020 --> 19:31.700]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not
[19:31.700 --> 19:32.700]  true.
[19:32.700 --> 19:36.820]  But dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what you said.
[19:36.820 --> 19:41.420]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high quality, nutraceutical
[19:41.420 --> 19:46.860]  grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, why you're so alive.
[19:46.860 --> 19:51.860]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids
[19:51.860 --> 19:56.300]  your age and it just really blew her away to read it there for herself.
[19:56.300 --> 20:02.220]  And I know that 2 billion people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded
[20:02.220 --> 20:05.380]  on the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[20:05.380 --> 20:12.300]  Research it and find out for yourself now info wars.com.
[20:12.300 --> 20:36.300]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:36.300 --> 20:59.660]  Are we going to sit here and let a bunch of satanic pedophiles completely dominate the
[20:59.660 --> 21:02.300]  country and have their way with us?
[21:02.300 --> 21:08.660]  Are we going to let them destroy the rule of law, have kangaroo courts, persecute innocent
[21:08.660 --> 21:14.380]  people in the streets, launch endless wars in our name, or are we going to give back
[21:14.380 --> 21:17.380]  to God?
[21:17.380 --> 21:18.900]  That's the question.
[21:18.900 --> 21:25.460]  And Louis Gohmert of Texas laid it out, armed men under the command of the Democrats are
[21:25.460 --> 21:30.940]  having secret kangaroo hearings with known liars who've been caught lying, who work for
[21:30.940 --> 21:35.580]  Hillary and Obama and Clapper and Brennan and the rest of them, and they are leading
[21:35.580 --> 21:37.820]  us into an armed civil war.
[21:37.820 --> 21:41.420]  They've been talking about removing the president outside of law.
[21:41.420 --> 21:46.140]  They've been talking about removing him saying he's mentally ill because they couldn't get
[21:46.140 --> 21:48.060]  the impeachment they thought.
[21:48.060 --> 21:54.820]  So instead they're going forward with a rigged event, which is extremely dangerous and is
[21:54.820 --> 21:55.940]  illegal.
[21:55.940 --> 22:00.820]  So here is the Congress from Texas talking about how civil wars really start.
[22:00.820 --> 22:06.620]  And we're in one now when they're censoring a whole class of people and persecuting them
[22:06.620 --> 22:10.980]  and taking their bank accounts and beating them up and throwing coffee on them and calling
[22:10.980 --> 22:16.580]  them Nazis.
[22:16.580 --> 22:20.380]  And then calling themselves the defenders of speech, it's sick.
[22:20.380 --> 22:24.420]  And then that very group of globalists are the ones that have sold the nation out.
[22:24.420 --> 22:27.140]  So here's the key to what Congressman Gohmert said.
[22:27.140 --> 22:30.900]  Full speech is on infowars.com.
[22:30.900 --> 22:36.460]  We don't want the committee with the most expertise on constitutional issues dealing
[22:36.460 --> 22:38.660]  with these constitutional issues.
[22:38.660 --> 22:48.460]  We want to put armed guards outside a hearing and have it in a secret compartmented information
[22:48.460 --> 22:52.060]  facility.
[22:52.060 --> 22:57.700]  And we're not going to let the other side call their own witnesses so we get a fair picture
[22:57.700 --> 22:59.700]  of what actually went on.
[22:59.700 --> 23:02.580]  And we're not even going to let them ask questions.
[23:02.580 --> 23:03.700]  We don't want them to ask.
[23:03.700 --> 23:07.180]  We'll instruct the witnesses not to answer.
[23:07.180 --> 23:17.140]  Because you see, they want it to be a one-sided, non-due process sham court.
[23:17.140 --> 23:24.160]  And it's about to push this country to a civil war if they were to get their wishes.
[23:24.160 --> 23:29.500]  And if there's one thing I don't want to see in my lifetime, I don't want to ever have
[23:29.500 --> 23:33.620]  participation in, it's a civil war.
[23:33.620 --> 23:41.100]  Some historian, I don't remember who, said guns are only involved in the last phase of
[23:41.100 --> 23:43.860]  a civil war.
[23:43.860 --> 23:48.260]  What's gone on here has not protected the Constitution.
[23:48.260 --> 23:51.220]  It's not protected the institutions.
[23:51.220 --> 23:55.540]  It's not protected this little experiment in self-government.
[23:55.540 --> 24:00.220]  Know what it has done, has put it all at risk.
[24:00.220 --> 24:07.540]  Absolutely, it is the globalist, foreign powers, with their agents doing all of this.
[24:07.540 --> 24:13.220]  And you're going to see the most incredible clips ever of Brennan and Clapper and others
[24:13.220 --> 24:24.460]  and the former CIA director, McGlocklin, saying, thank God for the deep state, says John McGlocklin,
[24:24.460 --> 24:27.940]  like they're these heroes, and thank God there's no chain of command for us.
[24:27.940 --> 24:33.140]  Yeah, no Bill of Rights, no Constitution, no due process, not even a branch of government.
[24:33.140 --> 24:42.740]  Just put in by Hillary, the Clintons, put in by Obama, run in the show.
[24:42.740 --> 24:48.860]  Maybe you can do whatever you want, created ISIS, destabilized the Middle East, committed
[24:48.860 --> 24:54.180]  all these crimes.
[24:54.180 --> 24:57.020]  Think about that.
[24:57.020 --> 25:01.020]  And they get up there in this clip about how they are the most moral, good people and how
[25:01.020 --> 25:07.260]  they are trooping up to the little secret hearings and spewing their lies and their
[25:07.260 --> 25:08.260]  garbage.
[25:08.260 --> 25:12.980]  They're doing it, they literally all are the adjuncts.
[25:12.980 --> 25:19.420]  The gophers, the secretaries of these individuals that think because they got in control of
[25:19.420 --> 25:23.140]  these giant sprawling intelligence agencies, they're supposedly to fight the Russians in
[25:23.140 --> 25:31.300]  the Cold War, that it's their right to rule over us now, and they're the permanent, fourth
[25:31.300 --> 25:33.620]  branch of government that is above the law.
[25:33.620 --> 25:34.620]  Here they are.
[25:34.620 --> 25:44.060]  We have to agree that now the impeachment inquiry is underway, sparked by a complaint
[25:44.060 --> 25:50.780]  from someone within the intelligence community, it feeds the president's concern and often
[25:50.780 --> 25:55.460]  used term about a deep state, being there to take him out.
[25:55.460 --> 25:57.260]  Thank God for the deep state.
[25:57.260 --> 25:59.740]  Hit pause, please, great job, crew.
[25:59.740 --> 26:01.900]  Back that up again.
[26:01.900 --> 26:02.900]  From the start.
[26:02.900 --> 26:04.420]  Here's the reporter, CBS saying.
[26:04.420 --> 26:11.940]  We have the deep state, your secretaries, your managers, your viceroys, it's the list
[26:11.940 --> 26:12.940]  of them here.
[26:12.940 --> 26:13.940]  I'll go over it later.
[26:13.940 --> 26:19.180]  Michael Savage is coming on next, and we'll get back into all this, and Brennan is all
[26:19.180 --> 26:24.900]  on a power trip, arrogantly looking like a crocodile, just looking like a psycho from
[26:24.900 --> 26:29.460]  a movie, former CIA director, next to the other former CIA director that thinks they
[26:29.460 --> 26:32.620]  own this country, globalist.
[26:32.620 --> 26:37.060]  He says, thank God for the deep state, intel traders admit they want to take out Trump.
[26:37.060 --> 26:38.660]  They say that too.
[26:38.660 --> 26:42.300]  It's all by them, the whole chain, and they think they control Congress, they're having
[26:42.300 --> 26:48.820]  fake secret hearings right now, and Gohmert's saying, hey, you're taking to the point of
[26:48.820 --> 26:53.140]  war, and now we need to start talking about that, but you know they're going to stage
[26:53.140 --> 26:56.180]  terror attacks and blame it on us.
[26:56.180 --> 27:01.220]  But along before we get to that point, they will trigger it, but we're now here, folks.
[27:01.220 --> 27:06.500]  Now listen to this sycophant, invert reality, listen to evil.
[27:06.500 --> 27:13.580]  You'd have to agree that now the impeachment inquiry is underway, sparked by a complaint
[27:13.580 --> 27:20.300]  from someone within the intelligence community, it feeds the president's concern, and often
[27:20.300 --> 27:24.980]  used term about a deep state, being there to take him out.
[27:24.980 --> 27:27.260]  Thank God for the deep state.
[27:27.260 --> 27:33.820]  Look at all those old spokes.
[27:33.820 --> 27:38.820]  This progression of diplomats and intelligence officers and White House people trooping up
[27:38.820 --> 27:43.060]  to Capitol Hill right now and saying, these are people who are doing their duty or responding
[27:43.060 --> 27:48.260]  to a higher call.
[27:48.260 --> 27:49.260]  It doesn't...
[27:49.260 --> 27:50.260]  I'm mad at it.
[27:50.260 --> 27:52.620]  Well, think about it for a minute.
[27:52.620 --> 27:58.380]  With all of the people who knew what was going on here, it took an intelligence officer to
[27:58.380 --> 28:06.060]  step forward and say something about it, which was the trigger that then unleashed everything
[28:06.060 --> 28:07.060]  else.
[28:07.060 --> 28:09.420]  Like the fake DT&Ds you guys made up, the CIA?
[28:09.420 --> 28:13.820]  Tell American people why that happens is this is the institution in the U.S. government
[28:13.820 --> 28:19.700]  that with all of its flaws, and it makes mistakes, is institutionally committed to objectivity
[28:19.700 --> 28:22.220]  and to telling the truth.
[28:22.220 --> 28:24.940]  It is one of the few institutions in Washington...
[28:24.940 --> 28:30.100]  One of the few we can trust is the leftist globalist running the CIA.
[28:30.100 --> 28:31.100]  Speak the truth.
[28:31.100 --> 28:34.420]  It's engraved in marble in the lobby.
[28:34.420 --> 28:38.220]  It's engraved in marble at the lobby.
[28:38.220 --> 28:39.220]  Wow.
[28:39.220 --> 28:42.940]  And they'll get rid of that new process for us and have all their minions come out and
[28:42.940 --> 28:46.300]  say, intimidate Trump supporters and physically attack them.
[28:46.300 --> 28:49.780]  Well, you know Mr. Tough Guy, none of these guys ever killed anybody themselves.
[28:49.780 --> 28:51.500]  They just gave the orders.
[28:51.500 --> 28:54.300]  And now they think they're going to whoop America's ass.
[28:54.300 --> 28:56.820]  They think they're going to piss on our grave.
[28:56.820 --> 29:01.900]  And all these guys, I mean, Brennan's a communist, say they want China to dominate us.
[29:01.900 --> 29:05.380]  No, son, your expiration date is up.
[29:05.380 --> 29:08.700]  You're going to get your card punched.
[29:08.700 --> 29:13.700]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[29:13.700 --> 29:17.660]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave
[29:17.660 --> 29:18.660]  my family to freedom.
[29:18.660 --> 29:23.540]  Today, we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool
[29:23.540 --> 29:26.660]  our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[29:26.660 --> 29:30.940]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real
[29:30.940 --> 29:32.540]  Estate team is here to help.

[30:36.380 --> 30:37.380]  I look better.
[30:37.380 --> 30:38.380]  Everybody notices.
[30:38.380 --> 30:45.820]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2, body's ultimate turmeric.
[30:45.820 --> 30:51.020]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the gut fusion from M4's life.
[30:51.020 --> 30:55.940]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.

[31:05.260 --> 31:06.900]  The sale's about to end.

[32:05.420 --> 32:10.860]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[32:10.860 --> 32:14.300]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[32:14.300 --> 32:20.700]  Well, that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems and people
[32:20.700 --> 32:22.380]  will like different formulas.
[32:22.380 --> 32:24.940]  It's just that simple.
[32:24.940 --> 32:30.020]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three
[32:30.020 --> 32:34.660]  types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine.
[32:34.660 --> 32:35.660]  Get both.
[32:35.660 --> 32:37.980]  They're both great for you, whichever one you like.
[32:37.980 --> 32:41.340]  Use that and give the other to family or friends.
[32:41.340 --> 32:43.420]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[32:43.420 --> 32:44.700]  That's why I harp on it.
[32:44.700 --> 32:48.980]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[32:48.980 --> 32:52.140]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long.
[32:52.140 --> 32:53.140]  It's simple.
[32:53.140 --> 32:57.860]  Get your high quality iodine at InfowarsStore.com and help fund the Infowars.
[32:57.860 --> 32:58.860]  InfowarsStore.com.
[32:58.860 --> 33:02.300]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[33:02.300 --> 33:04.220]  It's the iodine challenge.
[33:04.220 --> 33:12.340]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[33:12.340 --> 33:23.300]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:23.300 --> 33:30.100]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowar and say, I don't know what's going
[33:30.100 --> 33:37.140]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[33:37.140 --> 33:53.700]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:53.700 --> 33:59.260]  We don't want the committee with the most expertise on constitutional issues dealing
[33:59.260 --> 34:01.460]  with these constitutional issues.
[34:01.460 --> 34:11.260]  We want to put armed guards outside a hearing and have it in a secret compartmented information
[34:11.260 --> 34:19.740]  facility, and we're not going to let the other side call their own witnesses so we get a
[34:19.740 --> 34:25.380]  fair picture of what actually went on, and we're not even going to let them ask questions.
[34:25.380 --> 34:26.380]  We don't want them to ask.
[34:26.380 --> 34:35.100]  The little instructor witnesses not to answer, because you see, they want it to be a one-sided
[34:35.100 --> 34:43.620]  non-due process sham court, and it's about to push this country to a civil war if they
[34:43.620 --> 34:46.940]  were to get their wishes.
[34:46.940 --> 34:52.300]  And if there's one thing I don't want to see in my lifetime, I don't want to ever have
[34:52.300 --> 34:56.340]  participation in, it's a civil war.
[34:56.340 --> 35:03.860]  Some historian, I don't remember who, said, guns are only involved in the last phase of
[35:03.860 --> 35:06.580]  a civil war.
[35:06.580 --> 35:11.020]  What's gone on here has not protected the Constitution.
[35:11.020 --> 35:13.980]  It's not protected the institutions.
[35:13.980 --> 35:18.300]  It's not protected this little experiment in self-government.
[35:18.300 --> 35:25.820]  Know what it has done, has put it all at risk.
[35:25.820 --> 35:28.420]  Our nation and the world is in the middle of a crisis.
[35:28.420 --> 35:35.100]  There are populist rebellions against globalism, against these unelected kleptocracies happening
[35:35.100 --> 35:36.100]  everywhere.
[35:36.100 --> 35:41.180]  But Debo's two years ago said, Gigi Ping, a dictator of China can crush America.
[35:41.180 --> 35:45.580]  We've seen the massive chai-kong censorship of Hollywood and the publishing industry and
[35:45.580 --> 35:46.580]  so much more.
[35:46.580 --> 35:51.740]  Michael Savage had one of his best-selling books spiked by the chai-kongs.
[35:51.740 --> 35:57.020]  Michael Savage joins us, Dr. Savage, and we're very blessed to have him until the end of
[35:57.020 --> 35:58.020]  this hour.
[35:58.020 --> 36:01.020]  He's got a big event coming up at michaelsabbage.com.
[36:01.020 --> 36:05.740]  It's already sold out, but there's going to be online available.
[36:05.740 --> 36:08.700]  This is the type of thing you want to watch, where he gets into the mindset of being a
[36:08.700 --> 36:15.100]  conservative, living in San Francisco, and he can really speak to the madness, the mental
[36:15.100 --> 36:18.340]  disorder that is leftist.
[36:18.340 --> 36:23.220]  For now, convicted pedophiles lead drag queen story times for small children, so to talk
[36:23.220 --> 36:26.940]  about the state of the world right now and the peril this republic's in and the fact
[36:26.940 --> 36:32.340]  that this nation is fighting for our lives, Michael Savage, Michael, thanks for coming
[36:32.340 --> 36:33.340]  on with us.
[36:33.340 --> 36:37.580]  Well, Alex, you're the gladiator, and you keep on pounding the opposition here.
[36:37.580 --> 36:38.580]  I love it.
[36:38.580 --> 36:39.580]  How do you keep doing it?
[36:39.580 --> 36:40.580]  What are you taking?
[36:40.580 --> 36:43.460]  Well, you're the big botanist, but I do take a lot of stuff.
[36:43.460 --> 36:44.460]  You recommend.
[36:44.460 --> 36:48.380]  Seriously, wow, let's get this out of the way first, because it's so interesting, and
[36:48.380 --> 36:51.500]  it ties into the first question.
[36:51.500 --> 36:54.180]  You're the one that coined the term that liberalism is a mental disorder.
[36:54.180 --> 36:56.460]  You're doing a big speech about this.
[36:56.460 --> 36:57.940]  What the hell is their problem?
[36:57.940 --> 36:58.940]  Can't they see they're pushing?
[36:58.940 --> 37:05.420]  No, I have the book right in my hand, liberalism and mental disorder, I published in 2006.
[37:05.420 --> 37:07.100]  It wasn't meant to be sarcastic.
[37:07.100 --> 37:09.380]  I wasn't Jonathan Swift.
[37:09.380 --> 37:12.420]  I knew exactly what I was talking about only.
[37:12.420 --> 37:15.980]  I didn't know it was a terminal mental disorder.
[37:15.980 --> 37:17.820]  I thought it was curable.
[37:17.820 --> 37:21.860]  The problem is liberalism is an incurable mental disorder, and I am not talking about
[37:21.860 --> 37:27.180]  decent, kind, reasonable liberals of the Voltarian kind.
[37:27.180 --> 37:30.420]  I may disagree with you, but I'd fight to the death you're right to say.
[37:30.420 --> 37:35.500]  Remember that beautiful saying by Voltaire, those days are long over.
[37:35.500 --> 37:39.220]  It's no longer I may disagree with you when I fight to the death you're right to say it.
[37:39.220 --> 37:44.700]  The progressives of today, who are the fascists of today, say I may disagree with you, but
[37:44.700 --> 37:48.220]  I will kill you rather than let you say another word.
[37:48.220 --> 37:49.620]  We are at the Civil War.
[37:49.620 --> 37:52.860]  There used to be a thing called the Cold War, Alex.
[37:52.860 --> 37:56.660]  We're way past the Cold War because they're fighting a hot war.
[37:56.660 --> 38:00.860]  They try to attack you in restaurants, as they've done to various people in the media,
[38:00.860 --> 38:02.820]  myself included.
[38:02.820 --> 38:08.900]  How unusual is it for a man my age, a law-abiding citizen, a man with higher degrees?
[38:08.900 --> 38:14.220]  With a decent family, man who pays too much in taxes for so many years, been working since
[38:14.220 --> 38:15.860]  I'm five years old?
[38:15.860 --> 38:19.820]  Why do I have to go to a restaurant with pepper spray and a loaded gun, Alex?
[38:19.820 --> 38:20.820]  Why is that?
[38:20.820 --> 38:23.860]  Because these people are homicidal maniacs.
[38:23.860 --> 38:28.300]  Well, all I can say is, you know, give me liberty, I'll give you their death because
[38:28.300 --> 38:29.300]  I'm not going down.
[38:29.300 --> 38:30.300]  They are.
[38:30.300 --> 38:31.300]  I'm not going to live this way.
[38:31.300 --> 38:37.340]  They're not stealing my country from me under the guise of the hysterical left-wing madness.
[38:37.340 --> 38:43.100]  So yeah, I did an event the other night at a private club in San Francisco for about
[38:43.100 --> 38:44.100]  a hundred people.
[38:44.100 --> 38:46.180]  It was closed to the public, thank God.
[38:46.180 --> 38:49.620]  So these psychos couldn't even, they didn't know where it was.
[38:49.620 --> 38:54.940]  And I did a video of it, Alex, called, it's at SavageNationLive.com, it's about an hour
[38:54.940 --> 38:58.260]  long, it hasn't been posted yet, it will be at the end of the day.
[38:58.260 --> 39:03.740]  And we had about a hundred people, one table of ten, no one knew who they were, they asked
[39:03.740 --> 39:09.060]  Brad and Timothy, our active duty special ops guys, people I had met.
[39:09.060 --> 39:13.700]  Then, yeah, why do I tell you, Alex, these are the best people on earth, right?
[39:13.700 --> 39:15.620]  But do you know what's going on in this country?
[39:15.620 --> 39:20.700]  Here are guys who have given up, let's say, fortunes.
[39:20.700 --> 39:23.900]  These guys are smart enough to have done anything in their lives.
[39:23.900 --> 39:25.540]  Let's all agree with that.
[39:25.540 --> 39:30.620]  If you're airborne, if you're a special ops, you could do anything in your life, right?
[39:30.620 --> 39:32.260]  But they devote their life to the nation.
[39:32.260 --> 39:36.420]  They give their life for the nation, they'll take a bullet for the nation.
[39:36.420 --> 39:41.140]  So here they are, no one knows who they are, but you could see that they look better and
[39:41.140 --> 39:46.340]  stronger than everybody else there with their wives or lady friends.
[39:46.340 --> 39:47.980]  And they were an anonymous group.
[39:47.980 --> 39:54.100]  I learned that the left is so activated in this country now that they have hunted down
[39:54.100 --> 39:59.660]  the home addresses and school addresses of the children of these people.
[39:59.660 --> 40:05.340]  It's exactly what went on in Vietnam after the communists took over South Vietnam.
[40:05.340 --> 40:09.580]  It's exactly what went on during the purges of the Hitler years.
[40:09.580 --> 40:12.860]  It's exactly what went on during Stalin's purges.
[40:12.860 --> 40:17.180]  And if these scumbags don't understand that we know who they are, they're living in a
[40:17.180 --> 40:19.380]  dream world.
[40:19.380 --> 40:21.140]  That's the world we're living in.
[40:21.140 --> 40:23.780]  And how do they cover their tracks?
[40:23.780 --> 40:29.900]  Now by attacking a white heterosexual Christian man named Donald Trump.
[40:29.900 --> 40:34.500]  Now, this may be controversial, but I could give a damn less.
[40:34.500 --> 40:38.900]  It dawned on me, it dawned this morning, that the whole attack on Trump is being driven
[40:38.900 --> 40:40.780]  by racism.
[40:40.780 --> 40:46.060]  And I tweeted this this morning, attacks on Trump based on racism.
[40:46.060 --> 40:51.620]  White heterosexual Christian male, recall all of Obama's scandals, $170 billion to
[40:51.620 --> 40:53.860]  Iran, where did the dollars come from?
[40:53.860 --> 40:56.540]  No outcry from anti-white male media.
[40:56.540 --> 40:57.540]  Want more?
[40:57.540 --> 41:02.620]  And I have at least 20 more scandals of the first mixed race president, Barack Hussein
[41:02.620 --> 41:06.860]  Obama, who was untouchable because of his mixed race background, which is why he was
[41:06.860 --> 41:07.860]  handpicked.
[41:07.860 --> 41:10.660]  They knew he could get away with destroying the Constitution.
[41:10.660 --> 41:12.980]  Okay, so now we have Trump.
[41:12.980 --> 41:17.300]  He's not committed any impeachable offense whatsoever.
[41:17.300 --> 41:23.700]  The impeachable offense was committed by Nancy Golosi, a gangster, a gangster running
[41:23.700 --> 41:30.300]  a gang whose consigliore is Adam Shipless, a man without a country.
[41:30.300 --> 41:34.500]  That's who has committed the impeachable crimes.
[41:34.500 --> 41:38.340]  And we the people are supposed to sit here like dunces and putzes and let them steal an
[41:38.340 --> 41:39.340]  election from us.
[41:39.340 --> 41:40.340]  No way.
[41:40.340 --> 41:41.340]  It's not happening.
[41:41.340 --> 41:44.420]  They're not stealing the presidency from us.
[41:44.420 --> 41:47.380]  And that's why it's perfect that you're here today, we're some pot of co.
[41:47.380 --> 41:49.220]  We didn't talk before you came on.
[41:49.220 --> 41:53.500]  They've been bullying us, attacking us, anti openly works for Soros and others.
[41:53.500 --> 41:58.020]  They openly are targeting law enforcement, special operations, the FBI, they've openly
[41:58.020 --> 41:59.020]  targeted me.
[41:59.020 --> 42:00.020]  I have to have home security.
[42:00.020 --> 42:01.020]  They've folks, they've been there.
[42:01.020 --> 42:02.820]  I'm not going to get into it.
[42:02.820 --> 42:06.420]  These are terrorists and they know it and they believe they're about to up the violence
[42:06.420 --> 42:08.220]  to using firearms.
[42:08.220 --> 42:12.980]  And as you said, even special operations has been now laced by the left.
[42:12.980 --> 42:15.260]  And you say, oh, well, the antifa is not a threat.
[42:15.260 --> 42:16.260]  They're a bunch of wimps.
[42:16.260 --> 42:17.260]  No, they've got MS-13.
[42:17.260 --> 42:18.900]  They've got other criminal groups.
[42:18.900 --> 42:22.420]  They've got Hezbollah now synced up with Obama and the deep state.
[42:22.420 --> 42:27.060]  And they plan on making a run at this country and Civil War, Michael Savage, you're absolutely
[42:27.060 --> 42:28.060]  right.
[42:28.060 --> 42:31.900]  I want to talk to you when we come back about how you think we can stop this, what Trump
[42:31.900 --> 42:32.900]  should do.
[42:32.900 --> 42:33.900]  But I think you just said it.
[42:33.900 --> 42:37.580]  We have to recognize this is the fight of our lives, America fighting for its life and
[42:37.580 --> 42:40.460]  people better decide what they're going to do and whose side they're on.
[42:40.460 --> 42:41.980]  Is that what you're saying, Michael Savage?
[42:41.980 --> 42:45.460]  I'm saying they're not antifa, they're nazifa.
[42:45.460 --> 42:46.460]  Let's be very clear.
[42:46.460 --> 42:48.820]  Let's start using their tactics.
[42:48.820 --> 42:51.020]  They are racists.
[42:51.020 --> 42:53.700]  They are absolutely terroristic.
[42:53.700 --> 42:54.700]  And they are nazifa.
[42:54.700 --> 42:56.740]  They're not the good guys.
[42:56.740 --> 42:58.500]  They wear the black hats.
[42:58.500 --> 43:03.500]  And this is what I spoke about at the private dinner at Savage Nation Live dot com.
[43:03.500 --> 43:08.100]  Let's talk about it right now with Michael Savage.
[43:08.100 --> 43:12.420]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[43:12.420 --> 43:14.300]  I don't care what your views are.
[43:14.300 --> 43:17.540]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[43:17.540 --> 43:18.540]  That's important.
[43:18.540 --> 43:19.860]  But we have something in common.
[43:19.860 --> 43:23.980]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[43:23.980 --> 43:29.500]  Clinton deep state bag man Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied
[43:29.500 --> 43:31.140]  to Congress in the world.
[43:31.140 --> 43:35.620]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get
[43:35.620 --> 43:36.620]  indicted.
[43:36.620 --> 43:42.020]  But the word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him from my new home in New
[43:42.020 --> 43:43.020]  Zealand.
[43:43.020 --> 43:49.660]  I will oh and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[43:49.660 --> 43:51.580]  Not so fast criminal.
[43:51.580 --> 43:55.260]  We're going to bring you to justice and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well
[43:55.260 --> 44:00.220]  because if we don't you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[44:00.220 --> 44:04.460]  But the American people know how much you hate us and we're fighting back at info wars dot

[45:09.620 --> 45:16.140]  The Alex Jones show a few days ago my 11 year old daughter came to me and she had her digital
[45:16.140 --> 45:17.140]  textbook.
[45:17.140 --> 45:21.780]  She said dad they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and
[45:21.780 --> 45:26.660]  it says the 2 billion people have low IQs are mentally retarded on the planet earth
[45:26.660 --> 45:28.100]  because they didn't get enough iodine.
[45:28.100 --> 45:31.780]  That's what you say all the time but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not
[45:31.780 --> 45:36.460]  true but dad it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what
[45:36.460 --> 45:37.460]  you said.
[45:37.460 --> 45:42.100]  And I said I know honey that's why I have you take the high quality nutraceutical grade
[45:42.100 --> 45:47.540]  iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant it's why you're so alive it's it's one of

[45:52.100 --> 45:58.580]  age and it just really blew her away to read it there for herself to know that 2 billion

[48:06.540 --> 48:14.220]  media promotes them and we have this letter that Thomas Everson wrote his daughter that
[48:14.220 --> 48:21.220]  Ivanka Trump retweeted yesterday surrounded by enemies and spies catching and perverting
[48:21.220 --> 48:27.740]  every word that falls from or flows from my pen and inventing where facts failed them
[48:27.740 --> 48:32.620]  they're making their move they admit they're making their move and conservatives and nationalists
[48:32.620 --> 48:37.780]  and patriots better stop living in denial doesn't matter if it makes Trump more popular
[48:37.780 --> 48:42.340]  trying to impeach them they're going for the jugular and two former CIA directors Brennan
[48:42.340 --> 48:48.260]  and McLaughlin on TV yesterday said we're running this we're proud of ourselves our
[48:48.260 --> 48:53.900]  former adjuncts are the ones testifying we're removing him and Brennan had this psycho face
[48:53.900 --> 48:59.420]  like he was in a psycho movie Dr. Michael Savage is with us right now pointing out the point
[48:59.420 --> 49:03.500]  we're out of wanting to get into what he thinks we should do what he thinks Trump should do
[49:03.500 --> 49:08.260]  Trump's announcing fireside chats that's not enough I think emergency messages to the
[49:08.260 --> 49:14.020]  public I chat again Alex please I've said this on my own show I said at the dinner
[49:14.020 --> 49:19.340]  the other night someone's misadvising the president and how to respond to these criminals
[49:19.340 --> 49:25.300]  stop with the nice guy and the fireside chats he's not FDR that's not his style it's only
[49:25.300 --> 49:30.380]  going to make him look weak he's got to look stronger not weaker and when the enemy tries
[49:30.380 --> 49:34.780]  to take you down a guy like him he should the last thing you should do is get weak
[49:34.780 --> 49:39.980]  and not worry about Jake Tapper he's a low I agree so he should march into shift secret
[49:39.980 --> 49:44.940]  committee and say I'm the man being accused I want to face my accuser well that would
[49:44.940 --> 49:50.500]  be nice I think shift should be taken out in handcuffs who the hell is he who is this
[49:50.500 --> 49:55.460]  low-grade lawyer that suddenly thinks he's the president of the United States or the
[49:55.460 --> 49:59.980]  consigliore to the crime family that wants to take over the United States how long have
[49:59.980 --> 50:04.700]  I said on my show and I saw this before it came out in the news today that they're trying
[50:04.700 --> 50:10.460]  to decapitate the leadership so Pelosi can become president I know people that's crazy
[50:10.460 --> 50:15.540]  I said it's four weeks ago guess we read this morning we heard it on MSNBC yesterday
[50:15.540 --> 50:20.580]  one of their stooges said let's try to take down trumpet CNN to ABC doctor you must have
[50:20.580 --> 50:25.460]  missed it it's now the new talking point well I said it's four weeks ago of course there's
[50:25.460 --> 50:30.580]  a fly in their ointment which is that even if they did succeed in this Trump gets to
[50:30.580 --> 50:35.580]  appoint the new vice president before he leaves should he be removed but they don't understand
[50:35.580 --> 50:40.340]  the niceties of parliamentarianism since they are authoritarians and they don't understand
[50:40.340 --> 50:44.580]  anything but absolute power and greed look we have a civil war in the country there may
[50:44.580 --> 50:49.140]  not be a shooting civil war right now they have started the civil war in the civil war
[50:49.140 --> 50:54.660]  and some of us know it some of us don't know it eventually we will all know it and the criminals
[50:54.660 --> 50:59.980]  need to be exposed for their criminality now again I have to tell you why I'm on the show
[50:59.980 --> 51:04.700]  you say well it's self-interest yes it's self-interest I did a show the other night in a private
[51:04.700 --> 51:10.740]  location in a club in San Francisco and I did a videotape of it which can be downloaded
[51:10.740 --> 51:16.580]  at SavageNationLive.com for probably the cost of a beer it's not a money maker it covers
[51:16.580 --> 51:21.060]  the cost of the dinner but the hundred people who were lucky enough to get in there heard
[51:21.060 --> 51:25.900]  the real savage most of it was humorous incidentally Alex I used a lot of humor you want to hear
[51:25.900 --> 51:28.780]  the opening line in the club I do but let me just stop you because I'm gonna stop you
[51:28.780 --> 51:32.660]  right now the fact that you are literally Trump wouldn't have got elected we would have already
[51:32.660 --> 51:37.460]  lost if you hadn't been there mobilizing people along with Matt Drudge and a few others myself
[51:37.460 --> 51:42.820]  I'm not trying to brag but let's do credit where we should celebrate the fact that you're
[51:42.820 --> 51:46.660]  still fighting they've tried to take you off the air to take your sponsors you get physically
[51:46.660 --> 51:52.460]  attacked have to carry a gun so do I now damn right people should be downloading it and
[51:52.460 --> 51:58.100]  having parties and watching it and celebrating what you've done well I don't know about that
[51:58.100 --> 52:01.980]  I know this Trump put his arm around me shortly after he was elected at Mar-a-Lago which was
[52:01.980 --> 52:08.620]  in December of that year I went I went there and he saw me I went up to him the Secret
[52:08.620 --> 52:13.300]  Service tried to keep me away and he waved him away he was in the early days no no no
[52:13.300 --> 52:17.300]  he put his arm around me and loudly proclaimed I wouldn't be president without this man it
[52:17.300 --> 52:22.500]  was a great moment a really great moment and you know Alex I had a hot dog with the president
[52:22.500 --> 52:26.540]  on Air Force One about four weeks ago I've told the story over and over again even though
[52:26.540 --> 52:32.220]  I've been critical of many of his policies that I have been I'm not Sean Hannity I never
[52:32.220 --> 52:37.580]  learned how to do a shoe polish on my tongue maybe that's something he learned at his
[52:37.580 --> 52:42.420]  parents knees I was taught to be independent and I've criticized the president where I
[52:42.420 --> 52:47.340]  thought he was wrong such as his abrupt withdrawal from Syria and the emphasis on the word abrupt
[52:47.340 --> 52:53.620]  I was surprised that I was even allowed near him but he's a true gentleman and not only
[52:53.620 --> 52:58.260]  a gentleman but a very kind sensitive man I don't want to go into the details the real
[52:58.260 --> 53:04.980]  Trump is very very soft and smart and only soft in a wimpy way he's a human being I mean
[53:04.980 --> 53:09.400]  you saw it the way just I saw it the way he offered me his food from his own plate which
[53:09.400 --> 53:13.780]  sounds odd doesn't it I don't know any other world leader who would do that because they're
[53:13.780 --> 53:20.220]  usually they don't have a centella of humility in them what I'm getting at is the man that
[53:20.220 --> 53:25.820]  I know and the man that most people know is the opposite of what the vermin in the media
[53:25.820 --> 53:31.980]  are portraying him as being he is the least racist president I have remembered reading
[53:31.980 --> 53:37.020]  about the things he has done do you know that he was the first I think one of the first
[53:37.020 --> 53:43.620]  private club owners to open his club to LGBT people over the objections of many people
[53:43.620 --> 53:46.660]  don't give him credit for what he actually is they well he was the first to open the
[53:46.660 --> 53:51.020]  clubs up to blacks and others and he gets crapped on and lot about but it scares them
[53:51.020 --> 53:55.380]  to have people like Kanye West coming out now and saying we're getting off the Democrat
[53:55.380 --> 53:59.940]  plantation I think that's why they're launching their attacks so hard why do you think the
[53:59.940 --> 54:03.740]  deep state is flipping out I think it's because they know they're they're beginning to lose
[54:03.740 --> 54:09.580]  the culture war Dr. Savage what is the deep state we used to call them something else
[54:09.580 --> 54:13.980]  what do we call them the establishment right yes let's go back to the original word the
[54:13.980 --> 54:19.980]  people who really run the show the money people the financial institutions who basically own
[54:19.980 --> 54:24.860]  the media that would include Rupert Murdoch I mean let's not mince words oh fox has gotten
[54:24.860 --> 54:29.340]  really bad yeah they all bet on China and they can't believe America this horse is coming
[54:29.340 --> 54:32.820]  back from behind at the end so they're out there shooting at the horse so we don't win
[54:32.820 --> 54:41.260]  the damn race so the big money the media money etc. doesn't like the outsider everyone in
[54:41.260 --> 54:47.500]  the media portrays Trump as part of the establishment but that's the exact opposite of who he is
[54:47.500 --> 54:51.580]  yeah McCain was the opposite of a Maverick Trump is a Maverick you could put it that
[54:51.580 --> 54:57.180]  way I wonder how any man can take this amount of hatred this is the one thing we should
[54:57.180 --> 55:05.180]  talk about another time the psychological pain the psychological damage they are doing to
[55:05.180 --> 55:10.860]  this man is actually it's inhuman I don't know how he does it I don't know how Michael
[55:10.860 --> 55:15.100]  you know how he does it you've been attacked just as bad over the years so you do it because
[55:15.100 --> 55:20.180]  you know how evil they are 25 years that's a quarter of a century of how to live in hiding
[55:20.180 --> 55:25.220]  I have almost no friends but you know what it's a price I have chosen to pay for the
[55:25.220 --> 55:30.500]  job that God put me here to do people say bullcrap savage you're doing it for the money
[55:30.500 --> 55:34.820]  let me tell you something I grew up poor and I have some money which I earned every penny
[55:34.820 --> 55:40.340]  of I'm basically still a poor man with money and so I still think like a poor man so let
[55:40.340 --> 55:45.380]  me I've been stalking you for 20 something years I know you made your giant fortune in
[55:45.380 --> 55:50.060]  books and in trailblazing the whole modern supplement movement that we literally fund
[55:50.060 --> 55:54.060]  ourselves from that's why I admire you and that's why I am kissing your ass here on here
[55:54.060 --> 55:58.300]  because you deserve it for what you've done no no it's all true so I'm not getting down
[55:58.300 --> 56:02.460]  at your shoe polish that may be toxic you'd better be very careful and take another supplement
[56:02.460 --> 56:06.900]  to but look Alec I like to joke around a lot I gotta give you the opening line to these
[56:06.900 --> 56:11.540]  to the show to make everyone happy you're ready it's a savage nation like I'm okay so
[56:11.540 --> 56:16.140]  I walk into the club people cheer don't know some of them knew me most didn't I was like
[56:16.140 --> 56:20.740]  a freak coming into this private liberal club many paid to just see me talk and they got
[56:20.740 --> 56:25.900]  a dinner for it very very low price so he says as Groucho Mark said I would never join
[56:25.900 --> 56:29.940]  a club that would have me as a member I said now look around and you'll see why he was
[56:29.940 --> 56:36.140]  right that was a funny line private club where I was a member don't you think absolutely
[56:36.140 --> 56:41.100]  it was very good it's hilarious okay so what I'm saying is I made it very light I used
[56:41.100 --> 56:50.740]  my God given sense of humor to bridge bridge the hard right the hard left the hard realities
[56:50.740 --> 56:56.380]  from the hard lies I try to use humor which is the greatest leavening agent Alex I don't
[56:56.380 --> 57:01.660]  know that there's room for humor in this age of mass hysteria this age of mass hysteria
[57:01.660 --> 57:08.340]  right now is it a fever pitch all the left nose is lies the seat and hate and the one
[57:08.340 --> 57:14.020]  behind it all is who who is the one behind it all all we could say Soros so we could
[57:14.020 --> 57:20.180]  say Pelosi's gang it's us letting them do it who is it though who is it the devil who
[57:20.180 --> 57:26.580]  is it who's behind this Satan's real well even if it's a metaphor it's as real as Pelosi's
[57:26.580 --> 57:32.500]  tongue even if Satan is a metaphor it's as real as Dr. Savage I know you've got to go
[57:32.500 --> 57:36.660]  but this is a two minute break you've got to do five more minutes and and give the President
[57:36.660 --> 57:41.420]  Trump solutions because I know he tunes into my show he tunes into what you do so I'm drafting
[57:41.420 --> 57:45.620]  you stay there two minutes we'll be right back with Michael Savage I have the solution

[58:12.620 --> 58:17.220]  you guys talking about living defense let me tell you something man I had an internal
[58:17.220 --> 58:21.660]  digestive problem and I stuck with it for about five or six years and the doctors they
[58:21.660 --> 58:26.500]  tried every test nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing
[58:26.500 --> 58:30.220]  you and Dr. Group and those commercials I said you know what I'm gonna get me some of that
[58:30.220 --> 58:33.420]  freaking living defense now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional because they don't
[58:33.420 --> 58:38.180]  want you to have it but I ordered it had it shipped to me I got it I hid it from the nurses
[58:38.180 --> 58:43.660]  I started taking it man that stuff changed my life it saved my life if there's any veteran

[59:00.860 --> 59:06.180]  ask me Alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's because different
[59:06.180 --> 59:12.220]  types of physiologies different types of metabolic systems and people will like different formulas
[59:12.220 --> 59:18.380]  it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because
[59:18.380 --> 59:25.180]  some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both
[59:25.180 --> 59:29.900]  they're both great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family
[59:29.900 --> 59:35.900]  or friends bottom line iodine is essential that's why I harp on it the globalist want
[59:35.900 --> 59:41.380]  you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower IQ makes you sluggish you don't live
[59:41.380 --> 59:46.780]  as long it's simple get your high quality on info store dot com and help fund the info

[1:00:51.420 --> 1:00:54.940]  i gave and you know it pays for putting the event on ladies and gentlemen they're trying
[1:00:54.940 --> 1:00:58.960]  to bankrupt info wars we used to have extra money to do stuff i haven't been paid in over
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:02.260]  a year and a half i don't care about that but i want money to keep fighting they're
[1:01:02.260 --> 1:01:08.780]  shutting everybody down so we need to patronize and support the people telling the truth and
[1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:12.140]  i know you're doing it folks so whether it's michael sabers or info wars they took all
[1:01:12.140 --> 1:01:15.900]  our sponsors this show was top rated everywhere they went and got his sponsors to try to take
[1:01:15.900 --> 1:01:20.180]  him off the air and he's not going to whine about it he keeps fighting so it's a mirror
[1:01:20.180 --> 1:01:25.020]  reaction he says wise trump keep fighting sabers asks how do you keep doing it the same damn
[1:01:25.020 --> 1:01:29.660]  reason these people are pissing all over me and attacking me i can't give up and it proves
[1:01:29.660 --> 1:01:34.300]  how bad they are it makes me fight harder quite frankly i thrive off of it like the president
[1:01:34.300 --> 1:01:38.620]  says michael sabers thanks for staying with us you've got four minutes what does the president
[1:01:38.620 --> 1:01:43.580]  need to do your president your message to trump and your message to america and the world
[1:01:43.580 --> 1:01:49.940]  well my tweet is do what they're doing to him all the i'm saying this here's what i say
[1:01:49.940 --> 1:01:57.980]  attacks on trump based on racism he is the symbol of white males heterosexual christian
[1:01:57.980 --> 1:02:06.540]  people here we had the first mixed race president barack obama who did at least 20 different
[1:02:06.540 --> 1:02:13.540]  scandalous things some of which were impeachable whether it was the irs targeting obama's enemies
[1:02:13.540 --> 1:02:18.980]  that was more impeachable than the alleged withholding of funds from ukraine which is
[1:02:18.980 --> 1:02:25.500]  a laugh altogether there was the irs targeting obama's enemies there was been gazi there
[1:02:25.500 --> 1:02:31.820]  was the va hospital scandal where people were dying in the hall there was the cylindra scandal
[1:02:31.820 --> 1:02:38.140]  tie that into polosi's family anyone know the connection i can give you all of the others
[1:02:38.140 --> 1:02:42.940]  now obama's no longer president so that's not the right track to take it's an illustrious
[1:02:42.940 --> 1:02:50.220]  it's a point of illustration of how this operates which is the media is 100% racist towards white
[1:02:50.220 --> 1:02:55.540]  people and it's mainly run by white people which of course is is the game that's how
[1:02:55.540 --> 1:02:59.380]  they get away with it they make believe that they're not one of them you get it to keep
[1:02:59.380 --> 1:03:04.220]  them away from their doors that's why a woman like nancy polosi has the nerve to give speeches
[1:03:04.220 --> 1:03:09.380]  at valedictorian speeches at berkeley and say be a disruptor you hear this a billionaire
[1:03:09.380 --> 1:03:14.420]  who lives on top of pacific heights with arm security guards says be a disruptor you hear
[1:03:14.420 --> 1:03:18.060]  this a city where people crap in the streets while you're eating in a restaurant and i'm
[1:03:18.060 --> 1:03:23.100]  told she doesn't even use a car she flies to the restaurant in her backyard not too long
[1:03:23.100 --> 1:03:27.740]  ago and as i'm eating i look out a man drops his pants and defecates on the sidewalk it's
[1:03:27.740 --> 1:03:33.100]  not a laughing matter it's an example of what a liar she is and so is feinstein this is

[1:06:58.580 --> 1:07:04.700]  a chance to say because he was so on fire uh he was pissed but also very direct and
[1:07:04.700 --> 1:07:11.380]  saying we're in a civil war it's that they're trying to make it go into a shooting war and
[1:07:11.380 --> 1:07:17.860]  trump needs to march into shifts fake hearing as the president as the person being accused

[1:07:41.020 --> 1:07:46.100]  give me another transcript of the changes for you they've got orders to set the president
[1:07:46.100 --> 1:07:50.580]  up and they think his word against all the other witnesses in the transcripts of him
[1:07:50.580 --> 1:07:55.740]  talking to the ukrainian president you think trump would go i'm a businessman and you give
[1:07:55.740 --> 1:08:02.580]  me something for something he never talks like that that's unbelievable that's how the
[1:08:02.580 --> 1:08:08.980]  democrat crooks talk five senators one of his dead mccain are on record saying you do
[1:08:08.980 --> 1:08:17.060]  what we want or we'll cut back the money the vice president biden's on tv going listen

[1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:55.020]  are quotes so they can have their corrupt media hype all their zombie followers to try

[1:09:58.740 --> 1:10:05.260]  said no we've been exposed where we live where we work by government employees that are
[1:10:05.260 --> 1:10:11.780]  feeding antifa and they are targeting people just in general if you're in ice or you're
[1:10:11.780 --> 1:10:18.940]  in the FBI or you are in in delta force or you're in the still team six or any of that
[1:10:18.940 --> 1:10:24.220]  stuff you have been identified in a database hell opama gave the chai comms the officer
[1:10:24.220 --> 1:10:30.340]  personnel management hack he completely sold us out the chai comms are quarterbacking this
[1:10:30.340 --> 1:10:37.940]  with diane feinstein you just heard savage talk about it there's no limit to the level
[1:10:37.940 --> 1:10:54.220]  they won't go this is it you just heard savage trumps in deep trouble because he is good
[1:10:54.220 --> 1:11:01.300]  trudge trumps in deep trouble so that trump will stop listening alex jones trumps in
[1:11:01.300 --> 1:11:09.580]  deep trouble the blood's already in the water so that trump will get aggressive because let
[1:11:09.580 --> 1:11:15.700]  me tell you something my ass in america's ass your ass your children's ass the world's
[1:11:15.700 --> 1:11:25.500]  ass is hanging out with president trump i love him to death love him like a son a father
[1:11:25.500 --> 1:11:29.420]  oh you have a family member and when you see somebody doing something you care about that
[1:11:29.420 --> 1:11:40.500]  isn't going to turn out good you get pissed at him and i don't like having to start thinking
[1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:48.980]  about the physical end of this stuff because i'm not scared and my brain starts at part
[1:11:48.980 --> 1:11:55.660]  of my brain starts talking and the voice gets bigger and it's smart and it's mean and it
[1:11:55.660 --> 1:12:03.780]  knows what to do and it's done it for generations and it's just waiting to be turned loose begging
[1:12:03.780 --> 1:12:15.660]  to be turned the satisfaction of just a good clean fun and you watch those devil worshipers
[1:12:15.660 --> 1:12:19.660]  simulating murdering babies and you watch the pedophiles openly parading with our children
[1:12:19.660 --> 1:12:27.220]  and laughing that they've captured our standard because they have captured our standard and
[1:12:27.220 --> 1:12:34.580]  they're trying to invoke us into war with them because they're losing the information
[1:12:34.580 --> 1:12:40.260]  war and they know it so they're uncloking themselves now hoping we go into a physical
[1:12:40.260 --> 1:12:46.380]  confrontation we don't want that but here's the problem they're going to stage more mass
[1:12:46.380 --> 1:12:55.580]  shootings with their antifa operatives and they're going to blame them on us and they're
[1:12:55.580 --> 1:12:59.500]  going to try to kill the president and they're going to pull a lot of other stuff and so
[1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:08.540]  we have to be honest about the world we're entering and there's something else very
[1:13:08.540 --> 1:13:15.140]  key here you have to understand that Pelosi and Schiff are all just slaves they don't
[1:13:15.140 --> 1:13:22.620]  call the shots they have the deep state behind people like Brennan threatening them with scandals
[1:13:22.620 --> 1:13:26.140]  in jail time if they don't do this Pelosi was shaking when she did it she knows it's
[1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:37.620]  criminal she could barely talk they don't know what to do and that's it and they're
[1:13:37.620 --> 1:13:47.660]  scared they're put there because they're weak this is all intimidation game we just want
[1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:50.740]  prosperity but the globalists don't I'm going to go to break come back with these clips

[1:21:07.380 --> 1:21:12.500]  and the singing of birds could be heard in the moment of silence as the preacher opened his
[1:21:12.500 --> 1:21:21.300]  bible to read and then a little old man stood up bent with age his hair thin and white and said
[1:21:22.340 --> 1:21:30.500]  preacher tell them that satan is real too you can hear him in songs that give praise to idols
[1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:37.220]  and simple things of this world you can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart
[1:21:38.260 --> 1:21:45.860]  I know that satan is real for once I had a happy home I was loved and respected by my family
[1:21:46.500 --> 1:21:55.780]  I was looked upon as a leader in my community and then satan came into my life I grew selfish
[1:21:55.780 --> 1:22:02.580]  and unneighborly my friends turned against me and finally my home was broken apart
[1:22:03.460 --> 1:22:11.620]  my children took their paths into a world of sin yes preacher it's sweet to know that god is real
[1:22:12.260 --> 1:22:19.300]  and to know that in him all things are possible and we know that heaven is a real place where
[1:22:19.300 --> 1:22:30.180]  joys shall never end but center friend if you're here today satan is real too and hell is a real
[1:22:30.180 --> 1:22:37.300]  place a place of everlasting punishment that is the loving brothers I thought we'd play that for
[1:22:37.300 --> 1:22:43.300]  TV viewers specifically with the uh tranny the man dressed up as a demon calling himself a woman
[1:22:43.940 --> 1:22:47.060]  stimulating the murder of a baby but don't worry we've got all these states passing laws to kill
[1:22:47.060 --> 1:22:51.860]  babies after they're born that's the left answer to saying you won't kill babies before they're born
[1:22:51.860 --> 1:22:57.540]  well we'll just kill them after see how you like that and here's hillary clinton on with trevor
[1:22:57.540 --> 1:23:03.940]  noah asked about well you know they've come out with the autopsy jeffrey epstein the pedophile
[1:23:03.940 --> 1:23:09.380]  trafficker for hillary that's right her foundation had got caught smuggling kids out of Haiti that
[1:23:09.380 --> 1:23:15.620]  were getting killed as well well she thought it was really funny so here here is the demon laughing
[1:23:15.620 --> 1:23:27.700]  how did you kill jeffrey epstein because you you you're not in power but you have all the power
[1:23:29.540 --> 1:23:36.100]  I really need to understand how you do what you do because you seem to be behind everything
[1:23:36.100 --> 1:23:45.940]  nefarious and yet you do not use it to become president what is the game plan well trevor
[1:23:46.740 --> 1:23:51.220]  what is what but honestly though what does it feel like being the bogeyman of the right
[1:23:52.180 --> 1:24:00.100]  well it's it's a constant surprise to me oh yeah because the things they say and now of course
[1:24:00.100 --> 1:24:08.100]  it's on steroids with uh being online are so ridiculous beyond any imagination that I could
[1:24:08.100 --> 1:24:16.420]  have and yet they are so persistent in putting forth these crazy ideas and theories honestly I
[1:24:16.420 --> 1:24:23.540]  don't know what I ever did to get them so upset I don't know what I ever did to get them so upset
[1:24:23.540 --> 1:24:30.980]  she took out of college a job defending pedophiles specifically that had brutally raped little girls
[1:24:32.100 --> 1:24:35.140]  until their guts came out I don't want to be gross but I've had the women in the studio
[1:24:36.020 --> 1:24:40.900]  and then the audios her talking about how much fun it was making jokes saying she knew her clients
[1:24:40.900 --> 1:24:45.860]  were guilty then she got caught trying to frame Richard Nixon on the watergate committee she's
[1:24:45.860 --> 1:24:51.540]  famous for that and then all the deaths in Arkansas all the corruption all the sellouts going to
[1:24:51.540 --> 1:24:56.980]  ruining libya destabilizing it blowing it up and saying I came I saw he died and then standing
[1:24:56.980 --> 1:25:01.380]  down at Benghazi and let everybody get killed helping start the whole era of spring and turning
[1:25:01.380 --> 1:25:09.460]  ISIS and al-qaeda loose and everything else she's done she doesn't know why anybody didn't like her
[1:25:09.460 --> 1:25:14.740]  and rigging the debates and now it turns out you know demanding all the republican ads be banned
[1:25:14.740 --> 1:25:18.980]  on the internet and twitter does it and following all these lawsuits against me and calling me the
[1:25:18.980 --> 1:25:22.820]  dark heart and saying I should be taking off the air and tackling the first amendment saying ban the
[1:25:22.820 --> 1:25:28.580]  guns and saying black people are animals like dogs have to be brought to heal these are quotes
[1:25:33.140 --> 1:25:38.740]  she just honestly has no idea because it's so funny that her and her husband flew around with
[1:25:38.740 --> 1:25:43.380]  Epstein and he used these little kids to get people set up for them and that's what they've been known for
[1:25:43.380 --> 1:25:51.380]  for and clinton's settled three rape case lawsuits her husband
[1:25:54.580 --> 1:25:58.180]  and now she's got Pelosi trying to impeach the president so Pelosi can become president
[1:25:58.180 --> 1:26:02.580]  and appoint her vice president and i told you that two years ago a year ago we have all the clips
[1:26:02.580 --> 1:26:07.860]  want me to plan for you i love savages but i said that four weeks ago oh well roger stone said before
[1:26:07.860 --> 1:26:14.660]  trump got an office he said if he wins they'll try to impeach him and Pelosi will make her vice
[1:26:14.660 --> 1:26:21.620]  president it'll have an election she'll win because they never give up because they've never been
[1:26:21.620 --> 1:26:28.020]  brought to justice saw this meme wherever you're afraid to swim out the others just remember
[1:26:28.020 --> 1:26:31.300]  you're statistically more likely to be killed by hillary clinton than by a shark
[1:26:31.300 --> 1:26:42.900]  and then the woman presided over the sanctions under obama and her clinton before that a shadow
[1:26:42.900 --> 1:26:48.260]  president before and the state department head after that two million extra iraqi's died under
[1:26:48.260 --> 1:26:57.220]  their sanctions they were three times worse than w w's daddy's hw no food no medicine iraq had had
[1:26:57.220 --> 1:27:02.500]  a huge population bloom since the 60s with oil they could only produce about a third the food they
[1:27:02.500 --> 1:27:08.820]  needed a couple million people died starvation a lot of it most of them kids half a million back
[1:27:08.820 --> 1:27:13.620]  in the middle of it and madeline albright said it's a good price to pay like you know how good's
[1:27:13.620 --> 1:27:18.900]  that fried chicken well it's finger licking good that's how good it is and i could talk about her
[1:27:18.900 --> 1:27:26.020]  crimes for a thousand years we're gonna give the number out we're gonna go to break we're gonna
[1:27:26.020 --> 1:27:30.900]  take your calls eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine on what's happening but let's
[1:27:30.900 --> 1:27:36.420]  go out to break with louis gomer saying civil wars don't start with shooting it comes at the end
[1:27:36.420 --> 1:27:42.420]  and we're entering that wheelhouse now this is real criminals are coming for you they want to
[1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:48.980]  conquer america and what people fought and bled to create it was paid for in blood and they think
[1:27:48.980 --> 1:27:58.500]  it's gonna have to be bought out of bankruptcy and foreclosure by blood we better work hard
[1:27:58.500 --> 1:28:04.900]  in the information war before you gotta start paying in blood i'm ready i'll pay with every
[1:28:04.900 --> 1:28:12.100]  damn drop i've got but i'm gonna fight hard before i gotta do it pay up folks here's gomer
[1:28:12.820 --> 1:28:18.660]  we don't want the committee with the most expertise on constitutional issues dealing with
[1:28:18.660 --> 1:28:27.780]  these constitutional issues we want to put arm guards outside a hearing and have it in a secret
[1:28:27.780 --> 1:28:38.340]  compartmented information facility and we're not gonna let the other side call their own witnesses
[1:28:38.340 --> 1:28:44.420]  so we get a fair picture of what actually went on and we're not even gonna let them ask questions
[1:28:44.420 --> 1:28:49.620]  we don't want them to ask we'll instruct the witnesses not to answer because you see
[1:28:51.620 --> 1:29:01.460]  they want it to be a one-sided non-due process sham court and it's about to push this country to a
[1:29:01.460 --> 1:29:09.220]  civil war if they were to get their wishes we can all agree these are troubled times right

[1:33:50.260 --> 1:33:54.900]  arrogant we got trump in we've got populace getting in all over the world there's obviously patriots
[1:33:54.900 --> 1:34:00.820]  inside the government intelligence agencies and corporations who are helping as much as they
[1:34:00.820 --> 1:34:08.660]  can but they're not directing any of this is all literally an organic human push and the globalists
[1:34:08.660 --> 1:34:15.540]  are scared because they could feel it it's only beginning to power up we've got to push it the
[1:34:15.540 --> 1:34:20.980]  enemy could just feel it because every action also has its psychic action in the universe the enemy
[1:34:20.980 --> 1:34:26.100]  is you can hear the air raid sirens they can see the push back by people that don't want to serve
[1:34:26.100 --> 1:34:32.580]  satan and don't want this anti-human post-human world and they knew this resistance was coming
[1:34:32.580 --> 1:34:39.700]  but they thought they had it the bag and now as humanity and our spirit powers up the enemy is
[1:34:39.700 --> 1:34:51.060]  launching its counter offensive but we've got to hold fire here on the physical confrontation
[1:34:51.060 --> 1:35:00.340]  as bad as it is the enemy is trying to trick us into violent outbursts by their physical attacks
[1:35:00.340 --> 1:35:08.660]  we have to have information warfare attacks and peaceful physical action and we are entering
[1:35:09.380 --> 1:35:18.500]  the time of civil disobedience not violent action but civil disobedience and i mean
[1:35:18.500 --> 1:35:22.020]  50 000 people
[1:35:25.860 --> 1:35:32.500]  should be outside of those committee hearing rooms just chanting that it's a fraud and it's not due
[1:35:32.500 --> 1:35:40.180]  process that the president needs to be able to face his accusers and we need individuals leaking
[1:35:40.180 --> 1:35:45.460]  from inside mainstream media and corporate media and establishment enemy media and we just need
[1:35:45.460 --> 1:35:50.420]  wherever you're at in any way or talking to your neighbor or going and talking to your pastor or
[1:35:50.420 --> 1:35:53.700]  getting up in front of the church and if your church doesn't want you getting up talking about the
[1:35:53.700 --> 1:35:59.700]  evil in the world and confronting it then it's not a church it is a government globalist controlled
[1:35:59.700 --> 1:36:08.420]  demon that's simple and there it's it's gonna it's gonna get very clear ladies and gentlemen
[1:36:08.420 --> 1:36:17.460]  for everyone that they should have fought this earlier
[1:36:22.820 --> 1:36:28.740]  because appeasement of something this evil does not go well that's how evil works there
[1:36:28.740 --> 1:36:33.860]  can be long periods where you appease evil by increment and it's it's it's satisfied
[1:36:33.860 --> 1:36:37.700]  it's not really satisfied it's patient
[1:36:40.020 --> 1:36:45.460]  and it's got a long-term game to binge you like george sorrow said the new york times last
[1:36:45.460 --> 1:36:49.700]  friday he said we're gonna bend the will of the american people
[1:36:54.500 --> 1:37:01.060]  he said the american people are bending and he said and i intend to bend them to my will you like
[1:37:01.060 --> 1:37:09.220]  that you like him been in your will he's not been in my will
[1:37:16.180 --> 1:37:17.220]  gonna bend your will
[1:37:21.060 --> 1:37:23.220]  you gonna go with him
[1:37:23.220 --> 1:37:36.980]  because all he is is a general of satan that means he's a wraith he's a loser he's a slug
[1:37:36.980 --> 1:37:50.180]  he's a lure on the end of a fishing line he's not even an errand boy
[1:37:53.940 --> 1:38:01.540]  he's the dim little light on the end of an angler fishes lure
[1:38:01.540 --> 1:38:09.460]  there is no choice but to fight them and again
[1:38:12.500 --> 1:38:19.220]  people say what do you do well if you print up business cards and put info wars calm forbidden
[1:38:19.220 --> 1:38:26.500]  information and hand out a few hundred of those a week and all of you did that it would change the
[1:38:26.500 --> 1:38:34.180]  world or had your own website that sends people to forbidden information and said hey this is
[1:38:34.180 --> 1:38:38.660]  what they don't want to know this is the truth and you know so many other places and things say
[1:38:38.660 --> 1:38:44.660]  that but this really is those like guys we all know it it's not alex jones it's not you it's not
[1:38:44.660 --> 1:38:51.860]  michael sabers it was on it's not all the other guests it's not it's all of us this is the fount
[1:38:51.860 --> 1:39:03.540]  we're right in the center of the resistance planted right dead smack in the middle of the
[1:39:03.540 --> 1:39:08.580]  globalist trying to take over texas and then the entire midwest and they'll link up with chicago
[1:39:08.580 --> 1:39:15.220]  and austin as the crime syndicate takeover of what's left of the country i mean the un came in here
[1:39:15.220 --> 1:39:19.460]  20 years ago with all the globalist investment said they would take over austin first they have
[1:39:19.460 --> 1:39:23.620]  triangle models then dallas then houston then san antonio then all the outlying towns
[1:39:25.060 --> 1:39:28.580]  how they then bring in a quote migrants from all over the world and build
[1:39:28.580 --> 1:39:34.260]  10 story buildings in little towns and then bring them in and then run people for office and take
[1:39:34.260 --> 1:39:39.700]  over your towns i mean this is an invasion right before obama left he put tens of billions into
[1:39:39.700 --> 1:39:45.540]  funding he's saying that oh rural areas are racist because they're white many areas we're going to
[1:39:45.540 --> 1:39:50.900]  import people into the rural areas but what he really means is their political takeover
[1:39:51.620 --> 1:39:55.620]  and they're going to bring the poor minority slaves they've already got on their plantation
[1:39:56.260 --> 1:40:02.820]  out of their big reeducation camps that are the cities led by little leftist priesthood leaders
[1:40:03.380 --> 1:40:10.340]  who are the white social workers who will then come and lead the minorities into your area and
[1:40:10.340 --> 1:40:14.500]  teach them your evil and teach them your bad and teach them that they're the boss as long as they're
[1:40:14.500 --> 1:40:18.580]  anti-white i mean that's the plan and you heard michael sabbage talk about it earlier
[1:40:21.540 --> 1:40:25.620]  and that's why when you're around a leftist that's got a job in government they'll laugh
[1:40:25.620 --> 1:40:32.260]  at you when you tell them this because they know all of it they go to mal meetings millions of them
[1:40:32.260 --> 1:40:39.620]  they they dream of how they're going to torture patriot men in prisons and stomp your guts out
[1:40:39.620 --> 1:40:46.260]  and rape your children they have converted them first they don't believe in god then they brainwash
[1:40:46.260 --> 1:40:51.220]  them then they get them hateful against christians and conservatives and they go by the way we're into
[1:40:51.220 --> 1:40:55.540]  witchcraft and stuff and suddenly they feel this feeling they were so empty because instead of
[1:40:55.540 --> 1:41:00.500]  not having god and just having nothing now they've got the devil and they go and they just they
[1:41:00.500 --> 1:41:06.500]  convert like that it's a factory they take lost wimps and they load them into the meat grinder
[1:41:06.500 --> 1:41:13.460]  and they come out satanist on the other side and they have been promised power over you and they've
[1:41:13.460 --> 1:41:20.660]  been promised man flesh that simple
[1:41:25.700 --> 1:41:30.100]  and no matter how crazy that sounds go into any leftist event and it's suddenly women going

[1:51:29.780 --> 1:51:35.700]  of wax how that would go another kettle of fish that's a new country right there that's
[1:51:38.180 --> 1:51:42.900]  uncharted territory except history repeats itself we know exactly what'll happen
[1:51:44.580 --> 1:51:49.140]  we know several different scenarios that will unfold with combinations of one another
[1:51:49.140 --> 1:51:55.700]  and it's not fun but these little crazies think well no one ever punished us so we'll keep pushing war
[1:51:55.700 --> 1:52:01.060]  and civil war and race war and death and pedophilia and satanism and collapsing everything and our
[1:52:01.060 --> 1:52:07.140]  cities will be open sirs that's okay because no one ever punishes them except our lack of action
[1:52:07.140 --> 1:52:13.300]  against them will allow them to do so bad they collapse everything and cause a giant civil war
[1:52:13.300 --> 1:52:19.140]  and they'll be stacked up like dead cordwood but it won't matter because they're scum we don't want
[1:52:19.140 --> 1:52:29.220]  that to happen a real civil war kicks off i give it 50 million dead nuclear reactors melting down
[1:52:29.220 --> 1:52:34.980]  you name it i mean the us is going to be a slaughterhouse all these demons claim they want a bunch of
[1:52:34.980 --> 1:52:39.940]  blood and death well you know when the good guys start dealing it's always about a hundred times
[1:52:39.940 --> 1:52:44.340]  worse you guys can imagine because while you're torturing and smiling over some bloody baby you're
[1:52:44.340 --> 1:52:49.940]  raping hundreds of you'll be wiped out for every baby you've killed so
[1:52:54.420 --> 1:53:00.660]  i don't want this to happen but this isn't rhetoric this isn't like oh there's a breeze of
[1:53:00.660 --> 1:53:06.900]  civil war and and physical war here it's a hurricane already the globalists are like
[1:53:06.900 --> 1:53:14.260]  mentally retarded monkeys on pcp with flamethrowers in their hands lit running through a fireworks
[1:53:14.260 --> 1:53:27.220]  factory with sparklers sticking out of their areas and we're already a mess we already killed 60
[1:53:27.220 --> 1:53:32.740]  million babies we already kill babies after the born we are a demonic mess
[1:53:35.540 --> 1:53:39.780]  we're hitting the bottom of the decadent cycle and most countries don't get out of it without a
[1:53:39.780 --> 1:53:47.940]  giant bloodbath fountains of blood a thousand feet high spouting and so all these good old boys have
[1:53:47.940 --> 1:53:52.420]  been buying your guns over the years and well whatever kicks off i'm gonna i'm gonna get a
[1:53:52.420 --> 1:53:57.460]  bunch of liberals that's like saying if you let a dog crap in your yard for a year you're gonna
[1:53:57.460 --> 1:54:01.540]  run out there one day and stomp on all the dog turds all you had to do was go get the neighbor
[1:54:01.540 --> 1:54:06.260]  to keep their damn dog in their backyard or come clean it up but instead you're always piling guns
[1:54:06.260 --> 1:54:23.540]  up and going one day i'll stop that dog crap truth is if god blew up the whole planet we deserve
[1:54:23.540 --> 1:54:28.100]  but there's a lot of innocent people on the planet and god's got a plan for us so god has held back
[1:54:28.100 --> 1:54:36.500]  but let me tell you we deserve whatever's coming to us so just get right with god and stop worrying
[1:54:36.500 --> 1:54:41.780]  about dying and then you're not gonna care about what leftists say about you're not gonna care about
[1:54:41.780 --> 1:54:48.580]  what's in the newspaper every time they lie about me and do horrible things it just confirms how evil
[1:54:48.580 --> 1:54:53.780]  they are and that i'm on the right path and that means i must be hurting them so again i take their
[1:54:53.780 --> 1:55:02.180]  attacks as guidance systems just like a missile hones in on a radar dish or on the exhaust port
[1:55:02.180 --> 1:55:08.740]  of an aircraft and i go where the bullets are coming from i use them it's my only eyesight
[1:55:08.740 --> 1:55:15.380]  and so it's the only thing true the enemy does is their lies is their attacks that's how you guide
[1:55:15.380 --> 1:55:19.780]  into what they don't like what they want you to get away from and the pedophilia and the devil
[1:55:19.780 --> 1:55:24.020]  worship is what they don't want to go close and what they really don't want to discuss because
[1:55:24.020 --> 1:55:29.060]  it's who they are hillary can't even hide herself look at her in these videos on tv
[1:55:31.140 --> 1:55:35.620]  i mean she's a frightening looking woman look at her when she was a young mob boss's
[1:55:35.620 --> 1:55:42.900]  daughter in chicago a little snake but still evil but now she's drunk on a lot of blood
[1:55:42.900 --> 1:55:51.300]  i mean that is a full blown devil worshiper right there i know the folks that have worshiped satan
[1:55:51.300 --> 1:55:56.100]  with her we've had them on and people went and dug out news articles and actually found it
[1:55:56.100 --> 1:56:04.900]  hillary clinton worship satan she drinks blood she rapes children period a lot of folks are like
[1:56:04.900 --> 1:56:10.420]  yeah we know she does it's all coming out aren't you scared i'm scared of not fighting her because
[1:56:10.420 --> 1:56:17.780]  god will send me to a freaking dimension to be locked up with her if i do not oppose her
[1:56:18.500 --> 1:56:21.060]  i am scared to death she doesn't come after me
[1:56:23.620 --> 1:56:31.940]  i absolutely could care less except i want to expend my energy in their annihilation
[1:56:31.940 --> 1:56:42.180]  the head of her foundation got caught smuggling hundreds of children out of Haiti that were
[1:56:42.180 --> 1:56:47.540]  disappearing being turned into walnut sauce
[1:56:52.100 --> 1:56:59.140]  you're like this isn't this is insane yeah they sit around farmhouses and have full meals with
[1:56:59.140 --> 1:57:06.740]  little kids body parts they're completely psychotic ladies and gentlemen and they think
[1:57:06.740 --> 1:57:11.620]  because they're so evil that you can't deal with it because they're so powerful because they do this
[1:57:16.660 --> 1:57:21.700]  it's the raw exercise of power and they believe they're invincible and they're not
[1:57:23.460 --> 1:57:28.580]  so i got a bunch of the clips together the one we found was roger and i back in january
[1:57:28.580 --> 1:57:36.820]  this year laying out exactly how they do it but you know hillary ran out of college her father said

[1:57:40.820 --> 1:57:44.660]  the torsion rape kids or death they get caught sometimes she went down there and wallowed around

[2:00:46.980 --> 2:00:52.500]  chicago mob boss that was their dad for daily he was the deputy to the most powerful mob boss
[2:00:52.500 --> 2:00:58.180]  probably in america proceeds the mob is italian you mean break that's just one branch of organized
[2:00:58.180 --> 2:01:04.740]  crime and she was sent down to arkansas to little rock in the hot springs because the main
[2:01:04.740 --> 2:01:11.300]  capital of the chicago mafia was really arkansas going back to about 1900 and if you go there
[2:01:11.300 --> 2:01:15.460]  they'll tell you that there's museums and that's where they really lived and where they produced
[2:01:15.460 --> 2:01:23.220]  during the prohibition the white lightning at an industrial scale and shipped it out in so-called
[2:01:23.220 --> 2:01:28.980]  bottle water containers and so that's what i'm saying i mean she was sent down there at right
[2:01:28.980 --> 2:01:34.180]  out of college trained by the mafia then put in the cia i mean she's really bad i'm not talking
[2:01:34.180 --> 2:01:37.860]  about it anymore i'm gonna go to your phone calls i apologize but at least we got them loaded up here
[2:01:37.860 --> 2:01:43.700]  brandon ingestion ralph and matt incurz and daniel allen and christen jeff and chris will at least
[2:01:43.700 --> 2:01:52.020]  get to all those callers uh let's go ahead now and let's talk to brandon in washington dc from deep
[2:01:52.740 --> 2:01:58.740]  in the swamp thank you what is your view of all this happening hey alex uh i go to georgetown
[2:01:58.740 --> 2:02:07.780]  university and i was down by the capital yesterday and they had marines standing by and i was asking
[2:02:07.780 --> 2:02:14.100]  what was going on and they said they were doing a drill and it was basically a riot control drill
[2:02:14.820 --> 2:02:20.020]  and this is on the hill yesterday was the vote whether or not they're going to move forward
[2:02:20.020 --> 2:02:26.820]  with the impeachment inquiry and then as i was leaving i saw fbi agents directing the whole thing
[2:02:27.860 --> 2:02:34.500]  and i shot video on my phone and they approached me and told me to delete it and i asked them if
[2:02:34.500 --> 2:02:40.340]  they were detaining me and they said that under the ndaa they don't need to read me my right
[2:02:40.980 --> 2:02:47.700]  or formally charge me to detain me unless i deleted the video this is insane well
[2:02:49.620 --> 2:02:55.540]  they're under orders and the the problem is going into a real national emergency
[2:02:57.460 --> 2:03:01.780]  you could argue that's constitutional i'm not defending it but i'm telling you i know people
[2:03:01.780 --> 2:03:07.300]  that have talked to the trump he plans to call the marines out if this impeachment is done by the
[2:03:07.300 --> 2:03:11.700]  book and and the senate removes him he will go but if it if anything if any of his rights are
[2:03:11.700 --> 2:03:16.420]  violated or our rights are violated he has the marines standing by uh and that's why i think
[2:03:16.420 --> 2:03:20.660]  goldmerd's talking about a shooting war and how the democrats are pushing us into a shooting war
[2:03:20.660 --> 2:03:24.260]  because i'm telling you those discussions are now being had that's how much trouble the country
[2:03:24.260 --> 2:03:31.220]  is in brother and alex uh i have i have family who work high level in the pentagon i'll just
[2:03:31.220 --> 2:03:37.700]  leave it at that and one of my uncles who's retired marine corps was telling me that
[2:03:38.580 --> 2:03:44.900]  don't be surprised if trump activates the us marine corps to arrest these people and if you
[2:03:44.900 --> 2:03:52.020]  start seeing televised treason trials in the senate because these people are playing with
[2:03:52.020 --> 2:03:57.540]  trump and he's not playing around these people have lost their minds thinking that they're
[2:03:57.540 --> 2:04:02.900]  gonna have some type of coup d'etat in america and the american and why do you think gomerd
[2:04:02.900 --> 2:04:09.460]  got up and said i don't want this to happen but you're entering physical war territory you're
[2:04:09.460 --> 2:04:16.500]  entering a place with weapons yeah and so everybody listening i just want to say you better get
[2:04:16.500 --> 2:04:21.620]  right with god and you better choose a side because we ain't in kansas anymore stay there because
[2:04:21.620 --> 2:04:26.100]  you're you know i get so out of my mind angry at things i didn't look at all these callers and a
[2:04:26.100 --> 2:04:30.820]  lot of important things i want you to just calm down because i'm excited to you hear me even more
[2:04:30.820 --> 2:04:40.100]  upset than i am i understand why but when we come back i want you to just slowly in a few
[2:04:40.100 --> 2:04:45.700]  minutes i'm i know the other callers are happy for to hold to hear you and just lay out what you
[2:04:45.700 --> 2:04:50.820]  witnessed what you saw what they said to you and then i'm getting the articles from a month ago
[2:04:50.820 --> 2:04:57.700]  when trump did call the marines up for domestic national crisis i really unprecedented uh and
[2:04:57.700 --> 2:05:01.460]  we've had experts look at they say no this is unprecedented so brandon don't hang up back in
[2:05:01.460 --> 2:05:10.900]  60 seconds folks ask me alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's because
[2:05:11.460 --> 2:05:17.460]  different types of physiology different types of metabolic systems and people will like different
[2:05:17.460 --> 2:05:24.260]  formulas it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because
[2:05:24.260 --> 2:05:31.460]  some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both
[2:05:31.460 --> 2:05:37.700]  great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or friends bottom line
[2:05:37.700 --> 2:05:43.060]  iodine is essential that's why i harp on it the globalist want you to be deficient in it
[2:05:43.060 --> 2:05:48.900]  for a lot of reasons lower iq makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your
[2:05:48.900 --> 2:05:55.300]  high quality iodine in four store dot com and help fund the info war info war store dot com
[2:05:55.300 --> 2:05:59.780]  we've got a huge sale running right now but it's about to end it's the iodine challenge
[2:05:59.780 --> 2:06:13.700]  both types of iodine with selenium for 60 off together
[2:06:17.380 --> 2:06:23.060]  and it's about to push this country to a civil war if they were to get their wishes
[2:06:23.060 --> 2:06:30.980]  and if there's one thing i don't want to see in my lifetime i don't want to ever have participation
[2:06:30.980 --> 2:06:41.060]  in it's a civil war some historian i don't remember who said guns are only involved in the last
[2:06:41.060 --> 2:06:49.780]  phase of a civil war what's going on here is not protected the constitution it's not protected
[2:06:49.780 --> 2:06:56.500]  protected this little experiment in self-government know what it is done as put it all at risk
[2:06:57.860 --> 2:07:04.900]  it's friday november 1st 2019 i'm your host alex jones there's been a silent war taking out members
[2:07:04.900 --> 2:07:08.980]  of congress both republican and democrat that tried to empower the people and promote populism
[2:07:09.860 --> 2:07:14.740]  democratic party though now is the main engine of evil there's a lot of neocons being kicked out
[2:07:14.740 --> 2:07:21.780]  but here's the report from october 5th 2019 a little less than a month ago exclusive trump
[2:07:21.780 --> 2:07:26.980]  activates us marine reserves for emergency within the united states to stop illegal coup
[2:07:28.900 --> 2:07:36.180]  and we've since had a talk with folks at the highest levels of the planning for this and it is definitely
[2:07:36.180 --> 2:07:46.740]  for civil unrest it is definitely for a battle between branches of the government
[2:07:51.860 --> 2:07:57.860]  some of which the democrats in control of one half of the legislative branch
[2:07:58.660 --> 2:08:04.500]  are openly working for foreign powers exactly what they project on to trump and yours truly
[2:08:04.500 --> 2:08:12.980]  and others that are loyal informed conscientious americans who also saw the threat and built
[2:08:12.980 --> 2:08:24.340]  our own platforms to resist so brandon called in washington dc and i wanted to recap because
[2:08:24.340 --> 2:08:30.580]  some stations don't care that first five minutes what he saw what unfolded to take his time because
[2:08:30.580 --> 2:08:37.940]  it mirrors what we see here we'll also look into local news in dc about any marine drills but i
[2:08:37.940 --> 2:08:42.660]  already have witnessed increased marine presence when the president flies around the united states
[2:08:42.660 --> 2:08:48.420]  so we know this is going on but to physically see it and then what the fbi you said said said to you
[2:08:48.420 --> 2:08:52.260]  is is it is amazing brandon so please repeat what you said
[2:08:52.260 --> 2:09:03.540]  yes alex i was at the national mall and i saw what had to easily have been 200 to maybe 300
[2:09:04.100 --> 2:09:11.140]  marines and they were conducting drills but the people that were running the show were fbi agents
[2:09:11.780 --> 2:09:18.340]  and i had filmed some video after talking to one of the marines there and he said that they were
[2:09:18.340 --> 2:09:26.500]  doing a drill for civil unrest more specifically in the case of looters riots pretty much a
[2:09:26.500 --> 2:09:33.940]  ferguson or bolton more type of situation and this was the day that they took the vote in the
[2:09:33.940 --> 2:09:40.580]  house on whether or not they were going to impeach trump or move forward with it as i was leaving
[2:09:40.580 --> 2:09:48.980]  to get on the train to go back home i was approached by two fbi agents who basically took my phone uh
[2:09:48.980 --> 2:09:56.980]  threw me up against the wall and i asked them if i was under arrest and he told me that i don't have
[2:09:56.980 --> 2:10:01.380]  to read you your rights i don't have to tell you if you're formally charged with anything under the
[2:10:01.380 --> 2:10:09.140]  ndaa we could detain you for as long as we want and from talking to family members who work in the
[2:10:09.140 --> 2:10:17.540]  pentagon they have told me that to not be surprised if trump activates the marine court and arrests
[2:10:17.540 --> 2:10:24.180]  these people and if i start seeing televised treason trials in the senate because what they're
[2:10:24.180 --> 2:10:29.540]  doing is treason by every sense of the word and trump's not playing around with them now is that
[2:10:29.540 --> 2:10:33.460]  what you're saying or is that's what your family in the pentagon said that's what my family in
[2:10:33.460 --> 2:10:39.620]  the pentagon said well i mean here here's the issue they're violating due process and laws
[2:10:39.620 --> 2:10:44.100]  flagrantly they're the ones in bed with russia and china and have been caught selling us out
[2:10:44.900 --> 2:10:50.020]  and they keep putting forward fraud and they're saying intimidate the american people and they're
[2:10:50.020 --> 2:10:55.380]  taking thousands of prominent conservatives bank accounts away or merchant accounts they're trying
[2:10:55.380 --> 2:11:03.220]  to shut down the nra they have activated large portions of the cia mainly through foundations
[2:11:03.220 --> 2:11:10.420]  to harass patriot leaders and to harass trump's family and companies and so they're pushing
[2:11:11.220 --> 2:11:18.180]  a cold war that's now getting hot and so it's a dereliction of duty if trump doesn't start taking
[2:11:18.180 --> 2:11:24.420]  action the problem is the justice department is so full of lawyers and people appointed by the
[2:11:24.420 --> 2:11:29.460]  deep state by bush and bush senior and the clinton's and obama that they're a bunch of cowards trump
[2:11:29.460 --> 2:11:35.620]  believes the marines just like they did in uh the nazis almost overthrew roosevelt and then it
[2:11:35.620 --> 2:11:40.180]  was the marines were secretly activated the nazis were arrested it was kept quiet for morale issues
[2:11:40.180 --> 2:11:44.100]  but i can tell you i mean it's in the mccormick dickstein committee hearings they didn't publish
[2:11:44.100 --> 2:11:49.300]  all of it but more than five thousand people got killed got that they just the marines has killed
[2:11:49.300 --> 2:11:55.140]  people the president will issue death warrants and then they'll just go out and start killing people
[2:11:55.140 --> 2:12:00.340]  and so that's that's super dangerous too but that's where the globalists have taken this country
[2:12:01.380 --> 2:12:07.860]  and right it's just crazy now the bushes jump back when this before they started and said okay
[2:12:07.860 --> 2:12:12.500]  we're sorry we won't be with the nazis anymore and brown brother harriman and and we'll make a deal
[2:12:12.500 --> 2:12:17.380]  with you and we'll start the you know uh pro troop movements and all this stuff so uh and
[2:12:17.380 --> 2:12:22.180]  and guaranteed trumps given all these people a chance to stop going along with this attempted
[2:12:22.180 --> 2:12:26.660]  coup against america because it's not just about taking out trump that's only part of it it's about
[2:12:26.660 --> 2:12:31.300]  fully getting their foot back on the neck of america and that's why this is so dangerous what
[2:12:31.300 --> 2:12:36.100]  were the marines doing uh just uh like practicing for rioting i mean specifically what you see them
[2:12:36.100 --> 2:12:46.020]  doing they had riot shield and they also had uh i also saw un lake they had the un uh letters in
[2:12:46.020 --> 2:12:52.980]  white on the millet armored vehicles so i'm not a minute you're saying you saw un vehicles
[2:12:57.220 --> 2:13:04.340]  and the marines were basically they had riot shield and it looked like role players that they
[2:13:04.340 --> 2:13:11.940]  were basically detaining and this is right in plain sight and people were walking by like it was
[2:13:11.940 --> 2:13:20.420]  almost normal and so i'm not really sure if the marines have been given the green light by president
[2:13:20.420 --> 2:13:25.460]  trump well no i mean obviously they'd be going into the capital and grabbing people i just shows
[2:13:25.460 --> 2:13:36.420]  how crazy this is i anything else you'd like to add yeah i just can't believe how normal
[2:13:36.420 --> 2:13:43.220]  those fbi agents talked about basically disappearing me no judge no jury and it makes me wonder what
[2:13:43.220 --> 2:13:47.620]  are they doing going along with this because they're going to be the first ones the deep state kills
[2:13:47.620 --> 2:13:51.940]  once they get power sure because i mean if you're saying you saw un vehicles and i'm not saying you're
[2:13:51.940 --> 2:13:57.300]  lying but we haven't confirmed this we don't know if it's true then that would be some un operation
[2:13:57.300 --> 2:14:01.940]  but if the marines were involved the president would have learned of this so i really appreciate
[2:14:01.940 --> 2:14:07.140]  your call sir we need people to get footage of stuff like that and there's ways to do it
[2:14:08.500 --> 2:14:14.820]  obviously ladies and gentlemen we just go with the facts here and we know that trump has activated
[2:14:14.820 --> 2:14:20.180]  us marine reserves for emergency within the united states to stop illegal coup and we will repost that
[2:14:20.180 --> 2:14:24.500]  article to the front of info wars dot com i go to break them and come back and go to colors quicker
[2:14:24.500 --> 2:14:31.380]  but thank you brandon here's some drone footage of uh un vehicles in the us uh that we're being
[2:14:31.380 --> 2:14:35.780]  prepared but that was for overseas there are plans to try to use the un inside the united
[2:14:35.780 --> 2:14:40.580]  states obama openly announced that the strong city initiatives have them police the police
[2:14:42.420 --> 2:14:46.420]  but we don't know the specifics of what the caller was talking about i'm not doubting him i'm
[2:14:46.420 --> 2:14:52.900]  saying he's a liar i'm simply saying people will run with a rumor like that instead of going whoa
[2:14:52.900 --> 2:14:58.500]  trumps had to activate the marines for civil unrest it's unprecedented that was them almost a month
[2:14:58.500 --> 2:15:07.780]  ago but let's expand on that we know they're having a sham trial we know they're railroading
[2:15:07.780 --> 2:15:12.900]  we know they're twisting arms we know they're using spy agencies illegally to spy on the president
[2:15:12.900 --> 2:15:18.500]  and then leak this info so we're already in a civil war inside the government the shooting just comes
[2:15:18.500 --> 2:15:23.860]  at the end and i want to avert that as congressman gomer was saying i totally agree with that but
[2:15:23.860 --> 2:15:30.260]  without speculation or without believing that caller that is the world we're in now that's the
[2:15:30.260 --> 2:15:38.020]  wheelhouse show very serious situation and that's another reason i want a bigger budget to have a
[2:15:38.020 --> 2:15:42.180]  full-time dc bureau of at least three people to catch all the craziness going on out there and
[2:15:42.180 --> 2:15:47.220]  that's why when you buy the products in foreshore.com we can go from being tenuous to even stay at

[2:21:32.180 --> 2:21:38.900]  civil war and republicans saying we're in a civil war they've got our men not letting us in to
[2:21:38.900 --> 2:21:43.700]  secret fake hearings where they coach everybody and they're saying that they're gonna remove
[2:21:43.700 --> 2:21:48.820]  everybody all the judges trump put in everything they're gonna stop america and stop the election
[2:21:48.820 --> 2:21:56.580]  2016 and stop 2020 because they know that trump is gonna win 2020 his poll numbers go up above
[2:21:56.580 --> 2:22:03.220]  people say oh good he's raising lots of money oh internal polls show his way up with this fake
[2:22:03.220 --> 2:22:10.500]  impeachment they don't care that's why they have to be dealt with we're having a discussion
[2:22:10.500 --> 2:22:15.140]  about that alan what do you think and thanks for calling on friday hey alex how you doing i'm good
[2:22:15.140 --> 2:22:21.700]  brother i've been listening to you for 18 years and been with you since the beginning after 911
[2:22:22.900 --> 2:22:28.580]  i guess i just want to discuss two points first one with hillary about a year ago i was looking
[2:22:28.580 --> 2:22:33.700]  through the channels and one of the news stations the camera which one it was they had the president
[2:22:33.700 --> 2:22:39.700]  of hady on there just bashing the clinton's about how they stole money and all this other stuff
[2:22:40.340 --> 2:22:44.820]  and i don't know if you knew about this already but it just seems to me you guys could find that
[2:22:44.820 --> 2:22:50.500]  clip and just play it over and over again oh we sent crews to uh hady right after the hurricane
[2:22:50.500 --> 2:22:54.660]  hit and we interviewed state senators and others about the missing kids you know when i say hillary
[2:22:54.660 --> 2:23:02.100]  and these people have have tables full of flesh and blood and semen that's in the emails that we
[2:23:02.100 --> 2:23:09.540]  have the semen and the milk and other goodies for you and normal people go that just doesn't sound
[2:23:09.540 --> 2:23:16.340]  right because it's not right it's like it's like hbo is promoting sex with earthworms now
[2:23:16.340 --> 2:23:21.220]  they're doing it to degrade us and prepare us for horrors they're doing it to program us and
[2:23:21.220 --> 2:23:27.780]  to condition us for horrible things that are coming that's in the declassified cia cia documents
[2:23:28.820 --> 2:23:35.700]  how do you think we stop this i have no idea i mean i just i to me just eat and find clips like
[2:23:35.700 --> 2:23:40.580]  that and just you know play them over and over again just to show you know how bad that the
[2:23:40.580 --> 2:23:46.740]  clinton's have destroyed hady um you know and you know we've discussed about if the civil war is
[2:23:46.740 --> 2:23:52.900]  coming and the democrats do get this coup or civil war that they want what i'm kind of curious about
[2:23:52.900 --> 2:23:59.860]  is is who's going to follow through for these people because every level i know like runs from the
[2:23:59.860 --> 2:24:07.620]  site of a gun works for education government or social organizations and you know are just completely
[2:24:07.620 --> 2:24:13.060]  just emasculated so i'm just you know to me it seems like they think they're going to put out
[2:24:13.060 --> 2:24:16.820]  let me tell you don't get your view on this they think they're going to put out a script how it's
[2:24:16.820 --> 2:24:21.620]  us being violent they're going to have people stage false flags like the last two guys admitted
[2:24:21.620 --> 2:24:27.540]  antifa did it to get the guns and then they'll try to trick the apparatus of the military and
[2:24:27.540 --> 2:24:32.980]  police to do their jobs for them they never do the work they trick people like magicians with
[2:24:32.980 --> 2:24:39.540]  tricks to do their bidding does that make sense come down to guns i mean if you think about
[2:24:39.540 --> 2:24:44.500]  all you know you got the trucking business the farming business i mean all the blue color work
[2:24:44.500 --> 2:24:49.380]  i mean we could shut this country down you know in a day i know but but but here's what they have
[2:24:49.380 --> 2:24:54.260]  us off the air almost areas people don't know who the enemy is but people are getting the word
[2:24:54.260 --> 2:24:58.500]  and that's why getting the word out through underground networks to everybody about we
[2:24:58.500 --> 2:25:02.260]  don't want violence we don't want to have a physical civil war but if they start coming
[2:25:02.260 --> 2:25:08.820]  after our leaders or they start grabbing people everybody uh it's it's called moose hunting
[2:25:08.820 --> 2:25:15.300]  and you know up north 10 guys might put in a ticket to get a moose tag and but only one
[2:25:15.300 --> 2:25:21.220]  guy gets to go hunt moose i mean exactly if we move against them everybody just picks a moose
[2:25:22.020 --> 2:25:25.060]  you don't want to do anything violent just if they get violent there's a moose picked
[2:25:25.620 --> 2:25:30.340]  and then you know what happens and and then somebody goes does one thing in their life and
[2:25:30.340 --> 2:25:34.500]  they never do anything again all of our enemies are wiped out right there so i totally agree and i
[2:25:34.500 --> 2:25:38.900]  want to talk about this stuff i mean i i know all about it you know all about it everybody can
[2:25:38.900 --> 2:25:43.860]  research we can get you know caught up on that as our study stuff we don't want to go there because
[2:25:43.860 --> 2:25:50.580]  before we had to think about moose hunting we really really need to think about defeating
[2:25:50.580 --> 2:25:54.740]  the globalist the information war but yes they know we're beating them informationally so they
[2:25:54.740 --> 2:25:59.300]  want to trigger a physical confrontation so how do we thread the needle and not do that that's my
[2:25:59.300 --> 2:26:04.740]  question for you alan i don't know all i know is i feel like the people have the power i mean you
[2:26:04.740 --> 2:26:08.100]  know the people that are in these high positions really can't even fill up their own gas tank or
[2:26:08.100 --> 2:26:12.340]  buy their own food so i'm just kind of curious to how they're gonna you know implement something
[2:26:12.340 --> 2:26:16.420]  like this i mean if we're supposed to go after these global leaders why aren't we going after
[2:26:16.420 --> 2:26:20.820]  these global leaders why aren't why aren't we like you know you you have one of your guests saying
[2:26:20.820 --> 2:26:24.580]  you know if you tell us to go get sorrows we'll go get them or why aren't we going to get them i
[2:26:24.580 --> 2:26:28.980]  mean it's like let's just cut off cut the head off the snake and just do this you know why are we
[2:26:28.980 --> 2:26:32.740]  getting to the point where we're at well here's the deal soros has handed things over to alexander
[2:26:32.740 --> 2:26:36.900]  soros and then they've got all these foundations funded if something happens to them they continues
[2:26:36.900 --> 2:26:42.100]  on and they would spin that into them being martyrs instead we want to assassinate their name
[2:26:42.100 --> 2:26:47.140]  what they're doing to me and destroy their name take them and then use them as a symbol of what
[2:26:47.140 --> 2:26:52.580]  they are the enemy soros is a negative to their movement now and again i'm not evil but they've
[2:26:52.580 --> 2:27:00.020]  taken me made me able to their people and i'm a captured uh signet at least at their level uh that
[2:27:00.020 --> 2:27:04.020]  that they believe they've turned towards their use they've failed which means they might do the
[2:27:04.020 --> 2:27:07.860]  other thing which is you know fine uh if i see it coming i'll resist it but i'm not too worried
[2:27:07.860 --> 2:27:14.100]  about it quite frankly uh i mean so so again sir i hear what you're saying and i'm not going to tell
[2:27:14.100 --> 2:27:18.340]  you what to do but here's the thing they're going to start more false flags against themselves so
[2:27:18.340 --> 2:27:22.740]  we're never going to just shoot random innocent cops we're not going to attack the military we're
[2:27:22.740 --> 2:27:26.740]  not going to go after you know notice always the terror attacks are some innocent group getting hit
[2:27:26.740 --> 2:27:32.500]  because it's terrorist but if if things do get brutal i hope that doesn't happen and i'm not
[2:27:32.500 --> 2:27:39.780]  saying do it but there needs to be political command and control targets political command
[2:27:39.780 --> 2:27:45.940]  and control targets but don't worry we are showing our strength and we have woken up and educated
[2:27:45.940 --> 2:27:49.780]  people throughout every system you can imagine and they're going to make the decision if this
[2:27:49.780 --> 2:27:55.540]  goes much further to decapitate the globalist for us we're very close believe me believe me
[2:27:56.580 --> 2:28:01.300]  you don't you need to be ready in case that we fail i mean the folks you know higher levels
[2:28:01.940 --> 2:28:07.700]  but we're not going to fail my friend now it's a failure if we have to decapitate these individuals
[2:28:08.500 --> 2:28:12.900]  that goes to that we don't want to go there but that believe me that's that's prepared you can
[2:28:12.900 --> 2:28:17.460]  believe it santa claus has got a list and i'm not santa claus i'm not even an elf i'm just telling
[2:28:17.460 --> 2:28:22.260]  you santa claus has got santa claus has got that going on and mrs fiena claus and a lot of other
[2:28:22.260 --> 2:28:27.780]  folks i mean these guys have no idea sitting right next to them are people waiting for the order
[2:28:28.500 --> 2:28:33.780]  right next to them that are cooking their food taking care of their kids driving their cars which
[2:28:33.780 --> 2:28:39.460]  you are watching them right now brother this is america we don't go down easy they may have gotten
[2:28:39.460 --> 2:28:44.260]  all the lemmings brainwash that may make them look strong but we have the giant underground force

[2:32:57.700 --> 2:33:02.980]  of that living defense it's true folks we don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and
[2:33:02.980 --> 2:33:18.900]  living defense is over the top good you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:18.900 --> 2:33:28.820]  so
[2:33:32.420 --> 2:33:40.820]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:33:40.820 --> 2:33:53.300]  well you lived to see the chai comes and the hollywood scum and the new world order
[2:33:54.100 --> 2:33:58.980]  take a real run in america they thought they had it we just sleepwalk into total collapse
[2:33:59.860 --> 2:34:03.860]  but at the last minute enough patriots in the public and in the government just said this is
[2:34:03.860 --> 2:34:11.700]  insane when she's standing even pragmatists said that this is destructive even sociopaths went
[2:34:11.700 --> 2:34:16.100]  this is wrong unless you're a satanist unless you really like to mess good things up
[2:34:18.340 --> 2:34:21.540]  you know like uh just burning down a mansion for no reason
[2:34:22.580 --> 2:34:25.700]  or feeding the kids through a woodchipper because you like it it makes you feel big
[2:34:25.700 --> 2:34:26.980]  well it doesn't make me feel big
[2:34:29.140 --> 2:34:32.660]  it makes me want to hurt the people doing it because i have that instinct see i'm a
[2:34:32.660 --> 2:34:36.100]  person that likes to hurt people until they have a coming and then
[2:34:39.140 --> 2:34:46.420]  yeah i actually do enjoy it but i like taking big powerful people to think they are in command
[2:34:46.420 --> 2:34:53.300]  they who like to bully people i like to hurt them but what i like to really do is take their power
[2:34:53.300 --> 2:34:56.420]  away from them because that's all they've got power over other people that don't have any real
[2:34:56.420 --> 2:35:02.420]  power in themselves i said i'd take calls i'm gonna use caller like a segment i'm gonna move quick
[2:35:02.420 --> 2:35:05.060]  now to see caller make your point you're awesome i'm gonna move the next person you'll never get
[2:35:05.060 --> 2:35:07.620]  on i want to respect you and i'm trying to get back to the old days i can take a lot of calls
[2:35:07.620 --> 2:35:11.620]  let's just see if i can do it right now uh let's go ahead and go to kurt in oregon
[2:35:12.420 --> 2:35:18.980]  you're on the air go ahead kurt hey alex thanks for taking my call a uh i think if they pull off
[2:35:18.980 --> 2:35:24.260]  impeachment whether or not it's so-called legal as the little people which the elites like to call
[2:35:24.260 --> 2:35:30.900]  us the first thing we need to do is number one pull everyone's kids out of public schools and go on
[2:35:30.900 --> 2:35:38.580]  a tax strike immediately oh yeah they'll hate that and i get most people can't afford to even do that
[2:35:38.580 --> 2:35:45.700]  but you could do it as a strike right exactly and you know everyone with a small business um
[2:35:45.700 --> 2:35:51.940]  you know everyone that if you haven't been having your w4 withholding file for an extension
[2:35:51.940 --> 2:35:57.700]  immediate tax strike pull your kids out of school i don't know what else to do i mean we're uh
[2:35:57.700 --> 2:36:02.100]  well i know this the left starts going around the people's houses like tucker carlson starts killing
[2:36:02.100 --> 2:36:08.260]  people oh yeah folks don't need to go find the antifa and kill them the people that have been
[2:36:08.260 --> 2:36:13.940]  saying antifa is good and given the orders on the news need to get whatever antifa does to people
[2:36:13.940 --> 2:36:20.580]  needs to happen to them an i from an i and these lizards and suits man like they've been trying
[2:36:20.580 --> 2:36:26.260]  to trick us into fighting each other for a long time it's an old trick that's not a new trick
[2:36:26.260 --> 2:36:31.060]  it's an old trick and if they pull it off we all lose now you're right if you can see how they're
[2:36:31.060 --> 2:36:38.580]  trying to cause racial division and trump's been trying to counter it it's so obvious now i mean
[2:36:38.580 --> 2:36:42.980]  you wouldn't believe how many people i talked to that last year were like a little bit anti-gun a
[2:36:42.980 --> 2:36:47.300]  little bit this little bit that are now like oh crap dude we got to keep our guns like we got to
[2:36:47.300 --> 2:36:53.140]  pull our kids out of these public schools yeah it's everyone sees what's going on there's i mean
[2:36:53.140 --> 2:36:57.220]  i've been researching this stuff for a long time and i've never seen this many people
[2:36:57.860 --> 2:37:02.980]  like to have know what's going on kurt you're awesome and let me just say this that's what
[2:37:02.980 --> 2:37:09.540]  i'm seeing and that's why they're purposely in censoring us and purposely invoking all this
[2:37:09.540 --> 2:37:13.300]  evil in front of us because when you silence someone as kennedy said when you make peaceful
[2:37:13.300 --> 2:37:18.180]  revolutions impossible you make violent revolutions inevitable they're really trying
[2:37:18.180 --> 2:37:23.780]  to get us to be violent because we hear the children screaming under the weight of these monsters
[2:37:25.140 --> 2:37:29.940]  they want to trick us into a precipitous action because we're winning the information war and
[2:37:29.940 --> 2:37:35.140]  i wouldn't just say that if it wasn't true folks we can all see it and so we just have to control
[2:37:35.140 --> 2:37:41.060]  ourselves and not go out and start killing these people that are running this and doing this we
[2:37:41.060 --> 2:37:47.540]  have to hold fire and we have to just informationally hammer them as hard as we can absolutely and they
[2:37:47.540 --> 2:37:52.180]  know they're losing that that they know that that's why they're trying to get this into a physical
[2:37:52.180 --> 2:37:57.460]  fight and like everyone needs to understand like listen like i don't want to give away too much who
[2:37:57.460 --> 2:38:02.660]  i am but i worked on biden's secret service detail and i was in the military these lizards behind
[2:38:02.660 --> 2:38:10.020]  the curtain they're monsters just like you always talk about these people are monsters and everyone
[2:38:10.020 --> 2:38:15.300]  needs to understand we give them a third of our money or more and they don't represent us and if
[2:38:15.300 --> 2:38:20.260]  they impeach trump none of them represent us at that point and we should not be giving them any of
[2:38:20.260 --> 2:38:25.700]  our support any of our money we need to cut off their control over our children and over our money
[2:38:26.420 --> 2:38:29.700]  well i was all about to say this kirk if we're starting this new show we've already done a few
[2:38:29.700 --> 2:38:33.940]  of them where we have some of our best callers host the show and then they'll and then they'll open
[2:38:33.940 --> 2:38:37.780]  the phones up so please if you want to give us your name and number and host the show sometime
[2:38:37.780 --> 2:38:41.220]  is one of those folks where we're we're we're getting a bigger list of people so we can do
[2:38:41.220 --> 2:38:45.700]  again like 10 names and half of them we call can't do as we need like 20 30 names of folks who want
[2:38:45.700 --> 2:38:49.140]  to start that show and once we get some people that like to host it routinely they'll become the
[2:38:49.140 --> 2:38:54.420]  main host maybe three or four of them and then and then take calls but if you'd like to be involved
[2:38:54.420 --> 2:38:58.020]  please do that but but getting back to what you were saying about seeing them behind the scenes
[2:39:00.180 --> 2:39:04.660]  they don't act like humans and i used to hear this 25 years ago and didn't believe it i thought
[2:39:04.660 --> 2:39:09.540]  well they're like sociopaths but no i've talked to a lot of people i mean i personally am friends
[2:39:09.540 --> 2:39:14.100]  with three people that have guarded hillary clinton repeatedly long periods of time uh you know a few
[2:39:14.100 --> 2:39:18.340]  of them work here and they don't break their agreements to get into all but they go yeah no
[2:39:18.340 --> 2:39:24.420]  as she's i mean it's just like she is unbelievable and that's and i'm and it's exactly what you're
[2:39:24.420 --> 2:39:29.380]  talking about where she'll just like go into a trance for like an hour in a corner like she's
[2:39:29.380 --> 2:39:35.380]  a lizard just turn off sitting up turns with her eyes open or she'll just start going i hate you
[2:39:35.380 --> 2:39:41.380]  uh just like freaking out or if she sees a dog she'll go and sometimes flop around on the ground
[2:39:41.380 --> 2:39:46.340]  chewing carpet i mean and and and folks this isn't normal human behaviors not like they get mad or
[2:39:46.340 --> 2:39:52.980]  angry or whatever they are like robots except sometimes they blow up and they are tirelessly
[2:39:52.980 --> 2:40:00.100]  trying to hurt people yeah implode civilization uh sabotage humanity uh and that's their main
[2:40:00.100 --> 2:40:06.580]  mission and it's literally biblical is that what you're getting at yeah exactly they they hate creation
[2:40:06.580 --> 2:40:13.780]  they hate life they hate happiness it's in their ethos it's in their religion to destroy it and so
[2:40:13.780 --> 2:40:19.380]  they don't want us to figure out what our human destiny is they don't want us to figure out how
[2:40:19.380 --> 2:40:24.180]  powerful we really are that's why they still have to throw false flags they still need our consent
[2:40:24.180 --> 2:40:30.180]  to do these things they still need our consent and yeah just like you're saying about hillary going
[2:40:30.180 --> 2:40:35.540]  crazy i won't take too much of your time but i'll just say there's another code name that
[2:40:35.540 --> 2:40:41.620]  biden gets after he's been drinking so that they can lock all the girls up and keep them away from
[2:40:41.620 --> 2:40:45.780]  him they've got to lock away all the interns they call him by a different name on the radio
[2:40:46.500 --> 2:40:52.100]  for between secret service because he's so i mean come i mean everyone knows but i just thought i
[2:40:52.100 --> 2:40:57.460]  would like confirm that that i've got that from secret service and one of my buddies who's been
[2:40:57.460 --> 2:41:03.700]  to biden's house working with secret service so yeah well i mean what do people think the secret
[2:41:03.700 --> 2:41:07.380]  service is doing when their whole history they never leaked info and they leaked info to us but
[2:41:07.380 --> 2:41:11.780]  hillary having convulsions because they thought she was so dangerous people should know this i mean
[2:41:11.780 --> 2:41:16.420]  that's the good news is people have been around these democrats trump blows up sometimes people
[2:41:16.420 --> 2:41:21.300]  that work for him high level that have betrayed him or whatever and he calls people wimps and stuff if
[2:41:21.300 --> 2:41:25.940]  they say they're tired because he's like crazy 20 hours a day i mean trump is a wild man but other
[2:41:25.940 --> 2:41:30.100]  than that he's very nice to common people really nice to his crew but these democrats just treat

[2:48:10.180 --> 2:48:16.340]  everyone you know but this country is in a constitutional crisis and if the democrats
[2:48:16.340 --> 2:48:22.820]  try to illegally remove trump including with a sham unproperly executed violating the constitution
[2:48:22.820 --> 2:48:29.940]  impeachment they control the house they do it by fraud then we're in a military crisis as congressman

[2:49:04.660 --> 2:49:09.460]  and i'm stating something simple here but you are the only way the bridge to others for our local

[2:49:33.620 --> 2:49:39.220]  okay i um i called in yesterday and i just want to put a part two to this you're asked
[2:49:39.220 --> 2:49:44.820]  everybody's asking what can we do and i want to say this again reiterate this operation patriot
[2:49:44.820 --> 2:49:51.460]  revere worldwide the facts are that donald trump you michael savage and the like are the generals
[2:49:51.460 --> 2:49:58.180]  but every good leader in general knows that without an army it's impossible to win the war
[2:49:58.180 --> 2:50:04.900]  so what i would like to see is the release of the army i believe it's beyond info wars i beg
[2:50:04.900 --> 2:50:11.620]  you to do this alex i beg you to do this in an analogy the in the moravian revivals back in the
[2:50:11.620 --> 2:50:18.100]  day 25 of the people were missionaries 75 of the people funded the ministry of those missionaries
[2:50:18.100 --> 2:50:27.220]  and in that same spirit what i would like to see is uh operation patriot revere revere worldwide
[2:50:27.220 --> 2:50:37.060]  um with hats and shirts to galvanize the army together and make videos and creative ideas
[2:50:37.060 --> 2:50:42.820]  to influence the war right now in the first amendment phase sir i hear you i gotta jump
[2:50:42.820 --> 2:50:49.300]  jess i appreciate your call we're moving quick here we want children for prison uh would people

[2:50:53.860 --> 2:51:00.260]  fighting we're so late in the game here we need intelligence on the ground you go to any leptist
[2:51:00.260 --> 2:51:05.380]  event the infiltrate antifa you go show what they're doing then get it out on the internet send it
[2:51:05.380 --> 2:51:11.060]  to us action at info wars dot com go into hillary speeches she's all over the country running for
[2:51:11.060 --> 2:51:16.340]  president just hasn't announced it yet go confront her so you don't represent represent women you
[2:51:16.340 --> 2:51:22.660]  monster you know how dare you be behind the impeachment she's running at all you're like oh
[2:51:22.660 --> 2:51:28.900]  no she's done it's over alex no i told you they'd pass the initiation of impeachment in the house
[2:51:28.900 --> 2:51:35.860]  they did yesterday they mean business they're a bunch of self-confident criminals you watch
[2:51:35.860 --> 2:51:40.980]  brennan and others on tv going we're the deep state thank god for us our intelligence agencies
[2:51:41.780 --> 2:51:48.260]  guard america and we're getting rid of trump they're rogue criminals openly pissing in our face
[2:51:48.260 --> 2:51:54.820]  so that all their minions think they're still in charge it's all a confidence act christian virginia
[2:51:54.820 --> 2:52:03.380]  thanks for holding her on the air worldwide let's yes sir uh yeah i was just calling in about bag
[2:52:03.380 --> 2:52:09.620]  pipes of war a lot of people forgot about when william bar was in the doj and he was blowing in bag
[2:52:09.620 --> 2:52:14.020]  pipes a lot of people got a kick out of it but i think he was signaling to the deep state that it
[2:52:14.020 --> 2:52:20.660]  was wartime and after that uh the Mueller hearing was over trump had a press conference where he was
[2:52:20.660 --> 2:52:26.580]  saying look into ukraine look into australia look into all these different places nobody said a word
[2:52:26.580 --> 2:52:33.300]  about that now everybody wants to impeach him because of ukraine so what i think is going on
[2:52:33.300 --> 2:52:38.420]  is that behind the scenes and i think this is where trump is different from maybe jfk i think he
[2:52:38.420 --> 2:52:44.100]  has the support of the military the word commanders on the ground he's empowered them where he took
[2:52:44.100 --> 2:52:49.300]  the power out of the pentagon and gave a put it to the people that's on the ground that way they
[2:52:49.300 --> 2:52:53.860]  have a direct line to the president so they can go do all these special missions christ don't hang
[2:52:53.860 --> 2:52:58.500]  up i want to back up what you're saying from virginium i talked to folks that were there the day he
[2:52:58.500 --> 2:53:05.060]  got inaugurated he went to the cia and had over 200 of the top actual people that do the work on the
[2:53:05.060 --> 2:53:11.460]  ground but in charge of those and he just said you're now in command uh whatever you think i
[2:53:11.460 --> 2:53:17.300]  have confidence in you execute the missions and that absolutely pissed off the deep state so they
[2:53:17.300 --> 2:53:21.780]  tried to sabotage a few of the early missions and then trump started just completely cutting
[2:53:21.780 --> 2:53:25.860]  all the deep staters out of the decision-making process so what you're saying is absolutely
[2:53:25.860 --> 2:53:32.740]  true please continue i think also that uh he's also empowered william bar and durum
[2:53:32.740 --> 2:53:38.580]  that they're really afraid of durum they wasn't worried about the horrors but they're worried
[2:53:38.580 --> 2:53:44.260]  about durum because they know his investigation is real it's you know justice it takes time to come
[2:53:44.260 --> 2:53:48.340]  you know a lot of people are impatient they want just to come but i think you have to go after
[2:53:48.340 --> 2:53:53.460]  these super criminals for the rest of following line if you want to get big tech in order if you
[2:53:53.460 --> 2:53:57.460]  want to get everything everybody else in order you have to take out the big fish and these are
[2:53:57.460 --> 2:54:02.420]  high rollers so it's not going to be easy but i think with the power of the military and the power of
[2:54:02.420 --> 2:54:07.540]  the people getting the word out i think people are more awake now than ever and i think that
[2:54:07.540 --> 2:54:14.100]  their time is numbered we got a lot of really good calls today we got to get this fellas uh
[2:54:14.100 --> 2:54:17.620]  number chris if you want to be part of this show we're going to launch enough to do it every week
[2:54:17.620 --> 2:54:22.180]  or even every month we want to get like 30 names of people that want to come in do the show a while
[2:54:22.180 --> 2:54:25.540]  and then start hosting it because you got a great voice and you're making really great points and
[2:54:25.540 --> 2:54:29.380]  so i'm dedicated by next week to really start that show every week i'm not going to host it
[2:54:29.380 --> 2:54:32.580]  every week myself because i'm already working seven days a week but chris i'd love to have you
[2:54:32.580 --> 2:54:38.260]  involved with that let me ask you this how long can trump wait though because it's totally out of
[2:54:38.260 --> 2:54:42.340]  control they're having secret hearings they're running around threatening everybody they're
[2:54:42.340 --> 2:54:48.100]  trying to sabotage the economy i mean how long is it because now trump says he's going to start
[2:54:48.100 --> 2:54:55.860]  the fireside chats i think he needs serious national addresses about these criminals and go
[2:54:55.860 --> 2:55:02.420]  right to the people more than just twitter he needs to say on tv from the white house desk
[2:55:03.300 --> 2:55:09.780]  what he says in twitter what do you say i said that that is a good idea but i also think that uh
[2:55:10.500 --> 2:55:15.300]  you know in this game that he's playing i think he's playing and playing this game that the
[2:55:15.300 --> 2:55:20.100]  democrats plan way better than they're playing and the deep state that he's playing right now
[2:55:20.100 --> 2:55:24.660]  i think that you know he he's done a good job of getting the word out there but i think
[2:55:24.660 --> 2:55:30.180]  it's only so much that he can do he just did an interview where he said uh that he had a lot of
[2:55:30.180 --> 2:55:35.460]  cars to play with the declassification they asked him why would he hold me he said that uh he wouldn't
[2:55:35.460 --> 2:55:40.100]  he didn't want to play that car right then because he knew that it would be gone by now it'd be
[2:55:40.100 --> 2:55:46.420]  tomorrow's news so i think that he's waiting for 2020 to have the democrats on defense all year
[2:55:46.420 --> 2:55:53.140]  leading up to the election with declassification indictments per walks so much stuff that i think
[2:55:53.140 --> 2:55:58.580]  the system as we know it is about the crumble oh i agree they're listen what you set up front is the
[2:55:58.580 --> 2:56:06.260]  key they are scared they are running around crazy doing criminal things i just don't like letting
[2:56:06.260 --> 2:56:11.060]  them run wild like this it's so illegal it's emboldening their minions and i understand the
[2:56:11.060 --> 2:56:18.740]  strategies of wait wait wait listen you wait too long you burn the cake i think it's time to get
[2:56:18.740 --> 2:56:24.340]  the cake out of the oven i mean we're into 2020 basically we're a year out from the election
[2:56:24.340 --> 2:56:32.020]  in just what four or five days my friend yeah we're we're we're in a struggle we're in a situation
[2:56:32.020 --> 2:56:38.100]  right now that we need to get we need it is urgency we urgency isn't necessary at this time
[2:56:38.100 --> 2:56:43.620]  but i think for us on the ground as people we just got to continue the information war for the people
[2:56:43.620 --> 2:56:49.380]  inside the government i think that they have to get mobilized and and grow a pair and really get
[2:56:49.380 --> 2:56:54.020]  behind this president because like you say it's a lot of good patriots in this government but
[2:56:54.020 --> 2:56:59.620]  they have to be the ones to step up from the inside so it makes it better for us to on the outside
[2:56:59.620 --> 2:57:05.460]  absolutely i just you can feel the energy you can see it and it's happening all over the world people
[2:57:05.460 --> 2:57:11.220]  are overthrowing these globalist governments people know the truth and it's only a matter of time but
[2:57:11.220 --> 2:57:15.540]  man hillary really thinks they're going to remove trump and then she's going to skate in against
[2:57:15.540 --> 2:57:20.260]  whatever uh republican they put in against her and i just don't see that working even if they're
[2:57:20.260 --> 2:57:25.460]  able to kill trump it triggers something that destroys them i but they just are too stupid to
[2:57:25.460 --> 2:57:29.780]  get it and they'll have to have the deep state out in the open admitting that they exist and they're
[2:57:29.780 --> 2:57:34.260]  going to stop trump even if they get rid of trump they're going to be removed by another group that's
[2:57:34.260 --> 2:57:39.460]  going to use their weakness and they're they're just so stupid uh what they've done god bless you

[3:00:53.300 --> 3:01:01.460]  you for calling today sir alex jones sir it's a honor to talk to you finally i was actually
[3:01:01.460 --> 3:01:09.940]  on the ground in dc during the inauguration looking for you hunting for you wearing my hillary
[3:01:09.940 --> 3:01:17.060]  joker shirt you probably heard me i had tickets in the blue section and the silver section i was
[3:01:17.060 --> 3:01:26.820]  the only one when obama and hillary got on stage booing as loud as i can and i'm familiar with
[3:01:26.820 --> 3:01:35.060]  booing really loud because i'm a chicago white socks fan and i spent grew up at the park there
[3:01:36.020 --> 3:01:43.700]  and i just moved from i want to be concise with what i talk about right now um i just moved from
[3:01:43.700 --> 3:01:52.020]  the most beautiful area in the country in evergreen colorado and now i move back here to the chicago
[3:01:52.020 --> 3:02:03.060]  land for for money but uh being i got woke up to you so long ago i think it was around 2002
[3:02:03.060 --> 3:02:10.260]  whenever you came out with it's called marshal law 911 rise the police state yes my brother woke me
[3:02:10.260 --> 3:02:18.820]  up in a dead sleep shaking me wake up wake up you gotta come see this drug me upstairs it was public
[3:02:18.820 --> 3:02:27.460]  access tv and since that moment i've been on this road and i've gotten to shake hands with
[3:02:28.100 --> 3:02:37.540]  dr ron paul ran paul i worked security for trump junior in colorado where it was literally me
[3:02:37.540 --> 3:02:48.740]  secret service sheriffs and trump jr and eric trump i went to all the rallies and uh the point
[3:02:48.740 --> 3:02:57.220]  that i called in about is just kind of a side issue to be honest i know i'm uh about listening
[3:02:57.220 --> 3:03:01.700]  because your phone sounds good and clear and you're making good points i like i like hearing
[3:03:01.700 --> 3:03:07.220]  about the listeners this is the only time that i would put my personal surveillance device
[3:03:07.220 --> 3:03:12.420]  next to my head is to talk to you sir well we're honored to have you here so what what do you think
[3:03:12.420 --> 3:03:18.020]  trump needs to do because the urgency is just fever pitch right now i know what trump needs to do
[3:03:18.020 --> 3:03:26.820]  and actually believe it or not i have a referendum that has been approved in the state of colorado
[3:03:27.380 --> 3:03:33.540]  i went to hearings at the secretary of state and the capital building i got grilled by their
[3:03:33.540 --> 3:03:38.820]  lawyer so tell me about that and then tell me about your betto coded message okay so betto
[3:03:39.620 --> 3:03:47.540]  during i think it was on world four i believe uh he's when he is there debating booty judge about
[3:03:48.500 --> 3:03:50.900]  guns yes he says
[3:03:53.620 --> 3:04:00.500]  anyone brandishing weapons will be okay so this is a direct shot at katlyn bennett
[3:04:00.500 --> 3:04:07.780]  he says that anyone that's brandishing their weapons for intimidation like they did in
[3:04:07.780 --> 3:04:15.780]  Kent state will be red flagged i don't remember any uh violence ever happening yet no that's right
[3:04:15.780 --> 3:04:20.420]  he's saying if you have a firearm and someone doesn't like you having it it'll be taken you're
[3:04:20.420 --> 3:04:24.740]  right i think i remember when i saw that i knew it was katlyn bennett and then i just forgot about
[3:04:24.740 --> 3:04:28.500]  it because so much happened we i'm gonna get her on about that great point god bless you
[3:04:28.500 --> 3:04:31.940]  i know mac you're going for an hour i was going for an hour i wish we could just
[3:04:32.900 --> 3:04:36.740]  i need to get better i've got a little better they're getting calls for years i haven't really
[3:04:36.740 --> 3:04:40.260]  been taking a lot of calls but i'm getting back to it because it really brings in a lot of wild
[3:04:40.260 --> 3:04:45.780]  cards a lot of good angles and we've done pretty good odao i've given myself about a c-minus but
[3:04:45.780 --> 3:04:49.620]  it's better than f-minus i usually go we're going to dany and jeff and then i'm gonna hit a bunch
[3:04:49.620 --> 3:04:56.340]  of news and then dr dick megge is coming up we're back in 60 seconds wow man it's crazy what's going on
[3:04:56.340 --> 3:05:00.660]  did you hear what gohmert said the congressman about civil war
[3:05:04.500 --> 3:05:08.980]  hosts ask me alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's because
[3:05:09.540 --> 3:05:15.460]  different types of physiologies different types of metabolic systems and people will like different
[3:05:15.460 --> 3:05:22.340]  formulas it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because
[3:05:22.340 --> 3:05:29.540]  some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both
[3:05:29.540 --> 3:05:35.700]  great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or friends bottom line
[3:05:35.700 --> 3:05:41.540]  iodine is essential that's why i harp on it the globalist want you to be deficient in it for a
[3:05:41.540 --> 3:05:47.140]  lot of reasons lower iq makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your high
[3:05:47.140 --> 3:05:54.020]  quality iodine info or store dot com and help fund the info or info or store dot com we've got a huge
[3:05:54.020 --> 3:05:59.380]  sale running right now but it's about to end it's the iodine challenge both types of iodine with
[3:05:59.380 --> 3:06:13.860]  selenium for 60 off together another time
[3:06:13.860 --> 3:06:23.860]  right

[3:06:48.740 --> 3:06:52.420]  into the fourth hour dr nick begatius is about to take over in a moment i have several video clips
[3:06:52.420 --> 3:06:59.460]  want to play shelling the establishment posing and claiming they're taking vaccines when they're
[3:06:59.460 --> 3:07:03.460]  not talking about catching them red-handed what's good for the goose is good for the gander
[3:07:03.460 --> 3:07:10.500]  we'll go to those in a moment danie and portland origan you're on the air go ahead
[3:07:11.540 --> 3:07:17.540]  welcome so i was just wanting to chat with you about the uh self-proclaimed antifa member making
[3:07:17.540 --> 3:07:23.940]  posts about putting fit and all in the trick-or-treat candy for children quote children dressed in some
[3:07:23.940 --> 3:07:31.540]  maga type costumes yes um yeah this is some disgusting i'm hoping it was just some trolling
[3:07:31.540 --> 3:07:37.300]  type of thing but the sad thing is that you know nobody seems to take these things seriously and
[3:07:37.300 --> 3:07:43.940]  that is a very serious thing to say especially when earlier uh or is it yesterday or this week
[3:07:44.660 --> 3:07:52.180]  they found you know busted 40 pounds of uh fentanyl in ohio enough to kill the entire state
[3:07:52.180 --> 3:07:58.020]  more than once uh and they caught the chatcom trying to ship through mexico enough to kill the whole
[3:07:58.020 --> 3:08:04.500]  world 10 billion 600 plus million people once and you're absolutely right and i i know a lot of people
[3:08:04.500 --> 3:08:10.340]  that for instance family died from fentanyl i know a fella uh who's a girlfriend died when
[3:08:10.340 --> 3:08:15.700]  they gave her supposedly marijuana vape that was laced with fentanyl and so yes china is
[3:08:15.700 --> 3:08:20.500]  bombarding us others are bombarding us and that article's on info wars dot com it's pretty sick
[3:08:20.500 --> 3:08:26.980]  isn't it it's disgusting and i noticed that the day they took his page down uh earlier this morning
[3:08:26.980 --> 3:08:32.180]  on twitter but i've been going through it on the way back machine and i mean this guy's just scum
[3:08:32.180 --> 3:08:37.860]  you know piece of garbage some antifa by the way just because somebody dressed like trump doesn't
[3:08:37.860 --> 3:08:42.740]  mean there's trump supporter most the mask or anti-trump you see out there so that shows how
[3:08:42.740 --> 3:08:47.700]  dumb they are too because they will just attack random i've seen antifa attack white people
[3:08:48.260 --> 3:08:52.980]  just because they're white thinking they must be racist and they're a white person doing the attacking
[3:08:52.980 --> 3:08:59.540]  yeah exactly i mean and you know we're talking about the civil war i mean if this is china pushing
[3:08:59.540 --> 3:09:05.460]  this stuff in and then antifa doing things like this whether they're doing it or not it's hard to
[3:09:05.460 --> 3:09:10.260]  say but it's still has to be taken seriously when they're listen i went to a sushi restaurant
[3:09:11.780 --> 3:09:16.820]  six years ago when i was in the middle of my divorce and i went out with a friend and
[3:09:16.820 --> 3:09:24.980]  and we had walked down there because i lived downtown at the time and by the time i got back
[3:09:24.980 --> 3:09:30.660]  to my condo i was crawling into the bed and uh it happened to my friend as well and then later
[3:09:30.660 --> 3:09:35.220]  we went back and they're like well yeah somebody behind the counter didn't really like you would
[3:09:35.220 --> 3:09:39.940]  it right yeah i heard that god does that i heard something about it these leftists are so nonchalant
[3:09:39.940 --> 3:09:44.900]  they're like yeah we heard you got you know your drink could have killed me and then of course
[3:09:44.900 --> 3:09:49.140]  we come back well we're not gonna say who it was but what how would they like if i came there you
[3:09:49.140 --> 3:09:53.460]  know and crammed fentanyl down their throat and they died then it'd be a big deal but oh
[3:09:53.460 --> 3:09:57.380]  it's a trump supporter so you can do that that was even pre-trump but yeah these leftists man
[3:09:57.380 --> 3:10:02.740]  it they're just the scum of the earth god bless you i appreciate your call dany jeff in california
[3:10:02.740 --> 3:10:08.100]  man what is going on out in california with the fires where they won't cut out the the dead
[3:10:08.100 --> 3:10:12.660]  undergrowth and they make fun of trump saying rake the forest well that's literally what you do
[3:10:12.660 --> 3:10:18.900]  what do you make of uh just all that's going on my friend uh yeah there's a lot going on alexa
[3:10:18.900 --> 3:10:24.580]  and i live in the south bay area so i get all the smoke down here so yeah it sucks and to hear
[3:10:24.580 --> 3:10:29.460]  that it's all about climate change and it has nothing to do with it it's so frustrating to hear
[3:10:29.460 --> 3:10:36.820]  people that i work and live around saying that crap oh excuse me um yeah it's crazy um i i did
[3:10:36.820 --> 3:10:42.740]  want to say uh you know public act confronting hillary you know that's great but we can also
[3:10:42.740 --> 3:10:49.060]  do little things to wake people up just a real quick example like i said i'm in the belly of the beast
[3:10:49.060 --> 3:10:56.340]  bay area and uh when the fc story broke um the local and national news all they were doing were
[3:10:56.340 --> 3:11:02.980]  showing pictures of trump with fc and spending multiple segments on that and my mom saw that
[3:11:02.980 --> 3:11:09.540]  she was like oh my god but because i watched info wars i educated her on the truth that
[3:11:09.540 --> 3:11:17.300]  trump kicked ebsky on marlago that clinton went to uh you know the pedophile island over 20 times
[3:11:17.300 --> 3:11:24.580]  and dumped his secret service uh uh brigade so things like that just waking people up
[3:11:25.380 --> 3:11:31.780]  we can do and and it's huge other thing i wanted to mention is uh it's time that we start talking
[3:11:31.780 --> 3:11:38.340]  about what the constitution already has in it to solve all this and that's implementing new
[3:11:38.340 --> 3:11:45.300]  government uh it's beyond time half of our government's traders i say more than half because
[3:11:45.300 --> 3:11:50.340]  you have the democrats which of course are gone but then you also have the elitist right over
[3:11:50.340 --> 3:11:57.380]  publican that are sold out and they're willing to play nice with the globalist so we need to
[3:11:57.380 --> 3:12:00.980]  start talking about well that's it most of them are just appeasers that are scared even
[3:12:00.980 --> 3:12:04.660]  the democrats are just slaves and that's why we've got to show leadership and strength and just get
[3:12:04.660 --> 3:12:10.580]  in their face and you know play chicken with them and not turn off the road and uh you know
[3:12:10.580 --> 3:12:14.420]  they turn off the road and we make it that's fine if we collide with them that's that we damn well
[3:12:14.420 --> 3:12:18.980]  know we got them uh so that we just gonna put the power of the medal and aim the car right at
[3:12:18.980 --> 3:12:23.220]  them politically and we're just gonna go in through beyond and that's what the children deserve and
[3:12:23.220 --> 3:12:30.180]  we're gonna do it i bless you i appreciate you my friend thank you okay i did pretty good if i
[3:12:30.180 --> 3:12:36.420]  took 20 calls i want to thank the crew this week i have been on fire on air and on fire off air

[3:12:48.100 --> 3:12:53.460]  breaking too much that i know has broken i've got to go off air because we've got another great guest
[3:12:53.460 --> 3:12:58.900]  host uh pop it in the last few segments of this this hour the next three dr nick baggots you
[3:12:58.900 --> 3:13:03.540]  and just love the directions he takes a sense what's a good change for me ranting and raving up here
[3:13:03.540 --> 3:13:07.460]  but i want to hit a few other news items here but let me just throw this at you quickly
[3:13:09.140 --> 3:13:12.820]  when you get excited about the products we have plenty of money to fund the operation to do great
[3:13:12.820 --> 3:13:18.260]  things when you don't i have to spend most of my time trying to scrounge around to find money
[3:13:18.260 --> 3:13:22.580]  just to keep the lights on so i want to thank you all for spending money with them for wars
[3:13:22.580 --> 3:13:27.060]  and i want to just tell you you need fish oil you need turmeric you need colloidal silver you
[3:13:27.060 --> 3:13:31.620]  need a good new tropic like brain force or a good clean 10 hour energy the best you're going to find
[3:13:31.620 --> 3:13:40.100]  out there like turbo force and our great peanut butter and chocolate and vanilla coconut and
[3:13:40.100 --> 3:13:45.780]  chocolate protein bars i mean these are high-end bars that sell at places like Whole Foods for
[3:13:45.780 --> 3:13:51.700]  six seven dollars a piece we usually sell them at three dollars a piece in cases of 12 well these
[3:13:51.700 --> 3:13:58.500]  now are even lower than that at 50% off most of the sales have to end by monday or so because
[3:13:58.500 --> 3:14:05.380]  a lot of these are selling out and so again ultra 12 is about to sell out really high quality
[3:14:05.380 --> 3:14:10.580]  about it would be 12 take it out of the tongue some things that have been sold out are back in
[3:14:10.580 --> 3:14:15.620]  like dna force plus it's 50% off but it just came back in for a free shipping double patriot points
[3:14:15.620 --> 3:14:21.620]  uh we've sold out of more than half of the alexa pure breeze four-stage ion cluster filter
[3:14:23.300 --> 3:14:29.700]  this is the lowest price ever at cost 147 and then they pay me a rebate
[3:14:31.380 --> 3:14:34.900]  to do it even though they sell tons of these they're very popular
[3:14:35.780 --> 3:14:38.420]  they order a huge amount each year and i have a corporate agreement
[3:14:38.420 --> 3:14:46.020]  that i get anything's they're gonna sell at cost or loss leader first i have first right to get
[3:14:46.020 --> 3:14:51.620]  whatever i want and i took everything they had 2,300 or something and there's less than the
[3:14:51.620 --> 3:14:58.340]  thousand i'm right now and i can tell you i can tell you that we normally make 50 bucks on these
[3:14:58.340 --> 3:15:03.380]  when they're selling them for 250 that's an amazing deal and again that's two different
[3:15:03.380 --> 3:15:09.140]  schools of thought you can get the very same units for 400 500 it's some fancy store and and
[3:15:09.140 --> 3:15:15.620]  they're making them for 150 bucks i mean it's just crazy it's just crazy well they don't do that
[3:15:15.620 --> 3:15:20.020]  they sell them at 250 is a normal price like 300 is a normal price we always discount some
[3:15:21.620 --> 3:15:25.700]  those will sell out i would guess by monday or tuesday so take advantage of those and the little
[3:15:25.700 --> 3:15:28.980]  bit of money we make does fund the operation oh and it's free shipping that's why it's the best
[3:15:28.980 --> 3:15:35.540]  deal ever it's insane all right in four store dot com okay i'm gonna come back and hit these

[3:20:49.940 --> 3:20:56.260]  that in china and germany and europe quote clean vaccines that's london guardian are produced for
[3:20:56.260 --> 3:21:03.700]  the elites oh really clean ones it's the liability protection it's the danger it's the cancer viruses
[3:21:03.700 --> 3:21:07.460]  that they've admitted have been in vaccines and all the health problems then they try to deny it
[3:21:07.460 --> 3:21:11.380]  zuckerberg got asked a week ago when he was in congress where we can have a go
[3:21:11.380 --> 3:21:16.980]  why do you ban people who talk about bad effects they personally had isn't a consumer thing we can
[3:21:16.980 --> 3:21:22.820]  talk about but that's what's happening ladies and gentlemen because they want the power to
[3:21:22.820 --> 3:21:28.580]  put things in her bodies so we'll roll some of the video of that and what happened with her but
[3:21:28.580 --> 3:21:33.460]  first i want to roll this video from the golden globes where the news said golden globes participants
[3:21:33.460 --> 3:21:39.380]  got shots this is a year ago now what was crazy is it was clearly fake nurses with big giant shots
[3:21:42.100 --> 3:21:46.740]  and it wasn't real vaccine so that's how dumb they think we are here's the video
[3:21:48.180 --> 3:21:49.300]  get a load of this crap
[3:21:50.820 --> 3:21:55.860]  the host would do something fun and spontaneous to show how we're all just ordinary people like
[3:21:55.860 --> 3:22:00.420]  ordering pizza for everyone it says we already get food at the globes we thought we mixed it up
[3:22:00.420 --> 3:22:07.700]  and try something new so roll up your sleeves hollywood because you're all getting blue shots
[3:22:10.580 --> 3:22:19.700]  you're definitely gonna want to get the phone
[3:22:19.700 --> 3:22:28.980]  so
[3:22:45.140 --> 3:22:49.060]  so that's what's going on here now here's the second video of her
[3:22:49.060 --> 3:22:53.060]  acting like she got it as well and clearly it's a fraud the whole thing's a fraud here it is
[3:23:08.100 --> 3:23:10.820]  and show that again the old track has to be
[3:23:10.820 --> 3:23:19.460]  supposed to be a good post no needle it's not accused of it she clearly staged it
[3:23:20.260 --> 3:23:24.980]  we love him he's awesome he's dr nick baggage filmmaker researcher amazing person earth pulse
[3:23:24.980 --> 3:23:29.220]  dot com we've got him all saying kill the president remove him you know his own dad was a famous
[3:23:29.220 --> 3:23:34.580]  congressman that disappeared and was a political obviously target and then of course you've got
[3:23:34.580 --> 3:23:38.580]  his brother was u.s senator thanks for letting me grab some of your time we love you we appreciate
[3:23:38.580 --> 3:23:45.300]  you it's your rodeo sir thank you thanks for having me um alex it's always good to be with you
[3:23:45.300 --> 3:23:51.380]  you know the um the whole uh vaccine thing that you're covering now you know one angle that no one
[3:23:51.380 --> 3:23:56.660]  ever really talks about and i've mentioned it on your program before and it's the idea that you
[3:23:56.660 --> 3:24:03.940]  know people talk about uh the right to our own bodies when they talk about um pro choice versus
[3:24:03.940 --> 3:24:09.460]  the right to life and you know the u.s supreme court says your body is your own right okay so
[3:24:09.460 --> 3:24:16.420]  what about vaccines is our bodies our own or are they not you know so maybe you can have it both
[3:24:16.420 --> 3:24:21.460]  ways i guess i'm a i'm a pro-life person just to be clear on that too as i'm talking about this but
[3:24:22.020 --> 3:24:28.740]  my point is um you know when you think about our personal health and what is uh acceptable to us
[3:24:28.740 --> 3:24:33.940]  that's an individual choice on every level and you know you think about national health coverage
[3:24:33.940 --> 3:24:39.220]  and the uh angle that not many are talking about this either in the context of personal privacy
[3:24:39.940 --> 3:24:46.020]  and that is a dimension uh that we really need to think about because you know think about all
[3:24:46.020 --> 3:24:51.620]  of the different ways that personal privacy gets violated i mean today's news i heard google is going
[3:24:51.620 --> 3:24:59.700]  to buy fitbit for a couple billion dollars um now that then it mentions sort of the afterthought you
[3:24:59.700 --> 3:25:04.340]  know like uh the afterthought you always hear you know you know they might have some privacy
[3:25:04.340 --> 3:25:11.460]  implication well uh actually it it does there it is 2.1 billion dollar smart watchmaker now what
[3:25:11.460 --> 3:25:16.820]  people don't realize is now think about all your google information now mixed in with your health
[3:25:16.820 --> 3:25:23.300]  information so the ads you're going to get are about you know the uh drugs for your heart or
[3:25:23.300 --> 3:25:30.100]  ads for the gym or whatever but the point is it's a an additional layer of data collection by one
[3:25:30.100 --> 3:25:36.900]  central company again google which should be viewed as a utility that actually now is a
[3:25:36.900 --> 3:25:42.580]  collector of more data which it manipulates and uses commercially and politically not for your
[3:25:42.580 --> 3:25:47.300]  benefit but for the benefit of commercial and governmental interest and and that's just the
[3:25:47.300 --> 3:25:54.660]  way the system evolved i mean there's no question about it the only question is is it a public utility
[3:25:54.660 --> 3:26:01.220]  that should be regulated with open access so this network uh and others with contrary and voices
[3:26:01.220 --> 3:26:07.380]  can still be heard uh and rated in rank the same way as anyone else and treated equally as anyone
[3:26:07.380 --> 3:26:13.540]  else as a voice out of the wilderness you ought to have an equal opportunity to be that voice and
[3:26:13.540 --> 3:26:19.220]  i think that's what we're missing uh in the 21st century and i i heard the earlier dialogue about
[3:26:20.740 --> 3:26:26.820]  the fireside chats uh being discussed and you know it's funny and i heard both sides of that you
[3:26:26.820 --> 3:26:31.940]  know some people say no that's bad ideas and say that's good idea i wrote a paper about this that
[3:26:31.940 --> 3:26:36.900]  i transferred through a friend of mine up to the trump administration over a year and a half ago
[3:26:36.900 --> 3:26:42.340]  and i still believe it's a good idea for the president to control his own microphone for an hour
[3:26:42.340 --> 3:26:48.820]  a week or a half an hour a week instead of these twitter deals you know give us some real information
[3:26:48.820 --> 3:26:55.620]  that's not you know the soundbite you're gonna see on cnn or fox or anyone else um now yeah i know
[3:26:55.620 --> 3:27:00.820]  his style is not a roosevelt and he's not a roosevelt i'd agree with that too he's a donald
[3:27:00.820 --> 3:27:07.060]  trump and he should be donald trump but do it for an hour each week and kind of recap what happened
[3:27:07.060 --> 3:27:12.820]  the last week talk about where we're headed the next week and what we can do as american citizens
[3:27:12.820 --> 3:27:18.740]  to support to support it or not you know but at least we have a fighting chance i get the agenda
[3:27:18.740 --> 3:27:24.340]  complete not the soundbite version and then you know we can decide as a public right uh where we
[3:27:24.340 --> 3:27:29.620]  want to be but an hour of content from the president even a half an hour once a week or every couple
[3:27:29.620 --> 3:27:35.540]  weeks would be welcomed to talk about where we're going and where we've been and keep us
[3:27:35.540 --> 3:27:39.620]  apprised from his point of view and let us evaluate as the american public what's right
[3:27:39.620 --> 3:27:45.460]  what's wrong what's good what's bad because we're going to do it anyway but at least we hear his
[3:27:45.460 --> 3:27:52.980]  voice maybe break through the cloud of media control and really i want to kind of talk about
[3:27:52.980 --> 3:28:00.980]  all that in this segment in terms of the uh high road and uh a way through the matrix as i see it
[3:28:00.980 --> 3:28:06.820]  today you know and and this program is one of the few bright spots uh where we can talk freely at
[3:28:06.820 --> 3:28:13.220]  least at the moment um about these issues and and yeah you know and alex and i have uh a lot of
[3:28:13.220 --> 3:28:17.940]  things i know he covers all week long the news and the and the breaking event so i don't get into
[3:28:17.940 --> 3:28:23.300]  that no point in it and we've got um treuer and we've got everybody you know you got uh all the
[3:28:23.300 --> 3:28:29.700]  people david night the rest do in the daily news and so i try to cover a little bit different
[3:28:29.700 --> 3:28:35.940]  angle on the things we're all concerned about from the bigger picture of maybe um uh human
[3:28:35.940 --> 3:28:42.020]  perspective how do we engage this how do we enliven the public debate in a respectful way that leads
[3:28:42.020 --> 3:28:47.780]  us to a set of solutions that we can live with that we can endorse that we can support and this

[3:34:20.660 --> 3:34:28.420]  you know talking about uh personal privacy and the issues there and sort of where the technology
[3:34:28.420 --> 3:34:35.380]  takes us um 25 years of reporting on sort of technology trends generally is what my work
[3:34:35.380 --> 3:34:39.860]  spent about for those that have followed it and so starting with the angels don't play the sarf
[3:34:39.860 --> 3:34:45.380]  and that they're earth rising and earth rising too which were really compilations of technologies
[3:34:45.380 --> 3:34:52.980]  that would affect us and are affecting us now um written you know years before uh what we see today
[3:34:52.980 --> 3:34:59.780]  i mean accurately forecast and predicted not based on some esoteric nonsense but based on the evidence
[3:34:59.780 --> 3:35:06.020]  and over 1200 source documents cited in those books and videos you know the important thing
[3:35:06.020 --> 3:35:10.660]  about all of that is it's it's not about being right it's about okay what do we do with this and
[3:35:10.660 --> 3:35:15.860]  it's always been about uh solutions at least for me uh because i still believe that there's a chance
[3:35:15.860 --> 3:35:20.580]  we can make the difference and it really uh starts with individuals you know people ask me all the
[3:35:20.580 --> 3:35:26.740]  time what's the scariest worst thing and technologies and i say it's human beings behaving badly and it
[3:35:26.740 --> 3:35:32.500]  really is all of these things whether it's the economic issues the political issues the technology
[3:35:32.500 --> 3:35:39.460]  issues these are all a symptom let me say that again they're a symptom of human beings uh behaving
[3:35:39.460 --> 3:35:45.140]  badly and i think we can acknowledge that and it's easy to take shots at individuals when we see us
[3:35:45.140 --> 3:35:52.260]  being distracted now with uh impeachment discussion again and all of this nonsense when the really
[3:35:52.260 --> 3:35:59.700]  big issues that affect you and i every day are being ignored um particularly uh the privacy
[3:35:59.700 --> 3:36:04.500]  questions and the questions of manipulation i want to talk about what's happening sort of the
[3:36:04.500 --> 3:36:12.500]  precursors to what's going on in the world that's coming right here to a station close to you because
[3:36:12.500 --> 3:36:18.820]  this is uh the way it works in germany right now and in europe right now they have negative interest
[3:36:18.820 --> 3:36:23.300]  rates that means you put your money in the bank and you lose a little bit every month so people
[3:36:23.300 --> 3:36:28.580]  started taking their money out of the bank and buying big bank bolts to stick their cash in
[3:36:28.580 --> 3:36:33.140]  because better to have your cash sitting in neutral than losing money every month because that's
[3:36:33.140 --> 3:36:38.820]  what negative interest rates will get you now what they're doing in germany is having a discussion
[3:36:38.820 --> 3:36:45.780]  a discussion about going to all electronic money so you won't have any money under the mattress
[3:36:45.780 --> 3:36:51.940]  because it won't be acceptable you'll be taxed a negative interest rate if you live in germany
[3:36:51.940 --> 3:37:00.580]  on all your euros on a regular daily compounded uh thefting interest rate uh you know and those
[3:37:00.580 --> 3:37:04.980]  think about this now the other thing they're doing in germany is they're having this discussion
[3:37:04.980 --> 3:37:15.780]  right now in in real time about requiring you to register every purchase of gold over a thousand
[3:37:15.780 --> 3:37:21.300]  euros that's less than a cougar and ladies and gentlemen less than an ounce uh and and and this
[3:37:21.300 --> 3:37:27.860]  is why is that why do you ask why do they want to know where your inventory of precious metals is
[3:37:28.580 --> 3:37:33.940]  will take a guess they're probably going to tax idle gold too um or maybe confiscate like they
[3:37:33.940 --> 3:37:40.260]  did in the 30s and put it in national reserves when they remodeled ties uh after the war you know
[3:37:40.260 --> 3:37:45.460]  i mean the us did that you know after the depression grabbed all the all the gold and took it out of
[3:37:45.460 --> 3:37:50.500]  circulation and fixed the price but this is sort of the precursor you know and the other
[3:37:50.500 --> 3:37:56.740]  discussion that happens in germany on mainstream prime time tv in a credible way is the idea of
[3:37:56.740 --> 3:38:04.500]  capping your income because after all anything over 40 000 euros a month you couldn't possibly
[3:38:04.500 --> 3:38:09.940]  need that kind of money now whether you do or you don't the point of the matter is at least in this
[3:38:09.940 --> 3:38:13.860]  country in the united states we'd like to think that we have the opportunity to make that kind of
[3:38:13.860 --> 3:38:20.900]  money you not have a tax after that at 100 percent 100 percent which is what they're proposing in
[3:38:20.900 --> 3:38:27.940]  germany here in the us the left is only proposing 70 percent how generous of them uh to tax uh at
[3:38:27.940 --> 3:38:34.020]  the top rate going back to where we were in the 1960s for god's sake you know we don't need to do
[3:38:34.020 --> 3:38:39.780]  that we can do this much differently and one of them is get a grip of the throttle you know
[3:38:40.340 --> 3:38:47.460]  i'm a cash register in terms of expenses and where the money's bleeding out of us uh like a sieve
[3:38:47.460 --> 3:38:54.020]  uh some of the things that i want to talk about um today you know where does the money bleed out
[3:38:54.020 --> 3:39:00.340]  of the national uh reserve out of the public balance sheet mr trump president trump i hope
[3:39:00.340 --> 3:39:06.020]  you're listening the balance sheet nobody pays attention to it you know what the balance sheet
[3:39:06.020 --> 3:39:11.140]  is is where they store real wealth the balance sheet of the nation is our natural resource
[3:39:11.140 --> 3:39:20.580]  base oil and gas coal minerals grazing lands public lands of all kinds is it working ladies and
[3:39:20.580 --> 3:39:25.860]  gentlemen is it working for us i don't think so here in alaska we have government essentially
[3:39:25.860 --> 3:39:30.980]  government by endowment let me say that again government by endowment we don't have an income
[3:39:30.980 --> 3:39:35.700]  tax we don't have state sales tax we don't have a state property tax we don't have state income
[3:39:35.700 --> 3:39:41.780]  tax we have a state income tax on corporation c corporation it's not s corporation owned by
[3:39:41.780 --> 3:39:49.780]  small businesses c corpse of nine percent you know not too bad but the point is we make our money
[3:39:49.780 --> 3:39:55.060]  here based on rents and royalties on our natural resource base which fuels something we call the
[3:39:55.060 --> 3:40:01.300]  permanent fund which now is being used to fuel part of government and we also have income reserve
[3:40:01.300 --> 3:40:06.500]  funds and other funds that we've created out of our revenue stream from our resource base i don't
[3:40:06.500 --> 3:40:10.740]  think we're doing enough there and there's not going to be time to talk about that this uh
[3:40:10.740 --> 3:40:16.180]  segment today but the point i'm making is when you have your resources actually working for you
[3:40:16.180 --> 3:40:21.140]  and producing revenue in the interest of the american public and in alaskans case the alaskan
[3:40:21.140 --> 3:40:27.060]  public it actually throws up enough revenue to operate a government that's uh you know a big
[3:40:27.060 --> 3:40:32.260]  government for the people we have here but here's what's being missed the nation is missing the
[3:40:32.260 --> 3:40:39.460]  opportunity of alaska alaska is 18 percent of the u.s landmass we are more than the west coast
[3:40:39.460 --> 3:40:44.820]  gulf coast and east coast combined when you look at our coastal areas and the 200 mile federal
[3:40:44.820 --> 3:40:50.340]  limit extending into those oceans which includes some of the biggest oil and gas basins left on
[3:40:50.340 --> 3:40:56.500]  the planet that's the national wealth and that's also state wealth here in alaska and what we're
[3:40:56.500 --> 3:41:01.060]  not doing is seeing that wealth converted in the national interest most of those resources are
[3:41:01.060 --> 3:41:07.300]  exported and you know why they're exported because of a thing called the jones act which restricts
[3:41:08.020 --> 3:41:15.860]  shipping between us ports to us built ships a us built ship versus a ship built in china
[3:41:15.860 --> 3:41:22.580]  the difference is about 10 fold 10 times so when you use a us built ship to move raw materials out
[3:41:22.580 --> 3:41:27.940]  of alaska to the west coast it's not economic it's cheaper to move them to japan it's cheaper to
[3:41:27.940 --> 3:41:33.700]  move them to china it's cheaper to move them to india even though it's much much further away
[3:41:33.700 --> 3:41:40.980]  when you start talking china and we do it because the shipping to ship as an example a container
[3:41:40.980 --> 3:41:49.140]  from china to la costs about a thousand bucks to ship it halfway back to hawaii cost about
[3:41:49.140 --> 3:41:56.020]  8,000 eight times as much okay so when you have all these natural resources in alaska and you only
[3:41:56.020 --> 3:42:02.820]  have 750,000 people in alaska and it's 18 percent of the tire united states and you have all these
[3:42:02.820 --> 3:42:08.260]  resources a we don't have an infrastructure because the nation doesn't see the need but we need one
[3:42:08.260 --> 3:42:14.740]  we need to hook up to the rail so we can bypass the jones act and ship our commodities through
[3:42:14.740 --> 3:42:20.500]  canada into the united states into the rust belt and into the nation where they can be value added
[3:42:20.500 --> 3:42:26.100]  with american industry and american labor and american factories and american companies being
[3:42:26.100 --> 3:42:31.460]  taxed in america so we can export those products and use them domestically and we're not doing
[3:42:31.460 --> 3:42:38.740]  we're missing the billion dollar opportunities every day the trillion trillion dollar opportunities
[3:42:38.740 --> 3:42:43.540]  every day in alaska in the national interest we need to have a broader and bigger discussion
[3:42:43.540 --> 3:42:47.940]  about our resource base and the balance sheet of the nation this is dr nick vegas this friday
[3:42:47.940 --> 3:42:59.460]  afternoon it's november 1st 2019 and we'll be back after these brief passages
[3:43:03.300 --> 3:43:08.980]  folks ask me alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's because different
[3:43:08.980 --> 3:43:14.980]  types of physiology's different types of metabolic systems and people will like different formulas
[3:43:14.980 --> 3:43:21.940]  it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people
[3:43:21.940 --> 3:43:28.900]  need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both great for
[3:43:28.900 --> 3:43:35.460]  you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or friends bottom line iodine is
[3:43:35.460 --> 3:43:40.820]  essential that's why i harp on it the globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of
[3:43:40.820 --> 3:43:46.260]  reasons lower iq makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your high quality
[3:43:46.260 --> 3:43:53.220]  iodine at infowarstore.com and help fund the info war infowarstore.com we've got a huge sale
[3:43:53.220 --> 3:43:58.980]  running right now but it's about to end it's the iodine challenge both types of iodine with selenium
[3:43:58.980 --> 3:44:07.540]  for 60 off together all of our bodies are different all of our metabolic systems are diverse some of
[3:44:07.540 --> 3:44:12.500]  us are deficient some things and not in others there's a lot of factors that go into this and
[3:44:12.500 --> 3:44:19.300]  i'm not telling you something you don't know but i'm here to tell you every time i commit and use

[3:45:00.420 --> 3:45:09.220]  warstore.com the alex joneshow a few days ago my 11 year old daughter came to me and she had her
[3:45:09.220 --> 3:45:15.060]  digital textbook she said dad they're teaching us about the periodic table and i clicked on iodine
[3:45:15.060 --> 3:45:20.020]  and it says that two billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet earth
[3:45:20.020 --> 3:45:24.020]  because they didn't get enough iodine that's what you say all the time but i've heard people
[3:45:24.020 --> 3:45:29.060]  say you're crazy and it's not true but dad it's right here on the periodic table when i click it
[3:45:29.060 --> 3:45:34.260]  saying exactly what you said and i said i know honey that's why i have you take the high quality
[3:45:34.260 --> 3:45:40.100]  nutraceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant it's why you're so alive it's
[3:45:40.100 --> 3:45:45.620]  it's one of the reasons uh that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids you're
[3:45:45.620 --> 3:45:52.100]  age and it just really blew her away to read it there for herself and i know that two billion
[3:45:52.100 --> 3:45:56.660]  people ladies and gentlemen two billion are mentally retarded on the face of the earth right

[3:47:29.380 --> 3:47:38.900]  and welcome back um it's always good to be here you know talking a little bit about alaska and
[3:47:38.900 --> 3:47:42.900]  why it's important to the nation we're talking about the jones act just before the break and
[3:47:42.900 --> 3:47:46.500]  the idea of a railroad link and that's actually in discussion right now they're talking about
[3:47:46.500 --> 3:47:53.140]  a railroad link uh from uh canada drool alaska into the port eventually into the ports of um
[3:47:53.140 --> 3:47:57.860]  of anchorage and seward and why they're looking at this is the west coast ports are really pretty
[3:47:57.860 --> 3:48:03.940]  plugged up from the us to the canadian side and the thought is that you could really do some
[3:48:03.940 --> 3:48:09.300]  things by exporting um out of the ports here in alaska we actually have wittier which is
[3:48:09.300 --> 3:48:15.060]  deep enough and we have um uh seward which are on the rail system and linking it up
[3:48:15.060 --> 3:48:20.740]  would give us the ability then to expand the alaska railroad system um through the state
[3:48:20.740 --> 3:48:26.660]  and hit in into these major mineral areas and allow us to start transporting the other direction
[3:48:26.660 --> 3:48:32.900]  in other words canada wants to ship out of our port um uh their natural resources but it would
[3:48:32.900 --> 3:48:39.060]  allow us then to ship back into us port potentially uh some of alaskans the other thing that's being
[3:48:39.060 --> 3:48:47.060]  talked about right now um and is a big discussion right now uh and is moving forward is um natural
[3:48:47.060 --> 3:48:52.660]  gas on the north slope we have trillions uh tens perhaps hundreds of trillions of cubic feet
[3:48:52.660 --> 3:48:57.460]  of natural gas on the north slope they're putting uh discussing now and they're going to decide i
[3:48:57.460 --> 3:49:04.660]  guess in the next year or two to put um natural gas um uh liquefaction plants there well we can
[3:49:04.660 --> 3:49:12.100]  convert that to a liquefied product and then that's going to be shipped uh from there uh out of um
[3:49:12.100 --> 3:49:20.260]  alaska uh actually to japan uh to china and to uh south korea and the philippines again because
[3:49:20.260 --> 3:49:26.260]  the jones act can economically shift that material into the us and we actually have a fair amount
[3:49:26.260 --> 3:49:31.540]  of natural gas now a surplus actually in the us so it's not a problem but the point of the matter
[3:49:31.540 --> 3:49:37.620]  is we ought to have um something going on relative to the jones act because the things that are coming
[3:49:37.620 --> 3:49:45.460]  online we have graphene graphite a company called graphite one um is being looked at right now um
[3:49:45.460 --> 3:49:51.140]  as one of the primary supplies there's no domestic supply for graphene for the electric
[3:49:51.140 --> 3:49:57.620]  economy and the batteries and so on so that's a major major deposit of graphite uh in alaska
[3:49:57.620 --> 3:50:03.460]  that's being looked at right now as strategic mineral the others are rare earth minerals in south
[3:50:04.180 --> 3:50:10.740]  east alaska through a number of uh companies down there as well as zinc and other metals
[3:50:10.740 --> 3:50:16.740]  being looked at in southeast which are on tide water in deep water ports already but but we don't
[3:50:16.740 --> 3:50:22.740]  have a way to to move that economically into the us it can go to canada um by ship it can then go
[3:50:22.740 --> 3:50:29.540]  overseas um into asia which is most likely where it will go in fact it is where it will go if there's
[3:50:29.540 --> 3:50:35.620]  no amendment uh to the jones act to allow alaska natural resources to be shipped into us ports
[3:50:35.620 --> 3:50:42.580]  um without consideration for how the vessel is flagged uh that's the deal so that's the deal
[3:50:42.580 --> 3:50:47.620]  or get a railroad so we can actually do something with the balance sheet ladies and gentlemen
[3:50:47.620 --> 3:50:55.460]  because right now it's about taxing us under the bus you know is how it's uh currently rolling
[3:50:55.460 --> 3:51:00.260]  and the natural resources are being developed are being developed and sold as if there's a
[3:51:00.260 --> 3:51:06.820]  fire sale and this has been going on as i've covered in previous segments since the revolutionary
[3:51:06.820 --> 3:51:13.940]  war when we were screwing the patriots then out of their continentals um but here we are in the
[3:51:13.940 --> 3:51:22.900]  21st century um again seeing the government screw the average guy uh by not paying attention to
[3:51:22.900 --> 3:51:28.100]  things that are important that are truly in the nation's interest and in all of our interests
[3:51:28.100 --> 3:51:33.940]  as well this whole discussion uh some of the listeners had asked me and sent me some notes
[3:51:33.940 --> 3:51:38.500]  about talking a little bit about alaska a little bit more about it because people don't really
[3:51:38.500 --> 3:51:43.300]  know the story and i and i would agree with that some of the things i've covered in the past and
[3:51:43.300 --> 3:51:51.620]  go to uh band dot video uh and check out um my videos there you just do a search under
[3:51:51.620 --> 3:51:58.420]  baggage be eg i c h under band videos and you'll see a lot of the stuff that we've produced here
[3:51:58.420 --> 3:52:04.180]  on the network and and covering a lot of different issues uh that i think are important important
[3:52:04.180 --> 3:52:08.980]  to all of us uh and you know when you start to think about this in the context of where we are
[3:52:08.980 --> 3:52:17.300]  today with with all the uh uh propaganda bullets flying at us you've got to turn the tide which is
[3:52:17.300 --> 3:52:22.260]  you do it with good information good research and the kind of things that that we can do here and
[3:52:22.260 --> 3:52:28.500]  then more importantly uh taking uh appropriate actions uh and some of those are pretty simple
[3:52:28.500 --> 3:52:35.140]  there's a article on my website called change agents in reality creation i wrote it nearly 90s
[3:52:35.140 --> 3:52:40.900]  before change agents was hijacked by the left um but the ideas are still good and they're simple
[3:52:40.900 --> 3:52:45.620]  ideas about how to reach out and touch the process things you can do that empower you
[3:52:45.620 --> 3:52:49.380]  and people have asked me you know what can we do what can i do you know i'm just this guy
[3:52:50.100 --> 3:52:55.940]  individual out there and each of us truly have a sphere of influence it might be just our families
[3:52:55.940 --> 3:53:01.060]  and our neighbors and the people that we talk to at work um but we can provide information the other
[3:53:01.060 --> 3:53:07.220]  thing we can do is send information mail it out keep it simple keep it brief um handwritten letters
[3:53:07.220 --> 3:53:11.300]  to your congressional delegation your local politicians they still get read because there's
[3:53:11.300 --> 3:53:18.340]  so few of them let me say it again handwritten not emails they don't get read handwritten notes to
[3:53:18.340 --> 3:53:24.180]  not postcards often they don't get read handwritten letters and envelopes mail to your congressional
[3:53:24.180 --> 3:53:31.620]  and senate leadership actually get read um and tell them what you're doing to report on their
[3:53:31.620 --> 3:53:36.260]  activities you know you call in radio stations regularly and talk on talk radio about what
[3:53:36.260 --> 3:53:41.780]  they're doing you do this you do that let them know that you actually have a voice that you use um
[3:53:41.780 --> 3:53:46.340]  and that you have something to say and you're asking them to consider what you're saying
[3:53:46.340 --> 3:53:50.740]  because otherwise you're saying it the world anyway so we can all do that and those are good
[3:53:50.740 --> 3:53:55.060]  things the other thing that often happens we complain all the time we complain about government
[3:53:55.060 --> 3:53:59.380]  we complain about the government people we interact with because bureaucracy is big
[3:53:59.380 --> 3:54:04.180]  but we need to remember to do the opposite um i i interface with government people all the time
[3:54:04.180 --> 3:54:10.180]  and sometimes i meet really great people that do really great work and sometimes i meet the opposite
[3:54:10.180 --> 3:54:16.100]  but when i meet the really good ones that are doing great work i make a point to try and dial
[3:54:16.100 --> 3:54:22.260]  into their boss but more importantly their boss's boss because her boss already knows it do that pass
[3:54:22.260 --> 3:54:26.820]  on a good word about someone occasionally you do it in the public and the private sector and
[3:54:26.820 --> 3:54:31.700]  and do it in uh in both ways i mean do it at restaurants when you're served well by a waiter
[3:54:31.700 --> 3:54:36.740]  or a waitress you know recognize the humanity in that soul that they did a great job and tell their
[3:54:36.740 --> 3:54:44.340]  boss's boss to manager that store do something positive that affects someone else in a positive
[3:54:44.340 --> 3:54:49.300]  way and you know what that's how this thing changes by human behavior how we address each
[3:54:49.300 --> 3:54:54.500]  other how we consider each other in the debate that we are passionate about you know when you
[3:54:54.500 --> 3:54:59.620]  think about manipulation and control and i was talking about from some of that going into this
[3:54:59.620 --> 3:55:06.260]  in the in the last segment you know the whole issue really boils down to misinformation and the
[3:55:06.260 --> 3:55:17.780]  propaganda wars and info wars we've been there for so long for so long uh info wars dot com you
[3:55:17.780 --> 3:55:23.460]  know my saying when i started this was changing the way we see the world and i still believe that
[3:55:23.460 --> 3:55:30.980]  and that comes from education and information so again to talk about where is it all headed you
[3:55:30.980 --> 3:55:35.380]  know it's probably about a cashless society what's happening in germany a lot of the people with
[3:55:35.380 --> 3:55:39.620]  money in germany are leaving because you can actually leave they don't tax your worldwide
[3:55:39.620 --> 3:55:45.540]  income there they tax only what you make when you reside there or within the e you in whatever
[3:55:45.540 --> 3:55:50.660]  country you reside in but you can leave the e you and you can pay tax the country you reside in
[3:55:50.660 --> 3:55:56.900]  so my business partner is german left germany not just because of the tax situation and the
[3:55:56.900 --> 3:56:05.140]  degradation was really it of the culture and a landscape of germany has changed so radically
[3:56:05.140 --> 3:56:09.940]  it's no longer the country it was europe's not the continent it was it's totally changed
[3:56:11.140 --> 3:56:20.100]  by lawlessness in a way that nobody ever expected and and the remedy is to screw down the population
[3:56:20.100 --> 3:56:27.220]  even more in lots of ways economically to bleed the productivity off the population
[3:56:27.220 --> 3:56:32.980]  and what we see is the big mass migration of the economics moving to asia where four billion
[3:56:32.980 --> 3:56:38.500]  people are going to move into the middle class in asia latin america and africa over the next 30
[3:56:38.500 --> 3:56:44.980]  to 40 years we are being deindustrialized in order to reindustrialize and industrialize even
[3:56:44.980 --> 3:56:51.780]  further on the east which not necessarily is a bad thing but it needs to be honestly reviewed
[3:56:51.780 --> 3:56:57.780]  in terms of its impact on this country donald trump is doing that by revisiting trade agreements
[3:56:57.780 --> 3:57:04.980]  he's renegotiated nafta with canada with mexico renegotiated japanese agreements has begun
[3:57:04.980 --> 3:57:10.420]  discussions and obviously discussions with europe and in and in deep discussions with china right
[3:57:10.420 --> 3:57:16.180]  now all this is important to the future of america two years left we don't have much time and we
[3:57:16.180 --> 3:57:23.620]  need that next four don't be distracted by the mainstream media's push get good information
[3:57:23.620 --> 3:57:29.860]  out and spread the word on what's really going on in the 21st century in the info wars what's
[3:57:29.860 --> 3:57:35.540]  important is your voice not just the voice of the hosts but you need to pass on the information
[3:57:35.540 --> 3:57:40.980]  you get here pick up my books and videos when you're done with them mail them to your congressman
[3:57:40.980 --> 3:57:46.340]  with a handwritten note get those books and videos at info wars store and pass them on to your
[3:57:46.340 --> 3:58:06.580]  congressional leadership maybe we see some changes to policy info wars the weapons
