[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.500 --> 00:09.500]  Waging war on corruption
[00:09.500 --> 00:28.500]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War
[00:39.500 --> 00:48.500]  Tuesday, March 14th, 2017, I'm your host Alex Jones, the one the only
[00:48.500 --> 00:52.500]  Michael Savage will be joining us coming up at the start of the second hour today
[00:52.500 --> 00:56.500]  We'll have open phones as well and some other guests I'll tell you about a little bit later
[00:56.500 --> 00:59.500]  Got an amazing guest in studio tomorrow
[00:59.500 --> 01:04.500]  Let folks know we've got a surprise for you in studio tomorrow
[01:04.500 --> 01:07.500]  The airplane carrying our guest is on its way right now
[01:07.500 --> 01:11.500]  Got a lot of other amazing guests can be popping in throughout the week as well
[01:11.500 --> 01:14.500]  Everybody knows I like surprises
[01:14.500 --> 01:17.500]  A lot of the listeners like surprises
[01:17.500 --> 01:20.500]  Sometimes I kind of go off the rails a little bit in a good way
[01:20.500 --> 01:25.500]  But I shouldn't have spent probably two hours of four hours yesterday on air
[01:25.500 --> 01:27.500]  Because I hosted the fourth hour of the day of the night as well
[01:27.500 --> 01:33.500]  Ranting and raving about fake news packaged in entertainment
[01:33.500 --> 01:38.500]  That of course being Saturday Night Live on my NBC and then Viacom that owns CBS
[01:38.500 --> 01:44.500]  And Showtime Channel with their show Homeland that steals my identity
[01:44.500 --> 01:50.500]  Admits it's supposed to be me and then plagiarizes real things I say
[01:50.500 --> 01:54.500]  I mean I'm the main writer I guess on that show now, literally
[01:54.500 --> 01:59.500]  And then puts horrible things in the middle of what I've said
[01:59.500 --> 02:04.500]  So that when people hear what I'm really saying, they then psychologically associate it with the lies
[02:04.500 --> 02:09.500]  That I'm a racist, that I frame people, that I put out fake news, that I'm a liar
[02:09.500 --> 02:11.500]  It's the same thing with Saturday Night Live
[02:11.500 --> 02:14.500]  And fake news came out of that again last night and today
[02:14.500 --> 02:18.500]  The Hill and hundreds of other publications, I mean I just saw them listed
[02:18.500 --> 02:20.500]  I looked at five or six of them last night and this morning
[02:20.500 --> 02:25.500]  Would not say why I said I wanted to have a bear knuckles fight with Alec Baldwin
[02:25.500 --> 02:28.500]  It was tongue in cheek for his lying about me and Donald Trump
[02:28.500 --> 02:32.500]  And they're like what's the big deal, it's a cute little space aliens skit
[02:32.500 --> 02:38.500]  About the 4th of July or Independence Day, you know the Alien Attack movie
[02:38.500 --> 02:41.500]  And Jones acts like a crazy person says he wants to fight him
[02:41.500 --> 02:46.500]  Didn't even tell their readers, in all these publications I looked at it was always the same
[02:46.500 --> 02:52.500]  That he said, playing the part of Donald Trump, that he learned that black people weren't human from Alec Jones
[02:52.500 --> 02:55.500]  Then the black people on the show get mad at Trump
[02:55.500 --> 02:59.500]  I mean that is the most base brainwashing there is
[02:59.500 --> 03:03.500]  And then of course it gets even worse in the fake media
[03:03.500 --> 03:10.500]  They won't even tell you in all these publications why I'm angry
[03:10.500 --> 03:15.500]  They just have a clip and that's the end of it
[03:15.500 --> 03:17.500]  No context
[03:17.500 --> 03:21.500]  They do it over and over and over again
[03:21.500 --> 03:23.500]  This is the type of brainwashing we're dealing with
[03:23.500 --> 03:25.500]  And there's more
[03:25.500 --> 03:29.500]  Colbert took a break I guess from attacking you shrewly this week
[03:29.500 --> 03:33.500]  And has gone after Conway
[03:33.500 --> 03:38.500]  Colbert mocks Conway by replacing show cameras with microwaves
[03:38.500 --> 03:45.500]  And they make the joke that she's completely insane saying that appliances could have been spying on the president
[03:45.500 --> 03:48.500]  You know I wonder where she got that
[03:48.500 --> 03:53.500]  Vault 7 that was released last week, admitting it all but I told you 18 years ago
[03:53.500 --> 03:58.500]  Or maybe this from 2012 315 2012 Wired Magazine
[03:58.500 --> 04:03.500]  CIA chief will spy on you through your dishwasher
[04:03.500 --> 04:07.500]  So she's informed so see hahaha she's so dumb
[04:07.500 --> 04:09.500]  Because they think their audience are idiots
[04:09.500 --> 04:14.500]  Oh here's a whole map from Vault 7 and the CIA and how they spy on you through your appliances
[04:14.500 --> 04:19.500]  Oh look the New York Times, sound waves to hack your appliances and your smart phone
[04:19.500 --> 04:22.500]  Oh yeah, told you about that 15 years ago, 16 years ago
[04:22.500 --> 04:24.500]  Because they were putting them in nationwide
[04:24.500 --> 04:28.500]  The fluorescent light bulbs can access your computers and take control
[04:28.500 --> 04:30.500]  But oh again, that's because I'm informed though
[04:30.500 --> 04:35.500]  They can just go hahaha Colbert laugh hahaha
[04:35.500 --> 04:40.500]  Total surveillance, total 1984 on steroids but it's okay
[04:40.500 --> 04:44.500]  Colbert's got the cute little you know short hair and the glasses and looks real trendy
[04:44.500 --> 04:46.500]  And if he laughs at you it's over
[04:46.500 --> 04:51.500]  Hahaha, Donald Trump will never be president, he said that too
[04:51.500 --> 04:54.500]  Ashley Beckford here for infowars.com
[04:54.500 --> 04:58.500]  I have an article from the telegraph linked on drudgerport.com
[04:58.500 --> 05:04.500]  This creepy facial recognition app lets users find strangers on Facebook by simply taking their picture
[05:04.500 --> 05:08.500]  This facial recognition app was created by British entrepreneur Jack Kenyon
[05:08.500 --> 05:15.500]  And guess what, people can identify others by matching a photo of them with their Facebook profile
[05:15.500 --> 05:19.500]  It scans more than a billion images per second
[05:19.500 --> 05:26.500]  You can find a person on the street, run their image through the app and find out exactly who that person is
[05:26.500 --> 05:29.500]  This will launch on iOS, March 21st
[05:29.500 --> 05:36.500]  But it's already been tested on more than 10,000 images to date with a 70% accuracy
[05:36.500 --> 05:39.500]  Is this the end of Autonomous Societies?
[05:39.500 --> 06:07.500]  If you're concerned about spy news, you need to tune in to the Alex Jones show at infowars.com.
[06:07.500 --> 06:13.500]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house
[06:13.500 --> 06:16.500]  Like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling

[07:12.500 --> 07:17.500]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets
[07:17.500 --> 07:25.500]  Seeker 12xInfoWarsLife is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems
[07:25.500 --> 07:30.500]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula
[07:30.500 --> 07:36.500]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes
[07:36.500 --> 07:43.500]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body, electrify your mind and body, and take your health to the next level

[08:27.500 --> 08:34.500]  If we don't all stand up for free speech and if we don't all stand up for our basic bill of rights and constitution, we're going to lose it
[08:34.500 --> 08:40.500]  Everything you see being done in Europe is then deployed here in the United States
[08:40.500 --> 08:52.500]  And we're seeing the very same censorship tools deployed in the last five years in Germany and in Austria and in France and in the Netherlands and in Sweden and in Denmark
[08:52.500 --> 09:02.500]  All the countries are adopting the very same systems of stealth censorship which then moves into open censorship and then it moves into this
[09:02.500 --> 09:10.500]  Remember just a year ago we tell you Twitter and Facebook and Google are getting ready to censor because they were making those announcements in policy reports
[09:10.500 --> 09:17.500]  And the media would make jokes and say Alex Jones is crazy, there's no plan to censor anybody, that doesn't exist, we don't do that in America
[09:17.500 --> 09:24.500]  And now they're announcing everywhere, oh we're getting our censorship tools in line with Communist China so they'll let us come back into China
[09:24.500 --> 09:32.500]  We have to prove ourselves in Europe and the US first censoring people and Zuckerberg and the rest of them have begun to prove themselves
[09:32.500 --> 09:34.500]  Here's AP Today
[09:34.500 --> 09:40.500]  German official wants 53 million dollar fines
[09:40.500 --> 09:42.500]  This is Associated Press
[09:42.500 --> 09:48.500]  German official wants 53 million dollar fines for social media hate post
[09:48.500 --> 09:56.500]  That's right, that means any nationalism mentioning that an immigrant or an illegal committed a crime, Milto stuff
[09:56.500 --> 10:06.500]  It's already 500 euro fines in Germany, they already hired the former Stasi to actually run it for Facebook, they then report you and the police come
[10:06.500 --> 10:15.500]  They actually throw people out of their section 8 housing in Germany and in Italy and now over their own hotels and their own paid for homes
[10:15.500 --> 10:21.500]  And put the invaders in, the military aged men, we have footage, we have mainstream news
[10:21.500 --> 10:29.500]  But if you criticize it, you could show it on the Italian news or German news and say how wonderful these old people were thrown out on the street
[10:29.500 --> 10:35.500]  And made way for the poor migrants, look they're all military aged men, look there's no women, look
[10:35.500 --> 10:40.500]  What's going on, ISIS says we're going to invade you with giant immigrant flows as a weapon
[10:40.500 --> 10:49.500]  Ergun of Turkey says we're going to use open borders as a weapon, let us politically rally in your countries, let us take your countries over
[10:49.500 --> 10:55.500]  Or we'll flood you with even more, that's right, give in to our Islamic terror or we'll flood you with even more
[10:55.500 --> 10:59.500]  Oh here, let us capitulate, let us do whatever you want
[10:59.500 --> 11:07.500]  And now, German official wants 53 million fines for social media hate post
[11:07.500 --> 11:13.500]  That's right, German official wants 53 million fines for social media hate post
[11:13.500 --> 11:18.500]  Every time they say, oh but they go on to say and fake news
[11:18.500 --> 11:25.500]  Which is defined as anything criticizing the dying dinosaur media or the corrupt governments that are being thrown out
[11:25.500 --> 11:34.500]  And the EU of course says if you try to leave the EU, they've told a bunch of countries, our new EU army will invade you
[11:34.500 --> 11:41.500]  That's not authoritarian, Germany plans to find social media sites over hate speech and fake news
[11:41.500 --> 11:45.500]  We're going to be getting into that, isn't that just precious
[11:45.500 --> 11:55.500]  Meanwhile, you have the real hate being spewed by so-called entertainment shows like SNL and Homeland, NBC and CBS respectively
[11:55.500 --> 12:01.500]  Where they have the person playing the president, Alec Baldwin, a top tier actor
[12:01.500 --> 12:08.500]  Posing as the president, stealing his identity and then saying, Alec Jones told me black people aren't human
[12:08.500 --> 12:15.500]  No context, no reality, no nothing, just pure cut to the black people looking angry and going, oh I get it, you're racist
[12:15.500 --> 12:20.500]  People say, oh that's just entertainment, just like when Colbert attacked me two weeks ago
[12:20.500 --> 12:25.500]  You work for Alec Jones, don't you?
[12:25.500 --> 12:32.500]  Yes, well the two of you were renting this house together, but his name, your roommate's name is on the lease
[12:32.500 --> 12:35.500]  I see you get out right now, I'm throwing him out, I'm going to start eviction
[12:35.500 --> 12:38.500]  Hey listen, blah blah blah
[12:38.500 --> 12:44.500]  And these folks are what I call classical liberals, nice folks, not right wing in any respect
[12:44.500 --> 12:49.500]  And you and your little puppy, your little doxin get out of here and moved in with his girlfriend
[12:49.500 --> 12:57.500]  Oh but it's just entertainment, I saw he hates gay people on Colbert and I'm gay, get out of here
[12:57.500 --> 13:04.500]  I'm a lesbian, you work for Alec Jones, get out of here
[13:04.500 --> 13:11.500]  Because Colbert took a clip of me saying, they say I'm anti-gay, I'm not anti-gay
[13:11.500 --> 13:15.500]  But regardless, you're thrown out of your house, these are fascist folks
[13:15.500 --> 13:22.500]  They sit there and they lie with their fake niche, so they have all their actors posing as reporters like Colbert
[13:22.500 --> 13:29.500]  Or posing as the president like Baldwin, and then I say, you know, I'd like to have for charity a million dollars
[13:29.500 --> 13:34.500]  Whoever loses the charity of their choice, to bare knuckles box, because Baldwin's known for beating up little guys
[13:34.500 --> 13:39.500]  And camera people and they're acting tough and stuff, I mean, give me a break
[13:39.500 --> 13:42.500]  But I realize he's older than me, so I would take on him and O'Reilly
[13:42.500 --> 13:45.500]  Because O'Reilly is also slandered in the fame, I'll take both, I'm serious
[13:45.500 --> 13:50.500]  I'll take both of you on in the ring and I will beat both your asses into a pulp
[13:50.500 --> 13:55.500]  Guaranteed, guaranteed, guaranteed, I want to do it
[13:55.500 --> 14:00.500]  And after I kick both your asses in the ring, it's going to show all these pansies and all these wimps
[14:00.500 --> 14:02.500]  That run their mouths how the real world works, okay?
[14:02.500 --> 14:06.500]  Just like politically, we are mopping the floor with you
[14:06.500 --> 14:09.500]  Not only probably breaking my hands on you
[14:09.500 --> 14:16.500]  And so, did they tell you why I'm angry at them? No
[14:16.500 --> 14:22.500]  Bill O'Reilly said, tonight we'll look at sexual predators online and then cut to a clip of me yelling and screaming
[14:22.500 --> 14:28.500]  Strangely enough about corrupt policing
[14:28.500 --> 14:32.500]  That's the greatest form of defamation you can engage in
[14:32.500 --> 14:36.500]  No one's ever said I'm a sexual predator, I have no criminal record, it just goes on and on
[14:36.500 --> 14:40.500]  But he just says it so it's okay, see, it becomes reality for the delusionoids
[14:40.500 --> 14:44.500]  The delusionals that just believe mainstream television
[14:44.500 --> 14:46.500]  And then what does Alec Baldwin do?
[14:46.500 --> 14:52.500]  He says, Alex Jones of him, Alex Jones of him Four Wars, very credible, a talk show host
[14:52.500 --> 14:58.500]  Told me that black people aren't humans
[14:58.500 --> 15:03.500]  This is the baseness and then they've got the nerve to start blocking us on Facebook, Google
[15:03.500 --> 15:06.500]  They're letting us advertise on Google saying we're fake news
[15:06.500 --> 15:09.500]  We're the opposite and everybody knows that
[15:09.500 --> 15:12.500]  That's why our audience is exploding
[15:12.500 --> 15:17.500]  And that's why there's this dwindling, you know, Michael Savage had four books ago
[15:17.500 --> 15:21.500]  He's a multiple New York Times number one best-selling author
[15:21.500 --> 15:24.500]  Over 40 years, he's got like six or seven number ones
[15:24.500 --> 15:30.500]  He's been on the chart like 50 times, oh yeah, he's written almost 50 books that I know of just on herbs
[15:30.500 --> 15:34.500]  Got an actual medical degree in it, but the point is he's coming on next hour
[15:34.500 --> 15:38.500]  Michael Savage, his new book, Trump's War, His Battle for America
[15:38.500 --> 15:42.500]  His book, Exposing China as the main threat three years ago, was sold nowhere
[15:42.500 --> 15:45.500]  No one would carry it in stores, the publisher got threatened
[15:45.500 --> 15:49.500]  And they just told him, sorry, we'll let you have your advance
[15:49.500 --> 15:52.500]  But no one's gonna buy your book, in fact we're not gonna even ship it
[15:52.500 --> 15:55.500]  We couldn't even get them to ship it to us, we'd already bought thousands
[15:55.500 --> 15:58.500]  They wouldn't even ship them to us
[15:58.500 --> 16:04.500]  I'm not kidding, they wouldn't deliver the book because the Communist Chinese said you don't do it
[16:04.500 --> 16:07.500]  Of course back there's like, oh the Chinese are involved in controlling America, I mean come on
[16:07.500 --> 16:10.500]  Now they're in the news, Chinese buying up all six production studios
[16:10.500 --> 16:13.500]  Chinese Communists dictating what Washington does
[16:13.500 --> 16:16.500]  Communist Chinese, 10,000 plus front companies
[16:16.500 --> 16:18.500]  Communist Chinese telling Hollywood what scripts they can have
[16:18.500 --> 16:22.500]  Communist Chinese producing a whole bunch of movies where Donald Trump's a terrorist
[16:22.500 --> 16:27.500]  Taken out by US Special Forces, one of them directed by Michael Bay
[16:27.500 --> 16:31.500]  Communist Chinese helping Facebook, Google and Twitter
[16:31.500 --> 16:36.500]  Sensor fake news, thank God Communist Chinese, that is so big
[16:36.500 --> 16:39.500]  But we're just conditioned to it, be walked on by everybody
[16:39.500 --> 16:43.500]  Hey, I just landed from China or Mexico, I'm gonna have my baby for free
[16:43.500 --> 16:47.500]  And it's gonna be a citizen and you're gonna pay me $30,000 a year for my baby
[16:47.500 --> 16:52.500]  Racist, oh yes, oh we're the Communist Chinese, the biggest mass murderers in the world
[16:52.500 --> 16:56.500]  Oppressing our own people, we have the moral high ground with our suicide nets and mobile execution fans
[16:56.500 --> 17:01.500]  We're ordering you to do what we say and censor your nationalist news
[17:01.500 --> 17:05.500]  Davos, the Chinese President, they'll tell you he's a dictator
[17:05.500 --> 17:08.500]  Met and assured world leaders that globalism will survive
[17:08.500 --> 17:13.500]  And that they will force America and Trump to accept the global order
[17:13.500 --> 17:17.500]  Every American should say, wow, the Communist Chinese
[17:17.500 --> 17:28.500]  Meeting with world corporate leaders about how they're gonna run our lives and tell us what to do
[17:28.500 --> 17:33.500]  I was told five years ago by one of the biggest reality TV show production companies
[17:33.500 --> 17:35.500]  They were trying to get me to take over this big show
[17:35.500 --> 17:40.500]  I mean, we had Jesse James in here last week, he talked about how he gets like two offers a week
[17:40.500 --> 17:42.500]  I get like two a month, not anymore
[17:42.500 --> 17:44.500]  For stupid reality shows
[17:44.500 --> 17:48.500]  But when they're half decent, like a shooting show or something that's Americana
[17:48.500 --> 17:52.500]  Then the work comes out, actually there's investors in the networks now
[17:52.500 --> 17:54.500]  And they just say you're presiding on ground, I go, that's fine
[17:54.500 --> 17:56.500]  Why do you keep wanting to have these meetings with me? I don't want to do it
[17:56.500 --> 17:59.500]  Like, oh well, I know, it's just the Chinese government's so invested now
[17:59.500 --> 18:01.500]  And I'm like, really, the Chinese, yeah
[18:01.500 --> 18:04.500]  And then they couldn't put out red dawn part two
[18:04.500 --> 18:07.500]  Because the Chinese said no, remember all that?
[18:07.500 --> 18:10.500]  So that's how I learned about this, was actually being out in Hollywood
[18:10.500 --> 18:13.500]  They're like, listen, the Chinese run things now, okay?
[18:13.500 --> 18:18.500]  So that's what it is to be, I guess a globalist minion
[18:18.500 --> 18:20.500]  I'm gonna skip the break
[18:20.500 --> 18:24.500]  Is to live under this, so that's all coming up today
[18:24.500 --> 18:29.500]  We've got the economic news, we've got Democrats announced a bill to revoke Trump's extreme vetting order
[18:29.500 --> 18:34.500]  Just seven countries that basically don't even have governments that are collapsed like Somalia, Sudan and Libya
[18:34.500 --> 18:40.500]  Oh, here, let's just let people fly in unvetted with passports they can get off the crackerjack box
[18:40.500 --> 18:44.500]  Or the back of a cereal box, I mean, totally fake
[18:44.500 --> 18:48.500]  The governments announced through it war with us that they hate America
[18:48.500 --> 18:52.500]  But we're gonna accept their paperwork because this snake woman, let me just look at her
[18:52.500 --> 18:56.500]  These mummies that run our lives, like Frankenstein with a wig on
[19:01.500 --> 19:04.500]  Talk about a blockhead, but you know, she rules you
[19:04.500 --> 19:09.500]  And you know what, she's got a will to rule you and your family and sees you as prey
[19:09.500 --> 19:14.500]  And so you know what, I guess you are, because we're putting up with this witch
[19:14.500 --> 19:16.500]  Aren't we?
[19:19.500 --> 19:24.500]  I'm gonna go to a Paul Joseph Watson report that's very important and informative
[19:24.500 --> 19:31.500]  In a moment, and then I'm gonna come back and get into cobear mox conway by replacing show's cameras with microphones
[19:31.500 --> 19:35.500]  With microwaves, see I had a Freudian slip, I just can't lie
[19:35.500 --> 19:41.500]  So their headlines are deception in the hill, and so my brain converted it to the truth
[19:41.500 --> 19:47.500]  Cobear mox conway by replacing show's cameras with microwaves, joking that she said appliances can spy on you
[19:47.500 --> 19:51.500]  Really, we have that from the CIA director in Wired Magazine
[19:51.500 --> 19:56.500]  Will spy on you through your dishwasher, and it's in all the vaults, seven news, and everywhere
[19:56.500 --> 20:01.500]  But it's okay, because cobear, he's snotty, he makes fun
[20:01.500 --> 20:08.500]  You know, folks talking about death panels in the Obamacare, which were there, or how it ripped people off
[20:08.500 --> 20:12.500]  Because you know, like Rubber said, thank God you're such dumb efforts
[20:12.500 --> 20:16.500]  So that's all coming up as well
[20:16.500 --> 20:23.500]  Ken Langwin, Trump could turn out to be one of the best presidents if we all just get behind him
[20:23.500 --> 20:27.500]  That is absolutely right, he talks about we have a limited window though
[20:27.500 --> 20:33.500]  I have some criticisms of the president and this Paul Ryan bill, I'm going to do that at the bottom of the hour
[20:33.500 --> 20:37.500]  I've just analyzed the bill, it's better than Obamacare
[20:37.500 --> 20:45.500]  And quite frankly, the country is so shot, and healthcare is so shot that it'll all collapse if they don't do this
[20:45.500 --> 20:52.500]  If you look at the Republican establishment worldview of keeping things going the same way, it's still untenable
[20:52.500 --> 20:59.500]  It's going to collapse just down the road, even if you rob the middle class and double charge people that are healthy
[20:59.500 --> 21:07.500]  And charge old people more that are healthy, and then give a bunch of young people who are young and need to learn to work
[21:07.500 --> 21:10.500]  People didn't get free healthcare 20 years ago, 50 years ago
[21:10.500 --> 21:17.500]  All these so-called charity hospitals that you see everywhere that run for profit now, but are, quote, charities
[21:17.500 --> 21:20.500]  By the Catholic Church and all the rest of it
[21:20.500 --> 21:25.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, doctors are supposed to work a third of the time for charity
[21:25.500 --> 21:30.500]  The hospitlers started modern medical systems, that was a Catholic order
[21:30.500 --> 21:35.500]  Hospitlers, they started it all
[21:35.500 --> 21:40.500]  We had the best healthcare in the world 50 years ago, and the lowest cost as well
[21:40.500 --> 21:44.500]  With royalty from England and the Netherlands all came to Houston to have their heart surgeries done
[21:44.500 --> 21:47.500]  They went to DC and New York for cancer treatment
[21:47.500 --> 21:53.500]  And now, it was just a joke, we're falling apart because we're ripped off by big corporations and the big banks
[21:53.500 --> 21:59.500]  That wrote Obamacare, the Republicans wrote 80% of Obamacare
[21:59.500 --> 22:05.500]  The horrible blank checks to loot things and super scams and the rest was added on by Obama
[22:05.500 --> 22:11.500]  To totally bankrupt it even quicker and go to socialism right away, which is even worse obviously
[22:11.500 --> 22:15.500]  So this is a looting program that is better than Obamacare
[22:15.500 --> 22:19.500]  And I told you, Trump is very liberal in a lot of ways, folks
[22:19.500 --> 22:22.500]  But see, he's cutting taxes, he's getting factories in
[22:22.500 --> 22:26.500]  It's very liberal to put $25 million of the college endowment money
[22:26.500 --> 22:31.500]  That's close to 25% of what he's got budgeted the next four years to the black colleges
[22:31.500 --> 22:34.500]  I mean, that's true affirmative action, but directly to it
[22:34.500 --> 22:38.500]  And it's not to prove points, it's an attempt to shore up a collapsing civilization
[22:38.500 --> 22:43.500]  With the infrastructure programs, the military rebuilding, all of it is a plan to save the country
[22:43.500 --> 22:46.500]  And we're so socialist and domesticated, it kind of capitulates
[22:46.500 --> 22:49.500]  Like Ron Paul said, we're so socialist now
[22:49.500 --> 22:53.500]  How do you wean folks off? Well, I like Rand Paul's plan
[22:53.500 --> 22:56.500]  If I can get the senator back on, if we can
[22:56.500 --> 23:01.500]  He wanted to come on last week, I wanted to respond to this because he ran through a laundry list of how this is a bad bill
[23:01.500 --> 23:04.500]  Maybe we should queue that up later and play it again
[23:04.500 --> 23:08.500]  It was at the very start of the interview, maybe we'll play that next segment
[23:08.500 --> 23:12.500]  And it's all true, I mean it's got bigger penalties, but it's privately done
[23:12.500 --> 23:16.500]  If you've been out of the healthcare system for 63 days
[23:16.500 --> 23:20.500]  It's a corporate tax to these groups and it has the idea that
[23:20.500 --> 23:24.500]  We shouldn't have to take care of people that aren't insured, make them get insured
[23:24.500 --> 23:29.500]  Well, because of the wages and the taxes and the regulations, people can't afford it most folks
[23:29.500 --> 23:33.500]  And so they're supposed to be able to go to get emergency care, charity care
[23:33.500 --> 23:36.500]  Which is still there, but being phased out
[23:36.500 --> 23:43.500]  I know a lot of people that have, quote, you know, super serious diseases that are going to cost millions of dollars to treat over the decades
[23:43.500 --> 23:46.500]  And they make good money, but they're uninsurable
[23:46.500 --> 23:49.500]  Even if they have a good job, it's hard to get insured
[23:49.500 --> 23:53.500]  And I explained to them, you can go have this charity by charity care
[23:53.500 --> 23:56.500]  They didn't believe me, they made phone calls, they called back with their folks who live in New York
[23:56.500 --> 23:59.500]  For Crohn's disease operation, removed some intestine
[23:59.500 --> 24:01.500]  This is like 10 years ago
[24:01.500 --> 24:07.500]  They brought him in, saw what they were doing, saw that they had been uninsured, saw that the drugs had cost too much
[24:07.500 --> 24:12.500]  And the top Crohn's doctor in the country did his surgery and he's been like 90% better
[24:12.500 --> 24:17.500]  Well, I was telling him all this, because it was just a video editor that wasn't my employee, it was a contractor at the time
[24:17.500 --> 24:20.500]  And I was explaining all this to him
[24:20.500 --> 24:27.500]  And that even when he had insurance, he'd go to places here and they'd just give him more remicade and all these drugs that didn't work
[24:27.500 --> 24:33.500]  And he looked at me, he said, there's no such thing, and he would go to Austin hospitals, they'd lie and say, there's no such thing
[24:33.500 --> 24:37.500]  Yes, there's such a thing, it's still law, but people don't know this
[24:37.500 --> 24:44.500]  See, my dad managed medical centers, not just dental centers, been a lobbyist at the state house, all of it
[24:44.500 --> 24:50.500]  Done lobbying work, and he knows all about it, I know all about it, I grew up all around it
[24:50.500 --> 24:55.500]  When I was like 20 years old or younger, but I had owned part of a hospital in Dallas
[24:55.500 --> 24:59.500]  Believe me, I know the ins and outs of medical stuff
[24:59.500 --> 25:05.500]  And I didn't used to believe my dad when I was 16 or 15 when he got my driver's license, he said, don't sign the organ donor card, son
[25:05.500 --> 25:12.500]  And I said, why don't you go, some hospitals will kill you, if you come in in a car wreck, hurt, your brain will be fine, they'll kill you, they'll take the organs on the spot
[25:12.500 --> 25:17.500]  But I did what he told me, and then about, like I said, five years later, I'm full of story many times, 60 minutes
[25:17.500 --> 25:26.500]  That a report on Dallas and Chicago hospitals killing people for their organs, and Austin's been caught doing it too
[25:26.500 --> 25:30.500]  Oh yeah, some of the most wicked bandits out there folks are in the medical care
[25:30.500 --> 25:37.500]  Anyways, let me just digress, because I got off subject there, when we come back, I'll play Paul Watson's report
[25:37.500 --> 25:44.500]  And then we will get into all the other news that I'm going to be breaking down here
[25:44.500 --> 25:51.500]  But Trump has done the first thing here in real policy, not just in rhetoric
[25:51.500 --> 25:58.500]  Because the torture stuff I thought was wrong, and some of his understanding of how the spy grid works was incorrect with the iPhone
[25:58.500 --> 26:06.500]  And I'm not going to make excuses for what Trump's doing, I know he wants to get some victories done, he wants to fix Obamacare
[26:06.500 --> 26:12.500]  Which is meant to wreck the whole medical system and will do it the next 12 months, not just the two years, he's absolutely right about that
[26:12.500 --> 26:19.500]  And I see his reasoning, I understand what the president is talking about
[26:19.500 --> 26:27.500]  But you've got to just repeal it and then be honest and make charity care come back and just point out that it's up to folks to get their own insurance
[26:27.500 --> 26:35.500]  And really start moving to turn the economy back on so that people can afford it
[26:35.500 --> 26:44.500]  And then push for companies that are successful enough to offer it, but most companies are hanging on by their toenails, folks
[26:44.500 --> 26:49.500]  Hanging upside down, and it's just meant to bankrupt all the small businesses
[26:49.500 --> 26:56.500]  The big mega corporations have actuated all in, they're the ones lobbying for all the regulations, all the controls, because it'll bankrupt everything here
[26:56.500 --> 27:03.500]  And then they'll just go to China that has no healthcare, no childcare, no environmental systems, 18 hour work days, hell on earth
[27:03.500 --> 27:14.500]  I saw some disinfo article on vice about how the US only has 4% higher wages than China
[27:14.500 --> 27:18.500]  China has the most manipulated financial numbers on earth, that's admitted
[27:18.500 --> 27:27.500]  China has people working in their skilled factories for less than a dollar an hour
[27:27.500 --> 27:35.500]  But you just read something like that in vice and it's such fake news
[27:35.500 --> 27:41.500]  Speaking of fake news
[27:41.500 --> 27:50.500]  Snoop Dogg says he's anti-gun, but he has all these rap videos about shooting and killing people, his latest rap videos about killing cops
[27:50.500 --> 27:59.500]  They're spraying cops with bullets and they have a Donald Trump character dressed up like a clown who they kill, who they shoot
[27:59.500 --> 28:04.500]  And he calls for basically killing the president
[28:04.500 --> 28:19.500]  And I just think about how it's so punk, and I mean punk like a punk in prison, it's so sick that Snoop Dogg knows fully well he's priming young people to be prepared for prison
[28:19.500 --> 28:28.500]  That he's getting them into a culture that's meant to destroy them and that they have what, 4,000 shootings a year in Chicago?
[28:28.500 --> 28:35.500]  3,000 plus of them black, 2,000 deaths, that's the last numbers I saw, and it's almost all black on black
[28:35.500 --> 28:43.500]  And it's the gangster culture that the CIA admittedly created in the 80s and 90s and deployed us destroying communities everywhere
[28:43.500 --> 28:49.500]  And then Snoop Dogg sits there and makes it all about white versus black
[28:49.500 --> 29:01.500]  And Snoop Dogg sits there with the system and again Viacom, CBS, MTV, Sumner Redstone, the same people that have these fake characters attacking myself and the president
[29:01.500 --> 29:11.500]  Putting words in our mouths on shows like Homeland and he goes out there knowingly to pimp not just black people but everybody else
[29:11.500 --> 29:26.500]  And then young people think it's so hard to act all confident and fuggish and snake like, it's just so low and so pathetic and so unmanly and so cowardly and so dishonorable
[29:26.500 --> 29:35.500]  Snoop Dogg, Alec Baldwin, this other punk actor, all of them are just parasites who know full well what they're doing
[29:35.500 --> 29:40.500]  We've got Paul Joseph Watson's breakdown of that coming up on the other side
[29:40.500 --> 29:44.500]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[29:44.500 --> 30:10.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[30:10.500 --> 30:15.500]  You all can identify others by matching a photo of them with their Facebook profile
[30:15.500 --> 30:19.500]  It scans more than a billion images per second
[30:19.500 --> 30:26.500]  You can find a person on the street, run their image through the app and find out exactly who that person is
[30:26.500 --> 30:36.500]  This will launch on iOS, March 21st, but it's already been tested on more than 10,000 images to date with a 70% accuracy
[30:36.500 --> 30:46.500]  Is this the end of Autonomous Societies? If you're concerned about spy news, you need to tune in to the Alex Jones Show at infowars.com
[30:46.500 --> 31:07.500]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned, it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children
[31:07.500 --> 31:18.500]  The Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children
[31:18.500 --> 31:21.500]  To the best job you can to purify your air
[31:21.500 --> 31:29.500]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves
[31:29.500 --> 31:31.500]  The general public doesn't
[31:31.500 --> 31:38.500]  Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean
[31:38.500 --> 31:45.500]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job
[31:45.500 --> 31:51.500]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsstore.com
[31:51.500 --> 32:01.500]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diet of processed junk
[32:01.500 --> 32:13.500]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula
[32:13.500 --> 32:19.500]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors
[32:19.500 --> 32:21.500]  We do everything we can to recapture them
[32:21.500 --> 32:29.500]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[32:29.500 --> 32:37.500]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence
[32:37.500 --> 32:45.500]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it
[32:45.500 --> 32:50.500]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself in ForwarsLife.com today
[33:16.500 --> 33:21.500]  Back week night 7 o'clock, Central Info Wars Nightly News, Sundays 4-6pm I do a live transmission
[33:21.500 --> 33:31.500]  Coming up in our future I plan on launching more live transmissions, more live broadcasts because we have absolutely got to intensify our attacks on the globalist
[33:31.500 --> 33:36.500]  We have to PRESS THE ATTACK!
[33:36.500 --> 33:46.500]  Alright, let's get into the news here because there is a lot of it and I want to give Paul Watson's report and more
[33:46.500 --> 33:56.500]  I am a realist, I'm also a pragmatist and you have to understand as a real pragmatist I understand the globalists are not going to give us quarter
[33:56.500 --> 34:02.500]  They're not negotiating with us, they're not backing off, they're not giving in
[34:02.500 --> 34:10.500]  They intend to bring down modern civilization, they intend to cause massive force population reduction, that's their stated goal
[34:10.500 --> 34:19.500]  And dependency is the problem and I understand Trump wants to prove the establishment wrong and actually wants to fix Obamacare and make a better system
[34:19.500 --> 34:31.500]  But it's still redistribution of wealth from the middle class, from the working class, from the rich to people that in many cases are not working
[34:31.500 --> 34:39.500]  Yes Obamacare is far worse, yes it was meant to destroy the system, yes as Trump says we've got to do this now to prop it up
[34:39.500 --> 34:48.500]  But you can't have a house that's already half burned down and then just put the fire out and then move back into the burned out house
[34:48.500 --> 34:51.500]  Just let the thing burn down folks
[34:51.500 --> 34:59.500]  Obama was going to replace it with a bigger scam and more social control and big corporations managing it
[34:59.500 --> 35:04.500]  Corporate government rule is the globalist model, that's why the Republicans helped write the thing
[35:04.500 --> 35:09.500]  And what Paul Ryan is putting through is sickening
[35:09.500 --> 35:16.500]  And he sits there and lectures everybody and says that we're all going to be screwed if we don't do this and healthcare is going to collapse
[35:16.500 --> 35:24.500]  It was designed to collapse, so a lighter version of it bro is a scam
[35:24.500 --> 35:30.500]  Paul Ryan replaces Obamacare's insurance penalties with even larger penalties
[35:33.500 --> 35:40.500]  This is the first time that Trump is actually trying to appeal the actual leftist voters out there
[35:40.500 --> 35:50.500]  And I said look I get sitting $25 billion to the black colleges to try to actually empower groups that have been annihilated by the MTV culture and the rest of it
[35:50.500 --> 35:55.500]  But the media just totally ignores it
[35:55.500 --> 36:00.500]  Just like this plan that's a better version of Obamacare
[36:00.500 --> 36:06.500]  Still a globalist operation
[36:06.500 --> 36:12.500]  So quite frankly 50 plus days in I was surprised that Trump had pretty much a perfect record
[36:12.500 --> 36:17.500]  But this is not good
[36:17.500 --> 36:26.500]  And Rand Paul is absolutely right, you have Michael Savage coming up later to break all this down
[36:26.500 --> 36:30.500]  Before I go any further, the bottom line is this
[36:30.500 --> 36:42.500]  We can't give up because the globalists aren't going to leave us alone, they're never going to stop trying to go after productive, strong, upright people of every color of every creed of the human race
[36:42.500 --> 36:47.500]  And we have to get aggressive and we have to be politically involved
[36:47.500 --> 36:53.500]  But we're designed to be that way, it's the animating contest, it's not like I'm asking people to go out and bust rocks
[36:53.500 --> 36:58.500]  We can't let these scumbags win, we can't roll over and give up
[36:58.500 --> 37:06.500]  And it's so unfulfilling to just go be a self-serving person that goes to the movies and goes to the bar and goes and plays pool every day
[37:06.500 --> 37:14.500]  Or goes and lays out at the beach and reads novels and screws around and enjoys themselves, that is the most empty lifestyle in the world
[37:14.500 --> 37:19.500]  I've gone through periods when I was like that
[37:19.500 --> 37:27.500]  Maybe when I was 19, had decent jobs, making money, dating girls
[37:27.500 --> 37:33.500]  But I knew bad stuff was going on in the world, I had to stand up against it, it was an instinct, it was a spirit
[37:33.500 --> 37:40.500]  It had to be done and we have to rekindle that spirit, that's what the enemy is trying to demoralize us constantly
[37:40.500 --> 37:44.500]  And trying to break us down and trying to tell us we're ugly and failed and give up
[37:44.500 --> 37:52.500]  Is because people like Diane Feinstein want to break your will, she thinks she's stronger than you
[37:52.500 --> 37:56.500]  Because she has this vampiric lust for power
[37:56.500 --> 38:03.500]  Now before I get into Paul Watson's report and then I want to get some into what Rand Paul said last week and then into the other economic and military news
[38:03.500 --> 38:06.500]  And the censorship news
[38:06.500 --> 38:14.500]  I want to just remind the viewers and listeners that as the censorship intensifies, one of the only ways we're able to get in touch with you and stay in contact with you is via email
[38:14.500 --> 38:18.500]  Something I've been lacking at over the years, getting our listeners and viewers to be part of
[38:18.500 --> 38:28.500]  You go there or if you already have the email open at exclusive articles, exclusive videos and huge discounts every single day
[38:28.500 --> 38:34.500]  Superfemale vitality is 50% off with the promo code that we emailed out yesterday
[38:34.500 --> 38:40.500]  That is a giant savings, obviously, it's an amazing herbal compound of concentrate
[38:40.500 --> 38:48.500]  Now to naturally increase libido, stamina, overall mood is the experience I and others have had with the Supermale version, also Superfemale works fine as well
[38:48.500 --> 38:51.500]  And men, two different versions, they're very close
[38:51.500 --> 38:56.500]  Communication is key and as the globalists focus their attack on Donald Trump, they are clamping down on free speech too
[38:56.500 --> 39:01.500]  Facebook is pushing censorship to please their new Chinese masters in censoring info wars
[39:01.500 --> 39:06.500]  That's why more than ever, info wars newsletter is the most reliable way to stay ahead of the globalist schemes

[39:40.500 --> 39:52.500]  Also, we're about to sell out of the Micro, Myco ZX, Anti-Fungus, Anti-Yeast, Anti-Candida natural formulation that's extremely powerful
[39:52.500 --> 39:58.500]  And I did up it to the retail price just because we need to fund our operation and they're always pointing out if something's already going to sell out
[39:58.500 --> 40:00.500]  Why do you keep it on sale that sells out?
[40:00.500 --> 40:02.500]  That's dumb, then you have money trouble
[40:02.500 --> 40:06.500]  Look, Google just blew up our future funding for the next year along on advertising
[40:06.500 --> 40:10.500]  I'm like, you know what, you're right, up it to $54
[40:10.500 --> 40:11.500]  Well worth it
[40:11.500 --> 40:19.500]  Other brands that are similar, like $100, it's very expensive, very concentrated with these acids and compounds and things that accelerate the herbs that are in it
[40:19.500 --> 40:26.500]  We need to support infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or triple-A 253-3139
[40:26.500 --> 40:36.500]  We also have the ultimate paleo formula with the bone broth, turmeric, and so much more at infowarslife.com, caveman, now available
[40:36.500 --> 40:42.500]  And out of the gates, 50% off on the Trump Pints for President 2020 shirt
[40:44.500 --> 40:50.500]  That says Keeping America Great, and on the back, America 1st of 1776, infowars.com
[40:50.500 --> 40:58.500]  And this is all about free speech, meeting like-minded people and promoting the truth, and standing up against the bullies that tell folks that they can't wear their colors proud
[40:58.500 --> 41:03.500]  It's a red, white, and blue shirt, which again, the Ninth Circuit is ruled as illegal in California schools
[41:03.500 --> 41:13.500]  And I even have articles right here today, again, where if teams have red, white, and blue colors, they're told that they can't have them at basketball games because it hurts the Muslims' feelings
[41:13.500 --> 41:14.500]  I'm not kidding
[41:14.500 --> 41:18.500]  Well, then you don't feel like you should be part of the country if the red, white, and blue upsets you
[41:18.500 --> 41:22.500]  I mean, why are we submitting to them?
[41:22.500 --> 41:30.500]  Ergon has now declared the dictator of Turkey, and he is the supreme ruler of Europe, basically
[41:30.500 --> 41:41.500]  Now there it is, W-H-O-T-V-N-B-C, Valley students say USA themed student section, not aimed at North refugee athletes
[41:41.500 --> 41:44.500]  That's the name of the teams, North refugee athletes
[41:44.500 --> 41:49.500]  Gosh, yes, no, Americanism's back, baby, loving what made the country great
[41:49.500 --> 41:58.500]  God, guns, and guts, free market, having your own life, being free, having an open society, true Thomas Jeffersonian liberalism
[41:58.500 --> 42:05.500]  And the anti-free speech cult is so bad, they're banning, oh, I'm sorry, scales now at colleges
[42:05.500 --> 42:08.500]  Because scales could trigger somebody
[42:08.500 --> 42:11.500]  And they're banning white boards because somebody might write something that's offensive
[42:11.500 --> 42:14.500]  That's like saying we're banning all books because someone might write something offensive
[42:14.500 --> 42:17.500]  It's beyond burning books, it's banning the written word
[42:17.500 --> 42:27.500]  This is beyond cult, our colleges on purpose aren't out of control, they're designed to create serious psychological mental illnesses
[42:27.500 --> 42:33.500]  You go to South by Southwest, it's taking place today, and I don't plan to be a beach body in the greatest guy around or anything, okay?
[42:33.500 --> 42:37.500]  I mean, I've done some living
[42:37.500 --> 42:41.500]  And if you ain't loving, you ain't living
[42:41.500 --> 42:44.500]  To quote George Strait
[42:44.500 --> 42:49.500]  But you go down there, I've been down there last year, I mean it was just like these zombies
[42:49.500 --> 42:53.500]  All kind of shuffling, looking at their phones in mass
[42:53.500 --> 42:57.500]  Just all lined up trying to get a job, trying to be successful, trying to be famous
[42:57.500 --> 43:02.500]  And the whole thing is even a bigger con job than college where 90% of the degrees you get are worthless
[43:02.500 --> 43:11.500]  It is just all a giant scam to suck money off people and to go hear boring losers, you know, and globalists and
[43:11.500 --> 43:21.500]  Barack Obama and Chink Ugurt and all these people spew garbage at you
[43:21.500 --> 43:25.500]  Even the Verge admits it's just one more place to stare at your phone
[43:25.500 --> 43:30.500]  I've got
[43:30.500 --> 43:34.500]  A very interesting guest coming into the studio tomorrow to talk about this, he's going to go out and
[43:34.500 --> 43:44.500]  Even today, when his plane lands the next hour, we're going to go out and actually examine this from the example of somebody in the very best
[43:44.500 --> 43:49.500]  Preparedness, fitness, mental preparation, you name it
[43:49.500 --> 43:52.500]  Very famous member of SEAL Team 6
[43:52.500 --> 43:55.500]  Versus what these people turned into
[43:55.500 --> 44:00.500]  So you kind of have like the person in about the best development a human can get in for their age
[44:00.500 --> 44:04.500]  And training and understanding and leadership and intelligence
[44:04.500 --> 44:09.500]  And then kind of something like me kind of in the middle and then the blobs
[44:09.500 --> 44:14.500]  And I don't say that about the blobs, meaning they're gone folks
[44:14.500 --> 44:23.500]  I saw another mashup piece, I sent it to Niko, I forget exactly what publication it was, let me look it up
[44:23.500 --> 44:34.500]  And I've become one of the top comedians in the country, literally they're even saying that in newspapers, tongue in cheek
[44:34.500 --> 44:37.500]  That's AV Club
[44:37.500 --> 44:43.500]  With daily mashups of things I've said in 20 years on video into these comedy pieces
[44:43.500 --> 44:47.500]  And they think it's destroying me or hurting me, but we have the metrics
[44:47.500 --> 44:51.500]  It's sending us giant hordes of young people
[44:51.500 --> 44:56.500]  My son loves it, his school loves it, and it's fun, I like being made fun of
[44:56.500 --> 45:00.500]  You think I'm like some fake conservative from 50 years ago that's all in a stuffed suit
[45:00.500 --> 45:08.500]  Buffy, how dare they'll make a joke about me or judge schmales
[45:08.500 --> 45:14.500]  And then it's got the comments in here
[45:14.500 --> 45:25.500]  And like most of the comments when you read them are, this is the guy that says whites are superior to black people, never said that
[45:25.500 --> 45:31.500]  This is the guy that says he's superior genetically to Denzel Washington when he's old and ugly
[45:31.500 --> 45:35.500]  What are you talking about? That's mental illness
[45:35.500 --> 45:37.500]  I've never said any such thing
[45:37.500 --> 45:50.500]  It's like this mental illness where it's like they're fiction writers and they make stuff up and they say I produced an album called I Don't Like Blacks 2018
[45:50.500 --> 45:55.500]  And it's like pseudo-intellectuals
[45:55.500 --> 46:03.500]  And I feel sorry for these people because I was reading these comments this morning and it was wild
[46:03.500 --> 46:15.500]  We've changed the world, we've got presidents being elected all over the world to fight globalism and have a new pro-empowerment productivity renaissance
[46:15.500 --> 46:19.500]  We're having huge success, we reach 45 million people a week conservatively
[46:19.500 --> 46:24.500]  We're creating spinoff movements that are reaching even more people
[46:24.500 --> 46:28.500]  And then they have these weird celebrations, I see it too about Drudge
[46:28.500 --> 46:36.500]  He's number one but he's a loser, or Alex is big but he's a loser, it's like Alex is mentally ill or Alex is an outcast
[46:36.500 --> 46:40.500]  And they're projecting everything they think they are
[46:40.500 --> 46:45.500]  And they're these alone people in their mother's basements, all the demographic show at the average liberal
[46:45.500 --> 46:51.500]  Like 90% below the age of 35 lives in their mom's basement, has no job, plays video games all day
[46:51.500 --> 46:58.500]  And then they just sit there together celebrating how people that are active, aggressive, successful
[46:58.500 --> 47:03.500]  Genetically I'm successful, I've got a lot of kids, they're successful
[47:03.500 --> 47:07.500]  My family, family line's been successful
[47:07.500 --> 47:11.500]  By every benchmark I'm very successful
[47:11.500 --> 47:15.500]  And then they go have little ceremonies and celebrations that I'm not successful
[47:15.500 --> 47:20.500]  Because they need to live in a delusional world where they create a strong man of who I am
[47:20.500 --> 47:24.500]  And then they declare themselves better than that person
[47:24.500 --> 47:31.500]  It's the same thing the white supremacists do, they'll just say Alex Jones works for Israel blah blah blah
[47:31.500 --> 47:37.500]  He's a bad guy, just to make themselves feel powerful and put themselves above me
[47:37.500 --> 47:42.500]  And I noticed that some of the black supremacists do that too, but really not many
[47:42.500 --> 47:49.500]  It's mainly weird white young people that have all this weird white guilt and no identity
[47:49.500 --> 47:56.500]  And then they go and comment and just make stuff up
[47:56.500 --> 48:01.500]  Like hey dude, if you're gonna say I don't think that I think I'm better than Denzel Washington
[48:01.500 --> 48:04.500]  What the hell are you talking about?
[48:04.500 --> 48:09.500]  I like Denzel Washington movies, I think the guys good looking, in fact they make the point
[48:09.500 --> 48:13.500]  Oh look, Denzel Washington's 20 years older and looks younger than Alex, absolutely
[48:13.500 --> 48:15.500]  What did I ever say about Denzel Washington?
[48:15.500 --> 48:19.500]  You just make up some fantasy that I think I'm better than Denzel Washington
[48:19.500 --> 48:23.500]  Just like Alec Baldwin pretends to be the president
[48:23.500 --> 48:28.500]  And then says Alex Jones told me black people aren't humans
[48:28.500 --> 48:31.500]  And I bet money, there's a bunch of these comments in here
[48:31.500 --> 48:37.500]  I bet this guy called Cookie Monster, this handle, probably saw Saturday Night Live and thinks
[48:37.500 --> 48:40.500]  If they made that joke about me it must be true
[48:40.500 --> 48:43.500]  See they're trying to brand me as David Duke
[48:43.500 --> 48:48.500]  But David Duke doesn't even say stuff that far
[48:48.500 --> 48:53.500]  All they're doing is branding themselves at Saturday Night Live as fake and as frauds
[48:53.500 --> 48:55.500]  And the fake news is doing that too
[48:55.500 --> 48:58.500]  But with the thinking people, that's in one group
[48:58.500 --> 49:01.500]  Of every color, of every region, of every, you name it
[49:01.500 --> 49:03.500]  Just a weight sentient beings
[49:03.500 --> 49:07.500]  And over here you've got the massive people though that literally are living in fantasy land
[49:07.500 --> 49:11.500]  The delusionoids, they call them the deplorables, they're the delusionoids
[49:11.500 --> 49:13.500]  The delusionoids
[49:15.500 --> 49:20.500]  And they've got a lot of guts in the system to put this out
[49:20.500 --> 49:25.500]  But it works because people don't differentiate fiction with non-fiction now
[49:25.500 --> 49:27.500]  So mainstream media is the fake news
[49:27.500 --> 49:31.500]  They're organizing with the communist Chinese to censor the liberty movement
[49:31.500 --> 49:33.500]  Man, that's fighting words
[49:33.500 --> 49:37.500]  That's foreign espionage, that's a foreign takeover
[49:37.500 --> 49:40.500]  Of our media, our entertainment, our infrastructure
[49:40.500 --> 49:44.500]  And I see the leftist commenting in computer world and you name it
[49:44.500 --> 49:48.500]  Oh good, China, help us please shut down Alex Jones and President Trump
[49:48.500 --> 49:50.500]  There's actual comments
[49:50.500 --> 49:53.500]  Oh yes, communist Chinese are really going to treat you real good
[49:53.500 --> 49:55.500]  You sit here in the lap of freedom
[49:57.500 --> 50:03.500]  You sit here in the lap of the west and then bitch about it when you have no idea what you're allying yourself with
[50:05.500 --> 50:08.500]  North Korea is a dropping of China
[50:08.500 --> 50:10.500]  Little pile they left in the corner there
[50:10.500 --> 50:12.500]  Horrible enslavement
[50:12.500 --> 50:16.500]  But you think it's cute when Dennis Rodman goes over there and hangs out with Kim Jong-un
[50:16.500 --> 50:20.500]  In just as a little potbellied goblin launches missiles at Japan
[50:20.500 --> 50:24.500]  And we've got to have B-52 bombers on the tarmac with nukes now in South Korea
[50:24.500 --> 50:27.500]  Ready to nuke the entire north
[50:27.500 --> 50:31.500]  They're not just going to drop bombs on Pyongyang, they're going to drop bombs all along the border
[50:31.500 --> 50:36.500]  Where he's got reportedly 100,000 pieces of artillery aimed at Seoul
[50:36.500 --> 50:40.500]  Can't feed his people, but boy, does little Mr. Weenie
[50:40.500 --> 50:44.500]  Does little Weenie, little Weenie, Kim Jong-un
[50:44.500 --> 50:46.500]  Have a bunch of missiles
[50:46.500 --> 50:48.500]  They always do, that's your state, that's what you worship
[50:48.500 --> 50:52.500]  See America's the big liberal open society freedom
[50:52.500 --> 50:54.500]  Wild Wild West, baby
[50:54.500 --> 50:59.500]  And you people want to control words and ban whiteboards and ban scales
[50:59.500 --> 51:02.500]  And ban the word mother and father, you're the cult
[51:02.500 --> 51:06.500]  You're not the cool people
[51:06.500 --> 51:08.500]  Got it?
[51:08.500 --> 51:11.500]  You don't get it
[51:11.500 --> 51:14.500]  You morons don't know the life I've led, what I've done, any of it
[51:14.500 --> 51:18.500]  You sit there in your mommy's basement
[51:18.500 --> 51:22.500]  When I've lived more than you at 40, let's say you're 40
[51:22.500 --> 51:24.500]  By the time I was 14 years old, guaranteed
[51:24.500 --> 51:27.500]  You sit there in your mommy's basement
[51:27.500 --> 51:33.500]  As we change the world and you lie about us as if it's some magic power you discovered
[51:33.500 --> 51:35.500]  Everybody knows 6 and 7 year olds tend to lie a lot
[51:35.500 --> 51:37.500]  It's like a new thing they discovered, it's real cool
[51:37.500 --> 51:40.500]  Everybody's laughing at the kid when they're lying constantly
[51:40.500 --> 51:42.500]  And they don't stop lying about the time they're 10 or so
[51:42.500 --> 51:44.500]  The kid's got a problem
[51:44.500 --> 51:50.500]  You're in your mommy's basement, get out of your pampers now
[51:50.500 --> 51:53.500]  And I don't respond to you meanly because I want to hurt you
[51:53.500 --> 51:56.500]  I know you only respond to ridicule, that's at the level you're at
[51:56.500 --> 51:59.500]  In junior high
[51:59.500 --> 52:01.500]  Arrested development, so I'm reaching out to you
[52:01.500 --> 52:04.500]  Like junior high, you're all over there eating your buggers in the corner
[52:04.500 --> 52:06.500]  Laughing at adults living in the real world
[52:06.500 --> 52:10.500]  It's time for you to grow up sunny and get out of mommy's basement
[52:10.500 --> 52:13.500]  And stop being mad at people that have done things
[52:13.500 --> 52:17.500]  Because that's what this really is, is a bunch of little kids sitting around mad at people
[52:17.500 --> 52:21.500]  That are actually doing something
[52:21.500 --> 52:24.500]  So, let's go to Paul Joseph Watson's report
[52:24.500 --> 52:28.500]  And I've got an excerpt coming up from the Rand Paul interview on healthcare
[52:28.500 --> 52:32.500]  And why it's a bad deal, I agree with him, this is what Trump's doing is wrong
[52:32.500 --> 52:36.500]  I understand it's going to save healthcare overalls, Obamacare was meant to sabotage it
[52:36.500 --> 52:39.500]  You could argue that that's the only reason you can say Trump's right
[52:39.500 --> 52:45.500]  I still think it's the wrong course, but he wants victories, he wants to show he's getting stuff done
[52:45.500 --> 52:48.500]  And I've disagreed with him before and he's turned out to be right
[52:48.500 --> 52:50.500]  But I just cannot reserve judgment here, I have to say I think it's bad
[52:50.500 --> 52:52.500]  Trump's done his first bad thing
[52:52.500 --> 52:57.500]  Let's go ahead and go to Paul Joseph Watson on Snoop Pimp
[52:57.500 --> 53:00.500]  If you're not a TV viewer, you really should see this
[53:00.500 --> 53:02.500]  It's on inforwars.com and presidentplanet.com
[53:02.500 --> 53:05.500]  We're going to retweet it right now at Real Ox Jones, please spread it
[53:05.500 --> 53:09.500]  And also post it on your Facebook, use those enemy channels while they're still available
[53:09.500 --> 53:12.500]  Because you have to see the crime graphics during this to understand
[53:12.500 --> 53:17.500]  Literally how these black rap leaders were hired, Snoop's one of the people to
[53:17.500 --> 53:22.500]  Literally prime black folks for president here it is
[53:22.500 --> 53:26.500]  Oh look he's so cool, Snoop
[53:26.500 --> 53:31.500]  45 year old has been rapper Snoop Dogg is trying to escape
[53:31.500 --> 53:37.500]  Total irrelevance by releasing a video in which he shoots a clown version of Donald Trump
[53:37.500 --> 53:40.500]  The song also promotes violence against police
[53:40.500 --> 53:42.500]  The police from a black man's point of view
[53:42.500 --> 53:46.500]  Spray that s***, say that s***, we right in front of you, each and every one of you
[53:46.500 --> 53:48.500]  Right, so let me get this straight
[53:48.500 --> 53:52.500]  Your recommendation to heal tensions between the black community and the police
[53:52.500 --> 53:56.500]  Is for black people to just start spraying cops with bullets
[53:56.500 --> 53:59.500]  Yeah, great idea, you f***ing idiot
[53:59.500 --> 54:06.500]  It's this very glorification of violence that has led to black people having more violent confrontations with police
[54:06.500 --> 54:12.500]  It's this very gangster sheik that has led to the bloodbath of black on black murders
[54:12.500 --> 54:21.500]  And it's partly your fault, Snoop Dogg is one of the prime culprits for brainwashing African Americans into thinking violent crime is cool
[54:21.500 --> 54:23.500]  Ruining countless lives
[54:23.500 --> 54:27.500]  But he really cares about black people, yeah give me a break
[54:27.500 --> 54:33.500]  You need somebody hit, you need somebody touch, you need somebody scared, you need somebody shook up
[54:33.500 --> 54:37.500]  That's what street soldier does, by any means necessary at all times
[54:37.500 --> 54:47.500]  It's no wonder the KKK died out, all the white racists just sat back and laughed as they watched hip hop music decimate black communities
[54:47.500 --> 54:56.500]  Afflicting generations of young black people with a self-immolating cultural narrative that led to soaring homicides, a mass incarceration
[54:56.500 --> 54:58.500]  But Snoop really cares about black people
[54:58.500 --> 55:06.500]  Remember in 2013 when Snoop released this track, No Guns Allowed while Decraying Firearms Violence
[55:06.500 --> 55:10.500]  We've seen too much bloodshed involving guns and we want to prevent the next incident from happening
[55:10.500 --> 55:13.500]  That's what it's all about, trying to bring awareness and push love and peace
[55:13.500 --> 55:19.500]  So four years ago you were all about promoting love and peace to solve gun violence
[55:19.500 --> 55:25.500]  And now you put out an entire video encouraging people to commit gun violence
[55:25.500 --> 55:34.500]  So a dude who's been arrested and charged with illegal gun possession multiple times
[55:34.500 --> 55:38.500]  A dude who raps about shooting people with AK-47s
[55:38.500 --> 55:44.500]  A dude who's written song after song after song glorifying gun violence
[55:44.500 --> 55:47.500]  He's the poster child for gun safety
[55:47.500 --> 55:50.500]  Give me a f***ing break
[55:50.500 --> 55:58.500]  Snoop's not gonna tell you about the 93% of black people in America who were killed by other black people, is he?
[55:58.500 --> 56:02.500]  He's not gonna tell you that more white people are killed by cops in America
[56:02.500 --> 56:08.500]  Despite black people committing violent crimes at 7-10 times the rate that white people do
[56:08.500 --> 56:13.500]  No, he's not gonna tell you that because he's a race pimp and a total f***ing hypocrite
[56:13.500 --> 56:17.500]  The final call, see reparations but we took it, for all of the s*** your mother f***ing done did
[56:17.500 --> 56:20.500]  Now it ain't no fun when they're ready to get the gun
[56:22.500 --> 56:26.500]  So Snoop wants reparations because black people were slaves 200 years ago
[56:26.500 --> 56:32.500]  Okay, so where do I apply for my reparations given that my ancestors were enslaved by Arabs for way longer
[56:32.500 --> 56:36.500]  And under far more brutal conditions than African Americans
[56:36.500 --> 56:41.500]  Remember when the left said depictions of Obama as a clown were racist
[56:41.500 --> 56:48.500]  Now it's not only trendy to depict Trump as a clown, it's okay to symbolically assassinate him
[56:48.500 --> 56:57.500]  Imagine if a conservative music star like Ted Nugent had put out a music video in which he mock, murdered Barack Obama
[56:57.500 --> 57:04.500]  Imagine the outrage, the truth is that the left wants some lunatic to try and assassinate Donald Trump
[57:04.500 --> 57:09.500]  Because they're so progressive and tolerant like that, they've been pushing this narrative for over a year
[57:09.500 --> 57:17.500]  Every single hip-hop song that advocates violence against Trump or his supporters has been praised by the establishment media
[57:17.500 --> 57:20.500]  This is part of their resistance strategy
[57:20.500 --> 57:26.500]  The mainstream media and the entertainment industry is radicalizing extremists with this rhetoric
[57:26.500 --> 57:33.500]  They radicalized the left wing anti-Trump journalists who sent bomb threats to Jewish community centers
[57:33.500 --> 57:41.500]  They radicalized the Russian hackers obsessed loon from California who scaled the White House fence to try and get to Trump
[57:41.500 --> 57:46.500]  Snoop Dogg is part of this hysteria and he's a complete idiot
[57:46.500 --> 57:56.500]  He's been a pioneering influence in a culture that's done incredible damage to black people for the last 25 years
[57:56.500 --> 58:02.500]  Damage that Trump is now trying to fix by helping the inner cities with the aid of Ben Carson
[58:02.500 --> 58:07.500]  So Snoop Dogg, go back to your brain-addled weed-smoking marathons
[58:07.500 --> 58:11.500]  Go back to your aging irrelevance and shut the f**k up
[58:11.500 --> 58:14.500]  You've done enough damage, as it is
[58:16.500 --> 58:22.500]  Oh, Alec Baldwin hasn't responded yet to my challenge to bear an uncle box me for lying and saying I'm a racist that hates black people
[58:22.500 --> 58:23.500]  Maybe I should just sue him
[58:23.500 --> 58:29.500]  Or now the punk Ron Perlman comes out and says he wants to fight me if Alec Baldwin won't
[58:29.500 --> 58:32.500]  Another phony actor tough guy
[58:32.500 --> 58:34.500]  Hey, we live in the real world, guy
[58:34.500 --> 58:36.500]  We live in the real world
[58:36.500 --> 59:05.500]  We live in the real world, guy
[59:05.500 --> 59:09.500]  You said when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing it for years
[59:09.500 --> 59:12.500]  People that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding
[59:12.500 --> 59:13.500]  What they really say about them
[59:13.500 --> 59:16.500]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it
[59:16.500 --> 59:19.500]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing
[59:19.500 --> 59:23.500]  The backpack body armor is only $200
[59:23.500 --> 59:25.500]  I mean, it's unbelievable, it's a quarter inch thick
[59:25.500 --> 59:28.500]  It's got a 20 year warranty, it's waterproof, you can wear it, it's comfortable
[59:28.500 --> 59:30.500]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it
[59:30.500 --> 59:34.500]  Again, fund the info or kit the game changing in nanotech tubes
[59:34.500 --> 59:36.500]  It's a win-win, $200
[59:36.500 --> 59:38.500]  Go check out all their different products
[59:38.500 --> 1:00:07.500]  LiveForrestore.com, it's amazing
[1:00:08.500 --> 1:00:12.500]  You're listening to Alex Jones
[1:00:12.500 --> 1:00:18.500]  So, Alec Baldwin is a famous hypocrite, the famous punk
[1:00:18.500 --> 1:00:23.500]  Alec Baldwin is a famous bully that likes to start fights with little guys
[1:00:23.500 --> 1:00:27.500]  He's getting in trouble for it all the time, like beating up little paparazzi folks, you name it
[1:00:27.500 --> 1:00:28.500]  That don't fight back
[1:00:28.500 --> 1:00:32.500]  So, I tongue-in-cheek, you know, said, hey, million dollars is your favorite charity
[1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:35.500]  Whoever loses, bare knuckles, in a ring
[1:00:35.500 --> 1:00:38.500]  Then I realized he's older than me, so I said I'll fight you and Bill O'Reilly too
[1:00:38.500 --> 1:00:41.500]  Because Bill O'Reilly said, in our next piece on sexual predators
[1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:44.500]  Are they show a video of me screaming about something
[1:00:44.500 --> 1:00:47.500]  No one's ever called me a sexual predator
[1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:50.500]  I mean, if I called you that, oh, Riley, that's a big deal, man
[1:00:50.500 --> 1:00:54.500]  You're the one that's settling cases of that type of stuff
[1:00:54.500 --> 1:00:56.500]  So I said, it pisses me off, man
[1:00:56.500 --> 1:00:58.500]  Don't sit there and call me a sexual predator
[1:00:58.500 --> 1:01:00.500]  What the hell is your problem?
[1:01:00.500 --> 1:01:03.500]  And then he plays the part of the president
[1:01:03.500 --> 1:01:06.500]  Alec Baldwin does
[1:01:06.500 --> 1:01:08.500]  And then says
[1:01:08.500 --> 1:01:10.500]  The black people are aliens, they're not human
[1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:12.500]  Alex Jones, info wars told me
[1:01:12.500 --> 1:01:15.500]  And they cuss the black folks all angry, going, oh, we get it, you're racist
[1:01:15.500 --> 1:01:18.500]  Hey, man, I protest the KKK
[1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:21.500]  I don't like racist crap, you're the people pushing it
[1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:24.500]  How would Ron Perlman like it if people got on TV
[1:01:24.500 --> 1:01:27.500]  And said that he didn't like black people?
[1:01:27.500 --> 1:01:30.500]  Okay, but I know you're Hollywood, you're entitled
[1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:33.500]  You've got to do what the big Hollywood bosses do, pissing on America
[1:01:33.500 --> 1:01:35.500]  Promoting all the anti-America crap
[1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:37.500]  Or you won't get rolls, okay?
[1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:41.500]  Hey, Perlman, little newsflash, I don't want Hollywood rolls
[1:01:41.500 --> 1:01:43.500]  I've been chased around, people trying to give them to me
[1:01:43.500 --> 1:01:47.500]  I don't want to live in fantasy land, okay?
[1:01:47.500 --> 1:01:50.500]  Understand that?
[1:01:50.500 --> 1:01:53.500]  In fact, I guess come out and say I'm a sexual predator
[1:01:53.500 --> 1:01:55.500]  Or come out and say I hate black people
[1:01:55.500 --> 1:01:57.500]  And then I'll challenge you to your thing
[1:01:57.500 --> 1:01:59.500]  Don't think you're worth a million bucks, though
[1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:00.500]  Don't think it'd be big enough
[1:02:00.500 --> 1:02:03.500]  I look Baldwin to definitely be a million dollars in publicity
[1:02:03.500 --> 1:02:06.500]  And I would have to just work on my wrist, but I'm ready to go
[1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:08.500]  I'm ready to go
[1:02:08.500 --> 1:02:10.500]  And I know you got a big head, big jaw
[1:02:10.500 --> 1:02:13.500]  Old guy, except so you're tough, I tell you what
[1:02:13.500 --> 1:02:16.500]  You put up the million bucks, we'll do it
[1:02:16.500 --> 1:02:19.500]  And I guess if you like Baldwin, you like North Korea
[1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:21.500]  You like the Islamist and the sexual mutilation women
[1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:22.500]  I mean, I don't know
[1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:24.500]  You just say you support the Democratic Party
[1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:26.500]  You say you're into all this stuff
[1:02:26.500 --> 1:02:28.500]  And you're a tough guy in movies
[1:02:28.500 --> 1:02:31.500]  You know, runs around and does all this stuff
[1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:33.500]  Get it, get it, big movie
[1:02:33.500 --> 1:02:36.500]  See, we just put the president in against all your crap
[1:02:36.500 --> 1:02:39.500]  We're defeating globalism all over the world
[1:02:39.500 --> 1:02:42.500]  We're mobilizing the military and the veterans
[1:02:42.500 --> 1:02:45.500]  To defend the president
[1:02:45.500 --> 1:02:48.500]  With the major leaders
[1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:50.500]  And former leaders
[1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:52.500]  Of special forces groups
[1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:55.500]  You live in the world where you dress up like you're in the special forces
[1:02:55.500 --> 1:02:58.500]  And run around and battle demons
[1:02:58.500 --> 1:03:01.500]  Well, if you were really doing that, hellboy, Ron Perlman
[1:03:01.500 --> 1:03:05.500]  You would then go and you would be fighting Hillary Clinton
[1:03:05.500 --> 1:03:08.500]  Who funded Islamic State to run around and kill hundreds of thousands of others
[1:03:08.500 --> 1:03:10.500]  But I get it, you live in the fantasy land
[1:03:10.500 --> 1:03:14.500]  Where your buddy can get up and say a bunch of lies about Donald Trump and myself
[1:03:14.500 --> 1:03:17.500]  And treat us like we're non-humans
[1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:19.500]  That's what psychopaths and sociopaths do
[1:03:19.500 --> 1:03:21.500]  So let me act like I'm a police department
[1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:24.500]  And little Jenny's been kidnapped by Alec Baldwin
[1:03:24.500 --> 1:03:26.500]  He hasn't literally kidnapped a little girl named Jenny
[1:03:26.500 --> 1:03:27.500]  And doesn't have her in her basement
[1:03:27.500 --> 1:03:28.500]  But let's just hypothetically
[1:03:28.500 --> 1:03:31.500]  Little Jenny has a grandma that loves her and her parents
[1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:33.500]  And a puppy named Toby
[1:03:33.500 --> 1:03:35.500]  And she loves to play
[1:03:35.500 --> 1:03:38.500]  And she's scared at night if she is to get put to bed by her mom
[1:03:38.500 --> 1:03:40.500]  Tina
[1:03:40.500 --> 1:03:42.500]  And, you know, she really is a person
[1:03:42.500 --> 1:03:45.500]  And she's scared if she'd like to come home
[1:03:45.500 --> 1:03:48.500]  So listen, just just drop her off somewhere where she can get into a mall
[1:03:48.500 --> 1:03:49.500]  A store or wherever
[1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:52.500]  And then maybe you can just disappear and nothing's gonna happen
[1:03:52.500 --> 1:03:54.500]  But she's a human being
[1:03:54.500 --> 1:03:56.500]  And this isn't gonna go well
[1:03:56.500 --> 1:03:59.500]  I mean, what are you gonna do with her?
[1:03:59.500 --> 1:04:00.500]  See, it's the same thing
[1:04:00.500 --> 1:04:03.500]  You're on TV saying I hate black people
[1:04:03.500 --> 1:04:08.500]  And then my employees get thrown out of their apartments because of it
[1:04:08.500 --> 1:04:10.500]  Or when Colbert says I hate gay people
[1:04:10.500 --> 1:04:12.500]  See, we're real people, man
[1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:14.500]  You can't just go lie about us so you can win your little arguments
[1:04:14.500 --> 1:04:16.500]  Because you live in Hollywood and you read off scripts
[1:04:16.500 --> 1:04:19.500]  Understand, you're messing with real people
[1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:21.500]  Real people
[1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:24.500]  Not Snoop Dogg acting like he's into Crips and all this stuff
[1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:26.500]  Not all the punks
[1:04:26.500 --> 1:04:28.500]  Not all punk-ass Hollywood
[1:04:28.500 --> 1:04:30.500]  Financially falling in the ocean
[1:04:30.500 --> 1:04:32.500]  And about to fall in there seismically
[1:04:32.500 --> 1:04:35.500]  12 years overdue for a mega-quake
[1:04:35.500 --> 1:04:37.500]  So you just breathe your smog in Hollywood
[1:04:37.500 --> 1:04:40.500]  And walk around an act all narcissistic with all the other punks around you
[1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:42.500]  Or you could actually live in a real world
[1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:45.500]  And try to save the Republic and make it great again
[1:04:45.500 --> 1:04:49.500]  I'm told Michael Savage, the legend, is joining us straight ahead
[1:04:49.500 --> 1:04:51.500]  Stay with us
[1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:56.500]  Once again, the food of Americans, one of the most basic staples
[1:04:56.500 --> 1:04:58.500]  Chicken is under attack
[1:04:58.500 --> 1:05:05.500]  Alabama reports that they have found three cases of bird flu in your paltry
[1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:08.500]  Ashley Beckford here for infowars.com
[1:05:08.500 --> 1:05:13.500]  Alabama has found three paltry facilities in the northern part of the state
[1:05:13.500 --> 1:05:17.500]  Its agricultural department is claiming that this happened near
[1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:22.500]  Where two cases were detected recently in nearby Tennessee
[1:05:22.500 --> 1:05:25.500]  Alabama has not received any definitive test results
[1:05:25.500 --> 1:05:28.500]  That confirm its cases are highly pathogenic
[1:05:28.500 --> 1:05:31.500]  Which is the more lethal form of the virus
[1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:36.500]  According to a spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries
[1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:38.500]  Find out what's in your food
[1:05:38.500 --> 1:05:42.500]  Because your health is your most valuable resource
[1:05:42.500 --> 1:05:45.500]  If you want to stay in tune for more health news
[1:05:45.500 --> 1:05:48.500]  Go to our YouTube channel at youtube.com
[1:05:48.500 --> 1:05:53.500]  Today we call it bone broth
[1:05:53.500 --> 1:05:56.500]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[1:05:56.500 --> 1:05:59.500]  Before it became a loss to our modern diet of processed junk
[1:05:59.500 --> 1:06:03.500]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com
[1:06:03.500 --> 1:06:06.500]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth
[1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:07.500]  Turmeric root
[1:06:07.500 --> 1:06:08.500]  Chaga mushroom
[1:06:08.500 --> 1:06:10.500]  And seven total primal superfoods
[1:06:10.500 --> 1:06:12.500]  In a single great tasting formula
[1:06:12.500 --> 1:06:15.500]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds
[1:06:15.500 --> 1:06:18.500]  Having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors
[1:06:18.500 --> 1:06:21.500]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture them
[1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:24.500]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal
[1:06:24.500 --> 1:06:26.500]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking
[1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:29.500]  But you used the bones for strength
[1:06:29.500 --> 1:06:32.500]  From the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors
[1:06:32.500 --> 1:06:34.500]  To the marrow that produces the blood for the body
[1:06:34.500 --> 1:06:37.500]  This is the engine of the life essence
[1:06:37.500 --> 1:06:40.500]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were
[1:06:40.500 --> 1:06:42.500]  But I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence
[1:06:42.500 --> 1:06:44.500]  That made us what we were
[1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:45.500]  And this is a big part of it
[1:06:45.500 --> 1:06:47.500]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman
[1:06:47.500 --> 1:06:48.500]  Ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[1:06:48.500 --> 1:07:17.500]  And forewarslife.com today
[1:07:17.500 --> 1:07:20.500]  I've actually just run out of my superfemale
[1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:22.500]  I had a few bottles at my house
[1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:24.500]  And I've been taking it again
[1:07:24.500 --> 1:07:26.500]  Hitting the gym once again
[1:07:26.500 --> 1:07:28.500]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good
[1:07:28.500 --> 1:07:32.500]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again
[1:07:32.500 --> 1:07:35.500]  So obviously the superfemale is amazing, I love it
[1:07:35.500 --> 1:07:38.500]  Nascent iodine is essential
[1:07:38.500 --> 1:07:39.500]  Survival Shield X2
[1:07:39.500 --> 1:07:41.500]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing
[1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:43.500]  That I would suggest it's nascent iodine
[1:07:43.500 --> 1:07:45.500]  Survival Shield X2
[1:07:45.500 --> 1:07:47.500]  It's got a five star rating
[1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:48.500]  It's a win-win
[1:07:48.500 --> 1:07:50.500]  Infowarslife.com
[1:07:50.500 --> 1:08:18.500]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowar
[1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:22.500]  All right, for the next 30 minutes
[1:08:22.500 --> 1:08:24.500]  We're honored to have one of my favorite guests
[1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:25.500]  And one of your favorite guests I know
[1:08:25.500 --> 1:08:27.500]  Dr. Michael Savage
[1:08:27.500 --> 1:08:29.500]  He's the media icon in the conservative
[1:08:29.500 --> 1:08:30.500]  And Americana movement
[1:08:30.500 --> 1:08:32.500]  He holds a master's degree in medical botany
[1:08:32.500 --> 1:08:34.500]  In his second in medical anthropology
[1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:35.500]  Additionally, he earned his Ph.D.
[1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:36.500]  From University of California at Berkeley
[1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:38.500]  In epidemiology and nutrition sciences
[1:08:38.500 --> 1:08:40.500]  He is the author of 25 books
[1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:42.500]  Including four New York Times bestsellers
[1:08:42.500 --> 1:08:43.500]  I think it's more than that now
[1:08:43.500 --> 1:08:45.500]  He earned the coveted Freedom of Speech Award
[1:08:45.500 --> 1:08:47.500]  From Talkers Magazine 2007
[1:08:47.500 --> 1:08:49.500]  MichaelSavage.com
[1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:51.500]  MichaelSavage.WND.com
[1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:54.500]  And the reason we're all here with Trump in office
[1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:57.500]  Is our audience, Matt Drudge
[1:08:57.500 --> 1:09:00.500]  Michael Savage and Donald Trump
[1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:01.500]  Putting out the truth
[1:09:01.500 --> 1:09:02.500]  Breaking down the facts
[1:09:02.500 --> 1:09:04.500]  And you can see and everything Trump does
[1:09:04.500 --> 1:09:05.500]  And what Stephen Bannon does
[1:09:05.500 --> 1:09:07.500]  Michael Savage right there
[1:09:07.500 --> 1:09:09.500]  And it's not about giving him credit
[1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:10.500]  Because he doesn't care
[1:09:10.500 --> 1:09:12.500]  He doesn't need the money or the accolades
[1:09:12.500 --> 1:09:13.500]  It's about what's winning
[1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:14.500]  And what the truth is
[1:09:14.500 --> 1:09:16.500]  And our superior ideology
[1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:17.500]  When I say superior
[1:09:17.500 --> 1:09:19.500]  They want to ban the ideology of Americana
[1:09:19.500 --> 1:09:20.500]  And Renaissance
[1:09:20.500 --> 1:09:21.500]  Because compared to theirs
[1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:23.500]  I mean it's like North Korean ideology
[1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:25.500]  Banning whiteboards at universities all over
[1:09:25.500 --> 1:09:27.500]  Because someone might write something bad
[1:09:27.500 --> 1:09:29.500]  That's beyond burning books
[1:09:29.500 --> 1:09:31.500]  We're entering a new level
[1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:32.500]  All over the country
[1:09:32.500 --> 1:09:34.500]  Can't wear American flags in a basketball game
[1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:35.500]  It hurts the Muslims
[1:09:35.500 --> 1:09:36.500]  Well then they shouldn't be here
[1:09:36.500 --> 1:09:37.500]  They are hurt by a flag
[1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:38.500]  I thought you want to be Americans
[1:09:38.500 --> 1:09:40.500]  So joining us is Michael Savage
[1:09:40.500 --> 1:09:41.500]  I asked him, what do you want to talk about
[1:09:41.500 --> 1:09:42.500]  We talked 30 seconds before he came on
[1:09:42.500 --> 1:09:44.500]  He said, censorship
[1:09:44.500 --> 1:09:46.500]  And I was like, wow, that's the first thing
[1:09:46.500 --> 1:09:47.500]  I wanted to hit
[1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:49.500]  German official wants $53 million fine
[1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:52.500]  For fake news
[1:09:52.500 --> 1:09:53.500]  Or hate posts
[1:09:53.500 --> 1:09:54.500]  And that of course
[1:09:54.500 --> 1:09:55.500]  We're already getting banned in Europe
[1:09:55.500 --> 1:09:56.500]  Twitter, Facebook are blocking our posts
[1:09:56.500 --> 1:09:58.500]  Google kicked us off Google ads two weeks ago
[1:09:58.500 --> 1:10:00.500]  That was set to basically be the profit
[1:10:00.500 --> 1:10:01.500]  We would have this year
[1:10:01.500 --> 1:10:02.500]  To fund our operation
[1:10:02.500 --> 1:10:03.500]  We're under attack
[1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:05.500]  Savage is being blacklisted
[1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:07.500]  Dr. Michael Savage joins us
[1:10:07.500 --> 1:10:09.500]  Thank you so much for coming on
[1:10:09.500 --> 1:10:10.500]  With us, Dr.
[1:10:10.500 --> 1:10:11.500]  Kind of set the table there
[1:10:11.500 --> 1:10:12.500]  Where do you want to go first
[1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:13.500]  Who was the Nazi in Germany
[1:10:13.500 --> 1:10:15.500]  Who pretends to be a nice guy
[1:10:15.500 --> 1:10:17.500]  Who's the Nazi in Germany
[1:10:17.500 --> 1:10:19.500]  Who wants the $53 million fine
[1:10:19.500 --> 1:10:21.500]  For expressing a different opinion
[1:10:21.500 --> 1:10:22.500]  Who was this neo-nazi?
[1:10:22.500 --> 1:10:24.500]  That's one of the ministers
[1:10:24.500 --> 1:10:25.500]  And that's one of the leaders
[1:10:25.500 --> 1:10:26.500]  And one of the major political parties
[1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:28.500]  That's Justice Minister
[1:10:28.500 --> 1:10:30.500]  Jaco Mas
[1:10:30.500 --> 1:10:32.500]  And member of the center-left
[1:10:32.500 --> 1:10:33.500]  Social Democratic Party
[1:10:33.500 --> 1:10:35.500]  What do you mean center-left
[1:10:35.500 --> 1:10:36.500]  Social Democratic Party?
[1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:38.500]  The National Socialism
[1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:39.500]  Was a center-left
[1:10:39.500 --> 1:10:40.500]  Social Democratic Party
[1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:43.500]  That's right
[1:10:43.500 --> 1:10:45.500]  And we have the same thing in America now
[1:10:45.500 --> 1:10:47.500]  Called the Democrat Socialist
[1:10:47.500 --> 1:10:49.500]  Islamist Party of America
[1:10:49.500 --> 1:10:51.500]  Under the guise of fairness for all
[1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:53.500]  Look, it's a war
[1:10:53.500 --> 1:10:55.500]  It's a civil war, God darn it
[1:10:55.500 --> 1:10:56.500]  I'm sick of it
[1:10:56.500 --> 1:10:58.500]  I'm sick of them picking up sticks
[1:10:58.500 --> 1:10:59.500]  And beating up old women
[1:10:59.500 --> 1:11:01.500]  And calling it anti-fascism
[1:11:01.500 --> 1:11:03.500]  When are the Hell's Angels
[1:11:03.500 --> 1:11:05.500]  And the plumber's going to join the front lines
[1:11:05.500 --> 1:11:08.500]  And show those left-wing slime bags
[1:11:08.500 --> 1:11:11.500]  What fascism really looks like
[1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:13.500]  I agree, Snoop Dogg puts out a video
[1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:14.500]  Viacom promotes it
[1:11:14.500 --> 1:11:15.500]  Saying kill the president
[1:11:15.500 --> 1:11:16.500]  Kill police officers
[1:11:16.500 --> 1:11:17.500]  And at a certain point
[1:11:17.500 --> 1:11:18.500]  We're not looking for violence
[1:11:18.500 --> 1:11:21.500]  But they're organizing violence against America
[1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:22.500]  I mean, when are people going to start
[1:11:22.500 --> 1:11:23.500]  Falling down and hitting their heads
[1:11:23.500 --> 1:11:24.500]  So they learn
[1:11:24.500 --> 1:11:25.500]  They're pushing for revolution
[1:11:25.500 --> 1:11:26.500]  In a war
[1:11:26.500 --> 1:11:29.500]  They're going to get one
[1:11:29.500 --> 1:11:31.500]  Well, Alex, we're there already
[1:11:31.500 --> 1:11:32.500]  The war has started
[1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:33.500]  We're in the civil war
[1:11:33.500 --> 1:11:36.500]  There's no question about it
[1:11:36.500 --> 1:11:39.500]  Who's winning, though, is the question
[1:11:39.500 --> 1:11:40.500]  Who is really winning?
[1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:42.500]  We elected the president
[1:11:42.500 --> 1:11:44.500]  We allegedly own the Senate
[1:11:44.500 --> 1:11:45.500]  We have the House
[1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:47.500]  And we're getting nothing done
[1:11:47.500 --> 1:11:48.500]  No tax cuts
[1:11:48.500 --> 1:11:51.500]  Not a brick laid for the wall
[1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:52.500]  What's been done
[1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:55.500]  Because they're obstructionists, as you well know
[1:11:55.500 --> 1:11:57.500]  So I don't want to just keep going back
[1:11:57.500 --> 1:11:58.500]  To Trump's war, the book
[1:11:58.500 --> 1:11:59.500]  Trump's war, the book
[1:11:59.500 --> 1:12:00.500]  No, but that's it
[1:12:00.500 --> 1:12:01.500]  You said a month before the election
[1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:02.500]  The last time you were here
[1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:05.500]  If he wins, the real war starts
[1:12:05.500 --> 1:12:07.500]  Well, the real war has started
[1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:09.500]  But first we have to look at the enemies within
[1:12:09.500 --> 1:12:10.500]  The Paul Ryan's
[1:12:10.500 --> 1:12:13.500]  I will not defend Donald Trump no matter what
[1:12:13.500 --> 1:12:15.500]  Right?
[1:12:15.500 --> 1:12:16.500]  What more do we need to know
[1:12:16.500 --> 1:12:17.500]  Other than the enemy within
[1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:19.500]  Is the enemy within
[1:12:19.500 --> 1:12:20.500]  So what do we do about it?
[1:12:20.500 --> 1:12:22.500]  Well, for one, we stop playing nice
[1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:23.500]  With Paul Ryan
[1:12:23.500 --> 1:12:27.500]  And we stop playing nice with Mitch the Goblin McConnell
[1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:29.500]  We understand that the left wing
[1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:32.500]  Of the Republican Party has never gone away
[1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:34.500]  The left wing of the Republican Party, in fact
[1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:36.500]  Is impeding Donald Trump at every turn
[1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:38.500]  The left wing of the Republican Party
[1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:39.500]  Is the Democrat Party
[1:12:39.500 --> 1:12:41.500]  Is the Socialist Party, USA
[1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:42.500]  It's all one
[1:12:42.500 --> 1:12:44.500]  So long as they get what they want
[1:12:44.500 --> 1:12:46.500]  They don't care about social issues
[1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:48.500]  They don't care about cultural issues
[1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:51.500]  They don't care about borders, language, or culture
[1:12:51.500 --> 1:12:54.500]  All they care about is feathering their own nests
[1:12:54.500 --> 1:12:56.500]  And feathering the military-industrial complex
[1:12:56.500 --> 1:12:58.500]  With another endless war
[1:12:58.500 --> 1:13:00.500]  In fact, they're in competition, aren't they, Dr. Savage?
[1:13:00.500 --> 1:13:02.500]  With the nation-state, the family
[1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:05.500]  Because that creates success and independence
[1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:07.500]  They are actually at war with prosperity
[1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:08.500]  For the general public
[1:13:08.500 --> 1:13:11.500]  When I was 18, I read Karl Marx in its entirety
[1:13:11.500 --> 1:13:13.500]  In an English translation, of course
[1:13:13.500 --> 1:13:15.500]  And one of the things that struck me was
[1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:18.500]  One of his chief targets, Karl Marx
[1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:20.500]  One of his chief targets was the family
[1:13:20.500 --> 1:13:21.500]  He was the family
[1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:24.500]  He said the family is a bourgeois institution
[1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:26.500]  That stands in the way of progress
[1:13:26.500 --> 1:13:28.500]  And it must be eliminated at all costs
[1:13:28.500 --> 1:13:30.500]  Now, enter all the social policies
[1:13:30.500 --> 1:13:32.500]  In the last 30 or 40 years
[1:13:32.500 --> 1:13:34.500]  You'll see every last one of them
[1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:37.500]  Ames at mother and father and child
[1:13:37.500 --> 1:13:39.500]  Every policy of the left
[1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:42.500]  Is aimed at the middle class as we know it
[1:13:42.500 --> 1:13:44.500]  You'll notice that Hillary Clinton
[1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:46.500]  Started changing her picture in the last four months
[1:13:46.500 --> 1:13:47.500]  To middle class, middle class
[1:13:47.500 --> 1:13:49.500]  Remember, Bernie Sanders got the message
[1:13:49.500 --> 1:13:50.500]  Middle class, middle class
[1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:51.500]  But they were anti-middle class
[1:13:51.500 --> 1:13:52.500]  I was about to say, at first
[1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:54.500]  They didn't have any American flags at their convention
[1:13:54.500 --> 1:13:56.500]  And then they would never
[1:13:56.500 --> 1:13:58.500]  They took out in the Pledge of Allegiance
[1:13:58.500 --> 1:13:59.500]  One nation under God
[1:13:59.500 --> 1:14:01.500]  Now she's back saying, oh, God bless you
[1:14:01.500 --> 1:14:02.500]  And dress like a little old lady
[1:14:02.500 --> 1:14:05.500]  That's gonna cook cookies for you
[1:14:05.500 --> 1:14:07.500]  Yeah, it sounds like someone on the Trump team
[1:14:07.500 --> 1:14:08.500]  We won't talk about it
[1:14:08.500 --> 1:14:09.500]  We're as little doilies now
[1:14:09.500 --> 1:14:11.500]  After the spaying shot there
[1:14:11.500 --> 1:14:13.500]  In the Oval Office on the sofa
[1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:14.500]  With the legs behind it
[1:14:14.500 --> 1:14:15.500]  Well, let's put that aside
[1:14:15.500 --> 1:14:18.500]  Because that was just a comedic moment of insanity
[1:14:18.500 --> 1:14:20.500]  Let's talk about the healthcare thing
[1:14:20.500 --> 1:14:22.500]  Because the first thing Castro did
[1:14:22.500 --> 1:14:24.500]  After becoming a communist
[1:14:24.500 --> 1:14:25.500]  You remember when he took...
[1:14:25.500 --> 1:14:26.500]  People don't know this
[1:14:26.500 --> 1:14:28.500]  When he took power in Cuba
[1:14:28.500 --> 1:14:29.500]  He said he's not a communist
[1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:30.500]  He would not bring in communism
[1:14:30.500 --> 1:14:31.500]  People don't remember that
[1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:33.500]  I had a friend who actually went over to Cuba
[1:14:33.500 --> 1:14:35.500]  And got stuck there during the revolution
[1:14:35.500 --> 1:14:37.500]  Bruce, I'll never forget him
[1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:39.500]  But he said in the beginning it was wonderful
[1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:40.500]  It seemed like liberation
[1:14:40.500 --> 1:14:42.500]  Then he started killing his cohorts
[1:14:42.500 --> 1:14:44.500]  And then he announced he is a communist
[1:14:44.500 --> 1:14:47.500]  The next thing he did is he gave the Cuban peasants
[1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:49.500]  What? Healthcare
[1:14:49.500 --> 1:14:52.500]  But where does Castro go for his healthcare
[1:14:52.500 --> 1:14:54.500]  When he needed it while he was still living?
[1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:57.500]  He flew in a doctor from Miami
[1:14:57.500 --> 1:14:59.500]  He didn't use a Cuban doctor
[1:14:59.500 --> 1:15:01.500]  The Cuban doctors are for the peasants
[1:15:01.500 --> 1:15:02.500]  That's right, let's turn that around
[1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:03.500]  They had healthcare before
[1:15:03.500 --> 1:15:04.500]  He took their healthcare
[1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:06.500]  And made you get it from the state
[1:15:06.500 --> 1:15:07.500]  Thank you
[1:15:07.500 --> 1:15:08.500]  Now, let's...
[1:15:08.500 --> 1:15:10.500]  Let's look at our healthcare
[1:15:10.500 --> 1:15:13.500]  This stupid Obamacare now became Trumpcare
[1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:14.500]  They're not really repealing it
[1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:16.500]  Savage came up with a solution
[1:15:16.500 --> 1:15:17.500]  Which is in Trump's war
[1:15:17.500 --> 1:15:19.500]  And I discussed it on my radio show yesterday
[1:15:19.500 --> 1:15:21.500]  Everybody should get the book
[1:15:21.500 --> 1:15:22.500]  Alex, listen
[1:15:22.500 --> 1:15:23.500]  This is so commonsensical
[1:15:23.500 --> 1:15:24.500]  No one's picked up on it
[1:15:24.500 --> 1:15:26.500]  It makes so much sense
[1:15:26.500 --> 1:15:28.500]  That people are ignoring it
[1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:30.500]  Savage says put high-risk individuals
[1:15:30.500 --> 1:15:32.500]  In high-risk insurance pools
[1:15:32.500 --> 1:15:33.500]  That's what my dad says
[1:15:33.500 --> 1:15:36.500]  And he ran medical companies for decades
[1:15:36.500 --> 1:15:38.500]  If you're a driver
[1:15:38.500 --> 1:15:40.500]  You pay higher rates if you had accidents
[1:15:40.500 --> 1:15:43.500]  If you go for any kind of...
[1:15:43.500 --> 1:15:44.500]  If you're an astronaut
[1:15:44.500 --> 1:15:46.500]  If you're a deep water welder
[1:15:46.500 --> 1:15:48.500]  You pay because you're in a high-risk pool
[1:15:48.500 --> 1:15:49.500]  That's what I'm saying
[1:15:49.500 --> 1:15:51.500]  So why shouldn't it apply to Trumpcare?
[1:15:51.500 --> 1:15:53.500]  High-risk individuals
[1:15:53.500 --> 1:15:55.500]  High-risk pools
[1:15:55.500 --> 1:15:57.500]  You have multiple sex partners every week
[1:15:57.500 --> 1:15:59.500]  You go in a high-risk pool
[1:15:59.500 --> 1:16:01.500]  You shouldn't pay the same as a grandmother
[1:16:01.500 --> 1:16:02.500]  You smoke three packs of cigarettes a day
[1:16:02.500 --> 1:16:03.500]  You go in a high-risk pool
[1:16:03.500 --> 1:16:04.500]  Crazy
[1:16:04.500 --> 1:16:06.500]  Why is this not being picked up?
[1:16:06.500 --> 1:16:07.500]  I hope after your show
[1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:09.500]  The headline in Savage says
[1:16:09.500 --> 1:16:11.500]  High-risk pools for high-risk individuals
[1:16:11.500 --> 1:16:12.500]  To save Trumpcare
[1:16:12.500 --> 1:16:13.500]  We will
[1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:15.500]  I've sent it, by the way
[1:16:15.500 --> 1:16:17.500]  I've sent it to Donald Trump
[1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:19.500]  Via some internal, you know...
[1:16:19.500 --> 1:16:21.500]  By the way, I know he loves you
[1:16:21.500 --> 1:16:22.500]  I've talked to him all the time
[1:16:22.500 --> 1:16:23.500]  I've talked to him some
[1:16:23.500 --> 1:16:24.500]  He loves Michael Savage
[1:16:24.500 --> 1:16:25.500]  He listens to your show
[1:16:25.500 --> 1:16:27.500]  So obviously it makes sense
[1:16:27.500 --> 1:16:29.500]  This is a much better plan
[1:16:29.500 --> 1:16:30.500]  Rand Paul has a good plan
[1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:31.500]  That talks about things you're saying
[1:16:31.500 --> 1:16:35.500]  Why is he then going with this Paul Ryan thing?
[1:16:35.500 --> 1:16:38.500]  Because politics is a compromise
[1:16:38.500 --> 1:16:40.500]  He knows he has to get things done
[1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:41.500]  The question is
[1:16:41.500 --> 1:16:43.500]  This is too big an issue to compromise on
[1:16:43.500 --> 1:16:45.500]  And it was the signature...
[1:16:45.500 --> 1:16:47.500]  One of the signature pieces of the campaign was
[1:16:47.500 --> 1:16:49.500]  We're going to repeal Obamacare, right?
[1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:52.500]  Well, okay, so the people are very unhappy
[1:16:52.500 --> 1:16:54.500]  And we need to gut the whole thing
[1:16:54.500 --> 1:16:55.500]  And start all over again
[1:16:55.500 --> 1:16:57.500]  I am sick and tired of people
[1:16:57.500 --> 1:16:59.500]  Who lead healthy lifestyles
[1:16:59.500 --> 1:17:02.500]  Clean lifestyles, if you want to put it that way
[1:17:02.500 --> 1:17:04.500]  Paying the same as illegal immigrants
[1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:06.500]  Who, by the way, should have no healthcare
[1:17:06.500 --> 1:17:08.500]  My dad and mom hadn't used their insurance
[1:17:08.500 --> 1:17:09.500]  In over 20 years
[1:17:09.500 --> 1:17:11.500]  And as soon as this came in
[1:17:11.500 --> 1:17:12.500]  They doubled their prices
[1:17:12.500 --> 1:17:16.500]  And so my parents are paying higher prices
[1:17:16.500 --> 1:17:18.500]  And then people that have been milking the system
[1:17:18.500 --> 1:17:19.500]  They're paying lower
[1:17:19.500 --> 1:17:21.500]  It's incredible
[1:17:21.500 --> 1:17:23.500]  Well, isn't that socialism?
[1:17:23.500 --> 1:17:24.500]  Some animals are more equal than others
[1:17:24.500 --> 1:17:26.500]  Isn't that what Orwell told us about?
[1:17:26.500 --> 1:17:28.500]  Some animals are more equal than others, Alex
[1:17:28.500 --> 1:17:30.500]  We're not equal to the liberals
[1:17:30.500 --> 1:17:34.500]  It's four legs good, two legs bad
[1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:36.500]  We walk on two legs
[1:17:36.500 --> 1:17:37.500]  They walk on four
[1:17:37.500 --> 1:17:38.500]  And they're superior to us
[1:17:38.500 --> 1:17:40.500]  Because they have four legs, Alex
[1:17:40.500 --> 1:17:41.500]  George Orwell wrote it
[1:17:41.500 --> 1:17:43.500]  I loved Orwell because he was a socialist
[1:17:43.500 --> 1:17:45.500]  In the 30s when it was very popular
[1:17:45.500 --> 1:17:47.500]  Until he found out what socialists
[1:17:47.500 --> 1:17:49.500]  Were actually doing to their people
[1:17:49.500 --> 1:17:51.500]  He saw Hitler, he saw Stalin
[1:17:51.500 --> 1:17:52.500]  He saw the totalitarianism
[1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:53.500]  No, as you know, he fought
[1:17:53.500 --> 1:17:55.500]  He wrote a bunch of non-fiction books
[1:17:55.500 --> 1:17:57.500]  He fought in the Spanish Civil War
[1:17:57.500 --> 1:17:58.500]  Against the Nazis
[1:17:58.500 --> 1:18:00.500]  And then found out the communists were just as bad
[1:18:00.500 --> 1:18:02.500]  And were planning to actually just enslave
[1:18:02.500 --> 1:18:04.500]  So that's why in his allegory, the pigs
[1:18:04.500 --> 1:18:05.500]  At first they two legs bad
[1:18:05.500 --> 1:18:07.500]  But as soon as they run the humans off
[1:18:07.500 --> 1:18:09.500]  They start walking on their two legs as well
[1:18:09.500 --> 1:18:11.500]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss
[1:18:11.500 --> 1:18:15.500]  What I loved about a very obscure statement
[1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:17.500]  Of Orwell was
[1:18:17.500 --> 1:18:19.500]  If a man comes to plant the bomb in your mother's house
[1:18:19.500 --> 1:18:22.500]  Plant one in his mother's house first
[1:18:22.500 --> 1:18:24.500]  So I 100% support Donald Trump firing
[1:18:24.500 --> 1:18:26.500]  Drones at these throwbacks
[1:18:26.500 --> 1:18:28.500]  Good idea
[1:18:28.500 --> 1:18:32.500]  I'm so tired of hearing about collateral damage
[1:18:32.500 --> 1:18:34.500]  How about the collateral damage here in America
[1:18:34.500 --> 1:18:36.500]  From political correctness
[1:18:36.500 --> 1:18:39.500]  We've had one piece of collateral damage after another
[1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:42.500]  Do I have to go back to the incident in Orlando
[1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:43.500]  Where all the gays were slaughtered?
[1:18:43.500 --> 1:18:46.500]  We've forgotten that because it's an inconvenient truth
[1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:49.500]  San Bernardino, the two Muslims killed their coworkers
[1:18:49.500 --> 1:18:52.500]  Inconvenient truth, the collateral damage
[1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:54.500]  There's only one way to win a war, Alex
[1:18:54.500 --> 1:18:55.500]  It's horrible
[1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:57.500]  It's terrible, war is horrible
[1:18:57.500 --> 1:18:59.500]  It's called kill them
[1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:02.500]  They're never going to see it your way
[1:19:02.500 --> 1:19:05.500]  And the collateral damage, unfortunately
[1:19:05.500 --> 1:19:07.500]  Is part of warfare
[1:19:07.500 --> 1:19:09.500]  Well, let's expand on that
[1:19:09.500 --> 1:19:11.500]  Obama and Hillary backed ISIS
[1:19:11.500 --> 1:19:13.500]  Backed these invasions, Trump's cleaning them out
[1:19:13.500 --> 1:19:16.500]  And in these towns where the people are supposed to be refugees
[1:19:16.500 --> 1:19:18.500]  And come out and get checked if they're not terrorists
[1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:20.500]  If they're all staying there in the towns
[1:19:20.500 --> 1:19:22.500]  Then they're open in war to be bombarded
[1:19:22.500 --> 1:19:24.500]  That's the way it works
[1:19:24.500 --> 1:19:27.500]  Yeah, well, we can't talk about their women and children
[1:19:27.500 --> 1:19:28.500]  Without sounding like we're mean
[1:19:28.500 --> 1:19:30.500]  Unfortunately, they don't care too much about our women and children
[1:19:30.500 --> 1:19:32.500]  You mean the suicide bomber kids
[1:19:32.500 --> 1:19:35.500]  No, ISIS doesn't care much about women and children
[1:19:35.500 --> 1:19:38.500]  Exactly, they're not fanatical Muslims
[1:19:38.500 --> 1:19:41.500]  They kill moderate Muslims, women and children
[1:19:41.500 --> 1:19:44.500]  They turn Yazidi girls eight years old into sex slaves
[1:19:44.500 --> 1:19:47.500]  I didn't hear Hillary, the great women's supporter
[1:19:47.500 --> 1:19:50.500]  Say one word while the girls were crying out for help
[1:19:50.500 --> 1:19:54.500]  Not one word from that lying witch
[1:19:54.500 --> 1:19:56.500]  So I don't want to get distracted
[1:19:56.500 --> 1:19:58.500]  No, I agree, let's talk about Trump's war
[1:19:58.500 --> 1:20:00.500]  What he's got ahead of him, what he needs to do
[1:20:00.500 --> 1:20:02.500]  Because clearly, we're here
[1:20:02.500 --> 1:20:04.500]  Nationalism's exploding worldwide
[1:20:04.500 --> 1:20:06.500]  The journalists, the control freaks are desperate
[1:20:06.500 --> 1:20:08.500]  How are they going to counter strike?
[1:20:08.500 --> 1:20:09.500]  What do we do?
[1:20:09.500 --> 1:20:11.500]  I know the book breaks it down
[1:20:11.500 --> 1:20:13.500]  The blueprint, Trump's war, his battle for America
[1:20:13.500 --> 1:20:14.500]  Undoubtedly, this is it
[1:20:14.500 --> 1:20:16.500]  He's trying to turn the economy back on
[1:20:16.500 --> 1:20:18.500]  He's very fatalistic, he's on a mission
[1:20:18.500 --> 1:20:20.500]  He's a great guy, he's not perfect, none of us are
[1:20:20.500 --> 1:20:22.500]  But Trump clearly is for real
[1:20:22.500 --> 1:20:24.500]  And we're moving forward, what do we do?
[1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:25.500]  Dr. Savage
[1:20:25.500 --> 1:20:27.500]  Well, let's take it issue by issue
[1:20:27.500 --> 1:20:30.500]  Right now, the issue in the news is what?
[1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:32.500]  It's healthcare
[1:20:32.500 --> 1:20:34.500]  Okay, big issue
[1:20:34.500 --> 1:20:36.500]  And he's suddenly, almost, the ship has come to a stall
[1:20:36.500 --> 1:20:38.500]  The engines have stopped
[1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:40.500]  People don't know what to do
[1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:42.500]  The costs are through the ceiling
[1:20:42.500 --> 1:20:45.500]  Let's come up with a common sensical beginning
[1:20:45.500 --> 1:20:47.500]  Donald Trump gives a speech tomorrow
[1:20:47.500 --> 1:20:50.500]  Which says, I have a partial solution to the impasse
[1:20:50.500 --> 1:20:53.500]  It's not perfect, but it's going to help us save
[1:20:53.500 --> 1:20:55.500]  Billions of dollars in the short run
[1:20:55.500 --> 1:20:57.500]  And trillions in the long run
[1:20:57.500 --> 1:21:00.500]  Fingo! When I was 18 years old
[1:21:00.500 --> 1:21:02.500]  Got a driver's license
[1:21:02.500 --> 1:21:04.500]  Went to get insurance
[1:21:04.500 --> 1:21:05.500]  Had a part-time job
[1:21:05.500 --> 1:21:07.500]  They told me my insurance cost more than my dad
[1:21:07.500 --> 1:21:09.500]  I went to my dad, I said, dad
[1:21:09.500 --> 1:21:11.500]  Why do I have to pay more insurance than you?
[1:21:11.500 --> 1:21:12.500]  I'm a kid, I don't have the money
[1:21:12.500 --> 1:21:14.500]  He said, because kids your age get into more accidents
[1:21:14.500 --> 1:21:15.500]  Sorry
[1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:17.500]  Well, guess what? I found the money
[1:21:17.500 --> 1:21:19.500]  I took a second day after school job
[1:21:19.500 --> 1:21:21.500]  I paid my auto insurance until I proved that I was a
[1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:24.500]  An individual no longer should be in the high-risk pool
[1:21:24.500 --> 1:21:26.500]  That I think it was two years later
[1:21:26.500 --> 1:21:29.500]  That I was made into an adult, you know, at a regular rate
[1:21:29.500 --> 1:21:31.500]  I remember being like 22 years old
[1:21:31.500 --> 1:21:33.500]  And all of a sudden my insurance went down by like half
[1:21:33.500 --> 1:21:35.500]  And again, this is what it's all about behavior
[1:21:35.500 --> 1:21:37.500]  It's all about what you've done
[1:21:37.500 --> 1:21:38.500]  It's all about free market
[1:21:38.500 --> 1:21:40.500]  It's not about just giving everything away free
[1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:42.500]  And then wondering why the economy blows up
[1:21:42.500 --> 1:21:44.500]  All we have to do is look at South America
[1:21:44.500 --> 1:21:47.500]  How did socialism work out down there?
[1:21:47.500 --> 1:21:50.500]  In a near-neighbor that used to be a thriving nation
[1:21:50.500 --> 1:21:51.500]  With a great middle class
[1:21:51.500 --> 1:21:53.500]  Does anyone remember the name of the country
[1:21:53.500 --> 1:21:54.500]  Called Venezuela?
[1:21:54.500 --> 1:21:56.500]  Has it been dropped from the lexicon of the left
[1:21:56.500 --> 1:21:58.500]  Because it's a disaster?
[1:21:58.500 --> 1:22:01.500]  It's a disastrous example of what socialism actually brings
[1:22:01.500 --> 1:22:03.500]  As opposed to what the textbooks tell you it brings
[1:22:03.500 --> 1:22:07.500]  And by the way, they're now in a road-warrior level collapse
[1:22:07.500 --> 1:22:08.500]  And notice you hear nothing about it
[1:22:08.500 --> 1:22:10.500]  They've eaten all the farm animals
[1:22:10.500 --> 1:22:11.500]  They've eaten all their pets
[1:22:11.500 --> 1:22:14.500]  Literally, they're now eating people down there, reportedly
[1:22:14.500 --> 1:22:17.500]  Can you imagine they're killing animals in the zoo?
[1:22:17.500 --> 1:22:18.500]  Because there's no food
[1:22:18.500 --> 1:22:21.500]  That's socialism in action
[1:22:21.500 --> 1:22:25.500]  Forget what Robert Reich, the midget from Berkeley, says
[1:22:25.500 --> 1:22:28.500]  Or what the seltzer man from Brooklyn, Bernie Sanders says
[1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:31.500]  These are hardcore fanatical midgets
[1:22:31.500 --> 1:22:35.500]  The reality is seen in that nation
[1:22:35.500 --> 1:22:37.500]  Where they're starving to death
[1:22:37.500 --> 1:22:38.500]  That's socialism
[1:22:38.500 --> 1:22:41.500]  The idiots out there who don't know this know nothing
[1:22:41.500 --> 1:22:44.500]  They're the useful idiots of our time
[1:22:44.500 --> 1:22:45.500]  I totally agree
[1:22:45.500 --> 1:22:49.500]  So why are the elites, except for Donald Trump, pushing socialism?
[1:22:49.500 --> 1:22:52.500]  Why? Take a look at the mobs you just showed on your own screen
[1:22:52.500 --> 1:22:53.500]  They're scared
[1:22:53.500 --> 1:22:54.500]  They're vulnerable
[1:22:54.500 --> 1:22:55.500]  They're desperate
[1:22:55.500 --> 1:22:57.500]  Who do they turn to?
[1:22:57.500 --> 1:22:58.500]  Who do they turn to?
[1:22:58.500 --> 1:22:59.500]  The corrupt slaves
[1:22:59.500 --> 1:23:01.500]  The corrupt bums in Congress
[1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:03.500]  Will throw them a piece of bread
[1:23:03.500 --> 1:23:07.500]  When you have a starving population, they're a malleable population
[1:23:07.500 --> 1:23:08.500]  They'll do anything you want
[1:23:08.500 --> 1:23:09.500]  Isn't that true?
[1:23:09.500 --> 1:23:10.500]  Yes, sir
[1:23:10.500 --> 1:23:11.500]  All right, well, there you go
[1:23:11.500 --> 1:23:14.500]  They're starving them into submission
[1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:16.500]  And it makes you upset to see people being enslaved
[1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:17.500]  I'm the same way
[1:23:17.500 --> 1:23:19.500]  And then I get around left as they just
[1:23:19.500 --> 1:23:21.500]  They actually, a lot of them know what they're doing now
[1:23:21.500 --> 1:23:22.500]  Even low-level ones
[1:23:22.500 --> 1:23:23.500]  Even though they're not getting power from it
[1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:27.500]  They get off on burning down the country, burning down the culture
[1:23:27.500 --> 1:23:29.500]  They're actually just envious of success
[1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:31.500]  Envious of honorableness
[1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:35.500]  And a lot of these people are actually a cult of...
[1:23:35.500 --> 1:23:36.500]  You studied this
[1:23:36.500 --> 1:23:38.500]  You were the first to call it a mental illness
[1:23:38.500 --> 1:23:40.500]  It is a mental illness, but it's also a cult
[1:23:40.500 --> 1:23:42.500]  It's a nihilistic cult
[1:23:42.500 --> 1:23:45.500]  It's a cult of nihilism
[1:23:45.500 --> 1:23:47.500]  Which is of destruction
[1:23:47.500 --> 1:23:48.500]  You could call it Satanism
[1:23:48.500 --> 1:23:51.500]  If you want to put it into the religious context
[1:23:51.500 --> 1:23:55.500]  It's a worship of evil and darkness
[1:23:55.500 --> 1:23:57.500]  It's the dark side
[1:23:57.500 --> 1:23:59.500]  So it is a battle, Alex, in a metaphorical sense
[1:23:59.500 --> 1:24:02.500]  Between lightness and darkness
[1:24:02.500 --> 1:24:03.500]  Not racial
[1:24:03.500 --> 1:24:04.500]  I know everything is seen in race
[1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:05.500]  No, it's not racial
[1:24:05.500 --> 1:24:07.500]  It's a spiritual statement
[1:24:07.500 --> 1:24:10.500]  The light and the darkness
[1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:12.500]  And this transcends race
[1:24:12.500 --> 1:24:13.500]  It transcends age
[1:24:13.500 --> 1:24:15.500]  It transcends everything
[1:24:15.500 --> 1:24:18.500]  We in the light have a huge job ahead of us
[1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:21.500]  Which is how to lead without getting crazy
[1:24:21.500 --> 1:24:23.500]  How to lead without getting violent
[1:24:23.500 --> 1:24:26.500]  It may be a task that is too great for us, Alex
[1:24:26.500 --> 1:24:28.500]  We may be driven to violence
[1:24:28.500 --> 1:24:31.500]  We may have to defend ourselves
[1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:34.500]  We may have to stand up to these throwback left-wing vermin
[1:24:34.500 --> 1:24:37.500]  And get in their faces and not let them do this
[1:24:37.500 --> 1:24:39.500]  To the grandmothers who support Trump
[1:24:39.500 --> 1:24:41.500]  These sick people on the left
[1:24:41.500 --> 1:24:45.500]  These are the mentally sick degenerates of our society
[1:24:45.500 --> 1:24:49.500]  But they are psychologically violent
[1:24:49.500 --> 1:24:51.500]  And there's only one way to deal with them
[1:24:51.500 --> 1:24:54.500]  You could try love, but I'm not Jesus
[1:24:54.500 --> 1:24:55.500]  How'd that work out for Jesus?
[1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:57.500]  How'd love work out for Jesus?
[1:24:57.500 --> 1:24:58.500]  I don't know about you, Alex
[1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:01.500]  I really don't want to wind up on a cross with spikes in my hand
[1:25:01.500 --> 1:25:02.500]  Okay?
[1:25:02.500 --> 1:25:03.500]  I know this
[1:25:03.500 --> 1:25:06.500]  I mean, they're on the news saying, kill me, kill you, kill Trump
[1:25:06.500 --> 1:25:10.500]  I mean, we're in the weird fraternity of being the few guys that you actually get attacked like he does
[1:25:10.500 --> 1:25:11.500]  But obviously Lester
[1:25:11.500 --> 1:25:16.500]  Saturday Night Live comes out and says, you're posing Saturday as the president
[1:25:16.500 --> 1:25:20.500]  And Alec Baldwin says, black people aren't humans
[1:25:20.500 --> 1:25:24.500]  Alex Jones at Info Wars told me, and it cuts to black people mad
[1:25:24.500 --> 1:25:28.500]  And then I actually then see post people believe now that I said that
[1:25:28.500 --> 1:25:30.500]  And it's like, and then I told Alec Baldwin
[1:25:30.500 --> 1:25:31.500]  I want to get in a ring with him
[1:25:31.500 --> 1:25:34.500]  And then the media says, oh, I'm threatening Alec Baldwin for no reason
[1:25:34.500 --> 1:25:39.500]  And won't even say my full quote because he said that I hate black people
[1:25:39.500 --> 1:25:41.500]  I mean, they're sick liars
[1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:43.500]  Alec Baldwin is a failed actor
[1:25:43.500 --> 1:25:45.500]  He has not been in a hit in how many years
[1:25:45.500 --> 1:25:47.500]  So he's reverting to what?
[1:25:47.500 --> 1:25:49.500]  A crappy little television show
[1:25:49.500 --> 1:25:52.500]  Saturday Night Dead
[1:25:52.500 --> 1:25:55.500]  And his big calling card is smearing people like you
[1:25:55.500 --> 1:25:57.500]  He's nobody
[1:25:57.500 --> 1:25:59.500]  He's a nothing
[1:25:59.500 --> 1:26:01.500]  He hates people
[1:26:01.500 --> 1:26:03.500]  All he's got is hate to sell
[1:26:03.500 --> 1:26:04.500]  He's a loser
[1:26:04.500 --> 1:26:06.500]  I don't think you should lock on to what he said about you
[1:26:06.500 --> 1:26:09.500]  But I love you challenging him to get into a ring with you, I love that
[1:26:09.500 --> 1:26:11.500]  I think you'd flatten him with one blow
[1:26:11.500 --> 1:26:13.500]  Well, I mean, I'm not the toughest guy around
[1:26:13.500 --> 1:26:14.500]  I've been beat up quite a bit
[1:26:14.500 --> 1:26:17.500]  But I guarantee I'd win against that punk
[1:26:17.500 --> 1:26:19.500]  Michael Savage, Trump's War, his Battle of America
[1:26:19.500 --> 1:26:21.500]  You're a hard guy to get on
[1:26:21.500 --> 1:26:23.500]  Knock him out for Mike
[1:26:23.500 --> 1:26:24.500]  I'll do it, believe me
[1:26:24.500 --> 1:26:26.500]  Trump's War, his Battle for America
[1:26:26.500 --> 1:26:27.500]  The number one New York Times best-selling author
[1:26:27.500 --> 1:26:28.500]  Tell us about the book seven
[1:26:28.500 --> 1:26:30.500]  I know you're a hard guy to get on
[1:26:30.500 --> 1:26:32.500]  I really hope you'll come on more
[1:26:32.500 --> 1:26:34.500]  And sometime really get into your whole philosophy
[1:26:34.500 --> 1:26:36.500]  And where everything's going
[1:26:36.500 --> 1:26:38.500]  Because I used to hear you 15 years ago on the air
[1:26:38.500 --> 1:26:39.500]  And agree with like 80%
[1:26:39.500 --> 1:26:42.500]  Now you're like 95% or 98%
[1:26:42.500 --> 1:26:44.500]  It's just crazy how you weren't about the left
[1:26:44.500 --> 1:26:46.500]  And Islam merging
[1:26:46.500 --> 1:26:47.500]  And I thought they'd never do that
[1:26:47.500 --> 1:26:48.500]  But they've done it
[1:26:48.500 --> 1:26:50.500]  And they're just opening Europe and all of it
[1:26:50.500 --> 1:26:52.500]  It's just crazy
[1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:54.500]  I said that the progressives
[1:26:54.500 --> 1:26:56.500]  Would align with the Islamists
[1:26:56.500 --> 1:26:58.500]  To destroy the West
[1:26:58.500 --> 1:27:01.500]  And of course that's what's happening
[1:27:01.500 --> 1:27:03.500]  And the Democrat Socialist Islamist Party
[1:27:03.500 --> 1:27:05.500]  Is what they have become
[1:27:05.500 --> 1:27:07.500]  How can you explain people of Jewish heritage
[1:27:07.500 --> 1:27:09.500]  In the Democrat Party
[1:27:09.500 --> 1:27:11.500]  So enamored of Islam
[1:27:11.500 --> 1:27:12.500]  Can you explain that to me?
[1:27:12.500 --> 1:27:14.500]  Why is Schumer so obsessed
[1:27:14.500 --> 1:27:16.500]  With making certain that more Islamists
[1:27:16.500 --> 1:27:18.500]  I think it's flirting with suicide
[1:27:18.500 --> 1:27:19.500]  I think it's nihilistic
[1:27:19.500 --> 1:27:21.500]  What you said, it's cuckolding
[1:27:21.500 --> 1:27:23.500]  Well, liberalism is a mental disorder
[1:27:23.500 --> 1:27:24.500]  That we understand
[1:27:24.500 --> 1:27:26.500]  But there's something else to this picture
[1:27:26.500 --> 1:27:28.500]  I don't know that it's purely suicidal
[1:27:28.500 --> 1:27:30.500]  It may be something else
[1:27:30.500 --> 1:27:32.500]  Voting, voting blocks
[1:27:32.500 --> 1:27:33.500]  You know, in Sanford District
[1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:34.500]  Oh sure, they want Balkanization
[1:27:34.500 --> 1:27:36.500]  But Islam isn't going to do that
[1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:38.500]  Look out, Irgun's trying to threaten all of Europe
[1:27:38.500 --> 1:27:40.500]  To let him set up political movements inside
[1:27:40.500 --> 1:27:42.500]  And now threatening more refugees
[1:27:42.500 --> 1:27:45.500]  I mean, he's just the arrogance of these people
[1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:47.500]  It's a war, Alex
[1:27:47.500 --> 1:27:49.500]  And we're losing it
[1:27:49.500 --> 1:27:51.500]  Unfortunately, the West is losing
[1:27:51.500 --> 1:27:53.500]  Trump is our only hope right now
[1:27:53.500 --> 1:27:55.500]  And I'm not sure he's going to win
[1:27:55.500 --> 1:27:57.500]  Without a popular movement to support him
[1:27:57.500 --> 1:27:59.500]  And here's what I want to say
[1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:01.500]  To all those people who stabbed him
[1:28:01.500 --> 1:28:03.500]  For months during the campaign
[1:28:03.500 --> 1:28:05.500]  Then suddenly became his supporters
[1:28:05.500 --> 1:28:06.500]  After he won
[1:28:06.500 --> 1:28:08.500]  There were suddenly big Trump supporters
[1:28:08.500 --> 1:28:09.500]  Two minutes later now
[1:28:09.500 --> 1:28:11.500]  They're stabbing him in the back again
[1:28:11.500 --> 1:28:13.500]  Okay, it is either your former
[1:28:13.500 --> 1:28:14.500]  Or your against them
[1:28:14.500 --> 1:28:15.500]  How's that?
[1:28:15.500 --> 1:28:16.500]  And let me explain why
[1:28:16.500 --> 1:28:18.500]  Even if we only get 10 or 20%
[1:28:18.500 --> 1:28:19.500]  Of what he promised
[1:28:19.500 --> 1:28:21.500]  That's 10 or 20% more than
[1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:23.500]  110 or 120% more
[1:28:23.500 --> 1:28:25.500]  Than we would have had with the she-witch
[1:28:25.500 --> 1:28:26.500]  Had she had won
[1:28:26.500 --> 1:28:28.500]  First amendment
[1:28:28.500 --> 1:28:30.500]  He's not taking away freedom of speech
[1:28:30.500 --> 1:28:31.500]  He's not taking away talk radio
[1:28:31.500 --> 1:28:33.500]  She said she would do the fairness doctrine
[1:28:33.500 --> 1:28:35.500]  And eliminate me on the radio
[1:28:35.500 --> 1:28:37.500]  And others in the media like you
[1:28:37.500 --> 1:28:38.500]  You'd be gone
[1:28:38.500 --> 1:28:39.500]  The end of that would be gone
[1:28:39.500 --> 1:28:40.500]  They said that was the goal
[1:28:40.500 --> 1:28:42.500]  Okay, so we have the first amendment on the Trump
[1:28:42.500 --> 1:28:43.500]  Guns are not being seized
[1:28:43.500 --> 1:28:45.500]  They would have been seized on the Hillary
[1:28:45.500 --> 1:28:46.500]  One way or another
[1:28:46.500 --> 1:28:47.500]  The border is 44% down
[1:28:47.500 --> 1:28:49.500]  Just in 50 days the illegals
[1:28:49.500 --> 1:28:52.500]  Well, what I'm saying is
[1:28:52.500 --> 1:28:55.500]  We have the first and second amendments
[1:28:55.500 --> 1:28:58.500]  Why are these people stabbing Trump in the back?
[1:28:58.500 --> 1:28:59.500]  I'm not talking about the progressives
[1:28:59.500 --> 1:29:00.500]  No, his own people
[1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:01.500]  We know
[1:29:01.500 --> 1:29:02.500]  The Republicans
[1:29:02.500 --> 1:29:03.500]  I'm talking about the fake conservatives
[1:29:03.500 --> 1:29:04.500]  In the media, Alex
[1:29:04.500 --> 1:29:06.500]  Oh, you watch Fox News
[1:29:06.500 --> 1:29:07.500]  It's all backhanded attacks
[1:29:07.500 --> 1:29:08.500]  We should all turn against them
[1:29:08.500 --> 1:29:09.500]  And not support them
[1:29:09.500 --> 1:29:11.500]  And not watch their crap
[1:29:11.500 --> 1:29:13.500]  Have you ever been on Fox News?
[1:29:13.500 --> 1:29:14.500]  Years ago
[1:29:14.500 --> 1:29:15.500]  They told me I was in band off of it
[1:29:15.500 --> 1:29:16.500]  But they don't have any that many viewers
[1:29:16.500 --> 1:29:18.500]  It's not that big a response
[1:29:18.500 --> 1:29:20.500]  You may have a bigger audience
[1:29:20.500 --> 1:29:21.500]  In your time slot
[1:29:21.500 --> 1:29:23.500]  Than the lame ducks do on their network
[1:29:23.500 --> 1:29:24.500]  Oh, there's no doubt you do
[1:29:24.500 --> 1:29:25.500]  And I do
[1:29:25.500 --> 1:29:26.500]  I'm banned on Fox News
[1:29:26.500 --> 1:29:27.500]  I'm banned in Britain
[1:29:27.500 --> 1:29:30.500]  So what does that tell us about Rupert Murdoch's politics?
[1:29:30.500 --> 1:29:32.500]  What is MOLOC really doing here?
[1:29:32.500 --> 1:29:33.500]  Is MOLOC really supporting?
[1:29:33.500 --> 1:29:34.500]  Michael Savage, let me say
[1:29:34.500 --> 1:29:35.500]  BOTS here in the break
[1:29:35.500 --> 1:29:36.500]  Or see if you don't have another interview coming
[1:29:36.500 --> 1:29:37.500]  You probably got to go
[1:29:37.500 --> 1:29:38.500]  You're always a party
[1:29:38.500 --> 1:29:39.500]  No, no, let's stay
[1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:40.500]  Let's keep doing this
[1:29:40.500 --> 1:29:41.500]  Let's do it, stay there
[1:29:41.500 --> 1:29:42.500]  We'll be right back
[1:29:42.500 --> 1:29:43.500]  The Empires on the Run
[1:29:43.500 --> 1:29:46.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:29:51.500 --> 1:29:53.500]  Are you concerned about your prostate?
[1:29:53.500 --> 1:29:55.500]  Do you pee more often than you do?
[1:29:55.500 --> 1:29:58.500]  Once again, the food of Americans
[1:29:58.500 --> 1:30:03.500]  One of the most basic staples, chicken, is under attack
[1:30:03.500 --> 1:30:06.500]  Alabama reports that they have found
[1:30:06.500 --> 1:30:10.500]  Three cases of bird flu in your paltry
[1:30:10.500 --> 1:30:13.500]  Ashley Beckford here for infowars.com
[1:30:13.500 --> 1:30:16.500]  Alabama has found three paltry facilities
[1:30:16.500 --> 1:30:18.500]  In the northern part of the state
[1:30:18.500 --> 1:30:20.500]  Its agricultural department is claiming
[1:30:20.500 --> 1:30:23.500]  That this happened near where two cases
[1:30:23.500 --> 1:30:26.500]  Were detected recently in nearby Tennessee
[1:30:26.500 --> 1:30:30.500]  Alabama has not received any definitive test results
[1:30:30.500 --> 1:30:33.500]  That confirm its cases are highly pathogenic
[1:30:33.500 --> 1:30:35.500]  Which is the more lethal form of the virus
[1:30:35.500 --> 1:30:37.500]  According to a spokeswoman
[1:30:37.500 --> 1:30:41.500]  For the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries
[1:30:41.500 --> 1:30:43.500]  Find out what's in your food
[1:30:43.500 --> 1:30:46.500]  Because your health is your most valuable resource
[1:30:46.500 --> 1:30:50.500]  If you want to stay in tune for more health news
