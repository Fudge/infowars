[00:00.000 --> 00:13.200]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:13.200 --> 00:18.800]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you've got one!
[00:18.800 --> 00:30.520]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.520 --> 00:34.240]  It's only 38 days.
[00:34.240 --> 00:39.120]  From the November 8th, 2016 election, it's already Friday.
[00:39.120 --> 00:46.520]  The final day of September broadcast that we have left, it is September 30th, 2016.
[00:46.520 --> 00:47.520]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:47.520 --> 00:50.600]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:50.600 --> 00:56.680]  We have former prosecutor, lawyer, broadcaster, Lionel, from Lionel Media joining us to break
[00:56.680 --> 00:58.440]  down the debate.
[00:58.440 --> 01:02.040]  His analysis of it, we're also going to be taking your phone calls today.
[01:02.040 --> 01:05.120]  I'm looking at drudgereport.com right now.
[01:05.120 --> 01:11.480]  Hillary Clinton in a new LA Times poll, and I've looked at the methodology of this poll.
[01:11.480 --> 01:19.000]  It is basically leaning slightly towards Hillary, but is fairer, and that's why consistently
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.800]  Donald Trump, the last what, four months, has always, even when he was the presumptive
[01:24.800 --> 01:33.080]  nominee in the month or so before the RNC in Cleveland, he was five, six, seven points
[01:33.080 --> 01:34.080]  ahead of her.
[01:34.080 --> 01:42.520]  Generally, he's been about three, four points ahead, and right now he is almost six points
[01:42.520 --> 01:43.520]  ahead.
[01:43.520 --> 01:44.680]  It's almost six points.
[01:44.680 --> 01:48.000]  Clinton in September down five points.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.080]  Dead people are registered to vote in Virginia.
[01:50.080 --> 01:52.080]  You can, of course, guess what party they're with.
[01:52.080 --> 01:55.840]  They got D's in front of them, and we've got a breakdown of the electoral map.
[01:55.840 --> 02:02.280]  We've got a lot of this news also on m4works.com, but drudge, is it so easy to find with that
[02:02.280 --> 02:09.520]  elegant, simple layout, and I'm tempted to copy, but I'm not going to do it.
[02:09.520 --> 02:12.800]  But Battle for the White House, I kind of did with the Jones report, but we never really
[02:12.800 --> 02:13.800]  updated it right.
[02:13.800 --> 02:17.960]  The point is, plus, you've got to be up 24 hours a day to be able to update it the way
[02:17.960 --> 02:18.960]  drudge does.
[02:18.960 --> 02:21.080]  I'm certainly glad drudge is there, aren't you?
[02:21.080 --> 02:24.800]  m4works.com is loaded with important news as well.
[02:24.800 --> 02:28.840]  Trump has come out and said what we said that night, and what we said the next day, that
[02:28.840 --> 02:30.600]  the debate was rigged.
[02:30.600 --> 02:31.600]  And it was rigged.
[02:31.600 --> 02:36.560]  He asked 40-plus questions and interrupted, and Lester Holtz is there and goes, no, you
[02:36.560 --> 02:40.760]  did not say that you were against the Iraq war.
[02:40.760 --> 02:46.600]  Trump's like, yes, I did, said three times, no, you didn't, and I'm just sitting there
[02:46.600 --> 02:47.600]  watching that.
[02:47.600 --> 02:55.800]  We have the videos, once in writing, then in a book, and then three times on video.
[02:55.800 --> 02:59.920]  So I say three times, we have three times, and I've got a limited staff, a limited crew
[02:59.920 --> 03:03.480]  of video editors and people to go and dig all this stuff up.
[03:03.480 --> 03:06.320]  That's why I go out and dig some of them up myself.
[03:06.320 --> 03:14.600]  But we need to take the three video clips of him in 2003, and then there's several more
[03:14.600 --> 03:19.800]  in 2004, and then even more in 2005, so how the media spins all this, in fact, checks
[03:19.800 --> 03:24.200]  image, they build a straw man, and they go out and they find where he was against the
[03:24.200 --> 03:30.080]  war in 2006, and go, no, Trump, you were against it later.
[03:30.080 --> 03:35.280]  And then they show people a clip of him in 2006, lying by omission.
[03:35.280 --> 03:41.200]  There it is, 2003 clip backs up Trump on Iraq war opposition, and he says, very politely,
[03:41.200 --> 03:44.840]  I'm not Bush's enemy, but I really think this isn't a good idea, maybe we shouldn't be doing
[03:44.840 --> 03:45.840]  this.
[03:45.840 --> 03:50.440]  And then he goes on to say, I don't think we should be doing it, I don't think we should
[03:50.440 --> 03:51.440]  be doing it.
[03:51.440 --> 03:56.640]  You know, get other countries who also support this, we need to do more intelligence, we
[03:56.640 --> 03:59.960]  need to look at the facts on this.
[03:59.960 --> 04:05.440]  And so they just have Hillary get up on TV and say, no, you didn't.
[04:05.440 --> 04:07.520]  And it's all a big con game.
[04:07.520 --> 04:13.440]  The latest hoax, the video's up on infowars.com, is a woman has come out, a reporter, and says
[04:13.440 --> 04:20.280]  that months and months and months ago, she's only bringing this up now, and she's crowded
[04:20.280 --> 04:24.200]  with all these reporters bumping into each other, it's a feeding frenzy, fighting to
[04:24.200 --> 04:27.280]  get to Trump.
[04:27.280 --> 04:30.200]  And the woman doesn't look like a reporter, but she's sitting there with a camera in
[04:30.200 --> 04:31.200]  his face.
[04:31.200 --> 04:32.200]  He's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[04:32.200 --> 04:35.160]  He goes, okay, your reporter, I'll answer your question.
[04:35.160 --> 04:38.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you haven't been a celebrity, and I'm certainly not a celebrity
[04:38.720 --> 04:42.120]  like Donald Trump, and I'm not trying to brag that I'm a celebrity, but you've seen live
[04:42.120 --> 04:44.880]  footage, feeds, and it's been on the national news.
[04:44.880 --> 04:49.160]  When I go out to a political event, I mean, it's like crowds almost falling over me.
[04:49.160 --> 04:50.360]  It's very, very scary.
[04:50.360 --> 04:54.120]  In fact, when I was covering Bilderberg, and it was a crowd of almost 4,000 people outside
[04:54.120 --> 04:58.960]  the hotel, and they were fans, it was people like falling over like a rock concert, and
[04:58.960 --> 05:00.360]  I had to get out of there.
[05:00.360 --> 05:02.160]  I mean, this could be dangerous.
[05:02.160 --> 05:05.880]  It's only recently that Trump has mainstreamed the term globalist so effectively that they
[05:05.880 --> 05:10.120]  can no longer hide from the label, but they still try to hide their true agenda.
[05:10.120 --> 05:15.000]  The Christian Post pointed out that globalism is a secular, humanistic religion of sorts
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.040]  that envisions a one-world government.
[05:17.040 --> 05:22.120]  An American thinker article titled Globalism the Religion of Empire says the religion of
[05:22.120 --> 05:28.280]  globalism sees an earthly utopian world order in which all men pay allegiance to elite priests
[05:28.280 --> 05:31.720]  who rule over a world city without national borders.
[05:31.720 --> 05:36.080]  The globalists will erase not only geographical borders, but the boundaries on how government
[05:36.080 --> 05:38.000]  will intrude into your life.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.880]  You can forget the First Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights if they succeed.
[05:41.880 --> 05:45.840]  Even those like Jeremy Radkin, who don't support Trump, see that the globalists seek
[05:45.840 --> 05:50.040]  to quote, organize the world in a way that establishes an artificial consensus.
[05:50.040 --> 05:52.400]  It's not enough to say it's undemocratic.
[05:52.400 --> 05:53.400]  It's threatening.
[05:53.400 --> 05:54.400]  It's almost demonic.
[05:54.400 --> 05:59.800]  It is a world organized independently of people's fundamental religious convictions.
[05:59.800 --> 06:02.000]  For EverWorst.com, I'm David Knight.
[06:02.000 --> 06:03.840]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[06:03.840 --> 06:05.200]  It took you over a year to do it.
[06:05.200 --> 06:06.920]  Why is this so good?
[06:06.920 --> 06:11.440]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[06:11.440 --> 06:16.240]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[06:16.240 --> 06:17.240]  my system.
[06:17.240 --> 06:22.480]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[06:22.480 --> 06:25.280]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[06:25.280 --> 06:30.360]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[06:30.360 --> 06:31.640]  going on everywhere.
[06:31.640 --> 06:32.640]  These are all parasites.
[06:32.640 --> 06:35.360]  Tell us about all the stuff you said that there's so many things that are in it.
[06:35.360 --> 06:36.600]  You have the neem in there.
[06:36.600 --> 06:39.680]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[06:39.680 --> 06:42.960]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[06:42.960 --> 06:43.960]  All right.
[06:43.960 --> 06:46.160]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[06:46.160 --> 06:47.320]  It just came back in yesterday.
[06:47.320 --> 06:48.320]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.

[07:57.560 --> 08:15.600]  It's Friday, September 30th, 2016, only 38 days from the most important decision the United
[08:15.600 --> 08:17.600]  States may have ever made.
[08:17.600 --> 08:28.320]  You're listening to the Alex Chilling Show, broadcasting worldwide from Austin, Texas.
[08:28.320 --> 08:32.600]  The conservative website that's called the Drudge Report pulled out all the stops today.
[08:32.600 --> 08:36.720]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me.
[08:36.720 --> 08:39.200]  Tip Matt, it's over for you.
[08:39.200 --> 08:41.680]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[08:41.680 --> 08:42.680]  You're out of there.
[08:42.680 --> 08:45.640]  They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[08:45.640 --> 08:49.560]  This is the savage nation where you're having difficulties with today's program.
[08:49.560 --> 08:55.480]  I read you some of the side effects of Levedopa and then I was cut off the air and the side
[08:55.480 --> 08:57.200]  effects are very serious.
[08:57.200 --> 08:59.240]  They match one of the candidates.
[08:59.240 --> 09:05.720]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot
[09:05.720 --> 09:10.640]  have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[09:10.640 --> 09:13.360]  Hillary Clinton with the NSA.
[09:13.360 --> 09:15.640]  Good luck if you dissent.
[09:15.640 --> 09:16.640]  Good luck.
[09:16.640 --> 09:17.640]  Some people love him.
[09:17.640 --> 09:21.680]  Some people hate him and the White House may fear him because they can't control him.
[09:21.680 --> 09:26.800]  I've been saying they could put Hillary Clinton's brain in a jar in the Oval Office and she
[09:26.800 --> 09:27.800]  would be elected.
[09:27.800 --> 09:33.120]  Anybody who is 70 years old who's hypothyroid you do not elect president, ladies and gentlemen,
[09:33.120 --> 09:34.600]  you don't do it.
[09:34.600 --> 09:42.080]  Today the leading conservative website's headline was this, Civil War, Senate to Go for Handguns.
[09:42.080 --> 09:48.480]  I challenge Hillary, take away your secret service, take it away now, take away your
[09:48.480 --> 09:53.840]  secret service, dismiss them, have no security around you, have no guns around you, Hillary.
[09:53.840 --> 10:00.920]  I dare you, I dare you, Obama, same thing, drop your guns, Obama, take your secret service
[10:00.920 --> 10:06.320]  away, Obama, take it all away, leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[10:06.320 --> 10:09.240]  Let everybody know there's no guns on the White House grounds, Obama.
[10:09.240 --> 10:12.240]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[10:12.240 --> 10:15.040]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[10:15.040 --> 10:20.960]  So they're asking us to drop our guns and to drop our security measures.
[10:20.960 --> 10:24.040]  And then the White House shot back and said, you know, made some cheap shot about, oh,
[10:24.040 --> 10:25.040]  he used to be relevant.
[10:25.040 --> 10:26.040]  Are you kidding me?
[10:26.040 --> 10:27.880]  Matt Drudge used to be relevant?
[10:27.880 --> 10:28.880]  Let me give you the numbers.
[10:28.880 --> 10:36.840]  In one month, go on the website, 800, almost 810 million unique views on the Drudge Report.
[10:36.840 --> 10:43.200]  After an American standing up, tough, facing these headwinds, wow, are they blowing?
[10:43.200 --> 10:47.280]  And this is the reason why I came to see you, Alex, you are one of the very few who are
[10:47.280 --> 10:54.120]  operating under this theory to be an independent American in a big way.
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.480]  If you're calling as media fine, if you're calling as sports, whatever it is, you've
[10:59.480 --> 11:04.120]  got to be the greatest you can be now, now.
[11:04.120 --> 11:11.240]  Every speech is the dread of tyrants live from the info wars.com studios.
[11:11.240 --> 11:22.240]  It's the Alex Jones show because there is a war for your mind.
[11:22.240 --> 11:26.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we put together that little video out of the 45 minute interview
[11:26.880 --> 11:32.240]  we had with Drudge last year because that's really a powerful interview.
[11:32.240 --> 11:37.520]  And we're making a few more of those intros because so much of what he said a year ago
[11:37.520 --> 11:38.920]  is really pertinent.
[11:38.920 --> 11:42.640]  Can you imagine having Matt Drudge back on the radio?
[11:42.640 --> 11:52.040]  I mean, just how riveting the things he talked about were, it's just amazing.
[11:52.040 --> 11:55.160]  And we need Matt Drudge, and I've not been emailing him, we're trying to call him, but
[11:55.160 --> 11:56.160]  I think I am.
[11:56.160 --> 12:00.440]  Make me do this today, Buckley, because I'm pretty bad about not bugging people either.
[12:00.440 --> 12:06.560]  I need to go ahead and reach out and try to get him on the show because I understand things
[12:06.560 --> 12:08.200]  are compacted.
[12:08.200 --> 12:10.600]  I understand that things are accelerating.
[12:10.600 --> 12:15.160]  And so if Drudge usually does an interview every three, four years, and he gave me one
[12:15.160 --> 12:20.040]  of those, probably one of the most coveted interviews there is out there, I just hope
[12:20.040 --> 12:24.240]  he gives somebody the interview because he needs to talk about what's going on.
[12:24.240 --> 12:28.880]  And I've heard a few of the other interviews he's done a few years before he did mine,
[12:28.880 --> 12:33.480]  and they weren't as powerful and they weren't as big.
[12:33.480 --> 12:39.960]  So that's what I'm saying is that I am going to ask Drudge for another interview.
[12:39.960 --> 12:45.200]  All right, I've just, as usual, got giant stacks of news and a ton of incredible things
[12:45.200 --> 12:46.200]  to cover.
[12:46.200 --> 12:50.960]  And I'm back in that position where I did a lot of preparation this morning, hours of
[12:50.960 --> 12:57.120]  preparation last night, hours of preparation this morning, and then I just get in here
[12:57.120 --> 13:00.200]  and I'm so upset by the time I get on air, I can hardly do the show.
[13:00.200 --> 13:05.240]  And then my intellectual acumen, like 80% of it's gone because I'm just angry at Hillary
[13:05.240 --> 13:06.240]  Clinton.
[13:06.240 --> 13:10.880]  I was talking to Roger Stone earlier and I started cussing, talking about Hillary Clinton
[13:10.880 --> 13:15.400]  and I'm just like, how have I let myself get in this position?
[13:15.400 --> 13:20.080]  I'm trying to control myself right now, okay?
[13:20.080 --> 13:28.600]  But it's really hard to watch 30, 40 video clips of unbelievable outrageous lies by the
[13:28.600 --> 13:33.880]  Democrats and the media, and then have all this news here in front of me and then know
[13:33.880 --> 13:38.080]  that Donald Trump isn't going to win by 90%.
[13:38.080 --> 13:43.880]  I mean, you should have 100% of the public voting right now, this election is so critical,
[13:43.880 --> 13:48.520]  so obvious that the power structure is in panic mode, they're throwing everything they've
[13:48.520 --> 13:54.000]  got at Trump, and that means the American people, and this is a referendum on populism,
[13:54.000 --> 14:01.720]  and I think what sent me over the edge this morning, because I got up at like 6am and
[14:01.720 --> 14:07.840]  saw the clip from I guess last night, and then I was working out this morning with
[14:07.840 --> 14:15.880]  Fox News on and they played it like five times, just get the clip ready, and there's this
[14:15.880 --> 14:22.800]  arch criminal that is destroying our country, that has committed so many crimes, I get
[14:22.800 --> 14:33.360]  chills thinking about it, and Hillary is on her airplane saying that he's bad because
[14:33.360 --> 14:42.400]  he had a research company look at business opportunities in Cuba.
[14:42.400 --> 14:49.320]  Now I happen to know a lot about Cuba, I've studied it, it's in the news a lot, and I've
[14:49.320 --> 14:53.560]  actually been approached by people about startups in Cuba, that's usually where you can end
[14:53.560 --> 14:59.920]  up making the really big money, and there is a gold rush going into Cuba as it's been
[14:59.920 --> 15:07.480]  opened up by the Democratic Party and by Hillary Clinton State Department and by Barack Obama,
[15:07.480 --> 15:15.520]  and so you can fly there now with just doing a little bit of red tape, now if you go with
[15:15.520 --> 15:23.640]  business consortiums, get into Cuba, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, the big telecoms, the big
[15:23.640 --> 15:28.800]  insurance companies, the infrastructure companies, the hotel companies, the casino companies,
[15:28.800 --> 15:33.960]  they're all moving in there right now, Trump is in the hotel business, so he hires a management
[15:33.960 --> 15:40.920]  company that investigates business opportunities, which is completely normal for someone that
[15:40.920 --> 15:53.720]  builds hotels worldwide, and Cuba used to be like Miami and 10 or 15 other giant resort
[15:53.720 --> 16:00.280]  towns rolled into one, I mean it was roaring, it was rocking, it was awesome, talking to
[16:00.280 --> 16:09.200]  the folks that are older that used to go to Cuba, and that is completely normal for a
[16:09.200 --> 16:15.360]  business person, and it's not illegal, and it's this big national story with the press,
[16:15.360 --> 16:19.920]  even Fox with straight faces going, this could be pretty serious, wow breaking an embargo
[16:19.920 --> 16:25.840]  rule, that's like a felony, yeah, and then you go look at what Trump did, he hired a
[16:25.840 --> 16:32.640]  international management company to go in and do a prospectus on how do you invest, can
[16:32.640 --> 16:41.280]  you invest, should you invest, is it trustworthy, meanwhile Hillary Clinton is the one that
[16:41.280 --> 16:46.080]  opened it up, as much as Barack Hussein Obama, whether you believe that's a good thing or
[16:46.080 --> 16:52.280]  not, she's giving missile secrets when she's co-president to the communist Chinese, she's
[16:52.280 --> 16:59.240]  selling out our technology, our military technology across the board, not just ICBM systems, entire
[16:59.240 --> 17:07.480]  systems, guidance, lift off, boost, reentry, MIRV, warhead, miniaturization, you name it,
[17:07.480 --> 17:14.000]  they got it, anything you want baby, you got it, anything at all, baby, you got it, Roy
[17:14.000 --> 17:21.240]  Orberson, anything you need, anything you want, you got it, you got it, you got it,
[17:21.240 --> 17:26.800]  and then just the Russians and the Saudi Arabia and the corruption and funding all the criminal
[17:26.800 --> 17:31.200]  groups and bringing the refugees into Europe and the United States and on and on and on
[17:31.200 --> 17:37.440]  and the lying and the immunity that the FBI basically is issuing pardons now, he's calling
[17:37.440 --> 17:43.720]  it rigged, he's saying that these are the FBI five or whatever, Trump's not using the
[17:43.720 --> 17:51.480]  right term, this is a FBI pardon and the FBI shouldn't be able to issue pardons with this
[17:51.480 --> 17:56.560]  so-called immunity to then make it safe for Hillary not getting trouble because all the
[17:56.560 --> 18:03.000]  witnesses that got caught red-handed lying to Congress and should all be going to jail,
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.000]  how do you get them out of that?
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.280]  You give them immunity supposedly under racketeering laws to get the kingpin but then the FBI and
[18:09.280 --> 18:13.960]  the Justice Department are working for the very kingpin that they just gave immunity
[18:13.960 --> 18:19.800]  to, see up the chain from the people under Hillary is Comey and his Loretta Lynch and
[18:19.800 --> 18:23.280]  all these criminals and their criminals, I'm just going to say it, what the FBI director
[18:23.280 --> 18:28.000]  did is criminal, it was this big PR campaign that he was this good guy and he was going
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.800]  to actually go after him and all the rest of it and I said okay, I hope so but let me
[18:31.800 --> 18:35.360]  tell you something, this is criminal and if they get away with this, the sky's the limit
[18:35.360 --> 18:38.440]  and you notice now they don't care, they're just committing crimes out in the open everywhere
[18:38.440 --> 18:49.280]  and then Hillary, let me skip this break, has the eggs to go on television and say that
[18:49.280 --> 18:55.880]  oh Donald Trump, not just he's corrupt, not just he's bad but that see he doesn't care
[18:55.880 --> 19:02.760]  about American interest, he puts his interest above America when this is exactly what she's
[19:02.760 --> 19:08.320]  done worse than anyone in US history, literally, I can't think of anyone who's sold us out
[19:08.320 --> 19:13.160]  as bad, as long and on so many fronts as Hillary Clinton but it gets richer, the reason it was
[19:13.160 --> 19:20.080]  so rich is I watched this 22nd clip and all this data hits me, everything she's done,
[19:20.080 --> 19:25.560]  the hypocrisy, the fraud and then it gets worse in my mind in a split second, that's
[19:25.560 --> 19:33.160]  why I get a headache because I instantly start thinking and my gosh, she's the one that opened
[19:33.160 --> 19:40.920]  up trade with Cuba and now she's saying he's bad for going to do trade against America
[19:40.920 --> 19:45.680]  when she's the one that opened up the trade and now she's saying it's bad to trade with
[19:45.680 --> 19:52.400]  Cuba, it's un-American when she's the mothership of it and Trump didn't even invest there,
[19:52.400 --> 19:59.240]  he looked at investing, I don't go around doing investment stuff, I don't go around
[19:59.240 --> 20:05.000]  meeting with people but somebody rich enough, famous enough, wants to meet with me and thinks
[20:05.000 --> 20:09.640]  they've got an idea for bringing stuff into Cuba, I'm like they're not going to let me
[20:09.640 --> 20:15.040]  be in the media in Cuba, you don't really think they're going to open up the telecoms
[20:15.040 --> 20:17.840]  and everything and actually let us in there, that's why they're bringing Microsoft and
[20:17.840 --> 20:23.360]  Google and everybody into block and censor, they're bringing that in here too, see America
[20:23.360 --> 20:26.840]  can't have a free open internet and then the rest of the world not having, you understand,
[20:26.840 --> 20:31.680]  they have to get rid of it for us folks, we can't be rich and have cars and air conditioning
[20:31.680 --> 20:36.400]  and then tell the Africans they can't, that's what global government is people, it's making
[20:36.400 --> 20:42.440]  you poor, headline, Hillary Clinton secretly pushed Cuba deal for years, yes she's the
[20:42.440 --> 20:47.200]  one behind it, folks if you dig hard enough she bragged, I remember seeing it last year
[20:47.200 --> 20:52.160]  when this Cuba deal went through and the finalization this year, she bragged that she was involved
[20:52.160 --> 20:56.440]  in that and said it was good and that she had been the top negotiator behind the scenes
[20:56.440 --> 21:01.480]  as the Secretary of State four years ago, it's just like we don't get the clips where
[21:01.480 --> 21:07.560]  she brags and takes credit for the TPP and unlike Al Gore on the internet, that's a lie
[21:07.560 --> 21:13.000]  he didn't invent that, she is pretty much the main person that I'll tell you, she works
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.920]  like the devil, like her husband said, she works like a demon, remember Bill said that
[21:16.920 --> 21:21.240]  a few weeks ago, that woman flew all over the world constantly and actually worked to undermine
[21:21.240 --> 21:28.360]  this country and sell us out and do all this stuff, Hillary works like a demon, she does
[21:28.360 --> 21:35.680]  fall down all the time, I mean over the years a few times and was frequent, not frequent,
[21:35.680 --> 21:45.600]  so see how do I do a show when one 20 second clip, I'm gonna play the whole minute clip
[21:45.600 --> 21:54.480]  but 20 seconds of it is the meat, when she's the author of it, what Trump did is legal
[21:54.480 --> 22:00.040]  and then she lies and says he's a criminal, the media goes along with it and then she
[22:00.040 --> 22:05.800]  turns it all the way around and says he doesn't care about US interest because he would try
[22:05.800 --> 22:15.320]  to do business in Cuba, when she's the honcho, they say that Thomas Jefferson wrote about
[22:15.320 --> 22:18.720]  80% of the Declaration of Independence, he'd bring it back, say what about this, what about
[22:18.720 --> 22:23.800]  that, there were a bunch of different versions of it and when I say she's the honcho, I mean
[22:23.800 --> 22:27.080]  it's kind of like Thomas Jefferson was the honcho of the Declaration of Independence,
[22:27.080 --> 22:34.920]  the Cuba deal is Hillary's, it's mainstream news admits that, that would be like again
[22:34.920 --> 22:41.560]  Hitler being the head judge at the Nuremberg trial and telling Nazis that he orders to
[22:41.560 --> 22:46.480]  be hung because you follow the orders of Adolf Hitler, I am ordering you hung from the neck
[22:46.480 --> 22:52.240]  until dead and then the media goes along with it and says well Hitler said that they follow
[22:52.240 --> 22:57.560]  the orders of Hitler and that's the Nuremberg code and they're ordered dead and the media
[22:57.560 --> 23:04.720]  doesn't say but it's Hitler sitting in judgment of Hitler's men but this isn't where he did
[23:04.720 --> 23:09.560]  something that she authored and commanded, he just looked at it, see that's why I'm
[23:09.560 --> 23:13.760]  telling you I can't cover the news because one clip I can talk about for an hour because
[23:13.760 --> 23:19.800]  it illustrates everything, it illustrates the entire spectrum of BS and there's more than
[23:19.800 --> 23:31.760]  just that, I just, I really worry about humanity, I really worry about where we're going and
[23:31.760 --> 23:38.200]  what's happening, if people don't see through this, there's another video I'm going to play
[23:38.200 --> 23:46.880]  today that's up on infowars.com that Margaret Howell got on Austin streets where we actually
[23:46.880 --> 23:52.880]  go out and show you on South Congress at UT down by 6th Street what Trendy's believe
[23:52.880 --> 23:59.360]  and it is a super frightening video, brainwash Trendy's think Hillary won first debate, Trump
[23:59.360 --> 24:07.200]  won but it wasn't the devastating victory he could have had and because they ganged up
[24:07.200 --> 24:15.720]  so bad is the only reason I can say he really won, they overdid it but it shows Trump is
[24:15.720 --> 24:20.240]  being sold on being more quote presidential which means being timid and that's not what
[24:20.240 --> 24:27.000]  people want and he's back on the warpath again and that's good but the reason this other
[24:27.000 --> 24:33.400]  video we're about to play after the Hillary one is so important is that these people,
[24:33.400 --> 24:39.240]  a bunch of them actually say I like her and want her to be president and she's going
[24:39.240 --> 24:44.800]  to be president so she won the debate, I mean if Trump lost the debate I would say Trump
[24:44.800 --> 24:49.720]  lost the debate, I don't put perfume on a pig and that shows the difference of these people,
[24:49.720 --> 24:56.200]  they're not analytical, they're not scientific, they're delusional, they are the delusionals,
[24:56.200 --> 25:02.000]  they call us the deplorables, they are the delusionals, they really are in a cult because
[25:02.000 --> 25:10.800]  so many of them say Trump lost because I wanted him to lose, Hillary won because I wanted
[25:10.800 --> 25:16.680]  her to win and you could argue the expectations were set so low that just by being able to
[25:16.680 --> 25:23.320]  stand there for 90 minutes, though she looked like hell, you could say she won I guess on
[25:23.320 --> 25:31.000]  that aspect but that's not what judges the overall contest and like I said when you cheat
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.640]  and interrupt somebody 40 plus times and won't let them talk and she's giving hand signals
[25:34.640 --> 25:38.800]  everybody saw through that and did say well Holt did really gang up, I mean a lot of liberals
[25:38.800 --> 25:44.320]  even said yeah well Trump deserves it but yeah Holt did gang up because see there's
[25:44.320 --> 25:47.680]  no sense of fairness with these people, they're like well he's a piece of crap, it's like
[25:47.680 --> 25:53.480]  Rachel Maddow and others, I played the clip so I'll dig them back up and that Carlos Watson
[25:53.480 --> 25:58.000]  and all of them on MSNBC like of course the IRS is going after the Tea Party and these
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.600]  Christian groups, these are right wing racists, they just dehumanize you, you're a right wing
[26:02.600 --> 26:10.480]  racist and you're a liar, there's no penalty, Alex Jones deeply racist and hates our black
[26:10.480 --> 26:18.400]  president, no I hate this bill that's now law, that's now raping this company, a lot of expansion
[26:18.400 --> 26:26.880]  we want to do, eating into that is we've got to do the stupid Obamacare stuff, got to do
[26:26.880 --> 26:32.760]  it because they'll just charge us more with the penalties and you're like well just don't
[26:32.760 --> 26:37.920]  pay the IRS, they'll come shut this place down, they'll come break my legs metaphorically,
[26:37.920 --> 26:44.120]  that's the country we live in, of course it's unconstitutional, of course it's illegal,
[26:44.120 --> 26:49.920]  we're an info war, we fight with information, not physically, not with bullets, it may come
[26:49.920 --> 26:53.520]  to that for the country down the road, that's what the Declaration of Independence says it
[26:53.520 --> 27:03.000]  may come to, but I don't want that, but you can't run a big media operation like this
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.520]  and be political on the tip of the spear and not sit there and pay the stupid income tax
[27:07.520 --> 27:12.480]  and have outside CPA firms and lawyers make sure it's all triple checked because they'll
[27:12.480 --> 27:16.800]  come in here and they'll shut us down like they're doing everybody else folks, Donald
[27:16.800 --> 27:23.520]  Trump's been audited every year for 30 plus years.
[27:23.520 --> 27:28.720]  We have had the enjoyment of the feds and the enjoyment of the state and the enjoyment
[27:28.720 --> 27:34.880]  of socialist globalist inspectors that have come to this office and are shaking in hatred
[27:34.880 --> 27:40.040]  of me and hoping I'd do something and I just sit there in a very polite and get them some
[27:40.040 --> 27:46.480]  coffee and whatever you need and they're always so embarrassed like, I mean my lawyers
[27:46.480 --> 27:49.800]  say, I don't talk about this stuff on air, but my lawyers say they have seen things done
[27:49.800 --> 27:56.520]  to us that they've never seen before, some of these are top national lawyers, they say
[27:56.520 --> 28:02.960]  we've seen things done to you that we've never seen before, if I told you some of the stuff
[28:02.960 --> 28:08.080]  folks, it is insane, but I'm not going to sit there and feed the trolls, I'm not going
[28:08.080 --> 28:14.000]  to get into it, but it's Kafkaesque, okay, it is Kafkaesque and Kafkaesque means I am
[28:14.000 --> 28:21.600]  accused of things and they won't tell me what it is I'm being accused of.
[28:21.600 --> 28:30.840]  The feds two years ago came here and accused us and accused me of things and wouldn't say
[28:30.840 --> 28:38.840]  what they were, they said, you know what you did, the secret thing and you sit there and
[28:38.840 --> 28:39.840]  go, huh?
[28:39.840 --> 28:50.960]  And then they actually filed stuff on me and it said, it's secret and we don't have
[28:50.960 --> 28:55.240]  any evidence, but it doesn't matter, we want to move forward with this, but then of course
[28:55.240 --> 28:59.440]  it didn't move forward, I'm like, go ahead, go ahead do whatever you want, you crazy people,
[28:59.440 --> 29:05.280]  you nuts, the whole world sees you now, I'm going to come back and play the Hillary
[29:05.280 --> 29:11.840]  Club and the other clips, but it's just the magnitude of the insane asylum we live in
[29:11.840 --> 29:19.880]  and look, I'm very analytical, I'm very logical, then you just see me after I've done the research
[29:19.880 --> 29:25.160]  blowing up on air because it's a struggle to deal with this, to live this, to know all
[29:25.160 --> 29:28.960]  this, I mean, and I know you know all this as well and as the public learns more, they're
[29:28.960 --> 29:33.880]  going to get in the position I'm in, or it's just like insane, I mean it's insane, Hillary
[29:33.880 --> 29:39.040]  Clinton is a murdering, sick, crazy kingpin and she's got all these weird trendies, I've
[29:39.040 --> 29:43.360]  seen the videos they put out at MSNBC and media matters behind the scenes hopping around
[29:43.360 --> 29:48.440]  acting stupid, playing with Star Wars toys, while they engage in hardcore racketeering
[29:48.440 --> 29:51.600]  crime that makes the Nazis blush.
[29:51.600 --> 29:59.600]  Here on the March, The Empire's on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.600 --> 30:07.960]  A CNN headline quotes a wealthy Venezuelan saying, I flew to the US to buy toilet paper.
[30:07.960 --> 30:12.000]  Venezuela, where the poor are hunting dogs and cats for food, where the criminals are
[30:12.000 --> 30:16.120]  hunting down and killing police for their guns, and where the communist dictator gave
[30:16.120 --> 30:22.240]  Wall Street 700% return on their investment. The communists and the banksters have destroyed
[30:22.240 --> 30:26.280]  the country so thoroughly that even the wealthy have to get out of the country if they want
[30:26.280 --> 30:31.040]  to wipe their butts. A true excrement hits the fan scenario.
[30:31.040 --> 30:35.280]  The 66-year-old Venezuelan flew to New York and went shopping at Whole Foods, fighting
[30:35.280 --> 30:39.960]  back tears when she saw a fully stocked food shelf. She said, you are so happy when you
[30:39.960 --> 30:44.320]  find something as basic as milk. The socialist welfare state and Bankster
[30:44.320 --> 30:49.760]  crony capitalism are not just policies and friends of Hugo Chavez. They're also the policies
[30:49.760 --> 30:53.400]  and friends of Hillary Clinton. And there's another lesson to learn from this wealthy

[33:04.440 --> 33:11.200]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:11.200 --> 33:12.200]  the Info War.
[33:12.200 --> 33:17.520]  So what I was trying to get at yesterday and today is just for the regular listeners, the
[33:17.520 --> 33:24.360]  millions of people that tune in. Kind of just explain my methodology and the fact that I'm
[33:24.360 --> 33:28.760]  retrospectively trying to understand why I engage in behaviors on air that I don't really
[33:28.760 --> 33:35.280]  engage in in private life. And it really is that it's painful to come in here and to do
[33:35.280 --> 33:40.600]  all this research and to know that there's no way to even cover 10% of it properly. I
[33:40.600 --> 33:50.320]  mean, I just covered Hillary for 10 minutes. At least 10 minutes I spent on the otherworldly
[33:50.320 --> 34:01.480]  satire macabre twisted universe garbage of a mainstream media propping up Hillary with
[34:01.480 --> 34:09.200]  all her crimes and all her past saying that Trump is bad because he's trying to break
[34:09.200 --> 34:15.240]  it embargo in Cuba and build hotels when that's not even what he did. And then she's
[34:15.240 --> 34:23.240]  the one that got the law changed and quarterbacked the deal. And then she says because he doesn't
[34:23.240 --> 34:27.880]  care about this country only his own interest when that's exactly what globalism is doing
[34:27.880 --> 34:32.960]  to us and exactly what this woman's main crime is is shelling out US interest for money at
[34:32.960 --> 34:38.160]  her foundation. I mean, the Clintons were in the White House a month and they would
[34:38.160 --> 34:46.080]  have seven, eight communist Chinese generals out of uniform but top current generals in
[34:46.080 --> 34:54.840]  private three, four, five hour meetings. And then a month later, they would basically just
[34:54.840 --> 35:02.680]  illegally transfer the missile secrets and other secrets and just say we've told Laurel
[35:02.680 --> 35:08.920]  and Hughes and others we believe this is okay. We've told NASA this is okay. We put a letter
[35:08.920 --> 35:14.720]  out a signing statement basically and I'll just pardon you know Hillary or whatever or
[35:14.720 --> 35:19.840]  myself if you try to indict us and see Congress wouldn't go after them because the prosecutor
[35:19.840 --> 35:25.960]  they put in Ken Starr worked for the main communist Chinese law firm. It was all staged
[35:25.960 --> 35:30.840]  they went after sex and the cigar and all the rest of it because it was something the
[35:30.840 --> 35:35.920]  public would bite into. And I've talked to David Shippers the impeachment lawyer I mean
[35:35.920 --> 35:39.080]  they've all been on it's a fact and it's all come out later. In fact it was in the news
[35:39.080 --> 35:44.000]  a few months ago that Ken Starr was basically a Chinese agent mainstream news went oh Ken
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.080]  Starr is really flip flop he works for the Chinese and the Democrats and all this now
[35:48.080 --> 35:56.480]  that's who he always was folks. This is a woman that allowed China the most populous country
[35:56.480 --> 36:04.480]  in the world to have ICBM technology from top to bottom from from launch to reentry
[36:04.480 --> 36:16.160]  targeting avionics everything. First stage boost second stage boost everything and they
[36:16.160 --> 36:19.840]  gave them the cruise missiles and they gave them the jet technology and they gave them
[36:19.840 --> 36:25.840]  the guidance technology they gave them everything the Chinese communist didn't even have copies
[36:25.840 --> 36:31.120]  of tow missiles until the mid 90s because the Clintons gave it to them those are anti-tank
[36:31.120 --> 36:41.320]  weapons that a two-man team has. Everything and then she sits there and says Donald Trump
[36:41.320 --> 36:46.960]  is a traitor to America when he's trying to save the country bring back the Republic
[36:46.960 --> 36:51.400]  and I'm not a purist on Trump because he is a nationalist he is a patriot and he's got
[36:51.400 --> 36:58.520]  the enemy scared to death of him because they know who he is. Donald Trump is super pigheaded
[36:58.520 --> 37:03.520]  Donald Trump I'll tell people that know him gets tears in his eyes during the Star Spangled
[37:03.520 --> 37:08.280]  banner when he's watching a football game at home folks he is deeply sentimental about
[37:08.280 --> 37:15.400]  this country he loves it and he loves America folks and that's why they hate him period and
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.520]  he's a little authoritative he's an old-fashioned strongman and that's not what I've always
[37:19.520 --> 37:23.400]  wanted or called for but you know God works in mysterious ways and if a strong man comes
[37:23.400 --> 37:28.320]  in and kicks the new world order's ass out of this country and arrest a bunch of these
[37:28.320 --> 37:33.960]  traitors and they know let me tell you something folks the military the army especially and
[37:33.960 --> 37:38.840]  a lot of judges and people they're ready to start arresting people okay don't you want
[37:38.840 --> 37:46.520]  to see people getting arrested you're going to see it and that's why they have pushed
[37:46.520 --> 37:54.000]  everything to the most hardcore level we've ever seen because they know they're going
[37:54.000 --> 38:02.760]  to jail if Donald Trump gets in that's why they're scared their minimum they know the
[38:02.760 --> 38:06.600]  new world order is collapsing you heard Steve Pachinic and by the way Steve Pachinic will
[38:06.600 --> 38:12.160]  talk over you he's worse than I am he's aggressive he's smart old years ago a lot of the audience
[38:12.160 --> 38:18.440]  didn't really like him a lot of the audience did but I'm gonna start having him on for
[38:18.440 --> 38:22.720]  longer and not interrupting him as much but I think I'm gonna give him pre-written questions
[38:22.720 --> 38:26.400]  show that he covers what I want to hear him get into that he can cover other stuff he
[38:26.400 --> 38:30.440]  wants to but people are now clicking that guy came on five years ago and he said globalism
[38:30.440 --> 38:37.600]  is gonna fall the next five six years and this country's gonna go down this way and
[38:37.600 --> 38:41.840]  that country's gonna go down that way and you're gonna see Spain breaking up you're
[38:41.840 --> 38:46.000]  gonna see the UK pulling out you're gonna see that here and the answer is Texas and
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.680]  the answer is Georgia and the answer is and then we're gonna rebuild this and that and
[38:51.680 --> 38:58.240]  it's like all happening and so I like Pachinic and know he's spot on and and expose 9-11 and
[38:58.240 --> 39:02.000]  the fake bin Laden deal 14 years or 13 years before it came out and everything else I mean
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.200]  I know the guy knows what he's talking about and you hear him make these you know huge
[39:07.200 --> 39:17.320]  statements these big statements and it's true I mean he was one of the key people in bringing
[39:17.320 --> 39:21.560]  down the Soviet Union one of the key people and overthrowing nine countries I mean when
[39:21.560 --> 39:25.640]  I have him on sometimes he says stuff the FBI's in his house the next day he's in federal
[39:25.640 --> 39:31.880]  court he's got foreign countries trying to extradite him you know over stuff you name
[39:31.880 --> 39:38.440]  it I mean it's it's real and that's what I'm telling you folks is that in hindsight you
[39:38.440 --> 39:43.440]  see how accurate we've been how accurate our key guests have been but you also see that
[39:43.440 --> 39:48.880]  we've been trying to hold off this new world order while we fight it it slows down now
[39:48.880 --> 39:52.560]  they're behind they're getting more desperate and people say well where's the world government
[39:52.560 --> 39:56.320]  you said it was coming we're like we're trying to hold it back that's why but you see what
[39:56.320 --> 39:59.680]  they've done they're collapsing all these countries and then now it's finally running
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.080]  over as people are going whoa it's real they're announcing the UN coming in to run our elections
[40:04.080 --> 40:08.600]  and run our police and what in the world my power prices just went way up and oh my gosh
[40:08.600 --> 40:17.240]  they know you know admit that they're spying on me yes folks we're not in Kansas anymore
[40:17.240 --> 40:21.480]  and they've blown the drawbridge out though I mean the physical gates are now blasted
[40:21.480 --> 40:27.680]  open the country is falling very very quickly we're being maneuvered into total collapse
[40:27.680 --> 40:32.200]  so is Europe they're now collapsing the third world to then rush us with migrant waves that
[40:32.200 --> 40:42.400]  are 10 15 20 times bigger in the next decade and the world is just going to be in a giant
[40:42.400 --> 40:52.520]  civil war ethnic war religious war economic war clashes manipulation with the globalist
[40:52.520 --> 40:57.640]  in their stir in the pot and then always posing as the saviors consolidating power globally
[40:57.640 --> 41:08.080]  into global organs to counter global crises they created planetary government that's end
[41:08.080 --> 41:15.600]  game is not some Buck Rogers future not some you know glistening jetpacks and space stations
[41:15.600 --> 41:22.320]  and life extension technology no no no no a future that's a boot stomping on a face forever

[42:16.800 --> 42:23.360]  probiotic biome defense that really is the best probiotic that we could come out with
[42:23.360 --> 42:28.560]  there are four big companies that produce 90% of it there's a few small boutique companies
[42:28.560 --> 42:33.680]  and everything else you've got to have a medical license to get even though it's not prescription
[42:33.680 --> 42:37.480]  we have to get medical doctors and people just to be signatories in my company a lot
[42:37.480 --> 42:42.680]  of times even get bulk shipments of ingredients that are saying DNA force I mean Miss Obesia
[42:42.680 --> 42:47.960]  America doesn't even talk to you give an MD you know isn't isn't the one doing the contracts
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.440]  even the stuff is not prescription it's prescription in some parts of the world and that's just
[42:52.440 --> 42:57.520]  an example of DNA forces some of the things that are in it that they are trying to make
[42:57.520 --> 43:02.920]  prescription because they're they're they're so helpful and the big farmer wants to take
[43:02.920 --> 43:07.480]  control they want to make fish oil prescription in fact you can actually get it covered under
[43:07.480 --> 43:10.760]  insurance in those plans now you can just go to the store and buy it I mean that's what
[43:10.760 --> 43:14.600]  I'm talking about here this is getting crazy and then they don't want you to sell fish
[43:14.600 --> 43:19.880]  oil anymore I mean next what don't eat fish don't eat cod don't eat sardines I mean you
[43:19.880 --> 43:24.120]  know this is how they're patenting the building blocks of life and then saying you can't have
[43:24.120 --> 43:28.240]  them that's why they're they're they're coming out with Monsanto and it's now gotten the
[43:28.240 --> 43:38.440]  license for the new system that can edit genes in live time the crisp crisper and then that
[43:38.440 --> 43:43.080]  means they're going to create a new version of it and patent that and say you don't own
[43:43.080 --> 43:46.960]  anymore and if you're doubting me people that had their blood taken in the last 40 something
[43:46.960 --> 43:53.360]  years it's put in a Pentagon UN database actually broke this news in 1997 with a medical nurse
[43:53.360 --> 43:59.200]  out of the medical facility in San Antonio got me the info she said look we we data store
[43:59.200 --> 44:05.640]  the blood here it's also sent to the UN it's stored in Europe and they are patenting people's
[44:05.640 --> 44:10.600]  particular proteins and DNA in their body and then when folks are going to go try to
[44:10.600 --> 44:15.360]  get DNA treatments they're going to be told you don't own your own DNA anymore and we
[44:15.360 --> 44:20.640]  patented it people didn't believe me until they have parents started to do the file lawsuits
[44:20.640 --> 44:24.720]  in Austin and Minneapolis St. Paul and then sure enough the lawyers all discovered it
[44:24.720 --> 44:31.800]  was true of course it was true without a Fort Sam Houston medical center in San Antonio
[44:31.800 --> 44:38.680]  and then they suddenly saw the headlines about a year later oh a woman went in to get you
[44:38.680 --> 44:42.600]  know this DNA treatment was told to be a hundred plus thousand dollars for the license
[44:42.600 --> 44:48.800]  because the protein in her blood was bought by a company decades ago and they had it on
[44:48.800 --> 44:54.880]  file and are telling her that treatment is owned by them because they got the blood through
[44:54.880 --> 45:00.440]  a giant eugenics program the eugenicists want the cures that are in our blood that are in
[45:00.440 --> 45:05.680]  our DNA in our mutations that's why they're getting your blood that's why they're storing
[45:05.680 --> 45:12.880]  it they don't send your baby's blood to the health department because they want to check
[45:12.880 --> 45:16.760]  and see for rare diseases they could check it on the spot in fact they don't check for
[45:16.760 --> 45:26.040]  the diseases they send your blood to the government now point I'm getting at is they're hitting
[45:26.040 --> 45:30.840]  us so hard that there's no way to reverse whole things are doing to us all you can do
[45:30.840 --> 45:35.120]  is mediate it mitigate it as much as you can and from our research the number one thing
[45:35.120 --> 45:46.440]  is the gut and not having trace element deficiencies and that's where biome defense comes in ladies
[45:46.440 --> 45:50.800]  and gentlemen and it is the very best we can come up with it uses a lot of the stuff that's
[45:50.800 --> 45:57.920]  developed in Europe that again as I was saying is prescription and I thought about the processes
[45:57.920 --> 46:05.200]  how this all works sign up for auto ship and you get additional 10% off there's also free

[46:10.000 --> 46:16.080]  or call toll free 888-253-33139 okay I burned up most the first hour only on a few stories
[46:16.080 --> 46:20.200]  I'm going to have to really get my head down here and start moving quickly but since I
[46:20.200 --> 46:28.400]  mentioned this here's Hillary in fact when we post this chop this up and posted the web
[46:28.400 --> 46:33.160]  later can we go back in and hard at it when we put it on YouTube back earlier when I talked
[46:33.160 --> 46:36.760]  about it so when people are watching that they can actually see it hard and I play it
[46:36.760 --> 46:40.640]  now again too but I want to hard edit that end to just somewhere in there as people
[46:40.640 --> 46:43.480]  actually see what I'm talking about instead of me just talking about it 30 minutes ago
[46:43.480 --> 46:47.600]  the now about talk about it again after recap it the point is he's a total hypocrite Donald
[46:47.600 --> 46:51.120]  Trump didn't do anything illegal he had a company looking to could he legally put hotels
[46:51.120 --> 46:56.400]  in and the answer is only if you go to the Clintons they're going to broker what companies
[46:56.400 --> 47:01.600]  can go in and that's Microsoft Google you know Bezos and this is about controlled economies
[47:01.600 --> 47:06.120]  and what she's really saying is nobody can build in Cuba but us that's why we did this
[47:06.120 --> 47:11.720]  deal and you're not doing what's good for America Trump you only do stuff for yourself
[47:11.720 --> 47:18.200]  the biggest Chinese spy this country's ever seen communist communist again the Chinese
[47:18.200 --> 47:22.240]  communists are just a bunch of generals using their people slaves it's all the terms all
[47:22.240 --> 47:28.320]  of it it's all lie these are horrible piratical evil psychopaths that enjoy hurting you while
[47:28.320 --> 47:32.320]  they become fabulously rich off your labor and they prance around all day with little
[47:32.320 --> 47:38.120]  girls on stage whether the Joker creature walking around like actually fear for the children
[47:38.120 --> 47:45.520]  that are close to her just the demonic energy but here she is today we learned about his
[47:45.520 --> 47:54.960]  efforts to do business in Cuba which appear to violate US law certainly flout American
[47:54.960 --> 48:02.960]  foreign policy and he has consistently misled people in responding to questions about whether
[48:02.960 --> 48:11.720]  he was attempting to do business in Cuba we have laws in our country and the efforts
[48:11.720 --> 48:17.960]  that Trump was making to get into the Cuban market putting his business interest I had
[48:17.960 --> 48:26.320]  of the laws of the United States and the requirements that businesses were operating
[48:26.320 --> 48:33.040]  under because of the sanctions shows that he puts his personal and business interest
[48:33.040 --> 48:40.520]  ahead of the laws and the values and the policies of the United States of America people have
[48:40.520 --> 48:47.360]  to look carefully in making their decision about who to vote for because it will be either
[48:47.360 --> 48:53.320]  him or me and I am going to do everything I can to make sure it's me and then she has
[48:53.320 --> 48:59.520]  a Joker face this is a twilight zone so this isn't real it was like the head of city bank
[48:59.520 --> 49:03.920]  came out and said there's like a 50% chance or something this is a computer simulation
[49:03.920 --> 49:09.200]  I mean is this a joke is this like satire for space aliens or something like they watched
[49:09.200 --> 49:14.760]  this and this is like entertainment I'm not saying that literally it's again that's an
[49:14.760 --> 49:21.920]  allegory but I mean sometimes I wonder because Trump had a company look at trying to get
[49:21.920 --> 49:27.200]  him into Cuba and then they got all these requirements where basically the Democratic
[49:27.200 --> 49:36.240]  Party decides if you can kind of like more than 10,501 C3s were given to Democrat groups
[49:36.240 --> 49:41.760]  and then three were given in the last what is it eight years seven and a half years and
[49:41.760 --> 49:49.640]  counting to Republicans or conservatives or veterans groups or gun groups so you want
[49:49.640 --> 49:57.880]  a charity to promote an idea let's say being kind to animals animal welfare let's just
[49:57.880 --> 50:02.560]  randomly pick something or maybe starving kids or something if you if they go look
[50:02.560 --> 50:08.240]  at who you are and if you have any conservative or pro-American leanings you don't get it
[50:08.240 --> 50:11.240]  and you know what you don't get into Cuba either and you don't get it anything else
[50:11.240 --> 50:18.760]  and if you're not the right race you don't get the scholarship or you don't get admitted
[50:18.760 --> 50:22.800]  and then they use the chivalry of the last of Christianity go well that is discrimination
[50:22.800 --> 50:27.040]  but we discriminated so now we've got to discriminate no it just turns into another evil it doesn't
[50:27.040 --> 50:33.280]  work and it creates division but that's all the chicken feed down at the low level with
[50:33.280 --> 50:42.840]  the globalist it's just next level it's and consider it and go we have laws and the press
[50:42.840 --> 50:49.240]  is all nodding oh yes oh we have we're a nation of laws right Hillary you just been caught
[50:49.240 --> 50:56.360]  lying committing crimes organized crime espionage on and on and on it's not about infidelity

[53:56.920 --> 54:21.320]  big brother mainstream media you want answers now so do I I'm Alex Jones your host by the
[54:21.320 --> 54:25.920]  way if you're a TV viewer watching us right now there's a big controversy going there
[54:25.920 --> 54:29.480]  is a pyramid graphic that we've been having when we come in that shows the United Nations
[54:29.480 --> 54:34.360]  and there's another one that shows a world government flag that then burns and catches
[54:34.360 --> 54:39.200]  on fire and I guess because I didn't direct this properly I just said hey those graphics
[54:39.200 --> 54:43.720]  from that earlier film I want to use those as an intro to you know show the UN is behind
[54:43.720 --> 54:48.920]  world government well people then think that I'm pushing world government let me explain
[54:48.920 --> 54:54.040]  we're against world government when we show the UN symbol and a pyramid we're saying that's
[54:54.040 --> 54:58.120]  the new world order but I can get some people thinking that we're trying to get something
[54:58.120 --> 55:05.040]  over on them because it doesn't show the next part where it burst into flames it burns so
[55:05.040 --> 55:10.040]  somehow in that graphic sequence we need to get the part where it burns but but why did
[55:10.040 --> 55:15.000]  Christ say you judge a tree by its fridge we're against the corrupt global government we're
[55:15.000 --> 55:22.760]  against Illuminati style systems we're against secrecy and and combines and monopolies that's
[55:22.760 --> 55:30.000]  what Hillary and the globalists are creating okay so something can look bad but you have
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.040]  to look at the track record of it and not look for secret signs and things that you
[55:34.040 --> 55:38.400]  know I'm here giving hand signals the new world order because I do things like this
[55:38.400 --> 55:44.080]  like you know put my index finger my thumb together ever since I was a child I saw people
[55:44.080 --> 55:48.240]  do that hand signal maybe I've been programmed by TV we all have so and so when I'm making
[55:48.240 --> 55:52.920]  a point I do that that people have been doing that for thousands of years could you say
[55:52.920 --> 55:58.200]  that means the Illuminati or something sure but every time there's a circle or if we have
[55:58.200 --> 56:04.920]  a symbol of a new future for America and it shows a sun coming up of dawn a new day of
[56:04.920 --> 56:12.720]  course the globalists have taken that powerful symbol they've taken every symbol and so well
[56:12.720 --> 56:18.240]  you the American flag has stars on it and pentacles can be used in magic it just symbolizes
[56:18.240 --> 56:25.640]  each state so you have to go with the spirit of something and what it stands for not groping
[56:25.640 --> 56:32.240]  around looking for conspiracies that aren't there see the real conspiracy theorist out
[56:32.240 --> 56:35.480]  there like mainstream media they just make stuff up and see what people will buy but
[56:35.480 --> 56:41.240]  there's also people online that will are like fiction writers they just say it's real okay
[56:41.240 --> 56:46.720]  they got big imaginations great I'm covering how things really work and look at how we've
[56:46.720 --> 56:54.000]  been proven right but again I don't deserve to have my you know brass ring or a medal
[56:54.000 --> 56:59.200]  because the globalist told us what they're building that's really my biggest frustration
[56:59.200 --> 57:05.160]  is that low information voters know they're being lied to but they just think oh but
[57:05.160 --> 57:11.400]  Trump's lying too no he's one of the most honest people in quote politics I've ever
[57:11.400 --> 57:19.280]  seen and that's because he's super stubborn he's not gonna sit there and lie to you because
[57:19.280 --> 57:23.720]  he thinks he's right the problem is he's so honest the way he puts things they can spin
[57:23.720 --> 57:28.760]  it and twist it but you know if the American people want to keep being bamboozled knock
[57:28.760 --> 57:32.680]  yourselves out and go with Hillary but I tell you you've really hitched your wagon to somebody
[57:32.680 --> 57:42.880]  evil the globalists are out of control they are completely anti-human and they're they're
[57:42.880 --> 57:48.200]  coming after humanity now I got a bunch of clips I want to play 15 questions white people
[57:48.200 --> 57:52.880]  have for Buzzfeed racist it's very powerful I haven't gotten a Margaret House piece which
[57:52.880 --> 57:59.120]  shows delusion where almost all the Democrats she talked to go Hillary won because I want
[57:59.120 --> 58:05.920]  her to win and because she'll be the next president well let's say a team's gonna win
[58:05.920 --> 58:14.320]  the Super Bowl okay but if they lose a game and most of the polls show that well then
[58:14.320 --> 58:18.240]  you say well I don't think she did as good as she could have I think Trump kind of won
[58:18.240 --> 58:24.760]  but he's still a horrible guy that would have been honest I mean cuz Trump won but no no
[58:24.760 --> 58:29.560]  they just say I want her to win so I say she won we'll be back I'm Alex Jones second hour

[03:26:01.800 --> 03:26:16.800]  and when you are making millions of dollars and you are not only you are making millions but you're elevated and provided a pedestal where you are the voice of a progressive group.
[03:26:16.800 --> 03:26:38.800]  There is this deification, this apotheosis, this lionization and you become part of group thing, racial matter when others not heard per se but others become connected into this organic thinking machine where they are not only right but they're justified and they're pure and donald trump is evil.
[03:26:38.800 --> 03:26:48.800]  And you can give them anything and the more strident they become the more they are praised the more bonuses the more money and what happens is let me just stop by.
[03:26:48.800 --> 03:26:58.800]  If you were to say Rachel I saw her interview where she absolutely castigated Hillary Clinton because because she was basically a Bernie Sanders fan.
[03:26:58.800 --> 03:27:18.800]  She said Rachel for $25,000 in a new car please list in any order you want all of the reasons why Hillary Clinton will benefit the country and what particular platform or precept or future vision that you endorse and believe in not that it's not going to be a trump or you're going to stifle a
[03:27:18.800 --> 03:27:28.800]  election but tell me what Hillary Clinton has promised you tell me about her plan. Exactly Lionel we're out of time. Thank you so much my friend.
[03:27:28.800 --> 03:27:34.800]  Here with us today we really appreciate you. Thank you sir. I got to hand this over to David not he always just prepared for the show.
[03:27:34.800 --> 03:27:48.800]  Obviously but Lionel's on target on media.com. I want to just say this in closing. Again it doesn't hurt me that they they say I'm a Russian age. Okay I'm actually say it. It's that they know it's not true.
[03:27:48.800 --> 03:27:55.800]  And they know that if this country had any type of IQ that that would get them in a lot of trouble.
[03:27:55.800 --> 03:28:07.800]  I think the country does have somewhat of an acumen. So then what does that say I think they've gone crazy I think what Lionel just said is right. They're all in there reinforcing themselves or Hitler who was a pretty smart guy a bad guy but smart.
[03:28:07.800 --> 03:28:15.800]  Actually believe that General Steiner and stuff was going to save him and beat the Russians and beat the United States and the Allies.
[03:28:15.800 --> 03:28:27.800]  When there were armies 10 times the size of theirs re equipped closing in on Berlin. It wasn't till the last two days before they got to his bunker. They were 300 yards away.
[03:28:27.800 --> 03:28:36.800]  And he still thought he was going to win. And I'm going to tell you they call us the deplorables they are the delusionals.
[03:28:36.800 --> 03:28:45.800]  They are they are they are they may get Hillary in through fraud or some October surprise. Trump's not in yet.
[03:28:45.800 --> 03:28:52.800]  Looking at it I think he's about five 10 points ahead depending on how you look but break it but make no mistake.
[03:28:52.800 --> 03:28:54.800]  They're done.
[03:28:54.800 --> 03:29:06.800]  Globalism is done like Steve Pachennick said and the more time goes on realize how smart that guy is. I'm going to get him on for a whole hour next week about the devolution power back to the locals back to the states.
[03:29:06.800 --> 03:29:11.800]  You know back to these political unions getting broken up not getting bigger getting smaller is the answer.
[03:29:11.800 --> 03:29:16.800]  And if we can save the country I sure want to do it.
[03:29:16.800 --> 03:29:36.800]  We don't have a country right now we're a corporate colonial structure now and if they put this seriously ill crazy corrupt lady that steals silverware from the White House and plates.
[03:29:36.800 --> 03:29:46.800]  Most of us don't even know that that's admitted. These people are the lowest trash. They would come to your house and this is known to the Clintons will steal stuff out of your house folks.
[03:29:46.800 --> 03:30:08.800]  Making one known a writer president will be back today tonight. We're on the March the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:30:08.800 --> 03:30:20.800]  Trump urging them to get out and vote to defeat Trump. The UN quickly erased the tweet from the record 1984 style and made a statement saying it was a mistake and that it did not originate from the UN News Center.
[03:30:20.800 --> 03:30:29.800]  If you believe that now the Arizona Republic the largest newspaper in Arizona is backing Clinton a Democrat for the first time in its history.
[03:30:29.800 --> 03:30:40.800]  The Arizona Republic is now losing subscribers and receiving death threats. The USA today has made an unprecedented move and endorsed Clinton declaring Trump unfit to be president.
[03:30:40.800 --> 03:30:48.800]  So establishment politicians and establishment media are clearly against Donald Trump. This is the establishment against Trump.
[03:30:48.800 --> 03:31:01.800]  When will the anti establishment Trump bashers wake up. This is Owen Schreuer from info wars dot com. Remember to download our new app info wars live.

[03:33:02.800 --> 03:33:18.800]  From the front lines of the information war.
[03:33:18.800 --> 03:33:23.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:23.800 --> 03:33:36.800]  This is not about talking about myself. This is not Gonzo journalism. But I'm not purely engaged in journalism. I'm engaged in pretty much pure activism using the truth as a weapon against the tyrants.
[03:33:36.800 --> 03:33:42.800]  When I hand the baton to David Knight. Not only this is night seven o'clock central. He's going to be hosting this Sunday.
[03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:47.800]  I think Roger Stone is going to come on but specifically on a battle plan to really stop the steal.
[03:33:47.800 --> 03:33:57.800]  I don't know if they'd organize me poll watchers but how are they going to try to steal it. But everything's coming together. This is the planets aligning for good or for bad right now and.
[03:33:57.800 --> 03:34:05.800]  When you fight globalism which is a modern form of corporate colonialism in their own words that setting up a technocracy to control and enslave everybody.
[03:34:05.800 --> 03:34:19.800]  A planetary government based on rigged economies unfair weights and balances unfair justice systems where only the globalist can basically operate.
[03:34:19.800 --> 03:34:22.800]  And then they have the nerve.
[03:34:22.800 --> 03:34:27.800]  When you're finally proven right and it all comes out in the news.
[03:34:27.800 --> 03:34:37.800]  The world government corporate world government you name it. They just go we're just going to divide and conquer and use racism with the minorities and divide everybody and.
[03:34:37.800 --> 03:34:40.800]  That's wrong that's racist of course it's racist.
[03:34:40.800 --> 03:34:47.800]  You realize oh my God your conscious sociopaths even mid level people now that work for the system they know.
[03:34:47.800 --> 03:34:54.800]  I thought we'd wake everybody up and then we turn this around instead it's like oh I might want to join that. Thanks for teaching me how it really worked.
[03:34:54.800 --> 03:35:04.800]  You get a job in it and you're like oh my gosh this is a system to destroy prosperity and screw people over what type of idiot would sign on to something like that.
[03:35:04.800 --> 03:35:08.800]  What the hell is your problem.
[03:35:08.800 --> 03:35:14.800]  But I coined a term a few days ago and I asked Nico to remind me what it was it was.
[03:35:14.800 --> 03:35:16.800]  What was the word Nico.
[03:35:16.800 --> 03:35:18.800]  He may not be in the room anymore.
[03:35:18.800 --> 03:35:21.800]  He was just reminding me like during the break going hey.
[03:35:21.800 --> 03:35:25.800]  Okay delusion night thank you so I've got this idea.
[03:35:25.800 --> 03:35:28.800]  Somebody had the idea we were doing a photo shoot.
[03:35:28.800 --> 03:35:34.800]  But he's like we need to have a photo shoot with you and the reporters I was like okay and then somebody said we should do it like the.
[03:35:34.800 --> 03:35:40.800]  Deplorables and I said okay let's do that and then I said oh no Watson's not in it's let's Photoshop him in so there's a new one out of that.
[03:35:40.800 --> 03:35:42.800]  That we just tweeted out at real Alex Jones.
[03:35:42.800 --> 03:35:52.800]  Please make it viral.
[03:35:52.800 --> 03:35:56.800]  Hillary Clinton said so there's not really a six foot frog we get it.
[03:35:56.800 --> 03:36:02.800]  But I thought these people are the delusionals this morning and hit me.
[03:36:02.800 --> 03:36:09.800]  So we're going to Photoshop anybody else can do this you know territorialized ideas I just want to win and have freedom in this information war.
[03:36:09.800 --> 03:36:13.800]  But we can have the.
[03:36:13.800 --> 03:36:19.800]  Deplorables okay but you are the delusionals and you can form the new delusion I party.
[03:36:19.800 --> 03:36:30.800]  That's the new word I've invented delusion I were you just during your own fantasy land and you're completely insane and you and you just believe whatever mainstream media says.
[03:36:30.800 --> 03:36:39.800]  And then hey it doesn't matter if you're mainstream meaning you have a 6% approval rating and everybody hates you just be delusional and say you're winning and then maybe get enough of your delusion I followers to believe it.
[03:36:39.800 --> 03:36:43.800]  So when you do still the election.
[03:36:43.800 --> 03:36:45.800]  The 60% or whatever that were robbed.
[03:36:45.800 --> 03:37:00.800]  Believe the con and buy into your delusion I system because what you're building is so inhuman so garbage filled so ash backward so upside down so two plus two equals whatever Carl Rove or Barack Obama says.
[03:37:00.800 --> 03:37:02.800]  That we don't even have a hope.
[03:37:02.800 --> 03:37:11.800]  Of understanding it and that is it that's why they're dumbing the kids down it's why they're scrambling the brains it's why they're at war with mathematics and reality is because.
[03:37:11.800 --> 03:37:21.800]  They are the delusionites Hillary herself is delusion I how does she think she's going to keep going she's probably a bigger victory if she does get in the more I think about it because it's so discrediting.
[03:37:21.800 --> 03:37:36.800]  You guys have destroyed your soft power now you're saying you're going to censor us and arrest us and we're Russian spies you're you've lost when you start calling people that are Americana anti globalist total nationalist.
[03:37:36.800 --> 03:37:46.800]  Russian spies and you call Nigel Farage a Russian spy because 25 years ago before this debate was even going he didn't like the UK going under EU control with no voting.
[03:37:46.800 --> 03:37:48.800]  You've lost.
[03:37:48.800 --> 03:37:54.800]  You arrest me and say I'm a Russian spy plotting to assassinate Hillary.
[03:37:54.800 --> 03:37:59.800]  Yes folks they have a federal investigation going on that okay I've confirmed it.
[03:37:59.800 --> 03:38:00.800]  You heard it right.
[03:38:00.800 --> 03:38:09.800]  I'm not a Russian spy I'm not planning to assassinate Hillary and then it all clicked oh my gosh it's what Watson said he smells they're going to do a false flag.
[03:38:09.800 --> 03:38:18.800]  And they could do something so big and so delusional and so crazy where they could try to kill Hillary and say one of my listeners did it or hell folks say I did it.
[03:38:18.800 --> 03:38:21.800]  I mean the sky's the limit why not.
[03:38:21.800 --> 03:38:26.800]  These are people that when they left the White House stole the China.
[03:38:26.800 --> 03:38:36.800]  And I keep going back to that because it's the trashiness it's the boldness it's the psychopaths stop stop they lose connection with reality.
[03:38:36.800 --> 03:38:42.800]  David I know I'm on fire today and people get mad at me I'm going to explain when we have fourth hour it's always known that I may just go into the fourth hour.
[03:38:42.800 --> 03:38:53.800]  They're just they're in the wings of this pony gets tired but David always gets ready has a lot to cover so that I still kind of feel bad so it's it's best of times worst of times but it's just all coming into view now David for me.
[03:38:53.800 --> 03:38:56.800]  I mean is it coming into view for you or do you you see something different.
[03:38:56.800 --> 03:39:00.800]  Yeah you know Alex when you were talking to Lionel and you ask him what he saw coming up.
[03:39:00.800 --> 03:39:03.800]  I think we can already see how they're pushing for World War 3.
[03:39:03.800 --> 03:39:12.800]  It was just on Wednesday that David Petraeus went on the Charlie Rose show saying it's not too late we can still have a no fly zone and he made some amazing comments Alex.
[03:39:12.800 --> 03:39:19.800]  He said it's not too late to declare a safe zone it's not too late to declare no fly zone he says you don't even have to enter their airspace.
[03:39:19.800 --> 03:39:23.800]  You could do it with cruise missiles air launched sea launched other things.
[03:39:23.800 --> 03:39:26.800]  That means blow up Russian planes.
[03:39:26.800 --> 03:39:30.800]  Please queue up the chairman of the Joint Chiefs last week.
[03:39:30.800 --> 03:39:34.800]  No coverage in the U.S. says you're asking us to do no fly that means war with Russia.
[03:39:34.800 --> 03:39:39.800]  I'm ready but I need the order and it's like these people are so delusional.
[03:39:39.800 --> 03:39:44.800]  Obama and Hillary and then the neocons won't even give the order.
[03:39:44.800 --> 03:39:49.800]  They're so disconnected they bitch at the general why is it they're in no fly zone.
[03:39:49.800 --> 03:39:55.800]  It's because they'll be a goddamn war with Russia you dumb bastards and listen I don't want to use the Lord's name in vain.
[03:39:55.800 --> 03:40:05.800]  I mean they'll be a god will damn us to hell and if we're about to have nuclear war it's time to use the GD folks because the point is is that I'm sorry to interrupt you David you're so on target.
[03:40:05.800 --> 03:40:13.800]  You're so I mean I you know there was somebody in the past who I knew who thought I was a cook for warning of World War 3 when all the experts say it's getting closer.
[03:40:13.800 --> 03:40:19.800]  I told that person I said you just need to get out of my life at this point because I don't want to be around people that don't care anymore.
[03:40:19.800 --> 03:40:24.800]  I'm sick of all you people that think not giving in a crap gives you some type of moral superiority.
[03:40:24.800 --> 03:40:26.800]  What it makes you is a piece of filth.
[03:40:26.800 --> 03:40:27.800]  I'm sorry David go ahead.
[03:40:27.800 --> 03:40:28.800]  I'm going to stop now.
[03:40:28.800 --> 03:40:30.800]  You take over you got great points to make.
[03:40:30.800 --> 03:40:33.800]  Please support us folks get our new probiotic at the Oliver prison shirt.
[03:40:33.800 --> 03:40:35.800]  We're going to stop selling it in 38 days.
[03:40:35.800 --> 03:40:38.800]  We need the financial support pray for us and spread our videos and articles.
[03:40:38.800 --> 03:40:43.800]  A lot of stuff on them for us that we didn't get to but just just just understand it's all happening.
[03:40:43.800 --> 03:40:46.800]  Everything's accelerating the censorship to control all of it.
[03:40:46.800 --> 03:40:47.800]  David I go ahead.
[03:40:47.800 --> 03:40:49.800]  Well yeah Alex is absolutely is amazing.
[03:40:49.800 --> 03:40:55.800]  You know when you were talking about that what what's going to happen and clearly one of the things that they're telling us before I get back to the war issue.
[03:40:55.800 --> 03:40:58.800]  I mean is something we should be concerned about folks.
[03:40:58.800 --> 03:41:02.800]  But even if they didn't do that even if World War 3 doesn't break out.
[03:41:02.800 --> 03:41:07.800]  They have a soft tyranny plan and I keep seeing from all the mainstream media like the Guardian the New York Times.
[03:41:07.800 --> 03:41:15.800]  Washington Post article after article after article saying there's one thing that Hillary and Trump both agree on.
[03:41:15.800 --> 03:41:22.800]  They don't want to see TPP and every time I see that I just want to slam my fist on the desk and say that is the war.
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:23.800]  That is the most blatant.
[03:41:23.800 --> 03:41:25.800]  She is the main author.
[03:41:25.800 --> 03:41:26.800]  Absolutely.
[03:41:26.800 --> 03:41:27.800]  Absolutely.
[03:41:27.800 --> 03:41:28.800]  Absolutely.
[03:41:28.800 --> 03:41:36.800]  And if you get TPP you have to understand what they're doing is they're setting this up to control our economies globally.
[03:41:36.800 --> 03:41:44.800]  Once they control our economies globally they will run them into the ground then they will use as an excuse to seize political control.
[03:41:44.800 --> 03:41:46.800]  And you have to look at Hillary Clinton.
[03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:48.800]  She is fully on board with TPP.
[03:41:48.800 --> 03:41:51.800]  It was the gold standard and do your own fact checking.
[03:41:51.800 --> 03:41:57.800]  The plan is to run down our economies to build their new breakaway civilization in their own words.
[03:41:57.800 --> 03:41:59.800]  They want you poor.
[03:41:59.800 --> 03:42:01.800]  They're building a breakaway system.
[03:42:01.800 --> 03:42:02.800]  Go ahead David.
[03:42:02.800 --> 03:42:03.800]  Yeah absolutely.
[03:42:03.800 --> 03:42:05.800]  Alex there are three different areas to this.
[03:42:05.800 --> 03:42:07.800]  We have to understand this.
[03:42:07.800 --> 03:42:08.800]  Open borders is part of it.
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:13.800]  The great people replacement bringing chaos with culture clashes that are engineered.
[03:42:13.800 --> 03:42:21.800]  The other part of it is the trade treaties where your economy will be managed by unaccountable committees that are outside of your country.
[03:42:21.800 --> 03:42:24.800]  You have absolutely no control or authority over these people.
[03:42:24.800 --> 03:42:34.800]  We're dangerously close to that now with the private Federal Reserve even pulling in people like this Chobani Greek yogurt billionaire who's not even an American citizen on the New York Fed creating economic policies.
[03:42:34.800 --> 03:42:37.800]  It's going to get much more detailed than that.
[03:42:37.800 --> 03:42:38.800]  Oh it's here.
[03:42:38.800 --> 03:42:42.800]  Again it's the TPP UN taking over now.
[03:42:42.800 --> 03:42:45.800]  It's all happening so they've got to get this bolted down because they've got agreements.
[03:42:45.800 --> 03:42:48.800]  They're building a world government and we're supposedly not part of it.
[03:42:48.800 --> 03:42:51.800]  Now here's General Joseph Dunn for the chairman of the Joint Chief since you mentioned it.
[03:42:51.800 --> 03:42:54.800]  I want to back you up for new listeners saying yeah we can have no flies on him.
[03:42:54.800 --> 03:42:55.800]  He's war with Russia.
[03:42:55.800 --> 03:42:56.800]  And as you said Charlie Rose.
[03:42:56.800 --> 03:42:57.800]  Yes.
[03:42:57.800 --> 03:42:58.800]  They've got General Patreza everyone.
[03:42:58.800 --> 03:42:59.800]  We don't.
[03:42:59.800 --> 03:43:00.800]  It's okay.
[03:43:00.800 --> 03:43:02.800]  We'll just shoot down the Russian planes with cruise missiles.
[03:43:02.800 --> 03:43:03.800]  But then they're going to respond.
[03:43:03.800 --> 03:43:05.800]  This is the craziest stuff.
[03:43:05.800 --> 03:43:07.800]  As if they don't have anything else.
[03:43:07.800 --> 03:43:08.800]  We've got all the cruise missiles.
[03:43:08.800 --> 03:43:09.800]  We've got all the sea launch missiles.
[03:43:09.800 --> 03:43:10.800]  We can just.
[03:43:10.800 --> 03:43:11.800]  We're so.
[03:43:11.800 --> 03:43:13.800]  But what happens when Russia then responds to that.
[03:43:13.800 --> 03:43:14.800]  Which they will.
[03:43:14.800 --> 03:43:15.800]  That's what I mean.
[03:43:15.800 --> 03:43:17.800]  They only talk about one move and a chess game.
[03:43:17.800 --> 03:43:18.800]  Yes.
[03:43:18.800 --> 03:43:19.800]  And they've got to know.
[03:43:19.800 --> 03:43:23.800]  It's like it's a demon from another planet trying to kill all of us going we can attack
[03:43:23.800 --> 03:43:24.800]  the Russians.
[03:43:24.800 --> 03:43:26.800]  And they don't talk about what happens when you do.
[03:43:26.800 --> 03:43:27.800]  Yeah.
[03:43:27.800 --> 03:43:28.800]  I mean it's the craziest crap.
[03:43:28.800 --> 03:43:31.800]  And then it's not like we're attacking the Russians to free some people.
[03:43:31.800 --> 03:43:34.800]  We're attacking the Russians so they can't defeat al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[03:43:34.800 --> 03:43:35.800]  And that's the key.
[03:43:35.800 --> 03:43:36.800]  That's the key.
[03:43:36.800 --> 03:43:39.800]  Why do we have to stop Russia from defeating ISIS?
[03:43:39.800 --> 03:43:40.800]  That's the most insane.
[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:42.800]  Donald Trump has common sense and says this is great.
[03:43:42.800 --> 03:43:43.800]  They're like oh my God.
[03:43:43.800 --> 03:43:44.800]  You're a Russian agent.
[03:43:44.800 --> 03:43:48.800]  You're not going to let our Saudi Arabian jihadis kill everyone and kill the Christians.
[03:43:48.800 --> 03:43:49.800]  You're so horrible Trump.
[03:43:49.800 --> 03:43:50.800]  He's not a Russian agent.
[03:43:50.800 --> 03:43:53.800]  He's an agent of not wanting to commit suicide.
[03:43:53.800 --> 03:43:54.800]  Delusionites.
[03:43:54.800 --> 03:43:55.800]  Dumbasses.
[03:43:55.800 --> 03:43:56.800]  Cheap.
[03:43:56.800 --> 03:43:58.800]  And you know Alex when we look at this.
[03:43:58.800 --> 03:43:59.800]  I see this article from The Guardian.
[03:43:59.800 --> 03:44:04.800]  They talk about well there's a new offensive that is shaping up again for the battle for Aleppo.
[03:44:04.800 --> 03:44:06.800]  And again there was a massive battle four years ago.
[03:44:06.800 --> 03:44:07.800]  What's Aleppo?
[03:44:07.800 --> 03:44:08.800]  Aleppo.
[03:44:08.800 --> 03:44:09.800]  Yeah what is Aleppo?
[03:44:09.800 --> 03:44:10.800]  Yeah are you listening Gary Johnson?
[03:44:10.800 --> 03:44:11.800]  Pay attention right now.
[03:44:11.800 --> 03:44:14.800]  There was a major battle when you were running for president four years ago.
[03:44:14.800 --> 03:44:16.800]  It is shaping up for another major battle.
[03:44:16.800 --> 03:44:18.800]  Can you name one world leader?
[03:44:18.800 --> 03:44:19.800]  Yeah.
[03:44:19.800 --> 03:44:22.800]  By the way just a month ago I told people that I thought he had a stroke.
[03:44:22.800 --> 03:44:24.800]  It was brain damage or it was mentally ill.
[03:44:24.800 --> 03:44:25.800]  And CJ came on and seconded it.
[03:44:25.800 --> 03:44:26.800]  He was here for an hour.
[03:44:26.800 --> 03:44:29.800]  And he would sit there during the break scowling and growling at me.
[03:44:29.800 --> 03:44:34.800]  And like a three year old that thinks you know he's in a Superman outfit and he can beat you up.
[03:44:34.800 --> 03:44:36.800]  And I thought it was a joke.
[03:44:36.800 --> 03:44:38.800]  I believe Gary Johnson is completely insane.
[03:44:38.800 --> 03:44:39.800]  Yeah.
[03:44:39.800 --> 03:44:41.800]  And notice it's now being illustrated.
[03:44:41.800 --> 03:44:44.800]  It's not just the fat guy who stripped down to his G string.
[03:44:44.800 --> 03:44:48.800]  I mean Gary Johnson and William Welter doing the full Monty every time they get on television.
[03:44:48.800 --> 03:44:50.800]  So they're not going to do any more town halls.
[03:44:50.800 --> 03:44:52.800]  But if we look at Aleppo.
[03:44:52.800 --> 03:44:58.800]  They've got a massive number of Syrian troops and other fighters 5,000 going in to try to take back that city now.
[03:44:58.800 --> 03:45:04.800]  And the way the Guardian reports it they said they're going to attack opposition held Aleppo.
[03:45:04.800 --> 03:45:07.800]  They won't say that it's being held by ISIS.
[03:45:07.800 --> 03:45:08.800]  See that's the way they spin it.
[03:45:08.800 --> 03:45:10.800]  The liberal papers, the mainstream media.
[03:45:10.800 --> 03:45:13.800]  I know when people get killed when the West started this invasion.
[03:45:13.800 --> 03:45:16.800]  Oh my gosh it was more death because of Assad.
[03:45:16.800 --> 03:45:17.800]  Yeah.
[03:45:17.800 --> 03:45:19.800]  Donald Trump doesn't even want to get rid of him.
[03:45:19.800 --> 03:45:24.800]  You know Donald Trump says Assad should go and Assad says I'll leave as soon as you pull out and we'll have an election.
[03:45:24.800 --> 03:45:26.800]  But we're not going to be taken over by Saudi Arabia.
[03:45:26.800 --> 03:45:27.800]  Yeah.
[03:45:27.800 --> 03:45:31.800]  Well they tried a ceasefire and that didn't last for even a week.
[03:45:31.800 --> 03:45:34.800]  Putin has said they will support making Assad go.
[03:45:34.800 --> 03:45:35.800]  Yes.
[03:45:35.800 --> 03:45:36.800]  They will stand by that effect.
[03:45:36.800 --> 03:45:37.800]  Since you mentioned I'm going to play the club.
[03:45:37.800 --> 03:45:41.800]  General Joseph Dunford saying yeah okay we can have no flies on enemies war with Russia.
[03:45:41.800 --> 03:45:43.800]  I need to get the authorization for that.
[03:45:43.800 --> 03:45:45.800]  Here it is.
[03:45:45.800 --> 03:45:52.800]  For Syria what about the option of controlling the airspace so that that barrel bombs cannot be dropped?
[03:45:52.800 --> 03:45:54.800]  All the options.
[03:45:54.800 --> 03:45:56.800]  What do you think of that option sir?
[03:45:56.800 --> 03:46:07.800]  Right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:11.800]  That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going to make.
[03:46:11.800 --> 03:46:15.800]  But it's okay because the trend isn't media matters.
[03:46:15.800 --> 03:46:17.800]  I'm not against beards but I've seen their TV shows.
[03:46:17.800 --> 03:46:24.800]  Pink shirts, green socks, Nelly guys going oh I like my cat oh I like my cat.
[03:46:24.800 --> 03:46:28.800]  Meanwhile they're having articles calling for shutting down the free press and war with Russia.
[03:46:28.800 --> 03:46:34.800]  It's like dude just because you've got a beard and a pink shirt doesn't mean it's okay to have nuclear war dumbass.
[03:46:34.800 --> 03:46:39.800]  And that's what I'm saying is I think we're the greatest danger ever because we've got a bunch of people.
[03:46:39.800 --> 03:46:44.800]  The warrior class has got its own problems but at least they're usually the ones you got to worry about starting a war.
[03:46:44.800 --> 03:46:57.800]  They're the ones stopping our crazy weirdo criminal sociopath liberals from starting World War III because even the State Department admits Hollywood's mad about the pro family agenda of Russia and that it's Christian.
[03:46:57.800 --> 03:47:07.800]  So Hollywood's got such a raging heart on for some Christians that they can't kill that they want to all die when ICBMs come into Southern California.
[03:47:07.800 --> 03:47:19.800]  Yeah you know Alex I see this and when I see these kind of remarks by David Petraeus that clip you just played there of one general trying to drill some sense into the idiot asking him,
[03:47:19.800 --> 03:47:22.800]  well we could do that but that's going to be full on war sir.
[03:47:22.800 --> 03:47:27.800]  You might want to think about that and yet you've got David Petraeus going full on Dr. Strangelove.
[03:47:27.800 --> 03:47:34.800]  You know jumping on the bomb and saying let's go you know but of course he's not going to be the one doing it he's going to send other people to do it.
[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:41.800]  But that's essentially what we're seeing Alex it's absolute insanity anybody that is not a trigger happy war mongering megalomaniac.
[03:47:41.800 --> 03:47:50.800]  Well you can be trigger happy if you're picking on Iraq or something they don't have fricking nuclear weapons and subs off the coast with the cruise missiles.
[03:47:50.800 --> 03:47:53.800]  And then they go well we've got three times the missiles the Russians do.
[03:47:53.800 --> 03:47:59.800]  Yes our three times I'll destroy the planet hundreds of times and the Russians can only destroy the planet 100 times.
[03:47:59.800 --> 03:48:00.800]  That's right.
[03:48:00.800 --> 03:48:06.800]  That is what you don't get about it they can only destroy the planet 100 times we can only destroy it 300 times.
[03:48:06.800 --> 03:48:10.800]  MAD mutually assured destruction dumbass.
[03:48:10.800 --> 03:48:17.800]  And you brought up Iraq that's the other city that everybody that Gary Johnson pay attention there's not only Aleppo but Mosul.
[03:48:17.800 --> 03:48:28.800]  Okay there's a massive battle that is shaping up in Mosul and Iraq where Aleppo is in Syria Gary and they have already got over 4,000 American troops still in Iraq.
[03:48:28.800 --> 03:48:33.800]  They have added in the last couple of weeks we keep hearing well another 500 then another 600 troops.
[03:48:33.800 --> 03:48:38.800]  And that's right Gary and Syria is on the border with Turkey that's open the border to Europe.
[03:48:38.800 --> 03:48:46.800]  So that's an Islamic invasion round they call it migrants and the UN is running a migrant jihad 80% military mail invasion.
[03:48:46.800 --> 03:48:52.800]  How crazy is that then we get the George Soros email it's a takeover we have the battle plan it's a trap.
[03:48:52.800 --> 03:48:54.800]  Yeah it's a trap.
[03:48:54.800 --> 03:48:58.800]  And the other part of the trap of course is the open borders they go to these areas.
[03:48:58.800 --> 03:49:06.800]  They incite the people that are there by massive collateral damage not only creating a war not only creating you know going to war against these people.
[03:49:06.800 --> 03:49:16.800]  But also shipping in ISIS fighters arming and training them at the same time being their air force shutting down the Syrian counter attack against ISIS that happened during the ceasefire.
[03:49:16.800 --> 03:49:25.800]  They use the American forces use the ceasefire to decimate the Syrian counter strike against ISIS and to leave a major city open for ISIS.
[03:49:25.800 --> 03:49:31.800]  It's like the Tet offensive you've got a two day period there's not supposed to be any you know war it's a ceasefire and then we total resupply.
[03:49:31.800 --> 03:49:39.800]  And you know we got Hillary Clinton saying no more ground troops in Iraq we're not ever going to have ground troops in Iraq they are putting a man 500 one week 600 another week.
[03:49:39.800 --> 03:49:43.800]  By the way I've got to be honest I'm going to leave and let you take the final segment.
[03:49:43.800 --> 03:49:47.800]  I can't believe the Russians even went along with NATO and let him do a ceasefire.
[03:49:47.800 --> 03:49:52.800]  Putin should say you have no honor you don't do anything you say you do we're not you know we're not leaving.
[03:49:52.800 --> 03:49:58.800]  But I know they want to just come in get out they don't have the money to be doing all this he doesn't want to bankrupt Russia further.
[03:49:58.800 --> 03:50:04.800]  It's just it's so evil I mean it's like when Putin said and it's the truth.
[03:50:04.800 --> 03:50:11.800]  I'm out lionizing and he told the truth that you and he said do you know what you've done turning loose these jihadis killing all these Christians and people hundreds of thousands dead.
[03:50:11.800 --> 03:50:14.800]  Do you know what your what what your leaders have done.
[03:50:14.800 --> 03:50:18.800]  I mean we literally have crazy people that are bloodthirsty running things David.
[03:50:18.800 --> 03:50:21.800]  It's absolutely insane Alex and yet we've seen just this.
[03:50:21.800 --> 03:50:27.800]  I think this was Wednesday that we saw an American official saying well you know the Russians might be getting a wave of terrorist attacks.
[03:50:27.800 --> 03:50:30.800]  We saw that illusion a couple months ago.
[03:50:30.800 --> 03:50:37.800]  Yeah that we saw illusion a couple months ago from a former CIA official saying well you know we have to come after Putin we have to strike close to him.
[03:50:37.800 --> 03:50:43.800]  We don't have to assassinate him but get close to him and you look at that film of that car that does a head on the kills his favorite chauffeur.
[03:50:43.800 --> 03:50:49.800]  I mean that guy had to drift it to get over to the left to hit that guy doing a head on collision.
[03:50:49.800 --> 03:50:50.800]  That's what they're doing.
[03:50:50.800 --> 03:50:51.800]  They're threatening it.
[03:50:51.800 --> 03:50:53.800]  There's nothing but mafia.
[03:50:53.800 --> 03:50:55.800]  Yeah and then people start striking back.
[03:50:55.800 --> 03:50:59.800]  It's pure bullying and the hookspot of the globalist is disgusting.
[03:50:59.800 --> 03:51:01.800]  David Knight take over.
[03:51:01.800 --> 03:51:05.800]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[03:51:05.800 --> 03:51:11.800]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head to head fitness tests.
[03:51:11.800 --> 03:51:13.800]  How is this even possible?
[03:51:13.800 --> 03:51:21.800]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor formulated fountain a youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:51:21.800 --> 03:51:29.800]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing in the past.
[03:51:29.800 --> 03:51:33.800]  Previously this drink was only available to elite military units.
[03:51:33.800 --> 03:51:42.800]  But for a limited time the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[03:51:42.800 --> 03:51:44.800]  But you must act fast.
[03:51:44.800 --> 03:51:46.800]  Do the high demand from members of the Coast Guard.
[03:51:46.800 --> 03:51:49.800]  Our supply is extremely limited right now.

[03:54:00.800 --> 03:54:24.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, September 30th, 2016.
[03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:30.800]  Some of the dangers that are on the horizon, we were just talking about what's going on in Syria, what's going on in Iraq.
[03:54:30.800 --> 03:54:37.800]  That area has been set on fire, as we point out many times, by Hillary Clinton, by Obama, beginning in Libya.
[03:54:37.800 --> 03:54:42.800]  And they try to say that Donald Trump was not opposed to this.
[03:54:42.800 --> 03:54:49.800]  And of course, Lionel was pointing out, even though he said he's not a big fan of Donald Trump, he really doesn't like Hillary.
[03:54:49.800 --> 03:54:55.800]  Look, one of the things I like about Donald Trump is the fact that he's not for war, and he was not for the Iraq war.
[03:54:55.800 --> 03:55:01.800]  They try to take an ambivalent statement that he made on the Howard Stern Show and turn that into a vote for Iraq.
[03:55:01.800 --> 03:55:05.800]  No, it was Hillary Clinton that voted for Iraq as a senator.
[03:55:05.800 --> 03:55:10.800]  Somebody who should have looked at the details of this, made an informed, serious decision.
[03:55:10.800 --> 03:55:15.800]  Instead, they tried to parlay that with an offhand comment that he made.
[03:55:15.800 --> 03:55:21.800]  We have an article from Kit Daniels, media fact checker infighting erupts over Trump's Iraq stance.
[03:55:21.800 --> 03:55:25.800]  He says, you got the hill, you got political fact, they can't decide what's true, what's not true.
[03:55:25.800 --> 03:55:31.800]  It's the same way it is with the polls, even with the temperatures as they try to push global warming.
[03:55:31.800 --> 03:55:35.800]  We say they can't even agree on the temperatures, the day that Hillary collapses from overheating.
[03:55:35.800 --> 03:55:39.800]  But as Kit points out, you've got Lester Holt pushing back Trump.
[03:55:39.800 --> 03:55:46.800]  The other person that he was debating in the debate on Monday night says, no, the record shows you didn't oppose the war.
[03:55:46.800 --> 03:55:54.800]  But in reality, if you go back, that statement was in January 2003, an interview with Fox News.
[03:55:54.800 --> 03:55:57.800]  Trump said, well, perhaps Bush shouldn't be doing it yet.
[03:55:57.800 --> 03:56:00.800]  Perhaps we should be waiting for the UN.
[03:56:00.800 --> 03:56:06.800]  And they said, not even a week after the invasion began, Trump said, this war is a mess.
[03:56:06.800 --> 03:56:11.800]  And that was at a time when the war support in the US was hovering at 72%.
[03:56:11.800 --> 03:56:14.800]  He was going against the grain of public opinion.
[03:56:14.800 --> 03:56:19.800]  And he also points out, Trump also spoke against the war in August 2004 interview with Esquire.
[03:56:19.800 --> 03:56:24.800]  Snopes says, oh, by then it was not a particularly controversial stand to take.
[03:56:24.800 --> 03:56:25.800]  That's not true.
[03:56:25.800 --> 03:56:33.800]  As they point out in the article, the controversial protest by Cindy Sheehan against the war at Bush's ranch didn't happen for even another year.
[03:56:33.800 --> 03:56:37.800]  So he is on record if you want to actually do the fact checking yourself.
[03:56:37.800 --> 03:56:39.800]  Take a look at the article by Kit Daniels.
[03:56:39.800 --> 03:56:44.800]  But when you look at what is coming up, look at the fact that we have the Senate bill this week.
[03:56:44.800 --> 03:56:50.800]  The Senate bill is coming out saying we're going to mandate TSA involvement with ground transportation.
[03:56:50.800 --> 03:56:53.800]  Say it's a transportation administration.
[03:56:53.800 --> 03:56:55.800]  It's not airlines, okay?
[03:56:55.800 --> 03:56:57.800]  It's going to be every bit of our transportation.
[03:56:57.800 --> 03:57:00.800]  We've got Obama's education secretary concerned about homeschooling.
[03:57:00.800 --> 03:57:03.800]  We've got the Obama-U.N. Internet takeover just hours away.
[03:57:03.800 --> 03:57:09.800]  By the way, I don't think this is going to be some kind of a Y2K scenario that we need to worry about.
[03:57:09.800 --> 03:57:13.800]  Everybody was talking about, well, when it flips over the year 2000, everything's just going to go down instantly.
[03:57:13.800 --> 03:57:16.800]  And this isn't going to happen in this case either.
[03:57:16.800 --> 03:57:19.800]  If I'm wrong, you won't hear us on Sunday, okay?
[03:57:19.800 --> 03:57:21.800]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[03:57:21.800 --> 03:57:22.800]  It's a soft tyranny.
[03:57:22.800 --> 03:57:24.800]  It's a gradual tyranny.
[03:57:24.800 --> 03:57:26.800]  That's the most dangerous kind, folks.
[03:57:26.800 --> 03:57:28.800]  That's what you really have to be concerned about.
[03:57:28.800 --> 03:57:36.800]  And in this interesting article that came out a couple of days ago, record number of guns seized in London over the last year.
[03:57:36.800 --> 03:57:37.800]  Interesting, isn't it?
[03:57:37.800 --> 03:57:38.800]  I thought they had gun control.
[03:57:38.800 --> 03:57:41.800]  They have a total gun ban, especially in London.
[03:57:41.800 --> 03:57:43.800]  Why is this happening?
[03:57:43.800 --> 03:57:51.800]  They say, well, officers have seized more than 700 guns as a number of weapons smuggled into the country continues to grow.
[03:57:51.800 --> 03:57:53.800]  See, it's not even the guns.
[03:57:53.800 --> 03:57:55.800]  It's the terrorists that they're bringing in.
[03:57:55.800 --> 03:57:57.800]  They go into these areas.
[03:57:57.800 --> 03:57:59.800]  They incite a war.
[03:57:59.800 --> 03:58:02.800]  Then they invite the people to come into the country.
[03:58:02.800 --> 03:58:06.800]  Sunday, I want to talk to you about some of the things that we didn't get to today.
[03:58:06.800 --> 03:58:11.800]  I want to talk about a lawsuit about Muslims and the factories.
[03:58:11.800 --> 03:58:14.800]  And what would Henry Ford do?
[03:58:14.800 --> 03:58:19.800]  The Muslims shut down the assembly line with multiple prayer breaks.
[03:58:19.800 --> 03:58:25.800]  You will not believe what is happening at the few places that we still have factories when they bring in the Muslims.
[03:58:25.800 --> 03:58:27.800]  They don't give the jobs to Americans.
[03:58:27.800 --> 03:58:31.800]  They give them to the Muslims like they do in Motown, making it in Muhammed Town.
[03:58:31.800 --> 03:58:32.800]  That's it for today's news.
[03:58:32.800 --> 03:58:56.800]  Join us tonight at 7 Central APM Eastern for the InfoWars Nightly News.
