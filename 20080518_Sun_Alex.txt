[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  From America's election headquarters, two more the day after tomorrow, Kentucky and
[00:05.000 --> 00:09.240]  Oregon ready to weigh in, with Hillary Clinton expected to get perhaps double the Kentucky
[00:09.240 --> 00:13.640]  vote Barack Obama will receive, and she's campaigning there all day, letting it be
[00:13.640 --> 00:16.880]  known she'll be on the balance until the very end next month.
[00:16.880 --> 00:22.120]  You don't tell some states that they can't vote and other states that have already had
[00:22.120 --> 00:25.520]  the opportunity that they're somehow more important.
[00:25.520 --> 00:26.920]  I don't believe that.
[00:26.920 --> 00:32.120]  I want everybody to vote and everybody to help pick our next president.
[00:32.120 --> 00:36.200]  Obama in Oregon, where he's polling about 15 points ahead of Clinton, spending time
[00:36.200 --> 00:37.800]  today with senior citizens.
[00:37.800 --> 00:42.640]  John McCain has already said that he supports private accounts for Social Security, in his
[00:42.640 --> 00:46.360]  words along the lines that President Bush proposed.
[00:46.360 --> 00:51.560]  I believe that privatizing Social Security was a bad idea when George Bush proposed it.
[00:51.560 --> 00:53.080]  It's a bad idea today.
[00:53.080 --> 00:56.840]  John McCain taking the day off after his Saturday Night Live appearance last night.
[00:56.840 --> 01:01.760]  Osama bin Laden out with another audio tape, this time chastising Arab states that have
[01:01.760 --> 01:07.760]  made nice with Israel, calling on Muslims to end the Israeli isolation of Gaza and suggesting
[01:07.760 --> 01:11.600]  that can't be done without Muslims fighting with countries like Egypt.
[01:11.600 --> 01:14.760]  Well, Truby Lundberg is saying don't shoot the messenger.
[01:14.760 --> 01:19.040]  She just does the bi-weekly survey that tells you how much more of your money is getting
[01:19.040 --> 01:21.520]  sucked down the gasoline pump nozzle.
[01:21.520 --> 01:27.080]  After 17 cents at the pump in the past two weeks, regular grade is now 379.
[01:27.080 --> 01:32.400]  It is another all-time record high, including inflation adjusted, and there was probably
[01:32.400 --> 01:33.400]  more to come.
[01:33.400 --> 01:36.960]  A couple of glimmers of positive news on the supply side, though, with the Saudis deciding
[01:36.960 --> 01:39.840]  to pump a little more out of the ground in the congressional decision this week to stop
[01:39.840 --> 01:42.920]  filling the strategic petroleum reserve.
[01:42.920 --> 01:47.360]  Parts of southern Florida under a dense smoke advisory, firefighters battling several wildfires
[01:47.360 --> 01:49.680]  that have burned more than 60 square miles.
[01:49.680 --> 01:53.880]  You're listening to Fox News Radio, fair and balanced.
[01:53.880 --> 02:01.400]  News Radio 590 KLBJ, good afternoon, it's 4-0-2, I'm Sarah Hudaberg and talking Austin's
[02:01.400 --> 02:02.400]  news.
[02:02.400 --> 02:06.280]  The head of the Austin Fire Department says rising fuel costs are affecting his budget,
[02:06.280 --> 02:10.200]  but he's doing what he can to fight the high cost of gasoline and diesel fuel.
[02:10.200 --> 02:15.760]  Vehicles other than fire trucks were purchasing the Priuses, Ford Escape hybrids, that's made
[02:15.760 --> 02:18.160]  a big difference on that portion of our fleet.
[02:18.160 --> 02:22.240]  Head acting Chief Jim Evans says fire trucks and larger vehicles still run on diesel fuel
[02:22.240 --> 02:25.520]  and only get about 5 or 6 miles per gallon.
[02:25.520 --> 02:29.960]  The main lanes of I-35 South of Onion Creek get shut down late tonight.
[02:29.960 --> 02:35.240]  State highway crews need the room on the southbound lanes to set up overhead beams which will eventually
[02:35.240 --> 02:38.920]  become the 45 Southeast toll road as it merges with I-35.
[02:38.920 --> 02:44.800]  They'll take four nights and get them across the south side, and then sometime after Memorial
[02:44.800 --> 02:49.560]  Day we'll do the same thing on the northbound side where we bring them across half the interstate.
[02:49.560 --> 02:54.480]  Text us John Hurt says tonight's closure starts at 9 and only affects the main southbound
[02:54.480 --> 02:55.480]  lanes.
[02:55.480 --> 02:57.320]  Northbound I-35 will be open.
[02:57.320 --> 03:00.600]  Jared Allen News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[03:00.600 --> 03:06.200]  Tonight Austin joins communities in 119 countries in the 25th AIDS Candlelight Memorial Service.
[03:06.200 --> 03:10.000]  Eric Crabtree coordinator for the event in Austin says the numbers show the battle against
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.280]  HIV and AIDS is far from over.
[03:12.280 --> 03:18.720]  Over the last 25 years, 33 million people have died from this disease and there's an
[03:18.720 --> 03:24.120]  estimated about 30 million worldwide that are infected currently with the HIV disease.
[03:24.120 --> 03:28.280]  Crabtree says state and local officials will participate in tonight's service in downtown
[03:28.280 --> 03:29.280]  Austin.
[03:29.280 --> 03:31.440]  Now the KLBJ radar weather watch.
[03:31.440 --> 03:35.720]  It was certainly a nice Sunday, but the temperatures are rising and it's going to be a scorcher
[03:35.720 --> 03:37.200]  from Monday into Tuesday.
[03:37.200 --> 03:38.600]  Now for tonight we're good.
[03:38.600 --> 03:42.440]  We'll see clear skies with overnight lows dropping down in the mid-60s, mostly sunny
[03:42.440 --> 03:48.040]  again for your Monday, but how about this, high temperatures in the mid to upper 90s.
[03:48.040 --> 03:49.040]  Possibly a record breaker.
[03:49.040 --> 03:50.200]  We'll have to stay tuned for that.
[03:50.200 --> 03:53.360]  From the Weather Channel, I'm Aaron Williams, News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[03:53.360 --> 03:55.360]  KLBJ, it's 404.
[03:55.360 --> 03:57.720]  Do you need a handyman around the house?
[03:57.720 --> 04:01.280]  Hi, this is Bobby Jenkins with ABC Handyman Services.

[04:57.800 --> 05:05.360]  I remember our old country home, clean fresh air and flowers growing in the fields along
[05:05.360 --> 05:08.000]  the path, beside our swimming...
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.600]  Hey man, can you...
[05:09.600 --> 05:11.680]  Mama hollering through the screen...
[05:11.680 --> 05:12.680]  Put your headphones on.
[05:12.680 --> 05:13.680]  It's like...
[05:13.680 --> 05:14.680]  Put your headphones on.
[05:14.680 --> 05:17.400]  I made ice cream that was such a simpler time...
[05:17.400 --> 05:18.400]  Can you hear me now?
[05:18.400 --> 05:19.400]  I can't...
[05:19.400 --> 05:20.400]  You can't hear me at all.
[05:20.400 --> 05:24.280]  Bluebell tastes just like the good old days.
[05:24.280 --> 05:26.160]  Southern hospitality.
[05:26.160 --> 05:30.520]  Our ice cream flavor contest winner is a vacation to the old south.
[05:30.520 --> 05:35.560]  Each homemade vanilla with chunks of pineapples, roasted pecans and a strawberry sauce swirled
[05:35.560 --> 05:36.560]  in.
[05:36.560 --> 05:38.720]  Pull up a chair on the veranda and enjoy.
[05:38.720 --> 05:39.720]  Here fair night.
[05:39.720 --> 05:47.080]  Bluebell tastes just like the good old days.

[06:22.840 --> 06:30.840]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[06:30.840 --> 06:36.400]  Hello my friends, thank you for joining us.
[06:36.400 --> 06:39.440]  It is Sunday the 18th day of May 2008.
[06:39.440 --> 06:43.160]  We're going to be here live for the next two hours.
[06:43.160 --> 06:49.880]  We're going to have open phones in this first hour and the second hour at 877-590-5525
[06:49.880 --> 06:54.800]  where you're listening to the main station that we syndicate out of, deep in the heart
[06:54.800 --> 06:55.800]  of Texas.
[06:55.800 --> 07:02.200]  News radio 590K OBJ, you can call 836-0590 and get on the air.
[07:02.200 --> 07:09.560]  My news websites, the largest and most effective of the alternative media websites out there,
[07:09.560 --> 07:14.080]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[07:14.080 --> 07:19.240]  You have found it, the front lines of the info war, the tip of the spear in the resistance
[07:19.240 --> 07:25.560]  against the global crime syndicate, the global eugenics syndicate known as the New World
[07:25.560 --> 07:28.040]  Order, un-affectionately.
[07:28.040 --> 07:32.880]  Okay, we have the founder and the head of the Human Extinctionist Society that wants
[07:32.880 --> 07:36.320]  all humans dead on the face of the earth.
[07:36.320 --> 07:42.440]  These views are the majority views at every major university in the world.
[07:42.440 --> 07:46.000]  You can go to events at the War Royal Society in England, you can go to events right here
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.840]  at Texas, UT events, St. Edward's events, and things like this are said and there are
[07:50.840 --> 07:57.600]  95% standing ovations when the total annihilation of all human life is discussed.
[07:57.600 --> 08:00.600]  It is a sick, dangerous death coat.
[08:00.600 --> 08:06.280]  They have their biologists working in all level four bio weapons laboratories towards
[08:06.280 --> 08:14.200]  the great goal of a mammal pox that will kill every human on earth.
[08:14.200 --> 08:19.040]  Now the group coming on later, they don't say that, they just say they want us to voluntarily
[08:19.040 --> 08:25.200]  not breed and for all humans to die, that humans are a diseased cancer and need to
[08:25.200 --> 08:27.040]  be gotten rid of.
[08:27.040 --> 08:28.440]  Now this is like dog training.
[08:28.440 --> 08:32.520]  The global elite have trained their little minions, their little biologists and scientists
[08:32.520 --> 08:33.800]  to have this view.
[08:33.800 --> 08:37.920]  The global elite have no intention of getting rid of themselves, they just intend to get
[08:37.920 --> 08:41.240]  rid of the mass of us and build the world in their image.
[08:41.240 --> 08:45.320]  Now I understand you're not going to see this on 24, you're not going to see it in the fiction
[08:45.320 --> 08:51.440]  or the other fiction that poses as nonfiction, Fox and CNN, but I assure you that when you
[08:51.440 --> 08:56.680]  actually study what the United Nations says, what Prince Philip, Ted Turner, Bill and Melinda
[08:56.680 --> 09:01.160]  Gates, Warren Buffett say when you find out where they give 90% of their money and what
[09:01.160 --> 09:06.880]  they're obsessed with and all they do and they volunteer and fly around the world constantly,
[09:06.880 --> 09:11.400]  working 17, 18 hours a day to get rid of 80% of us.
[09:11.400 --> 09:12.760]  Now they're conservative.
[09:12.760 --> 09:19.640]  The majority of the globalists want 90% extermination, but they're now being seen as old hat and
[09:19.640 --> 09:27.440]  a large minority want 99.9% extermination and a small but virulent minority want total
[09:27.440 --> 09:30.760]  homo sapien sapien extermination.
[09:30.760 --> 09:35.760]  Now I understand you didn't hear about that during Super Bowl halftime, I understand,
[09:35.760 --> 09:40.280]  but if you will actually research the claims I'm making that affect every one of you, you
[09:40.280 --> 09:47.400]  will find out this is deadly serious and I am telling you the truth right now.
[09:47.400 --> 09:51.200]  It's the type of knowledge that keeps you awake late at night.
[09:51.200 --> 09:55.520]  It's the type of knowledge that upsets you and makes you scream and yell, but I'll attempt
[09:55.520 --> 09:57.720]  to be calm today focused.
[09:57.720 --> 10:03.040]  I'm normally a very calm person, except when I get on air and then I get agitated because
[10:03.040 --> 10:06.400]  there's so much information I want to cover and I never can.
[10:06.400 --> 10:08.200]  Here's one stack.
[10:08.200 --> 10:15.520]  This is the anti-terror stack today, which means anti-freedom stack.
[10:15.520 --> 10:16.800]  Human enslavement stack.
[10:16.800 --> 10:20.960]  Here is the police state stack.
[10:20.960 --> 10:23.840]  Each one of these is about inch and a half, two inches thick.
[10:23.840 --> 10:35.680]  Here is the financial stack and here is the human extinction anti-human stack.
[10:35.680 --> 10:39.720]  The leader just actually conditioning the public, preparing us for our deaths, preparing
[10:39.720 --> 10:44.840]  us for our cancer deaths, preparing us for our bioweapons deaths, making it very sweet
[10:44.840 --> 10:48.000]  and oh, it's time for you to die, it's for the earth.
[10:48.000 --> 10:49.160]  I got news for you.
[10:49.160 --> 10:51.560]  How about you walk the plank first, New World Order?
[10:51.560 --> 10:58.240]  Oh, but you're the experts that have to oversee the great work and so you can't do that.
[10:58.240 --> 11:04.240]  Besides Mr. Jones, you've seen how you talk about these serious issues and the slaves,
[11:04.240 --> 11:11.240]  the profane, the cattle don't care, proof that they need to die, Mr. Jones.
[11:11.240 --> 11:15.640]  You tell them every day, but you notice they don't listen.
[11:15.640 --> 11:19.720]  Oh, Mr. Jones, they're not listening.
[11:19.720 --> 11:23.760]  Look at them take their shots.
[11:23.760 --> 11:24.760]  Look at them.
[11:24.760 --> 11:30.200]  They're like children and like children, they will die.
[11:30.200 --> 11:33.840]  So you're tuning in for the first time, you're like, what is this guy talking about?
[11:33.840 --> 11:40.800]  Well, you better find out in real fast what I'm talking about.
[11:40.800 --> 11:46.760]  Oh, man.
[11:46.760 --> 11:49.880]  You see, there are global managers.
[11:49.880 --> 11:55.520]  There are people that run our societies, they're individuals that govern our societies and
[11:55.520 --> 12:01.120]  whereas the people in the past decades and centuries had some input and impact on their
[12:01.120 --> 12:07.560]  surroundings and society, more and more we do not and a elite class of technocrats for
[12:07.560 --> 12:14.080]  the last 50 years and accelerating and expanding their control almost have complete control
[12:14.080 --> 12:19.640]  over human thought, technological development and more and more we are living in what you
[12:19.640 --> 12:24.040]  could call a three dimensional matrix like reality.
[12:24.040 --> 12:29.520]  By that we are not in a physical matrix, but our minds have been mapped, programmed,
[12:29.520 --> 12:37.480]  propagandized to the point of which they are electrochemical computers, organic computers
[12:37.480 --> 12:41.840]  that we have been programmed.
[12:41.840 --> 12:45.680]  You understand the elite don't care about shiny Mercedes, the elite don't care about
[12:45.680 --> 12:51.400]  acting cool, they don't care about Hollywood stars, they don't care about big mansions.
[12:51.400 --> 12:53.560]  That's all false spectrum reality.
[12:53.560 --> 12:57.440]  They control the real issuance of currency liquidity.
[12:57.440 --> 12:59.960]  They own the world over 100 times.
[12:59.960 --> 13:04.640]  They have created a debt system so they can implode the middle class and get control
[13:04.640 --> 13:10.280]  of you and sees all real assets in the third dimension, the plane that we live on on this
[13:10.280 --> 13:12.240]  planet.
[13:12.240 --> 13:16.360]  They are very close to having that and now through the fake environmental revolution
[13:16.360 --> 13:21.440]  through the global taxes, through the ozone action day and air quality days, they are
[13:21.440 --> 13:26.880]  going to squeeze you, tax you, control you, what size your toilet can be, what size light
[13:26.880 --> 13:27.880]  bulb you can have.
[13:27.880 --> 13:31.080]  Now it's your house is going to be remote controlled, they are going to control your
[13:31.080 --> 13:35.440]  thermostats, they are going to control how much you eat, they are going to have CPS workers
[13:35.440 --> 13:40.040]  talk to your children at school weekly, everything will be a prism.
[13:40.040 --> 13:45.160]  Now bring us into the one-child policy, now bring us into the anti-terror so they can
[13:45.160 --> 13:50.920]  get us into compact controlled cities so they can stage the bioweapon releases, always claiming
[13:50.920 --> 13:56.000]  terrorists did it, then locking down even greater control in the laboratory as they
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.760]  kill more and more of us in successive waves.
[13:58.760 --> 14:00.880]  This is the future unless we stop them.
[14:00.880 --> 14:04.680]  It's all in their policy reports, it's all in their documents, it's what they plan to
[14:04.680 --> 14:09.520]  do to us.
[14:09.520 --> 14:13.000]  I tell you what, let me just cover police state news first and then I'll get into all

[21:07.560 --> 21:11.480]  mean the average cop or the average social worker or the average person working in a
[21:11.480 --> 21:16.040]  statistics bureau is bad, no, it's compartmentalized, that's what the new world order system is
[21:16.040 --> 21:21.320]  a pyramid, this is just the police state news from the last two days, some of it, listen
[21:21.320 --> 21:28.160]  to it, what happened is I mentioned friday on my weekday radio show that since about
[21:28.160 --> 21:34.280]  seven years ago in Tucson and places like that, the police you pull up to random checkpoints
[21:34.280 --> 21:38.160]  and they're there and they stick needles in your arm and take blood because quote the
[21:38.160 --> 21:42.920]  prosecutors have said, well even if we force you to do a breathalyzer, it doesn't always
[21:42.920 --> 21:47.640]  hold up in court, so now we take blood, so intrusive, crossing those boundaries, I mean
[21:47.640 --> 21:51.280]  can you imagine Nazi Germany and the old black and white movies if the Nazis were on
[21:51.280 --> 21:56.360]  the train sucking blood, they've always got a good excuse though, I mean that's a major
[21:56.360 --> 22:00.720]  in your space, major violation of the fourth amendment, but now they're doing that under
[22:00.720 --> 22:05.320]  federal grants everywhere, they're doing it in Texas, you name it, and so I mentioned
[22:05.320 --> 22:09.840]  it and some people didn't believe me on air and then others emailed me just literally,
[22:09.840 --> 22:16.320]  I quit counting 30, 40, 50 different news articles from around the country where they
[22:16.320 --> 22:20.640]  just stop you and suck your blood now and I'm sorry, the cops pulled me over and want
[22:20.640 --> 22:24.200]  my blood, it didn't happen and I guess that's the end of my life because they'll just gun
[22:24.200 --> 22:28.560]  me down right there, taser me till I die and that's all part of freedom, guys in black
[22:28.560 --> 22:32.520]  mask, that's another thing, a few weeks ago the big police chief there in one of the suburbs
[22:32.520 --> 22:36.840]  of Boston said, yeah, we wear black uniforms to intimidate you, I have video of the Chicago
[22:36.840 --> 22:40.520]  police chief saying, yeah, we want to intimidate you, we're going to make all our officers
[22:40.520 --> 22:45.280]  basically SWAT team now to wear black uniforms and run around, of course they disarmed the
[22:45.280 --> 22:50.480]  people so the crime rates exploded and I was looking at the police chief and he just looked
[22:50.480 --> 22:56.960]  like something out of a comic book, he was so evil and I know that the mob boss son runs
[22:56.960 --> 23:01.680]  Chicago and I mean you can't make this stuff up and I know they shake bars and restaurants
[23:01.680 --> 23:05.680]  there down and beat up whoever they want and they're so corrupt it's off the charts and
[23:05.680 --> 23:10.640]  I know every major city, I can give you hundreds of cases like Dallas pulling cars over randomly
[23:10.640 --> 23:16.640]  throwing bags of chalk in them, taking them for themselves, again the system is bankrupt
[23:16.640 --> 23:21.240]  and if we don't let the general public know that the system is bankrupt and totally corrupt
[23:21.240 --> 23:25.320]  and can't be trusted as all fraud and lies, they're going to get their next phases of
[23:25.320 --> 23:30.560]  corruption and believe me folks, you don't want to see that.
[23:30.560 --> 23:35.120]  So here's one article and I just blew three minutes on it, I literally have like 200 stories
[23:35.120 --> 23:40.720]  here I want to tell you about and it says county to force DUI suspects to give blood,
[23:40.720 --> 23:45.200]  take breath tests and it just says we now quote have the authority and then I actually
[23:45.200 --> 23:48.680]  went and looked and there was state lawyers and people saying this is illegal and there
[23:48.680 --> 23:52.520]  isn't a law but is there a law you got to take vaccines, well they still announce it's
[23:52.520 --> 23:56.440]  the law on every local news station and people line up thinking it's the law they got to
[23:56.440 --> 24:00.320]  take it or their kids get taken, there's no law, it's all hoax government, that's what
[24:00.320 --> 24:05.000]  I'm saying the government's totally criminal, I'll bet anybody $10,000 there's no law you
[24:05.000 --> 24:10.840]  got to take vaccines, unless you're in the military and then it's not even a law, you
[24:10.840 --> 24:16.160]  just signed your rights over in a contract but the public thinks there is, it's all hoax,
[24:16.160 --> 24:22.080]  it's all fraud but now they want your blood on the side of the road, I mean they draw
[24:22.080 --> 24:29.040]  a nice portion of it too, look at this speeders under Florida law face vehicle confiscation
[24:29.040 --> 24:33.000]  and I have the bill here, I couldn't believe it so I went and pulled up the bill, Florida
[24:33.000 --> 24:40.960]  bill H.B.137, just type Florida bill H.B.137 into Google it'll pop up and you can go read
[24:40.960 --> 24:45.280]  it for yourself, speeders under Florida law face vehicle confiscation five to ten years
[24:45.280 --> 24:52.800]  in prison and it says, but don't worry the first time it's only a $5,000 fine and one
[24:52.800 --> 24:58.440]  month in jail but then the next time it's five years and $20,000 it goes on but I never
[24:58.440 --> 25:02.040]  thought I'd get a 30 mile up of the speed limit but one time I was driving to Crawford
[25:02.040 --> 25:08.880]  to cover a story, some little town out there, driving down a farm road, major road and it
[25:08.880 --> 25:12.880]  says 60 and I got it on cruise control at 60 and that town put a speed trap in because
[25:12.880 --> 25:17.880]  down another road is a school quarter mile or something and just for a few hundred yards
[25:17.880 --> 25:23.800]  it says 30, boom he pulled me over, he said oh I'm a fan of the show, I'm giving you a
[25:23.800 --> 25:31.320]  ticket, I said thank you very much and point is ten years in prison and just last week
[25:31.320 --> 25:36.000]  I saw news articles with the private prisons, they're building more, we're 5% of the world
[25:36.000 --> 25:42.920]  population but we got 35% of the world's population in prison, we're 5% of the world's population
[25:42.920 --> 25:47.360]  but we got 35% of the people in prison in the world and growing and that's the biggest
[25:47.360 --> 25:51.920]  part of our economy now and the private drug cartels that own the private banks literally
[25:51.920 --> 25:55.560]  there's been reports of this own the prisons, you gotta love it when the drug dealers own
[25:55.560 --> 26:01.480]  the prisons but that's what all these big drug war on the borders about, the CIA sent
[26:01.480 --> 26:07.120]  in Los Zetas trained US military forces, they're wiping them out down there so the US government
[26:07.120 --> 26:12.920]  gets 100% not just 85% of the cartel money and of course I told you that three years
[26:12.920 --> 26:18.160]  ago it's mainstream news today, if you have time I'll go over that for you but oh yeah
[26:18.160 --> 26:23.400]  the country's real far gone folks, real bad, real hardcore mafia runs things with a bunch
[26:23.400 --> 26:28.640]  of eugenicists above them so you don't know what eugenicists are, you better find out
[26:28.640 --> 26:36.440]  fast, better find out real fast but yes, speeders under Florida law face vehicle confiscation
[26:36.440 --> 26:42.160]  five to ten year prison and the private prisons are lobbying all over the country that oh
[26:42.160 --> 26:46.680]  we need more people in prison so we need you to have maximum laws against the general
[26:46.680 --> 26:51.800]  public for hard prison time, oh you missed class three times, that's five years in prison,
[26:51.800 --> 26:59.520]  oh you dropped the banana peel, that's a year in prison, oh you on and on and on, speeders
[26:59.520 --> 27:05.200]  under Florida law face vehicle confiscation five to ten year prison term, homeland security
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.080]  trained cops to combat roadside bombs and AP reported that they are, now I remember
[27:10.080 --> 27:14.360]  in 1998 we got secret documents because the FBI accidentally gave them to us, they run
[27:14.360 --> 27:18.240]  a checkpoint in Belton, it's in my film police state do the takeover, watch it free on Google
[27:18.240 --> 27:24.080]  video or get the dvd at fowars.com and just got the documents right there and there's
[27:24.080 --> 27:28.640]  military has citizens pulled over, Mike Hansen's driving along, my camera guy stops, they run
[27:28.640 --> 27:32.320]  over and say you can't videotape and the FBI pulls up and says get out of here, here's
[27:32.320 --> 27:38.920]  a press release, it was a press release stapled on top of documents marked secret, what an
[27:38.920 --> 27:45.080]  idiot, but said under the cover of bomb disposal we're taking over, we're in 77 Texas counties,
[27:45.080 --> 27:49.680]  we're doing warrants service, SWAT team raids, it's all illegal, don't tell anybody, but
[27:49.680 --> 27:56.240]  now they've removed it, see it's all retroactive, quiet, see the bankers that own our military
[27:56.240 --> 27:59.760]  took over the rest of the world, you think they're going to leave the prize alone, the
[27:59.760 --> 28:06.960]  US, they always take over, they always take over, that's what happened in Rome, it's what
[28:06.960 --> 28:14.720]  happens in Latin America and Russia and China, it's happening here, that's why they got
[28:14.720 --> 28:21.200]  microwave guns and nerve gas helicopters waiting in every major city and sound cannons because
[28:21.200 --> 28:25.800]  when they take your pension funds, your bank accounts and everything you got and when you're
[28:25.800 --> 28:29.920]  finally not worried about your favorite football team and you're riding in the streets, they're
[28:29.920 --> 28:34.960]  going to gun you down, at least that's what they trained for, I got video of it, the question
[28:34.960 --> 28:39.240]  is can we wake the public up, the military, the police up before it's too late, I'm going
[28:39.240 --> 28:43.560]  to come back, take a bunch of calls, then get into eugenics, then get into the economy

[33:07.200 --> 33:13.320]  I just talked to We Are Changed Kentucky, those are our roving reporters that ask politicians
[33:13.320 --> 33:19.400]  and minions of the new owner's serious questions, I'm going to have them pop in later, guess
[33:19.400 --> 33:23.400]  what happened, they went today, asked Oliver North politely about continuity of government,
[33:23.400 --> 33:28.360]  he'd been in Senate hearings in 1986 about how he was planning martial law takeovers,
[33:28.360 --> 33:33.000]  that was in the newspapers, the police handcuffed them, private security that looked like secret
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.280]  service, erased their cameras, stole their batteries and then thrown out on the street,
[33:38.280 --> 33:47.440]  that's your free country, baby, not going to ask about those FEMA camps, boy, oh, this
[33:47.440 --> 33:52.960]  country's far gone, that's it, I'm going to find out next place North is on his book
[33:52.960 --> 33:58.640]  term and I'm flying there, and I tell you what, I mean, I'm going to sue those jack
[33:58.640 --> 34:03.440]  boots up one side and down the other when they put their dirty paws on me, this country
[34:03.440 --> 34:07.320]  isn't as free as you thought it is, you better raise your voice right now, because they're
[34:07.320 --> 34:14.680]  trying to intimidate everybody to shut up so they can have their way, I tell you how
[34:14.680 --> 34:20.040]  mad it makes me, when these goons violate our first amendment and treat us like we're
[34:20.040 --> 34:24.600]  third world slaves, but this is communist Russia, while they wrap themselves in the
[34:24.600 --> 34:31.800]  American flag, republicans, democrats, they all work with the same new world order system,
[34:31.800 --> 34:35.680]  I mean, look at this news, speeders face 10 years in prison, homeland security trained
[34:35.680 --> 34:39.920]  cops to combat roadside bombs, that's all for martial law training, that's their cover
[34:39.920 --> 34:45.680]  to take over, 9-11 operator, I don't give a bleep what happens to you, Penoa police
[34:45.680 --> 34:49.440]  checkpoint angers residents, this is out of the daily bulletin, and it's, it looks like
[34:49.440 --> 34:52.920]  Nazi Germany, they're all in black uniforms pulling people out of cars, searching everything
[34:52.920 --> 34:57.320]  randomly, the new documentary draws stark parallels between Chile, under Pinochet and
[34:57.320 --> 35:03.400]  the 9-11 post-war on terror, absolutely, concerns over Posse commentatus violations, big article
[35:03.400 --> 35:06.880]  about how the military is taking over the U.S., how they're all felons and criminals
[35:06.880 --> 35:10.640]  now they're hiring, oh you didn't know that, yeah, it's not Audie Murphy's military anymore,
[35:10.640 --> 35:16.880]  Pentagon officers and gallery at house on debates with Iraq spending bill, TSA to install
[35:16.880 --> 35:21.400]  200 more body scanners, that again, give a total color image of your neck and body and
[35:21.400 --> 35:25.160]  federal records, gonna walk you, your little kids through it, everything, that's the
[35:25.160 --> 35:31.360]  feds, total humiliation, high tech face recognition cameras, gonna be installed in the U.S. and
[35:31.360 --> 35:35.800]  in England to quote, make sure your face scanned off your driver's license to make sure you're
[35:35.800 --> 35:39.680]  not buying beer or cigarettes, see the local people can't do that or the person behind
[35:39.680 --> 35:44.160]  the clerk, you know, they can't do it, but that's really for buying and selling, that's
[35:44.160 --> 35:49.920]  just going in the casual society grid, in body sensors to warn doctors of health problems
[35:49.920 --> 35:53.840]  electronically, electrically charged riot shields to be used against the people, taser
[35:53.840 --> 36:00.280]  shields, when they touch you it zaps you, cops to implement in your face policing, on and
[36:00.280 --> 36:02.760]  on and on.
[36:02.760 --> 36:08.560]  On the economy, no one will say why gas is exploding and why major banks are talking
[36:08.560 --> 36:13.320]  about gas going up and brokerage firms the $200 a barrel, it's because the dollar is
[36:13.320 --> 36:26.040]  being devalued, not all the other cockamamie reasons that they give, just unbelievable.
[36:26.040 --> 36:32.600]  The dollar falls most against Euro in seven weeks on sentiment, this is Bloomberg, so
[36:32.600 --> 36:37.000]  the dollar continues to plunge to all time highs, that's what's happening, that's what's
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.160]  affecting everything, oil pushes above $127 a barrel and holds there, globalists take
[36:43.160 --> 36:48.640]  steps for $200 a barrel oil, the total raping of you, the people, and again, it's not the
[36:48.640 --> 36:54.080]  oil companies that are even doing it, they're certainly part and parcel, that's a red herring,
[36:54.080 --> 36:58.320]  it's the dollar plunging, so when you hear that the oil companies are making their 9%
[36:58.320 --> 37:04.640]  profit, like they always are, that's true, it's the dollar, U.S. heading for double digit
[37:04.640 --> 37:09.800]  inflation, Bank of England warns no more rate cuts before 2010 as credit crisis deepens,
[37:09.800 --> 37:15.480]  U.S. trained forces reportedly helping Mexican cartels, Houston Chronicle, drug cartel carnage
[37:15.480 --> 37:20.560]  tears Mexico apart, bleeds into Texas, Congressman highlights Mexican commando incursions in
[37:20.560 --> 37:25.600]  the U.S., murders as far north as Dallas, we told you this three years ago, just go
[37:25.600 --> 37:29.400]  to the present planet, I'm tooting my horn, you always hear it here first, people couldn't
[37:29.400 --> 37:35.440]  believe me, violence in Mexico again spills across into Texas, programs from government
[37:35.440 --> 37:41.400]  claims are aimed at foreign enemies are being used against American citizens, Congressman
[37:41.400 --> 37:45.960]  highlights Mexican commando incursions in the U.S. urge action of U.S. trained Mexican
[37:45.960 --> 37:50.800]  security personnel carrying out cartel killings, well that's for the CIA, they're killing their
[37:50.800 --> 37:55.400]  competition, told you that three years ago, we only had DEA agents and people retired
[37:55.400 --> 38:00.400]  on to tell you about it, training down there in south Texas, and they're using Latin American
[38:00.400 --> 38:06.360]  death squads training the 80s by north and others to now take over in Iraq, 10,000 death
[38:06.360 --> 38:14.880]  commanders, death squad leaders, yeah, let me tell you where Oliver North's going to
[38:14.880 --> 38:19.920]  be next, we need to get 50 people out of these events with video cameras, so his private
[38:19.920 --> 38:26.320]  security goons and other people, I mean you're just asking about the martial law drills
[38:26.320 --> 38:34.320]  he did, and this guy's the opposite of a conservative, okay, Saturday, May 24th, 6 p.m. cornerstone
[38:34.320 --> 38:42.400]  church, 726 West Old Hickory Boulevard, Madison, Tennessee, Sunday, May 25th, 8 p.m., he thinks
[38:42.400 --> 38:47.120]  this is Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, where they could just kill the people, shoot
[38:47.120 --> 38:51.680]  them in the back of the head and throw the whole families in shallow graves, as U.S.
[38:51.680 --> 38:57.360]  trained death squads did, and North was heavily involved in over that entire program, this
[38:57.360 --> 39:01.360]  is the U.S., bubba, I can't, but you know what, go ahead and get those guys online, I
[39:01.360 --> 39:05.680]  want to talk to them next break, go ahead and call We Are Change Kentucky, who just
[39:05.680 --> 39:11.520]  went in and had their cameras stuff erased, their batteries taken, let's take some calls,
[39:11.520 --> 39:15.200]  somebody didn't like my movie, so we're going to go to them first, people that disagree,
[39:15.200 --> 39:19.360]  always go to the head of the line here, this isn't a staged broadcast, Malcolm says he has
[39:19.360 --> 39:23.440]  a complaint about my movie, which means he was one of only 200 and something people
[39:23.440 --> 39:26.960]  to see it at the Alamo Draft House downtown last time, I was going to one more time tonight,
[39:26.960 --> 39:31.360]  then it comes out on DVD, and so I'm going to hear how bad I am right now, go ahead Malcolm
[39:31.360 --> 39:38.080]  from Austin. Hi Alex, I like the movie, but my only complaint was I was hoping that something on
[39:38.080 --> 39:43.040]  Stephen Jones was in it, because I'm trying to prove 9-11 via Stephen Jones, and you didn't
[39:43.040 --> 39:48.880]  have anything on him in the movie. Well, I mean, I've made four films on 9-11, this is one about
[39:48.880 --> 39:59.520]  the 9-11 Truth movement, and so Stephen Jones is in Terror Storm. Yeah, and I liked his interview
[39:59.520 --> 40:05.120]  in Terror Storm and stuff, but I'm not really angry, I was just more hoping that you'd have
[40:05.120 --> 40:08.880]  something on hand. What did you think of the film overall? Oh, I liked it, it was great, it was a
[40:08.880 --> 40:14.640]  great tribute to all the people participating in the 9-11 Truth movement, I especially liked
[40:14.640 --> 40:22.160]  the parts about Lou Rogowski. But was it entertaining? Yes, absolutely, especially like the guy who
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.640]  went into Walmart and went on their main system. We'll see, we're doing something different here,
[40:28.640 --> 40:32.640]  and I appreciate your call, and I've made all these documentary style deals with all the
[40:32.640 --> 40:37.120]  documentation and this document and that document. Now I'm making this film and my next film,
[40:37.120 --> 40:41.840]  which is about JFK, case is now closed, I probably call it Black Sunshine or something,
[40:41.840 --> 40:44.560]  I'm not quite sure what the film's going to be, but it might be Black Sunshine,
[40:45.440 --> 40:50.560]  I'll tell you a while later. But the point is, is that I'm making Cinema Verite, I'm making two,
[40:50.560 --> 40:53.920]  showing people I can do it, okay? Okay, you got to do something different occasionally.
[40:54.480 --> 40:57.920]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Robert in Colorado, you're on the air.
[40:57.920 --> 41:03.120]  Alexander Emery Jones, thanks for taking my call, appreciate it. Thanks for calling, good sir.
[41:03.120 --> 41:07.920]  Good, I got two questions I'll make. Front page of today's Denver Post,
[41:09.360 --> 41:16.640]  two or three school systems are going to start random drug testing. I'm thinking
[41:16.640 --> 41:20.800]  that's an invasion of privacy and violation of Fourth Amendment, is it not without any
[41:20.800 --> 41:25.840]  probable cause? Absolutely, we'll see, first they habitualize and train the cattle through what they
[41:25.840 --> 41:31.760]  believe is common law or adverse possession. They're engaging in that also it's under admiralty,
[41:31.760 --> 41:35.680]  that's why we've been under martial law for decades since 1933, it's just what
[41:35.680 --> 41:40.080]  increment of martial law are we going to live under? And first it's if you're on the football
[41:40.080 --> 41:45.120]  team drug test, and then if it's in any extracurricular activity, then it's if you park your car,
[41:45.120 --> 41:49.440]  now they're just saying everybody gets drug tested, and of course they say that sounds good,
[41:49.440 --> 41:55.040]  but they ship the drugs in, meanwhile they push Ritalin and Prozac that are even worse than heroin
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.360]  and cocaine on the kids, and they've proven the dare program showing all the kids the drugs,
[41:59.360 --> 42:04.800]  makes them want to use it, that's just basic psychology, all this stuff has tripled the
[42:04.800 --> 42:10.240]  use of drugs. We have more people in prison, more people in drugs, more drugs being shipped in,
[42:10.240 --> 42:15.440]  it's just sick mind control, anything else? Yeah, you ever read a book called Forcing the Glory
[42:15.440 --> 42:23.760]  by Laurent Bennett? No. It's a book about Abraham Lincoln and him being the great emancipator,
[42:23.760 --> 42:29.120]  supposedly he's really the great Besser, but he really threw a lot of rocks, the author at Lincoln,
[42:29.120 --> 42:33.360]  I agree with Holland, didn't he free anyone, didn't want to free anyone, but he also threw rocks at
[42:33.360 --> 42:38.720]  the founding fathers, Thompson, George Washington at all, in that they signed the Declaration of
[42:38.720 --> 42:43.280]  Independence in the U.S. Constitution, but they also held slaves. So I guess my question in that
[42:43.280 --> 42:49.680]  context were the founding fathers really just two-faced people? Let me comment on when we get
[42:49.680 --> 42:56.880]  back, stay with us. Our beloved Republic is on her knees, the forces of globalism are destroying
[42:56.880 --> 43:01.840]  national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope. The first time in
[43:01.840 --> 43:06.400]  modern history, the people are beginning to wake up, it is essential that patriots worldwide
[43:06.400 --> 43:10.640]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short
[43:10.640 --> 43:15.360]  time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info War,

[43:53.600 --> 43:57.360]  Hi this is Alex Jones and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[43:57.360 --> 44:02.000]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[44:02.000 --> 44:07.360]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[44:07.360 --> 44:12.240]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a complete
[44:12.240 --> 44:18.240]  fuel system treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage and only one tank
[44:18.240 --> 44:23.440]  full. Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction but it extends the life of your engine.
[44:23.440 --> 44:28.320]  Let's face it with the high price of gasoline it's time to take action. Purchase a protective fuel
[44:28.320 --> 44:35.200]  system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[44:35.200 --> 44:44.640]  Call 8888 use SFR1 that number again is 8888 use SFR1 or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com
[44:44.640 --> 44:51.760]  that's oilcompanysecret.com. Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back and it's safe for all cars act now.
[44:53.440 --> 44:59.360]  Can a magnet relieve pain? Can a magnet kill bacteria? Can a magnet address your health concerns?
[44:59.360 --> 45:05.040]  Lion Legacy has the answer. Lion Legacy has been around for 17 years and has coined the phrase
[45:05.040 --> 45:09.760]  properly designed therapeutic magnets. Lion Legacy offers therapeutic magnets that are
[45:09.760 --> 45:14.320]  used by people all around the world with great success. These are not everyday magnets that
[45:14.320 --> 45:18.480]  are designed to hold a report card on the refrigerator. No these magnets are nothing like
[45:18.480 --> 45:23.600]  you've ever seen. What makes them different? What makes them unique? Well the poles are separated
[45:23.600 --> 45:28.320]  to deliver the healing energy of the North Pole and are large enough to deliver an effective
[45:28.320 --> 45:32.560]  force field. They're so durable that if you happen to drop them they won't lose their strength. There
[45:32.560 --> 45:37.360]  is nothing more natural and safe than magnetic therapy. Lion Legacy has developed a line of
[45:37.360 --> 45:41.840]  supplements that improve the effectiveness of the magnets even more. For more information visit

[46:52.000 --> 47:13.360]  All right, let me try to answer the last caller's question from Colorado without spending 10 hours
[47:13.360 --> 47:18.880]  on it. You have to look at the time people live. Slavery is still going on in Africa right now,
[47:18.880 --> 47:23.280]  black against black. Most of the slaves that came to this country were white, they were indentured
[47:23.280 --> 47:28.080]  servants, they didn't get out in seven years, they had it worse in many cases but that's politically
[47:28.080 --> 47:35.520]  incorrect but that's a mainline history. And so Thomas Jefferson actually by 1800 before he died
[47:35.520 --> 47:42.160]  released his slaves, okay his black slaves and of course had children with him. And so the institution
[47:42.160 --> 47:47.600]  was different depending on where you were and what area of the colonies. I mean we have forms of
[47:47.600 --> 47:53.440]  slavery going on worldwide right now and so it's really a red herring. It was the United States and
[47:53.440 --> 47:59.280]  other western nations England that initiated banning slavery worldwide. I mean in the Bible you
[47:59.280 --> 48:04.560]  read about you know part of the Jews being slaves to other Jews, you know bond servant. So it's
[48:04.560 --> 48:08.320]  really a history lesson and it's so shocking and been turned into a political tool today
[48:09.360 --> 48:14.400]  but you know I had ancestors that were indentured servants. Okay I want to go to
[48:14.400 --> 48:20.640]  Adam Cuttington with We Are Changed by Louisville, Kentucky. He was there with some 9-11 truth guys,
[48:20.640 --> 48:26.080]  they went to the NRA convention which we support but the NRA mainline is actually supporting gun
[48:26.080 --> 48:30.640]  control. You know the globalists are very powerful and they have ways of influencing people and I've
[48:30.640 --> 48:35.600]  had gunners of America and others on to expose the fact but I've interviewed Ted News, you know I've
[48:35.600 --> 48:40.480]  interviewed Oliver North and I'm going to interview Oliver North again. And Oliver North got this
[48:40.480 --> 48:45.200]  good rep as fightin' communist but it's really the opposite. The CIA Solicitor General did find
[48:45.200 --> 48:49.760]  there was CIA narcotics trafficking at the time and CIA trained death squads that he was over
[48:49.760 --> 48:55.600]  engaged in things that are unspeakable. And so there were the congressional hearings back in
[48:56.640 --> 49:04.400]  86. In fact type in Oliver North martial law into YouTube. They'll have clips from my film
[49:04.400 --> 49:13.120]  police state too, the takeover. Go to YouTube and type in Oliver North martial law and or no Oliver
[49:13.120 --> 49:19.920]  North camps, camps. And I want to play that. I mean I want you to hear Congressman Inouye telling
[49:19.920 --> 49:25.280]  Congressman Jack Brooks from Texas to shut up about it. So these young men went and they asked him
[49:25.280 --> 49:32.240]  about this so the police arrested them, handcuffed them, stole the videotapes out and the memory
[49:32.240 --> 49:37.360]  sticks and their batteries and gave their cameras back. That's what America is. And I talked to
[49:37.360 --> 49:41.360]  them during the break. They were cameras inside. It was the convention. They paid to get in.
[49:42.160 --> 49:48.160]  But this is the country. They just do what they want. And this is outrageous for bringing this up
[49:48.160 --> 49:52.240]  to Oliver North. I'm going to go ahead now and bring you up. Guys try to find it as quick as you
[49:52.240 --> 49:57.360]  can. I'm going to go ahead and bring up Adam Cuttington. Adam, tell people exactly what happened
[49:57.360 --> 50:03.280]  where you were. We're in Louisville, Kentucky. Today at the Kentucky Exposition Center,
[50:04.640 --> 50:08.560]  which is where Six Flags and the Freedom Hall is. By the way, you keep talking. I'm going to be
[50:08.560 --> 50:11.680]  listening to you on the speaker. I'm going to walk in the other room and make sure they find the
[50:11.680 --> 50:20.240]  right clip. Keep talking. Okay. And anyways, the NRA was hosting their 2008 National Convention
[50:20.240 --> 50:27.200]  in Louisville. We actually had obtained press passes into the event called the Public Affairs
[50:27.200 --> 50:36.800]  Office. We obtained NRA press passes. Anyway, so we had been covering it yesterday and wasn't
[50:36.800 --> 50:41.440]  able to really get anything. Today we found out that there was going to be a forum in Q&A with
[50:41.440 --> 50:51.200]  Oliver North, along with a book signing later, and a forum and a Q&A with Ted Nugent. We ended
[50:51.200 --> 50:57.840]  up going to, we went to the Oliver North thing, which was first and confronted him on continuity
[50:57.840 --> 51:05.120]  of government. Say that again. You confronted him on continuity of government. Yeah, we could
[51:05.120 --> 51:11.680]  front of him on, did he work on the continuity of government program, which he actually went into it
[51:11.680 --> 51:18.560]  a little bit, started talking about Rex 84, how it was a plan to get the president in a catastrophe
[51:18.560 --> 51:22.480]  out of a nuclear fallout area. That's just pretty much the only thing he said on it.
[51:23.120 --> 51:27.040]  I'll tell you what, let's go ahead and play what it was really about. This is the joint session,
[51:27.040 --> 51:32.320]  joint investigation of the House and Senate. One of the only ones we've had in decades.
[51:32.320 --> 51:38.960]  Iran Contra. Here is Congressman Jack Brooks from Texas, asking him about the concentration camps.
[51:38.960 --> 51:42.320]  Stay right there. I'm going to come right back to you in just a second, Adam.
[51:46.320 --> 51:50.080]  You're not assigned at one time to work on plans. Back it up a little. I want to hear
[51:50.080 --> 51:56.240]  Colonel North. I want to hear him say his name. You can just type Oliver North FEMA camps into
[51:56.240 --> 52:01.200]  Google and you can actually go watch hours of the full hearings. Okay, and now they admit it.
[52:01.200 --> 52:05.920]  They've trained. The military is trained. Take your children, take your guns, take you to camps,
[52:05.920 --> 52:10.160]  put you in forced labor camps. And I mean anybody they want. This is the criminal government. Go
[52:10.160 --> 52:17.680]  ahead and play it. Colonel North, in your work at the NSC, were you not assigned at one time to
[52:17.680 --> 52:23.360]  work on plans for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster? Mr. Chairman?
[52:23.360 --> 52:31.920]  I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area,
[52:32.720 --> 52:37.280]  so may I request that you not touch upon that, sir?
[52:38.640 --> 52:46.480]  I was particularly concerned, Mr. Chairman, because I read in Miami papers and several others
[52:46.480 --> 52:56.960]  that there had been a plan developed by that same agency, a contingency plan in the event
[52:56.960 --> 53:01.760]  of an emergency that would suspend the American Constitution. And I was deeply concerned about
[53:01.760 --> 53:09.440]  it. I'm wondering if that was the area in which he had worked? Yeah, I most respectfully request
[53:09.440 --> 53:15.680]  that that matter not be touched upon at this stage. If we wish to get into this on a certain
[53:15.680 --> 53:21.440]  time, arrangements can be made for an executive session. And tragically, the only member who
[53:21.440 --> 53:26.880]  got close was Jack Brooks, and he was stopped by the term. And that was Congressman Henry
[53:26.880 --> 53:33.120]  Bigin-Zollis right after talking about how they would stage a terror attack. He said that in 1990,
[53:33.120 --> 53:38.000]  he's dead now. He said there was a planned stage a terror attack and bring in martial law,
[53:38.000 --> 53:42.720]  but they decided the country's been so free to stage a couple of them to incrementally get
[53:42.720 --> 53:47.920]  you ready for it, and that's in the documents as well. That's right. Very friendly government
[53:47.920 --> 53:52.960]  we have. Now understand, now Congress and Homeland Security in Congress, the committee,
[53:52.960 --> 53:57.440]  co-equal of the president has asked to see the new plans, and they were told you're not allowed to,
[53:57.440 --> 54:00.720]  the president is a dictator, and they're going to pass that on to Obama or whoever.
[54:01.440 --> 54:05.840]  So let's go back to Adam. Adam, Cuttington, finish up with what happened to you. So you
[54:05.840 --> 54:09.120]  were talking to him about cotton new government. He was giving you a line of bull. Keep going.
[54:09.120 --> 54:14.960]  Okay. I just wanted to clear up, it was, we are changing Kentucky and we are changing Ohio. Cody
[54:14.960 --> 54:19.680]  Beats and a couple of guys from, we are changing Ohio came down to- Okay, fantastic. Tell us what
[54:19.680 --> 54:23.920]  happened, please. What happened is Cody was the one at the Mac asking about the continuity of
[54:23.920 --> 54:29.920]  government. Then, of course, he went over saying it was the president. Anyway, if any questioned him
[54:29.920 --> 54:38.000]  on building seven and would he support a new investigation of 9-11, he kind of said pompously
[54:38.000 --> 54:46.560]  investigate away. Yeah, there's nothing you're going to do slaves. After that, Sam, another guy
[54:46.560 --> 54:57.520]  from Ohio, went up just after the Q&A and questioned him on camp. I actually wasn't up at the front
[54:57.520 --> 55:01.600]  of the room at that time. I was in the back with Cody, so I didn't exactly get all that.
[55:01.600 --> 55:06.960]  Okay, but the key here is how they grabbed your cameras. Right, right. Later on after the
[55:06.960 --> 55:15.760]  interrogation, we went back to the book signing that Oliver North was doing and they were going
[55:15.760 --> 55:22.160]  to give him a DVD and some literature. Now, to be clear, this was open. Other people had cameras,
[55:22.160 --> 55:28.320]  other people were snapping pictures, videotaping. It was you guys. Go ahead. Right, right. And what
[55:28.320 --> 55:32.720]  we got was press was completely open to cover this event. No, I know. This is that you got to
[55:32.720 --> 55:39.520]  sue them, but keep going. By the way, we don't like suing people on wasting our money. The point
[55:39.520 --> 55:43.760]  is we're going to save the First Amendment listeners or it's over or they win. Go ahead.
[55:45.760 --> 55:52.880]  Anyways, when they got up to the desk with North, they were pulled off to the side by a couple
[55:53.520 --> 55:59.280]  non-uniform, Louis Vuitton Metro Police Department, a couple uniform Louis Vuitton Metro and what
[55:59.280 --> 56:06.640]  I'm guessing is private security. Just good. Gas and suits, yeah. Scum. Anyways, what happened
[56:06.640 --> 56:11.440]  next? I was across the hall actually getting footage from a different angle. When they were
[56:11.440 --> 56:17.520]  taken off to the side, they came over, brought me over, confiscated our NRA event press passes,
[56:18.240 --> 56:22.720]  told us that we needed to leave and couldn't come back if we came back, they'd arrested.
[56:22.720 --> 56:28.400]  So we proceeded to leave. Sam, which was walking behind me,
[56:30.960 --> 56:36.480]  I didn't exactly sue them, but took out his camera, mess with his camera, did something,
[56:36.480 --> 56:43.760]  and was taken to the ground by a non-uniform officer. So that's America. So assaulted
[56:43.760 --> 56:50.000]  for touching his camera, attack dogs, trained to attack cameras, trained to attack press. This is
[56:50.000 --> 56:56.080]  one inch from total martial law, third world armpit. Oh my God, this is huge news. Okay,
[56:56.080 --> 57:02.240]  tell me the exact name. I know his name is Sam. Okay, we need to talk to him. Is he still with
[57:02.240 --> 57:08.400]  you? No, no, no. They were heading back up to Ohio after the event. Okay, so Ohio, we are changed,
[57:08.400 --> 57:14.560]  is tackled by a, oh my God, oh my God, in America, folks. Okay, he's tackled by a demon.
[57:14.560 --> 57:22.000]  He's handcuffed. Keep going. And handcuffed. He was put in handcuffed. Oh my God. He was put up
[57:22.000 --> 57:28.080]  against the wall, what looked like a face first when we got outside, and then Cody tried documenting
[57:28.080 --> 57:33.280]  what was going on with him, with his camera, and was rushed himself. He was not going down,
[57:33.280 --> 57:36.720]  but he was grabbed. Stay there. Stay there. I got to come back to you. Then we'll have the human
[57:36.720 --> 57:42.720]  extinctionist person on. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not America. Your veterans fought and
[57:42.720 --> 57:47.600]  died for it. It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like

[58:43.200 --> 58:47.680]  The election cycle draws near, and we don't have much time left. If the American people
[58:47.680 --> 58:52.160]  truly hope to make a change in Washington, then we must act now with a cohesive plan for taking
[58:52.160 --> 58:56.800]  back our government. Washington You Fired is a new patriotic documentary from the director
[58:56.800 --> 59:01.920]  Beyond Treason. The video is the result of a two-year endeavor to assemble a video tool for
[59:01.920 --> 59:06.480]  engaging, educating, and motivating the American people to climb back into the driver's seat of
[59:06.480 --> 59:11.520]  Congress. Washington You Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror-related
[59:11.520 --> 59:16.240]  spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before. The resulting shift in our
[59:16.240 --> 59:20.640]  governmental power structure leaves the American people with only two choices, be a part of the
[59:20.640 --> 59:25.920]  problem or be a part of the solution. Washington You Fired is being described as the best patriotic
[59:25.920 --> 59:30.720]  video since freedom to fascism, and we want you to get a copy and share it with your friends.
[59:30.720 --> 59:36.160]  We invite you to make the change. Help take back our government now. Go to takebackwashington.com
[59:36.160 --> 59:40.480]  and get the tools you need for the information war. We have a plan to take back our government.

[59:53.440 --> 59:57.840]  U.N.
[59:57.840 --> 1:00:02.560]  Envoy is in Myanmar to plead with Ajanta to accept more international aid for its
[1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:08.160]  cyclone survivors. Here's Choislin Gecker. We still don't know any details about his trip.
[1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:14.560]  The U.N. says that they don't know yet who he's meeting with. They don't know any details about
[1:00:14.560 --> 1:00:20.000]  his itinerary and they don't know how long he's going to be staying. So in terms of a breakthrough,
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:24.560]  I don't think anybody knows yet. An efforts near the epicenter of a recent earthquake in China
[1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:29.440]  appeared to have shifted from searching for buried survivors to clearing corpses from shattered
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:34.800]  buildings. Anstrodis Innis with the World Health Organization. There is a long list of essential

[1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:02.400]  my mind was so worn out, I could not sleep at night. I felt self-conscious, nobody knows what
[1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:06.240]  that flaking is. And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty. All the people know
[1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:10.000]  and I have this embarrassing. Of course I felt self-conscious, not very attractive to look at.

[1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:55.760]  President Bush is calling on the Arab world to isolate state sponsors of terror and give
[1:01:55.760 --> 1:02:01.680]  citizens more freedoms. Speaking today at the World Economic Forum on the Middle East in Egypt,
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:06.800]  Bush asked that countries treat their people with the dignity and respect they deserve.
[1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:11.280]  You should have a strong voice in leading your countries. And my nation looks to the day when
[1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:15.520]  you have the rights and privileges you deserve. And doctors in Boston are working to determine
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:21.280]  the cause of a seizure that sent Senator Ted Kennedy to the hospital yesterday. A top aide says
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:26.960]  Kennedy spent a peaceful night at Massachusetts General Hospital. More details on his condition
[1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:33.360]  are expected by tomorrow at the earliest after a number of tests are completed. CQ Weekly editor
[1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:39.520]  David Hawking says Kennedy's presence on Capitol Hill has shaped American politics. He's just
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:44.720]  been enormously influential for decades. Without Ted Kennedy, the Senate would be a very, very
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:49.680]  different place. For more news and analysis, log on to irnnews.com.

[1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:28.960]  Democrats pick a nominee and isn't afraid to joke about it either. Appearing on Saturday Night Live,
[1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:33.760]  McCain quipped that it would be crazy exciting if Democrats were to finish their national
[1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:38.800]  convention without having a presidential nominee in place. He also said controlling government
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:43.280]  spending isn't just about Republicans or Democrats. It's about being able to look your
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:51.200]  children in the eye. In my case, my children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, great,
[1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:57.360]  great grandchildren, and great, great, great grandchildren, the youngest of whom are nearing
[1:03:57.360 --> 1:04:03.520]  retirement. Three of the five Northern Illinois University students shot dead during a campus
[1:04:03.520 --> 1:04:09.280]  rampage in February have been awarded post-onimus degrees. The degree for 20-year-old Gail
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:14.560]  Dubowski was among the first to be handed out at the commencement ceremonies. Joe Dubowski
[1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:20.160]  is Gail's father. There's still a lot of planning and brainstorming going on over the permanent
[1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:25.360]  memorial, you know, people coming up with different ideas and prioritizing. And the NAACP has picked
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:31.600]  former news executive Ben Jealous as its president. At 35, he's the youngest leader in the 99-year
[1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:36.560]  history of the nation's largest civil rights organization. This is interim president Dennis
[1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:42.880]  Cordland Hayes. I am very confident that he has the ability to do it and we've got a strong working
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:48.080]  staff and board ready to step up and help him to get it done. I'm Jody Jordan and that's news from

[1:06:25.200 --> 1:06:29.600]  Brenton, Seattle, Kelly in Las Vegas, Allen in Virginia, Aaron in
[1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:36.880]  Missoula. Many others. Your calls are coming up. I got two guests we're gonna have on right now
[1:06:36.880 --> 1:06:43.600]  finishing up with Adam Cuttington. We are change. Y'all said we'll change Ohio there. There we are
[1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:48.880]  change Kentucky. Went to the NRA meeting, public meeting, had press passes, brought up continuity
[1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:53.840]  of government. We just play congressional hearings about it. We're polite to him. We're nice about
[1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:59.200]  it. And the police tackled one of the guys, grabbed their other cameras, took them outside,
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:03.920]  stole the tapes, the memory sticks, the batteries and gave them the cameras back. And they're lucky
[1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:09.520]  they didn't plant bombs on them. In my new film, Truth Rising, we have the police and other
[1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:16.960]  same cameras or bombs and guns. And thank God we were able to get footage of that out to everybody.
[1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:24.160]  It's folks when the major Dallas police department and it was Dallas policy. I mean the crime lab
[1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:27.840]  went along with it too. They would just pull over nice cars and drop bags of chalk in the back.
[1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:32.320]  I mean, it's far gone, folks. I want you to know the government is completely criminal.
[1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:38.480]  Okay. And then we're going to, last night, the founder of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement,
[1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:43.920]  you can't make this stuff up either. You see, I'm aware of the real paradigm. I study reality,
[1:07:43.920 --> 1:07:48.240]  what's really happening, what movers and shakers really think are really doing. Wait here,
[1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:51.440]  this guy, and I appreciate him coming on. When we called him, he goes, oh yes, we were already
[1:07:51.440 --> 1:07:55.840]  notified by our Austin members that you had talked about it. We were expecting your call.
[1:07:55.840 --> 1:08:00.720]  And I believe it. I mean, I mean, you know, I've been to these UT functions where they say get rid
[1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:06.000]  of 90% of us in their standing ovations of people crying, going, yes, with giant skulls projected
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:11.600]  on the wall. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. And the general idiot public has no idea,
[1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:16.320]  which I guess feeds into the social Darwinist view of, we'll see they're scum. They need to be
[1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:21.680]  dealt with. But he's a nice guy though. He wants it to be voluntary. We'll go to him in just a
[1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:26.000]  minute. So they're on the friendly side. They just want you to die of your own accord, not have
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:31.280]  children, instead of what most of the eugenicists who have different views than his are pushing.
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:36.800]  I'm not saying he's a eugenicist. I'm saying most of those that have these views are hyper eugenicists
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:40.720]  that only the creme de la creme can live. He's different. He's not a eugenicist. He says, I guess,
[1:08:41.360 --> 1:08:44.720]  all humans need to disappear off the planet. So that's coming up in a moment. Actually, a very
[1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:50.880]  popular view, by the way, they just are most of a very quiet about it as they are in power positions.
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:56.000]  Adam Cuttington, you just recap everything that happened and then tell us about him stealing your
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:01.840]  stuff. Recap, question all over north on the continuity of government in 9-11,
[1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:10.160]  and camps, camps in America, question Ted Dungeant on whether he supported a new investigation.
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:21.520]  When we were walking outside, once we got outside and a thing was put up against the wall,
[1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:29.200]  Cody, pretending on his camera to document what was going on, and was rushed himself.
[1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:32.880]  Now, did they knock him down and slam his head in the wall, or were they nice?
[1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:36.640]  He was not knocked down. He was grabbed by two officers, but he was not knocked down.
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:40.880]  Well, the other guy was assaulted, attempted murder, and that's what it is. If you tackle
[1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:44.160]  one of them, they charge you with attempted murder. I mean, they could have killed him
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:49.600]  tackling him. It's hardcore assault. And I mean, you know, this is disgusting. Again,
[1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:54.160]  you have a camera, so they tackle you. I mean, again, we're animals. We're scum to them. We
[1:09:54.160 --> 1:09:59.280]  deserve to be beaten up because we're a third world armpit. Land of the cowards, home of the
[1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:03.760]  slaves. I want land of the free, home of the brave back. Go ahead. So what happened? They
[1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:11.920]  grabbed your stuff. Yeah, they took his camera first, took the memory card out of it, proceeded
[1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:18.240]  to take all of our cameras, removed the memory sticks from them, removed the batteries from all
[1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:22.800]  of them. And you said that all of our North's goons were involved in the earlier stuff.
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:29.920]  Well, there was a guy in suits. I mean, I couldn't. One of the other guys, hold on,
[1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:33.280]  hold on. One of the other guys wants to say something. Do you want to throw him on?
[1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:38.720]  Yeah. Yeah. And I apologize to less night net less. This just happened. We're going to get to
[1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:43.120]  you. We'll hold you longer. Just please be patient. We'll plug your organization about
[1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:48.160]  getting rid of all the humans in a minute, the evil humans. But who is this now I'm talking to?
[1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:55.040]  They're busy giving the phone to somebody else hurts my talking loud in the background. I'll
[1:10:55.040 --> 1:11:00.080]  give them a chance. What thought criminal is this that dare have a video camera and press passes?
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:04.000]  Who is this thought criminal in the new Russian America, the new communist America?
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:10.000]  I think you're having a big discussion about it if they want to get on the phone first.
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:16.160]  This is citizen media. Are you there, Adam? Yeah, I'm here. So they don't want to come on the
[1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:23.840]  camp on the phone. Listen, tell them we can't do these three way talks where they're 10 yards away
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:28.480]  talking. If they want to come on, they can. Okay, Adam, just stop talking to them and let me finish
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:33.680]  up with you. Okay. Okay. You want me to go on? Yeah, I wanted to talk to whoever's babbling in the
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:37.120]  background. Um,
[1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:42.560]  I mean, see, they're talking. So I thought they wanted to come on air.
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:48.800]  Oh, I'm sorry. Are you talking about online line? Because they are not actually with me. They're
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:53.040]  on their way back to, okay, in Ohio. Okay. Okay. So you thought I was bringing somebody else on
[1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:57.440]  going to be clear here. I heard somebody bringing on Ohio. Yeah, I thought somebody I heard somebody
[1:11:57.440 --> 1:12:02.000]  talking real loud and thought they wanted to come over to the telephone. No. And listen,
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:07.360]  if I sound mad at you, I'm not. I'm mad about police tackling someone. You're lucky that it
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:12.000]  sets you up worse. I'm sad for my country and my children's future because we're a nation of
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:17.440]  cowardly trash that allows horrible things to happen to you like this. Now, now finish up.
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:22.800]  What did these goons say to you while they were stealing your stuff? They're naming all things
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:28.800]  they can arrest us for, um, public disobedience or public mischief or how they turn that name
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:33.520]  it up, how they could set you up and, and, and, and be bigger criminals. Go ahead. Right. I mean,
[1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:38.880]  it was like we were just trying to explain that we were pressed. We had went through the normal
[1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:46.000]  channels and got our regular press passes. And I mean, we, one guy stuck a finger like two inches
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:49.600]  from my face and it's just like, you don't talk without talking to me. It's completely Gestapo.
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:53.600]  Well, no, see a lot of more drill sergeants and they think you're a new recruit in the military.
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:58.960]  I mean, literally, that's it. Shut your mouth, boy. You don't talk, you scumbag American. We
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:04.400]  ruled you now like we do the Iraqis. Shut your filthy mouth. We're going to take your houses,
[1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:09.360]  take your bank accounts. We wear black masks to intimidate you. We got armored vehicles. We beat
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:14.560]  up who we want, boy. You understand the country's gone. What Audie Murphy fought for is gone.
[1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:21.280]  Do you understand scum? You have no freedom. Do you understand filth? Do you understand
[1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:27.520]  Adam? You piece of filth. You want me to set you up? You want me to Billy Club you punk?
[1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:30.480]  You know how many cop car videos I got where the person records the cop going,
[1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:34.240]  I can set you up right now scum. I can show you who's in control.
[1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:40.320]  It's exactly what they sound like. Yo, you want me to go get one off YouTube right now and play it?
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:47.840]  You want me to go get one off YouTube right now? I'm not a slave and I'm sick of it.
[1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:54.800]  And we used to be free because we had attitudes like I do. Not a bunch of domesticated slaves.
[1:13:56.960 --> 1:13:58.320]  Adam, anything else you want to add?
[1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:04.000]  After those events they said- What else do these gods do to you?
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:12.080]  After that they proceeded to search us and then banned us all from the Kentucky Exhibition Center
[1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:20.400]  for Life, which is like I said the local fairground in Louisville. Then they released us. They did
[1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:25.120]  release Sam. They took him out of the handcuffs and did release him to my amazement after how
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:30.720]  they were treating him. But that's because they wanted to get back in and eat chili dogs and
[1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:34.880]  act tough and look at girls. More than likely. Yeah, I mean, and believe me, they'd set you up
[1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:39.280]  and send you to prison for life and sleep all night feeling good about it. God, this country
[1:14:39.280 --> 1:14:45.440]  so cess-filled, so evil, so going down, folks. God, we're in trouble. Adam, I'm really sorry
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:49.360]  this happened to you. I want to have you on the show tomorrow. And I hope all other good Americans
[1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:54.560]  are mad at this and just disgusted by this, disgusted that our country has turned into this.
[1:14:54.560 --> 1:15:01.040]  Right there with you, brother. All right, my friend. Anything else? I mean,
[1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:04.480]  do they laugh with supreme victory over America and freedom when you walked off?
[1:15:05.360 --> 1:15:08.800]  They're all pretty pompous about the whole situation. Oh, absolutely. There's nothing
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:12.560]  like slipping this country's throat. Nothing like it. It's clearly Gestapo with smiles on their face,
[1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:17.840]  though. Damn right. Taking down this country's A number one job. You're lucky they didn't drop
[1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:21.440]  some shock in the back of your car. They'll be driving your car next week. All right,
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:26.000]  ladies and gentlemen, this is real hardcore radio. Thank you, Adam Cuttington. Thank you.
[1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:34.400]  Assaulted by third world paramilitary forces. Equipment stolen. His friend assaulted. This is
[1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:39.200]  America. This is what we've turned into. This is the martial law grid. We'll talk to the human
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:53.680]  extinction movement leader on the other side. Stay with me. It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:15:53.680 --> 1:16:00.960]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by powerful government. It's known as the builder bird.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:07.280]  But their objective being world domination for thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:22.240]  of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elites plan for world government
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:27.520]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:31.360]  The builder bird is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea.
[1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:34.720]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:42.160]  aptitude. Order in game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now

[1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:52.080]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your
[1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:57.120]  financial affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts,
[1:16:57.120 --> 1:17:01.760]  confiscation of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have
[1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:06.560]  the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, with the Drug and
[1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:12.080]  Money Laundering Act, the IRS revenue ruling 6045 of 1984 and the Trading with the Enemy Act in
[1:17:12.080 --> 1:17:17.360]  Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:22.000]  government intervention. For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:26.160]  boundaries of trading precious metals privately. Whether if you have any intention of trading
[1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:30.400]  with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[1:17:31.040 --> 1:17:37.440]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237. When investing, always proceed with caution.
[1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:44.080]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237. Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:47.920]  1-800-686-2237.
[1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:25.440]  It even goes beyond a seemingly science-fictional story to that category of a horror story.
[1:18:26.240 --> 1:18:32.560]  But as horrible as it was, it was done. Done out of desperation by a mobile king who was
[1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:37.920]  fighting a desperate battle against three opposing kings. It, of course, was long,
[1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:44.560]  long ago that he did it, and it did work. The raging battle was going against him greatly,
[1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:52.320]  and he was about to be overcome and overrun so he did it, as horrible and difficult as it was
[1:18:52.320 --> 1:19:01.040]  to do. And he did it in the open, upon the wall of the city for all to see. It worked. It caused
[1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:07.520]  the battle to turn and his enemy to flee. This is how it is said in the greatest story book,
[1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:14.080]  and I quote, and there came great wrath against Israel and they departed from him and returned
[1:19:14.080 --> 1:19:21.600]  to their own land. What did he do? We tell you the rest of that another untold story at
[1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:47.600]  www.anotheruntoldstory.com and tell you how the same power is being used in our land today.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:56.880]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:07.200]  By the way, they usually hold a few tickets, even though it's sold out, 20 or 30 tickets,
[1:20:07.840 --> 1:20:14.560]  to at showtime. I'll be showing in-game, the new film,
[1:20:14.560 --> 1:20:22.800]  Truth Rising, Dalmo Draft House downtown at 6.30, and I don't give a speech, and I'm fired up now.
[1:20:25.120 --> 1:20:29.280]  Look, I get upset about the press being assaulted when they had press passes being
[1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:35.840]  grabbed, being shaken down, being threatened, being laughed at, being abused, being beat up.
[1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:41.600]  That's third world folks, that's Russia, that's China. And police would have never done that
[1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:47.120]  20, 30, 40 years ago. We're in a lot of trouble. And again, this isn't a thing about hating the
[1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:52.720]  police. It's about knowing we're in deep trouble, folks. This country is in bad shape. We've got
[1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:57.760]  very evil people running the government. Shifting gears, last night, Voluntary Human Extinction
[1:20:57.760 --> 1:21:11.280]  Movement, their website is V-H-E-M-T dot o-r-g, V-H-E-M-T dot o-r-g. And we wrote an article for
[1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:15.600]  infowars.net, ecogroup calls for voluntary human extinction, says Massachusetts is being
[1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:20.320]  indoctrinated to stop having children in order that human race can die out and save the planet.
[1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:26.400]  So, so all humans need to go, correct, sir? Well, sure. As long as there's one reading couple,
[1:21:26.400 --> 1:21:30.960]  we could be right back where we are. But we don't really, aren't really in favor of indoctrination.
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:36.080]  We're countering the indoctrination that we get from childhood to breed as much as possible.
[1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:41.120]  But I mean, you're inherently saying we're a bad species. No, we're not. We don't mean to be
[1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:49.200]  no more than any exotic invader is. Yeah. But I mean, all species on this planet are in competition
[1:21:49.200 --> 1:21:55.360]  with, so to say that they're a non-indigenous, you know, exotic invader is just ridiculous.
[1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:59.200]  Well, we've only been in North America, what, 13, 14,000 years? And more like,
[1:21:59.200 --> 1:22:05.040]  more like 35,000. Okay, I'll accept that. So 35,000 years ago, humans came to North America
[1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:11.120]  and it started causing species to go extinct. Well, that's what other species do to others.
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:18.320]  Yes, the pygmy, mammoth, the mammoth, so what? They rarely actually cause them to go extinct,
[1:22:18.320 --> 1:22:22.160]  because then they would go extinct. They don't endanger their own existence as we did.
[1:22:22.160 --> 1:22:27.200]  But of course, we're so clever, we can go ahead and kill off a mammoth species and still do fine.
[1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:32.480]  But I mean, before humans even existed, there were millions of species that came and went.
[1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:35.200]  Yes, they did. They all preditated on top of each other.
[1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:40.960]  Well, most of the time, they just passed on to another species, but 99% of them were right.
[1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:45.280]  Well, let me just say this, okay? Our species comes first, we're going to the stars,
[1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:49.840]  and no human hater is going to stop us. I love humanity. I'm in love with humanity,
[1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:56.800]  and I'm going to live on through my progeny's genetics, and we're going to Alpha Centuries,
[1:22:56.800 --> 1:23:02.000]  and you're not going to stop us. I hear you, you don't like that, do you? You don't like the fact
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:05.600]  that we're going to the stars, do you? Well, I don't know, we ought to take care of our own
[1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:10.000]  backyard first. Oh, by getting rid of all humans. Well, that would help, yeah.
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:14.640]  Well, it's not going to happen in our lifetime. That upset you to hear about humans going to the
[1:23:14.640 --> 1:23:19.840]  stars, didn't it? Well, you know, the evil would spread. We're not evil. Oh, like the German film
[1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:24.000]  fest winning film from last year that shows humans spreading across the universe as a disease?
[1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:29.280]  Well, I didn't make that film. I didn't know about that. Sounds like an interesting film, though.
[1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:33.440]  What is it about humanity? I mean, your mommy and daddy weren't nice to you?
[1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:37.840]  No, some of my best friends are humans. I'd probably like you if I got to know you.
[1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:42.080]  Okay, where were you? Because I know you've got a mainstream view. I know most people at the
[1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:45.520]  major colleges agree with you. I mean, tell me, I mean, you've got your people right here in
[1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:50.320]  Austin. Tell me about the group. Tell me about the goals. Well, one of the main goals is to
[1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:55.920]  respect freedoms that are being taken away from us, especially reproductive freedom. More and
[1:23:55.920 --> 1:24:00.240]  more people are losing the right to not breed. All over the world, this is happening is people
[1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:05.440]  who denied contraceptions. They won't even give them condoms to prevent AIDS and, of course,
[1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:09.520]  more children than they can care for. But that's part of the Eugenicist Royal Commission on
[1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:14.320]  Population, where the Eugenicists actually want them to breed, show it breaks down their society
[1:24:14.320 --> 1:24:19.440]  so that most the children die as a soft kill op to keep them suppressed. So don't you think we
[1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:24.560]  should stop that? Well, no, because they also do that. But then they also run the Eugenics
[1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:29.440]  overlay program with the sterilization compounds and the vaccines and the rest of it. Eugenics,
[1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:33.840]  that requires breeding. We're not in favor of that at all. Oh, I know, you're even more extreme.
[1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:37.840]  But I mean, you know about Dr. Eric Pionka, who wants 90% of us minimum to die, right?
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:43.440]  Oh, I think I heard that, yeah. But you know, 100% of us are going to die eventually. What's his
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:49.440]  hurry? So you think this should just be a planet with all the skyscrapers and pyramids and the rest
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:54.720]  of it with ivy growing all over it, a heavenly place for the different animals to live on?
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:59.760]  Yeah, wouldn't that be nice? Well, we would know. It wouldn't be nice at all, no.
[1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:04.960]  Well, eventually they will get covered with ivy. So when did you
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:09.360]  found the group? Why did you decide to do this? Well, I'm not really the founder. I'm kind of
[1:25:09.360 --> 1:25:14.080]  the finder. It was here all along. I just gave it a name so that it wouldn't get lost again.
[1:25:14.080 --> 1:25:19.200]  But every time I looked at a problem, both human and ecological, it all came back to
[1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:25.680]  there were more of us than the area you could handle. And every problem is increased by
[1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:31.520]  there being more of us. Well, see, I disagree with that. And the earth was born out of fire.
[1:25:31.520 --> 1:25:37.120]  The earth is extremely strong. Life is very resilient. And once a country industrializes,
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:41.440]  their population goes into negative fall, we're going to peak at about 8 billion in about 15
[1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:46.240]  years, and then the population is going to start dropping on its own. But to say that we should
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:50.880]  go down to no humans, I mean, it's just sick. Yeah, it isn't going to happen is that I don't know
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:55.680]  people just keep on. Why are you supposed people reproduce so much?
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:26:02.000]  Because we are a dynamic species that has that inbred instinct to continue on and live forever
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:07.600]  through our progeny. As we reach for the stars as a dynamic, magical super species completely
[1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:12.080]  dominant on this planet made the image of God. But I bet money you don't believe in God, do you?
[1:26:12.080 --> 1:26:18.480]  Or a creator? Well, the full range of philosophical belief exists in the movement. But I just
[1:26:18.480 --> 1:26:23.600]  wondered how we were created. And let me assure you, the creator isn't going to stand by. We
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:29.040]  were created for a reason, bubba. Well, then there's no problem. I mean, that would be very handy.
[1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:34.640]  Well, your people, though, work in the biology labs, they work in the weapons labs,
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:41.040]  pionkas people work in those labs. He got a 95% standing ovation. Peter Singer gets that.
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:44.480]  You know, you're just the extreme version of these guys, you know, who only only went 90,
[1:26:44.480 --> 1:26:50.320]  95%. I had his graduate students write me and say all humans should die. How many members you got?
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:54.960]  There are no members. It's not an organization. It's a movement. I have no idea. I'd say millions
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:59.360]  of people have arrived at the conclusion that the Earth's biosphere would be better off without
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:04.320]  humans. But I don't think very many of them imagine. Are you kidding? Humans are going
[1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:09.840]  to be able to create new planets in terraform them. We're going to spread life. We're good,
[1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:16.720]  not bad. We're just taking some of the resources from the egg that we're in for substance
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:21.040]  sustenance. Well, our eyes are on the stars while we're sinking into a toxic sludge.
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:27.520]  Well, we're actually not sinking in toxic sludge. That's all exaggerated. So the establishment
[1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:33.920]  can make us anti human so they can preditate and feed and his predators feed on us. And it's
[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:39.600]  an it's a predator system where a subspecies of psychopaths have created armored gills to feed
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:45.680]  upon us, the normal homo sapien sapien, the communal friendly homo sapien sapien who do not have
[1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:51.840]  the psychopathic overlay that 1% out of 100 of our population has. Why don't we starve them to death
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:57.520]  by not creating more of us? Well, I think we should educate the public instead of dumbing
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:02.160]  them down as the elite are doing. So the elite want to kill 90% of us and then manage the other
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:07.200]  10% you just want us all gone. But you have that same idea that they have. No, I think we have an
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:11.440]  entire later. I have more along your lines of ideas how we have we need more freedom,
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:17.840]  more freedom to die. Well, we're going to do that. I mean more freedom to live. But don't
[1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:22.000]  worry, the UN is going to speak for all the animals and their votes can outvote us in the UN
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:26.800]  as Richard in Haas said is going to quote wage war against humanity. Stay there pleaser if you
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:30.400]  can. I'd like to talk to you more on the other side and get out the website for those that want
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:35.200]  to see this is actually real. This is the majority view in all major universities. They're everywhere.
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:53.280]  Well, they're right back now from the makers of loose change, the most downloaded film in
[1:28:53.280 --> 1:28:59.200]  internet history comes the long awaited release of loose change final cut, an entirely new two

[1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:20.320]  change final cut is the ultimate 9 11 expose from hijackers being trained at US military bases to

[1:29:52.320 --> 1:29:57.040]  is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism. Globalists are concerned with what's good for
[1:29:57.040 --> 1:30:02.000]  the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people. The only antidote to the poison
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:06.720]  of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the nationalist times each month.

[1:33:05.920 --> 1:33:10.640]  Yeah, you pay hundreds of taxes on the eugenicists of our society and bosses around.
[1:33:10.640 --> 1:33:16.640]  You don't follow their order. It doesn't matter how unlawful it is. They're going to beat your
[1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:22.640]  brains out. Taser, you die. And then a judge is going to tell the doctor the coroner to say
[1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:28.240]  you didn't die from a taser. It's called tyranny. It's how most people live. You want to be third
[1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:33.680]  world slaves? You want your kids to grow in bondage? You want to deny all this is going on America?
[1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:42.080]  Canada, England? Then you're going to be under the gun. Shift in gears. Yeah, the majority of you
[1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:46.800]  is an anti-human. Humans are bad. Got to reduce our numbers. Got to taxes. Got to regulate us.
[1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:52.960]  Got to control us. Got to squeeze us. But some, and it's quite a large group now, are saying,
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:57.600]  get rid of all humans. The earth will be better without humans. Let's just get rid of everybody.
[1:33:57.600 --> 1:34:00.640]  But the volunteer extinction is they're saying, well, we just shouldn't breed and that's how it
[1:34:00.640 --> 1:34:05.840]  should happen. You say people don't have rights. I mean, there's not given to them like health
[1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:08.880]  care is a right. That's why the government wants to give us health care so they can carry out
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:15.120]  eugenics upon us. I mean, are you for all the new environmental rules and carbon taxes to cut back
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:21.040]  on the resources humans get so we stop breeding? I hadn't heard about that. They're going to cut
[1:34:21.040 --> 1:34:25.520]  back on our resources in order to get us to stop breeding. Yes. Why don't they just not give us
[1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:30.240]  a thousand dollars per child? That's in the U.S. and the rest of the world. It's different. You're
[1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:35.440]  right. It's truly in 3,000 in Australia. Almost every country except China is paying
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:40.160]  people to reproduce. They want more people. They can control them better. Let's be clear
[1:34:40.160 --> 1:34:45.520]  about the eugenicist policy developed in official U.S. government policy. If you'd like to read it,
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:50.320]  have you seen State Department memorandum 200? No, I haven't. Okay. Well, let me just tell you,
[1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:53.440]  and you can Google that and go to the State Department. You can read it for yourself.
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:35:01.360]  It's official U.S. policy since 1973 secretly declassified in 1992 that that's white countries.
[1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:05.840]  They have a secret program to try to get whites to breed, and now it's public with the billboards
[1:35:05.840 --> 1:35:10.000]  saying have children and giving them money. But the Planned Parenthood and the Black and Latino
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:17.920]  neighborhoods and the eugenics funding and UN funding and IMF agreements from South America
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:24.480]  all the way over to China is official agreements for one-child policies, and that was signed with
[1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:28.880]  the IMF World Bank through State Department memorandum 200. Well, they sure don't seem to be
[1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:32.800]  implementing that plan very fast. Well, no, they only want to get rid of the brown people.
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:38.800]  That's why AIDS is you're much more likely to get it if you're not an Anglo. Well, that's not nice.
[1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:44.240]  Yeah, so the whites need to get out of the way too, right? Well, I don't see much difference.
[1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:49.280]  Well, I don't either. So, I mean, in your perfect world, you're the boss. What would you do?
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:54.880]  I would make sure that every couple on the planet had the ability to not breed if they didn't want to.
[1:35:56.320 --> 1:35:58.800]  And the government, of course, wouldn't get involved in pushing that.
[1:35:58.800 --> 1:36:04.320]  I don't think they need to, no. Italy has one of the lowest birth rates on the planet.
[1:36:04.320 --> 1:36:07.440]  One point two children apiece. They're dying, yes.
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:12.320]  Right. Well, their population is holding steady through migration.
[1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:16.000]  That's immigrant influx from North Africa, predominantly in Asia. Yeah.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:21.120]  But let's talk about Germany, 1.4. England, 1.8 with a giant immigrant influx.
[1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:26.800]  The U.S. 2.3, but it's actually about a 1.7 if you don't count the immigrant influx.
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:30.320]  So the death of the West isn't enough for you. The rest of what's happening is,
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:34.480]  I mean, what would you do then? Because you said people aren't going to do it.
[1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:39.280]  I mean, what would you do? Oh, the first thing you have to do is allow reproductive freedom.
[1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:43.680]  And then it does happen. Italy doesn't have any program of trying to keep people from breeding.
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:47.360]  In fact, they're paying them to breed. No, they're very selfish, modern, decadent people who've
[1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:53.280]  lost the will to live and they're dying. Maybe that's the way to do it. Have more decadence.
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:57.920]  Well, that's actually what the official government plans and psych warfare programs
[1:36:57.920 --> 1:37:02.160]  of the official Pentagon policy is to do that. And that's why you see all this entertainment and
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:06.320]  the rest of it. Well, yeah. And they'll forget about having our jobs shipped overseas.
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:12.000]  Well, the first thing they've got to do is get control of the society and dumb us down
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:16.320]  so people are in a false reality so they can carry out the extermination. Don't worry,
[1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:18.720]  it's coming. They just got to have an orderly culling.
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:22.800]  You mean an actual extermination like gas chambers and all that stuff?
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:27.600]  Oh, no. Control bio weapons releases. They claim that some have been lied and will release.
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:32.000]  Oh, I see. Why? Well, I sure wouldn't want to bring a child into a world like this.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:36.480]  But I mean, overall, though, if humans are so bad, doesn't that get what you want?
[1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:39.120]  Well, I've never said humans are bad. We're not bad. We're not evil.
[1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:42.800]  But we all need to, we need to all go away, though.
[1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:45.040]  Phase out. Yeah, peaceful phase out. Yeah.
[1:37:46.240 --> 1:37:49.520]  Don't you think that would solve every problem on the planet, both human and...
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:52.880]  But see, you're here to break the ice and introduce this idea. You all know it's not
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:56.960]  going to be voluntary and it's not voluntary and you're not stupid, Mr. Knight. You know what's
[1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:00.640]  going on. Well, I'm learning a lot on your program. That's for sure.
[1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:03.200]  Don't worry. There's the big boys are up there. They're thinking, too.
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:06.880]  Are they the elite? I hear about those and I wonder...
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:10.960]  Yeah, the Davos World Forum is beating right now. David Rockefeller, they all write books
[1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:15.760]  about our slaves and how they want to... The Rockefellers funded over 100 eugenics organizations.
[1:38:15.760 --> 1:38:19.760]  They funded Hitler and that's what they're carrying out.
[1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:22.480]  Are they... Is the Vatican part of that group?
[1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:27.280]  No, the Vatican actually pushes for larger populations.
[1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:32.160]  Right. They do, yeah. It's not one monolith. That's why there's these jockeying groups.
[1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:36.880]  I see. But the dominant technocrats want a force reduction in population.
[1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:42.160]  And the U.S. per regime, the Bush administration, are they in favor of more people or fewer people?
[1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:45.200]  Well, you know, he says he's a conservative, but he tripled the size of the government and
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:49.840]  tripled the size of the BATF and opened the borders. So in actual, yeah, it was his father
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:56.320]  as a U.S. ambassador to China that had them sign the eugenics plan of State Department
[1:38:56.320 --> 1:39:01.680]  memorandum 200. So yes, he does want eugenics and population reduction.
[1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:07.040]  So they only want certain genetic species of humans and not others?
[1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:13.840]  Yeah, that's what the DNA ancestry projects about with IBM. Did you hear about how the
[1:39:13.840 --> 1:39:17.840]  head of the human genome project that happened to be at the Cold Springs Harbor had eugenics
[1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:22.640]  laboratory, the birthplace of that in the U.S., how he had to leave last year saying blacks
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:27.440]  really weren't humans? No, I hadn't heard that. We'll see every major person heading up every
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:32.240]  major group has that same view. Well, that's not nice at all. I mean, they're just like us.
[1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:38.240]  Not according to people who have a view that humans are bad, just only a select, don't worry,
[1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:42.640]  most Anglos are going to be exterminated, too, and reduced in one child out. But they believe
[1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:50.800]  an elite guild of Anglo-Saxon will go on into the future. Well, I guess that's not a future that
[1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:58.560]  I'll see. I'll be gone before that happens. Yeah, but they got their ideas from whether it's good
[1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:02.720]  or bad. I'm a Christian myself, but they got it from the Old Testament. So it actually comes out
[1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:07.280]  of the Old Testament, their beliefs on that. I thought that sounded familiar. Yeah. I just
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:10.880]  want you to know who's running it all, and I wanted you to know that that's happening. Well,
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:13.920]  because there's some other racial groups that also believe in the same thing. They just believe
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:17.120]  it's going to be their group that's going to go on and live, too. So it's kind of a jockeying for
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:21.120]  the control levers, because now they have life extension technologies. They don't want the
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:25.280]  general public to know about those. I bet you think that's a bad idea. Can you imagine six
[1:40:25.280 --> 1:40:30.560]  and a half million people with life extension? Look out. You never find a place to park then.
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:39.040]  You might be in agreement on a lot of things, Alex. So how did you wake up to all of this?
[1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:43.840]  I mean, how did you form these ideas? I think I arrived at it the same way a lot of people
[1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:48.160]  have through logic and love. I looked around and figured out what was happening and then using
[1:40:48.160 --> 1:40:53.520]  compassion for my fellow humans. Oh, yeah. You've got it, too. Come on. I can tell
[1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:58.640]  for compassion for my fellow humans. I thought, what we need here is more freedom. Yeah. We don't
[1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:03.920]  want to build those deep space bases and mine the asteroid belt and travel to distant solar
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:09.440]  systems and then galaxies and then go on to the next level. God forbid this incredible species
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:16.560]  has brought us Mozart and Beethoven and Saturn rockets. Yeah, we like that. But when we're gone,
[1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:20.560]  we won't need that. But, you know, we are very clever. Let me just tell you, you're going to fail,
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:25.840]  and humanity is going to realize that people with your mindset are at the switch,
[1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:30.000]  and we are going to wake up and break out of the matrix paradigm, and we're going to the next level.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:37.840]  I think it's horrible to worship life forms, lower life forms to such an extent. I want all
[1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:42.080]  the environmentalists to realize this is the final expression of your ideas to worship them
[1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:48.080]  so much and put them ahead of our species. Well, it's not just them. It's the entire biosphere
[1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:53.360]  as a whole. The entire biosphere was born in deep space radiation with a giant sun
[1:41:53.360 --> 1:42:00.560]  blasting it and volcanic slurries. We couldn't take that today. We certainly could. Life is going
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:10.480]  to continue. Well, it is true that humans may destroy themselves because of our elites,
[1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:15.360]  who have the superconducting heavy reactors with the cyclotrons, which they admit their
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:19.520]  own equation show will probably destroy the whole planet. I am against destroying the planet,
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:26.880]  but only because it's our launch pad to the cosmos. I appreciate you joining us. And I would
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:32.560]  just tell you that if you think humans are so bad, you need to go ahead and show us, by example,
[1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:37.360]  what we're supposed to do. No, not that. No, you've got to continue with your knowledge.
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:42.000]  You've got a too important mission, right? Once we're here, there's no sense in the call. I'll
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:57.840]  be dead soon enough. There's no hurry. Okay. V H E M T dot org. Thanks for talking to us. You bet.

[1:43:53.680 --> 1:43:58.800]  outdoor air. One child in 10 suffers from asthma. How can we improve the air we breathe? The answer
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:04.080]  is clear. Himalayan crystal salt lamps from Ionic salts. These lamps naturally improve indoor air

[1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:52.320]  Ionic salts, see the beauty, breathe the difference. Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:55.920]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is
[1:44:55.920 --> 1:45:00.560]  turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years. For the last three
[1:45:00.560 --> 1:45:04.480]  years the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce and it has now finally
[1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:08.800]  caught up with us and the U.S. commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed and
[1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:13.200]  the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months. It's fall in the southern
[1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:16.880]  hemisphere and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have
[1:45:16.880 --> 1:45:22.160]  stopped exporting certain commodities altogether. Remember our trade deficit? Trillions of dollars
[1:45:22.160 --> 1:45:27.120]  have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:31.760]  By late summer if not early fall it is likely our government will step in and control food and food
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:42.560]  exports under martial law. Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202 or visit us

[1:45:55.120 --> 1:46:00.800]  Martial law is coming but it's not going to arrive overnight. It's going to be incremental. This
[1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:04.960]  country is already teetering on the edge. Any incidents small or large could trigger a total
[1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:09.760]  takeover. Anything could be the final push. Visit survivalmartiallaw.com and download the e-book full
[1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:13.840]  of information that will prepare you for life under total military control. Know how to survive in

[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:21.920]  and how to use their own psychology against them through social engineering. When martial law is
[1:46:21.920 --> 1:46:25.920]  officially announced checkpoints will be enforced, kind confiscations will occur for registered gun
[1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:29.840]  owners and cities will be on lockdown. You will be dealing with a force that has been in training
[1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:34.560]  for years preparing for this takeover. Visit survivalmartiallaw.com. When ordering this e-book

[1:46:53.840 --> 1:46:58.240]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:10.080]  All right take some final calls. All I want to do is warn my fellow man that you don't know
[1:47:10.080 --> 1:47:14.320]  what's going on in the world and I've discovered things I can't believe but it's true.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:21.360]  Look the elite don't really want us all to die. They've done psychological warfare tests that
[1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:25.760]  are published. I can't imagine what's unpublished that they're teaching you humans are bad so you
[1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:30.800]  lose your instinct to live, your instinct to thrive, your instinct that your life has value
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:37.440]  so they can more easily take your resources, use you as a slave and as robotics becomes widespread,
[1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:42.640]  get rid of you. They're only taking your your instinct to realize how important you are,
[1:47:42.640 --> 1:47:48.480]  how dynamic you are, how special you are and I commit myself to humanity. I commit myself to
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:54.720]  service. I commit myself to rekindling the fires of liberty and everyone's hearts so we can go
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:58.880]  against these transhumanists, so we can go against these New World Order eugenicists,
[1:47:58.880 --> 1:48:04.640]  so we can bring them down and defeat them so we can realize that life's more than just strip malls.
[1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:09.680]  It's more than just letting Madison Avenue feel us make us feel inadequate and petty.
[1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:15.840]  It's about reaching for the stars, being creators in the image of the creator of the universe.
[1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:22.240]  I can feel my ancestors strength, their love, their passion, everything they did to bring us
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:29.360]  to this point and now we're decadent, drunk on hamburgers and beer, not appreciating any
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:34.480]  anymore, decadently nihilistically talking about mass death and destruction. The people that push
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:40.800]  this don't know what mass death and destruction is. God help us and God help our police stop being
[1:48:40.800 --> 1:48:45.280]  thugs who think they're God and who think they can violate our rights all day as they're trained
[1:48:45.280 --> 1:48:51.040]  by the feds to do it for some horrible future event. All right I'm going to your calls as quickly as
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:57.280]  possible, Alan, then Kelly, then Brett, then Chris, Adam. We're going to get to everybody.
[1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:02.000]  I think I got two Adams. That was what was confusing me earlier. Let's go ahead and talk
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:07.360]  to Alan in Virginia. Thanks for holding so long you're on the air. Thank you very much sir and
[1:49:07.360 --> 1:49:14.080]  I'm called in today because I am a transhumanist and you've been alfing off quite a bit and I
[1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:20.320]  last week or two and I think I like to set the record straight on a few things. Well if you
[1:49:20.320 --> 1:49:25.520]  just said you disagreed, he's gone to the head of the line an hour ago but go ahead. Well thank
[1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:32.800]  you very much and I posted some comments on my info wars blog and I used the username Alonso
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:38.240]  TG if you want to look at it. Let me just be clear. I know there's different camps of transhumanists
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:42.480]  and I'm not against getting electronic eyeballs if you're blind. I'm not against stuff like that.
[1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:48.320]  I mean the founders of it were eugenicists and the main overarching drive of it is an elitist eugenics
[1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:57.280]  move. Oh yes I've spoken to a number of people and I personally like James Hughes of the World
[1:49:57.280 --> 1:50:04.240]  Transhumanist Association. I've met him in person. I've met Dr. Hugo Degarras. Let's get all them on.
[1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:12.960]  Hugo Degarras. That's a good idea. I've had various opinions like the general sense of the
[1:50:12.960 --> 1:50:19.360]  community is that Kevin Warwick for example is more of a publicity hound and they'll just say
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:25.520]  things to get on the air. What about Peter Singer? What about all of them? I mean your founder was
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:34.320]  Julian Huxley, head of the UN Black Op on population reduction. I'm not familiar with him. You might
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:40.400]  become familiar with the founder of transhumanism. Well we're not really a unified group. I understand
[1:50:40.400 --> 1:50:44.640]  that. Look I don't want to cut you short but all these other callers got to get on. You call me back
[1:50:44.640 --> 1:50:49.440]  during the weekday show. I'll give you at least 10 minutes Alan. Okay? Well I'll try to think of
[1:50:49.440 --> 1:50:53.760]  something coherent to say then. Okay thank you. I don't want to cut you short. You disagree but
[1:50:53.760 --> 1:50:57.680]  I don't think you understand what movement you're claiming you're part of. Okay look into Julian
[1:50:57.680 --> 1:51:03.600]  Huxley right now. It's an emergency situation. These people aren't playing games. Adam you're
[1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:08.720]  on the air. Go ahead. Hey Alex I'm the first on the call. I have a question about Bilderberg.
[1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:14.880]  Yes? Did they meet over in Vienna or are they coming to DC? I'm the prison planer for myself.
[1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:18.800]  We've never seen so much chatter, disinfo. We don't know if it's true. We don't know if they
[1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:24.800]  really met in Greece. We don't know if they're going to meet in Chantilly in Virginia in two weeks.
[1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:29.040]  We don't know if they're meeting in Vienna. We're seeing all sorts of stuff but we haven't
[1:51:29.040 --> 1:51:36.800]  missed one in 35 years. Our people have always gotten it and Tucker doesn't believe the Greek
[1:51:36.800 --> 1:51:41.760]  press. He thinks it's still coming up and he will be on Monday. Tucker will be on Monday.
[1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:48.480]  Okay Alex, I live real close to the West Hills Married Hotel and it is a perfect spot to have
[1:51:48.480 --> 1:51:53.360]  the meeting. It's really secluded. I actually went over there the other day and I scoped it out.
[1:51:53.360 --> 1:51:57.920]  I mean it's secluded by trees and everything over there. You need to go in like you're checking
[1:51:57.920 --> 1:52:01.280]  in or you need to call and try to check in on that day and I should have done this. I did try
[1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:04.640]  to call and they said it was booked and I said oh because there's a Bilderberg meeting and they
[1:52:04.640 --> 1:52:10.560]  said we don't know what that is. I mean that's just the person who entered the phone taking
[1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:15.520]  the reservation. Well we'll defeat the enemy, don't worry. Yeah but it's a very heavily
[1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:20.720]  popular area over there as far as trees go. I have another question Alex. Are you planning
[1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:25.280]  to go into New York City this year? I don't know. I've just been working so much finishing this
[1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:31.600]  film and I'll be showing tonight in about 45 minutes. Okay. I met you last year in 9-11 so
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:34.960]  I just you know love you man and I appreciate everything you're doing. You're awesome. God
[1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:38.800]  bless you. Okay let's go ahead here and take another call. Folks I'm mad because I know what's
[1:52:38.800 --> 1:52:45.280]  really going on and it's a nightmare. It's a nightmare. You're giving me a sign for two.
[1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:52.000]  Should I go to call her too? Oh they disagree. Well who is it? Former APD officer. You're right Alex.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:57.680]  Oh I see it. Go ahead sir. You're on the air Bill. Hey yeah just to let you know you're completely
[1:52:57.680 --> 1:53:03.120]  right on about the police corruption. There's so much corruption than the local police department
[1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:07.760]  I know at first hand at least and the average is there's no idea. They have no idea how much
[1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:12.880]  corruption is out there and the power the average officer has. So you're doing a service by letting
[1:53:12.880 --> 1:53:18.640]  everybody know. Thank you. Well these police chiefs back up corruption now. Oh yeah. I mean the
[1:53:18.640 --> 1:53:22.640]  stuff I mean look I had the New York cops discuss framing me for hitting them and I said there's
[1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:26.800]  video cameras. I didn't hit you when you arrested me and they said you're in here now. You know we
[1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:32.560]  can do it now right now buddy and I mean you know I grew up with where the sheriff dealt the drugs
[1:53:32.560 --> 1:53:38.640]  in Dallas and then he went to jail for it. You know I mean my point is we've gone bad. Go ahead.
[1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:43.760]  No yeah you're completely correct. There's and I want to name specific names but there's plenty
[1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:48.560]  of individuals in the local police department at least who are corrupt and involved in engaging
[1:53:48.560 --> 1:53:53.920]  drugs prostitution beating their wives everything else but because they have buddies that are higher
[1:53:53.920 --> 1:54:00.560]  up you know nothing happens to the mainstream news reported in California 994,000 people
[1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:06.240]  cannot be arrested for DWI speeding paying tolls and it's police and their families police and
[1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:12.800]  their families and bureaucrats and their families are gods. The average person is scum filth. Yep
[1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:18.560]  and I'm going to say it. I'm scum filth trash with no rights absolute garbage and I want my freedom
[1:54:18.560 --> 1:54:22.800]  back. Yeah there used to be something called you know innocent until proven guilty that's not the
[1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:27.760]  way it is anymore now it's guilty until proven innocent. Listen I had the Austin riot police
[1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:30.880]  out there when we were having a demonstration and they said we're going to arrest you and we're
[1:54:30.880 --> 1:54:35.200]  going to charge you with a bunch of stuff and I just I flipped out and I said listen I said don't
[1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:38.400]  make me do this I'm going to show you each individually and I know you'll probably get off
[1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:42.560]  but you're going to pay for it and I said don't violate my first amendment they backed off and
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:47.200]  Austin just lost a lawsuit last month over that they've lost more than a hundred for arresting
[1:54:47.200 --> 1:54:51.920]  people demonstrating I mean you know just leave our first amendment alone did you hear about them
[1:54:51.920 --> 1:54:56.560]  tackling that guy and then stealing his camera that's just the one you hear about the first one
[1:54:56.560 --> 1:55:00.800]  you hear about there's 30 or 40 or 100 out there you don't care about listen I I know there's a
[1:55:00.800 --> 1:55:05.360]  lot of cops are just getting their paycheck doing a good job helping people but the system is corrupt
[1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:09.520]  and they protect the bad ones I know a cop who beat up a guy in a wheelchair because he was on a
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:13.920]  roid rage and you know he said get out and he said I can't I gotta get my wheelchair and he blew
[1:55:13.920 --> 1:55:18.400]  up in front of the guy's wife and beat him up they got the squad car video and then he got promoted
[1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:24.640]  to commander oh yeah in Austin in Austin I mean it's scary to have shaved head right heads flipping
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:28.720]  out on you because you're with a woman better looking than what they've got on you know yep and
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:32.560]  it happens all the time as people don't realize it's all a good old boy network it's not going to
[1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:37.520]  change that's the problem well it's going to get worse actually it is going to change you know bill
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:40.640]  you know you could secretly show me your documentation because I've had a lot of other
[1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:44.640]  cops do this around the country and then I could have you on as a guest without saying your name
[1:55:44.640 --> 1:55:51.120]  on the radio show can I get your info right now yeah we can do it off the air okay yeah I'm going
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:57.680]  to put him on hold get his info get Bill's info right now and then I'll document what he's saying
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:56:03.120]  we'll have him on as a local guest or something okay and again folks we're in red level crisis the
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:07.920]  elite want corrupt cops because they're really getting ready to do what dictatorships do and that's
[1:56:07.920 --> 1:56:13.120]  taking houses taking ranches taking bank accounts taking women I mean let me tell you that these
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:17.040]  people aren't playing games with a white house wrote memos saying they could sexually torture
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:21.520]  children in front of their parents folks that that's official I mean it don't get worse than that
[1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:27.760]  and they did that and put that out to psychologically set the bar even lower one last caller I'm sorry
