[00:00.000 --> 00:09.560]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.560 --> 00:11.060]  You want answers?
[00:11.060 --> 00:12.720]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.720 --> 00:21.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:31.000]  You can't find the city hall.
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.000]  Definitely taxes.
[00:32.000 --> 00:33.000]  Don't talk about politics or religion.
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.680]  This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line.
[00:37.680 --> 00:38.680]  Lay down, GI.
[00:38.680 --> 00:39.680]  Lay down, GI.
[00:39.680 --> 00:44.160]  We saw it all through the 20th century, and now, in the 21st century, it's time to stand
[00:44.160 --> 00:48.520]  up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.
[00:48.520 --> 00:50.520]  We should not submit to dehumanization.
[00:50.520 --> 00:54.800]  I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
[00:54.800 --> 00:56.520]  I'm concerned with the structure.
[00:56.520 --> 00:59.080]  I'm concerned with the systems of control.
[00:59.080 --> 01:03.280]  Those that control my life, and those that seek to control me, even more.
[01:03.280 --> 01:04.280]  I want freedom.
[01:04.280 --> 01:06.280]  That's what I want, and that's what you should want.
[01:06.280 --> 01:11.280]  And something each and every one of us to turn with is just some of the greed, the hatred,
[01:11.280 --> 01:16.280]  the envy, and yes, the insecurities, because that is the central mode of control, making
[01:16.280 --> 01:22.880]  our planet small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.
[01:22.880 --> 01:27.640]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[01:27.640 --> 01:30.120]  Start challenging this corporate slave state.
[01:30.120 --> 01:35.120]  The 21st century is going to be a new century, not the century of slavery, not the century
[01:35.120 --> 01:40.520]  of lies and indifference and giving us the classism and statism and all the rest of the
[01:40.520 --> 01:41.520]  modes of control.
[01:41.520 --> 01:46.040]  It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and something right.
[01:46.040 --> 01:50.160]  What a bunch of garbage, liberal, democratic, conservative, Republican.
[01:50.160 --> 01:54.000]  It's all there to control you, two sides of the same coin.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.680]  Two management teams, getting for control, the CEO job, a slavery incorporated.
[01:59.680 --> 02:03.520]  The truth is out there in front of you, but they lay out this buffet of lies.
[02:03.520 --> 02:06.520]  I'm sick of it, and I'm not going to take a bite out of it.
[02:06.520 --> 02:07.520]  Do you got me?
[02:07.520 --> 02:08.520]  What's this?
[02:08.520 --> 02:09.520]  This is not human.
[02:09.520 --> 02:10.520]  Human kind is too good.
[02:10.520 --> 02:11.520]  We're not a bunch of underachievers.
[02:11.520 --> 02:16.520]  We're going to stand up, and we're going to be human beings.
[02:16.520 --> 02:22.600]  We're going to be real things, the things that matter, creativity, and the dynamic human
[02:22.600 --> 02:25.600]  spirit that refuses to submit.
[02:25.600 --> 02:26.600]  Well, that's it.
[02:26.600 --> 02:27.600]  That's all I've got to say.
[02:27.600 --> 02:45.600]  We're going to be real things, the things that matter, and we're going to be real things.
[02:45.600 --> 03:09.600]  We're going to be real things, the things that matter, and we're going to be real things.
[03:09.600 --> 03:34.600]  We're going to be real things, the things that matter, and we're going to be real things.
[03:34.600 --> 03:40.240]  just proudly speaking his mind it was real wild but the more I heard it made a
[03:40.240 --> 03:45.440]  whole lot of sense to me I want to thank you Alex for opening my eyes and

[04:40.280 --> 04:46.280]  talking about what's been a going on around the world here in activation
[04:46.280 --> 04:51.280]  they all seem to turn like a pack of wolves when Alex goes on the air
[04:51.280 --> 04:57.280]  in spite of the facts they launch their attacks and I just don't think about it
[04:57.280 --> 05:01.280]  I want to be crazy crazy like Alex Jones

[06:59.280 --> 07:04.280]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[07:04.280 --> 07:06.280]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[07:06.280 --> 07:08.280]  did you know that in a real meltdown
[07:08.280 --> 07:11.280]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[07:11.280 --> 07:14.280]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[07:14.280 --> 07:17.280]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[07:17.280 --> 07:19.280]  so our friends at Solutions from Science
[07:19.280 --> 07:22.280]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds

[07:56.280 --> 07:59.280]  this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[08:01.280 --> 08:05.280]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[08:05.280 --> 08:08.280]  the information war continues
[08:08.280 --> 08:11.280]  it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:14.280 --> 08:18.280]  thank you for joining us for another worldwide transmission against tyranny
[08:18.280 --> 08:24.280]  it is Thursday the 26th day of July 2012
[08:24.280 --> 08:28.280]  and we are going to be here for the next three hours today
[08:28.280 --> 08:32.280]  we're going to have a big exclusive interview on politics
[08:32.280 --> 08:35.280]  something he hasn't done yet really on my show
[08:35.280 --> 08:39.280]  we'll be news making with Dave Mustaine of Megadeth
[08:39.280 --> 08:41.280]  and of course formerly of Metallica
[08:41.280 --> 08:44.280]  Dave Mustaine I talked to him last Friday
[08:44.280 --> 08:47.280]  and we talked in studio for about 45 minutes
[08:47.280 --> 08:49.280]  we're going to air most of it here
[08:49.280 --> 08:52.280]  some of it was so politically incendiary
[08:52.280 --> 08:54.280]  I don't even think I'm going to air it
[08:54.280 --> 08:58.280]  just because of the way they're going to go after Dave about some of it
[08:58.280 --> 09:01.280]  so I mean rarely about an interview that powerful
[09:01.280 --> 09:03.280]  I mean again it'd be good for the show
[09:03.280 --> 09:06.280]  but probably not good for Dave so some of it I've cut out
[09:06.280 --> 09:11.280]  now ladies and gentlemen there is just so much to go over here today
[09:11.280 --> 09:13.280]  I'm going to be quite honest with you
[09:13.280 --> 09:16.280]  I got to the office two minutes ago
[09:16.280 --> 09:20.280]  and do you know why I got to the office two minutes ago
[09:20.280 --> 09:23.280]  and barely got on air
[09:23.280 --> 09:25.280]  well I get ready at home
[09:25.280 --> 09:27.280]  I read news at night in the morning
[09:27.280 --> 09:29.280]  and I send the guys stories I want printed
[09:29.280 --> 09:31.280]  and they print up the stuff off the websites I'm reading
[09:31.280 --> 09:33.280]  you know scour the rest of the web
[09:33.280 --> 09:36.280]  uses a couple hundred articles in here every day
[09:36.280 --> 09:38.280]  and then we break stuff as it comes out
[09:38.280 --> 09:40.280]  you know here on the radio we break it down
[09:40.280 --> 09:44.280]  as it breaks out on the web
[09:44.280 --> 09:49.280]  but driving in today strangely enough
[09:49.280 --> 09:52.280]  on Monday I actually had Darren McBrain
[09:52.280 --> 09:54.280]  and Marcos Morales out at the same place
[09:54.280 --> 09:57.280]  covering it because normally I can get to work
[09:57.280 --> 09:59.280]  from where I live in about 30 minutes
[09:59.280 --> 10:02.280]  I live outside Austin in the edge of the countryside
[10:02.280 --> 10:11.280]  but where I come into town from outside southwest Austin
[10:11.280 --> 10:15.280]  there are three farm roads that are now major roads
[10:15.280 --> 10:20.280]  but haven't been built up coming in to one point
[10:20.280 --> 10:24.280]  and every day from about 9 a.m.
[10:24.280 --> 10:26.280]  it's the worst traffic in Austin
[10:26.280 --> 10:28.280]  this one place I'm talking about it's the Y
[10:28.280 --> 10:33.280]  three roads come together on farm to market roads
[10:33.280 --> 10:35.280]  there's big shopping malls neighborhoods everything
[10:35.280 --> 10:39.280]  and it's already hellish worse traffic per capita in Austin
[10:39.280 --> 10:42.280]  so what does the Austin Police Department do
[10:42.280 --> 10:45.280]  this is what it's like to live in North Korea
[10:45.280 --> 10:47.280]  this is the beginning of it where the TSA
[10:47.280 --> 10:49.280]  sticks their hands down your pants
[10:49.280 --> 10:52.280]  where you come last where the city is completely shut down
[10:52.280 --> 10:55.280]  for Obama to visit they might as well have people out there
[10:55.280 --> 10:57.280]  with royal trumpets when he comes to town
[10:57.280 --> 11:00.280]  it's all about government does what it wants at your expense
[11:00.280 --> 11:03.280]  so now I'm going to have to start coming a whole
[11:03.280 --> 11:07.280]  another route to work it'll take about 45 minutes
[11:07.280 --> 11:10.280]  but that's okay because at least I won't be stuck for
[11:10.280 --> 11:19.280]  one hour one hour trying to go down three miles of road
[11:19.280 --> 11:23.280]  with it at standstill and why was it ladies and gentlemen
[11:23.280 --> 11:27.280]  there's not an official truck weighing station there
[11:27.280 --> 11:31.280]  there is a place you know some concrete parking lots
[11:31.280 --> 11:36.280]  on a little bitty road at this juncture where there's
[11:36.280 --> 11:39.280]  already traffic you know 30 minutes backed up at seven
[11:39.280 --> 11:42.280]  eight nine in the morning the police show up every day
[11:42.280 --> 11:48.280]  at nine o'clock in the morning with about 20 trucks
[11:48.280 --> 11:53.280]  20 police trucks to harass and you know write $500,000
[11:53.280 --> 11:55.280]  tickets you name it to the truck drivers I mean I'm talking
[11:55.280 --> 11:58.280]  about for anything dust on the bumper you name it
[11:58.280 --> 12:01.280]  revenue generating it's like watching a bunch of seagulls
[12:01.280 --> 12:03.280]  when they find men is just diving in and eating them
[12:03.280 --> 12:06.280]  or you'll see dolphins circling fish eating them
[12:06.280 --> 12:09.280]  it's a feeding frenzy they'll have 20 truck police out there
[12:09.280 --> 12:12.280]  we got footage of this the other day because I barely got to work
[12:12.280 --> 12:15.280]  and I took some photos on my iPhone my iPhone this morning
[12:15.280 --> 12:18.280]  somebody took the charger out of my car I don't know who
[12:18.280 --> 12:23.280]  at my house so my phone dies as I'm driving in talking
[12:23.280 --> 12:31.280]  to somebody talking to Chris the producer yeah it's about
[12:31.280 --> 12:35.280]  1010 or so and I'm saying yeah I'm stuck in traffic looks
[12:35.280 --> 12:38.280]  bad they probably got that stupid checkpoint up ahead again
[12:38.280 --> 12:41.280]  phone dies so I couldn't get any video this but McBreen
[12:41.280 --> 12:44.280]  and Morales went out there Monday and they got footage
[12:44.280 --> 12:47.280]  of it that was it like noon it was still going and causing
[12:47.280 --> 12:50.280]  a giant traffic jam let me explain what happens the police
[12:50.280 --> 12:54.280]  on a two-lane road walk out and just hold their hand out
[12:54.280 --> 12:57.280]  this isn't some official way station for commercial vehicles
[12:57.280 --> 13:01.280]  they just stop traffic and they'll take as many those have
[13:01.280 --> 13:04.280]  trucks is back up on the road while they direct them into
[13:04.280 --> 13:08.280]  this parking lot and then it snarls up everybody else
[13:08.280 --> 13:12.280]  both ways and hell breaks loose and I know this goes on
[13:12.280 --> 13:14.280]  all over the country I've seen footage out of Tennessee
[13:14.280 --> 13:17.280]  California you name it where they'll have the army the
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.280]  Marines run by TSA they'll just shut down major I've seen
[13:20.280 --> 13:23.280]  footage on the news in Tennessee where huge highways are
[13:23.280 --> 13:28.280]  backed up 20 miles as they just randomly search everyone
[13:28.280 --> 13:30.280]  they say well those are commercial vehicles what they do
[13:30.280 --> 13:34.280]  is they started back in the 20s saying we're paying for
[13:34.280 --> 13:36.280]  roads and these trucks are making money on them and
[13:36.280 --> 13:40.280]  they're heavy and tearing up the roads so we ought to
[13:40.280 --> 13:44.280]  tax them to build the roads and they use envy in the
[13:44.280 --> 13:47.280]  general public yeah let's just get these truck drivers
[13:47.280 --> 13:51.280]  they just pass the cost on to you and the goods and then
[13:51.280 --> 13:54.280]  they started by the 50s going just get your little card
[13:54.280 --> 13:56.280]  showing that you own this you know this vehicle so you
[13:56.280 --> 13:58.280]  pull it out and has the license number so we know it's
[13:58.280 --> 14:01.280]  not stolen then it's your face then it's an RFID then
[14:01.280 --> 14:04.280]  you got to have it to buy and sell then the IRS says
[14:04.280 --> 14:07.280]  you can't travel even inside the country if they say you
[14:07.280 --> 14:10.280]  haven't paid taxes the private fellow reserve this is the
[14:10.280 --> 14:14.280]  enslavement I got police calling and go yeah we're being
[14:14.280 --> 14:17.280]  replaced with robot cameras and stuff and I don't think
[14:17.280 --> 14:19.280]  it's right and the cops don't even know it's illegal it's
[14:19.280 --> 14:22.280]  been found by courts hundreds of times you got to have a
[14:22.280 --> 14:25.280]  sworn peace officer shine you know the ticket and fill it
[14:25.280 --> 14:27.280]  out for it to be admissible in court but they don't care
[14:27.280 --> 14:30.280]  it's all lawlessness and let me tell you something that
[14:30.280 --> 14:32.280]  that checkpoint out there I don't care what you say about
[14:32.280 --> 14:36.280]  commercial vehicles it's lawless and that's what the TSA
[14:36.280 --> 14:39.280]  and all this is they're just inducting us into commerce
[14:39.280 --> 14:42.280]  as well and getting us to waive our rights and enter into
[14:42.280 --> 14:45.280]  commerce and that's how they now say traveling is a privilege
[14:45.280 --> 14:48.280]  it is not a privilege read the founding fathers read the
[14:48.280 --> 14:51.280]  constitution they're they're now saying guns are a privilege
[14:51.280 --> 14:54.280]  I'm now here no they're not just because you were taught
[14:54.280 --> 14:57.280]  that at the academy does not mean it you're now taught
[14:57.280 --> 15:01.280]  George Washington's a piece of trash at the academy by FEMA
[15:01.280 --> 15:05.280]  I have it on video and the training manuals now it's all
[15:05.280 --> 15:09.280]  garbage but again yeah oh wait McBraying just came in we
[15:09.280 --> 15:11.280]  haven't aired this yet on the nightly news because I was
[15:11.280 --> 15:15.280]  going to host it and talk about it I'm talking 20 police
[15:15.280 --> 15:17.280]  this was at noon though see how the traffic's moving but
[15:17.280 --> 15:21.280]  down there's a a a a huge stop if you're watching at
[15:21.280 --> 15:25.280]  prisonplanet.tv and the police just walk out in the road
[15:25.280 --> 15:29.280]  and block everybody again this is at noon and that's how
[15:29.280 --> 15:34.280]  busy those roads are but when they do it at nine and ten
[15:34.280 --> 15:39.280]  a.m. ladies and gentlemen it caused a unbelievable event
[15:39.280 --> 15:43.280]  but I mean you know what I've got I was so focused and so
[15:43.280 --> 15:48.280]  ready to get on air today and talk about Obama openly
[15:48.280 --> 15:50.280]  coming out and saying yeah you don't need semi-automatic
[15:50.280 --> 15:54.280]  firearms I told you this was coming the NRA is part of the
[15:54.280 --> 15:57.280]  UN they're they're an NGO there we had a board member on
[15:57.280 --> 16:00.280]  former commerce and Bob Barr yesterday they're at the UN
[16:00.280 --> 16:03.280]  so they can watch them and that's why they came out earlier
[16:03.280 --> 16:06.280]  this year in the Washington Times other places and said
[16:06.280 --> 16:09.280]  we've been at the meetings they plan to ban all semi-autos
[16:09.280 --> 16:12.280]  I mean that means have them turned turned in you're like
[16:12.280 --> 16:16.280]  well it'll cause a civil war that's the plan folks this
[16:16.280 --> 16:20.280]  isn't a game and they said they plan to register and then
[16:20.280 --> 16:22.280]  ban all semi-autos you're like oh that's not going to
[16:22.280 --> 16:28.280]  happen the ATF last year guys just type in public comment
[16:28.280 --> 16:35.280]  comment period on banning of shotguns and then you'll
[16:35.280 --> 16:38.280]  you'll get from last year you guys couldn't find yesterday
[16:38.280 --> 16:41.280]  if you want curtain article on it you can give it to you
[16:41.280 --> 16:44.280]  it's all over the place from last year was on the ATF side
[16:44.280 --> 16:47.280]  but newspapers ran it as well because it was a public notice
[16:47.280 --> 16:50.280]  saying we're going to ban all bottom loading shotguns we're
[16:50.280 --> 16:53.280]  going to ban them from sale and you got to turn them in
[16:53.280 --> 16:56.280]  and they said oh because you can take a clip in the bottom
[16:56.280 --> 17:00.280]  and that's not a sporting use okay this is what they're playing
[17:00.280 --> 17:04.280]  they're not playing games they want to attack the American
[17:04.280 --> 17:08.280]  people they want to go and they'll pick people to go after
[17:08.280 --> 17:11.280]  put on the news and show them getting killed to scare you
[17:11.280 --> 17:14.280]  and a lot of people will line up and turn their guns in
[17:14.280 --> 17:17.280]  and you notice Bill Crystal of Fox News has come out and said
[17:17.280 --> 17:20.280]  it's time to ban semi-autos I can play the video
[17:20.280 --> 17:22.280]  SonyFullWars.com Fox News
[17:22.280 --> 17:26.280]  Rupert Murdoch has called for a ban of all semi-autos
[17:26.280 --> 17:29.280]  you notice Obama's coming out you notice all the surrogates
[17:29.280 --> 17:32.280]  are coming out you know I mean this is all coordinated
[17:32.280 --> 17:34.280]  ladies and gentlemen
[17:34.280 --> 17:37.280]  Mitt Romney when he was governor of Massachusetts he said
[17:37.280 --> 17:41.280]  ban semi-autos this is how they're going to start
[17:41.280 --> 17:45.280]  by the way that's most guns very few I mean most of the stuff
[17:45.280 --> 17:48.280]  that isn't semi-auto is sporting like a double barrel shotgun
[17:48.280 --> 17:52.280]  or a you know Remington 700 or something like that
[17:52.280 --> 17:56.280]  bolt-action 308 we're in a lot of trouble
[17:56.280 --> 18:00.280]  they mean business and again we're going to go to right come back
[18:00.280 --> 18:03.280]  and just reset and get into all this but I've got to explain
[18:03.280 --> 18:06.280]  something to you folks these are criminals we're dealing with
[18:06.280 --> 18:08.280]  these aren't well-meaning liberals these aren't even you know
[18:08.280 --> 18:12.280]  misguided communists whatever these are authoritarian criminals
[18:12.280 --> 18:16.280]  okay this is about total domination of America they've announced
[18:16.280 --> 18:20.280]  foreign banks own us and run us and the fact that this is in
[18:20.280 --> 18:24.280]  my film police state 2000 from 12 years ago the feds would do
[18:24.280 --> 18:27.280]  grants to shut down all of I-35 you can look this up in police
[18:27.280 --> 18:30.280]  state 2000 about halfway into the film
[18:30.280 --> 18:33.280]  it's in the intro and they would back up traffic from South
[18:33.280 --> 18:38.280]  Austin all the way to round rock 20 miles I'm talking stop
[18:38.280 --> 18:42.280]  and go searching cars on the highway till the Texas Supreme
[18:42.280 --> 18:45.280]  Court said stop doing it the other states are allowing this
[18:45.280 --> 18:50.280]  activity imagine being the Austin police with 20 truck police
[18:50.280 --> 18:56.280]  out there purely generating revenue picking the most busy
[18:56.280 --> 19:01.280]  clogged three roads coming together
[19:01.280 --> 19:06.280]  290 71 and Mopac and all these major it's more than three
[19:06.280 --> 19:09.280]  roads there's a bunch of roads feeding into it and it is a
[19:09.280 --> 19:15.280]  nightmare snurl with red lights three major roads coming in
[19:15.280 --> 19:18.280]  with big roads feeding into those roads so you got three roads
[19:18.280 --> 19:21.280]  coming in with other roads feeding into them it's traffic 24
[19:21.280 --> 19:24.280]  I mean I've driven to there at midnight there's traffic and
[19:24.280 --> 19:29.280]  the police shut up down to 90 300 yards from the Y and just
[19:29.280 --> 19:34.280]  back traffic up for four or five miles so they can sit there
[19:34.280 --> 19:38.280]  and pull truck and just walk out and just back trucks up in
[19:38.280 --> 19:42.280]  the road okay well now it's one lane road okay pull in here
[19:42.280 --> 19:45.280]  I'm gonna ratchet thousand dollar ticket step right up step
[19:45.280 --> 19:48.280]  right up that's the arrogance and the disconnect of
[19:48.280 --> 19:53.280]  government I almost missed a Ron Paul interview last time he
[19:53.280 --> 19:57.280]  was on because of a stinking checkpoint I mean it's incredible
[19:57.280 --> 20:02.280]  it's incredible it's incredible for more than six years I've

[24:10.280 --> 24:13.280]  in this short segment the long segment I'm getting into
[24:13.280 --> 24:17.280]  the confirmed fact they're coming after our guns this is this is huge
[24:17.280 --> 24:20.280]  I'm gonna finish up as I just walked back in the shipping department
[24:20.280 --> 24:24.280]  Henson runs here at info wars.com command center
[24:24.280 --> 24:28.280]  and I walked back there and I you know was talking to him about a few things
[24:28.280 --> 24:31.280]  and he said man you're right on about this truck police thing
[24:31.280 --> 24:34.280]  I was just in Louisiana visiting family a few weeks ago
[24:34.280 --> 24:38.280]  he'd been off for half the week and he said does this look like a truck
[24:38.280 --> 24:41.280]  that needs to be inspected it's this big beautiful Peterbilt
[24:41.280 --> 24:45.280]  his cousin's you know truck that he moves
[24:45.280 --> 24:49.280]  highway equipment bulldozers around with
[24:49.280 --> 24:53.280]  oh yeah they're even pulling over the trucks going you know expanding the road right there
[24:53.280 --> 24:57.280]  it's crazy and he was describing how they keep him on the side of the road
[24:57.280 --> 25:01.280]  all the time now and he's been a truck driver for a long time he said now
[25:01.280 --> 25:04.280]  this is all over the country by the way they're squeezing us just like the
[25:04.280 --> 25:08.280]  Declaration of Independence says they send out swarms of officers
[25:08.280 --> 25:12.280]  that's a quote to eat out our substance
[25:12.280 --> 25:16.280]  and I mean you see brand new trucks you name it
[25:16.280 --> 25:19.280]  I mean I'm not talking about a truck with rocks coming out the back
[25:19.280 --> 25:23.280]  or bailing wire whatever truck police should be going around looking for stuff like that
[25:23.280 --> 25:28.280]  but no sir they just and forget having a way station like the state police do
[25:28.280 --> 25:32.280]  they just imagine the state police just block the highway well they do that now
[25:32.280 --> 25:36.280]  and just search everybody you know what we're not just going to search people that have opted
[25:36.280 --> 25:40.280]  into the commercial licensure we're going to do it to everybody but now let's go pick the busiest
[25:40.280 --> 25:44.280]  spot in Austin and let's pull trucks over for 30 minutes to an hour
[25:44.280 --> 25:48.280]  we were timing it they would just stack up dozens and dozens of trucks
[25:48.280 --> 25:53.280]  wave them in and and then I've talked to truck drivers
[25:53.280 --> 25:57.280]  over the years and they talk about when they can't find anything they get mad
[25:57.280 --> 26:01.280]  because they're writing everybody tickets I mean if they say oh the oil's down a little too much
[26:01.280 --> 26:06.280]  or oh there's dust on your bumper or this tarp wasn't perfectly tied down or
[26:06.280 --> 26:11.280]  this you know let me see your maintenance log and it is white glove inspection
[26:11.280 --> 26:16.280]  and then they just write you $500 $700 thousand $2,000 tickets
[26:16.280 --> 26:21.280]  and it's all and the companies don't care they don't lobby for their drivers
[26:21.280 --> 26:25.280]  because the drivers pay the ticket they get three or four of them they just lose their license
[26:25.280 --> 26:30.280]  we just get somebody else to lower the wages that's how America works it's a
[26:30.280 --> 26:34.280]  it's a race to the bottom but after all we didn't build America government did
[26:34.280 --> 26:39.280]  there's a compilation of hilarious humor that we're going to
[26:39.280 --> 26:44.280]  cover later in the broadcast of for prisonplanet.tv viewers but I'll describe them
[26:44.280 --> 26:51.280]  to radio listeners and now Obama has been forced to respond to this saying he was taken out of context
[26:51.280 --> 26:56.280]  no he wasn't he said the government built whatever you have built
[26:56.280 --> 26:59.280]  humor you didn't build that it's up at infowars.com
[26:59.280 --> 27:03.280]  the compilation that Aaron put together of all the great art out there
[27:03.280 --> 27:06.280]  where he tells the Wright brothers they didn't build it
[27:06.280 --> 27:13.280]  he tells well me just everybody they didn't build jack diddly squat so that's up there
[27:13.280 --> 27:18.280]  but again the average cop is told hey we got a shortfall of money
[27:18.280 --> 27:22.280]  you got to get out there and write more tickets and I've heard the local Austin police chief
[27:22.280 --> 27:25.280]  oh we need hundreds of more you know police officers because the city's growing
[27:25.280 --> 27:31.280]  no you don't you don't need any and you shouldn't we don't need to hire one police officer in this town
[27:31.280 --> 27:34.280]  because let me tell you what they're going to be out there doing
[27:34.280 --> 27:37.280]  they're going to be out there writing tickets all day long
[27:37.280 --> 27:42.280]  and they're going to be out there helping the CPS take people's children
[27:42.280 --> 27:46.280]  and they're going to be out there helping induct people in the public schools into the prison system
[27:46.280 --> 27:51.280]  and so no we don't need hey hey mayor Bloomberg you said the police should all go and strike
[27:51.280 --> 27:55.280]  you know what I like that idea I like that because all the cities where you're in control
[27:55.280 --> 28:00.280]  your big Chicago mafia New York mafia the cess pitch you've created
[28:00.280 --> 28:05.280]  will burn in days your people your precious little dependence
[28:05.280 --> 28:09.280]  your criminal class that you've nurtured and created to vote for you
[28:09.280 --> 28:13.280]  and to menace those of us that produce they will burn your filthy cities
[28:13.280 --> 28:20.280]  your demonic cities to the ground so good go on strike okay please please go on strike
[28:20.280 --> 28:24.280]  okay please I call your bluff you mafia trash
[28:24.280 --> 28:28.280]  people say man that's now Jones is calling a criminal and trash
[28:28.280 --> 28:32.280]  I told you he should be arrested yesterday everybody ran around and found out the point
[28:32.280 --> 28:35.280]  that it is criminal and he's had to respond and said oh he didn't mean it
[28:35.280 --> 28:40.280]  you are a filthy criminal who wants to tell us what we can eat what we can drink
[28:40.280 --> 28:45.280]  what we can do wants to ban popcorn in New York this is a degenerate control freak
[28:45.280 --> 28:49.280]  you're like well that sounds crazy no it's not crazy they want to tell you what to do
[28:49.280 --> 28:53.280]  this is gangsters breaking our back and let me tell you something punk
[28:53.280 --> 28:57.280]  it may fly in places like Manhattan and it may fly in Chicago
[28:57.280 --> 29:01.280]  and it may fly in LA it doesn't fly everywhere else okay
[29:01.280 --> 29:06.280]  we're not all idiots we know a crook when we see one we see a thug piece of trash
[29:06.280 --> 29:12.280]  maggot gangster we know what you are and we're not your property and we're tired
[29:12.280 --> 29:16.280]  of running this country into the ground let me tell the police something you think
[29:16.280 --> 29:19.280]  when they put a 20% carbon tax on California last year that helped them
[29:19.280 --> 29:25.280]  that state everyone's evacuating it the bankers want that now they could buy it all up
[29:25.280 --> 29:28.280]  don't you understand what you've let me tell you something police
[29:28.280 --> 29:33.280]  you're not helping society right in all these tickets do you understand that
[29:33.280 --> 29:38.280]  if you arrest somebody who's recklessly driving 110 miles an hour in traffic
[29:38.280 --> 29:44.280]  that's helping society riding truck drivers that can barely stay above water
[29:44.280 --> 29:49.280]  who work their butts off tickets and setting up checkpoints is not helping
[29:49.280 --> 29:56.280]  we're on the march the empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:22.280 --> 33:48.280]  www.silverlungs.com
[33:48.280 --> 33:52.280]  so let's get one thing straight all of you that serve this system and don't know what's really going on
[33:52.280 --> 33:58.280]  and haven't chosen a side or maybe you have chosen to serve the system and you'll follow any order you're told
[33:58.280 --> 34:06.280]  your little 10-star doesn't give you the authority to walk all over this country and treat us like garbage
[34:06.280 --> 34:11.280]  but the police aren't even the issue they're being ordered to be out there
[34:11.280 --> 34:15.280]  and I'm going to call Art Acevedo I got his cell phone number I'm going to call his office though
[34:15.280 --> 34:20.280]  and we're going to start shooting video out there constantly to just show how out of control this is
[34:20.280 --> 34:29.280]  and it's going on all over the country
[34:29.280 --> 34:36.280]  and they want everybody to know they're the boss they're in charge they'll shut down I-35 under a federal grant
[34:36.280 --> 34:40.280]  and back it up 20 miles if they feel like it
[34:40.280 --> 34:49.280]  it's just pure raw exercise of power over us because foreign larcenist criminal banks have seized control of the nation
[34:49.280 --> 34:57.280]  they're bragging in all their publications how pathetic and dumb we are and how they've set up an unelected technocracy in our face
[34:57.280 --> 35:03.280]  in fact I know I've got this new Obama clip and a bunch of others but guys pull up the CNBC I've played probably 20 times
[35:03.280 --> 35:13.280]  clips of where they go on for four minutes a month or so ago bragging that global governments here and it's run by mega banks
[35:13.280 --> 35:20.280]  who got a sin of this by fraud and then all the guests on the show agree we're slaves and only one says it's wrong
[35:20.280 --> 35:27.280]  by the way Ron Paul's audit the Fed passed the House overwhelmingly yesterday but the Senate just like last year's and try to kill it
[35:27.280 --> 35:34.280]  but the point is 20 years ago when Ron Paul was first in Congress he was in for one term and then kicked out as a libertarian
[35:34.280 --> 35:44.280]  and came back in 96 Ron Paul couldn't get one co-sponsor so here's the deal you can kill it now in the Senate all you want
[35:44.280 --> 35:51.280]  we've now identified as a big presence he said two years ago with fear and his new book admits it that they're in we're not looking at
[35:51.280 --> 35:58.280]  Romney and Obama and your little puppets we're not looking at David Cameron we're not looking at your front men
[35:58.280 --> 36:06.280]  whether it's Australia or Germany or the United States or Nigeria for that matter people now are looking at the special interest and we
[36:06.280 --> 36:13.280]  understand now here's the special interest because no one listens to them now we're out here saying it others are covering it when
[36:13.280 --> 36:21.280]  global government leaders call for global government the drugs report when when the head of the EU says we're setting up world government
[36:21.280 --> 36:28.280]  the drugs report links to it he links to the you know foreign paper we link to it so see they've been still saying it doesn't exist in the
[36:28.280 --> 36:33.280]  ADL and Southern Primary Law Center have been saying none of this exists and we're all insane we're evil and we're bad and
[36:33.280 --> 36:38.280]  they're telling police and you know intelligence communicates there's no global government there's no international bankers the
[36:38.280 --> 36:46.280]  fellow reserves not private lying to them lying to them and the police are finding out it's true so see now they've shifted from
[36:46.280 --> 36:53.280]  oh yeah there is a global government aren't we lucky private banks took over America they know best yeah we're slaves to them but
[36:53.280 --> 37:01.280]  it's really no big deal really really honest really let me explain something no amount of taxes no amount of tickets no amount of
[37:01.280 --> 37:09.280]  park fees no amount of any of it is going to save your big government the government could be fully financed on 30% of what it
[37:09.280 --> 37:13.280]  rakes in right now conservatively if you look at the comprehensive annual financial reports the real set of books that are
[37:13.280 --> 37:20.280]  public but the media doesn't talk about us nobody knows about it they want to implode things let me explain
[37:20.280 --> 37:27.280]  something when you raise taxes to a certain point less revenue comes in that's a fact they've known that for thousands of years
[37:27.280 --> 37:32.280]  the only time you raise them like this across the board with all the hundreds of little taxes and fees and fines that are
[37:32.280 --> 37:40.280]  tagged on everything you buy from natural gas to gasoline to the home to building materials to food everything
[37:40.280 --> 37:49.280]  entertainment medicine all of it and I've seen the briefings the police unions have written about it even in New York
[37:49.280 --> 37:54.280]  they've said we don't want to do this we've been ordered to really crack down and get people tickets if they sit on a park bench
[37:54.280 --> 38:00.280]  too long we know we've been told raise money we've been told crack heads we've been told they'd be imperious scare people
[38:00.280 --> 38:08.280]  this has come out because the crooks running things are mobsters folks and they act like mobsters and they want police to act
[38:08.280 --> 38:12.280]  like that now and they tell them get out there and raise money and you're not going to have a job you're not going to get
[38:12.280 --> 38:23.280]  promoted and they give them bonuses when they do it's designed to kill the country this is a organized
[38:23.280 --> 38:31.280]  corporate siege and Bloomberg led us in two days ago and now responded yesterday and goes I know it's illegal I was just
[38:31.280 --> 38:39.280]  joking no you weren't joking you told police nationwide to stand down and I welcome that you know why everywhere
[38:39.280 --> 38:46.280]  like Vermont and Texas and other places where people have got guns you're going to see a bunch of bad guys get killed
[38:46.280 --> 38:50.280]  when they go out and try to rob people because they will do it if the police stood down there would be an increase in crime
[38:50.280 --> 38:59.280]  but there'd be an increase in dead bad guys the open duck season but everywhere the globalists are in control with a bunch of
[38:59.280 --> 39:10.280]  lily-livered dependence behind eight locks the cities would burn to the ground and let me tell you that would be a blessing
[39:10.280 --> 39:17.280]  I don't want those cities to burn to the ground but that would wake everybody up when they saw the places where big governments
[39:17.280 --> 39:25.280]  in charge and people can't defend themselves good good I hope the New York police stand down you criminal I hope they do
[39:25.280 --> 39:34.280]  I hope they stand out in Los Angeles I hope they stand down in Chicago stand down in all your mafia cities because it's those
[39:34.280 --> 39:44.280]  mafia models in every case that are setting up this takeover they're the ones they're the they're the they're the enforcers
[39:44.280 --> 39:53.280]  they're the capos for the offshore bankers they come in and hire the lowest the low son of an ear gun terrorist
[39:53.280 --> 40:03.280]  or the Mossad blowing up buildings to blame it on their political enemies Rahm Emanuel mob chief of Chicago Obama CIA
[40:03.280 --> 40:12.280]  global double agent Russian agent coming Bloomberg totally corrupt all of them there's the headline Mike Bloomberg
[40:12.280 --> 40:19.280]  walks back comment the police should threaten to strike after Aurora see this is what they want they want to hold us hostage
[40:19.280 --> 40:25.280]  they already do that they already gauge all this in most cities and don't let the police go out and deal with certain crimes
[40:25.280 --> 40:34.280]  and have them revenue generating and tell them to leave certain neighborhoods alone so that it can be controlled
[40:34.280 --> 40:43.280]  there's a reason that the crime rates been so much lower in areas of the South and areas of the West because this mafia system didn't take over but now it is
[40:43.280 --> 40:52.280]  they gauge and control the crime in New York and Chicago and LA it's run folks I've had dinner repeatedly with the Vikings in Los Angeles
[40:52.280 --> 41:02.280]  the police gang ladies and gentlemen they know 9-11's an inside job they know all of this only the moron public doesn't know this okay
[41:02.280 --> 41:17.280]  let me explain that to you only the moron public doesn't know all this stop being morons
[41:17.280 --> 41:23.280]  you know I get up here and risk my life to call these mobsters the scum and trash they are believe me they don't like it
[41:23.280 --> 41:30.280]  because they need they're always saying lower the rhetoric don't don't don't because if we ever raise the rhetoric up to what it should be
[41:30.280 --> 41:38.280]  because these are scum you got to call it what it is they're done these crooks have gambled and all we got to do is call their bluff
[41:38.280 --> 41:44.280]  and I'm willing to hit the bar bar first ladies and gentlemen so you can climb over my corpse because these people have got to be beaten
[41:44.280 --> 41:48.280]  you understand that and that's the only spirit that's going to beat these people
[41:48.280 --> 41:57.280]  so many men out there you wonder why your lives aren't fulfilled with money or trophy wives or any of it you're not fulfilled because you're not fighting for freedom
[41:57.280 --> 42:02.280]  so many of our heroes go join the military because they have this desire to stand up for freedom
[42:02.280 --> 42:11.280]  they have this instinctive understanding but they're being misdirected into a simulation where they're even hiring the terrorist on the other side as a pretext to be there
[42:11.280 --> 42:19.280]  that's full spectrum dominance the globalist hire the terrorist the threat and then even send over our military so they can have the no bid contracts
[42:19.280 --> 42:27.280]  it's full spectrum dominance it's it's funding both sides it's bringing the drugs in and then putting people in prison that use them
[42:27.280 --> 42:37.280]  the globalists are all about full spectrum full spectrum full spectrum full spectrum and they have disarmed the entire world
[42:37.280 --> 42:48.280]  and they know the statistics that armed cities have lower crime they know it they know you got a better chance to be struck twice by lightning in one year than dying in a mass shooting of over five people
[42:48.280 --> 42:58.280]  they know all those numbers they're scared and I want to make the declaration here right now when you listen to this speech we're about to play a clip up from Obama yesterday
[42:58.280 --> 43:09.280]  you know Paul Watson wrote a great article that he says Obama finally caved into pressure folks that was his his minions softening up everybody that was his surrogates coming out saying ban everything
[43:09.280 --> 43:20.280]  single shot black powder like Michael Moore said and Bloomberg has said banned everything and his attorney general has said banned everything before when he was deputy attorney general and Obama has said it when he was a state senator
[43:20.280 --> 43:33.280]  those quotes are public in the record Obama has softened everybody up and now they've got Bill Crystal coming out on Fox and yeah ban all semi auto that's reasonable
[43:33.280 --> 43:43.280]  Rupert Marrocks come out and said ban them the whole system showing you because they all work for these farm banks that they know they're in trouble and they need a tyranny or they're all going to go to jail when this collapses
[43:43.280 --> 43:53.280]  it's going to collapse they've already triggered it you can't turn that around a slow continued collapse that they're going to orchestrate and pose the saviors and so they've got to get the guns down
[43:53.280 --> 44:00.280]  they've got to be able to arrest whoever they want go after judges and grand juries that try to go after them they've committed incredible crimes
[44:00.280 --> 44:10.280]  the entire power structure has now had meetings and said look we're criminals we got to go all the way a lot of us stole too much we intended to implode things but not this bad
[44:10.280 --> 44:19.280]  you know we've got to bring in charity and they've gone to the military and gotten them ready to do it at the highest levels
[44:19.280 --> 44:25.280]  that mean that they'll execute at the ground level that's why we got to get out there our lives depend on this right now
[44:25.280 --> 44:36.280]  Obama privately at that fundraiser we have the clip you've heard it talked about people that bitter clingers that cling their Bibles and their guns because they know they've destroyed all American culture
[44:36.280 --> 44:43.280]  they destroy culture everywhere it's a global corporatist plastic death culture that's hollow and dumbed down on purpose
[44:43.280 --> 44:51.280]  I mean they've admitted that this is their plan and many of the big think tank documents we've covered here
[44:51.280 --> 45:02.280]  and so there is that culture of the Bible not the fake churches but the Bible so he had a private meeting it's like we got to get the Bible and the guns
[45:02.280 --> 45:12.280]  because it's all that's left because the state has to be God you can't have citizens with their own responsibility in a nanny state taking care of themselves
[45:12.280 --> 45:20.280]  you've got to blame the hell that is New York and Chicago on the fact that other people are free and their guns are coming there where you don't allow guns to the criminals feed on people
[45:20.280 --> 45:30.280]  you can't have the world under your subjugation while the American people are still armed when everybody else has basically had their guns taken or is having them taken
[45:30.280 --> 45:39.280]  and he says here I understand he's trying to talk right to us he's given you real anthropology as a globalist CIA degree the whole nine yards he's sitting there saying
[45:39.280 --> 45:51.280]  I understand your culture I understand that he lies it's about hunting and stuff and we want to respect that but you shouldn't have an AK-47 and he ties the soldiers need that
[45:51.280 --> 45:59.280]  the soldiers tries to create that ho the soldiers mean ho if it's for soldiers we'll turn them in see the soldiers are on the streets of America
[45:59.280 --> 46:10.280]  the soldiers are fighting crimes the soldiers are the ones that deserve the guns they're the elite until they get out of the military they're the number one terrorist
[46:10.280 --> 46:18.280]  Obama's just department has stayed in their own training memorandums that we've covered here you know my act homeland security list goes on and on no secret
[46:18.280 --> 46:30.280]  think about how hard how far we've come and how much they've gotten away with and so now that's the drum from from everybody George Soros but the Republican leadership
[46:30.280 --> 46:40.280]  Mitt Romney believe me Bush support of the assault weapons ban we're talking about physical ban now they're like you do not need a semi auto you do not need a semi auto
[46:40.280 --> 46:49.280]  you are not going to get one you are not going to have one in fact we did find that original ATF and we'll put that on screen ATF to accept public comments
[46:49.280 --> 46:58.280]  prior to outlawing shotguns this was in the Greeley Gazette the Bureau of Alcohol tobacco this is their statement this is from the ATF tobacco and farms is taking a rare step
[46:58.280 --> 47:08.280]  of allowing public comments how gracious of them prior to issuing a decision on a study that could result in outlawing certain types of shotguns currently available to citizens
[47:08.280 --> 47:25.280]  and it goes on now this is from last year the ATF completed a study regarding the importability of certain shotguns the basis of possible ban is based on the loosely defined sporting purpose test
[47:25.280 --> 47:35.280]  they're saying it's not well it's not for sporting like Obama says using the vague definition almost all pump action and semi automatic shotguns could be banned as they are all capable of accepting a magazine
[47:35.280 --> 47:46.280]  stop right there this is the plan and by the way they want to send cops over when you don't turn your gun in to have a shootout with you they want to get a civil war going
[47:46.280 --> 47:56.280]  these are criminals that run the government they want all Hades to break loose and if we did turn them in well then they're really going to have their way with us
[47:56.280 --> 48:07.280]  this is real authoritarian tyranny trying to take over let's go ahead let's go ahead and let's play this clip of Obama listen to him
[48:07.280 --> 48:19.280]  oh you got a right to guns you got a right to a flintlock that's that's the you got a right to something that didn't send me on oh you got a right you got a right for us to take them
[48:19.280 --> 48:32.280]  that's what they're saying the Supreme Court decision means you got a right but we define what that is that's a locked up single shot in your in your gun case here it is
[48:32.280 --> 48:41.280]  I like most Americans believe that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual the right to bear arms
[48:41.280 --> 48:54.280]  then we recognize the traditions of gun ownership that passed on from generation to generation that hunting and shooting are part of it a cherished national heritage
[48:54.280 --> 49:06.280]  but I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[49:06.280 --> 49:13.280]  but they belong on the battlefield of war not on the streets of our cities
[49:13.280 --> 49:21.280]  I believe the majority of gun owners would agree that we should do everything possible to prevent criminals and fugitives from purchasing weapons
[49:21.280 --> 49:26.280]  let's stop right there we should check someone's criminal record shut that criminal up
[49:26.280 --> 49:33.280]  he ordered guns shipped into Mexico and Hangar and AIDS and a drug gangs in Indiana and Florida and Honduras
[49:33.280 --> 49:43.280]  this is a criminal who runs the criminal agency shipping drugs back in this is the titular head the figurehead saying we want to keep guns out of criminals hands
[49:43.280 --> 49:54.280]  they did that to blame the Second Amendment and there are instant checks with the FBI criminals can't buy guns they go rob your house for them
[49:54.280 --> 49:59.280]  and let me tell you they don't do that around here because they get filled full of lead
[49:59.280 --> 50:08.280]  they do that in cesspits criminal trash like you have wrecked let's go out to break with the traitor in chief Obama the enemy of freedom here it is
[50:08.280 --> 50:17.280]  before they can check out a gun seller that a mentally unbalanced individual should not be able to get his hands on a gun so easily
[50:17.280 --> 50:25.280]  let's pause a mentally unbalanced person like you that hates America and hates freedom and says businesses didn't build their own business
[50:25.280 --> 50:30.280]  somebody that would give the order to ship 20,000 guns and Hangar Nades into Mexico
[50:30.280 --> 50:35.280]  yeah you got the nuclear launch codes we've let a mentally deranged individual have those
[50:35.280 --> 50:40.280]  we're going to come back with the filth in chief the traitor in chief the puppet in chief the garbage in chief
[50:40.280 --> 50:45.280]  straight ahead if you think Mitt Romney is going to save you I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you
[50:45.280 --> 50:51.280]  I now have the White House attacking me through the surrogate grips as you know on a daily basis
[50:51.280 --> 51:00.280]  George Soros matters known as media matters and think George Soros progress known as think progress or calling for us to be shut down
[51:00.280 --> 51:06.280]  let me ask you a question what does freedom mean to you the freedom to choose the freedom to vote the freedom to worship

[54:29.280 --> 54:47.280]  the man comes to town and look out criminals we are back live listen I study these people will stand up I know who they are they are so evil and murderous and criminal
[54:47.280 --> 54:57.280]  these are the bankers that funded Hitler Stalin Mao you name it people are like why would they fund fascist and communist read Carol Quigley's book we sell at info wars.com top globalist historian
[54:57.280 --> 55:12.280]  and the CIA and Bilderberg archives he brags about it 1400 page book tragedy and hope how the mega banks would set up world government and how they've been funding fascist and communist to destroy free societies and how luscious at all this
[55:12.280 --> 55:15.280]  Bill Clinton's mentor.
[55:15.280 --> 55:31.280]  Bill Clinton isn't a communist Bill Clinton CIA we even know who his section chief was in London with Hillary the CIA though isn't American it's British intelligence which isn't British intelligence look who set it up this isn't even a secret it came out of the
[55:31.280 --> 55:48.280]  box and skull and bones British intelligence itself and Alistair Crowley in it for heaven's sakes it's Satanist it's a devil cult they get on their knees to Lucifer folks they like killing people and I know that sounds wild because you know what
[55:48.280 --> 55:51.280]  history is wild.
[55:51.280 --> 56:01.280]  People like why do they do all this horrible stuff because they like it ladies and gentlemen you just as soon die before you saw a small child hurt to them that's like Beethoven.
[56:01.280 --> 56:04.280]  Now let's finish up with Obama.
[56:04.280 --> 56:22.280]  And again you notice I'm coming out against them hardcore folks because they're moving fast I mean I didn't think they'd move this quick okay this is real we've got reports and videos coming in all over the country of armored battalions Marines army checkpoints I mean it's on the news it's going
[56:22.280 --> 56:37.280]  to come out I mean they are really acclimating and getting ready for something is it World War three is it total collapse and right in the midst of this when he set to sign that treaty maybe even Friday at the Olympics.
[56:37.280 --> 56:49.280]  I mean I mean this is it folks this is world government in your face and they're coming for our guns and they're seeing if we'll go along with it first chance they got Katrina they ran and took them you notice that was Bush because it's we've got the training
[56:49.280 --> 56:59.280]  all they do is train to take our guns the military is on record the military leaks where they're setting up reeducation camps and gun confiscation it doesn't even become a news item.
[56:59.280 --> 57:07.280]  It's on info wars dot com the army responds and goes yeah that's our document you shouldn't have that.
[57:07.280 --> 57:23.280]  There's a story of Ron Silver the late famous actor and Bill Clinton was being inaugurated it was the party that night that afternoon and jets flew over the White House and Silver got real mad because he's so anti military anti America you know just kind of a dumb low level
[57:23.280 --> 57:40.280]  minion of the system like really believes in all the socialism he goes how dare them do that they're threatening us and Hillary looked at him and said Ron there are planes now there are planes now and we've had a corrupt system for a while
[57:40.280 --> 57:56.280]  but let me tell you they got this thing hammered down accelerated right now and the old power structure has put Obama in there to take the fall for it and they got Romney up in the polls above him and all the major polls as the saviour
[57:56.280 --> 58:10.280]  that's probably the maneuver Obama into going ahead along with the new war I'm just telling you this strap yourselves in folks and I hope you just don't have front row seats to this I hope you're in the field getting the word out because
[58:10.280 --> 58:24.280]  let's go out to break with Obama talking about you don't want criminals with guns no all of the military should have them here it is check out a gun cell that a mentally unbalanced individual should not be able to get his hands on a gun so easily
[58:24.280 --> 58:39.280]  oh yeah people that don't like the government this airman Leo these steps shouldn't be controversial they should be common sense so I'm going to continue to work with members of both parties and with religious groups and with civic organizations
[58:39.280 --> 58:59.280]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network sick of the globalist you Genesis control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die start purifying your water with pro pure my friends I've done a lot of research
[58:59.280 --> 59:15.280]  and the best gravity filter out there bar none is pro pure and it's available discounted at info wars dot com its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth there's no priming required its NSF forty two certified optional fluoride filters
[59:15.280 --> 59:29.280]  can reduce fluoride up to ninety five percent easy to set up and use doesn't require electricity purify water from lake streams ponds and wells this filter system leaves in beneficial minerals which is key save money by not buying bottled water
[59:29.280 --> 59:49.280]  and avoid BPA that leashes from the plastic pro pure is the best gravity fed filter out there it's what my family uses info wars dot com already has the lowest price on pro pure but if you add the promo code water at checkout you get an additional ten percent off and info wars dot com you can also call the order 8882533139
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:26.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones you know folks know that i try to stay out of the political football issues
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:38.280]  of heterosexual homosexual black white you know all this stuff but when it's made political you got to cover it when they attack the first minute you got to defend it
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:52.280]  chicago alderman moves to ban businesses for politically incorrect views on gays that's franchise people that buy a franchise from chick filet which are going to fast food some of the best fast food out there
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:01:04.280]  and i'm not i mean i don't even eat i'd probably eat chick filet in two years i've stopped eating fast food entirely but when i'm out somewhere on the road i guess a couple years ago i would choose a chick filet
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:13.280]  you know what i'm going to go to chick filet now to i think today when i go home just because the owner said they don't support gay marriage
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:23.280]  he's a christian they're closed on sundays i've noticed that and all i know is they have really clean restaurants and for fast food it's about the best there is
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:33.280]  but oh my gosh the mob boss rama manual he says that you just aren't going to be allowed to be here in chicago
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:46.280]  maybe you go knock their windows out next because you don't agree with their views see this is saying you can't have a business if you don't agree with us these are terrorists i mean rama manual wants to tell you what you can eat
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:53.280]  so does bloomberg so does hillary clinton so does mrs obama these are control freaks mr sterrow
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:02:09.280]  and we've got a top story curtain mo chicago alderman moves to ban businesses for politically incorrect views on gaze yeah when the media reports that oh they're moving to block these these these homophobic businesses yeah you mean destroy i mean folks that's it
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:24.280]  see that is he why do they want to teach five and six year olds about sex period because i don't hate any of these people i don't even get into these issues except so many of these political groups it isn't even about their sexual preference it's about
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:36.280]  running our lives and getting our kids heads let me tell you something i don't care what you're into you try to teach kids about this stuff you're a pervert you're a jerry sandusky and i've had enough of it
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:49.280]  i mean that's the thing is that i don't individually like to sit here and bash groups but when the fruits of something are so bad
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:58.280]  well just look at our society it's collapsing just like the bible says and that's what's going on and now it's we're going to shut your business down
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:11.280]  isn't what you said let me tell you that is incredible so i'm calling for everybody to support chick filet folks i put out a video yesterday about rippon murdoch clearly being blackmailed calling for gun control and all this
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:23.280]  and i said i don't like news corps they've had they've done some dirty tricks to me before and you know they're globalist but suddenly he's endorsing carbon taxes world government turn your guns and they're arresting the heads of news corps they're
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:37.280]  talking to the justice department's talking about arresting rippon murdoch if they do that they want to shut limbaugh they're going after they can get them folks they can get anybody that's the point a government that ships guns into mexico
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:52.280]  billions to these energy companies that don't exist all these mafia ties all this corruption and they're investigating rippon murdoch for hacking people's phones when government agencies illegally do it every day and i'm not saying that's
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:04:04.280]  okay if they were indicting the head of the nsa hayden if they were indicting all these people if they were all going to jail i'd be like all right now get rippon murdoch this is selective enforcement against the media and it's
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:13.280]  dangerous and i see people on my site going i thought ellis was nonpartisan he's obviously a republican shill i hate him now because he's he's defending rippon murdoch
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:27.280]  if bush had been going after the media like this i would defend even though it's not really media and it's george sorrell's front if people were trying to shut down that i would defend it even though it's not even a media organization
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:43.280]  it's a foreign agent a foreign banks it should register as a foreign agent the whole government should register as a foreign agent here in america these foreign banks all of it russia's made them register it's true america isn't for the americans anymore it's for foreign

[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:34.280]  well for all of our great radio listeners out there we've got a real treat Dave Mustaine the founder of mega death of course one of the first guys there in metallica is here with us in Austin Texas it's always great to have a Dave stop by Dave why are you in Austin Texas
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:49.280]  well the truth is we're planning on moving to Texas and so we're just out here house hunting and it wouldn't be right if we didn't stop by and check in with your viewers and your listeners and see you and hang out
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:09:07.280]  we consider you a close friend and it's just the right thing to do especially with everything that's going on right now you know last time we came through we kind of talked a little bit about my world and we didn't really talk about the world in general which you know I think a lot of people that tune into your program
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:26.280]  they want to know what I think about you know what they believe and not just what I do for a living and how my work is and the people that are in it although that's really interesting to a lot of people doesn't really touch on a lot of the topical subjects that affect us all you know not very many people are going to be a rock star for 30 years
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:41.280]  Dave I'm not kissing your ass here but I've met a lot of famous people and they've always got something magic about them success people are successful for a reason because they have passion they have dedication they have a lot of art they want to express but so many of them really are arrogant and disconnected
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:10:00.280]  and what I've noticed is that you are so real and down to earth and then there's that media image that we're told about Dave Mustaine you know which they kind of claim is the opposite of that but I've just found that you are a real down to earth guy who really cares about average people and quite frankly opens doors for little old ladies
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:19.280]  Well I think that's just like anything you know there's a counterfeit for everything and I think a lot of people you know the way that they spin stuff in the liberal media they have a counterfeit to what the truth is and I think that there's a lot of people who have asked me to do certain things and it's been against my morals and when I say no
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:32.280]  instead of them accepting that they walk away and they say stuff about me it's kind of like when you go to the dance and you walk up to some girl that's really hot and you ask her to dance and she says no for whatever reason you walk away and you're like well F.U.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:53.280]  And you fill in the blanks and you tell folks she's got cooties. Yeah right right right in a much more colorful way and for me a lot of that is it's funny to read some of it's a little bit disappointing it started to bother me when my kids started to read it
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:11:02.280]  but it's just the way the world right now there's a lot of cowards that sit on the other side of computers and type stuff that they would never say to your face.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:18.280]  We were talking about that last night about how in the old days if you said something about somebody they were going to come track you down I mean you were going to have to defend that and that is something entirely new where people could just anonymously make up the most amazing stuff
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:30.280]  I have one of my crew bring me something today that was online claiming I'd committed all these crimes and I just kind of laughed at it but five six years ago I didn't understand how the web worked I would have gotten really mad.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:45.280]  Right right. But I mean how do you deal with that because people can just I mean you're a superstar people can. I'm not running for public office and I don't have my opponent saying that I'm a felon so you know it's a little bit easier for me most people say stuff like I can't play guitar very well
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:53.280]  I can't sing very well or you know they'll make fun of my name or stuff like that so they don't really bring up my past because.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.280]  You make fun of the cool name like Mustaine?
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.280]  Well there's probably a lot of ways that people can make fun of.
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:07.280]  I think they're just jealous Dave but you just alluded to something and again we've already talked about some of this you know driving over here to the studio.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:26.280]  Yeah I saw that last week you're alluding to I'm not claiming Mitt Romney some great guy I'm not in love with him but I mean come on the guy has no criminal record not Chicago mafia left Bain in 99 and Obama's out there got his people calling him a felon excuse me Obama you got a lot more skeletons than Romney your comments.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:45.280]  See here's the thing I'm 50 years old now and I've lived a great life and I've been around for a long time and most of our fans or most of the people who are against me are very young and they're very impressionable which is a part of being young.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:56.280]  That's saying that youth is wasted on young people or whatever that's totally true I remember when I was really young I was very impressionable and I believed a lot of things before I checked it out.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:10.280]  And if I would have been told in the things that I do now are going to affect me later on in life now I would have probably said something like well I don't know that I'm going to live that long but now that I'm 50 and I've watched so many administrations come and go.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:16.280]  And I'm watching my children grow up which is an awesome part of by the way you've got incredible children.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.280]  Thanks.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:32.280]  It's an awesome part of when a man and a woman marry and have children to watch them grow up there do you have concerns about stuff like that and sometimes our fans that are younger they look to me as a big brother or even a father figure because I really care a lot about them.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:44.280]  But I have never been more terrified in my life about what's happening to our country and I believe that if we continue on the same path that we're on right now that America will never be the same.
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:14:00.280]  I freaked out the other day because I was looking at some investment stuff and just reading it and one of the things that it said was that if you get a second passport and you plan on moving out of the country if you denounce your citizenship because of the taxes that are going on here
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:23.280]  or any of the things that are going on like the police state we've become that if you want to get your passport back you have to know things like where did your mom where'd she live before you were born all the way up to now where did she go in for prenatal care who was in the operating room when you were born.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:29.280]  Oh it's even worse than that they've introduced a law where if you move somewhere it's just over you can never come back.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.280]  They've introduced a law and they've introduced a law which is close to passing.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:37.280]  People can look this up if you're listening this is not a joke I mean I feel like it's not a joke.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:45.280]  I feel like I'm lying and this is like associated press because it's so crazy it's not America like having the president bad mouth you know you didn't build your business we're going to talk about that in a minute Dave.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:53.280]  But they actually came out and said that if the IRS claims you haven't paid all the taxes no proof no court you can't leave.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:59.280]  Well a friend of ours who just it's a wonderful lady that's friend with my wife and her husband who's Canadian.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:07.280]  They wanted to go back up to Canada they wouldn't let him go because there was a tax lien on their house because of a contractor who had done some shady work and they didn't want to pay him.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:14.280]  So the guy put a lien on their house and they're in court right now but they couldn't even go up to Canada to go visit their relatives.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:21.280]  Incredible so it's already being put into place so the clock is closer to midnight than we thought but.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:36.280]  Well here's another thing before we get off of this again looking at these financial things because you know I've got I'm you know filling out my will and everything right now because you know I'm nearing the end of my life and hopefully I'll live a long long time but I have to face reality you know.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:49.280]  I'm getting at that age where a lot of men you know make that journey either to heaven which I think I'm going to or some to hell and I was looking at this thing and it said that you cannot open a bank account out of the United States of America anymore.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:55.280]  You move to England and say I live there for the rest of my life if I open a bank account there they have to notify the United States.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.280]  Yes.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:01.280]  So that the United States can continue to tax me even if I don't live in the United States anymore and I thought this is crazy.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:11.280]  Well America's been taken over by this global government it is insane it's not America anymore when these globalist interests take us over and overthrow our bill of rights and constitution.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:24.280]  But just to have you repeat what you told me off here about the point about again Romney is being called a criminal by Obama and meanwhile Obama is engaging all this stuff.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:40.280]  It's sad it's sad you know when you look at Pelosi read in Obama they got to remember it's we the people not we three people and and the I am absolutely stunned that you know Bill Clinton was going to be impeached for having
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:51.280]  an inappropriate behavior with one person yet these three are screwing the entire nation and the world and nobody's doing anything about it.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.280]  I don't understand why there hasn't been a motion to impeach the guy.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:03.280]  Well your point right before I went live here was that you've got a fast and furious you've got salandra you've got all this corruption.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:10.280]  It's openly going on and then there's and then the media is like Romney's a felon and again it's not that Romney's perfect.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:16.280]  It's just that this guy calls the police on his neighbor when they're smoking pot in the backyard.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:21.280]  I mean he's not he's not shipping guns to Mexico to blame it on the Second Amendment.
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.280]  I mean it's just let's shift gears to that.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:35.280]  What is your take on fast and furious and then tying it in to this new event this tragedy right next to Columbine in Colorado outside Denver.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:43.280]  This tragedy that happens a week and a half before Obama says he'll sign the UN treaty and he's trying to get Congress to ratify to register and ban a bunch of our guns.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:18:09.280]  Well I had heard about this a while ago and I had hoped that it was just just rumor but you know while we were on stage we have a song called Guns, Drugs and Money that we play and I had gotten so offended as an American that the president had exercised his executive privilege to cover up somebody who Eric Holder who you know to me I believe that if you're held in contempt
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:21.280]  and you have documents that are going to either exonerate you or you know put you in jail you know why hide them if it's going to get you off the hook.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:31.280]  So that to me is really mind blowing and you know I guess it's been proven that it was it was staged to restrict the Second Amendment and it's not just that.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:43.280]  The crimes that it appears that is taking place and when you look at the Constitution there's something in the Constitution where you have to get congressional permission to go to war.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:51.280]  And if you don't get congressional permission there's a clause in there where you have a certain amount of time after that where you have to get permission to go to war.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:58.280]  And to my knowledge when we went into Libya that didn't happen and it still hasn't happened.
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:05.280]  No you're right in fact if there's some emergency he's got a couple months but then after that you've got to go get the congressional approval they control the purse.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:15.280]  And they sent in the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the other generals, the secretary of defense, Panetta and Obama put a letter out and Congress said hey you got to get approval from us.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:22.280]  He said no I get it from the UN in NATO put a letter out and they had him go before Congress we played the clips on the show they're so incredible.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:31.280]  And I think that woke up the military and police more than anything I've seen now if I go downtown Austin the cops should stop and go you were right we apologize.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:43.280]  Alright ladies and gentlemen we're going to come back with more of this exclusive premiere of the Dave Mustaine interview that I did here in studio after the show last weekend.

[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:16.280]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.

It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:23.280]  I think when I was in Virginia, Bullhorn and Boulderburg, the cops were on our side to come over and go, no, we saw that. Yeah, they told us that. I mean, think about that. I'm getting chills right now, Dave.
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:43.280]  What bothers me the most about it is the fact that they have these shills that are going on all of the programs defending this fast and furious thing. And Brian Terry lost his life and his family. You know, you can try not to watch TV, you can try not to look at the newspapers, but you see this stuff.
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:57.280]  And it must be devastating to see your own president just kind of sliding this whole thing under the rug. And the thing behind all of this is that it's not going to stop.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:16.280]  You know, when we go through traveling through all the different checkpoints over through Europe, before all the globalization was taking place and each country had its own border and they had their own language and stuff like that, you'd come up to customs, you'd go to the border, you'd have to stop and hand in their passport and stuff like that.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:29.280]  And now you just kind of roll through there. But when you come to your own country, it's harder to come home. It's harder to go through an airport here in the United States of America than it was for us even in Moscow.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:45.280]  We just got back from Moscow and we rolled through there so fast. I was laughing about it because we got out of the plane through customs, got our luggage and we're in the vans rolling to the hotel for the show faster than we get through customs when I come home to the US.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:26:04.280]  We're not as free as we thought and what's amazing is, it's on the news, Obama legalized a bunch of illegals and when they do fake stings of businesses and stuff, they just release them and they're now telling sheriffs all over the country that they are not going to pick up illegals that they arrest, even if they're committing crimes.
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:19.280]  I don't know anything about that, but I do know that from the people that we've spoken to that are Latino, that we have a huge contingency of Latino fans here in Texas, all over New Mexico and Arizona and California,
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:35.280]  Central and South America in Spain and a lot of the neighboring countries around Spain that are still Spanish speaking fans and they have relatives that are here whether they're legal or illegal and they know that this was a move to get votes.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:41.280]  They know that. The one thing that you can't make just because they don't speak English doesn't mean they're stupid.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:46.280]  Exactly. Well, they've had a lot of tyranny in Latin American countries. They're certainly more savvy in many ways.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.280]  Yeah, they are.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:27:01.280]  Finishing up with fast and furious. If Obama can get away with shipping close to 20,000 guns and hand grenades into Mexico and guns into Honduras and then states like Florida and Illinois to drug gangs for whatever reason.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:05.280]  I mean, my gosh, what are they going to get away with next? I mean, it really is creepy.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:17.280]  I do know this. It's really it's amazing how our liberties are being taken away from us. It's like the frog in the pot of boiling water. You know, if it was boiling water when he jumped in, he jumped back out.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:23.280]  But they slowly turn the temperature up the frog will stay in there until he boils to death. And that's what's happening to us right here.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:30.280]  We don't know what's going on. A lot of the American people are so busy working their asses off to make ends meet right now.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:38.280]  They don't have time to sit in front of the news and the news is such a pablum. It's it's it's opium for the masses and and it's stuff that you want to feel good.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:47.280]  See, the thing that I laugh about when I hear Obama say, give the folks a chance, give give everybody a chance, you know, take away from the rich people.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:54.280]  Well, what happens when the folks that he's given a chance gets a chance, becomes successful, is rich?
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:28:03.280]  Well, then all of a sudden, you're Obama's enemy now. And the thing for me is that, you know, I'm in that 1% that that he's talking about.
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:11.280]  Megadeth won't be able to tour anymore once all these things that he's planning on doing to me happens on top of the fact that we've talked privately.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:16.280]  You said, listen, after all the taxes and everything, I'm getting like 20% of it. If they do this, it's over. Yeah.
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:22.280]  And that's what happens in Venezuela or Russia. They don't get it. Once you cut out that small profit margin, it's over.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:31.280]  It's done. It's done. And the fact that he would say that I did not build my own business, offends me tremendously. I'm disgusted with this guy.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:45.280]  And, you know, he's my president. You know, I respect the office of the presidency, but I think as a person and the things that he says, I've never heard anything this offensive ever come out of the mouth of a president.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:54.280]  And I'm 50. I've heard a lot of presidents talk in my life. And, you know, listeners out there can say what they want about me or be mad at what I'm saying right now.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:59.280]  And I'm saying this out of love for you guys. You know, you may not have love in your heart for me, but I have love in my heart for you.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:09.280]  And that's why I'm a public figure and I play music. I try and educate people through lyrics. Some of the songs could be construed as being a little bit, you know, unrealistic.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:15.280]  You know, some of the songs are a little bit fine.
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:23.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back with more of Dave Mustaine exclusive in-depth political hardcore interview.
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:31.280]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones. We are live. It is the 26th of the day on this Thursday of July, 2012.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:42.280]  This is the center of our Lord, and tyranny is running wild right now. Christians are now to have their businesses taken by Obama. We'll be right back.
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:50.280]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-fighter, tell them that God's gonna cut them down, tell them that God's gonna.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:30:00.280]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:04.280]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:09.280]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:15.280]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:20.280]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:24.280]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:31.280]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.280]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:40.280]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:45.280]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
