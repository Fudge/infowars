[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  Riding up, straight to the top And the gut got the glory
[00:16.000 --> 00:23.000]  With the distance now I'm not gonna stop Just a man has to build to survive
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.000]  It's deep, high up the tiger With the thrill of the fight
[00:28.000 --> 00:36.000]  Riding up to the challenge of our livers And the life of survivors must be crazy
[00:36.000 --> 00:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, May 13th, the year is 2021
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  And the world is awakening Top brass in Europe
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  The United States, Russia, Brazil, the UK All over the Canadian military
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  Our warning of a communist Chinese takeover Allied with big mega banks, Hollywood
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  And the leftist system This is the globalist takeover
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  But, top brass across the world Are accurately laying out what's happening
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  Both current and former military There is a purge of the West
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  A purge of capitalism, a purge of Christianity And what has made us successful
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  By the globalist takeover
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  Very good news, but first, an extremely concerning report by Greg Reese
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.000]  Here is Greg Reese's report, and we'll be right back to kick off the main transmission
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  Stay with us
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  For those of us who still have a survival instinct
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  The COVID-19 vaccine has been nothing but red flags from the start
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  An experimental mRNA cocktail that rewires yourselves at the genetic level
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  Everyone is supposed to get it
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.000]  All negative comments are censored
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.000]  Those who question it are shamed and attacked in the public
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  And all this for a manufactured pandemic
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  Created via headlines, pop culture talking points, and government shutdowns
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  On a certain level, the whole thing is undeniably a psychological test
[02:12.000 --> 02:20.000]  With all these blatant red flags, are you so compliant that you are willing to submit and take the shot?
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  Or are you driven by an independent instinct to survive?
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  The normal healthy response would be to question this
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  Now we have reports of people dying after getting the vaccine
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  Painful side effects are becoming normalized
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  And there are other side effects being reported, strange ones
[02:44.000 --> 02:53.000]  Several people have been claiming that magnets are sticking to the injection point on their arm after getting the COVID vaccine
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  Is there something metallic inside the vaccine that's strong enough to hold a small magnet?
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Vaccines come with inserts loaded with small print
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  Known famously for some listing autism as an adverse reaction
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  The inserts for the COVID vaccine are intentionally left blank
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  So we have to search outside of the box
[03:18.000 --> 03:26.000]  A quick search will find reports on manipulative magnetic nanomedicine as the future of COVID therapy
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  And superparamagnetic nanoparticle delivery of DNA vaccine
[03:32.000 --> 03:39.000]  The first gap both the transhumanists and techno tyrants need to bridge is the interface
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  The controversial chip
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  Some people these days have no problem having a computer chip implanted into their body
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  But many of us prefer to remain without
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  Are the magnets responding to some sort of fluid metal computer nano chip?
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  Who knows?
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  The trials are happening now, the public being used as lab rats
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  Some people are also claiming that the vaccinated are giving off high EMF waves
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  Above 400 for the vaccinated
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  At least 10 times higher than the unvaccinated
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  What does that even mean?
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  Similar to how thousands of women have claimed that having contact with the vaccinated
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  Has resulted in having problems with their menstrual cycles
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  Some are now claiming that having contact with the vaccinated
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  Has caused mysterious rashes on their skin
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  The one thing we know for certain is say no to the vaccine
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  For infowars.com this is Greg Ries
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.000]  What we know for certain is there are hundreds of studies saying any coronavirus vaccine
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  Will cause blood clots, heart attacks, bloody lungs and of course Alzheimer's
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  Stay with us
[04:59.000 --> 05:04.000]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  Where are most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.000]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.000]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  That's why infowars is in financial trouble
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  Is because if we had the product you would be buying it, we'd have the money
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  But so many of them have been sold out
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  Just like you notice a lot of other items at the store aren't available
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  Because civilization is being artificially imploded
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  But finally X2 is back in stock with a good halogen
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  Deep earth crystal iodide so essential in your body
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  It's really the missing link, it's 50% off
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  We've got a big shipment of it at infowars.com
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  When it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  Take advantage of this now, stock up and don't forget to take your X2
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  Because I have a tendency to forget how great it is
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  And not take it myself but when I do
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  Stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible
[05:56.000 --> 06:20.000]  It's X2 at infowarsstore.com
[06:20.000 --> 06:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake, the entire planet is in the danger zone
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  And our species humanity has been lulled into a trance
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  So the psychic demonic spider of the new world order
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.000]  Can tie us up and then take its time to suck it us dry
[06:41.000 --> 06:46.000]  But they haven't gotten its tie completely down yet
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  In fact, we've got most of our legs and arms free
[06:50.000 --> 06:57.000]  We've got the sword of truth and that old spider is getting really, really scared
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  Alright, I've done a lot of preparation for this broadcast
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.000]  And this is just the stars are aligning, everything is insane
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  Let me tell you the big news first
[07:08.000 --> 07:15.000]  Obviously, we saw 120 former and some current generals come out
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  And say there's an overthrow of the United States taking place
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  We saw hundreds of former and current military officers in France come out last week and say that
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  A lot of former British and current brass has gone public
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  A lot of the Brazilian military at the top has gone public
[07:31.000 --> 07:36.000]  The Russians are coming out openly with the heads of government
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  Putin gives speeches about the anti-human new world order
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.000]  And how they want to destroy the family
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  So to at least three Eastern European leaders
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  Even the Southern Barbery Law Center says, and the ADL says it sounds like they're Alice Jones
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.000]  No, they're not Alice Jones, they're looking at the same thing
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  And so that's a really positive thing
[07:58.000 --> 08:05.000]  But what are the generals saying? They're saying there's a concerted asymmetrical attack
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.000]  On the culture, on the morale, on the infrastructure, on the energy
[08:10.000 --> 08:14.000]  On the health, on the very future of what's left of the West
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  Because these megacorporations have already collapsed completely and dominated the third world
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  And they're like gods down there
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  They want to export that and literally export the people that have been trained to be slaves here
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  For a completion of their takeover
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.000]  And that's in all the different globalist documents and the films and the books and the admissions
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  My goodness gracious, my film Endgame made 14 years ago has the whole battle planned
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  And they're like 80% completed what I say in the film
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  And that's how we can tell you what's coming next
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  I mean, everybody is on Twitter, it was trending yesterday and all over Facebook
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  My phone was ringing off the hook and family calling
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.000]  Going, how did you know, because the clips are out there a month ago and two weeks ago
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  And I said, they're going to cut off the plants and the pipelines
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  And they're going to claim that there's a natural blackout happening
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  And it's going to be coming by the summer
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  Well, it came earlier than I thought
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  People were like, how did you know this?
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.000]  They did this in Spain, they did this in California
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  They've done this in Latin American countries, they've done this in Africa
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  What do you think these globalists do?
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  They cut off the power and then they give you rolling blackouts
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  And charge you more for 10% of the power you would have gotten
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  They give you a 200 square foot apartment and you pay more than a thousand foot
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  It's a formulae of enslavement
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  And if you'll accept it, you'll live under it
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  It's making being enslaved fashionable
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  By the way, I tend to underestimate
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  Because I'll just go off the basic analysis I've done
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  And I won't sit there and think back over the years
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  But yesterday I'm talking about, oh, I looked it up
[09:58.000 --> 10:04.000]  Just in the last 115 days, Biden has shut down more than a thousand pipelines
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  And then a pipeline inspector called in, he said, Alex, there's a lot more than that
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  California just completely shut all their pipelines basically now
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  They just said, no, it's not renewable, you can't use it, including natural gas
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  But mainly oil and gasoline
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  You know how many pipelines that are in this country?
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  Hundreds of thousands, probably millions
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  I mean, of little spurs and pieces and connections
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  But thousands of big ones, and there, people freaked out when they saw that Whitmer
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  Is ordering Canada to shut down five giant pipeline connections
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  That is the fifth biggest in the United States
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  And they go, we have a treaty
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  This applies Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and then down to the Midwest
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  As far south as Kansas
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  Why the hell would you do that? It's totally safe
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  But Whitmer said, I'm scared, that's in the quote
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  I'm afraid it might leak someday
[10:59.000 --> 11:06.000]  It's all like, oh, they're ordered to do it by the globalists that own China
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  So that businesses only open in China
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.000]  So that they win the trade war against us and break our will
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  How do you take over a country? It's called siege
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  It's written about 6,000 years ago in the first tablet
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  Written by the tin, the Chinese
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  It's the first time we see the term siege
[11:25.000 --> 11:33.000]  And it's an image of a fort, Chinese character, with soldiers around it
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  That's just called siege
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  So people are like, how does Jones know he is all over there?
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  Jones must be one of them, and I'm getting scared
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  How the hell did he know that?
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  Because we're under frickin' attack
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  Of course I know what's coming next
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  We're under military attack
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  We're under military attack
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  We're under military attack, and all the brainwashed, weirdo liberals
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  And they've got two, three degrees that are worthless
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  They believe they're going to have a position in the new America, in the communist America
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  They've all been told they have Confucius Institutes
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  At all the major universities that teach Mao Zedong is good
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  They spray paint all over Austin that Mao Zedong is good, and Xi Jinping is good
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  And we're going to be crushed soon
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  They have giant marches with hundreds and thousands of communists with red flags every weekend
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  My oldest crew member
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.000]  I'm not going to say his name, he'll even let me hell
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  But he's the oldest crew member here, 18 years
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  His sister got multiple degrees
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  And now worships China and Xi Jinping and says she hates it and hates America
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  The Washington Post says Xi Jinping must destroy Trump to save America
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  They're Chinese globalist agents
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  They hate their own country
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  We're under attack
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  We're under attack, so
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  The good news is I have a giant stack of the military awakening
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  Now, that brings us to this next big issue, and I'm going to play this at the bottom of the hour
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  It's a big article at Town Hall, it's also on InfoWars.com
[13:06.000 --> 13:13.000]  U.S. vs. Russia, watch these two military recruitment videos and you'll quickly see why we're so screwed
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.000]  But I'm going to give you the rest of the story
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  With the weird CIA recruitment ads and the weird army recruitment ads
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  This will destroy the military, no SH-T Sherlock
[13:27.000 --> 13:37.000]  It's all naked, it's all obvious, it's all in your face, it's an admitted plan
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  They put you in a death camp in China if you're a homosexual, I don't think that should happen here
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  But they know that'll bring your society down
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  That's why China funds it here
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  You know, China owns four of the six big production houses
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.000]  When you see all this woke TV shows and woke movies and white people are evil and the blacks rise up
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  That's all a plan and it's in the WikiLeaks to break the country up
[14:03.000 --> 14:10.000]  And then the left will be the new clients that manage the collapsed U.S. that's merged into the EU and the communist China model
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  That is it, they have to first sabotage the military to make everyone not join the military
[14:16.000 --> 14:28.000]  Because it becomes a cesspit of SJWs and a mirror of what goes on in the universities
[14:28.000 --> 14:34.000]  You remember a couple of years ago they caught the head commandant of the Air Force
[14:34.000 --> 14:40.000]  Having the communist students under him put the N-word all over the walls
[14:40.000 --> 14:49.000]  They had black students do it, it's done everywhere folks, 95% of the N-word stuff and the crosses and the nooses and all that is put there by the left
[14:49.000 --> 14:56.000]  And they go have meetings and they do it to raise awareness and the general ordered them to do it
[14:56.000 --> 15:05.000]  You think Bubba Wallace just said that the ropes from the garage that everybody's got were nooses because he did that on his own
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  He got more sponsorship than he did, he was ordered to do it
[15:09.000 --> 15:16.000]  That show that Justin Smollett was doing had been popular, it was about to get canceled
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  It got re-signed and he got more money as soon as he stayed out of it
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  They're paid money to do this
[15:26.000 --> 15:35.000]  And so they're like, wow, this is a strong military, the left's so dumb, the left's not dumb, it's a scientific takeover operation
[15:35.000 --> 15:41.000]  So we got that stacked and we got the unbelievable force inoculation news getting announced in the U.S.
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  And then we've got so much, we've got a big broadcast lined up for you today
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  And I do intend to open the phones up and then we have a special guest in the studio I'll tell you about, a little bit coming up
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.000]  infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video, it is an active resistance to share those videos
[15:57.000 --> 16:04.000]  14 months ago I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses, the third world dies
[16:04.000 --> 16:10.000]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.000]  it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  Well now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States
[16:19.000 --> 16:26.000]  That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  Plus the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down, along with other pipelines
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  We're being shut down, our coal power plants are off as well
[16:36.000 --> 16:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave. The third world is imposing as well, the borders have been removed
[16:42.000 --> 16:47.000]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com takeover, Gregory said, you have, no hope
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.000]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family
[16:57.000 --> 17:03.000]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person, but because of the globalist and their attack on humanity
[17:03.000 --> 17:10.000]  I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure, and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me a break
[17:14.000 --> 17:21.000]  The Satanism's out in the open, and I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  And I get it, a lot of you have been turned off by big churches, a lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system
[17:27.000 --> 17:35.000]  And I get it, me too, believe me, I'm one of them, but it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created
[17:35.000 --> 17:41.000]  That is so essential, and God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  And so that's what InfoWars is really all about, so thank you all for your word of mouth
[17:45.000 --> 17:51.000]  Thank you for spreading the word about InfoWars, and thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting InfoWarsStore.com
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  Because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases, we'll be taking off the air
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.000]  So thank you for the support, InfoWarsStore.com
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  Alex Jones
[18:28.000 --> 18:35.000]  So, we're not facing the same type of warfare, the same type of attacks that our ancestors faced
[18:35.000 --> 18:43.000]  We're facing sophisticated, modern covert demoralization and actual poisoning
[18:43.000 --> 18:49.000]  With hydrophoresic acid in the water that lowers the oxygen mass and lowers fertility and causes Alzheimer's
[18:49.000 --> 18:56.000]  Without the studies on it here for you, we're being hit with poison vaccines that the Chinese and the Indians won't take
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  Latin America's taking them and they're dying too en masse
[18:59.000 --> 19:04.000]  We're being hit with a takeover by the globalists, allied with the Communist Chinese
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.000]  And now, here are some of the headlines, Generals warn
[19:09.000 --> 19:15.000]  Americans will die from Biden's full-blown assault on the Constitution
[19:15.000 --> 19:22.000]  I mean, that's the plan, we're being conquered, 124 retired generals and admirals questioned Biden's mental health
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  Well, he's just a puppet
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.000]  Here's the open letter, it's up on InfoWars.com
[19:28.000 --> 19:34.000]  Army Chief of Staff calls on French military who warned of Civil War to resign
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  InfoWars.com
[19:36.000 --> 19:43.000]  They're bad for pointing out the burning cities, the murders, churches being attacked every day, losing a church every week
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  African migrants suspected of murder, a sex attack, a 24-hour Paris rampage
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  This stuff breaks every five minutes
[19:49.000 --> 19:55.000]  Colin Kaepernick to publish essay pinned by convicted cop killer
[19:55.000 --> 19:59.000]  Who's going to come to his house when somebody attacks the police
[19:59.000 --> 20:05.000]  Antifa protester, I can't wait until black people lynch white people and the media promotes it
[20:05.000 --> 20:13.000]  Former MSNBC host justifies the death of white men punched by black team who died for reported racial slur
[20:13.000 --> 20:22.000]  Video, New York Professor warns basic education regarding America's founding being replaced with globalist indoctrination
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.000]  And now it's even mainstream news is calling it globalist, globalist, globalist
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  That's just some of what we've got here that's coming up
[20:31.000 --> 20:37.000]  Next segment I'm going to play those army recruiting ads for the US Army and the Russian Army
[20:37.000 --> 20:43.000]  And I'll show you the difference between the two, you won't really need me to show the difference, but the rest of the story
[20:43.000 --> 20:52.000]  I can show you every day the most brutal footage of black people beating, shooting and killing white people
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  We're not covering it up and we show it every once in a while
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  But I don't just show things to inflame people
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  But I think I might just put the last month together, couple hundred clips
[21:05.000 --> 21:10.000]  Think I might have Darren McBreen do it, just to show you this that's never on the news
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.000]  Versus if one white person does something wrong and that certainly happens
[21:14.000 --> 21:19.000]  And goes and shoots up a black church or goes and kills some Asian women or something
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  It goes on, it is put everywhere endlessly, why is that?
[21:23.000 --> 21:29.000]  It's not because the globalists love black people, it's because they are busy dividing and conquering
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  And they want to bully white people into submitting to the globalist agenda
[21:33.000 --> 21:40.000]  And they want to use angry, fired up black people brainwashed that it's moral and good to attack white people
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  I mean show the black guy beating the guy with a crowbar in Houston
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  Show all the Asians getting beat up by black folks
[21:46.000 --> 21:55.000]  And what's crazy is they put it on the news and they say whites are doing it
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  I mean this is just kids wrestling, I did some more stuff
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  I mean that's not really the most, that's some real stuff
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  But let's not even do this, let's not even go there
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  Because we're going to do it, let's actually show the current stuff
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  Like we had the computer yesterday, the black guy with the crowbar
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  Let's show people getting hit with hatchets, people getting shot
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  Let's just show what's really going on
[22:16.000 --> 22:22.000]  But the reason I talk about that is we're all under attack
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  I don't care what color you are or who you are
[22:24.000 --> 22:29.000]  But if you come from a collapsed country in Africa where it's kill or be killed
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.000]  And then you're shipped via a UN ship brainwashed that you're in all this free stuff
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  And it's going to be great and then you get there and it's not true, you're going to be pissed
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  And then you're taught by the media it's because white people oppress you, then you go out and you kill them
[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  This is all, and the UN admits this, this is how they're bringing down civilization
[22:49.000 --> 22:54.000]  They're collapsing, because the globalists have stolen thousands of trillions
[22:54.000 --> 22:59.000]  But it's not real money, and you've got your house, you've got your car, you've got your prosperity
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.000]  They want you collapsed so they can buy it all up and then dictate how you live your life
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  They want you in a 200 foot square apartment, they want you forced to be inoculated
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  Or you don't get your universal income, they want you dead
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.000]  And to do that they've got to position it where the middle class collapses into the third world
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  And this is a formulae, this is a feudalist operation
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  And so these generals warn of how we're being intentionally divided
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.000]  We're having our infrastructure destroyed, we're being intentionally bankrupted
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.000]  They want single mothers with children who are dependent
[23:34.000 --> 23:39.000]  Brought in by the millions to be wedded to the state
[23:39.000 --> 23:43.000]  And this is a corporate process of getting rid of all cultures
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.000]  And getting rid of the family and getting rid of every semblance
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.000]  So when we come back and play these army recruiting ads, and there's like eight of them
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  I'm not going to play them all, I'm going to play the lesbian one
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  And it's like her identity is that her mothers were lesbians
[23:57.000 --> 24:02.000]  She's probably, you know, CPS kidnapped or something, hypothetically most kids are
[24:02.000 --> 24:06.000]  And then they give them to the better family
[24:06.000 --> 24:14.000]  Kind of like over in the German government, they would take children from parents, Christian families
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.000]  And give them the convicted pedophiles, because they said this is the proper family
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  That's DW.com, mainstream German news, 30,000 children taken at least
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  Give them the convicted pedophiles because they said a man can give a boy the real love
[24:25.000 --> 24:30.000]  The German government actually had Nambla officially running it and said this is the true love
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.000]  Now I'm not saying two lesbian mothers or child molesters that are like Nambla
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  I'm not saying that
[24:36.000 --> 24:43.000]  What I'm saying is it's a process of harvesting nuclear family, heterosexual children
[24:43.000 --> 24:49.000]  And giving it to the two wonderful gay men, because they'll do a better job of the two wonderful lesbians
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.000]  Well, covertly in Europe, and now here as well, the children are given the convicted pedophiles
[24:53.000 --> 24:56.000]  You can look that up, I'm not kidding
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  Just type in 30,000 children given by German government
[25:00.000 --> 25:09.000]  And government social workers knowingly to pedophiles at age three to have a sexual relationship with the man
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.000]  They call it the ultimate love and the new family
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  Go read it for yourself
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  The North American Man-Boy Love Association is just one arm of it, they call it love
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000]  And that's what it is, and so they're harvesting us
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  But it's not these groups that run things
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  Their culture isn't freedom and Second Amendment and private property
[25:31.000 --> 25:37.000]  It's my identity is I had two mommies, and I'm in the army because I had two mommies
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  I'm obsessed with my pee-pee, I'm obsessed with my wee-wee
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  And so you're not into capitalism or freedom or Christianity
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.000]  Your identity is I came from people that can't biologically have children
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  With the other side of the species
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  Because that's for depopulation
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  So that's why the chemicals are put in the water
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  That's why the fluoride's put in the water
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  That's why this is all done is to depopulate
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  And you can say, well there's too many people, okay fine
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  I'm just saying you need to know why this has been done
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  You know why this is pushed, why they say this is cool
[26:11.000 --> 26:17.000]  It's so you don't procreate because the globalists want your genetic line dead
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  Alright?
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  And so that's why the chemicals are in the food and water
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.000]  That's why this is all done
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  I don't judge anybody for who they love or what they go on
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  I'm trying to explain why this is pushed
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  And the entire agenda around this and where this goes
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  And that this is designed to destroy the military, destroy its cohesion
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  And make us go to a pure robot military which the globalists will control
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  That will do horrible crimes because they will not refuse those orders
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  And that's the end game when we come right back on the other side
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  So taking the dysfunctional society they've got at the university
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  And injecting it like poison into the military
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  The world is awakening
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.000]  They are discovering the globalist, the elite, the manipulation, the CFR
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  The trilateral commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  The club of Rome
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  The truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Because they're actually losing
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  We have forced them out in the open
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  So as bad as these times are
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  A lot of negative things are about to happen
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  Realize humanity is winning
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  You've got to trust in the plan of God
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  And trust in the plan of God's justice
[27:38.000 --> 27:39.000]  That is invincible
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  That is ethereal, timeless and unstoppable
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  So trust in man, trust in God
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  To lead God and direct your soul
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  And then take action against the globalists and realize
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  You've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  We will never back down from the globalists
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  And we will never surrender
[27:57.000 --> 28:05.000]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  Has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  When you have high quality fish oil
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  We've got the best out there
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  And it costs us even more to put it through a process
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  To remove any trace mercury that's in it
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  So this is also clean at fish oil
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  Grill oil is set to sell out
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  It's amazing as well
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  It's at 25% off
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  But when you get them both together in a combo
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  It's 50% off as well

[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  It makes my dreams even more amazing
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.000]  Blizzard thought I was joking

[28:58.000 --> 29:01.000]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  For 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational
[29:05.000 --> 29:09.000]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  Their robot takeover
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  And others have been working across the planet for decades
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  To get ready for this, to be able to find it off
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  We have a real chance of defeating it
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  So prayer is essential, research is essential
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  Getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  And at the same time, supporting info wars
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  By buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  Because they're great products for you and your family
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  And they're also funding our operation
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  infowarstore.com
[29:45.000 --> 29:48.000]  infowarstore.com is incredible
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.000]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  Are back in like bodies, vasobites and others
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  So get them today at infowarstore.com
[29:55.000 --> 29:58.000]  And I thank you for being part of the resistance
[29:58.000 --> 30:00.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point
[30:00.000 --> 30:02.000]  It's very bittersweet
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.000]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would
[30:05.000 --> 30:07.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  I care about beating the new world order
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  And it's because we have so much credibility
[30:11.000 --> 30:14.000]  They can't allow us to stay on air much longer
[30:14.000 --> 30:17.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.000]  But let's just say this, we're going to see this through to the end
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  So please pray for us and please buy the products
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  And then infowarstore.com, they're great products

[30:31.000 --> 30:34.000]  And you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[30:39.000 --> 30:42.000]  When the whole world's waking up and looking for truth
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.000]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word
[30:50.000 --> 30:53.000]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[30:55.000 --> 30:58.000]  And the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[30:58.000 --> 31:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  Share those links to your email list
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  Greg Rees reports all of it is having a massive effect
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.000]  And the globalists are in trouble
[31:36.000 --> 31:39.000]  Senator Rand Paul was back on television saying
[31:39.000 --> 31:42.000]  Fauci needs to be investigated as developing this on purpose
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  And releasing it
[31:44.000 --> 31:47.000]  And so now we're getting very, very close to actually going after them
[31:47.000 --> 31:50.000]  They expected we'd have Stockholm syndrome completely
[31:50.000 --> 31:54.000]  And would never call them out, they're caught red-handed
[31:54.000 --> 31:57.000]  Paul says he could be culpable for the entire
[31:57.000 --> 32:00.000]  Pandemic, yes
[32:03.000 --> 32:06.000]  We're going to be covering that next segment
[32:06.000 --> 32:09.000]  But let's get to this, the divide and conquer strategy
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.000]  That you see, everyone's like
[32:11.000 --> 32:13.000]  Why, look at the Russians and the Chinese military
[32:13.000 --> 32:15.000]  Why, they shoot live ammo at their troops
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  Like the Marines used to do
[32:17.000 --> 32:19.000]  And they got them on 30 mile marches
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  And they're carrying heavier packs
[32:21.000 --> 32:24.000]  Than Russians and Chinese were just 10 years ago
[32:24.000 --> 32:28.000]  They're upping the rigors of it
[32:28.000 --> 32:30.000]  Whereas we're making the packs half the size
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  And changing women don't have to do pull-ups
[32:32.000 --> 32:37.000]  But all the Hollywood movies, the women are beating the guys up
[32:37.000 --> 32:40.000]  It's all fantasy land, it's not about empowering women
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  It's about a joke
[32:42.000 --> 32:45.000]  It's about sabotaging the military and the human military
[32:45.000 --> 32:48.000]  So it's so dysfunctional that robots have to run it
[32:48.000 --> 32:51.000]  That's the technocracy plan on every front
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.000]  Where we can't drive our own cars, can't have our own jobs
[32:53.000 --> 32:57.000]  Where we just sit back and the technocracy runs it all
[32:57.000 --> 33:00.000]  That's how the globalist plan on capturing us
[33:00.000 --> 33:03.000]  And then soft killing us with all these deadly vaccines on record
[33:03.000 --> 33:07.000]  And it's 2021, it's here, it's on
[33:07.000 --> 33:12.000]  No more just warning you about it, now you get to see it all in full
[33:12.000 --> 33:14.000]  And they think you're just going to submit to it
[33:14.000 --> 33:16.000]  So there's literally like 10 of these
[33:16.000 --> 33:19.000]  I went with horror this morning when I saw this to the YouTube channel
[33:19.000 --> 33:21.000]  They put out a whole bunch of these new ads
[33:21.000 --> 33:24.000]  And I watched three of them and I just couldn't watch the rest
[33:24.000 --> 33:26.000]  It was like okay, this is one about black folks
[33:26.000 --> 33:28.000]  Whites are evil, they were all mean to me
[33:28.000 --> 33:31.000]  America's horrible, but I've joined the military now
[33:31.000 --> 33:33.000]  So that I can be the man
[33:33.000 --> 33:35.000]  Let me click the Hispanic one, same thing
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  But here's the one about
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.000]  My identity is two women raised me
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  Okay
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  And then now I'm in the military to let you know
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  You're welcome to run the Patriot Battery Missile System
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  Not because of your aptitude, not because of your skill
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.000]  No, no, the number one thing is
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  Women marrying each other
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  Oh, but I thought once you had that
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  And it was legalized nationwide, you stop, no, no, now it's
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  Now we can marry our dogs, now we can marry three people
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  Now we're going to splice two men together
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  That's in the news, like we're two gay men
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.000]  We don't want to pay a woman to have a baby
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  That part her, we're going to have geneticists splice us
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  And you're wrong to not splice us
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  That's not going to be a human, they admit it
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  But see, medical experimentation, frankincense now
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  Sexy, because once you're, quote, augmented
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  You've taken on that identity, you've adapted to this
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  And you don't want anyone challenging you
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  The dad who gave birth, being pregnant
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  Doesn't change me being a trans man
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  You're a woman, you have a uterus, it's all lies
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  But the cult tells you to accept, no
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  Men have babies, no, a man comes in
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  In the US or England, there's been two cases
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  I've seen in the news, it's a thing they do
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.000]  And they say, I want a pap smear
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  And the nurses in both cases, one got fired, one got suspended
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  The guy has a beard, she said, tattoos, big man
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  Pulls his pants off in one report, she said
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  He had extremely large male genitals
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.000]  He spreads his legs and goes, check my cervix
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  She said, you're a man, boom, you're fired
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.000]  That's the cult, that's the cult
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  And that's why I remember back during the Democrat primaries
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  They had different, Democrats going
[35:23.000 --> 35:29.000]  I believe we need abortions for men
[35:29.000 --> 35:32.000]  It's a cult, it's a takeover
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  They wrote this up to sabotage it all
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  Yeah, there it is, yes, men need pap smears
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  Because a vagina is what a man asks
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  It's all just to scramble you
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  And I know you know that, but it's not a bunch of idiot cooks
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  This is a Tabistock Institute, this is CIA
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.000]  This is their plan to destroy America and the West
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  Because the West has ideas of freedom and justice
[35:55.000 --> 35:56.000]  And they don't want that
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  And once this runs its course, we're going to turn our back
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  On real freedom and become a fascist global society
[36:01.000 --> 36:02.000]  Those that are left
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  This is all going to be rejected
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  And it's going to make regular egalitarianism look bad
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  This is a trap
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  And the useful idiots are following it
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  Because they know they're getting power
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  And they think it's their time to shine and take over
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  They are the morons, the left are the useful idiots
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  So let's start getting to it
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.000]  Here is the cringe worthy
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  Absolutely out of control
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  Oh, by the way, a good recruiting adds a minute long
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  This thing's like three minutes long
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  We cut the intro and outro off because it's just nauseating
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  And I'm sorry you have to watch this and listen to this
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  But here it is
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  This is the story of a soldier who operates your nation's
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  Patriot Missile Defense Systems
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  It begins in California
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.000]  With a little girl raised by two moms
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  Rachel Maddo
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  Yuma
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  Although I had a fairly typical childhood
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  Took ballet
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  Played violin
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  I also marched for equality
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  I like to think I've been descending freedom from an early age
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.000]  When I was six years old
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  One of my moms had an accident
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  I left her paralyzed
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  Doctor said she might never walk again
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  But she tapped into my family's pride
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  To get back on her feet
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  I went and paused
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  This is an earlier generation
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  The new stuff, you don't say mom
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  You say birthing person
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  That's the next download
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  This is for the military to get used to this
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  To drive out all the people that are operating
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  In a normal human operation
[37:48.000 --> 37:49.000]  So they don't feel welcome
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  So they can collapse the military
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  These are weapon systems sent in to collapse the military
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  And not because she had two moms
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  The whole message is to say
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  We're not about war fighting
[38:00.000 --> 38:01.000]  We're about wokeness
[38:01.000 --> 38:02.000]  Let's continue
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  Standing at the altar to marry my other mom
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  With such powerful role models
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.000]  I finished high school at the top of my class
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  And then attended UC Davis
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  Where I joined a sorority full of other strong women
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  But as graduation approached
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  I began feeling like I'd been handed so much in life
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  A sorority girl stereotype
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  Sure, I'd spent my life around inspiring women
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  But what had I really achieved on my own?
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  One of my sorority sisters was studying abroad in Italy
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  Another was climbing Mount Everest
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  I needed my own adventures
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  My own challenge
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  And after meeting with an army recruiter
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.000]  I found it
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  Have they lowered the standards by 80%
[38:48.000 --> 38:49.000]  My own strength
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  And baby shatters and stereotypes
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  Now I serve the new world order
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  I'm US Army Corporal Emma Malone-Lords
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  And I answered my calling
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  And I'm gonna babysit robots while they kill you and your family
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  Because the people that were formed in the military
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  Wouldn't be part of that
[39:09.000 --> 39:15.000]  Alright, so that's all there is
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  Is that service to your country is not having a man in the house
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  We get it, men are bad
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  Okay, women are strong as they serve the state
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  You're married to the state, we get it
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  Be sure to take those vaccines and get that breast cancer
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  And you'll still love the state or get paralyzed
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.000]  You'll still love them
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  I love it, I want more, I wanna die
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  I love the state, I love the state, abuse me more
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  Now let's go ahead and show what the Russians are playing and showing
[39:36.000 --> 40:03.000]  This is the Russian recruitment ad
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  To recognize the boundaries of your abilities
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  To the fucking borders
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.000]  You're ready to break yourself
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.000]  Give me attention
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  Every day, pain is here
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  Shrooms all day
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  This is you who decided to prove something
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  The commander is here only to see the enemy in the day
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  Because without an enemy there is no battle
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  And without a battle there is no victory
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  But in fact
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  The main enemy is you
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  You're a witch
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  Your task is to follow the enemy
[40:29.000 --> 40:33.000]  To drive him away, to become better than he was
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  And to return to victory
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  Because tomorrow is your first day in my life
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  No games and no women
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  Of course the Russians were the first in World War II
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  To actually put a bunch of women in
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  If they could hack you then they could
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  It doesn't matter, that's because they were facing extermination
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  Only cowards put women in the military
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  In a human future, men are on the front lines
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  Blaming Russia with no evidence
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  For the shutdown of the East Coast Gasoline Pipeline
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  That goes from Houston right up through New York City
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  And supplies more than half of the gasoline to the East Coast
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  But who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  From Canada through the Midwest to Houston
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  To refine the oil that's then turned into gas
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  And simply the East Coast
[41:21.000 --> 41:24.000]  That's right, Joe Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  Right after it was completed
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  Joe Biden did that to America
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.000]  He has the history, he has the background
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.000]  He's the one that promised to get us off of fossil fuels
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  He's the one that's trying to extend the lockdowns of the country
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  That the New World Order wants a post industrial world
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  And they want the United States, Europe and Australia
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  Cripples of communist China can be dominant
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  It's not Russia that's the enemy
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  It's communist China and their millions like Joe Biden
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  In control of the White House
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  That's the facts, that's the information
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition
[42:09.000 --> 42:14.000]  Buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  Can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  Decrease the growth rate of plaque
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  And provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  In joints and the digestive system
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  Can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  And activity of immune cells
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  It worked for my family
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  And now I can have a logical and calm discussion
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  About actual facts that pertain to reality
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  At InfowarsStore.com
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  Two weeks ago, I launched a sale on all the high quality storeable foods
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  And prepare it with Alex.com
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.000]  And I pointed out that the Bloomberg Global Food Index
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  Shows that current crop purchases being made
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.000]  For the end of the summer when the crops are completed
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.000]  Around the world is up 76%
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.000]  That alone will cause civil unrest, major problems
[43:19.000 --> 43:22.000]  Since then, inflation has exploded in the last two weeks
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  Using the pipeline crises, using Governor Whitmer's shutting down
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  Or trying to shut down the pipeline in Michigan
[43:27.000 --> 43:28.000]  This is a concerted operation
[43:28.000 --> 43:31.000]  And so, Lister's had a huge response to our big sale
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  2020 prices in the year 2021
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  10% off all storeable foods
[43:36.000 --> 43:37.000]  Prepare with Alex.com
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  Now, the sale ended yesterday, so I'm now
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  Because a lot of requests extending it through Sunday
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  And that it absolutely has to end
[43:44.000 --> 43:47.000]  So, one month, three months, six months, year supplies
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  Highest quality water filters
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  And so much more, prepare with Alex.com
[43:51.000 --> 43:52.000]  It's the best food you're going to find
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  Of high quality storeable food for you and your family
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.000]  And your community

[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  The globalist feared this film made 14 years ago
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  It is the blueprint for their plan to figure the world
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  It is the blueprint for the great reset
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  It is in-game blueprint for global enslavement

[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  And if you take that action, I demand
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  You tell others you've given a copy too
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  That they make copies and share it as well
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  That will trigger distribution by proxy
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.000]  Meaning we the people cannot be stopped

[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  Is there something metallic inside the vaccine that's strong enough to hold a small magnet?
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  Vaccines come with inserts loaded with small print known famously for some listing autism as an adverse reaction.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  The inserts for the COVID vaccine are intentionally left blank so we have to search outside of the box.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  A quick search will find reports on manipulative magnetic nanomedicine as the future of COVID therapy and superparamagnetic nanoparticle delivery of DNA vaccine.
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  The first gap both the transhumanists and techno tyrants need to bridge is the interface, the controversial chip.
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  Some people these days have no problem having a computer chip implanted into their body, but many of us prefer to remain without.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  Are the magnets responding to some sort of fluid metal computer nano chip? Who knows. The trials are happening now, the public being used as lab rats.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  Some people are also claiming that the vaccinated are giving off high EMF waves above 400 for the vaccinated, at least 10 times higher than the unvaccinated.
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  What does that even mean? Similar to how thousands of women have claimed that having cancer.
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  See the full report at band.video, the magnetic mark of the beast. There's hundreds of these videos now.
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  Aaron Berg is a popular comedian. He also co-hosts stuff with Anthony Cumea. He's got his co-host, Geno, his content. It's also going to be coming in studio with him.
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  This is a surprise visit. I guess Anthony Cumea is the guy that's going to be on Joe Rogan down the street today. I love Anthony. I might actually come out and see you guys.
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  Where are you guys going to be doing your thing here in Austin?
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  Vulcan Gas Company. Three shows. One Friday. Two Saturday. Live podcast Saturday afternoon. Totally uncensored. The type of comedy that you would love and embrace.
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  Did you see how well I sold that?
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  You did a great job.
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  I made you smile. That made me happy.
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  No, but I like the fact that what is it like with comedy with the attempt at the Sovietization of America and the absolute destruction of free speech?
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  There's an echo chamber that tries to shut down what we do. It's this side of quote, unquote, cancelers that are usually failed comics or real like hardcore socialist people that go against it.
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  But when you come and see a live show and inevitably see these diverse audiences dying, laughing at what would be termed racism or misogyny, you realize it's all just made up and that people are just trying to stop people from laughter, which is a good thing.
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  Well, for me, I mean, it's obvious that they're bullies and big corporations that are running death camps in China like Apple are some of the biggest funders of Black Lives Matter.
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  They just want to cover that and have us all fighting over BS while they take the world over.
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  Yeah, but the thing is comedy is a rebellious art form, right?
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  Like I found out about you from Stanhope probably 20 years ago because of the nature of what he did and how you tied in with what he did.
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  It's about having the ability to be a free thinker and question everything when they try and shut you down.
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:53.000]  That's the exact same thing that they're doing to comedy, but they'll try and de-platform you even in live venues now.
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  Well, that's what folks have to know is there's literally no end to it.
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  Now, I have watched your show four or five times and I've also seen you on with Anthony Comey.
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  But what's different from your show because it's pretty funny versus what you do?
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  I mean, what is your avant-garde push-to-limit comedy?
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  Your show is satire in the purest sense. There's no lines.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  It's like shock, jock, radio, but video done in this way that nothing's off limits.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  We show everything that the sickest part of your imagination could fathom.
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  And stand-up, the job there is to push and make sure people know that this stuff is okay.
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  We have to push the boundaries. That's what we do as stand-ups.
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  So if people disagree with what I'm saying as a stand-up, they have to look at themselves because it's still an art form.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  By the way, talk about censorship. We just put up something on your website and it's been taken down off YouTube.
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  I mean, it's like whack-a-mole. And now they're saying, if you say the word mother or father, they might take you down.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  I mean, it's just there's no end to this cult.
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:55.000]  That's amazing. I wonder if it just happened now because I'm on your show and that'd be great.
[2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:59.000]  Where do you think the woke cult is going? Because now they're eating their own.
[2:19:59.000 --> 2:20:03.000]  Yeah, they're eating their own, which is great. We had a guy that came after us.
[2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  We started doing illegal shows during the pandemic because we're like, no, we're going to do stand-up.
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:10.000]  Oh, you're thought criminals. You were...
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:15.000]  Yeah, that's what I've been termed. We started doing illegal shows and then they started to move inside.
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  First, we're doing them on the back of trucks in like Queens and then we're doing them in parks.
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  And then we're like, let's find indoor places. And someone's like, anyone that does indoor shows, you're killing people.
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  And then all of a sudden you're like, okay, this guy's super woke and then this week he just lost his job for being a misogynist,
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  for calling a woman a four letter C word on like a live stream.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  So it does all come back around. It's amazing to watch.
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  It's, you know, I should have brought that up because I knew you did that. You guys do, I love illegal gatherings.
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  You know, in Canada, the UK, they're still banning church services.
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  They're arresting preachers calling them illegal church services.
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  They took a pastor down on the highway, made him kneel down and then picked him up and carried him off.
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  And he's calling them Nazis when they come to arrest them, by the way.
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  What's going to happen to New York and all these places that are staying closed? I mean, everybody I know is leaving those places.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  I'm going to say this. New York is open a little bit. I moved. I lived in Queens. I now live in Jersey, which was the best thing.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  I got a wife. I got a daughter. We want like a house. And I'm sure you have a lovely property where you sleep out back here.
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  I don't know how it's actually arranged. You could go either way. You look like you have like a beautiful ranch style home.
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  Or sometimes you're like, I'm just going to sleep at the office with this bottle of bourbon and weep myself to sleep.
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  I don't know where you go. I have slept at the office with a bottle of bourbon. I nailed it.
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  New York is going to come back, but it's, there's no way I can describe it on your show without cursing, but it's a hole.
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  It's a dump. There's heroin. We can delay that. Thank you. Hey, that was great that you can say all the stuff that I'm not allowed to say.
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  Thank you. When you come on my show, you can do the same thing with. No, no, here's the deal.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  They can delay it out a little, but then the delay runs out. So the smart people that want to get their cuss words out, they know what they do.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  They call me right away. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, I think it's dumb.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  I can say that I think Bill Gates was involved in child molestation with Jeffrey Epstein. I can say that all radio stations are fine.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  There's a lot of that was pointed out, but I can't say F or C or as it's stupid.
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:18.000]  Yeah, but I don't even know if you can say, first of all, there was a huge jump from New York, but I don't even know if you could say that.
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  Or if you're one of those guys that they go after so hard in every way, shape, or form that it's even me being here is a thing now where they're like, oh, he's on Alice's show.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  But to me, that's a, oh boy, you know, he looks like a boy.
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  That's like Kermit the Frog. I kind of get like they're both really ugly guys and I get that they would have to pay for sex.
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  Do you understand what I'm saying? Exactly. Whereas I gotta beat them off of the stick.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  Hey, we'll be right back. Stay with us. You got a buddy coming in here.
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full versus that.
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  If you're paying attention, you know, we've done together. But I'll tell you this.
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance. So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  So it's now that your credibility is way up. The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us. We have the power.
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  So be the polar bears you are.
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  When listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say thank you for what you've done.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air. Thank you for praying for us and thank you for spreading the word.
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  If all of you will simply go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or a Droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalist are predatory and are evil.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  And in the surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings. They're available at InfoWarsStore.com in four different colors, and they are only $19.95.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere. They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the InfoWars.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  Please take action today. Protect your privacy and fund the InfoWars.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  It's Thursday morning, May 13th. I'm sitting in my studio getting ready to go live, and I am just cutting this bulletin to all the listeners and all the viewers to understand how serious the situation is.
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  Just two weeks ago, I predicted you'd see massive inflation explode and they would cut off more pipelines. I said it on air more than 50 times, because America is under strategic globalist attack in an economic trade war to make sure China wins.
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  This is World War III, and I told listeners, you need to get storeable food. You need to get water filtration. Those are some of the basics you need, and we have the best storeable food at the lowest prices you're going to find anywhere.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  Now, the sale was supposed to end yesterday, but I'm running it through the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th, because so many people have requested that I extend it so people have a chance to get this great deal, 20-20 prices in the year 2021.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  And then my patrons can have to go up on prices because everybody else is already and the raw materials are skyrocketing. They have the food ready to ship right now at preparewithalvage.com, 10% off.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  The BioProse are the new non-GMO pollution solution using eco-friendly products to treat everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  For the first time, the BioProse are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSepticPro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  BioSepticPro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  This stuff lives in your septic system. It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  Say goodbye to septic problems, gas buildup, and odor guaranteed.
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  BioSepticPro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to treat the problem at its core, making their products up 100 times more effective than its competitors.
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  BioSepticPro is safer plumbing, human, animal, and aquatic life.

[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  The Alex Jones Show
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  The Alex Jones Show
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  He had his way. He would live on a plantation. He said it would be a simpler time.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  But if I may rebut that New York is dead, New York is fine, but the entire country, and we say this is comedians, Alex, this is the problem I've had.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  I think you're talking about the secret shows we did, and this is the conspiracy theory that we talk about on our show in Hot Water a lot,
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  because we have to do secret shows. Because if you want to control someone, you can't have them laughing. You need to have them afraid.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  So we thought it was no coincidence that some of the last places that they would prioritize in New York opening up were what, Aaron?
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  Comedy clubs, yeah.
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  Because COVID's no laughing matter while the big banks last all the way to the bank, doubling and tripling their profits during the lockdown.
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  And Alex, wouldn't you say it's a fact? It's not just a cute phrase anymore that laughter does physically heal you. It hears you from the inside.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  All the research shows it. It's as good as sunshine.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  Oh, it's sunshine. No, no, no, you don't want sunshine. You want the vaccine. You don't want preventative medicine with COVID.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  You want to focus on the vaccine rather than all the palliative care, the preventative care that the government has given us, which is effing none.
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  And that's why we just try and get people to go out and laugh at our silly little show.
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  It's not a little show. Can I even get into your Vulcan show here in Austin, or is it going to be sold out?
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  I will put one ticket aside, but it's general admission. It's not a VIP table, but I can arrange it.
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  And I also have karaoke. You do karaoke. You got to see Kumi as a thing. He's got a crooner's voice on him.
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  I heard he sings like Chinese, too.
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  He just pulls his AR-15 and does like a webcam thing where he just sings all privately.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  He has his own little slant on karaoke. But yeah, he's a big fan of that, but it's going to be a good time tonight. You should come out.
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  There's no show tonight. It's tomorrow night. If he comes tonight, he's just going to be...
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  You should come out to karaoke tonight.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  Karaoke's tomorrow night.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  I'm a good boy. I've completely stopped drinking, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  Totally.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  100%. I think if I go to a comedy club, I might...
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:58.000]  Well, I was saying this to our fans. I quit drinking during the lockdown, not because I'm like, let me get healthy,
[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:04.000]  but that's another thing they did. They took away the social aspect of life. It's like, it was no fun.
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:08.000]  Because I used to say we have the best fans in the world in hot water.
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:11.000]  And I would say, I don't know what time, Alex. We used to do it in the mornings.
[2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:12.000]  9 a.m.
[2:30:12.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  9 a.m.
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:15.000]  I said, I don't know what time you would have to get to me.
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:20.000]  And he's a bomb, Alex. This guy's a drunken bomb, slept in his car for like a year,
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:22.000]  wouldn't even get out of the car to go to the bathroom.
[2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:24.000]  Like, would go to the bathroom in the car through it.
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  Comes to my house. I see him at my brand new house, Alex.
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:30.000]  And I see him dumping something out of a coffee thing.
[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:32.000]  And I go, what are you doing? He goes, it's coffee.
[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  Like, I caught him.
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  And then two days later, he goes, it's piss.
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:38.000]  I pee in the jar in my car when I'm traveling.
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  You never save time, Alex, driving to a gig and you got the VA.
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:43.000]  I have pee in a water bottle many times.
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:45.000]  You're rubbing dumb.
[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:48.000]  Better when you've got like a big jacked up Ford F-150.
[2:30:48.000 --> 2:30:49.000]  Yeah.
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:52.000]  But the problem is back, but I'm driving my Hellcat, which I gave to my dad.
[2:30:52.000 --> 2:30:56.000]  The problem is you're in a red light, or all of a sudden you stop in the red light.
[2:30:56.000 --> 2:30:59.000]  Like, whoever you are out in the country, as soon as you start peeing in the cup,
[2:30:59.000 --> 2:31:01.000]  there's a four-way stop and they're like a family looking.
[2:31:01.000 --> 2:31:04.000]  He got flint real quick.
[2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:06.000]  He's in a little Chevy Sonic.
[2:31:06.000 --> 2:31:08.000]  You've never peed in the bottle in the car.
[2:31:08.000 --> 2:31:10.000]  I've never peed in the bottle in the car.
[2:31:10.000 --> 2:31:12.000]  I was raised properly. What are you doing?
[2:31:12.000 --> 2:31:14.000]  Well, here's the thing, in a lot of places, if you pull off a fist behind a bush,
[2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:15.000]  they arrest you.
[2:31:15.000 --> 2:31:16.000]  Yeah.
[2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:17.000]  Yeah.
[2:31:17.000 --> 2:31:19.000]  Well, and then usually three other men come out and go, that was great.
[2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  Have you ever dumped in a paper cup while you're driving?
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:22.000]  No.
[2:31:22.000 --> 2:31:25.000]  He dumped in a bag and then threw it out of the George Washington Bridge.
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:26.000]  And I drive it.
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  That's thick.
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:29.000]  Listen, I've never done that officially.
[2:31:29.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  I think this is what we came on to play about, though.
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:36.000]  But you can be arrested in Texas for throwing cigarette out the side of your car.
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:37.000]  Is that true?
[2:31:37.000 --> 2:31:38.000]  Yeah.
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  Well, if it's all dried, burn everything down that way.
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:42.000]  Yeah.
[2:31:42.000 --> 2:31:44.000]  Well, I mean, that's what they should do in New York.
[2:31:44.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  I'm hoping that there's a third wave and that there's a variant on COVID
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:50.000]  that just eliminates drivers in Manhattan.
[2:31:50.000 --> 2:31:51.000]  That'd be fantastic.
[2:31:51.000 --> 2:31:53.000]  Well, that sounds like Bill Marjok recently said,
[2:31:53.000 --> 2:31:55.000]  hey, I'm just for more deaths, more suicides.
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:31:56.000]  Yeah.
[2:31:56.000 --> 2:31:57.000]  Get the highway moving.
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  Well, wouldn't you argue business?
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:00.000]  To quote a comic is a great friend of ours.
[2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:05.000]  You'll remember this phrase because this is what gets me about all the deaths.
[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  Kevin Brennan once said, no one puts Nana into a nursing home to rehab her for the
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  2020 season with Tom Brady.
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  Once you put them in the nursing home, you quit on them.
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:18.000]  And if you wanted to create the perfect pandemic, these are the three steps.
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:20.000]  And I'm sure you've touched upon this.
[2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:25.000]  One, make sure it kills the oldest and most infirmed useless members of society.
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:29.000]  Two, make sure the stupid people that we keep hearing are like, did you see all the dead
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  people and they're afraid to go out of the house?
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  And three, then you control them with fear.
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:34.000]  And this just came out.
[2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:37.000]  They did a study of people who got the vaccine.
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:41.000]  And between people who got the vaccine and people who didn't,
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  vaccinated people are still more afraid to do things than unvaccinated people.
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:49.000]  I may have seen it on Tucker last night.
[2:32:49.000 --> 2:32:50.000]  And now they love it.
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:52.000]  Now they say that they never want to take the mask off in studies.
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  No.
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:54.000]  No.
[2:32:54.000 --> 2:32:55.000]  I got the vaccine.
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:32:57.000]  I'm embarrassed about it.
[2:32:57.000 --> 2:32:58.000]  I got it.
[2:32:58.000 --> 2:33:00.000]  I was going to see my dad, my parents.
[2:33:00.000 --> 2:33:01.000]  Which one did you take?
[2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:02.000]  I took the...
[2:33:02.000 --> 2:33:03.000]  What?
[2:33:03.000 --> 2:33:04.000]  What?
[2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:05.000]  I took the...
[2:33:05.000 --> 2:33:07.000]  And then he blamed me for giving him a head cold for three weeks.
[2:33:07.000 --> 2:33:10.000]  I took the Johnson and Johnson because it's good.
[2:33:10.000 --> 2:33:12.000]  It's 11% effective.
[2:33:12.000 --> 2:33:14.000]  It's a virus vector.
[2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:15.000]  It's horrible.
[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:16.000]  And then right after I got...
[2:33:16.000 --> 2:33:17.000]  You know what's in that sucker?
[2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:18.000]  Yeah.
[2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:20.000]  I have blood clots in my leg and I'm growing a vagina on my lower back.
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:22.000]  I know exactly what you're saying.
[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:24.000]  I ain't complaining about that second one, Alex.
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:25.000]  I got sick for a night.
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  Oh, really?
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:27.000]  Be serious.
[2:33:27.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  I...
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  For 12 hours, chills, body aches, couldn't sleep.
[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:34.000]  And then since then, I've been sick three times.
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  The year prior to that, I was not sick at all.
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:38.000]  Oh, oh, listen.
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  They admit that it attacks proteins in your body that are similar to the virus.
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  And luckily, you're in good shape.
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  People that are overweight or whatever are having heart attacks.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:47.000]  Yeah.
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:50.000]  My mom's still waiting for a second one in Canada.
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  Which, by the way, if you think any city in America is a dump right now,
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:56.000]  Canada is a weird lockdown.
[2:33:56.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  It's under martial law.
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  That's exactly what it is.
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  Did you see Trudeau say that I admire China's dictatorship?
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  Did he have blackface on for that one?
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  No, he did.
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  But he actually said, they go, what do you admire?
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:06.000]  What system?
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  He wasn't like, well, I admire Switzerland or I love the American system.
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  No, I like China's basic dictatorship of GDP.
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  Yeah.
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  And Trudeau would be a horrible dictator, I think.
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  I just don't...
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  I don't see it working out well for him.
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  But if I ever said I want a dictatorship, I would be...
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  I mean, I don't want a dictatorship, but I'd be out of a job.
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  Well, how the...
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  If it's a room full of women, they look like they have orgasms when he says it.
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  Yeah, there he is.
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  They get very excited.
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:32.000]  They're wiggling around.
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  He used to be an attractive guy.
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  I always picture him showing up in the blackface like doing a moonlight thing,
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  going, Bonjour in French.
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  And you can't lose any more jobs.
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  You know, Mark Zuckerberg begged Gigi Ping to name his first child Gigi,
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  and he said no.
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  That's how they groveled with the dictator.
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:50.000]  Yeah.
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  Wow.
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  Why did they...
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  I mean, even Trump...
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  Was it Winnie the Pooh?
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  You could be sent to a death camp in China for calling Gigi Ping Winnie the Pooh.
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  Come on.
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  You could be sent to a death camp in China for anything, am I right?
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  Put him on screen, and I'm going to say it.
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  Burn in hell, Winnie the Pooh.
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  Burn in hell.
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  All of a sudden, you just...
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  Exactly.
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  We splotted him.
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  This goes right down, yeah.
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  Guys, put Winnie the Pooh on screen, please.
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  They're not doing it.
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  They're going to probably put the real Winnie the Pooh up.
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  I'll have noticed, and your staff seemed lovely before I got here,
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  is they have a real aversion of listening to what you say.
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  Oh, they're in there injecting heroin.
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  No, no, seriously.
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  They just put Gigi Ping on screen.
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  Just give it back to me.
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  That's all you got to do.
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  Fun.
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  Yeah.
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  There he is.
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  Oh.
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  See, they didn't want to just give me Gigi Ping.
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  They wanted to give me that.
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  He looks more of a businessman than a dictator.
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  He looks like a vampire bat.
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:42.000]  Yeah.
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:44.000]  That just drained three children.
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  Yeah.
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  Do you think that...
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  Okay.
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  Adrenochrome, real thing?
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  Adrenochrome is real.
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  It's the ingredient on EpiPens.
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  Okay.
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  And there's what's crazy.
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  Those only came out like 20 years ago.
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  He wrote about that as fear and loathing in Las Vegas.
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  Hunter S. Thompson did.
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  And turned out that lawyer was real and said that really happened.
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  And so, yes, Satanists are in all sorts of weird stuff.
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  They do torture children and then drink the blood itself.
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  It's full of a bunch of adrenaline and other stuff.
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  And they have to scare the kids so that the adrenochrome gets to the highest level.
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  The adrenal gland.
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  Yeah, it goes bananas.
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  Okay.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  So, does Tom Hanks really have an ankle bracelet?
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  No.
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  None of that's real.
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  See what happened is the Q movement was run by the globalist, the CIA,
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  And then they would take real stuff going on that would add crazy stuff on the end
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  to make it totally ridiculous to the discredit all the real stuff about Jeffrey Epstein.
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  Okay.
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  The globalist.
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:42.000]  How many people could be included in that group of globalists that are at the top tier
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  of globalists?
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  I'd say maybe a hundred.
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  It's a family show.
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  We're behaving ourselves very, very nicely.
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  I'm not wearing pants.
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  What?
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April, 2021.
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  And I just want to say something.
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  the years and has truly been answered a prayer.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:06.000]  And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  You've got red blood.
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  and sisters together.
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  done.
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for us.
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  God bless.
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  We've got the best out there.
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available.
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does.
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  And it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:16.000]  in it.
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  So this is also clean to fish oil.
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  Grill oil is sent to sell out.
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  It's amazing as well.
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  It's at 25% off.
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  But when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  Ultimate fish oil down back in stock at infomerstore.com.
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  And when I forget to take it, I really feel it.
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  When I take a couple of them before I go to sleep at night, it makes my dreams even more amazing.
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  Blizzard thought I was joking.
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  You've tried it out and most of you have been blown away.
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  Get your fish oil today at infomerstore.com.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  Ultimate fish oil.
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  Infomerstore.com.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:48.000]  Ultimate fish oil.
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  Infomerstore.com.
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  Infomerstore.com.
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  Infomerstore.com.
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  That's why Info Wars is in financial trouble, is because if we had the product, you would
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  be buying it, we'd have the money.
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:18.000]  But so many of them have been sold out, just like you noticed, a lot of other items at
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  But finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen, Deep Earth Crystal iodide, so essential
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  in your body.
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  It's really the missing link.
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  It's 50% off.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  We've got a big shipment of it at infomerstore.com.
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  Now, when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price.
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  Take advantage of this now and stock up.
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  And don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to forget how great it is
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  and not take it myself.
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  It's essential.
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  It's X2 at infomerstore.com.
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  patients.
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women and children with uranium
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many of
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  the test subjects.
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:20.000]  Fourteen years ago, we tracked and documented the Boulder-Burke group's activities, and
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  they're planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  The film now is more important than ever.
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  When it's shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  We have it back in print available now at infomerstore.com.
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  Selling them as low as $3.95 a piece of the environment bulk.
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  And there's a zero country code, so anywhere on the planet, you can make copies.
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  In fact, I want you to make copies.
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  You are the Paul Revere's, 1776 worldwide, 1776 worldwide.
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement available now at infomerstore.com.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  You know, this Conte is our guest home of Aaron Berg.
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  They have a very popular program, AaronBerg.com, in HotwaterStore.com, and they're on with,
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  of course, Anthony Cooney, our good friend on CombiMedia.com, who's going to be on with
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  Joe Rogan, I guess, taping the day.
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  I guess we'll air tomorrow.
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  So here we are, gentlemen.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  Hanging out.
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  We're hanging out, Alan.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  This is great.
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  Austin, we've seen so much.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  Do you remember we got out of the airport?
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  We got in a car, and then we got here.
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  It's amazing.
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  You probably got to see some homeless camps.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  None yet.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  I heard it's amazing.
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  Downtown, so many of them.
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  You could just walk up.
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  We're becoming more like LA every day.
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  Because there was a huge influx of people coming.
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  The mayor said come here two years ago, and so we went from having an infestation of
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  homeless to literally having them in any direction in 10 miles everywhere.
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  But they passed a law saying, no, now you can't camp in people's yards.
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  They passed a law saying you could.
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  They moved into people's yards, and now the homeless are attacking people if they
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  try to kick them out of their yards.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  How can somebody go on your own private property in the state of Texas and camp out and leave
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  a lie?
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  Well, what they do is they call it the sidewalk, but they go into the neighborhoods.
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  They get in your backyard, and they're in your yard.
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  It's bad.
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  It's horrible.
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  Outdoor camping.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  And again, most of them are on fentanyl.
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  A lot of them will bite you.
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  Great drug.
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  Yeah.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  My cousin worked for Microsoft, and he was a good friend of mine.
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:40.000]  He was trying to give a homeless person like five years ago a 20.
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  And the other homeless man bit him, and he got an infection to die.
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  So they're like literal zombies, but I'm supposed to love them and praise them.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  Whereas you're respectful, you just live in your car.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  Well, let me tell you, I've said this before.
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  I lived out of my car for a year.
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  Best thing in the world, better than winning the lottery.
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:01.000]  Once you realize you don't need anything, you have gratitude for everything.
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:04.000]  And this, I've said, is the problem with what's going on in the country now.
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  People are dumb.
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  If you wake up in this country, and I know you never said, the greatest country in the
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:13.000]  world, Alex, when you have to realize everybody that wakes up, there's an 80 percent chance
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  you're going to wake up living in India or China.
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  Okay.
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  India where if you Google crap on the beach, comma, trip advisor, you get four star hotels
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  there.
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  You understand?
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:24.000]  That place is a mess.
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  Four star hotels, they poop on the side of the sidewalk.
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  Yeah, on the sidewalk.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  Regular ones, it's the entire sidewalk is crap.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  It's disgusting.
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  So if you wake up in this country and don't realize how lucky you are, look for these
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  problems, you deserve to live in that hell.
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:41.000]  You wake up every day saying, oh my God, I hope I don't die of COVID, but you deserve
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  it.
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  You deserve to live in that here.
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  In fact, there's a cartoon at the bottom of info wars.
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  It may have already scrolled off, but it's the wall and it's a bunch of illegals saying,
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:48.000]  let us in.
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:49.800]  We want to be oppressed right now.
[2:43:49.800 --> 2:43:56.000]  I saw that Biden's making an order so that it's for transgender people to get it.
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:43:57.500]  So you can give them the covering up.
[2:43:57.500 --> 2:43:59.000]  What you're saying, I'm transgender.
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:00.000]  Wait a minute.
[2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  How did he know?
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  You're a woman to a man.
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  Wait, are the frogs turning?
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:14.000]  I have a good ground game, but I saw those breasts when I came in.
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  I think it's a weird thing.
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  I have a daughter.
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  She's a girl, by the way.
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:20.000]  And I know you're not supposed to say that.
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  She's a girl.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:22.000]  She wears dresses.
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  She has a slit.
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:24.000]  She can be out of.
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  She's a girl, Alex.
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  Okay.
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  But I get it's 2022.
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  So she sits down with you.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  Yeah, she sits down with you.
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:32.000]  You know, they have a movie theater in Austin that they opened where the women stand up
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  to piss and like these funnels, but they didn't want women didn't like it.
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  So they took them out.
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  Wow.
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  The women didn't want to piss in funnels.
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  Yeah.
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  The Alamo Draft House.
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  Most of it turns around pretty quickly when people like this is the equal rights we want.
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  And then we're like, no, we don't really want that.
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  What's this?
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  I'm going to be a transgender person getting into the border.
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  You be the border patrol and go.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  Okay.
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:54.000]  Sir, you can't come in here.
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:56.000]  Hola, yo soy una woman.
[2:44:56.000 --> 2:44:57.000]  Yo, vagina.
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:44:58.000]  Oh, right.
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  A vagina.
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:00.000]  Right this way to that room.
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  Grande esta go y no don't they?
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:04.000]  Right.
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:05.000]  Me milky cream pop.
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  Me tres leches.
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:07.000]  Me milky milky.
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:08.000]  I guess it.
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  Una pagina por favor.
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  It's going to be exciting to watch.
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:16.000]  I don't know how bad the border problem is.
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:19.000]  We should have me go down the border, get on the Mexican side and wear a dress.
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  Oh, come on.
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  You it.
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:22.000]  You powerful man.
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  We'll go with you.
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  I am woman.
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  You misgender me.
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:26.000]  You hear me?
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  Roar.
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:28.000]  Ah, hear woman roar.
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  They're playing La Bamba on a blue.
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  Strong woman.
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  Strong woman.
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  Ba-da-la-la-la-ba-ba.
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  Please let me in.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  I need $15,000 COVID relief.
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  Oh, New York.
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  Oh, let me have access to your children.
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  It's insane.
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  Oh, I'm not woman, though.
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  I have pee-pee set on my lap.
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  Oh, you like these?
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  You little four year old.
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  What's the difference between Epstein and these sickos?
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:55.000]  He's got billions of dollars or dead.
[2:45:55.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  Yeah.
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  And it's next broken.
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  So these are just poor people.
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:45:59.000]  But he killed himself.
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  Yeah.
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:02.000]  He slipped and fell on the news.
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  And broke three verse.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  What was that joke that I used to do?
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  He killed himself.
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  I go, Jeffrey Epstein, you remember him?
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  He committed suicide at the hands of two people?
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  At the hands of two people.
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  Yeah.
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  At the hands of two people.
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  And then I go, Jeffrey Epstein, not to be confused with Albert Einstein.
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  And then like the guy that saw them break his neck, he died too.
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:19.000]  Yeah.
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  Everybody's dying.
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  Yeah.
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  And I go, Einstein, you remember him, Alex.
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  E equals MC squared.
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  Yeah.
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  Energy equals mass times speed of light squared.
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  And Epstein was E equals MC squared.
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  Epstein murdered by Clintons, two of them.
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:31.000]  Exactly.
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  See this?
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:33.000]  I'm digging this guy.
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  He got it.
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:35.000]  Let me ask you this.
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  This is my demographic now.
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:37.000]  He's the best.
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  Let me ask you this.
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  Austin, Texas, TV.
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  And I'm laughing inside.
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  Yeah.
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:43.000]  When you argue that all you can trust now is like when you, you talked about it earlier,
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  what did they call the experiments that they're calling out Fauci for doing the, that
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  they did?
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:49.000]  Gain a function.
[2:46:49.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  Thank you.
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  Gain a function.
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  Your boy Rand Paul literally looks at him in Senate, says it and he's like, by the way,
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:59.000]  I have all the documents that Fauci signed for millions of dollars running the damn program.
[2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:00.000]  Yeah.
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:01.000]  Anyone arrest him?
[2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:05.000]  Like, I mean, I know that's dumb, but you look at this and say, this can't be.
[2:47:05.000 --> 2:47:07.000]  How do they just say, no, I didn't do it.
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:09.000]  The Eddie Murphy, it wasn't me, baby.
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:10.000]  And they get, how did they get away with this?
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:15.000]  Well, that's why I said, I want him charged with, with too many crimes against humanity.
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  Nuremberg too, baby.
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  Do people listen when you say this, when you're like, I want him charged?
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:21.000]  Does anyone look into it?
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:23.000]  Or do they just dismiss you even though you think that?
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  These megalomaniacs always think you're invincible.
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  That's why they did.
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  This is a power grab.
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  I have all the lockstep documents, all the great leap forward crap.
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  They, I've got a bunch of these documents where they said we're going to use.
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  I saw you have every document known to man.
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  Just today's doctors.
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  They said to get control.
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  Yeah.
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  They said to get control.
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  We need a virus.
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:45.000]  It'll bring in a world ID, a global social credit score.
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  It's claustrophobic.
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  I wrote a book about it called COVID-19.
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  The Great Recent.
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  It's very viable.
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  And then I watched Plandemic and that was taken down almost immediately.
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  So whenever I bring up questions like that, everybody goes, no, you're a conspiracy guy.
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  This is crazy.
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  Well, they also censor thousands of doctors and scientists that have come out and said,
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  this is bull.
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  Including prestigious ones.
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  So you're supposed to be able to question science, right?
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  So the science all says, this is natural.
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:11.000]  The science all says it's the most deadly plague.
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  You know, since the bubonic plague, then we should be able to question it, right?
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  Oh, no.
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  You're supposed to question science.
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  And I'm sorry I saw this because I do.
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  This is just trigger common sense.
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  If they tell you that you have to do what they say without proof, it's a cult.
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  It's a belief system.
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  Wait, wait, wait.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  You're saying we shouldn't give pap smears to genetic biological men?
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  Then why did the guy give me one in the green room?
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  Because you said you were transvestite to get across the border.
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  I said transgender.
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  No, I can't remember.
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  I can't remember.
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  Transvestite's different.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  They perform on stage.
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  That's true.
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  I think it's a different thing.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  It's really weird what happens now.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  Ardu more, Gino, and tell them about what Fauci did.
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  Remember, you told me Fauci...
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  And we got pipeline workers we're going to briefly talk to in the next segment.
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  Oh, wow.
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  Dallas and John have been holding patiently.
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:48:58.000]  We're going to go to them in just a minute.
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  I promised Dallas.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  This is a segue into comedy, which I'm sure we all need a little bit of.
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  We can talk to one now.
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  We're not offended.
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  All right.
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  Dallas in Texas.
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:07.000]  Which Dallas is in Texas.
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  Wow.
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  Dallas, welcome, sir.
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  You're on the air.
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  Tell us about your view of the pipeline, very suspicious shutdown.
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  So I've been an oil and gas for over a decade now.
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  And actually, if you go to the Colonial Pipeline website and you look at the ownership, you're
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  going to find five different people.
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  The bottom three, Colberg, Kraus, Roberts, Casey, DeBoite, and Royal Dutch Shell.
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  All three of those own 50% of Colonial Pipeline.
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  If you go to the World Economic Forum to the 2021 and 2030 agenda and you look at this
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  and you look at their partners, you're going to find is these three people on the World
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  Economic Forum for the Green New Deal.
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  So I don't believe this pipeline was hacked.
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  I believe it was shut down for the Green New Deal.
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  Well, I mean, Whitmer just tried to set out a giant pipeline out of Canada.
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  Yeah.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  And they've shut down a bunch of pipelines, not just Keystone.
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  So if it's the same group doing that, and then it doesn't make sense with the hack and
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  they could have manually turned it back on, by the way.
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  We've had engineers calling about that.
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  Then it is a little suspicious to me.
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  Couldn't you say this is a false flag?
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  It's like, it checked so many boxes because you're like, oh, my God, look, gas is terrible.
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  We've got to switch to natural energy.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  And oh, my God, gas is a shortage.
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  You know, let's trigger.
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  Exactly.
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  Imagine Biden as a fox who's already eaten about 10 chickens.
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  And then we catch him with a chicken in his hand and he goes, oh, no, I didn't do this.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  Hackers did.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  Yeah.
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  He's a prime suspect.
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  It just seems to, it's too coincidental.
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  Is that fair to say?
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  Absolutely.
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  Dallas, you just laid some heavy research on it.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  We'll look into it.
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  What else do you think, my friend?
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  Absolutely.
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  Well, I'm down here in Houston.
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  And as we all know, this is where all the windmills are coming from.
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  I-45 going northbound is always full of 18-wheelers with windmill parts.
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  But, you know, we're all supposed to be, you know, all those oil-filled workers that are out of jobs.
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  We're supposed to go, you know, back in the day, we're supposed to learn the code.
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:17.000]  Now we got to go learn how to install solar panels and build windmills.
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  Even though there's no way to store the solar panel, energy in the winter or at night, it doesn't work.
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  Absolutely.
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  Absolutely.
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  Not only that, but Bill Gates has invested $2 billion to block out the sun.
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  So what's the point of having solar panels that Bill Gates is just going to block out the sun?
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  What are we doing here?
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:34.000]  And again, see how insane that sounds?
[2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  But it's true.
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  We'll be right back in the fourth hour.
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  You know, I can block it.
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  That's the facts.
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  That's the information.
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:38.000]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say.
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:09.000]  It's a incredible call just now from Dallas in Texas, you know, unattended.
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  Just laying out the facts and looking at all the Davos group.
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  I'm telling you, everything leads back to these guys because they're the public version of the Bilderberg group.
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  How has it changed in the past 10 years, the transition of power from people that run stuff?
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:26.000]  How has it changed or has it always been the same people?
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:30.000]  That is a hugely important question and we've got one call we've got to go to in the short segment.
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  I will answer that after Norm Patis leaves this next segment because that's a two-minute answer.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  Okay.
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  And that's really, really big.
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  But the big answer is they're out in the open now.
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  So you're saying I have the best question on this show.
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:40.000]  You have the best question.
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  Boo!
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:42.000]  But it's not a contest there.
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  But if it were.
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:44.000]  It's kind of a contest.
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  It's not.
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  It's not.
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  It's clearly me at this point.
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:48.000]  It would be a contest if I'd asked him that.
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  He also told me that.
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  You have fellow podcaster Norm Patis popping in for one segment here next segment.
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:54.000]  Can I have the Media Matters article, guys?
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  Pretty please.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  Thank you.
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  Because I want to get him on yesterday and he was busy in that position.
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  But the left's all saying a recipe for what I said, I want to ask a famous criminal lawyer,
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:08.000]  who represents some of the most vicious criminals in America, not whoever it is that's me, if I committed a crime.
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  Let's go ahead and go to John in Pennsylvania.
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  John, you're on the air.
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  Alex?
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  Yeah, hi.
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  My name is John.
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  I'm in Erie, Pennsylvania.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  I had a good-paying job on the pipeline.
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  I also did fracking as well.
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  You know, it's all done by design to take people's money.
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  So when OCY comes and takes their kids, they can't defend themselves.
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  What?
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  He's a pipeline worker.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  He's giving us the take about how they're trying to break the society down and break down the culture.
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  Give me a second.
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  We're also going to try to break down the family, too.
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  Oh, they're doing that, brother.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  It's cash for kids.
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  It's cash for kids in the state of Ohio.
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  It's big in Erie, Pennsylvania.
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  It's bad.
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  The judge is in on it.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  The CPS is in on it.
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  And the employee, the one's the show.
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  And the one employee, the one's the CPS in town, Tina Cherofsky.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  I mean, the judges are going to let this lady do what she wants.
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  It's cash for kids.
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  It's all about killing the family.
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  They're normalizing pedophilia.
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  John, I hear you.
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  We're going to hell in a handbasket, and that's why we need to expose it.
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  And let me ask you, gentlemen, thanks for the call, John.
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  What do we do to counter this crazy leftist takeover?
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  Because I don't see you guys as right-wingers.
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  I don't see you guys as right-wingers.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  I just don't want to destroy the family and things that work well
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  and be conquered by a bunch of weird, neurotic leftists.
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  That is a family, man.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  I tell you, focus on your own family, and you try and lead by example.
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  And that's what you do.
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  And you let the rest of the stuff fall by the wayside as it should.
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  And if you have to pivot, you pivot.
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  You figure out ways to do it.
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  I can't work for a major network now that I've done this today.
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  So what I do is I just make my own content.
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:44.000]  I like your T-shirt.
[2:56:44.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  Thank you.
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  That is...
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  Wuhan La Crosse.
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  Wuhan La Crosse.
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  The La Crosse teams, however, they were all wiped out in a wet market.
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  Yeah.
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:53.000]  In a downtown Wuhan.
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  Yeah, there was an incident.
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  It was like what happened with Duke, but these people ate bats and died.
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  Only that really happened.
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  But you've got an answer.
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  Why is Hillary Clinton on there?
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  No, that's not...
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  If you had to, her Chloris Leachman, if you were not married, pick one.
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  I did.
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  What?
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  You know what I mean.
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  Massager feet?
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  Yeah.
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  Who's Chloris Leachman?
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  You don't remember Chloris Leachman?
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:19.000]  Chloris Leachman from... Jesus, from Maude, from Young Frankenstein.
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  She was hot in her earlier days.
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  In her earlier days.
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:24.000]  Yeah, but Hillary Clinton was never hot.
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  I'm sorry.
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:26.000]  She was never Google.
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  Oh, Chloris Leachman is in, like, Young Frankenstein.
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  Yeah.
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  Yeah.
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  Straubluka.
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  Yeah.
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  Yeah, her.
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:34.000]  Oh, she's...
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  You find an old picture of her.
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:36.000]  She's a piece of B-U-T-T-S.
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  She's a beautiful...
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  Butts.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  Piece of Butts.
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  But I agree with what you're saying.
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  Like, I say this all the time.
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:44.500]  Like, we are the greatest country in the world, but we might have what is turned into
[2:57:44.500 --> 2:57:46.000]  the worst parents in the world.
[2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  Like, people don't raise their kids anymore.
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:51.600]  And I grew up in a Norman Rockwell painting, so I've always been grounded in, like, my
[2:57:51.600 --> 2:57:54.000]  friends and my family, and that's what gets you through it.
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:58.000]  Well, yeah, because they always demonize America, but we had half the wealth, 4% of the population.
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  We were empowering everybody, and now the globalists are taking over demonizing that,
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:03.500]  and it's all going to hell in a handbasket.
[2:58:03.500 --> 2:58:04.500]  Yeah.
[2:58:04.500 --> 2:58:06.500]  I think what we do is what?
[2:58:06.500 --> 2:58:07.500]  Allow more trans immigrants.
[2:58:07.500 --> 2:58:09.500]  You said put on a wig and get over the border.
[2:58:09.500 --> 2:58:10.500]  That was my idea.
[2:58:10.500 --> 2:58:11.500]  That was your idea.
[2:58:11.500 --> 2:58:13.500]  I didn't see how that has anything to do with family.
[2:58:13.500 --> 2:58:19.500]  But the people that attack what we do, they're hiding horrible things on their end.
[2:58:19.500 --> 2:58:21.000]  And it always ends up coming out.
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:24.500]  There was one cancel guy that canceled someone from Saturday Night Live.
[2:58:24.500 --> 2:58:27.000]  Turns out he was molesting women all the time.
[2:58:27.000 --> 2:58:28.000]  There was another guy.
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:32.200]  Turns out he was doing his own bondage porn, where he would eat his own liquids and stuff
[2:58:32.200 --> 2:58:33.200]  like that.
[2:58:33.200 --> 2:58:34.200]  They're sick people.
[2:58:34.200 --> 2:58:38.000]  And by the way, very clever of me to keep both those things clean, because I couldn't
[2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:39.000]  film.
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:40.000]  We got to go to Brightford 60 Seconds.
[2:58:40.000 --> 2:58:42.000]  Do we have more baddest on the line?
[2:58:42.000 --> 2:58:44.000]  I saw him on there and now he's not there.
[2:58:44.000 --> 2:58:45.000]  We didn't say anything.
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:46.000]  No, no, no.
[2:58:46.000 --> 2:58:47.000]  We didn't.
[2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:48.000]  It wasn't.
[2:58:48.000 --> 2:58:49.000]  It's not that.
[2:58:49.000 --> 2:58:50.000]  It's not that.
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:51.000]  It feels like he's going to.
[2:58:51.000 --> 2:58:54.000]  The globalists comprise the oldest and richest families on earth.
[2:58:54.000 --> 2:58:58.000]  And they have brought down hundreds and hundreds of nations over the last thousand years.
[2:58:58.000 --> 2:59:03.000]  They have bankrupted once successful countries all across the world.
[2:59:03.000 --> 2:59:08.000]  And they've used the same formulas of civil unrest and civil war.
[2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:13.000]  And they're doing it again to the United States of America and Europe right now, bringing
[2:59:13.000 --> 2:59:18.000]  in giant third world populations and then brainwashing them and turning them against the country
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:22.000]  that they wanted to emigrate to because they knew it was better and had more freedom and
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:23.000]  more opportunity.
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, America is under scientific attack.
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:30.000]  And it's time now more than ever to raise the alarm and warn everyone you know that was
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:34.000]  really happening and at the same time get prepared in case things continue to go south
[2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:35.000]  like they are.
[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:39.000]  One of the smartest moves out there is to get high quality, swarble food so that as inflation
[2:59:39.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  goes up, it's a way to defeat the inflation and have insurance you can eat.
[2:59:43.000 --> 3:00:10.000]  So we've extended the sale through this Sunday at 10% off all swarble foods at preparewithalix.com.
[3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:14.000]  All right, Norm Pattis is going to pop on but he's in a deposition so he can't go on.
[3:00:14.000 --> 3:00:15.000]  That happened yesterday too.
[3:00:15.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  I think note to self, don't get Norm on when he's in the middle of deposition because he's
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:19.000]  like getting hauled back in.
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:24.000]  All right guys, we got one more segment and the great Matt Bracken is going to take over
[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:30.000]  ahead of Owen Schreuer in the war room today and just incredible times.
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  Guys, you're here.
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  We have Aaron Berg and Gino Biscante.
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:43.000]  They host In Hot Water, a program on the compound media transmission with the great folks over
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  there with Anticomium.
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:48.000]  But yes, the whole crew's here for comedy shows and he's doing Joe Rogan.
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  So that should be an interesting thing.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:50.000]  When's that coming out?
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  It's a whole big weekend.
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  It's Rogan, I guess it'll be tomorrow.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:54.000]  It is freezing in here.
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:57.000]  I don't understand why you guys are so warm.
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:00:58.000]  It's freezing in here.
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:00.000]  You need a couple more tea cells coursing through your body.
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:02.000]  The show's Alex, you've got to come.
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  They're amazing.
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  Is it cold in there?
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:06.000]  No, I'm going to tell them to turn the heat on.
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  I dropped the freeze.
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:08.000]  It's great.
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:10.000]  It's like one of those crying things.
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  Do you like it cold in there?
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  I love it cold in there.
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  Yeah, I'm freezing.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:14.000]  This is horrible.
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  This is actually a little hot in there.
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  Come on.
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  It's freezing in here.
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  You don't want to hang me.
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  All right.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  I like you to hang me.
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  My point is the shows are going to be bananas.
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  We've got Larry Biaz hosting.
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  We think he may have just gotten out of jail.
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  Larry Biaz after you said bananas.
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  Because he's a friend of ours from New York, but he's like, I've got to go away for a
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:32.000]  while.
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  He's going to jail later and hit.
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:36.000]  That was a month and a half, but he's also one of those guys were like, maybe he just
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  pretended he went to jail for street cred.
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  Him, me, Gino, Kumiya does stand up now, which is unheard of.
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  You know, he's always been funny, like since the ONA days, if I can interrupt to his credit,
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  he wouldn't tell you he's doing stand up.
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  He's not, but he's, he's hilarious.
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:53.000]  He's always been and he's on stage just being funny.
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  Like I don't, I'm not, I want to give him props, but I don't want people to think he's
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  like, I'm a comic now because he's not.
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.600]  He started doing this as a favor to us.
[3:02:01.600 --> 3:02:05.600]  Like we would start doing the comedians of the compound and he would come out to, because
[3:02:05.600 --> 3:02:06.600]  that's a big name draw.
[3:02:06.600 --> 3:02:09.600]  But now, like you would think, you know, if he's not, I'm funny.
[3:02:09.600 --> 3:02:10.600]  He's being heard.
[3:02:10.600 --> 3:02:11.600]  Well, by the way, where is he?
[3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:12.600]  He should be here right now.
[3:02:12.600 --> 3:02:13.600]  Yeah.
[3:02:13.600 --> 3:02:14.600]  I told him that too.
[3:02:14.600 --> 3:02:15.600]  And he's been here the whole day.
[3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:18.200]  I don't even want to tell you what he said about you, Alex Jones.
[3:02:18.200 --> 3:02:19.200]  I didn't want to tell you.
[3:02:19.200 --> 3:02:21.600]  You should come to New York and hash it out with him, but get to New York.
[3:02:21.600 --> 3:02:23.600]  He has no desire to go to New York.
[3:02:23.600 --> 3:02:25.600]  He doesn't like feces or heroin.
[3:02:25.600 --> 3:02:26.600]  Why would he go to New York?
[3:02:26.600 --> 3:02:28.600]  It's about our show.
[3:02:28.600 --> 3:02:30.600]  It makes you laugh whether you want to or not.
[3:02:30.600 --> 3:02:31.600]  You guys have a great show.
[3:02:31.600 --> 3:02:32.600]  But what's the world now?
[3:02:32.600 --> 3:02:34.600]  I want to get Anthony in studio.
[3:02:34.600 --> 3:02:38.600]  So if he's here for the weekend, he has to come on the show tomorrow.
[3:02:38.600 --> 3:02:39.600]  Yeah.
[3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:40.600]  All right.
[3:02:40.600 --> 3:02:41.600]  I'll tell him to do that.
[3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:42.600]  Is he doing Rogan today?
[3:02:42.600 --> 3:02:43.600]  Yeah.
[3:02:43.600 --> 3:02:44.600]  Okay.
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:45.600]  So he'll come here tomorrow.
[3:02:45.600 --> 3:02:46.600]  I'm jealous now.
[3:02:46.600 --> 3:02:47.600]  Oh, you guys, that he's doing Rogan or that's Rogan's show right now.
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:48.600]  Let's go.
[3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:49.600]  You know where he is.
[3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:50.600]  He's got all the Navy SEALs protecting him.
[3:02:50.600 --> 3:02:51.600]  Does he really?
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:52.600]  Yeah.
[3:02:52.600 --> 3:02:53.600]  They have like machine gun turrets.
[3:02:53.600 --> 3:02:54.600]  Yeah.
[3:02:54.600 --> 3:02:55.600]  But you got the one guy that can kind of speak English.
[3:02:55.600 --> 3:02:57.600]  And that guy knew the difference between a cop and a taser.
[3:02:57.600 --> 3:02:58.600]  And he should move.
[3:02:58.600 --> 3:03:00.600]  He also knew a good cigar.
[3:03:00.600 --> 3:03:01.600]  He goes, is that a Narturo Fuente?
[3:03:01.600 --> 3:03:03.600]  And I go, yeah, I brought it for Alex.
[3:03:03.600 --> 3:03:04.600]  I go to his Alex Smoke.
[3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:05.600]  He goes a little.
[3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:06.600]  I go, not as much as you.
[3:03:06.600 --> 3:03:07.600]  He goes, you won't know what a Fuente is.
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:09.600]  And then I gave him the Fuente.
[3:03:09.600 --> 3:03:10.600]  He was ecstatic.
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:13.600]  So we got security guys stealing my cigars.
[3:03:13.600 --> 3:03:14.600]  It's great.
[3:03:14.600 --> 3:03:19.600]  We'll go, we'll go drop by Rogan's and just bust in there.
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:21.600]  It'll be, it'll be a good time, I think.
[3:03:21.600 --> 3:03:22.600]  That's a joke, folks.
[3:03:22.600 --> 3:03:23.600]  We're not going to do that.
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:24.600]  Oh, probably.
[3:03:24.600 --> 3:03:26.600]  It is strange out of the whole universe that Joe got a studio right out of the street
[3:03:26.600 --> 3:03:27.600]  for me.
[3:03:27.600 --> 3:03:28.600]  Yeah.
[3:03:28.600 --> 3:03:29.600]  Now he's got another studio.
[3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:30.600]  Remember when Alex Jones was drinking?
[3:03:30.600 --> 3:03:31.600]  He deserves to.
[3:03:31.600 --> 3:03:32.600]  Remember when Alex was drinking?
[3:03:32.600 --> 3:03:34.600]  He'd go and he'd crash Joe Rogan with you.
[3:03:34.600 --> 3:03:36.600]  Remember a cool Alex Jones there?
[3:03:36.600 --> 3:03:40.600]  I say we get Alex hammered right now and then we go and do Rogan too.
[3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:41.600]  Right now.
[3:03:41.600 --> 3:03:42.600]  Any booze in here?
[3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:43.600]  No, there's no alcohol here.
[3:03:43.600 --> 3:03:47.600]  And hey, we have a serious program and I'm normally really serious.
[3:03:47.600 --> 3:03:50.600]  But what's going to happen to Joe Biden?
[3:03:50.600 --> 3:03:54.600]  The media just fawns after, I don't know if you saw that compilation of what he did
[3:03:54.600 --> 3:03:57.600]  at the State of the Union and they're like, it was like the voice.
[3:03:57.600 --> 3:03:58.600]  It's like an angel.
[3:03:58.600 --> 3:04:02.600]  It's totally the inflections, the way he controlled the modulation.
[3:04:02.600 --> 3:04:03.600]  Wow.
[3:04:03.600 --> 3:04:06.600]  No one's ever witnessed someone that it's just this orator skill.
[3:04:06.600 --> 3:04:09.600]  And he may not, he was a babbling idiot.
[3:04:09.600 --> 3:04:13.600]  I'm going to say it's good to finally have a president that can fall up the stairs.
[3:04:13.600 --> 3:04:14.600]  Exactly.
[3:04:14.600 --> 3:04:15.600]  Yeah.
[3:04:15.600 --> 3:04:16.600]  You like gravel like an old dog?
[3:04:16.600 --> 3:04:17.600]  Yeah.
[3:04:17.600 --> 3:04:22.160]  And I also think, you know, I think that it's, he's probably a simulation.
[3:04:22.160 --> 3:04:23.600]  I think you should buy into this.
[3:04:23.600 --> 3:04:27.600]  He's like one of those things that they put on when they put Tupac Shakur on stage now.
[3:04:27.600 --> 3:04:28.600]  What's it called?
[3:04:28.600 --> 3:04:29.600]  Hologram.
[3:04:29.600 --> 3:04:30.600]  A hologram.
[3:04:30.600 --> 3:04:31.600]  I think it's a hologram.
[3:04:31.600 --> 3:04:32.600]  You couldn't think of the word hologram?
[3:04:32.600 --> 3:04:33.600]  No.
[3:04:33.600 --> 3:04:34.600]  You talked for a little bit.
[3:04:34.600 --> 3:04:36.600]  I slept for three hours last night and it's freezing in here.
[3:04:36.600 --> 3:04:37.600]  My brain doesn't work.
[3:04:37.600 --> 3:04:38.600]  So is the hologram.
[3:04:38.600 --> 3:04:39.600]  Go on.
[3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:40.600]  I don't know.
[3:04:40.600 --> 3:04:42.600]  Do you want to wear my leather jacket?
[3:04:42.600 --> 3:04:45.600]  Could I please wear your leather jacket?
[3:04:45.600 --> 3:04:49.600]  Hey guys, guys, go get the jacket off the wall.
[3:04:49.600 --> 3:04:51.600]  Go get the jacket off the wall.
[3:04:51.600 --> 3:04:52.600]  Bring it in here.
[3:04:52.600 --> 3:04:55.600]  Please bring me Alex Jones' leather jacket.
[3:04:55.600 --> 3:04:56.600]  That has to happen.
[3:04:56.600 --> 3:04:57.600]  This is not my leather jacket.
[3:04:57.600 --> 3:04:58.600]  This is Charlie Sheehan's leather jacket.
[3:04:58.600 --> 3:04:59.600]  Come on.
[3:04:59.600 --> 3:05:00.600]  I'm not joking.
[3:05:00.600 --> 3:05:01.600]  Oh, it's got AIDS.
[3:05:01.600 --> 3:05:05.600]  So when you argue we're enjoying watching the, it's frustrating.
[3:05:05.600 --> 3:05:07.600]  Hey, but let's get serious.
[3:05:07.600 --> 3:05:08.600]  This is a true story.
[3:05:08.600 --> 3:05:10.600]  This is the jet leather jacket worn in Red Dawn.
[3:05:10.600 --> 3:05:14.600]  And I'm also got a big fan, you know, a Millis, John Millis that did the dirty airy stuff.
[3:05:14.600 --> 3:05:15.600]  Yeah.
[3:05:15.600 --> 3:05:16.600]  All that.
[3:05:16.600 --> 3:05:17.600]  His daughter's very, very nice.
[3:05:17.600 --> 3:05:18.600]  So those were the State Department.
[3:05:18.600 --> 3:05:19.600]  They're good guys.
[3:05:19.600 --> 3:05:21.600]  And so this is from Red Dawn, an anti-communist film.
[3:05:21.600 --> 3:05:22.600]  Yeah.
[3:05:22.600 --> 3:05:24.600]  Do you guys bring it in here?
[3:05:24.600 --> 3:05:25.600]  They're doing it right now.
[3:05:25.600 --> 3:05:26.600]  Oh, and you wear this.
[3:05:26.600 --> 3:05:27.600]  This is your daily jacket?
[3:05:27.600 --> 3:05:28.600]  No.
[3:05:28.600 --> 3:05:30.600]  Well, you're a big guy, big muscle wise, but not.
[3:05:30.600 --> 3:05:31.600]  I'm four foot two.
[3:05:31.600 --> 3:05:33.600]  But the thing is, no, you got big muscles.
[3:05:33.600 --> 3:05:34.600]  Show them those guns.
[3:05:34.600 --> 3:05:35.600]  All right.
[3:05:35.600 --> 3:05:36.600]  So this is a smaller jacket.
[3:05:36.600 --> 3:05:37.600]  Oh my gosh.
[3:05:37.600 --> 3:05:39.600]  Come on.
[3:05:39.600 --> 3:05:41.600]  That's from Red Dawn.
[3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:42.600]  I can't wear that.
[3:05:42.600 --> 3:05:43.600]  You haven't framed.
[3:05:43.600 --> 3:05:45.600]  That looks like it's from all the right moves.
[3:05:45.600 --> 3:05:48.600]  Remember when he got thrown off the football team?
[3:05:48.600 --> 3:05:51.600]  Or that one where Hillary Swank had a dog?
[3:05:51.600 --> 3:05:53.600]  Why do you always go back to that movie?
[3:05:53.600 --> 3:05:54.600]  It wasn't even in that.
[3:05:54.600 --> 3:05:55.600]  All right.
[3:05:55.600 --> 3:05:56.600]  I'm not screwing around.
[3:05:56.600 --> 3:05:57.600]  I'll wear it.
[3:05:57.600 --> 3:05:58.600]  Wolverines wasn't a team.
[3:05:58.600 --> 3:05:59.600]  Oh, come on.
[3:05:59.600 --> 3:06:01.600]  Oh, you've got to put this on.
[3:06:01.600 --> 3:06:02.600]  Come on.
[3:06:02.600 --> 3:06:03.600]  This is amazing.
[3:06:03.600 --> 3:06:06.600]  I never, I never dreamt that I would be doing
[3:06:06.600 --> 3:06:08.600]  prop comedy with Alex Jones.
[3:06:08.600 --> 3:06:09.600]  Don't rip it.
[3:06:09.600 --> 3:06:10.600]  I won't rip it.
[3:06:10.600 --> 3:06:11.600]  I'm going to be very gentle.
[3:06:11.600 --> 3:06:12.600]  I'll be too small for it.
[3:06:12.600 --> 3:06:13.600]  What are you talking about?
[3:06:13.600 --> 3:06:15.600]  I'll just pop out of it.
[3:06:15.600 --> 3:06:16.600]  Rip.
[3:06:16.600 --> 3:06:17.600]  It's made for you.
[3:06:17.600 --> 3:06:18.600]  Look at that.
[3:06:18.600 --> 3:06:21.600]  I didn't know they made those in a boy's husky size.
[3:06:21.600 --> 3:06:22.600]  That's amazing.
[3:06:22.600 --> 3:06:23.600]  Thank you.
[3:06:23.600 --> 3:06:24.600]  I'll take two of these.
[3:06:24.600 --> 3:06:25.600]  Oh, look at that.
[3:06:25.600 --> 3:06:26.600]  All right, guys.
[3:06:26.600 --> 3:06:28.600]  Now who wants to go under the bleachers and make out?
[3:06:28.600 --> 3:06:29.600]  You are the best, Alex.
[3:06:29.600 --> 3:06:30.600]  This is great.
[3:06:30.600 --> 3:06:31.600]  Look at that.
[3:06:31.600 --> 3:06:32.600]  Oh, look at that.
[3:06:32.600 --> 3:06:35.600]  It's not going to get any better than this today.
[3:06:35.600 --> 3:06:37.600]  That is the film.
[3:06:37.600 --> 3:06:40.600]  That's when the cover got gone.
[3:06:40.600 --> 3:06:41.600]  That's the one.
[3:06:41.600 --> 3:06:44.600]  This is a real leather jacket that was given to you.
[3:06:44.600 --> 3:06:48.600]  And you keep it, do you have other movie things like this?
[3:06:48.600 --> 3:06:49.600]  No.
[3:06:49.600 --> 3:06:50.600]  And it's dusty.
[3:06:50.600 --> 3:06:51.600]  The top of it's dusty.
[3:06:51.600 --> 3:06:52.600]  If I wouldn't have shown up.
[3:06:52.600 --> 3:06:54.600]  Look at that, Aaron.
[3:06:54.600 --> 3:06:55.600]  Look, look at the screen.
[3:06:55.600 --> 3:06:57.600]  Literally, they're going to be like this jacket.
[3:06:57.600 --> 3:07:03.200]  They're going to have to change the placard to say worn by Charlie Sheen in Red Dawn and
[3:07:03.200 --> 3:07:06.600]  Aaron Berg when he grew a vagina and got too cold in the studio.
[3:07:06.600 --> 3:07:07.600]  Look, I'm him.
[3:07:07.600 --> 3:07:08.600]  Watch.
[3:07:08.600 --> 3:07:12.600]  I got the vaccine.
[3:07:12.600 --> 3:07:13.600]  That's nailed it.
[3:07:13.600 --> 3:07:14.600]  Nailed it.
[3:07:14.600 --> 3:07:15.600]  Nailed it.
[3:07:15.600 --> 3:07:16.600]  I got the vaccine.
[3:07:16.600 --> 3:07:17.600]  You got the vaccine.
[3:07:17.600 --> 3:07:18.600]  We got the vaccine.
[3:07:18.600 --> 3:07:20.600]  It's everybody needs the vaccine.
[3:07:20.600 --> 3:07:23.600]  Oh, this was this was a great cast, by the way, Alex.
[3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:24.600]  You remember these guys?
[3:07:24.600 --> 3:07:25.600]  See Thomas Howell.
[3:07:25.600 --> 3:07:27.600]  Do you remember how good he was?
[3:07:27.600 --> 3:07:28.600]  Boy, you can't stop.
[3:07:28.600 --> 3:07:29.600]  Look at me.
[3:07:29.600 --> 3:07:30.600]  Look how teenage I look.
[3:07:30.600 --> 3:07:31.600]  Now, what is.
[3:07:31.600 --> 3:07:32.600]  Millis made the movie.
[3:07:32.600 --> 3:07:33.600]  Oh, here we go.
[3:07:33.600 --> 3:07:37.600]  They're going to play some music guys.
[3:07:37.600 --> 3:07:38.600]  We're going to listen to it.
[3:07:38.600 --> 3:07:39.600]  What exactly is that?
[3:07:39.600 --> 3:07:40.600]  Oh, yeah.
[3:07:40.600 --> 3:07:43.600]  I got the vaccine.
[3:07:43.600 --> 3:07:45.600]  I mean, and by the way, you know what else Alex?
[3:07:45.600 --> 3:07:49.600]  I always say like they sit there because we're all obviously white supremacist races.
[3:07:49.600 --> 3:07:54.600]  And didn't the attorney general just say because you watch this vaccination stuff.
[3:07:54.600 --> 3:07:58.600]  And I think this is racist in a way because it's like they come over the past year.
[3:07:58.600 --> 3:08:01.600]  They've come forward with no new no new information on it.
[3:08:01.600 --> 3:08:06.600]  And they literally say, but look, we've got stars saying to get the vaccine and you people
[3:08:06.600 --> 3:08:07.600]  you people are so dumb.
[3:08:07.600 --> 3:08:09.600]  You'll get a vaccine and they won't.
[3:08:09.600 --> 3:08:10.600]  No one's buying into it.
[3:08:10.600 --> 3:08:15.600]  But to think that someone would watch like a cartoon or Russell Wilson say get the vaccine
[3:08:15.600 --> 3:08:18.600]  and they'd be like, I'm going to get one like Russell Wilson.
[3:08:18.600 --> 3:08:19.600]  That's right.
[3:08:19.600 --> 3:08:20.600]  You're an eight year old.
[3:08:20.600 --> 3:08:21.600]  Stand up and model the jacket.
[3:08:21.600 --> 3:08:22.600]  Walk around out front.
[3:08:22.600 --> 3:08:23.600]  They think you're stupid.
[3:08:23.600 --> 3:08:24.600]  Hang on.
[3:08:24.600 --> 3:08:25.600]  I got to do.
[3:08:25.600 --> 3:08:26.600]  There you go.
[3:08:26.600 --> 3:08:27.600]  Out front.
[3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:28.600]  Do a little ballerina twirl.
[3:08:28.600 --> 3:08:29.600]  There you go.
[3:08:29.600 --> 3:08:32.600]  It seems like Alex has his own thing going on.
[3:08:32.600 --> 3:08:33.600]  That's right.
[3:08:33.600 --> 3:08:34.600]  That's right.
[3:08:34.600 --> 3:08:36.600]  Show the Wolverine in the back.
[3:08:36.600 --> 3:08:38.600]  That's the whole point.
[3:08:38.600 --> 3:08:40.600]  He's doing the fame.
[3:08:40.600 --> 3:08:41.600]  No, no, no, no.
[3:08:41.600 --> 3:08:42.600]  There you go.
[3:08:42.600 --> 3:08:43.600]  There you go.
[3:08:43.600 --> 3:08:44.600]  All right.
[3:08:44.600 --> 3:08:45.600]  Now there's even more lore to that jacket.
[3:08:45.600 --> 3:08:46.600]  That is great.
[3:08:46.600 --> 3:08:47.600]  Yeah.
[3:08:47.600 --> 3:08:49.600]  No, I'm not into it.
[3:08:49.600 --> 3:08:56.600]  Once I did on some weird auction site, I tried to get the hat that he's also in that movie.
[3:08:56.600 --> 3:08:59.600]  Harry Dean Stanton War in the first alien.
[3:08:59.600 --> 3:09:00.600]  The Nostromo hat.
[3:09:00.600 --> 3:09:03.600]  Oh, and I like bit like a thousand bucks over 10 grand.
[3:09:03.600 --> 3:09:04.600]  Yeah.
[3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:05.600]  You weren't even in the ballpark.
[3:09:05.600 --> 3:09:07.600]  I didn't want that hat, but I didn't get it.
[3:09:07.600 --> 3:09:08.600]  You know what?
[3:09:08.600 --> 3:09:09.600]  You know what I have?
[3:09:09.600 --> 3:09:10.600]  What do I have?
[3:09:10.600 --> 3:09:12.600]  We've talked about this.
[3:09:12.600 --> 3:09:15.600]  You're going to get a Chevy wearing that jacket.
[3:09:15.600 --> 3:09:16.600]  You can't.
[3:09:16.600 --> 3:09:20.600]  I think he was dating Ginger Lynn when he was wearing that.
[3:09:20.600 --> 3:09:21.600]  Oh, God.
[3:09:21.600 --> 3:09:22.600]  Could you imagine?
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:23.600]  Yeah.
[3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:24.600]  I always wanted to be with him.
[3:09:24.600 --> 3:09:25.600]  He said he had that jacket like 10 years.
[3:09:25.600 --> 3:09:26.600]  He wore it.
[3:09:26.600 --> 3:09:28.600]  I think he was dating Nina Hartley when he wore that hat.
[3:09:28.600 --> 3:09:29.600]  Oh, Nina Hartley.
[3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:30.600]  All right, guys.
[3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:31.600]  Aaron Berg, Gino Bisconti.
[3:09:31.600 --> 3:09:34.600]  Where are you guys playing tonight?
[3:09:34.600 --> 3:09:35.600]  Tonight we're off.
[3:09:35.600 --> 3:09:36.600]  We're going to hang out here all day.
[3:09:36.600 --> 3:09:37.600]  We're going to go over to Rogan.
[3:09:37.600 --> 3:09:39.600]  Yeah, we're getting some drinks to go to see Rogan.
[3:09:39.600 --> 3:09:42.600]  Bisconti sounds like a delicious Italian meal.
[3:09:42.600 --> 3:09:43.600]  Bisconti.
[3:09:43.600 --> 3:09:44.600]  I've been saying Bisconi.
[3:09:44.600 --> 3:09:46.600]  No, you're saying it perfectly correct.
[3:09:46.600 --> 3:09:47.600]  All right, guys.
[3:09:47.600 --> 3:09:48.600]  We love you.
[3:09:48.600 --> 3:09:49.600]  Matt Braggin.
[3:09:49.600 --> 3:09:50.600]  Thank you.
[3:09:50.600 --> 3:09:56.100]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating
[3:09:56.100 --> 3:10:00.600]  naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade
[3:10:00.600 --> 3:10:01.600]  targeted pollutants.
[3:10:01.600 --> 3:10:06.900]  For the first time, the bio-pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation
[3:10:06.900 --> 3:10:08.920]  products to the everyday consumer.
[3:10:08.920 --> 3:10:13.600]  Their first product they are launching is called Bioseptic Pro, a product specifically
[3:10:13.600 --> 3:10:16.600]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:20.940]  Bioseptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[3:10:20.940 --> 3:10:22.840]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[3:10:22.840 --> 3:10:27.920]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective
[3:10:27.920 --> 3:10:32.760]  than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[3:10:32.760 --> 3:10:37.200]  Bioseptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[3:10:37.200 --> 3:10:41.240]  Visit thebio-pros.com today and protect your septic system.

[3:10:43.240 --> 3:10:47.320]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[3:10:47.320 --> 3:10:48.320]  Thebio-pros.com.
[3:10:48.320 --> 3:10:52.840]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[3:10:52.840 --> 3:10:53.840]  You're on the air.
[3:10:53.840 --> 3:10:54.840]  Thanks for holding.
[3:10:54.840 --> 3:10:55.840]  Hello.
[3:10:55.840 --> 3:10:56.840]  Can you hear me?
[3:10:56.840 --> 3:10:57.840]  Yeah.
[3:10:57.840 --> 3:10:58.840]  We're just starting right here at the entire Rize star man.
[3:10:58.840 --> 3:11:02.840]  I just wanted to talk to you, bro and it's a pleasure to be talking right now here man.
[3:11:02.840 --> 3:11:03.840]  Sure.
[3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:04.840]  It's an honor to talk to you brother.
[3:11:04.840 --> 3:11:09.380]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut and I just want to plug in.
[3:11:09.380 --> 3:11:11.180]  I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[3:11:11.180 --> 3:11:15.680]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[3:11:15.680 --> 3:11:17.920]  We are all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[3:11:17.920 --> 3:11:24.880]  Puerto Ricans. We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rola and I have lost weight because I
[3:11:24.880 --> 3:11:29.280]  started drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you for that man. Well brother we put more
[3:11:29.280 --> 3:11:34.640]  in this than any other long-term high-quality energy powder there is. So this this was designed
[3:11:34.640 --> 3:11:38.000]  on one of the top guys in the country. He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:41.760]  issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it and we believe
[3:11:41.760 --> 3:11:46.320]  it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your
[3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:49.440]  life better so that means a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you.
[3:11:53.040 --> 3:11:55.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:55.680 --> 3:12:19.840]  Live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones and now your host Matt Bracken.
[3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:29.680]  It's pretty tough to follow comedians because almost anything you say after
[3:12:30.480 --> 3:12:37.440]  you know an hour of laughing is going to be kind of a black pill so I don't have any jokes on Q.
[3:12:38.160 --> 3:12:44.800]  I'll just like to say it's pretty um it is kind of amusing that Rogan wound up just blocks from
[3:12:44.800 --> 3:12:51.120]  the InfoWars studio. I wonder if that's a coincidence. It certainly is showing a migration
[3:12:51.120 --> 3:12:56.720]  and that'll just mean the physical migration with Rogan leaving California for Texas.
[3:12:58.560 --> 3:13:02.720]  People that are that go on InfoWars they know they're burning their bridge back to the
[3:13:03.280 --> 3:13:11.280]  to the you know the mainstream media networks. Once you've once you've been on Alex you've got
[3:13:11.280 --> 3:13:18.400]  no chance of sitting on the curvy couch with the Fox and Friends. No chance so it's a decision that
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:24.000]  more and more of us are making and you know what the heck I would rather be on the out with the
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:30.560]  advanced party than you know back with the corporate titans. You can probably make more
[3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:36.160]  money that way in the short run but you know what is it what's it for if you're always
[3:13:36.160 --> 3:13:42.080]  muscling yourself and let's be sure there's there's very few people in Fox that have free
[3:13:42.080 --> 3:13:48.480]  reign to talk. I mean if they do it all you certainly can't talk about vote fraud. You can
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:53.920]  only obliquely mention it like you can say that there's a news story in Arizona something to do
[3:13:53.920 --> 3:13:59.840]  with audits but you don't dare say that this election was stolen and the current occupant of
[3:13:59.840 --> 3:14:06.800]  the White House was installed you know by the intelligence community that's running every
[3:14:06.800 --> 3:14:14.880]  aspect of our country now. But anyway here I can say whatever I want and I'm gonna it's gonna seem
[3:14:14.880 --> 3:14:19.920]  like I've got a couple of different topics today but I'm going to tie it all back to the American
[3:14:19.920 --> 3:14:28.320]  domestic situation. I'm going to go weigh a field at the very beginning just to set up set this all
[3:14:28.320 --> 3:14:37.600]  up. Last fall there was a 44 day war that almost nobody paid any attention to but the generals
[3:14:37.600 --> 3:14:45.040]  paid a lot of attention. This was a war really it was a war between Turkey and Russia using the
[3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:53.520]  proxies of Azerbaijan and Armenia in a little corner of Azerbaijan called Nagorno-Karabakh
[3:14:53.520 --> 3:15:02.880]  and why this is significant this is the first war that was won by drones. This was the first
[3:15:02.880 --> 3:15:09.280]  top-down drone strike war and it's revolutionizing the way people think about modern combat
[3:15:10.400 --> 3:15:17.360]  including our own military. Now with enemy drones overhead and you can't you can't just
[3:15:17.360 --> 3:15:22.560]  depend on the fact that we'll always control the sky. With enemy drones overhead there's no
[3:15:22.560 --> 3:15:29.600]  such thing as camouflage anymore. It's almost impossible. A camouflage net over top of a fighting
[3:15:29.600 --> 3:15:36.160]  position you know is just a waste of time. You know you might as well be you know an Indian
[3:15:36.160 --> 3:15:42.160]  wearing special magic beads that will keep the white man from seeing you. It just doesn't work
[3:15:42.160 --> 3:15:51.360]  that way. The Turks provided Azerbaijan with modern drone systems both to provide surveillance
[3:15:51.360 --> 3:15:58.560]  and to drop weapons on the Armenians and these weapons came straight down so having a tank with
[3:15:58.560 --> 3:16:04.560]  great armor all around the sides and especially on the front it meant nothing because these missiles
[3:16:04.560 --> 3:16:10.080]  would just drop straight through the thin top armor taking out hundreds if not thousands of them.
[3:16:11.040 --> 3:16:16.400]  The Armenians were defeated in 44 days and had to surrender because there was no option
[3:16:16.400 --> 3:16:24.720]  and anybody that thinks that in an American civil war context that people will be out in the forest
[3:16:24.720 --> 3:16:32.160]  playing Robin Hood it's a fantasy. If the enemy controls the sky and you have to assume that they
[3:16:32.160 --> 3:16:40.400]  will there's no hiding in trees there's no hiding in you know in the weeds. You're going to be seen
[3:16:40.400 --> 3:16:48.160]  on thermal and by many other systems not just thermal and taking it back to the an hour ago
[3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:57.360]  Alex played the recruiting ad showing the woke American female soldier you know with the two
[3:16:57.360 --> 3:17:04.640]  lesbian parents how proud she was to be representing woke them joining the military coming out of her
[3:17:04.640 --> 3:17:11.440]  woke college sorority. You can laugh and say wow that that that woman what chance is she going to
[3:17:11.440 --> 3:17:18.880]  have when our soldiers are going up against Russian male soldiers well they won't they're
[3:17:18.880 --> 3:17:26.720]  going to be operating a drone looking for American patriots and that woman that woke female soldier
[3:17:27.360 --> 3:17:34.240]  she's going to have absolutely no qualms about reading a name off of a list typing it in to
[3:17:34.240 --> 3:17:42.560]  google finding the house and putting the crosshair on your chimney. She'll be told that the person
[3:17:42.560 --> 3:17:51.120]  that they're dropping the missile on is a white racist extremist domestic terrorist she won't be
[3:17:51.120 --> 3:17:56.960]  in charge of deciding who's on the list this is something that's been learned going back to you
[3:17:56.960 --> 3:18:04.720]  know the the Russian revolution the Nazis in Germany if you split up the responsibility one
[3:18:04.720 --> 3:18:09.360]  guy makes the list he doesn't kill anybody he just passes the list through the bureaucracy
[3:18:10.080 --> 3:18:16.560]  somebody else just puts them on a train and takes them from A to B only at the at the other end
[3:18:16.560 --> 3:18:22.880]  does somebody take them to a ditch or into a gas chamber so it's going to be very easy for the
[3:18:22.880 --> 3:18:30.480]  woke female to put the cursor marker on top of the roof of a house and weapons have been developed
[3:18:30.480 --> 3:18:37.120]  that will mean very little collateral damage so if you're thinking in terms of well I'll never
[3:18:37.120 --> 3:18:42.720]  give up my guns you know Mullen Labe come and take it they're not going to send they're not
[3:18:42.720 --> 3:18:48.560]  going to need to send a SWAT team to your house after they've after they've made you an enemy of
[3:18:48.560 --> 3:18:56.240]  this state and step by step taken away your freedoms you know taken away your your credit cards
[3:18:56.240 --> 3:19:03.200]  taken you know got you fired from your job by having the Stasi FBI do a whisper campaign at work
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:10.000]  going to your neighbors and implying that you're some kind of an extremist turning them into
[3:19:10.000 --> 3:19:17.440]  informants against you by this time you're going to be waiting for the knock at the door it won't
[3:19:17.440 --> 3:19:22.000]  come if they finally determine that you're just a hardcore guy that's never going to give up the
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:27.520]  guns they'll put one through your roof and don't think they won't what makes you think that they'll
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:33.760]  play their weakness to your strength they might be evil and they might be you know virtually
[3:19:33.760 --> 3:19:38.800]  communists whether or not they're wearing the hammer and sickle on the uniform is irrelevant
[3:19:38.800 --> 3:19:45.200]  they are Marxists they're going to use their strength against our weakness so that that woke
[3:19:45.200 --> 3:19:51.840]  female soldier she's not going to need to do 20 pull-ups you know she's not going to need to to
[3:19:51.840 --> 3:19:57.680]  run up mountains with a pack on her back she's just going to need to sit in an office and from two
[3:19:57.680 --> 3:20:05.680]  states away put a cursor on your roof somebody else will be fueling the drone somebody else will
[3:20:05.680 --> 3:20:11.200]  be monitoring the drone you see how it's all it can all be divided up into different missions
[3:20:11.200 --> 3:20:17.760]  one person makes the list one person puts the X on the house another person arms the drone
[3:20:18.480 --> 3:20:24.320]  everybody goes home and sleeps well at night they'll be told all they've done is eliminate
[3:20:24.880 --> 3:20:33.360]  you know reactionary capitalist boomer white racist domestic extremists and so don't think
[3:20:33.360 --> 3:20:38.320]  and i'm not against people training i'm not against people buying all the weapons they'll
[3:20:38.320 --> 3:20:44.480]  they'll probably come in necessary but the real fight is now before it gets to the drone war stage
[3:20:45.120 --> 3:20:49.760]  right now is when we have to start fighting and i'll explain how the other side of the break

[3:24:44.720 --> 3:25:00.640]  war store dot com in game blueprint for global enslavement you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:25:00.640 --> 3:25:22.160]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's matt bracken you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:25:22.160 --> 3:25:32.000]  we were just discussing our our new woke military which is actively recruiting
[3:25:32.640 --> 3:25:40.080]  from the wokest of our of our society we've also seen the cia they're recruiting the same
[3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:52.320]  you know identity politics gay lesbian people identifying you know clearly as as against
[3:25:52.320 --> 3:25:59.840]  the traditional american values they're recruiting them at the same time they're purging traditional
[3:25:59.840 --> 3:26:06.240]  heritage americans out of the military this is important because there's only one reason why
[3:26:06.240 --> 3:26:12.480]  they're doing this they want a military that's going to be ready to attack americans it won't
[3:26:12.480 --> 3:26:19.680]  matter that our military can't defend itself against china or russia for that matter because
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:25.120]  that's not what our military is being geared up for now you know even after the mccain and the
[3:26:25.120 --> 3:26:32.800]  Fitzgerald crisis accidents collisions where our best destroyers couldn't manage to get out of the
[3:26:32.800 --> 3:26:40.320]  way of big fat slow tankers our military didn't take any corrective action instead they increased
[3:26:40.320 --> 3:26:49.120]  the the recruiting of the woke and they've been downplaying meritocracy they've put they've put
[3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:58.880]  the the diversity and inclusion and equity at the very top priority over anything else so now we
[3:26:58.880 --> 3:27:07.280]  have ships and missile batteries and other you know high-tech high-tech installations and weapon
[3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:15.120]  systems being run by absolute idiots because nobody in command can say you can't promote that
[3:27:15.120 --> 3:27:21.760]  person they're not qualified they haven't passed the test instead they get rid of the test because
[3:27:21.760 --> 3:27:28.560]  all that matters is that the right identity politics minorities are promoted well this means
[3:27:28.560 --> 3:27:35.760]  in no way are they going to be ready to fight a near pier or or a tier one country like china
[3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:41.120]  it's just not going to happen so do the do our generals these woke generals the ones that have
[3:27:41.120 --> 3:27:46.800]  stayed in i mean the rest are just hiding until hiding under their desk until they can retire
[3:27:47.360 --> 3:27:52.560]  but the woke generals that have been promoted do they think they're going to be fighting china and
[3:27:52.560 --> 3:27:57.520]  losing a war they're not stupid no they're not going to fight china they're going to let china
[3:27:57.520 --> 3:28:04.400]  do whatever china wants to do the military is being turned into an anti-american patriot hunting
[3:28:04.400 --> 3:28:13.040]  machine that's the purpose of purging out traditional americans and recruiting woke marxists
[3:28:13.600 --> 3:28:20.720]  that is the very point now i was talking briefly about this little negorno-carabac war
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:28.720]  which is the first war that was won by unmanned aerial systems also known as UAVs or drones
[3:28:29.760 --> 3:28:39.360]  this war literally was won by the eye in the sky not not uh tom cruise or uh you know top gun flying
[3:28:39.360 --> 3:28:46.320]  around and fighter jets dog fighting no it was won by drones the drones weren't made by america or
[3:28:46.320 --> 3:28:51.920]  russia they were made by turkey so this shows that even a you know a second tier country
[3:28:52.560 --> 3:28:59.440]  with a strong industrial base can surprise the world and come out with a a fully developed
[3:28:59.440 --> 3:29:07.040]  drone program and it absolutely just whipped the armenians the armenians were fighting like it was
[3:29:07.040 --> 3:29:14.000]  you know 20 years ago putting up the camouflage and absolutely being destroyed from above
[3:29:14.000 --> 3:29:22.400]  as a result of this all the militaries around the world have been seeking systems to take out drones
[3:29:23.040 --> 3:29:28.160]  so drones can range obviously from your little quad rotor that you bought it you know bought off
[3:29:28.160 --> 3:29:36.960]  of amazon up to predators and reapers but these small battlefield drones that might be you know
[3:29:36.960 --> 3:29:44.080]  a distance of a few kilometers away all of the militaries are developing systems both laser and
[3:29:44.080 --> 3:29:51.680]  directed energy microwave pulse directed energy weapons obviously they need something to take
[3:29:51.680 --> 3:29:56.560]  out these drones that have been so effectively you know shown to be so effective at dropping
[3:29:56.560 --> 3:30:02.960]  missiles straight on to troop concentrations and armor but something else has been going on and
[3:30:02.960 --> 3:30:10.160]  i'm going to tie this back to this this war against american patriots in a minute i've been hearing
[3:30:10.160 --> 3:30:17.680]  a lot of reports about this so-called havana syndrome where it began five or six years ago
[3:30:17.680 --> 3:30:24.880]  with diplomats in havana coming down with headaches migraines vertigo loss of memory
[3:30:25.920 --> 3:30:32.320]  and it seems to be tying back into these microwave pulse directed energy weapons
[3:30:32.320 --> 3:30:42.480]  so at the same time while not only america but china russia india iran israel everybody is working
[3:30:42.480 --> 3:30:51.360]  on these directed energy weapons these microwave weapons for the purpose of knocking drones out
[3:30:51.360 --> 3:31:00.240]  of the sky but something else has been happening in parallel and in great secrecy all of these
[3:31:00.240 --> 3:31:07.440]  countries have been developing smaller more portable versions to be used in an anti-personnel
[3:31:07.440 --> 3:31:13.840]  role now if you if you look these subjects up you'll find some stories fairly recently about
[3:31:14.640 --> 3:31:21.520]  american diplomats and other people even in america one happening like last fall around the
[3:31:21.520 --> 3:31:28.320]  white house being hit with these directed energy weapons and in the news stories it's always the
[3:31:28.320 --> 3:31:34.320]  russians well we think it could only be the gru the that's the russian military intelligence
[3:31:35.200 --> 3:31:41.840]  but the fact is that all of these countries have been developing microwave weapons against
[3:31:41.840 --> 3:31:47.920]  drones in the sky and they've also been i'm only it's only hypothetical at this point
[3:31:48.480 --> 3:31:53.920]  developing much more portable weapons that can either be hidden in a small vehicle to
[3:31:53.920 --> 3:32:00.720]  drive around in a city or even be put into a backpack or a pair of backpacks with soldiers
[3:32:00.720 --> 3:32:09.360]  sharing components because those power sources are fairly bulky etc but these weapons have been used
[3:32:09.360 --> 3:32:17.280]  against people i have absolutely no doubt i've got multiple confirmation of stories where
[3:32:17.280 --> 3:32:24.480]  these weapons are used against enemies that have been for example in the act of planting ied's or
[3:32:24.480 --> 3:32:31.280]  setting up missiles to fire at american bases in the middle east this is a gray zone weapon because
[3:32:31.280 --> 3:32:39.120]  if you used a predator with a hellfire and you cratered a couple of uh let's just say hypothetically
[3:32:39.120 --> 3:32:47.600]  iranians who were not in iran in the act of doing something against american interests
[3:32:48.480 --> 3:32:54.400]  if you crater them with a hellfire it's pretty obvious what happened and a tit for tat results
[3:32:54.960 --> 3:33:01.600]  but what if you use a gray area weapon what if you use a man portable microwave directed
[3:33:01.600 --> 3:33:08.720]  energy weapon to fry them in place there's no bullet there's no bullet hole there's no impact
[3:33:08.720 --> 3:33:16.640]  there's no bomb no explosion the guys are disabled and maybe the next day they're suffering radiation
[3:33:16.640 --> 3:33:23.520]  burns and die but these weapons can be obviously dialed down and i don't have personal knowledge
[3:33:23.520 --> 3:33:28.880]  of this that that's that one that you see on the screen that's an indian version for anti-drone
[3:33:29.520 --> 3:33:36.240]  but you can imagine you take you can scale it down you can adjust these things and size them
[3:33:36.240 --> 3:33:42.400]  for different purposes and there are reports of these being you know affected that ranges out to
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:48.800]  a thousand meters in an anti-personnel role and if the amount of energy given to somebody
[3:33:49.360 --> 3:33:56.400]  is smaller they may just get the Havana syndrome you know the headaches the vertigo the memory loss
[3:33:57.360 --> 3:34:04.880]  but if if the energy is greater there have been a number of american flag rank officers
[3:34:04.880 --> 3:34:10.720]  and others who have reason to be on the ground in the middle east that have come down with rapid
[3:34:10.720 --> 3:34:18.080]  cancer and there's a lot of suspicion but you see this is a gray area there's no bullet there's no
[3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:25.040]  sniper rifle you've just got an admiral or a general who comes down with rapid cancer in
[3:34:25.040 --> 3:34:32.880]  the thyroid or the or the or the brain so there's there's a lot of this going back and forth it's
[3:34:32.880 --> 3:34:39.200]  not just russians or chinese attacking americans i think that there's like a shadow war going on
[3:34:39.200 --> 3:34:47.280]  with these weapons and eventually we might see these weapons used in america against us and i'm
[3:34:47.280 --> 3:34:51.680]  going to cover that on the other side we here at info wars are proud to announce the first ever

[3:39:23.360 --> 3:39:32.320]  you can you can get my uh my books from amazon in print kindle and audible but if you get them for
[3:39:32.320 --> 3:39:40.560]  me um jeff bezos doesn't get the money and i'll even sign them i was i was talking i've been
[3:39:40.560 --> 3:39:51.680]  talking about drone warfare and the rise of counter drone or cuas counter unmanned aerial systems
[3:39:53.440 --> 3:40:01.040]  counter drone warfare is booming and it comes down to very short range kinetic you know
[3:40:01.040 --> 3:40:10.000]  nets things like that then medium range uh microwave and then long range laser this negorna
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:17.920]  caribac war between azure by john using turkish weapons and armenia this little enclave in eastern
[3:40:17.920 --> 3:40:24.960]  azure by john it's the first time that it that it at armor was taken out by lasers from above
[3:40:24.960 --> 3:40:33.280]  you know this is directed energy a laser we're in a whole new era there's a military writer you
[3:40:33.280 --> 3:40:38.880]  if you watch the history channel you've probably seen him talking about tank warfare named john
[3:40:38.880 --> 3:40:46.000]  and tell a n t a l and he just wrote a very short piece called 10 lessons from the second
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:55.600]  in negorna caribac war the first war won primarily with unmanned aerial systems this is a revolution
[3:40:56.160 --> 3:41:05.200]  in military affairs he says at the level of the 1973 yam kippur war which was an armor war
[3:41:05.200 --> 3:41:11.760]  fought in the synipe peninsula between egypt and israel using modern systems like wire guided
[3:41:11.760 --> 3:41:19.040]  anti-tank missiles but this is a this is very profound and the the azure by johnny forces with
[3:41:19.040 --> 3:41:28.880]  turkish backing controlled all of the battle spaces sea air land cyber they and information they
[3:41:28.880 --> 3:41:36.960]  they just they just wiped armenia this armenian enclave not armenia the armenian section of
[3:41:36.960 --> 3:41:44.080]  azure by john they just fought it to defeat in 44 days so now the world is scrambling to come up
[3:41:44.080 --> 3:41:52.880]  with anti drone weapons and a big part of that are these microwave pulse directed energy weapons
[3:41:52.880 --> 3:42:01.040]  and all it takes is is miniaturizing these for an anti personnel role so this is still a very
[3:42:01.040 --> 3:42:09.760]  black dark secret area that you won't find in any military manuals yet this is still at the level
[3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:18.560]  of of you know spooks and maybe tier one operators getting their hands on these but these are being
[3:42:18.560 --> 3:42:25.760]  used against people they're being used against diplomats i think more or less in a in a testing
[3:42:25.760 --> 3:42:35.120]  way i've i've linked to a few different articles today one is one tells a woman a female diplomat
[3:42:35.120 --> 3:42:43.520]  standing in her kitchen visible from the window this is in cuba she here feels the the ringing
[3:42:43.520 --> 3:42:54.400]  tone in her in her ears and uh she's disabled after that neurologically damaged other people
[3:42:54.400 --> 3:42:59.440]  in the same building were not affected so it's thought that these things are highly directional
[3:42:59.440 --> 3:43:08.480]  highly amable so like a a deniable sniper weapon and they can be dialed i'm my hypothesis they can
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:16.480]  be dialed up for an immediate you know disability like a battlefield use or they can be dialed down
[3:43:17.520 --> 3:43:23.520]  and if they can get into a position where they can give you doses so to speak over a period of time
[3:43:23.520 --> 3:43:29.360]  like a diplomat in a mission in an office where they can hit you with this over a period of time
[3:43:29.920 --> 3:43:38.480]  you might develop other effects what it sounds like when you're being beamed people describe it as
[3:43:38.480 --> 3:43:46.880]  a high pitched grating noise with the sound coming from inside your own head that sounds pretty cool
[3:43:46.880 --> 3:43:52.560]  or if you've ever heard this like low pressure buffeting if you're on the highway with a window
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:59.200]  cracked and it makes that like buffeting sound other people have described it as that now the
[3:43:59.200 --> 3:44:06.880]  longer you're you're in this cone the worse the damage is going to be so if you're aware of this
[3:44:06.880 --> 3:44:13.600]  already get out of the area move laterally get behind other cover you'll get out of the path
[3:44:13.600 --> 3:44:19.520]  of the beam the longer you're in it the worse the effect is going to be and there's no question
[3:44:19.520 --> 3:44:24.880]  these things are being used now if you look up on you know if you just do a search on the internet
[3:44:24.880 --> 3:44:30.240]  for these microwave directed energy weapons you're going to see these big systems that are sitting
[3:44:30.240 --> 3:44:36.480]  on top of trucks or armor those are for like knocking a drone out of the air kilometers away
[3:44:37.440 --> 3:44:44.240]  i'm talking about things that are man portable and the military that we have today which is
[3:44:44.240 --> 3:44:51.440]  turning so woke where they look at american patriots they look at at you know at least 75
[3:44:51.440 --> 3:44:59.520]  million trump voters as domestic enemies the same military that is purging you know traditional
[3:44:59.520 --> 3:45:06.560]  patriots out of the military and recruiting woke marxists they're going to have no problem
[3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:13.840]  whatsoever turning weapons like this against americans before i spoke about how the the woke
[3:45:13.840 --> 3:45:20.080]  soldier from the ad won't have a problem putting the cursor on top of the roof of a house that's
[3:45:20.080 --> 3:45:28.080]  for a kinetic strike but how much easier will it be to use a deniable weapon a weapon that
[3:45:28.080 --> 3:45:34.480]  causes an illness that causes disability you can't think you can't remember you have you lose your
[3:45:34.480 --> 3:45:43.520]  balance you may in in high dosage cases develop rapid cancer and what do you say oh i'm going to
[3:45:43.520 --> 3:45:49.920]  go to the news and say i think that uh some intelligence agency hit me with a with a microwave
[3:45:49.920 --> 3:45:56.800]  beam they won't take you seriously they'll throw you in a rubber room so in that sense it's a
[3:45:56.800 --> 3:46:03.440]  perfect weapon to use because it unlike a drone dropping a small missile through your roof and
[3:46:03.440 --> 3:46:09.200]  i'm sure in the later stages of a civil war they would get to that but how much easier will it be
[3:46:09.200 --> 3:46:18.320]  to take people who are just a a pain in the neck to the deep state and take them off of the information
[3:46:18.320 --> 3:46:25.760]  war battlefield by hitting them with a directed energy weapon that doesn't leave a visible scar on
[3:46:25.760 --> 3:46:35.120]  the outside these weapons are extremely secret at this point but they're real and they are they are
[3:46:35.120 --> 3:46:40.480]  being developed and they are being used and not just by our foreign enemies against american
[3:46:40.480 --> 3:46:48.560]  diplomats i know that they have been used by american military or other spooks against america's
[3:46:48.560 --> 3:46:55.840]  enemies you know in a in a good cause where those people are preparing to you know attack americans
[3:46:57.440 --> 3:47:03.280]  but we've seen the misuse of these weapons by our intelligence community we've seen the cia
[3:47:03.280 --> 3:47:10.160]  weaponized along with the fbi and turned against americans and i'm just trying to put the word out
[3:47:10.160 --> 3:47:17.600]  now in advance if you hear about somebody who develops you know thyroid cancer or brain cancer
[3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:24.240]  in a matter of weeks after they've been complaining about vertigo and and you know neurological
[3:47:24.240 --> 3:47:34.880]  problems think about this the syndrome resembles a persistent concussion like it like a football
[3:47:34.880 --> 3:47:43.600]  injury that in rats that they subjected to these microwaves they have the same neurotrauma as a
[3:47:43.600 --> 3:47:50.560]  blast injury so anybody that's been in war that comes down with these syndromes they could say
[3:47:50.560 --> 3:47:57.760]  well maybe it's a late result of chromatic brain injury but this is a very usable weapon
[3:47:57.760 --> 3:48:05.440]  because it's in this gray zone and it's deniable and so far nobody is even admitting that such
[3:48:05.440 --> 3:48:11.920]  weapons exist but if you know you have to do a pretty good search on the internet to find these
[3:48:11.920 --> 3:48:18.720]  weapons and you'll just see them you know huge on trucks the ones that are being used anti personnel
[3:48:18.720 --> 3:48:24.960]  as far as i know that none have ever been shown none has ever been seen they're an extremely
[3:48:25.520 --> 3:48:32.560]  extremely classified part of any intelligence or defense budget but be aware of it and if you're
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:38.800]  somebody that you know might be a target of the deep state just be aware of the symptoms if you
[3:48:38.800 --> 3:48:46.080]  just hear this the high-pitched grating wine sound from inside your own brain you know move
[3:48:46.080 --> 3:48:54.000]  it might not just be your imagination this is very real and that the military that we have
[3:48:54.000 --> 3:49:00.560]  today unfortunately you know we have had some general sign a letter but that's no big deal
[3:49:00.560 --> 3:49:08.240]  that's no impediment our military is moving full speed to turn into an anti-american marxist
[3:49:08.240 --> 3:49:15.040]  revolutionary force that's why they don't care about our ships getting slammed by tankers that's
[3:49:15.040 --> 3:49:22.160]  not the war they're making our military prepared for the war they're making our military prepared
[3:49:22.160 --> 3:49:31.040]  for is a war against us the deplorables and i i wish it wasn't so but that's how it is
[3:49:31.040 --> 3:49:43.840]  and i'll uh i'll see you next time talk to you later
