[01:46.080 --> 01:50.480]  wanted to get him on obviously last Friday when it came out that they have
[01:50.480 --> 01:57.360]  that super secret spy plane that can fly in to space and out of space and they
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.680]  tested it by launching on a rocket at tens of thousands of miles an hour and
[02:02.680 --> 02:07.080]  so we're going to be talking about that with dr. Bob Bowman it can go what from
[02:07.080 --> 02:12.800]  London to Tokyo in one hour and that's just the tip of the iceberg with the
[02:12.800 --> 02:18.480]  secret science systems that are out there so that's coming up now that said
[02:18.480 --> 02:24.720]  all Hades is broken loose the drudge report as of I guess midnight last night
[02:24.720 --> 02:30.480]  linked to our report big sis's latest terrorist more white Americans and I
[02:30.480 --> 02:33.960]  meant to call Paul Watson yesterday when he wrote this article to have him add
[02:33.960 --> 02:39.080]  the central point because he just dryly reports the facts if there was any doubt
[02:39.080 --> 02:43.760]  that all these other PSAs where everyone in the videos is a white person who's a
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.480]  terrorist and it's quote minorities that are reporting them if anybody was
[02:48.480 --> 02:52.520]  doubting this was meant to create racial division and brand whites as the
[02:52.520 --> 02:59.120]  new terrorist you know as the one group you got a look at this new PSA is just
[02:59.120 --> 03:04.320]  the cherry on top the final word on it and Homeland Security's announced
[03:04.320 --> 03:08.000]  they're gonna roll out a bunch more of these videos so they're clearly as you
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.080]  seen the vice president and the president others rebranding the domestic
[03:12.080 --> 03:16.360]  tea party threat if they can't beat a political movement that is identifying
[03:16.360 --> 03:20.360]  the private Federal Reserve and going after the power structure then they are
[03:20.360 --> 03:26.040]  simply going to demonize it so more on that information today I'd like to get
[03:26.040 --> 03:31.400]  your your take on that issue specifically if you're a police officer a

[03:44.280 --> 03:47.840]  rollout do you agree that returning veterans are the number one threat to
[03:47.840 --> 03:52.480]  America and that conservatives and libertarians are the threat do you agree

[10:00.560 --> 10:05.600]  guys are our dark skinned reporting on the evil white people that the media has
[10:05.600 --> 10:10.360]  branded as as as the Tea Party and the Tea Party is open to everybody it's a
[10:10.360 --> 10:13.480]  movement for liberty and freedom and getting government under control but
[10:13.480 --> 10:22.160]  the but the establishment dinosaur media has come out and said that the Tea
[10:22.160 --> 10:26.200]  Party is white and white only and racist and yes they're getting ready to start
[10:26.200 --> 10:31.120]  bombing and so we're gonna have to use the police and the army on them and you've
[10:31.120 --> 10:35.480]  got all the White House memos and White House advisors we read yesterday saying
[10:35.480 --> 10:39.640]  minus a new Oklahoma City or 9-11 they're not gonna be able to get their
[10:39.640 --> 10:45.400]  agenda through of gun control open borders massive tax increases globalization
[10:45.400 --> 10:52.360]  the end of our sovereignty the green police all of it so it is on big time
[10:52.360 --> 10:57.360]  and I'm opening the phones up ahead of Max Kaiser joining us on the economy
[10:57.360 --> 11:00.480]  coming up in about an hour and 20 minutes from now dr. Bob Bowman former
[11:00.480 --> 11:08.200]  head of the Star Wars SDI program he'll be joining us to break down why are they
[11:08.200 --> 11:11.800]  now rolling out a lot of the secret space planes that they've had for a
[11:11.800 --> 11:15.800]  long time why are they now telling the public about that and what can he tell
[11:15.800 --> 11:21.640]  us that is in the declassified realm but not popularly and commonly known so
[11:21.640 --> 11:29.240]  that'll be the last 30 minutes of the transmission today but mr. Biden the
[11:29.240 --> 11:33.360]  vice president is over in China publicly begging them to prop up the dollar
[11:33.360 --> 11:38.360]  further and to buy the worthless treasury bills that the Federal Reserve is
[11:38.360 --> 11:43.600]  buying 75 plus percent of that economist don't even corrected me they say Alex
[11:43.600 --> 11:48.400]  that 75% was a year ago the Federal Reserve is now monetizing over 80%
[11:48.400 --> 11:55.240]  well whatever the point is is that we're going into a hyperinflationary spiral
[11:55.240 --> 12:00.200]  will we go all the way to Weimar Republic status or Zimbabwe in inflation I
[12:00.200 --> 12:05.320]  certainly hope not but we it is definitely accelerating right now and
[12:05.320 --> 12:09.760]  the system's been trying to deny that but the facts are starting to come out
[12:09.760 --> 12:15.000]  global markets tumble amid jitters about debt and the economy world stock
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.560]  markets tumbled and gold shot to a new record high Thursday on renewed worries
[12:19.560 --> 12:26.680]  about Europe's debt crisis and a weak US economic data US home sales are
[12:26.680 --> 12:31.880]  plunging at record rates the stock market was down 450 points it went back up
[12:31.880 --> 12:37.480]  about 50 points and now started its drop again it's down 421.22 on the
[12:37.480 --> 12:45.640]  Dow Jones industrial average NASDAQ's down 118 S&P down 48 so we'll continue to
[12:45.640 --> 12:52.680]  break all of that down as it unfolds the global rush by governments institutions
[12:52.680 --> 12:59.480]  like universities and major companies to grab gold is on I only wish I would have
[12:59.480 --> 13:05.800]  listened to my wife five years ago she said honey you're keeping a bunch of
[13:05.800 --> 13:10.720]  money in the company bank account as an emergency backup to run in full wars in
[13:10.720 --> 13:16.280]  prison planet and we have no reserves basically of our own and she said they
[13:16.280 --> 13:19.760]  could devalue that you're the one saying buy gold and I said well I've bought
[13:19.760 --> 13:25.800]  our personal gold and silver but I'm keeping this in reserves to basically
[13:25.800 --> 13:30.600]  as we go into this depression keep this operation going at least for a while if
[13:30.600 --> 13:36.120]  things totally collapse but she's right I wish I would have bought gold when it
[13:36.120 --> 13:42.320]  was $800 a thousand dollars for the backup NASDAQ for this operation because
[13:42.320 --> 13:47.120]  now I'm spending the cash we have saved regardless to start the TV show and the
[13:47.120 --> 13:51.040]  other news programs we're going to build around it but even though I sit here and
[13:51.040 --> 13:54.560]  give people advice all day about getting the gold get into silver I
[13:54.560 --> 13:59.600]  understand it sounds like a lot at a thousand dollars an ounce or 1822 and
[13:59.600 --> 14:08.600]  rising but again it's not that gold is really that valuable we're not in 1995
[14:08.600 --> 14:14.800]  numbers it's that gold is simply more now because the dollar is being devalued
[14:14.800 --> 14:19.360]  and the US government the private banks that have hijacked our government have
[14:19.360 --> 14:24.040]  told the world they're going to devalue that's why I played that clip two or
[14:24.040 --> 14:28.240]  three times last week where Alan Greenspan on meet the presto to use a
[14:28.240 --> 14:36.800]  Gerald Salente term was up there with the Obama White House economic advisor and
[14:36.800 --> 14:42.640]  he shook his head whenever Greenspan the former head of the Fed said we're not
[14:42.640 --> 14:46.440]  going to default we're just going to print money and the host and the gas the
[14:46.440 --> 14:50.320]  other gas went and actually did a double take you could tell they had an
[14:50.320 --> 14:55.960]  adrenaline rush of shock that this was being said openly so they're now going
[14:55.960 --> 15:02.480]  to hide in plain view the fact that they are absolutely robbing every man
[15:02.480 --> 15:07.400]  woman and child in this country it's one thing to know their policies are going
[15:07.400 --> 15:14.040]  to lead to rack and ruin it's another thing to now be sliding in to it and I
[15:14.040 --> 15:17.760]  liken it to the time my father and I were driving out of Fredericksburg
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.720]  visiting family back into Austin and by an outside Stonewall got hit by a
[15:22.720 --> 15:27.600]  tornado tornadoes in the summer late summer just formed out of nowhere we
[15:27.600 --> 15:30.560]  didn't know it was a tornado till the state police got there and we said our
[15:30.560 --> 15:35.240]  truck just got thrown off the road and they said yeah we know did you see the
[15:35.240 --> 15:39.320]  barn blown over right there the and the powers out in town and cars are tumped
[15:39.320 --> 15:43.560]  over you were hit by a tornado look at the path of it right there I was like
[15:43.560 --> 15:47.320]  well I we didn't see it well I didn't you pull over but we didn't know we
[15:47.320 --> 15:53.260]  didn't have news radio on we didn't know a tornado formed but but but as
[15:53.260 --> 15:59.000]  the car got blown off the road and spun down a 40 50 foot ditch it was like five
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.200]  minutes it was only a few seconds but it felt like five minutes I remember
[16:03.200 --> 16:07.000]  saying brace for impact and then we shot through the barbed wire fence at the
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.720]  bottom and luckily as it spun we hit the back of the Tahoe or I guess suburban
[16:12.720 --> 16:18.480]  it was a stretched Tahoe almost a suburban into about three oak trees and
[16:18.480 --> 16:24.160]  it smashed about a third of the truck in broke our seats and my dad got a
[16:24.160 --> 16:30.680]  concussion and started throwing up I was unfazed thank God but you're saying
[16:30.680 --> 16:36.280]  why are you telling the story again that's what it feels like 2008 we feel
[16:36.280 --> 16:44.080]  the truck starts spinning 2009 we're starting to brace ourselves 2010 the
[16:44.080 --> 16:49.000]  truck starts going down the gully started 2011 it goes through the barbed
[16:49.000 --> 16:56.760]  wire fence and 2012 ladies and gentlemen we're gonna hit the oak trees and it is
[16:56.760 --> 17:06.520]  not gonna feel good so I'm just here to tell you right now that this hit in the
[17:06.520 --> 17:14.600]  game and everybody better get their stuff in line you better get our business
[17:14.600 --> 17:19.760]  together and that means all of us I was talking to my wife last night and I
[17:19.760 --> 17:25.720]  said listen we have got to get the hatches batten down we got the water
[17:25.720 --> 17:29.920]  filters we got the firearms we've got the food but I said I want to get more
[17:29.920 --> 17:35.320]  storable food and I said we've got to talk to all of our families even if some
[17:35.320 --> 17:39.880]  of them laugh at us and we've got to tell them to get ready even if some of them
[17:39.880 --> 17:43.720]  don't listen most my family has listened most my family's more awake than I am
[17:43.720 --> 17:49.000]  some of my family really helped wake me up to another level and that's because
[17:49.000 --> 17:55.320]  they live in the real world my mother's brother well out of high school and
[17:55.320 --> 18:00.360]  college worked on oil rigs and then I guess what he volunteered to go to
[18:00.360 --> 18:06.680]  Vietnam and trained up in Dallas Fort Worth there be a helicopter pilot became
[18:06.680 --> 18:12.080]  a helicopter pilot in Vietnam lived then after that in Central America lived in
[18:12.080 --> 18:17.440]  Guatemala and saw the real world and I remember in high school saying I love
[18:17.440 --> 18:22.520]  Rush Limbaugh man he's great and my uncle looked at me and he said he's there
[18:22.520 --> 18:26.640]  to control the conservative movement in America do you know about the new world
[18:26.640 --> 18:31.080]  order and I said yeah I've read none they're called conspiracy and he said
[18:31.080 --> 18:38.000]  yes and and you know it helped expand my own understanding to an even greater
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.320]  level but I do have some family that you try to warn them they don't want to
[18:42.320 --> 18:49.640]  hear it they just want to think everything's fine I went to a resort
[18:49.640 --> 18:54.880]  couple days ago outside Austin because we were invited to a birthday party one
[18:54.880 --> 18:58.920]  of my wife's good friends one of my good friends and their daughters are there
[18:58.920 --> 19:02.840]  they're young daughters so my children went and played with them and while I
[19:02.840 --> 19:12.160]  was at the resort outside Austin and what people watching I saw what you'd
[19:12.160 --> 19:16.640]  call upper middle class type people and the men are all the same they're all
[19:16.640 --> 19:21.440]  sports fanatics they're all into how they look and having the you know coolest

[19:26.920 --> 19:30.280]  but I sat there in the restaurants watching them watch Sports Center and
[19:30.280 --> 19:34.280]  heard all the men only talk about sports because that's what they've been given
[19:34.280 --> 19:39.720]  as a male role model is just being grown-up little boys don't know men are
[19:39.720 --> 19:43.440]  supposed to be informed about the world they're supposed to be politically and
[19:43.440 --> 19:48.760]  civically involved not because we're a bunch of busy bodies but because if
[19:48.760 --> 19:55.360]  you're not politically involved you're going to be usurped by corrupt

[24:23.800 --> 24:30.720]  civilization if men just think that they're going to go to work every day
[24:30.720 --> 24:34.640]  and then go play golf and then come home to their children at seven o'clock at
[24:34.640 --> 24:41.280]  night and watch TV and get up and take your kids to school and then turn them
[24:41.280 --> 24:45.800]  over to the government programming and indoctrination and then go to the
[24:45.800 --> 24:49.680]  sports bar and then come home at eight o'clock and maybe read their child a book
[24:49.680 --> 24:53.760]  and then go to sleep I mean parents on average aren't even spending time with
[24:53.760 --> 24:59.760]  their children I watch people's children in restaurants and almost all of them

[25:10.120 --> 25:15.400]  phone in the car and if a national radio show calls me and I miss it that's the
[25:15.400 --> 25:21.280]  way it is I've got to sometimes stop working even though my work is in direct
[25:21.280 --> 25:25.840]  challenge to the globalist and is solution-based imagine these other
[25:25.840 --> 25:30.280]  people and sure they're fighting for their quote great way of life and to
[25:30.280 --> 25:34.080]  make money but at the end of the day your money's not going to have any value
[25:34.080 --> 25:40.680]  and you're not going to have any economy to work in if we don't get informed as a
[25:40.680 --> 25:45.680]  nation and as a planet to how things really work and stand up against this
[25:45.680 --> 25:51.200]  corrupt system now I'm gonna open the phones up after I cover some of the
[25:51.200 --> 25:56.280]  economic and world news I'm gonna open them up now for police and military
[25:56.280 --> 26:01.800]  current military current police former military I know there's a million private
[26:01.800 --> 26:07.880]  contractors in this country do you really buy into the rebranding that's
[26:07.880 --> 26:10.880]  been going on behind the scenes for years but now is being publicly rolled
[26:10.880 --> 26:16.120]  out because they're getting ready to actually stage the events are you buying
[26:16.120 --> 26:19.960]  into the rebranding that the number one terror threat is returning veterans
[26:19.960 --> 26:25.160]  gun owners conservatives libertarians in the Fedders anti-globalist anti-U.N.
[26:25.160 --> 26:30.040]  people basically anybody that's informed and involved and understand
[26:30.040 --> 26:33.880]  what's happened to this nation in this world and is trying to to save the
[26:33.880 --> 26:39.120]  country I mean do you really buy that and the good news is we've come so far as
[26:39.120 --> 26:43.800]  a society and as a nation here's the cover of the Austin American statesman
[26:43.800 --> 26:50.240]  yesterday and it was the cover of many papers across the country Perry talk of
[26:50.240 --> 26:56.480]  trees and draws ire comments about Fed chief criticized but governor stands by
[26:56.480 --> 27:01.640]  his statement even if Rick Perry is completely plastic and phony the fact
[27:01.640 --> 27:05.280]  that he's coming out and saying treacherous almost treasonous the fact
[27:05.280 --> 27:10.080]  that he's having to identify the real government the government that stays in
[27:10.080 --> 27:14.760]  place as presidents and congressmen and women come and go the fact that we've
[27:14.760 --> 27:18.720]  gotten to that point that Michelle Bachman's talking about abolishing the
[27:18.720 --> 27:22.760]  feds that Rick Perry's talking about it that they're having to try to become
[27:22.760 --> 27:27.960]  Ron Paul just to be popular tells you what we already know from our research
[27:27.960 --> 27:32.480]  but what the mainstream media tries to buffalo the public with and keep from
[27:32.480 --> 27:39.000]  you that an anti-New World Order pro-America pro sovereignty pro free
[27:39.000 --> 27:47.280]  market awakening is the majority now of thinking political people the majority
[27:47.280 --> 27:54.880]  is awake and the final domino to fall is that the majority does not know it's a
[27:54.880 --> 28:08.040]  majority ladies and gentlemen anywhere I go anywhere I travel in the world now I
[28:08.040 --> 28:12.320]  can't walk a hundred feet down a hallway or down a street without people
[28:12.320 --> 28:17.720]  stopping and talking to me they're just as intelligent better-looking probably
[28:17.720 --> 28:22.600]  smarter than I am why aren't you leading a fight against the globalist and it
[28:22.600 --> 28:25.680]  doesn't mean you're gonna save the world by yourself either but why aren't you
[28:25.680 --> 28:30.320]  seeing yourself it's always we're so glad you're there Alex we're so glad
[28:30.320 --> 28:35.680]  you're fighting I sleep better at night knowing you're there I'm here to wake
[28:35.680 --> 28:41.440]  people up and then spur you to be the leaders you are nothing is going to
[28:41.440 --> 28:48.840]  happen until you take action and I look at these men with their young beautiful
[28:48.840 --> 28:54.840]  wives and their healthy happy children and I I talked to them I watch them talk
[28:54.840 --> 28:59.280]  to each other all they talk about a sports all they talk about is
[28:59.280 --> 29:06.280]  entertainment they are not men they are not men they are little boys who never
[29:06.280 --> 29:15.560]  grew up the women behave like tarts who are not guardians of their family but
[29:15.560 --> 29:21.040]  are just little kids out to have a good time listen America has gotten in
[29:21.040 --> 29:25.600]  trouble because because most people don't see it as their role they don't see
[29:25.600 --> 29:32.320]  it as their job they don't see it as something that they do to be politically
[29:32.320 --> 29:38.200]  involved you better get politically involved or become totally enslaved when
[29:38.200 --> 29:43.080]  you're not involved the vacuum is filled by criminals control freaks con men and
[29:43.080 --> 29:48.080]  every form of tyranny you can imagine I want to talk to military police and

[40:08.640 --> 40:14.240]  planet that's what's been called for by the globalist with the United States
[40:14.240 --> 40:20.960]  fighting Russian proxies all over not for America but for the big banks
[40:20.960 --> 40:27.160]  it's unbelievable move to curb Swiss Frank's rise backfires traders shrugged
[40:27.160 --> 40:30.880]  off new measures by Swiss authorities to stem demand for their currency sitting
[40:30.880 --> 40:35.760]  the Swiss Frank sharply higher yesterday and today the Swiss Frank jumped 2%
[40:35.760 --> 40:39.280]  against both the euro and the dollar in a matter of minutes as traders ignored
[40:39.280 --> 40:42.480]  the Swiss National Bank's decision to almost double the amount of liquidity
[40:42.480 --> 40:47.200]  available to the money markets so they try to devalue their currency in the
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.760]  world said no look your your your population has access to grenade
[40:51.760 --> 40:56.760]  launchers you've got machine guns everywhere you've got private property
[40:56.760 --> 41:01.480]  you're not under the globalist parasite control the globalists themselves want
[41:01.480 --> 41:05.880]  to invest in Switzerland they want somewhere not destroyed by them to run to
[41:05.880 --> 41:13.920]  a small little island a little Eden okay I want to get to your phone calls
[41:13.920 --> 41:18.920]  that's just some of the financial news and again when Kaiser joins us we're
[41:18.920 --> 41:25.720]  get to Justin Evan James John Joe you guys here in just a just a moment I
[41:25.720 --> 41:29.480]  don't want to tell you what's coming up with Kaiser do you realize that the
[41:29.480 --> 41:33.280]  government is still paying banks not to lend this is from the business insider
[41:33.280 --> 41:39.520]  it's up in infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and actually link to the
[41:39.520 --> 41:45.200]  Federal Reserve's own website and other news reports where they admit that they
[41:45.200 --> 41:49.800]  pay banks not to lend to you you wonder why you've heard they've given them
[41:49.800 --> 41:53.480]  tens of trillions of bailout money your tax money to get the economy going three
[41:53.480 --> 41:57.240]  years ago and then you can't get a car loan even if you got decent credit you
[41:57.240 --> 42:03.440]  can't get loans I know a lot of people who can't get loans one of my crew it
[42:03.440 --> 42:08.400]  makes decent living a great video editor he's gotten raises over the years I
[42:08.400 --> 42:15.440]  said he was trying to get in a car you know a new used car he wanted a jeep so
[42:15.440 --> 42:18.480]  he could you know go out in the hill country and stuff with a drill friend and
[42:18.480 --> 42:26.160]  he likes to camp at stuff and he I was like six months ago he kept going to Bank
[42:26.160 --> 42:33.360]  of America Goldman Sachs his buddy JP Morgan all those big banks trying to get
[42:33.360 --> 42:39.120]  a loan and he has good credit and he's had a job here for six years and they
[42:39.120 --> 42:48.080]  said no we're not giving you a loan and I said Rob go to a credit union man that's
[42:48.080 --> 42:52.080]  a real bank owned by real people that that's that they're in the business of
[42:52.080 --> 42:57.080]  lending the mega banks are laying off all their all their retail employees most
[42:57.080 --> 43:02.960]  of them they they run America they don't want to loan you a business loan or a
[43:02.960 --> 43:07.280]  car loan he walked right in got a super low rate walked right out got the Jeep
[43:07.280 --> 43:12.520]  a day he said wow how'd you know that because I understand what's going on
[43:12.520 --> 43:21.560]  it's not look the issue here is that they're here to hurt you they want to
[43:21.560 --> 43:25.440]  destroy the economy that's how they conquer it so we'll be going over that
[43:25.440 --> 43:29.920]  also we're gonna look at the child poverty in the US has increased 18% the
[43:29.920 --> 43:33.280]  last nine years that's what government cook numbers again government's doing a
[43:33.280 --> 43:37.360]  great job people say though they're doing a horrible job no the government's not
[43:37.360 --> 43:41.160]  doing a bad job in the drug war either they're making 500 bill a year bringing
[43:41.160 --> 43:46.040]  the drugs in and keeping them illegal to keep the price up so one in five American
[43:46.040 --> 43:50.000]  children now living in poverty according to report this is everything is going
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.320]  according to plan that's how we've been able to predict everything that would
[43:53.320 --> 43:57.440]  happen because the globalists are following a program I mean this is we
[43:57.440 --> 44:01.240]  can tell you what's gonna happen because they all write white papers like
[44:01.240 --> 44:07.480]  you're idiots and they think you won't read what they've written by the way
[44:07.480 --> 44:12.120]  there's a news article about chemicals being put in haircare products to reduce
[44:12.120 --> 44:17.160]  fertility and I thought I would do some research and just pull up some of the
[44:17.160 --> 44:20.200]  older reports on this because it's getting a lot of attention and people
[44:20.200 --> 44:25.680]  saying is it true or isn't it of course it's true this deals with Israel
[44:25.680 --> 44:29.720]  reportedly trying to ship haircare products that sterilize and poison people
[44:29.720 --> 44:34.600]  in Egypt and folks are freaking out about it even Israeli news isn't denying it
[44:34.600 --> 44:37.960]  they're just but the point is it's all the major governments are doing this
[44:37.960 --> 44:45.160]  this is the global policy Israel was paid the equivalent of what four billion
[44:45.160 --> 44:52.680]  US dollars in the 50s and early 60s to radiate 110,000 Jewish children many of
[44:52.680 --> 44:57.440]  them to death so yes if Israel's murdering their own children and brain
[44:57.440 --> 45:00.160]  damaging them they're gonna be doing it to the Arabs next door but again people
[45:00.160 --> 45:04.760]  say oh see Israel's pure evil no the Israeli people aren't evil their
[45:04.760 --> 45:08.360]  government is the Chinese people aren't evil their government is the
[45:08.360 --> 45:12.880]  American people on average aren't evil the government is it's all of them it's
[45:12.880 --> 45:18.200]  all of them of the modern governments that are run by the big mega banks are
[45:18.200 --> 45:25.040]  all doing this in fact I shouldn't even mention that without backing it up LA

[46:12.920 --> 46:20.560]  now now now now I've covered that but oh here it is I'm sorry this is out of
[46:20.560 --> 46:26.440]  Ynet news big Israeli news Mossad plotted to harm Egyptian fertility
[46:26.440 --> 46:37.280]  Egypt's Al Haram daily claims Israel accused spies the Afir Harari accused
[46:37.280 --> 46:41.560]  of spying for Israel devised to sell Egypt haircare products endangering
[46:41.560 --> 46:49.560]  reproductive abilities and then it goes on from there of course well this is
[46:49.560 --> 46:53.200]  being done to everybody this is being done to the Israelis it's being done to
[46:53.200 --> 46:58.840]  everyone you're all under attack okay only the eugenicists and there's
[46:58.840 --> 47:03.640]  probably only 10,000 of a max who really know what's going on Rothkopf says
[47:03.640 --> 47:06.760]  there's 6,000 in the superclass in his book superclass former head of the
[47:06.760 --> 47:12.880]  Kissinger group and this is what it's all about and it matter of your German
[47:12.880 --> 47:17.880]  Jewish Chinese Mexican aboriginal it doesn't matter you're not getting the
[47:17.880 --> 47:23.280]  memo about this we're all under attack by the eugenicists the eugenicists
[47:23.280 --> 47:30.360]  forget all your Muslim Christian clashes Jew Muslim clashes Catholic
[47:30.360 --> 47:35.080]  Protestant clashes all of this is just a diversion ladies and gentlemen the real
[47:35.080 --> 47:39.920]  global religion is eugenics carried out by the elite against everyone but them
[47:39.920 --> 47:45.840]  all right enough said I'm gonna go to Justin Evan James John Joe and others
[47:45.840 --> 47:49.520]  here in a moment and we got Max Kaiser coming about 45 minutes from now but I
[47:49.520 --> 47:54.680]  wanted to bring Ted Anderson up obviously give people another opportunity to get
[47:54.680 --> 48:01.600]  silver and gold and silver and gold gold Ted's here to give us the high today
[48:01.600 --> 48:06.280]  he's been in silver and gold brokering for what 32 years said Midas for 1415
[48:06.280 --> 48:10.400]  years fifth largest gold silver dealer in the country he actually has it on hand
[48:10.400 --> 48:17.160]  unlike most brokers Ted I tell you this is scary how they're devaluing the dollar
[48:17.160 --> 48:22.840]  and the vice president over there in China on his knees today publicly begging
[48:22.840 --> 48:28.040]  the chai comms to continue to buy us treasuries and prop up the dollar for now
[48:28.040 --> 48:32.040]  while they go ahead with the schizophrenic policy themselves of
[48:32.040 --> 48:37.640]  devaluing it where is gold right now Ted well gold had a high today of 1827 80
[48:37.640 --> 48:43.680]  currently trading at 1820 20 up $30 and 20 cents of course like you said the
[48:43.680 --> 48:51.080]  stock market is just tumbling right now silver hit a high of 4102 4071
[48:51.080 --> 48:56.520]  presently I mean there's just I mean the markets are just just gyrating like
[48:56.520 --> 49:02.400]  crazy of course the news from Bloomberg is that Wall Street tumbles on economy
[49:02.400 --> 49:06.200]  bank worries which means that there could be possible bank runs you know I
[49:06.200 --> 49:10.240]  guess if the Fed continues to print money and so there's money to get out in
[49:10.240 --> 49:14.040]  the system that won't happen but the inflation fear is driving people to
[49:14.040 --> 49:18.360]  gold and that isn't going to stop now we've broken through 1820 dollars an
[49:18.360 --> 49:24.360]  ounce we're heading to 1900 dollars very fast it is now you know late August or
[49:24.360 --> 49:28.520]  at least mid to late August and we haven't seen September October November
[49:28.520 --> 49:33.760]  usually October November December is the Super Bowl market for gold going into
[49:33.760 --> 49:37.840]  February but if you look at the 12-year graph it's it's been bull for 11 a half
[49:37.840 --> 49:44.440]  12 years but but Ted expanding on this JP Morgan said they believe gold will
[49:44.440 --> 49:50.600]  hit 2500 or more by end of December so we're talking three four months from

[54:29.800 --> 54:34.120]  protecting our borders we're gonna be breaking that down it's nothing more
[54:34.120 --> 54:38.840]  than an opium war it's a fight with different militant groups like Muhammad
[54:38.840 --> 54:44.000]  Karzai's brother who just got killed a few months ago over who's getting that
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.640]  smack and that 500 billion 500 billion a year in opium comes out of there to the
[54:48.640 --> 54:52.960]  whole world 500 billion total in narcotics shipped into the u.s. cocaine
[54:52.960 --> 54:57.520]  heroin and other nasty things and by keeping them illegal it drives up the
[54:57.520 --> 55:01.160]  price which is the reason they do it but if you just joined us i've asked for
[55:01.160 --> 55:06.600]  military police for military contractors to call in and give us your
[55:06.600 --> 55:10.120]  take i mean now it's public they've rebranded it's not the muslim threat
[55:10.120 --> 55:14.040]  it's now the evil tea party they're terrorists they're about to hit us now
[55:14.040 --> 55:18.800]  how asinine is that the tea party is going to engage in terror a and b how
[55:18.800 --> 55:23.680]  were they hyping it before you know years ago behind the scenes now they're
[55:23.680 --> 55:28.680]  rolling it out public clearly this is all staged and do you agree with me that
[55:28.680 --> 55:34.480]  they're getting ready to start staging false flags here in the country 800 to
[55:34.480 --> 55:41.080]  5 at 992 31 our report that went out yesterday afternoon is on the drudge
[55:41.080 --> 55:44.840]  report drudge report dot com i'm very thankful for drudge recognizing this is
[55:44.840 --> 55:51.080]  important news and getting it up i rarely fire the batman light into the
[55:51.080 --> 55:55.680]  night sky but a few times i have asked drudge to link to something they have so
[55:55.680 --> 55:58.920]  i want to thank the great crew over there at drudge report dot com because
[55:58.920 --> 56:02.920]  it's admitted i already knew this myself just from watching it but the new york
[56:02.920 --> 56:06.480]  times and others have had to admit the drudge report drives more traffic than
[56:06.480 --> 56:12.400]  facebook and youtube combined more than twitter i mean it is the only place in
[56:12.400 --> 56:17.320]  the world that can truly now punch something out and make it a top story
[56:17.320 --> 56:22.880]  and it's just incredible so if you scroll down at drudge report dot com on the
[56:22.880 --> 56:29.640]  right hand side you can see our report big sis latest terrorist more white
[56:29.640 --> 56:35.040]  americans and remind me to get watson on the line i want to write a update
[56:35.040 --> 56:39.600]  article to that and add it as a link to the top of our latest article because
[56:39.600 --> 56:43.280]  it's a great article watson wrote but it doesn't point out it does but it needs
[56:43.280 --> 56:47.520]  to state it if there was any doubt the other promo videos they put out to
[56:47.520 --> 56:52.240]  fair monger we're saying white people are the new terrorist this new one just
[56:52.240 --> 56:56.800]  it just it just continues this is a month after the last controversy i mean
[56:56.800 --> 57:00.560]  this is incredible imagine if you put out a bunch of government videos were only
[57:00.560 --> 57:05.600]  black people were terrorist or only asians i mean this is a big deal but
[57:05.600 --> 57:09.280]  it's now been confirmed that all over the country there are racial attacks
[57:09.280 --> 57:13.840]  against whites happening it's now been confirmed by police by videos by the
[57:13.840 --> 57:18.080]  criminals themselves that well they think it's okay to attack a white person
[57:18.080 --> 57:21.200]  and that's the same thing where a clan person thinks it's okay to attack a
[57:21.200 --> 57:26.320]  black person you know i'd decry that when people attack folks from a
[57:26.320 --> 57:31.840]  bestial tribal gang level but why is it okay when whites are attacked well it's
[57:31.840 --> 57:35.920]  it's okay to say whites are terrorist see i'm sick of it and i'm not putting up
[57:35.920 --> 57:39.520]  with it and this is political correctness of the power of 10 billion
[57:39.520 --> 57:42.640]  all right let's go to uh this is a short segment but i'm gonna come back to
[57:42.640 --> 57:46.800]  everybody justin in california uh no he hadn't been holding the longest i'm

[57:57.440 --> 58:01.600]  because i saw the stock market uh you know crash and it just didn't make
[58:01.600 --> 58:04.480]  sense so i started doing some research and listening to you but i'm a former
[58:04.480 --> 58:07.840]  marine and uh you know i woke up when i watched the
[58:07.840 --> 58:11.840]  obama deception and uh yeah i've got friends in the military a lot of
[58:11.840 --> 58:16.480]  former military friends and for the most part uh we all know and i wake up all
[58:16.480 --> 58:20.800]  my marine friends they don't buy the navy seal going down
[58:20.800 --> 58:24.000]  they don't buy any of it and uh stay there i'm gonna come back to you back in

[58:31.200 --> 58:34.560]  because i got distracted and didn't i have it directly
[58:34.560 --> 58:38.960]  from the father of a navy seal who we've known for years that the seals don't
[58:38.960 --> 58:41.440]  buy it either
[58:41.440 --> 58:50.320]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[58:55.680 --> 58:59.920]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[58:59.920 --> 59:02.880]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[59:02.880 --> 59:06.080]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[59:06.080 --> 59:10.480]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[59:10.480 --> 59:15.360]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[59:15.360 --> 59:19.280]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[59:19.280 --> 59:22.960]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[59:22.960 --> 59:26.240]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[59:26.240 --> 59:30.000]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is
[59:30.000 --> 59:34.080]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and

[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.880]  a terrorist they've already taught us the brown people are terrorists and
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.160]  whites said yeah well it's only for the brown people well now you're learning

[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.800]  there i'm just joking yeah a lot of the military veterans
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.160]  every one of them i know is like forget this this is a joke
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.320]  air force navy marines especially especially the marines
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.760]  and the marines that are still in they're all waking up we're all contacting our
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:51.280]  friends i predicted to andris brevrick i told the uh
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.840]  my friends in the military hey they're gonna stage a white terror attacks over
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.400]  in in europe and then they're gonna start doing in the u.s
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:02.320]  it happened they texted me they're all believing me now and i told you
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:06.720]  the u.s military is waking up and they screwed with the wrong people
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.480]  well and by the way it wasn't harman messed up they've got a new phone system
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.760]  that's all computerized and fancy and i went to james there is a justin
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.200]  you're james in arizona i'm going to justin in california
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.720]  um in a little while so i i apologize for getting that wrong
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.480]  but but but i want to go back to what you just said because that's big
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:31.120]  because uh we laid out their battle plan in their internal memos that leaked and
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.040]  others but they were going to stage attacks i said probably in europe first
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.560]  say that right wingers were doing it so they can continue to destroy europe
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.320]  sovereignty and absorb into the multicultural eu
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.600]  controlled by the bankers who will then play the different groups off against
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.480]  each other as soon as they've got enough foreigners in
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.400]  to be able to checkmate uh the indigenous populations they'll
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:57.200]  they'll shut the borders down it's all part of a balanced divide and conquer
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.560]  you're saying that you warned your military buddies about that
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.440]  then they saw it happen and that really woke them up
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.200]  yes that's correct i i repeated it word for word i said they were going to do
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.800]  right wing attacks in europe and i and i said that they're going to start
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.320]  piping it over here in the u.s and they're seeing a lot of them are minorities a
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.720]  lot of them are like hispanic or whatever and they're all like yeah man
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.680]  this is messed up and they're starting to learn the constitution and they're
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.040]  talking about it amongst their friends and the marines are especially picked
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.840]  off of the don't ask don't tell stuff but that's a personal issue
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.320]  and and really they've they've really messed up they overplayed their hand
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.600]  nobody's buying it anymore a lot of people are even waking up to parry in
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.880]  the right wing and all these bushites running around too so
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.920]  we've done pretty good in waking people up and uh
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.280]  they're starting to see it because i've been just just just bashing the message
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.600]  out there and a lot of former military and i see why the dhs is so afraid of
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.280]  former military because we're trained or smart and guess what was the first one
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.680]  to wake up and we're getting the message out there
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.880]  well that is the thing people join the military because they want to make a
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.120]  difference they want to stand up against evil
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:05.200]  they have that warrior spirit to defend and follow that instinct
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.520]  the problem is then you join a system at the top controlled by the globalist
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.760]  then you wake up to that now you're the threat you're not like these yuppies
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.000]  that just want to act cool all day and uh you know
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.520]  go surfing or play golf and i'm not saying playing golf or surfing is bad
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.440]  i like it as much as the next person the point is that's all they want to do
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.520]  they're not going to stand up and and speak out and they know it's the military
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.200]  type who does have the initiative and is trained to take action
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.640]  and they're scared to death of you god bless you
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.240]  james and arizona good to hear from you all right

[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.280]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.720]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.600]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.120]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.720]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.640]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.240]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:35.280]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.400]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.840]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.880]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my

[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.760]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:15.520]  and the gcn radio network if you miss the last caller
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.880]  in the last few years he told all his marine corps buddies
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.480]  he said you watch they're gonna start staging right wing attacks in europe then
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.240]  it'll come to the united states to blame the team party they're gonna rebrand
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.360]  the war on terror on the constitutionalist
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:34.400]  ron paul supporters and now that it indeed is happening exactly as i said
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.720]  it would he said the military is really waking up and freaking out
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:43.680]  you see it's our power to research history to study the globalist
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:49.520]  it's our capacity to truly grasp reality it's not that hard once you start
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.920]  doing it that's that's what's so scary about this
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.200]  the power of analysis that i have is not hard
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.320]  you've just got to be willing to face reality study history
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:03.920]  and after you've studied this for a few years in depth and learned what's real
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:08.240]  from false and then it becomes just absolutely more and
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.280]  more transparent it's like a pair of binoculars
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.080]  and you're looking at a deer 200 yards away and you put them up
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.720]  to your eyes you got to focus them you got to get them set for the spacing of
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.240]  your eyes and then as you roll the focus
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:27.520]  lever and the zoom lever it comes right into focus you're like wow
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.600]  how did i not see that before you can even see a fly
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.120]  you know sitting on the deer's ear you can see it twitch its ear in the fly
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.040]  fly away a couple nights ago i was watching deer through binoculars
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:44.480]  hence the analogy and it's that simple you just got to bring things into focus
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.160]  and the mainstream media is designed to not bring it into focus
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:52.080]  oh people then say well alex why do you then cover mainstream media
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.280]  well they'll come out and say
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:03.440]  that uh you know stock prices are plunging and they'll give you some
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.440]  false reason for why it's happening but then buried in the article they'll
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.360]  admit also on inflation fears so more and more the
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.800]  the information's there it's just the way they spin it
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:18.080]  there's different types of stuff there's there's outright lies that the media
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.360]  engages in like when they said that ran paul
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:25.600]  wasn't a medical doctor or when they said he kidnapped women
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.520]  those were outright dirty trick lies but then there's
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.880]  other types of deception where they lie by omission where they only tell you
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:37.360]  part of the story or they spin the information that's there
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.400]  and so one of the biggest things that people detract from the show is they
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.520]  say jones says don't trust the mainstream media but he quotes from it all
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:47.200]  day well yeah of course i do i'll take a press release
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.920]  by homeland security at a video where they say hey we're trying to keep you
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:56.080]  safe here's a new psa and we take their own information and say
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:59.600]  look at what this is really saying
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.800]  see it's called discernment it's called analysis we analyze what they're doing
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.560]  so they outright lie they spin they obfuscate
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:13.680]  uh they flip flop but they also sometimes tell the truth
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.800]  especially if it's an issue of little or no significance
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.320]  let's go ahead and take more calls here let's talk to
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.760]  evan in michigan thanks for holding her on the air
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.080]  hi alex i just want to thank you uh and commend you for what you did uh
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:32.960]  versus rush limbaugh that pathetic loser um you know i'm a member in the navy
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.160]  right now and uh i'm actually taking initiative
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:40.320]  uh since i've heard the last caller uh you know educating his
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.000]  fellow marines i'm i'm going to take the same initiative and uh
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.280]  educate my fellow navy uh members around me uh that a lot of them they're
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:53.600]  going to get deployed to arachnid against and this year so so sadly but
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.720]  you know i'm going to tell them that they're not going to turn against their
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.120]  citizens and um you know uh it it is it's
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.360]  wonderful you know to hear that you are a voice of reason in there uh for us for
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.640]  all of us well by the way i'm just one person i'm just a
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.640]  small focal point in the larger fabric that's humanity but the fact that ron
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.960]  paul is the main frontrunner shows how far the movement for liberties come
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:20.720]  the fact that rick perry has to talk about the fellow reserves being treasonous
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.920]  that shows how far we've come uh the fact that in in city after city we get
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.680]  top ratings not just in talk radio but even in music uh or or total listening
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.000]  audience shows that these ideas are popular the
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.200]  fact that ron paul last election and now again this
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.560]  election and we've posted the mainstream articles about this
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:48.480]  has gotten more contributions than all other republicans combined from the
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.800]  military he's gotten more than obama has gotten
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.200]  so that right there is an example that our military is awake
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:03.760]  and that's why homeland security says the number one terror threat is our military
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:08.080]  um yeah it's you know it's true i don't i don't doubt it for a minute you know
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.080]  and i'm one of them that is uh who's been not donating for ron paul's
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.200]  campaign since 2007 i'm even taking it to further
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:19.360]  level i'm educating all my members about ron paul and they keep asking me who's
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.600]  ron paul i said ron paul is is a constitutionalist he's been running
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.600]  uh for presidency a long time he's the most consistent
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:32.400]  uh american who's been spreading the message of of uh liberty piece
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.720]  and found money well he's not even he's not even the most consistent
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:42.640]  he is the most consistent because he's 100 consistent if somebody else was
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.560]  100 consistent and i didn't even totally agree with their
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.960]  policies but overall they were good i would vote for them
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:57.040]  it's ridiculous how good he is it's ridiculous how accurate he's been
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:01.760]  how informed he is how dedicated how stoic how focused
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:08.480]  how incredibly energetic he is it is a joke it is so archetypal that he's the
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:11.440]  man of the hour right as america is faced with total
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:15.040]  global government total police state total implosion
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.760]  we have a chance to elect him i mean again that's how the universe works
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.400]  for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.080]  and and this is our chance god bless you i appreciate your call
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:30.320]  uh avon uh now now now i'm asking people out there
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:34.400]  i'm asking listeners out there military former police current police former
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.280]  military what do you think of the rebranding
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.600]  that the terrorists aren't al-qaeda anymore it's that veteran it's that gun
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.880]  owner it's that farmer it's that ron paul supporter
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:50.720]  it's that white person whites are the new al-qaeda and i told you this was coming
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.520]  i saw it in the internal memos years ago that were leaked to us
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.960]  now they're going public because they're getting ready to start
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.880]  the provocateur events and the purely staged events
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.080]  they're going to find mentally ill ex-prisoner white people
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.280]  that they're going to recruit in and lead to try to get them to blow up a
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.240]  school bus or something or bomb a federal building
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.680]  they and if they can find idiots they'll do it that way
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:18.160]  that'll be fbi right always is but if they have to they're going to call in
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.920]  contractors who just do it on their own then they'll just drug up somebody
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:25.360]  some ex-con or something there's a ron paul supporter
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:31.440]  it's coming it's coming okay i mean just to keep ran from becoming senator
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.880]  they said he was kidnapping women okay and then he wasn't a medical doctor
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.880]  okay it was all lies they're now announcing they're going to play the
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:45.120]  race car on ron paul politico is with the same bull
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.440]  about the dozens and dozens of newsletters that he lent his name to
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:53.760]  pre-popularity of the internet and i and i noticed
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.520]  the publications in the last election never quoted him
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:02.640]  they would just say these newsletters are full of racism and homophobia
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.000]  and then they would actually went and found the newsletters and it would be
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.560]  stuff like blacks have become dependent to the
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:12.400]  welfare state this is terrible it's destroyed their communities
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:16.720]  how is that racist everybody's becoming dependent
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:22.240]  or homosexuals are trying to recruit in the schools
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:26.480]  that's homophobic i mean it don't recruit sexually period in the schools
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.680]  and it was other writers too it wasn't even i mean the point is
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:33.520]  they're now going to that attack pattern but if you notice the politico
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.200]  article and i shot a video about this yesterday headlined media plays
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:43.280]  race card against ron paul it just says this publication says ron paul
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:46.480]  did this and then you go to that publication
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.240]  they have no quotes they have nothing they just tell you
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.160]  he's not a doctor he hurts little kittens uh
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:57.680]  oh they're scared folks they're scared which is all the evidence you need to
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:01.200]  how good he is uh john and pa the father of military
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.040]  son he's got his view on the government saying that the military is the number
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.880]  one terror threat in the new al-qaeda uh go ahead john
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.840]  this is great um first of all i wanted to tell you that
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:15.440]  my son there's an ia in iraq right now he runs the
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:19.360]  phallus gun and she's found the incoming but what i wanted to tell you about was
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.280]  a conversation he had with his chief petty officer on a way to the gym
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.880]  you never heard two guys talking about the promise keepers
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.640]  and the next thing you know there's five or six sailors on that ship
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:34.320]  all talking about how they were supported the promise keepers or they
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.320]  remember other promise keepers and he didn't even
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.160]  try to solicit that he was just on his way to the gym and he hurt these guys he
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.760]  started talking to them the half of that ship is completely awake
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.280]  you know they they want to support the constitution
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.080]  absolutely now they're the promise keepers you know that promise to be good
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.440]  christian men and that's great and not be world but there's also the oath

[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.400]  so when they had all the classes he used to drag up five and six guys at a time
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.640]  we don't know about them all of them had these great positive attitudes i
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:46.800]  now uh my son's awake and i show a lot of the guys come up here in game and
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.400]  uh friend of the fascism all these all these movies and you know what the
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.800]  half of them said let it happen we're going to fight and we're
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.120]  going to win they can't wait for the globalists to make their move
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.600]  they can't wait these guys are positive and they're
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.120]  people that like you said they're people that do things
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:11.920]  they're uh active you know they didn't sign up to protect our country
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:16.240]  just to sit around and draw a check and and that's what some of the globalists
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:19.040]  that they're depending on these guys that turn on us
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:24.400]  they're greatly mistaken well absolutely i appreciate your call and say

[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:30.480]  to the republic you know if you look at the general enlisted
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:33.920]  oh if they do swear to the constitution and the president
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:38.720]  but if you look at the officers it's to the constitution
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.960]  and that's why officers are commissioned by congress
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.880]  because our founders didn't trust the president to be in command
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.920]  of the military purely the congress directs the president
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:56.000]  who the enemy is he then prosecutes as the commander in chief
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.720]  but the officers and the separation of power congress has commissioned them

[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:34.000]  well i i think that the closer they get uh i'm obviously the people are gonna be
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.360]  waking up uh faster and faster and uh it drives them to make our take desperate
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.360]  measures you know so uh the things are gonna become more irrational
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.240]  things that they say now are going to become more rational
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:50.240]  and uh people just need to open up uh their eyes and see how things
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:54.240]  change so quickly that uh maybe a year ago they nobody would even mention that
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:57.840]  on tv and now they're the same things that are just don't make sense
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.040]  you know it's simple exactly they're the terrorist
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.920]  they know we're on to them and they're gonna now say we're the terrorist and
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.280]  they're also gonna then poses us as well they're gonna hit us from every angle
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:10.480]  and come out and talk about about the new world order and talk about about the
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:14.160]  fellow reserve like newt genrich and rick perrier doing right now but their
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:18.640]  history shows they've always served it they're so desperate because of ron
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.400]  paul they're trying to become him uh let's go i'm gonna bring that up to max
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:25.520]  keiser too not just on the economy i'm gonna get his take on the the awakening
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:30.480]  that's happening thank you so much sir uh let's talk to uh
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:36.480]  that retired police officer jake in chicago then we'll get to uh barak
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.440]  justin joe and others uh go ahead uh jake you're on the year
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:45.520]  alex thank you for taking my call i appreciate it i used to be
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:49.120]  a police officer with the the sheriff's office
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.920]  in chicago and i can tell you and i left there
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:58.720]  several years back i'm now a doctor of metaphysics which is a complete different
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:04.240]  deal but the interesting thing is when i was doing police work
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:08.800]  we handled people in a completely different fashion
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:15.200]  and we were always told to be mindful of the way that we dealt with
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:19.600]  minority people so that it could never be construed
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.400]  that we were doing anything that would be considered prejudicial
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:31.920]  and to see this swing completely like blows my mind and i
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.000]  i started taking notice wherever i go i noticed that almost
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.600]  every police department in the chicago saw verbs and whatnot they're dressing
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:46.320]  like military now they don't dress like cops because you used to have to have
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.720]  an inspection oppressed uniform so that you put on
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:54.640]  a nice image so that when you went out into the public yeah the old-fashioned
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:59.600]  peace officer instead they look like mexican paramilitary police
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:03.760]  exactly and and when i started seeing that i'm like everybody's wearing combat
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:07.040]  boots nobody wears a tie anymore they wear the
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:12.560]  little like dicky type thing underneath the shirt like on hill street blues
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:17.680]  and i'm like this is going military and there's battering rams on the cars
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:21.680]  and i'm like we never had battering rams on the car if we had to kick in a
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:25.200]  door we did it the old way we kicked in a door
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:29.120]  so it's become a completely different world
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:33.520]  and something that i saw this morning literally scared the hell out of me
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:36.720]  stay there i'm gonna have you finish up we're getting max keiser on the line
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:39.840]  but i want you to be able to finish up and you can comment on what you say

[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.560]  jake you were uh bringing up things that you're really concerned about the
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:16.480]  militarization of police the gunishness of all of it and you said you saw
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.320]  something on the news that really concerns you go ahead
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:24.240]  yeah i get a call this morning somebody says dr jake i sent you a link check it
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.200]  out and i go i'm there and i see this thing where
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:30.080]  obama is telling i believe the guy's name is
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:35.520]  aside telling him to step aside and i thought
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:40.240]  who in the hell is he to tell somebody else to step aside
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:45.040]  and that just blew my mind that the the gall of the way things
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:49.040]  are going the way these people are acting towards other world leaders telling
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:53.200]  them to get out of the way could you imagine if somebody from china
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:57.280]  told us hey stop doing this or that we'd say
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:00.960]  mind your own business forget about it we'd go about our lives right
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:08.560]  yes and i and i i see that the government is rapidly becoming
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:15.120]  more militarized in its function as opposed to being more
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:19.920]  administrative it is becoming more about military operation
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:24.160]  and like i said earlier when i see these local police departments with
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:28.960]  battering rams guys in combat boots think about if
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:33.120]  a woman called and said i hear strange noises behind my house
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:36.720]  could you please send a car they send guys over there that
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.880]  look like a military guys that would scare the hell out of children
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:45.040]  and that's all part of conditioning the public they've had police chiefs admit
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:48.560]  that the black uniforms the mask it's meant to scare the public
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:52.080]  they don't want police and the public being friends anymore
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:55.920]  they want police to be revenue generators and enforcers
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:59.280]  just like they are in mexico remember going to mexico 25 years ago and the
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:02.240]  cops were dressed there like they're dressed here now
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:06.720]  same thing in north korea it's all about intimidation god bless you my friend
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:12.480]  look we are going into a total depression designed by the mega banks
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:19.360]  to institute a financial dictatorship and in the case of Assad
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:22.720]  it is admitted that nato the united states and israel
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:26.800]  have been shipping arms across the border to
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:31.040]  radical muslim groups because he's got a secular government
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:34.640]  to overthrow them just like they just helped overthrow
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:37.760]  mubarak the old dictator and are putting in the muslim brotherhood
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:41.520]  only so they can have another war with the
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:47.200]  sheites and others in a couple years the globalists are that cold blooded
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:50.960]  and i'm not saying Assad's a good guy but but but yes
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.840]  that's why they put obama in and gave him a peace price
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:58.160]  what some people say well he's the man of peace this is not a war in libya it is
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:01.200]  peace you know i was reading i keep saying four months
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:06.320]  the ap was reporting there's been a war in libya now for six months
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:10.640]  remember obama war in libya to last in fact guys pull this up
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:16.080]  obama headline conflict to last days or obama nato involvement to last days not
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.040]  weeks that involvement's four and a half months
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:22.560]  been going on for a couple months before that six months
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:26.000]  they're blowing up their power plants their water
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.960]  production they're laying siege they're they're killing civilians everywhere
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:35.120]  because he has been building up africa and trying to create their own banking
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:38.800]  system that is not the serbs tried to do that
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:42.640]  not allowed who'd they use to take out the serbs al qaeda
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:46.080]  muslim extremist did they use to attack the russians al qaeda

[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:39.040]  their via via phone max i want to cover the
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:42.240]  waterfront with you today i thought that was a really informative
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:45.440]  interview we did last week with an info wars
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:50.400]  a nightly news report well really the precursor to that starting
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:54.160]  september first it was a info wars special report
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:59.040]  but i want to go over so much of what we see happening in the stock market
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.240]  gold and silver exploding where we are i mean i know you've
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:05.200]  predicted that we would continue to go into a depression
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.480]  that you predicted that the euro would continue to collapse and that they would
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:12.640]  call for a superhero a quote financial european union
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:16.080]  where we're now the bankers through france and germany are going to be given
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:19.920]  total control over every facet of the nation state
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:23.520]  same thing happening here the global banker occupation
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:30.400]  is accelerating and again i know i have you here talking about
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.880]  basically more of the same but things are moving so much quicker
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.960]  now we're getting a clear image of exactly uh what their plan is we're
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:41.280]  seeing newspaper headlines every day in the us
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:44.720]  casinos are the answer just like nafta and gatt were the answer
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:49.760]  the casino gulag economy you talked about virtual currencies and video game
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:54.640]  uh systems that's now we're being told our new economy
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:59.680]  i mean this is literally something like out of a nightmare science fiction
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:04.800]  movie max yeah i agree i agree i think the um
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.200]  the the interesting thing to look at today would be the french
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:14.880]  banks okay as the continuation of the story that you just told
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:18.640]  today the french banks are collapsing and in particular
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:25.920]  society general and the society society general is basically the bank
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:29.600]  that got the huge bailout during the 2008 period
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:35.440]  it is also where all of the derivatives that were on the books of aig
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:41.200]  were moved so when aig was bailed out and visa v these french banks were
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:46.000]  bailed out uh the bulk of the six hundred trillion
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.120]  dollars in derivatives and this is a number that the
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.040]  bank of international settlements just confirmed this week there are over six
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:56.800]  hundred trillion dollars in derivatives floating around in the banking system
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:59.760]  and derivatives is just a fancy word for debt
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:04.960]  most of that debt now sits on the books of society general in france
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:09.840]  and that bank had a market cap of 150 160 billion
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:14.000]  it's now down to 16 billion and the rumor here in france
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.760]  is that they're going to go bankrupt and that they will need another
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:21.680]  massive state bailout and this will let me stop you max because we don't have
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.200]  the crew to go pull all this up but you've predicted this
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:31.680]  bob Chapman wevster tarply dr paul craig roberts i mean years ago you guys
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:35.280]  said there's going to after the first round of bailouts in the u.s and europe
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:38.240]  there's going to be more and more bailouts these aren't really bailouts
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:42.560]  this is a debt derivatives black hole that we don't know that we can't pay back
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:46.480]  after each raping of the population and each new austerity move
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.920]  they will just simply move from ireland to greece
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:56.640]  to spain to italy to portugal later to france england and then germany last
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:59.920]  but instead i mean you've been absolutely right it's hopping directly to
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:03.680]  france so so so we've known that they were always going to
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:09.200]  quote bankrupt them but but am i correct in saying that it's accelerating
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.120]  it is accelerating because the hope was that at some point
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:17.520]  that the economy would grow and that there would be enough growth
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.080]  to to grow their way out of this problem but unfortunately
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:26.640]  there's been a collapse in the economy the unemployment keeps going higher
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:30.640]  and there is no growth growth is going in reverse and in countries like the
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:34.480]  uk where they are in the process of rolling out austerity measures
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:39.840]  there's increasing stagnation and the population is in revolt and the
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.200]  population is in revolt in countries around the world and happens or
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.640]  elsewhere and so that's not adding to any growth
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:51.280]  so the ability to hide the debt is becoming impossible now
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:55.360]  for 25 years it was easy to hide the debt because
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:59.120]  it was in the context of a 25-year bull market
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:04.720]  in bond which means that interest rates for 25 years since ragan took office
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:08.080]  were going down and so every time new debt was
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:12.080]  due to be paid you could simply roll it over and add
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:15.760]  to the debt pile without actually paying it off because
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:20.960]  interest rates kept going lower so this was in effect kicking the can down the
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:24.160]  road but now you've got a situation where you've
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:28.800]  got global debt saturation where it's impossible to hide
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:33.040]  the dirty laundry and so now these banks are blowing up
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:36.560]  and they're pulling up all of these unbelievably
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:42.960]  irregular illegal banking and regulatory tricks to hide debt if you go
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:47.520]  back to the collapse of leman brothers if you do a google search for repo 105
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:51.200]  for example leman brothers were it was caught
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:56.560]  putting their debts onto a shadow bank a few days before they had to report
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:00.480]  their earnings to the sec and then taking those debts back a few days later
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.160]  to avoid having to report the debt the same thing that nron was doing
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:09.280]  well listen i want to go over that max but but here's the 64 million dollar or
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:14.080]  i should should say 64 trillion dollar question
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:17.840]  that we've been talking about we cover an obama deception fall the republic that
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:21.200]  that you appear in and again predict all of this in
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:27.440]  now out for almost two years they've created 1.5 quadrillion conservatively
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:31.360]  in fake derivatives they've they've gotten our our pension funds our stock
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:35.920]  markets tied up in them and then the the very criminals that engineered this
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:39.680]  ponzi fraud are up there saying they're too big to fail and our
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:42.880]  entire world economy has to be fed into them
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:45.760]  and the more we give them the worst things get
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:50.960]  and so how do we bring the criminals to justice i mean is there a point
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:54.000]  that it's coming to or is there police state they've put in
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.680]  going to protect them and if we can't bring them to justice through some
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:03.200]  avenue and i want to hear your ideas on that then where are they going to lead us
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:08.240]  well the what the politicians are doing to try to
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:12.000]  avert this catastrophe and we just heard it from Ben Bernanke you want to keep
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.680]  interest rates at zero for another two years
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:21.360]  or indefinitely and so that's a catastrophe because it's a zero percent
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:25.280]  interest rates that created the securitization of the ponzi scheme
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:28.400]  to begin with to get to your point from the earlier segment
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:31.120]  this is what Ron Paul has been pointing out for years
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:34.400]  suddenly people understand this and now you've got a Rick Perry
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:38.640]  jumping on that bandwagon trying to capitalize on what Ron Paul has put
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:44.240]  10 years into educating the public about but those zero percent interest rates
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:47.760]  are the root cause of the problem because that's how you create and
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:51.680]  securitize this debt in ways where you can move it from
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:55.440]  one balance sheet on a bank in new york to a french
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:58.960]  bank and never have it go away and so
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:03.200]  remember that the biggest single player in the global derivatives market with
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:08.240]  90 trillion dollars stated on their book of derivatives
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:13.440]  is JP Morgan they are the counter party to all of this debt to all of these
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:16.480]  banks well that was my next issue it's the mega banks
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:20.000]  that are completely zombie and have hundreds of times the debt that
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.640]  governments have we're talking about the us being insolvent
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:26.720]  over 14 trillion five uh and then meanwhile
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:30.320]  we're talking about hundreds of trillions inside of these individual
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:34.560]  banks and they're lecturing us max that's it's insane
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:39.360]  right JP Morgan is effectively an appendage of the federal reserve bank
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:42.480]  and they put all of these debts these global debt
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:46.000]  they wash them through their balance sheet and then put them on the
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.920]  books of the Fed and then the Fed puts them on the books the BIS
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:54.160]  and in the switzerland and then the BIS ends up putting them on the books
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:57.680]  of countries like Greece and France and these other countries and then the
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:00.880]  government end up saying we need to impose austerity
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:04.640]  measures to pay for this debt but the fact is that people who are
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:08.560]  suffering the austerity measures were never responsible for incurring these
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:11.840]  debts now they're beginning to figure it out and that's why they're writing
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:15.360]  because they're being asked to pay debt that they have nothing to do to incur
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:17.760]  and they didn't get the fees when the debts were created
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.920]  they're not collecting all of the bonus money and the salary bonuses to
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:25.040]  make the debt to begin with they're just getting screwed
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:28.880]  and the wealth and income gap you know that the spread between the top and the
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:31.440]  bottom has never been wider not even during the
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:34.640]  robber baron period did you see such an extreme wealth and
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:37.680]  income gap and that's what's driving a lot of the unrest
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:41.200]  is that the top one tenth of one percent was controlled
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:45.920]  an enormous percentage of the overall wealth so that people are responding as
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:49.520]  you would predictably expect they would respond they are revolting
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:52.960]  now you asked me what can be done about it
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:57.760]  obviously the policy makers are in the pockets of the banks then you've got a
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:03.520]  guy like Ron Paul who for several years was not even talked about on mainstream
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:06.960]  media now his message is so painfully obvious
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:12.240]  that he's got folks like John Stewart who has a wildly popular daily show
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:17.360]  come out and point out the inconsistency this guy's being ignored why
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:20.400]  and so now it's bubbling over and now you've got
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:24.400]  the gloves have come off now Rick Perry to raise the bar is calling
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:29.200]  Ben Bernanke a tyrant and and and things are hopping off jumping off things
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:32.640]  are getting heated and you know the system's so scared they're now trying
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:36.080]  to co-opt it with a guy they know is totally bought and paid for
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:40.880]  uh totally plastic like Rick Perry he's now why it's treacherous you know they're
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:45.680]  treason but it's all talk that's how scared they are of Ron Paul
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:48.640]  which again Ron Paul is a manifestation of the fact that
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:52.720]  his popularity signifies that people are really starting to wake up so i want
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:56.560]  to talk to you max about what's going to happen if we don't beat these bankers
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:01.040]  and and and and how you think we can beat them stay with us

[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:48.000]  it's 800-259-9231-800-259-9231 i'm alex jones of
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.880]  course within full wars dot com so max we're here
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:56.480]  we've we've broken it down historically what the banking cartels
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:00.160]  done they bought the world through fraudulent derivatives
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:03.680]  now they're telling us that there are masters because
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:07.760]  they bought off our politicians and they signed us on to their debts
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:10.880]  i mean it's completely asinine their only hope
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:15.200]  is to somehow sell us uh on that we're guilty and we owe it and so now i'm
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:20.160]  seeing the talking point uh floated that anybody who's
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:23.440]  against the federal reserve anybody that wants to audit the fed anybody who
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:27.280]  supports ron paul they're the new terror threat
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:30.880]  and biden is saying they're gonna hit us so it's pretty clear they're getting
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:34.160]  ready for a false flag to be blamed on the people
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:37.360]  uh maybe an attack against the federal reserve or something and then the stock
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:42.400]  market drops 2000 points and they say oh billy bob johnson of the tea party
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:45.440]  did it he's the reason we had a depression i mean
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:48.880]  they're looking for something like that while at the other angle that you
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:52.560]  mentioned they've got rick perry coming in trying to co-opt
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:58.160]  and saying why absolutely ron paul says get rid of the fed i say arrest him of
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:03.120]  course that's all talk but this shows how far the awakening process the
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:06.560]  education process has gone i mean is this not an incredibly
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:09.680]  positive sign that people are actually talking about
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:13.360]  the real problem now uh the banker occupation
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:18.000]  yeah and on the global level it's resonating on the central bank level
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.600]  and it's resonating in venezuela because they now want
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:24.880]  99 tons of gold that's stored for them in london
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:29.760]  delivered to them the physical stuff and here's the great thing about that
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:35.680]  is that the bank of england really outsources that the jp morgan and jp
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:40.080]  morgan doesn't have it so they have to go into the open market to buy it
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:46.000]  so venezuela is doing these gold what that you know what we were hoping to do
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.760]  with jp morgan by buying silver but they're they're doing it with gold
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:54.240]  they're saying we want all of our gold that the the fact is that the big banks
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:57.760]  like jp morgan have sold gold that they don't have and they have to go into the
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:02.720]  open market to buy the gold and that's one reason why gold is now getting
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:07.120]  almost to the point of being in a parabolic upward trajectory
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:11.280]  where it'll go from 2000 you know quite a bit higher
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:15.680]  rather quickly because all these banks that have sold gold that they don't own
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:19.600]  are being forced to buy in the open market and and we have all the players
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.960]  know that there's a force to buy her then they
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:26.560]  jump in and they get in front of that front train and it's self-feeding and
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:29.520]  it becomes what's called parabolic and you have an enormous move
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:32.240]  that's the drum you've been meeting for several years that they're all in
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:36.080]  their naked shorting silver and gold and if you take physical possession
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:39.680]  that will short circuit them do you think chavez is grabbing their gold
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:42.480]  because he knows that there could be a military move against him
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:47.680]  and a confiscation of it like qaddafi or is he doing it to call their bluff
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:51.200]  he wants the gold because he realizes that the paper money
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:55.520]  era is finished and he's also nationalizing all the gold mines
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:58.960]  in venezuela and he wants the physical stuff delivered
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:02.480]  and this is what's happening around the world central banks for the first time
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:06.080]  in 30 years are buying gold it's remarkable
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:10.080]  that back in the 2000-2001 period
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:14.080]  gordon brown who was the exchequer of the exchange in london at that time
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:19.680]  actually sold half of britain's gold he sold 300 tons in the open market at
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:23.840]  what is the amount that 240 dollars announced the
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:27.680]  historic low for the uh you know post war period
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:33.520]  and he just basically got rid of half of britain's gold at the lowest price
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:36.800]  imaginable and now he looks like a complete idiot
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:42.320]  max stay there back in one minute

[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:48.400]  joining us to get into a lot of the areas he's allowed to talk about dealing
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:51.760]  with secret space program with that big
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:57.120]  hypersonic aircraft that they launched into orbit last week a new space plane
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:01.200]  want to be breaking that down max i want to get into the big enchilada here
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:03.920]  though so you've accurately diagrammed what's
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:07.680]  happened so far and we're talking about
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:12.320]  france in germany going into a big crisis this is the final move
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:15.600]  to hold those countries hostage to the private banking cartel
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:19.840]  and set up a private financial e eu union
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:23.280]  which is the the the genesis of the bank of the world
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:26.800]  that you talked about that the bankers will sell as the solution
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:30.000]  you talked about that on one of our info wars dot com
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:37.360]  uh special news reports last week and so here it is
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:42.320]  and the daily mail even reuters and others did call it a super euro
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:46.560]  financial consolidation where the finance ministers themselves bought and
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:51.120]  paid for by the banksters become the dictators of europe
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:55.760]  continue breaking that down for us well i mean am i allowed to
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:01.280]  use the phrase forthright because last year in november of 2010
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:05.600]  i did a special report on rt and i outlined
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:09.920]  that the collapse of the european banking system was setting up a situation
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:13.200]  where you would speak a european bond market or a
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:17.520]  coordination of all the european banks and that it would all be run out of
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:21.920]  berlin and this is a forthright and now the mail
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:25.840]  article you just quoted the headline of that article is
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:30.240]  welcome to the forthright because this is what's happening now
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:34.160]  it was the success after three times the failure
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:37.760]  of by germany to control all of europe because
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:41.280]  the entire system is going to be to win win
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:44.880]  win do it your bank and a society general
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:48.640]  go bankrupt this week or next week the solution
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.800]  will be to bring in euro bond to roll that debt
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:56.160]  up that i've been saying now for years to a new
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.840]  euro bond it plays into the new world order
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:04.080]  kind of thinking but it's a step before you have the new world order
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:07.920]  you'll have the the european new european order
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:11.840]  which will be run out of berlin and so all that debt will be rolled up into a
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:14.320]  new euro bond and that'll be restructured and
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:18.560]  re-securitized and the banks will make another huge round of huge fees
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:22.160]  and then it'll be turned into 30 40 50 year debt
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:25.120]  and the interest rate will be low of course and the
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:30.000]  gcb and the deutsch and the bundesbank the old german central bank this will
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.680]  be the new european wide central bank and they will
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:37.840]  effectively have this european wide government that was not elected
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:41.360]  that they put together themselves that'll be running europe
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:44.320]  and you'll get you've got one step removed then
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:47.520]  from the same thing happening in north america and asia as we head
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:51.280]  towards the new world order as you put it but this is that
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:54.480]  the penultimate step toward new world order
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:58.320]  it happened this week with france and germany agreeing or talking about
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:02.000]  having a dual governance system and combining their economies
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.960]  in a way that's completely outside of any election
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:09.120]  or referendum by any of the underlying citizens and again by penultimate
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:12.960]  next to the paramount show the next level in fact we say that in obama
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:16.080]  deception and for all the republic we describe
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:19.200]  how they would create global crises and currencies
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:23.440]  implode each region set up banking dictatorships over those
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:25.920]  which will then merge into the bank of the world
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:29.600]  which financial times time magazine newsweek
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:33.280]  are all pushing as a solution hey you know those big secretive bankers that
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:37.280]  did all this they've got a solution they're gonna rule everything now
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:40.400]  doesn't that sound great we're gonna come back and continue with
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:44.800]  with where this will lead on the other side with max keiser
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:47.680]  and then we're going to take some of your phone calls on the other side but
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:51.920]  yes there's the daily mail headline welcome to the fourth rike and it's

[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:29.120]  all right if you just joined us max keiser and i'm
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:32.720]  breaking down the heart of the matter then we're going to your phone calls
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:38.480]  there's the daily mail i saw just scores of other newspapers in europe and the
[02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:43.280]  united states with the same headline rise of the fourth rike how germany is
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:47.920]  using a financial crisis to conquer europe but more than that
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:52.000]  germany is the biggest contributor to the quote bailouts
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.440]  which are really consolidations and there's been many founders of the eu
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:58.640]  that have bragged we've quoted them in our films saying
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:02.800]  the euro was set up by the banking cartels to bring countries into
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:07.120]  receivership so to say that germany itself is leading this new rike
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:11.280]  i don't really agree with that or france either the big mega banks
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:14.320]  are using the power of those countries economics
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:18.080]  to dominate the others while transferring the power as was reported
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:21.680]  yesterday to a new super economic order you can
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:25.520]  affect search that term for folks a new super economic order
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:30.320]  where the finance ministers all revolving door employees of
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:34.880]  the big mega banks literally run the countries that's why they're saying now
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:38.960]  in greece and other areas their countries their people don't run anything
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:42.960]  their parliaments run nothing like a third world country
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:46.240]  that signed on to the imf or world bank but again
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:50.240]  most of this debt is not owed by the people depending on the estimates i've
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:54.560]  seen on average it's above 90 percent is actually derivatives
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:10:00.160]  that are fraudulent uh what is the path here max kaiser a
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:04.560]  where will the establishment that the global banking occupation as you dub it
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:07.440]  what is their goal what are they going to try to do
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:12.080]  versus what should we do uh to counter them
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:15.920]  well just to follow up on what we were saying in terms of the uh this new euro
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:20.160]  bond and global euro universal euro bank
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:24.400]  another part of the urgency to this is what's happening in the swiss franc
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:28.000]  because the swiss franc is running away you know in value against the dollar
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:31.600]  in the euro it's up 40 50 percent and this is not helping
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:34.960]  Switzerland it's hurting their export market so as soon as
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:38.720]  they get this new euro bond off the ground i
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:42.880]  making this prediction you will see a peg of the swiss franc
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:46.960]  to this new euro global this new euro bond
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:52.560]  banking you know this new uh speak up for me max
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:57.120]  yeah one that's okay you'll see a peg to the to the from the swiss franc to this
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:00.480]  new there's an urgency to it because the swiss franc is running
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:04.160]  completely out of control on the upside and it's hurting the swiss
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:07.920]  you know the economy well that was my next point they tried to devalue it as
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:10.960]  you know yesterday and that made investors only russian
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:16.560]  more and greedily buy it yeah they also have a short selling of bank stocks in
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:21.360]  europe and that did not stop the collapse today that's very very telling
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:26.080]  it shows that the the the speculative frenzy to go after these banks and
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:30.960]  their inherent weakness is is is is enormous and that's why now the talk
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:34.320]  is that a french bank will go bankrupt and it will
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:38.320]  require now a huge global response now max this
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:42.080]  sounds like a snake eating itself because a lot of these big mega banks
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:44.880]  i mean this is the core of the globalist system
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:48.000]  and yes they're using the crisis to get even more power
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:54.240]  but their own their own structure is being destroyed in the process have they
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:57.200]  bitten off more than they can chew were they
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:00.960]  irrationally exuberant themselves did they become
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:05.200]  uh delusional uh did they get delusions of grandeur
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:09.760]  could this be the end of these people well they're killing off the competition
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:14.160]  so for example on wall street now you got rid of bear sterns you got rid of
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:17.280]  Lehman brothers you got rid of all the competition
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:20.720]  so when they set up these big deals like when they take facebook public or
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:23.920]  group on public which incidentally has been exposed to the massive policies
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:28.080]  game only one or two banks get that deal only one or two banks are trading on
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:31.280]  the inside stock transactions so this is all about
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:35.360]  consolidation toward just having a few global players
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:38.640]  and they're getting rid of the competition this is extremely anti
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:40.880]  competitive that's the worst element of this
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:44.240]  at all at all and that's the point that a leader like
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:48.000]  in the u.s should be making first and foremost and essentially this is
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.120]  anti-competitive the bailouts create uh too big to fail which is the very
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:56.800]  definition of anti competition so that's their goal which is too big to get
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:59.360]  in trouble so so you concur with my analysis
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:03.840]  this has all been designed to consolidate things down to just a handful of
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:09.040]  mega banks and a few families and in the aftermath it'll destroy the economy
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:12.800]  how do we beat these people just continue to point out the fraud
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:15.680]  point out the ponzi scheme i mean i have an article here
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:20.320]  in the austin american statesman today with a little 75 million dollar
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:24.880]  ponzi scheme former triton ceo guilty in fraud case
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:28.480]  and he did stuff here they break down that's a mild
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:32.240]  compared to what uh jp morgan goldman sacks is doing
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:35.600]  i mean i mean that's what made off was right when he said look the whole stock
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:38.720]  markets of ponzi scheme i mean at the end of the day this
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:43.040]  kurt barton here in austin and uh bernie made off
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:46.640]  are only trying to do what the big boys are doing
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:52.320]  yeah absolutely and um they are trying to get down to the two or three
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:56.240]  only the biggest players but you'd expect them to do that that's what you
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.000]  expect happens in an economy and but that's why you need
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.840]  regulation because even adam smith talked about this
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:07.600]  in wealth of nations in 1776 that book was published
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:11.200]  and he said you know the animal spirits well that's the you know or the
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:14.640]  competitive spirits are a need to be constantly and
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:17.840]  vigilantly monitored because as he put it if you took
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:23.280]  if you put two businessmen in a bar they will collude
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:27.520]  that's their nature so you must be vigilant on the regulatory side
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:31.280]  and this is something that for 20 years there all the regulations have been
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:35.440]  deregulated and it was told us as a way to grow the economy
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:40.000]  it did for a while grow the real estate market and so people look the other way
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.520]  until the real estate market collapsed and people were left
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:47.200]  worse off than when they started and now we're back to the fundamental
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:50.960]  question of well shouldn't these bankers be regulated
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:53.920]  that's the fundamental question yeah they haven't even brought back glass
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:56.720]  stigle that we got after the depression so so here's the issue
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:01.120]  they're not bringing the regulation back in the public is waking up though
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:05.440]  and so it's two freight trains uh in in collision course
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:09.200]  if they continue these policies for another two years as they've announced
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:14.080]  giving themselves free money while blocking uh in the federal reserve
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:19.120]  paying banks not to lend to main street what is going to happen
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:24.720]  well at this point there is only really one solution and that would go under
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:28.880]  the category of debt jubilee these debts must
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:33.360]  simultaneously be scrubbed off the books the bond holders
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:37.920]  must be paid the piper they're going to take the massive losses that's what
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:41.760]  ron paul says we've got to do that we's absolutely correct
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:46.880]  and jim rickard who's an excellent guy you see him on tv often i've interviewed
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:50.400]  him several times uh he'll break it down for you as well
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:54.160]  he's an excellent guest to consider for your show jim rickard
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:16:00.080]  uh he is of the same belief as well uh and if you go throughout history it's
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:03.200]  right there in the bible you know and the bible itself talked about
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:06.240]  having a jubilee every period of time to
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:09.840]  curve the system of all the bad debts yeah every 10 years and
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:14.160]  and okay and again these idiots that say you've got to prop it up
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:18.320]  we've got to fix the system uh what's the magnet because i some say it's 100
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:22.480]  times some say 200 times the derivatives magnitude versus
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:26.080]  real assets i mean there's no paying off a black hole
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:29.920]  the more solar systems you feed into it the bigger it gets
[02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:34.240]  for the global gvp of the world is about 50 trillion
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:38.320]  and the global derivative market is 600 trillion
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:42.400]  so that's your ratio right there it's over 10 to 1
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:48.480]  uh of of faulty bad derivatives to to uh the gdp in the country that of the
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:50.560]  world so you disagree with the analysis that it's
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:54.880]  1.5 quadrillion well it's if you see there's there's
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:17:00.080]  two there's two numbers here one is the market five which is the actual
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:03.280]  buying and selling of derivatives which is 1.5 quadrillion
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:06.960]  then there's the underlying value of the underlying securities themselves which
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:11.440]  is approximately 600 trillion then some people will say well these
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:14.480]  are completely matched therefore the liability
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:19.600]  is not that great but that assumes that a counterparty like jp morgan is
[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:23.120]  solvent and that's where people like myself and others point out that
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:27.200]  wait a minute you can't really assume that jp morgan's solvent because
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:30.800]  they they have 90 trillion of these bad debts on their books and they're not
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:35.840]  solvent therefore you must use that value of 600 trillion as the liability
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:38.960]  you can't assume that these are going to be offset in some way
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:43.040]  and the trading of these derivatives is over a quadrillion and that's where
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:47.200]  the bankers make their fees they trade these every single day you know that
[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:50.160]  there's over four trillion dollars worth of
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:54.800]  4x or you know currency trade every single day
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:58.800]  so the entire capitalization of america turns over
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:02.400]  you know 14 trillion that turns over every three or four days the entire
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:06.720]  capitalization of america spends every week and they're all in there getting
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:10.880]  fees on selling zombie garbage back and forth
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:14.560]  they're buying and selling america every week for a fee
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:18.560]  and the guy the little businessman out there who's trying to scrape by
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:22.320]  selling widgets for a 50 markup is trying to compete
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:26.080]  for it to make his 20 30 50 thousand dollars a year he's competing with the
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:29.520]  bankers that are in the 1.5 trillion dollar market where they're spending
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:32.400]  his entire country and now the bankers are saying
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:36.400]  raise the taxes to pay us more more bailout money
[02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:40.800]  on the little guy on the street it is just incredible you know i meant to
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:45.840]  get to stan and joe and mark and i really want to get to him but
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:49.920]  we're just we're just out of time i apologize to the callers
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:54.400]  because i've got dr bob bowman coming up and i can't do overdrive because i'm on
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:57.920]  tv today but um we'll see what happens before the
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:00.320]  callers all hang up let me think about it during the break figure out what we're
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:04.800]  going to do here uh gosh i tell you i mean we're in a
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:08.640]  race here max we either educate the public and the public
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:13.440]  take some interest in this and really get angry and and say no to these people
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:17.120]  or we have no future but i think at the end of the day the good news is
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:21.200]  people are starting to get angry if establishment hacks to get elected
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:24.400]  like like rick perrier having to talk like ron paul i mean
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:29.600]  in the final equation is that not a positive indicator uh max
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:36.960]  well ron paul gets it and clearly he would be the guy
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:41.360]  who he would want to sort through this mess but as we know in american
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:44.320]  political history it seems that every time you get somebody
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:48.560]  who knows what they're talking about even close to getting into office
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:51.600]  but you know there's a lot of problems suddenly that come
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:56.560]  uh from left field you know rick perry it you know hold on hold on finish up
[02:19:56.560 --> 02:20:00.880]  finish up stay there

[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:37.360]  painful to know this stuff's happening but it's even more painful to not
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:40.960]  have an avenue to confront these people i i can't imagine what it's like for
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:44.640]  people that are awake but who aren't outwarning others and i can't imagine
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:48.480]  what it's like for the general public that's still not aware of what's
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:52.160]  happening when they finally get hit by this max you were making an interesting
[02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:54.160]  point about the new world order during the break
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:59.520]  and then on rick perry uh please finish um right the um the first thing the
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:03.200]  penultimate step toward this new world order is seeing it in europe the
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:07.680]  trans european bond market that's going to report only to itself okay
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:12.880]  this is plays into the alec stone's new world order
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:16.480]  thesis and you know going back five years
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:20.240]  that was it seemed like it was an idea that was
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:25.120]  not on the radar and you know we talked about the debt jubilee concept which is
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:28.720]  taken from the bible you know to use another bible story
[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:32.000]  it's like that noah in the ark story you know when noah
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:35.200]  started to build the ark everyone thought he was crazy
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:39.440]  now what we now know is that the ark you've been building
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:43.040]  has been to protect us from the rising
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:49.120]  tide of debt 40 days and 49s of bank closures of a bank holiday
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:52.720]  that's what's coming 40 days and 49s of a global
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:56.320]  bank holiday and this and then the other end of this
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:00.800]  will be the new world order which will mean all the global currencies will be
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:05.600]  reset like brenton woods part two the dollar is going to take a 50 to 60
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:10.400]  percent haircut down gold will be a lot higher so
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:13.760]  wool silver and various other currencies will plug into the system a
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:18.560]  different way but that's now no longer off the radar that's
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:21.920]  on the radar now it's happening and it
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:27.200]  it comes down to faith you know as these the bible is called allegories alex i
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:30.080]  don't take the bible literally i see it as
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:33.600]  allegories that can be used you know don't let
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:36.880]  don't let rick perry steal the bible and use it to promote his
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:40.160]  evilness you know the allegories can be used by
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:43.680]  anybody to promote anything in this case
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:48.560]  goodness the the the knowing the arc at story is a fantastic story as an
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:51.520]  allegory as an analogy of what the problem is
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:55.440]  there's a 40 days 49 bank holiday coming
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:00.960]  we're building the arc out of golden silver and you have to have faith
[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:06.160]  absolutely well you know i do believe in god and
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:09.760]  intervening in the affairs of of of humankind if if
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:14.400]  if we ask god for guidance and also take action but um we are definitely in a
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:18.560]  very very dangerous time right now max keiser max keiser dot com

[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:23.120]  the uh as the economists were predicting and that's
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:27.200]  obviously adding more fuel to the fire and that's what's driving the gold prices
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:30.000]  up alex i just need to say that man people should be moving
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:34.880]  83 bucks two silver dollars get the american dream video mark dice's book i
[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:38.720]  mean at least that gets you started understanding what about what's going on

[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:00.880]  beat it i mean right now especially with silver hitting that 41 dollar mark i
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:04.400]  mean come on you're not going to buy two silver dollars alone for that price
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:08.240]  much less get the the book and the video and you need to spread the word now
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:12.080]  more than anything like like uh kaiser's hand man we're talking
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:14.480]  about bank holidays right now the biggest problem
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:17.840]  what bloomberg is reporting on is that the banks are having trouble
[02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:25.760]  806 86 2237 806 86 2237 but again the private shareholders of the six big
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:29.120]  megabanks have to fully terrorize the public
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:32.640]  into acquiescing to their new private bank of the world and for those that
[02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:35.760]  don't know they're now saying a private bank will rule europe
[02:29:35.760 --> 02:29:39.760]  um owned by the very banks that have engaged in the financial terrorism it
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:42.320]  is incredible and you see chavez you see the
[02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:46.240]  university of texas you see all the big institutions grabbing gold

[02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:15.200]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:19.440]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:22.640]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:25.280]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:31:25.280 --> 02:31:29.200]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem

[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:30.400]  years these a lot to talk about i remember pressing him once at a
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:33.440]  in a hotel ballroom where we were giving speeches to
[02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:37.440]  1200 people at the 9-11 event i put on the c-span carried
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:41.760]  and he said well i can tell you a few things they've accidentally
[02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:47.440]  classified declassified uh and allowed to leak out with their big mouths
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:51.360]  and he described these you know robotic space planes
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:55.280]  with the d but d u sabos and i went and looked up what he told me about and
[02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:58.880]  sure enough it it had leaked over the years so we know
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:03.040]  about aurora and all these supposed programs so we'll see how much he'll
[02:34:03.040 --> 02:34:06.640]  tell us here today without violating his national security agreements
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:10.800]  with doctor and of course colonel bob bowman vietnam veteran and more but
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:14.720]  finishing up with uh ted anderson
[02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:20.400]  uh ted uh look i mean for our listeners it's like okay yeah we heard about this
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:22.720]  10 years ago we heard about it five years ago
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:28.000]  i'm always tooting uh bob uh people like bob bowman's horns for being right
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  about politics and i'm always you know tooting max kaiser's or
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.240]  or uh terrell salentaire but the truth is i mean i've been talking about this
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:38.800]  stuff 16 years and having economists on like
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:41.920]  george humphrey by already 12 years ago break down exactly what would happen
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:45.200]  with derivatives and we just heard max kaiser
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:48.640]  breaking down i'm like no telling folks about the new world order coming and
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:51.520]  now it's here and it is a private bank to rule the world

[02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:58.080]  super ponzi scheme operators don't go to jail
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:02.240]  they become world emperors world financial oligarch rulers
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:05.520]  so pretty incredible stuff and we've been telling people buy gold and silver
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:07.920]  because they're devaluing every major currency
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:11.360]  except for the swiss frank which is shooting up like a rocket right now
[02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:15.360]  and so it's time to get into gold and silver now again uh you were telling me
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:18.560]  off air earlier most the gold and silver you've got his stuff you got
[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:21.840]  three weeks ago you buy a head in the market you've got it on hand
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:24.960]  three weeks ago gold was i don't know a hundred bucks less than it is now
[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:28.400]  silver two or three bucks less than it is now you're still able to pass those
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:31.600]  savings on it's like people getting in a time machine
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:36.880]  and going back in time uh and jp morgan the top of the pyramid they say
[02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:40.320]  it's going to be 2,500 by the end of the year i don't know if that's the case i
[02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:43.760]  hope not because that signifies their accelerating the
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:47.440]  demise of the dollar even quicker and the general yuppies out there that only
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:51.760]  care about sports center and the red zone and the rest of it
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:55.120]  they have really got some heartache coming we tried to stop it
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:58.160]  but at least our listeners are somewhat more prepared
[02:35:58.160 --> 02:36:02.080]  i just hope people will call and get the great deals on gold and silver
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:06.400]  and the two to five percent that you end up making on these deals
[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:11.760]  uh also supports the radio network and again that's two to five percent
[02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:15.840]  before the stuff went up so he couldn't sell it to you if he bought it today at
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:19.360]  these prices so briefly ted list some of the other gold and silver
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:23.440]  offers you've got that are radio specials yeah radio specials right now the
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:26.080]  frank i haven't raised in price yet it's at three
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:31.520]  96 85 the british sovereign half ounce or quarter ounce gold coin
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:37.760]  497 uh walking liberty halves right now 1953 is a great buy
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:42.880]  even the older 20s that alex i recommended them at 1900 then 2000
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:46.640]  now they're sitting at 2282 they don't make those anymore there's a finite
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:50.000]  supply you know the demand is pushing those now
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:54.160]  and collectors are non confiscatable uh correct right exactly in that in this
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:57.600]  stuff is the stuff that's next to melt you don't want to be basically getting
[02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:02.080]  a great collector coin at at at near a bullion price right
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:07.520]  us eagles obviously are a good buy too right now they're at 195194
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:11.680]  bags of silver the dimes i call them survival bags of dimes i used to sell
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:15.680]  them in 1000 incur you know the $1000 face increments
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:20.000]  but now we've dropped it down to 1000 dimes which is a hundred dollars face
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.880]  and currently right now it's 3000 and 35 dollars those are real silver dimes
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:28.640]  showing the devaluation there uh ted you've also i know always have a
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:31.680]  smattering of other things like krugerrand's maple
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:34.720]  leaves my favorite i think it's the prettiest coin out there that's being
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:37.520]  minted uh the buffalo's you got any of those
[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:40.320]  yeah we actually do have those available and people should be buying a
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:44.800]  barrel hold hold your horses and i i i want one of those so just hold me one
[02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:48.320]  okay yeah we'll get one okay thank you ted i buy a coin or two here every
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:53.360]  you know a few months if i can 800 686 2237
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:38:00.240]  800 686 2237 ladies and gentlemen now is the time to get involved
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:04.640]  i tried to tell you 250 bucks and 300 bucks and 500 and a thousand and
[02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:09.520]  people said oh it's a bubble then the bubble is the global government
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:12.720]  destroying the currencies and destroying our future and this is not
[02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:16.080]  going to save us getting golden silver but it is a good life boat
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:19.520]  in my educated opinion and this is what i believe in and i think we've been
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:22.880]  born out to be correct the minute i think it's a bubble i'll tell you get out of
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:26.000]  it uh the way they keep me valuing gold could go to 100,000
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.440]  an ounce i mean if they go to zimbabwe enter weimar route i don't think that's
[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:32.960]  going to happen but uh it's not that gold's a bubble it's that
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:37.360]  they're killing the global currencies 800 686 2237
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:41.760]  1800 686 237 ted thank you so much for those reports
[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:46.080]  yeah you bet ellis all right uh now going to bob bowman he is the former
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:50.000]  director of the advanced space program development for the u.s air force
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:53.440]  in the ford and carter administrations when it was secret and a former united
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:57.680]  states air force lieutenant colonel with 101 combat missions he holds a phd in
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:01.600]  aeronautics and nuclear engineering from the california institute of technology
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:05.280]  despite his involvement with space programs and defense he emerged as a
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:08.480]  early public critic of the strategic defense initiative when they weaponized
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:12.960]  it sdi aka star wars during the ronald regga administration in 2000 he
[02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:16.160]  campaigned nationwide with the nomination of reform party of the united
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:20.320]  states of america from president united states the patriots
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:23.760]  dot us is his excellent website and i want to cover
[02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:28.640]  several issues with him but first officer when i saw this last week darpa
[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:32.720]  loses contact with hypersonic aircraft they claim they lost contact with the
[02:39:32.720 --> 02:39:35.520]  last one that goes 13 000 miles an hour we're told
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:40.480]  as if that's the real speed pentagon agency test hypersonic craft
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:45.040]  they call it the global strike and from other folks i've talked to who've
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:48.320]  worked in the air force uh one of them was then hired out of the
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:52.160]  air force to work on the front line of the apollo program raymond teague he
[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:55.120]  told me a lot of stuff privately and then wouldn't say it once he got on air
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:58.240]  but he did say some of it he thought he was he was having hard trouble and
[02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:01.360]  thought he was about to die still alive thank god and told me a lot of stuff but
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:04.560]  i'm not even going to get into that the point is he said yes most of space
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:07.840]  programs secret what you see is not all this out there
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:12.560]  you under you know uh i actually kind of got a little annoyed when i kept
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:16.160]  asking you for hours you know in uh in the green room at the ballroom to tell
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:18.320]  me more you said okay i'll tell you some stuff
[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:22.960]  that's leaked out that they said uh that's that should be classified
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:27.360]  but but you talked about uh robotic drones du sabos
[02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:31.520]  decapitation weapons for heads of state and now i'm seeing more and more of
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:34.960]  this so my question is uh you know they're telling us this is
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:38.480]  the latest but for my information they're just showing us
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:42.240]  you know older stuff kind of like the b2 bomber was around for 20 years before
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:44.960]  they rolled that out uh in the late 80s
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:49.040]  and so what's your take on uh the quote end of the shuttle program
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:52.080]  that we know verner von braun thought up in the 30s
[02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:55.680]  and the fact that they admit that more than 80 percent of the space program
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:41:04.320]  is is is is under darpa and the pentagon well sure uh
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:09.360]  when uh when i was on active duty i was the executive agent for all of
[02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:13.440]  darpa's activities in space which means i made the
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:19.200]  final uh decisions on the contractors and the money and and all that stuff and
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:23.600]  approved the group reports and they were doing a lot of
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:26.960]  interesting things at that time which of course were secret like
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:34.640]  laser battle stations and whatnot and uh we uh
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:41.840]  also developed components for other black programs like those directly
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:46.160]  under the assistant secretary of the air force
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:50.080]  spy satellites and all the rest of that so
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:56.720]  yeah there was a lot of stuff going on and uh i was deeply into uh hypersonic
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:03.360]  aerodynamics my phd thesis at caltech was uh
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:06.640]  studying uh shock waves and boundary layers and
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:11.040]  interactions and whatnot at hypersonic speeds at extremely
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:16.560]  high altitudes and uh so i mean this stuff has been
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:20.560]  under study for a long time i did postdoctoral work at the
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:26.480]  von karman institute in belgium in uh numerical methods for solving
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:30.880]  complex aerodynamic problems like hypersonic flight turbulence which is
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:37.120]  even worse uh but it's interesting to me that uh
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:41.200]  they still don't know enough about the aerodynamics
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:45.680]  to be able to control these things uh they're able to
[02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:51.840]  launch it and uh nine seconds later it goes unstable and they lose it into the
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:55.440]  pacific and if we're to believe them these could
[02:42:55.440 --> 02:42:58.720]  have weapons platforms on them and they're claiming they keep failing and
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:01.680]  they're putting them into orbit and and that's some of the things that you
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:05.040]  talked about that even by the late 70s there were these
[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:12.320]  unmanned craft up there with the sabos well uh
[02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:15.840]  i don't think they can hide something like that in
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:19.440]  in orbit and i got to say it's much easier
[02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:23.440]  to put something like that into orbit than it is to
[02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:28.960]  fly it 13 000 miles an hour through the atmosphere
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:34.400]  and bring it down uh the uh well let me go back before we get
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:38.480]  into this i mean you talked about uh debating the
[02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:41.920]  new head of star wars and others and that they would get mad and start
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:44.880]  blurting classified things out and that's the only reason you can talk
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:47.440]  about it but uh can you i mean can you give us
[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:50.640]  stuff that it is supposed to be classified but it's now
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:54.960]  public domain i mean give us the give us as best you can without violating your
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:44:01.760]  national security agreements of of the the type of stuff they've got
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:06.640]  well uh
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:09.920]  they they can put a lot of stuff into orbit
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:13.600]  uh the the thing is there's so much
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:17.440]  space capability around the world now that
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:23.360]  they can't hide it uh you know we've got school teachers in england and whatnot
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:27.680]  that watch every launch of the united states and well now the
[02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:31.200]  japanese have found big big well it looks like platforms in space and
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:35.680]  things i mean there is a lot of unknown stuff up there
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:40.960]  well there's stuff up there that uh nobody knows exactly what it is
[02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:48.240]  uh but uh uh they do know uh it's orbit it's
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:53.440]  altitude uh and where it is over the earth at just
[02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:58.800]  about any time well just tell us about the du weapons
[02:44:58.800 --> 02:45:05.760]  well that's something that uh uh was under development
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:10.720]  a long time ago and when i was debating one of the colonels in the star wars
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:18.160]  program uh i was talking about uh the fact that uh
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:23.200]  we had shown way back in the 70s that a few pounds of metal properly shaped
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:27.200]  fired at the earth from space could impact like a meteorite digger crater
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:31.760]  and at least in theory be capable of destroying hardened military targets
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:35.920]  like command bunkers and missile silos totally without warning
[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:45.200]  now this colonel uh in his rebuttal to me said now bob you know perfectly well
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:54.000]  that uh uh that program to make a
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:58.240]  titanium and depleted uranium cones and guide them with gps
[02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:01.760]  that program doesn't exist
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:08.480]  and so uh anyway he had revealed technical details which
[02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:14.800]  i had never done uh the fact of the matter is that
[02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:19.440]  um it's possible to do a lot of this stuff
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:26.400]  uh whether it's practical is another thing
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:32.800]  whether we have uh any such things in space ready to de-orbit against the
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:37.200]  pinpoint target somewhere on the earth i really can't
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:45.440]  say at this point i uh i rather doubt it uh but
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:49.920]  that we could have because the technical capability at least
[02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:55.920]  is there uh well i know you just put a satellite with propulsion in the space
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:59.760]  launch at one of the secret shuttle launches or or in one of the other
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:06.000]  rocket launches and then it's got a a weapons array of the
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:09.920]  du weapons and because i believe what you told me
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:13.440]  was you were saying it was being looked at in unmanned systems
[02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:23.680]  for uh head of state decapitation oh yeah oh yeah uh but remember once those
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:27.360]  things are in orbit to get them down out of orbit
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:31.920]  you have to have propulsion to uh de-orbit them
[02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:36.000]  so they have to have some kind of propulsion it's not just a dumb
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:43.200]  piece of metal uh and then you uh you have your sensors
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:50.640]  you have your gps guidance but uh you also need to have uh
[02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:58.000]  some kind of uh capability to steer it either with uh little
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:03.840]  thrusters or with uh little aerodynamic devices at the
[02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:09.200]  tail end of the cone uh and that's one of the things that's hard to do
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:12.080]  and oh i see they're always trying to get steering
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:15.840]  like with this new little space plane uh and that's why they're doing it in the
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:17.840]  atmosphere and not in orbit where it's easier
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:21.440]  because once the weapon comes into the atmosphere that's when it starts going
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:25.120]  crazy they can get the speed they just can't get the accuracy
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:29.840]  right right now getting the accuracy is not
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:36.480]  impossible uh either we studied uh uh terminally
[02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:48.240]  guided icbms uh and uh if you can do that uh you can uh do it with uh these
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:52.720]  rocks from god or whatever they call them now
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:57.360]  um these kind of projects you're talking about controlling an icbm
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:01.520]  throughout the entire process uh as it launches goes into orbit it
[02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:04.560]  comes back down and goes through the merve sequence now now doctor
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:10.000]  expanding about uh uh accurately pinpoint guiding
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:18.160]  and controlling the individual warheads yes um expanding on that it was
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:22.240]  we're about to go to break uh and i want to come back and talk about fukushima
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:25.760]  you well let's just get to fukushima now you were absolutely accurate in that and
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:29.680]  now it turns out they knew there were all these meltdowns they covered it up
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:32.960]  and now the epa just raised the level of radiation
[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:37.360]  of what they say is safe that is not very uh
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:42.640]  reassuring for future disasters that that they just always cover this stuff
[02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:50.000]  up that's right and uh uh still in this
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:53.840]  country we're not talking about replacing the
[02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:57.520]  antiquated reactors that are similar to fukushima
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:04.960]  and uh which uh are on fault lines uh you know like
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:08.320]  along the san andreas fault in california and
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:13.360]  there are even fault lines through the the the midwest and and also up near
[02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:16.800]  new york city uh with the indian point
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:21.440]  reactor all these reactors are disasters waiting to happen
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:26.000]  and if we can't get rid of them we should replace them with a modern
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:32.880]  uh thorium reactor or a molten salt reactor there are lots of
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:36.960]  new kinds of reactors that are far far safer
[02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:41.680]  orders of magnitude safer than the old kinds that we have deployed around the
[02:50:41.680 --> 02:50:44.160]  country all right dr bowman i want to come back and any
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:46.960]  other final comments on the secret space program from you and then

[02:52:38.240 --> 02:52:43.360]  between the forces of freedom and darkness you are the response to the
[02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:47.440]  globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics
[02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:52.400]  dehumanization and ultimate extermination the war is here
[02:52:52.400 --> 02:53:00.800]  it's an info war the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984
[02:53:00.800 --> 02:53:04.160]  what you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40
[02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:07.520]  who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:14.160]  i lost 20 pounds i lost 40 pounds i lost 55 pounds i went from a size 14
[02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:19.200]  to a size eight their secret is amberin the revolutionary formula for women
[02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:22.400]  over 40 that balances hormones naturally
[02:53:22.400 --> 02:53:26.080]  the leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance
[02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:30.160]  until you balance your hormones losing weight can be practically impossible
[02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:34.560]  but amberin restores hormonal balance naturally so the weight can just fall
[02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:38.080]  right off even that stubborn belly fat plus amberin
[02:53:38.080 --> 02:53:41.600]  eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging like hot flashes
[02:53:41.600 --> 02:53:45.200]  night sweats low libido difficulty concentrating and more

[02:54:54.800 --> 02:54:59.520]  and again he's a nuclear physicist as well as a
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:06.080]  degreeed aeronautics expert and engineer really couldn't get a better
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:08.960]  expert on to talk about what's happening you know the dr bowman you have
[02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:12.480]  children grandchildren i think i met your grandson once you
[02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:18.560]  had her with you 21 grandchildren 21 grandchildren
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:22.320]  well you know i've got three children and i love them all
[02:55:22.320 --> 02:55:26.720]  a thousand times my own life and i don't get the ruling class you know they've
[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:29.600]  got reactors blowing up all over the place
[02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:32.880]  they had one out in california in the fifties as you know that nobody knew
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:35.520]  about for two decades worse than chernobyl
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:39.120]  they're they're putting bisphenol and everything they know destroys their own
[02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:42.560]  future what is it about the ruling class
[02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:45.920]  that they for decades have had reactors that are
[02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:50.320]  from what i've seen you know powers of magnitude
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:55.040]  safer statistically and they just don't care and don't replace the old ones
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:57.920]  and when they blow up they say i don't worry about the radiation it's now
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:01.600]  safe i mean 20 years ago they wouldn't let us troops use du
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:04.720]  now they do and say just don't worry about it no safety needed
[02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:08.480]  every time they fire a gun and breathe it it's a death sentence i mean what is it
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:13.840]  with these people well it's hard to say with the nukes
[02:56:13.840 --> 02:56:17.920]  it may be that the new safer reactors of course
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:21.760]  don't make fissionable products as byproducts
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:26.000]  so that puts a crimp in their nuclear weapons program
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:33.840]  ah that's part of it i think but i mean what planet are they gonna live on if
[02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:37.600]  they continue to just i mean i mean to have the u.s military now for 20 years
[02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:42.240]  using du and every type of ammunition and just dying all over the place and it's
[02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:44.720]  admitted and they just don't care i mean it
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:49.040]  yeah uh hundreds of thousands of our own troops
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:52.640]  have been poisoned with depleted uranium will live
[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:56.960]  uh lives of pain and disability and will father
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:00.320]  thousands of children with severe birth defects and
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:03.520]  those people just don't care
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:08.720]  what they i mean going i mean they had du in the 50s as you know dr bowman you
[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:11.840]  were in weapons development but they didn't decide to start serving it out
[02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:15.280]  until 1991 what changed because we've always had
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:19.040]  corrupt elites but what changed in america i mean when do we become the
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:26.400]  leader in evil well the big change the biggest change
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:32.080]  was the assassination of john f kennedy and the takeover of our government
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:37.680]  uh in full force by uh the global elites and and their
[02:57:37.680 --> 02:57:44.080]  minions in the uh cia and so forth that's my thought no that's it so we've
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:48.480]  had a military industrial complex coup we've had a coup and i think it's cute
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:54.080]  to uh soft kill the troops yeah
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:58:01.200]  i guess at the end of the day we really do have psychopaths running things
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:04.720]  i'm afraid we do i mean it's worse than a sociopath i mean
[02:58:04.720 --> 02:58:08.640]  why would a sociopath poison their own nest i've seen the generals move into
[02:58:08.640 --> 02:58:12.160]  bases in iraq that have been bombed with du
[02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:16.320]  and they don't even do a basic deacon i mean what do those generals think
[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:19.840]  they're gonna be just be magic and and another's gonna hurt them either
[02:58:19.840 --> 02:58:24.400]  yeah this ties in with the economy because
[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:28.720]  the way to get the dead under control is to
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:33.040]  uh end the wars tell us stay there dot one minute break when i come back
[02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:36.640]  and give you the floor on the economy for everybody else main transmission over

[02:59:57.200 --> 03:00:01.760]  jones broadcasting network network
[03:00:04.800 --> 03:00:08.640]  the social engineers that run our planet
[03:00:08.640 --> 03:00:13.440]  are very intelligent they have a lot of idiots savants working for them in
[03:00:13.440 --> 03:00:17.280]  areas of specialties but at the end of the day it's like a
[03:00:17.280 --> 03:00:21.280]  diver below a hundred feet starts getting
[03:00:21.280 --> 03:00:25.280]  narcosis they start feeling invincible that's why you got to have a buddy down
[03:00:25.280 --> 03:00:28.400]  there with you because of what's happening chemically in the brain
[03:00:28.400 --> 03:00:32.880]  uh due to different oxygen levels it's the same thing with power it tends to
[03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:36.480]  go to the head and i there's no other prognosis then then the
[03:00:36.480 --> 03:00:40.480]  ruling elite of the west are completely out of their minds
[03:00:40.480 --> 03:00:44.480]  dr bob bowman um is our guest in the little five minutes we've got left he
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:50.960]  was getting into the economy and the wars uh and this this nihilistic crazy
[03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:55.520]  attitude uh of the social engineers dr bowman please
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:00:57.840]  continue
[03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:02.400]  like i say get rid of the debt you end the wars bring our troops home from the
[03:01:02.400 --> 03:01:05.600]  170 countries around the world where we have them
[03:01:05.600 --> 03:01:10.640]  based uh we can uh pay the troops and they
[03:01:10.640 --> 03:01:14.160]  can spend their money here in the united states that'll help the economy
[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:18.480]  if you want to help the economy you make sure every american family is
[03:01:18.480 --> 03:01:22.720]  financially secure that they get a regular paycheck every month
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:27.680]  you put into work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and all the things
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:33.680]  that need doing uh you pull an fdr uh he got the economy
[03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:36.880]  moving if we gave the tens of trillions to the american people we gave to the
[03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:39.760]  banks i mean it would be inflationary but we'd be in
[03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:42.800]  high cotton instead we gave it to the foreign banks
[03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:46.800]  yeah and and the fact of the matter is that that we could
[03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:53.040]  uh give every american family 40 000 a year
[03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:57.280]  uh and it would not be inflationary because
[03:01:57.280 --> 03:02:06.080]  the current deflationary uh pressure recessionary pressure is so great
[03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:12.240]  and uh a Nobel prize-winning economists have said look you got
[03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:16.480]  all of this you can print this money and give to people but
[03:02:16.480 --> 03:02:22.400]  they don't want to do that because uh they want people in debt they want
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:26.000]  people to borrow borrow borrow and explain that to folks
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:29.680]  there's a depression in the real economy and then they say give us bailouts but
[03:02:29.680 --> 03:02:34.560]  it only goes to the offshore banks and so it's it's the worst of both worlds
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:37.440]  but if they really wanted to get out of the recession depression they would
[03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:40.720]  inject the money directly to the people and it'd be over but they want us
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:45.840]  dependent that's right if if uh ordinary working
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:50.160]  americans have money and they know it's going to be
[03:02:50.160 --> 03:02:53.280]  there they don't have to be worried about losing their job they know they'll
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:57.200]  have a subsistence income they'll spend the money
[03:02:57.200 --> 03:03:01.120]  they'll go to the movies they'll buy groceries they'll
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:06.720]  fix the house they'll buy a car and all the businesses will prosper
[03:03:06.720 --> 03:03:13.360]  but the the big businesses uh they're at the top of the food chain
[03:03:13.360 --> 03:03:16.480]  and they've got so many trillions stashed away
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:19.680]  and they want more and the only way they can think of
[03:03:19.680 --> 03:03:26.000]  to get more is to have people have to borrow it from them so they keep
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:29.840]  making more interest and of course they're earning
[03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:36.000]  interest on the national debt too they don't want to fix that
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:39.360]  no they want our credit rating to be dropped so that we are like a third
[03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:42.080]  world country and so that they can make more
[03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:45.680]  interest well you know i mean you know the fact
[03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:48.960]  that s and p would certify the derivatives being
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:52.720]  sold that were worthless trash knowingly but then lower the credit
[03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:55.760]  rating of the united states that's a national security issue right
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:59.280]  there but what i mean what do we expect obama is bought and paid for by the
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:02.800]  very same banks that pay for s and p
[03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:09.200]  yeah i'm afraid so uh in many ways he is no better than george w bush
[03:04:09.200 --> 03:04:13.600]  party at that level means nothing because both of them
[03:04:13.600 --> 03:04:17.760]  are owned lock stock and barrel by these global elites
