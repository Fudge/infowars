[00:00:01.508 --> 00:00:08.160]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.145]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:21.900]  We're live, my friends.
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.421]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:28.184]  It is Sunday, the 16th day of January, 2011.
[00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:31.967]  We're going to be here for the next two hours.
[00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:36.650]  Lindsey Williams, whose predictions have yet begun to come true.
[00:00:37.947 --> 00:00:46.491]  He told us two and a half years ago that within six months oil would go from $60 a barrel to $150 and it did exactly that.
[00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:53.115]  He then said it would start dropping when it was still going up and called it and it began going down.
[00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:57.097]  And three months ago on this radio broadcast, Lindsey Williams with his
[00:00:57.757 --> 00:01:05.842]  Two former oil company exec contacts, one of them formerly the CEO of a big three and the other the head of operations for Atlantic Richfield.
[00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:14.187]  We've now been able to reveal that source's name because he did die of cancer about a month ago and so now Lindsey can bring out all that information.
[00:01:14.187 --> 00:01:23.312]  Lindsey, just three months ago when oil was at again $60 or so a barrel, said that it would be going to between $150 and $200
[00:01:26.414 --> 00:01:35.278]  By the end of 2011, and that you would see that prices going up immediately, that it would start.
[00:01:35.278 --> 00:01:37.099]  And people laughed at him.
[00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.880]  A lot of folks did.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.741]  But within a week, it began to go up.
[00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:42.622]  And here we are three months later.
[00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:44.363]  And the headlines are talking about $100 a barrel.
[00:01:44.363 --> 00:01:46.544]  The executives at Shell are talking about $150 a barrel.
[00:01:46.544 --> 00:01:48.405]  That is all coming up in the
[00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:59.679]  second hour of the broadcast today.
[00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:10.468]  I'm not going to spend a lot of time on Jared Lee Loeffner, but there have been some very big developments on that front we're going to hit first when we come back from break.
[00:02:10.468 --> 00:02:19.697]  Then, just incredible news, I want to get Porter Stansbury of Stansbury & Associates back up as soon as we can because he's called it.
[00:02:19.697 --> 00:02:20.738]  Many others have called it.
[00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:25.779]  Economist and researchers, financial analyst.
[00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.459]  This is out of the French News Agency.
[00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.921]  I have another one out of the Wall Street Journal here.
[00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:40.365]  Who calls currency system product of the past and goes on to say that the days of the dollar being the world reserve currency are coming to an end.
[00:02:40.365 --> 00:02:42.246]  And a lot of people say, well, I don't care.
[00:02:42.246 --> 00:02:44.887]  I'm not in the stock market or I don't quote own dollars.
[00:02:44.887 --> 00:02:46.067]  We all own dollars.
[00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:47.568]  It's the stock of the nation.
[00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:51.192]  And as the dollars devalued, our stock goes down.
[00:02:51.192 --> 00:03:03.810]  That's always the case, but when a country is as hollowed out as we are economically, industrial systems have been decimated like they have been, and you destroy the currency.
[00:03:05.424 --> 00:03:05.524]  It's
[00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:23.319]  No crime.
[00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.102]  They've been preparing for this for a long time.
[00:03:26.102 --> 00:03:29.444]  The globalists are an offshore group of corporations and banks.
[00:03:29.444 --> 00:03:36.830]  They came in, they took over the U.S., they undermined it, they had us fund their world government, and now they're moving shop to China.
[00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:45.217]  And the Council on Foreign Relations and others have traitorously and treasonously bragged about that for at least 30-plus years that I've been able to
[00:03:46.358 --> 00:03:55.262]  Go back and read Foreign Affairs that comes out every month, written by them in their statements, how they planned when Nixon made the deal via the Trilateral Commission and CFR.
[00:03:55.262 --> 00:03:58.863]  A lot of folks will say the Trilateral Commission didn't exist until 74.
[00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.904]  It existed pre-74.
[00:04:01.904 --> 00:04:12.449]  But the issue is that they set up the program to move the base of operations for the world government to China.
[00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.480]  And now they publicly call it the Chinese century.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.880]  Because China will kill dissidents and chop out their organs.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.161]  China will have forced abortions.
[00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:24.501]  China will drug the water supply.
[00:04:24.501 --> 00:04:26.602]  China will censor the internet.
[00:04:26.602 --> 00:04:28.522]  China will have firing squads.
[00:04:28.522 --> 00:04:34.743]  They do have executions in every major city every week in sports stadiums, machine gunning people.
[00:04:34.743 --> 00:04:37.824]  And the globalists look at that and they go, we are in love with this.
[00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:44.453]  As David Rockefeller wrote many times in the New York Times, praising Mao Zedong.
[00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:49.760]  And so, America is converting to an authoritarian system.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.183]  The question is, will we let them?
[00:04:52.183 --> 00:04:53.585]  Will we be slaves?
[00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.187]  Will we go into bondage?
[00:04:55.187 --> 00:04:56.028]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:56.028 --> 00:04:56.489]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:03.445]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:03.445 --> 00:05:04.366]  Number 1.
[00:05:04.366 --> 00:05:07.788]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:07.788 --> 00:05:08.649]  Number 2.
[00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:13.533]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:14.273]  It's true.
[00:05:14.273 --> 00:05:19.157]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:19.157 --> 00:05:19.977]  Number 3.
[00:05:19.977 --> 00:05:23.560]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.482]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:27.482 --> 00:05:27.743]  Number 4.
[00:05:28.263 --> 00:05:31.024]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:31.024 --> 00:05:34.705]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:34.705 --> 00:05:35.485]  Number 5.
[00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:39.627]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:39.627 --> 00:05:44.688]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:44.688 --> 00:05:48.870]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.650]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.172]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1
[00:05:55.912 --> 00:06:05.256]  877-327-0365 The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:05.256 --> 00:06:07.537]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:19.507]  Our top news today, most important piece of information we're going to be covering.
[00:06:19.507 --> 00:06:30.800]  The president of China, Hu Jintao, calls currency system product of the past and says that the days of the dollar being the world reserve currency are now coming to an end.
[00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:49.731]  And this has been strategically all agreed upon via the Trilateral Commission and Council on Foreign Relations, who for more than three decades have openly been moving the infrastructure of the United States to China and debasing the infrastructure of the United States.
[00:06:49.731 --> 00:07:00.798]  The United States has been used to fund the corporate world government and now we're going to be basically popped and imploded like a wet paper bag that has served its usefulness.
[00:07:01.878 --> 00:07:13.004]  And when we lose the dollar as the world reserve currency, whatever air was left in our republic's lungs will be sucked out.
[00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:19.768]  It'll be basically like an astronaut taking off his space suit helmet while doing a spacewalk.
[00:07:19.768 --> 00:07:21.589]  It will not be pretty.
[00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:25.911]  We are almost completely dependent on the dollar.
[00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.873]  That's how we can buy cheap Chinese slave goods or cheap
[00:07:29.795 --> 00:07:30.175]  Good to go.
[00:07:48.586 --> 00:07:50.067]  But we will now pay the piper.
[00:07:50.067 --> 00:07:54.610]  We've been de-industrialized and China is the biggest owner of our debt.
[00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:15.322]  And as I covered a few weeks ago, even one of the latest issues of National Geographic had an article talking about Singapore and talking about how great authoritarianism is and how America and the rest of the world want to segue into authoritarianism.
[00:08:16.485 --> 00:08:16.745]  I don't know.
[00:08:36.337 --> 00:08:41.762]  More black uniforms, more cameras, more taxes, more regulations.
[00:08:41.762 --> 00:08:52.571]  Because if there's one disease this country has, it's that so many petty little nobodies think they're powerful and big because they imagine in their mind
[00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:57.055]  Because they sit there nodding their heads with the talking heads on television.
[00:08:57.055 --> 00:09:07.427]  They sit there in unison agreeing with what people are regurgitating around the water cooler that they heard on mainline talk radio or watched on Fox News or CNN News.
[00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:09.389]  I don't
[00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:27.041]  All right.
[00:09:44.005 --> 00:09:55.990]  Plenty of gladiatorial diversions for you on television and lots of American flags everywhere and lots of people wearing American flag lapel pins.
[00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:06.355]  When you see the neocons or mainline liberals doing that on television, that means they support the rendition, the secret arrest, the torture, the endless wars.
[00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:13.278]  It's a fascist salute to the flag that they've taken over and turned into their symbol.
[00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:36.513]  The old flag that stood for the old republic, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the property rights, everything that goes along with it, it's been removed a long time ago and we're not going to get it back until we wake up to the fact and collectively realize that America as it's been known as a free country is dead.
[00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:41.411]  And the last vestiges are now being removed.
[00:10:41.411 --> 00:10:42.591]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:53.615]  I turned on NPR this morning, and they were talking about how great it is to censor talk radio and the internet, and they were saying, well, we've got speed limits on roads, don't we?
[00:10:53.615 --> 00:10:55.516]  We need to have the government take over media.
[00:10:56.613 --> 00:10:59.495]  And they've got all this legislation introduced to do just that.
[00:10:59.495 --> 00:11:10.701]  And the Republicans gave you free speech zones, and now Barack Obama has expanded them, and the Republican puppets to come, they'll no doubt expand it until we have fundamental change.
[00:11:10.701 --> 00:11:17.085]  So they're now going after the Second Amendment and the First Amendment extrajudicially.
[00:11:17.085 --> 00:11:17.766]  They don't care.
[00:11:19.734 --> 00:11:33.525]  If the Congress doesn't pass the new carbon taxes under UN treaty, giving over our sovereignty, why they'll just have the Environmental Protection Agency through the executive branch do it without force of law.
[00:11:33.525 --> 00:11:43.932]  And when the duly elected legislature of Texas and the duly elected Attorney General say we're not going to put these carbon taxes on Texas power plants and thus consumers,
[00:11:44.753 --> 00:11:51.785]  The federal government comes in with no law, no authority but the barrel of a gun and seizes the power plants.
[00:11:51.785 --> 00:11:52.627]  That happened two weeks ago.
[00:11:52.627 --> 00:11:55.031]  They seized them under licensing.
[00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:56.734]  A license is an authorization.
[00:11:57.682 --> 00:12:01.084]  A letter of mark to do something which would normally be illegal.
[00:12:01.084 --> 00:12:12.931]  If you go back 300 years ago in England, France, or Spain, it was illegal to go out and randomly rob people's ships unless you were given a license or an authorization, a letter of mark.
[00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:26.419]  And see, we as prisoners under the emergency reorganization of 1933 and the federalized state police that were set up are not allowed to travel on the federal government's or Her Majesty's roads, so we have to get a permit to do that.
[00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:36.246]  And our power plants have to have permits under admiralty, under a federal maritime seizure and license.
[00:12:36.246 --> 00:12:46.013]  And so the executive is dispensing with the ceremonial Congress whole hog.
[00:12:46.013 --> 00:12:55.080]  And of course it was Begala, one of Clinton's top advisors, who said, stroke of the pen, law of the land, kind of cool.
[00:12:56.158 --> 00:13:14.413]  But you see, when you lose law and you lose the Constitution and Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence, those are the big laws that govern the government, that big, powerful, dangerous force that in history is the great destroyer of liberty, of property, of life.
[00:13:14.413 --> 00:13:15.694]  You must tie it down.
[00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:16.655]  You must bound it.
[00:13:16.655 --> 00:13:17.515]  You must watch it closely.
[00:13:19.437 --> 00:13:20.318]  But we were taught that.
[00:13:20.318 --> 00:13:22.340]  That's un-American to have small government.
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.241]  It's un-American to watch it closely.
[00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:26.543]  It's un-American to criticize your government.
[00:13:26.543 --> 00:13:36.632]  You sit down and you shut up and you let foreign banks come in with unlimited fiat money they created out of nothing with derivatives and other counterfeit instruments they sell into the market.
[00:13:36.632 --> 00:13:39.894]  And you let them buy off the administrations of the world.
[00:13:39.894 --> 00:13:43.578]  And you let them levy new taxes upon all human activity.
[00:13:43.578 --> 00:13:44.859]  And you let them rule.
[00:13:46.209 --> 00:13:47.389]  You let them do that.
[00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:51.570]  That's a lot better system than rule of law.
[00:13:51.570 --> 00:14:01.972]  And so we will now reap the fruits of pulling out our republic by the roots and throwing it in the ditch to die.
[00:14:01.972 --> 00:14:04.432]  Now, have you ever pulled a little bush up?
[00:14:04.432 --> 00:14:07.553]  And it might live a week or so out of the dirt.
[00:14:07.553 --> 00:14:10.793]  But at a certain point, the bush dies.
[00:14:10.793 --> 00:14:15.254]  And America is a dried, dead bush in the ditch.
[00:14:16.394 --> 00:14:26.919]  But in all of us is that seedling of the universe of liberty and freedom and common sense and the love of what's honorable and good and we can...
[00:14:28.604 --> 00:14:30.225]  Not bring the old republic back.
[00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:30.886]  It's gone.
[00:14:30.886 --> 00:14:31.746]  Long gone.
[00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:47.357]  But we can rediscover and rebuild a new republic as the Declaration of Independent States, that it is not our right, but that it is our duty to throw off corrupt and usurpatious, destructive government.
[00:14:47.357 --> 00:14:57.824]  In fact, the line before it talks about how the corrupt system has schemed and worked hard to build systems of dehumanization and enslavement.
[00:14:57.824 --> 00:14:58.104]  You see,
[00:14:59.324 --> 00:15:14.131]  A good person, an average person, a hard-working, decent family man or woman, regardless of what color or creed or religion you are, someone who has common sense, has a blind spot though, you can't imagine that they're evil and corrupt people.
[00:15:15.546 --> 00:15:30.472]  And the minute that you're not taught to stand up jealously and guard freedom and to keep government in its place as the servant and not the official, the authority, new words for the master, the king, our ruler, our owners.
[00:15:36.331 --> 00:15:47.637]  And so here we are, going back into bondage, and a high-tech bondage, dripping with high-tech propaganda and semantical wordsmithing.
[00:15:47.637 --> 00:15:58.022]  So we're gonna get into the Chinese owner of America, and that's what, that's what it is, saying to us, hey, you're going into a depression, we own you, slaves.
[00:15:58.022 --> 00:15:59.023]  That's coming up, stay with us.
[00:16:00.162 --> 00:16:01.804]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:17:59.528 --> 00:18:03.112]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:18:03.112 --> 00:18:04.413]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:18:04.413 --> 00:18:08.818]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:18:08.818 --> 00:18:14.745]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:18:14.745 --> 00:18:16.907]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:18:16.907 --> 00:18:19.590]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:26.413]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.

[00:18:58.857 --> 00:19:02.699]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.

[00:19:11.665 --> 00:19:17.629]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:19:17.629 --> 00:19:20.871]  Not worried about them moving south.
[00:19:20.871 --> 00:19:24.633]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:34.054]  We're American and be proud.
[00:19:34.054 --> 00:19:37.255]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:19:53.568 --> 00:20:01.032]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:20:01.032 --> 00:20:04.634]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.634 --> 00:20:15.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.802]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:20:19.136 --> 00:20:31.582]  If you just tuned in for the first time and you're wondering who is this guy, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.582 --> 00:20:35.123]  I've been on the air for 16 years.
[00:20:35.123 --> 00:20:45.208]  I have the news websites InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and we also have PrisonPlanet.tv where we archive all of my documentary films.
[00:20:45.808 --> 00:20:51.733]  The hundreds and hundreds of special video interviews I've done with guests around the country and the world.
[00:20:51.733 --> 00:20:59.359]  And of course, we also stream live and archive a full video production along with the radio.
[00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:05.585]  So the radio show you're listening to is simulcast at presentplanet.tv.
[00:21:05.585 --> 00:21:12.591]  Now, I remember when I first started waking up 18 years ago.
[00:21:12.591 --> 00:21:13.872]  That's the reason I got on air.
[00:21:15.037 --> 00:21:18.565]  One of the big ones is I saw attacks on the Second Amendment property rights.
[00:21:18.565 --> 00:21:25.740]  I was pretty much like a mainline Ron Paul type libertarian conservative at that time before I really learned how much more hardcore it was.
[00:21:28.968 --> 00:21:37.053]  I began to research, and I would read the Council on Foreign Relations reports they were putting out, Trilateral Commission, Club of Rome, UN.
[00:21:37.053 --> 00:21:50.261]  I would read UN reports about how they were going to set up a global government and have one-child policies worldwide, how they were going to make us all live basically in compact cities, how they would start restricting family farming and ranching.
[00:21:51.317 --> 00:21:57.209]  Under the guise of environmentalism, how they were going to have a post-industrial world.
[00:21:57.209 --> 00:22:02.318]  And so I've made these documentary films and sourced all of that information in my attempt to warn people.
[00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:12.336]  But one of the biggest themes in all of this was how the big banks had to get rid of Glass-Steagall so they could sell over $1,000 trillion.
[00:22:12.336 --> 00:22:14.678]  It's $1.5 quadrillion conservatively.
[00:22:14.678 --> 00:22:17.701]  The Washington Post whitewashes and says $600 trillion.
[00:22:17.701 --> 00:22:21.745]  Whatever, $600 trillion, $1.5 quadrillion, as many economists say here on air.
[00:22:23.996 --> 00:22:26.997]  It's impossible to ever pay back and it's fraud.
[00:22:26.997 --> 00:22:29.397]  Why are we having to pay back what isn't owed?
[00:22:29.397 --> 00:22:38.059]  Remember a month ago when they started bringing down Ireland and the head of their private central bank said, we want Ireland to be owned by foreign bankers.
[00:22:38.059 --> 00:22:39.240]  That was a quote.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.060]  And Ireland owes this money.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.601]  And then it came out that the Irish didn't know any of it.
[00:22:43.601 --> 00:22:49.482]  These were quote debts of the big mega banks, JP Morgan, Chase, uh,
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:58.342]  Seychelles General, Goldman Sachs, the same thing came out in Iceland.
[00:22:58.342 --> 00:23:19.886]  They have done this, but they hold everybody hostage and say, well, we're too big to fail, you've got to do this, we'll bring your society down, but then you're not even really bailing them out, you're falling to their financial ownership and their new financial backer and physical muscle is Communist China.
[00:23:20.928 --> 00:23:27.953]  And I can't tell you how many speeches I've seen on C-SPAN or how many people out there that read Forbes and the Wall Street Journal.
[00:23:27.953 --> 00:23:28.793]  You've all seen it.
[00:23:28.793 --> 00:23:30.454]  It's everywhere.
[00:23:30.454 --> 00:23:49.307]  In the last 30 years, but accelerating the last decade, all they talk about is the Chinese century coming up and how China is going to dominate while our government gives them the missiles and the MIRV technology for the reentry devices so one ICBM can destroy 20 cities, not just one.
[00:23:51.008 --> 00:23:56.954]  For those that don't know, the missile comes back into the atmosphere, the nose cone pops off, and then fires a whole bunch of different warheads.
[00:23:56.954 --> 00:24:13.229]  Clinton gave them that, and I watched all of this, and we've been screaming bloody murder every broadcast since then, that this was done strategically by design, and these mega banks admit that they've done it.
[00:24:14.102 --> 00:24:26.496]  And so they sold America on invading all these countries, they sold America on going deep into debt to these banks, and going deep into debt for fiat currency they just made up out of nothing.
[00:24:26.496 --> 00:24:32.963]  So they get the world purely through fraud, but now their military backer, their military muscle is China.
[00:24:33.724 --> 00:24:58.017]  And our government is being turned in against the people, and all over the nation they're openly activating citizen spy groups and citizen police groups with their own police cars, their own radar guns, their own... My dad called me this morning, he was driving up to Dallas on business, and he heard Waco Radio talking about spy on your neighbors and all this, and I went to the Waco Police Department's site, and they said, yeah, listen to what your neighbors say.
[00:24:58.977 --> 00:25:02.625]  We reported Friday out of Oklahoma with Homeland Security.
[00:25:02.625 --> 00:25:05.410]  It's on their public Homeland Security website.
[00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:06.151]  State of Oklahoma.
[00:25:06.151 --> 00:25:08.556]  It says, are your neighbor buying guns and ammo?
[00:25:08.556 --> 00:25:10.199]  Does your neighbor talk about
[00:25:13.069 --> 00:25:14.790]  Politically controversial things.
[00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.411]  Go ahead and call Homeland Security on them.
[00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:22.292]  You see, these banks that have done this have done it through fraud.
[00:25:22.292 --> 00:25:30.214]  And they know they're going to go to prison, like a Ken Lay or a Bernie Madoff, but on a grander scale if they don't put a police state in.
[00:25:30.214 --> 00:25:31.655]  That's what this is all about.
[00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:32.535]  This isn't a game.
[00:25:34.019 --> 00:25:38.403]  And they are completely dismantling the Bill of Rights and Constitution right now.
[00:25:38.403 --> 00:25:40.505]  We are being conquered.
[00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:44.808]  And this is such huge news, not to our audience, but to the general public.
[00:25:44.808 --> 00:26:01.623]  AFP, Wall Street Journal, they're all reporting China's President Hu Jintao said today the international currency system was a product of the past, but it will be a long time before the Chinese currency is accepted as the international currency.
[00:26:03.166 --> 00:26:10.428]  And what he's talking about there is they are now phasing out the dollar as the world reserve currency.
[00:26:10.428 --> 00:26:17.809]  They've made deals with Russia and others that it be the currency that they use to trade in oil and other resources with each other.
[00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:19.810]  The Arabs are moving away from the dollar.
[00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.470]  The dollar is being devalued globally.
[00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:24.811]  That's why oil prices are surging.
[00:26:24.811 --> 00:26:26.991]  That's why food prices are surging.
[00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:30.792]  There are other things feeding into that, but overall it's the dollar devaluation.
[00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:37.132]  But the yuppies won't care because our stock market is influenced by the dollar.
[00:26:37.132 --> 00:26:42.354]  So if it costs more dollars to buy those stocks, they see those stocks going up.
[00:26:42.354 --> 00:26:45.435]  It's artificial.
[00:26:45.435 --> 00:26:48.356]  And so they think, well, this is great, this economy's great.
[00:26:48.356 --> 00:26:50.437]  The shops are all shutting down around them.
[00:26:50.437 --> 00:26:52.718]  They're seeing more and more homeless people.
[00:26:52.718 --> 00:26:59.901]  All the economic indicators show the country's going belly up, but the yuppie just says, my stock's going up, my stock's going up, until it completely implodes.
[00:27:00.973 --> 00:27:05.257]  And then they'll run wanting to the government to be told, you know, what to do next.
[00:27:05.257 --> 00:27:16.666]  But continuing, his comments, which came ahead of the state visit to Washington coming up on Wednesday, reflected the continuing tensions over the dollar's role as the major reserve currency in the aftermath of the U.S.
[00:27:16.666 --> 00:27:18.548]  financial crisis of 08.
[00:27:18.548 --> 00:27:20.469]  That wasn't a financial crisis.
[00:27:20.469 --> 00:27:28.056]  That's when the banks threatened total financial collapse if they weren't given dictatorial power to steal tens of trillions of dollars and not tell Congress where the money went.
[00:27:29.551 --> 00:27:34.737]  The current international currency system is the product of the past, he went on.
[00:27:34.737 --> 00:27:40.143]  The monetary policy in the United States has a major impact on global liquidity and capital flows and therefore the liquidity of the U.S.
[00:27:40.143 --> 00:27:46.009]  dollar should be kept at a reasonable and stable level, criticizing the fact that the world is being flooded with dollars.
[00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:49.853]  Here's another one out of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:27:49.853 --> 00:27:53.397]  Who highlights need for U.S.-China cooperation?
[00:27:53.397 --> 00:27:54.938]  Questions dollar.
[00:27:54.938 --> 00:27:59.944]  Chinese President Hu Jintao emphasized the need for cooperation with the U.S.
[00:27:59.944 --> 00:28:07.192]  in areas for new energy to space ahead of his visit to Washington this week.
[00:28:08.629 --> 00:28:10.634]  But he called for the present U.S.
[00:28:10.634 --> 00:28:18.192]  dollar-dominated currency system, a product of the past, and highlighted moves to turn their currency into the global currency.
[00:28:19.838 --> 00:28:23.001]  And they go on to break all of that down.
[00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:25.442]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:25.442 --> 00:28:27.164]  Sold out from within.
[00:28:27.164 --> 00:28:29.606]  Where does Henry Kissinger live a lot of the time?
[00:28:29.606 --> 00:28:30.146]  China.
[00:28:30.146 --> 00:28:32.348]  David Rockefeller, China.
[00:28:32.348 --> 00:28:33.649]  Maury Strong, China.
[00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:34.689]  Kofi Annan, China.
[00:28:34.689 --> 00:28:37.632]  In fact, there's two places Crooks run.
[00:28:37.632 --> 00:28:40.013]  Where did the Tunisian president run?
[00:28:40.834 --> 00:28:42.115]  Saudi Arabia.
[00:28:42.115 --> 00:28:44.357]  They run to Saudi Arabia or they run to China.
[00:28:44.357 --> 00:28:46.339]  Sometimes they run to Israel.
[00:28:46.339 --> 00:28:48.040]  But there you have it.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.482]  So, their mission is almost complete.
[00:28:50.482 --> 00:28:56.087]  As long as you just sit there and drink beer and watch football and don't care, they're going to have their way.
[00:28:56.087 --> 00:28:56.287]  Okay?
[00:28:56.287 --> 00:28:58.269]  And then you're going to be so poor you won't be able to fight back.
[00:29:00.063 --> 00:29:04.606]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:29:04.606 --> 00:29:05.526]  Number 1.
[00:29:05.526 --> 00:29:08.949]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:29:08.949 --> 00:29:09.809]  Number 2.
[00:29:09.809 --> 00:29:14.692]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:29:14.692 --> 00:29:15.433]  It's true.
[00:29:15.433 --> 00:29:20.316]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:29:20.316 --> 00:29:21.136]  Number 3.
[00:29:21.136 --> 00:29:24.719]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:29:24.719 --> 00:29:28.421]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:29:28.621 --> 00:29:29.422]  Number 4.
[00:29:29.422 --> 00:29:32.185]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:29:32.185 --> 00:29:35.869]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:29:35.869 --> 00:29:36.649]  Number 5.
[00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:40.794]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:29:40.794 --> 00:29:45.559]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:29:45.839 --> 00:29:50.024]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:29:50.024 --> 00:29:51.806]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:30:00.762 --> 00:30:16.235]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:30:16.235 --> 00:30:19.918]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:20.922 --> 00:30:33.694]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:30:33.694 --> 00:30:40.960]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:30:41.641 --> 00:30:52.030]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.954]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.

[00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:03.891]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:31:03.891 --> 00:31:10.313]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:31:10.313 --> 00:31:17.694]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:31:17.694 --> 00:31:22.555]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:31:22.555 --> 00:31:24.656]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800
[00:31:26.117 --> 00:31:31.224]  3407091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:31:31.224 --> 00:31:34.950]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:31:35.481 --> 00:31:42.244]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:31:42.244 --> 00:31:46.146]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:31:46.146 --> 00:31:54.210]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:54.670]  Thank you.
[00:31:59.452 --> 00:32:00.632]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:32:00.632 --> 00:32:07.555]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:07.555 --> 00:32:10.116]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:10.116 --> 00:32:15.497]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:15.497 --> 00:32:18.538]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:18.538 --> 00:32:20.599]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:27.103]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:27.103 --> 00:32:30.485]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:30.485 --> 00:32:36.269]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:37.910]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.191]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:39.191 --> 00:32:41.873]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:32:41.873 --> 00:32:46.095]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:46.095 --> 00:32:48.137]  You can find the video at www.
[00:32:48.897 --> 00:32:50.698]  End of America 3.com.
[00:32:50.698 --> 00:32:53.299]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:32:53.299 --> 00:32:57.160]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.141]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:33:01.141 --> 00:33:04.722]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.722 --> 00:33:07.924]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.201]  Thank you for joining us, my friends.
[00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:25.662]  Pastor Lindsey Williams is going to be on in the next hour.
[00:33:25.662 --> 00:33:36.465]  He knew the former head of operations at Atlantic Richfield, who recently died of cancer, Mr. Fromm, who spilt his guts about what the elite were planning.
[00:33:37.205 --> 00:33:37.365]  I think?
[00:33:54.544 --> 00:33:57.066]  60 dollars a barrel or 65 dollars a barrel.
[00:33:57.066 --> 00:33:59.788]  His same source told him he'd be going to 150.
[00:33:59.788 --> 00:34:03.290]  People laughed at that and in the next six months it did.
[00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:08.413]  Of course, he also has another source who's the former CEO of an even bigger oil company.
[00:34:08.413 --> 00:34:12.156]  I know the gentleman's name and information, but we're not going to give that source out on air.
[00:34:12.156 --> 00:34:14.097]  Mr. Fromm has now died so we can talk about it.
[00:34:16.072 --> 00:34:23.935]  But Lindsey Williams is going to be joining us because, hey, three months ago he said it here, you'd be seeing $100 a barrel very early in the year.
[00:34:23.935 --> 00:34:27.196]  And his source said $150 to $200 a barrel, or $5 to $8, depending on where it is in the country.
[00:34:27.196 --> 00:34:32.338]  Anywhere between $150 a barrel and $200 a barrel will be between $5 on the low end and $8 a gallon at the gas pump.
[00:34:43.482 --> 00:34:46.864]  And of course, we also told you about food prices were going to be exploding.
[00:34:46.864 --> 00:34:49.205]  And you now see those reports out there.
[00:34:49.205 --> 00:34:53.527]  Of course, none of the media will tell you why, though.
[00:34:53.527 --> 00:34:58.450]  They'll claim there was a storm in Russia, or there was some bad weather, and all of that contributes.
[00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.872]  But it's dollar devaluation.
[00:35:01.872 --> 00:35:04.713]  Food riots going on all over the world right now.
[00:35:04.713 --> 00:35:06.034]  Food riots in Tunisia.
[00:35:07.592 --> 00:35:11.935]  And notice they've got their third president in less than 48 hours.
[00:35:11.935 --> 00:35:14.997]  And their presidents are hightailing it out to Saudi Arabia.
[00:35:14.997 --> 00:35:18.620]  Kind of like the head of BP.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.062]  You know, they just shuffle the deck chairs with those guys.
[00:35:21.062 --> 00:35:24.764]  Or the head of Halliburton, moving their operation to the Middle East.
[00:35:24.764 --> 00:35:31.909]  Or that good American company, Blackwater, who we now learn has been involved in so much corruption, moving to Dubai.
[00:35:31.909 --> 00:35:33.711]  They're all leaving America!
[00:35:33.711 --> 00:35:35.072]  They're done with America!
[00:35:35.072 --> 00:35:36.893]  They're going to leave us here with a
[00:35:38.683 --> 00:35:42.785]  We'll just go ahead and get Lindsey on directly at the very start of the next hour.
[00:36:00.257 --> 00:36:00.518]  I think?
[00:36:21.539 --> 00:36:25.822]  I don't know what we can do about the dollar imploding, or these foreign banks robbing us and looting us.
[00:36:25.822 --> 00:36:36.888]  I know we can say we don't owe this foreign debt and let those bankers go under and sink the New World Order, and we're going to have problems, but it's not going to be as bad as letting them suck us all the way down to the bottom.
[00:36:36.888 --> 00:36:42.612]  But an area where we can really fight back is on the fluoride issue.
[00:36:44.287 --> 00:36:51.178]  And we've got all the real literature, all the real medical reports, even the government's own scientists say take it out of the water.
[00:36:51.178 --> 00:36:55.224]  It's a seven-fold increase in cancers in men, bone cancers.
[00:36:55.224 --> 00:36:58.228]  It's a doubling overall in women.
[00:36:59.488 --> 00:36:59.648]  Yeah.
[00:37:18.741 --> 00:37:23.582]  And it gets into the government a few weeks ago having to admit now that fluoride is causing problems.
[00:37:23.582 --> 00:37:26.083]  But their answer is to lower the amount they're putting in the water.
[00:37:26.083 --> 00:37:30.944]  It's like, oh, shooting you twice in the head is bad, so we're only going to shoot you once in the head.
[00:37:30.944 --> 00:37:41.267]  The little problem is we happen to have the declassified Department of Defense and Rockefeller Foundation docs on the vaccines and the fluoride, and we know exactly why you put it in there.
[00:37:41.267 --> 00:37:42.748]  And 87% sperm count reduction.
[00:37:44.608 --> 00:37:48.030]  And the country is obese and unhealthy and thyroids are going out.
[00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:51.071]  The pancreases are going out very nicely.
[00:37:51.071 --> 00:37:53.552]  And you've done a superlative job.
[00:37:53.552 --> 00:38:05.277]  Your soft-kill eugenics weapon has made Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, the most aggressive, liberty-loving people in the world into the self-propelled stomach zombies that we are today.
[00:38:06.732 --> 00:38:13.654]  But, even in their mind-numbed haze, we have all the admissions in a 10-minute video, the absolute brief of what's going on.
[00:38:13.654 --> 00:38:23.177]  So we're going to be airing that, but I beg of you to get the free video with the article by Aaron Dykes and Alex Jones at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:38:23.177 --> 00:38:24.598]  It's right there on the front page.
[00:38:24.598 --> 00:38:27.919]  Bombshell how fluoride is killing you and your children.
[00:38:28.735 --> 00:38:30.676]  That's the PrisonPlanet.com headline.
[00:38:30.676 --> 00:38:37.080]  A variant of it is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:49.167]  And if you go over to InfoWars.com, you can also read the article, all sourced and in mainline government studies that they hope you don't look at, and breaking the entire situation down.
[00:38:49.167 --> 00:38:49.447]  Okay.
[00:38:51.489 --> 00:38:51.869]  I don't
[00:39:09.634 --> 00:39:18.420]  Thousand locations that are getting or are about to get telescreens at all checkout counters with Homeland Security saying watch your neighbors, watch other shoppers.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.221]  Now it's the computer isn't safe.
[00:39:20.221 --> 00:39:22.362]  Don't worry, Homeland Security is taking over the web.
[00:39:22.362 --> 00:39:23.723]  We actually have the video.
[00:39:23.723 --> 00:39:25.204]  They're actually saying that.
[00:39:25.204 --> 00:39:29.767]  They're just getting you used to billboards and announcements and troops marching around.
[00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:36.592]  But then the borders are wide open and Mexican troops are shooting cops and shooting at highway patrol and they've canceled the fence they never built.
[00:39:38.453 --> 00:39:42.277]  See, Homeland Security's for you.
[00:39:42.277 --> 00:39:43.198]  It's for me.
[00:39:43.198 --> 00:39:51.486]  It's for the American people if we don't like being gang-raped by the globalists, financially and societally.
[00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:55.310]  And I got all those news articles here.
[00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.471]  Mexican gunmen fires across border towards U.S.
[00:39:57.471 --> 00:39:58.751]  highway workers.
[00:39:58.751 --> 00:40:05.533]  Well, of course, I mean, 80 plus miles into Arizona, the feds had to put up signs three months ago saying don't go into these areas.
[00:40:05.533 --> 00:40:07.093]  Now under control of Mexico.
[00:40:07.093 --> 00:40:21.357]  Mexico's highly nationalistic, hates the United States, has lost multiple wars with the U.S., and they teach everybody in Mexico that this is Mexico, and it's called the La Reconquista, the La Infasora, and there's literally dozens of radio and TV stations saying it's Infasora.
[00:40:21.997 --> 00:40:30.541]  But the lionfasora is the big banks own Mexico and they're using their nationalism as a weapon against the U.S.
[00:40:30.541 --> 00:40:30.981]  The U.S.
[00:40:30.981 --> 00:40:36.743]  doesn't have nationalism, or if it is, it's a hollow nationalism that says bomb brown people overseas.
[00:40:36.743 --> 00:40:45.627]  It's just kind of some vague thing football heads kind of just feel manly about and stick an American flag on their car and have no idea what's happening.
[00:40:45.627 --> 00:40:47.768]  And then meanwhile, this is going on.
[00:40:49.298 --> 00:40:54.661]  Homeland Security acts as Bush-era virtual fence, and they've axed the physical fence.
[00:40:54.661 --> 00:41:01.925]  I mean, they've built maybe a hundred miles of it with giant openings in it for, quote, drainage that you can stand up and walk through.
[00:41:01.925 --> 00:41:03.426]  I mean, it's all fake.
[00:41:03.426 --> 00:41:06.267]  The National Guard they put down there aren't allowed to apprehend anybody.
[00:41:06.267 --> 00:41:08.529]  It's all fake.
[00:41:08.529 --> 00:41:11.330]  Our government launders those drugs, folks.
[00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.311]  They launder the money.
[00:41:13.404 --> 00:41:16.606]  And all these good old boys are like, I just can't believe our government would do that.
[00:41:16.606 --> 00:41:21.989]  It came out in the 1997 CIA hearings in Congress, they bring the drugs in.
[00:41:21.989 --> 00:41:23.590]  It came out in Vietnam, they bring them in.
[00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:28.793]  Now they just say, yeah, Rolda Rivera, Fox News, let's talk to this Marine Corps colonel.
[00:41:28.793 --> 00:41:29.614]  Colonel, what are you doing?
[00:41:29.614 --> 00:41:31.755]  Well, we give them fertilizer and help them grow the opium.
[00:41:31.755 --> 00:41:33.556]  That's what we're doing.
[00:41:33.556 --> 00:41:40.501]  But let the cops find your idiot college daughter or son on schmack, and they're going to prison for a long time.
[00:41:41.485 --> 00:41:43.849]  This is a ridiculous fraud!
[00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:46.453]  None of us are safe!
[00:41:46.453 --> 00:41:47.995]  And for all the corruption we know about...
[00:41:49.937 --> 00:41:51.939]  We might know about 1% of it.
[00:41:51.939 --> 00:41:54.902]  There's always just more, more, more, more, more.
[00:41:54.902 --> 00:42:00.527]  It just gets crazier and crazier because of the naivete of the American people.
[00:42:00.527 --> 00:42:06.111]  All you out there that think it's safe to stay on the bench going into this tyranny, you know, 10 years ago you'd say, oh, Alex is a nut.
[00:42:06.111 --> 00:42:08.373]  Now you say, oh man, we are going into tyranny.
[00:42:08.373 --> 00:42:10.055]  We better keep our heads down.
[00:42:10.055 --> 00:42:12.777]  That's what the smart people do.
[00:42:12.777 --> 00:42:15.860]  Yeah, they kept their heads down in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia too, didn't they?
[00:42:16.502 --> 00:42:21.065]  And they kept their heads down when they ran them into pits to shoot them in the back of their head.
[00:42:21.065 --> 00:42:23.866]  I'm not that domesticated.
[00:42:23.866 --> 00:42:26.748]  Okay, continuing here.
[00:42:26.748 --> 00:42:31.911]  So, all of that's going on, and then meanwhile, witch hunt!
[00:42:31.911 --> 00:42:35.593]  FBI visiting conservative bloggers after Tucson shootings.
[00:42:35.593 --> 00:42:41.317]  Conservative bloggers all over the country that don't even say anything threatening are getting homeland security visits.
[00:42:41.317 --> 00:42:42.918]  The message is, you don't do that.
[00:42:43.669 --> 00:42:52.197]  Meanwhile, the hoax has blown up in their face with the G-String Grim Reaper killer.
[00:42:52.197 --> 00:42:53.839]  Remember last Sunday I told you?
[00:42:53.839 --> 00:42:55.540]  Devil-worshipping cross-dresser.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.843]  I called him and they admitted it later.
[00:42:57.843 --> 00:42:58.904]  I could just see into his soul.
[00:43:00.603 --> 00:43:04.186]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:43:04.186 --> 00:43:05.488]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:43:05.488 --> 00:43:09.892]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:43:09.892 --> 00:43:15.817]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:43:15.817 --> 00:43:17.979]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:43:17.979 --> 00:43:20.662]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:43:21.002 --> 00:43:27.506]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:43:27.506 --> 00:43:29.707]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:35.051]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:43:35.051 --> 00:43:40.334]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:43:40.334 --> 00:43:45.517]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:43:45.697 --> 00:43:48.899]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[00:43:48.899 --> 00:43:51.861]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:43:51.861 --> 00:43:52.661]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:44:01.255 --> 00:44:05.278]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:05.278 --> 00:44:08.521]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:08.521 --> 00:44:13.305]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:13.305 --> 00:44:19.710]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:21.952]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:44:22.492 --> 00:44:22.792]  Tim Geithner?
[00:44:22.792 --> 00:44:23.292]  Bernanke?
[00:44:23.292 --> 00:44:23.973]  They're arsonists!
[00:44:23.973 --> 00:44:25.253]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:25.253 --> 00:44:27.494]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:48.665]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:45:52.063 --> 00:45:52.563]  Thank you!
[00:45:59.534 --> 00:46:04.097]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:46:04.097 --> 00:46:04.997]  Number 1.
[00:46:04.997 --> 00:46:08.420]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:09.280]  Number 2.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:14.183]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:46:14.183 --> 00:46:14.924]  It's true.
[00:46:14.924 --> 00:46:19.787]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:46:19.787 --> 00:46:20.627]  Number 3.
[00:46:20.627 --> 00:46:24.210]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:27.912]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:46:28.112 --> 00:46:28.912]  Number 4.
[00:46:28.912 --> 00:46:31.653]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:46:31.653 --> 00:46:35.335]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:46:35.335 --> 00:46:36.135]  Number 5.
[00:46:36.135 --> 00:46:40.277]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:46:40.277 --> 00:46:45.339]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:46:45.339 --> 00:46:49.500]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.301]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:46:51.301 --> 00:46:55.903]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:46:56.203 --> 00:46:56.483]  877-327-0365.
[00:46:56.483 --> 00:47:02.686]  Coast to Coast.
[00:47:02.686 --> 00:47:04.747]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:04.747 --> 00:47:08.088]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:08.088 --> 00:47:17.452]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:17.452 --> 00:47:19.753]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:21.479 --> 00:47:34.223]  There's always a silver lining in every cloud, and the fact that world government's now being openly announced, we're told we're going to be owned by China and the private central banks, who are the second largest owner of, quote, our debt.
[00:47:34.223 --> 00:47:41.385]  We're taught constantly that it's debt that we owe, that we're lazy, even though Americans work more hours on average than anybody else in the world.
[00:47:42.285 --> 00:47:55.770]  The truth is, we could get rid of all the social security, all the entitlements, and it wouldn't pay off one one hundredth, and that's conservative, of the 1.5 quadrillion derivatives.
[00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:58.171]  They just feed people total baloney.
[00:47:58.171 --> 00:48:01.572]  And I gotta listen to liberal and conservative talk show hosts all over the country.
[00:48:01.572 --> 00:48:03.173]  They are just so ignorant.
[00:48:03.173 --> 00:48:06.894]  And they just regurgitate all this disinformation.
[00:48:06.894 --> 00:48:08.795]  The media lies by omission.
[00:48:08.795 --> 00:48:10.456]  Take the city of Austin.
[00:48:10.456 --> 00:48:11.176]  They have a budget.
[00:48:12.247 --> 00:48:16.870]  Now the budget is only about a third of the actual money and investments they've got.
[00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:23.435]  And the other stuff isn't secret, it's just in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report and isn't advertised.
[00:48:23.435 --> 00:48:34.023]  And boy, you bring up the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports to a mayor or somebody, they look at you like you, like you're a thousand feet tall and are breathing fire.
[00:48:34.023 --> 00:48:36.685]  They're like, you're not supposed to know about that.
[00:48:38.274 --> 00:48:40.615]  Because they've been investing in foreign banks.
[00:48:40.615 --> 00:48:42.055]  They bought them out.
[00:48:42.055 --> 00:48:43.816]  Criminals took over.
[00:48:43.816 --> 00:48:45.516]  Government is criminal now.
[00:48:45.516 --> 00:48:46.757]  That's what tyranny is.
[00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:49.698]  It takes over.
[00:48:49.698 --> 00:48:52.959]  There are over 180 nations worldwide.
[00:48:52.959 --> 00:48:57.580]  And sometimes those countries are being overturned in revolution every year or two.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:03.482]  But because the country is so corrupt in its history, it's never able to get out of the corruption, even when they get new leaders.
[00:49:04.932 --> 00:49:12.939]  So when I say in a radio ad for my film Fall of the Republic that hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century, it's actually thousands.
[00:49:12.939 --> 00:49:16.862]  Because in some countries they have overthrows every week!
[00:49:16.862 --> 00:49:18.243]  Multiple times every year!
[00:49:18.243 --> 00:49:19.364]  Look at Tunisia!
[00:49:19.364 --> 00:49:20.905]  Three different presidents in 48 hours!
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:28.265]  America has been special and I love it and we are such a blessed nation.
[00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:32.070]  There's still so much good left here, but we've got to protect it.
[00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:34.213]  We've got to breathe life back into it.
[00:49:34.213 --> 00:49:35.756]  We've got to rediscover it.
[00:49:35.756 --> 00:49:36.697]  Now, I want to move quick here.
[00:49:37.577 --> 00:49:37.697]  That's
[00:49:57.256 --> 00:50:09.580]  Processed of himself at a motel basically dressed as a woman in a g-string with the gun So what did I say last Sunday just off watching that Grim Reaper video of him and reading some of his writings?
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.041]  I said he thinks he's a woman.
[00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:21.484]  He's got multiple personalities He's into devil worship and taking hallucinogens the next day the voodoo shrine came out days later the drugs the hallucinogens every day came out look I
[00:50:23.263 --> 00:50:32.475]  I'm not that smart, but when you actually start studying history and criminology and get into knowledge, I don't know who's playing in the football games tonight.
[00:50:32.475 --> 00:50:33.376]  And I don't care.
[00:50:33.376 --> 00:50:35.879]  But I do know about the Supreme Court.
[00:50:37.006 --> 00:50:38.768]  I do know about criminology.
[00:50:38.768 --> 00:50:40.169]  I do know about stocks and bonds.
[00:50:40.169 --> 00:50:41.390]  I do know about gold.
[00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:42.771]  I do know about science.
[00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:44.292]  I'm into general knowledge.
[00:50:44.292 --> 00:50:47.174]  And let me tell you, my life is on fire.
[00:50:47.174 --> 00:50:50.957]  The globalists want you dumbed down and uninformed so they can feed on you.
[00:50:50.957 --> 00:50:52.078]  They count on that.
[00:50:52.078 --> 00:50:54.540]  You're just as smart as I am!
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.481]  Or smarter!
[00:50:55.481 --> 00:50:59.704]  Start valuing freedom!
[00:50:59.704 --> 00:51:01.586]  So, talk about a hoax blowing up.
[00:51:01.586 --> 00:51:04.128]  I told you it was a hoax less than 24 hours in last week.
[00:51:05.689 --> 00:51:07.070]  And now you learn it was a complete hoax.
[00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:10.172]  If you had to call him anything, it was a liberal.
[00:51:10.172 --> 00:51:13.493]  Long-haired, drug legalization type guy, not saying that's bad.
[00:51:13.493 --> 00:51:15.575]  I'm for decriminalization.
[00:51:15.575 --> 00:51:19.157]  That cuts off money of the drug dealers.
[00:51:19.157 --> 00:51:21.278]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:29.362]  But, you know, he was in love with Giffords, as I predicted, and was obsessed with her, as I predicted.
[00:51:29.362 --> 00:51:31.224]  And he was a complete schizophrenic.
[00:51:31.224 --> 00:51:33.285]  But they're still trying to demonize free speech.
[00:51:34.195 --> 00:51:36.837]  And they're still trying to use it to go after our free speech.
[00:51:36.837 --> 00:51:41.301]  And they're setting up the Homeland Security takeover of the web, the cyber security.
[00:51:41.301 --> 00:51:49.168]  They want the Fairness Doctrine, which is totally unfair, to shut down political editorializing or quote, opinion.
[00:51:49.168 --> 00:51:53.251]  You know, they're putting up face scanning cameras in the town where I live.
[00:51:53.251 --> 00:51:54.993]  I can't say it's Big Brother and I'm against it.
[00:51:54.993 --> 00:51:56.995]  And why don't you use it to arrest the illegal aliens?
[00:51:58.735 --> 00:51:59.975]  That would be editorializing.
[00:51:59.975 --> 00:52:03.557]  I could just say face-scanning cameras have gone up.
[00:52:03.557 --> 00:52:07.158]  That's not freedom in this country.
[00:52:07.158 --> 00:52:11.440]  But here's the big news, and Kurt Nemo wrote this story today.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:19.123]  It is up on InfoWars.com, and this story is just, just, just, I have no words to describe how big this is.
[00:52:19.123 --> 00:52:22.564]  It's in the Featured News section, second story down under.
[00:52:22.564 --> 00:52:24.725]  China says the end of the dollar is near.
[00:52:25.825 --> 00:52:33.427]  Wall Street Journal, AFP, confirms Stuxnet was false flag launched by Israel and U.S.
[00:52:33.427 --> 00:52:43.789]  And it has my video there from September, four months ago, headline, Stuxnet False Flag Launched for Web Takeover.
[00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:47.330]  Of course, I announced that two days into it.
[00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:50.051]  About a month in, they admitted it was the Israelis and the U.S.
[00:52:50.051 --> 00:52:50.891]  that did it.
[00:52:50.891 --> 00:52:53.652]  And now the New York Times officially admits
[00:52:56.021 --> 00:52:59.935]  Listen to me carefully, if you're a neocon listener and love war, this is not about Iran.
[00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:09.872]  In fact, I don't like attacking Iran, but if it stops the globalists from starting World War III, I am almost pleased by it.
[00:53:09.872 --> 00:53:16.434]  Because Hillary's out saying, we backed them off two years with this Stuxnet, and so now we don't have to attack.
[00:53:16.434 --> 00:53:17.374]  I don't believe that.
[00:53:17.374 --> 00:53:18.334]  It's all a fraud.
[00:53:18.334 --> 00:53:19.915]  They're not building nukes.
[00:53:19.915 --> 00:53:21.475]  The weapons inspectors have been in there.
[00:53:21.475 --> 00:53:25.696]  But regardless of what the truth is, good, let's not have World War III.
[00:53:25.696 --> 00:53:27.257]  But here's the big issue.
[00:53:28.442 --> 00:53:31.325]  Hidden in plain view is a massive story here.
[00:53:31.325 --> 00:53:33.928]  You're like, okay, what is it?
[00:53:33.928 --> 00:53:35.009]  Here's the New York Times.
[00:53:35.009 --> 00:53:42.376]  Israel test on worm called crucial in Iran nuclear delay, William J.
[00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:46.771]  Road and John Markoff.
[00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:48.052]  David Eastfanger.
[00:53:48.052 --> 00:53:49.852]  Big investigative report.
[00:53:49.852 --> 00:53:54.754]  Ooh, the New York Times is telling you that Israel and the U.S.
[00:53:54.754 --> 00:54:02.077]  at the Dimona giant nuclear complex in Israel, where they built their 600-plus nukes that aren't supposed to exist,
[00:54:04.956 --> 00:54:17.961]  They admitted here that they produced the Stuxnet and tested it with the US and Israel because they have the same Siemens German centrifuges which the Germans have certified can't get the uranium anywhere near bomb material.
[00:54:17.961 --> 00:54:29.246]  But the point is they tested them there and developed it to shut down the Iranian systems and then had people at point-blank with hard drives with thumb drives pump it directly into their computers.
[00:54:30.146 --> 00:54:33.152]  Within days of this happening, I said, watch!
[00:54:33.152 --> 00:54:41.306]  It's going to be Israel and the US, one and the same, and they're going to announce that they've got to have cyber security totally take over web freedom.
[00:54:42.426 --> 00:54:44.388]  I mean, you read the Cybersecurity Act.
[00:54:44.388 --> 00:54:50.474]  It says they're going to have compulsory national service for all high schoolers in cyber security brigades.
[00:54:50.474 --> 00:54:54.138]  That's Obama's national security force, just as big, just as strong as the U.S.
[00:54:54.138 --> 00:54:56.220]  military he called for.
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.822]  That it's going to be given trillions of dollars in the next decade.
[00:54:58.822 --> 00:55:05.349]  They're building multi-billion dollar facilities from Utah to Texas, from San Antonio to Salt Lake, from New York to Miami.
[00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:09.192]  Spying on everyone, attacking the web.
[00:55:09.192 --> 00:55:18.699]  I got all these Pentagon public admissions by Cyber Command they already have in place with the four branches that they're quote attacking bloggers they don't like in the U.S.
[00:55:18.699 --> 00:55:20.180]  learning how to shut down the web.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:26.885]  I mean this is a sinister free speech killing machine but here's the big 64 million dollar issue.
[00:55:28.134 --> 00:55:31.136]  Hidden in plain view, the U.S.
[00:55:31.136 --> 00:55:35.120]  and Israeli government launched this Stuxnet at Iran.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:50.272]  It bounces all over the world, comes back here, and a month after I predicted it, that it would bounce back as I talked to my IT people and looked into it, I said, you watch, they're going to say Stuxnet was launched by the Chinese and we've got to give up our web freedom.
[00:55:51.533 --> 00:55:58.239]  Because of the Stuxnet and let the government take over the web and it's our own stinking government that launched it.
[00:55:58.239 --> 00:56:01.862]  Our own government that said we got attacked at Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam.
[00:56:01.862 --> 00:56:04.684]  Our own government that staged all these other events.
[00:56:04.684 --> 00:56:06.606]  Folks, this is not our government.
[00:56:06.606 --> 00:56:13.051]  This is a group of ruthless criminals and America was so free for so long, we became so naive after World War II.
[00:56:14.333 --> 00:56:17.718]  That we believed our government was the boss and could do no wrong.
[00:56:17.718 --> 00:56:25.009]  We forgot what the founders had told us 170 years previous to World War II and we gave up the Republic.
[00:56:26.035 --> 00:56:29.357]  We gave up the Republic and we've been overrun.
[00:56:29.357 --> 00:56:31.718]  Listen, there's always criminals in society.
[00:56:31.718 --> 00:56:33.279]  There's always corrupt corporations.
[00:56:33.279 --> 00:56:36.941]  There's always bad people who want power and wealth and control.
[00:56:36.941 --> 00:56:41.243]  And if you don't have checks and balances there to block them, they will take over.
[00:56:41.243 --> 00:56:44.825]  It's a mathematical law of human activity.
[00:56:44.825 --> 00:56:46.406]  So, get this article.
[00:56:46.406 --> 00:56:48.187]  I mean, this is big news.
[00:56:48.187 --> 00:56:50.408]  I mean, do you agree with me out there, listeners?
[00:56:50.408 --> 00:56:51.169]  This is big news.
[00:56:52.455 --> 00:56:55.517]  They now admit in the New York Times, an interview with U.S.
[00:56:55.517 --> 00:57:01.900]  intelligence heads, that our government with Israel launched this Stuxnet against Iran?
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:02.880]  They're proud of it?
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:08.903]  While at the same time saying, give up your web freedom because the enemy launched a Stuxnet?
[00:57:08.903 --> 00:57:10.544]  I mean, this is insane!
[00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.430]  I think?
[00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:27.710]  We're good.
[00:57:50.325 --> 00:57:54.168]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[00:57:54.168 --> 00:57:58.431]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:57:58.431 --> 00:58:03.255]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:58:03.255 --> 00:58:09.080]  We're not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:16.225]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:24.383]  I'm looking for America.
[00:58:24.383 --> 00:58:26.024]  Wear American and be proud.
[00:58:26.024 --> 00:58:28.966]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:58:28.966 --> 00:58:33.248]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:58:33.248 --> 00:58:37.631]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:58:44.818 --> 00:58:50.402]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:58:50.402 --> 00:58:54.005]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:58:54.005 --> 00:58:55.126]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:58:55.126 --> 00:58:59.689]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:58:59.689 --> 00:59:05.633]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:59:05.633 --> 00:59:07.795]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:59:07.795 --> 00:59:10.457]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:59:10.817 --> 00:59:17.302]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:59:17.302 --> 00:59:19.523]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:59:19.523 --> 00:59:24.867]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:59:24.867 --> 00:59:30.151]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:59:30.151 --> 00:59:35.315]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:59:35.515 --> 00:59:38.696]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:59:38.696 --> 00:59:41.698]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:59:41.698 --> 00:59:42.458]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:59:42.458 --> 00:59:42.898]  Coast to Coast.
[00:59:42.898 --> 00:59:43.679]  Direct from Austin.
[00:59:43.679 --> 00:59:46.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:00.822 --> 01:00:03.563]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:03.563 --> 01:00:10.506]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:15.287]  We are now into hour number two, and if I seem frantic, I am.
[01:00:15.287 --> 01:00:19.249]  I mean, I'm pacing up and down in the morning and the evening with my wife.
[01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:23.530]  I'm moving out in the country because I know the society's collapsing.
[01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:25.531]  More and more they admit we're going into a depression.
[01:00:25.531 --> 01:00:28.052]  I know we've got totally ruthless, globalist running things.
[01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:31.514]  I mean, look at how much of what we've talked about has come true.
[01:00:31.514 --> 01:00:38.418]  The Chinese president announces that they want to get rid of the dollar as the world reserve currency and replace it with the Chinese currency.
[01:00:38.418 --> 01:00:41.279]  Exactly what we told you the Russians and the Chinese had planned.
[01:00:41.279 --> 01:00:44.441]  Our own elite have had this planned.
[01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:51.385]  And he's going to be with us until 45 after, and then no doubt I'm going to have him back up later in the week for an hour and a half, two hour interview.
[01:00:51.385 --> 01:00:54.827]  I just wanted to introduce Lindsey Williams to our Sunday audience.
[01:00:54.827 --> 01:00:56.769]  He's never been on with us on the Sunday.
[01:00:57.668 --> 01:01:17.873]  Broadcast I think we may have rebroadcast part of an interview with him once but this is his first live interview on the Sunday broadcast So I want to come back in the next segment and introduce him But remember he was on with us three months ago and Ken Frum was very ill and it told him he could start talking more about him That was the head of operations for Atlantic Richfield.
[01:01:17.873 --> 01:01:22.015]  The other guy was the actual CEO at another big oil company I know his name.
[01:01:22.015 --> 01:01:23.215]  I can't
[01:01:23.735 --> 01:01:25.216]  You know, I'll reveal that.
[01:01:25.216 --> 01:01:33.200]  But now, Lindsey can give you even more information from his meeting with the other living former CEO.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.882]  But what did the living CEO and the deathbed CEO, Ken Fromm, who died about a month ago, tell him?
[01:01:38.882 --> 01:01:44.845]  Well, three months ago, they both told Lindsey Williams that oil was going to be going from 60 roughly to 150 to 200 by the end of 2011.
[01:01:48.467 --> 01:01:52.192]  That starting from six months out, it would just accelerate.
[01:01:52.192 --> 01:01:53.834]  Well, look, that has already begun.
[01:01:53.834 --> 01:01:57.079]  In fact, Lindsey said it will start immediately, but you know, six months, run up 140, 150.
[01:01:57.079 --> 01:01:57.960]  After that, could go all the way to 200.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.762]  Lindsey's done this before with his source.
[01:02:04.611 --> 01:02:05.912]  Lindsey's done this before.
[01:02:05.912 --> 01:02:09.956]  So, Lindsey, we're about to go to break and come back to the full audience.
[01:02:09.956 --> 01:02:23.528]  Some stations don't carry this little five-minute segment, but you've got new information from the other living former oil company, Big Three CEO, that adds to this image you're putting together for us.
[01:02:24.361 --> 01:02:30.623]  Alex, I've been in communication with the gentleman who promised to give me information after Ken Farm died.
[01:02:30.623 --> 01:02:33.723]  I've had numerous communicators with him in the past week.
[01:02:33.723 --> 01:02:39.725]  The things he has told me that are about to take place, I am so glad that I can be with you all today.
[01:02:39.725 --> 01:02:42.786]  I must warn you as to what's about to happen.
[01:02:42.786 --> 01:02:43.946]  I plead with you.
[01:02:43.946 --> 01:02:45.226]  I beg of you.
[01:02:45.226 --> 01:02:48.047]  I'm going to go over the things, each one, one at a time.
[01:02:48.047 --> 01:02:50.848]  I plead with you to take immediate action, Alex.
[01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:57.112]  I'm trying to take immediate action, you know how slow things move, but I'm trying to protect myself individually.
[01:02:57.112 --> 01:03:06.560]  I want to recap, though, briefly, your history, what Ken Frum told you, those big predictions that we now see unfolding.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:13.045]  You know, I wish you were wrong, Lindsey, but all these years when you couldn't tell us their names, I knew the names.
[01:03:13.045 --> 01:03:18.309]  Dr. Monteith had called the men and confirmed it, and it's funny, it was hiding in plain view.
[01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.937]  Back in the early summer of 2008, you had
[01:03:28.246 --> 01:03:40.512]  Made your announcement, but then hiding in plain view, I noticed that a few weeks later we'd gone to Bilderberg to cover it, and Jim Tucker's source inside Bilderberg said oil's gonna go up to 150.
[01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:52.078]  And so separately, you basically are hitting Bilderberg-level sources, we're hitting our Bilderberg-level sources, and giving people that intel, and that shows just how much power these people have.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.581]  These people control the world.
[01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:56.062]  They tell the President what to do.
[01:03:56.062 --> 01:03:58.603]  They dictate to Congress what bills to pass.
[01:03:58.603 --> 01:04:13.972]  And, Alex, it was only by the providence of God that I had the privilege of living, living with these people for three years' time as the chaplain, invited to be their chaplain on the Pennsylvania pipeline, got to know some of them, and over the years they've told me these things.
[01:04:13.972 --> 01:04:15.472]  It's not Lindsey Williams.
[01:04:15.472 --> 01:04:16.433]  I am not a prophet.
[01:04:16.793 --> 01:04:35.104]  But these people tell me these things, and I give out the message exactly as they've told to me, and that's what you've been hearing time after time on your program, is what these elitists tell me personally, and I feel a moral obligation to warn the world, because very few people have the contact and the privilege of
[01:04:35.524 --> 01:04:36.205]  Pastor, stay there.
[01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:36.705]  Absolutely.
[01:04:36.705 --> 01:04:37.185]  One minute break.
[01:04:37.185 --> 01:04:38.706]  Coming right back to you.
[01:04:38.706 --> 01:04:39.427]  Recap that.
[01:04:39.427 --> 01:04:41.008]  Let's get into the new intel.
[01:04:59.167 --> 01:05:00.347]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:00.347 --> 01:05:07.269]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:07.269 --> 01:05:09.830]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:15.211]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:18.251]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:18.251 --> 01:05:20.312]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:20.552 --> 01:05:26.814]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:26.814 --> 01:05:30.195]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:30.195 --> 01:05:35.977]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:35.977 --> 01:05:37.618]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:37.618 --> 01:05:38.918]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:38.918 --> 01:05:41.579]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:41.579 --> 01:05:43.000]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.802]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:45.802 --> 01:06:07.360]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com That's End of America, the number 3.com Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com That's EndOfAmerica3.com What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.323]  Some men you just can't reach.
[01:06:11.288 --> 01:06:16.610]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:18.231]  Well, he gets it.
[01:06:18.231 --> 01:06:26.835]  I don't like it any more than you do.
[01:06:26.835 --> 01:06:29.456]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:29.456 --> 01:06:30.837]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:34.306 --> 01:06:35.407]  We are back live.
[01:06:35.407 --> 01:06:40.510]  We are now 6 minutes 37 seconds into the second hour.
[01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:42.951]  We do two hours here every Sunday evening, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:06:42.951 --> 01:06:44.492]  Central Standard Time.
[01:06:44.492 --> 01:06:50.475]  That's 5 to 7 Eastern, 2 to 4 Pacific, 3 to 5 Mountain.
[01:06:50.475 --> 01:06:54.357]  Websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:54.357 --> 01:07:00.461]  I want to direct PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, not just radio listeners, but for radio listeners, you can just go to Infowars.com
[01:07:02.731 --> 01:07:05.453]  Oil off on U.S.
[01:07:05.453 --> 01:07:09.337]  data, but OPEC eyes $100 in sight.
[01:07:09.337 --> 01:07:11.158]  That's out of Reuters.
[01:07:11.158 --> 01:07:12.179]  Here's another headline.
[01:07:12.179 --> 01:07:16.543]  Could oil reach $150 a barrel by late 2012?
[01:07:16.543 --> 01:07:22.128]  Well, actually, one of the head executives said by the end of this year it could hit.
[01:07:23.389 --> 01:07:25.951]  $150 a barrel.
[01:07:25.951 --> 01:07:28.273]  That was in Associated Press.
[01:07:28.273 --> 01:07:28.933]  Here's another one.
[01:07:28.933 --> 01:07:33.416]  Two oil executives predict much higher oil prices for the coming year.
[01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:35.497]  That's December 28th.
[01:07:35.497 --> 01:07:43.703]  Bloomberg reporting that OPEC is saying they're gonna hold production so that it basically comes out at $100 a barrel just in the next few months.
[01:07:43.703 --> 01:07:50.648]  Lindsey Williams worked on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline back in the 70s as a pastor.
[01:07:50.648 --> 01:07:51.508]  He also ran a
[01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:52.949]  We're good to go.
[01:08:17.871 --> 01:08:33.260]  And Pastor Williams then of course wrote a best-selling book, The Energy Non-Crisis, which decades later it's admitted that they know there's more oil in Alaska than Saudi Arabia and they just won't let us have it because the big oil cartels, not the environmentalists, the big oil cartels want to artificially keep the price high.
[01:08:34.324 --> 01:08:37.646]  Now, and they want to keep us independent.
[01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:48.171]  I mean, dependent on Chinese oil, not, and Middle Eastern oil, Chinese money, Chinese loans, Middle Eastern oil.
[01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:58.956]  And so, Lindsey now joins us to get into all of this and break it down because in the last three years on this show, he talked about
[01:09:00.475 --> 01:09:18.603]  Mr. Ken Fromm, who is the head of operations at Atlantic Richfield and a high-level globalist, and Fromm had been giving him a lot of intel over the years, and he told him back in the early summer of 2008 that oil would be going from $60 a barrel to $150, and it did exactly that.
[01:09:18.603 --> 01:09:21.324]  Then he told Lindsey, no, it's going to go down now.
[01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:24.826]  When the media was saying it was going to go up, it instantly began to go down about a month later.
[01:09:25.746 --> 01:09:26.126]  I don't know.
[01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:49.197]  I don't know.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.324]  There positively is a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world.
[01:10:13.324 --> 01:10:15.225]  Let me make it as emphatic as I possibly can.
[01:10:15.225 --> 01:10:16.065]  Now this past week,
[01:10:29.631 --> 01:10:32.554]  One of these individuals has been communicating with me.
[01:10:32.554 --> 01:10:44.446]  He has told me a number of things and I want to enumerate them one at a time because people in the listening audience, I am pleading with you to take immediate action in relation to this.
[01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:58.591]  Let's go over what he told you three months ago because dollar devaluation, oil going way up, I mean everything you talked about and then within a month all the other oil execs and people were saying it in public.
[01:10:58.591 --> 01:11:01.832]  So the point is, you're getting the real info here.
[01:11:01.832 --> 01:11:02.652]  This is not baloney.
[01:11:03.979 --> 01:11:15.107]  Over the past 35 years, these two individuals have given me information, and not one single time have they ever been incorrect on anything they've ever said.
[01:11:15.107 --> 01:11:24.354]  One of the items that is of most importance to you right now that he said to me back two years ago, he said, there will be no shortage of food and water.
[01:11:31.422 --> 01:11:32.082]  I know.
[01:11:32.082 --> 01:11:37.425]  It's a little different than what you're hearing on some shows, but I'm giving it to you from the elite themselves.
[01:11:37.425 --> 01:11:41.446]  But then he went on to say, you will not be able to buy it.
[01:11:41.446 --> 01:11:42.747]  And I asked him the question.
[01:11:42.747 --> 01:11:46.308]  I said, folks, I'm sure you've seen this at the grocery store.
[01:11:46.308 --> 01:11:47.228]  And I asked him why.
[01:11:47.228 --> 01:11:49.009]  I said, what are you talking about?
[01:11:49.009 --> 01:11:54.271]  He said, the grocery store shelves will free funerals, but you will go hungry.
[01:11:54.271 --> 01:11:57.972]  I just came back from the grocery store a few moments ago buying something for my family.
[01:12:00.073 --> 01:12:07.639]  In one week, the price of some toilet paper goods have gone up $3 in the Safeway.
[01:12:07.639 --> 01:12:17.147]  No, no, you said two years ago that food prices would double, and now I have the headlines, wheat and corn up by 50% just in the last six months.
[01:12:17.147 --> 01:12:21.691]  It's dollar devaluation, but the media won't tell anybody why this is happening.
[01:12:22.489 --> 01:12:25.951]  You've got, you must, I plead with you, gold.
[01:12:25.951 --> 01:12:27.852]  You do this immediately.
[01:12:27.852 --> 01:12:32.575]  You've got to get six months supply of food into your house immediately.
[01:12:32.575 --> 01:12:45.884]  The currency is devaluating so rapidly, and I was told this past week what's going to happen to the gold and silver market, and I've got the figures here in front of me, which I'm going to read you when we come to this next segment.
[01:12:46.284 --> 01:12:49.365]  And folks, the dollar is going down so rapidly.
[01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:56.006]  I was told, and I've told it on the Alex Jones Show numbers of times, by the end of 2012, the dollar will be dead.
[01:12:56.006 --> 01:12:59.026]  Now, Mr. Farm said that before he passed away.
[01:12:59.026 --> 01:13:03.307]  This new individual is confirming to me that they are on time.
[01:13:03.307 --> 01:13:07.848]  Their timeline is right where I was told it was going to be.
[01:13:07.848 --> 01:13:11.889]  They feel that the American people are waking up too rapidly.
[01:13:11.889 --> 01:13:14.029]  They may have to retreat just a little bit.
[01:13:14.529 --> 01:13:17.671]  But, they definitely are on target for what they want to do.
[01:13:17.671 --> 01:13:19.952]  Now, you're going to see it, first of all, at the grocery store.
[01:13:19.952 --> 01:13:21.513]  You're seeing it right now.
[01:13:21.513 --> 01:13:32.779]  And the dollar is devaluating so much that if you don't get six months supply of food in that house immediately, you probably will not be able to afford it because the dollar is going to be so worthless.
[01:13:32.779 --> 01:13:39.442]  And again, three months ago, three months ago, you told people when it was 60-something dollars a barrel that it was going to be going up.
[01:13:39.442 --> 01:13:40.763]  And look what happened, just like in 2008.
[01:13:42.324 --> 01:13:43.625]  You told me the same thing.
[01:13:43.625 --> 01:13:47.627]  They told me it was going from $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel.
[01:13:47.627 --> 01:13:49.028]  Alex, I went on your show.
[01:13:49.028 --> 01:13:53.091]  I almost had to apologize for what I was saying.
[01:13:53.091 --> 01:13:57.313]  People said you're crazy, you shouldn't say things like that on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:13:57.313 --> 01:14:01.036]  I did, and two months later it happened exactly as they had said it.
[01:14:01.036 --> 01:14:03.317]  Do you remember when you were paying $1.50 a gallon at the gas pump?
[01:14:05.098 --> 01:14:13.527]  And they told me, Alex, you heard me say this on your show, they said it's going to stay that way for two and one half years.
[01:14:13.527 --> 01:14:15.229]  Alex did not say that?
[01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:19.073]  Lindsey, all the interviews are archived, millions of views all over the web.
[01:14:19.073 --> 01:14:20.554]  You said with precision.
[01:14:21.443 --> 01:14:26.585]  It's going to go from $60 to $150 and it went to $149.
[01:14:26.585 --> 01:14:32.828]  Then, at its peak, you called and said, now they say it's going back down below $60.
[01:14:32.828 --> 01:14:34.729]  You said it's going to $40.
[01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:36.270]  Everybody laughed at you.
[01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:37.731]  I got made fun of.
[01:14:37.731 --> 01:14:40.592]  Within three months, it was below $100.
[01:14:40.592 --> 01:14:43.213]  Within six months, it was down to a few days below $40.
[01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:48.816]  I mean, so you didn't just say exactly how it would go up, exactly how it would go down.
[01:14:48.816 --> 01:14:59.681]  Now, your same source on his deathbed, he's dead now, three months ago, he died a month ago, said it's going 150, maybe even 200 in the next year.
[01:14:59.681 --> 01:15:03.142]  Now that's in the headlines, because I know who these men are.
[01:15:03.142 --> 01:15:11.446]  I can now say Ken Frum, former head of Atlantic Richfield, the other guy even more high-powered, I'll just call him Mr. L. Is that okay to say that?
[01:15:12.619 --> 01:15:14.680]  I'm telling you now where I have been told that it is going.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:19.341]  It is going to $150 to $200 a barrel in six to nine months unless the American people wake up too fast.
[01:15:38.607 --> 01:15:39.887]  Stay there, Lindsey Williams.
[01:15:39.887 --> 01:15:40.167]  More.
[01:15:40.167 --> 01:15:40.968]  They've given you new intel.
[01:15:40.968 --> 01:15:42.348]  You've talked to the other guy.
[01:16:00.626 --> 01:16:03.690]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.

[01:16:59.909 --> 01:17:04.452]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:17:04.452 --> 01:17:05.373]  Number 1.
[01:17:05.373 --> 01:17:08.796]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:17:08.796 --> 01:17:09.656]  Number 2.
[01:17:09.656 --> 01:17:14.540]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:15.300]  It's true.
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:20.164]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:17:20.164 --> 01:17:20.985]  Number 3.
[01:17:20.985 --> 01:17:24.587]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:17:24.587 --> 01:17:28.270]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:29.270]  Number 4.
[01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:32.031]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:17:32.031 --> 01:17:35.712]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:17:35.712 --> 01:17:36.492]  Number 5.
[01:17:36.492 --> 01:17:40.653]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:17:40.653 --> 01:17:45.694]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:49.875]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:51.655]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:17:51.655 --> 01:17:56.256]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:17:57.116 --> 01:18:01.000]  877-327-0365.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.024]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:18:05.024 --> 01:18:08.267]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:13.071]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:18:13.071 --> 01:18:19.457]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:18:19.457 --> 01:18:21.699]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:18:22.219 --> 01:18:22.539]  Tim Geithner?
[01:18:22.539 --> 01:18:23.039]  Bernanke?
[01:18:23.039 --> 01:18:23.720]  They're arsonists!
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.000]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.241]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:18:41.127 --> 01:18:48.412]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:18:48.412 --> 01:18:57.519]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:19:01.516 --> 01:19:05.477]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:19:05.477 --> 01:19:14.339]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:19:14.339 --> 01:19:18.960]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:29.782]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:19:30.402 --> 01:19:39.924]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:19:39.924 --> 01:19:45.346]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:19:45.346 --> 01:19:52.847]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:19:52.847 --> 01:19:55.588]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:20:01.317 --> 01:20:04.901]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:08.224]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:08.224 --> 01:20:14.050]  No one's gonna take me alive.
[01:20:30.065 --> 01:20:31.326]  We are back live.
[01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:37.411]  Pastor Lindsey Williams has made prediction after prediction accurately on this show.
[01:20:37.411 --> 01:20:44.376]  But as he'll tell you, he's just telling you what some high-level former CEOs are telling him.
[01:20:44.376 --> 01:20:47.018]  And globalists love being insiders.
[01:20:47.018 --> 01:20:53.343]  They love having the info that the general public doesn't because they make incredible profits because of it.
[01:20:54.437 --> 01:21:03.028]  I mean, I remember reading even public globalist reports about, well, we'll devalue the global currencies and it will cause commodities to go up like gold and oil.
[01:21:03.028 --> 01:21:07.754]  And then I'm not a rocket scientist, but I know to then tell folks get into gold and silver and look where it's gone.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.803]  I told you to get into silver when it was $5 an ounce.
[01:21:11.803 --> 01:21:12.563]  Now it's right up at $30.
[01:21:12.563 --> 01:21:16.326]  I told you to get into gold when it was $216 an ounce.
[01:21:16.326 --> 01:21:17.407]  Now it's at $1,400.
[01:21:17.407 --> 01:21:23.192]  I mean, these are laws of economics for thousands of years.
[01:21:23.192 --> 01:21:27.956]  And the mainstream media, when it tells you something that's different, it's not because they're stupid.
[01:21:27.956 --> 01:21:30.118]  They're lying to you like you're chumps.
[01:21:31.650 --> 01:21:40.774]  I mean, I don't care if it's John Wayne's family, a big part of his family, or billionaire folks that are well-known that I've talked to.
[01:21:40.774 --> 01:21:52.459]  I mean, all the people I've talked to, or powerful people I know that have talked to others, or then all the mainstream news articles about the wealthy, starting four years ago, fleeing the country.
[01:21:52.459 --> 01:21:55.280]  Because they know they set up the Glass-Steagall Act.
[01:21:56.337 --> 01:21:56.457]  The
[01:22:14.617 --> 01:22:17.558]  Is that if we wake up, they can't get away with it.
[01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:19.159]  So they're always gauging.
[01:22:19.159 --> 01:22:20.319]  They're always gauging.
[01:22:20.319 --> 01:22:26.001]  I remember 2009, Bilderberg, the intel came out that they were going to start lowering prices because folks were so mad.
[01:22:26.001 --> 01:22:31.143]  I remember the 2006, the sources were they're going to pop the real estate bubble.
[01:22:31.143 --> 01:22:34.444]  They're going to call it a bailout, start global devaluation.
[01:22:34.444 --> 01:22:36.765]  That was from our Bilderberg source via Daniel Estelin.
[01:22:38.294 --> 01:22:41.897]  I mean, this is real information, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:41.897 --> 01:22:48.162]  And what do you make of the Chinese president announcing that the days of the dollar as the world reserve currency are over?
[01:22:48.162 --> 01:22:49.643]  Lindsey Williams, you've got the floor.
[01:22:49.643 --> 01:23:05.657]  Break down your statement on that, the other things that both the living CEO told you, and on the deathbed admissions of Mr. Frum, and then talking to the big Mr. X, who's still alive, the new incredible info.
[01:23:05.657 --> 01:23:07.118]  He's giving you more info, Lindsey.
[01:23:08.012 --> 01:23:15.513]  With new information as of this past week, Alex, I must warn all of your listening audiences, I plead with you.
[01:23:15.513 --> 01:23:18.314]  Okay, I'm going to begin with the first one right now.
[01:23:18.314 --> 01:23:19.414]  This is so important.
[01:23:19.414 --> 01:23:21.615]  Gold and silver.
[01:23:21.615 --> 01:23:31.697]  I came on the Alex Jones Show two and a half years ago, and I said that I had just talked with the elitist friend of mine, and I said at that time you could buy gold for $700, $800 an ounce.
[01:23:33.897 --> 01:23:35.098]  And I pleaded with you.
[01:23:35.098 --> 01:23:35.958]  I begged you.
[01:23:35.958 --> 01:23:45.021]  I almost got on my knees over the radio program and said, you've got to go and protect your family because this individual said to me, I was flabbergasted.
[01:23:45.021 --> 01:23:51.404]  I was literally beside myself one day on the telephone when he told me all the things that they had in store.
[01:23:51.404 --> 01:23:52.784]  And you'll remember what they were.
[01:23:52.784 --> 01:23:55.485]  He said, within two years, you'll not recognize America.
[01:23:55.485 --> 01:23:57.006]  After two years, you'll be so poor.
[01:23:57.506 --> 01:23:59.107]  You won't be able to do anything about it.
[01:23:59.107 --> 01:24:01.629]  He kept on using the expression two years.
[01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:11.876]  And I came on the Alex Jones Show and told you that I had asked him, all right, in light of what you've just told me, what can I do to protect my dinner table, my wife and my son?
[01:24:11.876 --> 01:24:13.557]  I've got to do something.
[01:24:13.557 --> 01:24:17.960]  And he said to me, he said, Chaplain, there's only one way you're going to protect yourself.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.901]  He said, you can't trust real estate.
[01:24:19.901 --> 01:24:23.043]  He said, you can't trust anything that's written on a piece of paper.
[01:24:23.043 --> 01:24:26.566]  He said, there's only one thing you can trust, and that is our currency.
[01:24:26.926 --> 01:24:29.208]  And I said, what is your currency?
[01:24:29.208 --> 01:24:31.429]  He said, gold and silver.
[01:24:31.429 --> 01:24:33.471]  And he told me where it was going.
[01:24:33.471 --> 01:24:39.115]  He told me it was going right to where you see it go right now, and you haven't seen anything yet.
[01:24:39.115 --> 01:24:46.480]  And I came on the Alex Jones Show back when you could buy gold for $700 an ounce, and I pleaded with you, and I begged you.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.661]  We're good to go.
[01:25:07.797 --> 01:25:10.099]  And you haven't seen anything.
[01:25:10.099 --> 01:25:17.063]  This past week, it was made plain to me that gold and silver is going through the roof.
[01:25:17.063 --> 01:25:18.164]  I must give it to you right now.
[01:25:18.164 --> 01:25:19.145]  Here it is.
[01:25:19.145 --> 01:25:24.548]  I need to start, first of all, with what happened one week ago with the ComEx Silver Exchange.
[01:25:24.548 --> 01:25:28.551]  Now please, those of you who may not be familiar with this, very briefly,
[01:25:28.871 --> 01:25:39.549]  Well, the giant mints are all running out of silver right now because the real silver market is much higher than the paper silver market that they've been suppressing.
[01:25:39.549 --> 01:25:39.970]  But go ahead.
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:41.240]  It's happening.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.721]  It's happening right now.
[01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:48.363]  And I was warned by my elitist friend this past week, and I'm going to tell you where it's going.
[01:25:48.363 --> 01:25:53.766]  The Comic Silver Exchange holds gold and silver for the super-wealthy of the world.
[01:25:53.766 --> 01:25:54.986]  They hold it for China.
[01:25:54.986 --> 01:25:56.647]  They hold it for Russia.
[01:25:56.647 --> 01:25:59.168]  And they give them a piece of paper saying we have it in our vault.
[01:25:59.608 --> 01:26:10.350]  They announced a week ago that on hand they have 107 million ounces, but they have contractual obligations in the amount of 720 million ounces, and it happened.
[01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:13.671]  Alex, it happened one week ago.
[01:26:13.671 --> 01:26:15.691]  1-7-11.
[01:26:15.691 --> 01:26:16.772]  It happened.
[01:26:16.772 --> 01:26:22.533]  There were four individuals who had gotten wind of all of this that are super wealthy people.
[01:26:22.533 --> 01:26:24.833]  They are not dealers.
[01:26:24.833 --> 01:26:25.754]  They withdrew.
[01:26:25.754 --> 01:26:27.254]  Four different people withdrew.
[01:26:28.234 --> 01:26:29.154]  We're good to go.
[01:26:49.464 --> 01:26:58.690]  This is an all-time record for any month in all of history.
[01:26:58.690 --> 01:27:05.915]  Something very scary is going on out there, Alex, because in the first 12 days... Folks, are you getting this?
[01:27:05.915 --> 01:27:11.899]  In the first 12 days of the month of January, the US Met announced
[01:27:12.359 --> 01:27:14.020]  No, no, that was the headline!
[01:27:27.489 --> 01:27:43.068]  Record silver sales, record physical silver sales, and now a federal judge has ordered the private Federal Reserve to turn over gold and silver documents where they've now been caught artificially suppressing the price with paper or naked shorting.
[01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:47.118]  Better than silver is going through the roof.
[01:27:47.118 --> 01:27:48.499]  It would not surprise me.
[01:27:48.499 --> 01:27:51.461]  Now, I did not, my elitist friend did not say this.
[01:27:51.461 --> 01:28:03.130]  I'm predicting personally, based on what I've been told in the past week's time, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if silver was not $50 an ounce by February the 1st.
[01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:05.752]  Okay, but let's go back, let's go back though, Lindsey.
[01:28:05.752 --> 01:28:08.074]  Let's go back to what the new stuff he did tell you.
[01:28:08.074 --> 01:28:09.635]  I mean, what did he specifically say?
[01:28:09.635 --> 01:28:11.016]  Was it on the silver?
[01:28:11.016 --> 01:28:11.997]  Or what were the other issues?
[01:28:11.997 --> 01:28:12.658]  What's the new stuff?
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:18.043]  Yeah, he did deal with gold and silver and pointed out the fact of what's happening.
[01:28:18.043 --> 01:28:25.007]  And the ComEx Silver Exchange is madly rushing to try to find every ounce of silver it can find in the world.
[01:28:25.007 --> 01:28:26.888]  And as a result, prices are going up.
[01:28:26.888 --> 01:28:28.249]  I'll go to the second item.
[01:28:28.249 --> 01:28:29.590]  The next item is food.
[01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:31.211]  Oh, this is so important.
[01:28:31.651 --> 01:28:39.718]  As you remember, I told you earlier that Mr. Fromm had said to me some while back about what is based in relation to food.
[01:28:39.718 --> 01:28:47.324]  And then I told you, back about two years ago, there'll be no shortage of the grocery store shelves, but you won't be able to afford it.
[01:28:47.324 --> 01:28:48.405]  Alright, Lindsey, stay there.
[01:28:48.405 --> 01:28:50.987]  Let's come back and get into the food situation.
[01:28:50.987 --> 01:28:55.270]  The new intel you got from this globalist insider who's inside the inner circle.
[01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:57.232]  PrisonPlanet.tv and FullWars.com.
[01:28:57.232 --> 01:28:57.993]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:00.558 --> 01:29:01.719]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:29:01.719 --> 01:29:08.663]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:29:08.663 --> 01:29:11.205]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:29:11.205 --> 01:29:16.589]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:29:16.589 --> 01:29:19.631]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:29:19.631 --> 01:29:21.692]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:29:21.952 --> 01:29:28.196]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:31.578]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:29:31.578 --> 01:29:37.361]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:29:37.361 --> 01:29:39.002]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:29:39.002 --> 01:29:40.303]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:29:40.303 --> 01:29:42.964]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:29:42.964 --> 01:29:44.385]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:29:44.645 --> 01:29:46.988]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:00.609 --> 01:30:04.191]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:30:04.191 --> 01:30:05.312]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:30:05.312 --> 01:30:09.875]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:30:09.875 --> 01:30:15.819]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:30:15.819 --> 01:30:17.980]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:20.642]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:30:21.002 --> 01:30:27.507]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[01:30:27.507 --> 01:30:29.708]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:30:29.708 --> 01:30:35.052]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:30:35.052 --> 01:30:40.336]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[01:30:40.336 --> 01:30:45.500]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:48.882]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[01:30:48.882 --> 01:30:51.864]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:30:51.864 --> 01:30:52.664]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:30:59.844 --> 01:31:04.386]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.386 --> 01:31:05.307]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.307 --> 01:31:08.729]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:08.729 --> 01:31:09.589]  Number 2.
[01:31:09.589 --> 01:31:14.472]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.472 --> 01:31:15.212]  It's true.
[01:31:15.212 --> 01:31:20.095]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.095 --> 01:31:20.915]  Number 3.
[01:31:20.915 --> 01:31:24.497]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.497 --> 01:31:28.199]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.399 --> 01:31:29.200]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.963]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:31.963 --> 01:31:35.647]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.647 --> 01:31:36.448]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.448 --> 01:31:40.593]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.593 --> 01:31:45.358]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:45.638 --> 01:31:49.804]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:49.804 --> 01:31:51.607]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.607 --> 01:31:53.850]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:32:01.379 --> 01:32:04.742]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[01:32:04.742 --> 01:32:09.966]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[01:32:09.966 --> 01:32:13.409]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[01:32:13.409 --> 01:32:15.751]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:32:16.391 --> 01:32:19.914]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[01:32:19.914 --> 01:32:21.055]  Take my word for it.
[01:32:21.055 --> 01:32:23.698]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:32:23.698 --> 01:32:30.223]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:32:30.223 --> 01:32:33.166]  Buy American and stay clean, as well as support InfoWars.

[01:32:58.029 --> 01:33:01.472]  Thank you.
[01:33:01.472 --> 01:33:02.993]  Coast to Coast.
[01:33:02.993 --> 01:33:05.054]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.054 --> 01:33:08.276]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:14.244 --> 01:33:16.367]  This is our final segment with Lindsey Williams.
[01:33:16.367 --> 01:33:24.820]  He's going to be back with us in the third hour on Wednesday at one o'clock central and we'll have more time to get into more detail on all of this.
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:27.985]  But Lindsey just kind of freaked me out during the break because
[01:33:28.908 --> 01:33:29.949]  I've done my research.
[01:33:29.949 --> 01:33:31.409]  I've called these people separately.
[01:33:31.409 --> 01:33:35.111]  So did Dr. Monteith years ago, but we couldn't tell you who these elitists were.
[01:33:35.111 --> 01:33:37.012]  People were like, oh, sure, Lindsey.
[01:33:37.012 --> 01:33:41.054]  But then as they saw more and more things come true, you know, the credibility exploded.
[01:33:41.054 --> 01:33:47.297]  And now he's told you Ken Fromm, because he was authorized to give Ken's name out, the former head of Atlantic Richfield, after he died.
[01:33:48.371 --> 01:33:48.531]  I don't
[01:34:07.043 --> 01:34:11.846]  Because I know we've had Rolling Stone here interviewing us and Nightline and MSNBC.
[01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:12.867]  I mean, you know, we are big.
[01:34:12.867 --> 01:34:14.728]  We reach millions of people a day.
[01:34:14.728 --> 01:34:20.371]  But that really creeped me out when you told me that they are specifically upset about Mr. Jones.
[01:34:20.371 --> 01:34:22.432]  Tell me exactly what Mr. X told you.
[01:34:24.622 --> 01:34:31.345]  Well, within the past week's time, I have had probably, I think, five different communicators from this individual.
[01:34:31.345 --> 01:34:36.787]  And Alex, you asked me, you told me I could say it, so I will.
[01:34:36.787 --> 01:34:38.007]  They are upset over you.
[01:34:38.007 --> 01:34:40.968]  I mean, they are very concerned.
[01:34:40.968 --> 01:34:43.789]  You are reaching masses of people, Alex.
[01:34:43.789 --> 01:34:50.892]  You definitely are putting a major emphasis on things that they don't necessarily like to be touched.
[01:34:51.392 --> 01:35:04.222]  And in one of these communicators this past week, they mentioned the fact that so much difference is being made in the minds of the American people, and a lot of it because of you, that they've got a problem on their hands.
[01:35:04.222 --> 01:35:05.983]  And they don't know exactly what to do with it.
[01:35:05.983 --> 01:35:07.905]  They've got a problem with the President.
[01:35:07.905 --> 01:35:10.727]  And they also have a problem with you.
[01:35:10.727 --> 01:35:11.748]  And as a result,
[01:35:12.949 --> 01:35:14.950]  They may have to make a back step.
[01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:20.295]  You see, there's only a handful of them, and yet they know there are millions of us out there.
[01:35:20.295 --> 01:35:25.179]  And if the American public begins to wake up too fast, well, you're waking them up too.
[01:35:25.179 --> 01:35:38.070]  And whenever one of these individuals actually mentions you and what you're doing, I know it was kind of like back two years ago when the individual contacted me and said, Lindsey, you're saying too much.
[01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:39.311]  You better back up a little bit.
[01:35:39.311 --> 01:35:40.732]  We'll never contact you yet.
[01:35:41.312 --> 01:35:57.463]  But you positively are making an impact on America, and folks, you've got to listen to everything you hear Alex Jones say every day, because the elite know he's out there, and they know that the American people are waking up because of it, so... Well, Lindsey, let me just throw this in briefly.
[01:35:57.463 --> 01:36:04.268]  I mean, more than even that, I need people's prayers, as you know, Pastor, and I passed the point of no return a long time ago.
[01:36:04.268 --> 01:36:05.069]  I am committed.
[01:36:05.729 --> 01:36:11.705]  I actually over the years have been approached by networks and people basically, you know, to sell out.
[01:36:13.915 --> 01:36:18.177]  And, but I mean, I can't sell out all my children and my family.
[01:36:18.177 --> 01:36:24.820]  I mean, I would never sell out because I'm a good guy, but I mean, if it was like Boss Hogg wanting me to sell out, I mean, that's one thing.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:30.022]  These people are really wicked and really evil and really hurt children and whole countries.
[01:36:30.022 --> 01:36:33.283]  I'm not going to have my soul and who I am tied up with them.
[01:36:33.283 --> 01:36:34.384]  There's no way.
[01:36:34.384 --> 01:36:36.405]  So it's not hard for me to not sell out.
[01:36:36.405 --> 01:36:38.846]  I am completely opposed to them.
[01:36:39.346 --> 01:36:45.793]  I mean, if it was like, here's a whole bunch of power and money for little stuff, but see, that's how it starts, you know, I might be tempted.
[01:36:45.793 --> 01:36:48.556]  I'm not even tempted, even at the point of threats.
[01:36:48.556 --> 01:36:55.945]  But if they do kill me, it underlines everything I've said, it highlights everything I've said, it puts exclamation points at the end.
[01:36:55.945 --> 01:36:57.226]  But I do hope listeners know...
[01:36:58.274 --> 01:36:59.315]  We're almost out of time here.
[01:36:59.315 --> 01:37:01.156]  I can't wait till Wednesday.
[01:37:01.156 --> 01:37:03.258]  We'll have you on for two hours, Lindsey, if you can do it.
[01:37:03.258 --> 01:37:08.102]  I know you've agreed to come on, but hopefully we can do two hours with you because there's so much to talk about.
[01:37:08.102 --> 01:37:11.425]  But you bring up an issue like this.
[01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:16.409]  I mean, all of us are in this together, and I've talked to a lot of high-powered people as well.
[01:37:16.409 --> 01:37:17.610]  They don't like what's going on.
[01:37:17.610 --> 01:37:20.993]  I mean, I've talked to people worth $500 million, a billion dollars.
[01:37:20.993 --> 01:37:23.395]  I've talked to super high-powered people.
[01:37:23.395 --> 01:37:25.596]  They're scared too, but they say, well, what do you do?
[01:37:26.437 --> 01:37:28.639]  Well, people need to just say no to this.
[01:37:28.639 --> 01:37:30.962]  We don't have to have World War III.
[01:37:30.962 --> 01:37:33.124]  We don't have to have total depression.
[01:37:33.124 --> 01:37:35.366]  We don't have to have environmental carbon taxes.
[01:37:35.366 --> 01:37:37.428]  We don't have to do it.
[01:37:37.428 --> 01:37:44.295]  But, Lindsey, we're almost out of time, and I know you never even want to plug this stuff, but I'm going to plug it, because over the years, you've put out the book, you've got
[01:37:45.596 --> 01:37:48.018]  The website, reformation.org.
[01:37:48.018 --> 01:37:51.780]  You've got six DVDs in the last three years covering all of this.
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:56.803]  You've got the two new CDs, The Voices of the Elite, with all the latest information.
[01:37:56.803 --> 01:37:58.724]  It's all available at prophecyclub.com.
[01:37:58.724 --> 01:38:00.605]  Those great folks are putting this out for you.
[01:38:00.605 --> 01:38:04.807]  Prophecyclub.com or 888-799-6111.
[01:38:04.807 --> 01:38:12.812]  But in closing, and then we'll talk to you again, I'm coming back with this public service breakdown on the poisons that are in the water via the fluoride.
[01:38:13.273 --> 01:38:16.145]  Briefly, what is he saying about food?
[01:38:16.145 --> 01:38:17.250]  How much is it going to go up?
[01:38:18.123 --> 01:38:20.364]  Food is going to go up very rapidly.
[01:38:20.364 --> 01:38:25.687]  You are going to be paying exorbitant prices, but yet the grocery store shelves will be full.
[01:38:25.687 --> 01:38:32.431]  There are positively 12 things that you must do immediately, and I've added a new one to them.
[01:38:32.431 --> 01:38:34.172]  I'm calling it 13 things now.
[01:38:34.172 --> 01:38:37.033]  You must prepare your family's medical needs.
[01:38:37.033 --> 01:38:39.755]  Now, I'm going to touch on this on your program this week.
[01:38:39.755 --> 01:38:43.877]  Oh, folks, please, you've got to know what the elite have in mind.
[01:38:43.877 --> 01:38:45.278]  They have a cure for cancer.
[01:38:47.239 --> 01:38:55.063]  Well, I mean, what's even crazier about all of this is they're also trying to set up these death panels.
[01:38:55.063 --> 01:38:58.565]  They're trying to socialize health care.
[01:38:58.565 --> 01:39:03.507]  But I really want to get into this whole dollar devaluation, the food situation, all of it.
[01:39:03.507 --> 01:39:06.969]  Lindsey Williams, when we talk again, let me say bye to you during this break.
[01:39:06.969 --> 01:39:11.431]  I'm going to put you on hold because we're about to go to break here.
[01:39:11.431 --> 01:39:12.852]  Well, actually, we're going to break in a few minutes.
[01:39:15.031 --> 01:39:25.687]  Lindsey, specifically on the food though, because when you say they may take a back step, we're already seeing oil race up, but then the EU and others started freaking out.
[01:39:25.687 --> 01:39:27.530]  I mean, Lindsey, what do you see happening?
[01:39:28.649 --> 01:39:33.852]  Well, it has grown up six cents a gallon right here where I live in the past week.
[01:39:33.852 --> 01:39:42.197]  You are going to see this same progression continue right on through for the next six to nine months until it gets to four to five dollars a gallon.
[01:39:42.197 --> 01:39:49.421]  As far as food is concerned, you are going to see escalating food costs as you have never seen before, not because there's a lack of food.
[01:39:50.141 --> 01:39:52.583]  Not supply and demand.
[01:39:52.583 --> 01:40:07.231]  This is going to merely be because the dollar is devaluating so quickly, and you watch crude oil prices, and you will know the devaluation of the dollar and the progression of the elite program as to exactly where they are.
[01:40:07.231 --> 01:40:11.754]  And when you see silver prices going on up the way they are in the next few weeks,
[01:40:12.234 --> 01:40:15.277]  You likewise know that it's not the silver that's going up.
[01:40:15.277 --> 01:40:27.208]  If the dollar is devaluating, regardless of what the Federal Reserve says, they're going into their... They really have escalated their program.
[01:40:27.208 --> 01:40:31.873]  The Federal Reserve now is borrowing $100 billion every 30 days just to handle...
[01:40:32.814 --> 01:40:33.575]  I think so.
[01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:48.111]  Absolutely!
[01:40:48.111 --> 01:40:48.832]  Look, look, we already...
[01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:06.050]  We're good to go.
[01:41:21.386 --> 01:41:24.587]  No to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of England.
[01:41:24.587 --> 01:41:25.587]  It's us or them.
[01:41:25.587 --> 01:41:29.308]  They plan to implode society, to consolidate power and control.
[01:41:29.308 --> 01:41:30.948]  We need to stand up and say no.
[01:41:30.948 --> 01:41:33.188]  Lindsey, we're going to break here in a moment.
[01:41:33.188 --> 01:41:35.089]  I want to talk to you during the break, so please don't leave us.
[01:41:35.089 --> 01:41:41.150]  We're going to have Lindsey on for an hour, hour and a half, maybe even two hours, coming up on the weekday show on Wednesday.
[01:41:41.150 --> 01:41:43.551]  The show is 11 to 2, but we go into overdrive a lot of days.
[01:41:43.551 --> 01:41:48.232]  11 to 3, it's all simulcast as well at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:41:48.232 --> 01:41:49.892]  And yes, this is scary information.
[01:41:50.732 --> 01:41:56.436]  But it's better to know that these bad things are going on than to not know.
[01:41:56.436 --> 01:42:03.601]  The analogy is, if there's a field and there's a bunch of pits in it with spikes at the bottom that could kill you, you gotta walk through that field.
[01:42:03.601 --> 01:42:07.764]  Is it better to know there are pits out there at night or to not be told about it?
[01:42:07.764 --> 01:42:13.708]  Out of sight, out of mind, positive thinking doesn't work when you're dealing with hardcore dangers.
[01:42:13.708 --> 01:42:14.589]  Now, when we come back,
[01:42:16.052 --> 01:42:32.279]  This video is up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and when you're listening on the radio and you hear me making claims, everything I say on the video is mainstream news, government documents, and links on the video screen to the government documents.
[01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:40.362]  When I tell you they're putting radioactive isotopes by design in the water to sterilize you, I have where they're doing it and where they admit they're doing it to sterilize you.
[01:42:41.042 --> 01:42:42.404]  That's big news, isn't it?
[01:42:42.404 --> 01:42:44.327]  Yeah, this government's totally criminal.
[01:42:44.327 --> 01:42:46.449]  They're eugenicists, scientists.
[01:42:46.449 --> 01:42:48.031]  They believe they're saving the Earth.
[01:42:48.031 --> 01:42:49.393]  Or themselves.
[01:42:49.393 --> 01:42:54.539]  When you hear about the fluoride, when you hear about all of this, it's all documented, and it's up at InfoWars.com.
[01:42:54.539 --> 01:42:56.522]  Get the video, get it out to everybody.
[01:42:56.522 --> 01:42:57.043]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:00.731 --> 01:43:03.773]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.

[01:44:00.330 --> 01:44:03.913]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:44:03.913 --> 01:44:05.215]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:44:05.215 --> 01:44:09.599]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:44:09.599 --> 01:44:15.544]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:44:15.544 --> 01:44:17.706]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:44:17.706 --> 01:44:20.389]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:44:20.729 --> 01:44:27.234]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.

[01:44:29.435 --> 01:44:34.779]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:44:34.779 --> 01:44:40.063]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.

[01:44:59.693 --> 01:45:03.536]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.

[01:45:12.523 --> 01:45:18.468]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:45:18.468 --> 01:45:22.131]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:45:22.131 --> 01:45:25.674]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:45:28.252 --> 01:45:33.779]  I'm looking for America.
[01:45:33.779 --> 01:45:35.741]  We're American and be proud.
[01:45:35.741 --> 01:45:38.024]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:45:38.024 --> 01:45:42.530]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:46.414]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:45:54.204 --> 01:45:58.784]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:03.943]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:46:03.943 --> 01:46:04.863]  Number 1.
[01:46:04.863 --> 01:46:08.286]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:46:08.286 --> 01:46:09.146]  Number 2.
[01:46:09.146 --> 01:46:14.029]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:46:14.029 --> 01:46:14.770]  It's true.
[01:46:14.770 --> 01:46:19.653]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:46:19.653 --> 01:46:20.473]  Number 3.
[01:46:20.473 --> 01:46:24.056]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:46:24.056 --> 01:46:27.758]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:46:27.958 --> 01:46:28.758]  Number 4.
[01:46:28.758 --> 01:46:31.519]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:46:31.519 --> 01:46:35.200]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:35.980]  Number 5.
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:40.121]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:46:40.121 --> 01:46:45.182]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:46:45.182 --> 01:46:49.363]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:46:49.363 --> 01:46:51.143]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:46:56.084 --> 01:46:56.324]  877-327-0365.
[01:46:56.324 --> 01:47:03.049]  Coast to Coast.
[01:47:03.049 --> 01:47:05.110]  Direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.110 --> 01:47:12.195]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:12.195 --> 01:47:18.220]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:20.762]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:38.353 --> 01:47:41.115]  Hello friends, thank you for watching.
[01:47:41.115 --> 01:47:43.616]  This is an extremely important video.
[01:47:43.616 --> 01:47:51.921]  This is something that you can immediately take control of in your life that will massively give you and your family improved health benefits.
[01:47:51.921 --> 01:48:05.029]  I've done deep, deep research and I've interviewed brain surgeons and scientists like Dr. Russell Blaylock, top chemists and toxicologists like Dr. Paul Conant, and just countless others.
[01:48:05.029 --> 01:48:05.330]  I've had
[01:48:06.010 --> 01:48:33.838]  The former heads of the EPA union and the FDA unions in the last 11 years, who since 2000 have had tens of thousands of their members in their unions, scientists, send letters and petitions to the government saying, we know sodium fluoride is at least doubling bone cancer in the general public and more than doubling it in men.
[01:48:33.838 --> 01:48:34.338]  We know
[01:48:34.958 --> 01:48:35.398]  That's right.
[01:48:56.816 --> 01:49:02.000]  And then other branches of the federal government came out and said, you know what?
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:13.868]  You don't want to give babies in their baby formula that you mix up, or their cereal, their rice cereal, you don't want to give them fluoride tap water.
[01:49:13.868 --> 01:49:19.733]  But then you go to the baby store, I have three children, three small children, you go to the baby store and it's
[01:49:20.902 --> 01:49:27.209]  Five, six, seven brands, all the brands of water, bottled water, say fluoride for babies.
[01:49:27.209 --> 01:49:29.471]  Fluoride, nursery water, what they need.
[01:49:29.471 --> 01:49:39.522]  And I'm going, well wait, they've said for six years they admit it's hurting their brains, it's hurting their teeth, it's causing dental fluorosis, before the teeth have emerged, what's going on?
[01:49:39.522 --> 01:49:41.044]  And then I see,
[01:49:42.305 --> 01:49:45.287]  Children's toothpaste that they're targeting two-year-olds with.
[01:49:45.287 --> 01:49:48.208]  It's got Spider-Man on it, or Superman, or Batman.
[01:49:48.208 --> 01:49:50.529]  I mean, it's got Papa Smurf, you name it.
[01:49:50.529 --> 01:49:52.770]  And it's sodium fluoride for kids.
[01:49:52.770 --> 01:49:58.814]  It says on the back, if you swallow even a pea-size of this called Poison Control, everybody knows kids eat toothpaste.
[01:49:58.814 --> 01:50:02.715]  I've got organic for mine, and my kids, you know, especially the little ones, are always trying to eat it.
[01:50:02.715 --> 01:50:06.878]  And so, with horror, I sit here and I warn people, and we have the studies.
[01:50:06.878 --> 01:50:08.979]  We have the admissions.
[01:50:10.137 --> 01:50:17.684]  And then something wild happened last week on the seventh day of January 2011.
[01:50:17.684 --> 01:50:19.566]  Something amazing happened.
[01:50:19.566 --> 01:50:30.477]  All of a sudden, the CDC put out a press release, the federal government did, and the AP and others picked it up, and it said, too much fluoride in water, government says.
[01:50:30.477 --> 01:50:32.699]  High levels causing spots on teeth.
[01:50:32.699 --> 01:50:34.281]  Recommended limit to be lowered.
[01:50:34.761 --> 01:50:41.627]  From 0.7 or 1.2 milligrams per liter or one part per million roughly.
[01:50:41.627 --> 01:50:50.256]  And they're saying that they want to lower that even more because they're admitting it's causing dental fluorosis, yellow spots on the teeth, also the teeth are getting weak.
[01:50:51.056 --> 01:50:53.598]  They don't tell you the rest of what their studies have shown.
[01:50:53.598 --> 01:50:55.920]  Massive increases in bone cancer.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.181]  Massive reductions in IQ.
[01:50:58.181 --> 01:51:00.603]  And this has been known for almost a hundred years.
[01:51:00.603 --> 01:51:02.404]  Fluoride's one of the most studied things out there.
[01:51:02.404 --> 01:51:05.966]  Because it naturally kept getting in water supplies all over the world, causing problems.
[01:51:05.966 --> 01:51:06.887]  The Chinese know.
[01:51:06.887 --> 01:51:07.848]  The Japanese know.
[01:51:07.848 --> 01:51:08.368]  The U.S.
[01:51:08.368 --> 01:51:08.668]  knows.
[01:51:08.668 --> 01:51:09.149]  The Germans.
[01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:14.032]  I mean, it's a sick joke how documented all of this is.
[01:51:14.032 --> 01:51:16.514]  And they really overall whitewash it in the article.
[01:51:18.118 --> 01:51:18.318]  I think?
[01:51:40.737 --> 01:51:58.684]  The fact is, their poisoning is so accelerated that they know that we're becoming aware of it, and so they know that it's coming to a critical flashpoint with the public, so they're backing off and going, okay, okay, yeah, those studies are out there, okay, okay, scientists and the government, stop complaining, we'll cut the amount.
[01:51:58.684 --> 01:52:07.788]  Knowing that they're not really targeting you so much in the water now, as they are in the food, in the toothpaste, in the crops that are having it sprayed on it.
[01:52:08.248 --> 01:52:19.339]  Now, for those that wonder why government did this all over the world 60 years ago and why the federal government in our country or even in England will spend millions of dollars per town lobbying to have it put in, we know why.
[01:52:20.256 --> 01:52:26.542]  We have the Rockefeller Foundation documents, even from the 60s, where they talk about adding sterilants to vaccines.
[01:52:26.542 --> 01:52:31.748]  We have John P. Holder in the White House, Science-R, talking about the 70s, adding sterilants to water.
[01:52:31.748 --> 01:52:39.255]  We have the studies going back to the 20s, where governments and universities knew that sodium fluoride was lowering fertility, lowering IQ.
[01:52:40.636 --> 01:52:45.457]  Uh, this is being added to the water to, uh, dumb you down, to control you.
[01:52:45.457 --> 01:52:46.677]  And they've known all along.
[01:52:46.677 --> 01:52:54.439]  And there's an even bigger twist that we cover in our interview with Dr. Paul Conant, uh, that we're gonna, uh, link here, uh, on the bottom of the video.
[01:52:54.439 --> 01:52:59.259]  Uh, so hopefully, uh, you will send it to your friends and family so they can learn the truth.
[01:52:59.259 --> 01:53:07.761]  Your friends and family who've been in denial about fluoride, who just laugh at you and say, oh, my precious bodily fluids, like a line from Stanley Kubrick's, uh, great film, Dr. Strangelove,
[01:53:08.681 --> 01:53:25.095]  You can send them the Associated Press about this, because they've been saying for six years babies and small children shouldn't drink any of this water, shouldn't brush their teeth with it, and now they're just kind of covering their butt again, warning people, while still simultaneously making fun of people.
[01:53:25.095 --> 01:53:31.021]  Because the big secret is that depending on where your water district, whether it's Germany, Canada, England, Australia,
[01:53:31.761 --> 01:53:43.864]  The United States, depending on where your water district, your city, buys the so-called sodium fluoride, between 150 and 300 plus chemicals are in the so-called sodium fluoride.
[01:53:43.864 --> 01:53:45.104]  That's the other big secret.
[01:53:45.104 --> 01:53:46.524]  Sodium fluoride's bad enough.
[01:53:46.524 --> 01:53:56.847]  Lead, mercury, arsenic, radiation particles, radium, different isotopes of uranium, because they mine, most of the sodium fluoride comes
[01:53:57.327 --> 01:54:03.531]  From the byproducts of phosphate mining, where they mine the phosphate for fertilizer, but they can't use the toxic waste.
[01:54:03.531 --> 01:54:06.393]  They just certify it from China and ship it over here.
[01:54:06.393 --> 01:54:10.056]  Or they certify it from Florida and ship it, you know, into your city.
[01:54:10.056 --> 01:54:11.557]  And then you drink it.
[01:54:11.557 --> 01:54:14.879]  I mean, you could, I mean, you can't make something up this bad.
[01:54:14.879 --> 01:54:16.140]  And I remember Dr. Conant.
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:17.280]  We're good to go.
[01:54:39.858 --> 01:54:45.000]  See, the cover-ups admitted that uranium's in there, because they know that you know uranium's bad.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.622]  They can't tell you it's good like they lied to you about fluoride.
[01:54:47.622 --> 01:54:50.163]  So they just covered up that they're putting that in.
[01:54:50.163 --> 01:54:52.064]  And that's the real big secret.
[01:54:52.064 --> 01:54:54.805]  So please, this is something we can take control of.
[01:54:55.365 --> 01:54:59.266]  We can stop drinking the toxic waste filled water.
[01:54:59.266 --> 01:55:04.047]  You can stop having your children bathe in it with some pretty simple filtration systems on your house.
[01:55:04.047 --> 01:55:06.368]  You can move out to the country and drill a well.
[01:55:06.368 --> 01:55:16.110]  You can get away from this because depending on how many parts per million, we're talking 20 point, 15, 10 point, 8 point, 6 point IQ reductions.
[01:55:16.110 --> 01:55:18.611]  We're talking about thyroid problems.
[01:55:18.611 --> 01:55:21.151]  We're talking about your pancreas being burned out.
[01:55:21.151 --> 01:55:23.372]  All sorts of early onsets of
[01:55:23.772 --> 01:55:27.215]  Heart disease because it calcifies in the arteries and the ventricles.
[01:55:27.215 --> 01:55:32.559]  We're talking about massive brain damage being caused by it according to Dr. Blaylock and other top scientists.
[01:55:32.559 --> 01:55:33.800]  I mean, these are brain surgeons.
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:34.921]  These are professors.
[01:55:34.921 --> 01:55:36.743]  These are, I mean, this is the literature.
[01:55:36.743 --> 01:55:37.343]  Do you understand?
[01:55:37.343 --> 01:55:41.287]  This is an absolute fact and they're just covering their butts here.
[01:55:41.287 --> 01:55:47.111]  It took decades since they approved Prozac in 1981 to get them to admit on the drug insert
[01:55:48.132 --> 01:55:52.473]  That it does cause massive increases in suicide and psychotic behavior.
[01:55:52.473 --> 01:55:57.055]  Everybody knew because 99% of the mass shooters were on it.
[01:55:57.055 --> 01:56:01.556]  And it just puts them into a violent dream state when they're having a bad day.
[01:56:01.556 --> 01:56:06.238]  Now they've had to put it on the serotonin reuptake inhibitor family of Prozac-type drugs.
[01:56:06.858 --> 01:56:08.680]  And it's the same thing with fluoride.
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:12.084]  They're just putting the proviso in now to cover their butts.
[01:56:12.084 --> 01:56:20.112]  But now the denial's over, you can take even this whitewash and show it to people and save a lot of children's IQs, save a lot of women's thyroids.
[01:56:20.112 --> 01:56:21.673]  It really hits women bad in that area.
[01:56:21.673 --> 01:56:23.415]  Hits men worse in the bones.
[01:56:23.415 --> 01:56:28.400]  So many young people now getting arthritis directly linked to these chemicals in the water.
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:29.621]  Please warn everybody you know.
[01:56:30.442 --> 01:56:34.526]  You know, we can't fix the IMF and World Bank and the implosion of the dollar overnight.
[01:56:34.526 --> 01:56:38.409]  We can't stop all the nuts going around and shooting people, you know, overnight.
[01:56:38.409 --> 01:56:40.431]  We can't stop all these illegal wars.
[01:56:40.431 --> 01:56:44.594]  But we can sure stop eating GMO foods and drinking sodium fluoride.
[01:56:44.594 --> 01:56:48.838]  We can sure start loving our neighbors and talking to our friends and building our communities.
[01:56:48.838 --> 01:56:52.061]  Because if you want to fix this country and fix the world, it starts in the mirror.
[01:56:52.341 --> 01:56:56.605]  So warn everybody you know about sodium fluoride and other chemicals being added in the water.
[01:56:56.605 --> 01:56:57.926]  This is a big secret.
[01:56:57.926 --> 01:57:04.491]  Watch our other video, Food The Biggest Secret, that we put together that's been watched hundreds of thousands of times.
[01:57:04.491 --> 01:57:10.977]  And let's come together and really educate folks about what's happening so people can use their free will to protect themselves.
[01:57:10.977 --> 01:57:12.038]  Thank you for watching.
