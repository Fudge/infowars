[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:21.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.000 --> 00:27.000]  President Barack Obama's State of the Union was clearly directed by the district of
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  criminal's belief that the majority of Americans are misinformed gullible tax-paying idiots Obama
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  played to the corporate credit millionaires club peppered with a Syrian refugee and anti gay
[00:39.000 --> 00:45.000]  marriage activist Kim Davis this was propaganda theater of the highest order replete with a Hollywood
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  style preshow to fuel Obama's mountain of lies the largest deception aimed at the declining
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  viewership that actually tuned in was Obama's skewing of the state of the economy something
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  real Americans know far too well we're in the middle of the longest streak of private sector
[01:01.000 --> 01:13.000]  job creation in history more than 14 million new jobs the strongest two years of job growth
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  since the 1990s graph show it's unemployment rate cut in half here's what Obama's not telling you
[01:19.000 --> 01:27.000]  not only are 70% of US jobs now held by immigrant workers but the average US stock is already down
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  over 20% this year and the global economy is flirting with severe recession in fact the
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  Royal Bank of Scotland even warned its clients to sell everything and exit the stock market as soon
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  as possible even Obama's controller George Soros says the sky is falling perhaps what better reason
[01:45.000 --> 01:52.000]  than this to tell the American people it isn't Obama's claim that 900,000 manufacturing jobs were
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  created in his past six years twisted the fact that manufacturing jobs have actually diminished
[01:58.000 --> 02:05.000]  by 230,000 Obama claimed he cut the unemployment rate in half he is measuring the fudged 5%
[02:05.000 --> 02:13.000]  unemployment rate by the dismal 10% unemployment rate he was responsible for in October of 2009
[02:13.000 --> 02:20.000]  as more jobs go overseas and the labor arena shrinks back here at home and baby boomers retire
[02:20.000 --> 02:28.000]  nearly 95 million Americans are not in the workforce 35.4% of the country is on welfare
[02:28.000 --> 02:37.000]  38.8% of which are white and 39.8% which are black while 62% of working Americans have less
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  than a thousand dollars in savings another blatant lie was Obama's insistence that he attends his
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  intelligence briefings every morning now as someone who begins every day with an intelligence
[02:48.000 --> 02:58.000]  briefing I know this is a dangerous time but that's not primarily because of some looming
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  superpower out there and it's certainly not because of diminished American strength
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  Breitbart reported during his first 1225 days in office Obama attended his presidential daily
[03:08.000 --> 03:17.000]  briefing just 536 times or 43.8% of the time during 2011 and his first half of 2012 his
[03:17.000 --> 03:24.000]  attendance became even less frequent falling to just over 38% by contrast Obama's predecessor
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  George W. Bush almost never missed his daily intelligence briefings the government Accountability
[03:30.000 --> 03:37.000]  Institute report revealed that President Barack Obama attended only 42.1% of his daily intelligence
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.000]  briefings Obama appears to be speaking of an entirely separate intelligence briefing as a leaked
[03:43.000 --> 03:50.000]  2012 Pentagon document revealed the US and other NATO nations deliberately backed Al Qaeda in Iraq
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.000]  which morphed into ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
[03:57.000 --> 04:04.000]  Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far and in the process health care inflation is slow
[04:04.000 --> 04:11.000]  and our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law in reality however
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  Obamacare is killing the economy forcing businesses to cut back on hiring full-time employees
[04:17.000 --> 04:24.000]  because the law requires firms with 50 or more full-time workers to offer them affordable health insurance
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.000]  or pay a fine of $2,000 to $3,000 a worker while the average taxpayer will be subjected to an incremental
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  annual fine for not signing up for Obama's flagrant unconstitutional health care disaster
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  and if that arrogant display of power wasn't enough Americans were quickly reassured of Obama's
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.000]  unyielding abuse of power the morning after his State of the Union address by White House
[04:49.000 --> 04:57.000]  Chief of Staff Dennis McDonahue who said will do audacious executive action over the course of the rest of the year

[05:32.000 --> 05:39.000]  it does not appear that Rand Paul is going to make the cut in this primetime debate but John Kasich is what is this world coming to
[05:39.000 --> 05:44.000]  just a little side note here the majority of Americans polled think that Hillary Clinton should continue to run

[08:34.360 --> 08:36.600]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[08:36.600 --> 08:40.440]  I grow before the days.
[08:40.440 --> 08:44.600]  Last night, a little rock put me in a haystack.
[08:44.600 --> 08:49.640]  My friends, it is already Thursday, the 14th day of January 2016
[08:49.640 --> 08:53.800]  and everybody can feel it, everybody can see it.
[08:53.800 --> 08:57.160]  This is an amazing year of radical developments
[08:57.160 --> 08:59.960]  and fast-paced change.
[08:59.960 --> 09:03.560]  We are entering the most important time
[09:03.560 --> 09:08.840]  in our entire human developmental history.
[09:08.840 --> 09:12.280]  It is undoubted.
[09:12.280 --> 09:19.960]  We have four guests today. We have Richard Reeves,
[09:19.960 --> 09:21.800]  who's been working inside the Republican Party
[09:21.800 --> 09:26.360]  for a very long time at the delegate level,
[09:27.640 --> 09:33.400]  meeting today inside the RNC that is there at the site
[09:33.400 --> 09:37.160]  of the upcoming debate tonight at Fox Business Channel
[09:37.160 --> 09:40.840]  that we're going to be covering from the event
[09:40.840 --> 09:43.720]  and also from our studios here in Austin, Texas
[09:43.720 --> 09:44.840]  with a full panel.
[09:44.840 --> 09:47.400]  I'll also be popping in live tonight as well,
[09:47.400 --> 09:49.560]  the Skype and Facebook mentions.
[09:49.560 --> 09:54.440]  That'll go from seven o'clock past 10.
[09:54.440 --> 09:57.880]  infowars.com forward slash show to find the free feeds.
[09:57.880 --> 10:00.840]  We're also putting it on a YouTube feed, audio feeds
[10:00.840 --> 10:02.920]  and our own satellite system.
[10:02.920 --> 10:07.320]  We now send the radio show slash TV show,
[10:07.320 --> 10:09.480]  the four-hour broadcast that you're listening to now,
[10:09.480 --> 10:14.840]  11 a.m. to 3 p.m. out on the satellite,
[10:14.840 --> 10:17.480]  not just the radio show but also the nightly news
[10:17.480 --> 10:20.520]  and many affiliates from areas of New York
[10:20.520 --> 10:26.920]  to New Mexico are carrying our live special events,
[10:26.920 --> 10:28.120]  not just the nightly news now.
[10:28.120 --> 10:29.720]  So that's very, very exciting.
[10:29.720 --> 10:31.560]  I never really thought of trying to put the nightly news
[10:31.560 --> 10:33.960]  on radio, but that's just happening.
[10:33.960 --> 10:35.960]  I think it's like last time I checked,
[10:35.960 --> 10:38.440]  like 15 stations I know of.
[10:38.440 --> 10:41.640]  Well, a couple of them are three station groups,
[10:41.640 --> 10:42.920]  so it's more than 20 stations,
[10:42.920 --> 10:46.440]  but more than 15 groups are now picking up
[10:46.440 --> 10:47.720]  the nightly news on radio.
[10:47.720 --> 10:48.840]  I never even thought of that.
[10:48.840 --> 10:51.480]  It's just kind of like you build it and they come,
[10:51.480 --> 10:53.960]  but hardly ever the way you thought it would be.
[10:53.960 --> 10:55.080]  You think you're innovating,
[10:55.080 --> 10:56.520]  you think you're doing something new,
[10:56.520 --> 10:57.880]  you think it's going to do this,
[10:57.880 --> 11:00.840]  but it does that, and a lot of times it's better.
[11:00.840 --> 11:02.120]  So people say, what's the plan?
[11:02.120 --> 11:05.400]  And I say, we're doing experiments here.
[11:05.400 --> 11:07.640]  We're just putting the info out.
[11:07.640 --> 11:09.720]  We have James O'Keefe joining us in 20 minutes
[11:09.720 --> 11:11.480]  with another big breaking news.
[11:11.480 --> 11:13.080]  It's part two of the video.
[11:13.080 --> 11:14.280]  It was picked up by the Daily Mail,
[11:14.280 --> 11:16.440]  the Associated Press, the Drudge Carried
[11:16.440 --> 11:20.200]  over the last few days, DrudgeReport.com.
[11:20.200 --> 11:20.920]  This is part two.
[11:20.920 --> 11:22.840]  He wanted to give it to us exclusively
[11:22.840 --> 11:24.280]  with the common core individual,
[11:25.800 --> 11:28.760]  high level executive admitting
[11:28.760 --> 11:30.440]  that it's all about making money
[11:31.640 --> 11:33.400]  and making people buy new textbooks
[11:33.400 --> 11:36.120]  and controlling what education they get.
[11:36.120 --> 11:37.960]  So that's up on infowars.com.
[11:37.960 --> 11:40.040]  Gerald Salente is going to come on for 45 minutes.
[11:41.000 --> 11:42.840]  Dave Agame is coming on.
[11:42.840 --> 11:44.040]  I mentioned the RNC.
[11:45.480 --> 11:47.400]  He's on the RNC board,
[11:49.720 --> 11:53.560]  and they are moving to try to get impeachment
[11:55.160 --> 11:57.160]  as a resolution out of the RNC.
[12:00.120 --> 12:03.000]  I noticed they had a bunch of Democrat-controlled publications
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.400]  the last three days make jokes about the show and say,
[12:05.400 --> 12:08.440]  Jones is claiming he's in contact with the RNC
[12:08.440 --> 12:11.160]  and that there's a move to move to impeach Obama.
[12:11.160 --> 12:13.080]  More lies from him.
[12:13.080 --> 12:15.560]  I mean, like we just get up here and lie,
[12:15.560 --> 12:18.440]  and then 99% of the time it comes true because I'm a liar.
[12:19.320 --> 12:21.000]  Either I'm a liar and say things
[12:21.000 --> 12:22.600]  and then it makes it come true,
[12:22.600 --> 12:24.600]  like I'm Gandalf or something,
[12:24.600 --> 12:25.800]  or I'm telling the truth.
[12:25.800 --> 12:28.920]  I mean, you people just lie to your victim readers
[12:29.480 --> 12:30.120]  all day long.
[12:31.480 --> 12:32.360]  It's just crazy.
[12:32.360 --> 12:35.640]  And it doesn't mean we're going to impeach Obama,
[12:35.640 --> 12:36.520]  but we're sure trying.
[12:37.880 --> 12:39.000]  So that's coming up.
[12:39.640 --> 12:40.920]  And then Dan Bongino,
[12:40.920 --> 12:42.760]  the former top secret service agent,
[12:42.760 --> 12:46.520]  that is, he ran the foreign operations whenever POTUS
[12:47.880 --> 12:49.400]  or Goblin number one,
[12:50.040 --> 12:51.720]  or I guess Islamists number one,
[12:52.280 --> 12:54.040]  Radical Jihadi number one,
[12:54.040 --> 12:55.160]  El Presidente,
[12:55.720 --> 12:56.280]  the Mahdi,
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.760]  whenever he would go out of the country,
[13:00.040 --> 13:01.960]  Bongino headed those things up.
[13:01.960 --> 13:05.320]  And I want to talk about the scandals in the government,
[13:05.320 --> 13:07.560]  the scandals in the secret service.
[13:07.560 --> 13:09.000]  And also want to make clear,
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.840]  I never said Bongino said that
[13:10.840 --> 13:13.080]  Obama was a secret radical Muslim.
[13:13.720 --> 13:15.080]  And I made that very clear when I talked about
[13:15.080 --> 13:17.400]  other secret service people, other feds,
[13:17.400 --> 13:19.960]  other contacts saying that no,
[13:19.960 --> 13:22.360]  he really is a closet radical Jihadi.
[13:22.920 --> 13:25.080]  And of course, that's all evidenced now by his actions.
[13:25.640 --> 13:28.360]  And I was hearing this from high level folks years ago,
[13:28.360 --> 13:30.360]  and I'm like, I don't even want to hear this.
[13:30.360 --> 13:31.320]  This is so dangerous.
[13:31.320 --> 13:32.440]  Plus, I don't believe it.
[13:32.440 --> 13:33.800]  It's just too over the top.
[13:33.800 --> 13:35.400]  And then now I just keep getting it from
[13:35.400 --> 13:37.160]  other prominent high level people.
[13:37.160 --> 13:38.440]  I told you a few weeks ago,
[13:41.080 --> 13:41.640]  and you know what?
[13:41.640 --> 13:43.240]  They may even do an interview.
[13:43.240 --> 13:45.080]  So we'll see.
[13:46.280 --> 13:48.120]  You know, I'm trying to not get killed here too
[13:48.120 --> 13:48.760]  at the same time.
[13:48.760 --> 13:51.240]  I mean, this is a dangerous level we've gotten to folks
[13:52.520 --> 13:53.880]  with the facts we're dealing with.
[13:53.880 --> 13:57.240]  But Bongino's coming on and Bongino said on air
[13:57.240 --> 13:58.040]  a few years ago, he said,
[13:58.040 --> 14:00.280]  Alex, I've heard what you say about the president.
[14:00.280 --> 14:01.640]  It's worse than you know.
[14:03.080 --> 14:04.520]  And I said, well, tell me.
[14:04.520 --> 14:07.480]  He said, well, obviously I can't, but it's worse than you know.
[14:08.280 --> 14:10.360]  And then that's what I was told by other secret service people.
[14:14.440 --> 14:18.040]  It's just totally, totally crazy.
[14:19.560 --> 14:21.240]  So that's coming up as well.
[14:21.240 --> 14:24.680]  Let's get into the really serious news now
[14:24.680 --> 14:25.960]  and just mention what's coming up.
[14:25.960 --> 14:30.440]  Now, Islamic State claims deadly Indonesia attack responsibility.
[14:31.560 --> 14:34.120]  Two civilians killed, five terrorists killed,
[14:35.640 --> 14:36.360]  was 19.
[14:36.360 --> 14:39.080]  Now it's 20 something injured bodies everywhere, blood,
[14:39.080 --> 14:40.760]  the stock market plunging over it.
[14:42.520 --> 14:44.680]  And they said that it was only one year anniversary,
[14:44.680 --> 14:47.080]  obviously of the bombings and shootings over in Paris.
[14:47.080 --> 14:49.720]  And it was meant to coincide with that and copy that.
[14:50.680 --> 14:52.280]  Terrorists hit Jakarta.
[14:52.280 --> 14:56.600]  And Indian Indonesians say we are not afraid.
[14:56.600 --> 15:00.120]  Wall Street Journal, Islamic State claims deadly Indonesia
[15:01.160 --> 15:02.440]  attacks responsibility.
[15:03.080 --> 15:05.800]  Islamic State claims bomb and gun attacks in Indonesian capital.
[15:05.800 --> 15:08.440]  There's associated press as well.
[15:08.440 --> 15:11.640]  And we'll detail that a little bit more coming up.
[15:14.840 --> 15:18.200]  But the big issue is stock markets are plunging all over the world.
[15:18.200 --> 15:21.800]  Asian stocks plunge after terrorist attacks in Indonesia,
[15:21.800 --> 15:27.960]  but that's fueled by the other Asian stock problems driven by China.
[15:30.920 --> 15:32.520]  And speaking of the stock market,
[15:32.520 --> 15:36.600]  breaking Dow Jones has lost over 1500 points in only 10 days.
[15:37.320 --> 15:40.760]  As of Monday, it was already the worst opening of the stock market
[15:40.760 --> 15:44.760]  in its history since the new year.
[15:44.760 --> 15:48.760]  And now it's continuing that trend.
[15:48.760 --> 15:52.360]  Here's another headline from zero hedge.
[15:52.360 --> 15:54.440]  The bursting of the bubble has begun.
[15:54.440 --> 16:00.600]  Financial system has become even more leverage than it was in 2007, 2008.
[16:00.600 --> 16:03.240]  And the article details exactly how that is the case.
[16:03.240 --> 16:06.440]  Central banks cut interest rates to zero to make bond payments smaller.
[16:07.080 --> 16:09.560]  Number two, central banks launched QE and other programs
[16:09.560 --> 16:13.480]  to put a floor beneath bond prices, which bond prices rise.
[16:13.480 --> 16:17.400]  Bond yields fall and debt payments become smaller and easier to service.
[16:18.200 --> 16:21.800]  Number three, central banks provided verbal intervention,
[16:21.800 --> 16:24.840]  promising to do more or whatever it takes whenever bonds came close
[16:24.840 --> 16:26.840]  to ending their bull market.
[16:26.840 --> 16:30.120]  As a result of this, the financial system has become even more leveraged
[16:30.120 --> 16:33.240]  than it was in 2007 in the beginning of the last debt crisis.
[16:33.240 --> 16:39.160]  Globally, the bond bubble has grown by more than 20 trillion since 2008.
[16:39.160 --> 16:44.600]  Today, it's worth 100 trillion with an estimated $555 billion
[16:44.600 --> 16:46.600]  in derivatives trading based on it.
[16:46.600 --> 16:49.640]  Yes, $555 trillion just in bonds.
[16:49.640 --> 16:53.240]  More than seven times the global GDP or gross domestic product
[16:53.240 --> 16:56.840]  and more than 10 times the credit default swamp market, $50 trillion,
[16:56.840 --> 16:58.600]  which triggered the 2008 crisis.
[16:58.600 --> 17:00.200]  And it just goes from there.
[17:00.200 --> 17:02.680]  But don't worry, Obama gave speeches at the State of the Union
[17:02.680 --> 17:05.960]  and then again last night, out there I guess on the campaign trail
[17:05.960 --> 17:08.600]  for the Democrats, that it's ridiculous.
[17:08.600 --> 17:09.320]  Everything's fine.
[17:09.320 --> 17:11.720]  The economy has never been better.
[17:13.880 --> 17:14.760]  Okay.
[17:14.760 --> 17:17.000]  And his idiot constituents lap it up.
[17:17.560 --> 17:19.960]  I'm telling you, Obama could climb up on a dinner table
[17:19.960 --> 17:21.560]  in front of a Democratic Party family,
[17:23.400 --> 17:26.040]  pull down his drawers and do, you know what, all over the table.
[17:26.040 --> 17:27.800]  And he'd tell them it was chocolate cake, folks.
[17:27.800 --> 17:29.480]  And they'd scoop it up.
[17:29.480 --> 17:30.040]  I'm not kidding.
[17:30.040 --> 17:30.520]  They would.
[17:30.520 --> 17:31.960]  Because this is cult programming.
[17:31.960 --> 17:33.720]  These people are in a cult.
[17:33.720 --> 17:35.560]  They can't admit they're in a cult.
[17:35.560 --> 17:39.800]  If he poured cyanide lace Kool-Aid in glasses like Jim Jones,
[17:39.800 --> 17:42.760]  they'd slobber it down with delight.
[17:43.480 --> 17:47.400]  Gold bounces on return of stock market volatility.
[17:48.120 --> 17:51.720]  Gold is a safe haven asset investors turn to
[17:51.720 --> 17:54.200]  during times of stock market turmoil.
[17:54.200 --> 17:56.760]  The price of gold received a lift yesterday afternoon.
[17:56.760 --> 18:00.120]  This is volatility return to European and U.S. markets.
[18:00.120 --> 18:04.280]  Earlier this week, the yellow medal had fallen from recent highs
[18:04.280 --> 18:07.080]  as stock regained a measure of stability.
[18:07.080 --> 18:09.080]  And then it just goes down over the numbers.
[18:12.040 --> 18:14.120]  Let's just continue along this line.
[18:14.120 --> 18:18.680]  Miami Dade School's board prepped for influx of Cuban refugees.
[18:19.320 --> 18:20.760]  It's the third world collapses.
[18:22.600 --> 18:24.040]  I'm going to talk about El Chapo.
[18:24.040 --> 18:25.720]  You know, I've said free El Chapo,
[18:25.720 --> 18:27.800]  even though he's a mass murdering killer, drug dealer,
[18:27.800 --> 18:28.440]  horrible person.
[18:29.080 --> 18:30.280]  He worked for the CIA.
[18:30.280 --> 18:30.920]  It's come out.
[18:30.920 --> 18:34.680]  Sinaloa worked for the CIA just as short a time ago as two years ago,
[18:35.240 --> 18:36.600]  and that they're shipping the drugs in,
[18:36.600 --> 18:38.280]  and they're just burning one of their people.
[18:38.840 --> 18:41.400]  So until the folks in our government,
[18:41.400 --> 18:43.960]  the National Security Council, the big banks,
[18:43.960 --> 18:47.320]  the foreign controllers get in trouble,
[18:47.320 --> 18:49.160]  then you shouldn't burn their minions.
[18:49.160 --> 18:52.120]  And it's his bosses burning him.
[18:53.400 --> 18:57.320]  It'd be like a mafia don ordering one of his captains
[18:57.320 --> 19:01.640]  to go kill somebody and then sitting in judgment over the captain,
[19:01.640 --> 19:04.840]  and now they're going to extra die into a super max in the United States,
[19:04.840 --> 19:05.720]  and I'm just sorry.
[19:08.680 --> 19:13.480]  Justice dictates that he should be able to just move to New York City
[19:13.480 --> 19:15.400]  and have his tens of billions of dollars in drug money.
[19:16.200 --> 19:18.840]  But see, they always burn their minions.
[19:19.800 --> 19:24.280]  Remember Manuel Noriega was on these big $100 million Swiss mansions and stuff,
[19:24.280 --> 19:27.960]  and the media started reporting on it, so they did that whole fake raid,
[19:27.960 --> 19:29.320]  the whole Panama deception.
[19:29.320 --> 19:30.600]  Laming Americans have been kidnapped.
[19:30.600 --> 19:31.560]  None of it was true.
[19:31.560 --> 19:33.080]  Just to grab them and go put them in a prison.
[19:34.680 --> 19:39.320]  Because he wasn't paying his full cut to the CIA of drug money.
[19:39.320 --> 19:40.040]  That all came out.
[19:41.400 --> 19:43.320]  So I say release Manuel Noriega, too.
[19:43.320 --> 19:45.080]  I mean, what a hypocritical joke.
[19:45.080 --> 19:48.680]  It's like the police taking a 16-year-old to jail for having
[19:48.680 --> 19:50.920]  Levi Gerritz hewn tobacco in the pocket,
[19:50.920 --> 19:54.600]  and the cops selling cocaine to school kids out the back of his crucifix.
[19:54.600 --> 19:57.080]  Don't take the kid to jail for the Levi Gerritz.
[19:59.320 --> 20:02.840]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[20:02.840 --> 20:04.680]  How would you like to never be cold again?
[20:05.240 --> 20:08.840]  This is Dale with Fortress Clothing, and I'm here to tell you,
[20:08.840 --> 20:11.480]  you will never be cold again with Fortress.
[20:12.120 --> 20:14.040]  If you're tired of freezing your butt off,
[20:14.040 --> 20:17.080]  elk hunting, sitting in a tree stand, deer hunting,
[20:17.080 --> 20:21.960]  winter camping, fishing, ice fishing, no longer fear the cold.
[20:21.960 --> 20:25.480]  If you snowmobile, ski, snowboard, get Fortress.
[20:26.040 --> 20:28.840]  Sledding with the kids, shoveling the walks, shopping,
[20:28.840 --> 20:32.600]  or if you or your spouse get cold feet at home, get Fortress.
[20:32.600 --> 20:34.920]  If you're stuck outside working in the cold,
[20:34.920 --> 20:37.720]  or find yourself in an emergency situation,
[20:37.720 --> 20:41.560]  get our winter bug out bag, and you will never be cold again.
[20:41.560 --> 20:45.640]  Fortress is the answer, so quit complaining and go to fortressclothing.com.
[20:45.640 --> 20:48.920]  It's a mid-layer garment that goes with anything you want to wear.

[20:55.240 --> 20:56.920]  Fortressclothing.com.
[20:58.680 --> 21:00.440]  Something just happened that is explained
[21:00.440 --> 21:03.240]  while survival food is literally flying off the shelves
[21:03.240 --> 21:05.720]  and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[21:05.720 --> 21:09.720]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[21:09.720 --> 21:13.160]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof,
[21:13.160 --> 21:15.160]  revealing their secret could land me in hot water,
[21:15.160 --> 21:18.920]  but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[21:18.920 --> 21:23.240]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again,
[21:23.240 --> 21:27.080]  but be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is,
[21:27.080 --> 21:29.400]  they must know something we don't.
[21:29.400 --> 21:33.320]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding,
[21:33.320 --> 21:36.200]  and why supplies of this critical item are so low,
[21:36.200 --> 21:39.560]  or even completely sold out at many stores across America.
[21:40.200 --> 21:41.400]  Don't miss out.
[21:41.400 --> 21:44.120]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart
[21:44.120 --> 21:46.600]  patrons have already seen in recent days.
[21:46.600 --> 21:51.240]  Go to FEMA3.com and discover the number one most critical item
[21:51.240 --> 21:52.200]  in a crisis.
[21:52.200 --> 21:55.800]  Watch the shocking video right now at FEMA3.com.
[21:55.800 --> 22:19.800]  Again, that's FEMA3.com.
[22:26.120 --> 22:28.120]  Thank you for watching this video.
[22:28.120 --> 22:57.800]  Thank you for watching this video.
[22:58.520 --> 22:59.400]  Shower filters.
[22:59.400 --> 23:01.160]  We're introducing the best yet.

[23:26.840 --> 23:28.200]  from ProPure today.
[23:56.840 --> 23:58.600]  Seattle, Washington.
[24:27.400 --> 24:29.880]  Because why would I come out and plug somebody else?
[24:29.880 --> 24:33.320]  Because I want everybody in the new media to trailblaze
[24:33.320 --> 24:36.760]  and do new things and analyze media propaganda,
[24:36.760 --> 24:38.680]  not just the politicians.
[24:38.680 --> 24:41.320]  And that will cause a revolution in thinking
[24:41.320 --> 24:44.920]  that will overturn the social engineers that count on us
[24:44.920 --> 24:48.360]  growing up stupid, not paying attention.
[24:50.760 --> 24:53.640]  We're either going to be totally dumb or incredibly free,
[24:53.640 --> 24:54.440]  not one or the other.
[24:54.440 --> 24:57.560]  You either get into politics, get into geopolitical issues,
[24:57.560 --> 24:59.160]  find out how informative it is,
[24:59.160 --> 25:02.200]  find out how exciting it is, or you're a slave.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.240]  So that's tonight, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time,
[25:05.240 --> 25:08.360]  infowars.com forward slash show.
[25:08.360 --> 25:10.120]  And we'll be sending out those free links
[25:10.120 --> 25:14.360]  and also texting out and posting the YouTube link today
[25:14.360 --> 25:19.720]  as a backup feed at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[25:19.720 --> 25:21.720]  This is a short segment.
[25:21.720 --> 25:23.720]  We've got James O'Keeffe coming up in the next.
[25:25.720 --> 25:27.720]  But here's just what I wanted to get to.
[25:29.720 --> 25:45.720]  Our experts, from Peter Schiff to Mr. Dent to Salente, all of them,
[25:45.720 --> 25:49.800]  you name it, Paul Craig Roberts, the list goes on and on.
[25:49.800 --> 25:53.160]  The alternative media has been very accurate
[25:53.160 --> 25:54.680]  about what's happening in stock markets,
[25:54.680 --> 25:57.000]  bond markets, oil, gold, all of it.
[25:58.360 --> 26:00.600]  Just way more accurate than mainstream media,
[26:00.600 --> 26:03.800]  but it's not because we're even that smart.
[26:03.800 --> 26:06.200]  It's that market fundamentals are known
[26:06.920 --> 26:10.200]  and how those fundamentals are being gamed is known.
[26:10.200 --> 26:12.680]  And so you can pretty much tell where we're going.
[26:12.680 --> 26:15.000]  Does it mean we know exactly when something's going to happen?
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.680]  No, but in general, we are in a big ship going about 50 miles an hour,
[26:23.160 --> 26:26.600]  however many knots that is, right at a jagged reef.
[26:28.600 --> 26:32.360]  And it's pretty much too late to turn it around now.
[26:34.120 --> 26:35.400]  But here's the rest of the story.
[26:36.600 --> 26:38.840]  When this ship plows into that reef,
[26:41.560 --> 26:43.320]  the establishment is going to say,
[26:43.320 --> 26:47.480]  oh my gosh, they'll warn us about it the day it happens.
[26:47.480 --> 26:49.480]  They'll get Pulitzer prizes for breaking it,
[26:50.200 --> 26:51.480]  pat each other on the back,
[26:51.480 --> 26:53.480]  maybe throw in a few peace prizes while they're at it.
[26:54.120 --> 26:55.720]  You know, Obama launches extra wars,
[26:55.720 --> 26:57.480]  he gets a peace prize per war.
[26:57.480 --> 26:58.840]  This is all inverting reality.
[26:58.840 --> 27:00.280]  Two plus two equals whatever they say.
[27:00.840 --> 27:01.720]  They do it on purpose.
[27:01.720 --> 27:03.800]  They lie on purpose and make it ridiculous
[27:03.800 --> 27:05.640]  to just break you and make you accept it.
[27:05.640 --> 27:07.000]  People say, this is so ridiculous.
[27:07.000 --> 27:08.440]  It's such, that's the whole point.
[27:08.440 --> 27:13.960]  It's like the media coming out and saying,
[27:13.960 --> 27:16.920]  oh, Chris Carter is basing a bunch of the new ex files on Alex Jones.
[27:21.080 --> 27:22.680]  Even though Chris Carter says that,
[27:23.560 --> 27:26.840]  they'll just say it's not true because that's what liars do.
[27:27.720 --> 27:30.120]  And again, that shows how we're successful
[27:30.120 --> 27:32.840]  getting culture to follow the analysis that we're engaged in.
[27:33.560 --> 27:36.200]  And I have talked to the Carter folks,
[27:36.200 --> 27:39.080]  I'll leave it at that and it turns out he is a listener and a fan and turns out
[27:39.080 --> 27:41.000]  I'm going to be meeting with him in the future.
[27:41.560 --> 27:42.600]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[27:42.600 --> 27:45.880]  And so have a little bit more for you down the road.
[27:46.440 --> 27:49.720]  But that's a big deal because that's the most popular TV show
[27:49.720 --> 27:52.760]  in modern history in the United States and worldwide,
[27:53.320 --> 27:56.680]  bigger than even Dallas, over a billion viewers.
[27:59.160 --> 28:03.000]  And the new show is quote based predominantly on
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.320]  info wars and Alex Jones that came out of Chris Carter's mouth.
[28:09.640 --> 28:12.200]  And again, I'm not up here bragging about it.
[28:12.200 --> 28:15.080]  It just shows how twisted the controlled media is
[28:15.080 --> 28:16.840]  because you can pull all these news articles up saying,
[28:16.840 --> 28:19.080]  it's not true and I'm lying about it.
[28:20.760 --> 28:22.200]  That's how warped they are.
[28:22.200 --> 28:24.920]  They tell you Obama's not coming after your guns.
[28:26.280 --> 28:28.360]  Health care's free under Obamacare.
[28:28.360 --> 28:30.920]  Now, he says health care has gone down in price.
[28:30.920 --> 28:31.720]  It's exploded.
[28:35.720 --> 28:37.000]  Again, it's pure lies.
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.120]  So that's going to be coming up.
[28:40.280 --> 28:41.640]  Also, we're going to get into
[28:43.880 --> 28:48.600]  USC students required to detail sexual history before registering for classes.
[28:48.600 --> 28:51.640]  And folks, this is more of a recounting of your sex history
[28:51.640 --> 28:53.960]  than skull and bones and Scientology does.
[28:53.960 --> 28:57.080]  This is 100% cult programming.
[28:57.080 --> 29:01.160]  This is 100% reeducation camp crap.
[29:02.120 --> 29:05.880]  I mean, this is so cultic and it turns out it's happening all over the western world.
[29:05.880 --> 29:08.360]  And now Homeland Security is asking hotel staff
[29:08.360 --> 29:10.760]  to report customers for too many condoms.
[29:12.920 --> 29:15.240]  If they request more condoms in the mini bar,
[29:15.240 --> 29:16.600]  they must be sex travers.
[29:16.600 --> 29:19.080]  The issue is they're turning everyone into spies
[29:19.080 --> 29:21.080]  and they're turning everyone into spies.
[29:21.080 --> 29:26.040]  The issue is they're turning everyone into spies when the big banks
[29:26.040 --> 29:29.000]  and our government's been caught in drugs, sex trafficking, everything.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.560]  The UN runs most worldwide sex trafficking.
[29:31.560 --> 29:33.160]  That's come out in major news,
[29:33.160 --> 29:35.240]  but the very same governments involved in it
[29:35.800 --> 29:37.560]  are now turning hotel staff into spies.
[29:37.560 --> 29:39.160]  I mean, every time I check into a hotel,
[29:39.160 --> 29:41.400]  for the last decade, I get 20 questions and I say,
[29:41.400 --> 29:43.400]  look, I know you're putting that on Homeland Security database.
[29:43.400 --> 29:46.840]  Just knock it off, give me the keys or I'm leaving.
[29:46.840 --> 29:48.280]  Call Homeland Security later, you little punk.
[29:48.280 --> 29:49.480]  We're on the march.
[29:49.480 --> 29:52.040]  The Empire is on the march.
[29:52.040 --> 29:54.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:58.760 --> 30:01.080]  Agent Stocks fell sharply after suspected ISIS
[30:01.080 --> 30:04.120]  suicide bombers and gunmen attacked Indonesia's capital on Thursday,
[30:04.120 --> 30:06.280]  killing at least three and wounding several others.
[30:06.280 --> 30:08.200]  Massive explosions shook downtown Jakarta,
[30:08.200 --> 30:10.840]  including a reported bomb going off near local UN office,
[30:10.840 --> 30:13.000]  another explosion outside of popular shopping mall,
[30:13.000 --> 30:16.120]  and several gunmen also exchanged gunfire with police on public streets.
[30:16.120 --> 30:18.040]  Jakarta's stock market plunged the results,
[30:18.040 --> 30:20.520]  impacting other Asian stock markets that are already in freefall,
[30:20.520 --> 30:22.600]  following a massive sell-off on Wall Street yesterday,
[30:22.600 --> 30:24.440]  fueled by concerns over China's economy,
[30:24.440 --> 30:26.200]  overvalued stock and low oil prices.
[30:26.200 --> 30:29.080]  Japan's Nikkei 225 slid dramatically in early trading,
[30:29.080 --> 30:33.480]  and was down 2.68% for around 474 points near the end of the day.
[30:33.480 --> 30:36.280]  China's hand-seeing index stayed negative territory most of the day,
[30:36.280 --> 30:39.160]  while Indonesia's currency crashed in response to the terrorist attack
[30:39.160 --> 30:40.840]  likely to be blamed on ISIS.
[30:40.840 --> 30:43.160]  There's no doubt that tax effects on Asian stock markets
[30:43.160 --> 30:44.840]  will also shock U.S. markets,
[30:44.840 --> 30:50.360]  especially considering the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 16,151 on Wednesday,
[30:50.360 --> 30:53.320]  down over 1,500 points in the past 10 trading days.
[30:53.320 --> 30:57.000]  Check back on Infowars.com and PrismPlanet.com for more economic news.
[30:57.000 --> 31:23.000]  This is Kit D'Angelo's reporting.
[31:27.320 --> 31:31.320]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[31:31.320 --> 31:36.120]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems
[31:36.120 --> 31:37.640]  and enhance overall health.
[31:37.640 --> 31:40.520]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species,
[31:40.520 --> 31:44.360]  that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[31:44.360 --> 31:49.720]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[31:49.720 --> 31:52.200]  Now available at InfowarsLife.com.

[32:57.000 --> 33:19.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:19.800 --> 33:26.040]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:38.440 --> 33:42.360]  Well, the information overload is certainly happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:42.920 --> 33:48.920]  We have Dan Bongino, one of the top secret service agents who ran Obama's foreign details.
[33:48.920 --> 33:54.600]  Joining us to give his analysis on what's currently happening inside the criminal regime,
[33:54.600 --> 33:56.280]  he left because it was so evil.
[33:56.280 --> 33:59.480]  He said he just couldn't be part of it, but then kept his silence.
[33:59.480 --> 34:00.760]  He'll be joining us.
[34:00.760 --> 34:07.160]  And we also have Dave Agame, who's on the RNC board, who is moving to try to get a vote
[34:07.160 --> 34:12.760]  in the RNC in the next few days to request that Congress begin impeachment hearings and proceedings.
[34:13.320 --> 34:17.480]  And we have Richard Reeves, our political correspondent, who's on the ground for the
[34:17.480 --> 34:19.320]  debates tonight with Joe Beggs.
[34:19.320 --> 34:24.440]  They'll both be reporting from the Fox business debate.
[34:24.440 --> 34:26.920]  Gerald Salente, the trends forecasters, popping in.
[34:26.920 --> 34:30.120]  But first, James O'Keefe has done it again.
[34:30.120 --> 34:33.880]  Seems like every week I got a DrudgeReport.com and I see that and he does do it again.
[34:33.880 --> 34:39.160]  I mean, again, I lavish praise on some of our guests that are really huge game changers,
[34:39.160 --> 34:42.280]  like Larry Pratt, unsung, very mild manner.
[34:42.280 --> 34:44.200]  He's like, you know, Mr. McGoo or something.
[34:44.200 --> 34:48.840]  But the guy literally, we would not have the Second Amendment right now if it wasn't for
[34:48.840 --> 34:54.200]  his organization, taking over the NRA, basically from within, that's the inside baseball.
[34:54.200 --> 35:03.160]  I've had NRA board members on, like, of course, the famous rock star, Ted Nugent, saying,
[35:03.160 --> 35:04.040]  no, that's true.
[35:04.040 --> 35:06.600]  So I call him kind of the modern George Washington, the Second Amendment.
[35:07.160 --> 35:09.640]  Well, James O'Keefe has the blueprint.
[35:10.440 --> 35:12.040]  I know he doesn't want to hear all this, but it's true.
[35:12.040 --> 35:17.400]  Four investigative journalism, like you've seen with the Planned Parenthood videos,
[35:17.400 --> 35:21.400]  bringing them to their knees, getting all these states to defund them, saving literally
[35:21.400 --> 35:23.800]  millions of lives in the aggregate.
[35:23.800 --> 35:28.440]  He's doing the same thing with investigative journalism and helping bring down Acorn and
[35:28.440 --> 35:29.400]  so much more.
[35:29.400 --> 35:34.840]  And now we could bring down Common Core, two plus two equals five, five plus five plus
[35:34.840 --> 35:36.360]  five doesn't equal 15.
[35:36.360 --> 35:38.600]  That's actual Common Core.
[35:38.600 --> 35:44.280]  You can just type that in and pull up mainstream articles with straight faces, saying fuzzy
[35:44.280 --> 35:48.520]  math is good, two plus two equals whatever you want it to.
[35:48.520 --> 35:49.720]  This is insane.
[35:49.720 --> 35:56.040]  And he's got the teams now all over the country and all the world infiltrating these organizations.
[35:56.040 --> 36:01.320]  And James O'Keefe, and I'm honored, said, hey, I want to have you guys write an article
[36:01.320 --> 36:03.080]  about part two and come on the show.
[36:03.080 --> 36:06.200]  I promised you last year when this was going to break in December I would.
[36:06.200 --> 36:13.560]  So here it is, exclusive video textbook exec reveals greedy truth behind Common Core.
[36:13.560 --> 36:15.720]  It's never about the kids.
[36:15.720 --> 36:18.320]  There's quote, always money in it.
[36:18.320 --> 36:20.840]  And then there's quotes in here like, I hate kids.
[36:20.840 --> 36:23.160]  It's all about the money.
[36:23.160 --> 36:25.560]  This is what we're getting out of these people.
[36:25.560 --> 36:29.200]  We're going to play some of these clips, but to give us the details and where all this
[36:29.200 --> 36:34.760]  is going is James O'Keefe joining us via video Skype again if you're a radio listener.
[36:34.760 --> 36:39.560]  You can also tune in infowars.com forward slash show and you can see the live video
[36:39.560 --> 36:40.560]  fee.
[36:40.560 --> 36:41.560]  We're also a television transmission.
[36:41.560 --> 36:46.200]  Well, James, I tell you, you just keep getting bigger and bigger coups.
[36:46.200 --> 36:49.960]  I don't know how you do it with your wonderful folks, but congratulations.
[36:49.960 --> 36:56.120]  I wonder if this over the top shocking arrogance of these people will help put a dent in Common
[36:56.120 --> 37:01.480]  Core or will they just continue to force feed us this mind wrecking garbage?
[37:01.480 --> 37:05.560]  Well, I think, thank you, Alex, for having me on and as promised, I'm back on because
[37:05.560 --> 37:08.160]  I told you in December we'd have a big story.
[37:08.160 --> 37:13.360]  And we did release the first installment on Tuesday showing a woman named Diane Barrow
[37:13.360 --> 37:15.400]  of Houghton, Mifflin.
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.640]  This is one of the big publishers, the Common Core publishers, and she said that she hates
[37:19.640 --> 37:20.640]  kids.
[37:20.640 --> 37:22.080]  It's all about the money.
[37:22.080 --> 37:26.000]  She actually said, quote, you don't think that educational publishing companies are in
[37:26.000 --> 37:27.600]  it for education, do you?
[37:27.600 --> 37:28.840]  No, they're in it for the money.
[37:28.840 --> 37:31.000]  So it's really about the money and I hate kids.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.440]  Now Houghton, Mifflin has fired this top executive.
[37:34.440 --> 37:35.600]  You see the picture of her right there.
[37:35.600 --> 37:37.080]  She looks like Corella DeVille.
[37:37.080 --> 37:38.080]  I hate kids.
[37:38.080 --> 37:39.080]  I'm in it to sell books.
[37:39.080 --> 37:40.600]  Don't kid yourself for a heartbeat.
[37:40.600 --> 37:45.280]  They have fired this individual, Pearson, which is a billion-dollar corporation that
[37:45.280 --> 37:48.800]  gets most of its money through contracts with the government, has responded.
[37:48.800 --> 37:52.400]  They condemn these comments and they quickly threw under the bus.
[37:52.400 --> 37:58.200]  So today on your website, InfoWars, we released part two, which is another official.
[37:58.200 --> 38:00.200]  This woman's name is Amelia Petty.
[38:00.200 --> 38:05.640]  She's a senior executive and she says, quote, it's never about the kids, unquote.
[38:05.640 --> 38:09.800]  And she says that she can slap stuff on books.
[38:09.800 --> 38:11.040]  There's some expletives here.
[38:11.040 --> 38:12.040]  She curses.
[38:12.040 --> 38:16.280]  She says that she can just repurpose and repackage these books to make money.
[38:16.280 --> 38:18.760]  It's all a money-making scheme.
[38:18.760 --> 38:21.880]  And we haven't even gotten into the ideology yet.
[38:21.880 --> 38:26.640]  We haven't gotten into data collection or ideology or how they're trying to bring
[38:26.640 --> 38:31.840]  our children right now or focus on the crony capitalism, the greed, and these companies
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.400]  working with the government to force textbooks on kids.
[38:36.400 --> 38:41.160]  And these statements, I think, Alex, this can kind of change the Overton window on this
[38:41.160 --> 38:42.160]  subject.
[38:42.160 --> 38:46.960]  This can really change public perception if we can make these two officials the face
[38:46.960 --> 38:48.200]  of Common Core.
[38:48.200 --> 38:50.560]  Now, we've got some of these clips.
[38:50.560 --> 38:54.680]  We're going to play in a few minutes, but the full video is up at infowars.com.
[38:54.680 --> 38:57.920]  It's also up at projectveritas.com.
[38:57.920 --> 39:01.080]  And undoubtedly, some other folks are probably going to get in trouble for this.
[39:01.080 --> 39:09.680]  But how could you put out textbooks scrambling brains, lowering people's cognitive curve,
[39:09.680 --> 39:11.600]  and then not hate kids?
[39:11.600 --> 39:17.160]  Just over and over again, the arrogance of these people, when you go in to the acorn
[39:17.160 --> 39:21.560]  facilities, and over and over again, they're like, yeah, bring in your sex-slave children.
[39:21.560 --> 39:23.240]  Just make sure you pay your taxes.
[39:23.240 --> 39:27.120]  I mean, it's just such a warped mindset of these people.
[39:27.120 --> 39:28.120]  It is.
[39:28.120 --> 39:30.640]  And this is not surprising, right?
[39:30.640 --> 39:31.640]  This is not...
[39:31.640 --> 39:32.640]  No one is shot.
[39:32.640 --> 39:35.560]  We've been working with the grassroots for about a week on preparing for these releases.
[39:35.560 --> 39:36.560]  No one is surprised.
[39:36.560 --> 39:38.720]  But finally, we have visual proof.
[39:38.720 --> 39:40.960]  Common Core is a very complicated subject matter.
[39:40.960 --> 39:43.480]  There's a lot going on here.
[39:43.480 --> 39:50.240]  It's an initiative by the federal government to force states to require testing measures.
[39:50.240 --> 39:54.280]  And these testing measures are compulsory.
[39:54.280 --> 39:56.760]  So people say, well, these are just companies trying to make a profit.
[39:56.760 --> 39:59.160]  No, they're actually working in tandem with the government.
[39:59.160 --> 40:00.160]  They hire lobbyists.
[40:00.160 --> 40:04.600]  They spend millions of dollars on lobbyists to require the government to change their
[40:04.600 --> 40:07.000]  policies so they can sell more books.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.200]  And that's really what this is all about.
[40:09.200 --> 40:15.320]  It's a money-making scheme behind the scenes to try to enrich these companies.
[40:15.320 --> 40:17.520]  And these executives don't care about ideology.
[40:17.520 --> 40:23.000]  I mean, there is one clip in the first video where Diane Barrow, this is the first official
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.480]  who lost her job, talks about homeschooling children.
[40:26.480 --> 40:31.320]  And she says, I'm sorry, did you go to school to be a teacher?
[40:31.320 --> 40:32.600]  Don't teach your kids.
[40:32.600 --> 40:37.000]  So there is sort of a mentality from a lot of these officials that the state is more
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.560]  important than the family.
[40:38.560 --> 40:41.680]  And parents shouldn't have a role in teaching their kids.
[40:41.680 --> 40:43.040]  There's a comment about Trump.
[40:43.040 --> 40:48.200]  They say that it's about old white men that are frustrated with their life.
[40:48.200 --> 40:54.600]  There is a comment about, most of the comments so far in our two videos are about just unbridled
[40:54.600 --> 40:55.760]  greed.
[40:55.760 --> 41:02.120]  It's about making money, lobbying the government, and that's about it, and it has nothing to
[41:02.120 --> 41:03.120]  do with children.
[41:03.120 --> 41:09.400]  Well, how could you put out textbooks, two plus two equals five, stuff like this fuzzy
[41:09.400 --> 41:12.080]  math, and not hate everybody?
[41:12.080 --> 41:15.400]  And then they call us evil because we don't want to screw kids up.
[41:15.400 --> 41:16.520]  Or we're evil.
[41:16.520 --> 41:19.920]  All these videos of these rich women, and I'm not signaling on women, but that's who seems
[41:19.920 --> 41:25.840]  to run so much of this new evil, drinking $100 bottle of wine, eating fine meals, debating
[41:25.840 --> 41:30.200]  body part sales of children, and snickering about Lamborghinis and stuff.
[41:30.200 --> 41:32.200]  I mean, it's just, it's so sick.
[41:32.200 --> 41:34.240]  It is sick.
[41:34.240 --> 41:35.240]  It's very sick.
[41:35.240 --> 41:37.000]  And sometimes Alex, that's where it takes.
[41:37.000 --> 41:42.920]  You know, Saul Linsky is someone who Obama and Hillary Clinton used as a mentor, and
[41:42.920 --> 41:46.720]  he was fond of saying, pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, polarize it.
[41:46.720 --> 41:51.120]  Well, in this case, we have this albatross common core with its tentative goals and all
[41:51.120 --> 41:52.640]  types of things.
[41:52.640 --> 41:55.880]  Some people talk about the connection to Bill Gates and the data collection.
[41:55.880 --> 42:00.720]  Some people talk about the critical race theory that's being instituted in mathematics.
[42:00.720 --> 42:05.640]  What we found is that they changed the math standards because they want to transform the
[42:05.640 --> 42:09.480]  process so that it's unintelligible to parents.
[42:09.480 --> 42:11.200]  They're taking away power from families.
[42:11.200 --> 42:15.720]  They're taking away power from who has the power currently, and they're giving it to
[42:15.720 --> 42:16.720]  these teachers.
[42:16.720 --> 42:20.360]  But right now, what we found, like I said, is unbridled greed.
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.960]  I mean, I don't know what's more outrageous than I hate kids.
[42:24.960 --> 42:25.960]  This is not about that.
[42:25.960 --> 42:26.960]  It's never about that.
[42:26.960 --> 42:31.440]  By the way, let's play that executive that you released on Tuesday, DrudgeReport.com,
[42:31.440 --> 42:35.520]  and of course, ProjectVeritas.com got picked up by newspapers all over the world.
[42:35.520 --> 42:38.640]  And some liberal groups are even defending it, saying, oh, we're just joking.
[42:38.640 --> 42:40.120]  No, you're not just joking.
[42:40.120 --> 42:42.640]  You want to turn them into mindless zombies to serve you.
[42:42.640 --> 42:45.160]  It's all part of your sickening operation.
[42:45.160 --> 42:46.160]  Let's go to that clip.
[42:46.160 --> 42:47.160]  It's all about the money.
[42:47.160 --> 42:48.160]  What are you, crazy?
[42:48.160 --> 42:49.160]  It's all about the money.
[42:49.160 --> 42:56.160]  You don't think that the educational publishing companies are in it for education, do you?
[42:56.160 --> 42:57.160]  No.
[42:57.160 --> 42:58.160]  They're in it for the money.
[42:58.160 --> 43:05.640]  The publishing companies are the winners in this game.
[43:05.640 --> 43:06.640]  Is that true?
[43:06.640 --> 43:07.640]  Is there money that goes in between?
[43:07.640 --> 43:08.640]  Yeah.
[43:08.640 --> 43:09.640]  Between the publishing companies and the schools?
[43:09.640 --> 43:10.640]  Oh my God.
[43:10.640 --> 43:11.640]  It's all a money game.
[43:11.640 --> 43:12.640]  It's all a money game.
[43:12.640 --> 43:13.640]  You seem like you're in it for the kids, though.
[43:13.640 --> 43:14.640]  You seem like, you know...
[43:14.640 --> 43:15.640]  I mean, I don't...
[43:15.640 --> 43:16.640]  I hate kids.
[43:16.640 --> 43:17.640]  Maybe.
[43:17.640 --> 43:18.640]  I mean, it's so gross.
[43:18.640 --> 43:19.640]  Don't even kid yourself.
[43:19.640 --> 43:20.640]  I hate kids.
[43:20.640 --> 43:21.640]  I hate kids.
[43:21.640 --> 43:22.640]  I hate kids.
[43:22.640 --> 43:23.640]  I hate kids.
[43:23.640 --> 43:24.640]  I hate kids.
[43:24.640 --> 43:28.640]  I hate kids.
[43:28.640 --> 43:29.640]  Okay.
[43:29.640 --> 43:32.880]  That's projectveritas.com.
[43:32.880 --> 43:35.360]  See the full sickening video, folks.
[43:35.360 --> 43:36.360]  Let's go to the next one.
[43:36.360 --> 43:38.360]  This is the new one exclusively released at infowars.com.
[43:38.360 --> 43:39.360]  There's a lot more.
[43:39.360 --> 43:45.760]  This is a short segment, top publishing exec, quote, it's never about kids, and this is
[43:45.760 --> 43:46.760]  just amazing.
[43:46.760 --> 43:50.680]  Now, describe this clip first for us and what the full clip covers, Mr. O'Keefe.
[43:50.680 --> 43:51.680]  Yeah.
[43:51.680 --> 43:52.680]  Thanks, Alex.
[43:52.680 --> 43:54.160]  So this is Amelia Pettis.
[43:54.160 --> 43:56.160]  She's the account executive.
[43:56.160 --> 43:59.040]  She's a senior executive at Houghton Mifflin, the book publisher.
[43:59.040 --> 44:04.960]  Houghton Mifflin works to institute the Common Core Standards, and she's talking to one
[44:04.960 --> 44:10.560]  of our undercover reporters who's posing as a lobbyist with clients in government.
[44:10.560 --> 44:14.640]  And we're trying to work out a Clidpro quo type of arrangement.
[44:14.640 --> 44:18.120]  And Amelia Pettis of Houghton Mifflin says, it's never about the kids.
[44:18.120 --> 44:19.880]  I hope they slap...
[44:19.880 --> 44:24.140]  And she says, expletive, I hope they slap stuff on the book.
[44:24.140 --> 44:25.520]  And repurpose these books.
[44:25.520 --> 44:27.960]  It's basically the same thing.
[44:27.960 --> 44:31.320]  Let's just slap stuff on it because it's never about the kids.
[44:31.320 --> 44:37.520]  And she's talking about this whole Common Core, which they repurpose books and they
[44:37.520 --> 44:42.880]  put stuff in the books that doesn't even matter, and it's not about the substance of the education.
[44:42.880 --> 44:47.200]  It's about profiting off of this business arrangement that she has with these government
[44:47.200 --> 44:48.200]  entities.
[44:48.200 --> 44:50.320]  And we're going to play this clip in just a moment, but I just want to add something
[44:50.320 --> 44:51.320]  here.
[44:51.320 --> 44:55.160]  There's the executives, and they're going along with it.
[44:55.160 --> 44:59.760]  They're just being told what to do and to adopt this curricula and then put it into
[44:59.760 --> 45:00.760]  books.
[45:00.760 --> 45:01.760]  So they're just mercenaries.
[45:01.760 --> 45:02.760]  They're just like, screw the kids.
[45:02.760 --> 45:03.760]  I hate them.
[45:03.760 --> 45:04.760]  Big deal.
[45:04.760 --> 45:05.760]  You know, it's all about money.
[45:05.760 --> 45:10.240]  But then you go above that, the social engineers, they admit it's about dumbing down.
[45:10.240 --> 45:14.120]  So we're seeing this from a high level perspective, but not the highest level.
[45:14.120 --> 45:15.240]  And that was my question for you.
[45:15.240 --> 45:16.240]  Do you agree?
[45:16.240 --> 45:20.280]  I mean, we have so many documents where they say it, but that the goal is the dumbing
[45:20.280 --> 45:22.200]  down of the country.
[45:22.200 --> 45:23.840]  I think that's probably correct.
[45:23.840 --> 45:28.840]  You know, people have talked about individuals to try to speak with people in the government.
[45:28.840 --> 45:33.040]  Coleman is the guy who wrote these standards, and we were not able to get in touch with
[45:33.040 --> 45:35.320]  him or sit down with him and talk to him about what he believes.
[45:35.320 --> 45:40.920]  But the funny thing I think is that Pearson, Pearson's a billion-dollar company, and I think
[45:40.920 --> 45:44.920]  you can't consider what Coleman is doing or even Bill Gates is doing without considering
[45:44.920 --> 45:45.920]  these companies.
[45:45.920 --> 45:52.040]  It's a major, major corporate operation, I mean, Pearson education has made billions
[45:52.040 --> 45:53.560]  of dollars off Common Core.
[45:53.560 --> 45:54.560]  That's right.
[45:54.560 --> 45:55.720]  And let's expand on that.
[45:55.720 --> 45:58.480]  Bill Gates is heavily involved in the takeover of education.
[45:58.480 --> 46:00.960]  I don't know if they're independent school districts, no.
[46:00.960 --> 46:06.120]  And the media doesn't talk about it, but he's as liberal and globalist as Hillary Clinton
[46:06.120 --> 46:07.120]  or worse.
[46:07.120 --> 46:08.760]  I mean, he is super bad news.
[46:08.760 --> 46:11.280]  He gives money to gun control, you name it.
[46:11.280 --> 46:15.320]  So Pearson responded, I would oppressorily, saying, quote, the comments in this video
[46:15.320 --> 46:18.680]  in no way represent Pearson's values or business practices.
[46:18.680 --> 46:21.480]  They are offensive to our 40,000 employees, et cetera.
[46:21.480 --> 46:25.960]  So they fired this Diane Barrow individual for telling the truth.
[46:25.960 --> 46:26.960]  She's telling the truth.
[46:26.960 --> 46:29.440]  She's not misrepresenting the company.
[46:29.440 --> 46:35.200]  This is what all these executives feel and say, now, we haven't gotten a reaction from
[46:35.200 --> 46:37.360]  Houghton Mifflin for the one released on your site.
[46:37.360 --> 46:43.640]  But their Twitter is HMHCO, Houghton Mifflin Hardcore, HMHCO.
[46:43.640 --> 46:47.040]  So if you want to tweet at them and say, hey, what's going on with your second executive?
[46:47.040 --> 46:48.040]  Does she still have her job?
[46:48.040 --> 46:51.080]  Are they going to fire everyone in the company for telling the truth?
[46:51.080 --> 46:53.720]  Because the truth is they don't like kids.
[46:53.720 --> 47:01.680]  This clip is Amelia Petty, strategic account executive for the company Huffington Mifflin
[47:01.680 --> 47:06.160]  Hardcore, who told undercover journalists with Project Veritas that rebranding Common
[47:06.160 --> 47:08.720]  Core would, quote, generate huge profits.
[47:08.720 --> 47:09.720]  Kids be damned.
[47:09.720 --> 47:10.720]  Let's play part of the clip.
[47:10.720 --> 47:16.720]  There's always money in it because kids are great, but it's not always about kids.
[47:16.720 --> 47:18.720]  It's never about the kids.
[47:18.720 --> 47:26.120]  It's lapping a new name on it, which in my case, I hope they do, because that I can
[47:26.120 --> 47:28.720]  sell a ton of training around whatever you're calling it.
[47:28.720 --> 47:33.400]  If it does change, there's still money in it because it's the same style.
[47:33.400 --> 47:34.400]  It's always money.
[47:34.400 --> 47:36.400]  It's never about the kids.
[47:36.400 --> 47:42.400]  And then she's smiling and laughing as well, and again, I'm not a woman basher, but there's
[47:42.400 --> 47:45.280]  this idea in liberal culture that we put women in charge.
[47:45.280 --> 47:49.040]  They're these wonderful, altruistic people, all war will end.
[47:49.040 --> 47:51.120]  And then you see who's running the State Department, all these new wars.
[47:51.120 --> 47:52.960]  It's just women are just like men.
[47:52.960 --> 47:53.960]  They can be evil.
[47:53.960 --> 47:54.960]  They can be corrupt.
[47:54.960 --> 47:55.960]  They can be arrogant.
[47:55.960 --> 47:58.840]  They can be, and it's just, I'm sorry, I'm seeing a theme here, though, in your videos
[47:58.840 --> 48:04.240]  and other videos undercover, where it's just like women, like the acorn thing going, yeah,
[48:04.240 --> 48:05.640]  bring in the child sex slaves.
[48:05.640 --> 48:06.640]  Yeah, it's wonderful.
[48:06.640 --> 48:07.960]  I mean, somebody said that to me.
[48:07.960 --> 48:10.360]  I would tackle them and call the police, you know?
[48:10.360 --> 48:13.480]  Yeah, the appropriate response is get out of my office, right?
[48:13.480 --> 48:14.480]  Yeah.
[48:14.480 --> 48:20.080]  In the Planned Parenthood video, the official said, I want to buy a Lamborghini.
[48:20.080 --> 48:27.720]  When I get reimbursed or when I sell these baby tissue or fetal parts, I mean, this is
[48:27.720 --> 48:30.640]  a culture of kind of soullessness from these people.
[48:30.640 --> 48:32.840]  And the sad thing is they're doing it with your dime.
[48:32.840 --> 48:35.320]  Now, we had a lot of critics say, well, these are just capitalists.
[48:35.320 --> 48:36.680]  You're just trying to make sell books.
[48:36.680 --> 48:39.720]  I said, no, because they're forcing you to buy the books.
[48:39.720 --> 48:40.720]  This is not a choice.
[48:40.720 --> 48:45.520]  They've created a government monopoly, federalizing, internationalizing, this is all about UNESCO
[48:45.520 --> 48:46.520]  and the UN.
[48:46.520 --> 48:47.520]  Exactly.
[48:47.520 --> 48:48.520]  This is the eye.
[48:48.520 --> 48:49.520]  This is crony capitalism.
[48:49.520 --> 48:51.240]  It's crony capitalism.
[48:51.240 --> 48:54.320]  It's compulsory because they have to buy the books.
[48:54.320 --> 48:57.760]  There is a scheme where they hire people in the government.
[48:57.760 --> 49:00.320]  They buy people in the government.
[49:00.320 --> 49:03.240]  You're just seeing that, like you said, the front lines, the sales executives.
[49:03.240 --> 49:07.680]  I actually think that the content from the sales executives is probably more powerful
[49:07.680 --> 49:09.480]  because it's the front lines.
[49:09.480 --> 49:13.360]  With the Acorn staff, it was the people on the front lines who said, yeah, bring in
[49:13.360 --> 49:16.840]  your child hookers and let's call them dependents on the tax forms.
[49:16.840 --> 49:18.440]  And that shut the whole organization down.
[49:18.440 --> 49:23.800]  So we have an opportunity here with Common Core to put a face to a name to personalize
[49:23.800 --> 49:29.080]  and personify the subject so that people can finally see what this program is about.
[49:29.080 --> 49:30.520]  Now, this is just part one.
[49:30.520 --> 49:37.680]  We have more coming on the ideology, on the critical race theory, on the standards, on
[49:37.680 --> 49:40.240]  some of the mathematics curriculum and what that means.
[49:40.240 --> 49:43.040]  But right now, we're focused more on the cronyism.
[49:43.040 --> 49:47.280]  So to be clear, this is just part of your undercover investigation.
[49:47.280 --> 49:48.280]  Wow.
[49:48.280 --> 49:50.160]  I mean, you do so much dangerous stuff.
[49:50.160 --> 49:51.840]  I mean, I'm sorry, I'm just gushing.
[49:51.840 --> 49:55.880]  But I don't think some of the viewers and listeners understand how dangerous what you
[49:55.880 --> 50:00.080]  do is and how incredible your investigators are and what you've gone through.
[50:00.080 --> 50:02.920]  How do folks support Project Veritas?
[50:02.920 --> 50:07.080]  We don't have many allies in the media, you know, Alex, I saw your interview with Matt
[50:07.080 --> 50:08.080]  Drudge.
[50:08.080 --> 50:09.840]  I consider him a hero of mine.
[50:09.840 --> 50:14.240]  There are very few people who can take on these types of interests because there's so
[50:14.240 --> 50:15.240]  many people involved.
[50:15.240 --> 50:18.160]  You've got corporations, you've got politicians.
[50:18.160 --> 50:21.240]  We're literally putting this stuff on YouTube and social media.
[50:21.240 --> 50:23.640]  And we got Pearson to respond.
[50:23.640 --> 50:25.920]  They're firing their officials right now.
[50:25.920 --> 50:32.960]  If you tweet at HMHCo, HMHCO and say, what's the status of your executive?
[50:32.960 --> 50:34.200]  She's still employed.
[50:34.200 --> 50:36.920]  You can contact us at projectveritas.com.
[50:36.920 --> 50:43.120]  Last time I went on your show, we had 150, 150 people contacted us wanting to be reporters.
[50:43.120 --> 50:44.920]  We are creating an army of people.
[50:44.920 --> 50:48.600]  We are creating an undercover army of citizen journalists.
[50:48.600 --> 50:51.600]  We got a former Navy SEAL guy running our field ops.
[50:51.600 --> 50:58.520]  We got former intelligence people working with us now, doing journalism, doing investigative
[50:58.520 --> 51:00.440]  journalism, exposing the government.
[51:00.440 --> 51:05.120]  So you can contact us at projectveritas.com and we have many more videos on this subject
[51:05.120 --> 51:06.120]  coming out.
[51:06.120 --> 51:10.280]  And what we do is we force them to respond, we make the Washington Post, this made the
[51:10.280 --> 51:14.440]  Washington Post, the mainstream media is forced to cover it because of the reactions
[51:14.440 --> 51:16.520]  from the organizations that we investigate.
[51:16.520 --> 51:20.560]  And then it's info wars, it's Drudge, it's WorldNet Daily and others, not that you don't
[51:20.560 --> 51:23.160]  have your own great platform that magnify what you're doing.
[51:23.160 --> 51:25.560]  I tell you, I sleep better at night knowing you're there.
[51:25.560 --> 51:27.280]  We could set up undercover operations.
[51:27.280 --> 51:32.440]  We've done some, we've got such infiltration problems and other clandestine things we deal
[51:32.440 --> 51:37.680]  with obviously because we're so big and literal wars with the White House, it's unbelievable.
[51:37.680 --> 51:41.280]  But it's an honor to go through what we go through, I know it's an honor for you as well.
[51:41.280 --> 51:42.520]  It's great to have you out there.
[51:42.520 --> 51:46.960]  It's great to send our listeners to you and say, join with Veritas, they're great people
[51:46.960 --> 51:48.920]  because we're in a war.
[51:48.920 --> 51:52.720]  And we need more commanders, more soldiers, more operatives.
[51:52.720 --> 51:57.200]  And again, I tell the military, the former intelligence people, the current FBI, everybody,
[51:57.200 --> 52:00.560]  local police, and they're actually getting involved as well, hey, this is the real battle
[52:00.560 --> 52:01.560]  for the Republic.
[52:01.560 --> 52:05.880]  I mean, you want to fight overseas, America's being taken down and they're responding and
[52:05.880 --> 52:10.840]  that's what's making the system so scared, that's why the NSA is spying on veterans and
[52:10.840 --> 52:12.680]  former intelligence operatives and stuff.
[52:12.680 --> 52:16.200]  And they know they're being spied on and they don't care they are because the enemy's
[52:16.200 --> 52:22.320]  minions are so lazy and stupid, even when it's in the known database that patriots are
[52:22.320 --> 52:27.560]  going after globalists legally and lawfully with the power of the pen and the video camera,
[52:27.560 --> 52:28.560]  they don't even respond.
[52:28.560 --> 52:32.080]  It's like I snuck into Bohemian Grove, more than 15 journalists have been arrested, they
[52:32.080 --> 52:36.760]  couldn't do it by the grace of God I got in, but they were mainstream media.
[52:36.760 --> 52:38.840]  We do have luck with us, right?
[52:38.840 --> 52:43.080]  You said the luck of the Irish, whatever, God's on our side, there is Providence, George Washington
[52:43.080 --> 52:47.440]  talked about it, but we have to get on the field, but when we get on the field, everything
[52:47.440 --> 52:49.640]  we do turns to gold.
[52:49.640 --> 52:51.960]  I mean, have you not experienced this yourself?
[52:51.960 --> 52:53.680]  I do.
[52:53.680 --> 52:58.400]  You mentioned something that I think is very telling, you know, going overseas and risking
[52:58.400 --> 53:02.880]  your life for a country, there's no way that any of my guys could compare to that type of
[53:02.880 --> 53:07.560]  sacrifice that our soldiers make, but I do think that people need to risk their lives
[53:07.560 --> 53:14.480]  domestically, people need to put their reputation on the line to do this type of journalism.
[53:14.480 --> 53:19.440]  And I emulate the sacrifice that our soldiers make overseas, but can you think of anybody
[53:19.440 --> 53:25.240]  right now, maybe one or two people, but anybody in Washington DC or in Congress who are willing
[53:25.240 --> 53:28.840]  to sacrifice the reputations for the betterment of their country?
[53:28.840 --> 53:32.640]  And this type of journalism, I mean, I don't have to tell you, I mean, I've been arrested,
[53:32.640 --> 53:37.000]  I've been, like every time I go to the airport, every time I come back into the United States,
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.400]  I get detained by the Department of Homeland Security and they ask me what stories I'm
[53:41.400 --> 53:42.400]  working on.
[53:42.400 --> 53:48.480]  They go through my cell phone, these are relatively inconveniences, but, you know, you go through
[53:48.480 --> 53:53.360]  hell to doing this work, but they can stop one man, but they can't stop all of us.
[53:53.360 --> 53:57.240]  Well, James, all over the third world, an old world journalist or kill all the time,
[53:57.240 --> 54:01.720]  it happens here too, and I'm not likening what you did, you know, the guys that Benghazi
[54:01.720 --> 54:03.920]  giving up their lives, those are real heroes.
[54:03.920 --> 54:08.520]  But if we don't push and fight here, it's going to get to that level and the harassment,
[54:08.520 --> 54:14.040]  the attacks, the legal stuff, all of it, what we're doing is humant, human intelligence
[54:14.040 --> 54:16.040]  fighting this globalist takeover on the ground.
[54:16.040 --> 54:20.640]  And I was just saying, that's why you have so many, you know, Navy SEALs, Patriots, former
[54:20.640 --> 54:25.480]  CIA people, you name it, helping you now because they really realize the fight is here on the
[54:25.480 --> 54:29.840]  home front against this Saul Olensky leftist globalist takeover.
[54:29.840 --> 54:33.680]  And I'm not left wing or right wing, I'm a libertarian, but the takeover is happening
[54:33.680 --> 54:36.720]  through the left, they're making their move.
[54:36.720 --> 54:40.680]  And so this is historic, and I'm just letting folks know, like Uncle Sam, I need you for
[54:40.680 --> 54:41.680]  the info war.
[54:41.680 --> 54:44.520]  And you don't even have to go with O'Keeffe or info wars or anything.
[54:44.520 --> 54:50.080]  Get a video camera, read his book, copy our tactics, make your own tactics, go in, talk
[54:50.080 --> 54:55.400]  to folks, they'll spew all this stuff, criminals love to brag, and then put it out on YouTube,
[54:55.400 --> 54:56.400]  we'll pick it up.
[54:56.400 --> 54:59.920]  I mean, it just don't wait for orders from headquarters, folks, to quote some of the
[54:59.920 --> 55:04.760]  revolutionary, what General Green, go to the sound of the guns, brother, closing comments
[55:04.760 --> 55:06.800]  in the two minutes we have left.
[55:06.800 --> 55:10.080]  I mean, I think you're right, I think the battle is on the home front.
[55:10.080 --> 55:14.520]  The war is, the war is in the media, Breitbart said the media is everything.
[55:14.520 --> 55:18.880]  And while Saul Olensky is a, was a left wing organizer, I think you can learn a lot from
[55:18.880 --> 55:19.880]  him.
[55:19.880 --> 55:23.720]  I mean, a tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag, make them live up to their own book
[55:23.720 --> 55:24.720]  of rules.
[55:24.720 --> 55:26.720]  We got to let their words do the talking here.
[55:26.720 --> 55:31.760]  And the battle is on, is the United States, this is an election year, this is an important
[55:31.760 --> 55:38.920]  year, expose the fraud, join Project Veritas, become a citizen journalist, don't be afraid,
[55:38.920 --> 55:43.080]  we have resources to help protect you, and stay tuned for video number three.
[55:43.080 --> 55:49.440]  And if you can, tweet at HMHCO, that's out in Nifflin, HMHCO, and ask them what is the
[55:49.440 --> 55:54.160]  status of their executive who said, quote, it's never about the kids, common core is,
[55:54.160 --> 55:56.640]  quote, never about the kids.
[55:56.640 --> 55:57.640]  Thank you very much.
[55:57.640 --> 56:01.600]  I'll tell you, James O'Keeffe, projectveritas.com, devastating job.
[56:01.600 --> 56:03.800]  Thank you for working with us and others.
[56:03.800 --> 56:06.440]  You're just a model of taking action.
[56:06.440 --> 56:07.440]  Godspeed.
[56:07.440 --> 56:08.440]  Godspeed.
[56:08.440 --> 56:12.240]  And I want to be clear because I get so excited about the epic battle that I, I think it's
[56:12.240 --> 56:13.240]  fun.
[56:13.240 --> 56:14.240]  There's some scary stuff going on.
[56:14.240 --> 56:15.240]  Absolutely.
[56:15.240 --> 56:17.760]  For ground level people, it's very, very safe.
[56:17.760 --> 56:21.400]  What's dangerous is not fighting the globalist, what's dangerous is not exposing them.
[56:21.400 --> 56:26.880]  But for a James O'Keeffe, a Matt Drudge, and Alex Jones, a Joseph Farrah, for people
[56:26.880 --> 56:30.360]  at that level, believe me, there's stuff going on behind the scenes.
[56:30.360 --> 56:32.080]  And I'm not at liberty to get into a hole of it.
[56:32.080 --> 56:34.440]  I'm not going to talk about what I go through.
[56:34.440 --> 56:35.440]  It's an honor.
[56:35.440 --> 56:36.440]  I laugh at it.
[56:36.440 --> 56:37.440]  It doesn't intimidate me at all.
[56:37.440 --> 56:40.440]  It's just that you need to know, these are, these people are bad news.
[56:40.440 --> 56:43.400]  And you don't think we're going to go up against multi-billion dollar operations and bloody
[56:43.400 --> 56:48.600]  their noses and sometimes blow them wide open and crush them without there being blowback.
[56:48.600 --> 56:50.280]  But we are ready for that.
[56:50.280 --> 56:52.600]  We are ready and committed.
[56:52.600 --> 56:56.280]  And let me tell you, Providence leans towards those that are committed in our cowards and
[56:56.280 --> 56:58.080]  on the side of right.
[56:58.080 --> 56:59.680]  And that's our greatest power.
[56:59.680 --> 57:02.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to just briefly let you know we're running a special that
[57:02.920 --> 57:07.040]  we only ran one time last year.
[57:07.040 --> 57:08.560]  Storeable foods are flying off the shelves.
[57:08.560 --> 57:14.080]  We have the highest quality at InfoWars Select, InfoWarsSelect.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[57:14.080 --> 57:21.960]  It's just my Patriots supply discounted, but on both my Patriots supply and on also InfoWarsSelect,
[57:21.960 --> 57:27.880]  we have got 30 to 40% off all InfoWarsSelect storeable foods at InfoWarsStore.com for the
[57:27.880 --> 57:28.880]  next 24 hours.
[57:28.880 --> 57:31.280]  And this is from the manufacturer.
[57:31.280 --> 57:37.320]  It's all quality, all, you know, super clean, good food, you know, made fresh every week,
[57:37.320 --> 57:43.520]  best containers, you name it, lowest price you'll find, InfoWarsStore.com.

[57:49.280 --> 57:54.520]  live events, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWarsStore.com, that ends next Monday.
[57:54.520 --> 57:55.520]  It's over.
[57:55.520 --> 58:00.280]  Superfumovitality out for over a month and a half is back, amazing game changer.
[58:00.280 --> 58:01.280]  Just try a bottle.
[58:01.280 --> 58:03.240]  We have Superfumovitality as well.
[58:03.240 --> 58:05.200]  And we have another big special.
[58:05.200 --> 58:11.640]  We're running by survival shield, nascent iodine X2, the good halogen, the opposite of fluoride,
[58:11.640 --> 58:17.800]  so imagine what that does, and get SilverBullet, super high quality, 30 parts per million,
[58:17.800 --> 58:26.480]  colloidal silver, half off that special, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or PrisonPlanet.tv,
[58:26.480 --> 58:27.480]  specials across the board.
[58:27.480 --> 58:31.040]  But regardless, they're high quality products, but even if they weren't, they're great.
[58:31.040 --> 58:32.040]  You need them.
[58:32.040 --> 58:33.040]  It doesn't matter.
[58:33.040 --> 58:37.400]  You're funding a committed operation going in on a kamikaze attack against the globalist.
[58:37.400 --> 58:42.240]  We're not backing down, we're at 110%, defending the Republic toe to toe.
[58:42.240 --> 58:43.240]  We need your help.
[58:43.240 --> 58:44.400]  You are the solution.
[58:44.400 --> 58:45.800]  You are the resistance.
[58:45.800 --> 58:49.080]  You are the answer.
[58:49.080 --> 58:50.560]  Clean pure drinking water.
[58:50.560 --> 58:52.080]  You can't survive without it.
[58:52.080 --> 58:53.200]  But where do you get it?
[58:53.200 --> 58:58.200]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is
[58:58.200 --> 58:59.200]  like no other.
[58:59.200 --> 59:04.520]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking
[59:04.520 --> 59:09.680]  water, pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with
[59:09.680 --> 59:11.400]  a hybrochromatic shell.

[59:51.480 --> 01:00:12.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:17.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:24.040]  If you want to stop tyranny, well, so does he, live from the InfoWars.com studio, it's
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:30.640]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:36.640]  During that 72nd break, Anthony Gucciardi came in and dropped some incredible info on
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.640]  me.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:43.520]  There's a very famous Special Forces operator that still is in the Army.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.520]  He's famous.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:49.680]  He has TV shows, things like that, and he's a listener of the show, and I've got to know
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:54.400]  him as of the last month or two.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.480]  He was already coming into the office today just to talk about general things that are
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:04.160]  going on, and then he just told Anthony he's going to talk about it.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:17.160]  Starting with Isis, right here in Texas, and the specifics of Isis coming to kill him.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:23.920]  The interesting thing about this is, this is happening to more and more people, and
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.480]  Isis is absolutely operating all over the world.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.960]  You saw him just attack Indonesia.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:35.160]  I live in the Twilight Zone episode, it's just incredible.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.160]  That's what I'm telling O'Keeffe.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.600]  I'm like, no, O'Keeffe, you're in the war, buddy.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.240]  This is it, here in the Republic.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:48.200]  You got these criminals that are basically like Spectre, and that's, you know, MI6 approves
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:53.880]  those James Bond scripts, and the latest one, the Quantum Group is the group that turns
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.720]  out that is behind Spectre.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.840]  Well, what's the name of George Soros' group?
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.480]  It's Quantum.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:05.000]  And I know that Wayne Madsen, who has just incredible intelligence contacts, has talked
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.800]  to British Intel people, and they think Soros is basically right at the top.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.800]  Not just a general out front, a field marshal, but for whatever reason he's been given the
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800]  ball.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:23.440]  Brzezinski is a major quarterback as well, but they also pretty much coach the team.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:28.120]  And I tell you, these are bad, bad, bad people.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:35.720]  And they are sock-puppeting ISIS in Al-Qaeda and using it to take our liberties.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:42.600]  The globalists give them all these weapons, and then we have to counter them.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.680]  The military has to counter them.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:51.720]  And the military, we the American people, go out and die fighting the scum, where the
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.240]  globalists, on the other hand, are running it, and then responding with the other hand
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.240]  and getting total power out of the paradigm control.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:05.360]  Gerald Salente is going to be joining us for about 45 minutes, and then the last segment
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.360]  of this hour.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.080]  I'm going to air a very important report that Leigh Ann McAdoo filed.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.680]  Powerball jackpot winner announced.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.680]  That story is up on infowars.com.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.000]  And then, of course, it's a play on words.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.960]  You find out that it's the establishment that are really the winners, but she went out and
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.960]  talked to some of the folks.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:24.320]  I've got articles about families going a week without food and groceries so mama can buy
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.760]  more Powerballs.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:32.640]  And it's people like that that need to have their kids taken, in my opinion.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.160]  Not somebody who has their kids playing in the backyard.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:42.720]  Your 11-year-old comes home at four and plays basketball for two hours and forgot their key
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.520]  so they're locked outside and drinking water out of the garden hose.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:49.520]  I mean, I can't tell you how many times I got left at school for two hours when both
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.240]  my parents were busy, and I just played around the school with the library.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.680]  Or sometimes I'd get home, the key wasn't under the mat, and I'd try to climb up and
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.760]  get in a window or something, but I could not go to a friend's house when I was like
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.760]  9, 10 years old.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.480]  Now they take your kids for that, but then there's people on the news, I'm not buying
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:12.120]  groceries from, you know, I'm, it's sick, it's sick, and it's these desperate people
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.760]  that have these dreams that sit around and watch, you know, lifestyles of the rich and
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.760]  famous.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.480]  They've got all these modern shows, like all about the Kardashians, it's an hour-long
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.480]  show.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.240]  One day I was on at the gym and so I kept looking back for an hour, it would just show, here's
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.200]  this yacht, here's this car, and then for 10 minutes, here's this purse of hers, and
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:34.920]  here's that purse, and here's Kim Kardashian's closet, and it's just like, so what have you
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.520]  got 500 purses?
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:43.560]  It's sick there to make poor people feel inadequate and just drool at this crud, this absolute
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:49.880]  crap, people selling their souls, not even for material, but the idea that you've got
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:05:00.200]  so much material, our freedoms are what matters now to Alex Jones.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:06.120]  The first Republican debate of 2016 is this Thursday, January 14th, and join the InfoWars
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:11.600]  Nightly News and Prison Planet TV once again for Political Science Theater 3K.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:15.400]  The stage will be getting smaller with only six candidates making the cut, maybe seven
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.360]  if they let John Kasich slip in through the back door.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.120]  Report starts at 7pm Central on the InfoWars Nightly News, and then the debate kicks off
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.520]  at 8pm Central.

[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.720]  When's the next Democratic debate, you ask?
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.120]  Well, it's on a Sunday during the NFL playoffs, because that's when most people want to watch
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.120]  it.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.960]  It does not appear that Rand Paul is going to make the cut in this primetime debate,
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.920]  but John Kasich is?
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.480]  What is this world coming to?
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.960]  Just a little side note here, the majority of Americans polled think that Hillary Clinton
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:46.640]  should continue to run if she is indicted under this new email scandal.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:51.520]  Join us this Thursday, 7pm Central for Political Science Theater 3K.

[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.640]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.760]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040]  do it clean.

[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:16.840]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:30.240]  We have an opportunity, the puppet would be Emperor Opotus has said, hey everyone, ready
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:37.800]  to answer your questions here at McKinley High School in Baton Rouge, let's do this.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:47.200]  And ask POTUS, ASK POTUS, A is capitalized, SK isn't all of POTUS is, and so everybody
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.540]  should tweet the president, why do you lie so much about not wanting our guns?
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:55.680]  Why did you order a stand-down with Benghazi?
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.480]  Why did you help create Al Qaeda?
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.800]  Why did you order the Border Patrol to complete the smuggling process and ship illegals in?
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.000]  Why do you want to take the guns from the bitter clingers?
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.080]  Why do you want to bankrupt our economy?
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.920]  Why are you shutting down our power plants?
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:15.520]  I mean, you can think of the questions yourselves, it's just good any time they stick their heads
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:21.720]  up to hammer them and then we'll even see if they block the real questions.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.360]  That itself becomes a new story.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:30.160]  See, that's why resistance is victory, because no matter what they do, we keep coming after
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.680]  them and never stopping.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.800]  Look at these articles I mentioned last hour, I'm going to ask Gerald Salente about this.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.840]  I've got a lot, I'm going to just go through a whole bunch of stuff, I mean Gerald's got
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.040]  his trends, what he wants to break down, but I've got a lot of just quick questions to
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.680]  throw at him today.
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:48.720]  USC students required to detail sexual history before registering for classes.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.800]  Do you wear condoms?
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.280]  Are you hetero?
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.400]  Are you heterosexual?
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.400]  Do you have this sex?
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.120]  Do you have that sex?
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.000]  How many times do you have oral sex a month?
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.120]  It just goes on and on.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.600]  First it's oh, take vaccines or we won't let you in.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.120]  Now it's give us all your details.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:10.120]  I mean, you have a Fourth Amendment folks, this is what cults do.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:14.000]  This is what Skull and Bones does asking them, you know, their sexual histories.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.680]  This is what they reportedly do in cults to get control of you.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680]  It's crazy.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:24.120]  Now, obviously the big news is not big news for our listeners that derivatives are out
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.120]  of control.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.200]  The bubbles are bigger than ever.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:30.000]  They began to cut back on the quantitative easing just a little bit, raising interest
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.560]  rates a tiny bit.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:35.120]  Unlike a car running off the road, the economy started to sink.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.800]  It was already sinking.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.640]  They could see that it wasn't helping, so they started upping the interest rates a month
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:47.240]  or so ago, breaking Dow Jones loses 1,500 points in just 10 days, the worst open for
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.480]  a new year in its history.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.440]  The bursting of the bond bubble has begun.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.680]  An excellent article at Zero Hedge posted in FullWars.com.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:03.000]  Gold bounces on return of stock market volatility, but don't worry, from the refugees in Europe
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.560]  to Cuban refugees, record numbers coming in, CBS Miami, Miami-Dade School Board, preps
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:14.400]  for influx of Cuban refugees.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.320]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:22.680]  And then last hour, James O'Keefe, with these big executives at major publishing companies
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.360]  going, I hate kids, it's not about kids, it's about money.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360]  We've got our directives.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.360]  We're putting it in there.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.040]  Two plus two equals five.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.040]  It is amazing.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:38.080]  Then, next hour, Dave Agame on the RNC board, inside the move in the RNC to move forward
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:41.120]  with a call for impeachment in Congress.
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.000]  Richard Reeves and others, they're on the ground for that debate tonight with Joe Biggs.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.920]  Dan Bongino, a former top Secret Service agent, breaking down currently what's happening
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.360]  in the world, the scandals.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.440]  He would run Obama's foreign details.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.040]  He said, what I've said about Obama isn't enough.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:02.360]  He said, it's worse than you know, worse than you say, I'm a listener.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.480]  Hadn't been on this in about six months.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:08.800]  Now, he didn't give you the insight and tell that Obama is an actual practicing Muslim,
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.240]  but that's from others in other agencies.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.520]  They've seen it with their eyes.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.880]  And if he is, that's fine.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.120]  Just don't lie about it.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.200]  But you now know why he's finding the Muslim brotherhood and this jihad takeover.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.800]  I didn't believe it before.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.320]  I thought he was just roping the Muslims along when he just calls to prayer and in Egypt
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.920]  that are better than the top Imam can do.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:31.760]  But this is getting twilight zone right now.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.600]  I can't even believe it.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.120]  So that's all coming up.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:40.320]  And we've also gotten news on IRS still targeting conservative groups.
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.040]  Tell me something we don't know.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.400]  Internet set the court cut cords with the U S government this year, turn it over to
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:49.320]  the UN, see how everything's lining up folks.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.160]  Multinational's move governmental power to unelected groups.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:58.960]  IMF World Bank WTO UN then set up other agreements like the TPP linking them all together, make
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:04.560]  it secret and give it the power to levy taxes and be exempt from law.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:10.320]  The most checked out book at the UN library is their immunity.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.000]  Incredible above the law.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.600]  The white shoe boys that Gerald Salente trends research.com are good friend and of course
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.120]  publisher of the trends journal joins us.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:26.480]  Well, Gerald Obama said that there's no problems, you have the best economy in the world.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.400]  People are fear mongers that say there's any problem in our economy or others.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.520]  But his own master, Soros says the collapse has begun.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:40.520]  But as usual, the Royal Bank of Scotland Soros are saying it days before it begins, not years
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.560]  before it begins as you and others have.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.400]  They're still writing articles as you know every week saying Gerald Salente's a kook,
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:52.880]  a porn dealer of fear, so does Alex Jones because nothing bad has happened.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:58.400]  No, just everything you said has happened, thank God, a little bit later than you thought.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.320]  But I wish it would never happen, so do you.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.840]  But we're just covering fundamentals here, Gerald Salente.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:12.040]  Alex, I think Obama's quote is, I have it right here, anyone claiming that America's
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:17.560]  economy is in decline is peddling fiction.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:26.640]  This is from the greatest fraud that has ever, ever been put in the White House.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.840]  Everything that backtrack Obama promised he backtracked on.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:38.680]  And he's talking about peddling fiction, I mean this guy should be a fiction writer
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:44.640]  because nothing he ever says that when you listen to that State of the Union address,
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:51.400]  it was nothing more than a litany of lies and a string of banalities.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:15:00.280]  So this is a guy, hey, folks, first day in office, I'm going to close Guantanamo, folks,
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:05.600]  hey, folks, I'm going to pull out those troops out of Afghanistan.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:11.720]  Just after I put in 33,000 for a troop surge and lied and I'm going to pull them out and
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:22.200]  never did, peddling fiction, hey, how about this one, folks, I'm going to restore democratic
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.200]  rights.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:29.920]  Yeah, hey, look what he did to Chelsea Manning, how about that Snowden?
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:36.760]  Even after another, they put more whistleblowers in jail and shut them up than any time in
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.600]  American history.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:44.720]  This guy's talking about peddling fiction, how about peddling fiction as he's bragging
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:53.080]  about, and I have it of course right here, his line, I told you earlier all the talk
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:59.360]  of America's economic decline is political hot air, and he knows about hot air and the
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.240]  rest of them passing it out over there in Washington, they're real hot air.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.520]  And don't forget Gibb saying there is no drone program when it was a known public program
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:09.920]  for five years before that.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.040]  So let's look at the facts.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:18.840]  As he's bragging about the jobs that have been created, folks, yeah, how about the highest
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:25.920]  level of job non-participation rate since the 70s?
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:32.720]  How about all those people now you have home buying rate back into the 1960s?
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.480]  How about the three million quote missing workers?
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:42.880]  How about half the new jobs going to foreigners that are illegal?
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:43.880]  That's another one.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:49.080]  And because of course what they did is they made it easy for them to get here so they
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:54.800]  could drive down the prices by flooding the marketplace with cheap labor.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.200]  And again, let's just keep going on to the facts.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.920]  Folks, because that's what he did, he foked us in a lot of ways.
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:12.760]  And how about the one, for example, that since the Great Recession, 95% of all the wealth
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:18.960]  gain has gone to that 1%.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:25.880]  And how about as candidate Obama, he was going to promise that we're going to get those
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:32.080]  people who committed those crimes on Wall Street, and he brought in Eric Holder, yeah,
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.520]  I got something for him to hold.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.440]  How many people did he prosecute and put in jail?
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.880]  Hey, they're too big to jail.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.400]  Where did he go back to?
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:47.480]  Oh, yeah, that law firm that protects the white shoe boys.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:56.000]  That put one, and of course, they convicted, not charged, convicted, six major banks with
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:02.480]  felonies for rigging the LIBOR rates, the interest rates, the forex markets, the currency
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:10.480]  markets at a tune of $5.3 trillion a day, not one head rolled.
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:17.200]  This was a disgusting spectacle, but only really another chapter in the presidential
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.200]  reality.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.000]  That's my question for you as you continue to go through all this, Cheryl Salente of
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.920]  The Trends Journal.
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.040]  How far can it go?
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.120]  They've lost the confidence of the people.
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.960]  They're a laughing stock worldwide.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:33.200]  Everything they say is a fraud or twisted or outright lie.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:34.640]  How much further can it go?
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.600]  Because their tactic of just ball face lying isn't working anymore.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.840]  I mean, are they totally delusional?
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:45.640]  Yes, sociopaths don't admit when they lie.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.600]  Psychopaths, I mean, you want to talk about it.
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:53.520]  I want to read something, Alex, to answer your questions or put it into context and
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.960]  so many other things that you're talking about, for instance, like gun control.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:02.120]  I want to read to you when you said, are they delusional?
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.200]  This is Obama's statement the other night.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:11.880]  The United States is the most powerful nation on earth, period, period.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.320]  It's not even close.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.720]  It's not even close.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:16.280]  It's not even close.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:22.800]  We spend more on military than the next eight nations combined.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:30.600]  Now, could you imagine if that came out of the other war criminals' mouth, George W. Bush,
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:40.240]  all those Woodstock key sheeting, balsamic grin, politically correct Woodstock liberals
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:43.520]  would be screaming?
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.320]  But because it's Obama, it's A-OK, just like the NDAA, the droning, the torture, and then
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.320]  the funding of Al Qaeda.
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.320]  Boy, that's all coming out.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.400]  I want to talk election 2016 with Gerald straight ahead.

[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:36.200]  He told me he'll talk about it, he's told me he'll come on, but I'm not going to say
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:40.160]  it until it actually happens and it's important enough that I was going to have Rob Duhos

[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:49.040]  today in that fourth hour because I need him to help me get this taping done ahead of the

[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.480]  than 30 years, bestselling author joins us, trendsresearch.com.
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.440]  This is your short segment, long segment coming up, I'm going to go through a lot of news
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.440]  with him.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:19.440]  So take a few calls for your questions for Gerald Salente at 800-259-9231-800-2599231.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:24.080]  Gerald, you can get into other trends and things and other news in the next segment,
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.920]  but the short one, I know you're a political atheist, but you've worked for politicians,
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:34.200]  you were a consultant and things like that, but I mean, I guess your previous life.
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:38.080]  But in your gut and looking at it politically, who do you really like in the race?
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.240]  Do you think Trump's for real? What do you think's going to come up in the future?
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:45.640]  They look like they're getting ready to maybe dump Hillary, bring in Biden, the whole establishment's
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.280]  turning on her, or is that all just show?
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.240]  What's the inside baseball from up there in New York?
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:26:00.160]  Well, we made the forecast in the spring edition of the Trends Journal and that came out again.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:08.360]  This is April 2015 and you can see the cover. Cowards, liars, freaks and fools. It's the
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:13.880]  presidential reality show and here's our forecast and we stick with it.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:20.400]  I won't vote for any of them. But the last person I would have voted for was Ron Paul.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:26.480]  I don't vote for lesser of two evils, don't do business with them, have no relationships
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:31.880]  with them, don't invite them over. Anybody that would vote for a lesser of two evils
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.240]  to me, they're out of their minds.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:38.920]  Sure. So you think Trump is bad news or what's your view on him?
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:46.200]  Well, my view on him is that what I'm happy about is that he's shown what a freak show
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:50.800]  this thing really is. And again, we called it the presidential reality show before he
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:58.000]  got into it and he's a reality show champion. He knows, it's one of these guys, as we used
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.240]  to say in the Bronx, one on third and thought he hit a triple.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:08.160]  You know, his old man left him a lot of dough and a lot of real estate and he has this attitude.
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:14.160]  But he puts out a lot of things without having substance behind it. So he makes statements
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:24.280]  without substantive elements to bring it forward. Let me read you our forecast and why we're
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:29.080]  going to hold to it. You asked me, who's going to win? Will it be Hillary?
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:34.640]  This is again, this is April of last year. If the election were held today, we forecast
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:41.040]  Clinton as the winner. On issues of gay rights, women's rights and abortion, Cruz, Paul, Rubio,
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:45.720]  Carson, Fiorina and Huckabee will find weak support among the sizeable portion of the
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:51.960]  women voters. We go on to explain the why's. And again, this is in our position. This is
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:28:00.440]  what we're looking at. We go on to say that in the 2008 presidential election, 70.4 million
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:09.720]  women cast ballots, verse 60.7 million men in the 2012 race, Obama won the two-party
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:16.840]  vote among female voters by 12 points, 56% to 44%.
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:23.680]  What we're saying, Alex, is that Trump is going to not get the women vote. And we think
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:30.760]  Trump is the odds-on favorite of winning the Republican nomination. And we don't see Bernie
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:37.280]  Sanders overtaking Clinton. And if the election were held, when it gets down to the bottom,
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:40.800]  we see them playing the gender card every day.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.400]  Well, I agree. I told people a year ago that I thought Hillary had it because of the whole
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.840]  gimmick of a woman and her playing that. But if all the Clinton rapes come out and all that
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:54.000]  comes out and Trump's a wild card, he could pull, like Toto, the curtain back, whether
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.200]  he's good, bad or indifferent. This Trump moment is giving people an uprising point.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:04.000]  They thought it'd be Bush Hillary as a ringer. And couldn't he be the ace in the hole that
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.960]  basically undoes the whole thing? That's what I'm getting at. Is he a Toto?
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:13.640]  Yes, he could. And it goes back, when I was going to answer your other question, I was
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:18.440]  putting other information on top of it before I answered it, when you said to the American
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:21.160]  people that they reached the point, yes, they have.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:25.600]  Oh, okay. Stay there then. Wow. Okay. So come flesh that out. I want to get your expert
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:29.720]  take on this straight ahead. Going back to what you said over a year ago, now where you
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:33.440]  think it's going now, straight ahead. And then more on the economy, more trends you're
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:40.040]  looking at. Phone calls, got loaded phones for Gerald Salente. Check out his website trendsresearch.com.
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:46.120]  I'm Alex Jones, folks, and infowars.com and prisonplanet.com are the dev of the spear,
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:49.840]  the enemy hates them. They don't want those links out there. Help us get them out.
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:30:16.360]  Gunfires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:19.840]  To caught up stock market plunger, the results impacting other Asian stock markets are already
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.400]  in free fall, following a massive sell off on Wall Street yesterday, fueled by concerns
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:28.360]  over China's economy over value stock and low oil prices. Japan's Nikkei 225 slid dramatically
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:33.880]  in early trading and was down 2.68% or around 474 points near the end of the day. China's
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:37.520]  Hainan scene index stayed negative territory most of the day while Indonesia's currency
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:41.480]  crashed in response to the terrorist attack likely to be blamed on ISIS. There's no doubt
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:45.760]  that tax effects on Asian stock markets will also shock US markets, especially considering
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:51.840]  that Dow Jones industrial average closed at 16,151 on Wednesday, down over 1,500 points
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:56.160]  in the past 10 trading days. Check back on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com for more

[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:19.320]  live youtube feed which is great because it's going to bankrupt me how many millions of people
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:23.480]  are watching our own internal video streams so that's why we use youtube and other systems
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:27.720]  because we can't afford the bandwidth. People are like you should be a purist and not use youtube or
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:34.440]  not use facebook. I can't pay to do a facebook mentions or my own platform and have two three
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:39.800]  million viewers on many of these videos. You know how much it cost for two three million people
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:45.160]  to watch a video at the cheapest bandwidth it's like four five thousand dollars.

[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:57.720]  realized you coined that term and what i'm saying is you're providing that you're in the cutting edge
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:03.000]  of of whole health healing so it's not like you know you're you're selling soda pop you know so

[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:14.440]  mind is you know one point i want to make before i go on we went into the cut into the break on
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:22.040]  the the first one i was talking about obama's militaristic state of the union address where he
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:30.760]  bred that the united states has had over 10 000 airstrikes 10 000 you know how many innocent
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:38.040]  people were killed and then this is the guy that and again i'm not making this up on terry tuesday
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:43.960]  quote when he talks about who he's going to assassinate with drones i'm really good at killing
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:54.120]  people this is the man that the united states has dropped over 24 000 bombs last year according to
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:41:00.840]  a recent report and he gets a tear in his eye when he thinks about the dead kids and sandy hook
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:08.120]  how many people is he murdered with drones and how many innocent people how many people that
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:14.920]  have never been convicted of anything but suspected by whom that have been slaughtered
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:19.080]  by the murderer in chief and he's talking about gun control
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:27.560]  it's amazing jerald you know so much is happening i want to invite you back sooner obviously

[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:29.160]  kind of where the tire meets the road is what can we do to ensure that only eligible voters vote
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:37.080]  i mean you know i go to vote uh i fill out my my uh ballot in a cardboard box and i put it into
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:44.680]  something that looks like a paper shredder and uh a light comes on you know i mean it's just i i go
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:50.440]  how can i say how i i what can we do to ensure the integrity of what's going on well there's
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:56.680]  been going on for all my life you know it's it's run by criminal operations people like to call
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:02.840]  them the democrats and republicans i call the bloods in the crypts what do you expect every one
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:07.720]  of them the murderers and thieves they steal our money the names are too big to fail bailouts loan

[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.360]  that's just one of the small parts of it so they keep the murderers in chief and other psychopaths
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:31.960]  in place look if this was a soviet union still in place you have a reelection rate that rival them
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:37.240]  at the height of the soviet union that's how many incumbents get reelected in this country

[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:56.920]  ron paul on he i say should we impeach obama he goes well we should have impeached george will
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:01.560]  be a bush too well i try to do that you know for the iraq war and stuff but with obama it's it's
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:06.760]  you gotta admit it's even crazier it's more naked even liberals like you know constitutional lawyers
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:11.880]  like turley come out and say that i mean don't we have to start punishing them or we just green
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:17.480]  light more craziness gerald exactly that's what we have to do you know i had one dinner by the way
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:23.720]  a doctor judge andrew napolitano came up here to colonial kingston to visit me went out to dinner
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:29.160]  we talked talking very highly of you you came into the conversation and he was talking about
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:34.840]  you know how how bush should be prosecuted for for the war crimes and so should obama
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:40.200]  they're they're they're they're they're violating what did he say that that congress should vote
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:47.960]  for more power to kill people over there in isis land these are illegal wars they're illegal wars
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:57.240]  they're against the constitution and by the way as he's pumping war not a peep about peace nothing
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:03.960]  no one's talking about it you're absolutely right um when you come back tomorrow the next
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:07.160]  year whenever you're able to what are some of the other trends you're going to get into gerald
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:12.280]  well it's very important what's going on with the economy you know we predicted that we said it was
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:17.480]  going to crash and you know the other reasons why i was wrong before i had no idea they're
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:23.320]  going to keep zero rate interest rates i had no idea of quantitative easing i had no idea about
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:28.520]  any of these scams that they were pulling that just like i had no idea that they would destroy
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:34.680]  the bill of rights in the constitution so we're saying is you better prepare prevail and survive
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:41.240]  for the tough times ahead and you've harped on this when when the economy goes down they go to war
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:47.480]  and like clockwork they're lining up for war all over the russians the chinese the arabs funding
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:54.120]  revolutions our government back in the bad guys i mean i've seldom studying history seen bad guys
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:46:01.160]  as bad as the people running our government it's it's just crazy it is crazy and and and you you
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:06.920]  i mean you know as i'm looking at that guy ryan next to sitting up there behind obama at the
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:13.640]  state of the union reminded me that kid on the on the monsters the adams family you know i couldn't
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:21.800]  believe it you got a but this is what trump is right about you have stupid and incompetent people
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:28.840]  running the government we need a third way if you put in another head of the bloods of the
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:35.480]  crypts and head of the that's not going to change the criminality of the system we need if they could
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:42.120]  do it in spain if they could do it in it we could do it in the united states it's time for a real
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:48.520]  third body movement well i remember about four years ago you said watch catalonia uh is going to
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:54.680]  end up seceding and then that'll spread over in spain they've now done that and they're not doing it
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:59.880]  with guns or by votes and so the central government really can't say no even though they're trying to
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:03.640]  because they're not giving them a fight and that's why so many times different governments will go
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:08.600]  create a resistance movement like the ira it came out that was run by british intelligence
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:14.440]  to make them violent to give them the political low ground to then be able to keep ireland enslaved
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:19.320]  and on my biggest job i think is to keep people nonviolent even if the government has some
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:24.360]  provocative things to patriots or others i mean they could kill me to try to start some revolution
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:29.080]  i've heard that's been talked about or lewis fair con or somebody on the other side of the spectrum
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:33.480]  and i'm telling folks don't go crazy if something like that happens because that's what they want
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:38.840]  we're winning overall the info war i think intellectually uh do you agree with that jerald
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:45.960]  oh absolutely morality is the way not military and that's why we launched occupy peace look
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:51.640]  i'm a fighter i'm a close combat practitioner i'll blow anybody's brains out or kill anybody that
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:58.520]  tries to kill me i want peace we will not have a violent revolution it will only turn things
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:03.240]  you just look around the world and you can see what's happening but as you we could do it at the
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:11.800]  ballot box but we need a new third fourth or even fifth party we have to break up the monopoly
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:19.480]  the duopoly the corporate takeover it's fascism it's the merger of state and corporate powers
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:25.400]  i don't want to live under a fascist dictator jerald solante trends research dot com trends

[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:41.080]  over obama and his executive power grab even if you're anti-gun you they can't do it by the president
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:46.600]  with executive orders putting gun owners on a no-gun buy list out of the clear blue sky and
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:54.760]  dav agium um uh is a former michigan house representatives member he is currently on the

[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:03.480]  action committee he is a former member of the michigan house representatives i mentioned

[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:25.800]  to congress from behind the scenes obviously they're getting ready to come on next week
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:31.400]  we've been talking to folks uh in the rnc but mr agema has the courage to actually come on air from
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:38.680]  the rnc board uh and uh talk about what's happening in the republican national committee
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:45.240]  with a move to demand impeachment hearings i mean fast and furious been gauzy the power
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:51.320]  plant's being shut off the the irs persecution uh the the executive power grabs coming after the
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.880]  guns uh uh hillary letting her over there at the state department i mean there's so many reasons
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:01.240]  if we don't you just heard gerald salente he's not a conservative saying obama's the worst ever
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:08.600]  i mean it's a fact so joining us is mr agema us sir thank you so much for what you're doing
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:13.240]  and joining us uh from the rnc i guess looking right now at whether or not they can try to
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:17.240]  ask congress to move forward with impeachment thank you for joining us to tell us about what
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:21.800]  you and others are trying to organize it's my pleasure basically what i tried to organize
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:27.640]  this weekend is to try to get a resolution passed through the rnc to start the articles of impeachment
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:32.600]  or encourage a congressman to uh at least takes just one representative to put articles of
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:37.480]  impeachment and there were 48 articles through the north american law center that were put in
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:42.760]  in my articles and uh basically what i wanted to done for is we got to stand for the constitution
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:47.800]  and what this president has done basically is going around the con the constitution in any way
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:52.040]  he could so uh there's never a wrong time to do the right thing and now's the time to do the right
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:55.960]  thing and i did it for three reasons one i want obama to stop doing what he's doing because
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:51:00.680]  what he's doing is wrong two i want to implicate hillary because she would be implicated in this
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:05.320]  if it started and three i don't want any future presidents to do or get away with what he's doing
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:11.960]  now so i think it should be done i think the fear here is is that uh more democrats will show up to
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:17.000]  vote for hillary whoever if this is put in actually be just the opposite because once this would get
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:22.120]  into the judiciary and get on the house floor it's for the public to see for the public to hear
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:26.760]  they hear everything that he has done and they would be amazed at what he's been involved with
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:30.600]  and i think the people would just say i had enough of this guy we got to go with somebody else and
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:37.400]  it would not be hillary and obviously uh obama would be gone well for the first time in my life
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:43.960]  and i've been politically involved for 25 years on air 21 i am seeing just electric awakening in
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:48.040]  the public just people really have a sense of urgency they realize this isn't just the same
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:54.120]  old corruption we're witnessing this is an aggressive cancerous move to really break the
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:59.320]  country i mean they admit that cloward and piven to bring us to our knees there's a real hate
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:05.400]  like the enemy is conservatives veterans libertarians christians the irs persecution i mean
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:09.240]  inside the rnc i know you can't talk about some of the you know private meetings but
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:13.560]  what is the sense i mean i know there's quite a few people in congress but but but they're waiting
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:17.800]  for the rnc to see what they want to do with this big election coming up some think it'll
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:24.600]  make obama a victim i don't see that america wants action america wants that's exactly right and
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:29.000]  that's what this resolution would have done it would have encouraged a representative to stand
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.360]  up and do something just takes one to put it in that's all this would have done uh and then if
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:39.800]  we have done our job as a gop and rnc then it's up to congress if congress doesn't do it then
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:43.800]  they've just admitted they're basically a fact that factless group that don't do what they're
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:49.480]  supposed to do so in in my opinion like i said as an air force officer and a state representative
[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:53.080]  former state representative i took a note of office to defend the constitution against all
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:57.480]  enemies foreign and domestic and so did those congressmen so technically according to the law
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:53:03.640]  if the congressmen and many have already admitted even the vice chair of the dnc has said that obama
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:09.880]  has aided and embedded the enemy the vice chair of the dnc why can't the gop jump on this and say
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:15.000]  we need to get rid of this guy as an example the future presidents that they will not do this and
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.360]  anybody who's been implicated in this involved with this would be elicit as a co-conspirator
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:25.080]  and i think we get rid of a few democrats and probably one or two republicans that also knew
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:29.880]  this was going on and didn't even bother to speak up so for me as a military former military guy this
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:35.080]  guys be crazy i just uh i want this guy stopped he wants my guns he wants my freedom he wants
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:41.880]  everything i want him out we've got to stand up and the best defense is an offense uh so how do
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:46.840]  we get the rnc to come out with a resolution what pressure can we bring to bear and then separately
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:53.320]  what are most people looking at as the most important thing to start impeaching on aiding isis
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:57.480]  aiding al qaeda we have the former head of defense intelligence coming out the general and saying they
[01:53:57.480 --> 01:54:03.000]  were ordered to do this by obama we have the head of south com the marine corps general saying he's
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.600]  in in 50 years and longest serving a military ever almost 50 years general you know saying that he
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:12.920]  has to follow orders but what he's being told to do is going to destroy the military i mean we've
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:18.520]  never seen our military speak out like this well the north american law center has all 48 of those
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:23.240]  articles there's too many for me to go through sitting in front of this camera presently but i
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:31.320]  think again what it's going to take is uh for the rnc members to wake up i sent out 168 emails to
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:37.720]  all the people what this resolution was what's the rationale behind it was only 81 opened up the
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:42.120]  resolution to read it and what's surprising to me when i went to the resolution committee
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:49.080]  at least one or two people on the committee never even read it and they're going to vote on it so
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:56.920]  what happened in the resolutions committee not one person voted yes to get this resolution passed
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:03.640]  and asking a representative to start the impeachment process not one so that the question to me is then
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:10.760]  is the rnc is a gop saying that treason and tyranny is no longer an impeachable impeachable
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:17.480]  thing have we just thrown that out i don't think so we have to stand on this because if we don't the
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:22.840]  next president will do the very same well i appreciate the fact that you raise this as a member of the
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:28.280]  rnc national committee did any of them privately tell you they agree with you or do they all just
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:32.920]  basically sit there and and just go along with this out of fear intimidation and we get rid of
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:39.320]  john bamer and now paul ryan isn't pushing for it what is the sense of letting obama engage in
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:45.880]  naked treason well i think the fear is within the rnc and the gop is if this has started
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:52.680]  it that more democrats will jump on the bandwagon for hillary for bernie sanders it's just the
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:57.640]  opposite because once all these things would be brought forth on the news media where you'd be
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:02.280]  seeing it on television everyone would have a chance to see what both hillary and obama have
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:06.840]  been doing i think it'd be just the opposite we'd get more people on our side so i think that's the
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:11.480]  fear they think that's going to put more democrats voting for a democrat i disagree that's why i put
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:18.280]  it in and i think more people need to stand up uh yeah i had three co-sponsors only of 168 on this
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:24.360]  issue and it takes 10 from one person from 10 different 10 different states to bypass the
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:28.520]  resolutions committee to get it on the floor since i didn't have it it will never go to the floor it
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:34.280]  will never be voted on well ron paul you still only get you know double zero votes taught at the fed
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:38.440]  now it's passing the house probably can pass the senate soon so in the beginning a patriot's just
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:43.000]  cares man hated fear and scorned but in time when his cause succeeds the tim would join him
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.800]  because then it cost nothing to be a patriot so in the words of mark twain uh we have to do this
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:53.240]  because a lot of these republican power brokers they want all this stolen power once they get in
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:58.440]  that's really the reason i think they're doing this and it's despicable well like i said before
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.920]  there's never a wrong time to do the right thing and if you know what's happening
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:07.800]  then it's my job and everybody else's job here to bring that to the attention of the proper authorities
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:12.200]  and try to encourage our representatives to do the right thing and by the way
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:17.080]  we have 23 members in the judiciary so one representative puts it in and it goes to the
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:22.440]  judiciary we have 23 republicans it only takes 20 to get it out of the judiciary when it gets on
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:28.920]  the house floor it only takes 218 members we have 247 members so we could get it out of the house
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:36.360]  so he would be impeached via the house in the next thing you got to remember yeah republicans
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:40.200]  next thing you got to remember some of those individuals that would be called in to testify
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:46.760]  as a result of the impeachment process would not be able to vote as senators in the senate so
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:52.600]  presently if they are all were there it would take 12 democrats to cross over to totally impeach
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:57.800]  obama my philosophy is when it all came out there'd be so much public pressure on those
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:03.400]  democrat senators and after their testimony they wouldn't be able to uh to vote we could impeach
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:08.680]  it's just like with nixon it's a house of cards but they've committed hundreds of times literally
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:12.600]  what nixon did he had a list of a hundred and some people they but they've persecuted tens of
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:18.760]  thousands of the irs just on that it's thousands of times worse gop ladies and gentlemen we'll put
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:25.720]  the screen back up there the main gop uh website gop.com get in there the phone numbers there the

[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:28.840]  michigan he's on the republican national committee and he got three other great people to vote
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:34.760]  to try to have a resolution to ask the republicans to start investigating impeachment i mean the fact
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:39.080]  that they're not even having hearings the fact they're not even looking at the scandals i've got
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:46.920]  news the irs persecution has kicked back in i mean i've talked to folks that just put out
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:52.920]  patriotic apparel like ranger up and they have the irs come after them and tell them stop doing
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:57.640]  what you're doing it's not even really political it's just pro america there's massive persecution
[02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:04.360]  in this country and if we don't stop it history shows it will progress like cancer and i keep
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:09.800]  using the term cancer because that's where this is going now another patriot uh former top secret
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:14.600]  service agent dan bonjino is going to be joining us talk about the scandals obama what's happening
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:20.120]  straight ahead but the minutes we have left uh with mr ajima uh other points that need to be
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:25.320]  discussed here other uh things that are happening inside the rnc uh other points you like to get
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:29.320]  across to folks well first of all i want the folks to know the only way to change things to get
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:33.320]  involved you got to get involved with the gop or whatever party you want to be involved with and
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:38.120]  you got to start it from the grassroots on up i think i think there's a tendency within the us
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:43.080]  today it's top down and i think that's why you see trump that's why you see carcin and some of those
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:47.080]  other individuals are heading the polls people are just kind of sick of it so i just want people to
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:52.120]  get out there and get involved and uh get the correct people in if you're congressmen and so
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:55.960]  forth they're not doing what they promise to do smaller government and so forth even voting on
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:00.520]  an issue like this vote somebody else in uh we need to have different people with some of the
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:05.960]  intestinal fortitude to do the right thing so just get involved folks and never give up never
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:10.520]  quit as a former fighter pilot i always said that you know you're over the target when you're
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:15.560]  taking black i'm taking black folks well we appreciate you doing that i know folks like
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:19.000]  yourself don't like to talk about the things you go through to do the right thing because
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.880]  you know you you just expect that but but absolutely we're going to lose the whole country
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:29.240]  if we don't turn this around i mean global depression is kicking in incredible tyranny is
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:33.880]  expanding they're delivering armored vehicles across the country and police say yeah the feds
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:38.600]  gave it to us to fight the conservatives i mean if the crazy left really thinks they're going to
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:44.920]  have some civil war in this country i think they've misjudged the situation because i've never seen
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:50.840]  the military so awake and i've never seen police as awake as they are now that's what i'm seeing
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:56.680]  so the grassroots is waking up i think washington has miscalculated can you make any comments on that
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:02.360]  i would agree with you 100 uh they're in their little bubble i've been a big proponent of a
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:06.200]  part-time legislature both in the state of michigan and i'd like to say for the federal
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:10.120]  congress as well because when they're there they're in their bubble they're making unnecessary
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:15.240]  laws taxes fines and fees i don't think our founding fathers ever anticipated it would become
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:18.600]  what it is today so we need to change it i'd love to be part of that change
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:24.600]  davajima.com and he's on the rnc in there brought up that there should be an impeachment
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:30.600]  investigation a resolution got three other votes got shot down and now you know that impeachment
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:35.320]  was considered inside the rnc that's major breaking news and the fact is just that news
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:40.600]  getting out will cause a bigger drumbeat that oh we could consider that and then as he commits more
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:46.040]  of these user patients we can move forward uh sir thank you so much for your time look forward to
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:51.720]  speaking to you again my pleasure keep doing a good work thank you sir folks i'm talking to
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:55.640]  congress folks behind the scenes they've been waiting to see what the rnc did we're going to
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:04:00.040]  probably get some congressman on former and current next week that are going to call for you the
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:03.960]  listeners to take action on this i mean we cannot just sit here we can't just sit here
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:09.240]  we cannot just sit here and watch these crimes being committed and do nothing or it sets the
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:15.320]  precedent for it to get worse that's why you see exponential corruption exponential fraud
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:21.800]  exponential looting exponential spending exponential arrogance exponential insanity
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:27.800]  and here's the problem these delusionals almost all of them haven't been in the military that
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:31.400]  are running things now like they got a bunch of weird feminists running the state department
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:35.320]  the pentagon now giving them the orders want to have war with russia and make statements all we'll
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:40.920]  just blow the russians up and we'll just denialate the chinese they're crazy at least napoleon and
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:46.040]  hitler bad guys were former military and still bit off more than they can shoot we got a bunch of
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:52.520]  weird socialists on power trips want to start world war three folks they've got to be stopped now and
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:57.960]  the neocons are working with them and are crazy as well we got banjino coming up stay with us
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:03.000]  asian stocks fell sharply after suspected ice and suicide bombers and gunmen attacked indonesia's
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.920]  capital on thursday killing at least three and wounding several others massive explosions
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:11.000]  shook downtown jacarta including a reported bomb going off near local un office another

[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:23.160]  are already in freefall following a massive sell-off on wall street yesterday fueled by concerns

[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:42.120]  response to the terrorist attack likely to be blamed on isis there's no doubt the tax effects on

[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:29.560]  all right i told you i had a lot of big breaking news today and so we were going to do the
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:35.560]  fourth hour live because i wanted to get a briefing on it and stuff because this hasn't broken yet
[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:39.960]  but then i was talking to him during the break we're going to go ahead and do the fourth hour
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:45.480]  today but i'm going to do 30 minutes of it rob do will do the 30 minutes after that
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:51.960]  because i'm going to go ahead and have tim kennedy in here in studio he's the he was the number two
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:58.040]  ufc middleweight but he's been busy with government stuff so he's not been fighting for a while
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:02.920]  he's also the host of hunting hitler uh and he's also a listener and i've gotten to know him
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:06.840]  and he was already coming in today just to talk about some stuff behind the scenes with us
[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:12.840]  and then he got visited by the fbi yesterday and uh and this is a real issue this has been
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:17.240]  going on because i have a cousin who just got out of the army after 30 something years and he had
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:24.600]  similar things uh going with the fbi but isis is in houston he's ready to talk about it and actually
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:29.800]  has a group they're telling him coming to killing and they just attacked at indonesia i mean this
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:35.880]  is getting crazier and crazier by the minute uh so the famous green beret is going to be in here
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:41.160]  in studio with us for 30 minutes uh at the start of the next hour another great patriot dan bonjino
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:47.240]  bonjino dot com uh has been trying to expose the tyranny in the country he can't talk about what he
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:52.040]  saw inside the obama administration uh he was his head of security when he went on foreign trips
[02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:57.000]  which is the most important position obviously because that's so dangerous and he said he never
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:02.120]  told me on on air off air any secrets i never said that people were calling him up lying to him last
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:08.040]  week saying hey i was just saying bonjino said that obama is a secret muslin no i said i talked to
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:14.920]  other people in government secret service i'll just say it fbi and others that just said it's so
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:20.120]  insane they can't believe it everybody's scared and i already heard this for two years from several
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:25.480]  high-level people that obama actually praised mecca i mean he really is and we know he went to the
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:30.520]  muslim schools we know we nothing against muslims but just be honest about it but it's backing the
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:35.400]  muslim brotherhood it's backing of isis donald trump talking about it all the things he's done
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:39.880]  overthrowing libya and then putting a radical jihadist in the pentagon says they may just go
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:45.160]  ahead and take over libya now this is a larger plan that's not why bonjino's here he never said
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:49.880]  that he never told me anything he said quote it's worse than you're even saying i talked to other
[02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:55.480]  people and i'm like whoa don't even tell me this because it's so dangerous and i haven't been told
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:11:01.960]  much uh other than no he was he's not just a muslim sympathizer folks he's it and look at his actions
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:08.520]  and then the other stuff and the and that he treats the secret service like dogs and his wife and
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:13.320]  kids do they just say that's never been seen before uh and it's a bunch of other stuff now
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:16.280]  i don't want to get bonjino in trouble because he gets blamed for whatever because he's one of the
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:21.320]  first to go public and just say it's so bad i can't be there i quit doesn't matter he's got his new
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:26.200]  book the fight a secret service agents inside account of security failings in the political
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:31.960]  machine new york times best-selling author get the book support patriots they've tried to ruin
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:35.800]  him they threatened him they threatened his kids he hasn't made a big deal out of it but this is the
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:40.120]  type but they go through his garbage that's the type of stuff that because they're so scared of him
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:44.360]  and what he knows we're not here trying to get him to say all that stuff but sometimes i think just
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:49.720]  go ahead and say it then you'd be safer than what he knows and they're threatening him for but regardless
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:55.400]  we know what obama's doing nakedly in front of everyone and so until the bottom of the hour longer
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:01.640]  if he has it dan bonjino joins us sir thank you for your courage and and so much more i'm kind of
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:07.160]  ranting here but looking at the state of this union versus what obama claims what's really happening
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:14.600]  well thanks for having me alex listen you're you're being ruled okay uh you're not being
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:19.880]  governed i can't say that in grave enough terms to your audience and you know let me just kind of
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:25.160]  narrow that down for you because it's easy to give quick sound bites i don't engage in hyperbole
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:29.640]  what's the difference between being ruled and being governed well alex as you well know when
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:35.320]  you're being ruled the rules are discretionary right the rules don't apply to the dc sespol
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:40.200]  and the insider class and the clinton's and cathleen sabilius and barack obama the rules
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:46.120]  don't apply to them but the rules do apply to your listeners who will find themselves in bracelets
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:50.440]  and i'm not talking about tiffany bracelets i'm talking about handcuffs if they were to violate
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:55.640]  those rules now contrast that with a an effective constitutional republic which we're moving away
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:13:01.640]  from a representative government where the citizenry is subjected to the same rules as the people who
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:08.040]  are in positions of government we have long since left that and i i'm hoping in the book
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:13.400]  that through some of the stories i tell there that it serves us to activate the paul's and the
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:21.160]  paulette reveres in in your audience and elsewhere to say hey listen it is time for a peaceful electoral
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:26.920]  revolution here alex if they're not there you're either with us or you're against us in the movement
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:31.000]  and you either support liberty or you don't and if you don't i don't care if you're a nice guy a
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.880]  nice woman you need to go find a new line of work take a one-way ticket home and get out of dc
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:39.560]  because you're destroyed in the country well you've never told me anything secret you just
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:43.960]  said quote it's worse than you're even saying alex being far away from it now obviously you
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:47.880]  talked about before getting pressure for whatever it is you've witnessed now you heard what i was
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:53.080]  talking about earlier uh i've talked to different federal people some of them even pretty high level
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:59.640]  they are actually scared of obama now uh and i never saw this years ago with my sources what's
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:06.200]  changed that you can talk about that people are so scared people are scared because uh you know as i
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:10.680]  said when i released the last book and i get into this a little bit in this book as well as the
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:16.920]  government's a shiny new toy for barack obama you know there's a danger in electing far leftists
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:22.600]  who have little government experience and then giving them this shiny new toy called the entire
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:27.160]  united states government to operate i mean think of the some of the things that happened under the
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:33.560]  obama administration alex that are clearly unprecedented i mean number one the irs scandal
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:38.120]  you know the left loves to say well well nixon tried it yet he tried it the operative word
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:46.120]  there is nixon tried it and was impeached okay nixon tried to use the irs he didn't do it as
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:51.080]  what happened under the obama administration think about the executive action on immigration what this
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:56.040]  was no matter where your audience stands in immigration regardless do you stand for the rule
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:02.520]  of law or not the president just invented prosecutorial discretion and here's the key out
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:07.640]  what he did with uh is saying an entire class of immigrants were no longer subject to united
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:11.960]  states law which is make no mistake what he did that would be the equivalent of me as a police
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:17.560]  officer in new york we get some form of investigative discretion too you don't have to give everybody
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.720]  a ticket you pull over for speeding that that's not part of your job you're allowed to discretion
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:27.480]  but alex here's the key point i can't go to a roll call as a police officer and say
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:33.080]  hey folks here's the deal i'm no longer going to give tickets to this class of person for any
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:39.000]  reason and not only that i'm going to give him a free pass to evade speed limit laws that's what
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:44.520]  happened that has never been done in us history we have a president united states who takes the
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:50.440]  constitution he uses it like a tissue and the left doesn't find how is the left not in a panic
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:54.120]  over this i mean alex here's the other is what i kind of like about your your audience i mean
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:58.760]  i get a lot of tweets and facebook messages when i go on your show they get it like they're not
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:03.800]  beholden to the republic and golden calf either their thing is like hey if our guy was doing this
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:09.320]  we'd boot his ass out as quickly as we get the lefties out the left seems to say hey we don't
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:15.000]  care about abuse of power as long as it's our guy abusing it i mean this is this is governing
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:20.360]  insanity right now and the left did better wake up to what's going on or if we get a bad republic
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:28.760]  in there we're going to be cleaning up the mess for them that said we have this moment where
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:35.960]  the immovable object is coming into the unstoppable force there's a collision people
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:41.400]  are waking up but at the same time there's this hubris and arrogance that's what i talked about
[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:44.600]  i mean i'm not saying the military is perfect but it's our general saying don't start all these
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:50.040]  wars now and it's all these weird leftists just attacking and doing all this weird stuff starting
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:55.880]  wars with russia it really is scary to be in this position and know that we're in the hands of crazy
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:17:01.560]  people well here's the interesting part and i don't even want to subject this to any partisan
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:06.840]  analysis because there's really bad actors on both sides here you know when you view the left when
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:11.640]  you understand i get this all the time i get this why why why you know why does obama do this why is
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:16.520]  he doing this he knows the economy stinks why not just cut taxes he knows obama cares blowing it
[02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:21.080]  why not just repair obama care or do something or get rid of it or try something else people ask me
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:27.000]  why why the executive action you know i i read a book a long time ago by david harwitz and he calls
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:31.640]  the left and he's right you know whatever your opinion about david's work is he says when you
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:36.360]  understand that the left don't worry about them being communists or fabian socialist or redistribution
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:42.200]  is or socialist or peron is forget it when you understand that the modern left and the people
[02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:48.760]  assisting them are anti anti-communist digest that for a moment that they're anti anti-communist
[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:54.760]  the whole thing makes sense the fact that they're the left is all about control and anything that
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:18:01.480]  gets in their way anything even if it's a leftist they will put that person away they will i mean
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:06.120]  politically speaking if they have to lock them up like they did with the video guy in bangazi
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:12.680]  they don't care the left is against anything that is involves economic liberty human freedom a health
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:18.120]  care liberty education liberty they're totalitarian real thing you what's that they're totalitarian
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:23.480]  oh but there's no question i mean i'm talking about the and i just want to be clear on this too
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:27.560]  because i get a lot of emails it's not the democratic party i mean you look at states like
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:32.760]  massachusetts and maryland and illinois the democrats got how do you say it pissed off i mean they
[02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:38.760]  elected republicans i mean they got sick of it too alex it's a cult of it's a cult of control
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:45.640]  freaks controlling the party there's absolutely no question the there's you know there's two types
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:49.720]  of people as i opened up the interview we're doing here you know there's people in america right now
[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:54.360]  understand you're being ruled not governed and there's people who are being manipulated into
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:19:00.440]  believing otherwise and the far left activist wing has co-opted rank and file democrats into
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:04.680]  believing this is really about you know this is about personal empowerment i mean i'll give you a
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:08.600]  quick example i'm walking in a parking lot in publics the other day and i see a sticker about
[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:15.960]  bernie sanders and it says bernie sanders real people real power i mean i had a i had a laugh
[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:21.720]  and i laughed tragically i mean i laughed because i wanted to cry i mean let this really believe
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:27.560]  that this guy who's preaching almost complete economic control to a 90 tax rate a health care
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:31.800]  system controlled by government bureaucrats who don't give a damn about you your health or your
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:35.880]  hip replacement and a public education system where they can sit there and almost freely
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:41.480]  indoctrinate our kids with no with no say whatsoever you really believe that's real power
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:47.160]  and the fact that a swath of the democratic party is being being sucked into this bernie sanders
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:52.760]  vacuum and the loss of it shows you it's a bunch of spoiled brats have no historical connection

[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:38.520]  dan continuing we went to break we were talking about just this whole mindset this takeover
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:43.960]  how we have to counter these people it really is clear they're trying to submit power into two
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:51.560]  party system why is the republican leadership continually working with them well alex because
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:58.120]  sadly to many people in the republican leadership you know they they triage their their wants and
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:04.520]  their desires and in that triage process what what's number one for them re-election um and power it's
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:10.360]  just you know lord actin right power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely you know all
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:15.640]  great men are at heart bad men and and this is what happens and this is why you know not to go back
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:20.440]  to my campaign that that's that's over now but i used to say things on my campaign all the time like
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:28.120]  it's your responsibility if i win to keep me in check as much as it's my responsibility to keep
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:33.800]  communicating with you we corrupt these politicians as easily as they're corrupted and i'll tell you
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:38.920]  why we put these people on go we make golden cash out of them you know alex you've seen it i know
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:42.200]  you've seen it because you talked to a lot of these guys that you mentioned a name right i'm
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:45.800]  not going to get into specifics of people because we you know we could go with the list goes on and
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:51.160]  on frankly but they'll say congressman jones and you for oh he's the best and then you say hey did
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:57.240]  you know he voted for bainer really it's like did you do you know any of his votes and i'm not it's
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:01.640]  not your audience or the talk radio what they're knowledgeable but but john q public a lot of them
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:07.000]  after don't understand that putting these people on a pedestal and and sudo worshiping them this
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:12.760]  is a joke these are sinners man we're all sinners and i use that word specifically we are all fallible
[02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:17.080]  men and women why are we worshiping politicians they're not rock stars i mean they're human
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:21.880]  beings they're worthy of respect and dignity but you should be calling their officer email in their
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:26.600]  office two three times a week and i'll say this about jones he admitted years ago he did that and
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:32.760]  apologize for it's why he helped leave the operation to remove baner yeah yeah i mean i'm
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:37.400]  just using the name randomly i'm not i'm not talking about walter jones i'm just saying like john q
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:41.480]  public congressman i'm not talking about him specifically let me be clear i was just using
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:45.000]  that as a random name i mean congressman you know brown johnson doesn't make a difference
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:50.680]  my whole point is that we find these people and and and they give a great speech somewhere and all
[02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:55.320]  of a sudden the idea of a representative republic goes away saying oh he's we have to keep him honest
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:28:01.480]  we have to keep him honest exactly i mean it's a represent you know one of the things i write
[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:06.600]  about in the book all the time is that the theme throughout the chapters is just being ruled not
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:11.880]  governed and i tell these stories of how dangerous alex government power is i tell this story of
[02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:16.360]  when i was in the secret service in a training class when this instructor he made a joke it was a
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:21.480]  simple joke and it was about a presidential threat case and you know a guy a student on the way home
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:25.560]  thought he was serious and when you read the story you're going to be blown away because you're going
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:32.360]  to see how quickly alex like that it you know at the drop of a hat how easily people can be corrupted
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:36.840]  when you swear in as a congressman or you get a government badge and thank god and i'm glad you
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:40.760]  brought this up i was listening to your last segment i'm glad you brought up the fact that a
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:45.320]  lot of the cops and military that contact me i'm sure they contact you too they're waking up
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:50.040]  matter of fact a source at the end of the book in the last chapter on the clinton emails this guy
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:54.280]  was one of those patriots you're talking about who said no no no i'm not going to be part of this
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:59.320]  this is in my this is in my bag that constitution means something to me he contacted me and told
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:03.640]  me something about the clinton email scandal which totally blew my mind and it's been getting a lot
[02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:08.120]  of traction in the book well you've got to give us some of the secrets of the book folks are going
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:13.560]  to get it but it's come out she's lied now of course and there were more emails and it is secret
[02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:19.960]  i mean she's got to be removed or it again sets a new precedent well here i'll i'll i'll let you in
[02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:24.120]  on this one hold on don't do it we're about to go to break come back and do it but but let's tell
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:27.880]  folks about the book we'll put it on screen for tv viewers everybody should get it just because of
[02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:31.720]  the fact you left the secret service when you were you know going to the very top of it you're
[02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:35.880]  very honorable man folks should have the inside info and they should support patriots the fight

[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:42.600]  don't follow that stuff the point is he's a really cool guy who's already coming in here today to
[02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:46.520]  talk about other stuff with me he also is one of the owners arranger up and all this crazy stuff
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:50.760]  happened with the fbi visited me yesterday and saying no isis is in houston they want to come
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:57.000]  after you at your house in austin so this is how bizarre all this is getting how close to home
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:01.080]  and bajino that's one of my questions for you don't want to get into some of the other stories in
[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:07.400]  the book you just teased it but after that and after a few calls i want to talk about this whole
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:13.000]  isis thing donald trump saying hillary and obama helped make isis top generals coming out and saying
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:18.120]  it like the head of defense intelligence i mean this is unprecedented if that isn't impeachable
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:25.400]  i don't know what is well listen the president is not serious right now i mean we we have a
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:31.720]  group of hegemonic islamic radical radicals overseas that have absolutely committed to
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:35.800]  our destruction and he said something in the state of the union alex i should scare and frighten
[02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:40.280]  everybody he said you know we don't have an existential threat right now with going on with
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:44.840]  isis he tried to play it down uh well you know someone should tell isis that i mean these are
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:48.760]  the kinds of people alex keep in mind they're looking for dirty bombs they're looking for
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:54.600]  radioactive material uh you know they're working with regimes that have looked at emp atmospheric
[02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:59.640]  detonation to wipe out our electric grid you know this is the kind of thing that's a very real
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:05.000]  threat you know the congressman who sat in office uh as a republican before i ran rasko Bartlett
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:09.640]  dedicated his entire life's work to the threat of emp and he used to tell the story all the time
[02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:14.760]  it's amazing people have fire insurance for their house but the united states has no insurance for
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:20.360]  an atmospheric nuclear detonation that would wipe out the entire electric grid i mean what what
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:24.600]  planet is president obama living on what what kind of people does he think he's dealing with the
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:29.560]  jets and the sharks like it's a west side story they just take it over these are hegemonic maniac
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:33.240]  they've just taken over three countries they're killing hundreds of thousands and then he's caught
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:38.520]  giving them weapons of course he's saying they're not a threat i mean he needs to play it down
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:42.120]  because remember to president obama you know i write about this in a book when i talk about
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:45.320]  obama and the team like he doesn't understand the concept of the team you have to remember with
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:50.600]  obama it's always about obama i mean it's always about him it's about politics and when you understand
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:55.640]  again that he represents this wing of the left that the anti-anti-communist party you know they
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:00.440]  can't they have this disdain this this almost this hatred for everything that involves economic
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:05.640]  liberty personal for they'll tell you otherwise but the way they legislate govern and rule most
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:10.600]  importantly is the exact opposite it's all about obama and the accumulation of power in
[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:16.280]  the executive branch that is so dangerous to liberty lovers out there everywhere i know you
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:19.800]  can't tell us inside stuff from a secret service because they'll claim you've involved in treason
[02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:26.440]  even though these are obviously the people involved in the takeover of america but talking to folks
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:31.480]  in and around that have witnessed things with obama and the rest of them there really are
[02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:36.520]  like criminal lines they're mentally ill they want to do bad things they want to overturn us
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:40.840]  they have a beef with us the way it was described by one guy was they want to mount our head on the
[02:37:40.840 --> 02:37:48.520]  wall they want to conquer us is that accurate well he certainly feels that way about about people who
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:53.400]  are in any way vested in a constitutional republican and objectively limited government
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:57.960]  i mean think about just go back to some of the speeches the way he talks about republicans
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:02.600]  you know i i heard someone say last night on on on another station i was listening to and it was
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:08.200]  totally accurate they said you know obama apologizes for iran they they you know they
[02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:12.360]  take our soldiers that they put them on their knees they blindfold them they take them into
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:17.880]  custody he apologizes for isis he uses oh isis it's not that it's not an existential threat
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:23.320]  but alex once you get him talking about liberty lovers veterans you know people out you know the
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:30.200]  so-called right wing do you ever notice that obama it's unbelievable the sweat is like brewing he gets
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:35.400]  so riled up because i'm telling you when you understand that they're the anti-anti-communists
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:40.600]  that they can't stand anyone that has that wants that wants that believes in free markets that
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:44.600]  believes in capitalism that believes in liberty that believes in the sacrifices that were made
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:49.480]  for liberty when you understand that that's that's their natural political enemy all of this stuff
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:55.240]  makes sense none of it's a mystery anymore that's why they find allies in with uh you know with with
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:39:00.840]  radical islamists i mean they will not call these people out no matter what it's outrageous because
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:07.400]  they all have this joint communal hatred of patriots christians and others i've seen a lot of
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:12.280]  clips i've played where he talks about christians and how violent and hateful they are and he'll
[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:17.560]  start actually like you said almost sweating almost getting upset and like he's you can see
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:23.480]  the visceral hate and he was recorded obviously when clandestinely when he was running for obama
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:29.320]  saying don't worry i can take care of these better clingers yeah i mean remember this speech uh
[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:34.520]  what was he given at the prayer breakfast where he he starts talking about the crusades i mean
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:39.880]  alex this this is borderline and it really this is insane stuff this is sick stuff the crusades
[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:45.080]  do you even know anyone who was involved in the crusades i i mean outside of reading about the
[02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:50.120]  crusades in history books what does it mean by the way the crusades were a response to a giant
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:55.240]  300 year islamic invasion that went all the way to germany right but he doesn't even want to tell
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:40:00.120]  you that i mean we can listen we can talk the history of it all day the point of this is this is
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:07.640]  a man who to justify the acts of of tyrannical hegemonic killers and their attempts to destroy
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:12.680]  people in the united states and our system of government he justifies it by bringing up events
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:18.840]  that happened hundreds of years ago that have zero relationship to anything going on right now
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:25.160]  and it's it it's the obama doctrine it's it's it's constantly beyond the attack constantly keep your
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:30.840]  enemies on their heels constantly go after liberty constantly go after christians you know religious
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:35.560]  liberty he doesn't believe in any of this and and remember if you get your values from god like i do
[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:38.920]  i'm not asking the government you know you had gerald celeste on before i used to listen to him on
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:43.640]  the mesis blog all the time he i if i remember one time i was like i'm not really asking you
[02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:48.600]  got where do you get off thinking i'm asking you for my liberty i don't care about your opinion
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:53.400]  you're a government bureaucrat elected official you're there to ensure my god-given rights you
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:58.200]  don't give them to me who's asking i'm not asking and either is the audience i'm not asking you
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:03.960]  you're a sinner like everyone else just get in charge raise your right hand obey the constitution
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:09.320]  and other than that get out of my damn way i'm not interested i'd stay out of my business well for
[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:14.840]  those that don't know the crusades happened from right after the year 1000 until the 1400s we can
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:23.960]  pull that up and check my memory uh yeah there it is the crusades were from 1054 and went on for 200
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:36.040]  years plus so 10 1096 to 1487 and that was because of the Byzantine emperor again they got basically
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:43.400]  overrun and and consensin obel became of course Istanbul and i mean just it's incredible how when
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:47.720]  i was in school i was taught the west was evil we attacked the poor muslims they were peaceful we
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:51.960]  were so evil and then you actually read a real history book it's just they were like the west
[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:55.320]  even tried to just capitulate to them but then they would just take all the women and kill all
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:42:01.000]  the men spain got overrun half of italy got overrun they went all the way into poland in germany
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:04.920]  they would give no quarter and so everybody started fighting them and then you turn on the news
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:08.440]  and you hear the crusades i mean it's just it's it's an inversion of reality i don't want to go
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:13.960]  off on a jag about that it's just another example no no no you're not and it's important that you
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:18.520]  bring it up because when you again the why matters alex why why do they always say that my podcast
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:24.280]  you know why why what the why matters obama's war on christianity and the far left in general
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:29.240]  it's important that the far left does not want objective values objective values come from
[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:34.120]  religion and spirituality they're objective they're not subject to human analysis you believe in the
[02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:38.200]  right to you know to free speech the right to assemble the right to protect yourself these
[02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:42.440]  are rights given to you by a god who granted you with life he put his finger on your shoulder and
[02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:48.440]  said go forth to love and serve those are objective values that conflicts directly with this totalitarian
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:54.040]  impulse of the new modern far left this impulse is to control and anything that conflicts with
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:59.160]  that sense of control whether it's family whether it's god anything objective they will dismantle
[02:42:59.160 --> 02:43:04.600]  it the why matters that's why this war on christianity the kim davis thing in kentucky what when
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:09.960]  the left marshal all its forces against this woman that's why all of this matters they do it because
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:15.000]  they want to break that relationship between the united states its spirituality and its sense of
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:18.760]  values come from a higher and they want to make themselves god obama and his government i agree
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:22.840]  i want to go to some phone calls yeah exactly i want to go to some phone calls but you never
[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:26.360]  finished that story some of the stories the book tell us a few of them folks are gonna get the book

[02:44:03.880 --> 02:44:07.480]  news i'm actually surprised not more people a couple of people have emailed me about the book
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:11.880]  who read that i didn't make a big deal out of it at the time but not only was it hacked alex
[02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:17.160]  but the clintons knew it was hacked they knew and they kept using it think about this think of how
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:23.080]  deranged this is alex you have a woman running for president united states who traded our deepest
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:29.320]  national security secrets over a private server she knew wasn't secured and that nefarious actors
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:35.960]  were looking at the emails and she did it anyway and not only is she not currently indicted or
[02:44:35.960 --> 02:44:42.680]  imprisoned she's running to be president united states if this is not a red flag to every paul
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:47.240]  revere out there that something's wrong then you know what the country is lost at that point
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:51.240]  because i couldn't when i heard the story i couldn't believe it i had to make sure i double
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:55.400]  and triple and she just to be sure because i don't write stuff in my book otherwise well
[02:44:55.400 --> 02:45:00.600]  what backs up your sources it came out months ago that uh the the nsa the ci and others thought
[02:45:00.600 --> 02:45:03.800]  that it had been compromised well no kidding of course foreign governments are going to target
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:07.320]  your private email server so you're not supposed to use them then she said oh there are no more
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:11.800]  secret emails no more classified i gave them all to you they just found a bunch more i mean
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:17.000]  she's been erasing the hard drives it's it's normally in a case like that if you were absconding
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:21.240]  lying to the fbi you'd be indicted not her she just gets caught over and over again lying
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:28.520]  is there any into it yeah no and you know the other day i was doing a some pr for the book and
[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:32.360]  i'm one of the it was a left-leaning station and he was nice about it but he said to me at one point
[02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:38.360]  he goes well you know republicans have done this to colon powell and and jeb bush or whatever i said
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:43.240]  really there's there an investigative that's okay if they were trading national security secrets
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:48.040]  then i i don't worship the golden calf i don't genuflect in front of republican politicians
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:52.200]  because they have an r in front of their name if that's the case why isn't there an investigation
[02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:58.040]  i mean what the left does alex is is they do this relativity thing where they say well you know
[02:45:58.040 --> 02:46:03.400]  other people did it too and they disregard the degree of the crime i mean we're talking about
[02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:09.080]  a woman who exclusively used a private server to trade our deepest darkest secrets knew the
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:14.200]  thing was hacked and still used it anyway and was getting money accurately stated yeah she was doing
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:17.960]  it on purpose probably probably to sell them i mean i i think your secret service i think you're
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:22.680]  catching on to what i've been told hillary knew it was hacked this was her plausible deniability
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:29.720]  to sell secrets right there for money to come back to the foundation well i don't know but i know the
[02:46:29.720 --> 02:46:33.240]  clinton foundation i write this in the book too was kind of like a shadow government what they're
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:37.080]  trying to do with the clinton foundation is they're influence peddling they're trying to get their
[02:46:37.080 --> 02:46:41.640]  people in through these appointed special positions in the government they're then selling influence
[02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:45.880]  through the clinton foundation for people who will then be able to they'll be able to go back and
[02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:50.040]  contact those folks within the government and get things done and expedite them on kind of a
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:55.800]  governing uh you know h o v lane so their people get service you don't again if you have any doubt
[02:46:55.800 --> 02:47:01.400]  you're being ruled not governed just look at the clinton foundation and how their friends get expedited
[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:07.400]  service and this is the ultimate the ultimate dmv discrimination i mean against all americans to
[02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:12.040]  have a second class you know for the general public and this elite class above the law it's
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:16.360]  the essence of tyranny uh let's talk to luke in washington you're on the air with mr bonjino
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:27.800]  hi thank you for uh taking my call alec you better go ahead um so my question is should
[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:32.920]  trump not become president which i'm really hoping that he said he does i'd love to see trump as
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:38.520]  president should he not become president what is the best thing i can do as an individual
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:43.080]  yeah i love that question what do you think of trump you know that's a great question
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:49.640]  what's that no i mean go ahead but also what do you think of trump yeah well i i think he's
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:55.080]  done a service to the movement by by drawing attention to the the media hypocrisy alex listen
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:59.880]  it's listen you've been subjected to a lot of this stuff too i mean at some point no matter
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:04.200]  where you listen there's some things he said about taxes and i've had some real issues with that's
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:07.640]  they're not conservative positions and they're not liberty based positions either i believe
[02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:12.040]  in economic liberty i believe in the lowest tax rate possible i don't like to demonize
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:16.120]  hedge fund guys or anyone else i don't care what because i believe in economic liberty
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:20.200]  but having said that what he has done which i think has benefited the movement
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:24.680]  is he's basically told the media you know what you guys can go pound sand i really don't care
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:29.800]  and someone had to do that because the media was taken away their mistake he's called their bluff
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:34.360]  of their arrogance well said thank you caller what can an individual do separate from hoping
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:40.280]  trump can save the country okay here's the deal i'm so glad he asked that and luke of it one of
[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:45.080]  the chapters in the book is called your vote matters but not for the reasons you may think
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:50.680]  and it's it's it lays out a blueprint to taking the country back specific steps here's one of them
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:56.200]  folks listen you have to vote but it's not because your vote is going to change an election the
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:01.160]  chances of that happening frankly are extremely remote your one vote is not going to change a
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:05.000]  congressional seat but here's what you don't know you have a voter score just like a credit
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:09.480]  score i don't know if you knew that i'm having run twice i've become intimately familiar with this
[02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:13.720]  you have a voter score no one can tell who you voted for but they can tell you voted
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:17.880]  and if you vote in every election no matter what i don't care if it's a school board of the president
[02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:23.800]  united states you are going to have a really high voter score we ours was one to 12 say you're at 12
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:28.040]  meaning it takes like a nuclear blast to keep you away from an election when you have that high
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:32.600]  voter score i guarantee you your emails to the congressman's office or the senator's office
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:36.760]  and your phone calls they are going to get put to the front of the pile and you become what i call
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:42.920]  exactly just like china's creating the social media score uh there's already one basically a
[02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:47.560]  shadow system here so being involved they pay more attention to you when they know that you're not
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:53.480]  lying down absolutely you know i know a lot of your listeners out there are active voters and
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:57.560]  they get those robo calls and they're annoyed don't be annoyed and i'll tell you why you are getting
[02:49:57.560 --> 02:50:02.840]  a call for a reason it's because you give a damn because you show up and you want to be a super
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:07.080]  voter because alex when things get out on these airwaves and other airways that no one's paying
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:11.800]  attention to like the obama you know attack on the suburbs which i actually wrote about a couple
[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:16.040]  times a conservative review you know when these things happen you want to be able to call you
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:20.040]  want them to look you up say oh my gosh this guy or this woman votes every single time we better
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:24.760]  take care of this and you don't stop and you email until you get an answer you will become a super
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:29.240]  voter there's other tips in there as well i even write some tips in there on how to email there's
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:33.480]  a way to email your congressman it makes a difference i'm telling you i've seen i've heard them talk

[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:53.240]  star job uh you know hundreds of guys thousands sometimes you know beneath him and you know he
[02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:58.520]  just saw stuff that it was so horrible he had to leave uh and and a lot of folks are doing that and
[02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:04.600]  i don't want to ask him if it's true or not but i almost want him to tell me it's not because
[02:55:04.600 --> 02:55:10.200]  when i got told a couple years ago and then again and then a few weekends ago by you know very
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:15.160]  credible people sometimes in person other times and with some famous guys like hey here's my
[02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:21.720]  son such buddy secret service him and then i'm told stuff it's just insane to to actually i mean we
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:24.840]  know obama where's this well hobbyist ring that they say has been debunked and stuff i don't mean
[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:31.320]  to put you on the spot take a few final calls but uh do you think obama is a christian an atheist a
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:37.320]  radical muslim i mean you can say as a citizen separately from stuff you saw there are people
[02:55:37.320 --> 02:55:44.440]  feeding me a lot of bull that this guy's really a secret jihadi yeah i think so you know i've never
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:48.920]  spun your wheels i don't i don't come on your show and and and i say things because they matter
[02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:56.200]  no i love hearing it good good so you never saw him praying to mecca no no and alex listen to
[02:55:56.200 --> 02:56:01.880]  the danger of barack obama is a danger to the constitutional republic and individual liberty
[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:05.480]  no i know what he's done is naked no but i know what he's done is public i i get it
[02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:12.440]  yeah i mean that to me i i mean i said to people all the time i i would almost prefer he had a
[02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:18.360]  you know a spiritual attachment to you know the god whoever that god is because he would
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:22.920]  understand that values don't come from okay what about all the reports of him treating the secret
[02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:28.280]  sure sure what about the reports of trading secret service like dogs well i there's a
[02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:31.800]  chapter in that in the book where some of the things he did publicly i found disgraceful i
[02:56:31.800 --> 02:56:35.880]  mean blaming this secret service for the shutdown of the white house tours i mean think about this
[02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:40.600]  alex blaming a group of men and women who go to work every day with the idea that you know will die
[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:45.800]  first and you're not going to get a hangnail you know and then throwing them under the bus and here's
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:50.600]  another doozy for you you remember the charlie ebdo attacks and they had the march the solidarity
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:54.760]  march later and who didn't show up you know barack obama or anyone else from the white house for
[02:56:54.760 --> 02:56:58.600]  that matter but everybody else you know what did he do he said he said well the secret service
[02:56:58.600 --> 02:57:03.160]  told me not to go total complete lie he just made that up i mean this is the kind of character
[02:57:03.160 --> 02:57:06.920]  you're talking about here someone willing to throw these people under the bus really disturbing
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:12.680]  yeah well that's also what i was told about these folks uh so maybe he's gone so far now
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:16.920]  he's just not hiding what he's doing in there but that tells you a lot and it's certainly
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:20.840]  interesting i want to jam in you know we're just out of time i want to go to michael michael real
[02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:25.960]  quick question uh for our guests and then angelo wants to ask about bernie sanders go ahead michael
[02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:32.440]  okay question is with uh with all the leaking corruption that's going on right in front of
[02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:40.200]  our face why should us be conservative and not take action okay yeah why not are you saying
[02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:46.040]  with physical action yes physical action uh because that's what the system wants because
[02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:50.600]  i think we're winning the hearts and minds i think violence offensively is is a bad idea dan

[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:22.360]  returns but these lotteries and these power balls there are tax on the poor and people really should
[03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:26.760]  rebuke this more it's a sign of a declining society we're going to play this leon macadre report and
[03:01:26.760 --> 03:01:32.520]  come back with ted kennedy the famous green beret in studio with breaking al qaeda news leon
[03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:37.800]  macadre for info wars dot com i am out here reporting on what is being called power ball
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:44.840]  mania people have gone absolutely hysterical and driven up this prize it's the highest prize
[03:01:44.840 --> 03:01:50.440]  in lottery history one point five billion dollars and as you can see this power ball sign doesn't
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:59.800]  even go that high people have a one in 280 million chance that they could win this prize but they're
[03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:04.120]  lining up in droves to get their winning ticket so we're gonna go find out what would they spend
[03:02:04.120 --> 03:02:08.120]  their money on what would they do with this prize and then i'm going to see their reaction when i
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:12.280]  spoil all the fun and let them know that the winners already been announced do you guys play
[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:19.960]  power ball oh yeah word word we've played in yeah three states three states that's you're up in the
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:28.520]  odds north carolina uh tennessee and now in texas so now in north carolina tennessee do you have to
[03:02:28.520 --> 03:02:34.360]  pay state taxes as well if you win i don't know the answer to that we'll share we'll share so you
[03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:41.240]  don't win so you don't mind that the real winner is going to be the federal state and local government
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:48.600]  that's pretty sad but yes i i've i've heard that yes ma'am lottery or something i heard someone
[03:02:48.600 --> 03:02:53.640]  talk about it up there like there's chances that you win in it or like getting struck by lightning
[03:02:53.640 --> 03:03:00.840]  and five times yeah um i think you should still go for it yeah yeah you know in it you won't win it
[03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:05.960]  i have probably a better chance of making out with tom brady than i do winning the power ball
[03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:11.640]  this is true you have a one in two hundred and seventy two million percent chance of winning
[03:03:12.360 --> 03:03:17.320]  it's absurd so what would you do with your winnings though if you did play and you want
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:24.920]  make out with tom brady you know who the winner is though right they've already been announced
[03:03:24.920 --> 03:03:31.400]  no the government oh yeah are you okay with that that they take at least 40 percent here in texas
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:37.000]  it's only 40 percent because we don't play state taxes but in other places it's 68 percent yeah it
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:41.240]  doesn't matter it's still more than you had and that's the way life works here i don't want that
[03:03:41.240 --> 03:03:47.480]  much money really why you've heard too much horror stories the soul of a gremlin how's that i would
[03:03:47.480 --> 03:03:51.640]  do so much mischief with it oh my god the one guy said he was gonna get hookers and blow
[03:03:51.640 --> 03:04:01.320]  no that video went viral what would what would you do if you won the power ball
[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:07.640]  oh man i couldn't imagine i would i would i would invest a lot of investments and no
[03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:14.520]  and party party because i'm sure if i won the power ball there'd be people up in the line with
[03:04:14.520 --> 03:04:21.240]  their hands out wanting to take it one way or the other either way if i had seven million of that
[03:04:21.240 --> 03:04:27.000]  i'd be happy enough well so you're not worried about the power ball curse though no what do you
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:30.840]  think about those people that they like win all this money and then their lives are ruined how does
[03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:40.120]  it i think they're idiots um uh yeah i mean really they're just idiots um they should have given
[03:04:40.120 --> 03:04:56.040]  some of it away and um you know if you fly too close to the sun you get burnt man uh what can i say
[03:04:58.520 --> 03:05:05.000]  hillary clinton is running for president as an advocate for women's rights but there is a shocking
[03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:11.480]  side to her story that has been carefully covered up until now the notion that hillary has somehow
[03:05:11.480 --> 03:05:17.800]  been an advocate for women no bill rapes them physically and then hillary rapes them psychologically

[03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:47.880]  and i've gotten a chance to meet tim kennedy out at some uh local uh events i know he's been friends
[03:08:47.880 --> 03:08:52.440]  for a couple years and training partners with my good high school friend chain steiner who's no
[03:08:52.440 --> 03:08:56.360]  stranger to the show and then he was coming about a day just to check out the office we were going
[03:08:56.360 --> 03:09:02.920]  to get some lunch after he was training uh with shane uh over to local jujitsu place and they just
[03:09:02.920 --> 03:09:08.440]  dropped this bombshell that hey the fbi visited me yesterday this hasn't really broken yet i just
[03:09:08.440 --> 03:09:14.040]  put it on my facebook they said isis is in houston basically and is going to be trying to come after
[03:09:14.040 --> 03:09:18.120]  me and there's a reason he's been involved directly taking out a lot of high value targets
[03:09:18.120 --> 03:09:22.760]  that's classified he can't talk about it he's a famous uh green beret he's an active ranger
[03:09:22.760 --> 03:09:26.680]  qualified green beret special forces sniper with tours in iraq afghanistan as well as other
[03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:31.640]  locations around the globe after being awarded the green beret in 2005 he was deployed in operation
[03:09:31.640 --> 03:09:35.880]  enduring freedom and operation iraqi freedom attending sniper school addition to many other
[03:09:35.880 --> 03:09:41.560]  advanced special operations courses he was deployed in 2008 during this time he wrote a three part
[03:09:41.560 --> 03:09:47.800]  series of letters uh from a foreign land that chronicles his time in combat he currently competes
[03:09:47.800 --> 03:09:52.440]  in the ufc's middleweight division going as high as number two uh kennedy is one of the few fighters
[03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:56.440]  who simultaneously serve full time in the united states army while fighting professionally and now
[03:09:56.440 --> 03:10:04.120]  he hosts the show hunting hitler that's a giant uh hit success uh just amazing and he's involved
[03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:09.960]  also in a co-owns ranger up which i just absolutely come to my guys when we're designing t-shirts and
[03:10:09.960 --> 03:10:14.120]  say don't copy them but that's what i like and it's like just just more and more great stuff
[03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:20.200]  you're involved with tim kennedy mm a dot com uh is his website so he was just coming by
[03:10:20.200 --> 03:10:24.120]  because we were talking about in a few weeks going out shooting uh you know just hanging out you
[03:10:24.120 --> 03:10:28.280]  know he's got a family i got family kids i hang out with change you know family and his wife and
[03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:33.480]  kids so we're just you know friends and then he dropped this bombshell and my cousin got out of
[03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:37.720]  the army last year he asked me not really to talk about it too much but they've had stuff sent to
[03:10:37.720 --> 03:10:41.320]  their mailboxes from the drug cartel threatening hey we know where you live we're going to cut your
[03:10:41.320 --> 03:10:45.960]  head off stuff like that but he's already been in 30 plus years so he got out not because of that
[03:10:45.960 --> 03:10:53.000]  but this is directly al-qaeda because despite the fact that folks don't know what tim's done because
[03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:58.680]  it's classified they obviously know for whatever reason uh and this is a pretty big serious breaking
[03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:05.160]  news here now that's my that's my intro we're doing facebook mentions uh but uh i said years ago this
[03:11:05.160 --> 03:11:11.320]  isis spinoff of al-qaeda is big a lot bigger than al-qaeda was because i'm on the ground i get the
[03:11:11.320 --> 03:11:17.320]  threats i see them at ferguson and in new york and i see the signs i see the stickers it's trendy
[03:11:17.320 --> 03:11:22.920]  with the left and uh it's it's in texas we go out to these islamic training centers and get
[03:11:22.920 --> 03:11:27.640]  death threats we get hacked we get uh they put joe bigs former staff sergeant us army
[03:11:27.640 --> 03:11:32.840]  decorated combat vet they put him in isis videos um when he went down to the border to show him on
[03:11:32.840 --> 03:11:37.560]  the texas border so this is what they do but but but tim kennedy just like bin laden's a high value
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:42.920]  target or was he's a high value target now tim i just set the stage is that accurate what i said
[03:11:42.920 --> 03:11:47.720]  correct me if i'm wrong you're the expert and and please break down in as much detail as you can
[03:11:47.720 --> 03:11:52.440]  about the personal uh federal beer of investigation visit and warning you've gotten it's great to have
[03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:56.680]  you here in the info war i've been a fan for a long time so just appreciate you having me
[03:11:56.680 --> 03:12:02.920]  uh you know from what they said the fbi um the the credible threat came from
[03:12:04.680 --> 03:12:08.920]  every every day i get five to ten people saying hey i hate you you're gonna die i want to kill
[03:12:08.920 --> 03:12:14.040]  you everything that you stand for i hate um what makes this significant is um you know this one was
[03:12:14.040 --> 03:12:19.720]  geotagged and they had they had content that they couldn't have gotten from anywhere else besides
[03:12:19.720 --> 03:12:23.800]  first person so they had pictures of a guy's head that they had cut off and they said this is going
[03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:29.880]  to be you um the geotag picture was was you know close enough that the fbi says hey this is significant
[03:12:29.880 --> 03:12:35.240]  and that's why we're that's why we're talking to you right now um the problem was that i've been
[03:12:35.240 --> 03:12:40.840]  doing this for 13 years you know um i i don't know if i'm sensitized to it or i i just don't care and
[03:12:40.840 --> 03:12:46.840]  i have zero respect for the cowards that they are um and the fbi is like you're not normal you
[03:12:46.840 --> 03:12:50.680]  should be a little bit freaked out by this i don't know let them come i don't you know like i i've
[03:12:50.680 --> 03:12:53.960]  been traveling all over the world to find these guys and now they're going to come to texas last
[03:12:53.960 --> 03:12:58.600]  time they gave it a whirl was in garland and i didn't go so well for them so you know like come to
[03:12:58.600 --> 03:13:02.520]  central texas and see how this is going to work you know they're the only thing they got going for
[03:13:02.520 --> 03:13:07.560]  them is they're brutal they're evil and they have no respect for human life they're uneducated they're
[03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:12.280]  weak they're stupid um but they have no respect for anything and they'll take advantage of the
[03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:17.960]  weakest sheep that they can get their hands on and that's just not going to be me well it certainly
[03:13:17.960 --> 03:13:24.520]  shows that they are upset about your success the fact you survived all those operations in clandestine
[03:13:25.160 --> 03:13:28.520]  fights you were in and it's too bad you can't write a book about that it's pretty interesting
[03:13:28.520 --> 03:13:33.000]  stuff just from folks i've talked to in the military but obviously you can't get into that
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:38.520]  here today but there's a reason they don't like you yeah you know i was in some of the most elite
[03:13:38.520 --> 03:13:45.320]  you units that special operations have um i was in the missions to go get the guys that they have
[03:13:45.320 --> 03:13:50.520]  worshiped you know their entire lives you know like as i love chris kyle and marx latrell you
[03:13:50.520 --> 03:13:56.360]  know like and those are heroes the shoe guards the gordon's um you know that wing the isis
[03:13:56.360 --> 03:14:01.400]  talcaida they have their own guys that they do that well i'm the guy that went and found those
[03:14:01.400 --> 03:14:08.040]  dudes and uh they they hate that about me and now um the success that i'm having not only as a shooter
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:12.760]  but now as you know as a ufc athlete you know i'm a contender for the title one of the top fighters
[03:14:12.760 --> 03:14:17.800]  in the world and uh and i still stand true to the values you're winning shooting champions you're
[03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:23.720]  winning ufc uh big bouts you've got a hit show on um discovery challenge at history with a history
[03:14:23.720 --> 03:14:27.720]  channel that's my hunting hit where i've seen it quite a few times is great i mean they certainly
[03:14:27.720 --> 03:14:30.840]  must not like that no they hate me they hate everything about me they hate everything about
[03:14:30.840 --> 03:14:34.120]  you they hate everything we stand for you know they're gonna do anything that they can to find the
[03:14:34.840 --> 03:14:39.480]  the weakest softest target around us i know you're still involved with the military and
[03:14:39.480 --> 03:14:43.800]  active duty and things you can't get into all that but we've had seen top generals like the
[03:14:43.800 --> 03:14:48.360]  former head of defense intelligence come out and say we were ordered to basically aid al-Nusra
[03:14:48.360 --> 03:14:53.480]  which is al-qaeda in syria it's a horrible thing we followed orders now it's out of control we see
[03:14:53.480 --> 03:14:57.720]  other generals coming out the head of south com coming out and saying i don't want to follow the
[03:14:57.720 --> 03:15:03.160]  orders i've got to women in frontline combat will ruin the military that's unprecedented to have
[03:15:03.160 --> 03:15:11.480]  generals speaking out that that shows you how bad obama is i've never imagined that would
[03:15:11.480 --> 03:15:16.280]  have this climate in the military um you know like we told the line you know you you tell us what to
[03:15:16.280 --> 03:15:21.160]  do especially in special operations we're fire and forget you say go do this we're gonna go do it
[03:15:21.160 --> 03:15:26.360]  better than you would have you know imagined it to be possible um and we're gonna stay quiet about
[03:15:26.360 --> 03:15:31.640]  it you know like our our motto is the the quite professionals this is not the culture of special
[03:15:31.640 --> 03:15:36.440]  operations to go in front and say no this was not right we shouldn't have done this no that's
[03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:40.040]  stupid you're gonna get soldiers killed no we shouldn't have women here like that is not the
[03:15:40.040 --> 03:15:44.840]  culture of special operations but the fact that we are coming out and saying that really demonstrates
[03:15:44.840 --> 03:15:50.200]  that there's a gigantic problem well there's a midmitted calling and a purge of the top brass
[03:15:50.200 --> 03:15:54.680]  that aren't traitors i mean let's just get down the brass tacks and it's going all the way down
[03:15:54.680 --> 03:16:00.840]  to the um non-commissioned officers from all my sources and it's just unprecedented that
[03:16:00.840 --> 03:16:04.760]  everything we know it's like bonjino the former top secret service agent was on earlier
[03:16:04.760 --> 03:16:08.920]  said in the previous interview he said alex not only are you accurate it's worse than you know
[03:16:08.920 --> 03:16:13.640]  how could it be worse than i know i because they can't tell me it's secret it's just worse than i
[03:16:13.640 --> 03:16:18.840]  know okay well that's that's not that's not refreshing well i mean you can look at like
[03:16:18.840 --> 03:16:24.040]  micro examples but Benghazi for instance you know we're we have an idea of what happened we know we
[03:16:24.040 --> 03:16:29.320]  we have details but really like what special forces guys were on helicopters ready to find
[03:16:29.320 --> 03:16:36.040]  alivia um what general was saying no you can't go we don't have access to that stuff so you know
[03:16:36.040 --> 03:16:41.400]  yeah all i can say is you have no idea how bad it was or how bad it is because we there's no way
[03:16:41.400 --> 03:16:44.840]  tell me well i was told about colonel schaefer right after it happened he got in a bunch of trouble
[03:16:44.840 --> 03:16:49.560]  but met met it out of it uh and of course he used to run the anti-bin Laden units and the rest of it
[03:16:49.560 --> 03:16:54.200]  uh was sent to colonel schaefer that no they had helicopters they had planes they could be there
[03:16:54.200 --> 03:16:59.800]  in an hour out of out of italy they were ordered to stand down and then you ask why well somebody
[03:16:59.800 --> 03:17:05.480]  wanted those weapons to be able to be transferred to syria yeah yeah and that's that's micro you
[03:17:05.480 --> 03:17:10.600]  know and if that's the personification of the entire climate or other macro problems well it
[03:17:10.600 --> 03:17:16.680]  shows obama and hillary's about the military and about their own ambassador they're just they're
[03:17:16.680 --> 03:17:21.400]  just unbelievably bad news and i'm not sure to demonize them i don't even like going up against
[03:17:21.400 --> 03:17:25.480]  these people they're so dangerous but at a certain point who are these people i mean they're just
[03:17:25.480 --> 03:17:32.120]  they're out of control they are and that's frightening but you know it doesn't that's external
[03:17:32.120 --> 03:17:37.000]  and i can only be responsible for what i do and what i say um so i understand we're going to skip
[03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:41.720]  this network break or the bottom of the hour uh you're also involved as i mentioned uh one of the
[03:17:41.720 --> 03:17:46.120]  co-owners and heads of ranger up tell us tell us about some of the work you're doing some of the
[03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:50.040]  things you're promoting because something like ranger up such a you know small company now so
[03:17:50.040 --> 03:17:55.480]  big and successful promoting basic ideas of freedom like george washington and stuff we do that too
[03:17:55.480 --> 03:17:59.480]  i mean really bringing back what made america great and seeing it so popular that's where
[03:17:59.480 --> 03:18:04.200]  the real info war is going to be won in the culture yeah ironically or tragically i'm not
[03:18:04.200 --> 03:18:10.120]  sure which our ceo nick palmashano uh he also had a visit from the fbi and it was the exact same
[03:18:10.120 --> 03:18:15.720]  thing for him you know they said you as a ceo and our company ranger up you guys are specifically
[03:18:15.720 --> 03:18:20.840]  being targeted um were located in north carolina and it was the same type of thing that they had
[03:18:20.840 --> 03:18:26.200]  regional uh concerns like we know that there's people here that hate you and don't want you to
[03:18:26.200 --> 03:18:30.600]  exist so they're you know like they're feeling my pains you know i'm personal but on the business
[03:18:30.600 --> 03:18:35.800]  level you know we had to we had all of our employers employees go get concealed carry license and
[03:18:35.800 --> 03:18:41.080]  you know huge security systems um that's what we did too it's tragic that we have to do that but
[03:18:41.080 --> 03:18:48.840]  um the company itself ranger up military owners uh ranger special forces founders and we believe it
[03:18:48.840 --> 03:18:56.360]  in america we we we exaggerate at every opportunity the wonderful foundation of where we came from
[03:18:56.360 --> 03:19:03.080]  and uh whether we're making church about it making movies about it making tv shows making videos uh
[03:19:03.080 --> 03:19:07.960]  we find everything that we can about it's hard to exaggerate the founding fathers you really
[03:19:07.960 --> 03:19:12.040]  read even the french and british histories of even the british when george washington died
[03:19:12.040 --> 03:19:16.520]  you know i couldn't do flags at half mast i mean it was just such a badass yeah love them edison
[03:19:16.520 --> 03:19:21.080]  is frank linds like those those are my gods what about andrew jackson is a special obstacle
[03:19:21.080 --> 03:19:25.160]  with stuff those people did baby crocket george washington you know like people forget like
[03:19:25.160 --> 03:19:29.480]  that that's the guys that he was in frontier wars for 20 years going across freezing rivers
[03:19:29.480 --> 03:19:35.320]  with a musket and being like yeah i'll go take on the germans powerful is crazy yeah folks will
[03:19:35.320 --> 03:19:39.000]  yeah folks will know not just the british at that battle at trent and it was the british and the
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:43.880]  hessians yes the german special troops i tell you it's just amazing how tough those guys were
[03:19:43.880 --> 03:19:48.440]  were hauling cannons 100 miles with with no shoes blood i mean that's pretty tough guys yeah
[03:19:48.440 --> 03:19:52.680]  especially back then folks weren't as well i tell you what getting back to this whole al-qaeda thing
[03:19:53.320 --> 03:19:57.720]  i mean i i thought the government was using the threat of al-qaeda to take our liberties
[03:19:57.720 --> 03:20:02.680]  domestically i was all for taking out but now with ices they are just all over the place
[03:20:02.680 --> 03:20:08.040]  years ago i was saying this is real it's coming this is a big movement this has got young people
[03:20:08.040 --> 03:20:11.960]  involved they're recruiting all over the west i mean i think personally you've dealt with them but
[03:20:11.960 --> 03:20:15.480]  i think ices personally is like five times the threat of al-qaeda i mean they just seem
[03:20:16.600 --> 03:20:21.800]  what would you say about them they're efficiency in recruiting um and and they're so smart and so
[03:20:21.800 --> 03:20:26.040]  far ahead you know using immigration opportunities you know being like oh no no look look at these
[03:20:26.040 --> 03:20:31.080]  horrible um women and that are impoverished we need to get them out of these war zones and
[03:20:31.080 --> 03:20:34.840]  so for every one female that we bring into germany we're also going to bring five military
[03:20:34.840 --> 03:20:38.760]  age men that are going to come in and you know rape every single woman that we can find in cologne
[03:20:38.760 --> 03:20:43.560]  germany um you know don't think that they're not doing that here right now that those guys aren't
[03:20:43.560 --> 03:20:46.840]  going to Chicago that they're not going to be in detroit you know every single metropolis
[03:20:47.880 --> 03:20:53.640]  they're recruiting heavily they're going after the low informed the low second so socioeconomic
[03:20:53.640 --> 03:20:58.520]  demographics and they are finding people the homegrown terrorist so the sandbrunner didinos
[03:20:58.520 --> 03:21:02.360]  that's going to happen and it's going to get worse before it gets better and the fbi for
[03:21:02.360 --> 03:21:06.120]  two years was tracking them so the justice department came in with a criminal investigation
[03:21:06.120 --> 03:21:10.760]  and blocked them saying you're being racist and then obama for two days told the fbi not to say
[03:21:10.760 --> 03:21:18.120]  it was islamic terror let me ask you this rapes all over europe attacks murders uh more attacks
[03:21:18.120 --> 03:21:24.040]  more attacks this week with with bomb vests and guns and police stations and attacks in nightclubs
[03:21:24.040 --> 03:21:29.240]  and in in canada and attacks in indonesia blowing up shopping malls and our media is just saying
[03:21:29.240 --> 03:21:34.680]  there is no islamic terror there is no islamic terror why is the left or disagree if you do so
[03:21:34.680 --> 03:21:41.240]  allied with radical islam that literally will put their women in a beekeeper suit sexually mutilate
[03:21:41.240 --> 03:21:46.600]  them blow up all the churches and cut our heads off what's wrong with these people they're in love
[03:21:46.600 --> 03:21:55.560]  with jihad i have no idea you know there's there's this logical point of departure where we i can
[03:21:55.560 --> 03:21:59.560]  understand you know that the pc side of it we don't offend we want to be open-minded we want to be
[03:21:59.560 --> 03:22:06.040]  accepting we want to you know give other cultures opportunities i respect that but at some point
[03:22:06.040 --> 03:22:13.320]  you have to say this ideology is evil and it's it's mutated and into such this horrific thing
[03:22:13.320 --> 03:22:18.120]  that's not what it originally was maybe islam was a beautiful thing um you know a few hundred years
[03:22:18.120 --> 03:22:23.880]  ago it is not now you know what it is now if there if there was a moderate majority that said okay
[03:22:23.880 --> 03:22:28.120]  these extremists these fanatics are the ones that are doing these horrific things that yeah maybe
[03:22:28.120 --> 03:22:32.840]  but there's not there is no moderate majority that is standing up and saying these people are wrong
[03:22:32.840 --> 03:22:36.840]  these what they're doing is evil the vast majority of them are the ones that are doing the
[03:22:36.840 --> 03:22:42.280]  horrific acts in cologne germany you know in san bernadino every and it's just going to get worse
[03:22:42.280 --> 03:22:46.120]  especially here it's funny i didn't know we were going to be doing this a few hours ago and i was
[03:22:46.120 --> 03:22:51.080]  talking about how they claim that the west caused the crusades when the crusades were a response
[03:22:51.080 --> 03:22:56.360]  to radical islam islam period conquering most of europe enslaving the women taking over spain
[03:22:56.360 --> 03:23:00.680]  idly you name it i said i like how you're wearing a crusader shirt and i mean correct me what it is
[03:23:00.680 --> 03:23:07.240]  but you said your unit actually wore those tell folks about this shirt yeah so this does not fall
[03:23:07.240 --> 03:23:12.680]  into the pc category and i are we the cuss on here no i probably don't want to it's yeah i don't i
[03:23:12.680 --> 03:23:16.200]  don't i have no it's am and fm radio but we can believe it go ahead all right i don't give a
[03:23:16.200 --> 03:23:23.000]  shit about pc i never have um and you know if this offends people then i'm sorry but my unit wore
[03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:28.920]  the crusader crosses not because we hated islam but we hated what they were doing so this this symbol
[03:23:28.920 --> 03:23:34.920]  was the special forces rangers we wore crusader things one to recognize and to appreciate who we
[03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:41.320]  were and what we're they're doing as a team and as a unit but most importantly to demonize the people
[03:23:42.200 --> 03:23:49.000]  that were fighting us and the horrific acts that they that they do to other humans why do they
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:54.600]  chop the women's heads off put the young girls into sex slavery eat people's hearts on tv all that
[03:23:54.600 --> 03:23:58.680]  does is make me want to fight him it doesn't scare me what is the tactic of acting like psychos
[03:23:58.680 --> 03:24:04.760]  well you have balls that you just summarize the problem so terrorism it's it's to achieve an objective
[03:24:04.760 --> 03:24:10.360]  through the means of force or fear fear being the most important aspect of that so they try to do these
[03:24:10.360 --> 03:24:15.720]  awful things that would scare any normal person right and you look at that say oh my god that is
[03:24:15.720 --> 03:24:19.000]  horrible i would never want that to happen that can't happen here in the united states will do
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:24.520]  anything to prevent that from happening that is them using fear as leverage i i'm not scared of them
[03:24:24.520 --> 03:24:28.520]  they're a bunch of cowards they they fight women and children unarmed journals so it's propaganda
[03:24:28.520 --> 03:24:33.640]  targeting the trendy liberals and people exactly i think have stock homes chendralmen are scared of
[03:24:33.640 --> 03:24:37.560]  it that's why they're trying to join with radical islam hoping they leave them alone yeah which
[03:24:37.560 --> 03:24:42.280]  doesn't happen you look at the most accepting countries in all of europe france being one of
[03:24:42.280 --> 03:24:47.480]  them that opened their arms and said you know immigrants please come germany reference exactly
[03:24:48.520 --> 03:24:52.920]  and they're getting destroyed they're getting screwed left and right they have no respect
[03:24:52.920 --> 03:24:58.280]  if you say listen we want to simulate you into our culture you can come you're welcome they don't
[03:24:58.280 --> 03:25:01.960]  care they don't want to simulate they want you to become what they are and they're going to kill you
[03:25:01.960 --> 03:25:06.920]  if you don't period they're going to throw you off a roof if you're gay they're going to murder you
[03:25:06.920 --> 03:25:11.480]  if you don't join them they're going to torture your kids in front like they're evil and then
[03:25:11.480 --> 03:25:15.320]  when they're doing it the feminists came out in germany and the national news and the mayor
[03:25:15.320 --> 03:25:20.200]  and said women need to learn how to hold guys don't dress so sexy and and and those of you
[03:25:20.200 --> 03:25:25.240]  protesting this you're worse than these people and i read it it's like it's like a joke how sick
[03:25:25.240 --> 03:25:30.920]  these people are it's insane the mayor of cologne germany when she's like no these women should
[03:25:30.920 --> 03:25:33.560]  you know they they shouldn't have been out they shouldn't have been alone that maybe they were
[03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:39.160]  dressed in two productive provocatively like are we back in the 16th century where we're we're
[03:25:39.160 --> 03:25:43.960]  supposed to comply with these people and they call us not liberal because we want to defend
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:48.760]  western values of freedom like thomas jefferson but these new liberals are not liberals yeah welcome

[03:26:30.840 --> 03:26:35.880]  and we move forward with the assumption that 1945 hitler didn't die in a bunker and they sent me
[03:26:35.880 --> 03:26:39.960]  and a team of other investigators to find out if it was possible if he escaped the bunker where he
[03:26:39.960 --> 03:26:45.960]  would have gone and so i went to south america specifically a lot of time in argentina um brazil
[03:26:45.960 --> 03:26:50.680]  and columbia beautiful down there oh my god it's gorgeous it's absolutely breathtaking i like that
[03:26:50.680 --> 03:26:58.920]  pretty is that oh so beautiful um and you know i i have made plans to you know even protect obama
[03:26:58.920 --> 03:27:03.880]  in in some of the places that he's been um so they took that expertise and experience and sent me
[03:27:03.880 --> 03:27:09.320]  into south america to see what hitler could have done and where he could have gone we ended up finding
[03:27:09.320 --> 03:27:12.840]  it to be very reasonable that he made it out of the bunker and made it south america and you
[03:27:12.840 --> 03:27:16.840]  even have the memos from the cia and fb i'm knowing he'd gotten out i mean that skull the russians
[03:27:16.840 --> 03:27:21.000]  had was a woman as you guys show and yeah it's just i don't want to give it away but uh and of
[03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:24.440]  course you were telling me some inside baseball i can't repeat it about all the other stuff that
[03:27:24.440 --> 03:27:29.000]  happened that hit the cutting room floor i have no idea how it was end of the universe
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:33.880]  successful show you know we're two two million views is is huge for history channel in that in
[03:27:33.880 --> 03:27:40.840]  that time um but it airs hundreds of times yeah i have no idea how they uh cut because all the cool
[03:27:40.840 --> 03:27:45.800]  things that happened when we're in south america they edited you know from from me bribing people
[03:27:45.800 --> 03:27:49.640]  to dudes on scooters rolling up with machetes saying if you have asked another question about
[03:27:49.640 --> 03:27:54.680]  nazis you know we're going to kill you um us being followed and bare loce you know there's a lot of
[03:27:54.680 --> 03:27:58.360]  stuff that just never even made it because you know they they had to tell story and the narrative
[03:27:58.360 --> 03:28:02.280]  needed sure and for those that well it's for a dumb dumb public let's be honest but i mean for
[03:28:02.280 --> 03:28:05.080]  those that don't know there's giant german communities all over the place down there it's
[03:28:05.080 --> 03:28:09.880]  admitted that just tons of nazis went down there hundreds of millions of dollars not not only
[03:28:09.880 --> 03:28:14.600]  did hundreds of nazis or thousands of nazis escaped to south america we know that that's not
[03:28:14.600 --> 03:28:20.040]  questioned some of them have been caught um some have been prosecuted but the the worst part is
[03:28:20.040 --> 03:28:24.360]  the hundreds of millions of dollars and not not nowadays hundreds of millions of dollars
[03:28:24.360 --> 03:28:29.640]  hundreds of millions of dollars in 1945 billions yeah uh that made it to south america specifically
[03:28:29.640 --> 03:28:35.400]  argentina estates that have been owned since the late thirties that are worth now uh you know
[03:28:35.400 --> 03:28:40.040]  hot hundreds of millions dollars that have been owned by german corporations since the beginning

[03:35:25.160 --> 03:35:29.800]  people a lot at the same time i wish they just wouldn't have open borders and wouldn't be flying in
[03:35:29.800 --> 03:35:36.600]  jets on government contracts and not even checking their ids when that was in cbs news
[03:35:36.600 --> 03:35:39.880]  and new york daily news with a straight face i mean i'd heard it was happening but
[03:35:39.880 --> 03:35:43.800]  they don't even look at their ids and just let them in and then they disappear and the high
[03:35:43.800 --> 03:35:51.240]  school i graduated from anderson high and you know the same year as shane did 1993 um the same school
[03:35:51.240 --> 03:35:57.320]  i went to school at is has 300 plus people from quote syria who were mainly as you know invaders
[03:35:57.320 --> 03:36:03.320]  that came in got kicked out uh these are their kids i mean the school i went to 300 no wonder they
[03:36:03.320 --> 03:36:08.760]  won't tell governors the numbers no i learned another school one of my friends his alma mater
[03:36:08.760 --> 03:36:13.800]  has 200 plus lbj and then i looked at another high school in austin has over 100 and i started
[03:36:13.800 --> 03:36:16.520]  calling other ones they said we're not going to answer your questions we heard your calling doing
[03:36:16.520 --> 03:36:21.720]  a report yeah so it's like wait a minute every high school has hundreds we're talking about
[03:36:21.720 --> 03:36:27.480]  a trojan horse sleeper cells it's obvious what is the plan here i mean there's going to be terror
[03:36:27.480 --> 03:36:31.480]  attacks they're going to take my rights or after sam bernadino he blamed the second amendment what
[03:36:31.480 --> 03:36:37.000]  do you think's going on tim i think that Shakira law uh is going to be applied to you know east
[03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:41.880]  austin you're like no no um i have a friend i can't say who he works for but he works with
[03:36:41.880 --> 03:36:48.120]  immigration and he's on the border here in texas and he's been dealing with tons and tons of uh
[03:36:48.120 --> 03:36:55.480]  uh you know mexicans crossing the border for the past few years this month or this year in the in
[03:36:55.480 --> 03:36:59.480]  the past three four months he's never seen anything like it where he's not having to speak
[03:36:59.480 --> 03:37:05.080]  spanish they're having to bring translators in for syrians thousands of them that was the story
[03:37:05.080 --> 03:37:10.520]  in anderson they had to bring in like 15 translators for the 300 kids sorry yeah so he's a medical
[03:37:10.520 --> 03:37:14.440]  professional and normally he checks people that come through the country to make sure you know
[03:37:14.440 --> 03:37:18.280]  they don't have tb or something and you know he speaks spanish and that's you know one of the
[03:37:18.280 --> 03:37:23.720]  reasons why they hired him and he's a special forces guy now he he has to bring in a translator
[03:37:23.720 --> 03:37:28.440]  because he's working on the texas border at mexico and uh he's not speaking spanish they're bringing
[03:37:28.440 --> 03:37:32.920]  in translators so that he can do these tests with syrians and then they get on the news and go
[03:37:32.920 --> 03:37:37.080]  it's a conspiracy that anyone's coming across the border and then we have the board patrol
[03:37:37.080 --> 03:37:43.080]  numbers thousands a month of other than mexican and almost all of them are islamic yeah it's it's
[03:37:43.080 --> 03:37:46.760]  coming it's going to get worse well okay well what are they going to do then when there's
[03:37:46.760 --> 03:37:51.080]  san bernadinos every week or every month which is pretty much already happening in europe
[03:37:51.080 --> 03:37:54.680]  and and then they're not going to get the blame for bringing them in to see something doesn't add
[03:37:54.680 --> 03:37:59.960]  up here well there's going to be a break breaking point you know at some point that needle's going
[03:37:59.960 --> 03:38:04.920]  to move that the last straw is going to get on the camel's back um you know like how many terrorist
[03:38:04.920 --> 03:38:11.160]  attacks do we get in japan from islamic radicals zero why is that it'll let them in we'll get there
[03:38:11.160 --> 03:38:15.160]  it's it's going to happen san bernadinos going to happen it's going to happen in chicago philadelphia
[03:38:15.160 --> 03:38:20.040]  where we're saying no no don't say that no islamic islamic terror stop the cop yeah that walks up
[03:38:20.040 --> 03:38:24.920]  and shoots a cop third or tries to shoot a cop 13 times hits him a few times as he's screaming
[03:38:24.920 --> 03:38:30.040]  that he's doing it for a la and then changes and and then credits the attack to isis on his own
[03:38:30.040 --> 03:38:35.240]  facebook and then the media tried to spend and say it wasn't yeah it was and those that's going
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:41.400]  to happen and at some point we 330 million americans are going to say we're done we're at it's
[03:38:41.400 --> 03:38:45.560]  we have to reach that point sooner better than later because you know there's only so many dudes like
[03:38:45.560 --> 03:38:54.280]  me that um can be hard targets you know i don't i don't want my kids schools to be hard targets
[03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:57.400]  that's not what i don't want my kids to go in a way that's a good thing that we're trying to come
[03:38:57.400 --> 03:39:00.920]  after you that knows how to defend yourself instead of it's so cowardly how they go to a
[03:39:00.920 --> 03:39:06.200]  convention center or a school or their own workers a bunch of liberals they know we're unarmed then
[03:39:06.200 --> 03:39:10.200]  they ask you that that came out you know are you a christian are you jewish and would shoot them
[03:39:10.200 --> 03:39:14.280]  and then they don't even call it a hate crime it's just i don't know the left is really a just a
[03:39:14.280 --> 03:39:18.520]  sick group i mean that's that's just they're really sick they're not real liberals well listen tim

[03:40:06.280 --> 03:40:09.960]  you know a sheepdog is the guy that's always there that's gonna protect his flock and there's
[03:40:09.960 --> 03:40:14.840]  thousands there's tens of thousands of us yeah we've been demonized of late to like these guys
[03:40:14.840 --> 03:40:19.080]  have post-traumatic stress that's not the key but statistically you're one of the lowest crime rate
[03:40:19.080 --> 03:40:23.240]  groups it's clear they're bringing in terrorists and then saying you're the enemy who does that
[03:40:23.240 --> 03:40:27.960]  tell you they are i mean this is pretty clear two plus two equals four they're bringing in terrorists
[03:40:27.960 --> 03:40:32.760]  and then saying our troops and our veterans and our men are the enemy that tells you who the people
[03:40:32.760 --> 03:40:38.200]  doing this are with and i can't even believe it but the the the arithmetic doesn't lie tim
[03:40:38.200 --> 03:40:42.840]  no it doesn't you know but dependant trust in your veterans dependant trust in your military
[03:40:42.840 --> 03:40:47.480]  we love this country we love what it was founded on most importantly we love the constitution
[03:40:47.480 --> 03:40:52.200]  we swear our oath into the military it's to defend the constitution foreign domestic and that
[03:40:52.200 --> 03:40:56.680]  that is deep within us that's never gonna go away well god bless you you know i just know this
[03:40:56.680 --> 03:41:01.560]  the system has jumped the shark and i'm sure of it now because so many prominent people
[03:41:01.560 --> 03:41:06.760]  liberal conservative libertarian famous directors famous producers billionaires people that have
[03:41:06.760 --> 03:41:10.920]  you know been leftist are contacting me saying we've woken up we know what's happening you're
[03:41:10.920 --> 03:41:15.480]  absolutely right uh they hate the republican establishment but they understand that the
[03:41:15.480 --> 03:41:19.080]  democrats have basically have cancer and it's spreading to the rest of the country
[03:41:19.080 --> 03:41:23.080]  and i and i think they really jumped the shark what do you feel not just in your intellectual
[03:41:23.080 --> 03:41:29.480]  understanding you're a smart guy but in your gut do you feel like momentum shifting i think
[03:41:29.480 --> 03:41:34.040]  momentum has stopped we're at this point like i said there was a vacuum and now there's a void
[03:41:34.040 --> 03:41:39.080]  and we can go one way or the other you know we can keep going down this this pc route of open arms
[03:41:39.080 --> 03:41:44.200]  acceptance or we can recognize of who we are and where we came from and uh and that can dictate
[03:41:44.200 --> 03:41:49.640]  where we can go don't forget what our founding fathers wrote and let that be our guide um
[03:41:50.920 --> 03:41:55.720]  that i don't think the momentum is going any which way right now we're we're stuck and we're
[03:41:55.720 --> 03:42:00.280]  gonna go we just have to be vocal and powerful about where you know i agree with you we're at
[03:42:00.280 --> 03:42:06.440]  a crossroads we're at that equilibrium point where it can tip either way on that knife edge
[03:42:06.440 --> 03:42:10.760]  we're at the crossroads we're at the point of no return we either turn back now or go in another
[03:42:10.760 --> 03:42:15.160]  direction back towards liberty or we're going down a stinking rattle give us liberty please
[03:42:15.800 --> 03:42:22.200]  tim kennedy great having you here amazing and uh tim kennedy mma.com rangerup.com we're with info

[03:42:43.240 --> 03:42:47.720]  this came off of texas public radio just at the end of the year last year syrian refugees at the
[03:42:47.720 --> 03:42:53.000]  border there's the headline and scroll down and apparently uh there's 21 syrian refugees many of
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:58.360]  them they say children and teenagers of course they never admit that it's uh but they always use

[03:43:03.560 --> 03:43:07.480]  they go i mean it's something's going on here right and that was my point this is texas texas
[03:43:07.480 --> 03:43:11.240]  public radio so they're going to put their spin on it they're not going to put the real news out
[03:43:11.240 --> 03:43:15.880]  that that you and tim are just talking about so far they say there's 104 syrians seeking a sound
[03:43:15.880 --> 03:43:21.240]  this year as of june twice as many as back it's impossible it's impossible guys just google

[03:43:46.280 --> 03:43:50.760]  probably about 10 30 i think we're going to go to tonight and talking about the debate we'll be
[03:43:50.760 --> 03:43:57.640]  criticizing what these republican gop candidates say in real time disclosing their lies in real
[03:43:57.640 --> 03:44:02.280]  time so join us in fact i'll show you if you go to the alex jones channel on youtube this is
[03:44:02.280 --> 03:44:06.760]  what it'll look like it'll say political science theater 3k and you just hit the play button and
[03:44:06.760 --> 03:44:12.680]  it'll start streaming that is one of the best ways to get the show we will take breaks whenever the
[03:44:12.680 --> 03:44:18.360]  debates the debaters over at fox news decided to take breaks but going back to this immigrant
[03:44:18.360 --> 03:44:24.680]  crisis this stage immigrant crisis that is really a planned invasion um i kind of like what the uh
[03:44:24.680 --> 03:44:29.960]  the leader the governor bavaria did he packed 31 immigrants onto a bus and sent them to berlin
[03:44:29.960 --> 03:44:35.080]  right in front of merkel's office he sent it to the chancellor lee in berlin of course they had a
[03:44:35.080 --> 03:44:41.400]  bus they're waiting to take them on to a local shelter but he said we just can't manage now
[03:44:41.400 --> 03:44:45.640]  when you talk about can't manage he he said it looks like there's 1800 coming to my district
[03:44:45.640 --> 03:44:49.880]  he says we'll take that many but we won't take any more so there he is kind of caving in instead
[03:44:49.880 --> 03:44:55.560]  of just saying no i don't want anybody into my district any of these immigrants because of
[03:44:55.560 --> 03:45:00.120]  you know what they're causing and i don't know if you've seen the videos we showed one i think on
[03:45:00.120 --> 03:45:07.080]  monday of a young lady being dragged into a subway station by a mob of angry young men who were going
[03:45:07.080 --> 03:45:12.920]  to rape her and there's been a a huge crisis in rapes a huge number of increase in rapes and this
[03:45:12.920 --> 03:45:18.760]  is not the new they had in the muslim countries they have a different view on rape than they do
[03:45:18.760 --> 03:45:24.040]  here in western countries so you're going to see more of that since we're on europe i'll go
[03:45:24.040 --> 03:45:29.480]  ahead and throw to this article from reuters eu safety watchdog hits back at scientists in
[03:45:29.480 --> 03:45:33.480]  glyphosate row now we've been talking about glyphosate for years and what it does now they're
[03:45:33.480 --> 03:45:39.160]  saying it could cause cancer but we know it attacks fertility in men and women but now the head of
[03:45:39.160 --> 03:45:43.240]  europe's food safety watchdog has written a group of nearly a hundred scientists strongly rejecting
[03:45:43.240 --> 03:45:48.440]  their criticisms in a row about the safety of weed killer ingredient glyphosate the european food
[03:45:48.440 --> 03:45:53.800]  safety authority which advises eu policymakers has issued an opinion saying glyphosate is unlikely
[03:45:53.800 --> 03:45:58.600]  to cause cancer and this is a an odds for what the international agency for research on cancer
[03:45:58.600 --> 03:46:03.400]  said what they said it probably is carcinogenic to humans but what you have here with the eu you
[03:46:03.400 --> 03:46:08.120]  have an outside body that's not been elected and so they have advisory groups that could come up and
[03:46:08.120 --> 03:46:13.000]  say well we we want to push glyphosate because it works with these gmo seeds that we're also trying
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:18.040]  to push into the into europe and into the european union so we're going to write an opinion that
[03:46:18.040 --> 03:46:22.440]  it's safe so then when you guys go out you have backing from us so then what they're going to do
[03:46:22.440 --> 03:46:27.320]  is say well now hey glyphosate safe we can have the glyphosate corn uh the gmo corn that's resistant
[03:46:27.320 --> 03:46:32.440]  to it and we can just plan all this stuff but you've got uh our countries like hungary which is
[03:46:32.440 --> 03:46:37.800]  they're putting vast controls on gm foods and that's what what can happen is because they're
[03:46:37.800 --> 03:46:43.160]  part of the eu the eu could then come in and impose its will which is the problem with all these
[03:46:43.160 --> 03:46:48.280]  big your your unions that's what leads to world government you got the eu you got the asian pacific
[03:46:48.280 --> 03:46:54.040]  union you got the north american union and they they think they're above sovereignty the sovereignty
[03:46:54.040 --> 03:46:59.480]  of independent nations so uh we're going to be talking about also when i have lianna and we're
[03:46:59.480 --> 03:47:03.480]  going to be previewing a little bit of her report she did an interview yesterday with a student who
[03:47:04.040 --> 03:47:08.520]  basically stood up and said no i'm not going to fill out your questionnaire about my sexual history
[03:47:08.520 --> 03:47:12.440]  about how many times i drink in my finances i don't think you need to know that so we're going to
[03:47:12.440 --> 03:47:16.680]  talk to her a little bit about that this was on drudge today usc apologizes for requiring students
[03:47:16.680 --> 03:47:22.520]  to detail sexual history and uh they're making students do this to qualify for financial aid she's
[03:47:22.520 --> 03:47:27.320]  going to have the skinny on that but i do want to finish up and then get to a joe biggs uh video
[03:47:27.320 --> 03:47:31.560]  we'll probably play half of it i don't think we're going to have time but ted cruz is now the front
[03:47:31.560 --> 03:47:37.480]  runner in iowa in the caucus and this came out uh yes uh this morning actually the brief cruz
[03:47:37.480 --> 03:47:43.960]  seeks to explain unreported goldman sax loan gp presidential candidate ted cruz responds to a
[03:47:43.960 --> 03:47:48.200]  news report that he failed to disclose a loan from goldman sax during his 2012 senate run by
[03:47:48.200 --> 03:47:54.200]  describing the problems as an inversion filing question which i love it when they use that uh
[03:47:54.200 --> 03:48:00.200]  that language like that and uh he also got a loan from city bank which they don't mention in there
[03:48:00.200 --> 03:48:04.760]  now back in 2013 we pointed out ted cruz's wife is a goldman sax vp this is a curtain
[03:48:04.760 --> 03:48:13.080]  memo article from october 22nd 2013 brock obama um so ted cruz is playing the inside the outsider
[03:48:13.080 --> 03:48:17.640]  role similar to what brock obama played in 2008 when his handlers portrayed him as a hope and change
[03:48:17.640 --> 03:48:22.920]  candidate out of nowhere cruz insiders connections is the same family affair his wife heidi is a
[03:48:22.920 --> 03:48:27.240]  goldman sax vice president in houston texas according to her linkedin profile of course she
[03:48:27.240 --> 03:48:32.680]  has taken a leave of absence during ted's uh running for the office she also served as an
[03:48:32.680 --> 03:48:37.560]  economic advisor for the bush administration in 2011 a cruise campaign spokesman portrayed heidi
[03:48:37.560 --> 03:48:41.880]  as an expert on north american trade in other words she's savvy when it comes to globalist
[03:48:41.880 --> 03:48:47.880]  transnational trade deals like nafta so be aware of stuff like this when you're looking at a
[03:48:47.880 --> 03:48:54.680]  presidential candidate um you know ted cruz he's he talks to talk but he did miss the audit the fed
[03:48:54.680 --> 03:49:01.160]  vote and uh ram paul pointed that out yesterday and i'd like to go to what he told glenn beck uh he
[03:49:01.160 --> 03:49:04.840]  told glenn beck and i have that up on the screen i strongly support auditing the fed indeed i was
[03:49:04.840 --> 03:49:09.160]  the original cosponsor of ron paul's audit the fed bill unfortunately was very clear yesterday
[03:49:09.160 --> 03:49:14.360]  the yesterday's vote wasn't going to secede it fell seven votes short so he said it was doomed
[03:49:14.360 --> 03:49:18.840]  to failure so he just kept on campaigning instead of why not just go up and take a stand sorry about
[03:49:18.840 --> 03:49:23.800]  that guys uh why not go up and take a stand you know what if a football team well since we're in
[03:49:23.800 --> 03:49:27.880]  the playoffs they're a big underdog they just decide well we're not going to show up we're just
[03:49:27.880 --> 03:49:31.800]  going to let give give the vote to the other team because we know we're not going to win
[03:49:31.800 --> 03:49:35.720]  everybody's saying we're not going to win so why not go out there and try to rally some
[03:49:35.720 --> 03:49:39.480]  people why not go reach across the aisle and try to get some of those democrats like elizabeth
[03:49:39.480 --> 03:49:44.360]  warren who claims she's against the big banks but then voted not to audit the fed voted nay
[03:49:44.360 --> 03:49:48.520]  on that you know the one one person who did vote who stepped across the aisles bernie sanders he
[03:49:48.520 --> 03:49:52.760]  voted to audit the fed so i gotta hand it to him there you know and that's the the one thing i can't
[03:49:52.760 --> 03:49:56.520]  say about bernie sanders is that he you know what you're getting you know you're getting a raving
[03:49:56.520 --> 03:50:01.480]  socialist who's going to tax the bejesus out of you so um guys i don't think we're going to have
[03:50:01.480 --> 03:50:07.480]  time to go to that report but i do want to show it to folks on the youtube channel right after um
[03:50:08.440 --> 03:50:13.720]  alex jones interviewed david jima uh joe big sat down and talked with him about his plan for

[03:55:31.800 --> 03:55:35.720]  very good now tonight you're gonna premiere a uh report that you've been working on
[03:55:35.720 --> 03:55:39.320]  you did an interview yesterday with a young student who stood up said no his mom
[03:55:39.880 --> 03:55:43.640]  obviously was also outraged at the questions they were asking him
[03:55:43.640 --> 03:55:48.920]  just get financial aid right is that what this is for well no no this is to attend school just to
[03:55:48.920 --> 03:55:54.360]  attend school register for these courses so everyone has heard about these mandatory online
[03:55:54.360 --> 03:55:59.720]  courses where they're asking students these really pervasive perverse questions you know how many
[03:55:59.720 --> 03:56:03.960]  times have you had sex in the last three months just things that they just getting really detailed
[03:56:03.960 --> 03:56:10.200]  it's like something you do when you sign up for tender right exactly and so um he refused to do it
[03:56:10.200 --> 03:56:15.880]  he thought it was a little odd that they were offering five dollar gift cards for a mandatory
[03:56:15.880 --> 03:56:21.560]  course so he was right then those were the flags going off for him but his mom did a lot of research
[03:56:21.560 --> 03:56:27.480]  and it turns out that they are basically overstepping the law there's a federal mandate that these
[03:56:27.480 --> 03:56:33.400]  colleges have to educate students on their health on alcohol consumption on sexual assault but the
[03:56:33.400 --> 03:56:37.720]  way that they're writing the software is that they're collecting and scooping up all of this
[03:56:37.720 --> 03:56:41.880]  personal data in order to do that instead of putting out data they're collecting they're
[03:56:41.880 --> 03:56:45.800]  collecting your data use it against them later say something comes up exactly well we reviewed
[03:56:45.800 --> 03:56:51.320]  your sexual history and you know you you fit right into our rapist profile exactly well and
[03:56:51.320 --> 03:56:54.680]  also one of the things is that it says right there in their privacy policy hey you know
[03:56:55.240 --> 03:56:59.560]  we don't know if there's any back doors into this software any viruses and we don't know how
[03:56:59.560 --> 03:57:04.600]  your information if something happens to it it's not our fault you can't sue us well it turns out
[03:57:04.600 --> 03:57:10.120]  the sponsors of this software are like american express walmart bank of america discover target
[03:57:10.840 --> 03:57:14.360]  you know all of these people that are really can't wait to get their hands on all of your
[03:57:14.360 --> 03:57:20.360]  child's personal information and people like google the bezos amazon they are
[03:57:21.560 --> 03:57:25.000]  investing in this software because they know that the federal government is
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:29.880]  mandating that your students have to take it but what parents don't understand is that this is an
[03:57:29.880 --> 03:57:35.160]  overstep of this federal mandate it doesn't mandate that they scoop up their personal information
[03:57:35.160 --> 03:57:41.000]  so it's time to to step up before this becomes the law so some quick thinking company came along
[03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:44.520]  said hey we could build a whole database and then we can share with all these other companies sell
[03:57:44.520 --> 03:57:48.200]  the information to them make a billion dollars exactly and check out so you're going to have
[03:57:48.200 --> 03:57:52.200]  that tonight uh we're also going to what else are you going to be covering tonight so we're
[03:57:52.200 --> 03:57:57.080]  going to be talking about that and then obviously some master debate coverage with you guys going
