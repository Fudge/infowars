[00:00.000 --> 00:11.340]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.340 --> 00:18.880]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.880 --> 00:28.860]  Texas Alex Jones have you noticed that all the sudden the British Prime
[00:28.860 --> 00:34.520]  Minister is saying multiculturalism has failed that basically Muslims are
[00:34.520 --> 00:41.280]  dangerous devils have you noticed that the president of France has come out and
[00:41.280 --> 00:49.960]  said that multiculturalism has failed the globalists knew that all of this was
[00:49.960 --> 00:53.720]  destined to fail to get all these different cultures and groups together
[00:53.720 --> 00:58.560]  and then play everyone off against each other government playing the
[00:58.560 --> 01:05.440]  referee oh people may have gotten along with each other in many communities
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.600]  but overall because of how these governments design this system it's
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.680]  designed to balkanize us and turn us against each other they bring in all
[01:16.680 --> 01:23.880]  of these different groups to destabilize regions so only a powerful central
[01:23.880 --> 01:29.520]  government can control it the Romans controlled Rome that way by encouraging
[01:29.520 --> 01:33.520]  people not they needed much encouragement people like to be around
[01:33.520 --> 01:38.080]  folks that they're like generally in different neighborhoods and you see
[01:38.080 --> 01:43.240]  that model of course in the big cities of Europe in New York in places like
[01:43.240 --> 01:48.000]  Los Angeles Chicago but I just have all the stacks of news here I thought it was
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.640]  interesting that the last few days all these different European leaders that's
[01:51.640 --> 01:58.280]  not just Sarkozy of France or of course the prime minister of England it's
[01:58.280 --> 02:02.840]  others coming out and saying this and why is that happening because the
[02:02.840 --> 02:09.840]  globalist admittedly have tried to force their past puppet
[02:09.840 --> 02:16.680]  Hussie Mubarak of Egypt to step down and that's still waffling back and forth so
[02:16.680 --> 02:21.400]  that they can basically get groups that are seen as more radical in positions
[02:21.400 --> 02:28.520]  to get on more of a war footing with Israel and the West so that the West has
[02:28.520 --> 02:35.640]  a pretext to go in there and blow the place to bits and that's why the New
[02:35.640 --> 02:39.520]  World Order has been caught over and over again financing every radical Muslim
[02:39.520 --> 02:46.080]  group out there at the head of all those groups are untouchables who always have
[02:46.080 --> 02:50.680]  pedigrees in Western intelligence agencies and we're all a lock you some
[02:50.680 --> 02:56.880]  of bin Laden this is admitted fact there for all to see but it's ignored like
[02:56.880 --> 03:02.320]  all that's un-American to read the Associated Press or Fox News reporting
[03:02.320 --> 03:07.880]  Amaral a lock he is secretly hanging out and working for the Pentagon well but
[03:07.880 --> 03:13.080]  it's admitted it's admitted that a some of bin Laden was called a hero in the
[03:13.080 --> 03:17.800]  late 1980s and that our own government helped create what is known as al-Qaeda
[03:17.800 --> 03:25.160]  today that's in Time Magazine Newsweek but oh it's blowback from him oh all the
[03:25.160 --> 03:32.480]  lock he it's blowback someone bin Laden it's blowback it's blowback blowback
[03:32.480 --> 03:40.000]  blowback blowback no it's not oh this blowback always allows the Empire to
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.800]  launch new wars and take over resources oh this blowback lets the federal
[03:44.800 --> 03:48.600]  government take our liberties and freedoms and get away with crimes that
[03:48.600 --> 03:53.360]  are unspeakable no they've engineered it and we have the history of our
[03:53.360 --> 03:58.280]  government staging terror attacks as a pretext for control and we have the
[03:58.280 --> 04:03.080]  history of every other major government and Empire doing it and I know I talk a
[04:03.080 --> 04:10.960]  lot about it and that's because we've got Mr. Napolitano Mr. Janet Napolitano
[04:10.960 --> 04:18.000]  almost said Mr. Manow up there running around saying you got to reauthorize
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.360]  the Patriot Act a lock he's gonna blow everything up it's the biggest threat
[04:21.360 --> 04:25.960]  since 9-11 oh my gosh and then there's no discussion no investigation about him
[04:25.960 --> 04:29.560]  hanging out secretly at the Pentagon and all the other connections of him
[04:29.560 --> 04:34.200]  working for the Pentagon or the fake bin Laden videos they upload of the fake
[04:34.200 --> 04:38.800]  Adam Gadan videos they upload and that guy in Italy ran some of the former
[04:38.800 --> 04:43.840]  head of the ADL it's just it's all ridiculously staged if you're paying

[07:59.360 --> 08:07.880]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:07.880 --> 08:18.640]  we are live it is Friday the 11th day of February 2011 and I was already
[08:18.640 --> 08:23.880]  planning to take off Monday because today's my birthday and one of my
[08:23.880 --> 08:30.320]  daughter's birthdays he is coming up in a few days but I'm gonna leave you at
[08:30.320 --> 08:36.200]  the halfway point today because I have a story I'm working on that is going to
[08:36.200 --> 08:43.920]  take my full attention but Watson is going to be filling in from Britannia
[08:43.920 --> 08:50.040]  from Albion from England for the last hour and a half of the broadcast and Joe
[08:50.040 --> 08:55.680]  see how hueson will be joining us of Liberty Guard the federal government
[08:55.680 --> 09:02.040]  did not respond at least last time we talked to them in a timely way as they
[09:02.040 --> 09:06.280]  were supposed to by law to the Freedom of Information Act order they're always
[09:06.280 --> 09:12.560]  called requests but it's really a law dealing with the TSA stand down the TSA
[09:12.560 --> 09:20.040]  stand down the day before the day of and for two days after on Thanksgiving of
[09:20.040 --> 09:23.920]  the TSA they just turned off the scanners nationwide scores of newspapers
[09:23.920 --> 09:28.160]  confirmed that we were first reporting it here so was the drudge report that
[09:28.160 --> 09:31.040]  they were turned off I actually had two crew members traveling the day before
[09:31.040 --> 09:37.040]  Thanksgiving flying back to Austin from Denver they were out west doing the
[09:37.040 --> 09:40.880]  interview with Russell means that folks have now had a chance to see and there
[09:40.880 --> 09:45.880]  was no scanners on and no pat downs going on it was just like ten years ago
[09:45.880 --> 09:53.040]  walk through the metal detector and wallop see how you accept the metal
[09:53.040 --> 09:56.480]  detector and then it's take your shoes off and then it's going to microwave oven
[09:56.480 --> 10:00.320]  and then let us stick our hands down your pants and and the government's come
[10:00.320 --> 10:04.880]  out and said they do plan to make everyone go through a body scan and a
[10:04.880 --> 10:10.480]  grope down when they're done the people like well you don't all have to do it
[10:10.480 --> 10:15.880]  yeah they always incrementally put it in that's a psychological warfare tactic
[10:15.880 --> 10:20.040]  that's being used but the word a few weeks ago was they were preparing a
[10:20.040 --> 10:26.640]  lawsuit with Bob Barr's organization Liberty Guard and see using is the head
[10:26.640 --> 10:31.400]  of that group bars the founder and so we're going to get some breaking news
[10:31.400 --> 10:38.160]  today I'm told on the fight against the unconstitutional extreme excesses of the
[10:38.160 --> 10:43.920]  TSA at 1230 an hour and a half from now roughly when Joe see you's and joins us
[10:43.920 --> 10:49.280]  and we always have our weekly visit with Bob Chapman and then on Monday you're
[10:49.280 --> 10:56.240]  going to have Paul Watson and of course also Aaron Dykes co-hosting for part of
[10:56.240 --> 11:00.440]  the broadcast and we've got a special interview that we're gonna rear in the
[11:00.440 --> 11:05.800]  last hour as well I'm actually gonna be here in town but I am taking that day
[11:05.800 --> 11:11.360]  off I'm not going to take the next few days off I will be working but I will
[11:11.360 --> 11:16.280]  try to be there for my daughter's birthday on Monday take off some time and
[11:16.280 --> 11:21.640]  do that and for taking off the time I really can't apologize obviously
[11:21.640 --> 11:28.920]  housing Mubarak has stepped down as president and the army has taken over
[11:28.920 --> 11:40.760]  and mr. Panetta yesterday came out and in the morning in a congressional hearing
[11:40.760 --> 11:46.040]  the head of the CIA said that he was gonna step down yesterday and then he
[11:46.040 --> 11:50.720]  gave a speech last night and didn't step down but I guess the army today gave him
[11:50.720 --> 11:56.200]  an offer he couldn't refuse I guess either your signature or your brains
[11:56.200 --> 12:03.680]  will be on it via the godfather and he has stepped down so the well-serving
[12:03.680 --> 12:13.640]  dupe tyrant of 31 years is now saying he's gonna step down or has stepped down
[12:13.640 --> 12:18.520]  the interesting thing about this is you notice that Nicholas Sarkozy of France
[12:18.520 --> 12:27.880]  also the prime minister of England have come out now and both said the same
[12:27.880 --> 12:31.320]  thing and several other leaders of European countries have said the same
[12:31.320 --> 12:37.880]  thing multiculturalism has failed and that basically Muslims are incompatible
[12:37.880 --> 12:47.040]  with our Western society now I think that that is an extreme over
[12:47.040 --> 12:53.600]  simplification isn't it yes it's true that Europe was invaded repeatedly in
[12:53.600 --> 13:00.080]  large portions of even Western Europe including Spain were taken by the
[13:00.080 --> 13:06.800]  Muslims it is true that Turkey was once the Byzantine Empire and really the
[13:06.800 --> 13:15.480]  center of New Rome Constantinople which of course is now under another name I
[13:15.480 --> 13:21.600]  certainly understand that many of the Muslims and Arabs do have a religious
[13:21.600 --> 13:32.240]  pride and a desire to spread the rebirth of the Ottoman Empire but why if that is
[13:32.240 --> 13:39.240]  the case would the West accelerate the last 30 years the unfettered immigration
[13:39.240 --> 13:47.600]  of Muslims into the Western world they have programs where the federal
[13:47.600 --> 13:53.400]  government flips over backwards to bring as many Somalis who were obviously
[13:53.400 --> 14:00.960]  North African Muslims predominantly to places like Minneapolis St. Paul now I
[14:00.960 --> 14:05.880]  think they're good people that deserve a right to live and work hard but I'm
[14:05.880 --> 14:10.880]  simply looking at the historical facts here why do they take Muslims from some
[14:10.880 --> 14:14.880]  of the most radical countries and seed them all over the nation and then have
[14:14.880 --> 14:20.360]  the Ford Foundation go in with liberation theology in all of the major
[14:20.360 --> 14:27.880]  universities and teach them that America is bad and you need to take over and
[14:27.880 --> 14:34.000]  it's your right to do it while simultaneously funding other university
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.400]  programs saying Muslims are pure evil and the devil and we're going to have a
[14:38.400 --> 14:44.080]  clash of civilizations with them I have no doubt that we couldn't get along with
[14:44.080 --> 14:50.560]  the Muslims and that they are on average very moral cultured people who invented
[14:50.560 --> 14:56.520]  much of the sciences we have today unfortunately in the last really 90
[14:56.520 --> 15:01.600]  years the British then the Germans and since World War two the US on record has
[15:01.600 --> 15:05.440]  done everything they can to radicalize Muslims and overthrow mainline
[15:05.440 --> 15:11.200]  competitive governments and put in radicals so that those countries basically
[15:11.200 --> 15:17.040]  stay in the Stone Age and that's why you see the Prime Minister of England the
[15:17.040 --> 15:21.120]  president of France coming out and saying multiculturalism has failed Muslims
[15:21.120 --> 15:24.320]  are dangerous they're not compatible because they're getting ready to
[15:24.320 --> 15:28.000]  destabilize the entire Middle East as Webster Tarpley many others broke down
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.680]  here years ago as 13 14 years ago Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote the Grand
[15:32.680 --> 15:40.320]  Chess Board another book two years ago and they are igniting radical Islam they
[15:40.320 --> 15:44.500]  have put dictators in to make radical Islam look legitimate when it
[15:44.500 --> 15:48.360]  overthrows these countries so the West can have a full-scale war with these
[15:48.360 --> 15:56.440]  people and they're gonna they're going to initiate low intensity terror attacks
[15:56.440 --> 15:59.840]  all over the West with patsies and also provocateur but also purely
[15:59.840 --> 16:04.200]  manufactured to then use the Muslim threat to attack their the globalist
[16:04.200 --> 16:09.640]  real enemy private property libertarian type conservatives liberals it doesn't
[16:09.640 --> 16:14.080]  matter intellectuals property owners gun owners so that's the bait and switch
[16:14.080 --> 16:17.520]  it's a clash of civilizations and the globalist want to mop up the Muslims
[16:17.520 --> 16:21.560]  that are a threat to them because they won't accept them the globalist system
[16:21.560 --> 16:26.360]  of control the abortion the infanticide the one-shot policy and it'll help them
[16:26.360 --> 16:33.880]  wipe out their other real big enemy mainline classical puritanical Protestant
[16:33.880 --> 16:39.320]  type ethic of the West there you have it okay let's go to Webster Griffin
[16:39.320 --> 16:43.120]  Tarpley he'll be with us for 20 minutes or so appreciate him coming on on short
[16:43.120 --> 16:50.200]  notice they say Mubarak has stepped down and give us your breakdown on this well
[16:50.200 --> 16:53.880]  it appears that he has stepped down that's the announcement from Vice
[16:53.880 --> 16:58.640]  President Suleyman on the official Egyptian television so until we learn
[16:58.640 --> 17:04.080]  something else let's assume that's true although we've been burned a few times I
[17:04.080 --> 17:08.960]  think what you've got to ask yourself is what kinds of threats were delivered
[17:08.960 --> 17:16.040]  overnight by the US government to Egypt I can imagine yesterday evening Obama
[17:16.040 --> 17:21.800]  chewing the carpet in the White House in an absolute fit of rage threatening to
[17:21.800 --> 17:26.920]  fire Panetta for his bungling incompetence and stupidity basically wanting
[17:26.920 --> 17:32.040]  to fire the director of national intelligence this is all I what I
[17:32.040 --> 17:36.120]  imagine going on but chewing the carpet in rage and then of course you could see
[17:36.120 --> 17:40.360]  this reflected on television somebody like David Gergen always connected to
[17:40.360 --> 17:44.640]  the various White Houses saying this cannot be allowed to stand because if
[17:44.640 --> 17:49.920]  both if Mubarak can stand up to the US then you've got a partial collapse at
[17:49.920 --> 17:54.560]  least of US imperialism in the area that they have for some reason defined as the
[17:54.560 --> 17:57.760]  most important in the world and from three weeks ago you have been proven
[17:57.760 --> 18:01.280]  correct it's now admitted and the White House and they all admit that they
[18:01.280 --> 18:05.480]  basically funded the opposition groups and triggered this and do you still
[18:05.480 --> 18:09.200]  follow the same line of reasoning that this is the first domino in a
[18:09.200 --> 18:14.160]  destabilization program that's basically what Brzezinski and Herr Kissinger have
[18:14.160 --> 18:18.720]  said now that is what they hope it is now this has now been another object
[18:18.720 --> 18:22.640]  lesson for those who have foolishly forgotten about the fate of the Shah
[18:22.640 --> 18:27.640]  and Marcos and so many others they've now seen this again so I think a lot of
[18:27.640 --> 18:31.760]  people are going to be mobilized if you listen to the soft power group and this
[18:31.760 --> 18:36.920]  is not the neocut now this is the Joseph Mai international crisis group soft
[18:36.920 --> 18:42.000]  power subversive destabilization group you can see this is involved
[18:42.000 --> 18:49.560]  Soros is involved right that's the international so Glenn Beck's right Glenn Beck's right oh of course well I don't know Glenn Beck this is
[18:49.560 --> 18:52.560]  but this is no but I mean Glenn Beck I mean he started saying that a week after
[18:52.560 --> 18:55.920]  you started saying it but and I'm glad he's getting you know the truth from
[18:55.920 --> 19:00.160]  the show but the evidence is all right there anyway the the international
[19:00.160 --> 19:04.880]  crisis group is money from Soros and the in the ideological direction from
[19:04.880 --> 19:10.360]  from Brzezinski they're all saying now on to Syria on to Saudi Arabia on to Iran
[19:10.360 --> 19:16.520]  on to China on to Russia why not there's there's no limit to the attempts of
[19:16.520 --> 19:21.160]  these people this is now going to be Obama's election campaign is to say I'm
[19:21.160 --> 19:25.840]  better than Bush because Bush bogged you down in this tremendously expensive
[19:25.840 --> 19:30.960]  catastrophic war but I can overthrow countries simply using soft power
[19:30.960 --> 19:35.480]  you really are incredible you really are incredible because you you did say
[19:35.480 --> 19:40.880]  here three years ago during the middle of the Obama campaign that he was going
[19:40.880 --> 19:43.960]  to use kamikaze puppets and that they were going to overthrow countries
[19:43.960 --> 19:48.760]  their popular color revolution rebellions George Soros funded and that is
[19:48.760 --> 19:53.840]  exactly what they've been doing so let's continue when we come back and break
[19:53.840 --> 19:57.800]  that down now you did miscalculate a bit you thought Mubarak might be able to
[19:57.800 --> 20:03.840]  hold on normal blood pressure naturally how would that make you feel I'm Don

[24:04.240 --> 24:11.320]  now to be clear the reason I bring Glenn back up is that we get a good
[24:11.320 --> 24:15.480]  indication of where the US media is starting about two weeks ago about a
[24:15.480 --> 24:21.840]  week after Tarpley laid out the facts here and others did. Beck came out and
[24:21.840 --> 24:24.840]  said why are they trying to put the Muslim Brotherhood in you know they're
[24:24.840 --> 24:28.040]  radical Muslims that want to have war with Israel well not really their
[24:28.040 --> 24:31.880]  British intelligence run and that's on record so he only goes so far but the
[24:31.880 --> 24:35.560]  media attacked him saying how dare he support a dictator when he wasn't and
[24:35.560 --> 24:39.640]  some of the media attacked yours truly saying look even Jones you know is
[24:39.640 --> 24:43.480]  saying don't kick me barricade I didn't say that I said the globalist triggered
[24:43.480 --> 24:47.640]  this they admit they triggered it George Soros is in their funding it these are
[24:47.640 --> 24:52.440]  not nice people they want to now overthrow all these puppet dictatorships
[24:52.440 --> 24:56.240]  they even put out rumors yesterday that the king of Saudi Arabia had died looks
[24:56.240 --> 24:59.840]  like was that true I think it turned out that it wasn't I mean there's all these
[24:59.840 --> 25:03.720]  destabilization programs going on the Muslim Brotherhood saying overthrow
[25:03.720 --> 25:09.600]  Jordan overthrow Yemen overthrow Saudi Arabia China's trying to lock down
[25:09.600 --> 25:14.880]  all this news this is the global strategy what are they trying to get out of
[25:14.880 --> 25:18.160]  this Webster well let's look at what has now happened in Egypt you now have a
[25:18.160 --> 25:22.800]  military junta this is now a military government part of the exit deal whatever
[25:22.800 --> 25:27.120]  threats were made to him in Mubarak you know the imprisonment of his son or who
[25:27.120 --> 25:32.760]  knows what he is now given power not according to the Constitution but to the
[25:32.760 --> 25:36.880]  military council in other words Mubarak's last deed was to shred the
[25:36.880 --> 25:41.400]  Constitution and delegate power which I don't know how he can do it because he
[25:41.400 --> 25:45.800]  doesn't have such a power at least in theory it's not a military council so
[25:45.800 --> 25:52.200]  it's a military junta that is now running the country and this is now it's a
[25:52.200 --> 25:56.680]  CIA military coup these crowds that you see on television I assure you have
[25:56.680 --> 26:00.800]  absolutely nothing to do with what happened behind the scenes this was pure
[26:00.800 --> 26:05.920]  great power threats exercised by the US against Egypt the difference between
[26:05.920 --> 26:10.280]  Iran and Egypt is that Iran is basically an enemy state from the US point of
[26:10.280 --> 26:13.760]  view they don't have that leverage whereas with Egypt they have all kinds of
[26:13.760 --> 26:17.480]  leverage starting with the with the food situation now the purpose of this
[26:17.480 --> 26:21.160]  military junta military dictatorship because that's what you happen it's an
[26:21.160 --> 26:27.600]  oligarchy is to I believe roll back this refusal by Mubarak to enter into the US
[26:27.600 --> 26:34.760]  nuclear umbrella this proposal from the summer of 2009 where Obama came forward
[26:34.760 --> 26:39.720]  and said we want to have Israel Egypt Saudi Arabia the Gulf States and so forth
[26:39.720 --> 26:45.440]  all under US nuclear protection and this amounts to assembling a war alliance a
[26:45.440 --> 26:50.960]  military front of Sunni Arab states with the Israelis in the US sticking into it
[26:50.960 --> 26:56.400]  and play this all against Iran think think of them think of the Brzezinski
[26:56.400 --> 27:00.320]  parallels under Carter this is just the first step but we've just seen this is
[27:00.320 --> 27:03.600]  now the creation of this military government where is this military
[27:03.600 --> 27:07.800]  government going to go if it can't solve internal problems which I doubt it can
[27:07.800 --> 27:12.320]  if it stays under the IMF and the World Bank then you're going to need some
[27:12.320 --> 27:16.640]  glory well where are you going to get glory well maybe start picking fights
[27:16.640 --> 27:22.080]  with Iran over some issue I just think about how Brzezinski went from the Iran
[27:22.080 --> 27:29.440]  overthrow in 1978-79 to very quickly the destabilization of Afghanistan and then
[27:29.440 --> 27:34.800]  getting the Soviets into that it ends in war war is now closer that is what
[27:34.800 --> 27:39.640]  these people have to understand on the NPR this morning they're saying all these
[27:39.640 --> 27:44.520]  wonderful demonstrators they should get the Nobel Peace Prize well no they
[27:44.520 --> 27:49.240]  should get the the war prize because they have now brought a general war with
[27:49.240 --> 27:55.040]  Iran closer the Iranians have not publicly said that this is the case the
[27:55.040 --> 27:59.840]  Iranians I'm afraid have been somewhat opportunistic and piling on this
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.160]  greeting Tunisia and Egypt as a as an Islamic revolution they're not these are
[28:04.160 --> 28:08.400]  CIA they don't see the trap they don't see the trap they're being led into what
[28:08.400 --> 28:12.880]  about suddenly all these presidents and prime ministers England France saying
[28:12.880 --> 28:18.040]  Muslims are bad and multiculturalism failed I mean we really see the war
[28:18.040 --> 28:24.200]  propaganda gearing up for this World War 3 scenario it's quite possible
[28:24.200 --> 28:30.000]  the the the other thing I would stress is suppose this government is in good
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.600]  faith right let's let's give them the benefit of the doubt which I really
[28:32.600 --> 28:36.320]  don't but what could they do the first thing they ought to do is raise the
[28:36.320 --> 28:41.760]  minimum wage Mubarak had just raised the the wages of the of the public
[28:41.760 --> 28:45.480]  employees but that came too late to make any difference they should lower the
[28:45.480 --> 28:49.480]  price of bread cooking oil and fuel the big thing that this government ought to
[28:49.480 --> 28:52.720]  do if they're if they're really patriotic take advantage of the
[28:52.720 --> 28:57.600]  international goodwill for Egypt right now which is existing created by the
[28:57.600 --> 29:03.080]  media declare a debt moratorium freeze your debt stop paying stop paying the
[29:03.080 --> 29:07.360]  international monetary fund stop paying the European Bank stop paying the city
[29:07.360 --> 29:11.560]  of London stop paying Wall Street and so we have to do this because Mubarak has
[29:11.560 --> 29:17.040]  looted our country use that as a as a story and get get Egypt out from under
[29:17.040 --> 29:21.760]  this crushing debt burden and and the other as pictures that have been that
[29:21.760 --> 29:24.400]  have been put on them and of course then you could begin to think about
[29:24.400 --> 29:31.120]  expanding the Suez Canal developing the Nile this he bring Camel part of Mubarak
[29:31.120 --> 29:35.200]  circle the guy who tried to move forward to try to keep him in power as a whole
[29:35.200 --> 29:40.400]  plan in his website how you can develop the huge desert areas of Egypt by
[29:40.400 --> 29:45.640]  pumping out the water from the Nile I'd stay there I want to I want to look at
[29:45.640 --> 29:50.080]  a larger geopolitical pullback and what you see the globalist doing in the
[29:50.080 --> 29:56.720]  future we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[33:28.000 --> 33:31.880]  want chaos in the region is a pretext to continue to have forces there and to
[33:31.880 --> 33:38.120]  expand that presence and this is the stated policies of the Soros crew I was
[33:38.120 --> 33:43.240]  the big new Brzezinski of Henry Kissinger and Webster I understand you
[33:43.240 --> 33:47.720]  want to see Egypt thrive you you want to see development but I don't see the
[33:47.720 --> 33:54.880]  globalist allowing that we know the IMF World Bank policy is to use debt and
[33:54.880 --> 33:59.080]  high interest rates to keep countries in squalor so that they can never
[33:59.080 --> 34:05.920]  properly develop so they're basically under the control of this soft economic
[34:05.920 --> 34:11.360]  imperium so so shifting years away from that who are the different factions
[34:11.360 --> 34:15.560]  there who is the Muslim Brotherhood give us a brief tutorial on the admitted
[34:15.560 --> 34:22.240]  history of radical Islam being funded financed and protected to radicalize the
[34:22.240 --> 34:27.240]  Muslim world as a pretext to produce a clash of civilizations and where do you
[34:27.240 --> 34:32.300]  see this going not where you want to see it go but where do you see this new
[34:32.300 --> 34:37.080]  world order operation going well in Egypt it's very clear that the Muslim
[34:37.080 --> 34:43.160]  Brotherhood was created by the British in the late 1920s as an antidote to the
[34:43.160 --> 34:47.480]  at the time that the country was a British colony it was an attempted
[34:47.480 --> 34:52.760]  antidote by the British to the waft party WA FD which had a strong
[34:52.760 --> 34:58.920]  nationalist and anti-british component to it was a parliamentary party so the
[34:58.920 --> 35:03.720]  British created the Muslim Brotherhood as a counterweight and the Muslim
[35:03.720 --> 35:07.640]  Brotherhood was generally not agitating against the British colonialism but
[35:07.640 --> 35:12.840]  rather agitating against the local governments on these themes of what we
[35:12.840 --> 35:19.020]  could call social social issues now that the during the 60s 50s and 60s into the
[35:19.020 --> 35:25.080]  70s the Muslim Brotherhood attempted to to sabotage the modernization of Egypt
[35:25.080 --> 35:29.560]  and especially because they were opposed to Nasser now Nasser of course had many
[35:29.560 --> 35:33.280]  many problems but he had tremendous merits and the biggest merit is that
[35:33.280 --> 35:38.280]  huge aswan high dam which is the the centerpiece of the economic development
[35:38.280 --> 35:42.800]  of the whole country in the past half century I would say that the Muslim
[35:42.800 --> 35:48.640]  Brotherhood has factions in it that have mellowed during the 80s 90s and into
[35:48.640 --> 35:53.600]  the current decade but the idea of a government where the Muslim Brotherhood
[35:53.600 --> 35:58.520]  would have total power I think would be a would be a very bad thing but they are
[35:58.520 --> 36:02.880]  calling let me just stop you they are calling now let's go on to Egypt I mean
[36:02.880 --> 36:07.400]  from Egypt to Saudi Arabia to Jordan to Yemen they are calling for this and
[36:07.400 --> 36:13.840]  strangely we see Iran saying they like it we see the globalist funding and
[36:13.840 --> 36:17.920]  obviously to try to get the radicals into power or to use them to further
[36:17.920 --> 36:21.720]  destabilize now then the globalist could come in and fill that vacuum with
[36:21.720 --> 36:25.880]  other coalition weak puppet governments that they can control but I want to play
[36:25.880 --> 36:31.320]  this brief clip from Henry Kissinger a few weeks ago saying that this mubarak
[36:31.320 --> 36:37.160]  situation is only the first scene in the first act of a larger play here it is
[36:37.160 --> 36:43.400]  there's no possibility that they won't in a democratic process the question is
[36:43.400 --> 36:48.240]  whether other parties can emerge that balance them
[36:48.360 --> 36:53.880]  Dr. Kissinger before I leave you what advice would you give secretary Clinton
[36:53.880 --> 36:59.440]  right now as she's dealing with this well I would talk it's little publicly as
[36:59.440 --> 37:05.520]  possible because we don't really know what it's going on we are generally I
[37:05.520 --> 37:10.400]  think the conduct of our government has been generally in the right direction
[37:10.400 --> 37:20.880]  for the same goals we should not have any illusions however we are going to go
[37:20.880 --> 37:27.440]  through a period of great uncertainty and over a lot of maneuvering once the
[37:27.440 --> 37:33.480]  leaders of right now everybody's focused on the removal of mubarak that is only
[37:33.480 --> 37:40.080]  the first scene of the first act of a drama that has to be played out all
[37:40.080 --> 37:45.080]  right and this act you see so Webster when I'm saying here is the the global
[37:45.080 --> 37:50.880]  technocrats the Anglo-American establishment Britain the US Israel that
[37:50.880 --> 37:54.000]  they wouldn't be going with this destabilization program if they weren't
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.280]  confident I'm asking you what is their strategy and we know the general
[37:58.280 --> 38:02.200]  strategy but what do you see them doing next well remember they talk big and they
[38:02.200 --> 38:05.080]  always promise more than they can deliver and maybe it's not that they're
[38:05.080 --> 38:08.200]  confident maybe it's that they're desperate and this is a flight forward
[38:08.200 --> 38:13.240]  on other issues mainly mainly the dollar right now they have a military
[38:13.240 --> 38:18.240]  junta these are the general these are mainly generals chosen by mubarak let's
[38:18.240 --> 38:23.120]  look at the tradition in Egypt it's the tradition of the colonels in in the
[38:23.120 --> 38:27.920]  1950s you had the overthrow of King Farouk who had been under back back by
[38:27.920 --> 38:32.120]  the British and then you had a kind of a transitional situation which may be
[38:32.120 --> 38:36.520]  where we are now and then the coup d'etat of the colonels around NASA which gave
[38:36.520 --> 38:39.960]  you about the best government in the Middle East that you had during this
[38:39.960 --> 38:44.920]  entire period of several decades so let's look maybe somewhere in the
[38:44.920 --> 38:49.280]  Egyptian army there are some radicalized colonels who see the humiliation of their
[38:49.280 --> 38:53.920]  country a coup d'etat proclaimed by the head of the CIA from Washington they
[38:53.920 --> 39:00.200]  must be mortified beyond belief so maybe there's a counter force emerging there I
[39:00.200 --> 39:03.880]  think that's a real worry for the Anglo-American that you might have some
[39:03.880 --> 39:09.840]  modernizing pro-development non non mubarak non dictatorial but the
[39:09.840 --> 39:14.840]  authoritarian types in the in the Egyptian military perfectly possible
[39:14.840 --> 39:20.360]  other than that is the soft power group the people who believe in subversion not
[39:20.360 --> 39:25.280]  bombing but using using these methods of the of the people power coup the color
[39:25.280 --> 39:30.080]  revolution the the postmodern coup they would undoubtedly set their sights on
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.680]  Syria what are the chances in Syria well on the one side
[39:33.680 --> 39:38.840]  Syria is a very highly developed police state maybe more so than Egypt I think a
[39:38.840 --> 39:44.600]  lot more so than Egypt on the other hand it has a ethnic minority ruler the Assad
[39:44.600 --> 39:50.200]  family represent this very small out of white ethnic minority which is
[39:50.200 --> 39:54.400]  ethnically different from the vast majority of the Syrian population so
[39:54.400 --> 39:58.280]  they're a target they'll undoubtedly target Jordan now there it's even it's
[39:58.280 --> 40:02.920]  significantly harder because of the way in which the monarchy is rooted in the
[40:02.920 --> 40:08.480]  clan and even tribal structure of the country so far there's no movement
[40:08.480 --> 40:14.640]  against the Hashemite dynasty represented by the current king and then we get to
[40:14.640 --> 40:20.400]  Saudi Arabia let's see what might happen here we had this idea that Prince
[40:20.400 --> 40:25.360]  Bondar about 18 months ago was attempting to play the Russian card and he was
[40:25.360 --> 40:29.240]  there was a crackdown on him and the last I heard of him he was put under house
[40:29.240 --> 40:34.960]  arrest if you can imagine King Abdullah and maybe more active people in the
[40:34.960 --> 40:38.600]  royal family they look at the fate of Mubarak what are they going to do they're
[40:38.600 --> 40:44.240]  going to say call Beijing call Moscow call people in let's play these other
[40:44.240 --> 40:54.120]  cards the US may be therefore impaled to try a coup in Saudi Arabia to prevent
[40:54.120 --> 40:59.400]  Saudi Arabia from developing fallback options that would allow them to escape
[40:59.400 --> 41:05.400]  from this situation of one-way dependency on the US then you can look
[41:05.400 --> 41:10.160]  at some other countries Algeria you've got butte Flika there he's been there
[41:10.160 --> 41:14.800]  for quite a while they'd like to target him it's a very big oil producer and of
[41:14.800 --> 41:19.640]  course the net idea all of these countries use them against Russia use
[41:19.640 --> 41:24.600]  them against China use them against Iran that's the bottom line and whereas
[41:24.600 --> 41:29.120]  Mubarak said I'm not interested in that that doesn't help me get lost scram
[41:29.120 --> 41:32.880]  beat it now you're going to have governments who will say oh yes of
[41:32.880 --> 41:39.120]  course yes of course mr. Obama will be so happy to carry out your anti-Chinese
[41:39.120 --> 41:44.240]  anti-Iranian anti-Russian policies number three that's what has changed if
[41:44.240 --> 41:49.560]  Obama wants to go and do something for Egypt in his speech at 130 instead of
[41:49.560 --> 41:54.560]  more of this hot air blasé rhetoric that he usually comes up with announced
[41:54.560 --> 41:59.240]  an immediate large-scale food aid shipment let's get several million tons
[41:59.240 --> 42:04.200]  of grain to Egypt right now and avoid starvation because that would put a
[42:04.200 --> 42:10.480]  sav on a lot of the instability but they probably want the instability to
[42:10.480 --> 42:15.240]  continue so they can jockey around in there and try to get who they want in
[42:15.240 --> 42:20.200]  exactly I think the US card is now simply shoot the works for chaos
[42:20.200 --> 42:25.320]  destabilization and and mob rule and that and that's what we've seen but
[42:25.320 --> 42:30.080]  again remember the mob you see in the street is simply an illusion right it's
[42:30.080 --> 42:35.080]  a smoke screen it's a prop these are the walk-on parts in this drama the real
[42:35.080 --> 42:39.120]  stuff goes on behind the scenes and what kinds of threats were delivered to
[42:39.120 --> 42:46.240]  Obama to Mubarak to Suleiman to the to this Tantawi to to Enan the head of the
[42:46.240 --> 42:50.240]  of the Egyptian military that I think will will be the interesting thing
[42:50.240 --> 42:53.920]  well let me just interject going back three weeks ago the media kept saying
[42:53.920 --> 42:59.160]  he will step down today you know creating a self-fulfilling prophecy to
[42:59.160 --> 43:04.080]  really bolster the destabilization in the protest and they just kept announcing
[43:04.080 --> 43:08.280]  it and then when they shot the works yesterday and Panetta said oh he'll
[43:08.280 --> 43:11.880]  step down today and then Mubarak came out and gave a speech and didn't step
[43:11.880 --> 43:17.640]  down you had called that yesterday on air hours before it happened you had
[43:17.640 --> 43:22.280]  said that that that that he's trying to hold on right now and that they've
[43:22.280 --> 43:28.000]  basically given him the order and already issued the threats and that he
[43:28.000 --> 43:31.920]  still may not step down but then when he did that shows that there was
[43:31.920 --> 43:36.040]  incredible pressure being put on them and we've seen Israel in the last five
[43:36.040 --> 43:41.200]  days threatening to basically invade or or to attack Egypt saying we're now on a
[43:41.200 --> 43:46.120]  war footing and but then on but publicly Israel's been claiming they have
[43:46.120 --> 43:53.200]  support for Mubarak so again probably a double policy it's fairly common but the
[43:53.200 --> 43:57.960]  thing that Mubarak has done I think in departing whatever else he's done is by
[43:57.960 --> 44:04.160]  staying and fighting for this two-week period Mubarak has established in front
[44:04.160 --> 44:10.280]  of the eyes of the world this is a CIA coup this is not this gaggle of nihilists
[44:10.280 --> 44:15.320]  in the square this has nothing to do with these crowds this was a top-down
[44:15.320 --> 44:21.880]  CIA operation with heavy-duty threats God knows well they sent alberian who
[44:21.880 --> 44:25.560]  hadn't been there in a long time the week before and he started giving
[44:25.560 --> 44:30.160]  basically overthrow speeches and then that it came out in the headlines U.S.
[44:30.160 --> 44:37.640]  behind protesters and then now the West is saying yes he will step down today I
[44:37.640 --> 44:41.560]  mean they basically admit that they did this and you've got Google that's a
[44:41.560 --> 44:47.000]  known in SA CIA admitted creation now you know don't be evil what a joke and
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.560]  then they've got one of their their minions in there you know to help
[44:51.560 --> 44:56.240]  manipulate the technotronic technocracy I mean this is go over that
[44:56.240 --> 45:01.560]  constellation of pure evidence briefly that that this was a western coup but we
[45:01.560 --> 45:07.760]  have now the television celebrating this guy Kohn him this character you see not
[45:07.760 --> 45:12.680]  charismatic but a Google executive they're celebrating Kohn him as the
[45:12.680 --> 45:17.560]  founder of the revolution so again if it was Robespierre in France and Lenin in
[45:17.560 --> 45:21.840]  Russia and maybe Mao in China now we have Kohn him this is impossible this
[45:21.840 --> 45:27.120]  guy is a little mouse this is a this is a little a little nothing we also have
[45:27.120 --> 45:32.520]  this this interesting fact that the main group among the young nihilists in the
[45:32.520 --> 45:39.360]  square is this April 6th organization which happens to be a clone of the
[45:39.360 --> 45:46.240]  original color revolution group which is the art poor group in Serbia left over
[45:46.240 --> 45:51.200]  from 1999 2000 when they went the U.S. and George Soros isn't hiding that I
[45:51.200 --> 45:54.040]  mean I mean they're not hiding the fact that they're in there manipulating no
[45:54.040 --> 45:58.080]  they they exchanged love notes in public on the internet you can see what's left
[45:58.080 --> 46:02.720]  about poor basically nothing but the the older veterans about poor are sending
[46:02.720 --> 46:08.200]  love notes to the April 6th and vice versa and of course we all have the
[46:08.200 --> 46:13.360]  daily telegraph reports that the entire plan that we've just seen as far as the
[46:13.360 --> 46:18.320]  at the the public square part right the the people power aspect all of this was
[46:18.320 --> 46:24.920]  worked out in the United States in late 2008 just as Obama was taking
[46:24.920 --> 46:27.960]  power here with a similar operation what you said on air you said they're
[46:27.960 --> 46:32.000]  shifting away from open military invasion and the conquering and they're
[46:32.000 --> 46:37.200]  shifting to the Brzezinski model of destabilize have revolutions overthrow
[46:37.200 --> 46:40.760]  and then out of the chaos put your people in and then use that country as a
[46:40.760 --> 46:45.760]  kamikaze against the next and that will be one of Obama's main arguments to the
[46:45.760 --> 46:49.960]  Wall Street people when he comes around for contribution saying look reelect me
[46:49.960 --> 46:54.760]  because I give you everything you want without the expense of a war without the
[46:54.760 --> 46:58.880]  upheaval without the movements the problem with that is that that works fine on
[46:58.880 --> 47:02.760]  your own client state right you can you can stab your own ally in the back
[47:02.760 --> 47:07.600]  that's easier than fighting you're fighting Iran with a color revolution
[47:07.600 --> 47:12.480]  where the Iranians of course fight back the Chinese have fought back in the
[47:12.480 --> 47:16.200]  past right at 10 on men so it's it's much what was the 888 I mean that was
[47:16.200 --> 47:21.920]  admittedly a NATO situation was that a test of Russia I'm sorry which one what
[47:21.920 --> 47:26.120]  was 888 I mean was that a test of Russia why did they do that what they did you
[47:26.120 --> 47:31.480]  the attack on Georgia yes well this this was simply a it was an attempt by a
[47:31.480 --> 47:36.920]  by by the people from this Brzezinski orbit or people who came from the
[47:36.920 --> 47:42.200]  Brzezinski orbit this this madman Sakashvili fascist warmonger there in
[47:42.200 --> 47:47.080]  Georgia went berserk and tried to try to start something and this this this
[47:47.080 --> 47:52.520]  was simply a an attempt I think to get the attention back towards the big
[47:52.520 --> 47:57.240]  strategic issues which are which are things around Russia and China and
[47:57.240 --> 48:02.680]  India so yeah that's just it was it was a kind of a calling card from Brzezinski
[48:02.680 --> 48:07.560]  which shows how reckless these people are because the Russians admittedly rolled
[48:07.560 --> 48:13.160]  mobile nukes in and their Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman went on television and
[48:13.160 --> 48:17.320]  said we're preparing for nuclear war with NATO and then the West backed off
[48:17.320 --> 48:24.280]  which just it just it's insane yeah it is insane and what you always see is the
[48:24.280 --> 48:29.040]  the question of the nation-state or the Empire unfortunately the Empire has won
[48:29.040 --> 48:33.240]  against the nation-state yesterday the nation-state was briefly in the lead
[48:33.240 --> 48:37.080]  whatever else you want to think but today the Empire has at least for the
[48:37.080 --> 48:43.440]  moment triumphed the problem that the CIA has is you take a US asset and put
[48:43.440 --> 48:47.560]  that person into power from the moment that they take power the apparatus of
[48:47.560 --> 48:52.160]  the nation-state begins to capture them and force them to force them to act
[48:52.160 --> 48:55.800]  more and more like a national leader less and less like a foreign agent and
[48:55.800 --> 49:00.360]  that's what happened to Mubarak he had become really a national leader from
[49:00.360 --> 49:03.200]  his own point of view it was the same thing with Saddam also put in by the
[49:03.200 --> 49:07.400]  West the internal form of these dictatorships is simply the the typical
[49:07.400 --> 49:11.480]  form of of a government in an underdeveloped third world segment of
[49:11.480 --> 49:15.600]  the US Empire and that's pretty uniform it doesn't seem to bear what do you
[49:15.600 --> 49:20.280]  think about people like Ray McGovern who thinks this is overall going to be
[49:20.280 --> 49:24.560]  positive and he thinks Elbert he's a good guy because he you know said WMD's
[49:24.560 --> 49:29.200]  weren't in Iraq I'm afraid that once I guess once you've served in the CIA you
[49:29.200 --> 49:35.960]  never quite get over it I think that you can see a kind of a body of opinion
[49:35.960 --> 49:41.200]  that corresponds to the US intelligence community the left liberals who used to
[49:41.200 --> 49:45.960]  oppose Bush and Cheney have now I think completely discredited themselves that
[49:45.960 --> 49:51.360]  they were imperialists all along that they had a they had a beef with Bush
[49:51.360 --> 49:56.480]  Cheney about methods but not about gold they're interested in a US world
[49:56.480 --> 50:00.920]  empire and they said don't don't use military means use our subversive means
[50:00.920 --> 50:06.720]  however even so what has happened in Egypt is a defeat for the US world
[50:06.720 --> 50:12.480]  empire the empire is in some ways has been more weakened by this than by other
[50:12.480 --> 50:17.520]  other possible outcomes simply because it is now so clear that the CIA has done
[50:17.520 --> 50:23.080]  it the whole nature of this project is to tear down the existing empire with
[50:23.080 --> 50:27.840]  the hope of reforming it but that that may not go well certainly Egypt now
[50:27.840 --> 50:32.600]  enters into a period of prolonged chaos and instability and again I would urge
[50:32.600 --> 50:37.080]  Obama send a few a million tons of grain if you have any concern about Egypt
[50:37.080 --> 50:40.480]  because that's what they need more to say we can't do that we're already giving
[50:40.480 --> 50:44.440]  them foreign aid and the bankers want another hundred trillion dollars of our
[50:44.440 --> 50:48.320]  tax money why can't we give you know a billion dollars of grain to them if it
[50:48.320 --> 50:53.040]  stops a chain reaction that leads to Middle East wide war Webster thank you
[50:53.040 --> 50:56.280]  so much for spending spending time with us we'll talk to you again the next few
[50:56.280 --> 51:03.000]  days as this unfolds hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.560]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[51:06.560 --> 51:10.320]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could

[55:06.520 --> 55:11.000]  calm of radio listeners want to go see it but for prison planet TV viewers and
[55:11.000 --> 55:20.080]  slash radio listeners you'll at least hear the audio of that coming up at the
[55:20.080 --> 55:23.280]  start of the next hour you know I decided to get tar play on earlier in the
[55:23.280 --> 55:28.040]  hour I meant to really get into and I'm gonna cover this some the next hour
[55:28.040 --> 55:35.520]  before Watson and then Bob Chapman join us I wanted to get into just the nature
[55:35.520 --> 55:40.120]  of reality and and and how the globalist couldn't be getting away with all the
[55:40.120 --> 55:44.160]  outrageous things they're doing all the open crimes they're committing if
[55:44.160 --> 55:50.000]  people had any historical reference and I'm not talking about my listeners or
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.880]  the billions of people that are awake around the planet to tyranny folks in
[55:54.880 --> 55:58.640]  the third world certainly are and the tens of millions of Americans who were
[55:58.640 --> 56:03.600]  fully awake and I'd say probably 50 to 80 to 100 I don't even know other
[56:03.600 --> 56:07.000]  Americans that are starting to wake up if you look at the polls I mean when
[56:07.000 --> 56:11.520]  Congress has a 9 to 11 percent approval rating year after year now for the last
[56:11.520 --> 56:16.000]  three years that shows you lowest in history that that you know people are
[56:16.000 --> 56:21.240]  starting to wake up to a certain point but all the time I just think about how
[56:21.240 --> 56:25.040]  the government knows sodium fluoride gives you cancer they knew that when
[56:25.040 --> 56:28.800]  they put it in we have a government that's been caught shooting people up
[56:28.800 --> 56:36.360]  with live polio and HIV and hepatitis and sterilants and syphilis and it's in
[56:36.360 --> 56:40.120]  the mainstream news all the time we have a government that's been caught
[56:40.120 --> 56:44.560]  radiating foster children we've got a government that's been caught just I
[56:44.560 --> 56:49.400]  mean if I tried to list all of their insane crimes if you had a neighbor that
[56:49.400 --> 56:52.320]  had done things like that they'd be in prison but but you but even if they
[56:52.320 --> 56:55.520]  weren't you wouldn't associate with them you wouldn't give them the keys to your
[56:55.520 --> 57:02.560]  house when you're out of town to come over and you know water the plants it's
[57:02.560 --> 57:07.600]  just so fundamental that we've just kind of gotten conditioned to just roll over
[57:07.600 --> 57:12.520]  like a prostitute to whatever the pimp does to us he knocks our teeth out
[57:12.520 --> 57:16.400]  that's fine that's what pimps do he puts cigarettes out on us that's what he
[57:16.400 --> 57:22.120]  does he robs us but you know that's what he does well listen I'm not their
[57:22.120 --> 57:28.760]  slave I'm not their property and I I have a right as a fundamentally free
[57:28.760 --> 57:35.040]  sentient being it's universal law to not be their property to not be their
[57:35.040 --> 57:39.400]  slave to not be assaulted by them with propaganda and chemicals and
[57:39.400 --> 57:45.560]  biologicals to assault my psyche to assault my physical body and I'm just
[57:45.560 --> 57:49.200]  here to get people to simply wake up to the globalist crimes and then you can
[57:49.200 --> 57:52.880]  do whatever you want about it there's a lot of solutions as well take the
[57:52.880 --> 57:57.280]  states back educate the people understand what the globalists are doing but
[57:57.280 --> 58:01.160]  the most important thing to understand is and Ron Paul's beat this drum I've
[58:01.160 --> 58:05.120]  beat this drum I hardly ever watched Glenn Beck I didn't watch him the other
[58:05.120 --> 58:10.040]  night and he did say we've got to develop a movement against the globalist
[58:10.040 --> 58:14.080]  against the New World Order against the socialist world they want to build of
[58:14.080 --> 58:17.960]  course his answer is the Republican Party in neocons another arm of it but
[58:17.960 --> 58:21.840]  the fact that they've allowed him to even go that far shows how much success
[58:21.840 --> 58:26.160]  we've had we've got to build the true Liberty movement to not just challenge
[58:26.160 --> 58:31.440]  the George Soros crowd but to also challenge the Republicans the the
[58:31.440 --> 58:35.880]  mainline Republicans who've sworn to suppress the real Tea Party people we
[58:35.880 --> 58:38.960]  saw a bunch of Tea Party Republicans vote against the Patriot Act and we're
[58:38.960 --> 58:41.520]  gaining ground

[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:12.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you on answers well so does he
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:20.720]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.000]  Jones
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:33.720]  we've got a article up at info wars.com by Kurt Nemo Dominic Strauss Kahn and
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:39.000]  others have put out more public statements and reports they've done it for
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  over 30 years but now they're not just putting it out in quiet white papers of
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.760]  themselves that you've got to go dig around and find they're now putting out
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:53.480]  press releases saying we want a new global government and we want the SDR
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:01:04.520]  quote to form the embryonic embryo to set up a world cashless currency so that
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:11.360]  the SDR will form the embryo of a world currency you can go read the actual
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.800]  quotes and Kurt Nemo's article globalist push SDRs as world reserve
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:23.520]  currency but still the media the establishment media that's losing all
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.120]  credibility and almost all their listeners and viewers still makes fun of
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.760]  you if you read Time Magazine promoting world government is the answer to all our
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.840]  problems and say I don't want world government they go you're a nut there's
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:37.720]  no world government being set up if you read it the Financial Times of London
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:42.680]  and they've written multiple editorials by their one of their main editors
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.680]  saying yes there's a world government one of them's titled and now for world
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.000]  government and he says yeah we built it in secret yes it's authoritarian but
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.200]  that's for your own good I mean they don't just admit they've built this
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:59.960]  world government through fraud but that it's authoritarian that means
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:05.600]  tyrannical and for your own good but then they play this mental game with the
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.080]  general dumb down public going yes we want a world government but listen sheep
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:15.120]  if you hear Alex Jones or somebody talk about it they're cooks and all those
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.880]  years while they were building it they tried to keep everybody in the dark and
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.640]  those of us that went and got the documents got the video clips got the
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.040]  research and warned people folks that would actually go to the research and
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.320]  find out we were telling the truth tried to warn folks and did something and
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.160]  and that's why we've got a jump on them because we were willing to be made fun
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.720]  of all these years but now here we are and there's these preconditioned
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:45.240]  yuppies and people that will still make jokes about it I routinely flip around
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.240]  the radio dial driving into work and driving back from the office and I mean
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.240]  I can tune into Dallas I can tune into San Antonio I can tune into Austin and I
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:00.680]  routinely a couple times a week here host making fun of me callers making fun
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:04.240]  of me you know they'll be talking about some new world order story in the news
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:09.120]  that's admitted but then play helicopter noises that's the most popular you know
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:14.000]  helicopter blades and then go yeah that's what Alex Jones says and then
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.360]  they'll throw in yeah Alex Jones thinks aliens are gonna get us but I don't even
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.320]  talk about aliens see they'll it's like a standard thing and it's not like
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:27.560]  they're getting some CIA directive to do it they're just social climbers and they
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:31.440]  go with whatever they think is popular it was popularly believed the earth was
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.200]  flat they'd make fun of you you said it was round if it was popularly believed
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.680]  that the moon was made of Swiss cheese because it looked like Swiss cheese
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:41.920]  people 500 years ago then if you say it's not Swiss cheese they make fun of
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:48.160]  you oh that Alex Jones he says it's not made of Swiss cheese and it it's this
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:54.120]  idea that so many weak-minded people have that a if they just say something is
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.520]  one way that makes it that way because it's that way in their little brain but
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:04.000]  B and more importantly they don't ever research the way the world really works
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.440]  they're not interested in that I mean I'm like a moth to flame I want to know
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.440]  how the world really works I want to know the mysteries of the world I I want
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.120]  to understand things it's very interesting it's also very frightening but
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.600]  also exhilarating I want to understand human nature and I exponentially learn
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:28.160]  more these people just revel in tuning into MSNBC or Fox News or CNN and then
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:32.880]  regurgitating whatever they heard the talking heads say like that makes them
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:40.760]  smart to repeat a bunch of propaganda and pablum and pap and they're
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:44.800]  destroying their own future but they're childlike they're their junior
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:50.560]  highlight it's like a group think of a bunch of sheet going off a cliff we're

[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:10.240]  colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.800]  silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:18.960]  anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:23.320]  the silver lungs generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.440]  colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.920]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:39.400]  key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:43.680]  orally for the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven-minute video
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:49.840]  tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:54.560]  how the silver lung system works as well we are always ready to answer any
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:07:00.920]  questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com this is Alex Jones with
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:04.680]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:08.440]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:12.960]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.520]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:20.960]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.240]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now a new
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:29.000]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.120]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:37.080]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.880]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.600]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.880]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:53.360]  backup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:08:01.760]  Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 Genesis Communications
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:07.480]  Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:17.160]  your mind
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:22.320]  okay I want to play this five-minute audio video of one of the answer to 1984
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:27.960]  1776 contest you can physically go out and protest and videotape the Homeland
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:32.640]  Security takeover the rollout of TSA on the streets of America and videotape it
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:37.600]  and have a submission you can do a fictional video with actors you could do
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:43.280]  an animation you've got a couple more weeks to get your submissions in the
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.920]  V for victory campaign can be incorporated into this but doesn't have
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:51.120]  to be that's a separate program and there you know there's not prize money to
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.480]  do that that's if you believe in activism and to expose the fact that we
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:59.360]  know that a federal takeover is happening in our society by posting V
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:04.000]  posters everywhere with a short message about tyranny it gets the media
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.040]  talking it gets locals talking to force this issue out there into public
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:12.200]  debate just like we've done the last year and a half pushing with different
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:16.640]  contests and things dealing with the TSA and you've done a great job and it's
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.320]  showing people the power of going out with true activism not just protesting
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.800]  in DC and then the media ignores it but in your towns in your cities in your
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.800]  counties that's where the real power is and people really pay attention to
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:34.640]  political fliers being put up outside of the political season you know stuff
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.760]  that isn't left right paradigm and the system wants to keep you in the left
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:41.520]  right paradigm now this submission I'm playing I'm gonna play some other you
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:47.440]  know good ones coming up the next week because it's so well done and it really
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.720]  illustrates everything it's not as powerful with the audio and radio so I'll
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.120]  have to voice over some of it because you know it builds up the atmosphere with
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:59.160]  the fellows sitting in a park if you're a radio listener you can go see the video
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:05.800]  on info wars.com it's called a day in the park he's there drinking a hot drink a
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:10.960]  coffee and he's looking at the American flag waving in the park smiling at it
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.720]  and it's a nice day and then he's looking at a surveillance camera watching him
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.880]  and he just feels like swearing allegiance to the flag and whatever you
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.600]  think about swearing allegiance to the flag the point is it symbolizes our
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:25.480]  Bill of Rights our Constitution and there is an attack on that culture and
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:29.000]  the flag can be used by the globalists for war and things but we're not
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.880]  talking about the American flag they've expropriated we're talking about taking
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:37.800]  it back in the spirit of 1776 and then all of a sudden the Homeland Security
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:42.480]  Patrol pulls up and says sir what were you just now doing and it's basically
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:47.280]  what the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL do it's how they spin states wanting
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:50.800]  their sovereignty back that's how they spend Second Amendment groups it's how
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.520]  they spin radio talk show host how they try to imply everything is violent and
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:00.080]  bad and you got Cass Sunstein saying you know arrest people that disagree with
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.400]  the government he's the White House regulations are so this is something
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.680]  very real they've already in these Homeland Security flyers we've posted
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:11.480]  them on the website you know they tell citizens the Homeland Security flyers
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:16.440]  put out in Oklahoma and other states and Texas say is your neighbor talking
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.800]  about controversial political issues go ahead and call Homeland Security on
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.520]  them so so this is not a stretch and so the car pulls up they get in his face
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:31.360]  and then they pull down the American flag and they run up a UN flag a metal
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.840]  flag that's more like a weathered vein and the guy cries and then he turns and
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:41.160]  looks at the surveillance camera and sees tacked on the side of it somebody
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.600]  else was already awake to what's happening there's a V for victory poster
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.680]  and that's the message this takeover is happening there are other people out
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:52.840]  there that are awake you're not alone buddy what you just saw connect with
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:59.400]  the Patriots go read the flyer find out who they are get together you are
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.840]  occupied like the French by the Nazis that's the message of the V for victory
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.760]  campaign and this is one of the best submissions we've gotten there's a bunch
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.720]  of other ones that are just as good I mean if this is really gonna be tough
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.840]  choosing the winner but I'm not even thinking about who the winner is I have
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:17.400]  an open mind until you have about a week and a half two weeks to get the rest of
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.120]  your video submissions in and there's links up on infowars.com and
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.600]  prismana.com every day and we post new submissions up there to where you can
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:31.080]  email those to us but again it's going out making a video however you want
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.960]  the sky's the limit and then putting it on a major video sharing site like
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:41.120]  YouTube and then sending us that link YouTube is preferable because you have
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.840]  the best potential to go viral there but let's go ahead and play this clip and
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:50.360]  again I'll be voicing over some of it for radio listeners because a lot of it's
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.240]  just him's they're sitting in the park with the birds tweeting here is a day in
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:13:05.800]  the park just sitting there on the bench birds are tweeting singing a little
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:18.920]  cabana and American flag and some trees nice hot coffee taking a lunch break but
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:23.920]  he looks over at the surveillance camera he's thinking how is this America
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:31.000]  lay out the free home of the brave there's a surveillance camera letting
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.840]  him know big brothers watching him let's see how does that go I pledge
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:45.880]  allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:54.440]  for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:14:09.640]  for all police car homeland security I've got face visors on excuse me sir
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:17.000]  good morning homeland security patrol we just happened to notice you stood and
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  said something just now a public statement of some kind may we ask you to
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:29.200]  explain your public statement I was pledging allegiance pledging yes allegiance
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:40.160]  to whom to the flag by flag you mean the American flag oh that I see were you
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:48.000]  sincere in this pledge of your allegiance sir yes of course I was by
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:54.360]  it sincerely pledging this allegiance of yours are you implying that other flags
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:15:00.160]  aren't worthy of allegiance no I'm just sincere in my allegiance to that
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:05.800]  particular flag expresses public hatred for flags of other countries that's not
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:12.160]  what I said aggressive suddenly denies expression of hatred I'm an American I
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:20.480]  love America isolationist rhetoric what publicly abhors diversity with my
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:24.720]  pledging allegiance to the flag of my country on that other thing you mentioned
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:32.080]  someone that you were standing under something like well under God God I see
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:39.600]  and exactly which God would that be referring to which God God God God of
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.880]  our forefather you know religious bigotry is kind of frowned upon around
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:49.440]  here come on guys we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:55.920]  created equal endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that's
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:01.380]  the declaration of independence oh yeah yeah yeah the Constitution
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:10.560]  bagger all that old stuff give me a break look officer what exactly is the problem here are you
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:17.120]  challenging my authority sir he's got his hand on the taser answer the man John
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:21.920]  Wayne no I'm just unclear what's going on here
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:28.500]  an act of interest to deflect focus from public in propriety in propriety
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:37.800]  veins ignorance you're pushing it pal have I done something wrong officer what's
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:43.760]  in the cup coffee where did you procure that I bought it at a coffee shop down
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:50.000]  the block he's high on something unknown substance attempt to conceal I wasn't
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.160]  concealing anything denies concealing unknown substance what I look buddy you
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:00.720]  dug yourself in pretty deep here now I'm specially trained to spot people who
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:05.840]  may be contemplating acts of terrorism I'd think long and hard if I were you
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:14.040]  about saying another word I thought so if we didn't have more pressing matter
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:28.200]  man let's do this okay it's in the trunk I'll get it only take a minute they take
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:33.040]  down the American flag and run up a metal UN flag like a metal shingle or
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:48.360]  weather vane officer why did you take down that flag and replace it with that
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:54.040]  flags better it's metal so it won't run what do you want to do with this thing
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:18:04.200]  throw the trunk we'll need something to wash the car with he looks at the
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:07.560]  surveillance camera down the bottom and there's a V for victory sign tacked on
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:14.120]  it now he understands he's occupied what's so incredible about this little
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.400]  five-minute piece is that almost everything in it is actually happening
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.680]  the UN says that if you're for one religion that's bigoted towards others
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:25.600]  more and more police are wearing ski masks just in public and obscuring their
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:31.480]  faces even if you're an atheist a lot of atheists have gotten mad by this video
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:37.120]  by saying you're under God that means the state isn't above you and that your
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:43.400]  rights come from God not the state hope folks understand that and just
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:52.080]  expanding on it multiple times Aaron and Rob Jacobson were in Kansas City a
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.360]  half mile away from the fellow reserve at a city part on a sidewalk shooting
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:00.120]  video at a distance of the fellow reserve building that they'd already been
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:04.800]  there and shot some video and a car pulls up and people get out armed federal
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:09.760]  security guards with guns and say give us your IDs and they go ahead and do that
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:12.800]  even though they had no authority and then they say now leave they said well
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.480]  no we're at a city park and they said okay they try to pull in their guns out
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:21.720]  and so my guys left and we put the video on YouTube in the Kansas City Star
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:25.280]  reported on it and did point out they had no authority and it was wrong then
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:28.360]  the Federal Reserve tried to deny that even done it that we had the video and
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:34.200]  so it's worse than that I mean security guards just show up and say leave you got
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:38.680]  two nicely dressed short-haired I mean you imagine what minorities must go
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:42.440]  through or people that don't look like you know kind of conservative they're
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:46.480]  just like why we're we're just here videotaping they're like I told you leave
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:51.560]  and the hands go to the weapons I mean it's just total tyranny and so that is
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:55.680]  what they're setting up right there as hardcore as the video seems it's actually
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:00.080]  worse in many respects and what that flag symbolizes is it is being destroyed
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.960]  is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys 18
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:08.840]  years ago we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:13.320]  days it's called zero debt in 90 days and it works for all credit card debt
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:18.160]  medical bills even collection lawsuits when I first joined I was being sued so
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.880]  I use the program methods and after filing one piece of paper the collection
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.040]  lawsuit was dismissed with zero debt in 90 days your success is guaranteed in
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.600]  writing there is no other program of its kind don't be along with creditors
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:34.480]  gang up on you let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.440]  stop creditors in only 90 days guaranteed prevent wage garnishments
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:42.440]  bank levies and stop collection calls with our proven program call zero debt in
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:46.960]  90 days now eight hundred four seven seven nine two five six and ask for free
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.560]  information from an expert who also completed our program eight hundred four
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:55.320]  seven seven nine two five six or zero debt guarantee dot com eight hundred four
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:21:00.960]  seven seven nine two five six or zero debt guarantee dot com they helped to
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.920]  create a new world order we are part of a new world order a new world order

[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:16.200]  overall though we should be very positive and thank God that so many
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.440]  people are waking up and we can actually have a real debate now about the global
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:25.080]  government instead of a hiding in the shadows and it has always been a great
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:29.080]  pleasure to be able to be a radio host to be able to talk to people I got
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:33.680]  involved 18 years ago started getting involved politically going to city
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:40.560]  council going to county commissioners 17 years ago going and spending six months
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:45.160]  to get my access TV license and learn how to use the equipment and did the TV
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:51.720]  show for about a year on my own got a radio show and and now look what we've
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:57.320]  done over those 16 years what we've been able to do with the truth and how much
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.960]  we've all learned together I mean that should be confidence building and those
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:05.440]  of you out there that have just woken up recently or many of you who've been
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.520]  awake before I was ever awake or before I was ever born every little thing you
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:14.360]  do to expose the globalist and to point out the hypocrisy and the corruption is
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:18.720]  one step closer to defeating the new world order they're going to try to
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.840]  stage riots and destabilization in this country with the globalist policies
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:26.840]  that they put in place they've been gearing up for it and they believe
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:30.560]  through that crisis they're going to sell the public on accepting an even
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:35.960]  more draconian control grip and that's because the globalist have set up a
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:40.360]  system where there is no room for a middle class there is no room for
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.760]  individuals to be able to control their own destinies and that is not something
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:51.080]  I want for myself that is not something that I want for my family and I know
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:54.520]  that's something you don't want so whether you're black white Hispanic old
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:58.480]  young whether you're a police officer whether you're a school teacher whether
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.360]  you're a doctor a lawyer an auto mechanic a rancher a farmer a scientist it
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:08.720]  doesn't matter all of us are human beings and we have that shared common bond
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:13.160]  and the globalist try to divide us on every front at every level and and and
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.960]  those divisions become real so then a lot of times you have to respond to a
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.440]  tax you're getting by a group and then that only adds to the overall confusion
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:27.800]  but once we begin to identify the central banking cartel really the Ponzi
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:33.040]  scheme cartel once we identify the new world order and get past the puppets of
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.000]  George W. Bush and Dick Cheney and Barack Obama and Joe Biden and all these
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  people there's nothing they can do once we understand their game plan and once
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.320]  the public understands order out of chaos if we get the word out the game is
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:54.640]  over and so we're in a race with the new world order they're moving faster and
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.440]  faster because they can see the growth curve awakening and so they're trying
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:02.200]  to clamp down on that and openly trying to condition you to internet kill
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:06.000]  switches are a good thing and censoring freedom of speech is a good thing and
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.320]  going after our second amendments a good thing but then when you look at all
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:13.080]  those issues they're popular with the people so the more they come after our
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.480]  free speech the more people wake up and get involved the more they come after
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:19.680]  our sovereignty the more people wake up and get involved the more the banks
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:26.560]  elude us and try to raise our taxes the more people wake up and get involved and
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:33.120]  so this idea of liberty versus tyranny is transcendent it it transcends
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:40.080]  borders it transcends time cultures race religion and if the people know the
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:45.520]  truth and can recognize what's wholesome and good and productive versus what's
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:49.160]  bad can you judge the fruit of a tree there's a lot of trees that have fruit
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:53.400]  or nuts on them that you can't eat how do you judge that tree judge it by its
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:58.120]  fruits or if you have a fruit tree that grows good fruit but it doesn't produce a
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:03.600]  lot of fruit you know it's a bad tree what produces good fruit what produces
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.720]  results what produces awakening that's what needs to be supported that's what
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:15.120]  needs to be promoted and we have done so much together so much and we can do so
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.320]  much more and yes for a long time we've been fighting an uphill battle because
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.960]  people believe they can't win Ron Paul is winning many of the straw polls and
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:27.040]  scientific polls as the number one presidential candidate and many others
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.120]  he's number two I don't even see anywhere he's number three but the media
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:36.320]  keeps saying he can't win he can't win he can't win that's what Donald Trump said
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:42.120]  at CPAC yesterday they're creating a self-fulfilling prophecy or trying to get
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:47.400]  you to jump to conclusions but even if Ron Paul runs and doesn't win we win
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:50.920]  because he'll have that platform and educate even more people about the
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:55.960]  globalist and about the private fellow reserve in the inflation tax you know he
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:59.960]  goes from not having one sponsor 15 years ago to passing auditing the Fed in
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:05.680]  the house next time it'll probably pass the Senate the point is is that we gain
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:10.920]  ground each time and by resisting we learn that we can have victories we
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:14.680]  learn that we can affect change and so they're back saying over and over again
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:19.400]  Ron Paul can't win Ron Paul can't win well Ron Paul wins by announcing he's
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:23.800]  gonna run hopefully soon you win when you run for city council it may take you
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:26.560]  a hundred times going down there and talking about fluoride but it'll get
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:32.720]  removed because you've got the truth on your side it's taken 37 years to start
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:36.560]  flipping public opinion against abortion we're moving against that we're
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:40.840]  winning on the second amendment now we can win win win together and I just
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:46.280]  want to thank you all for the great work you do the stations the sponsors the
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:52.320]  crew we couldn't do any of this without your support we're on the march the

[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:38.040]  of the prospective presidential candidates he says he's considering
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:45.080]  whether to run dismissing the chances of the 11 term congressman ron paul of
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:52.120]  beating obama in 2012 um saying he had quote zero chance of doing so and in
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:55.720]  fact we're just going to go to a brief clip of donald trump now saying that
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:59.880]  go to the clip i wish there was a candidate that i saw that would be
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:03.960]  fantastic because i love what i'm doing in fact i have a great club that's 15
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:07.720]  minutes away
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:15.640]  by the way ron paul could not get elected i'm sorry to tell you
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:43.560]  and you know what else i like ron paul i think he's a good guy but honestly he
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:55.320]  has just zero chance of getting elected you have to win an election
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:59.720]  so that's donald trump there and um joe you've since been quoted in the
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:04.920]  national journal as labeling trump's comments as quote preposterous
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:12.360]  um explain to us why he's wrong and how in fact um ron paul can be obama

[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:41.000]  effect his his mouth i respectfully say that he
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.080]  he needs to distinguish between a cheer and a cheer this morning he was on
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.440]  morning joe saying that when he made that comment he was um
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:52.040]  i've been cheered wildly and i think if you look at it and listen to it
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:57.240]  he was being cheered as much as he was being uh he was being cheered
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:00.040]  he but he made the comment that congressman paul kind of didn't have
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:03.560]  any electability and and of course the interesting thing was that the
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:08.120]  congressman paul has been actually elected to office 11 times and and
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:14.040]  mr trump i believe has not uh been elected to any office and um
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:18.280]  so i think it's i did say it was a preposterous statement um for him to say
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:23.160]  that kind of dismissing dr paul out of hand who has a very large national
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:26.120]  organization really in place should he choose to use it
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:30.840]  he has national name recognition and more importantly he really has a serious
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:35.480]  sound economic policy foreign policy monetary policy
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:40.440]  a program to defense civil liberties um that's well articulated and very popular
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:44.440]  not only among republicans and libertarians independence but many
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:50.120]  uh democrats as well is a very broad reach and so uh well mr
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:55.000]  trump is a now a kind of a television star and a real estate mogul and a
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.560]  wonderful american who uh has a lot of vitality for the free market and a lot
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:03.400]  of respect for him i did make the comment that uh
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:07.640]  you know this is this is politics and uh and he is in many ways um
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:11.480]  really a neophyte at that uh just uh in terms of he has not run for office to
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:16.280]  my knowledge and and hasn't won so i i think i think dr paul were
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:20.680]  to run i think uh would mount a serious um
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:25.880]  challenge to barack obama uh given that his policies are really the antithesis
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.880]  of mr obama's policies of more government more intervention
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:33.400]  dr paul being more freedom less intervention both nationally and
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:37.400]  internationally and of course we had this
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:40.840]  rasmussen paul this week which um shows that
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:45.160]  ron paul has a better chance of beating obama than indeed
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:49.240]  sarah paleon who of course is not there at c pack but she's going to be one of
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:53.320]  the big establishment republican candidates who they're going to heavily
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:57.960]  push in the coming months and this paul showed that ron paul was two points
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:00.920]  ahead of her in terms of the ability to defeat
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:05.080]  obama now what's interesting is we had this recent
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:08.600]  15 point bounce that obama enjoyed after the
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:13.080]  two-son shootings um before that and of course that bounce
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.520]  is certain to subside before that we had a paul
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:19.800]  another rasmussen paul in april of last year that said that
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:25.240]  if ron paul and obama went head to head that it would basically be a dead he
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:28.680]  i mean obama only edged that paul by one percent
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:32.680]  and that's before of course this the mobilization of the grassroots
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:36.200]  ron paul movement that you just mentioned so
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:40.440]  i mean both of those polls completely contradict trump's claim that you've
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:43.880]  got quote zero chance surely don't they joe
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:48.440]  well it really does and it's a couple of serious polls
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:52.120]  showing really this statistical dead heat um
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:56.040]  and again i think that's because dr paul has a legitimate
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:02.200]  foreign policy domestic policy and um and that is it is appealing uh not only
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:06.600]  two republicans but also many many democrats independence libertarians
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:10.120]  and it's well articulated and it's thoughtful and it actually i think
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:13.800]  americans this next cycle are really going to be looking for solutions
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:17.480]  um and a seren palin is certainly a charismatic figure
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:21.480]  clearly a polarizing figure mr obama has been a polarizing figure
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:25.240]  i think dr paul with his emphasis on the constitution
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:29.160]  um that being that document that really welcomes everyone
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:35.000]  uh and and addresses their concerns um a broad spectrum of people can can
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.480]  look at and live within the constitution and and um and to be able to pursue
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:44.920]  their life liberty and happiness um i think there's a broad base appeal
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:48.760]  and um and his candidacy if he were to run would be uh would be serious and a
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:52.360]  serious challenge so again mr trump is a
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.520]  charismatic and a delightful american and charming and very successful in many
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:00.120]  ways and um but i think um to dismiss a serious
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:06.840]  candidate out of hand uh i thought was uh somewhat whimsical on his part
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:10.200]  and i mean you mentioned the fact that we've got this whole raft of
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:14.760]  polarizing candidates um certainly many of which are there at c pack at the
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:18.760]  moment uh isn't it the case that you know if republicans
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:22.760]  just elect uh a george bush 2.0 someone like
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:26.040]  mit romney or new gingrich you know another neocon
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:30.680]  that will completely eliminate the chances of securing these
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:33.400]  swing votes we know that there are millions of
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:37.240]  dissatisfied independents and democrats who have completely
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:41.000]  lost faith in you know obama's hope and change
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.720]  and that those votes are on the table and in fact won't ron paul be in the
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:49.560]  perfect position to capture that demographic whereas the
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:55.720]  more establishment candidates won't well and this is something that um
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:58.920]  america is really kind of waking up to with the republican party and the
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:03.320]  democratic party this kind of swing from polar opposite to polar opposite
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:07.800]  um really um you know you have one party winning and of course they want to
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.720]  benefit their special interest group the other party wins they want to benefit
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:16.280]  their special interest group supporters but really um you know the two parties
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:20.040]  really have one thing in common they really want to interfere and intervene
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:23.480]  in your life certainly domestically and internationally
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:26.440]  um you know they want to be involved in your money they want to be involved in
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:30.920]  your freedom your civil liberties and now we even have the moxie
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:35.560]  to say that we want to be involved in um making decisions for our other
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:39.800]  sovereign nations around the world and someone like a dr paul someone with
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:43.480]  that more libertarian more free market more constitutional traditional
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:47.480]  american-based worldview is really more of what you'd call
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:50.600]  a non-interventionist the person that says we look at our citizens we treat
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:54.360]  them with respect as adults they make their choices they take the
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:58.520]  responsibility for their choices and good heavens overseas these are sovereign
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:02.040]  people and sovereign nations really it's kind of none of our business to get
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:06.440]  involved with uh with them dictating what they should do and i think and
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:11.240]  hopefully that's what we'll do is we'll if you will kind of transcend this
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:14.760]  seesawing back and forth between interventionists on the right versus
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:18.120]  interventionists on the left and going back and forth and think if we're
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:21.960]  really going to solve problems such as our debt such as these foreign wars and
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:25.720]  our civil liberties then we're really going to have to look to people that are
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:29.640]  principled um in traditional american values of free
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:33.560]  markets a true free market um and true constitutional
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:38.200]  uh you know reestablishing our really our constitutional republican making
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:43.160]  sure that's that's vibrant and vital and and so that's why a a dr paul type
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:46.520]  candidate would be so helpful to this country whereas
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:50.760]  many of these other candidates democrat or republican would be kind of a
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:55.560]  continuation of this whipsawing kind of a polarity and
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.280]  and you know to this point of civil liberties and this is really where our
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:03.000]  group liberty guard really comes in and the
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.280]  the work we've been doing with the tsa and then i've had the pleasure of
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.280]  talking to alex and his audience about this vital issue
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:14.680]  of the tsa and how they have um as part and parcel
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:19.160]  of this culture of intervention feel that they can of course
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:25.080]  um not only take uh electronic images of us trying to get into airports that
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:30.840]  end up essentially denuding us and and and taking nude photographs of us um
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:34.600]  uh and but then there's much more uh draconian
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:38.040]  measure of of these uh full body searches and that's
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:41.000]  something that liberty guard has been very active in
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:47.640]  combating and that's something we were um wanting to visit with you today on
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:51.480]  yeah because of course liberty guard was one of the groups at the um
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:54.920]  forefront of the backlash against the tsa which really
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:58.920]  kicked into high gear um at the back end of last year
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:03.720]  now you had this freedom of information act request and of course that was
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:07.240]  dealing with um a demand for the tsa to turn
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:11.080]  overall information on this blatantly obvious
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:14.680]  stand down that occurred over the thanksgiving period
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:17.960]  when reports were pouring in from across the country
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:21.960]  of naked body scanners being turned off and these
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:25.640]  uh invasive pat downs being temporarily
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:30.040]  mothballed in what we wrote at the time basically was a
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:35.640]  you know a political stunt to derail the momentum of this national
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:39.560]  opt-out day protest which was occurring at exactly the same time
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:46.200]  now joe first the tsa tried to ignore you they tried to buy some time with this
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:51.160]  uh freedom of information act request um now i understand you've got to the
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:54.920]  stage where you're preparing uh the lawsuit can you give us an update on
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.960]  that situation and where it's heading at the moment
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:01.240]  well thank you and yes that's that's exactly right when i last spoke with
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:05.640]  with alex we were talking uh and we had of course filed the
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:08.600]  freedom of information act and we were fully expecting that
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:12.440]  we would not get a response and i think we was even on the air the day
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:17.720]  that the um that the tsa needed to respond and much to our amazement
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:20.920]  um quite literally at the last moment moments before it was
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:24.680]  it was due um we were notified that they were responding
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:28.200]  and essentially uh that was really a tactical
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:32.120]  maneuver on their part to prohibit us from actually be
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:36.520]  actually being able to file the federal lawsuit that we were prepared
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:42.760]  to file it forced us to go into an administrative remedy
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:49.480]  uh in which we and the tsa begin a process of of discussions to try to
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:53.000]  understand and get to the bottom of this but
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.240]  the problem is of course that could take a month or two or six
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:01.240]  they could certainly drag it out uh one could understand why they would want to
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:05.000]  drag it out because in their response to us
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.320]  they said and really our response paul we wanted to know specifics and we wanted
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:13.800]  to say um did you discuss alex jones did you
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:17.400]  discuss prison planet did you discuss bob bar and
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:23.000]  liberty guard did you discuss matt drudge um um and if you did we want to
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.640]  know about it and did you have discussions
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:30.120]  that might indicate that you were going to stand down on the day or two
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:33.400]  uh the thanksgiving day or two before these are the most heavily traveled
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:37.560]  days and the days uh in where the tsa what they have
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:41.560]  told us is that those would be the days you'd want to have lots of extra scans
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:45.560]  you'd want to really have those machines at top form because they have told us
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:49.800]  that our our well-being and our safety in the skies is contingent
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.840]  upon those machines and contingent upon those searches
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:57.080]  we had called for the opt-out alliance that day of opting out
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:01.080]  people saying i don't want the i don't want to scan i want to pat down and
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:06.600]  really to kind of share with the much with really all americans the um
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:10.680]  intrusive nature this is to bring it to their attention through the media
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:15.480]  and when they called it off uh and um they shut down the machines and they
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:19.480]  did not do the patdowns on the very day that they should be doing the most of
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.160]  them to protect americans we couldn't help but think
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:26.520]  did they do that for a political reason did they realize that the
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:29.720]  media spotlight and the and the awareness of the american people were
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:32.120]  going to really be on them and what they were doing
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:35.080]  and i think you know this is one of these procedures
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:38.680]  paul where you know civil liberties had had an abstract nature to it we think
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:42.600]  about it freedom of speech which it's so ubiquitous in this country we take it
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:46.920]  for granted but when we see you know a grandmother or a
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:52.680]  nun or a child being essentially groped and fondled and
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:55.960]  and um you know all but strip searched essentially
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:59.560]  and we see the demeaning component of it um
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:03.320]  it's uh it's shocking to us and it's and and it's kind of a
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:09.320]  visual symbol of the degeneration of the vitality of the protection of our
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:14.760]  civil liberties um particularly when it a real question arises based
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:18.440]  upon some studies is how effective this really is in protecting
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:22.840]  american safety in the sky so there's a real serious question of whether they
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:27.080]  whether they did that we filed the FOIA to to force that to force their hand
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:30.840]  they get back to us and say you know we've got nine pages
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:34.920]  that really address the very issues you are raising
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:40.120]  and oh by the way and this is fascinating how bureaucracies work
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:44.680]  when you said um do we have information talking about alex
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:48.680]  jones and prison planet and bob bar and liberty guard and matt drudge
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:52.760]  on these four or five eight days um we didn't think you were being specific
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:57.560]  enough so we wouldn't even do that search now i guess i would say when
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:00.440]  you use a proper noun and some with the name
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:03.320]  and you give them a four or five or eight or ten day range
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:06.920]  um gee with any of us could could figure out how to do that
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:12.680]  um so i think um they've they've said we got nine pages on the one topic
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:16.360]  um um we of course have to know that that on these other
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:19.560]  topics they have information they're not disclosing it
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:23.000]  and um and we got back to them in a very vigorous way
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.480]  and are and are demanding um to get to the bottom of it and so we filed kind of
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:32.200]  a second rebuttal of that FOIA um to really drill down and make sure that
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:37.160]  we're getting to the bottom of it um so that's really the
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:41.640]  update all on the first FOIA and that's just amazing the fact
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:44.760]  that they tacitly admit that they were talking about alex
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:48.360]  jones and prison planet with these nine pages relating to your
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:52.520]  freedom of information at request we'll be back after the break with joe c
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:56.840]  using of liberty guard dot org to talk about this and more stay tuned it's the
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:00.840]  alex jones show live prison planet dot tv
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:04.360]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:07.720]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:11.080]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:14.680]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:18.280]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:22.120]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:25.800]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank

[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:31.240]  welcome back to the alex joneshow friday february 11 2011 we're talking to joe
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:37.240]  c huesen president and ceo of liberty god at liberty god.org and joe
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:41.320]  just dropped the proverbial bombshell before the break
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:46.840]  um it turns out that the tsa does have nine pages of information
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:50.840]  um which were created at the height of the tsa backlash
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:54.200]  uh at the end of last year which talk about matt drudge
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:59.960]  liberty god bob bar alex jones and prison planet uh just as we said all
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:03.080]  along the stalling uh in responding to this
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:07.720]  foyer request um looks like it was exactly that it was designed to prevent
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:13.720]  the release of this information um joe do you think the tsa will
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:18.120]  basically be forced to release those nine pages and what's the
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:22.280]  timescale on that well that's precisely the the work that that we're
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:26.120]  doing at liberty god and i want to i want to modify what what i'm hearing you
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:30.040]  hearing you say as as best i understand it they have nine pages
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:33.880]  that specifically regard this possibility of their
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:37.960]  kind of uh kind of shutting down or standing down on these issues
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:41.480]  and then of course we want to get to the bottom of the political possibility
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:45.400]  that they did this um really from a from a political point of view as to a
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:49.240]  public safety point of view that the point regarding alex jones prison
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:55.800]  planet matt drudge etc is that they won't even um do the search
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:00.520]  because they said there's not enough specific information which is absurd
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:03.400]  on the face of it and we're pursuing that of course
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:07.240]  to force them to discourage what information they have about
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:11.160]  alex jones and and and matt drudge vis-a-vis this issue
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:16.760]  in those dates and so i think we do really get a a clear indication from
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:20.600]  them they have information um they're not disclosing it
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:25.560]  we're in it in a in a in a process of forcing them to disclose that
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:29.880]  if we get through this administrative phase and it's not satisfactory
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:32.920]  then liberty guard is prepared to take it to a federal court
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:37.240]  that would be our remedy after this process we not only
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:41.160]  paul have filed the FOIA on the issue that we've been discussing
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:44.840]  but two others one of them intriguing the other
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:49.640]  frightening uh this one what was called the screening partnership program
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:55.240]  which is a program where the tsa said to private airports
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:58.760]  you know you can use our tsa and and i believe those are union
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:03.880]  um screeners or you can use your own contract screeners private corporations
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:08.520]  and companies that would put forward the screeners and they did a study to see
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:11.480]  of the effectiveness of the two different groups and they
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:15.560]  hired a consulting firm called the catapult consulting firm
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:20.120]  they never disclosed the result of that and and we're confident
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:24.200]  that the result of that study is that the private screeners did a superior job
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:28.200]  to the tsa screeners but we're forcing them to disclose
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:31.400]  um that particular contract and of course the taxpayers paid about a
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:35.000]  half a million dollars to get that study done that's an interesting one that
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.520]  we're going to track but the one i also wanted to mention to you paul is the
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:42.760]  one um that the department of homeland
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:47.400]  security none other than uh ben jenet napolitano herself big sis
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:50.920]  is putting in place with if you can imagine their new partner
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:53.960]  walmart their program called see something
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:58.200]  say something now imagine this you're checking out
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:04.360]  uh at walmart and um and in line you have a screen in front of you
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:08.280]  and up comes janet napolitano who gives you a lecture and a talk on
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:13.800]  national security and safety and terrorism and and and tells you you know
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:17.240]  if you see something you gotta say something and then you go along and
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:21.000]  buy your coca-cola and your beach ball um but you just in effect have an
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.680]  indoctrination um from the uh from the tsa in the
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:27.800]  department of homeland security we're really challenging that that's
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:31.800]  actually in effect at 600 walmart stores and we want to just stay there
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:35.080]  we'll be back after the break if you can hold over we'll talk about it soon

[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:27.800]  paul joe's a forson filling in for alex jones on this friday february 11th
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:32.760]  edition and we're talking to joe c hueson uh president and ceo of
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:35.880]  liberty god uh who of course are leading the fight
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:40.440]  against big sis and the tsa now joe was just talking before the break
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:44.280]  about how his uh group is looking to get more
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:47.640]  information on this study which found that the the private
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:53.560]  security airports had hired um were more successful than tsa itself
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:57.080]  which is very interesting given the fact this week that john
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:02.120]  pastoli the head of the tsa has moved to block the ability of private
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:05.960]  airports from replacing the tsa with their own private
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:09.480]  security of course a massive invasion of the tenth
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:13.320]  amendment and states rights but joe after that you were just
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:17.960]  mentioning the uh walmart telly screens uh and big sis as
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:21.320]  message to shoppers now what's your investigation into that
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:23.960]  concluded
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:28.920]  well again i i think if you look at all of these things that we're discussing
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:33.880]  it's just a is a breathtaking rapid deterioration of civil liberties i mean
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:37.240]  we're being failed and assaulted as american people
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:41.080]  by these procedures um you just mentioned this uh
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:45.880]  the uh the private versus uh the public and tsa and this is this
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:49.720]  protecting a special interest group in this case the tsa unions is that
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:52.760]  what's driving this or is it really public safety and this
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:55.720]  catapult consulting study seems to address that and
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:59.160]  our suspicion is that it came out in favor of the private
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:02.680]  contractors and uh and i get perhaps that's not politically
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:07.320]  expedient for um for the tsa but again that comes back to the question of the
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:10.840]  safety american people versus political expediency and so that's
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:16.040]  a shocking revelation to me and then and then we move along to walmart
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:20.200]  and now we're into orwellian country of you know people they're buying their
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:24.760]  their their walmart goods and looking up at screens and seeing big sis with a
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:27.800]  beatific smile telling them to uh if you see
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:32.040]  something um say something uh are we now going to be
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:34.760]  reporting on and tattletales of our neighbors
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:37.720]  are we going to be kind of making stuff up and uh
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:42.120]  um i mean we're all in favor of national security uh who wouldn't be
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:46.360]  but at the expense of what and our civil liberties our freedom our constitution
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:50.360]  uh no thank you that's not going to happen this actually went into effect
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:54.120]  december of last year it went into 600 stores
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:57.480]  and if you go to the walmart has this up on its own website
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:00.840]  it says it's it's the first proud national partner
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:04.200]  with the good folks down at the department of homeland security
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:06.920]  well it's the first national partner first of all they're a pretty big
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:11.000]  partner to to get started with i think every other store is going to
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.840]  really fall in line and does that mean when we go to the grocery store we're
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:18.200]  going to have big sis uh looking at us and wagging her
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:20.840]  finger and telling us exactly what we need to do
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:24.520]  um is this i mean how far is this down the road of indoctrination and
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:29.640]  propaganda um you know this is surreal to to
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:33.880]  to americans and uh looking at this this is the this is the kind of thing that
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:37.240]  we are that we are not accustomed to and that we feel we really need to stand
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:40.360]  tall and and get to the bottom of and that's what liberty guard is doing we
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:45.160]  filed this for you to say jeez we need to know more about what this is
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:48.440]  what kind of deals were struck is there any quid pro quo here i mean is there
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:53.320]  anything in this for for walmart um and if so we certainly like to to know
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:57.640]  about that and and kind of a summary statement that that i would
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:02.200]  make to you paul is that we've been actively involved in this at liberty
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:05.800]  guard and and really we've followed the tsa and department of
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:09.640]  homeland security procedures and we've kind of as we as we're going to the
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:12.440]  front door we've had that front door really kind of slammed in our face i
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:14.920]  mean there's an acknowledgement we got nine pages
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:18.680]  uh of information about this and we're just not going to tell you about it
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:21.960]  so what we're going to do just to give you and your your listeners a bit of a
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:25.720]  heads up we have devised a uh a an additional
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:29.960]  way that we're going to be pursuing this as we are going to continue to
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:34.120]  to take the legal remedies administrative remedies that are available to us
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:37.720]  we have another program that we're putting into place that is also going
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:41.480]  to address this and a specific thing and we're going to we're going to come on

[02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:05.000]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.920]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:11.800]  bill number two our new energies are wants to
[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:15.080]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:19.320]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:22.920]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:27.400]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:31.240]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:34.440]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:38.360]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:42.200]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:45.560]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest

[02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:13.480]  perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for

[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:23.080]  yet another foyer request that they've launched uh in the continuing
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:29.080]  backlash against big sis and the tsa uh we're going to go to your calls for
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:33.400]  bob Chapman at the bottom of the hour who of course needs no introduction he's
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:38.680]  the founder and editor of international forecaster financial newsletter
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:46.040]  at international forecaster dot com the phone in number is 800 259 92 31 that's
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:52.360]  800 259 92 31 um bob great to speak to you again
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:56.920]  good to have you back on the show today well thank you very much and
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:09:01.240]  as always on friday i'm very happy to be here
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:08.600]  now the uh imf is out again repeating their call for the sdr to replace the
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:12.600]  dollar as this embryonic global reserve currency
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:17.080]  and of course we know from previous imf documents
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:21.160]  um that were published last year that this sdr
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:26.280]  transference is merely a stepping stone to the eventual implementation of a
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:31.000]  you know a truly global currency that will be controlled by a global
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.720]  central bank and they've even named what the global currency will be called is
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:40.680]  the bank or currency uh bob given the fact that the
[02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:44.920]  global elite already have such a tight grip on the global economy
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:49.560]  uh why do they need this global currency
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:53.480]  i think more than anything else it's a control factor
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:59.480]  if you go back to 1969 when the sdr was invented so to speak
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:07.000]  it came at a time when they tried to use it as a substitute for gold
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:14.840]  and it turned out very badly uh gold ran up and uh and after 1971 it ran up
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:20.680]  some more and then in 1978 the imf sold gold and uh
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:25.320]  and so the sdr never got any headway and i don't think it ever will
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:33.400]  under the rules uh they cannot be gold backed sdrs and i it's my personal
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:38.840]  opinion after these many years that there is no system that can work
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:45.240]  without gold backing and the reason why is the temptation is so great
[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:49.640]  that people are always going to print more money or
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:54.040]  they create more credit than they should and it's been shown over and over again
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:57.560]  i i was writing a article this morning
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:01.880]  uh for tomorrow's issue and uh i talked about
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:07.080]  uh china and if nobody has any experience at this
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:10.920]  the chinese do i mean they've been printing paper money and i think they
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:16.840]  were the first ones to do it uh for almost a thousand years
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:22.440]  and it was better than having iron or copper coins because the irons were
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:29.800]  irons were really heavy and so they have found that in
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:35.720]  using a currency without backing it's always collapsed
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:39.560]  and they know that very well and so does all of these people
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:43.560]  like brandanke and greenspan and so on who are
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:51.320]  quote financial experts like myself they believe that they can do it again
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:54.920]  and and isn't going to happen and of course it's going to happen
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:12:00.200]  and so the sdr isn't going to work the bank who is going to isn't going to work
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:06.520]  kinsianism is not working and it it really is after all these
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:10.840]  years of studying it looking at it kinsianism is nothing more
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:15.560]  than corporate it corporatist economic fascism
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:22.840]  and it's too undeniably create monopolies that control governments
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:26.200]  and uh the only thing that's going to work is
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:31.320]  either a conglomeration of currencies maybe five or ten or twenty
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:35.400]  put together they all have gold backing and they all have a
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:40.040]  percentage interest in the unit in an index
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:44.200]  or they could go back to the dollar after it's devalued
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:47.960]  and uh and they've written off their debt like all the other
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:52.280]  currencies would that perhaps the dollar would be backed against they were
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:56.840]  twenty five percent gold and if that happened it would work fine
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:00.040]  uh august of fifteen nineteen seventy one
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:05.160]  was the year that this whole thing really started to come unglued
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:10.280]  and uh there's no way back for them the only thing they can do is back another
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:15.320]  currency would go whatever it is and it's not going to be the sdr
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:21.880]  now i mean basically the sdr is a basket of currencies you've got the dollar
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:26.360]  the euro the yen the british pound but now we're hearing calls to
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:31.400]  include the chinese yuan in this in this basket of sdr currencies
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:36.600]  is is this a move to um kind of exalt china as the new global powerhouse
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:41.000]  while you know the us empire fades
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:48.040]  yes i think it is and the chinese problems are every bit is serious
[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:52.840]  is america's problems i mean you go from province to province inflation varies
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:56.840]  widely but if you go to wandong and you go you decide to go
[02:13:56.840 --> 02:14:00.440]  shopping in hong kong which is not too far away
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:04.840]  you'll find that you'll save an average of about 35 percent in cost so
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:09.400]  uh what is chinese inflation they say it's five and a quarter percent
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:14.440]  uh maybe fifteen maybe twenty percent but it all depends on what province you're
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:18.120]  in and that's always been that way in china um
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:21.400]  what is american inflation they say it's one and a half percent
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:25.720]  i say the six and three quarters percent and qe one
[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:32.200]  and the stimulus the first one will take inflation to 14 percent this year
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:39.560]  followed by qe two and the stimulus two that you saw in the tax package which i
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:45.160]  called the pork package and uh where's that going to push the two 20 percent
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:49.320]  no these this is really serious and it's the only way they can keep the system
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:52.760]  going they don't have any choice they can't raise interest rates
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:57.240]  and they can't stop pumping money in and of course when that happens
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:00.920]  all of the currencies fall against gold and silver
[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:06.280]  and i know the other day max was on uh max kaiser was on with uh
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:12.840]  with alex and he said the same thing and over the last ten out of 11 years
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:19.880]  uh the average uh loss of the nine the nine largest
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:25.160]  currencies uh over that period uh was 15 and a quarter
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:29.880]  percent and with silver it was 20 and three eighth percent
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:34.360]  so it's an ongoing situation where
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:39.560]  all currencies are falling in value against gold and silver and the reason
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:44.280]  why they are is that they continue to create money
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:48.760]  and credit and there's a number of ways to do it which i won't go into
[02:15:48.760 --> 02:15:53.320]  and they're destroying the currencies and the only way to protect yourself is
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:56.200]  go to go to the silver
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:15:59.880]  and of course on the subject of inflation of course
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:04.920]  unlike the federal reserve the bank of china is constantly hiking up interest
[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:08.440]  rates to try and cope with it um we had
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:11.960]  of course you're predicting 14 percent real inflation
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:16.680]  in the united states by the end of the year last week i wrote an article
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:19.800]  based on what the national inflation association were
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:23.720]  saying and basically they were saying that everything that we've seen unfold
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:27.480]  on the streets of cairo over the past two or three weeks
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:33.560]  will come to resemble americans it is in by 2015 they said
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:37.480]  of course food inflation and food shortages were
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:41.400]  two of the primary reasons why the revolution in egypt
[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:47.800]  was started in the first place you had egyptians spending 40 percent of their
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:52.440]  income on food alone as a result of the inflation
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:56.440]  that had taken place in america it's roughly at the moment it's roughly
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:01.160]  13 percent of income is spent on food
[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:07.320]  but bob we've got the money supply it's going to have risen by 192 percent by
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:11.160]  the time qe2 has finished and that's not even taken into account
[02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:17.320]  qe3 and qe4 as you mentioned um tell us how this inflation is going to
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:21.720]  impact americans over the next few years and what can they do about it is it
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:25.000]  just buying gold or is it a combination of that and
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.120]  storeable food what can people do to prepare for this
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:33.560]  inflationary holocaust well it's uh what we've talked about for a long time on
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:37.400]  this program and others and it's dehydrated
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:41.320]  freeze dried foods a water filter and something to defend your family
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:48.840]  very very important because today it's very difficult to keep your job and if
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:52.360]  you're lucky enough too that you know you won't need it right away
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:57.080]  the food uh on the other hand people are getting laid off left and right
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:00.440]  big corporations uh they haven't hired much at all
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:03.160]  and that's how they were improving their bottom line
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:11.000]  so i expect um in fact i did a program this morning on press tv and tehran
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:18.120]  and i was talking about the reason why we we would not have better employment
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:23.800]  figures we're looking at if you check the uh
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:28.040]  birth death ratio which is the birth and death of jobs
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:31.640]  and that was something that was thought up
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:36.280]  in order to manipulate the employment figures if you throw that out
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:43.320]  and you add its component uh to the uh u6 which is 16 and
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:48.920]  38 percent you come up with 22.6 percent real employment now
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:53.720]  you've got municipalities and states who are going to have to lay off
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:57.400]  because of tremendous death that they have some of them will go bankrupt as
[02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:04.040]  well and then you also have returning veterans and
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:09.240]  there's a fair amount of them and they are finding it almost
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:13.240]  impossible to get a job i get four or five letters a day from college
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:18.040]  graduates what do i do what do i do and you just keep on trying
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:22.440]  and some people will say well i'll take anything i can get
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:25.560]  and then they go to get a job and everybody in there is in the illegal
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:29.160]  area so they can't find a job sweeping floors
[02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:33.080]  or collecting garbage you know the lower order
[02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:37.320]  jobs even though they're willing to take them and so it's going to get worse
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:41.880]  before it gets better okay we'll be back after the break
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:46.360]  taking your questions for bob Chapman 800 259

[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:15.480]  irresponsibly divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent when
[02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:18.680]  the market becomes volatile us treasuries are a safe haven
[02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:22.120]  but what do you do when the u.s government overextends itself and
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:26.280]  spends beyond its means many investors are turning toward gold is a common sense

[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:46.440]  now business insider article today 11 countries at risk of becoming the next
[02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:51.480]  egypt and you read this article and there seems to be a common theme
[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:56.920]  every single country on the list has high inflation soaring food costs
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:01.720]  and high unemployment which of course is exactly what we're facing now
[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:07.800]  in america. Bob they say that you know every society's three meals away from
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:11.960]  a revolution it's a question we've asked many times
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:15.400]  what will it take for american cities to resemble
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:19.240]  the scenes that we've been witnessing in egypt over the past couple of weeks is
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:27.480]  it going to come down to food shortages and inflation to really kick things off
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:31.720]  well on this and on other programs i've said many times
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:36.680]  when asked what is going to snap these people into gear
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:43.000]  who are hesitant don't want to know uh see the evidence but don't care and i
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:48.760]  always said empty bellies and we're on the cusp of that
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:52.360]  that's caused for two reasons floods and
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:59.800]  and droughts poor crops and then on top of it you have a flight to quality
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:04.440]  in investment the stock market yes it's up
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:10.600]  it's up because of the money that the federal reserve is put into in this
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:15.240]  instance purchasing treasuries and agencies
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:19.480]  bonds uh that's fanny freddy jenny and fha bonds
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:24.200]  besides treasuries and that allows other investors
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:28.520]  professional uh banking brokerage houses
[02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:32.440]  speculators to speculate in the market because they don't have to spend any
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:36.680]  money trying to purchase bonds because the fed's
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:41.720]  already doing it and so that that excessiveness of money
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:45.560]  that's in the system has gone into the market but there are those
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:48.680]  who are saying no this is not going to stand up
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:55.800]  they just saw the bond market uh us 10 uh treasury note go from 220
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:27:01.960]  to 274 today and that's a point and a half and that means
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:08.440]  that we're going to see 30 year fixed rate mortgages
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:12.760]  probably in the vicinity of five and a half to five and five eight percent
[02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:17.080]  because i think that figure for the 10 will go from 374
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:20.280]  to four percent or four and a quarter in that eight area
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:25.240]  before it rests again so to speak when you put all these things together and
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:27.880]  investors are saying no and i don't want to be there
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:31.560]  so i'll go over and do commodities gold and silver
[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:35.880]  and that's what they've been doing and remember ladies and gentlemen
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:41.000]  that the commodity index the CRB index is still
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.640]  about 60 points from its high three years ago
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:48.840]  and so i think the high is going to be broken
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:52.520]  because the money that's flowing into commodities is going to push
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:57.560]  prices up it's not only food it's also base metals go to the silver plot in
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:01.800]  the platinum and cotton and on and on and that's going to
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:06.280]  continue because it's a safe harbor and who's
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:10.280]  going to pay for it the poorer countries of the world at first
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:14.840]  riots revolution starvation particularly starvation
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:18.600]  and that'll be followed in perhaps a year or two
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:24.760]  by problems in bigger more wealthy nations such as the united states west
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:30.120]  in europe maybe even canada and i think that
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:35.480]  that is what's going to finally give that shove
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:38.440]  to individuals within that society particularly
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:43.240]  with higher unemployment uh it's going to give it the shove that's going to
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:47.000]  bring the people in the streets in the same way
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:51.560]  that have brought them into the streets recently in tenetia in egypt
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:55.800]  and that is that's that's the way it's headed so
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:29:02.040]  the group that you cited the nia is probably right
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:06.760]  and i'm probably white right as well how long it will take
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:11.480]  remains to be seen i can't answer that and i don't think anybody can
[02:29:11.480 --> 02:29:14.440]  but that's what we're headed
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:19.000]  now you mentioned gold i wanted to get your take on this one we'll probably
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.480]  take your answer after the break but considering the fact that goldman sacks
[02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:27.080]  habitually do the opposite of what they tell their clients
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:30.680]  it's interesting today that they've put out a note saying that
[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:35.240]  basically the gold rally's over the us dollar's going to get stronger
[02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:38.680]  um and that everything's going to be hunky dory i will get a bob
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:42.600]  Chapman's take on that after the break we'll also go to your calls 800
[02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:47.080]  259 9231 stay tuned
[02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:54.920]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:54.920 --> 02:29:59.880]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:05.720]  hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs

[02:31:01.720 --> 02:31:05.720]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:31:05.720 --> 02:31:09.960]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:13.000]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:16.200]  americans at home and have turned tremendous influence
[02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:20.200]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots
[02:31:20.200 --> 02:31:25.400]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:29.400]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:33.080]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty

[02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:44.040]  saying who do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care
[02:31:44.040 --> 02:31:49.160]  right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic

[02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:06.280]  solar power generator number one new climate
[02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:09.160]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:32:09.160 --> 02:32:13.400]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:32:13.400 --> 02:32:17.000]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:20.520]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:24.200]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:32:24.200 --> 02:32:27.160]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:31.080]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:34.200]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:38.120]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:41.000]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:44.040]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:46.760]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more

[02:33:01.720 --> 02:33:07.880]  i'm your master's of war
[02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:12.360]  here to build the big guns
[02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:19.880]  here to build the death planes here to build all the bombs
[02:33:19.880 --> 02:33:24.440]  we're back it's the alex joneshow with bob Chapman of the international
[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:28.920]  forecaster uh bob goldman sacks habitually do the
[02:33:28.920 --> 02:33:32.440]  opposite of what they tell their clients to do now they're saying that
[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:36.600]  the u.s economy set for a rapid recovery that gold's going to flop
[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:40.200]  um that the u.s dollar will get stronger
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:44.040]  does that mean it's the perfect time to buy gold
[02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:47.800]  well it certainly is an indication that it could be
[02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:53.080]  um you know you you you have to look at uh
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:34:00.840]  loyd blank and fine and uh he says uh we're doing god's work
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:04.440]  and you know this is the attitude that these people have
[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:08.440]  and you're right they do do and want to do
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:13.480]  the opposite of what they tell the public and there's no controlling that
[02:34:13.480 --> 02:34:16.920]  it's just like uh when they write and they speak
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:21.320]  they don't even tell you their positions and and a good example is their
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:25.320]  trading departments i mean they be talking about buying stock
[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:30.280]  and their trading department uh may very well be sure at the stock
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:34.840]  and so there's there's no control whatsoever over what they do
[02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:39.000]  but the answer straight up is yes gold and silver are going higher there's no
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.560]  way they can keep it down inflation is going higher unemployment at best will
[02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:47.240]  go sideways and this is going to continue for the
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:51.960]  next few years what are they going to try to
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:56.200]  straighten out the dollar situation probably when it drops
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:35:03.000]  below 71 18 on the usdx it's around 77 and a half right now
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.520]  and uh that that won't become a reality when
[02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:10.360]  i don't know when neither does anybody else but that's the you know the
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:14.280]  direction that we're headed you you pick the trend and you stay
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:17.400]  with it because the trend is your friend and you
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:21.000]  don't have to trade you just get low and stay long
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:25.080]  and that's what this saving your capital is all about
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:28.840]  by being in gold and silver related assets uh
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:37.320]  i think over the next two years that the price of food will double again
[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:41.560]  i mean we put up with all of their reduced size of packages
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:45.320]  and you're going to buy buy a box of cereal instead of getting let's say
[02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:49.000]  20 ounces you now get 10 for the same price
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:54.120]  i mean it's incredible in fact uh some of the supermarkets are having
[02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:58.120]  specials and they you get two for one
[02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:03.560]  and you you pay five dollars for this two boxes of cereal
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:06.920]  so that you'll come back when the special isn't on any longer
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:11.240]  and buy one for five dollars and so that's the way it's going
[02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:15.240]  they'll continue to do it uh every industry is doing it
[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:19.960]  and the government's lying about it and it's going to end up
[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:24.840]  in in very very bad situation
[02:36:25.160 --> 02:36:29.640]  kody in arizona you're on the air with bob Chapman go ahead kody
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:33.640]  hey guys i wanted to uh bring an article up i know
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:37.720]  probably read on this um depolitano secretly hosts
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:44.760]  terrorist organizations in dc and uh yes was put out by judicial watch
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:51.720]  back then um february 18th of 2010 and uh and it is
[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:55.480]  it said among them was the terrorist muslim brotherhood
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:58.440]  which is a sort of parent organization of humans
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:03.960]  and al-qaeda um then it also go on goes on to state that um
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:09.400]  the secret event was part of president obama's uh innovative program
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:14.520]  aimed at creating an information sharing network with muslim organizations
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:20.360]  even those known extremist ties and terrorist connections so
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:25.080]  i wanted to ask you if you guys both um could agree that there's a tie
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:29.640]  there's a hand a western hand and what's going on in egypt right now
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:33.560]  and we know it's all affecting our financial stability here
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:37.960]  as well as over there well i wish you'd asked me the question three weeks ago
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:40.440]  because that's what i've been talking about
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:43.400]  and uh not many people have come up with this
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:47.000]  uh take on what has happened in tunisia
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:52.120]  and uh in egypt and that is i think it was deliberately created because the
[02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:57.080]  groundwork was there in order to be a distraction for what was going on
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:01.000]  with the municipal crisis in the united states along with the fed
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:05.640]  financing uh the treasury debt and then also the problems in europe
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:09.080]  and they didn't mind letting me move our goal he
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:13.480]  stolen 70 billion dollars and he'll be their friend
[02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:18.040]  until he dies he's 82 years old so that's probably not very long
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:21.960]  and they wanted sullivan to take over and they didn't think that they were
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:26.680]  going to run into the problems that they did and so when they did it
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:30.840]  just through their problems they might say into the toilet
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:35.720]  and they don't know what they're going to do now
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:39.800]  uh in relation to who's going to run the country
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:44.680]  but i gotta tell you something uh the muslim brotherhood was formed
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:52.200]  in the 1920s and they were a very fascistic organization and still are
[02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:58.280]  and they sent two divisions of men to fight on the east and front
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:02.200]  with germany against the russians who were advancing
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:07.480]  toward germany and uh so uh that's their overall
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:12.440]  background plus their affiliation with hamas
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:19.160]  and the central intelligence agency has been very close to the muslim
[02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:23.400]  brotherhood and even financed him uh from time to time
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:27.240]  and so what are we going to get well if we get sullivan
[02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:31.080]  we'll get the same old thing back and they'll have another dictator
[02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:38.200]  if we get the muslim brotherhood then uh even if they only have a majority and
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:42.120]  have to have a coalition government you're gonna still have problems
[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:47.480]  and but the the bottom line is the u.s government
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:51.560]  in their actions as far as i can see in that area
[02:39:51.560 --> 02:39:55.720]  have been a big mistake they should have never taken that risk
[02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:59.160]  it was not worth it because anything can happen especially
[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:03.400]  when people are hungry living on two dollars a day i mean you people saw
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:06.280]  three four five million people on the streets i mean
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:13.800]  they were not going to go away and finally uh for american production
[02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:19.880]  uh the mubarak uh resigns in the middle of the night so he can be on
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:26.360]  daytime television in america but the military is taken over
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:31.080]  and under the circumstances at least temporarily it's probably the best thing
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:34.600]  to happen because sullivan is not controlling them
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:43.080]  and uh he was very deeply involved in the movement of so-called terrorists
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:47.560]  uh in the program that the cia had and they would send them to egypt and torture
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:51.400]  them there now he ran that program for the cia
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:55.000]  so you you can see better what you're dealing with here
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:58.760]  and so it's going to be a while perhaps a month or two
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:01.960]  before we find out what kind of government they're going to have but
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:06.760]  that's what i think happened and of course we had the
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:12.680]  u.s embassy document um where it's admitted that the cia knew that this
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:17.000]  plan to overthrow mubarak was in the works for 2011
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:22.680]  they received this information through their informants in december 2008 so
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:26.200]  basically they had two years to prepare for this
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:29.720]  and of course now that mubarak is out of there
[02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:34.840]  um you've got this elberardi character who is a complete front for george
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:39.880]  soros and a big new brisinski who is being touted as one of the
[02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:43.880]  presidential candidates to take power whenever they
[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:48.680]  stage an election and stage would probably be the appropriate word
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:52.520]  from what we've seen in afghanistan and iraq with these kind of elections
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:55.720]  which is of course not to say that the protesters don't have
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:41:59.880]  genuine grievances we talked about that earlier in the show with the food
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:05.080]  inflation but there's no doubt that this protest was hijacked
[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:09.240]  by nato by brisinski by soros and these kind of
[02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:13.160]  globalist parties to turn it to their own end and that's what they
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:15.960]  plan to do all along so we'll see what happens
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:20.200]  in the aftermath now that mubarak has announced his resignation today
[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:24.360]  zak in canada you're on the air with bob Chapman go ahead zak
[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:29.880]  hey how's it going guys good what's your question for bob Chapman today
[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:36.040]  actually got a question for you there poll uh you go ahead the bill c 36 and
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:39.320]  in canada here got passed in like december and the same week they passed

[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:32.120]  pennsylvania you're on the air with bob Chapman go ahead dwayne
[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:36.920]  hi paul hi bob i just wonder if i could read one sentence from the biography of
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:40.360]  oh and young and ask bob whether this scenario could
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:44.200]  take place in our day here it is says in 1919
[02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:48.040]  oh and d young at the request of the u.s government
[02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:51.880]  created the radio corporation of america to combat
[02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:56.120]  threatened foreign control of america's struggling radio industry
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:44:00.920]  do you think that could happen again in our day
[02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:03.960]  anything could happen from a corporate viewpoint
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:09.720]  and so many of these companies that do a great deal of business in america and
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:13.080]  elsewhere transnational corporations
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:18.760]  and so anything is possible and you you've just seen free trade and
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:23.400]  globalization create 8.5 million job losses
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:28.680]  and the loss of 42,400 businesses in the united states and it's
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:33.720]  continuing a pace and that kind of thing
[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:38.520]  that drawing together of companies in in monopolistic
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:43.400]  fashion is possible in every industry
[02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:46.760]  seems like they had a more of a protectionist type of
[02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:49.400]  attitude at that time where they wanted to nurture
[02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:52.520]  a growing american industry and today it seems to be just the opposite while
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:56.200]  they're encouraging offshore production
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:44:59.640]  and that's true and they will do it as long as we
[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:03.480]  allow them and i don't know how much help we're going to get from the house
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:06.600]  and senate because we just saw them extend the
[02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:10.280]  patriot act and these were supposedly the people who
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:14.360]  were going to go in and change that and they didn't do that
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:19.160]  and so where are we now we needed to throw more people out of office
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:23.000]  we think we were unable to accomplish that so
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:27.640]  that avenue at least for two more years is relatively closed for us
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:31.960]  and again we have to hold our breath and hope for the best
[02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:35.480]  situation cold rain yeah i mean we had
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:39.160]  what was it 26 republicans that voted against the
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:42.200]  patriot act measures being extended on tuesday and then
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:46.200]  last night 22 of them of course ron paul
[02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:51.720]  was consistent in voting against it 22 of these republicans most of which are
[02:45:51.720 --> 02:45:54.840]  tea party members who are supposed to be interested in
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:58.920]  protecting individual rights and limiting the the power of big government
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:02.040]  just flip their votes and voted for it and what
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:06.440]  what are these provisions it's about the lone wolf provision being able to
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:10.520]  conduct surveillance on americans with basically no oversight whatsoever you
[02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:14.280]  don't even need to prove that they've got any links to terrorism
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:18.040]  they just say they need to conduct the surveillance and it happens warrantless
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:22.520]  wiretapping uh chris in pennsylvania you're on the air with bob chatman go
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:26.200]  ahead hi bob hi paul i just wanted to um
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:30.120]  ask you first of all if you've seen the article i think i emailed it in but i
[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:33.640]  don't know if anyone saw it um because bob was just saying about how it's
[02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:36.360]  important you know to have something to be able to protect
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:38.520]  ourselves you know um and he's when he was talking
[02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:42.200]  about food um and there's there's a um from the
[02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:45.480]  catholic news service there's an article that says
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:50.040]  gun control church firmly quietly opposes firearms for civilian
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:53.560]  um civilian ownership and it goes in there and it talks about how
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:57.480]  now that the pope is telling people they need to turn their guns in
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:02.840]  and uh that it's evil to own guns and private gun ownership is um
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:06.200]  firearms and he says that firearms in the hands of civilians should be strictly
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:09.960]  limited and eventually completely eliminated um and i never really heard
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:12.600]  you guys cover that so i thought that was kind of interesting
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:16.040]  and also um i thought was interesting i wanted to ask you
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:20.440]  um like i've heard of this mine uh by stockings called
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:26.040]  Santa Fe uh gold and i wanted to kind of ask bob what was the benefit of owning
[02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:30.120]  the uh the gold bullion over buying the stock in the gold
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:33.880]  in the gold mine since it you know the company is growing and if gold is going
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:39.800]  to do so well um you know what would be the advantages of that
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:43.800]  well i don't know Santa Fe but i do know uh that
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:49.320]  uh historically uh the golden silver shares have done well
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:52.840]  during the 1930s they went up over 500 percent will go
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:56.920]  doubled and that was a deflationary depression
[02:47:56.920 --> 02:48:00.920]  uh during uh the inflationary
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:08.120]  recession between 1977 and 1981 the average golden silver share
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:13.960]  went up 40 times the advance of gold bullion so
[02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:20.440]  shares have performed very well historically uh i would say
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:24.840]  that they will perform as well if not better in the future
[02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:28.600]  uh that's a very very conservative statement um
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:32.760]  but you don't have the golden silver in your hand either
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:39.800]  and so i think people should do both and whatever is suitable for them
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:45.800]  and so that's the way i approach golden silver bullion and coins
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:50.120]  and shares together and everybody's different
[02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:53.160]  and lots of people write to me and i answer everybody
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:57.560]  and tell you what i think and i helped a lot of people
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:03.400]  again what was the first part of that question before that um actually i was
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:06.600]  i was telling you about i was just pointing out um
[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:10.520]  to paul that that i had sent in an article oh yes i i got it now the catholic
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:14.520]  church in guns yeah exactly and the pope wants
[02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:18.280]  the people to who are civilians to get rid of their guns
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:22.280]  exactly yeah that they're telling people that are you familiar with his
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:28.760]  background during the second world war yeah actually i am yeah well do you do
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:33.400]  do you want me to get into that or not i mean not i mean not really i i just
[02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:35.800]  kind of thought it was interesting that now all of a sudden
[02:49:35.800 --> 02:49:39.080]  we're hearing this you know you know you're always talking about gun control
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:42.520]  you know gun control gun control and here now that the catholic church with
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:45.880]  you know priests are now promulgating this message that uh
[02:49:45.880 --> 02:49:49.160]  you know owning guns is evil and that you shouldn't be doing this and then
[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:52.360]  you know and it's i think it's kind of interesting that that they're attacking
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:55.240]  it from that front also they're attacking it from the pulpit and they're
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:58.120]  telling you know they can if they can get people to think that it's evil that
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:00.440]  might be one other way they can get them out of out of
[02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:07.080]  i mean you know what that's what we don't down to is the fact 1939 and 1945
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:13.000]  yeah but also in the the FEMA recruitment program is training pastors to
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:16.680]  teach their flock to submit to government in the case of martial law
[02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:20.920]  we brought that story three or four years ago and it was since confirmed so
[02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:24.920]  they're actually recruiting these preachers to tell people to submit to
[02:50:24.920 --> 02:50:29.080]  government and of course that involves surrendering their firearms so
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:33.000]  no surprise that they would be telling them that thanks for the call
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:36.200]  we're going to come back to bob Chapman after the break for the final segment
[02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:40.040]  of the alex jones show we got joe in texas coming up

[02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:47.880]  yes paul great job and bob it's an honor uh i want to ask you about the uh
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:52.600]  we're retaining the silver since silver is used so much in the electronic field
[02:55:52.600 --> 02:55:57.240]  bob that uh i just wanted to inquire and see how long
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:00.840]  in your opinion bob can they keep as i'm invested in silver
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:06.280]  and how long can they keep uh manipulating this price like they are
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:10.520]  and uh you know i mean it's going to eventually will it eventually be
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:14.840]  affecting like the electronic industry and uh that's that's all i'll listen
[02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:19.160]  all fair thank you uh the electronics industry is going
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:23.160]  to uh suffer the same as the food industry is
[02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:28.360]  as the price of silver goes higher and as it goes higher they'll have to try to
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:32.600]  find other conductors that that will do the job maybe not as good
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:36.680]  but probably at a much less price whether that's possible or not i don't
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:41.160]  know uh each situation is different
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:47.640]  there is a lawsuit which has been consolidated class action
[02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:51.000]  there were seven of them uh one of them was um
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:57.480]  a regal lawsuit against j p m and hsbc for rigging the silver market uh i
[02:56:57.480 --> 02:57:02.520]  heard max keiser say with alex recently that uh
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:05.320]  andrew aguire who blew the whistle on these people
[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:09.000]  for what they were doing has more evidence to present
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:13.720]  and that uh this is going to put people in jail
[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:16.920]  and so i hope them to go maguire is well protected
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:21.160]  but once this happens the price of silver is going to break out
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:25.560]  and explode because of the enormous naked short position
[02:57:25.560 --> 02:57:29.880]  so you want to be in it you want to be in gold as well
[02:57:29.880 --> 02:57:36.840]  but silver probably in the short term uh could be very very explosive
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:42.040]  okay thanks for the call joe um slamming a quick one kary
