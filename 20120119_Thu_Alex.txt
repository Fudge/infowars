[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You've got it
[00:07.440 --> 00:09.440]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.400 --> 00:17.480]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:19.800 --> 00:24.680]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live. Thank you so much for joining us
[00:24.680 --> 00:31.040]  Big transmission lined up for you today. It is Thursday, January 19th, 2012
[00:31.960 --> 00:39.160]  First month of the year is getting long in the tooth long in the beard amazing the father of free software movement the
[00:40.680 --> 00:46.960]  Guru of it Richard Stallman Dr. Richard Stallman will be joining us coming up the start of the next hour
[00:47.880 --> 00:51.520]  We're also looking at some other guests today
[00:51.520 --> 00:59.840]  There is just so much going on so much happening this article has gone up at info wars calm
[01:00.080 --> 01:06.560]  We're all gonna hang together hang separate as Benjamin Franklin said Google is already using soap alike censorship
[01:06.800 --> 01:09.440]  It's just the mega corporations want this power themselves
[01:10.400 --> 01:16.600]  With government they don't want government having the express power and the way government was going to implement this would screw up some of
[01:16.600 --> 01:20.720]  The internet and was so ham-fisted this article is important. Please get that out
[01:20.720 --> 01:22.720]  We got a lot of good news coming up
[01:23.120 --> 01:30.080]  Rand Paul vows to block internet censorship bills sopa and Pippa are a threat to free speech. He says
[01:31.280 --> 01:35.920]  Congress claims they're pulling out the bad provisions down, but that's playing possum
[01:36.480 --> 01:40.400]  Let's see what they do next week with this vote and thank God for Rand Paul
[01:40.400 --> 01:50.160]  And thank God for Ron Paul as well. Here's another article at prisonplanet.com Ron Paul introduces legislation to strike in the AA's
[01:50.960 --> 01:58.560]  Unconstitutional police state subsections that allow secret arrest of citizens indefinite detention torture total war
[01:59.520 --> 02:05.680]  And it's a good thing in four wars calm and this indicated radio slash internet video feed is going to millions of people
[02:05.680 --> 02:13.040]  Because there's no news out there about Ron Paul doing this. There is almost no news out there
[02:13.920 --> 02:17.280]  About his speech. I saw the corporate trader dinosaur
[02:17.600 --> 02:19.600]  prostitute slime bag
[02:21.600 --> 02:23.600]  Make-up face teleprompter
[02:24.080 --> 02:25.600]  sell out
[02:25.600 --> 02:28.080]  Globalist zombie controlled media
[02:28.800 --> 02:30.800]  I gotta quit doing that. It's just it's fun
[02:30.800 --> 02:35.920]  Some of the names for that disease of traders and of scum and of plague
[02:36.560 --> 02:38.560]  That it's hard to stop
[02:38.560 --> 02:42.960]  That that oh he went and did his futile vote against a dead increase
[02:43.120 --> 02:49.360]  Yeah, futile futile ought at the Fed passed the house last year from no sponsors 10 years ago
[02:49.520 --> 02:57.520]  You know and people have exposed the Fed. Oh, it's futile Ron Paul. Oh, but never mentioning his real reason his main reason was to introduce
[02:57.520 --> 03:03.920]  Legislation to announce he's introducing and I guess today to begin the repeal of the constitution killing NDA
[03:05.040 --> 03:09.280]  And then we've got the really big news. I don't even know how to fathom this
[03:09.840 --> 03:16.560]  We knew there was fraud now. We knew Ron Paul clearly was in first place. It was he was just right behind the other two scallywags
[03:17.840 --> 03:19.840]  And now they're announcing in the news
[03:20.560 --> 03:24.160]  Finally, Iowa tally gives Santorum edge over Ron Paul
[03:24.160 --> 03:27.760]  Finally, Iowa tally gives Santorum edge over Romney
[03:28.480 --> 03:33.120]  No winner declared. So I guess let's have another gentleman's agreement to put Santorum
[03:33.280 --> 03:37.840]  Who's now in first like they put him in second and Carl rove admitted that we'll play that clip again
[03:38.560 --> 03:41.040]  Coming up and this is all over the news. The Des Moines Register
[03:41.840 --> 03:43.520]  mentions that well
[03:43.520 --> 03:45.520]  It's it's unresolved
[03:45.600 --> 03:49.920]  Register exclusive 2012 GOP caucuses count unresolved
[03:49.920 --> 03:51.920]  They're unresolved
[03:53.520 --> 03:59.680]  But that's okay because they're just going to give it to Santorum now and there's no mention
[04:00.400 --> 04:02.400]  of Ron Paul
[04:02.960 --> 04:04.160]  No
[04:04.160 --> 04:05.360]  mention
[04:05.360 --> 04:08.560]  Of Ron Paul this will make your head spin
[04:10.640 --> 04:15.200]  In fact, I'm here reading these articles. They never mention him and they'll even mention people like
[04:15.200 --> 04:19.600]  like Gennrich and Rick Perry and people who aren't even in the race now like Rick Perry
[04:21.120 --> 04:28.240]  But they don't mention Paul it's they're so scared. I mean, there's the evidence right there
[04:29.120 --> 04:32.880]  So that's all coming up today. And then when the broadcast is over, obviously
[04:33.120 --> 04:39.120]  We'll retransmit everything that was on the show today, but it all streamed at info wars.com and the free
[04:39.120 --> 04:45.200]  Podcasts it's up there, but if you're listening on a local AMR FM, that is the most important because that reaches giant audiences

[08:37.680 --> 08:44.680]  We are transmitting worldwide on AM and FM dial over 100 affiliates XM channel 166

[08:51.680 --> 08:59.680]  Video streams and we are going to be here for the next three hours at least today
[08:59.680 --> 09:09.680]  It is the 19th day of January 2012 and the quickening is obviously accelerating
[09:09.680 --> 09:14.680]  And I've got a trillion different thoughts racing through my mind
[09:14.680 --> 09:22.680]  I will attempt to control myself today I will attempt to not explode in rage and anger
[09:22.680 --> 09:28.680]  But also in exultation in the level of victories we're having against tyranny
[09:28.680 --> 09:34.680]  But also in disgust at the victories that the control freak criminal gangs are having as well
[09:34.680 --> 09:42.680]  It is the best of times it is the worst of times we have an unbelievable transmission lined up for you
[09:42.680 --> 09:50.680]  Richard Stallman free software guru of gurus will be joining us to talk about SOPA
[09:50.680 --> 09:55.680]  And a lot more coming up for 30 minutes in the second hour today
[09:55.680 --> 09:59.680]  Great job to the crew getting that set up
[09:59.680 --> 10:03.680]  I also want to say great job to all the listeners and all of our affiliates and sponsors
[10:03.680 --> 10:11.680]  We couldn't do this without you and it shows every day that there are a lot of good people in this country
[10:11.680 --> 10:18.680]  The majority of people want freedom and have courage that we could be on over 100 AM and FM stations
[10:18.680 --> 10:21.680]  I just learned that for over a month we've been on a big station in Albuquerque
[10:21.680 --> 10:25.680]  I just learned that for over two months we've been on another big station in Colorado
[10:25.680 --> 10:28.680]  Another big one in California and New York State and Florida
[10:28.680 --> 10:34.680]  I mean we're just exploding right now and getting in some areas number one
[10:34.680 --> 10:37.680]  In places like Orlando and other major cities
[10:37.680 --> 10:41.680]  That shows you that the truth is hitting on all cylinders
[10:41.680 --> 10:46.680]  And people are really ready to wake up and really ready to hear the truth
[10:46.680 --> 10:49.680]  That is so incredibly exciting
[10:49.680 --> 10:54.680]  And I will try to live up to the responsibility I've got here
[10:54.680 --> 10:59.680]  And I know a lot of people have jumped through a lot of hoops to get us on the radio locally in your area
[10:59.680 --> 11:08.680]  I know that a lot of people have done a lot to sponsor this broadcast and support us over the years
[11:08.680 --> 11:12.680]  And we owe it all to you, the listeners and supporters out there
[11:12.680 --> 11:17.680]  You're not behind this show, you are beside this show and in front of this show
[11:17.680 --> 11:21.680]  And all around this broadcast of awakening and understanding
[11:21.680 --> 11:26.680]  You are the key
[11:26.680 --> 11:30.680]  To all of this, if there's a weak link it is Alex Jones
[11:30.680 --> 11:33.680]  And I've got my positive points
[11:33.680 --> 11:36.680]  But I understand that I'm only human
[11:36.680 --> 11:42.680]  It is the wisdom of the crowd and of common sense America
[11:42.680 --> 11:47.680]  And people across the world that have verified and supported our information
[11:47.680 --> 11:50.680]  And helped get it out to countless millions
[11:50.680 --> 11:56.680]  You are the reason this broadcast and everything we do is strapped on top a giant rocket
[11:56.680 --> 12:00.680]  I mean we are having a huge effect, now I'm done ranting
[12:00.680 --> 12:04.680]  We have that big guest on SOPA coming up, we've got the latest on SOPA
[12:04.680 --> 12:11.680]  We've got unbelievable breaking Ron Paul election 2012 nose
[12:11.680 --> 12:16.680]  That is hiding in plain view and that no one is pointing out
[12:16.680 --> 12:22.680]  That no one is discussing out there, not even on the big Ron Paul sites
[12:22.680 --> 12:25.680]  And I don't blame them, this just broke in the last hour
[12:25.680 --> 12:32.680]  I was in here getting ready for the show and I'd heard some of it on the local news radio we had on in the background
[12:32.680 --> 12:36.680]  And on the TV, but it was Darren McBreen, our reporter that walked in
[12:36.680 --> 12:38.680]  And said, have you seen all these articles?
[12:38.680 --> 12:44.680]  And I read them and the spin all came together and it is so outrageous
[12:44.680 --> 12:49.680]  What they're doing, I'm going to tell you about that in a moment, but it's around Iowa
[12:49.680 --> 12:54.680]  Then we've got the economic news, Kodak files for bankruptcy protection
[12:54.680 --> 12:57.680]  U.S. losing high-tech manufacturing jobs to Asia
[12:57.680 --> 13:03.680]  We've lost more than a quarter under globalism in just the last few years, Washington Post
[13:03.680 --> 13:06.680]  This is like a success report card the globalists are putting out
[13:06.680 --> 13:15.680]  Obama shut down that pipeline that would supply more gasoline, more oil to the United States from Canada
[13:15.680 --> 13:21.680]  Of course it'll now just go east, or I guess west in that case to China
[13:21.680 --> 13:26.680]  So that they'll get that oil, they already get 80% of the oil that comes out of Alaska
[13:26.680 --> 13:30.680]  Our own government blocks it, vampire hedge funds are sucking grease dry
[13:30.680 --> 13:34.680]  Just amazing news on that front
[13:34.680 --> 13:38.680]  We've got some really good news from the Paul camp
[13:38.680 --> 13:44.680]  Ron Paul's introduced legislation to strike down NDAA's unconstitutional police state sections
[13:44.680 --> 13:48.680]  This got no attention anywhere
[13:48.680 --> 13:55.680]  The corporate media, the only attention they gave Ron Paul, because I know I was up all last night on Coast Coast AM
[13:55.680 --> 14:04.680]  The radio interviews this morning and I was tracking it, nothing in the news about Ron Paul going back to Washington
[14:04.680 --> 14:09.680]  When the other candidates wouldn't think about it and voting against the debt increase
[14:09.680 --> 14:13.680]  They reported on that and said it was symbolic and pointless and he's pathetic
[14:13.680 --> 14:21.680]  They didn't point all the other stuff he did like introduce legislation to repeal the secret police, secret arrest, total war
[14:21.680 --> 14:25.680]  With habeas corpus into the constitution NDAA
[14:25.680 --> 14:29.680]  Radio, TV, print, silence
[14:29.680 --> 14:35.680]  One guy happened to be watching the C-SPAN back there in the coffee room
[14:35.680 --> 14:40.680]  His name's Kurt Nemo and he wrote an article about it in the afternoon yesterday
[14:40.680 --> 14:46.680]  There was a few articles from the control left like Huffington Post today and I commend him for that
[14:46.680 --> 14:48.680]  But that's big news right there
[14:48.680 --> 14:53.680]  Ron Paul introduced this legislation to strike NDAA's unconstitutional section
[14:53.680 --> 14:55.680]  2021
[14:55.680 --> 14:59.680]  That allows the military to operate domestically, the black bag citizens
[14:59.680 --> 15:02.680]  And of course I think that should be more
[15:02.680 --> 15:08.680]  And of course he says he's introducing the bill that hadn't been introduced yet, before that's going to happen today or tomorrow
[15:08.680 --> 15:11.680]  But hopefully he'll have the other sections, he just mentioned his bill would have that
[15:11.680 --> 15:16.680]  To not say that the worldwide battlefield without congressional approval
[15:16.680 --> 15:18.680]  Forget a declaration, not even approval
[15:18.680 --> 15:22.680]  They can kill whoever they want, bomb whoever they want, invade whoever they want
[15:22.680 --> 15:25.680]  Because Obama is the new master of the universe
[15:25.680 --> 15:33.680]  So you've got all of that happening with almost zero media coverage
[15:33.680 --> 15:36.680]  Dinosaur, corporate, prostitute, prostitute media
[15:36.680 --> 15:43.680]  And we're going to be discussing that with really somebody you could call the father of the free software
[15:43.680 --> 15:46.680]  Free internet movement
[15:46.680 --> 15:49.680]  The Obi-Wan Kenobi of it, Richard Stallman
[15:49.680 --> 15:52.680]  Will be joining us coming up to talk about SOPA
[15:52.680 --> 15:55.680]  But something clicked for me last night
[15:55.680 --> 16:00.680]  While I was basically staying up all night, I did take an hour long cat nap
[16:00.680 --> 16:04.680]  That's why I'm so energized today, it's just amazing
[16:04.680 --> 16:09.680]  Google is already using SOPA-like censorship
[16:09.680 --> 16:14.680]  And I want to break this down later
[16:14.680 --> 16:17.680]  Google was set up with NSA and CIA money
[16:17.680 --> 16:20.680]  You can just type that into the NSA search engine Google
[16:20.680 --> 16:23.680]  And you'll get Washington Post, MIT Magazine
[16:23.680 --> 16:27.680]  But they're like how cute it is and how sweet CK it is
[16:27.680 --> 16:31.680]  And how much fun it is and it's no big deal
[16:31.680 --> 16:36.680]  Oh yeah, the heads of Google go to Bilderberg and on and on and on
[16:36.680 --> 16:41.680]  So why did Google black out its name on its website yesterday
[16:41.680 --> 16:44.680]  Which was just kind of ceremonial
[16:44.680 --> 16:48.680]  Without even linking any information to explain what was happening
[16:48.680 --> 16:52.680]  Like Reddit and Infowars.com and Wikipedia did
[16:52.680 --> 16:54.680]  Very effective at what Wikipedia did
[16:54.680 --> 16:56.680]  I don't realize how much I use Wikipedia
[16:56.680 --> 17:02.680]  Even though it's questionable sometimes because it is open source as you'd call it
[17:02.680 --> 17:06.680]  But overall it's pretty accurate, sometimes they put in there that I've died
[17:06.680 --> 17:09.680]  Or they put disinformation in there about other people
[17:09.680 --> 17:12.680]  But it gets corrected and they kind of spin things
[17:12.680 --> 17:15.680]  And don't really have any of our accomplishments on there
[17:15.680 --> 17:17.680]  And cover a bunch of gossip
[17:17.680 --> 17:20.680]  So overall it's distorted but the general info on it
[17:20.680 --> 17:23.680]  At least in the bibliographies is very useful
[17:23.680 --> 17:26.680]  And I realized with Wikipedia blacked out yesterday
[17:26.680 --> 17:28.680]  How much I use it
[17:28.680 --> 17:31.680]  Of course I did put in a 22 hour day yesterday
[17:31.680 --> 17:35.680]  But I probably, without even thinking, was directed there
[17:35.680 --> 17:38.680]  Or linked there more than 30 or 40 times
[17:38.680 --> 17:41.680]  I quit counting and it was blacked out
[17:41.680 --> 17:43.680]  And it was smart how they did it
[17:43.680 --> 17:46.680]  You'd see the info for about two seconds that you were looking for
[17:46.680 --> 17:48.680]  Of course I don't just believe what I read on there
[17:48.680 --> 17:51.680]  I then go check the bibliography and go to the links on the bottom
[17:51.680 --> 17:54.680]  But it is invaluable, it is the best encyclopedia out there
[17:54.680 --> 17:56.680]  And of course it's not 100% accurate
[17:56.680 --> 17:59.680]  About 95% accurate for my deep research
[17:59.680 --> 18:01.680]  That doesn't mean I'm completely accurate either
[18:01.680 --> 18:03.680]  But the point in, there's a lot of agendas there
[18:03.680 --> 18:07.680]  But you could see it for about three seconds or so
[18:07.680 --> 18:09.680]  And you'd start to read the info you wanted
[18:09.680 --> 18:11.680]  And then boom, it would cut to the black page
[18:11.680 --> 18:14.680]  And say, learn about internet censorship and this SOPA bill
[18:14.680 --> 18:17.680]  That will cripple freedom on the web as we know it
[18:17.680 --> 18:19.680]  Take political action
[18:19.680 --> 18:22.680]  And Reddit had an effective deal as well
[18:22.680 --> 18:25.680]  We just put a big banner at the top linking to some basic info about it
[18:25.680 --> 18:28.680]  That's because we've beat this dead horse over and over again
[18:28.680 --> 18:29.680]  We've done our job on this front
[18:29.680 --> 18:32.680]  We don't just do it on one day, we do it every day
[18:32.680 --> 18:36.680]  But everybody's missing the main enchilada here
[18:36.680 --> 18:37.680]  The main boat
[18:37.680 --> 18:38.680]  Why is Yahoo?
[18:38.680 --> 18:39.680]  Why is Google?
[18:39.680 --> 18:43.680]  Why are big globalist firms that are no new world order?
[18:43.680 --> 18:45.680]  Why are they against it?
[18:45.680 --> 18:48.680]  It's an internal fight in the system
[18:48.680 --> 18:52.680]  Because they don't want a government with ham-fisted people
[18:52.680 --> 18:54.680]  Having the power to shut down whatever they want
[18:54.680 --> 18:55.680]  Whenever they want
[18:55.680 --> 18:56.680]  And blacklist people
[18:56.680 --> 19:01.680]  Because Google's global, and basically for all its purposes
[19:01.680 --> 19:03.680]  Is a large part of the internet
[19:03.680 --> 19:06.680]  I mean, I'd call it several large organs of the internet
[19:06.680 --> 19:09.680]  I mean, you take those out, it would really have some issues
[19:09.680 --> 19:11.680]  And they're tenacled into everything
[19:11.680 --> 19:15.680]  This is an internal globalist separation of power
[19:15.680 --> 19:16.680]  Power struggle
[19:16.680 --> 19:19.680]  Something the founders said would hold back tyranny to a certain extent
[19:19.680 --> 19:22.680]  Because they're always battling with each other like two hyenas
[19:22.680 --> 19:24.680]  Over a baby gazelle they've already killed
[19:24.680 --> 19:26.680]  And one's got a leg, one's got the neck
[19:26.680 --> 19:27.680]  And they're kind of pulling it
[19:27.680 --> 19:29.680]  One of them runs in and grabs some guts
[19:29.680 --> 19:31.680]  And drags those off into the bushes
[19:31.680 --> 19:33.680]  Eyeballs are hanging out
[19:33.680 --> 19:35.680]  So later, and I'm going to break this down
[19:35.680 --> 19:38.680]  We're going to show you the total proof of Google
[19:38.680 --> 19:41.680]  Censoring and doing exactly what SOPA does
[19:41.680 --> 19:45.680]  Like gang busters on steroids
[19:45.680 --> 19:47.680]  That's all coming up today
[19:47.680 --> 19:49.680]  But first, the unbelievable
[19:49.680 --> 19:54.680]  Ron, Paul, censorship, election fraud
[19:54.680 --> 19:56.680]  Huge scandal going on right now
[19:56.680 --> 19:58.680]  That is getting almost no attention
[19:58.680 --> 19:59.680]  I mean, it's getting covered
[19:59.680 --> 20:00.680]  But they're not telling you what's happening
[20:00.680 --> 20:02.680]  Did you know that how well your brain works
[20:02.680 --> 20:04.680]  Is directly dependent upon how well your gut works?
[20:04.680 --> 20:07.680]  Did you know that an inflamed or compromised digestive system
[20:07.680 --> 20:10.680]  Directly contributes to poor focus, depression, irritability
[20:10.680 --> 20:12.680]  Attention deficit, and hyperactivity
[20:12.680 --> 20:15.680]  By eliminating the inflammation in your intestines
[20:15.680 --> 20:17.680]  And by having good bacteria populations
[20:17.680 --> 20:19.680]  You may enjoy better brain function
[20:19.680 --> 20:21.680]  The most important protein your body needs
[20:21.680 --> 20:23.680]  To keep inflammation down is glutathione
[20:23.680 --> 20:25.680]  The number one food to support
[20:25.680 --> 20:27.680]  A dramatic increase in glutathione production
[20:27.680 --> 20:30.680]  Is undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows
[20:30.680 --> 20:32.680]  Virtually all whey proteins are damaged
[20:32.680 --> 20:34.680]  By heat, filtration, and chemicals
[20:34.680 --> 20:35.680]  Except one
[20:35.680 --> 20:37.680]  One World Way is the most life-giving whey protein
[20:37.680 --> 20:38.680]  On the market
[20:38.680 --> 20:40.680]  It is changing the lives of its users
[20:40.680 --> 20:42.680]  In very positive ways
[20:42.680 --> 20:44.680]  One World Way may act as one of the most
[20:44.680 --> 20:46.680]  Important health foods to support
[20:46.680 --> 20:48.680]  In your child's optimal brain function

[21:21.680 --> 21:23.680]  By removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria

[22:29.680 --> 22:30.680]  Hi this is Ted Anderson
[22:30.680 --> 22:32.680]  Have you ever wondered why bank stock
[22:32.680 --> 22:34.680]  Workers investment advisors won't talk about
[22:34.680 --> 22:35.680]  Gold IRAs?
[22:35.680 --> 22:37.680]  They've been available since 1986
[22:37.680 --> 22:39.680]  Yet the financial industry won't recognize
[22:39.680 --> 22:41.680]  The value of gold for your retirement
[22:41.680 --> 22:43.680]  Gold is outperformed paper investments
[22:43.680 --> 22:45.680]  Yet no word about IRAs
[22:45.680 --> 22:47.680]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement
[22:47.680 --> 22:49.680]  Call 800-686-2237
[22:49.680 --> 22:51.680]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation
[22:51.680 --> 22:52.680]  In low returns
[22:52.680 --> 22:55.680]  Call 800-686-2237
[22:55.680 --> 22:57.680]  Secure your future and call
[22:57.680 --> 23:02.680]  800-686-2237
[23:02.680 --> 23:04.680]  That's what it sounds like
[23:04.680 --> 23:06.680]  When a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house
[23:06.680 --> 23:08.680]  That looks like no one is home
[23:08.680 --> 23:10.680]  Don't let your home be the next target
[23:10.680 --> 23:12.680]  Make it look like someone is home watching television
[23:12.680 --> 23:13.680]  With fake TV
[23:13.680 --> 23:15.680]  Fake TV is a small electronic device
[23:15.680 --> 23:18.680]  That makes the same light as a real television
[23:18.680 --> 23:21.680]  So from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV
[23:21.680 --> 23:23.680]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer
[23:23.680 --> 23:25.680]  But is far more convincing to burglars
[23:25.680 --> 23:28.680]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm
[23:28.680 --> 23:31.680]  And is highly recommended by numerous police departments
[23:31.680 --> 23:33.680]  Use it anytime you're away from home
[23:33.680 --> 23:36.680]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95
[23:36.680 --> 23:38.680]  Go to www.fakeTV.com
[23:38.680 --> 23:41.680]  Or call 1-877-5 FAKE TV
[23:41.680 --> 23:43.680]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95
[23:43.680 --> 23:45.680]  So get one for you and one for a loved one
[23:45.680 --> 23:48.680]  For safety, security and peace of mind for both of you
[23:48.680 --> 23:52.680]  Call 877-5 F-A-K-E-T-V
[23:52.680 --> 23:54.680]  Or go to www.fakeTV.com
[23:54.680 --> 23:56.680]  www.fakeTV.com
[23:56.680 --> 24:25.680]  The burglar deterrent
[24:25.680 --> 24:28.680]  Watch people's hands up, roll
[24:28.680 --> 24:30.680]  Roll
[24:30.680 --> 24:32.680]  Roll
[24:32.680 --> 24:34.680]  Roll
[24:34.680 --> 24:36.680]  I know you're listening today
[24:36.680 --> 24:38.680]  I want to say hi, sorry, I'm butchering your great music
[24:38.680 --> 24:40.680]  LOL
[24:40.680 --> 24:44.680]  Just like the Pied Piper
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.680]  You know, if you look at the whole Gennrich thing
[24:49.680 --> 24:52.680]  That Drudge broke before ABC News
[24:52.680 --> 24:56.680]  Even announced that they were going to air the interview this evening
[24:56.680 --> 25:01.680]  You've got the ex-wife who she had cancer
[25:01.680 --> 25:03.680]  And he came to her in Divorster
[25:03.680 --> 25:06.680]  And then he told one of his top aides, reportedly
[25:06.680 --> 25:08.680]  This has been out for years, but now she's speaking out
[25:08.680 --> 25:11.680]  Well, she's not good looking, she's old, she's got cancer
[25:11.680 --> 25:15.680]  I need a young, good looking wife to get elected
[25:15.680 --> 25:18.680]  I mean, even if you and your wife are getting along
[25:18.680 --> 25:21.680]  When they've got cancer or whatever, you take care of them
[25:21.680 --> 25:24.680]  And it just shows, this is a demon
[25:24.680 --> 25:26.680]  This is a demon
[25:26.680 --> 25:28.680]  And then he's got this new wife
[25:28.680 --> 25:31.680]  And she buys like a half million dollars with a jewelry every few months
[25:31.680 --> 25:35.680]  I mean, it's just, and he writes books about being frugal
[25:35.680 --> 25:36.680]  That's the thing
[25:36.680 --> 25:39.680]  You want to buy a half million dollars worth of jewelry every few months
[25:39.680 --> 25:41.680]  For your wife to keep her happy
[25:41.680 --> 25:44.680]  Because it's all this lobbyist money you got selling America out
[25:44.680 --> 25:45.680]  Well, that's one thing, Trader
[25:45.680 --> 25:49.680]  But to write books about it being frugal and all this garbage
[25:49.680 --> 25:53.680]  When you're a little pimp who likes glitterbug stuff
[25:53.680 --> 25:55.680]  And most of these globalists, that's how they are
[25:55.680 --> 25:57.680]  They're into just petty junk
[25:57.680 --> 26:01.680]  These are such empty little chicken neck jellyfish
[26:01.680 --> 26:04.680]  And again, I'm not saying things are bad
[26:04.680 --> 26:08.680]  Comfort, security, you know, being able to travel
[26:08.680 --> 26:10.680]  Certainly
[26:10.680 --> 26:13.680]  Access to good medical care
[26:13.680 --> 26:16.680]  But it's always, so many of the new voracious and others
[26:16.680 --> 26:19.680]  Into the bobbles and they worship the bobbles
[26:19.680 --> 26:24.680]  And it just shows how empty these people will sell their souls
[26:24.680 --> 26:26.680]  They'll just fall down for money
[26:26.680 --> 26:31.680]  Just fall over themselves to climb the globalist ladder
[26:31.680 --> 26:33.680]  Okay
[26:33.680 --> 26:36.680]  Coming up, Ron Paul introduced legislation to strike NDAAs
[26:36.680 --> 26:38.680]  Police state provisions, huge news
[26:38.680 --> 26:41.680]  The latest on SOPA, in deep trouble
[26:41.680 --> 26:44.680]  Rand Paul vows to block internet censorship bills
[26:44.680 --> 26:46.680]  Big economic news
[26:46.680 --> 26:47.680]  That's all coming up
[26:47.680 --> 26:49.680]  And of course, in the next hour
[26:49.680 --> 26:52.680]  The father of the free software movement
[26:52.680 --> 26:54.680]  Is going to be joining us to get into SOPA
[26:54.680 --> 26:56.680]  And a lot more
[26:56.680 --> 26:59.680]  But right now, let me start getting into this
[26:59.680 --> 27:01.680]  This is so big
[27:01.680 --> 27:04.680]  That when I learned this this morning
[27:04.680 --> 27:05.680]  I had Kurt Nemo in here
[27:05.680 --> 27:07.680]  And I was talking to him about writing an article
[27:07.680 --> 27:11.680]  And we were almost flummoxed by how insane it is
[27:11.680 --> 27:13.680]  How big it is
[27:13.680 --> 27:16.680]  And how it's just being reported like they're talking about
[27:16.680 --> 27:19.680]  The price of a canned ham at Safeway
[27:19.680 --> 27:21.680]  I mean, it's like they're just mumbling
[27:21.680 --> 27:23.680]  Oh yeah, and you can get some tires for this
[27:23.680 --> 27:25.680]  Or how the weather was this
[27:25.680 --> 27:27.680]  And kind of hot and balmy
[27:27.680 --> 27:30.680]  Because I'm listening to local Fox News on local radio
[27:30.680 --> 27:31.680]  I'm watching TV
[27:31.680 --> 27:33.680]  I've got stacks of the news
[27:33.680 --> 27:35.680]  And something's missing in this news
[27:35.680 --> 27:37.680]  I'm about to cover
[27:37.680 --> 27:39.680]  The name
[27:39.680 --> 27:42.680]  Ron Paul
[27:42.680 --> 27:44.680]  And it was hiding in plain view
[27:44.680 --> 27:45.680]  That's why I get angry
[27:45.680 --> 27:47.680]  I'm in here listening to this watching this going
[27:47.680 --> 27:49.680]  Okay, Rick Perry's dropped out
[27:49.680 --> 27:52.680]  Okay, he's endorsing the globalist
[27:52.680 --> 27:55.680]  Mr. Carbon Tax again, Rich
[27:55.680 --> 27:57.680]  Mr. New World Order
[27:57.680 --> 28:01.680]  Okay, they're now saying Santorum won Iowa
[28:01.680 --> 28:03.680]  And Iowa's the big news, folks
[28:03.680 --> 28:07.680]  Santorum won Iowa
[28:07.680 --> 28:10.680]  But they're saying the results can't be used
[28:10.680 --> 28:12.680]  There were so many problems
[28:12.680 --> 28:14.680]  And trucks lost full of the ballots
[28:14.680 --> 28:16.680]  The ballots are called in, folks
[28:16.680 --> 28:18.680]  And there was a gentleman agreement to give
[28:18.680 --> 28:21.680]  Santorum more votes two weeks ago
[28:21.680 --> 28:22.680]  When all this happened
[28:22.680 --> 28:24.680]  I mean, remember all that stuff we covered?
[28:24.680 --> 28:26.680]  So we knew there was fraud then
[28:26.680 --> 28:29.680]  I told you two weeks ago
[28:29.680 --> 28:32.680]  I told you it was going to be fraud days before
[28:32.680 --> 28:34.680]  And we had Wayne Paul on
[28:34.680 --> 28:35.680]  Ron Paul's brother
[28:35.680 --> 28:36.680]  In fact, let's get Wayne Paul back on
[28:36.680 --> 28:38.680]  The last 30 months today if he can do it
[28:38.680 --> 28:39.680]  Or if not tomorrow or Sunday
[28:39.680 --> 28:42.680]  I want to get his take on this
[28:42.680 --> 28:44.680]  And then Wayne sent some stuff to the campaign
[28:44.680 --> 28:46.680]  And they said, oh, no, we don't see any evidence
[28:46.680 --> 28:48.680]  Of fraud in Iowa, you know, a day and a half out
[28:48.680 --> 28:49.680]  We'll see what happens
[28:49.680 --> 28:51.680]  Because they want to take the high road
[28:51.680 --> 28:54.680]  Because the media will make them look like sore losers
[28:54.680 --> 28:56.680]  And I'm not beating around the bush here
[28:56.680 --> 28:58.680]  I'm letting you know how our thought processes work
[28:58.680 --> 29:00.680]  Because it's important to understand how
[29:00.680 --> 29:03.680]  Even the Info Wars operation doesn't see things
[29:03.680 --> 29:07.680]  That are so naked, that are so in plain view
[29:07.680 --> 29:09.680]  But simply put
[29:09.680 --> 29:11.680]  Nemo's got an article coming out very soon
[29:11.680 --> 29:12.680]  InfoWars.com
[29:12.680 --> 29:14.680]  And nobody else is reporting this
[29:14.680 --> 29:16.680]  What I'm about to tell you
[29:16.680 --> 29:21.680]  That they're saying Iowa results can't be trusted
[29:21.680 --> 29:22.680]  They're up in the air
[29:22.680 --> 29:24.680]  In the news there is reporting
[29:24.680 --> 29:26.680]  Final Iowa Tally gives Santorum edge over Romney
[29:26.680 --> 29:28.680]  No winner declared
[29:28.680 --> 29:30.680]  Because results from eight of the states
[29:30.680 --> 29:33.680]  Nearly 1,800 precincts are missing
[29:33.680 --> 29:35.680]  Now we told you this the day it happened
[29:35.680 --> 29:37.680]  The night after and we were coaxed for saying it
[29:37.680 --> 29:39.680]  But in here, they're still saying
[29:39.680 --> 29:41.680]  We'll just give it to Santorum
[29:41.680 --> 29:43.680]  And there's no discussion of Ron Paul
[29:43.680 --> 29:45.680]  Getting any delegates
[29:45.680 --> 29:46.680]  I mean, this is big
[29:46.680 --> 29:49.680]  They may try to steal his Iowa delegates
[29:49.680 --> 29:51.680]  We're on the march
[29:51.680 --> 29:53.680]  The Empire's on the run
[29:53.680 --> 29:56.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[30:01.680 --> 30:02.680]  You've heard Alex explain
[30:02.680 --> 30:04.680]  How the Silver Lungs Generator
[30:04.680 --> 30:06.680]  Infuses the respiratory system

[30:18.680 --> 30:21.680]  And I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator

[30:26.680 --> 30:28.680]  It also comes equipped with the proper

[32:04.680 --> 32:07.680]  Is on the road
[32:07.680 --> 32:09.680]  But if the unfortunate happens
[32:09.680 --> 32:12.680]  You'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets
[32:12.680 --> 32:16.680]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[32:16.680 --> 32:21.680]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[32:21.680 --> 32:25.680]  They so pride in every stitch
[32:25.680 --> 32:29.680]  Guarantee you love the way they fit
[32:29.680 --> 32:32.680]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[32:32.680 --> 32:34.680]  Where you need it most
[32:34.680 --> 32:37.680]  Blue diamond gussets got it
[32:37.680 --> 32:39.680]  Others don't
[32:39.680 --> 32:41.680]  We turned jeans inside out
[32:41.680 --> 32:43.680]  Diamond gusset jeans
[32:43.680 --> 32:46.680]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality
[32:46.680 --> 32:48.680]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine
[32:48.680 --> 32:50.680]  Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[32:50.680 --> 32:52.680]  So you can ride all day with confidence
[32:52.680 --> 32:55.680]  Order yours at gusset.com
[32:55.680 --> 32:57.680]  Diamond gusset jeans got it
[32:57.680 --> 33:24.680]  Others don't
[33:27.680 --> 33:36.680]  Okay, so here we are
[33:36.680 --> 33:40.680]  And we told everybody up front
[33:40.680 --> 33:43.680]  That there was clear evidence of missing
[33:43.680 --> 33:45.680]  Ballots in Iowa
[33:45.680 --> 33:47.680]  And I mean, everybody said
[33:47.680 --> 33:49.680]  If Ron Paul is going to get a fair shake anywhere
[33:49.680 --> 33:50.680]  It's going to be Iowa
[33:50.680 --> 33:54.680]  Because you've got the 1,800 precincts
[33:54.680 --> 33:56.680]  Everybody raises their hand
[33:56.680 --> 33:59.680]  You publicly count them up in front of everybody
[33:59.680 --> 34:01.680]  And then a phone call is made
[34:01.680 --> 34:03.680]  To the central counting office
[34:03.680 --> 34:05.680]  And then those numbers are all published
[34:05.680 --> 34:07.680]  And it's all transparent
[34:07.680 --> 34:10.680]  Instead, in some areas, they counted them in secret
[34:10.680 --> 34:12.680]  They would call in the numbers
[34:12.680 --> 34:14.680]  But then later say, oh, we didn't get the call
[34:14.680 --> 34:17.680]  Drive them to this location
[34:17.680 --> 34:20.680]  And then people would just disappear
[34:20.680 --> 34:24.680]  Or they wouldn't be called in
[34:24.680 --> 34:29.680]  All of this went on
[34:29.680 --> 34:34.680]  So we then found the clip on Fox News
[34:34.680 --> 34:40.680]  Of the guy who was the architect
[34:40.680 --> 34:43.680]  Of so much of the election manipulation in 2000
[34:43.680 --> 34:44.680]  You can't deny that
[34:44.680 --> 34:46.680]  It's not that I'm for Al Gore either
[34:46.680 --> 34:49.680]  It's like two choices of the same poison
[34:49.680 --> 34:53.680]  But Carl Rove is clearly a scamster
[34:53.680 --> 34:54.680]  He's been caught many times
[34:54.680 --> 34:57.680]  Doing different types of dirty deeds
[34:57.680 --> 34:59.680]  Done dirt sheet
[34:59.680 --> 35:01.680]  And he comes out on Fox News and says
[35:01.680 --> 35:03.680]  Well, there were some precincts that came up missing
[35:03.680 --> 35:06.680]  So they just got in a room together as gentlemen
[35:06.680 --> 35:09.680]  And decided to give Santorum more points
[35:09.680 --> 35:11.680]  To put him in the second place, basically
[35:11.680 --> 35:15.680]  Well, now, weeks later
[35:15.680 --> 35:17.680]  They just come out like it's no big deal
[35:17.680 --> 35:19.680]  And say, the results are in question
[35:19.680 --> 35:21.680]  We don't know what we're going to do
[35:21.680 --> 35:24.680]  More delegates will probably go to Santorum now
[35:24.680 --> 35:26.680]  And the rest to Mitt Romney
[35:26.680 --> 35:30.680]  It looks like that Santorum really won
[35:30.680 --> 35:32.680]  But it's all in question, but he won
[35:32.680 --> 35:38.680]  And then no discussion in over a dozen news articles
[35:38.680 --> 35:40.680]  National and local about it
[35:40.680 --> 35:41.680]  Ron Paul's not mentioned
[35:41.680 --> 35:43.680]  And I was shown an article a couple days ago
[35:43.680 --> 35:45.680]  By Rob Dew here who runs the Nightly News
[35:45.680 --> 35:47.680]  It was the LA Times admitting that
[35:47.680 --> 35:49.680]  They made the decision six months ago
[35:49.680 --> 35:53.680]  To not mention Ron Paul and to act like he can't win
[35:53.680 --> 35:56.680]  Because they've decided he is in a real candidate
[35:56.680 --> 35:58.680]  They have decided
[35:58.680 --> 36:00.680]  And he's in second place in most states
[36:00.680 --> 36:03.680]  He's the only guy that's a constitutionalist
[36:03.680 --> 36:06.680]  In polls, he's the best against Obama
[36:06.680 --> 36:08.680]  But they have decided to give him
[36:08.680 --> 36:10.680]  89 seconds in one debate
[36:10.680 --> 36:13.680]  The CBS debate or to kick him out of another debate
[36:13.680 --> 36:15.680]  Or when they talk about him to only be negative
[36:15.680 --> 36:18.680]  There is the arrogance of these people
[36:18.680 --> 36:21.680]  And this is big, big, big news
[36:21.680 --> 36:26.680]  Finally, Iowa Tally gives Santorum edge over Romney
[36:26.680 --> 36:29.680]  No winner declared, News 14
[36:32.680 --> 36:35.680]  The final results of the Iowa caucuses are in
[36:35.680 --> 36:38.680]  And there's a chance and a change at the top
[36:38.680 --> 36:41.680]  Rick Santorum, Edge, meant Romney by 34 votes
[36:41.680 --> 36:44.680]  Romney had been considered the winner
[36:44.680 --> 36:47.680]  After initial tallies gave him an 8-vote advantage
[36:47.680 --> 36:50.680]  Despite the surprise flip, Iowa's Republican party
[36:50.680 --> 36:52.680]  Is not naming an official winner
[36:52.680 --> 36:54.680]  Because results from eight of the states
[36:54.680 --> 36:57.680]  Nearly 1,800 precincts are missing
[36:57.680 --> 37:00.680]  The college towns, the Ron Paul supporter areas
[37:00.680 --> 37:02.680]  Eames and other areas
[37:02.680 --> 37:05.680]  GOP or Ames, excuse me
[37:05.680 --> 37:09.680]  GOP Chairman Matt Strong
[37:09.680 --> 37:15.680]  Says he's congratulating both Santorum and Romney
[37:15.680 --> 37:19.680]  The day after the Iowa caucuses
[37:19.680 --> 37:22.680]  Strong describes it as the closest contest
[37:22.680 --> 37:24.680]  In caucus history
[37:24.680 --> 37:29.680]  Now, there's no mention here of Ron Paul
[37:29.680 --> 37:35.680]  The article goes on
[37:35.680 --> 37:39.680]  For page after page, I have the news articles here
[37:39.680 --> 37:43.680]  And there's no mention of Ron Paul
[37:43.680 --> 37:46.680]  Because they're lying by omission
[37:46.680 --> 37:48.680]  Here's another one
[37:48.680 --> 37:50.680]  A register exclusive
[37:50.680 --> 37:53.680]  2012 GOP caucus count unresolved
[37:53.680 --> 37:55.680]  Des Moines Register
[37:55.680 --> 37:57.680]  And look at this, if you go pull this article up
[37:57.680 --> 38:00.680]  If you're watching us on prisonplanet.tv right now
[38:00.680 --> 38:03.680]  Look at it
[38:03.680 --> 38:05.680]  It has the results
[38:05.680 --> 38:08.680]  And it mentions no one
[38:08.680 --> 38:12.680]  But Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney
[38:12.680 --> 38:15.680]  Gee, we'd like to know what happened with Ron Paul
[38:15.680 --> 38:17.680]  There was just a few points behind
[38:17.680 --> 38:19.680]  We'd like to at least hear about him
[38:19.680 --> 38:22.680]  There is no telling what they are doing here
[38:22.680 --> 38:24.680]  Here's another one
[38:24.680 --> 38:26.680]  Final Iowa tally gives Santorum edge over Romney
[38:26.680 --> 38:29.680]  Because of missing votes, no winner declared
[38:29.680 --> 38:32.680]  The votes remain missing two weeks after events
[38:32.680 --> 38:36.680]  So you've got the college towns missing
[38:36.680 --> 38:38.680]  The places where Ron Paul was polling
[38:38.680 --> 38:41.680]  In giant double digits that would have pushed him over
[38:41.680 --> 38:44.680]  Sorry, some of the most populated areas
[38:44.680 --> 38:47.680]  Where Ron Paul was dominating
[38:47.680 --> 38:49.680]  Like Ames
[38:49.680 --> 38:52.680]  Gone, gone, gone
[38:52.680 --> 38:56.680]  And Carl Rove says, well, you know, they all met behind closed doors
[38:56.680 --> 38:58.680]  Some of the election officials, he won't mention who
[38:58.680 --> 39:00.680]  And they met with Santorum and Romney
[39:00.680 --> 39:02.680]  And they made a gentleman's agreement
[39:02.680 --> 39:05.680]  I'm glad that they knew these votes were missing
[39:05.680 --> 39:07.680]  At like five o'clock at night
[39:07.680 --> 39:10.680]  And they just said, well, there was a gentleman's agreement
[39:10.680 --> 39:13.680]  That's the way it is
[39:13.680 --> 39:16.680]  So that's the new America
[39:16.680 --> 39:18.680]  Here's another one
[39:18.680 --> 39:21.680]  Breaking Perry obviously drops out of presidential race
[39:21.680 --> 39:24.680]  Indorses Newdy Gennrich
[39:24.680 --> 39:27.680]  And guess who else endorsed Newdy Gennrich?
[39:27.680 --> 39:30.680]  Sarah Palin
[39:30.680 --> 39:33.680]  If you ever wanted to know about cutesy
[39:33.680 --> 39:37.680]  Little miss cutesy, little miss beauty queen
[39:37.680 --> 39:39.680]  If you ever wanted to know what she's doing
[39:39.680 --> 39:43.680]  When she's not chasing professional athletes around
[39:43.680 --> 39:48.680]  If you ever wanted to know what she's up to
[39:48.680 --> 39:50.680]  Well, you now know
[39:50.680 --> 39:54.680]  Endorsing a guy who's known to leave his wife while she's fighting cancer
[39:54.680 --> 39:59.680]  And to brag about hell, well, I gotta have me a hot cutie to get elected
[39:59.680 --> 40:02.680]  Just cold blooded snake
[40:02.680 --> 40:04.680]  Right out of the pit of hell
[40:04.680 --> 40:08.680]  Who supports carbon taxes, open borders, socialist healthcare
[40:08.680 --> 40:10.680]  Gun control in the past
[40:10.680 --> 40:12.680]  Abortion, all of it
[40:12.680 --> 40:13.680]  And don't send me emails
[40:13.680 --> 40:15.680]  Well, he doesn't support that stuff now
[40:15.680 --> 40:17.680]  Well, yeah, because he's lying to you
[40:17.680 --> 40:19.680]  I mean, I can play Eclipse all day
[40:19.680 --> 40:21.680]  Mitt Romney, how great abortion is
[40:21.680 --> 40:24.680]  But now he's telling you how horrible it is
[40:24.680 --> 40:26.680]  They'll lie to you
[40:26.680 --> 40:28.680]  And if you turn your back on them, they'll stick a knife in you
[40:28.680 --> 40:32.680]  In fact, they'll stick a knife in you and tell you they're giving you a rose
[40:32.680 --> 40:35.680]  And now it's coming out
[40:35.680 --> 40:39.680]  And again, Rich was exposed yesterday on the Drudge Report who broke that ABC News
[40:39.680 --> 40:41.680]  Was having an internal debate over airing it
[40:41.680 --> 40:44.680]  But it decided to air it on the eve
[40:44.680 --> 40:47.680]  Just a few days before the South Carolina
[40:47.680 --> 40:50.680]  Prime airing
[40:50.680 --> 40:53.680]  And now ABC, after being scooped to their own story
[40:53.680 --> 40:56.680]  Has come out
[40:56.680 --> 40:59.680]  And confirmed what Drudge is reporting
[40:59.680 --> 41:03.680]  And that is, well, you can read the quotes
[41:03.680 --> 41:07.680]  There was a civil war inside the network over it
[41:07.680 --> 41:10.680]  And now that's been confirmed by ABC
[41:10.680 --> 41:14.680]  And she's gonna come out and talk about how he said, look, I'm leaving you
[41:14.680 --> 41:17.680]  You're not good looking, you got cancer
[41:17.680 --> 41:19.680]  I need me a young trophy
[41:19.680 --> 41:23.680]  And they've got reportedly prominent aides and others saying, yeah
[41:23.680 --> 41:24.680]  He just was cold-blooded
[41:24.680 --> 41:25.680]  They're like, why are you leaving your wife?
[41:25.680 --> 41:26.680]  That won't be good political
[41:26.680 --> 41:29.680]  And he's like, look, I need me a pretty young thing
[41:29.680 --> 41:30.680]  For the voters
[41:30.680 --> 41:34.680]  And you know what, a lot of the voters are shallow enough and evil enough
[41:34.680 --> 41:36.680]  That, I mean, there's nothing better
[41:36.680 --> 41:39.680]  And I'm not here judging people that have divorces or whatever
[41:39.680 --> 41:41.680]  But it's the way Genrich did it
[41:41.680 --> 41:45.680]  Then to see Ron Paul up there with his cute old wife
[41:45.680 --> 41:47.680]  Grandma bake you the cookies
[41:47.680 --> 41:48.680]  She's had heart problems and stuff
[41:48.680 --> 41:50.680]  Follows him around on the campaign trail
[41:50.680 --> 41:53.680]  Sticking with his lady for over 50 years
[41:53.680 --> 41:54.680]  And all his children
[41:54.680 --> 41:56.680]  That's a life well-led
[41:56.680 --> 41:58.680]  That's a good thing
[41:58.680 --> 42:00.680]  You say what you want about Mitt Romney
[42:00.680 --> 42:02.680]  At least he's got the same wife and kids
[42:02.680 --> 42:05.680]  Newt Genrich, I mean, if you can't stay with your wife
[42:05.680 --> 42:06.680]  That's one thing
[42:06.680 --> 42:08.680]  But if you're running around from wife to wife to wife
[42:08.680 --> 42:13.680]  And your ex-wives hate you enough to go on TV and talk about you
[42:13.680 --> 42:15.680]  You're a nasty person
[42:15.680 --> 42:18.680]  But again, that's not why I'd vote against Genrich
[42:18.680 --> 42:20.680]  That's bad enough
[42:20.680 --> 42:23.680]  It shows the type of person he is
[42:23.680 --> 42:27.680]  The issue here is that he's a globalist
[42:27.680 --> 42:29.680]  I've read you his quotes
[42:29.680 --> 42:31.680]  Where he calls for putting microchips in people
[42:31.680 --> 42:32.680]  Don't believe me
[42:32.680 --> 42:33.680]  Just type in Newt Genrich
[42:33.680 --> 42:35.680]  Calls for putting microchips in population
[42:35.680 --> 42:38.680]  He wrote stinking articles about it 20 years ago
[42:38.680 --> 42:40.680]  He calls for the end of the family
[42:40.680 --> 42:41.680]  He calls for global government
[42:41.680 --> 42:43.680]  I mean, there's a reason the New World Order
[42:43.680 --> 42:46.680]  Picked him out of a nowhere university
[42:46.680 --> 42:47.680]  And put him where he is
[42:47.680 --> 42:49.680]  Because he's a nasty little globalist
[42:49.680 --> 42:52.680]  Part of this Luciferian Futurist society
[42:52.680 --> 42:56.680]  If you don't believe me, just go look it up
[42:56.680 --> 42:58.680]  Tell you, he's a nasty one
[42:58.680 --> 43:03.680]  He is a nasty, nasty, nasty little creature
[43:03.680 --> 43:05.680]  Alright, I'm done talking about Newt Genrich
[43:05.680 --> 43:09.680]  Now, Mitt Romney may not leave wives who've got cancer
[43:09.680 --> 43:11.680]  And get him a new hot young thing
[43:11.680 --> 43:17.680]  But Mitt Romney is for carbon taxes, abortion, gun control, open borders
[43:17.680 --> 43:20.680]  I'm talking about his voting record, not his rhetoric
[43:20.680 --> 43:25.680]  And you conservatives out there that want to vote for the pretty boy
[43:25.680 --> 43:27.680]  You did the same thing with Obama
[43:27.680 --> 43:30.680]  Sharp, slick, well-spoken, reading off the teleprompter
[43:30.680 --> 43:31.680]  Like Mitt Romney
[43:31.680 --> 43:34.680]  You vote for these kindles
[43:34.680 --> 43:37.680]  The only difference is
[43:37.680 --> 43:39.680]  What $3,000 suit they're wearing
[43:39.680 --> 43:41.680]  And what color tie
[43:41.680 --> 43:45.680]  And what is before their name, R or D
[43:45.680 --> 43:46.680]  That's why the system is totally
[43:46.680 --> 43:48.680]  I mean, there was an article yesterday
[43:48.680 --> 43:50.680]  Where, in fact, I just pulled this up
[43:50.680 --> 43:53.680]  One of the new top officials
[43:53.680 --> 43:56.680]  In the Obama administration
[43:56.680 --> 43:59.680]  Is the other former head of Bain Capital
[43:59.680 --> 44:01.680]  Started and set up and run
[44:01.680 --> 44:03.680]  And he still owns a big part of it by Mitt Romney
[44:03.680 --> 44:05.680]  It's come out today that he's got
[44:05.680 --> 44:08.680]  That he pays 15% tax on average
[44:08.680 --> 44:12.680]  When blue collar workers pay more than that
[44:12.680 --> 44:13.680]  People are like, what do you mean?
[44:13.680 --> 44:16.680]  They tell me people are making, you know
[44:16.680 --> 44:18.680]  Working sums don't pay taxes
[44:18.680 --> 44:20.680]  Bull, you pay the Social Security
[44:20.680 --> 44:22.680]  You pay the FICA, you pay the unemployment
[44:22.680 --> 44:24.680]  You pay all the other taxes
[44:24.680 --> 44:27.680]  This lie that half the public doesn't pay taxes
[44:27.680 --> 44:29.680]  That's a lie
[44:29.680 --> 44:33.680]  It's about 25% of the public who's not retired
[44:33.680 --> 44:36.680]  Doesn't pay income tax
[44:36.680 --> 44:39.680]  But you pay all the other federal taxes that are there
[44:39.680 --> 44:41.680]  You pay that gas tax
[44:41.680 --> 44:43.680]  You pay the cell phone telecommunications taxes
[44:43.680 --> 44:46.680]  You pay when you fly on an airplane
[44:46.680 --> 44:48.680]  A security fee to be groped
[44:48.680 --> 44:50.680]  Now they're saying for buses and trains
[44:50.680 --> 44:51.680]  They're going to start a security fee
[44:51.680 --> 44:55.680]  The feds are talking about a new fee on gasoline
[44:55.680 --> 44:58.680]  So they can set up checkpoints and feel your wives
[44:58.680 --> 44:59.680]  And your genitals
[44:59.680 --> 45:01.680]  And I'm starting to talk about these subjects
[45:01.680 --> 45:04.680]  But it's going on
[45:04.680 --> 45:06.680]  People get upset about talking about what TSA does
[45:06.680 --> 45:08.680]  Let's talk about what they're doing
[45:08.680 --> 45:14.680]  You know, I got to define what they're doing
[45:14.680 --> 45:19.680]  This is the type of stuff that is going on
[45:19.680 --> 45:22.680]  All right, I've covered the Iowa situation
[45:22.680 --> 45:25.680]  It's just no discussion of Paul
[45:25.680 --> 45:30.680]  And okay, the election was a fraud
[45:30.680 --> 45:33.680]  But all of this is going on
[45:33.680 --> 45:35.680]  And there's just no discussion of Ron Paul
[45:35.680 --> 45:37.680]  You just don't even need to know where he is
[45:37.680 --> 45:39.680]  In the new tabulation that they admit a fraud
[45:39.680 --> 45:42.680]  And we do have Ron Paul's brother
[45:42.680 --> 45:44.680]  A chip off the old block
[45:44.680 --> 45:45.680]  His younger brother
[45:45.680 --> 45:47.680]  Who's been for 40-something years
[45:47.680 --> 45:50.680]  Fighting the globalists out protesting the fed
[45:50.680 --> 45:51.680]  Sue and the IRS
[45:51.680 --> 45:53.680]  You talk about a real activist
[45:53.680 --> 45:55.680]  I know the Paul family, folks
[45:55.680 --> 45:57.680]  I know the whole deal
[45:57.680 --> 46:03.680]  And they are basically prototypes of Alex Jones
[46:03.680 --> 46:06.680]  They're basically G. Edward Griffin's
[46:06.680 --> 46:09.680]  They're basically Bob Chapman's
[46:09.680 --> 46:12.680]  That's who they are
[46:12.680 --> 46:15.680]  One brother ran for Congress to fight the New World Order
[46:15.680 --> 46:16.680]  And here he is today
[46:16.680 --> 46:19.680]  I wish more people would have run for Congress
[46:19.680 --> 46:20.680]  About the New World Order
[46:20.680 --> 46:21.680]  I guess Larry McDonald did
[46:21.680 --> 46:23.680]  And they killed him better than Hammer
[46:23.680 --> 46:25.680]  I guess Senator Hanson did
[46:25.680 --> 46:28.680]  And they arrested him on income tax evasion
[46:28.680 --> 46:29.680]  Which turned out to be a fraud
[46:29.680 --> 46:32.680]  And tortured him nearly to death
[46:32.680 --> 46:33.680]  Ever seen the interviews with him?
[46:33.680 --> 46:34.680]  So I was looking for those on YouTube
[46:34.680 --> 46:35.680]  They're not on there
[46:35.680 --> 46:36.680]  That must predate that
[46:36.680 --> 46:38.680]  He's in some John Burt society documentaries
[46:38.680 --> 46:40.680]  And stuff, Congressman Hanson
[46:40.680 --> 46:41.680]  I mean, they drove him around
[46:41.680 --> 46:43.680]  For something like eight months or something
[46:43.680 --> 46:45.680]  In an 18-wheeler till his feet all busted
[46:45.680 --> 46:47.680]  Like something out of a horror movie
[46:47.680 --> 46:49.680]  You know, till he had
[46:49.680 --> 46:51.680]  I don't want to get into it
[46:51.680 --> 46:53.680]  But you know what's sitting down does
[46:53.680 --> 46:56.680]  To your hind end for eight months
[46:56.680 --> 46:58.680]  Oh, it's torture
[46:58.680 --> 46:59.680]  Chained
[46:59.680 --> 47:01.680]  They call it desoling
[47:01.680 --> 47:04.680]  And they taught him
[47:04.680 --> 47:07.680]  So I guess there have been folks that came
[47:07.680 --> 47:10.680]  Before Ron Paul and you know what happened to them
[47:10.680 --> 47:14.680]  So we stand on the shoulders
[47:14.680 --> 47:16.680]  Of a lot of dead bodies
[47:16.680 --> 47:17.680]  You need to remember that
[47:17.680 --> 47:19.680]  A lot of people gave their lives
[47:19.680 --> 47:22.680]  Their treasure, their homes, their children
[47:22.680 --> 47:24.680]  So that you would know about this
[47:24.680 --> 47:26.680]  Take the Limburg
[47:26.680 --> 47:27.680]  The Limburgs
[47:27.680 --> 47:28.680]  And Mr. Limburg in Congress
[47:28.680 --> 47:30.680]  Is speaking out against the Federal Reserve
[47:30.680 --> 47:31.680]  And it's come out
[47:31.680 --> 47:33.680]  They basically just grabbed his kid
[47:33.680 --> 47:35.680]  Killed it and set up a patsy
[47:35.680 --> 47:37.680]  I mean, they don't play games, ladies and gentlemen
[47:37.680 --> 47:39.680]  A new order doesn't play games
[47:39.680 --> 47:41.680]  We're going to get Wayne Paul to pop in
[47:41.680 --> 47:42.680]  For about 20 minutes
[47:42.680 --> 47:45.680]  To get his take on what's happening with his brother
[47:45.680 --> 47:48.680]  Because obviously Ron Paul's going to take the high road
[47:48.680 --> 47:50.680]  On all this because they would crucify him
[47:50.680 --> 47:52.680]  It's admitted fraud in Iowa
[47:52.680 --> 47:55.680]  But he's like, well, we did third place
[47:55.680 --> 47:57.680]  We did pretty good, that's respectable
[47:57.680 --> 47:59.680]  Yeah, second place in New Hampshire
[47:59.680 --> 48:01.680]  There was fraud there, we got evidence of that
[48:01.680 --> 48:04.680]  Truth is, Ron Paul's hotter than a pistol
[48:04.680 --> 48:07.680]  He is hotter than the
[48:07.680 --> 48:08.680]  Than the sun right now
[48:08.680 --> 48:10.680]  And he is the real front runner
[48:10.680 --> 48:12.680]  And they're just doing every bit of spin they can
[48:12.680 --> 48:14.680]  So you don't understand that
[48:14.680 --> 48:16.680]  The last domino to fall
[48:16.680 --> 48:19.680]  Is for us to realize that he is really the front runner
[48:19.680 --> 48:22.680]  He's been the front runner the whole time
[48:22.680 --> 48:26.680]  I remember back in 2007 and 2008
[48:26.680 --> 48:28.680]  When he was running for president
[48:28.680 --> 48:29.680]  When he was in New Hampshire
[48:29.680 --> 48:33.680]  He would go on local college radio and access TV
[48:33.680 --> 48:36.680]  Because the media would not even give him attention
[48:36.680 --> 48:39.680]  And he was getting pretty good numbers in those states
[48:39.680 --> 48:40.680]  And they should have been
[48:40.680 --> 48:42.680]  They were getting people with less numbers, more attention
[48:42.680 --> 48:45.680]  This time, they'd ignored him for six months or so
[48:45.680 --> 48:47.680]  But the damn broke, they got discredited
[48:47.680 --> 48:49.680]  The heat got so hot on them, they said
[48:49.680 --> 48:51.680]  Okay, we'll stop ignoring him
[48:51.680 --> 48:53.680]  Call out the fake Ku Klux Klan groups
[48:53.680 --> 48:55.680]  Call out people making fun of Asians
[48:55.680 --> 48:57.680]  Attributed it all to him
[48:57.680 --> 49:00.680]  You know, go through 20 years of newsletters
[49:00.680 --> 49:02.680]  And find the supplements that a company
[49:02.680 --> 49:04.680]  They hired to promote the newsletters wrote
[49:04.680 --> 49:06.680]  Don't tell the public that 8 out of 10 of these passages
[49:06.680 --> 49:09.680]  Are out of supplements and it's just mild stuff
[49:09.680 --> 49:11.680]  Kind of extreme right-wing stuff
[49:11.680 --> 49:13.680]  You know, never mind the fact it's on record
[49:13.680 --> 49:15.680]  That he only wrote the financial section of it
[49:15.680 --> 49:17.680]  And had 14 published at one time
[49:17.680 --> 49:19.680]  You know, every week coming out
[49:19.680 --> 49:22.680]  Just say he hates black people
[49:22.680 --> 49:24.680]  I mean, after all, they said
[49:24.680 --> 49:27.680]  Rand kidnapped women, worshipped Buddha secretly underwater
[49:27.680 --> 49:31.680]  Wasn't a doctor
[49:31.680 --> 49:33.680]  It was a bunch of other craziness
[49:33.680 --> 49:35.680]  They had people dress up in overalls
[49:35.680 --> 49:37.680]  And John Deere hats, literally
[49:37.680 --> 49:38.680]  And run around with signs
[49:38.680 --> 49:40.680]  Talking about black people and Hispanics
[49:40.680 --> 49:42.680]  I mean, they're going to pull out
[49:42.680 --> 49:44.680]  Every stinking trick they've got
[49:44.680 --> 49:48.680]  Because we forced them to cover them
[49:48.680 --> 49:52.680]  All we've got to do is get on the field
[49:52.680 --> 49:54.680]  And it's over
[49:54.680 --> 49:55.680]  And I'll say it again, people are like
[49:55.680 --> 49:56.680]  Well, they'll probably still just steal it
[49:56.680 --> 49:58.680]  And we'll expose that they're stealing it
[49:58.680 --> 49:59.680]  And discredit them more
[49:59.680 --> 50:01.680]  But he'll be there covering real issues
[50:01.680 --> 50:03.680]  That's why we've got to go all in
[50:03.680 --> 50:06.680]  If Ron Paul doesn't get the nomination, folks
[50:06.680 --> 50:08.680]  And I know he probably won't run third party
[50:08.680 --> 50:10.680]  If he did, he would just be there
[50:10.680 --> 50:13.680]  Forcing his way into the debate
[50:13.680 --> 50:16.680]  And forcing his way into the staged event
[50:16.680 --> 50:18.680]  The theater of Mittens Romney
[50:18.680 --> 50:21.680]  And Barack the sheep herder Obama
[50:21.680 --> 50:23.680]  Both these guys
[50:23.680 --> 50:28.680]  Romney, Romney, by Romney
[50:28.680 --> 50:30.680]  Obama, Obama
[50:30.680 --> 50:31.680]  They're both Judas goats
[50:31.680 --> 50:33.680]  To lead their portal flocks over the edge
[50:33.680 --> 50:36.680]  Of a cliff into a meat grinder
[50:36.680 --> 50:38.680]  All right, now we got some good news
[50:38.680 --> 50:39.680]  For you straight ahead
[50:39.680 --> 50:41.680]  Ron Paul introduced his legislation
[50:41.680 --> 50:42.680]  To strike down the police state provisions
[50:42.680 --> 50:43.680]  Of the NDAA
[50:43.680 --> 50:45.680]  That's up at infowars.com
[50:45.680 --> 50:47.680]  Rand Paul with the double team
[50:47.680 --> 50:48.680]  Out of the Senate
[50:48.680 --> 50:50.680]  Vows to block internet censorship bills
[50:50.680 --> 50:53.680]  SOPA and the PIMPA bill
[50:53.680 --> 50:55.680]  I call it that PIPA
[50:55.680 --> 50:56.680]  That says they're a threat to free speech
[50:56.680 --> 50:57.680]  It's all coming up

[51:04.680 --> 51:05.680]  That bears repeating
[51:05.680 --> 51:07.680]  Digestive health is the key

[52:31.680 --> 52:33.680]  And produces electricity from the sun
[52:33.680 --> 52:35.680]  It's like having an electric power plant

[53:55.680 --> 54:21.680]  Possibly the world's fastest outdoor fire
[54:21.680 --> 54:26.680]  All of a sudden I saw Sheriff Dunn Brown
[54:26.680 --> 54:29.680]  Came in here to meet him
[54:29.680 --> 54:31.680]  Now they cornered him
[54:31.680 --> 54:34.680]  So I shot, I shot, I shot him
[54:34.680 --> 54:35.680]  I shot the Sheriff
[54:35.680 --> 54:37.680]  But I didn't shoot the deputy
[54:37.680 --> 54:46.680]  If I am yety I will pay
[54:46.680 --> 54:48.680]  I shot the Sheriff
[54:48.680 --> 54:49.680]  What did I say?
[54:49.680 --> 54:51.680]  I shot the Sheriff
[54:51.680 --> 54:53.680]  But I didn't shoot the deputy
[54:53.680 --> 54:55.680]  I shot the Sheriff
[54:55.680 --> 54:58.680]  I shot the Sheriff
[54:58.680 --> 55:00.680]  Well that is some good stuff
[55:00.680 --> 55:02.680]  We gotta go back in between
[55:02.680 --> 55:03.680]  Local radio in the morning
[55:03.680 --> 55:04.680]  Cooking the kids breakfast
[55:04.680 --> 55:06.680]  And listen to Johnny Cash
[55:06.680 --> 55:07.680]  And Willie Nelson
[55:07.680 --> 55:08.680]  And Waylon Jennings
[55:08.680 --> 55:10.680]  And Hank Williams
[55:10.680 --> 55:12.680]  The first, cause we've been listening to that
[55:12.680 --> 55:13.680]  For about a year
[55:13.680 --> 55:14.680]  We go back and forth
[55:14.680 --> 55:16.680]  We gotta reintroduce the Bob Marley
[55:16.680 --> 55:18.680]  In the morning for a while
[55:18.680 --> 55:20.680]  And that is some good stuff
[55:20.680 --> 55:22.680]  Some good breakfast kind of listening
[55:22.680 --> 55:24.680]  We kinda go back and forth between
[55:24.680 --> 55:27.680]  Classical, reggae and country
[55:27.680 --> 55:31.680]  But we tend to get stuck on the country in my house
[55:31.680 --> 55:32.680]  But I don't know
[55:32.680 --> 55:34.680]  That Bob Marley is a good second
[55:34.680 --> 55:35.680]  Or maybe even first place
[55:35.680 --> 55:36.680]  I don't know
[55:36.680 --> 55:38.680]  Okay, in fact I'm gonna ask my wife
[55:38.680 --> 55:40.680]  I'm gonna say you were the iPod controller
[55:40.680 --> 55:42.680]  Just cause you always turn it on first
[55:42.680 --> 55:44.680]  Can we go back to the Bob Marley for a while?
[55:44.680 --> 55:47.680]  Okay, I am digressing
[55:47.680 --> 55:49.680]  I am digressing here right now
[55:49.680 --> 55:50.680]  It's just good poetry folks
[55:50.680 --> 55:51.680]  You gotta love it
[55:51.680 --> 55:53.680]  So is Johnny Cash
[55:53.680 --> 55:55.680]  And you know that's why we love it
[55:55.680 --> 55:57.680]  Cause life is all about poetry
[55:57.680 --> 55:59.680]  And words are the meaning
[55:59.680 --> 56:01.680]  The things
[56:04.680 --> 56:06.680]  Wow, both of these are good news
[56:06.680 --> 56:10.680]  Rand Paul vows to block internet censorship bills
[56:10.680 --> 56:13.680]  Who else is fighting tyranny in Congress?
[56:13.680 --> 56:15.680]  SOPA and PIPPA
[56:15.680 --> 56:17.680]  Are threat to free speech
[56:17.680 --> 56:19.680]  Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul
[56:19.680 --> 56:21.680]  Has promised to do everything within his power
[56:21.680 --> 56:23.680]  To ensure the Draconian IP Act
[56:23.680 --> 56:26.680]  And the Stop Online Privacy Act
[56:26.680 --> 56:28.680]  Are not brought to a vote
[56:28.680 --> 56:31.680]  Paul says he will filibuster the PIPPA in the Senate
[56:31.680 --> 56:33.680]  Owing to the fact that the bill
[56:33.680 --> 56:35.680]  Is a direct threat to the First Amendment
[56:35.680 --> 56:37.680]  And he goes over that
[56:37.680 --> 56:39.680]  And they're also backing off of it
[56:39.680 --> 56:41.680]  From for now
[56:41.680 --> 56:44.680]  Just so opposition kinda backs off
[56:44.680 --> 56:46.680]  And people say well they'll just come back later
[56:46.680 --> 56:48.680]  That's why we gotta stay on them
[56:48.680 --> 56:50.680]  You don't like go out on the field
[56:50.680 --> 56:52.680]  And fight the tyrants and they run off
[56:52.680 --> 56:54.680]  And they know well they ran off
[56:54.680 --> 56:56.680]  They're gonna come back like cockroaches
[56:56.680 --> 56:58.680]  You gotta keep the pressure on them
[56:58.680 --> 57:00.680]  That's how you win a war
[57:00.680 --> 57:02.680]  For liberty, for freedom, for anything
[57:02.680 --> 57:04.680]  That's why the globalists always pressure
[57:04.680 --> 57:06.680]  And when they don't find resistance
[57:06.680 --> 57:08.680]  They back off as soon as we don't resist
[57:08.680 --> 57:10.680]  They push back again
[57:10.680 --> 57:12.680]  People are like gee we gotta fight all the time
[57:12.680 --> 57:14.680]  This is an eternal fight
[57:14.680 --> 57:16.680]  Raising your kids right is an eternal fight
[57:16.680 --> 57:18.680]  Getting up in the morning
[57:18.680 --> 57:20.680]  It just happens over and over again
[57:20.680 --> 57:22.680]  People think everything's just supposed to be easy
[57:22.680 --> 57:24.680]  The truth is it's fun to fight tyrants
[57:24.680 --> 57:26.680]  You've gotta make it a game
[57:26.680 --> 57:28.680]  You realize how much fun it is
[57:28.680 --> 57:30.680]  To route these people
[57:30.680 --> 57:32.680]  We can really route the daylights out of them
[57:32.680 --> 57:34.680]  The problem is if we really run them back
[57:34.680 --> 57:36.680]  In their holes for a long period
[57:36.680 --> 57:38.680]  Drive them underground for a long time
[57:38.680 --> 57:40.680]  We'll get so much prosperity
[57:40.680 --> 57:42.680]  Like we did before
[57:42.680 --> 57:44.680]  That we'll get laughed at
[57:44.680 --> 57:46.680]  By our grandkids about caring about freedom
[57:46.680 --> 57:48.680]  When we save their hind ends
[57:48.680 --> 57:50.680]  If we're able to do it
[57:50.680 --> 57:52.680]  And that's the problem
[57:52.680 --> 57:54.680]  When you give people liberty
[57:54.680 --> 57:56.680]  They only appreciate it for a generation or so
[57:56.680 --> 57:58.680]  And that's the problem
[57:58.680 --> 58:00.680]  You don't want tyranny
[58:00.680 --> 58:02.680]  But when you defeat it for a while
[58:02.680 --> 58:04.680]  Everybody kind of forgets
[58:04.680 --> 58:06.680]  And then the criminals creep back in
[58:06.680 --> 58:08.680]  And are careful about it
[58:08.680 --> 58:10.680]  They kind of got wild for a while
[58:10.680 --> 58:12.680]  That's why they're really in trouble
[58:12.680 --> 58:14.680]  I cannot state to you how big the awakening is right now
[58:14.680 --> 58:16.680]  NDAA coming to pass
[58:16.680 --> 58:18.680]  All this stuff happening is really
[58:18.680 --> 58:20.680]  Waking people up
[58:20.680 --> 58:22.680]  I was on Coast to Coast A.M. last night
[58:22.680 --> 58:24.680]  George Norrie totally agreed
[58:24.680 --> 58:26.680]  His listeners agreed
[58:26.680 --> 58:28.680]  It is on
[58:28.680 --> 58:30.680]  George said, I feel like that wall against evil
[58:30.680 --> 58:32.680]  Is building, it's getting stronger
[58:32.680 --> 58:34.680]  And I agree with his eloquent words
[58:34.680 --> 58:36.680]  We'll tell you about Ron Paul
[58:36.680 --> 58:38.680]  In the constitutional section
[58:38.680 --> 58:40.680]  And we've got...

[59:16.680 --> 59:18.680]  The continuity of government program

[59:20.680 --> 59:22.680]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening
[59:22.680 --> 59:24.680]  Depths to which our Republic has formed
[59:24.680 --> 59:26.680]  Prepare to enter the secret
[59:26.680 --> 59:28.680]  Of world of emergency dictatorship
[59:28.680 --> 59:32.680]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies
[59:32.680 --> 59:34.680]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner
[59:34.680 --> 59:36.680]  It's only the beginning
[59:36.680 --> 59:38.680]  Of the New World Order's hellish plan
[59:38.680 --> 59:40.680]  The police state isn't coming

[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.680]  Alex Jones
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.680]  Alright, we've got Dr. Richard Stalman
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.680]  Free software
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.680]  Guru Supreme
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.680]  Joining us to talk about SOPA, the internet
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.680]  And a lot more
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.680]  It's good to have somebody
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.680]  Who's kind of the archetypal opposite
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.680]  Of Senator Ted Stevens, who thought the internet
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.680]  Was a bunch of tubes that physical mail
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.680]  Was delivered on
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.680]  He's now gone off to Valhalla
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.680]  So that's coming up
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.680]  We've got breaking news
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.680]  Up at infowars.com
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.680]  If you go to the stop, SOPA, join
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.680]  The fight, click here now
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.680]  We have the article from yesterday
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.680]  I'm going to have that link changed
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.680]  To Paul Watson's article
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.680]  That is linked in red
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.680]  Google is already using SOPA-like
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.680]  Censorship
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.680]  And I want to point that out
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.680]  That it's happening to us, it's happening to others
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.680]  And it's certified and the proof is all there
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.680]  This is a big deal
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.680]  The power structure is fighting with itself right now
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.680]  And basically wants Google to be able
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.680]  To censor people, not the government
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.680]  But Google's already doing it
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.680]  We've got the proof right there
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.680]  Coming up later in the hour
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.680]  But we need to get this article out to everyone
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.680]  Google is already using
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.680]  SOPA-like censorship
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.680]  And it's got all the proof
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.680]  And guess who one of the main big fat targets is
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.680]  infowars.com
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.680]  And prisonplanet.com
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.680]  Gee, I wonder why, because they're growing exponentially
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.680]  Like insane gangbusters
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.680]  Thanks to you, the listeners
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.680]  And others out there, people like Matt Drudge
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.680]  Who links to us routinely
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.680]  Because he's a real researcher and journalist
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.680]  We're breaking a lot of news
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.680]  So there it is, right there
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.680]  And we're swimming upstream just like Ron Paul
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:10.680]  They're trying to black us out
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.680]  They're trying to censor us
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.680]  All this is going on
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.680]  And the article proves it all
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.680]  We'll be breaking it down later
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.680]  We're also going to premiere a video here
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.680]  That deals with the fact that we are winning
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.680]  Viral video, resistance is victory
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.680]  The tide is turning
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.680]  And of course I shot this video a few days ago
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.680]  Aaron did an incredible job adding all the documents
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.680]  To the error in the video, thanks to me
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.680]  I said
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.680]  They want to make us use fluorescent
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.680]  headache inducing light bulbs
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.680]  Instead of the beautiful phosphorescent
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.680]  When after I watched the video
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.680]  I said it's incandescent is what they're banning
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.680]  Phosphorescent is a subgroup
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.680]  Which is like day glow green
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.680]  Or a jellyfish glow with
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.680]  Of fluorescent
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.680]  But it doesn't matter
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:56.680]  It's just that when I find mistakes
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.680]  You better believe I'm going to tell you when I make them
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.680]  Because I know incandescent
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.680]  Is the difference between
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.680]  You know, you got halogen
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.680]  You got incandescent
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.680]  You've got all the different types of fluorescent
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.680]  And I know that
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.680]  But then I corrected
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.680]  And it's almost even pointless
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.680]  But I'm going to correct it
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.680]  Can't change the video though
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.680]  But it's a very small point
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.680]  No one even noticed it in the comments
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.680]  But I did. Viral video, resistance is victory
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.680]  It's up at infowars.com
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.680]  The tide is turning
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.680]  The video is there for all the radio listeners
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.680]  But I'm going to premiere the audio and video here
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.680]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.680]  And
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.680]  There's now been a new Supreme Court ruling
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.680]  Supreme Court rules
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.680]  Congress can re-copyright public
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.680]  Domain works
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.680]  Congress may take books, musical compositions
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.680]  And other works out of the public domain
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.680]  Where they can be freely used and adapted
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.680]  And grant them copyright status
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.680]  So I guess they're saying King James Bible
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.680]  I've been hearing about this case
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.680]  I guess they did it
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.680]  So I guess they can take Oliver Twist
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.680]  Or they can take
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.680]  Tale of Two Cities
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.680]  Or I guess they can take the little mermaid
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.680]  Hans Christensen or whatever his name is
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.680]  And I guess they can just re-copyright it
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.680]  And give it to whoever they want
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.680]  Unbelievable attack
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.680]  On the free flow of information
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.680]  Because they always use this not to protect a copyright
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.680]  100 years after somebody's dead
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.680]  They do it to stifle information
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.680]  Russia is trying to pass censorship garbage
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.680]  This stuff's happening worldwide
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.680]  Man, the crooks are the same everywhere
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.680]  And they figure out the best trick
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.680]  To bamboozle somebody
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.680]  And they use it and it makes me want to throw up
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.680]  Alright, we've got
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.680]  Richard Stallman free software
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.680]  Icon Guru
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.680]  Whatever you want to call it, Obi-Wan Kenobi
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.680]  Of free software
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.680]  Movement
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.680]  And we've got Ron Paul's brother coming up
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.680]  On the latest Iowa fraud as they're saying
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.680]  Don't count the vote now, Ron Paul doesn't exist
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.680]  And we've got Ron Paul fighting
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.680]  The NDAA's secret arrest provisions
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.680]  With no media coverage of that
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:26.680]  All coming up, stay with us
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.680]  And we'll see you next time
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:02.680]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are?
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.680]  A decade into the 21st century
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.680]  Record foreclosure rates for homes
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.680]  If not yours, your neighbors
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.680]  Thankful for the unemployment checks
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.680]  Since you were laid off
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.680]  And placing your child's name
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.680]  On the angel tree
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.680]  In hopes of a Christmas gift
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.680]  Along with thousands of other Americans
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.680]  Did you ever think your future
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.680]  Would feel this out of control?
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.680]  The fact is, in all this craziness
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.680]  There's only one thing you can control
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.680]  Your greatest dependency
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.680]  Your food supply
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.680]  Make 2012 the year you take control

[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.680]  You should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.680]  Number one, new climate legislation
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.680]  Could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.680]  Number two, our new energies are
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.680]  Wants to control how much power
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.680]  Your electric company allows you to have
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.680]  It's true, total government control
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.680]  Of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.680]  Technology is coming
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.680]  Number three, in some areas of the country
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.680]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.680]  And now, new socialist legislation
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.680]  Is only compounding the problem
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:30.680]  Number four, dangerous weather
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.680]  Is always a threat to local grids
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.680]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.680]  From weather-related onages
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.680]  Number five, a solar power generator
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.680]  Provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:44.680]  Offered by Solutions from Science
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.680]  One of my oldest sponsors
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.680]  You can get more information at

[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.680]  The information war continues
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.680]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.680]  OK, my friends, we've got a real treat for you
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.680]  There's...
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.680]  they talk about the top 10 people out there
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.680]  And internet land
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.680]  And who've really changed
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.680]  You know, our perspective on so many things
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.680]  It's Dr. Richard Stallman
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.680]  He's a software developer and software freedom activist
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.680]  He graduated from Harvard in 74 with a BA in physics
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.680]  And received many awards, doctorates, and professorships
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.680]  He's a software developer and software freedom activist
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.680]  And he graduated from Harvard in 74 with a BA in physics
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.680]  And received many awards, doctorates, and professorships
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.680]  He's a software developer and software freedom activist
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:43.640]  awards, doctorates, and professorships for extensive work in January of 84.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:49.800]  He resigned from MIT to start the GNU operating system, or GNU, meant to be entirely free
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.160]  software and has been the project leader ever since.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:57.720]  Dr. Stallman also launched the Free Software Movement in October of 85.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.720]  He started the Free Software Foundation.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.680]  And thank God, because nothing would work if we were running off Microsoft still.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.920]  And I don't know anything about Internet.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:05.920]  I know that.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:11.520]  And in 1999, Stallman called for development of free online encyclopedia through the means
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.360]  of inviting the public to contribute articles.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.480]  So he was the presenter of Wikipedia.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:23.840]  During his college years, he also worked as a staff hacker at the MIT Artificial Intelligence
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.080]  Lab learning operating system development by doing it.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:33.560]  Stallman pioneered the concept of copy left and is the main author of the GNU general
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.800]  public license, the most widely used free software license.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.840]  This is why, since the mid 90s, Stallman has spent most of his time in political advocacy
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:46.240]  for free software and spreading the ethical ideas of the movement as well as campaigning
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:50.160]  against both software patents and dangerous extensions of copyright laws.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:55.560]  That's why he's probably the best guest we can get on, you know, to discuss Russia, China,
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:00.640]  the US, they're all using copyright and later admitting they're using it to shut down free
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.640]  speech.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:07.000]  That was just one manifestation of this and this monster is receding for now, but is guaranteed
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  to come back very soon.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.120]  In fact, a few weeks, here's the Associated Press Supreme Court rules, Congress can re-copyright
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.280]  public domain works that have been out for hundreds of years.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.320]  This is amazing.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:24.760]  And so here to break down the different horrors of the expansion of copyright to where you
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:30.560]  can't even use words now they're saying is a professor and Dr. Stallman.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.800]  Thank you for coming on with us, sir.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.800]  Hello.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.800]  Hello.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.800]  Well, let's go over it.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.560]  I mean, what do you make of what's happening right now?
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.880]  Well, I haven't read any details about today's Supreme Court decision.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.440]  I haven't seen that yet.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:53.080]  But previously, other Supreme Court decisions said it was unconstitutional to re-copyright
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:56.880]  anything that was in the public domain.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.240]  But this is a very pro-business Supreme Court.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:05.600]  We can't trust it to protect human rights.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:11.360]  They're going to give those human rights to corporations and protect the rights of corporations,
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.880]  but not the rights of humans in any practical sense.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.880]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.760]  What got you started developing the ideas that have become the free software movement
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.120]  that you kicked off?
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:32.920]  I lived in a free software community in the 1970s, although we didn't use that term.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:38.640]  When I was working at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT, it was part of a community where
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.360]  we shared the software that we developed.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.720]  And all the software that we used was the software of the community.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:51.560]  We were happy to share it with anyone who was interested in it, and we hoped that if
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.400]  they improved that they would share it back, and often they did.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:01.960]  But this community died in the early 80s, leaving me face-to-face with the proprietary
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:09.160]  software world, which is the way everyone else was using software, and by comparison
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:16.760]  to the life of freedom that I was used to, proprietary software was ugly, morally ugly.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.000]  So I walked at that.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.320]  I said, I am not going to accept the life of proprietary software.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:27.280]  I would be ashamed of my life if I did that.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.840]  So I decided to build a new free software community.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:39.120]  Since the old one was based on software for obsolete computers, it was necessary to start
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.720]  again from scratch.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:47.240]  So I launched that project, and now there are free operating systems.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:56.120]  Now it's just barely possible to use computers and not be subjugated by software developers
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.080]  of non-free software.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:03.240]  But expanding that with just basic text copyright, take Rydehaven, they've been absolutely destroyed
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:11.120]  in court, they sued a lot of people across the spectrum for even taking a paragraph
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:16.480]  in a comment board where it was clearly a third party that had even done it, and they
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:19.800]  were backed by the Associated Press and others.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:27.840]  That is really creepy to have the Associated Press and others actually suing quadriplegics
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:34.200]  and community activist groups helping homeless people because they had one paragraph of their
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:41.480]  article and clearly were discussing in many cases their own, they were in the news article,
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:46.920]  they were posting on their blog about them for humanitarian discussion, couldn't get
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.720]  any more clear free speech, and they were being sued.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:57.760]  Well, you know, they may, if they went to court, they might win, the defendants might
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.040]  win on the grounds of fair use.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:05.560]  The problem is, it's hard to tell in advance and it costs you a lot of money to go to court
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:11.800]  and find out, so those people probably didn't have enough money to stand up for what are
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:19.000]  possibly their rights, plausibly their rights, but because of the way fair use is defined
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:29.240]  in copyright law, it's not a clear permission, it's a rather vaguely drawn defense against
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.840]  charges of copyright infringement.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:37.720]  Yeah, case by case, shifting gears overall, specifically on SOPA, is it heartening for
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.080]  you to see the big blackouts, to see the-
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:48.000]  It is, and what this means is that we can sometimes defeat the copyright law, be when
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.800]  it demands increased power, of course, we haven't defeated them yet, we are at least
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:59.920]  coming close to defeat them, to defeating them, and maybe we'll defeat them, but everybody
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:06.360]  listening to this, you've got to phone your Senators today because they're going to vote
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:15.280]  next week, so, but at least, even if we don't actually defeat them, we've mounted a campaign
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:21.760]  that will have come fairly close, this is the first time it's been such a fight when
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:29.000]  the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was passed, the law that censors software that you can
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:36.560]  use to decode encrypted publications, that you can use to break digital handcuffs, that
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:44.120]  was passed in the House of Representatives without an explicit vote, it was considered
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:50.360]  totally uncontroversial, there were just a few of us saying that this is an injustice,
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:57.760]  and that's why Digital Restrictions Management, DRM, is such a pain nowadays because of that
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:08.160]  law that the Copyright Law be purchased in 1998, which bans the software capable of breaking
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:16.920]  the digital handcuffs, so I am against anything that the Copyright Law be wants, until they
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:22.920]  start undoing some of the injustices they've already imposed on us.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:27.720]  Dr, let me try to quantify that from my layman's perspective and correct me if I'm wrong, but
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:32.360]  this is what, I mean, I see as the injustice, they're talking about their rights as they
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:39.680]  attempt to put a preemptive, non-deliberative, no-do process, guilty, until proven guilty
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.680]  system.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:46.920]  I was being sarcastic, I mean, you're guilty basically, period, yeah, guilty, until proven
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:51.920]  guilty, I was being sarcastic, but I mean, you're guilty up front, and they're basically
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:58.440]  just gobbling up the Internet, gobbling up what people have created, gobbling up everything,
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:02.680]  like their masters of the universe, and until they become reasonable, there's no point in
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.240]  even discussing anything with them because they're not giving anybody quarter.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:13.920]  I agree, but furthermore, the more subtle thing that they're doing is they're trying
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:21.280]  to focus attention on their problems as if their problems needed to be catered to while
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:26.040]  distracting you away from the problems they have already imposed on us.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:34.720]  I hope we completely defeat SOPA, but don't forget that copyright law in the U.S. already
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:36.000]  gives them too much power.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.280]  Of course, they're not satisfied, they always want more.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.080]  That's what the 1% do to the 99%.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:46.880]  But even if we stop them from getting more, that's not enough.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:51.520]  We've got to aim for more than just preventing them from making it worse.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:57.080]  We've got to undo some of the injustices they have already done to us.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:04.920]  We have to put an end to the war on sharing, which is a cruel war that attacks all of us.
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.640]  Now, when I say sharing, I mean something specific.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:17.560]  I mean non-commercial copying and redistribution of published works, exact copies.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.160]  That means not modifications.
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:27.320]  That's a rather limited freedom, but that's the freedom we all must have so that the war
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:33.200]  on sharing ends and copyright ceases to be tyranny.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:38.440]  Now, that means I've got to stop using digital handcuffs.
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:42.520]  Lots of products nowadays are designed with digital handcuffs.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.440]  Every DVD player you can buy has digital handcuffs.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.720]  Let me give people an example.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.720]  I have a TV studio, I have a TV show, I make films.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:57.480]  I buy prosumer and professional equipment, and half of our technical difficulties are
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:03.320]  with digital TVs, monitors, cameras, is having the right software keys, everything talking
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.000]  to each other plugged in.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  It has to authenticate that I'm allowed to run a video through it.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.560]  It's all spying on me and screwing up my entire operation.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:18.520]  My whole life is about complying with this stuff, and I bought it, and I'm in here using
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:24.200]  it to produce TV, and as the 80 inventors of the Internet pointed out, this SOPA would
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:29.920]  cripple the Internet by putting all these pre-restrictions on things.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:38.000]  Well, yes, the worst thing in SOPA is that it becomes easy to shut down any website where
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.920]  the public is posting things.
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:47.360]  It just takes an accusation that somebody posted something that was infringing copyright,
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.920]  and it becomes almost impossible for that site to keep operating.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:58.880]  That's why Wikipedia decided to go black yesterday, because it would be impossible to operate
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:04.880]  something even vaguely like Wikipedia under the rules of SOPA.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:11.400]  Now, after the show's over, I'd like you to tell me more about the precise details of
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:16.880]  your problems with these TV systems, or have your technical person tell me, because that's
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:20.760]  a scenario I don't know about, and I want to know about the details of that.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:27.120]  Sure, if you'd like that, the doctor actually have two engineers here, and they can explain
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.560]  it to you, but you know, we have TV sets behind me on the nightly news, and they're digital,
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:39.440]  and just to run feeds to them to talk to a guest on Skype or to have a blue background
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:45.960]  behind me, all the TVs you buy that are prosumer or even professional now, it has a gate in
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:53.680]  it that scans the sea if I'm even streaming something over it that's copyright, and then
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:58.880]  it's inlish, you know, to use software, you've got to have the dongle in the machine, and
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:20:59.880]  then that screws up.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:04.800]  Well, that's because you're using proprietary software, and proprietary, you see with software
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:09.120]  there are just two possibilities, either the users control the program, or the program
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.240]  controls the users.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:16.680]  What you're seeing is that with proprietary software, the software controls the users.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.760]  Now what's proprietary software?
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:25.360]  With any software for which the users don't have the freedom to run it as they wish, study
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:31.280]  and change the source code, and redistribute it either with or without changes.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.280]  So, uh...
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.200]  Sure, just to be clear, doctor...
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:40.720]  With control, but with Windows or Mac OS or Skype, the software controls the users.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.880]  That's why I will not use any of that.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.840]  Well, it is the machine, surveilling us, preemptively turning us into slaves.
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:51.040]  A lot of our operation is run on Linux systems, I'm not a tech guy, but...
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:55.600]  They're not Linux systems, they're GNU systems, and you're talking about my work there.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.160]  You're right, you are the progenitor of that with GNU that then other things get out of.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:05.040]  So GNU systems, we do have a lot of those, we have one of our IT people, just absolutely
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:07.480]  loves your work, has tried to build a lot of things around her like that.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.640]  But separately, when I've got a pretty big operation, it's not that big, like 34 people,
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:15.920]  you know, sometimes we've got a hurry, we've got to buy software to run TV shows, we've
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.160]  got to get equipment.
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:21.480]  I'm talking about solid state stuff, Doc, that won't work as well.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:24.000]  All I'm saying is, it screws everything up.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:31.960]  Yeah, hardware can be malicious too, and the encryption of video between a computer and
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:40.080]  the monitor is an example of a malicious hardware feature that has been put into, essentially
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:51.080]  all modern PCs, by a conspiracy of corporations, including hardware companies and media companies.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:57.840]  So you can see it, they buy laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to forbid
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:05.280]  people to escape from these things, and then they can design our technology to abuse us
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.080]  however they wish.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:15.240]  So what you can see is that proprietary software, because even when there's hardware that's
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:20.320]  malicious, the software has to make use of the malicious features.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:27.760]  So the proprietary software is involved also, and when software is proprietary, it is likely
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:34.520]  to have malicious features in it to spy, to restrict, and there are even back doors that
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.240]  accept remote commands to do things.
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.680]  That's what I was about to get to, sir.
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:45.680]  We're talking to Richard Stallman, free software, inventor, creator, guru, Obi-Wan Kenobi type.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:54.240]  So much of what we live with today that is the only alternative to what the big corporate
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:59.880]  Borg are oppressing us with did come out of his ideas, but expanding on this, Doc, because
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.520]  when you talk about it, that's what I'm saying.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:10.720]  I've tried to get the freer systems, and I'm saying in many cases, it does not exist.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:15.880]  I don't have the money to hire an army of people that are trained in free software to
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:19.080]  be able to even attempt it, and what you said is true.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:24.400]  There's all these Trojan horses built into everything, and I'm even paying for it, and
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:30.440]  it's junk, no matter how expensive, because the whole thing is tied down with these handcuffs,
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:34.960]  and it just absolutely stifles innovation, as you said 30 years ago.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:46.520]  Well, although it does worse than stifle innovation, you see, innovation is the sacred cow of people
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:49.920]  who claim that they need to be allowed to restrict us.
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:54.960]  They say if they can restrict us, they'll do more innovation, but innovation can be
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:06.120]  good or bad, democracy was once an innovation, tyranny was once an innovation, so innovation
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.640]  can serve us.
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.640]  Milo weapons were once an innovation.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:15.960]  Innovation will only serve us if we have control over what innovations will accept and what
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:24.360]  innovations will reject, so I do not accept innovation as sufficiently important to justify
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.080]  taking away our freedom.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:33.360]  Yes, I'd like innovation, or else being equal, assuming we have freedom, but when somebody
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:40.120]  argues give up your freedom so we can make more innovation, that is literally a Trojan
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.120]  horse.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:45.200]  Well, that's well said, but my point is they are, I mean everybody knows Microsoft stuff
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:51.400]  works horribly, because it's all got back doors, spy systems, and it's just total crap,
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:57.640]  because excuse my French there, because they're obsessed and control freaks, Bill Gates.
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:07.200]  Yep, but it's not just Microsoft, I've got to point out that Apple is even worse, and
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:18.400]  Amazon is horrible, the Amazon Swindle, an e-book reader, has known spy features, of
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:24.080]  course it has digital handcuffs, and it has a back door for deleting books.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:31.160]  Do you know that Amazon remotely deleted thousands of books in 2009?
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.160]  Yeah, 1984.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.160]  Right.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:40.080]  Someone wrote they used up a year's supply of irony demonstrating the Orwellian nature
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:45.520]  of their product, which they call the Kindle, because it's designed to burn our books, but
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:49.080]  they demonstrated it by deleting Orwell's book.
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:54.280]  Oh, that's another point, they've got this Kazaa thing where I've had rights to music,
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.320]  I've uploaded it, but because it's in some registrar, suddenly it shuts down the audio
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:04.000]  on my videos that millions of people are watching, and even though I have letters sending them
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.880]  to YouTube that I have licensed here, it doesn't matter, because the computer recognized it
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:14.000]  and did that, and they now admit they could erase my voice off these major systems in
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.600]  a matter of hours with the same technology.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:22.440]  I mean, you talk about dangerous having all the books digital, they could just hit a button.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.640]  That's why I won't use such systems.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:34.720]  I will never use anything like the Amazon Kindle for my books, because I want to have
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:39.040]  books that I can read without any proprietary technology.
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:46.640]  I want to buy them without identifying myself, and I'm not willing to sign a contract to
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.640]  get them.
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:54.120]  If I buy a paper book, I could do it with cash in a bookstore, I don't sign a contract,
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:28:00.920]  and my eyes, without any aid at all, or at most, perhaps with some lenses, can see the
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:01.920]  letters.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:07.280]  I'm not required to get some secret technology just to see what the letters in the book are.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:13.560]  So I will never use those eBooks under any circumstances, and I hope the rest of you
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:14.560]  will join me.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:24.640]  If you want to read more about this, look at stallman.org, articles, eBooks.pdf, and
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:31.360]  at the bottom of that, there is a link to a place you can sign up for to participate
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:36.520]  in our campaign against tyrannical eBook systems.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:42.720]  I mean, I had read some of your writings on this, but the way you put it, we can really
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.200]  see it being put into function.
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.320]  I mean, this is a tyranny.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:53.800]  They've designed the current web system as a tyranny, consciously, as you said, the
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:58.400]  big corporations of the sick part is, when we pay the licenses and buy the equipment,
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:03.520]  we're paying for their own Trojan horse for them to engage in beyond Orwellian behavior.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:13.120]  Yep, and that's, well, I wouldn't say beyond Orwellian, after all, Oceania did things even
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:21.240]  worse than destroying books, and they just murdered people, but the point is, we have
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:26.440]  to reject these systems, and that's the basic idea of the free software movement.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.400]  I won't accept the systems that are designed to take away my freedom.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:35.480]  Okay, doctor, I'm going to try to get you in touch right now with one of the engineers
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:40.040]  to give you any of that information you want, and I'll say bye to you during the break.
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:42.680]  Perhaps you can even come back for a couple more minutes on the other side and tell us
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:47.680]  more about solutions, but just intriguing to hear you on with us and all the points
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:48.680]  that you bring up.
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:50.680]  It absolutely makes sterling sense.
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.000]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.400]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:30:03.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:07.160]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:11.840]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:16.000]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.600]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:25.840]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:32.720]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream, with continued
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:36.160]  legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:41.760]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:47.040]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:53.280]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.600]  Lungs Generator.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:31:02.760]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:06.480]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:09.640]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  at home.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.640]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:20.640]  calling the shots.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:25.960]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:31.440]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:36.080]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:40.480]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.480]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:48.560]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.560]  of the Republic.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:55.960]  Get your copy, A Fall of the Republic, on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:59.840]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.440]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:06.400]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.040]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:12.080]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:13.080]  or gold?
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:16.360]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.640]  it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:23.160]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.160]  seeds.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:29.120]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.960]  food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:34.840]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:38.760]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:42.040]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:46.240]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:50.200]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:57.840]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:02.880]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:15.520]  Well, Richard Stallman, Dr. Richard Stallman, free software creator of the GNU system that
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:20.000]  everything's pretty much based on today, Linux, you name it, is our guest for five more minutes.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.920]  He's going to be gone for a while, but hopefully coming up in a few months we'll get him on
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.640]  for a full hour, because everything he talks about just totally clicks, because I'm not
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:34.240]  an IT person, but I live 12, 14 hours a day around it, we're an internet operation pretty
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:38.800]  much, we're on commercial radio as well and XM, but I live it and I've experienced what
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:43.920]  he's talking about, and all the points he makes ties right in to what I'm just organically
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:48.320]  seeing as a lay person here, but I was bringing up some intriguing stuff to him during the
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.320]  break.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.200]  We have the articles, we have the Time Warner executives send us the internal documents after
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.640]  we surmised it.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:59.600]  An example of these Trojan horses, the Tevo systems, the Time Warner cable systems and
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:04.440]  others, when they censored the Jesse Ventura TV show, it aired once, Congress went crazy
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:08.560]  on the FEMA camps, ordered them not to air it again, that later came out in Congress,
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:15.440]  there's a big scandal, suddenly off of DVRs nationwide, cable systems, you name it, it
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:16.440]  disappeared.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:21.360]  We confirmed it through one Time Warner office that they were ordered to put the command
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.360]  in.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:28.760]  We've seen that before, but the point is, you pay for cable, you have a DVR, you record
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:34.360]  on it, and then they go in and erase it, and I know you want to see the proof of that,
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:37.760]  we'll get it to you, doctor, but if true, what do you make of that?
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:44.920]  It's just another example of how non-free software is a restriction on the users and
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:46.720]  it's an injustice.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:52.160]  So if you look around at any non-free software you've heard of, you know, various products
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:57.960]  that have non-free software in them, every one of them should not be that way.
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:03.720]  Yeah, it's very, very sad that this is all going on, we're paying for our own prison,
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:06.720]  in just three or four minutes, because I know you've got to go, doctor, what are some other
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:13.840]  solutions or things we can start doing to weaken the power of the corporate board?
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:23.160]  Well, all across the various areas of life, we can see corporations taking control of
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:27.440]  our government and using that power to hurt most people.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:33.920]  Of course, there's the financial crisis and all the Americans facing foreclosure, a lot
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:39.040]  of these foreclosures are fraudulent, the banks are committing fraud when they foreclose,
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:44.720]  and right now we're pushing Obama not to let them off the hook, which is what he wants
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:45.720]  them to do.
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:50.480]  There are a few states where the attorneys general are trying to pursue the banksters
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:56.880]  for their fraudulent foreclosures, and there are protests run by move on today, I'm going
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:02.800]  to go to one this afternoon, but that's just one example, of course, the banks created
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:12.800]  the downturn by purchasing deregulation in Congress, and then if we look at, for instance,
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:21.240]  agribusiness, which is basically crushed family farming in the US, and now gets tremendous
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:26.240]  subsidies to these corporations, subsidies that were originally meant to help family
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:31.720]  farmers, and that made sense, but nowadays it's just subsidies to big business, and
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:37.040]  then you look at the private prison industry, which is a great reason.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:43.000]  They use the prisoners, they have the prisoners work, but it's the company that gets the money,
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:48.720]  the prisoner gets paid like 50 cents a day, which is even better for them than hiring
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:54.920]  somebody in Mexico or China, and so that's a reason to imprison more Americans because
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:37:01.920]  they're effectively slave labor, and then if we look at the oil companies, and they're
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:08.960]  pushed for burning up our planet, you may have followed the fight to block the Keystone
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:14.640]  XL planet roaster pipeline, and that's not dead either.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:19.840]  So what is it, what do these things have in common?
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:25.920]  What they have is corporations have power, so we need to clean up politics, we need to
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:34.560]  get corporate money out of politics, and I got a book yesterday, let me read the exact
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:44.800]  title, it's Corporations Are Not People by Jeffrey Clements, and this proposes a constitutional
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:53.320]  amendment to say that no, when the Constitution gives rights to people or persons, it's not
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.560]  talking about corporations.
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:04.920]  Well, the power to give corporations rights so they can then stomp on our rights, it's
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.880]  very very frightening, and for those that don't know, you couldn't even have corporations
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:12.920]  in this country the way they are until about the last 130 years or so, before that they
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:17.840]  had limited duration to build a bridge or to do some type of program, and I understand
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:22.400]  a little company having a corporation so you can have different people involved together,
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:27.640]  but the idea of giving it more rights than the humans, and then having these crooks that
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.840]  run it, I mean take Mitt Romney, he's got most his money in the Cayman Islands, and
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:36.040]  he's running around lecturing everybody, and he's paying almost no taxes.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:40.680]  Well he said that corporations are people, and someone pointed out that if that's true
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:44.120]  he's a serial killer.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:52.160]  I don't want to abolish corporations either, but we must abolish the political power of
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.680]  business.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:39:01.440]  In this country it's taken for granted that powerful business has a veto over everything,
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:06.080]  and that means it's taken for granted that we've lost our democracy.
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:12.680]  No one should think about that without feeling disgusted and saying, this must be changed.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:20.040]  Get that book, because he explains how it's not an accident that the Supreme Court gave
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:29.640]  corporations unlimited power to pay for political ads, it's the culmination of a 40-year or
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:37.640]  35-year perhaps campaign for giving human rights to corporations.
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:43.360]  It is very, very dangerous, and now those corporations are destroying our sovereignty,
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:44.840]  our local control.
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:50.600]  Dr. Stallman, thank you so much for spending time with us, and again give us your website
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:54.400]  and any other websites you think are important for people to look at.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:40:01.120]  For free software, look at the free software foundation site, that is fsf.org, and you
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.680]  can join if you wish.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:11.120]  For my other political causes, look at stallman.org, and if you want to join our fight against
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:22.400]  digital handcuffs, DRM, go to defectivebydesign.org, and for the danger of e-books and how they
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:29.760]  take away our freedom, look at stallman.org slash articles slash ebooks.pdf.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:35.880]  All right, Doc, thanks for the time, but in the final statement is, I mean just reiterating,
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:43.000]  you think it's really exciting that there's such an awakening to the power grabbing of
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.840]  the copyright industry and the fact that Hollywood and others just think they control
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:51.560]  the known universe, and this has certainly gotten their attention.
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.240]  What do you expect them to do now?
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:54.240]  How will...
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.240]  Let's find another way.
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:41:03.840]  You see, whether we defeat SOPA or not, even if we defeat it, it'll be clear that we defeated
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:10.120]  it because the measures they wanted to take were going to cause tremendous damage to everything
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:16.520]  around them, but if they propose something else that'll give them more power but won't
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:21.080]  hurt other companies, they might still get away with it.
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:28.320]  So, what that means is we still have a long way to go in building up our opposition to
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:34.200]  the point where we can start to undo some of the injustices they have already put into
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:35.520]  copyright law.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:42.160]  So it was just so ham-fisted and so brazen bull in a china cabinet they were unable to
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:45.360]  get it, but they will come back, and it does show how...
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:50.680]  I mean, remember five years ago when McCain said, let's pass a bill where no judge, no
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:51.920]  jury, no proof.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:56.760]  We just kill your computer if we think you did something copyright.
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:01.320]  I mean, this is overthrowing our entire Magna Carta, our entire Constitution.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:04.320]  I mean, it's tyrannical on its face, Doc.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:05.320]  Absolutely.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.000]  But that's what big business is like.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.040]  Big business just wants power and has no respect for anything.
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:13.040]  Wow.
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:15.640]  Well, I look forward to speaking to you again.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.600]  Thank you so much, Doctor.
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:18.600]  Happy hacking.
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.600]  Thanks for giving me the chance.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.840]  Yeah, thanks for being with us.
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.840]  What an interesting fellow.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:24.840]  Wow.
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:27.680]  That was a very powerful interview, a little bit longer than I intended it to.
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:29.920]  We got a lot to cover, but it's important.
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:33.480]  Now, I'm not going to have time to air all of this.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.200]  It's 15 minutes long.
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.160]  It's up at infowars.com, but I want to play it here on the radio.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:43.080]  Viral video, resistance is victory, the tide is turning.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:47.240]  And I go through a lot of the solutions, but one that I don't cover here is the biggest
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:53.800]  solution and the biggest victory.
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:56.960]  And that is that the awakening is viral right now.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:01.960]  People are really starting to understand with the passage of the NDAA and the rest of it.
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:03.720]  Look at the support of Ron Paul.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:07.360]  Look at the so-called mainstream media losing almost all its viewers and listeners.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:08.440]  They're in implosion.
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:09.720]  They're in free fall.
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:11.320]  That's what this soap of things about.
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.320]  That's a big part of it.
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:15.760]  That's why the mainstream corporate press institutes endorsed it.
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.840]  The system is scared.
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:20.800]  They built this whole grid to surveil us.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:23.520]  It's backfired on.
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:25.680]  And I'm not saying we're even winning the fight.
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:26.680]  We're in the fight.
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:27.880]  I agree with Dr. Stallman.
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:28.880]  It was on.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:34.080]  He said, this is the, you know, we're really starting to see humanity getting the fight.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:39.320]  And you're really starting to see humanity wake up that all is not well in the state of
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:43.520]  Denmark, as Shakespeare would say.
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:45.000]  And so it's very, very exciting.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.200]  So all of you need to realize the internet is still somewhat free.
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:54.080]  We still have the power of free speech until the big false flag or the war with Iran and
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:56.520]  all the other garbage coming down the pike.
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:01.360]  If we speak out now while the sun shines, the globalists may back off.
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:03.960]  I know they may slow down.
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.720]  Things won't go as well for them.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:09.960]  So now is the time like never before while we've still got the internet, while we've
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:14.960]  still, while so many people are listening, while so many people understand what's happening
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:19.240]  to gain the initiative, which we're starting to get and turn this around.
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:20.960]  So here is our report.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.040]  Aaron Dykes put this together.
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.160]  Amazing job, Aaron.
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:26.520]  And the article in video is it info wars.com.
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:30.360]  Please get it and get it out to everyone, you know, it's titled resistance is victory.
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.960]  The tide is turning.
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:32.960]  We'll play part of it.
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:33.960]  Got a break.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:34.960]  Come back and play the rest.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:39.120]  And then Wayne Paul, brother of Ron Paul's coming up, talking about the incredible election
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:41.240]  fraud now coming out confirmed.
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.340]  We told you so.
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:47.960]  We're throwing out the election results in Iowa, and they're not saying what that means.
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.800]  So now I guess they'll just admit fraud in states and then give it to Santorum or Romney.
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:54.000]  Well, there's fraud, but we say it's them.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:58.600]  We had a good old boy meeting and what a Carl Rove say, and just, you know, had a gentleman's
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:01.800]  agreement.
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:03.200]  Let's go ahead and go to this video.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:04.720]  It's up to you if this gets out to everybody.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:05.720]  Here it is.
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:10.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:13.360]  I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:15.040]  Resistance is victory.
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:22.520]  That simple initial decision to stand up and to get involved and to take action is the
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:29.680]  most important decision you can make because from that flows all other major actions in
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.200]  the fight for freedom and human dignity worldwide, but you first got to get angry.
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:37.680]  You've got to get focused and you've got to get engaged.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:40.200]  The world is at a crossroads.
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.800]  We have a decision to make.
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:49.560]  No one can deny anymore that tyranny is growing and casting its long, dark shadow across not
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:52.240]  just the United States, but worldwide.
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:59.440]  But in the midst of all of this, and as we move deeper into 2012, it is important to
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:07.440]  realize the incredible successes, complete and partial, that we've had against tyranny.
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:10.560]  These are just a few in the last year.
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:14.600]  In fact, after you're done watching this video, I would ask you to post comments with points
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.440]  that you believe have been victories so we can make a part two video.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:22.680]  But here are just some of them.
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:31.280]  The SOPA bill, or Stopping Online Piracy Act, which is really just a trojan horse as the
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:37.440]  inventors of the Internet, many others went public and documented, to shut down free speech
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:43.160]  and to allow giant corporate monoliths to basically carve up the Internet and take it
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:46.600]  over for their own uses and shut down their competition.
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:52.680]  But you saw the GoDaddy protest that cost hundreds of thousands of their customers to leave them.
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:59.040]  Many of the big Internet companies and smaller ones as well, led by Reddit and others, saying
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:04.160]  that they were going to basically black out their websites to protest the fact that the
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:10.000]  SOPA bill is a free speech killing system.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.760]  And now, because of the actions that you and others took, the system, who just a few weeks
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:19.920]  ago was very arrogant and said, resistance is futile, we're going to pass this, we've
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:24.440]  got hundreds more votes than we need in the House, suddenly it's crumbled and they're
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:27.080]  saying, okay, we're shelving it for now.
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:31.120]  And they hope that later you'll go back to sleep, that they can repackage their lives
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:32.440]  and bring it back forward.
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:41.040]  But the point here is, when we take action and when the people stand up for basic fundamental
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:48.400]  rights, the system and the oligarchs that control it are brought to their knees.
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:54.280]  So a big victory in early 2012 against something the system told us was a foregone conclusion.
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:59.760]  They don't just stop there trying to craft our reality, they've told us for a year that
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:05.320]  Ron Paul cannot win, that no one would vote for him, that he wasn't even a real candidate,
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:10.000]  that there was no way he could ever come in third, fourth, fifth place, much less second
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.600]  in New Hampshire and a statistical dead heat in Iowa.
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:21.400]  But despite the entire dinosaur whore media, the zombie control media telling you he can't
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:26.400]  win and excluding him from debates and giving him 89 seconds in other debates and all the
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:31.280]  demonization and all the dirty tricks and everything they've got being thrown at Ron
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:38.440]  Paul, he is growing in the polls nationwide and is a very strong second place.
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:44.140]  Even if he loses, even if they engage in election fraud, we all win because real issues are
[01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:48.280]  being injected and a movement for liberty worldwide is growing.
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:53.400]  Ron Paul and all of us that's supporting aren't just an example for freedom here in the US,
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:56.560]  there are movements sprouting up all over the world.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:03.000]  We are offering the alternative to the crony capitalist anti-free market monopoly men that
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.040]  run our government and other major governments who are trying to shut down the true free
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:10.120]  market and destroy our private property.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:15.560]  Ron Paul and his resistance and our support of him is victory.
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:19.360]  Let me move to some of the other big victories we've had in the last few months.
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:24.880]  All over the United States from California to Florida, but also in Canada and Europe
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:32.040]  and the United Kingdom, major cities and towns are removing the toxic waste sodium fluoride
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:36.120]  and other byproducts from their water supplies.
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:42.880]  One county in Florida has a million residents in it and the city council overwhelmingly
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:50.560]  after seeing the scientific evidence moved to remove the toxic brain altering chemical
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:53.120]  from the water supply.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:54.920]  Huge victory.
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:50:01.720]  For more than 60 years, globalist corporations in a bid to reduce fertility shows bisphenol
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:06.240]  A as a key ingredient in most plastics to reduce fertility.
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:11.720]  There were literally thousands of other formulae that didn't have the estrogen mimicar in it.
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:19.720]  But now 60 years later, all over the world, businesses, corporations, restaurants are
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:27.120]  advertising that they have bisphenol free products, whether it's baggies for food or
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.160]  furniture or clothing.
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:35.520]  This is another example of a human awakening taking place and in just a matter of a few
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:42.760]  years, public protest and voting with your dollars has overturned one of the main globalist
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:46.520]  tools of chemical control.
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:49.360]  Medical tyranny that was used in Nazi Germany, Soviet Union.
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:53.720]  All right, we're going to come right back and you know what I'm going to do?
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:58.280]  I'm going to play the rest of this with solutions and victories we've had after Wayne Paul comes
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:03.040]  up because I want to hit some other news right now.

[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:14.760]  By the way, on the nightly news this evening that I'm hosting, I remember a year ago,
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:21.040]  the Haitians came out and said, we believe the UN is bringing cholera and other weaponized
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:26.080]  forms of different diseases here because suddenly this stuff is spreading everywhere
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:29.040]  and it wasn't here until they got here.
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:35.000]  Now it's coming out in the mainline corporate press, this is the case, and we have a bunch
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:41.560]  of different reports on that this evening, and the UN is doing its normal raping children,
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:43.840]  kidnapping people.
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:46.960]  So I think this evening we won't just cover what's happening in Haiti because we always
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:50.080]  like to go further and give you a back story.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:54.440]  In fact, I know Rob is listening, Rob, let's just not stop there because during the break
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:58.320]  I was back there with the TV guys looking at news with them.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:04.240]  Let's get together, maybe the 10 greatest hits of the UN, giant child kidnapping rings
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:10.800]  when they moved into Serbia and Kosovo, giant kidnapping rings in Iraq, let's get the
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:15.720]  dying core, let's show folks, people don't know about this.
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:22.320]  The UN forces are just absolute murdering criminals who want to have fun with people.
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:29.240]  If you want to talk about an army that's known for atrocities, it is just pure evil
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:35.000]  because they've got all this political cover of how they're humanitarian and they care
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:42.800]  and all the Miss America's say support the UN and give to UNICEF and all this bull.
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:48.440]  It's a eugenics third world destroying slave grid and it's come out so many times.
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:55.000]  Oh, but the Haitians that were called conspiracy theorist turns out there right again.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  Turns out the worst is true.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.920]  So we're going to have those reports for you this evening, 7 o'clock central, 8 o'clock
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:01.920]  Eastern.
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:06.360]  If you're not a prison planet dot TV member, it's it'll be nine years up and operating
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:10.240]  in April and it over the years, it's had bugs here and there.
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:14.760]  They're pretty much all worked out, super fast audio streaming, video streaming, all
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:18.240]  the films, everybody can log in at once right at 7.
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:21.240]  You can even share your passcode with up to six people.
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.600]  So more people can watch it.
[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:25.360]  One membership's like six memberships.
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:29.280]  You can get 44% off a year membership right now or running that till the end of the month
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:35.320]  and we're also running the 15 day free trial at prisonplanet.tv and it's a more highly
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.520]  produced version of the radio show.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:40.080]  We've got reporters, we've got guests every day.
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:43.440]  I mean, this is a real new show.
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:47.440]  And of course we get about, I don't know, 25, 30,000 people.
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:51.280]  It looks like log in when it's live and then watch it over the evening.
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:56.720]  But then those of you that are members 15 cents a day, you fund getting the message out.
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:01.800]  You post it on YouTube and a bunch of other sites and millions a week on the aggregate
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:05.360]  do watch the show and it's only five months up and running.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:07.240]  And we're developing it for TV and other systems.
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:12.880]  So if you're not a prisonplanet.tv member, become one today, takes about 15 minutes to
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:17.960]  go sign up on 15 minutes, it takes 15 cents a day, it takes about a minute and a half
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:22.480]  to sign up, just username, passcode, boom, but if you're going to share the username
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:27.200]  and passcode with people, make sure it's not something that you have for your email, your
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:28.200]  bank account.
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:32.000]  You'll make up something silly or something easy to remember, obviously, and then give
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.880]  that to the six people you want to be able to log in at one time.
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.640]  So six memberships basically is what it comes down to for $5.95 a month or get a yearly
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:44.360]  membership and get 5.3 months free.
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:50.880]  So that's close to half off the year and that special will end at the end of the month.
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:54.360]  We also have some other specials running and remember when you purchase the books, the
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:59.960]  videos, the t-shirts, you get tools to wake up others, but also you support the news websites,
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:06.040]  the syndicated radio show, the nightly news show, the films, all the stuff we're doing.
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:10.360]  We're at the tip of the spear in support of Ron Paul everything over the years and it's
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:12.920]  just amazing what we're doing to hear together.
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:18.160]  So check out the online video bookstore at infowars.com or call toll free if you've got
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:27.800]  any questions of the crew here that can answer your questions, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:32.160]  Okay, that's my plug here to fill our gas tanks in the Info War.
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:35.560]  I'm going to come back and into more news than Wayne Paul, brother of Ron Paul is joining
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:42.040]  us to give us his take on the incredible election fraud in Iowa.

[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:29.480]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number three, and I've wanted to go
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:30.480]  to calls today.
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:33.560]  You notice I've been taking more calls because they're so informative and interesting and
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:34.560]  entertaining, quite frankly.
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:40.120]  I don't do an entertainment show, but I do like to be entertained myself and to be entertaining
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:42.000]  just because it gets boring if we're not.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.040]  That's why I screw around a bit, even though I try not to.
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:53.040]  I do work around quite a bit behind the scenes as well, but there's a lot of crazy stuff
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:54.040]  going on.
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:58.600]  It's certainly gallows humor if you get right down to the bottom of it.
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:00.080]  We got Wayne Paul coming on.
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:01.080]  I haven't talked to him.
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:05.480]  I just had the producers call him as a wild hare about an hour ago to get him on after
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:12.040]  the break because of the amazing chicanery going on in Iowa.
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:17.560]  I'm looking for my stack because when I come out of break, I've got to get back into this.
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:28.320]  But they have now come out and said, oh my goodness, it looks like the election was a
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:36.520]  big fraud in Iowa, but we're just going to say that Santorum has won.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:39.760]  And there's a big article out on this that's really important.
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:49.120]  Media coverup Ron Paul standing, not discussed in Iowa vote reshuffle.
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:54.760]  That's good, but it's like media coverup Ron Paul blacked out of Iowa vote reshuffle.
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:57.800]  He's really been blacked out.
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:58.800]  Ron Paul blacked out.
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:02.760]  I'm kind of the editor around here, and I edit live on air, heard prolific great writer.
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:04.240]  I might have him change that headline.
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:08.720]  It's even worse than that media coverup Ron Paul standing, not discussed in Iowa vote
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:10.720]  reshuffle.
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:11.720]  He's blacked out.
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:16.200]  It's just censored out memory hold, but I don't know the general public with no memory
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:20.560]  hold was getting back to 1984.
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:29.640]  Oh, here's my stacks of news where they just come out and say, well, Iowa is not a real
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:35.280]  election, but we're just saying Santorum won and they both share the delegates, I guess,
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:38.800]  beyond crazy.
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:42.280]  So please get that curtain in my article out to everyone, you know, and I haven't even
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:49.200]  gotten into this great news, Ron Paul introduced his legislation to strike NDAA's police state
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:50.200]  provisions.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:56.680]  That's why we love Ron Paul always standing for Liberty always telling the globalist
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:01.720]  to jigs up calling them on their scams, calling them on their fraud, calling them on all their
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:16.520]  ridiculous sub exploits, their extreme arrogance, calling them on their absurdist, tuberous filled
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:24.880]  rampant mania of taking their bulletproof literally dragging our world towards war, global financial
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:36.360]  ruination, because we the people have allowed a bunch of control free crux to run wild.
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:38.560]  That's what's happened.
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:41.400]  You know, you guys just turned the heat on here, I don't think I've had the heat on here
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:42.400]  all year.
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:44.720]  And I remember they did that fiberglass work.
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:49.840]  I think fiberglass is shooting out of there or something like my eyeballs just had sand
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:53.840]  dumped in them.
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:56.560]  I know it's getting hot in here now.
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:00.200]  Usually it's about 60 degrees here in the winter because I like it cold, but I guess
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:05.360]  now that I've lost like 30 pounds, I don't have my seal blubber as much as I did my precious
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:06.360]  blubber.
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:07.360]  So now I'm getting cold.
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:11.320]  I'm a little skinny creature folks.
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:16.880]  I am still way overweight, you wait, I'm going to lose 30 more pounds.
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:20.400]  I've been, it is a plug now that I think of it.
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:23.560]  If you want to lose weight, folks, the reason you're so hungry and eating, eating, eating
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:26.200]  is the vitamins and minerals aren't in the food.
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:33.680]  Even if it's non-GMO, most of it's been depleted, as you know, the soils that the grains are
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:38.200]  being raised from, the animals eat, that we then eat, all of it.
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:42.040]  And so I've got the best products that I've searched and found out there, the Ungevity
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:47.000]  products, the Tangy Tangerine, the Rebound, the Polymbers, those are my favorites.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:53.400]  They've got great whey protein, it's all available at InfowarsTeam.com and you can sign up there

[02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:59.320]  Look at me.
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:05.640]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:06.920]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:10.840]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:13.240]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:17.800]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:19.040]  on earth.
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:23.880]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:25.720]  expanded nationwide.
[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.600]  powerful shadow state.
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:35.800]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:40.280]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:46.120]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:49.560]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:51.600]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:52.600]  It's here.

[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:13.800]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:22.400]  There's a place down at Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:29.560]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you the love the way they fit.
[02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:35.560]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:40.560]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:47.360]  Returned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:51.920]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can

[02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:01.160]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:05.800]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:10.160]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:14.800]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:15.800]  you to have.
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:21.480]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:25.800]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:29.800]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:33.280]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:37.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.680]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:45.520]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:46.920]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:51.160]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:52.720]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:28.520]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:34.280]  We've got Wayne Paul, brother of Congressman Ron Paul, presidential front-runner Ron Paul,
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:38.880]  in first or second place, depending on what poll you look at on with us, just because
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:40.040]  I wanted to get his take.
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:47.760]  He's a longtime activist, CPA, going after the IRS, exposing the Federal Reserve, just
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:50.960]  a chip off the family poll block there.
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:56.280]  But when I saw this this morning, and it's gotten no media attention, that is, dinosaur
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:57.280]  media.
[02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:00.040]  They're not covering it, but they're not pointing out the obvious.
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:02.280]  Here's a headline out of News 14.
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:07.160]  Final Iowa Tally gives Santorum, we'll show folks a document cam shot of that, they're
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:11.040]  listening on the radio, they can just Google it and pull it up.
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:20.520]  But Final Iowa Tally gives Santorum edge over Romney, no winner declared.
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:29.000]  And it goes over the fact that, well, a whole bunch of the key precincts in Ames, Iowa, where
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:34.400]  he was running 50-plus percent of the polls, Ron Paul, those just disappeared.
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:37.280]  And then we also have the clip we've played four or five times, we could probably queue
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:44.520]  it up and play it again for Wayne, where we have on Fox News Carl Rove, known for his
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:49.880]  election manipulation, saying, well, a bunch of the ballots didn't show up, so they all
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:56.600]  just got behind the scenes together as gentlemen, and decided that Santorum was in second, and
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:01.160]  that Romney was in first, and then Ron Paul was in a close third.
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:05.120]  And Ron Paul doesn't want to act like a sore loser, he says, hey, we're doing pretty good,
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:08.680]  that it's second in New Hampshire.
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:13.000]  But the point is, that night, we'd already been told by people that some of the precincts
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:17.160]  were going to count it as secret, and why were there trucks driving around that disappeared?
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:23.520]  You call it in, and so now it's admitted that a bunch of these disappeared, and stuff went
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:24.520]  on.
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:30.400]  And so the news is saying, Santorum first place, Mitt Romney second, and in literally
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:34.520]  more than 20 articles we pulled up, not one word about Ron Paul.
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:38.840]  You would think he was a four-letter word or something, a cuss word, I mean, it's just
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:43.680]  no Ron Paul, no discussion of him anywhere.
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:51.680]  Here is the Des Moines Register, it's got Rick Santorum, total of 29,839, and it says
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:56.360]  final total, 29,805 for Mitt Romney.
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:02.520]  So you see that he's got 30, 34 votes more there than Santorum does, and no discussion
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:04.560]  of what happened with Ron Paul.
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:09.000]  And they go on and admit in these articles, well, they may not even count it now, but
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.560]  here's the numbers.
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:14.800]  So Iowa Talley gives Santorum edge over Romney, no winner declared.
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:15.800]  Who does that?
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:21.680]  Do they have another meeting with Carl Rove behind the scenes, I guess with some people
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:25.920]  that are gentlemanly and have a gentleman's agreement?
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:30.560]  So there's no discussion of why did all these precincts not report?
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:33.160]  Why was there fraud that got ignored day one?
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:34.680]  And where is Ron Paul?
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:39.280]  I mean, all of this happening just fits into Ron Paul getting kicked out of debates, or
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:43.120]  89 seconds in the debates, or getting the least amount of coverage, or when he does
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:46.400]  it's negative, and they say he can't win.
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:52.480]  And shoving Mitt Romney, Santorum, and Gennrich, all globalist flip-floppers on us.
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:59.040]  I wanted to get Wayne Paul's take on this because this really shows how crazy things
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:00.040]  have gotten.
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:03.080]  You know, we were concerned the day before, Wayne, as you know, and some folks in the
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:05.360]  campaign were like, oh no, there's no problem.
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:09.360]  But I mean, what do you do when this type of stuff is going on, Wayne?
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:15.520]  Well, I think it's frustrating for all the supporters for Ron Paul.
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:25.120]  But even more so, it's got to be frustrating for the people of Iowa who truly want honest
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:36.680]  results from votes, who have a view that manipulate the strong poll votes for their own gain, how
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:45.960]  to make the people in Iowa very, very upset, and very, very concerned about who's telling
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:51.600]  what to whom, and they should be upset, they should be mad, and they should want to kick
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:55.760]  these kind of people out and get somebody in Arizona.
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:57.680]  Again, Wayne Paul joining us from Texas.
[02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:03.880]  Wayne, though, you cannot debate that a bunch of ballots disappeared.
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:06.960]  People call in the votes, they'd get changed.
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:08.400]  Obviously something went on here.
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:12.400]  The Republican leadership counted it in secret, I guess, so they could get away with this.
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:18.120]  And now they admit it's a fraud, but they say still we're going with these guys.
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:20.280]  I mean, this is bizarre.
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:23.800]  And again, the media's not even pointing out how bizarre it is.
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:27.040]  Why do you, I mean, there's not only fraud here, Wayne, obviously.
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:31.640]  What do you think of them not even mentioning your brother as if he even exists?
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:40.480]  Well, the major media has attempted to do that since Alaska around four years ago.
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:48.400]  I think the other thing that frustrates me about Iowa is that before the Iowa straw
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:14:04.400]  poll vote was taken, I heard on a YouTube where one of the state Republican people stated,
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:11.720]  and I heard her voice can't tell you who it was, but stated that they always consider
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:20.640]  changing votes before the final vote because that's just the way they operate.
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:26.080]  They had a media analyst on Fox and on the news, but she works with Fox, say two days
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:32.560]  before state officials aren't going to let Ron poll win, they're going to handle it.
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:37.440]  And then we played that clip here, and then I understand the campaign doesn't want to
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:41.480]  look like sore losers, but when there's fraud going on out in the open, I mean, I'm
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:46.360]  glad that your brother is now suing the people that made this video who claim they work for
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:49.560]  Huntsman to make your brother look like he doesn't like Asians.
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:57.600]  I mean, look what they did to your nephew, Rand, claiming he worships Buddha and kidnaps
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:59.760]  women and isn't a doctor.
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:00.760]  Yep.
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:11.160]  It's just, unfortunately, Alex, it appears to be a sign of our time that those that
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:21.880]  have the ability to manipulate results for certain people's benefits, it's that the
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:31.880]  true honest conservative, libertarian individual in America is not seeing what's really happening.
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:43.320]  You know, even after the last debate, they showed on CNN or Fox or one of them the fact
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:50.600]  that on Twitter, Ron had positive results on all four or five issues that we're spoken
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:59.280]  to, but they seem to brush that off that that was no big deal.
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:03.800]  But normally they say Twitter is the main indicator of just sheer numbers.
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:06.520]  He was, he was beating them all.
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:13.400]  He's the main front runner and notice that these ballots disappeared in key young people
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:18.600]  in college areas that were polling more than 50% for Ron Paul Wayne.
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:21.600]  It makes you wonder, doesn't it?
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:22.600]  Yeah.
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:31.000]  But, but so, I mean, obviously, look, if they'll steal his time and lie about him and
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.800]  ignoring and tell us that they're doing this because they're deciding for us, of course
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:37.880]  they'll engage in election fraud too.
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:41.840]  Do people think they're just going to stop at lying about him and doing all this in the
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:42.840]  media?
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:43.840]  No, they're going to go all the way.
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:44.840]  And they did.
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:47.640]  I mean, we've got fraud here, but no investigation is going to happen.
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:51.600]  Just like when I found, found fraud in Travis County, I took it to the state board live
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:56.280]  on TV and they said there is fraud, but we're going to certify the Travis County election
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:57.280]  anyways.
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:16:58.280]  Yep.
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:16:59.280]  Yep.
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:10.640]  Well, and I really don't know the answer except that each person in each precinct, wherever
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:17.200]  they're at, whatever state they're in, if they're in South Carolina right now, what
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:25.520]  are they going to do and how are they going to ensure that there's honesty that my vote
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:34.640]  will be counted and be counted honestly, there has to be a mechanism to be able to do this.
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:42.760]  And there are several groups that's trying to create an online instantaneous reporting
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:49.640]  from each precinct anywhere in any state that's voting so that it can be transferred, put
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:56.440]  up on a screen and everybody that has a computer can see what the votes are as they come in.
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:59.600]  Well it is because of stuff like that and people on the ground that we knew about the
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:02.600]  fraud day one, people like, oh, be quiet.
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:06.720]  Day after it's admitted it happened and two weeks later they're just saying, except the
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:07.720]  fraud.
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:10.920]  I want to come back in one more segment with Wayne Paul, Ron Paul's brother, political
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:12.720]  activist, patriot, and his own right.
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:19.400]  But if you could say one thing to your brother, Ron Paul, right now, just a shout out to him,
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:25.000]  what would that be, A and B, if you've talked to your brother lately, how's he doing?
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  Well, A, I would say to Ron, continue the voice that he's had for 30 years, he needs
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:43.120]  to reiterate, zero taxes are fantastic and people all they have to do is look at history
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:53.680]  from 1835 to 1913, this country ran on legitimate constitutional taxes of import, export, and
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:58.440]  excite and we were extremely successful.
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:05.040]  We had extreme amount of growth and we had a beautiful country to live in and we need
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:08.320]  to return to that.
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:13.720]  You said it, I know we're going to get Ron Paul on in the next few weeks, he's out there
[02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:18.920]  really busting his butt, but have you talked to him lately or has he been so busy you
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:21.160]  hadn't had time to talk to him, Wayne?
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:29.600]  Well, I had an opportunity to talk to him this past week, but it was primarily on personal
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:37.480]  items as a relink to requirements of filing tax forms, I don't want to get into that,
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:43.680]  I just wanted the inside baseball on, the family's got to be really proud of Ron.
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:51.880]  Oh, absolutely, what he has done to awaken the American people and the number of people
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:58.000]  who support and work diligently for him every day, it's amazing, he's Liberty's champion,
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:02.000]  Wayne got a break, stay there, sorry to interrupt you.
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:06.920]  After work, I just want to plop down on the couch and watch TV alone.
[02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:09.440]  Come on, don't be like that, who are you?
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:14.960]  I'm you, 20 years ago, when you were full of energy, better shape, great attitude and
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:17.480]  you didn't do so bad with the ladies.
[02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:21.360]  Now that you're older, your testosterone levels are dropping and well, you're not the guy
[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:22.560]  you used to be.
[02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:25.280]  I'd give anything to feel like you again.
[02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:27.000]  Just try ageless male.

[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:37.600]  normal healthy ranges, it's not an injection, not a prescription and with healthy testosterone
[02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:42.120]  levels, you can feel the energy again, not to mention a better mood and more drive in
[02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:44.600]  your romantic life, more drive, huh?
[02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:49.640]  I really need to try ageless male, where's my phone, you're laying on it, oops.

[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:32.600]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:36.400]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:37.400]  IRAs?
[02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:41.360]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:43.040]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:46.560]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:51.560]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:57.400]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:57.400 --> 02:22:01.040]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:07.520]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights
[02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:08.520]  back on?
[02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:12.240]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear, because there's
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:16.280]  never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:17.440]  Here's why.
[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:21.840]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one
[02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:23.440]  of our oldest sponsors.

[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:33.600]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity
[02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:34.600]  from the sun.
[02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:38.800]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own, whether it's
[02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:43.160]  ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power
[02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:44.480]  outages again.
[02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:48.640]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from
[02:22:48.640 --> 02:22:50.040]  Solutions from Science.

[02:24:04.040 --> 02:24:26.880]  All right, it is our final segment with Wayne Paul's
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:33.520]  very busy CPA in his own right and political activist exposing me unconstitutional IRS
[02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:36.160]  joining us the middle of his work day here.
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:39.600]  We only got a few minutes left, but talking to him to finish that question, he says he's
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:44.000]  talked to Ron last week and he's doing great and super fired up, but you can see that on
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.200]  the campaign trail.
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:50.600]  Your brother really looks more happy and fired up than I've ever seen him.
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:58.480]  It's got to be satisfying to see how much he's having an effect waking people up, Wayne.
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:24:59.980]  That's absolutely correct.
[02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:09.840]  I think the other things that has made him comfortable and more wrestled the fact that
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:18.320]  he's been able to travel from place to place differently than he did four years ago having
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:24.200]  to use commercial airlines, he doesn't do that this time, therefore he's able to get
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:28.280]  more downtime and restful time, which is what he really needs.
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:32.880]  The airport will beat the daylights out of you and when he started flying private, the
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:35.760]  media made fun of it when all the other candidates do.
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:40.640]  We need him to be getting places faster and getting more rest.
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:45.160]  It's ridiculous that Liberty's champion, of course, should be flying around with all
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:46.160]  his staff.
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:51.960]  I saw the news had to admit, it costs less to fly the 10 or 15 people on a private jet
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:54.840]  than it does even fly on commercial most times.
[02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:58.520]  That is correct besides the amount of time saving.
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:07.800]  There's an airport 15 minutes from my brother's house, so we can still fly it back home at
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:10.680]  midnight and be in bed before 12.30.
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:13.000]  The TSA doesn't get to grope him as well.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.960]  I know he said that happens to him when he flies commercial.
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:21.240]  I want to play you a short clip of Carl Rove, it's unedited except for a Kentucky Derby
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:25.840]  clip at the end making a joke about Santorum popping into the lead from nowhere.
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:29.080]  But here's Carl Rove on Fox News, listen to this, Wayne.
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:34.960]  Romney is going to win the Iowa caucuses by 14 votes, how solid is your evidence?
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:38.800]  From a pretty good reliable source, they made the correction in Story County, which moved
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:44.840]  it from an 18-point margin for Santorum to a four-point, a four-vote margin for Santorum.
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:48.480]  Plainton County, you have the one outstanding precinct in the state and that it will show
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:56.920]  an 18-vote victory in that precinct for Mitt Romney, which will give him a statewide victory
[02:26:56.920 --> 02:26:58.440]  of 14 votes over...
[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:00.760]  And Rom out of nowhere, it's Rick Santorum.
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:04.040]  I don't understand, you're saying that they basically have come to an agreement as to
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:07.320]  what the vote's going to be and claim?
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:12.520]  The person who's got the official piece of paper is missing, but the Romney and Santorum
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:16.800]  people who are monitoring it agree on what the number is, they've apparently rounded
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:20.560]  up the representatives of the camps who have agreed, yes, we were there, we know exactly
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:25.120]  what the vote total was and we both agree to what it was.
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:30.440]  So Carl Rove magically knew, this was pretty early in the evening that night, what the
[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:35.720]  totals were and now two weeks later it's an admitted fraud just as our watchers said.
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:40.480]  One poll, clearly in every case, was getting more votes and now he's not even mentioned
[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:41.480]  in this way.
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:44.400]  I mean, I go back to this, this is a big story.
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:53.920]  Well, it is absolutely a big story, but again, I have to emphasize the fact that the people
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:28:03.560]  of Iowa are being shortchanged by those who are manipulating numbers and votes for somebody's
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:12.080]  eventual gain and the people in Iowa ought to be livid on just hearing this stuff.
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:17.440]  They ought to take the Republican Party of the state of Iowa and kick them all out and
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:18.440]  start over again.
[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:19.440]  Yep.
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:20.440]  Very frustrating.
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:22.440]  Exactly, they're not even telling us what's going to go on the delegates.
[02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:27.480]  They say the election, the quote is, no winner declared, but they're going to say the winner
[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:28.480]  Santorum.
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:34.520]  It's a very bizarre, no discussion of where the votes win, no discussion of redoing it
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:38.280]  and I understand why the campaign's not making a bigger deal out of this because it can be
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:42.120]  spun, they're sore losers or it might skew.
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:43.120]  Of course.
[02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:44.120]  Sorry, go ahead, Wayne.
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:48.600]  No, and I think the important thing is the positive approach of saying, okay, that's fine,
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:57.480]  let's get one or two new Amsterdam now, South Carolina and then wherever Ford or whatever
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:04.440]  is next, we'll take them one state at a time and we'll get the people who support us and
[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:13.240]  eventually they're going to be forced to reckon with us one way or the other and I think we'll
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:16.800]  find that out in the next three to six months.
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:22.120]  They're going to have to deal with the young people that support my brother and they've
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:27.120]  got to decide whether they want them in the Republican Party or they do not want to grow
[02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:28.120]  the Republican Party.
[02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:29.120]  That's right.
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:34.360]  And in Alec, I live in a very small town, say what, stay there, let's go to Brighton
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:37.880]  to do a few more minutes on the other side, Wayne, you've got more to say, I've been throwing
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:41.760]  in so many points, I want to hear what you have to say on the other side and we'll get
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:47.000]  into all the other news on internet censorship, there's something a lot bigger than SOPA out
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.080]  there, I'll tell you about it on the other side, stay with us.
[02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:58.560]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:04.240]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:04.240 --> 02:30:08.920]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized
[02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:09.920]  risk.
[02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:11.200]  Saving means to make money.
[02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:15.400]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[02:30:15.400 --> 02:30:20.920]  fashion real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:26.680]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants
[02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:28.360]  or antibacterials.
[02:30:28.360 --> 02:30:33.880]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:36.280]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:39.560]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[02:30:39.560 --> 02:30:41.640]  to do something you've never done before.
[02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:49.760]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:06.640]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:09.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:14.120]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:15.120]  at home.
[02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:20.280]  We've turned an endless influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:21.280]  shots.
[02:31:21.280 --> 02:31:26.120]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:31:26.120 --> 02:31:31.600]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:36.280]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:40.640]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[02:31:40.640 --> 02:31:42.600]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:48.680]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:49.680]  of the Republic.
[02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:56.080]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right

[02:32:01.240 --> 02:32:05.600]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century?
[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:09.440]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours and your neighbors.
[02:32:09.440 --> 02:32:13.640]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off and placing your child's
[02:32:13.640 --> 02:32:19.080]  name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift along with thousands of other Americans.
[02:32:19.080 --> 02:32:22.960]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:28.400]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control, your greatest
[02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:30.960]  dependency, your food supply.
[02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:34.880]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.

[02:33:12.760 --> 02:33:19.240]  Okay, political activist, patriot, Wayne Paul, brother of top presidential contender, the
[02:33:19.240 --> 02:33:24.240]  only conservative constitutionalist out there, Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:29.040]  And again, we don't want there to be fraud, but, I mean, clearly, Ron Paul is the winner
[02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:30.040]  in Iowa.
[02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:32.800]  Clearly, they've been attacking him, lying about him.
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:36.200]  And so understand, folks, we're winning just by Ron Paul running.
[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:37.760]  We're winning.
[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:39.800]  Look at where he's come from four years ago.
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:44.760]  Look at what Rand's doing on the Senate, trying to block and exposing tyrannical legislation.
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:49.440]  They've got all these campaign for liberty people who are true constitutionalists now
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:51.080]  running.
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:54.840]  That's going to get exponentially more powerful as we build.
[02:33:54.840 --> 02:33:56.360]  And Ron Paul could win.
[02:33:56.360 --> 02:34:01.680]  I mean, he's gone from nowhere with the media ignoring him to number two, probably number
[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:07.600]  one, and the records of the other guys are so pitiful, if we get behind him, it's on.
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:12.160]  And folks all over the country, I talked to talk show host, you name it, liberals, conservatives,
[02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:13.680]  they all love Ron Paul.
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:17.680]  Every caller I hear to local radio says, I want Ron Paul, and the host says, too bad,
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:18.680]  you can't have him.
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:26.640]  I mean, to hear the corporate dinosaur media with their parroting that Ron Paul can't win,
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:33.800]  telling their own audience that they're idiots, it's, you're really seeing this paradox here.
[02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:36.880]  Wayne Paul, you were, I think, getting to that point you were talking about you live
[02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:37.880]  in a small town.
[02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:49.240]  I live in a small county in Texas, and even in our county four years ago, there was such
[02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:58.280]  contempt that because I worked in the precinct and went to the county convention, I was in
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:07.520]  effect ostracized because of my name, and it was pretty frustrating to, to see that
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:08.520]  happen.
[02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:15.200]  And then to hear our governor at that time at the state convention, saying, since we
[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:22.720]  don't have anybody running for president, you can do what you want with your votes.
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:31.120]  And from Texas, and they didn't even grant him favorite son status, Perry wouldn't even
[02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:34.120]  grant that to him four years ago.
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:39.600]  Well, look at Perry, he's coming back with his tail between his legs exposed for working
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:41.400]  for Al Gore and all the rest of it.
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:45.960]  I mean, if one thing we're learning here, the Republican leadership is basically a bunch
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:52.240]  of globalist, socialist, corporatist, Democrats masquerading as conservatives.
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:56.600]  Well, it sure looks like that.
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:04.680]  And I think the greater issue is what do the Republican, or what does the Republican party,
[02:36:04.680 --> 02:36:12.600]  nationwide, statewide and county-wide, what do they want to do to grow their party?
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:17.200]  It's evident you're not anxious to do it.
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:20.440]  In everything they do, they're shown we don't care.
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:21.920]  And that's very unfortunate.
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:27.560]  Well, in closing, Ron Paul, your brother has pretty much said, no, I'm probably not going
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:32.520]  to run third party, but stop trying to make me say what I'll do.
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:34.680]  You obsess on this.
[02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:41.960]  And I understand that running third party, it would probably be hard to get elected,
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:45.880]  but he would be able to continue to inject real ideas, which is winning, resistance
[02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:54.640]  to his victory, and I understand that then they could demonize the congressman if Obama
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:58.720]  got reelected because of it, claiming like he did what Ross Perot did.
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:02.720]  So it is a complex issue, but what's your view on your brother running third party?
[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:05.720]  Well, it's not going to happen.
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:14.080]  I think the problem is that the Republican party is trying to spread or develop that
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:26.280]  rumor because they do not want to turn around and defeat our current president because Ron
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:31.440]  is the only one that can do it, and they can't handle it, so they're going to try everything
[02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:37.200]  in their power to blame it on somebody else except the National Republican Party.
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:38.200]  That's right.
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:44.280]  They've got to make up their mind because by the time we get to the convention, there's
[02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:49.600]  going to be a Republican party space because they don't want the young people, they don't
[02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:55.080]  want the libertarians, and they don't want the distant franchise Democrats in their
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:38:00.080]  party, and they're going to try to blame it on whomever they can, and it ain't going
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:01.080]  to happen.
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:05.240]  Well, I agree with you, and I've told people that, I don't think your brother's going
[02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:11.680]  to run for third party, he just doesn't like having an option closed to him, and he has
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:14.800]  wisdom, you obviously have wisdom, people are hearing it right now, and that's probably
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:15.800]  a good move.
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:20.480]  I just wish there was somebody prominent third party just so they could be in the debates,
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:21.480]  but who knows?
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:24.760]  Your brother would probably run third party and probably have 30% of the vote out of
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:25.760]  the gate.
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:26.760]  They probably wouldn't have him in the debate.
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:30.240]  I mean, you know, they're that big of a cheats.
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:35.760]  Well, it's not going to happen, the National Republican Party's going to have to make
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:40.680]  up their mind that they're going to have to deal with it, or they're the ones that they're
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:42.440]  going to have egg on their face.
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:46.240]  Well, by the way, as you know, you're right, they've got a whole bunch of polls that have
[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:51.040]  been coming out for six months, and Ron Paul, for those that don't know, has the highest
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:53.240]  numbers against Obama.
[02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:57.920]  I mean, he would clean the floor with Obama, wouldn't he, Wayne?
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:06.880]  I don't have any doubt in my mind, because of his consistency in his stance in his position
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:14.280]  in cutting back government and in obtaining a greater national defense by bringing our
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:15.280]  troops home.
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:21.400]  All of these things resonate with the majority of the people in the United States.
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:25.560]  And the $1 trillion first year budget cut, getting rid of the income tax that we built
[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:31.120]  the country without ending the torture of the secret arrest, in closing, again, your
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:36.640]  brother, one of the only sane people in Congress, he's gotten a few people in under him, but
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:38.240]  they're not prominent yet.
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:45.200]  Ron Paul introduces legislation to strike NDAA's police state provisions, boom, no
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:49.360]  corporate media coverage of that speech yesterday.
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:54.000]  They just said he was up there to do a futile vote against debt increase, which is not futile
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.200]  doing the right thing.
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:40:05.880]  And it continues with Rand saying he's going to filibuster or block the SOPA bill that goes
[02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:07.640]  after the free speech.
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:12.360]  What's your take on the NDAA and the fact that the traitor media won't cover that Ron
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:13.880]  Paul is trying to repeal it?
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:17.120]  Well, I can refer you to Daily Paul.
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:20.480]  His total speech is on Daily Paul this morning.
[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:24.120]  Yes, in fact, we've got it in our article that Nemo did as well.
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:27.080]  We probably should have actually played that speech, but we've run out of time.
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:29.080]  We'll probably play it on the nightly news this evening.
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:35.640]  Boy, I tell you, have you found Wayne that that's a wake-up call that the NDAA actually
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:37.840]  passed the secret arrest of citizens?
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:47.880]  Well, again, it points to the people in power not caring about the people.
[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:55.080]  They're not representing the citizens of the United States and the citizens of the United
[02:40:55.080 --> 02:40:59.680]  States are going to change that this year.
[02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:04.600]  Yes, and despite the corporate trader media, I tell you, Wayne, we've been trying to come
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:08.160]  up with a name for the mainstream media because they're not the mainstream anymore.
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:10.720]  The alternative is now the new media is bigger.
[02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:15.640]  I've got a video out today showing major studies showing that, and I've known this for
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:16.920]  a couple of years.
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:21.960]  What would you call the prostitute, trader media, globalist media?
[02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:25.920]  A mudstream media.
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:26.920]  Mudstream?
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:27.920]  A surline media.
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:28.920]  There you go.
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:29.920]  Or muddle.
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:30.920]  Muddle stream.
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:44.520]  The listeners, we're all trying to come to the world for the best name.
[02:41:44.520 --> 02:41:48.200]  The mainstream media.
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:50.400]  Oh, boy.
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:51.400]  All right.
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:52.400]  I'm sorry.
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:53.400]  Go ahead.
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:54.400]  You're going to say something?
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:55.400]  No, no, no.
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:56.400]  That's all right.
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:57.400]  Now go ahead, Wayne, in closing.
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:04.760]  Well, I just want to say it's people like you and people that want honest, straightforward
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:12.400]  answers that are going to make the difference in this country in the next six months, and
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:19.760]  they will be their quiet revolution in terms of making sure that we get honesty in government.
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:21.640]  We get limited government.
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:25.040]  We get stronger military government.
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:30.840]  And that's going to take place regardless of what the mudstream media puts out there.
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:32.320]  The mudflame media.
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:33.320]  That's even better.
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:34.320]  There you go.
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:35.320]  All right.
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:36.720]  Well, great job, Wayne.
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:37.720]  God bless you.
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:39.680]  And say hi to Ron and the rest of the family.
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:40.680]  God bless you.
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:41.680]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:42.680]  Thank you.
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:43.680]  Talk to you again.
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:44.960]  It was great talking to you.
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:45.960]  Wow.
[02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:46.960]  What a great guy.
[02:42:46.960 --> 02:42:51.120]  It's been a pleasure meeting him at different activist events, protesting the Fed and other
[02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:52.120]  things.
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:54.000]  A great guy out there.
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.240]  Another chip off the Paul Blocks.
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:42:58.640]  Just a great family of people.
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:01.480]  And who else is standing up in government against all this evil?
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:03.200]  There's just a bunch of traders.
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:07.160]  I mean, I really think it's the trader media.
[02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:11.160]  The globalist occupational propaganda division.
[02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:13.880]  The zombie control media.
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:17.240]  The disgraceful media.
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:18.960]  The disgusting media.
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:20.760]  The teleprompter media.
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:22.960]  The globalist talking point media.
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:28.600]  The slime bag, scumbag, Judas Iscariot media.
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:34.120]  The filth media.
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:36.200]  The discredited media.
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:39.600]  The pompous know it all decepticon media.
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:43.720]  I mean, you can just go on, there's not enough names for this group of traders, treacherous
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:53.240]  scum, airheads, go along to get along trash, maggots, minions of evil, sellouts, go along,
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:59.240]  get along, scum, the cream of the scum, the scum stream media.
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:00.680]  You guys are all in there chomping at the bed.
[02:44:00.680 --> 02:44:02.180]  You got any names?
[02:44:02.180 --> 02:44:07.480]  I mean, we're just, we're seeking after the grail because there's such filth that there's
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:13.000]  not a name yet, the mudsling media, the mudstream media, those are good, but it's just, there's
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:17.880]  not something good enough, prestitute, that's good, but not good enough.
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:24.560]  Trader media, teleprompter media, what is it?
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:31.600]  Corporate public relations hack, poser media, the counterfeit media, the counterfeit media,
[02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:39.680]  the, the carpetbagger media, the con artist media, I mean, I don't know, just the enemy,
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:48.400]  the enemy media, globalist enemy media, they're not even media, just an enemy, it's like a
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:53.960]  tank with a, with a, with a loudspeaker saying, you know, stand up, you know, we are your
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:58.080]  friends and then you stand up and they shoot you, like Mars attacks, the ralions are running
[02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:02.560]  around with big loudspeakers laughing, like, don't run, we are your friends shooting people.
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:07.360]  It's a military operation, it's a globalist propaganda, it is the enemy, I mean, it's
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:14.360]  not like they've got some bias, these are scum, okay, and they've got giant stables,
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:18.840]  giant bevvies, a little prostitutes that just want to put their makeup on and act cool and
[02:45:18.840 --> 02:45:26.280]  climb the social trader, sycophant media ladder, who will just run around in giant mass just
[02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:30.680]  doing whatever they're told, just grobbling on hand in need of the system, so they can
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:35.720]  sit there in little fancy suits with makeup on, looking real authoritative, lying to zombie
[02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:37.720]  fluoride heads.
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:46.040]  Now, I'm in a busy beaver, I was on coast to coast AM last night, I did two radio interviews
[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:53.280]  this morning, I am doing the nightly news this evening, and I am going to do RT today,
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:57.640]  and you don't want to miss these shows coming up seven o'clock every evening, they're powerful.
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:02.160]  Now, here was one of our top stories today, because it deals with us, and it deals with
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:10.080]  infowars.com, tip of the spear, and all the things that the system has been doing to try
[02:46:10.080 --> 02:46:13.800]  to censor us, and shut us down.
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:19.040]  But there's an article that Paul Watson did this morning, because it hit me last night.
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:22.840]  Everything that Google says they're fighting and so, but they're already doing, they're
[02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:26.800]  already taking websites down under government request, they're already banning, they've
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:31.880]  already delisted us from most of their search engines, kicking us off the news feature
[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:38.080]  a few years ago, when Obama started running, you know, we've gone, I mean, they even deleted
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:44.000]  videos where we were bullhorning Schmidt, you know, the head of Google, at Bilderberg,
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:48.680]  I mean, they're censoring us, and I'm sick of it, you understand, they're already doing
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:52.320]  it, they just don't want the knuckle dragon government to have the control, because they've
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:53.680]  already got it.
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:56.680]  This article is important, and folks, they are trying to censor us, I hope you get it
[02:46:56.680 --> 02:46:57.680]  out to everybody.
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:02.920]  I hope you realize, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, the nightly news, the radio show, what we
[02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:07.440]  do, if the globalists have their way, you're not going to be hearing this, okay?
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:09.440]  This is real.
[02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:11.840]  The White House regulations are, it says they want to shut us down.
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:16.080]  I'm on the White House enemies list, I'm under surveillance.
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:20.600]  I'm doing this out in front of everybody, in front of God and the rest of the world,
[02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:25.880]  I'm out here calling these demons on the carpet, as child kidnapping, narcotics trafficking
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:28.880]  murderers, and they are.
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:31.640]  You're like, well, why have they killed you, because if they kill me, it highlights everything
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:36.680]  I've said, it puts an exclamation point on me, behind everything I've said, but you
[02:47:36.680 --> 02:47:39.400]  tell me, they can start shutting us down, they will come after me.
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:44.720]  They'll start shutting me down in the years to come, and throwing dirt and PR campaigns
[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:50.200]  ahead of it, and they'll set me up, kill me, whatever, but they still can't stop us.
[02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:54.080]  It's just individually, I'd like that not to happen, so I hope you'll continue to spread
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:59.040]  the word to your email list, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, everywhere, infoawards.com.
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:01.640]  There's a reason they've got armies of trolls after us.
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:06.880]  There's a reason the system is always demonizing, because I'm a symbol as well, of just an average
[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:10.480]  person saying I'm not going to take it anymore, and if they can tear down Ron Paul or tear
[02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:13.880]  down Alex Jones, they can tear down you.
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:18.040]  Like it or not, Ron Paul, Alex Jones, and a few others, we are what is representative
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:23.760]  of the Liberty Movement, I never even tried to become this prominent, I just am like a
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:30.200]  pit bull and I keep coming, so I've had incredible success thanks to your support, but we are,
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:34.880]  we belong to you now, you understand that, I am you, you are me, if they are able to
[02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:37.840]  do this, it's a bad day.
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:42.120]  If they take me out, who will take my place, that's another question.
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:45.600]  This article is important, I'm going to try to get to it.
[02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:49.200]  Google is already using SOPA-like censorship, and it's totally proven here.
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:54.480]  Web giant blacklist websites follows government orders to remove material, despite Google's
[02:48:54.480 --> 02:49:00.280]  much heralded support for the anti-SOPA movement, the web giant is already enforcing SOPA-like
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:05.520]  policies of its own, blacklisting legitimate websites from its news aggregator, following
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:09.320]  government orders to remove material from its search results in YouTube.
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:14.040]  We've also confirmed that they block our view counters going up, but then with establishment
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:15.560]  stuff they don't block the view counters.
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:17.240]  You've confirmed that.
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:19.680]  Before I was like, no, it's a normal caching issue.
[02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:24.240]  Yeah, they're covering censorship with that.
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:29.800]  As major internet giants joined forces yesterday to protest legislation that would hand the
[02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:34.520]  U.S. government power to arbitrarily seize websites with no legal process under the pretext
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:40.360]  of copyright infringement, Google slapped a black censorship image over its logo and
[02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:43.360]  urged people to sign an anti-SOPA petition.
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:46.960]  This was a crude over 5 million signees.
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:53.400]  However, Google's main issue with SOPA is seemingly not related to the concerns about
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:50:01.240]  Chinese-style web censorship becoming commonplace, but rather which entity gets to wield those
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:06.840]  powers, large transnational corporations or governments that are now footstools to them.
[02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:11.560]  While Google criticized SOPA publicly, it is already privately using SOPA-like powers
[02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:16.040]  to unfairly marginalize legitimate web content.
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:21.480]  Google News is a content aggregator that allows users to search thousands of news sources
[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:23.440]  for relevant stories.
[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:28.080]  Although the aggregator includes a plethora of obscene, occasionally offensive, and barely
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:33.880]  read websites, in November 2010, Google took the decision to delist PrisonPlanet.com and
[02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:37.760]  Infowars.com from its index news sources.
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:44.000]  Infowars.com alone is internationally recognized news website against more traffic than MSNBC
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:49.160]  and many other big sites combined, and innumerable other big mainstream news websites.
[02:50:49.160 --> 02:50:52.960]  Our articles routinely are featured on the Drudge Report, which itself is renowned as
[02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:57.440]  the primary agenda-setting news website in the United States, driving more traffic than
[02:50:57.440 --> 02:50:59.440]  the New York Times, Facebook, Twitter combined.
[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:01.440]  We'll be back with more.
[02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:06.240]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next
[02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:07.440]  disaster hits?
[02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:12.160]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after
[02:51:12.160 --> 02:51:13.840]  a big disaster strikes.
[02:51:13.840 --> 02:51:17.960]  You would be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now.
[02:51:17.960 --> 02:51:24.800]  123SurvivalPlanet.com has set up a for-patriots-only video with inside information on the 37 food
[02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:28.280]  items that will sell out first when the next disaster strikes.

[02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:39.800]  for any disaster, natural or man-made, and you won't have to be afraid of going hungry
[02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:42.400]  or being sent to a FEMA refugee camp.
[02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:46.800]  See the video that over one million other smart-patriots have already seen in the last
[02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:47.800]  four months.
[02:51:47.800 --> 02:51:48.800]  Prepared now.

[02:51:54.800 --> 02:52:04.600]  It's easy to remember 123SurvivalPlanet.com, again that's 123SurvivalPlanet.com.
[02:52:24.800 --> 02:52:36.280]  In a coming of part world, you need something to keep it tied together.

[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:07.840]  Introducing a diabetes breakthrough, an easy natural organic way to bring relief to diabetics.
[02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:12.160]  Introducing MDS Forte, a concentrated super strength extract formulated for those who
[02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:13.400]  are looking for relief.

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:54:01.560]  that's bestbloodsupport.com for MDS Forte, a diabetes breakthrough.
[02:54:01.560 --> 02:54:11.480]  Yeah, we all have stood together against soap up, but the real menace is lurking in plain
[02:54:11.480 --> 02:54:18.720]  view and it's the NSA, CIA created Googler.
[02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:26.720]  And it is a badge of honor that they've delisted us, but again, because routinely our articles,
[02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:32.040]  whatever was the newest and the most popular, it would kind of algorithm those two together
[02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:35.320]  and that would put you at the top and I guess they didn't like when there was a London bombing
[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:38.960]  that our articles were the top for a week being read by millions.
[02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:43.760]  I guess they didn't like that we were able to win, you know, you put us on the field
[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:47.760]  and with our analysis and understanding, we were challenging them.
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:54.200]  And so, bye-bye, infowars.com, bye-bye, prisonplanet.com, bye-bye.
[02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:57.640]  And Google is doing, people say, well, they're a private corporation, no, they've created
[02:54:57.640 --> 02:55:00.480]  basically a monopoly and they operate like it's free and fair.
[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:04.640]  That's why they're getting in any trust trouble.
[02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:08.640]  Continuing infowars.com alone is internationally recognized, but it's not listed.
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:13.600]  It's on XM, over a hundred radio stations, award-winning, you know, linked on the Drudge
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:18.720]  report, the number one new site in the world, not just the U.S., and it just goes on.
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:19.840]  None of that matters.
[02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:27.480]  They say we're not media because they're God and it goes on infowars.com, Alex Jones,
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:31.560]  the National Syndicated Radio host, his broadcast appears on every spending list of big radio
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:33.320]  stations across the country.
[02:55:33.320 --> 02:55:37.400]  Jones has been afforded to feature profiles on Rolling Stone, New York Magazine, many
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:41.640]  others, acknowledging the role as a pioneer in world media.
[02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:44.040]  Trade publications have said the same thing.
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:49.160]  Infowars.com is clearly a legitimate and important news website that features original content
[02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:53.600]  which routinely makes an impact and occasionally goes viral, goes viral every day.
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:56.680]  That's Watson being understated.
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:02.040]  And yet Google delisted the websites from its news aggregator on a whim with no explanation
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:06.600]  provided since Google and its owner, Eric Schmidt, are prominent financial contributors
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:07.760]  to the Obama campaign.
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:11.240]  We can only assume we were blacklisted for political reasons.
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:13.440]  They were shutting down videos of Schmidt at Bilderberg.
[02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:18.080]  And he's like, I don't want me, I don't want that on there.
[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:22.360]  Whether you concur with our political stance or are radically against it, what can't be
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:27.480]  argued is that we are legitimate news outfit, but Google has arbitrarily banned us from
[02:56:27.480 --> 02:56:31.440]  appearing on their news search results, but it doesn't stop there.
[02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:37.080]  There is a clear example of how Google is already enforcing SOPA-like rules of its own
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:38.080]  choosing.
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:41.080]  Now, the feds just order things delisted outside of court.
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:45.600]  Without the need for any law to be passed or by any legislative body, and it goes on.
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:51.080]  In addition, while concerns rage about the state obtaining the power to shut down websites
[02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:55.560]  and remove web content with no recourse, Google is already following, we have links
[02:56:55.560 --> 02:57:01.320]  to that, orders from the federal government in the majority of cases, removing videos
[02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:06.600]  from YouTube platform, including takedowns on the grounds that, quote, videos contain
[02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:08.400]  government criticism.
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:09.840]  Google admits that.
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:14.040]  Government criticism is taken down, and right there, that's it.
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:15.560]  Where's all the cause celebs now?
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:20.000]  I mean, this is already going on, and Microsoft and the rest of them helped the Communist
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.280]  Chinese censor their people.
[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:26.720]  Google-owned YouTube has complied with thousands of requests worldwide to remove political
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:32.400]  protest videos that are clearly not in violation of any copyright or national security interests,
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:34.520]  and do not constitute defamation.
[02:57:34.520 --> 02:57:38.560]  The number of takedown orders received from Google, from authorities, based in the United
[02:57:38.560 --> 02:57:43.120]  States, rose dramatically over the past year, with demands to remove information increasing
[02:57:43.120 --> 02:57:44.120]  by 70%.
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:49.200]  Yeah, they took down our Obama deception when one video had like 9 million views.
[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:51.280]  I threatened to assume it suddenly went right back up.
[02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:55.200]  I said, we know you took it down, it isn't a hack, I'm going to sue you.
[02:57:55.200 --> 02:57:59.960]  You got 24 hours, boom, right back up, because I guess they must tap my phone, the government
[02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:04.360]  or something, because I was calling the lawyers, I mean, they knew, and it went right back
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:11.400]  up, and I'm looking at suing you right now, I'm going to be honest, because you're sitting
[02:58:11.400 --> 02:58:16.200]  on us, you're blocking us, I don't like it, let me on the field, I'll clean all their
[02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:18.440]  clocks, but you don't want that, do you?
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:21.960]  You want to keep everybody in the dark, just like you want to block out Ron Paul.
[02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:27.240]  And it goes through just page after page of example of their wicked censorship, all bibliographed,
[02:58:27.240 --> 02:58:31.320]  that's why they hate us, because our articles are all documented, all right, I mean, compared
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:36.840]  to the corporate dinosaur devil media, our accuracy is off the charts, we try to tell
[02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:42.080]  the truth, and we're affecting history, so get this article out to everybody, use the
[02:58:42.080 --> 02:58:51.520]  internet or lose it, defend everybody, hang together, hang separate, hang together, hang
