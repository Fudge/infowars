[00:00:00.362 --> 00:00:00.942]  We've got it.
[00:00:00.942 --> 00:00:07.486]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:11.869]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:17.512]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:23.195]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:25.596]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:25.596 --> 00:00:27.697]  Big transmission lined up for you today.
[00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:32.318]  It is Thursday, January 19th, 2012.
[00:00:32.318 --> 00:00:35.119]  First month of the year is getting long in the tooth, long in the beard.
[00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:36.260]  Amazing.
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:47.124]  The father of free software movement, the guru of it, Richard Stallman, Dr. Richard Stallman, will be joining us coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:00:48.262 --> 00:00:51.876]  We're also looking at some other guests today.
[00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:56.905]  There is just so much going on, so much happening.
[00:00:56.905 --> 00:01:00.467]  This article has gone up at Infowars.com.
[00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:04.149]  We're all going to hang together, hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.270]  Google is already using SOPA-like censorship.
[00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.453]  It's just the megacorporations want this power themselves with government.
[00:01:11.453 --> 00:01:13.934]  They don't want government having the express power.
[00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:18.657]  And the way government was going to implement this would screw up some of the internet and was so ham-fisted.
[00:01:18.657 --> 00:01:20.038]  This article is important.
[00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:20.838]  Please get that out.
[00:01:20.838 --> 00:01:22.139]  We've got a lot of good news coming up.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.861]  Rand Paul vows to block internet censorship bills.
[00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:29.742]  SOPA and PIPA are a threat to free speech.
[00:01:29.742 --> 00:01:36.564]  He says Congress claims they're pulling out the bad provisions now, but that's playing possum.
[00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:40.505]  Let's see what they do next week with this vote and thank God for Rand Paul.
[00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:45.498]  And thank God for Ron Paul as well.
[00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:48.020]  Here's another article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:02:01.089]  Ron Paul introduced his legislation to strike NDAA's unconstitutional police state subsections that allow secret arrest of citizens, indefinite detention, torture, total war.
[00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:10.956]  And it's a good thing InfoWars.com and this syndicated radio slash internet video feed is going to millions of people because there's no news out there about Ron Paul doing this.
[00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:16.740]  There is almost no news out there about his speech.
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:29.571]  I saw the corporate traitor, dinosaur, prostitute, slime bag, make-up face, teleprompter, sell-out, globalist, zombie-controlled media.
[00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:31.392]  I gotta quit doing that.
[00:02:31.392 --> 00:02:32.013]  It's just, it's fun.
[00:02:34.156 --> 00:02:41.880]  So many names for that disease of traitors, and of scum, and of plague, that it's hard to stop.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.161]  That, oh, he went and did his futile vote against a debt increase.
[00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:47.382]  Yeah, futile.
[00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:52.304]  Futile to audit the Fed, passed the House last year from no sponsors ten years ago.
[00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:54.385]  And people have exposed the Fed.
[00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:56.226]  Oh, it's futile, Ron Paul.
[00:02:56.226 --> 00:03:02.609]  Oh, but never mentioning his real reason, his main reason, was to introduce legislation, to announce he's introducing it, I guess, today.
[00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.852]  To begin the repeal of the Constitution killing NDAA.
[00:03:09.852 --> 00:03:11.273]  And then we've got the really big news.
[00:03:11.273 --> 00:03:13.894]  I don't even know how to fathom this.
[00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:15.195]  We knew there was fraud in Iowa.
[00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.136]  We knew Ron Paul clearly was in first place.
[00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:21.978]  He was just right behind the other two scallywags.
[00:03:21.978 --> 00:03:27.801]  And now they're announcing in the news, finally Iowa tally gives Santorum edge over Romney.
[00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:29.922]  No winner declared.
[00:03:29.922 --> 00:03:35.787]  So, I guess let's have another gentleman's agreement to put Santorum, who's now in first, like they put him in second.
[00:03:35.787 --> 00:03:36.828]  And Karl Rove admitted that.
[00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:39.170]  We'll play that clip again coming up.
[00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.231]  And this is all over the news.
[00:03:40.231 --> 00:03:45.576]  The Des Moines Register mentions that, well, it's unresolved.
[00:03:45.576 --> 00:03:47.117]  Register exclusive.
[00:03:47.117 --> 00:03:52.122]  2012 GOP caucuses count unresolved.
[00:03:52.122 --> 00:03:53.443]  They're unresolved.
[00:03:55.484 --> 00:04:04.311]  But that's okay, because they're just going to give it to Santorum now, and there's no mention of Ron Paul.
[00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:07.773]  No mention of Ron Paul.
[00:04:07.773 --> 00:04:09.835]  This will make your head spin.
[00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:15.099]  In fact, I'm here reading these articles, they never mention him.
[00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:21.244]  And they'll even mention people like, like Genrich and Rick Perry, and people who aren't even in the race now, like Rick Perry.
[00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:25.115]  But they don't mention Paul.
[00:04:25.115 --> 00:04:27.059]  They're so scared!
[00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:29.724]  I mean, there's the evidence right there!
[00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:37.207]  So that's all coming up today, and then when the broadcast is over, obviously, we'll retransmit everything that was on the show today.
[00:04:37.207 --> 00:04:42.549]  But it all streamed at InfoWars.com and the free podcast that's up there.
[00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:47.631]  But if you're listening on a local AM or FM, that is the most important, because that reaches giant audiences.
[00:04:47.631 --> 00:04:48.991]  Stop your car at the red light.
[00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:50.152]  Tell folks to tune in right now.
[00:04:50.152 --> 00:04:58.375]  Whether you're listening in Albuquerque, New Mexico, or Dallas, Texas, whether you're listening in Orlando, Florida, or Rochester, New York.
[00:04:58.375 --> 00:04:58.955]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.871 --> 00:05:05.016]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[00:05:05.016 --> 00:05:09.160]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbor's.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.123]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[00:05:12.123 --> 00:05:18.611]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:22.353]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[00:05:22.353 --> 00:05:27.556]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[00:05:27.556 --> 00:05:29.096]  Your greatest dependency.
[00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:30.517]  Your food supply.
[00:05:30.517 --> 00:05:34.699]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.982]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.
[00:05:39.582 --> 00:05:40.002]  We're good.
[00:06:01.638 --> 00:06:03.340]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.647]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:06:08.647 --> 00:06:10.190]  Saving means to make money.
[00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:19.001]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:06:19.702 --> 00:06:27.244]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:06:27.244 --> 00:06:35.245]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:40.466]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:42.626]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:01.605]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:01.605 --> 00:07:07.187]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:07:07.187 --> 00:07:12.209]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:17.231]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:22.992]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:07:22.992 --> 00:07:30.114]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:07:30.114 --> 00:07:31.234]  And here's the best part.
[00:07:31.234 --> 00:07:37.596]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:41.099]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:44.202]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:07:44.202 --> 00:07:44.462]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:07:44.462 --> 00:07:47.905]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:07:47.905 --> 00:07:49.646]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:06.949]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:08.710]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.470]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.071]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:13.611]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:17.813]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.813 --> 00:08:27.876]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.876 --> 00:08:30.596]  We are live!
[00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:31.977]  The gates have opened!
[00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:35.963]  The Wild Buck and Bull has been released!
[00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:54.460]  We are transmitting worldwide on AM and FM dial over a hundred affiliates, XM Channel 166, Global Shortwave and audio streams at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as well as the PrisonPlanet.tv video streams.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:00.444]  And we are going to be here for the next three hours at least today.
[00:09:00.444 --> 00:09:03.926]  It is the 19th day of January 2012.
[00:09:06.667 --> 00:09:09.912]  And the quickening is obviously accelerating.
[00:09:09.912 --> 00:09:14.278]  And I've got a trillion different thoughts racing through my mind.
[00:09:14.278 --> 00:09:17.583]  I will attempt to control myself today.
[00:09:17.583 --> 00:09:20.647]  I will attempt to not explode in rage.
[00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:34.532]  And anger, but also in exaltation in the level of victories we're having against tyranny, but also in disgust at the victories that the control freak criminal gangs are having as well.
[00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:38.273]  It is the best of times, it is the worst of times.
[00:09:38.273 --> 00:09:42.734]  We have an unbelievable transmission lined up for you.
[00:09:42.734 --> 00:09:47.375]  Richard Stallman, free software guru of gurus,
[00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:55.757]  We'll be joining us to talk about SOPA and a lot more coming up for 30 minutes in the second hour today.
[00:09:55.757 --> 00:09:59.778]  Great job to the crew getting that set up.
[00:09:59.778 --> 00:10:04.279]  I also want to say great job to all the listeners and all of our affiliates and sponsors.
[00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:07.060]  We couldn't do this without you.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:14.522]  And it shows every day that there are a lot of good people in this country and that the majority of people want freedom and have courage.
[00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:18.543]  That we could be on over a hundred AM and FM stations.
[00:10:18.543 --> 00:10:22.045]  I just learned that for over a month we've been on a big station in Albuquerque.
[00:10:22.045 --> 00:10:25.606]  I just learned that for over two months we've been on another big station in Colorado.
[00:10:25.606 --> 00:10:28.767]  Another big one in California and in New York State and Florida.
[00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:37.610]  I mean we're just just exploding right now and getting in some areas number one in places like Orlando and other major cities.
[00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.871]  That shows you
[00:10:39.491 --> 00:10:47.359]  That the truth is hitting on all cylinders and people are really ready to wake up and really ready to hear the truth.
[00:10:47.359 --> 00:10:50.642]  That is so incredibly exciting.
[00:10:50.642 --> 00:10:54.705]  And I will try to live up to the responsibility I've got here.
[00:10:54.705 --> 00:11:00.431]  And I know a lot of people have jumped through a lot of hoops to get us on the radio locally in your area.
[00:11:00.431 --> 00:11:03.494]  I know that a lot of people have
[00:11:04.795 --> 00:11:12.963]  You've done a lot to sponsor this broadcast and support us over the years, and we owe it all to you, the listeners and supporters out there.
[00:11:12.963 --> 00:11:14.945]  You're not behind this show.
[00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:22.693]  You are beside this show, and in front of this show, and all around this broadcast of awakening and understanding.
[00:11:22.693 --> 00:11:23.954]  You are the key!
[00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:27.946]  To all of this.
[00:11:27.946 --> 00:11:31.188]  If there's a weak link, it is Alex Jones.
[00:11:31.188 --> 00:11:33.829]  And I've got my positive points.
[00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:37.012]  But I understand that I'm only human.
[00:11:37.012 --> 00:11:50.541]  It is the wisdom of the crowd and of Common Sense America and people across the world that have verified and supported our information and helped get it out to countless millions.
[00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:56.605]  And you are the reason this broadcast and everything we do is strapped on top a giant rocket.
[00:11:57.325 --> 00:11:59.147]  I mean, we are having a huge effect.
[00:11:59.147 --> 00:12:01.269]  Now, I'm done ranting.
[00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:03.051]  We have that big guest on SOPA coming up.
[00:12:03.051 --> 00:12:04.573]  We've got the latest on SOPA.
[00:12:04.573 --> 00:12:16.265]  We've got unbelievable breaking Ron Paul election 2012 news that is hiding in plain view and that no one is pointing out.
[00:12:17.031 --> 00:12:22.695]  That no one is discussing out there, not even on the big Ron Paul sites.
[00:12:22.695 --> 00:12:23.836]  And I don't blame them.
[00:12:23.836 --> 00:12:25.617]  This just broke in the last hour.
[00:12:25.617 --> 00:12:32.382]  I was in here getting ready for the show and I heard some of it on the local news radio we had on in the background.
[00:12:33.203 --> 00:12:39.066]  And on the TV, but it was Darren McBreen, our reporter, that walked in and said, have you seen all these articles?
[00:12:39.066 --> 00:12:42.267]  And I read them and the spin all came together.
[00:12:42.267 --> 00:12:46.309]  And it is so outrageous what they're doing.
[00:12:46.309 --> 00:12:50.711]  I'm going to tell you about that in a moment, but it's around Iowa.
[00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:52.932]  Then we've got the economic news.
[00:12:52.932 --> 00:12:55.473]  Kodak files for bankruptcy protection.
[00:12:55.473 --> 00:12:55.813]  U.S.
[00:12:55.813 --> 00:12:58.494]  losing high-tech manufacturing jobs to Asia.
[00:12:58.494 --> 00:12:59.935]  We've lost more than a quarter.
[00:13:00.808 --> 00:13:07.515]  Under globalism in just the last few years, Washington Post, this is like a success report card the globalists are putting out.
[00:13:07.515 --> 00:13:15.183]  Obama shut down that pipeline that would supply more gasoline, more oil to the United States from Canada.
[00:13:16.547 --> 00:13:23.909]  Of course, it'll now just go east, or I guess west in that case, to China so that they'll get that oil.
[00:13:23.909 --> 00:13:26.430]  They already get 80% of the oil that comes out of Alaska.
[00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.931]  Our own government blocks it.
[00:13:27.931 --> 00:13:31.292]  Vampire hedge funds are sucking grease dry.
[00:13:31.292 --> 00:13:35.133]  Just amazing news on that front.
[00:13:35.133 --> 00:13:38.674]  We've got some really good news from the Paul camp.
[00:13:38.674 --> 00:13:44.416]  Ron Paul has introduced legislation to strike down NDAA's unconstitutional police state sections.
[00:13:45.546 --> 00:13:49.387]  This got no attention anywhere.
[00:13:49.387 --> 00:14:00.169]  The corporate media, the only attention they gave Ron Paul, because I know I was up all last night on Coast to Coast AM and doing radio interviews this morning and I was tracking it.
[00:14:00.169 --> 00:14:08.411]  Nothing in the news about Ron Paul going back to Washington when the other candidates wouldn't think about it and voting against the debt increase.
[00:14:09.571 --> 00:14:13.113]  They reported on that and said it was symbolic and pointless and he's pathetic.
[00:14:13.113 --> 00:14:25.741]  They didn't point all the other stuff he did like introduce legislation to repeal the secret police, secret arrest, total war, end of habeas corpus, end of the constitution, NDAA.
[00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:29.664]  Radio, TV, print, silence.
[00:14:29.664 --> 00:14:32.225]  One guy happened to be watching
[00:14:33.226 --> 00:14:40.608]  The C-SPAN back there in the coffee room, his name's Kurt Nemo, and he wrote an article about it in the afternoon yesterday.
[00:14:40.608 --> 00:14:46.650]  There was a few articles from the controlled left like Huffington Post today, and I commend him for that.
[00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.851]  But that's big news right there!
[00:14:48.851 --> 00:14:54.693]  Ron Paul introduces legislation to strike NDAA's unconstitutional section 1021.
[00:14:54.693 --> 00:15:01.775]  It allows the military to operate domestically to black bag citizens, and of course, I think there should be more.
[00:15:03.938 --> 00:15:06.379]  And of course he says he's introducing the bill, it hasn't been introduced yet.
[00:15:06.379 --> 00:15:10.180]  Reportedly that's going to happen today or tomorrow, but hopefully he'll have the other sections.
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:25.667]  He just mentioned his bill would have that, to not say that the worldwide battlefield, without congressional approval, forget a declaration, not even approval, they can kill whoever they want, bomb whoever they want, invade whoever they want, because Obama is the new master of the universe.
[00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:34.239]  So you've got all of that happening with almost zero media coverage.
[00:15:34.239 --> 00:15:38.200]  Dinosaur, corporate, prostitute, prostitute media.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.582]  And we're going to be discussing that with, well, really somebody you could call the father of the free software.
[00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:47.518]  Free Internet Movement.
[00:15:47.518 --> 00:15:53.503]  The Obi-Wan Kenobi of it, Richard Stallman, will be joining us coming up to talk about SOPA.
[00:15:53.503 --> 00:15:59.728]  But something clicked for me last night while I was basically staying up all night.
[00:15:59.728 --> 00:16:02.330]  I did take an hour-long cat nap.
[00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.052]  That's why I'm so energized today.
[00:16:04.052 --> 00:16:05.993]  It's just amazing.
[00:16:05.993 --> 00:16:09.897]  Google is already using SOPA-like censorship.
[00:16:12.895 --> 00:16:14.515]  I want to break this down later.
[00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.716]  Google was set up with NSA and CIA money.
[00:16:17.716 --> 00:16:23.918]  You can just type that into the NSA search engine Google and you'll get Washington Post, MIT Magazine.
[00:16:23.918 --> 00:16:36.362]  But they're like how cute it is and how sweet sea cake it is and how much fun it is and it's no big deal and oh yeah the heads of Google go to Bilderberg and on and on and on.
[00:16:37.182 --> 00:16:42.047]  So why did Google black out its name on its website yesterday?
[00:16:42.047 --> 00:16:45.971]  Which was just kind of ceremonial.
[00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:49.054]  Without even linking to any information to explain what was happening.
[00:16:49.054 --> 00:16:53.018]  Like Reddit and Infowars.com and Wikipedia did.
[00:16:53.018 --> 00:16:54.739]  Very effective what Wikipedia did.
[00:16:54.739 --> 00:17:01.666]  I don't realize how much I use Wikipedia, even though it's questionable sometimes because it is open source, as you'd call it.
[00:17:03.604 --> 00:17:05.566]  But overall it's pretty accurate.
[00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:10.210]  Sometimes they put in there that I've died or they put disinformation in there about other people.
[00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.611]  But it gets corrected.
[00:17:11.611 --> 00:17:17.837]  And they kind of spin things and don't really have any of our accomplishments on there and cover a bunch of gossip.
[00:17:17.837 --> 00:17:19.359]  So overall it's distorted.
[00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:24.023]  But the general info on it, at least in the bibliographies, is very useful.
[00:17:24.023 --> 00:17:28.107]  And I realize with Wikipedia blacked out yesterday, how much I use it.
[00:17:29.411 --> 00:17:39.403]  Of course, I did put in a 22-hour day yesterday, but I probably, without even thinking, was directed there or linked there more than 30 or 40 times.
[00:17:39.403 --> 00:17:40.645]  I mean, I quit counting.
[00:17:40.645 --> 00:17:42.006]  And it was blacked out.
[00:17:42.006 --> 00:17:43.468]  And it was smart how they did it.
[00:17:43.468 --> 00:17:45.310]  You'd see the info for about two seconds.
[00:17:46.308 --> 00:17:47.129]  That you were looking for?
[00:17:47.129 --> 00:17:49.311]  Of course, I don't just believe what I read on there.
[00:17:49.311 --> 00:17:51.673]  I think I'll check the bibliography and go to the links on the bottom.
[00:17:51.673 --> 00:17:53.075]  But it is invaluable.
[00:17:53.075 --> 00:17:55.337]  It is the best encyclopedia out there.
[00:17:55.337 --> 00:17:57.219]  And of course, it's not 100% accurate.
[00:17:57.219 --> 00:17:59.001]  About 95% accurate.
[00:17:59.001 --> 00:18:02.244]  From my deep research, that doesn't mean I'm completely accurate either.
[00:18:02.244 --> 00:18:03.986]  But the point is, there's a lot of agendas there.
[00:18:04.446 --> 00:18:20.071]  But you could see it for about three seconds or so and you'd start to read the info you wanted and then boom it would cut to the black page and say, learn about internet censorship and this SOPA bill that will cripple freedom on the web as we know it, take political action.
[00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:23.032]  And Reddit had an effective deal as well.
[00:18:23.032 --> 00:18:26.433]  We just put a big banner at the top linking to some basic info about it.
[00:18:26.433 --> 00:18:28.774]  That's because we've beat this dead horse over and over again.
[00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.234]  We've done our job on this front.
[00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:31.975]  We don't just do it on one day, we do it every day.
[00:18:33.402 --> 00:18:37.727]  But everybody's missing the main enchilada here, the main boat.
[00:18:37.727 --> 00:18:38.868]  Why is Yahoo?
[00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:39.789]  Why is Google?
[00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:45.516]  Why are big globalist firms that are no New World Order, why are they against it?
[00:18:45.516 --> 00:18:47.999]  It's an internal fight in the system.
[00:18:49.161 --> 00:19:03.432]  Because they don't want a government with ham-fisted people having the power to shut down whatever they want whenever they want and blacklist people because Google's global and basically for all intents and purposes is a large part of the internet.
[00:19:03.432 --> 00:19:04.133]  I mean I'd call it...
[00:19:04.773 --> 00:19:06.475]  Several large organs of the internet.
[00:19:06.475 --> 00:19:10.258]  I mean, you take those out, it would really have some issues.
[00:19:10.258 --> 00:19:12.499]  And they're tentacled into everything.
[00:19:12.499 --> 00:19:16.423]  This is an internal, globalist, separation of power, power struggle.
[00:19:16.423 --> 00:19:19.765]  Something the founders said would hold back tyranny to a certain extent.
[00:19:19.765 --> 00:19:25.070]  Because they're always battling with each other like two hyenas over a baby gazelle they've already killed.
[00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.212]  And one's got a leg, one's got the neck, and they're kind of pulling it.
[00:19:28.212 --> 00:19:32.156]  One of them runs in and grabs some guts and drags those off into the bushes.
[00:19:32.156 --> 00:19:33.197]  Eyeballs are hanging out.
[00:19:33.977 --> 00:19:45.865]  So later, and I'm going to break this down, we're going to show you the total proof of Google censoring and doing exactly what SOPA does, like gangbusters on steroids.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:47.526]  That's all coming up today.
[00:19:47.526 --> 00:19:59.094]  But first, the unbelievable Ron Paul censorship, election fraud, huge scandal going on right now that is getting almost no attention.
[00:19:59.094 --> 00:20:00.935]  I mean, it's getting covered, but they're not telling you what's happening.
[00:20:01.055 --> 00:20:05.277]  Did you know that how well your brain works is directly dependent upon how well your gut works?
[00:20:05.277 --> 00:20:13.582]  Did you know that an inflamed or compromised digestive system directly contributes to poor focus, depression, irritability, attention deficit, and hyperactivity?
[00:20:13.582 --> 00:20:19.705]  By eliminating the inflammation in your intestines and by having good bacteria populations, you may enjoy better brain function.
[00:20:19.705 --> 00:20:24.287]  The most important protein your body needs to keep inflammation down is glutathione.
[00:20:24.287 --> 00:20:27.729]  The number one food to support a dramatic increase in glutathione production
[00:20:28.129 --> 00:20:28.830]  We're good to go!
[00:20:49.344 --> 00:20:51.304]  Call 888-988-3325.

[00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.211]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:35.774]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.774 --> 00:22:41.578]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:41.578 --> 00:22:45.220]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.942]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.942 --> 00:22:53.005]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:22:53.005 --> 00:22:53.246]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:54.647]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.770 --> 00:22:59.991]  We're good.
[00:23:03.257 --> 00:23:08.420]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.281]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[00:23:10.281 --> 00:23:13.823]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[00:23:13.823 --> 00:23:21.307]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[00:23:21.307 --> 00:23:25.809]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[00:23:25.809 --> 00:23:31.552]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[00:23:31.872 --> 00:23:33.673]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[00:23:33.673 --> 00:23:39.795]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[00:23:55.022 --> 00:23:57.963]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[00:24:10.475 --> 00:24:13.096]  You put him in control.
[00:24:13.096 --> 00:24:16.756]  And you put him in control.
[00:24:16.756 --> 00:24:19.937]  Watch him become a god.
[00:24:19.937 --> 00:24:22.498]  Watch him become a god.
[00:24:22.498 --> 00:24:26.719]  Watch your constitutional rights roll.
[00:24:26.719 --> 00:24:28.519]  Watch people's heads roll.
[00:24:28.519 --> 00:24:29.459]  Roll.
[00:24:29.459 --> 00:24:31.920]  Roll.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.120]  Roll.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:32.980]  Roll.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.881]  I know you're listening, Dave.
[00:24:36.881 --> 00:24:37.581]  I want to say hi.
[00:24:37.581 --> 00:24:39.402]  Sorry I'm butchering your great music.
[00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:47.607]  Just like the Pied Piper.
[00:24:47.607 --> 00:24:57.098]  You know, if you look at the whole Genrich thing that Drudge broke before ABC News even announced they were going to air the interview this evening.
[00:24:57.098 --> 00:25:00.462]  You've got the ex-wife who, she had cancer.
[00:25:02.379 --> 00:25:16.330]  And he came to her and divorced her, and then he told one of his top aides, reportedly, this has been out for years, but now she's speaking out, well, she's not good-looking, she's old, she's got cancer, I need a young, good-looking wife to get elected.
[00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:22.355]  I mean, even if you and your wife are getting along, when they've got cancer or whatever, you take care of them.
[00:25:22.355 --> 00:25:24.957]  And it just shows, this is a demon.
[00:25:24.957 --> 00:25:26.358]  This is a demon.
[00:25:27.739 --> 00:25:32.021]  And then he's got this new wife and she buys like a half million dollars worth of jewelry every few months.
[00:25:32.021 --> 00:25:36.083]  I mean, it's just... And then he writes books about being frugal.
[00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:37.364]  That's the thing.
[00:25:37.364 --> 00:25:44.367]  You want to buy a half million dollars worth of jewelry every few months for your wife to keep her happy because it's all this lobbyist money you got selling America out?
[00:25:44.367 --> 00:25:46.328]  Well, that's one thing, Trader.
[00:25:46.328 --> 00:25:52.771]  But to write books about being frugal and all this garbage when you're a little pimp who likes glitter bug stuff.
[00:25:53.717 --> 00:25:57.720]  And most of these globalists, that's how they are, they're into just petty junk.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.284]  These are such empty little chicken neck jellyfish.
[00:26:02.284 --> 00:26:04.686]  And again, I'm not saying things are bad.
[00:26:04.686 --> 00:26:10.910]  Comfort, security, you know, being able to travel, certainly.
[00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.312]  Access to good medical care.
[00:26:13.348 --> 00:26:20.390]  But it's always so many of the nouveau riche and others are just into the baubles and they worship the baubles.
[00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:24.992]  And it just shows how empty these people will sell their souls.
[00:26:24.992 --> 00:26:27.392]  They'll just fall down for money.
[00:26:27.392 --> 00:26:32.194]  Just fall over themselves to climb the globalist ladder.
[00:26:32.194 --> 00:26:32.414]  Okay.
[00:26:33.939 --> 00:26:57.639]  Coming up, Ron Paul introduces legislation to strike NDAAs, police state provisions, huge news, the latest on SOPA, in deep trouble, Rand Paul vows to block internet censorship bills, big economic news, that's all coming up, and of course, in the next hour, the father of the free software movement is going to be joining us to get into SOPA and a lot more.
[00:26:57.639 --> 00:27:00.041]  But right now, let me start getting into this.
[00:27:00.041 --> 00:27:01.463]  This is so big.
[00:27:02.369 --> 00:27:19.470]  That when I learned this this morning, I had Curt Nemo in here and I was talking to him about writing an article, and we were almost flummoxed by how insane it is, how big it is, and how it's just being reported like they're talking about the price of a canned ham at Safeway.
[00:27:20.225 --> 00:27:28.474]  I mean, it's like they're just mumbling, oh yeah, you can get some tires for this, or yeah, the weather was this, and kind of hot and balmy.
[00:27:28.474 --> 00:27:37.063]  Because I'm listening to local Fox News on local radio, I'm watching TV, I've got stacks of the news, and something's missing in this news I'm about to cover.
[00:27:37.063 --> 00:27:40.647]  The name, Ron Paul.
[00:27:43.103 --> 00:27:44.424]  And it was hiding in plain view.
[00:27:44.424 --> 00:27:45.664]  That's why I get angry.
[00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:49.246]  I'm in here listening to this, watching this, going, OK, Rick Perry's dropped out.
[00:27:49.246 --> 00:27:57.631]  OK, he's endorsing the globalist Mr. Carbon Tax, Genrich, Mr. New World Order.
[00:27:57.631 --> 00:28:01.633]  OK, they're now saying Santorum won Iowa.
[00:28:01.633 --> 00:28:04.175]  And Iowa's the big news, folks.
[00:28:04.175 --> 00:28:06.076]  Santorum won Iowa.
[00:28:07.554 --> 00:28:14.879]  But they're saying the results can't be used because there were so many problems and trucks lost full of the ballots.
[00:28:14.879 --> 00:28:16.580]  The ballots are called in, folks.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:22.604]  And there was a gentleman agreement to give Santorum more votes two weeks ago when all this happened.
[00:28:22.604 --> 00:28:25.485]  I mean, remember all that stuff we covered?
[00:28:25.485 --> 00:28:27.246]  So we knew there was fraud then.
[00:28:27.246 --> 00:28:30.208]  I told you two weeks ago.
[00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:32.370]  I told you it was going to be fraud days before.
[00:28:33.527 --> 00:28:35.690]  And we had Wayne Paul on, Ron Paul's brother.
[00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:39.153]  In fact, let's get Wayne Paul back on the last 30 minutes of the day, if he can do it.
[00:28:39.153 --> 00:28:40.375]  Or if not, tomorrow or Sunday.
[00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:42.938]  I want to get his take on this.
[00:28:42.938 --> 00:28:49.065]  And then Wayne sent some stuff to the campaign, and they said, oh no, we don't see any evidence of fraud in Iowa, you know, a day and a half out.
[00:28:49.065 --> 00:28:50.206]  We'll see what happens.
[00:28:50.206 --> 00:28:54.011]  It's because they want to take the high road, because the media will make them look like sore losers.
[00:28:55.763 --> 00:28:56.903]  I'm not beating around the bush here.
[00:28:56.903 --> 00:29:08.727]  I'm letting you know how our thought processes work, because it's important to understand how even the InfoWars operation doesn't see things that are so naked, that are so in plain view.
[00:29:08.727 --> 00:29:16.229]  But simply put, Nemo's got an article coming out very soon, InfoWars.com, and nobody else is reporting this, but I'm about to tell you.
[00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:21.524]  They're saying Iowa results can't be trusted.
[00:29:21.524 --> 00:29:23.345]  They're up in the air.
[00:29:23.345 --> 00:29:27.169]  The news there is reporting final Iowa tally gives Santorum edge over Romney.
[00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:31.473]  No winner declared because results from eight of the state's nearly 1,800 precincts are missing.
[00:29:33.835 --> 00:29:38.297]  Now, we told you this the day it happened, the night after, and we were kooks for saying it.
[00:29:38.297 --> 00:29:46.081]  But in here, they're still saying, well, just give it to Santorum, and there's no discussion of Ron Paul getting any delegates.
[00:29:46.081 --> 00:29:47.201]  I mean, this is big.
[00:29:47.201 --> 00:29:50.263]  They may try to steal his Iowa delegates.
[00:29:50.263 --> 00:29:51.643]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.643 --> 00:29:54.164]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.164 --> 00:29:56.846]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.837 --> 00:30:17.325]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:30:17.325 --> 00:30:21.007]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:22.014 --> 00:30:34.786]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:30:34.786 --> 00:30:42.053]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:30:42.734 --> 00:30:53.103]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:30:53.103 --> 00:30:57.026]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:30:57.026 --> 00:31:00.149]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:31:00.939 --> 00:31:05.084]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[00:31:05.084 --> 00:31:07.386]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[00:31:07.386 --> 00:31:09.228]  If not yours, your neighbor's.
[00:31:09.228 --> 00:31:12.211]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[00:31:12.211 --> 00:31:18.699]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:31:19.179 --> 00:31:19.559]  We're good to go.
[00:31:38.933 --> 00:31:39.233]  We're good.
[00:32:01.141 --> 00:32:07.785]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:32:07.785 --> 00:32:12.929]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:32:12.929 --> 00:32:21.655]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:32:21.655 --> 00:32:25.737]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:32:25.737 --> 00:32:27.679]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:32:39.813 --> 00:32:41.954]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:32:41.954 --> 00:32:43.734]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:43.734 --> 00:32:46.615]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:32:46.615 --> 00:32:50.676]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:32:50.676 --> 00:32:53.256]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:32:53.256 --> 00:32:55.957]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:32:55.957 --> 00:32:57.537]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:57.537 --> 00:32:58.318]  Got it.
[00:32:58.318 --> 00:32:58.818]  Others don't.
[00:33:33.993 --> 00:33:45.919]  Okay, so, here we are, and we told everybody up front that there was clear evidence of missing ballots in Iowa.
[00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:51.382]  And I mean, everybody said if Ron Paul's gonna get a fair shake anywhere, it's gonna be Iowa, because you've got...
[00:33:52.684 --> 00:34:08.055]  The 1,800 precincts, everybody raises their hand, you publicly count them up in front of everybody, and then a phone call is made to the Central Counting Office, and then those numbers are all published and it's all transparent.
[00:34:08.055 --> 00:34:11.357]  Instead, in some areas, they counted them in secret.
[00:34:11.357 --> 00:34:16.941]  They would call in the numbers, but then later say, oh, we didn't get the call, drive them to this location.
[00:34:18.416 --> 00:34:25.019]  And then people would just disappear, or they wouldn't be called in.
[00:34:25.019 --> 00:34:30.001]  All of this went on.
[00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:42.666]  So, we then found the clip on Fox News of the guy who was the architect of so much of the election manipulation in 2000.
[00:34:44.464 --> 00:34:45.245]  You can't deny that.
[00:34:45.245 --> 00:34:46.645]  It's not that I'm for Al Gore either.
[00:34:46.645 --> 00:34:53.870]  It's like, you know, two choices of the same poison, but Karl Rove is clearly a scamster.
[00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:57.732]  He's been caught many times doing different types of, you know, dirty deeds.
[00:34:57.732 --> 00:35:00.033]  Done dirt cheap.
[00:35:00.033 --> 00:35:11.060]  And he comes out on Fox News and says, well, there were some precincts that came up missing, so they just got in a room together as gentlemen and decided to give Santorum more points to put him in the second place, basically.
[00:35:12.366 --> 00:35:22.531]  Well now, weeks later, they just come out like it's no big deal and say, the results are in question, we don't know what we're gonna do.
[00:35:22.531 --> 00:35:27.474]  More delegates will probably go to Santorum now, and the rest to Mitt Romney.
[00:35:27.474 --> 00:35:40.480]  It looks like that Santorum really won, but it's all in question, but he won, and then no discussion in over a dozen news articles, national and local, about it.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.441]  Ron Paul's not mentioned.
[00:35:41.781 --> 00:35:46.043]  And I was shown an article a couple days ago by Rob Dew here, who runs the Nightly News.
[00:35:46.043 --> 00:35:54.345]  It was the LA Times admitting that they made the decision six months ago to not mention Ron Paul and to act like he can't win.
[00:35:54.345 --> 00:35:57.467]  Because they've decided he isn't a real candidate.
[00:35:57.467 --> 00:35:58.987]  They have decided.
[00:35:58.987 --> 00:36:00.828]  And he's in second place in most states.
[00:36:01.468 --> 00:36:04.130]  He's the only guy that's a constitutionalist.
[00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:16.699]  In polls, he's the best against Obama, but they have decided to give him 89 seconds in one debate, the CBS debate, or to kick him out of another debate, or when they talk about him to only be negative.
[00:36:16.699 --> 00:36:22.423]  There is the arrogance of these people, and this is big, big, big news.
[00:36:22.423 --> 00:36:27.527]  Finally, Iowa tally gives Santorum edge over Romney.
[00:36:27.527 --> 00:36:28.668]  No winner declared.
[00:36:28.668 --> 00:36:28.968]  News 14.
[00:36:32.884 --> 00:36:36.301]  The final results of the Iowa caucuses are in and there's a chance...
[00:36:37.546 --> 00:36:39.207]  And a change at the top.
[00:36:39.207 --> 00:36:42.690]  Rick Santorum edged Mitt Romney by 34 votes.
[00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:47.854]  Romney had been considered the winner after initial tallies gave him an 8-vote advantage.
[00:36:47.854 --> 00:36:58.242]  Despite the surprise flip, Iowa's Republican Party is not naming an official winner because results from 8 of the state's nearly 1,800 precincts are missing.
[00:36:58.242 --> 00:37:03.406]  The college towns, the Ron Paul supporter areas, Eames and other areas.
[00:37:03.406 --> 00:37:06.648]  GOP, or Ames, excuse me, GOP chairman
[00:37:07.771 --> 00:37:19.896]  Matt Straughn says he's congratulating both Santorum and Romney as he did the day after the Iowa caucuses.
[00:37:19.896 --> 00:37:24.357]  Straughn describes it as the closest contest in caucus history.
[00:37:24.357 --> 00:37:30.039]  Now there's no mention here of Ron Paul.
[00:37:30.039 --> 00:37:31.260]  The article goes on.
[00:37:36.161 --> 00:37:47.745]  For page after page, I have the news articles here, and there's no mention of Ron Paul, because they're lying by omission.
[00:37:47.745 --> 00:37:49.306]  Here's another one.
[00:37:49.306 --> 00:37:50.766]  A register exclusive.
[00:37:50.766 --> 00:37:53.887]  2012 GOP caucus count unresolved.
[00:37:53.887 --> 00:37:55.648]  Des Moines Register.
[00:37:55.648 --> 00:37:56.748]  And look at this.
[00:37:56.748 --> 00:38:01.270]  If you go pull this article up, or if you're watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv right now, look at it.
[00:38:04.272 --> 00:38:13.600]  It has the results, and it mentions no one but Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.303]  Gee, we'd like to know what happened with Ron Paul, who was just a few points behind.
[00:38:17.303 --> 00:38:19.245]  We'd like to at least hear about him.
[00:38:19.245 --> 00:38:23.168]  There is no telling what they are doing here.
[00:38:23.168 --> 00:38:24.109]  Here's another one.
[00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:28.173]  Final Iowa tally gives Santorum edge over Romney because of missing votes.
[00:38:28.173 --> 00:38:29.194]  No winner declared.
[00:38:30.424 --> 00:38:33.446]  The votes remain missing two weeks after events.
[00:38:33.446 --> 00:38:42.253]  So you've got the college towns missing, the places where Ron Paul was polling in giant double digits that would have pushed him over.
[00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:42.733]  Sorry!
[00:38:42.733 --> 00:38:50.119]  Some of the most populated areas where Ron Paul was dominating, like Ames, gone!
[00:38:51.112 --> 00:38:52.413]  Gone!
[00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:53.093]  Gone!
[00:38:53.093 --> 00:39:02.599]  And Karl Rove says, well, you know, they all met behind closed doors, some of the election officials, he won't mention who, and they met with Santorum and Romney, and they made a gentleman's agreement.
[00:39:02.599 --> 00:39:14.486]  I'm glad that they knew these votes were missing at like 5 o'clock at night, and that they just said, well, there was a gentleman's agreement, that's the way it is.
[00:39:14.486 --> 00:39:16.588]  So, that's the new America.
[00:39:17.669 --> 00:39:18.830]  Here's another one.
[00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:28.394]  Breaking Perry obviously drops out of presidential race, endorses Nudie Genrich, and guess who else endorsed Nudie Genrich?
[00:39:28.394 --> 00:39:30.895]  Sarah Palin.
[00:39:30.895 --> 00:39:43.200]  If you ever wanted to know about cutesy, little miss cutesy, little miss beauty queen, if you ever wanted to know what she's doing when she's not chasing professional athletes around,
[00:39:44.565 --> 00:39:50.731]  If you ever wanted to know what she's up to, well, you now know.
[00:39:50.731 --> 00:40:00.200]  Endorsing a guy who's known to leave his wife while she's fighting cancer, and to brag about how, well, I gotta have me a hot cutie to get elected.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.082]  Just cold-blooded snake.
[00:40:03.246 --> 00:40:12.474]  Right out of the pit of hell, who supports carbon taxes, open borders, socialist healthcare, gun control in the past, abortion, all of it.
[00:40:12.474 --> 00:40:15.917]  And don't send me emails, well he doesn't support that stuff now.
[00:40:15.917 --> 00:40:18.299]  Well yeah, because he's lying to you.
[00:40:18.299 --> 00:40:25.084]  I can play you clips all day of Mitt Romney, how great abortion is, but now he's telling you how horrible it is.
[00:40:25.084 --> 00:40:26.566]  They'll lie to you.
[00:40:26.566 --> 00:40:28.688]  And if you turn your back on them, they'll stick a knife in you.
[00:40:28.688 --> 00:40:31.290]  In fact, they'll stick a knife in you and tell you they're giving you a rose.
[00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:35.300]  And now it's coming out.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:51.009]  Newt Gingrich was exposed yesterday on the Drudge Report who broke that ABC News was having an internal debate over airing it, but it decided to air it on the eve, just a few days before the South Carolina primary.
[00:40:51.009 --> 00:41:00.195]  And now ABC, after being scooped with their own story, has come out and confirmed what Drudge is reporting.
[00:41:00.195 --> 00:41:03.217]  And that is, well you can read the quotes.
[00:41:04.414 --> 00:41:07.957]  There was a civil war inside the network over it.
[00:41:07.957 --> 00:41:10.999]  And now that's been confirmed by ABC.
[00:41:10.999 --> 00:41:14.522]  And she's going to come out and talk about how he said, look, I'm leaving you.
[00:41:14.522 --> 00:41:16.584]  You know, you're you're not good looking.
[00:41:16.584 --> 00:41:17.404]  You got cancer.
[00:41:17.404 --> 00:41:20.047]  I need me a young trophy.
[00:41:20.047 --> 00:41:25.051]  And they've got reportedly prominent aides and others saying, yeah, he just was cold blooded.
[00:41:25.051 --> 00:41:26.111]  They're like, why are you leaving your wife?
[00:41:26.111 --> 00:41:26.612]  That won't be good.
[00:41:26.612 --> 00:41:27.212]  Good political.
[00:41:27.212 --> 00:41:31.316]  He's like, look, I need me a pretty young thing for the voters.
[00:41:31.316 --> 00:41:31.856]  And you know what?
[00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:33.978]  A lot of the voters are shallow enough and evil enough.
[00:41:35.745 --> 00:41:55.171]  That, I mean, there's nothing better, and I'm not here judging people that have divorces or whatever, but it's the way Genrich did it, than to see Ron Paul up there with his cute old wife, you know, grandma bake you the cookies, you know, she's had heart problems and stuff, follows him around on the campaign trail, sticking with his lady for over 50 years, and all his children.
[00:41:55.171 --> 00:41:57.452]  You know, that's a life well led.
[00:41:57.452 --> 00:41:58.292]  That's a good thing.
[00:41:59.264 --> 00:42:02.686]  You say what you want about Mitt Romney, at least he's got the same wife and kids.
[00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:06.928]  Newt Gingrich, I mean, if you can't stay with your wife, that's one thing.
[00:42:06.928 --> 00:42:16.453]  But if you're running around from wife to wife to wife, and your ex-wives hate you enough to go on TV and talk about you, you're a nasty person.
[00:42:16.453 --> 00:42:19.314]  But again, that's not why I'd vote against Gingrich.
[00:42:19.314 --> 00:42:21.615]  That's bad enough.
[00:42:21.615 --> 00:42:23.056]  It shows the type of person he is.
[00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:28.664]  The issue here is that he's a globalist.
[00:42:28.664 --> 00:42:32.108]  I've read you his quotes where he calls for putting microchips in people.
[00:42:32.108 --> 00:42:32.448]  Don't believe me?
[00:42:32.448 --> 00:42:36.152]  Just type in, Newt Gingrich calls for putting microchips in population.
[00:42:36.152 --> 00:42:39.336]  He wrote stinking articles about it 20 years ago.
[00:42:39.336 --> 00:42:40.957]  He calls for the end of the family.
[00:42:40.957 --> 00:42:42.499]  He calls for global government.
[00:42:42.499 --> 00:42:45.803]  I mean, there's a reason the New World Order picked him out of a nowhere university.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.662]  And put him where he is, because he's a nasty little globalist.
[00:42:50.662 --> 00:42:53.264]  Part of this Luciferian Futurist Society.
[00:42:53.264 --> 00:42:56.986]  If you don't believe me, just go look it up.
[00:42:56.986 --> 00:42:59.187]  Tell you, he's a nasty one.
[00:42:59.187 --> 00:43:03.930]  He is a nasty, nasty, nasty little creature.
[00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:05.431]  Alright, I'm done talking about Newt Gingrich.
[00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:18.029]  Now, Mitt Romney may not leave wives who've got cancer and, you know, get him a new hot young thing, but Mitt Romney is for carbon taxes, abortion, gun control, open borders.
[00:43:18.029 --> 00:43:21.051]  I'm talking about his voting record, not his rhetoric.
[00:43:21.051 --> 00:43:28.554]  And you conservatives out there that want to vote for the pretty boy, you did the same thing with Obama.
[00:43:28.554 --> 00:43:32.576]  Sharp, slick, well-spoken, reading off the teleprompter like Mitt Romney.
[00:43:32.576 --> 00:43:34.277]  You vote for these Ken dolls,
[00:43:35.287 --> 00:43:58.832]  The only difference is what $3,000 suit they're wearing, and what color tie, and what is before their name, R or D. That's why the system is totally... I mean, there was an article yesterday where, in fact, let's pull this up, one of the new top officials in the Obama administration is the other former head of Bain Capital.
[00:43:59.684 --> 00:44:03.745]  He started and set up and run and he still owns a big part of it by Mitt Romney.
[00:44:03.745 --> 00:44:12.648]  It's come out today that he's got, that he pays 15% tax on average, when blue collar workers pay more than that.
[00:44:12.648 --> 00:44:13.748]  People are like, what do you mean?
[00:44:13.748 --> 00:44:18.629]  They tell me people that make, you know, working sums don't pay taxes.
[00:44:18.629 --> 00:44:24.211]  Bull, you pay the Social Security, you pay the FICA, you pay the unemployment, you pay all the other taxes.
[00:44:24.211 --> 00:44:27.612]  Do you know this lie that half the public doesn't pay taxes?
[00:44:27.612 --> 00:44:28.292]  That's a lie.
[00:44:29.693 --> 00:44:36.456]  It's about 25% of the public who's not retired doesn't pay income tax.
[00:44:36.456 --> 00:44:39.578]  But you pay all the other federal taxes that are there.
[00:44:39.578 --> 00:44:41.098]  You pay that gas tax.
[00:44:41.098 --> 00:44:43.840]  You pay the cell phone telecommunications taxes.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:48.762]  You pay when you fly in an airplane a security fee to be groped.
[00:44:48.762 --> 00:44:52.104]  Now they're saying for buses and trains they're going to start a security fee.
[00:44:52.104 --> 00:44:54.765]  The feds are talking about a new fee on gasoline.
[00:44:55.950 --> 00:45:00.212]  So they can set up checkpoints and feel your wives and your genitals.
[00:45:00.212 --> 00:45:04.833]  And I'm sorry to talk about these subjects, but it's going on.
[00:45:04.833 --> 00:45:07.454]  People get upset about talking about what TSA does.
[00:45:07.454 --> 00:45:08.875]  Let's talk about what they're doing.
[00:45:08.875 --> 00:45:15.177]  You know, I got to define what they're doing.
[00:45:15.177 --> 00:45:17.558]  This is the type of stuff that is going on.
[00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:23.253]  Alright, I've covered the Iowa situation.
[00:45:23.253 --> 00:45:26.457]  It's just no discussion of Paul.
[00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:31.642]  And okay, the election was a fraud.
[00:45:31.642 --> 00:45:36.147]  But all of this is going on and there's just no discussion of Ron Paul.
[00:45:36.147 --> 00:45:40.172]  You just don't even need to know where he is in the new tabulation that they admit to fraud.
[00:45:40.816 --> 00:45:52.360]  And we do have Ron Paul's brother, Chip off the old block, his younger brother, who's been for 40-something years fighting the globalists, out protesting the Fed, suing the IRS.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.521]  I mean, you talk about a real activist.
[00:45:54.521 --> 00:45:55.902]  I know the Paul family, folks.
[00:45:55.902 --> 00:45:58.583]  I know the whole deal.
[00:45:58.583 --> 00:46:04.365]  And they are basically prototypes of Alex Jones.
[00:46:04.365 --> 00:46:07.046]  They're basically G. Edward Griffiths.
[00:46:07.046 --> 00:46:09.467]  I mean, they're basically Bob Chapman's.
[00:46:10.452 --> 00:46:13.714]  I mean, that's who they are!
[00:46:13.714 --> 00:46:17.257]  One brother ran for Congress to fight the New World Order, and here he is today.
[00:46:17.257 --> 00:46:20.859]  I wish more people would have run for Congress about the New World Order.
[00:46:20.859 --> 00:46:24.842]  I guess Larry McDonald did, and they killed him better than a hammer.
[00:46:24.842 --> 00:46:31.847]  I guess Senator Hanson did, and they arrested him on income tax evasion, which turned out to be a fraud, and tortured him nearly to death.
[00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:33.990]  You ever seen the interviews with him?
[00:46:51.081 --> 00:46:57.223]  I want to get into it, but you know what sitting down does to your hind end for eight months.
[00:46:57.223 --> 00:46:58.584]  It's torture.
[00:46:58.584 --> 00:47:00.124]  Chained.
[00:47:00.124 --> 00:47:01.985]  They call it de-celling.
[00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:04.406]  And they taught him.
[00:47:04.406 --> 00:47:10.368]  So I guess there have been folks that came before Ron Paul, and you know what happened to them.
[00:47:11.491 --> 00:47:16.594]  So, we stand on the shoulders of a lot of dead bodies.
[00:47:16.594 --> 00:47:25.180]  You need to remember that a lot of people gave their lives, their treasure, their homes, their children, so that you would know about this.
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:25.941]  Take the Limburg.
[00:47:26.878 --> 00:47:27.658]  The Lindberghs.
[00:47:27.658 --> 00:47:30.739]  Mr. Lindbergh in Congress was speaking out against the Federal Reserve.
[00:47:30.739 --> 00:47:35.200]  And it's come out that they basically just grabbed his kid, killed it, and set up a patsy.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.441]  I mean, they don't play games, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:39.581]  The new order doesn't play games.
[00:47:39.581 --> 00:47:45.803]  We're going to get Wayne Paul to pop in for about 20 minutes to get his take on what's happening with his brother.
[00:47:46.923 --> 00:47:51.265]  Because obviously Ron Paul's gonna take the high road on all this because they would crucify him.
[00:47:51.265 --> 00:47:53.806]  It's admitted fraud in Iowa.
[00:47:53.806 --> 00:47:55.767]  But he's like, well, we did third place.
[00:47:55.767 --> 00:47:56.607]  We did pretty good.
[00:47:56.607 --> 00:47:58.068]  That's respectable.
[00:47:58.068 --> 00:47:59.629]  Yeah, second place in New Hampshire.
[00:47:59.629 --> 00:48:00.609]  There was fraud there.
[00:48:00.609 --> 00:48:02.810]  We got evidence of that.
[00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:05.811]  Truth is, Ron Paul's hotter than a pistol.
[00:48:05.811 --> 00:48:11.314]  He is hotter than the sun right now, and he is the real frontrunner.
[00:48:11.314 --> 00:48:14.415]  And they're just doing every bit of spin they can, so you don't understand that.
[00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:20.399]  The last domino to fall is for us to realize that he is really the frontrunner.
[00:48:20.399 --> 00:48:22.022]  He's been the frontrunner the whole time.
[00:48:23.263 --> 00:48:37.572]  I remember back in 2007 and 2008, when he was running for president, when he was in New Hampshire, he would go on local college radio and access TV because the media would not even give him attention.
[00:48:37.572 --> 00:48:40.954]  And he was getting pretty good numbers in those states, and they should have been.
[00:48:40.954 --> 00:48:43.255]  They were giving people less numbers, more attention.
[00:48:43.255 --> 00:48:47.257]  This time, they ignored him for six months or so, but the dam broke.
[00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:48.478]  They got discredited.
[00:48:48.478 --> 00:48:51.320]  The heat got so hot on them, they said, okay, we'll stop ignoring him.
[00:48:52.895 --> 00:48:54.836]  Call out the fake Ku Klux Klan groups.
[00:48:54.836 --> 00:48:56.597]  Call out people making fun of Asians.
[00:48:56.597 --> 00:48:58.918]  Attribute it all to him.
[00:48:58.918 --> 00:49:05.161]  Go through 20 years of newsletters and find the supplements that a company they hired to promote the newsletters wrote.
[00:49:05.161 --> 00:49:10.304]  Don't tell the public that 8 out of 10 of these passages are out of supplements and it's just mild stuff.
[00:49:10.304 --> 00:49:12.605]  Kind of extreme right-wing stuff.
[00:49:12.605 --> 00:49:19.849]  Never mind the fact that it's on record that he only wrote the financial section of it and had 14 published at one time every week coming out.
[00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:21.830]  Just say he hates black people.
[00:49:23.479 --> 00:49:29.383]  I mean, after all, they said Rand kidnapped women, worshipped Buddha secretly underwater, wasn't a doctor.
[00:49:29.383 --> 00:49:34.126]  It was a bunch of other craziness.
[00:49:34.126 --> 00:49:41.411]  They had people dress up in overalls and John Deere hats, literally, and run around with signs talking about black people and Hispanics.
[00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:47.155]  I mean, they're going to pull out every stinking trick they've got because we forced them to cover them.
[00:49:49.933 --> 00:49:55.037]  All we've got to do is get on the field and it's over.
[00:49:55.037 --> 00:50:00.621]  And I'll say it again, people are like, well, they'll probably still just steal it and we'll expose that they're stealing it and discredit them more.
[00:50:00.621 --> 00:50:02.622]  But he'll be there covering real issues.
[00:50:02.622 --> 00:50:04.684]  That's why we've got to go all in.
[00:50:04.684 --> 00:50:09.267]  If Ron Paul doesn't get the nomination, folks, I know he probably won't run third party if he did.
[00:50:10.268 --> 00:50:24.101]  He would just be there forcing his way into the debate and forcing his way into the staged event, the theater, of Mittens Romney and Barack the Sheepherder Obama with, you know, I mean both these guys.
[00:50:24.101 --> 00:50:30.947]  Romney, Romney, Bah, Romney, Obama, Obama.
[00:50:30.947 --> 00:50:35.551]  They're both Judas goats to lead their portal flocks over the edge of a cliff into a meat grinder.
[00:50:37.523 --> 00:50:40.024]  All right, now we got some good news for you straight ahead.
[00:50:40.024 --> 00:50:44.586]  Ron Paul introduces legislation to strike down the police state provisions of the NDAA.
[00:50:44.586 --> 00:50:46.406]  That's up at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:46.406 --> 00:50:54.049]  Rand Paul, with a double team out of the Senate, vows to block internet censorship bills, SOPA and the PIMPA bill.
[00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:55.930]  I call it that, P-I-P-A.
[00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:57.510]  And says they're a threat to free speech.
[00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:58.611]  It's all coming up.
[00:50:58.611 --> 00:50:59.191]  Stay with us.

[00:52:49.076 --> 00:53:05.889]  Emergency preparedness plans must include a fast way to start a fire.

[00:54:20.623 --> 00:54:21.463]  Yeah, I saw him.
[00:54:21.463 --> 00:54:24.224]  Yeah, they cornered him.
[00:54:24.224 --> 00:54:29.085]  I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot the deputy.
[00:54:58.837 --> 00:55:00.699]  Well that is some good stuff.
[00:55:00.699 --> 00:55:11.548]  We got to go back in between local radio in the morning cooking the kids breakfast and listen to Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings and Hank Williams the first.
[00:55:11.548 --> 00:55:13.029]  We've been listening to that for about a year.
[00:55:13.029 --> 00:55:14.110]  We go back and forth.
[00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:18.354]  We got to reintroduce the Bob Marley in the morning for a while.
[00:55:18.354 --> 00:55:20.636]  Because that is some good stuff.
[00:55:20.636 --> 00:55:22.597]  Some good breakfast time listening.
[00:55:22.597 --> 00:55:24.099]  We kind of go back and forth between
[00:55:25.185 --> 00:55:28.088]  Classical, reggae, and country.
[00:55:28.088 --> 00:55:31.953]  But we tend to get stuck on the country in my house.
[00:55:31.953 --> 00:55:37.059]  And I don't know, that Bob Marley's a good second, or maybe even first place, I don't know.
[00:55:37.059 --> 00:55:38.440]  Okay, in fact, I'm gonna ask my wife.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:42.125]  I'm gonna say, you were the iPod controller, just because you always turn it on first.
[00:55:42.125 --> 00:55:43.687]  Can we go back to the Bob Marley for a while?
[00:55:45.345 --> 00:55:47.686]  Okay, I am digressing.
[00:55:47.686 --> 00:55:49.386]  I am digressing here right now.
[00:55:49.386 --> 00:55:50.987]  It's just good poetry, folks.
[00:55:50.987 --> 00:55:52.208]  You gotta love it.
[00:55:52.208 --> 00:55:55.669]  So is Johnny Cash, and you know that's why we love it.
[00:55:55.669 --> 00:55:58.090]  Because life is all about poetry.
[00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:05.272]  And words are the meaning of things.
[00:56:05.272 --> 00:56:07.633]  Wow, both of these are good news.
[00:56:07.633 --> 00:56:10.874]  Rand Paul vows to block internet censorship bills.
[00:56:10.874 --> 00:56:12.555]  Who else is fighting tyranny in Congress?
[00:56:14.122 --> 00:56:17.364]  SOPA and PIPA are a threat to free speech.
[00:56:17.364 --> 00:56:29.410]  Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul has promised to do everything within his power to ensure the Draconian IP Act and the Stop Online Privacy Act are not brought to a vote.
[00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:35.693]  Paul says he will filibuster the PIPA in the Senate owing to the fact that the bill is a direct threat to the First Amendment.
[00:56:37.116 --> 00:56:37.436]  I don't know.
[00:56:54.358 --> 00:56:56.519]  They're going to come back like cockroaches.
[00:56:56.519 --> 00:56:58.339]  You've got to keep the pressure on them.
[00:56:58.339 --> 00:56:59.760]  That's how you win a war.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.720]  For liberty, for freedom, for anything.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.141]  That's why the globalists always pressure.
[00:57:04.141 --> 00:57:06.062]  And when they don't find resistance, they back off.
[00:57:06.062 --> 00:57:09.183]  As soon as we don't resist, they push back again.
[00:57:09.183 --> 00:57:12.084]  People are like, gee, we've got to fight all the time.
[00:57:12.084 --> 00:57:14.285]  Liberty is an eternal fight.
[00:57:14.285 --> 00:57:16.705]  Raising your kids right is an eternal fight.
[00:57:16.705 --> 00:57:18.186]  Getting up in the morning.
[00:57:18.186 --> 00:57:19.586]  It just happens over and over again.
[00:57:19.586 --> 00:57:21.327]  People think everything's just supposed to be easy.
[00:57:22.611 --> 00:57:24.532]  The truth is it's fun to fight tyrants.
[00:57:24.532 --> 00:57:27.374]  You've got to make it a game.
[00:57:27.374 --> 00:57:29.896]  You realize how much fun it is to route these people.
[00:57:29.896 --> 00:57:32.277]  We can really route the daylights out of them.
[00:57:32.277 --> 00:57:50.229]  The problem is if we really run them back in their holes for a long period, drive them underground for a long time, we'll get so much prosperity, like we did before, that we'll get laughed at by our grandkids about caring about freedom when we save their hind ends, if we're able to do it.
[00:57:50.229 --> 00:57:50.950]  That's the problem.
[00:57:51.806 --> 00:57:57.207]  When you give people liberty, they only appreciate it for a generation or so, and that's the problem.
[00:57:57.207 --> 00:58:04.609]  You don't want tyranny, but when you defeat it for a while, everybody kind of forgets.
[00:58:04.609 --> 00:58:08.130]  And then the criminals creep back in, and are careful about it.
[00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:12.171]  And the criminals kind of got wild for a while, and that's why they're really in trouble.
[00:58:12.171 --> 00:58:14.572]  I cannot state to you how big the awakening is right now.
[00:58:15.916 --> 00:58:17.297]  NDAA coming to pass.
[00:58:17.297 --> 00:58:20.358]  All this stuff happening is really waking people up.
[00:58:20.358 --> 00:58:23.219]  I was on Coast to Coast AM last night and George Norrie totally agreed.
[00:58:23.219 --> 00:58:24.059]  His listeners agreed.
[00:58:24.059 --> 00:58:26.200]  I mean, it is on.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:29.382]  George said, I feel like that wall against evil is building.
[00:58:29.382 --> 00:58:30.922]  It's getting stronger, Alex.
[00:58:30.922 --> 00:58:33.003]  And I agree with his eloquent words.
[00:58:33.003 --> 00:58:38.265]  Alright, we'll tell you about Ron Paul introduces legislation to strike NDAA's unconstitutional section.
[00:58:38.265 --> 00:58:39.846]  Then we've got somebody coming up.
[00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:47.655]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:55.214 --> 00:58:56.475]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:56.475 --> 00:59:00.396]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:59:00.396 --> 00:59:02.797]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.797 --> 00:59:08.499]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:08.499 --> 00:59:15.182]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:15.182 --> 00:59:21.124]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:24.786]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:59:25.326 --> 00:59:29.607]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.607 --> 00:59:35.568]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:35.568 --> 00:59:39.109]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:41.089]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:42.210]  It's here.
[00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:49.011]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.996 --> 00:59:56.381]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.381 --> 00:59:59.166]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.799 --> 01:00:10.640]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.241]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:13.761]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.761 --> 01:00:17.962]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.962 --> 01:00:22.083]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.205 --> 01:00:42.943]  Alright, we've got Dr. Richard Stallman, Free Software Guru Supreme, joining us to talk about SOPA, the Internet, and a lot more.
[01:00:44.301 --> 01:00:51.886]  It's good to have somebody who's kind of the archetypal opposite of Senator Ted Stevens, who thought the internet was a bunch of tubes that physical mail was delivered on.
[01:00:51.886 --> 01:00:54.988]  He's now gone off to Valhalla.
[01:00:54.988 --> 01:00:56.349]  So that's coming up.
[01:00:56.349 --> 01:01:00.552]  We've got breaking news up at Infowars.com.
[01:01:00.552 --> 01:01:05.195]  If you go to the Stop SOPA, Join the Fight, click here now.
[01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:11.679]  We have the article from yesterday, but I'm going to have that link changed to Paul Watson's article that is linked in red.
[01:01:12.199 --> 01:01:16.323]  Google is already using SOPA-like censorship.
[01:01:16.323 --> 01:01:18.624]  And I want to point that out.
[01:01:18.624 --> 01:01:22.468]  That it's happening to us, it's happening to others, and it's certified, and the proof is all there.
[01:01:22.468 --> 01:01:24.049]  This is a big deal.
[01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:30.594]  The power structure is fighting with itself right now, and basically wants Google to be able to censor people, not the government.
[01:01:30.594 --> 01:01:31.835]  But Google's already doing it.
[01:01:31.835 --> 01:01:32.796]  We've got the proof right there.
[01:01:32.796 --> 01:01:33.477]  I'm going to cover that.
[01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.320]  Coming up later in the hour.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.544]  But we need to get this article out to everyone.
[01:01:39.544 --> 01:01:44.451]  Google is already using SOPA like censorship and it's got all the proof.
[01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:47.274]  And guess who one of the main big fat targets is?
[01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:49.617]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:49.617 --> 01:01:50.579]  Gee, I wonder why.
[01:01:50.899 --> 01:01:54.441]  Because they're growing exponentially, like insane gangbusters.
[01:01:54.441 --> 01:01:57.503]  Thanks to you, the listeners, and others out there.
[01:01:57.503 --> 01:02:04.166]  People like Matt Drudge, who links to us routinely, because he's a real researcher and journalist, understands we're breaking a lot of news.
[01:02:04.166 --> 01:02:06.627]  So, there it is, right there.
[01:02:06.627 --> 01:02:09.009]  And we're swimming upstream, just like Ron Paul.
[01:02:09.009 --> 01:02:10.369]  They're trying to black us out.
[01:02:10.369 --> 01:02:12.070]  They're trying to censor us.
[01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:14.872]  All this is going on, and the article proves it all.
[01:02:14.872 --> 01:02:16.293]  We'll be breaking it down later.
[01:02:16.293 --> 01:02:18.134]  We're also going to premiere a video here.
[01:02:18.894 --> 01:02:21.857]  That deals with the fact that we are winning.
[01:02:21.857 --> 01:02:22.718]  Viral video.
[01:02:22.718 --> 01:02:23.779]  Resistance is victory.
[01:02:23.779 --> 01:02:24.940]  The tide is turning.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:27.882]  And of course, I shot this video a few days ago.
[01:02:27.882 --> 01:02:29.684]  Aaron did an incredible job adding all the documents.
[01:02:29.684 --> 01:02:33.147]  There's one error in the video, thanks to me.
[01:02:33.147 --> 01:02:41.075]  I said, they want to make us use fluorescent headache-inducing light bulbs instead of the beautiful phosphorescent.
[01:02:41.075 --> 01:02:44.338]  After I watched the video, I said, it's incandescent is what they're banning.
[01:02:45.322 --> 01:02:54.347]  Phosphorescent is a subgroup, which is like day-glow green, or what jellyfish glow with, of fluorescent.
[01:02:54.347 --> 01:02:55.247]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:02:55.247 --> 01:02:59.670]  It's just that when I find mistakes, you better believe I'm going to tell you when I make them.
[01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:09.595]  Because I know incandescent is the difference between the, you know, you got halogen, you got incandescent, you've got all the different types of fluorescent.
[01:03:10.779 --> 01:03:17.460]  And I know that, but then I correct it, and it's almost even pointless, but I'm going to correct it.
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.401]  Can't change the video, though, but it's a very small point.
[01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:22.742]  No one even noticed it in the comments, but I did.
[01:03:22.742 --> 01:03:24.682]  Viral video, Resistance is Victory.
[01:03:24.682 --> 01:03:26.703]  It's up at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:26.703 --> 01:03:27.543]  The tide is turning.
[01:03:27.543 --> 01:03:33.224]  The video's there for all the radio listeners, but I'm going to premiere the audio and video here coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:38.156]  And there's now been a new Supreme Court ruling.
[01:03:38.156 --> 01:03:42.999]  Supreme Court rules Congress can re-copyright public domain works.
[01:03:42.999 --> 01:03:50.283]  Congress may take books, musical compositions, and other works out of the public domain where they can be freely used and adapted and grant them copyright status.
[01:03:50.283 --> 01:03:53.785]  So I guess they're saying a King James Bible that's 600 years old or whatever, 550.
[01:03:53.785 --> 01:03:56.527]  I've been hearing about this case.
[01:03:56.527 --> 01:03:57.807]  I guess they did it.
[01:03:57.807 --> 01:03:58.548]  So I guess they can take
[01:03:59.944 --> 01:04:11.826]  Oliver Twist, or they can take Tale of Two Cities, stuff that's been, or I guess they can take The Little Mermaid, Hans Christensen or whatever his name is, and I guess they can just re-copyright it and give it to whoever they want.
[01:04:11.826 --> 01:04:20.348]  Unbelievable attack on the free flow of information, because they always use this not to protect the copyright 100 years after somebody's dead.
[01:04:20.348 --> 01:04:21.829]  They do it to stifle information.
[01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:24.849]  That's what China and Russia is trying to pass censorship garbage.
[01:04:24.849 --> 01:04:27.030]  This stuff's happening worldwide, man.
[01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.630]  The crooks are the same everywhere.
[01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:36.045]  And they figure out the best trick to bamboozle somebody and they use it and it makes me want to throw up.
[01:04:36.045 --> 01:04:38.651]  Alright, we've got Richard Stallman, Free Software.
[01:04:39.995 --> 01:04:46.238]  Icon, guru, whatever you want to call it, Obi-Wan Kenobi of Free Software Movement.
[01:04:46.238 --> 01:04:53.300]  And we've got Ron Paul's brother coming up on the latest Iowa fraud as they're saying, don't count the vote now, Ron Paul doesn't exist.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:58.482]  And we've got Ron Paul fighting the NDAA secret arrest provisions with no media coverage of that.
[01:04:58.482 --> 01:04:59.643]  It's all coming up, stay with us.
[01:05:02.185 --> 01:05:03.907]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.907 --> 01:05:09.211]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:09.211 --> 01:05:10.752]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:10.752 --> 01:05:19.520]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:27.786]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:27.786 --> 01:05:35.812]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:35.812 --> 01:05:41.035]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:05:41.035 --> 01:05:43.197]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:05:45.959 --> 01:05:49.183]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.

[01:05:51.545 --> 01:05:53.688]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:05.001]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[01:06:05.001 --> 01:06:07.283]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[01:06:07.283 --> 01:06:09.125]  If not yours, your neighbor's.
[01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:12.108]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off.
[01:06:12.108 --> 01:06:18.596]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:06:19.096 --> 01:06:22.338]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[01:06:22.338 --> 01:06:27.541]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[01:06:27.541 --> 01:06:28.802]  Your greatest dependency.
[01:06:28.802 --> 01:06:30.483]  Your food supply.
[01:06:30.483 --> 01:06:34.686]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[01:06:34.686 --> 01:06:38.969]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.
[01:06:39.309 --> 01:06:40.010]  We're good.
[01:07:00.424 --> 01:07:04.967]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:07:04.967 --> 01:07:05.887]  Number one.
[01:07:05.887 --> 01:07:09.310]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:10.170]  Number two.
[01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:15.053]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:15.053 --> 01:07:15.794]  It's true.
[01:07:15.794 --> 01:07:20.677]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.677 --> 01:07:21.497]  Number three.
[01:07:21.497 --> 01:07:25.080]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.782]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.982 --> 01:07:29.783]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.783 --> 01:07:32.545]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.545 --> 01:07:36.229]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:36.229 --> 01:07:37.010]  Number 5.
[01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:41.173]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:41.173 --> 01:07:45.938]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:46.198 --> 01:07:50.381]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:52.162]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:52.162 --> 01:07:54.403]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:54.403 --> 01:08:02.728]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:08:02.728 --> 01:08:09.352]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:12.354]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:21.976]  Okay, my friends, we've got a real treat for you.
[01:08:21.976 --> 01:08:30.523]  There's, they talk about the top 10 people out there in internet land and who've really changed, you know, our perspective on so many things.
[01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:32.604]  It's Dr. Richard Stallman.
[01:08:32.604 --> 01:08:35.207]  He's a software developer and software freedom activist.
[01:08:35.207 --> 01:08:42.012]  He graduated from Harvard in 74 with a BA in physics and received many awards, doctorates, and professorships for extensive work.
[01:08:42.012 --> 01:08:47.557]  In January of 84, he resigned from MIT to start the GNU operating system, or GNU.
[01:08:48.317 --> 01:08:53.099]  ...meant to be entirely free software and has been the project leader ever since.
[01:08:53.099 --> 01:08:57.661]  Dr. Stallman also launched the Free Software Movement in October of 85.
[01:08:57.661 --> 01:09:00.082]  He started the Free Software Foundation.
[01:09:00.082 --> 01:09:03.664]  And thank God, because nothing would work if we were running off Microsoft still.
[01:09:03.664 --> 01:09:05.325]  And I don't know anything about Internet, and I know that.
[01:09:06.325 --> 01:09:15.350]  And in 1999, Stallman called for development of free online encyclopedia through the means of inviting the public to contribute articles.
[01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:18.372]  So he was the presenter of Wikipedia.
[01:09:18.372 --> 01:09:27.117]  During his college years, he also worked as a staff hacker at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, learning operating system development by doing it.
[01:09:27.117 --> 01:09:29.839]  Stallman pioneered the concept of copy left.
[01:09:30.539 --> 01:09:36.743]  And is the main author of the GNU General Public License, the most widely used free software license.
[01:09:36.743 --> 01:09:50.391]  This is why, since the mid-90s, Stallman has spent most of his time in political advocacy for free software and spreading the ethical ideas of the movement, as well as campaigning against both software patents and dangerous extensions of copyright laws.
[01:09:50.391 --> 01:09:51.892]  That's why he's probably the best guest
[01:09:52.532 --> 01:09:55.957]  We can get on, you know, to discuss Russia, China, the U.S.
[01:09:55.957 --> 01:10:01.344]  They're all using copyright and later admitting they're using it to shut down free speech.
[01:10:01.344 --> 01:10:08.795]  SOPA is just one manifestation of this, and this monster's receding for now, but is guaranteed to come back very soon, in fact, in a few weeks.
[01:10:09.295 --> 01:10:16.178]  Here's the Associated Press, Supreme Court rules Congress can re-copyright public domain works that have been out for hundreds of years.
[01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:18.139]  This is amazing.
[01:10:18.139 --> 01:10:30.404]  And so here to break down the different horrors of the expansion of copyright to where you can't even use words now, they're saying, is a professor and Dr. Stallman.
[01:10:30.404 --> 01:10:32.946]  Thank you for coming on with us, sir.
[01:10:32.946 --> 01:10:33.686]  Hello.
[01:10:33.686 --> 01:10:34.766]  Hello.
[01:10:34.766 --> 01:10:35.827]  Well, let's go over it.
[01:10:35.827 --> 01:10:37.948]  I mean, what do you make of what's happening right now?
[01:10:38.831 --> 01:10:43.594]  Well, I haven't read any details about today's Supreme Court decision.
[01:10:43.594 --> 01:10:46.276]  I haven't seen that yet.
[01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:56.743]  But previously, other Supreme Court decisions said it was unconstitutional to re-copyright anything that was in the public domain.
[01:10:56.743 --> 01:11:01.186]  But this is a very pro-business Supreme Court.
[01:11:01.186 --> 01:11:04.669]  We can't trust it to protect human rights.
[01:11:05.478 --> 01:11:15.985]  They're going to give those human rights to corporations and protect the rights of corporations, but not the rights of humans in any practical sense.
[01:11:15.985 --> 01:11:17.766]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:17.766 --> 01:11:26.231]  What got you started developing the ideas that have become the free software movement that you kicked off?
[01:11:26.231 --> 01:11:32.035]  I lived in a free software community in the 1970s, although we didn't use that term.
[01:11:32.782 --> 01:11:42.145]  When I was working at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT, it was part of a community where we shared the software that we developed.
[01:11:42.145 --> 01:11:55.308]  And all the software that we used was the software of the community, and we were happy to share it with anyone who was interested in it, and we hoped that if they improved that they would share it back, and often they did.
[01:11:55.308 --> 01:11:57.309]  But this community died in the early 80s.
[01:11:58.542 --> 01:12:16.691]  Leaving me face-to-face with the proprietary software world, which is the way everyone else was using the software, and by comparison to the life of freedom that I was used to, proprietary software was ugly, morally ugly.
[01:12:16.691 --> 01:12:19.132]  So, I balked at that.
[01:12:19.132 --> 01:12:23.434]  I said, I am not going to accept the life of proprietary software.
[01:12:23.434 --> 01:12:26.296]  I would be ashamed of my life if I did that.
[01:12:27.213 --> 01:12:32.558]  So I decided to build a new free software community.
[01:12:32.558 --> 01:12:41.667]  Since the old one was based on software for obsolete computers, it was necessary to start again from scratch.
[01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:47.193]  So I launched that project, and now there are free operating systems.
[01:12:47.193 --> 01:12:50.977]  Now it's just barely possible to use computers
[01:12:51.730 --> 01:12:57.955]  And not be subjugated by software developers of non-free software.
[01:12:57.955 --> 01:13:04.240]  But expanding that with just basic text copyright, take Righthaven, they've been absolutely destroyed in court.
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:15.889]  They sued a lot of people across the spectrum for even taking a paragraph in a comment board where it was clearly a third party that had even done it,
[01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:19.351]  And they were backed by the Associated Press and others.
[01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:38.566]  I mean, that is really creepy to have the Associated Press and others actually suing, you know, quadriplegics and community activist groups helping homeless people because they had one paragraph of their article and clearly were discussing, in many cases, their own
[01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:39.647]  Well, you know...
[01:13:52.133 --> 01:13:59.999]  They may, if they went to court, they might win, that is the defendants might win on the grounds of fair use.
[01:13:59.999 --> 01:14:06.845]  The problem is it's hard to tell in advance and it costs you a lot of money to go to court and find out.
[01:14:06.845 --> 01:14:15.412]  So those people probably didn't have enough money to stand up for their, what are possibly their rights, plausibly their rights.
[01:14:15.412 --> 01:14:19.936]  But because of the way fair use is defined in copyright law,
[01:14:21.718 --> 01:14:24.420]  It's not a clear permission.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:31.066]  It's a rather vaguely drawn defense against charges of copyright infringement.
[01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:39.753]  Case by case, shifting gears overall, specifically on SOPA, is it heartening for you to see the big blackouts?
[01:14:39.753 --> 01:14:41.134]  It is.
[01:14:41.134 --> 01:14:43.316]  And what this means is that
[01:14:44.071 --> 01:14:49.874]  We can sometimes defeat the copyright lobby when it demands increased power.
[01:14:49.874 --> 01:14:52.975]  Of course, we haven't defeated them yet.
[01:14:52.975 --> 01:14:58.697]  We are at least coming close to defeating them, and maybe we'll defeat them.
[01:14:58.697 --> 01:15:07.021]  But everybody listening to this, you've got to phone your senators today, because they're going to vote next week.
[01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:18.459]  So, but at least, even if we don't actually defeat them, we've mounted a campaign that will have come fairly close.
[01:15:18.459 --> 01:15:21.621]  This is the first time it's been such a fight.
[01:15:21.621 --> 01:15:37.314]  When the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was passed, the law that censors software that you can use to decode encrypted publications, that you can use to break digital handcuffs, that was passed
[01:15:38.576 --> 01:15:43.278]  In the House of Representatives without an explicit vote.
[01:15:43.278 --> 01:15:46.079]  It was considered totally uncontroversial.
[01:15:46.079 --> 01:15:50.240]  There were just a few of us saying that this is an injustice.
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:16:01.425]  And that's why Digital Restrictions Management, DRM, is such a pain nowadays because of that law that the copyright law be purchased in 1998
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:10.184]  Which bans the software capable of breaking the digital handcuffs.
[01:16:10.184 --> 01:16:17.468]  So I am against anything that the copyright lobby wants until they start
[01:16:18.855 --> 01:16:22.897]  Undoing some of the injustices they've already imposed on us.
[01:16:22.897 --> 01:16:30.421]  Doctor, let me try to quantify that from my layman's perspective and correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I see as the injustice.
[01:16:30.421 --> 01:16:40.966]  They're talking about their rights as they attempt to put a preemptive, non-deliberative, no due process, guilty until proven guilty system.
[01:16:42.947 --> 01:16:44.247]  I was being sarcastic.
[01:16:44.247 --> 01:16:46.128]  I mean, you're guilty basically, period.
[01:16:46.128 --> 01:16:47.168]  Yeah, guilty until proven guilty.
[01:16:47.168 --> 01:16:48.948]  I was being sarcastic.
[01:16:48.948 --> 01:16:51.069]  But I mean, you're guilty up front.
[01:16:51.069 --> 01:17:00.030]  And they're basically just gobbling up the internet, gobbling up what people have created, gobbling up everything like they're masters of the universe.
[01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:05.892]  And until they become reasonable, there's no point in even discussing anything with them because they're not giving anybody quarter.
[01:17:05.892 --> 01:17:07.052]  I agree.
[01:17:08.425 --> 01:17:26.450]  Furthermore, the more subtle thing that they're doing is they're trying to focus attention on their problems as if their problems needed to be catered to, while distracting you away from the problems they have already imposed on us.
[01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:29.991]  I hope we completely defeat SOPA, but
[01:17:30.874 --> 01:17:34.216]  Don't forget that copyright law in the U.S.
[01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:36.178]  already gives them too much power.
[01:17:36.178 --> 01:17:37.559]  Of course, they're not satisfied.
[01:17:37.559 --> 01:17:39.040]  They always want more.
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.863]  That's what the 1% do to the 99%.
[01:17:42.863 --> 01:17:46.765]  But, even if we stop them from getting more, that's not enough.
[01:17:46.765 --> 01:17:51.429]  We've got to aim for more than just preventing them from making it worse.
[01:17:51.429 --> 01:17:55.792]  We've got to undo some of the injustices they have already done to us.
[01:17:57.026 --> 01:18:05.347]  We have to put an end to the war on sharing, which is a cruel war that attacks all of us.
[01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:08.908]  Now, when I say sharing, I mean something specific.
[01:18:08.908 --> 01:18:16.169]  I mean non-commercial copying and redistribution of published works.
[01:18:16.169 --> 01:18:19.990]  Exact copies, that means, not modifications.
[01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:24.891]  That's a rather limited freedom, but that's the freedom we all must have.
[01:18:25.888 --> 01:18:33.999]  So that the war on sharing ends and copyright ceases to be tyranny.
[01:18:33.999 --> 01:18:37.203]  Now that means I've got to stop using digital handcuffs.
[01:18:38.112 --> 01:18:42.357]  Lots of products nowadays are designed with digital handcuffs.
[01:18:42.357 --> 01:18:46.081]  Every DVD player you can buy has digital handcuffs.
[01:18:46.081 --> 01:18:47.763]  Let me give people an example.
[01:18:47.763 --> 01:18:50.927]  I have a TV studio, I have a TV show, I make films.
[01:18:50.927 --> 01:18:56.493]  I buy prosumer and professional equipment, and half of our technical difficulties
[01:18:57.254 --> 01:19:04.938]  ...are with digital TVs, monitors, cameras, is having the right software keys, everything talking to each other plugged in.
[01:19:04.938 --> 01:19:08.920]  It has to authenticate that I'm allowed to run a video through it.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:13.522]  It's all spying on me and screwing up my entire operation.
[01:19:13.522 --> 01:19:20.406]  My whole life is about complying with this stuff, and I bought it, and I'm in here using it to produce TV.
[01:19:20.406 --> 01:19:26.349]  And as the 80 inventors of the Internet pointed out, this SOPA would cripple the Internet by putting all these
[01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:30.130]  Pre-restrictions on things.
[01:19:30.130 --> 01:19:40.855]  Well yes, the worst thing in SOPA is that it becomes easy to shut down any website where the public is posting things.
[01:19:40.855 --> 01:19:46.378]  It just takes an accusation that somebody posted something that was infringing copyright
[01:19:47.205 --> 01:19:51.669]  And it becomes almost impossible for that site to keep operating.
[01:19:51.669 --> 01:20:05.179]  That's why Wikipedia decided to go black yesterday, because it would be impossible to operate something even vaguely like Wikipedia under the rules of SOPA.
[01:20:05.179 --> 01:20:10.403]  Now, after the show's over, I'd like you to tell me more about the precise details
[01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:12.690]  Sure, if you'd like that, Doctor.
[01:20:12.690 --> 01:20:16.912]  I actually have two engineers here and they can explain it to you.
[01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:20.194]  But, you know, we have TV sets behind me on the nightly news and they're digital.
[01:20:32.441 --> 01:20:52.136]  And just to run feeds to them, to talk to a guest on Skype, or to have a blue background behind me, all the TVs you buy that are prosumer or even professional now, it has a gate in it that scans to see if I'm even streaming something over it that's copyright.
[01:20:52.136 --> 01:20:54.297]  And then it's endless.
[01:20:54.297 --> 01:21:00.001]  To use software, you've got to have the dongle in the machine, and then that screws up.
[01:21:00.862 --> 01:21:06.126]  Because you're using proprietary software, and proprietary... You see, with software there are just two possibilities.
[01:21:06.126 --> 01:21:11.149]  Either the users control the program, or the program controls the users.
[01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:16.653]  What you're seeing is that with proprietary software, the software controls the users.
[01:21:16.653 --> 01:21:18.654]  Now, what's proprietary software?
[01:21:18.654 --> 01:21:30.282]  That's any software for which the users don't have the freedom to run it as they wish, study and change the source code, and redistribute it either with or without changes.
[01:21:32.563 --> 01:21:34.585]  Sure, just to be clear, Doctor.
[01:21:34.585 --> 01:21:40.549]  But with Windows or Mac OS or Skype, the software controls the users.
[01:21:40.549 --> 01:21:43.352]  That's why I will not use any of that.
[01:21:43.352 --> 01:21:47.014]  Well, it is the machines surveilling us, preemptively turning us into slaves.
[01:21:47.014 --> 01:21:49.616]  A lot of our operation is run on Linux systems.
[01:21:49.616 --> 01:21:54.480]  I'm not a tech guy, but... They're not Linux systems, they're GNU systems, and you're talking about Microsoft.
[01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:59.112]  You're right, you are the progenitor of that with GNU that then other things grew out of.
[01:21:59.112 --> 01:22:01.093]  So GNU systems, we do have a lot of those.
[01:22:01.093 --> 01:22:07.376]  We have one of our IT people just absolutely loves your work and has tried to build a lot of things around her like that.
[01:22:07.376 --> 01:22:12.959]  But separately, when I've got a pretty big operation, it's not that big, like 34 people, you know, sometimes we've got to hurry.
[01:22:12.959 --> 01:22:15.801]  We've got to buy software to run TV shows.
[01:22:15.801 --> 01:22:17.202]  We've got to get equipment.
[01:22:17.202 --> 01:22:21.444]  I'm talking about solid state stuff, Doc, that won't work as well.
[01:22:21.444 --> 01:22:23.485]  All I'm saying is it screws everything up.
[01:22:24.383 --> 01:22:50.183]  Yeah, hardware can be malicious too, and the encryption of video between a computer and a monitor is an example of a malicious hardware feature that has been put into essentially all modern PCs by a conspiracy of corporations, including hardware companies and media companies.
[01:22:51.005 --> 01:22:53.206]  So, you can see it.
[01:22:53.206 --> 01:23:07.033]  They buy laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to forbid people to escape from these things, and then they can design our technology to abuse us however they wish.
[01:23:07.033 --> 01:23:12.075]  So, what you can see is that proprietary software
[01:23:13.284 --> 01:23:20.266]  Because even when there's hardware that's malicious, the software has to make use of the malicious features.
[01:23:20.266 --> 01:23:23.386]  So the proprietary software is involved also.
[01:23:23.386 --> 01:23:36.689]  And when software is proprietary, it is likely to have malicious features in it to spy, to restrict, and there are even backdoors that accept remote commands to do things.
[01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:38.651]  That's what I was about to get to, sir.
[01:23:38.651 --> 01:23:45.396]  We're talking to Richard Stallman, free software inventor, creator, guru, Obi-Wan Kenobi type.
[01:23:45.396 --> 01:23:58.086]  You know, so much of what we live with today that is the only alternative to what, you know, the big corporate borg are oppressing us with did come out of his ideas.
[01:23:58.086 --> 01:24:01.728]  But expanding on this, Doc, because when you talk about it, that's what I'm saying.
[01:24:01.728 --> 01:24:03.970]  I've tried to get the
[01:24:05.471 --> 01:24:07.052]  You know, the freer systems.
[01:24:07.052 --> 01:24:10.813]  And I'm saying in many cases, it does not exist.
[01:24:10.813 --> 01:24:17.734]  I don't have the money to hire an army of people that are trained in free software to be able to even attempt it.
[01:24:17.734 --> 01:24:18.935]  And what you said is true.
[01:24:18.935 --> 01:24:34.239]  There's all these Trojan horses built into everything, and I'm even paying for it, and it's junk, no matter how expensive, because the whole thing is tied down with these handcuffs, and it just absolutely stifles innovation, as you said 30 years ago.
[01:24:35.906 --> 01:24:38.827]  Although it does worse than stifle innovation.
[01:24:38.827 --> 01:24:49.872]  You see, innovation is the sacred cow of people who claim that they need to be allowed to restrict us.
[01:24:49.872 --> 01:24:53.694]  They say if they can restrict us, they'll do more innovation.
[01:24:53.694 --> 01:24:57.456]  But innovation can be good or bad.
[01:24:57.456 --> 01:25:01.077]  Democracy was once an innovation.
[01:25:01.077 --> 01:25:03.158]  Tyranny was once an innovation.
[01:25:05.006 --> 01:25:07.408]  Innovation can serve us.
[01:25:07.408 --> 01:25:10.150]  My own weapons were once an innovation.
[01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:17.875]  Innovation will only serve us if we have control over what innovations will accept and what innovations will reject.
[01:25:17.875 --> 01:25:27.041]  So, I do not accept innovation as sufficiently important to justify taking away our freedom.
[01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:31.985]  Yes, I'd like innovation, all else being equal, assuming we have freedom.
[01:25:32.822 --> 01:25:40.228]  When somebody argues, give up your freedom so we can make more innovation, that is literally a trojan horse.
[01:25:40.228 --> 01:25:56.139]  Well, that's well said, but my point is they are... I mean, everybody knows Microsoft stuff works horribly because it's all got backdoor spy systems, and it's just total crap because, excuse my French there, because they're obsessed and control freaks.
[01:25:56.139 --> 01:25:59.402]  Bill Gates.
[01:25:59.402 --> 01:26:00.703]  Yep.
[01:26:00.703 --> 01:26:02.084]  But it's not just Microsoft.
[01:26:02.768 --> 01:26:05.189]  I've got to point out that Apple is even worse.
[01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:07.049]  Oh yeah.
[01:26:07.049 --> 01:26:10.270]  And Amazon is horrible.
[01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:24.973]  The Amazon Swindle, an e-book reader, has known spy features, of course it has digital handcuffs, and it has a backdoor for deleting books.
[01:26:24.973 --> 01:26:27.934]  Do you know that Amazon remotely deleted
[01:26:28.695 --> 01:26:30.416]  Thousands of books in 2009?
[01:26:30.416 --> 01:26:30.817]  Yeah, 1984!
[01:26:30.817 --> 01:26:33.919]  Right.
[01:26:33.919 --> 01:26:45.248]  Someone wrote they used up a year's supply of irony demonstrating the Orwellian nature of their product, which they call the Kindle, because it's designed to burn our books.
[01:26:45.248 --> 01:26:48.290]  But they demonstrated it by deleting Orwell's book.
[01:26:49.972 --> 01:26:50.993]  Oh, that's another point.
[01:26:50.993 --> 01:26:54.335]  They've got this Kazaa thing where I've had rights to music.
[01:26:54.335 --> 01:26:55.616]  I've uploaded it.
[01:26:55.616 --> 01:27:02.241]  But because it's in some registrar, suddenly it shuts down the audio on my videos that millions of people are watching.
[01:27:02.241 --> 01:27:09.906]  And even though I have letters sending them to YouTube that I have license here, it doesn't matter because the computer recognized it and did that.
[01:27:09.906 --> 01:27:16.711]  And they now admit they could erase my voice off these major systems in a matter of hours with the same technology.
[01:27:16.711 --> 01:27:19.493]  I mean, you talk about dangerous having all the books digital.
[01:27:19.753 --> 01:27:22.234]  They could just hit a button!
[01:27:22.234 --> 01:27:25.815]  That's why I won't use such systems.
[01:27:25.815 --> 01:27:32.517]  I will never use anything like the Amazon Kindle for my books.
[01:27:32.517 --> 01:27:38.638]  Because I want to have books that I can read without any proprietary technology.
[01:27:38.638 --> 01:27:44.280]  I want to buy them without identifying myself.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:47.081]  And I'm not willing to sign a contract to get them.
[01:27:47.978 --> 01:27:59.121]  If I buy a paper book to do it with cash in a bookstore, I don't sign a contract, and my eyes, without any aid at all, or at most perhaps with some lenses...
[01:28:00.106 --> 01:28:01.787]  You can see the letters.
[01:28:01.787 --> 01:28:06.690]  I'm not required to get some secret technology just to see what the letters in the book are.
[01:28:06.690 --> 01:28:07.230]  Wow.
[01:28:07.230 --> 01:28:10.933]  So, I will never use those e-books.
[01:28:10.933 --> 01:28:12.414]  Under no circumstances.
[01:28:12.414 --> 01:28:14.935]  And I hope the rest of you will join me.
[01:28:14.935 --> 01:28:24.521]  If you want to read more about this, look at stallman.org slash articles slash ebooks.pdf.
[01:28:24.521 --> 01:28:25.582]  And at the bottom of that,
[01:28:26.198 --> 01:28:36.131]  There is a link to a place you can sign up to participate in our campaign against tyrannical e-book systems.
[01:28:38.371 --> 01:28:44.235]  I mean, I had read some of your writings on this, but the way you put it, we can really see it being put into function.
[01:28:44.235 --> 01:28:46.196]  I mean, this is a tyranny.
[01:28:46.196 --> 01:28:54.602]  They've designed the current web system as a tyranny, consciously, as you said, the big corporations.
[01:28:54.602 --> 01:29:03.448]  And the sick part is, when we pay the licenses and buy the equipment, we're paying for their own Trojan horse for them to engage in beyond Orwellian behavior.
[01:29:03.948 --> 01:29:26.563]  Yup, and that's, well, I wouldn't say beyond Orwellian, after all, uh, uh, um, Oceania did things even worse than destroying books, and they, they just murdered people, uh, but, the point is, we have to reject these systems, and that's the basic idea of the free software movement.
[01:29:26.563 --> 01:29:29.945]  I won't accept the systems that are designed to take away my freedom.
[01:29:31.112 --> 01:29:38.594]  Okay, Doctor, I'm going to try to get you in touch right now with one of the engineers to give you any of that information you want.
[01:29:38.594 --> 01:29:39.834]  And I'll say bye to you during the break.
[01:29:39.834 --> 01:29:43.815]  Perhaps you can even come back for a couple more minutes on the other side and tell us more about solutions.
[01:29:43.815 --> 01:29:48.337]  But just intriguing to hear you on with us and all the points that you bring up.
[01:29:48.337 --> 01:29:50.557]  It absolutely makes sterling sense.
[01:29:50.557 --> 01:29:51.958]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.958 --> 01:29:53.538]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.538 --> 01:29:57.139]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.117 --> 01:30:07.078]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:07.078 --> 01:30:15.940]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:20.581]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:31.383]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:32.023 --> 01:30:41.545]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:41.545 --> 01:30:46.967]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:46.967 --> 01:30:54.448]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:57.209]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:31:02.361 --> 01:31:06.363]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:06.363 --> 01:31:09.624]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:09.624 --> 01:31:14.766]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:14.766 --> 01:31:20.809]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:23.030]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.870]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:24.050]  Bernanke?
[01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:24.410]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:24.410 --> 01:31:25.111]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:25.111 --> 01:31:26.791]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:42.478 --> 01:31:49.761]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:31:49.761 --> 01:31:58.865]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:01.072 --> 01:32:02.374]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:02.374 --> 01:32:07.962]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:07.962 --> 01:32:12.988]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:12.988 --> 01:32:13.469]  It's true.
[01:32:13.469 --> 01:32:16.273]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:32:16.273 --> 01:32:18.035]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:32:18.556 --> 01:32:23.780]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:30.886]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.886 --> 01:32:32.007]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:32.007 --> 01:32:38.372]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.692 --> 01:32:41.874]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:41.874 --> 01:32:45.036]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:45.036 --> 01:32:45.236]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:45.236 --> 01:32:48.679]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:48.679 --> 01:32:50.420]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:19.909]  Well, Richard Stallman, Dr. Richard Stallman, free software creator of the GNU system that everything's pretty much based on today, Linux, you name it, is our guest for five more minutes.
[01:33:19.909 --> 01:33:28.216]  He's going to be gone for a while, but hopefully coming up in a few months we'll be able to get him on for a full hour, because everything he talks about just totally clicks.
[01:33:28.216 --> 01:33:30.138]  Because I'm not an IT person, but I live
[01:33:30.978 --> 01:33:32.538]  12, 14 hours a day around it.
[01:33:32.538 --> 01:33:34.559]  We're an internet operation, pretty much.
[01:33:34.559 --> 01:33:37.019]  We're on commercial radio as well on XM.
[01:33:37.019 --> 01:33:39.960]  But I live it and I've experienced what he's talking about.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:45.461]  And all the points he makes ties right in to what I'm just organically seeing as a layperson here.
[01:33:45.461 --> 01:33:48.982]  But I was bringing up some intriguing stuff to him during the break.
[01:33:48.982 --> 01:33:54.663]  We have the articles, we have the Time Warner executives send us the internal documents after we surmised it.
[01:33:54.663 --> 01:33:59.924]  An example of these Trojan horses, the TiVo systems, the Time Warner cable systems and others.
[01:34:00.504 --> 01:34:08.549]  When they censored the Jesse Ventura TV show, it aired once, Congress went crazy on the FEMA camps, ordered them not to air it again, that later came out in Congress.
[01:34:08.549 --> 01:34:10.890]  It was a big scandal.
[01:34:10.890 --> 01:34:16.354]  Suddenly, off of DVRs nationwide, cable systems, you name it, it disappeared.
[01:34:16.354 --> 01:34:21.637]  We confirmed it through one Time Warner office that they were ordered to put the command in.
[01:34:21.637 --> 01:34:23.538]  They'd never seen that before.
[01:34:23.538 --> 01:34:29.142]  But the point is, you pay for cable, you have a DVR, you record on it,
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:32.622]  And then they go in and erase it.
[01:34:32.622 --> 01:34:34.343]  And I know you want to see the proof of that.
[01:34:34.343 --> 01:34:35.244]  We'll get it to you, doctor.
[01:34:35.244 --> 01:34:38.386]  But if true, what do you make of that?
[01:34:38.386 --> 01:34:46.672]  It's just another example of how non-free software is a restriction on the users and it's an injustice.
[01:34:46.672 --> 01:34:56.839]  So if you look around at any non-free software you've heard of, you know, various products that have non-free software in them, every one of them should not be that way.
[01:34:59.042 --> 01:35:02.243]  Yeah, it's very, very sad that this is all going on.
[01:35:02.243 --> 01:35:03.683]  We're paying for our own prison.
[01:35:03.683 --> 01:35:13.906]  In just three or four minutes, because I know you've got to go, Doctor, what are some other solutions or things we can start doing to weaken the power of the corporate board?
[01:35:16.545 --> 01:35:27.354]  All across the various areas of life, we can see corporations taking control of our government and using that power to hurt most people.
[01:35:27.354 --> 01:35:33.379]  Of course, there's the financial crisis and all the Americans facing foreclosure.
[01:35:33.379 --> 01:35:35.961]  A lot of these foreclosures are fraudulent.
[01:35:35.961 --> 01:35:38.443]  The banks are committing fraud when they foreclose.
[01:35:39.003 --> 01:35:45.784]  And right now, we're pushing Obama not to let them off the hook, which is what he wants them to do.
[01:35:45.784 --> 01:35:52.945]  There are a few states where the Attorneys General are trying to pursue the banksters for their fraudulent foreclosures.
[01:35:52.945 --> 01:35:56.626]  And there are protests run by MoveOn today.
[01:35:56.626 --> 01:35:58.266]  I'm going to go to one this afternoon.
[01:35:58.266 --> 01:36:00.927]  But that's just one example.
[01:36:00.927 --> 01:36:07.808]  Of course, the banks created the downturn by purchasing deregulation in Congress.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:20.004]  And then if we look at, for instance, agribusiness, which is basically crushed family farming in the U.S.
[01:36:20.004 --> 01:36:23.025]  and now gets tremendous subsidies to these corporations.
[01:36:24.073 --> 01:36:28.636]  Subsidies that were originally meant to help family farmers, and that made sense.
[01:36:28.636 --> 01:36:31.618]  But nowadays, it's just subsidies to big business.
[01:36:31.618 --> 01:36:37.001]  And then you look at the private prison industry, which is a great reason.
[01:36:37.001 --> 01:36:39.542]  They use the prisoners.
[01:36:39.542 --> 01:36:42.984]  They have the prisoners work, but it's the company that gets the money.
[01:36:42.984 --> 01:36:50.329]  The prisoner gets paid like 50 cents a day, which is, you know, even better for them than hiring somebody in Mexico or China.
[01:36:51.207 --> 01:36:57.369]  And so, that's a reason to imprison more Americans, because they're effectively slave labor.
[01:36:57.369 --> 01:37:14.593]  And then, if we look at the oil companies and their push for burning up our planet, you may have followed the fight to block the Keystone XL planet roaster pipeline, and that's not dead either.
[01:37:14.593 --> 01:37:15.333]  So, what is it
[01:37:18.366 --> 01:37:19.787]  What do these things have in common?
[01:37:19.787 --> 01:37:25.572]  What they have is corporations have power, so we need to clean up politics.
[01:37:25.572 --> 01:37:28.834]  We need to get corporate money out of politics.
[01:37:28.834 --> 01:37:33.337]  And I got a book yesterday.
[01:37:33.337 --> 01:37:36.039]  Let me read the exact title.
[01:37:36.039 --> 01:37:42.024]  It's Corporations Are Not People by Jeffrey Clement.
[01:37:42.024 --> 01:37:46.547]  And this proposes a constitutional amendment to say that no
[01:37:48.163 --> 01:37:55.448]  When the Constitution gives rights to people or persons, it's not talking about corporations.
[01:37:59.099 --> 01:38:05.844]  Well, the power to give corporations rights so they can then stomp on our rights, it's very, very frightening.
[01:38:05.844 --> 01:38:12.348]  And for those that don't know, you couldn't even have corporations in this country the way they are until about the last 130 years or so.
[01:38:12.348 --> 01:38:17.271]  Before that, they had limited duration to build a bridge or to do some type of program.
[01:38:17.271 --> 01:38:19.513]  And I understand a little company having a corporation.
[01:38:20.213 --> 01:38:24.174]  Well, he said that corporations are people, and someone pointed out that if that's true, he's a serial killer.
[01:38:45.153 --> 01:38:53.638]  I don't want to abolish corporations either, but we must abolish the political power of business.
[01:38:53.638 --> 01:39:01.363]  In this country, it's taken for granted that business, powerful business, has the veto over everything.
[01:39:01.363 --> 01:39:04.645]  And that means it's taken for granted that we've lost our democracy.
[01:39:06.042 --> 01:39:12.526]  No one should think about that without feeling disgusted and saying, this must be changed.
[01:39:12.526 --> 01:39:25.934]  Get that book because he explains how it's not an accident that the Supreme Court gave corporations unlimited power to pay for political ads.
[01:39:25.934 --> 01:39:29.637]  It's the culmination of a 40 year or 35 year perhaps campaign for
[01:39:34.562 --> 01:39:39.568]  Giving human rights to corporations.
[01:39:39.568 --> 01:39:40.970]  It is very, very dangerous.
[01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:45.456]  And now those corporations are destroying our sovereignty, our local control.
[01:39:45.456 --> 01:39:48.620]  Dr. Stallman, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:53.506]  And again, give us your website and any other websites you think are important for people to look at.
[01:39:55.663 --> 01:40:03.427]  Look at the free software foundation site that is fsf.org and you can join if you wish.
[01:40:03.427 --> 01:40:09.230]  For my other political causes, look at stallman.org.
[01:40:09.230 --> 01:40:16.553]  And if you want to join our fight against digital handcuffs, DRM, go to defectivebydesign.org.
[01:40:18.582 --> 01:40:30.039]  And for the danger of e-books and how they take away our freedom, look at spolman.org slash articles slash ebooks dot pdf.
[01:40:30.962 --> 01:40:51.475]  All right, Doc, thanks for the time, but in the final statement is, I mean, just reiterating, you think it's really exciting that there's such an awakening to the power grabbing of the copyright industry and the fact that Hollywood and others just think they control the known universe and this has certainly gotten their attention.
[01:40:51.475 --> 01:40:53.176]  What do you expect them to do now?
[01:40:53.176 --> 01:40:54.697]  They'll find another way.
[01:40:54.697 --> 01:40:58.279]  You see, whether we defeat SOPA or not,
[01:40:59.165 --> 01:41:11.894]  Even if we defeat it, it'll be clear that we defeated it because the measures they wanted to take were going to cause tremendous damage to everything around them.
[01:41:11.894 --> 01:41:21.661]  But if they propose something else that'll give them more power but won't hurt other companies, they might still get away with it.
[01:41:21.661 --> 01:41:27.205]  So, what that means is we still have a long way to go in building up our opposition
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:34.880]  To the point where we can start to undo some of the injustices they have already put into copyright.
[01:41:35.444 --> 01:41:44.188]  So it was just so ham-fisted and so brazen bull in a China cabinet they were unable to get it, but they will come back.
[01:41:44.188 --> 01:41:51.872]  And it does show how, I mean, remember five years ago when McCain said, let's pass a bill where no judge, no jury, no proof?
[01:41:51.872 --> 01:41:56.854]  We just kill your computer if we think you did something copyright?
[01:41:56.854 --> 01:42:01.216]  I mean, this is overthrowing our entire Magna Carta, our entire Constitution.
[01:42:01.216 --> 01:42:03.517]  I mean, it's tyrannical on its face, Doc.
[01:42:05.896 --> 01:42:06.877]  Big business is like.
[01:42:06.877 --> 01:42:13.242]  Big business just wants power and has no respect for anything.
[01:42:13.242 --> 01:42:13.682]  Wow.
[01:42:13.682 --> 01:42:15.504]  Well, I look forward to speaking to you again.
[01:42:15.504 --> 01:42:16.765]  Thank you so much, Doctor.
[01:42:16.765 --> 01:42:18.166]  Happy hacking.
[01:42:18.166 --> 01:42:19.667]  Thanks for giving me the chance.
[01:42:19.667 --> 01:42:21.769]  Yeah, thanks for being with us.
[01:42:21.769 --> 01:42:22.849]  What an interesting fellow.
[01:42:22.849 --> 01:42:24.631]  Wow.
[01:42:24.631 --> 01:42:26.172]  That was a very powerful interview.
[01:42:26.172 --> 01:42:27.613]  Went a little bit longer than I intended it to.
[01:42:27.613 --> 01:42:30.335]  We've got a lot to cover, but it's important.
[01:42:30.335 --> 01:42:32.037]  I'm not going to have time to air all of this.
[01:42:33.183 --> 01:42:33.523]  I don't think so.
[01:42:53.686 --> 01:42:56.628]  And that is that The Awakening is viral right now.
[01:42:56.628 --> 01:43:01.852]  People are really starting to understand with the passage of the NDAA and the rest of it.
[01:43:01.852 --> 01:43:03.554]  Look at the support of Ron Paul.
[01:43:03.554 --> 01:43:07.217]  Look at the so-called mainstream media losing almost all its viewers and listeners.
[01:43:07.217 --> 01:43:08.317]  They're in implosion.
[01:43:08.317 --> 01:43:09.578]  They're in free fall.
[01:43:09.578 --> 01:43:11.180]  That's what this SOPA thing's about.
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:12.401]  That's a big part of it.
[01:43:12.401 --> 01:43:15.743]  That's why the mainstream corporate prostitutes endorsed it.
[01:43:15.743 --> 01:43:17.785]  The system is scared.
[01:43:17.785 --> 01:43:20.727]  They built this whole grid to surveil us.
[01:43:20.727 --> 01:43:21.608]  It's backfired on.
[01:43:23.383 --> 01:43:25.544]  And I'm not saying we're even winning the fight.
[01:43:25.544 --> 01:43:26.325]  We're in the fight.
[01:43:26.325 --> 01:43:28.566]  I agree with Dr. Stallman it was on.
[01:43:28.566 --> 01:43:32.129]  He said this is the, you know, we're really starting to see humanity get in the fight.
[01:43:33.852 --> 01:43:43.439]  And you're really starting to see humanity wake up that all is not well in the state of Denmark, as Shakespeare would say.
[01:43:43.439 --> 01:43:44.920]  And so it's very, very exciting.
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:49.122]  So all of you need to realize the Internet is still somewhat free.
[01:43:49.122 --> 01:43:56.447]  We still have the power of free speech until the big false flag or the war with Iran and all the other garbage coming down the pike.
[01:43:56.447 --> 01:44:01.391]  If we speak out now while the sun shines, the globalists may back off.
[01:44:01.391 --> 01:44:02.651]  I know they may slow down.
[01:44:03.772 --> 01:44:05.635]  Things won't go as well for him.
[01:44:05.635 --> 01:44:18.552]  So now is the time like never before, while we've still got the internet, while so many people are listening, while so many people understand what's happening, to gain the initiative, which we're starting to get, and turn this around.
[01:44:19.173 --> 01:44:20.914]  So here is our report.
[01:44:20.914 --> 01:44:22.736]  Aaron Dykes put this together.
[01:44:22.736 --> 01:44:24.057]  Amazing job, Aaron.
[01:44:24.057 --> 01:44:26.339]  And the article and video is at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:26.339 --> 01:44:28.420]  Please get it and get it out to everyone you know.
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:31.903]  It's titled, Resistance is Victory, The Tide is Turning.
[01:44:31.903 --> 01:44:34.685]  We'll play part of it, go to break, come back and play the rest.
[01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:40.669]  And then Wayne Paul, brother of Ron Paul, is coming up talking about the incredible election fraud now coming out.
[01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:42.251]  Confirmed, we told you so.
[01:44:42.251 --> 01:44:46.294]  They're throwing out the election results in Iowa, and they're not saying what that means.
[01:44:47.898 --> 01:44:51.901]  So now I guess they'll just admit fraud in states and then give it to Santorum or Romney?
[01:44:51.901 --> 01:44:53.923]  Well, there's fraud, but we say it's them.
[01:44:53.923 --> 01:44:57.166]  We had a good old boy meeting, and what did Karl Rove say?
[01:44:57.166 --> 01:45:01.670]  And just, you know, had a gentleman's agreement.
[01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:03.071]  Let's go ahead and go to this video.
[01:45:03.071 --> 01:45:04.672]  It's up to you if this gets out to everybody.
[01:45:04.672 --> 01:45:05.513]  Here it is.
[01:45:05.513 --> 01:45:09.376]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:45:10.382 --> 01:45:12.705]  I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[01:45:12.705 --> 01:45:14.928]  Resistance is victory.
[01:45:14.928 --> 01:45:21.216]  That simple, initial decision to stand up and to get involved and to take action.
[01:45:22.369 --> 01:45:32.416]  Is the most important decision you can make because from that flows all other major actions in the fight for freedom and human dignity worldwide.
[01:45:32.416 --> 01:45:34.518]  But you first got to get angry.
[01:45:34.518 --> 01:45:37.660]  You've got to get focused and you've got to get engaged.
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:40.162]  The world is at a crossroads.
[01:45:40.162 --> 01:45:42.764]  We have a decision to make.
[01:45:42.764 --> 01:45:51.351]  No one can deny anymore that tyranny is growing and casting its long dark shadow across not just the United States but worldwide.
[01:45:52.165 --> 01:46:07.335]  But in the midst of all of this, and as we move deeper into 2012, it is important to realize the incredible successes, complete and partial, that we've had against tyranny.
[01:46:07.335 --> 01:46:10.537]  These are just a few in the last year.
[01:46:10.537 --> 01:46:19.363]  In fact, after you're done watching this video, I would ask you to post comments with points that you believe have been victories, so we can make a Part 2 video.
[01:46:19.363 --> 01:46:21.344]  But here are just some of them.
[01:46:22.625 --> 01:46:46.490]  The SOPA bill, or Stopping Online Piracy Act, which is really just a Trojan horse, as the inventors of the internet and many others went public and documented, to shut down free speech and to allow giant corporate monoliths to basically carve up the internet and take it over for their own uses and shut down their competition.
[01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:48.311]  But you saw the GoDaddy protest.
[01:46:49.031 --> 01:46:52.513]  That caused hundreds of thousands of their customers to leave them.
[01:46:52.513 --> 01:47:08.941]  Many of the big internet companies and smaller ones as well, led by Reddit and others, saying that they were going to basically black out their websites to protest the fact that the SOPA bill is a free speech killing system.
[01:47:09.881 --> 01:47:26.996]  And now, because of the actions that you and others took, the system, who just a few weeks ago was very arrogant and said, resistance is futile, we're going to pass this, we've got hundreds more votes than we need in the House, suddenly it's crumbled, and they're saying, okay, we're shelving it for now.
[01:47:26.996 --> 01:47:32.841]  And they hope that later, you'll go back to sleep, that they can repackage their lies and bring it back forward.
[01:47:32.841 --> 01:47:36.204]  But the point here is, when we take action,
[01:47:37.489 --> 01:47:48.300]  And when the people stand up for basic fundamental rights, the system and the oligarchs that control it are brought to their knees.
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:54.746]  So a big victory in early 2012 against something the system told us was a foregone conclusion.
[01:47:54.746 --> 01:47:57.468]  They don't just stop there trying to craft our reality.
[01:47:58.109 --> 01:48:14.518]  They've told us for a year that Ron Paul cannot win, that no one would vote for him, that he wasn't even a real candidate, that there was no way he could ever come in third, fourth, fifth place, much less second in New Hampshire and a statistical dead heat in Iowa.
[01:48:14.518 --> 01:48:18.060]  But despite the entire dinosaur whore media,
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:32.252]  The zombie controlled media telling you he can't win and excluding him from debates and giving him 89 seconds in other debates and all the demonization and all the dirty tricks and everything they've got being thrown at Ron Paul.
[01:48:32.252 --> 01:48:37.797]  He is growing in the polls nationwide and is a very strong second place.
[01:48:38.277 --> 01:48:48.368]  Even if he loses, even if they engage in election fraud, we all win because real issues are being injected and a movement for liberty worldwide is growing.
[01:48:48.368 --> 01:48:53.314]  Ron Paul and all of us that support him aren't just an example for freedom here in the US.
[01:48:53.314 --> 01:48:56.518]  There are movements sprouting up all over the world.
[01:48:56.518 --> 01:48:58.300]  We are offering the alternative.
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:10.183]  To the crony capitalist anti-free market monopoly men that run our government and other major governments who are trying to shut down the true free market and destroy our private property.
[01:49:10.183 --> 01:49:15.445]  Ron Paul and his resistance and our support of him is victory.
[01:49:15.445 --> 01:49:18.846]  Let me move to some of the other big victories we've had in the last few months.
[01:49:19.446 --> 01:49:36.045]  All over the United States, from California to Florida, but also in Canada and Europe and the United Kingdom, major cities and towns are removing the toxic waste, sodium fluoride, and other byproducts from their water supplies.
[01:49:36.045 --> 01:49:39.990]  One county in Florida has a million residents in it.
[01:49:40.450 --> 01:49:52.651]  And the City Council overwhelmingly, after seeing the scientific evidence, moved to remove the toxic brain-altering chemical from the water supply.
[01:49:52.651 --> 01:49:53.652]  Huge victory!
[01:49:54.895 --> 01:50:06.166]  For more than 60 years, globalist corporations, in a bid to reduce fertility, chose bisphenol A as a key ingredient in most plastics to reduce fertility.
[01:50:06.166 --> 01:50:10.571]  There were literally thousands of other formulae that didn't have the estrogen mimicker in it.
[01:50:11.633 --> 01:50:29.067]  But now, 60 years later, all over the world, businesses, corporations, restaurants are advertising that they have bisphenol-free products, whether it's baggies for food or furniture or clothing.
[01:50:29.067 --> 01:50:33.711]  This is another example of a human awakening taking place.
[01:50:33.711 --> 01:50:36.013]  And in just a matter of a few years,
[01:50:36.953 --> 01:50:41.475]  Alright, we're gonna come right back and you know what I'm gonna do?
[01:50:41.475 --> 01:50:51.199]  I'm gonna play the rest of this with solutions and victories we've had after Wayne Paul comes up because I want to hit some other news right now.
[01:51:02.834 --> 01:51:07.876]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[01:51:07.876 --> 01:51:13.199]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.

[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:29.038]  By the way, on the nightly news this evening that I'm hosting, I remember a year ago the Haitians came out and said, we believe the UN is bringing cholera and other weaponized forms of different diseases here, because suddenly this stuff's spreading everywhere and it wasn't here until they got here.
[01:54:29.038 --> 01:54:32.521]  Now it's coming out in the mainline corporate press this is the case.
[01:54:34.484 --> 01:54:37.747]  And we have a bunch of different reports on that this evening.
[01:54:37.747 --> 01:54:38.567]  And the U.N.
[01:54:38.567 --> 01:54:43.812]  is doing its normal, raping children, kidnapping people.
[01:54:43.812 --> 01:54:49.796]  So I think this evening we won't just cover what's happening in Haiti, because we always like to go further and give you a back story.
[01:54:49.796 --> 01:54:52.278]  In fact, I know Rob Dews is listening.
[01:54:52.278 --> 01:54:58.143]  Rob, let's just not stop there, because during the break I was back there with the TV guys looking at news with them.
[01:54:58.143 --> 01:54:59.084]  Let's get together
[01:55:00.453 --> 01:55:02.675]  Maybe the 10 greatest hits of the UN.
[01:55:02.675 --> 01:55:08.339]  Giant child kidnapping rings when they moved into Serbia and Kosovo.
[01:55:08.339 --> 01:55:10.220]  Giant kidnapping rings in Iraq.
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:11.561]  Let's get the DynCorp.
[01:55:11.561 --> 01:55:14.103]  I mean, let's show folks, because people don't know about this.
[01:55:14.103 --> 01:55:22.689]  I mean, the UN forces are just absolute murdering criminals who want to have fun with people.
[01:55:22.689 --> 01:55:25.571]  You want to talk about an army that's known for atrocities?
[01:55:25.571 --> 01:55:27.453]  It is just pure evil.
[01:55:28.858 --> 01:55:42.701]  Because they've got all this political cover of how they're humanitarian, and they care, and all the Miss Americas say support the UN, and give to UNICEF, and all this bull.
[01:55:42.701 --> 01:55:49.043]  It's a eugenics, third-world-destroying slave grid, and it's come out so many times.
[01:55:49.043 --> 01:55:54.704]  Oh, but the Haitians that were called conspiracy theorists, turns out they're right again.
[01:55:54.704 --> 01:55:56.845]  Turns out the worst is true.
[01:55:57.825 --> 01:56:01.926]  So we're going to have those reports for you this evening, seven o'clock central, eight o'clock eastern.
[01:56:01.926 --> 01:56:07.888]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, it'll be nine years up and operating in April.
[01:56:07.888 --> 01:56:10.148]  And over the years it's had bugs here and there.
[01:56:10.148 --> 01:56:11.829]  They're pretty much all worked out.
[01:56:11.829 --> 01:56:16.330]  Super fast audio streaming, video streaming, all the films.
[01:56:16.330 --> 01:56:18.210]  Everybody can log in at once, right at seven.
[01:56:18.210 --> 01:56:22.552]  You can even share your passcode with up to six people, so more people can watch it.
[01:56:22.552 --> 01:56:23.892]  One membership's like six memberships.
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:27.721]  You can get 44% off a year membership right now.
[01:56:27.721 --> 01:56:29.343]  We're running that till the end of the month.
[01:56:29.343 --> 01:56:33.987]  And we're also running a 15-day free trial at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:33.987 --> 01:56:37.430]  And it's a more highly produced version of the radio show.
[01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:38.491]  We've got reporters.
[01:56:38.491 --> 01:56:40.172]  We've got guests every day.
[01:56:40.172 --> 01:56:41.534]  I mean, this is a real news show.
[01:56:43.204 --> 01:56:51.188]  And of course, we get about, I don't know, 25-30,000 people, it looks like, log in when it's live and then watch it over the evening.
[01:56:51.188 --> 01:56:56.650]  But then, those of you that are members, 15 cents a day, you fund getting the message out.
[01:56:56.650 --> 01:57:04.674]  We post it on YouTube and a bunch of other sites, and millions a week on the aggregate do watch the show, and it's only five months up and running.
[01:57:05.285 --> 01:57:07.166]  And we're developing it for TV and other systems.
[01:57:07.166 --> 01:57:10.968]  So if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, become one today.
[01:57:10.968 --> 01:57:15.611]  It takes about 15 minutes to go sign up on... 15 minutes.
[01:57:15.611 --> 01:57:16.652]  It takes 15 cents a day.
[01:57:16.652 --> 01:57:18.953]  It takes about a minute and a half to sign up.
[01:57:18.953 --> 01:57:20.714]  Just username, passcode, boom!
[01:57:20.714 --> 01:57:27.678]  But if you're going to share the username and passcode with people, make sure it's not something that you have for your email or your bank account.
[01:57:28.078 --> 01:57:28.138]  Yes.
[01:57:50.131 --> 01:57:53.012]  The end of the month we also have some other specials running.
[01:57:53.012 --> 01:58:05.938]  Remember when you purchase the books, the videos, the t-shirts, you get tools to wake up others, but also you support the news websites, the syndicated radio show, the nightly news show, the films, all the stuff we're doing.
[01:58:05.938 --> 01:58:09.060]  We're at the tip of the spear in support of Ron Paul, everything over the years.
[01:58:10.111 --> 01:58:12.853]  And it's just amazing what we're doing here together.
[01:58:12.853 --> 01:58:21.199]  So check out the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com or call toll-free if you've got any questions of the crew here that can answer your questions.

[01:58:21.819 --> 01:58:22.940]  888-253-3139.
[01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:32.227]  Okay, that's my plug here to fill our gas tanks in the InfoWar.
[01:58:32.227 --> 01:58:38.971]  I'm gonna come back and into more news, then Wayne Paul, brother of Ron Paul, is joining us to give us his take on the incredible election fraud in Iowa.

[01:58:59.765 --> 01:59:09.208]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off, and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:59:09.708 --> 01:59:12.970]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?

[01:59:56.751 --> 01:59:59.512]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.072 --> 02:00:10.893]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.893 --> 02:00:12.493]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.493 --> 02:00:13.873]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:18.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.214 --> 02:00:23.855]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.855 --> 02:00:28.856]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number three.
[02:00:28.856 --> 02:00:30.256]  And I've wanted to go to calls today.
[02:00:30.256 --> 02:00:34.697]  You notice I've been taking more calls because they're so informative and interesting and entertaining, quite frankly.
[02:00:36.252 --> 02:00:41.877]  I don't do an entertainment show, but I do like to be entertained myself and to be entertaining just because it gets boring if we're not.
[02:00:41.877 --> 02:00:45.100]  That's why I screw around a bit, even though I try not to.
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:49.724]  I do horse around quite a bit behind the scenes as well.
[02:00:49.724 --> 02:00:57.691]  But there's a lot of crazy stuff going on and it certainly gallows humor if you get right down to the bottom of it.
[02:00:58.559 --> 02:00:59.940]  We got Wayne Paul coming on.
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:01.061]  I haven't talked to him.
[02:01:01.061 --> 02:01:02.623]  I just had the producers call him.
[02:01:02.623 --> 02:01:13.112]  It was a wild hair about an hour ago to get him on after the break because of the amazing chicanery going on in Iowa.
[02:01:13.112 --> 02:01:17.395]  I'm looking for my stack because when I come out of break, I've got to get back into this.
[02:01:17.395 --> 02:01:23.481]  But they have now come out and said, oh my goodness.
[02:01:26.983 --> 02:01:36.307]  It looks like the election was a big fraud in Iowa, but we're just going to say that Santorum has won.
[02:01:36.307 --> 02:01:39.549]  And there's a big article out on this that's really important.
[02:01:39.549 --> 02:01:40.870]  Media cover-up.
[02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:43.751]  Ron Paul standing.
[02:01:43.751 --> 02:01:48.994]  Not discussed in Iowa vote reshuffle.
[02:01:48.994 --> 02:01:50.814]  That's good, but it's like media cover-up.
[02:01:50.814 --> 02:01:54.696]  Ron Paul blacked out of Iowa vote reshuffle.
[02:01:54.696 --> 02:01:55.937]  He's really been blacked out.
[02:01:57.657 --> 02:01:58.758]  Ron Paul blacked out.
[02:01:58.758 --> 02:02:01.320]  I'm kind of the editor around here and I edit live on air.
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:02.841]  Kurt Blifford, great writer.
[02:02:02.841 --> 02:02:04.362]  I might have him change that headline.
[02:02:04.362 --> 02:02:05.443]  It's even worse than that.
[02:02:05.443 --> 02:02:06.383]  Media cover-up.
[02:02:06.383 --> 02:02:10.546]  Ron Paul standing, not discussed in Iowa vote reshuffle.
[02:02:10.546 --> 02:02:11.667]  Yeah, he's blacked out.
[02:02:11.667 --> 02:02:13.688]  It's just censored out.
[02:02:13.688 --> 02:02:14.449]  Memory hold.
[02:02:14.449 --> 02:02:17.031]  But I don't know if the general public would know memory hold.
[02:02:17.031 --> 02:02:20.874]  I was getting back to 1984.
[02:02:20.874 --> 02:02:23.596]  Oh, here's my stacks of news.
[02:02:23.596 --> 02:02:24.856]  Where they just come out and say,
[02:02:28.758 --> 02:02:35.143]  Iowa's not a real election, but we're just saying Santorum won, and they both share the delegates, I guess.
[02:02:35.143 --> 02:02:38.706]  Just beyond crazy.
[02:02:38.706 --> 02:02:41.849]  So please get that Curtin Emo article out to everyone you know.
[02:02:41.849 --> 02:02:45.112]  And I haven't even gotten into this great news.
[02:02:45.112 --> 02:02:51.377]  Ron Paul introduces legislation to strike NDAA's police state provisions.
[02:02:51.377 --> 02:02:52.858]  That's why we love Ron Paul.
[02:02:52.858 --> 02:02:54.019]  Always standing for liberty.
[02:02:55.936 --> 02:03:02.345]  Telling the globalists the jig's up, calling them on their scams, calling them on their fraud, calling them on all their ridiculous...
[02:03:06.846 --> 02:03:33.626]  Exploits their extreme arrogance, calling them on their absurdist, hubris-filled, rampant mania of thinking they're bulletproof, literally dragging our world towards war, global financial ruination, because we the people have allowed a bunch of control-freak crooks to run wild.
[02:03:36.243 --> 02:03:38.507]  That's what's happened.
[02:03:38.507 --> 02:03:40.229]  You know, you guys just turned the heat on here.
[02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:42.092]  I don't think I've had the heat on here all year.
[02:03:42.092 --> 02:03:44.797]  And I remember they did that fiberglass work.
[02:03:44.797 --> 02:03:47.000]  I think fiberglass is shooting out of there or something.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.386]  I feel like my eyeballs just had sand dumped in them.
[02:03:53.928 --> 02:03:55.348]  I know it's getting hot in here now.
[02:03:55.348 --> 02:03:59.810]  Usually it's about 60 degrees here in the winter because I like it cold.
[02:03:59.810 --> 02:04:04.471]  But I guess now that I've lost like 30 pounds, I don't have my seal blubber as much as I did.
[02:04:04.471 --> 02:04:06.212]  My precious blubber.
[02:04:06.212 --> 02:04:07.312]  So now I'm getting cold.
[02:04:07.312 --> 02:04:11.014]  I'm a little skinny creature.
[02:04:11.014 --> 02:04:13.854]  Folks, I am still way overweight.
[02:04:13.854 --> 02:04:15.215]  Wait, I'm gonna lose 30 more pounds.
[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:20.384]  I've been, uh, it is a plug, now that I think of it.
[02:04:20.384 --> 02:04:27.212]  If you want to lose weight, folks, the reason you're so hungry and eating, eating, eating is the vitamins and minerals aren't in the food, even if it's non-GMO.
[02:04:27.212 --> 02:04:29.976]  Most of it's been depleted, as you know, the soils.
[02:04:32.728 --> 02:04:38.171]  That the grains are being raised from, that the animals eat, that we then eat, all of it.
[02:04:38.171 --> 02:04:41.513]  And so I've got the best products that I've searched and found out there.
[02:04:41.513 --> 02:04:46.636]  The longevity products, the Tangy Tangerine, the Rebound, the Polymburst, those are my favorites.
[02:04:46.636 --> 02:04:48.197]  They've got great whey protein.
[02:04:48.197 --> 02:04:52.499]  It's all available at Infowarsteam.com.

[02:04:58.023 --> 02:04:58.363]  Look at me!
[02:05:05.578 --> 02:05:07.159]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:35.738 --> 02:05:40.040]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:45.983]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.983 --> 02:05:49.544]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:49.544 --> 02:05:51.525]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:51.525 --> 02:05:52.646]  It's here.

[02:06:13.627 --> 02:06:22.350]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:26.411]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:06:26.411 --> 02:06:28.732]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:06:30.834 --> 02:06:42.640]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:44.441]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:44.441 --> 02:06:47.322]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:06:58.228 --> 02:06:59.008]  Got it.
[02:06:59.008 --> 02:06:59.869]  Others don't.
[02:07:01.052 --> 02:07:05.615]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.615 --> 02:07:06.516]  Number one.
[02:07:06.516 --> 02:07:09.958]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.958 --> 02:07:10.799]  Number two.
[02:07:10.799 --> 02:07:15.702]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.702 --> 02:07:16.442]  It's true.
[02:07:16.442 --> 02:07:21.326]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:21.326 --> 02:07:22.146]  Number three.
[02:07:22.146 --> 02:07:25.728]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.728 --> 02:07:29.431]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.631 --> 02:07:30.432]  Number 4.
[02:07:30.432 --> 02:07:33.194]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:33.194 --> 02:07:36.876]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.876 --> 02:07:37.657]  Number 5.
[02:07:37.657 --> 02:07:41.800]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:46.563]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.863 --> 02:07:51.027]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.027 --> 02:07:52.809]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.809 --> 02:07:55.071]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:55.071 --> 02:07:57.894]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:57.894 --> 02:08:04.741]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.741 --> 02:08:07.524]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:28.106 --> 02:08:37.629]  Okay, we got Wayne Paul, brother of Congressman Ron Paul, presidential front-runner Ron Paul, in first or second place, depending on what poll you look at.
[02:08:37.629 --> 02:08:39.970]  On with us, just because I wanted to get his take.
[02:08:39.970 --> 02:08:50.254]  He's a long-time activist, CPA, you know, going after the IRS, exposing the Federal Reserve, you know, just a chip off the family poll block there.
[02:08:50.874 --> 02:08:56.837]  But when I saw this this morning, and it's gotten no media attention, that is dinosaur media.
[02:08:56.837 --> 02:08:59.939]  I mean, they're covering it, but they're not pointing out the obvious.
[02:08:59.939 --> 02:09:01.980]  Here's the headline out of News 14.
[02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:07.083]  Final Iowa tally gives Santorum... We'll show folks a document cam shot of that.
[02:09:07.083 --> 02:09:08.383]  They're listening on the radio.
[02:09:08.383 --> 02:09:10.905]  They can just Google it and pull it up.
[02:09:10.905 --> 02:09:16.928]  But final Iowa tally gives Santorum edge over Romney.
[02:09:16.928 --> 02:09:18.249]  No winner declared.
[02:09:20.339 --> 02:09:33.078]  And it goes over the fact that, well, a whole bunch of the key precincts in Ames, Iowa, where he was running 50 plus percent in the polls, Ron Paul, those just disappeared.
[02:09:34.292 --> 02:09:36.754]  And then we also have the clip we played four or five times.
[02:09:36.754 --> 02:09:55.470]  We could probably queue it up and play it again for Wayne, where we have on Fox News Karl Rove, known for his election manipulation, saying, well, a bunch of the ballots didn't show up, so they all just got behind the scenes together as gentlemen and decided that Santorum was in second.
[02:09:56.428 --> 02:10:01.111]  And that Mitt Romney was in first, and then Ron Paul was in a close third.
[02:10:01.111 --> 02:10:03.953]  And Ron Paul doesn't want to act like a sore loser.
[02:10:03.953 --> 02:10:05.074]  He says, hey, we're doing pretty good.
[02:10:05.074 --> 02:10:08.636]  They did second in New Hampshire.
[02:10:08.636 --> 02:10:14.459]  But the point is, that night, we'd already been told by people that some of the precincts were going to count it a secret.
[02:10:14.459 --> 02:10:17.141]  And why were there trucks driving around that disappeared?
[02:10:17.141 --> 02:10:18.042]  You call it in.
[02:10:19.659 --> 02:10:23.761]  And so now it's admitted that a bunch of these disappeared and stuff went on.
[02:10:23.761 --> 02:10:34.425]  And so the news is saying Santorum first place, Mitt Romney second, and in literally more than 20 articles we pulled up, not one word about Ron Paul.
[02:10:34.425 --> 02:10:37.046]  You would think he was a four-letter word or something.
[02:10:37.666 --> 02:10:38.327]  A cuss word.
[02:10:38.327 --> 02:10:40.149]  I mean, it's just no Ron Paul.
[02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:43.573]  No discussion of him anywhere.
[02:10:43.573 --> 02:10:45.896]  Here is the Des Moines Register.
[02:10:45.896 --> 02:10:47.297]  It's got Rick Santorum.
[02:10:47.297 --> 02:10:47.658]  Total of $29,839.
[02:10:47.658 --> 02:10:48.819]  And it says final total $29,805 for Mitt Romney.
[02:10:56.267 --> 02:11:04.415]  So you see that he's got 30, 34 votes more there, Santorum does, and no discussion of what happened with Ron Paul.
[02:11:04.415 --> 02:11:10.261]  And they go on and admit in these articles, well, they may not even count it now, but here's the numbers.
[02:11:10.261 --> 02:11:14.766]  Final Iowa tally gives Santorum edge over Romney, no winner declared.
[02:11:14.766 --> 02:11:15.366]  Who does that?
[02:11:15.366 --> 02:11:16.547]  Do they have another meeting?
[02:11:17.609 --> 02:11:25.820]  With Karl Rove behind the scenes, I guess with some people that are gentlemanly and have a gentleman's agreement.
[02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:30.467]  So there's no discussion of why did all these precincts not report?
[02:11:30.467 --> 02:11:32.670]  Why was there fraud that got ignored day one?
[02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:34.730]  And where is Ron Paul?
[02:11:34.730 --> 02:11:52.753]  I mean, all of this happening just fits into Ron Paul getting kicked out of debates, or 89 seconds in the debates, or getting the least amount of coverage, or when he does it's negative, and they say he can't win, and shoving Mitt Romney, Santorum, and Gingrich, all globalist flip-floppers on us.
[02:11:52.753 --> 02:11:59.454]  I wanted to get Wayne Paul's take on this, because this really shows how crazy things have gotten.
[02:11:59.454 --> 02:12:01.835]  You know, we were concerned the day before, Wayne, as you know, and
[02:12:02.535 --> 02:12:05.237]  Some folks in the campaign were like, oh no, there's no problem.
[02:12:05.237 --> 02:12:09.159]  But, uh, I mean, what do you do when this type of stuff's going on, Wayne?
[02:12:09.159 --> 02:12:15.382]  Well, I think it's frustrating for all the supporters for Ron Paul.
[02:12:15.382 --> 02:12:27.850]  But even more so, it's gotta be frustrating for the people of Iowa who truly want honest results from votes.
[02:12:27.850 --> 02:12:31.612]  To have a few that manipulate
[02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:33.411]  We're good to go.
[02:12:55.515 --> 02:12:57.497]  Again, Wayne Paul joining us from Texas.
[02:12:57.497 --> 02:13:06.505]  Wayne, though, you cannot debate that a bunch of ballots disappeared, people call in the votes, they'd get changed.
[02:13:06.505 --> 02:13:08.346]  Obviously something went on here.
[02:13:08.346 --> 02:13:17.354]  The Republican leadership counted it in secret, I guess so they could get away with this, and now they admit it's a fraud, but they say, still we're going with these guys.
[02:13:18.115 --> 02:13:20.196]  I mean, this is bizarre!
[02:13:20.196 --> 02:13:23.736]  And again, the media's not even pointing out how bizarre it is.
[02:13:23.736 --> 02:13:26.937]  Why do you... I mean, there's not only fraud here, Wayne, obviously.
[02:13:26.937 --> 02:13:31.779]  What do you think of them not even mentioning your brother as if he even exists?
[02:13:31.779 --> 02:13:40.561]  Well, the major media has attempted to do that since the last go-round four years ago.
[02:13:40.561 --> 02:13:45.082]  I think the other thing that frustrates me about Iowa
[02:13:45.868 --> 02:14:15.213]  Is that before the Iowa straw poll vote was taken, I heard on a YouTube where one of the state Republican people stated, and I heard her voice, can't tell you who it was, but stated that they always consider changing votes to the final, before the final vote.
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:19.426]  Because that's just the way they operate.
[02:14:27.261 --> 02:14:29.963]  The state officials aren't going to let Ron Paul win.
[02:14:29.963 --> 02:14:31.985]  They're going to handle it.
[02:14:31.985 --> 02:14:34.787]  And then we played that clip here.
[02:14:34.787 --> 02:14:38.430]  And then I understand the campaign doesn't want to look like sore losers.
[02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:49.299]  But when there's fraud going on out in the open, I mean, I'm glad that your brother is now suing the people that made this video who claim they work for Huntsman to make your brother look like he doesn't like Asians.
[02:14:49.719 --> 02:14:59.025]  I mean, look what they did to your nephew Rand, claiming he worships Buddha and kidnaps women and isn't a doctor.
[02:14:59.025 --> 02:15:01.907]  Yep.
[02:15:01.907 --> 02:15:16.416]  It's just, unfortunately Alex, it appears to be a sign of our time that those that have the ability to manipulate results
[02:15:17.935 --> 02:15:33.725]  For certain people's benefit, it's that the true, honest, conservative, libertarian individual in America is not seeing what's really happening.
[02:15:33.725 --> 02:15:44.311]  You know, even after the last debate, they showed on CNN or Fox or one of them, the fact that on Twitter,
[02:15:45.111 --> 02:15:52.598]  Ron had positive results on all four or five issues that were spoken to.
[02:15:52.598 --> 02:15:56.441]  But they seemed to brush that off that that was no big deal.
[02:15:59.258 --> 02:16:00.459]  It makes you wonder, doesn't it?
[02:16:28.374 --> 02:16:37.838]  If they'll steal his time and lie about him and ignore him and tell us that they're doing this because they're deciding for us, of course they'll engage in election fraud too.
[02:16:37.838 --> 02:16:42.260]  Do people think they're just going to stop at lying about him and doing all this in the media?
[02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:43.600]  No, they're going to go all the way.
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:44.081]  And they did.
[02:16:44.081 --> 02:16:47.502]  I mean, we've got fraud here, but no investigation is going to happen.
[02:16:47.502 --> 02:16:56.586]  Just like when I found fraud in Travis County, I took it to the state board live on TV and they said, there is fraud, but we're going to certify the Travis County election anyways.
[02:16:59.401 --> 02:17:21.162]  Well, and I really don't know the answer except that each person in each precinct, wherever they're at, whatever state they're in, if they're in South Carolina right now, what are they going to do and how are they going to endure?
[02:17:22.762 --> 02:17:30.644]  That there's honesty that my vote will be counted and be counted honestly.
[02:17:30.644 --> 02:17:35.065]  There has to be a mechanism to be able to do this.
[02:17:35.065 --> 02:17:47.387]  And there are several groups that's trying to create an online instantaneous reporting from each precinct anywhere in any state that's voting.
[02:17:47.387 --> 02:17:50.488]  So that it can be transferred, put up on a screen,
[02:17:56.335 --> 02:17:58.176]  Well, it is because of stuff like that.
[02:17:58.176 --> 02:18:02.579]  People on the ground that we knew about the fraud day one, people like, oh, be quiet.
[02:18:02.579 --> 02:18:07.122]  Day after it's admitted it happened, and two weeks later they're just saying accept the fraud.
[02:18:07.122 --> 02:18:12.626]  I want to come back in one more segment with Wayne Paul, Ron Paul's brother, political activist, patriot in his own right.
[02:18:12.626 --> 02:18:15.689]  But if you could say one thing to your brother, Ron Paul,
[02:18:16.389 --> 02:18:20.712]  Well, A, I would say to Ron, continue the voice that he's had for 30 years.
[02:18:20.712 --> 02:18:22.493]  He needs to reiterate zero taxes are fantastic.
[02:18:22.493 --> 02:18:26.895]  And people all they have to do is look at history from 1835 to 1913.
[02:18:46.741 --> 02:18:58.349]  This country ran on legitimate constitutional taxes of import, export, and excise, and we were extremely successful.
[02:18:58.349 --> 02:19:05.994]  We had extreme amount of growth, and we had a beautiful country to live in, and we need to return to that.
[02:19:08.246 --> 02:19:08.947]  You said it.
[02:19:08.947 --> 02:19:13.290]  I know we're going to get Ron Paul on in the next few weeks.
[02:19:13.290 --> 02:19:20.276]  He's out there really busting his butt, but have you talked to him lately or has he been so busy you haven't had time to talk to him, Wayne?
[02:19:20.276 --> 02:19:29.564]  Well, I had an opportunity to talk to him this past week, but it was primarily on personal
[02:19:31.135 --> 02:19:37.517]  I don't want to get into that.
[02:19:37.517 --> 02:19:41.278]  I just wanted the inside baseball on.
[02:19:41.278 --> 02:19:43.879]  The family's got to be really proud of Ron.
[02:19:43.879 --> 02:19:47.160]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:55.782]  What he has done to awaken the American people and the number of people who support and work diligently for him every day.
[02:19:55.782 --> 02:19:56.442]  It's amazing.
[02:19:56.442 --> 02:19:57.982]  He's Liberty's champion.
[02:19:57.982 --> 02:19:58.683]  Wayne, got a break.
[02:19:58.683 --> 02:19:59.083]  Stay there.
[02:19:59.083 --> 02:19:59.703]  Sorry to interrupt you.
[02:20:01.778 --> 02:20:06.743]  After work, I just want to plop down on the couch and watch TV alone.
[02:20:06.743 --> 02:20:07.523]  Come on!
[02:20:07.523 --> 02:20:08.604]  Don't be like that!
[02:20:08.604 --> 02:20:09.225]  Who are you?
[02:20:09.225 --> 02:20:17.072]  I'm you, 20 years ago, when you were full of energy, better shape, great attitude, and you didn't do so bad with the ladies.
[02:20:17.412 --> 02:20:22.615]  Now that you're older, your testosterone levels are dropping and, well, you're not the guy you used to be.
[02:20:22.615 --> 02:20:25.017]  I'd give anything to feel like you again.
[02:20:25.017 --> 02:20:26.878]  Just try Ageless Male.
[02:20:26.878 --> 02:20:32.421]  It's a natural supplement, proven in a clinical trial to boost testosterone 61%.
[02:20:32.421 --> 02:20:34.162]  And within normal, healthy ranges.
[02:20:34.162 --> 02:20:39.285]  It's not an injection, not a prescription, and with healthy testosterone levels, you can feel the energy again.
[02:20:39.545 --> 02:20:43.287]  Not to mention a better mood and more drive in your romantic life.
[02:20:43.287 --> 02:20:44.748]  More drive, huh?
[02:20:44.748 --> 02:20:46.710]  I really need to try Ageless Mail.
[02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:47.930]  Where's my phone?
[02:20:47.930 --> 02:20:49.051]  You're laying on it.

[02:21:31.278 --> 02:21:32.519]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:32.519 --> 02:21:37.082]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:37.082 --> 02:21:42.886]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:42.886 --> 02:21:46.528]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:46.528 --> 02:21:49.250]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:49.250 --> 02:21:54.313]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:21:54.313 --> 02:21:54.554]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:54.554 --> 02:21:55.955]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:08.483]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:22:08.483 --> 02:22:11.825]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:22:11.825 --> 02:22:16.228]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[02:22:16.228 --> 02:22:17.228]  Here's why.
[02:22:17.228 --> 02:22:23.352]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:22:23.352 --> 02:22:27.835]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:22:28.215 --> 02:22:34.580]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:22:34.580 --> 02:22:38.443]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:22:38.443 --> 02:22:44.387]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:22:44.387 --> 02:22:49.992]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:22:49.992 --> 02:22:50.272]  Go to
[02:22:50.672 --> 02:22:52.999]  MySolarBackup.com for more information.
[02:22:52.999 --> 02:22:55.185]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:23:01.809 --> 02:23:03.070]  Have you ever seen a U.S.
[02:23:03.070 --> 02:23:06.934]  posted stamp featuring Abraham Lincoln, Ben Franklin, or George Washington?
[02:23:06.934 --> 02:23:10.737]  If you're into stamp collecting, you know it's a fun, affordable hobby.
[02:23:10.737 --> 02:23:17.643]  America's leading stamp dealer is the Mystic Stamp Company, and they want you to have their free 140-page color catalog.
[02:23:17.643 --> 02:23:21.387]  Go to mysticstampad.com, the website of the Mystic Stamp Company.
[02:23:21.647 --> 02:23:31.353]  Serving stamp collectors since 1923, Mystic Stamp is well known in the industry for its experience, superior customer service, and an A-plus rating with the Better Business Bureau.

[02:23:36.977 --> 02:23:37.437]  We're good to go.
[02:24:23.968 --> 02:24:36.151]  It is our final segment with Wayne Paul's very busy CPA in his own right and political activist exposing the unconstitutional IRS joining us the middle of his workday here.
[02:24:36.151 --> 02:24:45.094]  We only got a few minutes left but talking to him to finish that question he says he's talked to Ron last weekend he's doing great and super fired up but you can see that on the campaign trail.
[02:24:45.094 --> 02:24:46.594]  Your brother really looks
[02:24:47.174 --> 02:24:50.515]  More happy and fired up than I've ever seen him.
[02:24:50.515 --> 02:24:58.257]  It's gotta be satisfying to see how much he's having an effect waking people up, Wayne.
[02:24:58.257 --> 02:25:00.117]  That's absolutely correct.
[02:25:00.117 --> 02:25:11.140]  I think the other thing that has made him comfortable and more restful is the fact that he's been able to
[02:25:13.945 --> 02:25:20.108]  He's traveled from place to place differently than he did four years ago having to use commercial airlines.
[02:25:20.108 --> 02:25:22.669]  He doesn't do that this time.
[02:25:22.669 --> 02:25:28.092]  Therefore, he's able to get more downtime and restful time, which is what he really needs.
[02:25:28.092 --> 02:25:30.413]  Oh, the airport will beat the daylights out of you.
[02:25:30.413 --> 02:25:35.476]  And when he started flying private, the media made fun of it when all the other candidates do.
[02:25:35.476 --> 02:25:39.098]  I mean, we need him to be getting places faster and getting more rest.
[02:25:39.098 --> 02:25:41.579]  I mean, we need to... It's ridiculous that
[02:25:42.219 --> 02:25:46.002]  Liberty's champion, of course, should be flying around with all his staff.
[02:25:46.002 --> 02:25:54.288]  And I saw the news had to admit, it costs less to fly the 10 or 15 people on a private jet than it does even fly on commercial most times.
[02:25:54.288 --> 02:25:59.451]  That is correct, besides the amount of time saving.
[02:25:59.451 --> 02:26:03.054]  You know, there's an airport 15 minutes from my brother's house.
[02:26:05.424 --> 02:26:09.627]  He can still fly back home at midnight and be in bed before 12.30.
[02:26:29.082 --> 02:26:32.244]  Romney is going to win the Iowa caucuses by 14 votes.
[02:26:32.244 --> 02:26:34.846]  How solid is your evidence?
[02:26:34.846 --> 02:26:36.567]  From a pretty good, reliable source.
[02:26:36.567 --> 02:26:44.652]  They made the correction in Story County, which moved it from an 18 point margin for Santorum to a 4 vote margin for Santorum.
[02:26:44.652 --> 02:26:58.502]  Clinton County, you have the one outstanding precinct in the state, and that it will show an 18 vote victory in that precinct for Mitt Romney, which will give him a statewide victory of 14 votes over Romney.
[02:26:59.022 --> 02:27:01.664]  From out of nowhere, it's Rick Santorum!
[02:27:01.664 --> 02:27:05.707]  You're saying that they've basically come to an agreement as to what the vote's going to be?
[02:27:05.707 --> 02:27:10.730]  The official, the person who's got the official piece of paper is missing.
[02:27:10.730 --> 02:27:15.534]  But the Romney and Santorum people who are monitoring it agree on what the number is.
[02:27:15.534 --> 02:27:23.419]  They've apparently rounded up the representatives of the camps who have agreed, yes, we were there, we know exactly what the vote total was, and we both agree to what it was.
[02:27:25.029 --> 02:27:35.115]  So, Karl Rove magically knew, this was pretty early in the evening that night, what the totals were, and now two weeks later it's an admitted fraud, just as our watchers said.
[02:27:35.115 --> 02:27:41.299]  Ron Paul clearly in every case was getting more votes, and now he's not even mentioned in this, Wayne.
[02:27:41.299 --> 02:27:42.360]  I mean, I go back to this.
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:45.062]  This is a big story.
[02:27:45.062 --> 02:27:51.686]  Well, it is absolutely a big story, but again, I have to emphasize the fact
[02:27:52.759 --> 02:28:05.003]  That the people of Iowa are being shortchanged by those who are manipulating numbers and votes for somebody's eventual gain.
[02:28:05.003 --> 02:28:11.726]  And the people in Iowa ought to be livid on just hearing this stuff.
[02:28:11.726 --> 02:28:12.926]  They ought to take
[02:28:13.618 --> 02:28:18.362]  The Republican Party of the state of Iowa has kicked them all out to start over again.
[02:28:18.362 --> 02:28:18.662]  Yep.
[02:28:18.662 --> 02:28:19.943]  Very frustrating.
[02:28:19.943 --> 02:28:20.364]  Exactly.
[02:28:20.364 --> 02:28:22.405]  They're not even telling us what's going to go on the delegates.
[02:28:22.405 --> 02:28:28.630]  They say the election, the quote is, no winner declared, but they're going to say the winner is Santorum.
[02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:29.651]  Very bizarre.
[02:28:29.651 --> 02:28:30.392]  Yep.
[02:28:30.392 --> 02:28:32.854]  No discussion of where the votes went.
[02:28:32.854 --> 02:28:34.796]  No discussion of redoing it.
[02:28:34.796 --> 02:28:39.700]  And I understand why the campaign's not making a bigger deal out of this, because it can be spun.
[02:28:39.700 --> 02:28:41.361]  They're sore losers, or it might skew.
[02:28:41.361 --> 02:28:42.282]  Of course.
[02:28:44.272 --> 02:28:49.456]  No, and I think the important thing is the positive approach.
[02:28:49.456 --> 02:28:51.177]  I'm saying, okay, that's fine.
[02:28:51.177 --> 02:28:58.622]  Let's head on to New Hampshire and now South Carolina and then wherever Florida or whatever is next.
[02:28:58.622 --> 02:29:12.312]  We'll take them one stage at a time and we'll get the people to support us and eventually they're going to be forced to reckon with us one way or the other and I think
[02:29:13.016 --> 02:29:16.699]  We'll find that out in the next three to six months.
[02:29:16.699 --> 02:29:28.988]  They're going to have to deal with the young people that support my brother, and they've got to decide whether they want him in the Republican Party or they do not want to grow the Republican Party.
[02:29:28.988 --> 02:29:29.488]  That's right.
[02:29:31.002 --> 02:29:32.843]  I live in a very small county.
[02:29:32.843 --> 02:29:33.663]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:29:33.663 --> 02:29:35.964]  Let's go to break and just do a few more minutes on the other side.
[02:29:35.964 --> 02:29:37.465]  Wayne, you've got more to say.
[02:29:37.465 --> 02:29:38.705]  I've been throwing in so many points.
[02:29:38.705 --> 02:29:41.066]  I want to hear what you have to say on the other side.
[02:29:41.066 --> 02:29:44.988]  Then we'll get into all the other news on internet censorship.
[02:29:44.988 --> 02:29:47.309]  There's something a lot bigger than SOPA out there.
[02:29:47.309 --> 02:29:49.130]  I'll tell you about it on the other side.
[02:29:49.130 --> 02:29:50.951]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.951 --> 02:29:52.331]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.331 --> 02:29:54.853]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.853 --> 02:29:57.514]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.611 --> 02:30:04.313]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:04.313 --> 02:30:09.620]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:11.163]  Saving means to make money.
[02:30:11.163 --> 02:30:19.954]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:30:20.675 --> 02:30:28.222]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:30:28.222 --> 02:30:36.229]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:30:36.229 --> 02:30:41.454]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:30:41.454 --> 02:30:43.616]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-
[02:30:45.118 --> 02:30:49.605]  Call 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsub.com.

[02:31:02.481 --> 02:31:06.482]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:06.482 --> 02:31:09.743]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:09.743 --> 02:31:14.544]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:14.544 --> 02:31:20.925]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:20.925 --> 02:31:23.166]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:31:23.706 --> 02:31:24.867]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:31:24.867 --> 02:31:25.647]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:25.647 --> 02:31:27.968]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:42.614 --> 02:31:49.898]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:49.898 --> 02:31:59.003]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:32:01.178 --> 02:32:05.323]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[02:32:05.323 --> 02:32:07.626]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[02:32:07.626 --> 02:32:09.469]  If not yours, your neighbors.
[02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:12.452]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[02:32:12.452 --> 02:32:18.921]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[02:32:19.421 --> 02:32:22.663]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[02:32:22.663 --> 02:32:27.866]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[02:32:27.866 --> 02:32:29.407]  Your greatest dependency.
[02:32:29.407 --> 02:32:30.828]  Your food supply.
[02:32:30.828 --> 02:32:35.011]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[02:32:35.011 --> 02:32:39.314]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.

[02:32:44.936 --> 02:32:45.657]  Take back control in 2012.
[02:32:45.657 --> 02:32:49.259]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:32:49.259 --> 02:32:50.819]  Remember, you can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[02:33:12.685 --> 02:33:24.081]  Okay, political activist, patriot, Wayne Paul, brother of top presidential contender, the only conservative constitutionalist out there, Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:33:24.081 --> 02:33:29.528]  And again, we don't want there to be fraud, but I mean, clearly Ron Paul was the winner in Iowa.
[02:33:29.989 --> 02:33:32.710]  Clearly they've been attacking him, lying about him.
[02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:36.050]  And so understand, folks, we're winning just by Ron Paul running.
[02:33:36.050 --> 02:33:37.630]  We're winning.
[02:33:37.630 --> 02:33:39.671]  Look at where he's come from four years ago.
[02:33:39.671 --> 02:33:44.652]  Look at what Rand's doing in the Senate, trying to block and exposing tyrannical legislation.
[02:33:44.652 --> 02:33:50.993]  They've got all these Campaign for Liberty people who are true constitutionalists now running.
[02:33:50.993 --> 02:33:54.754]  It's going to get exponentially more powerful as we build.
[02:33:54.754 --> 02:33:56.014]  And Ron Paul could win!
[02:33:56.554 --> 02:34:07.519]  I mean, he's gone from nowhere, with the media ignoring him, to number two, probably number one, and the records of the other guys are so pitiful, if we get behind him, it's on.
[02:34:07.519 --> 02:34:12.982]  And folks all over the country, I talk to talk show hosts, you name it, liberals, conservatives, they all love Ron Paul.
[02:34:13.382 --> 02:34:14.483]  I live in a small county in Texas.
[02:34:43.445 --> 02:35:01.952]  And even in our county, four years ago, there was such contempt that because I worked in the precinct and went to the county convention, I was in effect ostracized because of my name.
[02:35:01.952 --> 02:35:07.994]  And it was pretty frustrating to see that happen.
[02:35:09.763 --> 02:35:30.479]  And then to hear our governor at that time at the state convention saying, since we don't have anybody running for president, you can do what you want with your votes, from Texas, and they didn't even grant him favored son status.
[02:35:30.479 --> 02:35:33.241]  Perry wouldn't even grant that to him four years ago.
[02:35:35.154 --> 02:35:36.234]  Well, look at Perry.
[02:35:36.234 --> 02:35:41.477]  He's coming back with his tail between his legs, exposed for working for Al Gore and all the rest of it.
[02:35:41.477 --> 02:35:53.342]  I mean, if one thing we're learning here, the Republican leadership is basically a bunch of globalist, socialist, corporatist Democrats masquerading as conservatives.
[02:35:53.342 --> 02:35:56.543]  Well, it sure looks like that.
[02:35:56.543 --> 02:36:01.385]  And I think the greater issue is what does the Republican Party
[02:36:04.022 --> 02:36:13.671]  Nationwide, statewide, and countywide, what do they want to do to grow their party?
[02:36:13.671 --> 02:36:17.154]  It's evident they're not anxious to do it.
[02:36:17.154 --> 02:36:19.657]  In everything they do, they're showing we don't care.
[02:36:20.365 --> 02:36:22.306]  And that's very unfortunate.
[02:36:39.736 --> 02:36:40.936]  Well, it's not going to happen.
[02:36:40.936 --> 02:36:41.637]  I think the problem
[02:37:08.770 --> 02:37:34.177]  Uh, is that the Republican Party is trying to spread or develop that rumor because they do not want to turn around and defeat our current president because Ron's the only one that can do it and they can't handle it so they're gonna try everything in their power to blame it on somebody else
[02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:37.280]  Except the National Republican Party.
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:38.081]  That's right.
[02:37:38.081 --> 02:38:00.565]  They got to make up their mind because by the time we get to the convention, there's going to be anger on the Republican Party's face because they don't want the young people, they don't want the Libertarians, and they don't want the distant franchise Democrats in their party, and they're going to try to blame it on whomever they can, and it ain't going to happen.
[02:38:01.854 --> 02:38:04.295]  Well, I agree with you, and I've told people that.
[02:38:04.295 --> 02:38:06.356]  I don't think your brother is going to run for third party.
[02:38:06.356 --> 02:38:10.497]  He just doesn't like having an option close to him.
[02:38:10.497 --> 02:38:15.959]  And he has wisdom, you obviously have wisdom, people are hearing it right now, and that's probably a good move.
[02:38:15.959 --> 02:38:20.361]  I just wish there was somebody prominent third party, just so they could be in the debates.
[02:38:20.361 --> 02:38:21.181]  But who knows?
[02:38:21.181 --> 02:38:25.062]  Your brother would probably run third party, and probably have 30% of the vote out of the gate.
[02:38:25.062 --> 02:38:26.963]  They probably wouldn't have him in the debate.
[02:38:26.963 --> 02:38:29.444]  I mean, you know, they're that big of cheats.
[02:38:30.674 --> 02:38:33.259]  Well, it's not going to happen.
[02:38:33.259 --> 02:38:42.095]  The National Republican Party is going to have to make up their mind that they're going to have to deal with it or they're the ones that are going to have egg on their face.
[02:38:42.878 --> 02:38:44.519]  Well, by the way, as you know, you're right.
[02:38:44.519 --> 02:38:53.984]  They've got a whole bunch of polls that have been coming out for six months, and Ron Paul has, for those that don't know, has the highest numbers against Obama.
[02:38:53.984 --> 02:38:58.567]  I mean, he would clean the floor with Obama, wouldn't he, Wayne?
[02:38:58.567 --> 02:39:08.492]  I don't have any doubt in my mind because of his consistency in his stances, in his position in cutting back government.
[02:39:09.741 --> 02:39:20.528]  And in obtaining a greater national defense by bringing our troops home, all of these things resonate with the majority of the people in the United States.
[02:39:21.314 --> 02:39:29.221]  And the $1 trillion first year budget cut, getting rid of the income tax that we built the country without, ending the torture of the secret arrest.
[02:39:29.221 --> 02:39:34.425]  In closing, again, your brother, one of the only sane people in Congress.
[02:39:34.425 --> 02:39:38.309]  He's gotten a few people in under him, but they're not prominent yet.
[02:39:38.309 --> 02:39:43.493]  Ron Paul introduces legislation to strike NDAA's police state provisions.
[02:39:43.493 --> 02:39:44.514]  Boom!
[02:39:44.514 --> 02:39:48.297]  No corporate media coverage of that speech yesterday.
[02:39:49.318 --> 02:39:55.962]  They just said he was up there to do a futile vote against debt increase, which is not futile, doing the right thing.
[02:39:55.962 --> 02:40:07.509]  And it continues with Rand saying he's going to filibuster or block the SOPA bill that goes after the free speech.
[02:40:07.509 --> 02:40:13.412]  What's your take on the NDAA and the fact that the traitor media won't cover that Ron Paul's trying to repeal it?
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:16.982]  Well, I can refer you to Daily Paul.
[02:40:16.982 --> 02:40:21.645]  His total speech is on Daily Paul this morning.
[02:40:21.645 --> 02:40:24.107]  Yes, in fact, we've got it in our article that Nemo did as well.
[02:40:24.107 --> 02:40:27.069]  We probably should have actually played that speech, but we've run out of time.
[02:40:27.069 --> 02:40:29.811]  We'll probably play it on the nightly news this evening.
[02:40:29.811 --> 02:40:38.217]  Boy, I tell you, have you found, Wayne, that that's a wake-up call that the NDAA actually passed the secret arrest of citizens?
[02:40:38.217 --> 02:40:42.820]  Well, again, it points to the people
[02:40:43.872 --> 02:40:47.733]  In power, not caring about the people.
[02:40:47.733 --> 02:40:53.255]  They're not representing the citizens of the United States.
[02:40:53.255 --> 02:40:58.477]  And the citizens of the United States are going to change that this year.
[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:03.801]  Yes, and despite the corporate traitor media.
[02:41:03.801 --> 02:41:08.143]  Wayne, we've been trying to come up with a name for the mainstream media because they're not the mainstream anymore.
[02:41:08.143 --> 02:41:11.644]  The alternative is now the new media is bigger.
[02:41:11.644 --> 02:41:15.065]  I've got a video out today showing major studies showing that.
[02:41:15.065 --> 02:41:16.766]  And I've known this for a couple of years.
[02:41:16.766 --> 02:41:22.908]  What would you call the prestitute, traitor media, globalist media?
[02:41:22.908 --> 02:41:25.649]  Mudstream media.
[02:41:25.649 --> 02:41:26.509]  Mudstream!
[02:41:29.591 --> 02:41:31.332]  Uh, Shirline Media.
[02:41:31.332 --> 02:41:32.953]  There you go.
[02:41:32.953 --> 02:41:34.634]  Or, or Muddle.
[02:41:34.634 --> 02:41:40.098]  Muddle Stream.
[02:41:40.098 --> 02:41:42.740]  The listeners, we're all trying to comb the world for the best name.
[02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:47.763]  M-Mudstream Media.
[02:41:47.763 --> 02:41:48.223]  Oh boy.
[02:41:48.223 --> 02:41:51.385]  Uh, alright.
[02:41:51.385 --> 02:41:53.526]  I'm sorry, go ahead, you were going to say something?
[02:41:53.526 --> 02:41:55.468]  No, no, no, that's alright.
[02:41:55.468 --> 02:41:56.869]  No, go ahead, Wayne, in closing.
[02:41:56.869 --> 02:41:58.710]  Well, I just want to say,
[02:42:00.575 --> 02:42:12.443]  It's people like you and people that want honest, straightforward answers that are going to make the difference in this country in the next six months.
[02:42:12.443 --> 02:42:24.871]  And they will do their quiet revolution in terms of making sure that we get honesty in government, we get limited government, we get stronger military government.
[02:42:24.871 --> 02:42:26.592]  And that's going to take place
[02:42:27.176 --> 02:42:30.802]  Regardless of what the mud screen media puts out there.
[02:42:30.802 --> 02:42:31.302]  There you go.
[02:42:40.595 --> 02:42:41.556]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:42:41.556 --> 02:42:43.396]  I look forward to talking to you again.
[02:42:43.396 --> 02:42:44.677]  It was great talking to you.
[02:42:44.677 --> 02:42:45.958]  Wow, what a great guy.
[02:42:45.958 --> 02:42:52.241]  It's been a pleasure meeting him at different activist events, protesting the Fed and other things.
[02:42:52.241 --> 02:42:53.382]  A great guy out there.
[02:42:53.382 --> 02:42:56.163]  Another chip off the Paul blocks.
[02:42:56.163 --> 02:42:58.564]  Just a great family of people.
[02:42:58.564 --> 02:43:01.786]  And who else is standing up in government against all this evil?
[02:43:01.786 --> 02:43:03.187]  There's just a bunch of traitors.
[02:43:03.187 --> 02:43:05.508]  I mean, I really think it's the traitor media.
[02:43:07.126 --> 02:43:11.130]  The Globalist Occupational Propaganda Division.
[02:43:11.130 --> 02:43:13.813]  The Zombie Control Media.
[02:43:13.813 --> 02:43:17.217]  The Disgraceful Media.
[02:43:17.217 --> 02:43:18.938]  The Disgusting Media.
[02:43:18.938 --> 02:43:20.720]  The Teleprompter Media.
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:22.923]  The Globalist Talking Point Media.
[02:43:22.923 --> 02:43:26.967]  The Slimebag Scumbag Judas Iscariot Media.
[02:43:32.247 --> 02:43:34.068]  Filth media.
[02:43:34.068 --> 02:43:36.170]  The discredited media.
[02:43:36.170 --> 02:43:39.612]  The pompous, know-it-all Decepticon media.
[02:43:39.612 --> 02:43:40.533]  I mean, you could just go on.
[02:43:40.533 --> 02:43:43.095]  There's not enough names for this group of traitors.
[02:43:43.095 --> 02:43:44.756]  Treacherous scum.
[02:43:44.756 --> 02:43:45.516]  Airheads.
[02:43:45.516 --> 02:43:48.899]  Go-along-to-get-along trash.
[02:43:48.899 --> 02:43:50.120]  Maggots.
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:51.681]  Minions of evil.
[02:43:51.681 --> 02:43:52.501]  Sellouts.
[02:43:52.501 --> 02:43:55.984]  Go-along-get-along scum.
[02:43:55.984 --> 02:43:57.545]  The cream of the scum.
[02:43:57.545 --> 02:43:59.166]  The scum stream media.
[02:43:59.166 --> 02:44:00.647]  You guys are all in there chomping at the bit.
[02:44:00.647 --> 02:44:01.288]  You got any names?
[02:44:02.205 --> 02:44:08.513]  I mean, we're just, we're seeking after the grail, because there's such filth that there's not a name yet.
[02:44:08.513 --> 02:44:14.740]  The mudsling media, the mudstream media, those are good, but it's just there's not something good enough.
[02:44:14.740 --> 02:44:17.584]  Prestitute, that's good, but not good enough.
[02:44:17.584 --> 02:44:21.589]  Traitor media, teleprompter media, what is it?
[02:44:24.124 --> 02:44:36.271]  Corporate public relations hack, poser media, the counterfeit media, the counterfeit media, the carpetbagger media, the con artist media.
[02:44:36.271 --> 02:44:43.236]  I mean, I don't know, just the enemy, the enemy media, globalist enemy media.
[02:44:46.391 --> 02:44:47.171]  They're not even meaning it.
[02:44:47.171 --> 02:44:48.132]  It's just an enemy.
[02:44:48.132 --> 02:44:53.394]  It's like a tank with a loudspeaker saying, you know, stand up.
[02:44:53.394 --> 02:44:54.535]  You know, we are your friends.
[02:44:54.535 --> 02:44:56.396]  And then you stand up and they shoot you.
[02:44:56.396 --> 02:44:59.998]  Like Mars attacks, they're aliens are running around with big loudspeakers laughing.
[02:44:59.998 --> 02:45:00.658]  Like, don't run.
[02:45:00.658 --> 02:45:03.800]  We are your friends shooting people.
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:05.020]  It's a military operation.
[02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:06.181]  It's a globalist propaganda.
[02:45:06.181 --> 02:45:07.081]  It is the enemy.
[02:45:07.081 --> 02:45:09.462]  I mean, it's not like they've got some bias.
[02:45:09.462 --> 02:45:10.223]  These are scum.
[02:45:11.943 --> 02:45:36.716]  Okay, and they've got giant stables, giant bevies of little prostitutes that just want to put their makeup on and act cool and climb the social trader sycophant media ladder, who will just run around in giant mass just doing whatever they're told, just groveling on hand and knee to the system so they can sit there in little fancy suits with makeup on, looking real authoritative, lying to zombie fluoride heads.
[02:45:41.929 --> 02:45:43.170]  I'm in a busy beaver.
[02:45:43.170 --> 02:45:45.271]  I was on Coast to Coast AM last night.
[02:45:45.271 --> 02:45:47.051]  I did two radio interviews this morning.
[02:45:47.051 --> 02:45:49.933]  I am doing the nightly news this evening.
[02:45:49.933 --> 02:45:51.814]  And I am going to do RT today.
[02:45:51.814 --> 02:45:56.636]  And you don't want to miss these shows coming up 7 o'clock every evening.
[02:45:56.636 --> 02:45:57.596]  They're powerful.
[02:45:57.596 --> 02:46:01.418]  Now, here was one of our top stories today, because it deals with us.
[02:46:01.418 --> 02:46:06.841]  And it deals with Infowars.com, tip of the spear, and all the things
[02:46:08.496 --> 02:46:13.739]  That the system has been doing to try to censor us and shut us down.
[02:46:13.739 --> 02:46:18.542]  But there's an article that Paul Watson did this morning, because it hit me last night.
[02:46:18.542 --> 02:46:22.764]  Everything that Google says they're fighting in SOPA, they're already doing.
[02:46:22.764 --> 02:46:25.746]  They're already taking websites down under government request.
[02:46:25.746 --> 02:46:26.706]  They're already banning.
[02:46:26.706 --> 02:46:29.108]  They've already delisted us from most of their search engines.
[02:46:30.612 --> 02:46:36.655]  Kicking us off the news feature a few years ago, when Obama started running.
[02:46:36.655 --> 02:46:44.040]  They even deleted videos where we were bullhorning Schmidt, the head of Google, at Bilderberg.
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:46.241]  I mean, they're censoring us and I'm sick of it!
[02:46:47.162 --> 02:46:49.043]  You understand they're already doing it.
[02:46:49.043 --> 02:46:53.606]  They just don't want the knuckle-dragging government to have the control because they've already got it.
[02:46:53.606 --> 02:46:57.429]  This article is important, and folks, they are trying to censor it, so I hope you get it out to everybody.
[02:46:57.429 --> 02:47:03.893]  I hope you realize, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, the nightly news, the radio show, what we do.
[02:47:03.893 --> 02:47:07.155]  If the globalists have their way, you're not going to be hearing this.
[02:47:07.155 --> 02:47:07.415]  Okay?
[02:47:07.415 --> 02:47:08.036]  This is real!
[02:47:09.414 --> 02:47:12.076]  The White House Regulations Czar says they want to shut us down.
[02:47:12.076 --> 02:47:14.397]  I'm on the White House enemies list.
[02:47:14.397 --> 02:47:16.158]  I'm under surveillance.
[02:47:16.158 --> 02:47:19.100]  I'm doing this out in front of everybody.
[02:47:19.100 --> 02:47:26.584]  In front of God and the rest of the world, I'm out here calling these demons on the carpet as child kidnapping, narcotics trafficking murderers.
[02:47:26.584 --> 02:47:27.245]  And they are!
[02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:30.021]  You're like, well why haven't they killed you?
[02:47:30.021 --> 02:47:36.145]  Because if they kill me, it highlights everything I've said, it puts an exclamation point on me, behind everything I've said.
[02:47:36.145 --> 02:47:39.347]  But let me tell you, they can start shutting us down, they will come after me.
[02:47:39.347 --> 02:47:47.152]  They'll start shutting me down in the years to come, and throwing dirt and PR campaigns ahead of it, and they'll set me up, kill me, whatever.
[02:47:48.629 --> 02:47:50.150]  But they still can't stop us.
[02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:52.532]  It's just individually, I'd like that not to happen.
[02:47:52.532 --> 02:47:57.676]  So I hope you'll continue to spread the word to your email list, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, everywhere.
[02:47:57.676 --> 02:47:58.936]  InfoWars.com.
[02:47:58.936 --> 02:48:01.498]  There's a reason they've got armies of trolls after us.
[02:48:01.498 --> 02:48:08.884]  There's a reason the system is always demonizing, because I'm a symbol as well of just an average person saying, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:48:08.884 --> 02:48:12.786]  And if they can tear down Ron Paul or tear down Alex Jones, they can tear down you.
[02:48:13.789 --> 02:48:19.714]  Like it or not, Ron Paul, Alex Jones, and a few others, we are what is representative of the Liberty Movement.
[02:48:19.714 --> 02:48:21.956]  I never even tried to become this prominent.
[02:48:21.956 --> 02:48:27.941]  I just am like a pit bull and I keep coming, so I've had incredible success thanks to your support.
[02:48:27.941 --> 02:48:32.325]  But we are, we belong to you now, you understand that?
[02:48:32.325 --> 02:48:33.826]  I am you, you are me.
[02:48:33.826 --> 02:48:37.809]  If they are able to do this, it's a bad day.
[02:48:37.809 --> 02:48:39.971]  If they take me out, who will take my place?
[02:48:39.971 --> 02:48:40.792]  That's another question.
[02:48:42.022 --> 02:48:42.983]  This article is important.
[02:48:42.983 --> 02:48:45.345]  I'm going to try to get to it.
[02:48:45.345 --> 02:48:49.007]  Google is already using SOPA-like censorship, and it's totally proven here.
[02:48:49.007 --> 02:48:53.751]  Web giant Blacklist websites follows government orders to remove material.
[02:48:53.751 --> 02:49:01.757]  Despite Google's much-heralded support for the anti-SOPA movement, the web giant is already enforcing SOPA-like policies of its own.
[02:49:01.757 --> 02:49:04.480]  Blacklisting legitimate websites from its news aggregator
[02:49:05.140 --> 02:49:09.523]  Following government orders to remove material from its search results in YouTube.
[02:49:09.523 --> 02:49:15.468]  They've also confirmed that they block our view counters going up, but then with establishment stuff they don't block the view counters.
[02:49:15.468 --> 02:49:17.009]  We've confirmed that.
[02:49:17.009 --> 02:49:19.791]  Before I was like, no, it's a normal caching issue.
[02:49:19.791 --> 02:49:24.174]  Yeah, they're covering censorship with that.
[02:49:24.174 --> 02:49:25.816]  As major internet giants,
[02:49:26.969 --> 02:49:30.130]  Joined forces yesterday to protest legislation that would hand the U.S.
[02:49:30.130 --> 02:49:35.751]  government power to arbitrarily seize websites with no legal process under the pretext of copyright infringement.
[02:49:35.751 --> 02:49:43.213]  Google slapped a black censorship image over its logo and urged people to sign an anti-SOPA petition.
[02:49:43.213 --> 02:49:47.293]  This was accrued over 5 million signees.
[02:49:47.293 --> 02:49:49.654]  However, Google's main issue with SOPA
[02:49:51.420 --> 02:50:06.749]  It's seemingly not related to the concerns about Chinese-style web censorship becoming commonplace, but rather which entity gets to wield those powers, large transnational corporations or governments that are now footstools to them.
[02:50:06.749 --> 02:50:14.494]  While Google criticized SOPA publicly, it is already privately using SOPA-like powers to unfairly marginalize legitimate web content.
[02:50:15.788 --> 02:50:23.316]  Google News is a content aggregator that allows users to search thousands of news sources for relevant stories.
[02:50:23.316 --> 02:50:36.811]  Although the aggregator includes a plethora of obscene, occasionally offensive, and barely read websites, in November 2010, Google took the decision to delist PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com from its index news sources.
[02:50:37.592 --> 02:50:49.115]  InfoWars.com alone is internationally recognized news website and gets more traffic than MSNBC and many other big sites combined and innumerable other big mainstream news websites.
[02:50:49.115 --> 02:50:59.698]  Our articles routinely are featured on the Drudge Report, which itself is renowned as the primary agenda-setting news website in the United States, driving more traffic than the New York Times, Facebook, Twitter combined.
[02:50:59.698 --> 02:51:00.558]  We'll be back with more.
[02:51:02.003 --> 02:51:07.367]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits?
[02:51:07.367 --> 02:51:13.772]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after a big disaster strikes!
[02:51:13.772 --> 02:51:18.595]  You would be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now!
[02:51:18.595 --> 02:51:22.178]  123survivalplan.com has set up a for patriots only video

[02:53:01.454 --> 02:53:03.716]  Introducing a diabetes breakthrough.
[02:53:03.716 --> 02:53:07.320]  An easy, natural, organic way to bring relief to diabetics.
[02:53:07.320 --> 02:53:09.301]  Introducing MDS Forte.
[02:53:09.301 --> 02:53:13.305]  A concentrated super strength extract formulated for those who are looking for relief.
[02:53:13.305 --> 02:53:15.367]  What can MDS Forte do for you?

[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:12.635]  Yeah, we all have stood together against Soapbub, but the real menace is lurking in plain view.
[02:54:12.635 --> 02:54:15.640]  And it's the NSA, CIA-created Googler.
[02:54:18.460 --> 02:54:33.305]  And, you know, it is a badge of honor that they've delisted us, but again, because routinely our articles, whatever was the newest and the most popular, would kind of algorithm those two together, and that would put you at the top.
[02:54:33.305 --> 02:54:39.026]  And I guess they didn't like when there was a London bombing that our articles were the top for a week, being read by millions.
[02:54:39.026 --> 02:54:41.147]  I guess they didn't like that we were able to win.
[02:54:41.147 --> 02:54:46.709]  You know, you put us on the field, and with our analysis and understanding, we were challenging them.
[02:54:47.668 --> 02:54:54.092]  And so, bye-bye InfoWars.com, bye-bye PrisonPlanet.com, bye-bye!
[02:54:54.092 --> 02:54:56.674]  And Google is doing... People say, well, they're a private corporation.
[02:54:56.674 --> 02:55:00.776]  No, they've created basically a monopoly, and they operate like it's free and fair.
[02:55:00.776 --> 02:55:04.118]  That's why they're getting in antitrust trouble.
[02:55:04.118 --> 02:55:08.541]  Continuing, InfoWars.com alone is internationally recognized, but it's not listed.
[02:55:08.541 --> 02:55:16.826]  We're on XM, over 100 radio stations, award-winning, linked on the Drudge Report, the number one news site in the world, not just the U.S.
[02:55:17.726 --> 02:55:18.587]  And it just goes on.
[02:55:18.587 --> 02:55:19.768]  None of that matters.
[02:55:19.768 --> 02:55:25.532]  They say we're not media because they're God.
[02:55:25.532 --> 02:55:26.112]  And it goes on.
[02:55:26.112 --> 02:55:28.814]  InfoWars owner Alex Jones is a nationally syndicated radio host.
[02:55:28.814 --> 02:55:33.057]  His broadcast appears on an ever-expanding list of big radio stations across the country.
[02:55:33.057 --> 02:55:40.723]  Jones has been afforded feature profiles on Rolling Stone, New York Magazine, many others, acknowledging the role as a pioneer in world media.
[02:55:41.443 --> 02:55:43.606]  Trade publications have said the same thing.
[02:55:43.606 --> 02:55:52.436]  Infowars.com is clearly a legitimate and important news website that features original content which routinely makes an impact and occasionally goes viral.
[02:55:52.436 --> 02:55:53.477]  Goes viral every day.
[02:55:53.477 --> 02:55:55.259]  That's Watson being understated.
[02:55:56.620 --> 02:56:02.883]  And yet Google delisted the websites from its news aggregator on a whim with no explanation provided.
[02:56:02.883 --> 02:56:11.187]  Since Google and its owner Eric Schmidt are prominent financial contributors to the Obama campaign, we can only assume we were blacklisted for political reasons.
[02:56:11.187 --> 02:56:14.048]  They were shutting down videos of Schmidt at Bilderberg.
[02:56:14.048 --> 02:56:16.429]  And he's like, I don't want me, I don't want, you know, that on there.
[02:56:17.861 --> 02:56:25.263]  Whether you concur with our political stance or are radically against it, what can't be argued is that we are a legitimate news outfit.
[02:56:25.263 --> 02:56:29.784]  But Google has arbitrarily banned us from appearing on their news search results.
[02:56:29.784 --> 02:56:31.344]  But it doesn't stop there.
[02:56:31.344 --> 02:56:37.605]  There is a clear example of how Google is already enforcing SOPA-like rules of its own choosing.
[02:56:37.605 --> 02:56:39.846]  The Feds just ordered things delisted outside of court.
[02:56:40.786 --> 02:56:44.950]  Without the need for any law to be passed or by any legislative body.
[02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:45.590]  And it goes on.
[02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:59.541]  In addition, while concerns rage about the state obtaining the power to shut down websites and remove web content with no recourse, Google is already following, we have links to that, orders from the federal government in the majority of cases
[02:57:00.462 --> 02:57:08.145]  Removing videos from YouTube platform, including takedowns on the grounds that quote, videos contain government criticism.
[02:57:08.145 --> 02:57:09.485]  Google admits that.
[02:57:09.485 --> 02:57:11.286]  Government criticism is taken down.
[02:57:11.286 --> 02:57:13.867]  I mean, right there, that's it.
[02:57:13.867 --> 02:57:15.608]  Where's all the cause celebs now?
[02:57:15.608 --> 02:57:18.089]  I mean, this is already going on.
[02:57:18.089 --> 02:57:21.110]  And Microsoft and the rest of them help the Communist Chinese censor their people.
[02:57:22.020 --> 02:57:34.486]  Google-owned YouTube has complied with thousands of requests worldwide to remove political protest videos that are clearly not in violation of any copyright or national security interest and do not constitute defamation.
[02:57:34.486 --> 02:57:43.369]  The number of takedown orders received from Google from authorities based in the United States rose dramatically over the past year, with demands to remove information increasing by 70%.
[02:57:45.715 --> 02:57:49.238]  Yeah, they took down our Obama deception when one video had like 9 million views.
[02:57:49.238 --> 02:57:50.079]  I threatened to sue them.
[02:57:50.079 --> 02:57:51.300]  It suddenly went right back up.
[02:57:51.300 --> 02:57:52.741]  I said, we know you took it down.
[02:57:52.741 --> 02:57:54.002]  It isn't a hack.
[02:57:54.002 --> 02:57:55.123]  I'm going to sue you.
[02:57:55.123 --> 02:57:56.084]  You got 24 hours.
[02:57:56.084 --> 02:57:57.505]  Boom, right back up.
[02:57:57.505 --> 02:58:02.469]  Because I was, I guess they must tap my phone, the government or something, because I was calling the lawyers.
[02:58:02.469 --> 02:58:04.651]  I mean, they knew and it went right back up.
[02:58:06.111 --> 02:58:07.472]  I'm looking at suing you right now.
[02:58:07.472 --> 02:58:08.852]  I'm going to be honest.
[02:58:08.852 --> 02:58:11.853]  Because you're sitting on us.
[02:58:11.853 --> 02:58:13.274]  You're blocking us.
[02:58:13.274 --> 02:58:14.454]  I don't like it.
[02:58:14.454 --> 02:58:15.435]  Let me on the field.
[02:58:15.435 --> 02:58:17.115]  I'll clean all their clocks.
[02:58:17.115 --> 02:58:18.396]  But you don't want that, do you?
[02:58:18.396 --> 02:58:21.457]  You want to keep everybody in the dark just like you want to block out Ron Paul.
[02:58:22.588 --> 02:58:26.149]  They go through just page after page of example of their wicked censorship.
[02:58:26.149 --> 02:58:28.130]  All bibliographed, and that's why they hate us.
[02:58:28.130 --> 02:58:29.711]  Because our articles are all documented.
[02:58:29.711 --> 02:58:30.871]  Alright?
[02:58:30.871 --> 02:58:35.713]  I mean, compared to the corporate dinosaur devil media, our accuracy is off the charts.
[02:58:35.713 --> 02:58:39.254]  We try to tell the truth, and we're affecting history!
[02:58:39.254 --> 02:58:40.854]  So get this article out to everybody!
[02:58:40.854 --> 02:58:45.936]  Thank you for listening to... Lose the internet or lose it!
[02:58:45.936 --> 02:58:47.837]  Defend everybody!
[02:58:47.837 --> 02:58:49.437]  Hang together or hang separate!
[02:58:49.437 --> 02:58:50.698]  Hang together or hang separate!
