[00:00.000 --> 00:25.800]  It's Monday, February 6th, 2022, Stratus Delta, 123, Info Wars, Tomorrow's News, today.
[00:25.800 --> 00:32.160]  It's Monday, February 6th, 2023, that still takes some getting used to.
[00:32.160 --> 00:37.080]  I've tried to explain to people for a long time that there is a fight between good and
[00:37.080 --> 00:43.720]  evil and that Satan has a signature and that Satan is using culture to get us to destroy
[00:43.720 --> 00:44.720]  ourselves.
[00:44.720 --> 00:49.920]  I told you a lot of stories about myself and others when I went out to Hollywood and pretty
[00:49.920 --> 01:00.520]  much instantly got taken to the top of it, that it was open Satanism and Luciferianism.
[01:00.520 --> 01:10.400]  And now every major performance that gets the main focus of a Super Bowl or the Olympics
[01:10.400 --> 01:13.240]  or the Grammys is a Satanic ritual.
[01:13.240 --> 01:18.800]  They'll normally give the different deities ancient names, but now that's not enough
[01:18.800 --> 01:20.240]  for them.
[01:20.240 --> 01:27.360]  They're openly having people dance around in top hats with women in cages as sex slaves.
[01:27.360 --> 01:32.800]  And when you think about this and you see what goes on in Hollywood and the people really
[01:32.800 --> 01:38.480]  in the cages and the pedophilia and all the rest of it, they are throwing this in your
[01:38.480 --> 01:40.800]  face.
[01:40.800 --> 01:49.080]  And of course both the quote stars, British pop star, Sam Smith is non-binary along with
[01:49.080 --> 01:52.640]  Petrus who is a man saying he's a woman.
[01:52.640 --> 01:58.680]  And when you go to the drag queen story time events or you see the video online or you
[01:58.680 --> 02:06.880]  see the city council meetings, it's men dressed like clowns that then go and say we are women
[02:06.880 --> 02:12.000]  so it's lie upon lie upon lie and we want access to your children.
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.080]  And their regalia is that of satanic clowns, the archetype in all ancient societies of
[02:19.080 --> 02:24.440]  the most dangerous demons.
[02:24.440 --> 02:29.560]  And then you see things like the Olympics with a grim reaper coming down the sky and
[02:29.560 --> 02:34.480]  killing a bunch of little children and that was a little prelude with a big COVID virus
[02:34.480 --> 02:42.280]  with spike protein sticking out of it, killing the children and the nurses delivering the
[02:42.280 --> 02:46.440]  children into the hands of the grim reaper.
[02:46.440 --> 02:59.760]  They believe they have to throw it in your face and that is indeed what they are doing.
[02:59.760 --> 03:07.920]  Madonna famously likes to act like she's a priest or a puritan but then she defiles
[03:07.920 --> 03:12.040]  God or she dresses up like Baphomet.
[03:12.040 --> 03:18.720]  They're telling you who they work for and it's funny, I've been friends with Mark
[03:18.720 --> 03:23.080]  Dice for I don't know 15, 16 years but he's a hard guy to get on the show.
[03:23.080 --> 03:28.880]  He called me yesterday just about some other issues and we were talking about censorship
[03:28.880 --> 03:31.720]  and I said you've got to come on this week and talk about the satanic agenda.
[03:31.720 --> 03:37.560]  I of course didn't know the Grammys were about to come on and basically be a star studded
[03:37.560 --> 03:41.560]  event of open satanism.
[03:41.560 --> 03:45.800]  We had a lot of big stories today but I'm going to hit this, we have two big guests
[03:45.800 --> 03:55.720]  as well, Mike Lindell and Roger Stone but there's a little cherry on top of all of this
[03:55.720 --> 04:05.120]  and guess who the main sponsor of this was last night, brought to you by Pfizer and it
[04:05.120 --> 04:15.120]  doesn't get any more satanic than forcing deadly injections on people that destroy their
[04:15.120 --> 04:22.720]  fertility, lower their life expectancy and give them horribly degenerative painful diseases.
[04:22.720 --> 04:27.080]  The Grammys brought to you by Pfizer.
[04:27.080 --> 04:30.640]  So that's all coming up today and we've got so much more, we're going to join some stations
[04:30.640 --> 04:34.840]  in 60 seconds, World Health Organization has officially put out their new global treaty
[04:34.840 --> 04:40.400]  to ban all free speech, take over your body and forcibly inject you and global surveillance.
[04:40.400 --> 04:45.960]  Bank of America CEO says we're preparing for possible U.S. get default and bail ins, Bill
[04:45.960 --> 04:50.880]  Gates announces the plan to ban beef and make you eat bugs, we've got specifics and just
[04:50.880 --> 05:01.480]  so much more here today, you do not want to miss this Monday of February 6th transmission.
[05:01.480 --> 05:06.280]  The good news is the real red pill plus after over two years being sold out because the key
[05:06.280 --> 05:10.320]  ingredients are not available but supply chain breakdowns is finally back in stock in the
[05:10.320 --> 05:11.480]  last month.
[05:11.480 --> 05:15.240]  The bad news is we did a limited run of it and it's almost sold out.
[05:15.240 --> 05:19.760]  So we're in late January when I'm cutting this, only seven days left to get the real

[05:36.680 --> 05:39.440]  doctor who had a similar formula five years ago.

[06:23.440 --> 06:28.800]  This is Alex Jones.
[06:28.800 --> 06:34.080]  Human civilizations for thousands and thousands and thousands of years follow a cycle of death
[06:34.080 --> 06:44.040]  and rebirth and always at the end of a civilization, open devil worship Satan worship begins and
[06:44.040 --> 06:48.240]  the left will claim, oh that's a Christian construct, the devil, no it's not, it's in
[06:48.240 --> 06:54.880]  every culture in every age and when you start seeing the type of rituals being conducted
[06:54.880 --> 07:03.320]  in public by the establishment, they are ushering in everyone's destruction and Satan knows exactly
[07:03.320 --> 07:05.600]  what he's doing.
[07:05.600 --> 07:13.960]  Fat men saying they're women, dressed like clowns, being worshipped on stage, that is
[07:13.960 --> 07:23.760]  the uniform of these individuals showing women sex slaves in cages being beaten by female
[07:23.760 --> 07:27.920]  devils with bull whips.
[07:27.920 --> 07:37.600]  Now they have national TV ads by Gillette Nother saying if a man asks a woman out it's
[07:37.600 --> 07:44.480]  a harassment, well the word mother and father is bad, but if you have an event like this
[07:44.480 --> 07:52.840]  where Petrus is this man dressed like a woman in the sex slave cage surrounded by devils
[07:52.840 --> 08:01.160]  and then the non-baronary fat man is being worshipped while he wears a top hat with devil
[08:01.160 --> 08:12.360]  horns and do me a favor guys, I mean I was aware of who these people are and the latest
[08:12.360 --> 08:15.560]  thing being pushed by the globals in Hollywood is their official corporate message brought
[08:15.560 --> 08:20.280]  to you literally by Pfizer but will you print me out the lyrics to this particular song
[08:20.280 --> 08:28.320]  and there were other satanic songs and rituals conducted last night for the audience that
[08:28.320 --> 08:31.240]  was tuning in.
[08:31.240 --> 08:36.480]  Now the Grammys has gotten record low ratings the last 15 years, it goes down every year,
[08:36.480 --> 08:45.360]  a rerun of The Simpsons gets more views but they're now pleading with their ghost dance
[08:45.360 --> 08:51.640]  to their god to make themselves relevant again.
[08:51.640 --> 08:59.360]  Bruce it's the top of this, a bunch of people like Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein
[08:59.360 --> 09:13.360]  and they are flaunting this in your face and in Hollywood the main camp is satanic pedophiles
[09:13.360 --> 09:29.440]  that speak for itself, if you're an crowd fan theirs will take no more, people believe
[09:29.440 --> 09:32.720]  that this becomes what you need to lose your power.
[09:32.720 --> 09:41.180]  Since I was statement Bread itself, what would it be for the people around me now, blind
[09:41.180 --> 09:57.000]  Now this is only the outward coming out by these people that's pull up the b-roll of
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.500]  drag queen pedophile Tom around the country where the men dress like satanic clowns and
[10:01.500 --> 10:06.060]  say we are women we're stealing your identity we're saying a woman is a fat clown and we're
[10:06.060 --> 10:10.580]  going to groom your children and we want access to your children and no one will stop us or
[10:10.580 --> 10:16.220]  the San Francisco gay choir saying we're coming for your small children we're going to take them
[10:16.220 --> 10:19.300]  we're going to teach them you'll never stop us and then you'll finally join us and they all
[10:19.300 --> 10:28.500]  look completely psychotic because this is a spirit ladies and gentlemen and these folks have
[10:28.500 --> 10:40.500]  signed onto it big time member of the kids cartoon blues clothes it's a big fat man dressed
[10:40.500 --> 10:49.140]  like a clown with batho Matt and Moloch in the background and the children are riding on a
[10:49.140 --> 10:59.980]  float at a parade that is Moloch the the the bull that children would be thrown on to with a
[10:59.980 --> 11:14.260]  burning burning fire here's the words to the song by Sam Smith and Kim Petrus it's called
[11:14.260 --> 11:23.700]  unholy mommy don't know daddy's getting hot at the body shop doing something unholy he
[11:23.700 --> 11:28.580]  like it he like it yeah he like he like it yeah a lucky lucky girl she got married to a
[11:28.580 --> 11:36.020]  boy like you she'd kick you out if she ever ever about all that you tell me that you do
[11:36.020 --> 11:42.620]  dirty dirty boy you know everyone is talking on the scene I hear them whisper about the
[11:42.620 --> 11:51.340]  places that you've been and how you don't know how to keep your business clean and it
[11:51.340 --> 11:58.500]  just goes on from there and again this is a bunch of slaves these are a bunch of twits
[11:58.500 --> 12:04.020]  there they're doing what they're told and they're putting out the message literally
[12:04.020 --> 12:12.020]  every break when they went to break brought to you by Pfizer what does that tell you about
[12:12.020 --> 12:18.540]  Pfizer well you think dancing around in devil outfits is cool and that's how I've always
[12:18.540 --> 12:25.740]  described that they sell satanism is cool by a bunch of hot devil cheerleaders in close
[12:25.740 --> 12:33.860]  fitting latex with devil horns that's how I've described it for decades how they sell
[12:33.860 --> 12:40.460]  satanism but when you actually really get into it it's wars and famine and calamities
[12:40.460 --> 12:55.380]  and starving and dead children and absolute pain and distrust and just an age of destruction
[12:55.380 --> 13:01.020]  so here's what's really satanic world health organization pandemic treaty a fresh push

[22:37.540 --> 23:04.700]  last little part here is that you'll have to break
[23:04.700 --> 23:13.260]  now if you're a radio listener I'll describe it for you he's conjured as a devil that comes
[23:13.260 --> 23:17.700]  up out of the ground as the voodoo dances around him and when it's time for him to leave
[23:17.700 --> 23:27.900]  they get in a circle and push him back into hell and all of this is archetypes to open
[23:27.900 --> 23:34.180]  up your subconscious mind to this when your subconscious mind sees this it knows that
[23:34.180 --> 23:38.980]  it's in grave danger and if you're not conscious of it you then go into a form of Stockholm
[23:38.980 --> 23:48.460]  syndrome all this is is like a anglerfish it has a glowing light on a little little
[23:48.460 --> 23:52.660]  tentacle on the front of its head five thousand feet under the ocean and little fish swim
[23:52.660 --> 23:57.020]  up thinking it's something to eat and they get eaten so it dangles the image of beautiful
[23:57.020 --> 24:01.980]  women out in front of you and then tells you don't worry about those red horns those red
[24:01.980 --> 24:13.060]  teeth come closer we will fulfill you because God has laws in natural law in the universe
[24:13.060 --> 24:17.260]  and you've got to be shown in the fine print of what they are and who they are and how
[24:17.260 --> 24:26.620]  they're going to enslave you you've got to be given a chance to reject this and that's
[24:26.620 --> 24:34.860]  why they do this but they should know people ask all the time on the street why do you
[24:34.860 --> 24:42.620]  have a skull and an armor piercing dagger and angel wings on a table in your studio and
[24:42.620 --> 24:51.900]  I was studying ancient symbols and I was studying the book of exodus and other books of the
[24:51.900 --> 24:59.060]  bible and descriptions of the angel of death the angel of death isn't really described
[24:59.060 --> 25:04.140]  like a grim reaper that started back in the black plague in Europe mainly in Italy is
[25:04.140 --> 25:09.860]  where you first see the grim reaper pop up this archetype is actually the symbol of the
[25:09.860 --> 25:16.140]  angel of death that is not in Satan's army but is in God's army so that is a symbol
[25:16.140 --> 25:21.420]  on to remind me of how short life is and that we are eternal beings and I cannot fear those
[25:21.420 --> 25:27.060]  that can kill my body but either can kill my soul so there is real power on that desk
[25:27.060 --> 25:33.420]  not power I control not power I wield a reminder to the Satanist every day what was carved
[25:33.420 --> 25:40.100]  for thousands of years on Christians tombstones was not even the cross but that the winged
[25:40.100 --> 25:53.260]  skull that is the real power God gave us life God gave us death these Satanist fear death
[25:53.260 --> 26:02.660]  so much and they want to take as many of us with them as they can so there you have the
[26:02.660 --> 26:09.300]  cross the skull and the reminder that we are eternal beings and that though life is transitory
[26:09.300 --> 26:20.100]  in this body the angel of death is a deliverer to the faithful and the end for the unfaithful
[26:20.100 --> 26:24.980]  who will be committed to be amongst their own spiritual kind for eternity and something
[26:24.980 --> 26:31.980]  far worse than the phantom zone so if you want to know where all these devils are going
[26:31.980 --> 26:37.500]  that's who is coming for them not their Satan that they worship and that they bow down to
[26:37.500 --> 26:47.460]  but the real God of the universe that controls life the wings eternal wings they're all
[26:47.460 --> 26:53.580]  space and time and of course the transitory nature of our human bodies and death you
[26:53.580 --> 27:07.780]  have to understand folks whether it's Lady Gaga or whether it is any of these people
[27:07.780 --> 27:15.460]  they're into Satanism and it's what they follow now a lot of groups and organizations actually
[27:15.460 --> 27:27.220]  get out of it before it's too late but when you talk about solace emptiness these people
[27:27.220 --> 27:37.500]  are slaves and what they're asking their God to do is pass them over because they're going
[27:37.500 --> 27:42.620]  to give innocence unborn babies children that are mutilated children that are put on all
[27:42.620 --> 27:52.100]  these drugs people that are killed by the shots all of these are offerings to their
[27:52.100 --> 28:02.540]  God or like blood they put up of the lambs over the manholes of their doorways so that
[28:02.540 --> 28:16.140]  the angel of death passes them over and so that's all any of this is is giant rituals
[28:16.140 --> 28:25.260]  out in the open of losers that serve an entity that is jealous of mankind humankind and wants
[28:25.260 --> 28:30.860]  to destroy us now I'm done talking about this for now because I got some guests a lot of
[28:30.860 --> 28:37.860]  key information coming up and instead of sitting here and just looking at the outward facsimile

[33:44.940 --> 33:50.900]  off our resources attacking our children injecting us with poison shots censoring us surveilling
[33:50.900 --> 33:57.100]  us all over tv all over movies it's not just messages that men are bad and families are
[33:57.100 --> 34:02.500]  bad and children are bad and the poison shots are good everywhere we see nicole kidman the
[34:02.500 --> 34:13.380]  list goes on and on pushing eating bugs when they have poisonous titan shells that give
[34:13.380 --> 34:17.660]  you cancer and you're not designed to eat bugs and they know that and bill gates is
[34:17.660 --> 34:27.940]  bringing the four artificial meat and bug factories all over the world and saying he's going
[34:27.940 --> 34:32.780]  to make you eat these and suddenly it's being put in school lunch products all over the
[34:32.780 --> 34:45.420]  western world again their religion is about dominating you and training you to do disgusting
[34:45.420 --> 34:54.260]  things to yourself because they need you to go against logic and self harm you're already
[34:54.260 --> 35:06.460]  a listener you're blessed because we're showing a woman eat large spider after large spider
[35:06.460 --> 35:16.540]  and i can tell you on dares in junior high i have eaten crickets and stuff screwing around
[35:16.540 --> 35:24.500]  and they taste disgusting that's something a dumb 11 year old does on a bet for $20 i
[35:24.500 --> 35:31.780]  can tell you that spider tastes like hell on earth because yes i didn't just eat crickets
[35:31.780 --> 35:39.140]  a couple times on bets one time there was a half a live tarantula on the ground and
[35:39.140 --> 35:44.060]  i've eaten bugs i think three times and once it was a tarantula and it brings back horrible
[35:44.060 --> 35:49.260]  memories when i bit into it it put off a smell of dead rotten meat that made me throw up
[35:49.260 --> 35:57.580]  for like five minutes i mean just the thought of that bug and i'm admitting stupid stories
[35:57.580 --> 36:04.020]  about myself here but that's what 11 year old boys do this is a woman she sits so disgusting
[36:04.020 --> 36:08.940]  she can barely control herself in her gag reflex but she's telling you how good and
[36:08.940 --> 36:15.940]  delicious it is just like robert downey junior and everybody else up there saying you will
[36:15.940 --> 36:22.220]  eat the bugs it's all about complete degradation here let's take it full screen and crank up
[36:22.220 --> 36:26.140]  the audio so you can hear the smacking and the gag reflex where she's trying to throw
[36:26.140 --> 36:44.260]  up but forcing it back here it is okay that's enough and i only played that to demonstrate
[36:44.260 --> 36:51.540]  the gag reflex your cells your body your genetics knows you're not supposed to eat that it's
[36:51.540 --> 36:56.300]  like g gordon liddy was in prison and he beat up some of the tough guys that thought they
[36:56.300 --> 37:00.420]  could tick his ass and they interviewed people that were in prison with him he didn't lie
[37:00.420 --> 37:05.700]  in his book about it was all true he didn't just eat one rat he ate rats on a routine
[37:05.700 --> 37:12.300]  basis in front of people live head first now it's one thing to do that to dominate people
[37:12.300 --> 37:19.620]  in a maximum security prison as a former military man and fbi agent and cia operative which
[37:19.620 --> 37:23.060]  i still wouldn't do that to show people that i had a will i don't think i could eat a live
[37:23.060 --> 37:28.380]  rat head first savoring each bite but the fact is they've gotten a cold kid and everybody
[37:28.380 --> 37:34.940]  else on tv doing this telling you it's great to just see they can get you to go against
[37:34.940 --> 37:39.860]  your ingrained common sense that god gave you and it goes on from there let's let's
[37:39.860 --> 37:50.460]  play the next clip this is bill gates backs of startup tracking cow burps and farts and
[37:50.460 --> 37:55.780]  he says they're going to feed them a special diet so they don't create methane methane
[37:55.780 --> 38:01.780]  is a warming gas in the atmosphere it is directly associated with keeping our atmosphere and
[38:01.780 --> 38:08.020]  is a good gas in our atmosphere and we've always had bovine all over the continents
[38:08.020 --> 38:15.020]  including the arctic and buffalo here in north america another species of buffalo all over
[38:15.020 --> 38:23.060]  africa and asia by the millions and they put off the exact same methane but they list methane
[38:23.060 --> 38:28.780]  as bad they make it toxic you know who else puts off methane you know it comes out of
[38:28.780 --> 38:36.460]  your rear end right a lot of it's methane so they're saying something that is part of
[38:36.460 --> 38:41.820]  you part of life is bad and by listing life is bad they can now surveil it and control
[38:41.820 --> 38:46.620]  it and go after it but don't worry he's got startup companies getting government money
[38:46.620 --> 38:52.500]  from australia to the u.s. from germany to canada with billions of dollars of taxpayer
[38:52.500 --> 38:56.980]  money he got through green deals to roll out these industries and that's why you see in
[38:56.980 --> 39:04.980]  canada they're making them kill a large part of their herd same thing in the netherlands
[39:04.980 --> 39:12.820]  they are cutting off the resources and saying you will eat the bugs again that's real satanism
[39:12.820 --> 39:17.500]  destroying healthy foods destroying prosperity destroying small farmers and it's not coming
[39:17.500 --> 39:24.020]  it's here here's bill gates australia is rare in that the opportunities exceed the things
[39:24.020 --> 39:29.140]  you have to give up you have to give up a large part of the and eventually almost all
[39:29.140 --> 39:37.140]  of the coal mining activity you know what happens with beef my climate group breakthrough
[39:37.140 --> 39:44.140]  energy just announced literally today an investment in australian group called ruminate that helps
[39:44.140 --> 39:51.980]  cows not be so much a source of methane emissions so we have two paths to solving that that's
[39:51.980 --> 40:01.220]  six percent of global emissions are cows who burp and fart methane to an extreme degree
[40:01.220 --> 40:06.980]  you can either fix the cows to stop them doing that or you can make beef without the cow
[40:06.980 --> 40:13.460]  and both of those you know will be pursued to see which one can lead to the best product
[40:13.460 --> 40:25.020]  in terms of taste health and cost here he is self appointed lying in every word oh then
[40:25.020 --> 40:29.260]  we can just make the beef no it's not beef it's artificial garbage you're going to grow
[40:29.260 --> 40:36.380]  that no one wants that you can control what's in it he wants to put spike protein in beef
[40:36.380 --> 40:41.100]  you've got to stand up against these people you've got to realize they're coming for everybody
[40:41.100 --> 40:49.260]  look at these headlines just today great reset supermarket chain little to cut down on meat
[40:49.260 --> 40:56.900]  products to serve green agenda farmland becomes flashpoint in u.s. china relations they're
[40:56.900 --> 41:01.700]  blocking china buying farmland across the u.s. meanwhile bill gates of the global should
[41:01.700 --> 41:06.020]  buy it all up and kicking regular farmers and ranchers off this is strategic it's a
[41:06.020 --> 41:13.260]  takeover and it's not just china cows of the new coal got to get rid of them meet the cow
[41:13.260 --> 41:18.500]  fart backpack that wants to fight climate change or you can keep your cow just shove
[41:18.500 --> 41:23.420]  a tube up its rear end and then gather the methane pressurize it and then have it injected
[41:23.420 --> 41:30.020]  into a mine shaft none of this is sustainable none of this is going to operate it's about
[41:30.020 --> 41:35.580]  total control oh just a month ago the UN announced their 15 minute smart cities initiative now
[41:35.580 --> 41:41.780]  canada has nearly 200 cities and towns joined liberals smart city scheme and promised to
[41:41.780 --> 41:49.540]  block the cars control everybody you name it and it goes on and on and on with double
[41:49.540 --> 41:59.980]  speak hillary clinton we need to protect abortion for our grandkids you mean we need to kill
[41:59.980 --> 42:06.620]  our grandkids they know exactly what they're doing it's an elite revolution against the

[48:29.620 --> 48:34.020]  of the majority of the populace and to do that they've got to train us to be envious
[48:34.020 --> 48:40.100]  stupid uneducated uninformed and basically lay down and die and so they're just flooding
[48:40.100 --> 48:46.940]  the zone with Satanism and pedophilia and corruption and decadence and lies and they're
[48:46.940 --> 48:53.420]  getting ready to get rid of the old financial system and bring in their new hellish system
[48:53.420 --> 48:57.340]  that tracks everywhere you go what you do and controls what you can buy what you can
[48:57.340 --> 49:03.660]  sell and under the ESG's and the central bank digital currencies you'll only be able
[49:03.660 --> 49:10.220]  to buy synthetic meat you'll only be able to buy cricket flour that isn't flour that's
[49:10.220 --> 49:19.180]  toxic titan protein this is just insane how they're creating this poison environment with
[49:19.180 --> 49:25.540]  5g and everything else around us and we have to reject this sick evil culture but that's
[49:25.540 --> 49:28.940]  why out of the gates it says two men can have a baby and we're gonna let convicted pedophiles
[49:28.940 --> 49:32.460]  have access to your children dressed up in clown outfits because if they can get away
[49:32.460 --> 49:38.540]  with letting men compete in women's sports and everything else what's next more insanity
[49:38.540 --> 49:43.060]  more murder of logic more things that no one would ever accept but they need to get you
[49:43.060 --> 49:49.180]  to accept it because it's their agenda so about a month ago we played a clip from the
[49:49.180 --> 49:53.300]  FDIC saying they're getting ready for bail ins and it will happen that's where they just
[49:53.300 --> 49:57.140]  grabbed part of your bank account then Gregory said a report on it that went super viral he's
[49:57.140 --> 50:02.540]  done a new report on it and then I saw news articles today talking about it bank of america's
[50:02.540 --> 50:09.460]  CEO we're preparing for possible u.s. debt default and when they go deeper into the article
[50:09.460 --> 50:15.540]  from CNN.com they talk about having to basically grab money out of your bank accounts there's
[50:15.540 --> 50:21.060]  a bunch of articles dealing with this but this is the next level of the control here's
[50:21.060 --> 50:26.060]  a story that ties into it from Fox News migrants flee New York City for Canada after drugs
[50:26.060 --> 50:32.740]  homelessness people make life unbearable so the u.s. is really more and more becoming
[50:32.740 --> 50:40.300]  unlivable in many many areas so here is Greg Reese's report dealing with this it's on
[50:40.300 --> 50:48.860]  band.video it's on info wars.com european central bank preparing for bail ins and banking collapse
[50:48.860 --> 50:54.180]  I'm gonna have this video reposted under the live show feed of the broadcast today it's
[50:54.180 --> 51:07.500]  very very important here it is after publishing my video report on bank bail ins a contractor
[51:07.500 --> 51:13.380]  for the european central bank who asked that his name be withheld for security reasons
[51:13.380 --> 51:19.940]  contacted me with the following information shortly after the fdic meeting that went viral
[51:19.940 --> 51:27.180]  my source was assigned an urgent project related to bail in capability for the european central
[51:27.180 --> 51:35.020]  bank or ECB bail ins is when the bank steals money directly from people's accounts just
[51:35.020 --> 51:42.700]  like we saw in Cyprus in 2013 the project goal is to build a data infrastructure for the
[51:42.700 --> 51:48.060]  financial market infrastructures which are the networks that allow financial transactions
[51:48.060 --> 51:55.780]  to take place to report to the ECB about the capability of banks and capital markets to
[51:55.780 --> 52:04.060]  absorb losses and to execute bail ins as quickly and efficiently as possible this urgent project
[52:04.060 --> 52:10.380]  makes it clear that the ECB is expecting a system collapse and that they know it is
[52:10.380 --> 52:16.780]  uncontrollable and unforeseeable the current security requirements do not legally compel
[52:16.780 --> 52:23.460]  the banks to provide information to the ECB if a bank is insolvent they have no incentive
[52:23.460 --> 52:31.820]  to tell the ECB and so the ECB is not targeting banks directly but rather financial intermediaries
[52:31.820 --> 52:38.300]  like swift and large settlement houses the purpose of this contractor's job is to provide
[52:38.300 --> 52:44.460]  a way for the ECB to pinpoint which banks are insolvent and where the collapse will
[52:44.460 --> 52:51.500]  stem from this is being done by creating large data lakes which an engineer can analyze and
[52:51.500 --> 52:57.820]  find meaning at a graphical level how much bail ins each bank has to execute and how
[52:57.820 --> 53:04.100]  much of a loss they can take this is evidence that the ECB is definitely planning on bail
[53:04.100 --> 53:11.020]  ins as a means of surviving an imminent collapse and when this occurs we can expect multiple
[53:11.020 --> 53:17.580]  banks to close and stock markets around the world to shut down as the banks steal as much
[53:17.580 --> 53:23.420]  money from the people as they deem necessary most of this work is being done in private
[53:23.420 --> 53:30.020]  but there are pieces of information available to the public on the EU's SRB website including
[53:30.020 --> 53:37.340]  operational guidance on bail in implementation and the operational guidance on bail in playbooks
[53:37.340 --> 53:43.260]  the ECB contractor has also pointed out that the latest directives for the European Union's
[53:43.260 --> 53:49.740]  digital service providers states that governments shall appoint trusted bodies for internet domain
[53:49.740 --> 53:54.900]  registry meaning that the government will have the sole authority on who is able to
[53:54.900 --> 54:00.540]  have a website and that these new security directives allow a gaping hole for a major
[54:00.540 --> 54:07.180]  cyber attack which official commentators are ignoring reporting for info wars this is Greg
[54:07.180 --> 54:16.980]  Reese all right if you go back about two and a half years ago I told you that after they
[54:16.980 --> 54:21.940]  phase out the force injections for now they'll then bring in climate lockdowns an economic
[54:21.940 --> 54:26.260]  collapse and the rollout of the digital currency and they war game it they talk about it we've
[54:26.260 --> 54:30.460]  covered it on air that they'll say oh there's been a cyber attack or oh there's a global
[54:30.460 --> 54:36.940]  insolvency in the banks or a mix of those and your money is safe in the bank we've only
[54:36.940 --> 54:41.500]  got to take 20 30 percent of it a computer's going to decide so no human did it so it's
[54:41.500 --> 54:46.060]  okay you know that's programmed by them and your money will be bailed into this new global
[54:46.060 --> 54:51.580]  system it will show up the stock markets and you'll have this new digital currency that
[54:51.580 --> 54:56.420]  we control but you'll get some of your money back if you don't you'll get none of it so
[54:56.420 --> 54:59.700]  they're going to hold everybody hostage and it could be a month away it could be a year
[54:59.700 --> 55:05.220]  away there's enough political pressure they'll have to back off but this is life and death
[55:05.220 --> 55:09.940]  situations here people ask me all the time how do you handle the attacks how do you handle
[55:09.940 --> 55:13.020]  thousands of articles a week lying about you and hundreds of TV programs how do you handle
[55:13.020 --> 55:18.220]  it we're all in the same boat together but my personal problems are small compared to
[55:18.220 --> 55:23.860]  all of our collective problems okay they don't even it's like having a scratch on your finger
[55:23.860 --> 55:29.100]  compared to your leg being chopped off okay we need to put a tourniquet on this now ladies
[55:29.100 --> 55:34.780]  and gentlemen now Mike Lindell is a great patriot and it's been through hell and every
[55:34.780 --> 55:40.940]  time he goes on Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel tries to destroy him but he comes out on top
[55:40.940 --> 55:46.660]  and so he went on Jimmy Kimmel and Kimmel had him sit there one of those claw machines
[55:46.660 --> 55:50.820]  and I get why Lindell did he played along with it but Lindell is going to join us talk
[55:50.820 --> 55:55.620]  about the waterfront the oceanfront what's happening in politics the world election fraud

[56:07.300 --> 56:14.140]  got such good sense of humor both times he's going on almost everybody agrees that he basically
[56:14.140 --> 56:18.860]  wins the discussion so I hope he'll rise the occasion like he does on those shows here
[56:18.860 --> 56:22.700]  he's pretty good on my show but he's kind of mailing it in but he does really really
[56:22.700 --> 56:27.260]  good when he's on one of these other channels under the pressure so we look forward to talking

[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:39.100]  are not going to want to miss here is the mark dice report I tried watching the Grammys
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:43.860]  on Sunday night but every song sounded like it was written by chat gpt and performed by
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:49.940]  someone at karaoke night at the bar it was pure noise pollution pop culture poison fitting
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:55.500]  for the United States of Sodom and Gomorrah it started off paying homage to the 30 million
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:01:00.700]  illegal aliens who have invaded the United States from Mexico and Central America with
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:16.020]  some artists performing a song in their native language his name is bad bunny or bonito something
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:23.500]  or other I couldn't care less but of course he's bisexual he dresses up in drag he kisses
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:29.020]  his backup dancers of any gender you know dismantling machismo as a queer latina woman
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:35.620]  this is so important to me because he is starting conversations and normalizing inclusivity
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:41.620]  Madonna was rolled out of the retirement home to introduce the first transgender and gender
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:49.580]  non-binary duo who performed a satanic ritual that's Sam Smith by the way who no longer
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:57.980]  identifies as a man or a woman he's a non-binary person I know don't even get me started that
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:10.380]  ritual was brought to you by fights her by the way and that's not a joke aside from celebrating
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:18.140]  Satan the Grammys also celebrated gluttony praising singer Lizzo for her body positivity
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:25.380]  messages but at least we now know that the supposed Chinese spy blimp was just her on
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:31.620]  her way to the Grammys so no need for concern and I have no idea what language this person
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:44.860]  is speaking or what planet he is from what is this gibberish I think that was Busta Rhymes
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:49.940]  but I'm not sure I'm too old for this crap there was a new category at the Grammys this
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:56.380]  year however a Grammy for black people I'm honored to be here to present a brand new
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:01.220]  award that the Recording Academy is introducing this year in coordination with the black music
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:08.180]  collective yeah yes good now this award will recognize the contributors and creators and
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:13.420]  professionals with a proven track record of uplifting black music Dr. Dre said that he
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:21.460]  was surprised then read a five-minute prepared speech from the teleprompter now I'm not saying
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:27.500]  that black people uplifting other black people isn't a good thing it's definitely needed have
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:33.180]  you seen the black crime statistics in America I'm just not sure that it's worthy of a Grammy
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:39.260]  and did you know that LGBTQ people created music I'd like to thank the queer community
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:47.380]  for your love for inventing this genre God bless you thank you so much to the Grammys
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:53.140]  that was Beyonce after she won the Grammy for best dance and electronic album of course
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:58.980]  one of Hollywood's top priorities is trying to normalize same-sex couples raising children
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:06.500]  so at the Grammys they had one performers so-called wife and children introduced her
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:11.660]  to the audience it means the world to me to stand here tonight with our beautiful daughters
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:17.900]  by my side here to rock our faces off with broken horses from her Grammy nominated album
[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:28.460]  in these silent days my wife and their mama joe biden's caretaker Jill even made a special
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:34.420]  appearance awarding the Grammy for song of the year of course she's not a musician at
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:39.380]  all but Hollywood does everything that they can to try to prop up the embarrassing and
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:45.260]  failing biden administration the only thing missing was president Zelensky from Ukraine
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:05:00.420]  but the Oscars are coming up soon so I'm sure they'll give him one for something the good
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:05.420]  news is the real red pill plus after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients

[01:06:52.940 --> 01:07:00.660]  stronger and that definition really for me is Mike Lindell of mypilla.com and mystore.com
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:05.340]  a great supporter of free speech not distributed around the world battling exposing the election
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:11.620]  fraud totally vindicated never giving up exposing the poison shots just fighting hard and the
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:17.020]  last time he went on Kimmel a year and a half ago or so he just destroyed Kimmel even though
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:21.060]  Kimmel tried to destroy him everybody said Lindell did a great job well this time they
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:26.220]  wanted him to sit there in a carnival or video game arcade claw machine and I will ask him
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:29.860]  why I played along with it I can't play the whole 10 minute segment but he did a great
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:34.900]  job here's part of it colorful on hinge characters who've come to prominence in the political
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:39.740]  era of Donald Trump our next guest is probably the most enthusiastic to help him overcome
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:44.780]  his debilitating fear of machines we have installed him inside a claw machine for his
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:48.820]  interview tonight and joining us now from the corner of Donkey Kong and Cuba at the
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:58.780]  Mike Pillow guy Mike Lindell Jimmy crumble is that you it's me well Mike first question
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:03.100]  Mike is why do you think people don't take you seriously well you know I want to tell
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:08.060]  you this Jimmy remember we were kids and we questioned these carnival games whether they
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:13.180]  were rigged or not yeah right but when we spoke up back then we didn't get sued did
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:17.660]  we you know that's right hey Mike get rid of that kid will you give him a toy or something
[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:24.100]  like that you know you got a winner it's a big game it's a big game Mike I know that
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:28.860]  you're distrustful of machines now that you're inside one do you feel differently no same
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:33.340]  thing there so their computers can be rigged out there absolutely elections you know that
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:38.140]  he did you ask Donald Trump whether you should do this or not do you run this sort of thing
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:43.300]  by him no I didn't Jimmy I did this all my own I wanted to be on your show you you know
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:47.780]  you kept telling me to come on but you you know I see the monologue there you said it's
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:52.580]  because to put me in here because I was but wasn't that's it you tricked me you did it
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:57.260]  to be funny huh yeah no I didn't know I didn't lie in there because you weren't that's it
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:00.740]  and I don't know to be honest I don't even remember why I decided you should be in there
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:04.300]  you know you said about your show it seemed like a good idea when it happened I have to
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:09.860]  say I was very surprised pause for a minute Mike is so good on his feet here and we'll
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:16.120]  talk to the man himself in a moment but he acts like Mike's in there of his own accord
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:20.100]  and Mike's like no you asked me to do this but Mike knew he was going to come back and
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:26.180]  expose that it's all a carnival fraud and again that's the disingenuousness of these
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:31.460]  people and the things they do so Mike knows unless they think they've got an advantage
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:34.980]  they're not going to have you on like what I was on with Pierce Morgan and he talked 90
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:39.340]  percent of the time that's what they do but but Mike's charm shines through let's continue
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:43.780]  there and so you said yes so I you know I'm honoring that commitment that I made on the
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:52.860]  air last week Mike you actually during the weekend you you ran for chairman of the Republican
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:58.020]  National Committee this is the committee that has kind of in charge of fundraising it decides
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:03.820]  where the money goes it's a very powerful group right and you seemed by my count very
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:08.140]  confident that you had a chance to win this thing let's look at the tape I'm running
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:15.500]  for chairman of the RNC and I plan on winning and you know what I plan on winning I want
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:20.380]  to win that RNC chair we're heading every single poll out there I'm a hundred percent
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:24.900]  all in and when I go all in I go all into win I just want to win everybody how am I
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:29.660]  gonna win but we're gonna it's gonna change real fast are you confident that you can
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:34.820]  win yeah absolutely a lot of work on do you think you can win do you think you win of
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:40.500]  course I'm gonna win Mike some of the polls show you winning this oh yeah they all do
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:47.100]  now Mike the poll actually did show you as the favorite right the Rasmussen poll that's
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:53.820]  correct yeah and then this happened Mike Lindell received four votes Hermit Dillon received
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:11:02.100]  51 votes and Ronan McDaniel received 111 votes now does this seem like an indication that
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:10.780]  maybe your barometer when it comes to voting is off again he's the man in the arena he
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:14.540]  runs a big network reaching millions people a day he's fighting back and then they act
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:22.740]  like when you're an underdog it's pathetic that you try to win no winners never quit
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:29.380]  and quitters never win to quote Vince Lombardi and so I've lost way more than I've won but
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:33.980]  in the aggregate we've changed the world and then George Washington in the six year war
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:38.140]  with the British Empire that had never been defeated went on to defeat Napoleon a few
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:43.340]  years later with the biggest army in the world ever seen he lost 95% of his battles but he
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:50.700]  persevered he's George Washington Mike Lindell you're with us till 45 after really appreciate
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:55.300]  you coming on but I just wanted to play this because it just shows the deception in the
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:12:00.500]  games and just even how they tried to rig the interview to make you look like a fool but
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:04.860]  you came out small like a rose of the full interview is up on info wars calm it's up
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:08.020]  on Frank speech but I just wanted to I saw this and loved it last week and wanted to
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:13.780]  have you on because you know you got a lot of balls brother well thanks but they are
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:18.140]  you know that even my lawyers warn me don't go on Mike don't go on you're gonna make
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:22.620]  a fool yourself I go you know what we have to keep getting the word out about to get
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:27.820]  rid of these computers and in our elections and machine and what you're missing there
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:33.700]  which I called Jimmy out on it about when he first brought this up he said it was about
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:38.420]  a half a year ago and we played it over and over after I got done on Jimmy Kimmel the
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:44.020]  next day as he said Mike wants to come on the show but in order to be you have to be
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:48.900]  vaccinated to get in our building so we'll have to do it in the claw machine across the
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:55.580]  street so I feel safe those were his words Alex and then so when I said I'd come on
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:59.860]  Jimmy spun that around like like you know well I never said that I can't remember why
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:03.980]  I wanted you in a claw machine when I went out there we had to get they still wear mask
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.940]  in that building they are we had to get this we had to be tested for the China virus like
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:14.380]  a the night before 12 hours earlier so I really didn't even believe I would be in the building
[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:20.020]  now and so that's the first part the second part is when he bashed the when he talked
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:27.500]  about the the RNC race what he what what he what got put out there was you know what if
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:33.740]  you if you play that a little further what happened was Jimmy I was the favorite of the
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:39.420]  to win it by far over double harm eat and run a McTinney what what people don't understand
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:46.820]  is only 168 people vote on that three from every state Alex the people when they did
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:51.460]  the Rasmussen poll the people of this country they wanted a businessman they want to know
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:57.100]  no no no you won the national scientific poll but the RNC it's basically a rigged by how
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:01.940]  they're able to select who does it well they went they went against the will of the people
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:07.260]  now Ron McDaniel and her defense she said I would look forward to working with Mike
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:12.700]  Lindell now she called me on Friday so we're gonna see how that plays out because one of
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:19.980]  the things that the RNC just completely ignored the last five years is they ignored the the
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:28.660]  election platforms you can't ignore the platforms and just like they did with it for seven months
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:32.940]  their emails their g-mails were all going into spam and they finally got the you know
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:36.740]  said hey we better go after Google and they did and they got their emails back I said
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:41.340]  to them that's a computer that's a computer Google was using to destroyer sure the idea
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:45.540]  that we can just trust this system has been caught lying about everything is preposterous
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:48.940]  and we'll come back and play the next clip you talked about because I mean all the people
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:52.380]  I saw it when everybody said you destroyed him because again he wanted to act like you
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:56.180]  demanded to be in a claw machine though that was his idea just every level is deception
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:15:01.500]  right we're gonna break it about 45 seconds but what else are you gonna cover to what
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:06.180]  else is on your radar yeah well we've got we've got a I'm gonna tell you all this as

[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:49.500]  we've got to get rid of these and if this a fraction more of successful businessmen
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:54.140]  and women did what you've done we would not be in this much trouble but I'm optimistic
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:58.220]  I'm seeing a huge awakening I get nothing but love when I'm on the street I got a lot
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:02.900]  of hate you know years ago mostly love but still a lot of hate all I'm getting is love
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:07.460]  all we're seeing is a huge awakening what are you seeing now that's exactly right you
[01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:12.420]  know when I went on Jimmy Kimmel I did it for a very a very good reason and that is
[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:18.340]  to the people to get the word out remember we don't have Fox News everybody and Newsmax
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:23.420]  and Salem media they won't talk about our election platforms they will not talk about
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:28.340]  elections they get you know they're for one reason or another they won't so we have to
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:33.060]  get the word out and if it takes me sitting in a claw machine on Jimmy Kimmel that went
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:38.220]  out to tens of millions and I was able to talk about these problems we have and getting
[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:42.780]  our elections right and there's a lot of hope do you know that Alex that I was in being
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:47.820]  in California there people could reclining fences and stuff when I was on Jimmy Kimmel
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:54.020]  to talk and go we help save our country save our country and want an autographs and pictures
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:58.420]  and and a lot of them I talked to later and they you know they voted Democrat they're
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:03.500]  not doing that again because they realized the manifestation of a stolen election must
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:10.460]  flesh what's going on now and so I see so much hope and there's also so much more that
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:14.900]  I know that if people knew what I know you know we have great things that happen you
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:21.600]  have you just had Alabama go get rid of Eric the dirty rotor voles that system you had
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:27.580]  Claiborne County Arkansas go completely a paper hand counted you've got all these states we
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:34.180]  have over and we have over 50 lawsuits going on to change back to our the things that were
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:40.340]  put in illegally by Secretary of State to change them back to where the how they were
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:46.780]  before you know you can't break our Constitution and keep that as the status quo so we're fighting
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:50.820]  every day and we've got a big announcement at the end of the week this platform that
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:56.660]  I'm putting together this and it's going to be amazing when this is announced hopefully
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:01.860]  hopefully by Friday but this is going to be the platform that really brings it all together
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:07.060]  like a hub of a wheel so we have a communication process we have everything because it's not
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:11.780]  just a few of us out there it's millions of us out there that are working hard to get
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:16.540]  this country back basically back well that's why the enemies of freedom work around the
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:20.980]  clock to try to you and I and others off the air because we have the majority of people
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:24.660]  awake every race color agreed they just feel alone because they don't have places to come
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:30.460]  together yes absolutely I see people if they're out there I'll tell you this if they're you
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:35.620]  know they attack media actually helps us Alex because it helps us get the word out right
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:39.700]  but it's the ones when I see people out there that are feeling hopeless they go have you
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:43.220]  been watching Fox News they go yeah that's all they watch is Fox well they're not going
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:48.100]  to tell you about the the hope that's going on the things out there like you know lawsuits
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:53.980]  were winning and change these election platforms back getting rid of these electronic machines
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:58.220]  you know they're not going to report these things and people need to hear that right
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:02.660]  now they're here you know you hear about the border with the drop that no pouring across
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:09.500]  and and and three over 300 people dying every day from addiction well you know what I've
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:14.380]  been putting out there right on my platform the lindellrecoverynetwork.org it's free everybody
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:18.940]  you can send anyone you want there it's free I did I put it out there I used to be an addict
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:24.540]  so I know this and it works it it'll help them and give you hope so I want to spread
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:28.940]  the message of hope and so people and then they got to be courageous we know that Alex
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:35.460]  courage is contagious everybody so now's the time to be courageous you need I people ask
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:40.100]  me all the time well how can I help when you you know when you get information put it on
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:46.300]  all the media platforms all the new platforms choose social Frank social get her gab telegram
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:52.260]  even the new Twitter even suck a buck Facebook the more we can keep spreading are the news
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:56.660]  and that that's what we need because then encourages people and they'll they're coming
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:28:02.820]  on over to this common sense bucket I believe 70% of this country you talk about elections
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:08.180]  you talk about Republican Democrat is red and uh and I have very very good reasons to
[01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:12.420]  believe that well the globalists admitted their own documents they're losing worldwide
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:16.540]  not just here and that's why they're they're working so hard so we're we're at that critical
[01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:20.940]  part of the football game where we've just got possession and we're a few points ahead
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:25.980]  but now we've got to just get eye of the tiger and focus and not shut up and just like you
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:30.020]  said I'll go on mainstream news even though it's rigging though they attack people hate
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:35.580]  them so much we always get nothing but positive feedback right that's right that's exactly
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:40.580]  right and you know if it wouldn't be for the media attack and it would be silent out there
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:45.740]  and they uh I mean when I went on Jimmy Campbell they I'll tell you Jimmy came up afterwards
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:50.420]  he gives me a hug you know it's like uh and he asked me goes Mike we can we without these
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:55.380]  machines how are we going to do this I want to hear about this and the balloon and Trump

[01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:35.420]  the new order we've ever had we are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:40.500]  why today it's more important than ever realize how important you've been in this fight and
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:45.660]  to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify that I bless you all
[01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:51.060]  I salute you I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we
[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:55.940]  are over the target and this is happening the fight is my fight it's your fight it's
[01:32:55.940 --> 01:33:05.700]  our fight God bless you all leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:21.540]  it's alex jones defending the republic from enemies born and domestic it's alex jones
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:36.540]  our love is unconditional we knew it from the start I see it in your eyes you can feel
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:44.540]  it from my heart from here on after let's stay the way we are right now and share all
[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:59.100]  the laughter for the audience I agree with George straight I crossed my heart I promise
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:13.100]  you we're not like these evil satanists we love God we love justice you got my commitment
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:17.460]  to be the best man I can be promote freedom for my children your children in the future
[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:22.580]  I think about George straight's beautiful loving Texas voice compared to all that satanism
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:27.580]  we saw at the Grammys and just the open evil of Hollywood and everything they're doing
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:33.140]  Michael and I want to ask you just about your relationship with God and the fact this is
[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:37.020]  a spiritual battle and now God healed you and has healed so many and has healed me as
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:41.260]  well and it's an it's a continuing ongoing process but what do you make of the poison
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:46.460]  shots the total vindication now Bloomberg and Pfizer admitting it causes heart attacks
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:54.620]  and strokes today the satanism everywhere the war I mean all of this what is your view
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:35:00.380]  on the battle between good versus evil well that gets brought up a lot to me and I say
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:07.020]  you know God's had his hand in all of this and if all of the you know people don't look
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:12.260]  to Jesus and as things are going bad usually if things are going good they get complacent
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:17.100]  whatever and we're in the greatest revival for Jesus Christ in history I mean people
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:22.700]  are pouring it and you know if we get to this great place out here you're gonna look back
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:27.980]  and you're gonna say all these things had to happen just the way they happen even the
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:33.500]  good even the bad remember God uses God uses everything for good so if you know things
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:37.500]  are going bad at that time you're going okay maybe there's a reason when you get way out
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:43.420]  here you have to it's opening people's eyes I really think it's been amazing I think back
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:49.500]  I say you know if Donald Trump would have been put back in on December 14th of 2020
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:53.420]  you know what we would have lost our country and more importantly we went ahead all these
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:36:01.180]  people pouring into to Jesus and what I mean by that is that you wouldn't have found all
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:05.740]  of these things that are that are coming out all the evil that's exposing itself remember
[01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:11.980]  Alex we're in a spiritual battle of biblical proportions and evil is greedy this is our
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:16.780]  big advantage everybody evil is greedy they could back off a little bit and say you know
[01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:22.460]  what they're on to us they're on to us but no they don't they double down triple down quadruple
[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:29.980]  down and it just is it defines it defines all logic but I'm telling you I talked to
[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:35.260]  it let me tell you something I went to California about two months ago I was up in California I
[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:40.860]  know it was in September I'm up there with all these kids at 25 to 30 ohs that have voted Democrat
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:45.180]  they were flipping they were asking is there any hope for our country we talked about the
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:50.140]  Lord we talked about God we talked about Jesus and I would spend I spent a week in that town
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:55.340]  then the next week I go down to Florida for the hurricane victims giving them pillows and blankets
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:37:01.900]  and everything we went in this this one trailer park and it looked like a river of with two banks
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:07.180]  of just all physical possessions and everything from their trailers that had just been lost
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:11.340]  everything they had physically and they're all out there a lot of Hispanics and I'm talking to
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:18.220]  me even with an interpreter the common theme was you know what they had hoped that if we could
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:23.500]  save our country our freedoms they can get their physical possessions back they were more worried
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:30.220]  more about the spiritual battle we're in and worried more about the future than those physical
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:35.820]  things they could get those back if we get if we you know save our freedoms so you know it's
[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:41.180]  for me people say well Mike you have so much courage and whatever no I only fear the Lord so
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:47.900]  it's pretty pretty easy I give it to him I just pray I pray for discernment I pray Proverbs 3 5
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:54.860]  6 trust in the Lord with all your heart lean not lean not on your own understanding and always
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:38:00.060]  acknowledge him and he will guide your paths you know Alex I was going down some bad paths back when
[01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:04.700]  I was a crack at it I pray and people I want to say one more thing that you brought up that
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:10.780]  people you know everyone out there Mike I prayed and this didn't happen I prayed those are reactionary
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:17.340]  prayers everybody and and you know what if you want to be proactive in prayer you gotta surrender
[01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:22.780]  and tell God to take over right right but I will say this remember the reaction of prayers that
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:29.100]  might not be God's will and where is God's will God's will is in the word so if you stay in the
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:35.260]  word your proactive prayers they line up a lot better and and you're exactly right you surrender
[01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:40.540]  to Jesus it's over it's easy but they want us to surrender to Satan you said something so important
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:44.380]  a few minutes ago they're they're revealing themselves even though it's destroying them
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:50.380]  they keep why are they doing that yeah you know that's what I say because evil is greedy they uh
[01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:53.820]  you know they should have been they you would think that they would have back off hey they're
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:59.260]  on to us let's just talk the election crime just that alone you know um you know what they're on
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:04.060]  to us we we've got the machines and computers forever let's at least back off no they doubled
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:09.260]  down shripled down look at the look at the race in Arizona everybody if you got all these corrupt
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:13.740]  machines and where you're hacking in and everything else you would at least make them work on the
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:20.220]  front end uh that they're functioning right and then it's pretty obvious we have 60s every level
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:25.820]  greedily yeah they they don't care it's like you know whatever level they can steal at that's what
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:31.340]  they're doing and evil is greedy and that's to our advantage everybody and they're very deceptive
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:36.700]  Alex they're very deceptive it's like a huge marketing game when you look at it too remember
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:42.220]  when we had Afghanistan everybody and the whole world was on the the big the worst decision ever
[01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:47.900]  made in human history and one of the worst and every and ten days later nobody's talking about
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:51.500]  it you know why because they're all sitting they're going what are we gonna do everyone's
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:56.060]  focusing on they're on to us all this you know these things well ten days later they had Biden
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:00.940]  come out and go anyone with a hundred or more people in their company you have to get a shot
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:06.140]  so the attention of the world went we're not doing it but you forgot about Afghanistan
[01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:11.660]  and this is all so much of this stuff is done to deflect and that's why it's so important that
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:16.620]  we stay focused this is a this is a bigger battle this is I agree the time we have left is you've
[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:23.980]  got to leave us and come back and break major news I like Trump I like the Santas but the big money's
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:27.740]  lining up behind the Santas which I don't like so even though I have problems with Trump still pushing
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:33.660]  the shot when you got the Koch brothers against him I'm like wow I should probably back Trump then
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:40.300]  what's your view on that well I've said it before if Ron DeSantis wants to help our country at all
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:47.340]  he should endorse Donald Trump right now today I mean it's you know just endorse him united he
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:53.980]  wants to run do it in 2028 be the governor you are that's that's very simple this is you're not
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:41:00.140]  Donald Trump is the favorite of this country by overwhelming proportions he won he deserves that
[01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:05.900]  whole show he would destroy Biden right now let's say yeah he would destroy him he would destroy
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:11.500]  anybody running in the primary so why you know you got uh you know like I say I think uh you
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:17.020]  know they're they're pitting this uh putting uh DeSantis and talking about you know DeSantis I
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:22.140]  want to say one thing too that this is news on your show I actually looked into our cyber guys
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:27.500]  looked into Miami Dade County and that was all over the news because it was a deviation where a
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:33.580]  Republican won Miami Dade County I hadn't been running decades well guess what we just got that
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:41.580]  news back there was no computer manipulation in 2022 in Miami Dade County that's the first big
[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:46.300]  county we found where there was no computer manipulation in the last two elections now
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:51.980]  let me tell you what that means that means that this whole country's read that if you take all
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:56.860]  the all the places where they're where they're manipulating with computers if Miami Dade County
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:01.740]  had nothing it's not because DeSantis is the greatest guy ever that he overran that it's
[01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:05.580]  because they didn't even cheat at all there exactly and it close let me say this you're a
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:09.820]  prominent guy I'm prominent our listeners aren't which is a blessing they need to be private
[01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:15.100]  they don't see the love I used to get 70 love 30 hate when Trump first got elected
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:19.580]  that was the worst ever was now I get basically nothing but love in public
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:24.300]  everywhere liberals apologizing crying saying they were wrong I agree with you that we've already won
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:29.740]  the hearts and minds now we've just got to take the country back yep absolutely we've got to fix
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:34.460]  our election that's all you're getting on the street is basically love too a hundred percent
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:39.580]  a hundred percent I don't I haven't had one person come up to me and I've spent a lot of time in a
[01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:45.180]  very liberal progressive places and in the cities for weeks at a time I just came from California

[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:38.060]  i'm almost guilty that i didn't just cancel the guest to do this for the whole show
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:43.980]  because i'd already seen an earlier draft of this un treaty but now we've got the official
[01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:51.820]  final draft and it is spectacularly authoritarian totalitarian it's just i mean we knew this was
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:49:00.300]  coming but to see it all front and center like this is crazy
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:08.060]  and that's what everybody's saying on the internet i'm not even trying to look for my name
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:14.380]  i don't say oh my name's big oh i'm big no it makes me a target but i'm also a barometer
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:20.140]  and so it was trending again this morning alex jones about the satanic ceremony they had now
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:26.780]  alex jones is right at the grammy's so the enemies tried to make me a symbol of lies a symbol of
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:34.780]  fraud a symbol of um toxic masculinity but thanks to all of you supporting us is standing up it's
[01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:40.380]  not working ladies and gentlemen that's what i was getting to with michael indell all he i was
[01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:45.580]  talking to him during the breaks he said yeah no i used to get you know 10 attacks it was pretty bad
[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:49.340]  because you walk through a crowd of 200 people and you shake it on her hands and then all the
[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:54.140]  sudden people attack you it's still very disconcerting when you're at the grocery store or the gas
[01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:59.100]  station or church or walking down the street or at the post office and somebody gets in your face
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:07.580]  it's and knock on wood because i hate it happening it's not been happening any i mean i go months
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:22.140]  now out in public before i get any hate months and i went to cancun for four days with my wife
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:27.100]  and my youngest child in a bodyguard and he would sit back under the trees where they had chairs
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:30.860]  when we were out in the sun throwing the football and everything else taking a break that i had to
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:36.540]  have and it's so easy and quick from texas two-hour flight down there 400 bucks on southwest you're
[01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:43.740]  right back he said it was incredible he sat there great guys one of my security guys for four or
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:52.140]  five years mike sat there and listened to people under the palm trees under the comana talk about
[01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:55.260]  me while i was out there throwing the football and playing for four or five hours a day with my
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:51:01.100]  daughter building sandcastles and over and over again they said i used to think he was a bad guy
[01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:06.620]  a liar he's right he's a good guy i used to be a liberal i used to be a democrat what do we do
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:14.220]  he heard all these people including the mexicans that were working at the resort saying alihandro
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:20.780]  jones is right and my wife speaks pretty good spanish she was talking to him even in mexico
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:25.660]  folks people are awake i mean they're already awake a lot of stuff but they know alice jones i mean
[01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:31.260]  i mean so i only report that to you again not to say oh i'm famous oh i'm a big fish oh i'm
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:38.860]  important no it's the opposite of that the level of love is so intense that is a major barometer
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:45.020]  on what their attacks have done and what their demonization has done because people know when
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:50.220]  they see the system attacking us and coming after us they know the system's bad they've turned
[01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:56.620]  against the system it's not about loving alex jones or michael indell or tucker carlson we're
[01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:59.980]  just people that love freedom like you we're just like you we don't want to hurt people or have
[01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:04.700]  world government or satanism or fentanyl deaths or crime and i mean we have children we thought
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:10.060]  we want prosperity and justice and security and freedom and and everything else that comes with it
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:18.300]  and to have been on air 28 years and experience this and now see
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:26.620]  almost universal acceptance is very exciting i saw a few left to shake in their head and they
[01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:30.860]  wouldn't say anything and they were just totally freaked out the airport and things like that and
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:35.740]  when i came back they flagged me in the system and my wife and family went through and had
[01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:39.900]  customs and they said we're supposed to search you and you should do a four-year request we don't
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:45.500]  think this is right you can go we're not going to search you mr. jones that was human intelligence
[01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:51.980]  overriding what they've been ordered to do to me they were shaking their heads they were pretty
[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:57.820]  upset whatever it is they were supposed to do to me probably a strip search but it didn't happen
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:03.660]  because the humans on the ground knew it was wrong and that's the fight club nature of this
[01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:08.060]  it's like tyler durgan is going around everywhere i'm like yes mr. durgan we're we're in on it with
[01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:13.260]  you yes we're gonna fight this with you that's kind of a leftist dream of their communist revolution
[01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:17.340]  but it's not happening for them they don't have the thinkers they don't have the good people they've
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:22.700]  got the mindless drones but in my life it's like fight club so i want listeners to know when you
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:28.460]  feel alone and you feel down and you feel like people are listening to you in the real world
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:35.260]  where the rubber meets the road the public is really awake right now and the enemy knows that
[01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:40.620]  and it's gone into full panic mode so this stack of news i talked about earlier i'm going to cover
[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:46.780]  it with roger stone first when he comes on and then get into politics after that but this is so big
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:53.980]  this un treaty and then bloomberg last night comes out and says okay fizer admits their shots causing
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:54:00.300]  strokes well it's really causing heart attacks monocarditis way above strokes but they're admitting
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:06.540]  the strokes how big a deal is that why would they do that because they know they can't contain it
[01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:11.100]  anymore and that's because of the scientists and the doctors and the nurses and the medical workers
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:15.900]  and the whistleblowers and the general public spreading the word that their whole house of
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:21.340]  cards to take control of our body is coming down in fact let's let's play tedris the head of the
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:27.740]  world health organization last night saying their main mission and their call for action
[01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:33.740]  is to shut down people questioning us but everything they said was a lie so again they're
[01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:39.340]  hitting the panic button and it doesn't mean we're winning this war but the enemy thinks they're
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:45.020]  losing so i i'm not god i don't have omni presence anything close to it i i'm not sure whether we're
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:51.900]  winning or losing but i know this we're fighting back and at least the enemy's scared here's the
[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:57.740]  head of the un we'll call for action from everyone with influence on the spread of
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:04.460]  myths and disinformation on the internet governments regulators policymakers technology
[01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:13.820]  companies the media civil society stop the hate set up strong guardrails be accountable for language
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:21.100]  that causes harm and as part of my report or common agenda we are convening all stakeholders
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:27.180]  around the code of conduct for information integrity on digital platforms and we'll also
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:33.260]  further strengthen our focus on our means and disinformation are impacting progress on global
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:40.060]  issues including the climate crisis so and by the way there's so many of these clips i confuse
[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:46.140]  that we have a w h o head saying that as well that's the secretary general saying it so that's
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:53.660]  what i'm saying they are hitting the panic button and saying the un has to regulate the un has to
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:56:01.420]  centralize that's antonio gutierrez secretary general the un so they are in full retreat right now
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:07.500]  and saying we're lying no we said it caused heart attacks and strokes we said it caused blood clots
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:13.820]  and now it's confirmed and their only hope is to shut us up that's not going to work no matter
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:19.100]  you can try to take out Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson or general Flynn but you're not taking
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:24.460]  everybody out and that's why the average woman or man black white old young doesn't matter
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:30.060]  wherever you are is so powerful when you share articles and share videos and circumvent the AI
[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:37.100]  you're defeating the enemy's greatest push we're going to go to break very powerful clip from stew

[01:59:50.860 --> 02:00:04.300]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:11.820]  we've talked a lot on this program about how the world that we live in today is really just
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:17.660]  the empire of lies the self-appointed ruling elites have lied for decades maybe even centuries
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:22.460]  about virtually everything in more recent times some of those lies that we were told were some
[02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:26.620]  of the biggest lies you could ever wrap your head around we've been lied to about the assassination
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:30.700]  of a sitting president jfk the circumstances surrounding the death of princess died the causes
[02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:35.820]  of wars in iraq and syria and afghanistan weapons of mass destruction supposed islamic terrorists
[02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:42.780]  responsible for 9 11 the obama red line in syria the Benghazi embassy the ruthless bogeyman vladimir
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:48.220]  putin just waking up one day deciding to go and conquer ukraine totally unprovoked he's a war
[02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:54.780]  criminal they tell us well meanwhile ukrainian azov battalion literal nazis shoot innocents
[02:00:54.780 --> 02:01:01.100]  trying to flee recruit non-military fighters and literally eat opposition soldiers we've been lied
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:05.900]  to about the actual events of these wars the ghost of kiv the bombing of maternity wars
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:10.220]  and now we're learning in the last couple of days about child organ harvesting that russian
[02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:16.700]  troops just discovered taking place in ukraine lies about cova 19 its origins the bio weapon
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:21.580]  injection being a safe and effective vaccine we've exposed the lies about the medical industrial
[02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:26.700]  complex deadly hospital protocols and treatments when the truth is these for-profit hospitals
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:31.740]  and clinics have been killing for cash murdering for money for decades using poisonous drugs and
[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:36.940]  damaging serums venoms and injections that caused the breakdown of immune systems kickstart
[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:42.140]  inflammation lead innocent americans to an early grave all for the almighty dollar in the quest
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:49.660]  for power control and status this is all true the criminal fake news media tells us lies about
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:55.260]  a sitting president donald trump colluding with russia a violent insurrection oh and a supposed
[02:01:55.260 --> 02:02:01.260]  pee tape and anyone that points out or broadcasts or publishes the truth about any of these things
[02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:07.420]  is a far-right shock jock or a white supremacist an extremist christian nationalist or a conspiracy
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:13.020]  theorist of course the idea of his billions of dollars to major broadcasts and cable news networks
[02:02:13.020 --> 02:02:18.460]  to brainwash and propagandize and program and repeat and gaslight the viewing audience consisting
[02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:26.140]  of hundreds of millions of clueless victims in many cases leading them directly to their death we
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:32.220]  aren't conspiracy theorists no not at all and telling big lies isn't new the jewish virtual
[02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:37.260]  library points this out quote if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will
[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:41.740]  eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can
[02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:48.220]  shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it
[02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:54.380]  does becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the
[02:02:54.380 --> 02:03:00.300]  truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the
[02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:07.340]  state this is why slaveholders refuse to allow their slaves the ability to learn to read or write
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:13.420]  the jewish virtual library continues quote the broad masses of a nation are always more easily
[02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:19.660]  corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily and thus
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:25.580]  in the primitive simplicity of their minds they're more readily fall victims to the big lie than the
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:32.460]  small lie since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:38.700]  resort to large-scale falsehoods it would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:43.180]  and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously
[02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:49.340]  even though the facts which proved this to be so maybe brought clearly to their minds
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:55.340]  they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation
[02:03:56.220 --> 02:04:04.060]  unquote let me ask you which one of those words that i just read from the jewish virtual library
[02:04:04.060 --> 02:04:11.500]  are not true all of this sounds objectively true who among us that's being completely objective
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:19.980]  and bare naked honest could disagree with any of those words for the last two years both fake
[02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:25.900]  political sides of the aisle have been fighting to own the definition of the term the big lie in

[02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:33.900]  platform balloon trump the sanis bank bail ins all the vaccine news coming out of this grammy satanic
[02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:39.500]  event they had last night all of it was the great roger stone but but roger what's front and center
[02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:48.140]  for you right now well i'm still uh in shock about uh the american response to these to this chinese
[02:06:48.140 --> 02:06:54.140]  surveillance balloon i mean it seems to me that we've learned nothing about the lessons of history
[02:06:54.140 --> 02:07:04.300]  that weakness uh is what promotes aggression and war uh and uh now suddenly the by demonstration says
[02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:12.460]  without any evidence or proof whatsoever that a chinese surveillance uh balloon entered american
[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:19.020]  airspace twice or maybe it's three times during the trump presidency even secretary of defense
[02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:26.220]  mark esper who was fired by trump who's most definitely not a trump fan or supporter denies
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:32.860]  that that he ever had any knowledge or was ever informed by anyone in the military that that
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:38.860]  was the case and of course the by administration offers no proof it's just uh it's just a talking
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:50.220]  point they're clearly trying to get rid of biden right now what i think that that's i i have said
[02:07:50.220 --> 02:07:57.500]  this on your show and on my own show the stone zone uh that um i really think uh that those who
[02:07:57.500 --> 02:08:03.500]  really are running the country the global elites who are running the country uh with whom uh former
[02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:10.780]  president barack obama has a disproportionate amount of influence have decided that joe biden
[02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:18.620]  is dispensable uh that between the coming investigations into the corruption uh by uh his
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:27.980]  son his brother and himself uh and uh record gas prices record food shortages a record inflation
[02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:36.140]  uh in a disastrously weak foreign policy um that he is just too heavy a burden to carry into the
[02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:44.780]  next election this is only a question of how he leaves uh now when you add to it his shall we
[02:08:44.780 --> 02:08:51.420]  say uneven performances uh in public um i don't think that they think that he can get through
[02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:59.500]  another presidential campaign who is his replacement well the question is who is his immediate
[02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:06.300]  replacement and and who is his ultimate replacement uh i think most people who've watched the show
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:12.860]  understand that if he resigned let's just say hypothetically he elected to resign tomorrow
[02:09:12.860 --> 02:09:20.860]  uh maybe after pardoning himself and his son and his brother um then kamala harris the vice
[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:26.780]  president would automatically be president of the united states by the way there is no swearing
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:34.540]  in that famous picture of lbj on air force one being sworn in all theatrics a completely legally
[02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:41.980]  unnecessary a way for lbj to twist the knife in bobby kennedy and also by having the widow
[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:49.660]  kennedy standing next to him get the imprimatur of the kennedy dynasty on his presidency but
[02:09:49.660 --> 02:09:56.380]  she would immediately become president upon joe biden's resignation the other possibility because
[02:09:56.380 --> 02:10:06.300]  joe is a very very stubborn guy as is his wife if he refused to resign but really could no longer
[02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:12.220]  fulfill the functions uh our responsibilities of the office well then he could be removed under
[02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:20.700]  the 25th amendment that requires a majority of the cabinet plus the sitting vice president
[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:27.100]  well her self-interest would be extraordinarily clear and i would argue that barack obama could
[02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:33.580]  line up a majority of the cabinet in an afternoon round of phone calls so i still think that that
[02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:39.500]  if if things get bad enough and they're heading in that direction um that may well happen what do
[02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:44.060]  you think is really going on kamala harris because she was dumb in the campaign but now
[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:49.260]  i don't just watch clips of her i watch her speeches and she looks like she's on three or
[02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:54.620]  four xanax and have a bottle of vodka i mean she doesn't know what planet she's on would the
[02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:59.500]  establishment actually allow her in that position or is she such a puppet they think they can control
[02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:05.420]  her i think that they they would have they really have no choice they've positioned her here
[02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:10.460]  and therefore she would rise to the presidency but that doesn't mean that she either would be a
[02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:17.900]  candidate for reelection within the dynamics of the democratic party the only way you could
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:25.260]  replace a woman of color is with another woman of color which is why i have said on the show
[02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:32.380]  multiple times that i thought michelle obama uh was not only would not only be a formidable
[02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:37.820]  candidate for president but ultimately will be their candidate so you think they're really
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:43.740]  going to bring forward big mic uh i think that she would be their strongest candidate
[02:11:44.620 --> 02:11:50.380]  she is uh she's not out doing all these book signings uh and these voter registration tours
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:57.180]  for her health she certainly doesn't need money uh and uh collectively i think the democratic party
[02:11:57.180 --> 02:12:04.700]  leaders know uh that she's an infinitely stronger candidate uh than uh vice president kamala harris
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:11.820]  then i think they probably go uh to uh Gavin Newsom for vice president but that's only because
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:18.380]  Pete Buttigieg has essentially failed his audition for that position for those that haven't been
[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:23.900]  paying attention i know most listeners have the Koch brothers are coming out for DeSantis against
[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:30.220]  Trump i like DeSantis so many fronts but his campaign fund raising is from elites he does
[02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:34.380]  have the Koch brothers backing him uh that makes me really have a concern about DeSantis
[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:41.100]  well the Koch brothers uh were opposed to Donald Trump in 2016 they weren't for him in 2020 so the
[02:12:41.100 --> 02:12:48.540]  idea fostered by some of the media that this is a desertion of Trump uh and uh first of all there's
[02:12:48.540 --> 02:12:54.860]  only one Koch brother the other Koch brother has passed away uh but um they've spent hundreds of
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:13:01.900]  millions of dollars uh on politics yet they haven't been terribly successful they're strong supporters
[02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:08.140]  as you know of open borders because they need cheap labor for their particular industries
[02:13:08.140 --> 02:13:15.500]  so they are the quintessential uh globalists uh it is it's amazing today there's a new york post
[02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:21.980]  editorial uh in which uh president donald trump begins to distance himself from operation warp
[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:29.100]  speed uh and he gets criticized uh for that uh so he he kind of kind of has can't have it uh both
[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:33.660]  well that's where i was going next he's been criticizing DeSantis for supporting the shots
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:37.100]  but DeSantis got out in front of that i think trump's finally figuring out
[02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:43.500]  what a loser these shots are well the the truth of the matter is that we had some of the most
[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:50.540]  draconian lockdowns uh in the country here in florida for over two years uh and uh governor
[02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:58.300]  de santis like president trump was a full-throated advocate uh for the safety uh and the effectiveness
[02:13:58.300 --> 02:14:06.060]  of the covid-19 uh vaccination uh and he really cannot rewrite that history uh he made a claim
[02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:12.380]  that we he had banned masks at a time that 3.6 million florida school children were still
[02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:17.260]  actually but but in fairness he did get off the mrna injection bandwagon earlier than trump
[02:14:18.860 --> 02:14:24.780]  slightly earlier but neither one of them has been for mandatory injection uh mandatory vaccination
[02:14:25.420 --> 02:14:34.140]  and i think that that's an important point so i've seen ads on fox news basically already
[02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:38.540]  running saying should de santis run those are campaign ads to get emails i mean de santis is
[02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:47.900]  running uh he is running and therefore we have to see uh if he uh is held to his many campaign
[02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:55.100]  promises before this most recent election uh one example that i have written about is uh the critical
[02:14:55.100 --> 02:15:00.300]  race theory curriculum back in the in the florida public schools prior to the election the governor
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:08.140]  said that he um that he would ban that yet i can tell you here in broward county the largest uh
[02:15:08.140 --> 02:15:13.260]  county in the state the sixth largest school district in the united states um they have just
[02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:21.340]  adopted an adl approved school curriculum that is some of the most virulent anti-white hate speech
[02:15:21.340 --> 02:15:27.420]  i have ever seen it's my understanding that this is being done in 13 other counties so
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:35.020]  is a perfect example where uh where the governor has to follow through to his credit uh i saw over
[02:15:35.020 --> 02:15:44.460]  the weekend that the state was revoking a liquor license for a venue that had a drag queen uh show
[02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:50.140]  that admitted children now i'm in favor of consenting adults doing whatever they want
[02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:57.980]  that's legal uh but i'm not in favor of children either is the governor i agree stay there roger stone
[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:04.700]  why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing info wars attacking myself and the
[02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:10.140]  crew and our other hosts because they know we're pro-human they know we're telling the truth

[02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:35.100]  covet nineteen infection and definitely with the vaccines people are lower with the spike protein

[02:20:33.660 --> 02:20:38.300]  roger stones our guests are on the alex jones show and i want to finish up with trump with
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:44.220]  other issues but just in the spirit of being completely honest about this
[02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:51.580]  it's good to have trump andis anis showing who was the most anti-shot it's good to have trump
[02:20:51.580 --> 02:20:56.380]  coming out news articles criticizing it now because even bloomberg is out yesterday saying
[02:20:56.380 --> 02:21:02.940]  okay fiser admits the shots causing strokes and other problems so the sooner trump gets away from
[02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:07.260]  this the better i like trump coming out against china i like from coming out against world war
[02:21:07.260 --> 02:21:13.260]  three i i mean i know the establishment is going against trump so that's a big feather in his cap
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:19.660]  but but roger come on the only place i could go six months into the lockdown was florida i know at
[02:21:19.660 --> 02:21:24.380]  first just saying this clamp down but california was the worst new york was the worst to say the
[02:21:24.380 --> 02:21:28.780]  worst in the country and i know trump early on only wanted two weeks and he wanted to open things
[02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:34.460]  up and i mean i get all that but i mean really you you're not really saying the sanas had the
[02:21:34.460 --> 02:21:40.220]  most drconian lockdowns in the country are you uh pretty close of course i i do live here but alex
[02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:46.060]  let's not pretend that coveted 19 is the only uh issue actually i think there's a great peace on
[02:21:46.060 --> 02:21:51.980]  this at politico today i wrote a piece about it two days ago i think donald trump is the peace
[02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:57.180]  candidate i think that he is the only candidate doesn't want to spend more money you want to
[02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:01.420]  auger when he okay when he keeps coming out against world war three when the sanas has
[02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:05.820]  been on the fence about or even supporting it that made me go back to trump instead of the sanas
[02:22:05.820 --> 02:22:09.900]  that that i mean i i'm i'm all about not having nuclear war so that's a good thing about trump
[02:22:10.940 --> 02:22:15.660]  well it won't matter we have a coveted 19 vaccination if we're all incinerated
[02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:22.060]  in a world war will it i mean the point here is trump ran in 2016 as the anti-inventionist
[02:22:22.060 --> 02:22:28.380]  kid interventionist candidate i really do believe if he were president today we wouldn't have this
[02:22:28.380 --> 02:22:36.460]  conflict uh this is really about pushing uh ukraine to put american funded offensive
[02:22:36.460 --> 02:22:43.420]  missiles on the ground in ukraine pointed at russia not to mention bio weapons labs that yes
[02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:52.060]  do exist uh and uh i there's this is not about latimer putin seeking to occupy ukraine which
[02:22:52.060 --> 02:22:56.700]  financially i don't even think he can do now putin is not a good guy we're not saying that
[02:22:56.700 --> 02:23:03.500]  but to say that this is about democracy really i mean zolinski has outlawed all the political
[02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:08.780]  parties but his has arrested all the candidates who ran against him in the last election shut
[02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:14.860]  down newspapers shut down television stations shut down radio stations arrested journalists
[02:23:14.860 --> 02:23:20.380]  shut down the oldest christian church in the world uh i was just about to get there so this
[02:23:20.380 --> 02:23:28.700]  is not most definitely not about democracy uh and uh as a congressman of course uh congressman
[02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:35.260]  ron de santis co-signed a letter supporting the uh illegal uh coup against democracy uh
[02:23:35.260 --> 02:23:41.180]  that was pulled off by the biden pardon me by the obama administration and as a governor
[02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:47.980]  he hasn't he hasn't had to tell us where to see stand in terms of spending uh more money in ukraine
[02:23:48.540 --> 02:23:53.820]  look eisenhower was elected by saying he would end the war in korea nixon was elected by saying
[02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:58.220]  he would end the war in vietnam ultimately i think trump will be elected by saying he will
[02:23:58.220 --> 02:24:05.180]  end the war in ukraine and he is the guy who cut off the russian pipeline he is the guy who sold
[02:24:05.180 --> 02:24:11.900]  offensive weapons to the ukrainians uh that the obama administration would uh not sell the idea
[02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:17.500]  that he is pro russian i think we've seen this movie it's a joke it's total crap in fact let's
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:23.660]  talk about that the russia gate hoax now we have major even liberal major publications coming out
[02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:28.540]  major democrat think tank submitting russia gate was a hoax they dropped the fake lawsuit against
[02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:33.820]  you on january 6 where has that whole fraud gone and what does the democrat deep state gonna do
[02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:42.620]  next to try to label their opposition terrorist uh stunning three piece uh uh uh set uh in the
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:49.500]  columbia journalism review by jeff girth who is one of the most respected and toughest
[02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:54.540]  investigative reporters in american history certainly no conservative certainly no trump
[02:24:54.540 --> 02:25:00.220]  supporter uh i finished it last night it is devastating uh it proves that those in the
[02:25:00.220 --> 02:25:08.060]  cia and the fbi knew that the steel dossier was a fraud uh and that they did principally use it to
[02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:15.500]  justify the mother investigation uh and the uh illegal faisal warrants uh on trump supporters
[02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:21.020]  uh where mr girth did not go and i think he should have uh is he didn't he just accepts at
[02:25:21.020 --> 02:25:27.900]  straight value the continued claim that russian intelligence hacked the democratic national
[02:25:27.900 --> 02:25:34.460]  committee that they were the target of an online act uh in my trial the fbi was forced to admit
[02:25:34.460 --> 02:25:40.380]  they never investigated the dnc servers they never inspected them sure so where do they
[02:25:40.380 --> 02:25:44.940]  where do they go next now is that fraud fell apart i mean they're in deep trouble politically what
[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:49.820]  what are they gonna pull next uh that's an excellent question but i don't have an answer
[02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:56.220]  for you i mean uh a lot a lot will depend on how courageous and how organized these house
[02:25:56.220 --> 02:26:05.580]  republicans are they have a unique opportunity to further expose uh the the two the four years of
[02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:12.460]  censorship and cancellation uh between them and elon musk the dam is now broken and when the american
[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:19.420]  people are learning all kinds of i totally agree for i totally agree and and and so republicans
[02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:23.260]  need to take control of the narrative with an impeachment of joe biden should not happen
[02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:28.220]  uh i thought from the beginning that that should happen it continues to disappoint me
[02:26:28.220 --> 02:26:34.940]  that uh speed that speaker mccarthy seems to oppose it but uh you know that's today
[02:26:34.940 --> 02:26:40.940]  let's see what the hunter biden investigation now proves what what they are doing now alex is
[02:26:40.940 --> 02:26:47.500]  very interesting we've seen this before in order to distract attention from the actual content
[02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:56.220]  of a bunch hunter biden's laptop the actual details regarding corruption treason uh debauchery
[02:26:56.220 --> 02:27:04.140]  and so on they're attempting to create a controversy about how this information became public uh and
[02:27:04.140 --> 02:27:11.100]  it became public in a perfectly legal way uh john paul mcicek the camp the uh the computer
[02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:18.300]  repair technician uh here the crackheads carelessness did this but that's not what you would not what
[02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:25.020]  you would believe uh based on the letter written by his lawyer abby lowell to the to the attorney
[02:27:25.020 --> 02:27:31.660]  general of delaware to the us attorney of delaware to the assistant attorney general so this is an
[02:27:31.660 --> 02:27:38.540]  effort to try to shift the focus we've heard this before don't focus on hillary's emails and the epic
[02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:45.020]  evidence of corruption there focus on uh these big bad russians who hacked the dnc which of course
[02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:51.500]  never actually happened there is no proof or evidence of that uh and it's the same playbook i
[02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:57.980]  don't think it will work but that is the new tactic to try to short circuit of this investigation
[02:27:57.980 --> 02:28:03.660]  of hunter biden how bad did biden's dithering on this giant chinese spy balloon hurt him
[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:10.860]  i think very badly i mean i have not seen any uh new polling but uh i think most americans
[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:16.220]  understand uh that the statements putting out saying well it's not doing any harm so we're
[02:28:16.220 --> 02:28:20.860]  not going to shoot it down how do we know what it's doing i mean what's really surprising is it seems
[02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:27.420]  to me but i'm not an expert but experts i have talked to say that the chinese have far far more
[02:28:27.420 --> 02:28:34.780]  sophisticated technology so you almost wonder whether this was a willful provocation or an act
[02:28:34.780 --> 02:28:42.060]  of propaganda or whether they really think that they could use a uh a balloon to deliver some kind of
[02:28:42.060 --> 02:28:48.780]  nuclear device well that's what they brag about is emp let's come back and talk about the censorship

[02:33:05.420 --> 02:33:14.700]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:33:16.780 --> 02:33:21.100]  all right i'd say to roger stone give us the 35 000 foot view of us and the others
[02:33:21.980 --> 02:33:29.500]  surveillance balloon above us give us the 80 000 foot view how would you describe not just america
[02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:35.100]  but world political systems right now i would describe it as very dangerous turmoil escalation
[02:33:35.100 --> 02:33:39.900]  in world war three that's what most main line analysts are even saying why would western elites
[02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:45.100]  position us in such a dangerous climate how would you describe the world right now
[02:33:46.860 --> 02:33:54.060]  it's a tinderbox uh president biden himself said weeks ago that he couldn't give a particular
[02:33:54.060 --> 02:34:00.140]  type of a tank to the ukrainians that it would mean world war three he's now sending them those
[02:34:00.140 --> 02:34:08.860]  tanks he's now sending them a patriot missiles which is a huge boondoggle for atheon they have a
[02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:15.580]  long and history of unreliability but they're very very very expensive so i think we are flirting
[02:34:15.580 --> 02:34:21.500]  with world war three this is why i come back to my argument before which is trump's greatest
[02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:27.820]  opportunity here is to emerge as the peace candidate he is the one candidate given his
[02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:32.780]  track record of getting a piece that nobody said he could do in the middle east giving his track
[02:34:32.780 --> 02:34:40.140]  record of getting this lunatic in north korea to step down from his nuclear weapons development
[02:34:40.140 --> 02:34:45.660]  program given his track record as i said earlier shutting down the russian pipeline
[02:34:47.340 --> 02:34:54.300]  selling or giving offensive weapons to ukraine tough to say he's he's a russian stuge under
[02:34:54.300 --> 02:34:59.660]  those circumstances wouldn't you say let me expand on that because i totally agree with you
[02:34:59.660 --> 02:35:04.620]  that the sanis is being pro-war and that that's a big problem and when trump says he could end
[02:35:04.620 --> 02:35:09.980]  this in a couple hours i know what trump would do with us power as a president he would have the
[02:35:09.980 --> 02:35:15.740]  power to cut off funding if zalinsky didn't make a deal to not join nato and to give russians some
[02:35:15.740 --> 02:35:20.300]  of those areas that are basically nine nine percent russian just on the border this would all end
[02:35:20.300 --> 02:35:25.340]  putin would save face and the world would not be in this much danger i think that's probably what
[02:35:25.340 --> 02:35:30.700]  trump would do correct well we'd be guessing i mean trump would be a fool to blurt out to the
[02:35:30.700 --> 02:35:35.900]  entire country his plan because then his plan would not be workable then the folks in the
[02:35:35.900 --> 02:35:41.500]  budget state department start working against such a plan but i i think that i think you've got a
[02:35:41.500 --> 02:35:47.500]  pretty good guess there i mean he hasn't divulged to me what his plan is but he understands that
[02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:54.540]  you don't end the war by giving them more money you end the war by cutting the money off and
[02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:59.900]  also um you know he's got to he's got to allow putin well yeah let's make no mistake the us
[02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:04.220]  is run by globalists but it's in charge of the world pretty much so if he was president obviously
[02:36:04.220 --> 02:36:07.420]  this would never have happened because putin would have been scared of trump and would have done it
[02:36:08.620 --> 02:36:13.900]  well and he's we still got to keep an eye on the the chinese and taiwan i mean they see our
[02:36:13.900 --> 02:36:21.100]  sickness our weakness on the balloon they see our weakness in afghanistan they see our weakness uh
[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:29.260]  in uh in uh eastern europe uh these these things are provocative uh and and um i i they would never
[02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:36.300]  move on taiwan uh if john trump or president not a chance so his best chance is to run as the
[02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:40.700]  peace candidate well let's talk about that because all the polls show he'd win by huge percentage
[02:36:40.700 --> 02:36:45.660]  points right now despite election fraud it's just a tsunami they can't defeat they're in full panic
[02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:50.300]  mode i saw abc news sunday panicking i mean it looks like he'll be the nominee he'll probably win
[02:36:51.580 --> 02:36:57.020]  what what what are they gonna do to stop that a and b if he gets in i think it will be a more
[02:36:57.020 --> 02:37:01.340]  awake galvanized trump this time uh going after the deep stake that's why they're so scared
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:08.060]  absolutely i think the trump you see running is going to be more like the 2015 2016 trump that you
[02:37:08.060 --> 02:37:14.700]  met alex rather than the incumbent you know with trappings of the republican establishment around
[02:37:14.700 --> 02:37:22.780]  him uh and therefore i think he is a lot freer to run a guerrilla style campaign many people are not
[02:37:22.780 --> 02:37:29.100]  paying attention uh to these terrific issue videos that he's been putting out on true social and i
[02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:35.020]  really wish he would go to twitter where he now has the right to go where he could reach millions
[02:37:35.020 --> 02:37:39.020]  absolutely that's such an amateur move i'm not trying to be mean to trump but
[02:37:39.020 --> 02:37:42.940]  use this hundreds of millions of followers on twitter to push the true social that's cutting
[02:37:42.940 --> 02:37:47.580]  your nose off despite your face to say oh they kicked me off so now i won't use it when he had
[02:37:47.580 --> 02:37:53.580]  this victory it's it's it's it again it's the pigheaded stuff he does that pisses me off well
[02:37:53.580 --> 02:37:58.940]  let's see what he does tomorrow i mean now he can go back at any time but if you saw the best of
[02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:06.140]  these last week he was saying that as president uh he would end the chinese ability to own any
[02:38:06.140 --> 02:38:14.940]  ranch land farmland harbor airport bridge tunnel roadway you know no foreign government should
[02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:20.380]  own critical infrastructure well and but the point of course is that any chinese national
[02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:25.980]  who owns land in this country that is the government there's no private property rights uh in china
[02:38:25.980 --> 02:38:31.740]  so that was a threat to kill your family we don't do what they said uh you can't just say uh well
[02:38:31.740 --> 02:38:36.380]  he's a chinese citizen he's not the chinese government everything belongs to the chinese
[02:38:36.380 --> 02:38:42.780]  government uh canada by the way won't let national uh foreign nationals own any real estate
[02:38:42.780 --> 02:38:48.460]  whatsoever in canada and that's hardly a right wing government to say the least so uh i think the
[02:38:48.460 --> 02:38:54.460]  trump is as has demonstrated again he will be tougher on the chinese than he even was uh in
[02:38:54.460 --> 02:39:00.060]  his first term where he forced them to pay billions and billions of dollars and to hope up some of
[02:39:00.060 --> 02:39:06.460]  their markets to our products all right let's shift gears into censorship you mentioned it uh look i
[02:39:06.460 --> 02:39:11.980]  don't trust musk as far as i can throw him but more and more he's doing bold stuff he reinstated you
[02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:16.780]  he reinstated so many others he hasn't done it to me because i'm so demonized i get that but
[02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:23.420]  what do you think of musk uh you know i'm a very i'm very grateful to him first of all
[02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:29.100]  because uh all i did was fill out a form and send it in i never dreamed that my voice would be
[02:39:29.100 --> 02:39:36.780]  restored uh since uh being hunted uh and hounded for three and a half years uh in the russian
[02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:43.020]  collusion hoax uh and being unable to defend yourself because you have no platform to do so
[02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:47.260]  well one of the rare exceptions is this one right here info wars where you've always let
[02:39:47.260 --> 02:39:53.820]  me have a voice to defend myself um it is refreshing uh to be back on twitter now it
[02:39:53.820 --> 02:40:01.260]  drives leftist crazy the amount of invective uh and hatred uh that i get in the comments um
[02:40:01.900 --> 02:40:06.700]  you know is the kind of stuff that in the old days if i did i would be banned for these people of
[02:40:06.700 --> 02:40:13.740]  course will not be uh banned but frankly i'm in a different place now i just block them and move on
[02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:19.020]  i don't argue with anybody uh you know i'm uh i'm a different person than i was i'm not
[02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:24.620]  nearly as combative and i'm much more focused on pleasing god i'm much more focused on being a
[02:40:24.620 --> 02:40:30.220]  good christian i'm i'm much more focused on doing what neccess what is necessary to save
[02:40:30.220 --> 02:40:36.860]  this nation uh and i try to avoid petty fights with lunatics by the way i know you well you were
[02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:41.980]  never a bad guy but you were pretty worldly you love to get in the fight you really got born again
[02:40:41.980 --> 02:40:47.660]  in the crucible of the fiery furnace and and you saw god as soon as you received he's a christ
[02:40:47.660 --> 02:40:53.900]  your your your fate totally turned that is absolutely correct and i understand that there
[02:40:53.900 --> 02:41:00.140]  is only one way it is his way he is the controller of all he is the king of kings uh and when you say
[02:41:00.140 --> 02:41:05.260]  the lord's prayer listen to the words you're saying because they're vitally important vitally
[02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:11.900]  important uh no i'm not perfect i'm a broken individual i'm certainly a sinner and i'm very less
[02:41:11.900 --> 02:41:18.380]  than perfect but the lord often calls on broken vessels has often called on people who were not
[02:41:18.380 --> 02:41:24.940]  perfect to to work his will in fact god exception in jesus was perfect god usually calls on the
[02:41:24.940 --> 02:41:28.700]  broken vessel why do you think that is because i guess we've been on both sides we know more
[02:41:29.500 --> 02:41:34.380]  well maybe because he believes it's because you have been tested uh maybe that's what it's about
[02:41:34.380 --> 02:41:40.780]  but uh you know i've started going to uh coral ridge presbyterian church uh great great great
[02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:46.940]  church founded by dr james kennedy uh dedicated by the great billy graham oh man james kennedy
[02:41:46.940 --> 02:41:53.900]  amazing just just it's an amazing church uh you really feel like you're at home uh our pastor rob
[02:41:53.900 --> 02:41:59.420]  pesencia is uh is one of the most incredible orders i've ever met and i've seen some great
[02:41:59.420 --> 02:42:06.780]  speakers in my day uh but he is uh he's amazing just amazing so is the holy ghost the highest you
[02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:12.620]  ever been roger i'm not sure what you mean by you're not a drug guy you drink a few martinis
[02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:19.020]  but i'm saying is the high of jesus not incredible uh once you really completely understand it i mean
[02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:24.700]  the point of course is that you have to surrender all fear to faith it's not an easy thing to do
[02:42:24.700 --> 02:42:32.140]  the two hardest things about being a christian is one uh is downloading all fear and putting
[02:42:32.140 --> 02:42:38.620]  total faith in him uh and then secondarily since i'm you know half sicilian uh in the old days
[02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:45.180]  roger stone would want revenge revenge on anybody who tried to destroy me and my family uh but he
[02:42:45.180 --> 02:42:51.820]  brews 10 30 through 31 tells us vengeance is reserved for the lord and therefore the bad guys will
[02:42:51.820 --> 02:42:56.940]  get theirs but not from me god will make those judge rocks stay there powerful stay with us
[02:42:59.340 --> 02:43:05.340]  i talk a lot about the great successes info wars is sad i don't think anybody can deny it and it is
[02:43:05.980 --> 02:43:10.700]  because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the crew at info wars people
[02:43:10.700 --> 02:43:16.860]  behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been the mvps in this fight
[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:22.220]  and we look at harris and smith and oh and stroyer and the hard work they engage in every day
[02:43:22.220 --> 02:43:27.900]  five six seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself the whole info wars

[02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:37.660]  your friends family neighbors perfect strangers about it now roger you know me i don't like to
[02:47:37.660 --> 02:47:41.340]  cover january 6th as i knew it was a fraud to begin with and we tried to stop what happened we were
[02:47:41.340 --> 02:47:45.420]  set up sitting with russia gay but now it's all come out they've dropped their fake lawsuit against
[02:47:45.420 --> 02:47:53.100]  you the democratic party has but they're still persecuting joe biggs and falsely convicting people
[02:47:53.100 --> 02:48:00.620]  uh you know from the oath keepers like steward rode's and they admit it's a precedent to put
[02:48:00.620 --> 02:48:05.100]  any of us they want in prison anytime they want by calling us domestic terrorists so what's your
[02:48:05.100 --> 02:48:12.540]  view on that uh i'm uh first of all i'm gratified uh that uh the lord answered my prayers and a
[02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:20.060]  federal judge last miss last week dismissed all the charges in a civil lawsuit filed obscenively
[02:48:20.060 --> 02:48:25.900]  by eight capitol hill police officers against president trump and i and others uh but really
[02:48:25.900 --> 02:48:34.700]  financed and pushed forward by some george soros uh front grew um as you know alex um i was not on
[02:48:34.700 --> 02:48:39.740]  the ellipse didn't march to the capital wasn't at the capital and know nothing about this and any
[02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:46.220]  claim that i knew in advance about participated in or condone any illegal action is false the same
[02:48:46.220 --> 02:48:54.060]  is true of you because i know that uh and therefore i was looking at tens of thousands of dollars in
[02:48:54.060 --> 02:49:00.780]  legal fees uh in a complicated civil trial which there is no evidence against me because
[02:49:00.780 --> 02:49:08.060]  i'm completely uninvolved at the same time i am praying for those men and women um who appeared
[02:49:08.060 --> 02:49:15.020]  to me to being that being denied due process who appeared to me to being held in inhumane
[02:49:15.020 --> 02:49:22.700]  conditions uh i don't condone any illegal action but i think the punishment has to fit the crime
[02:49:23.260 --> 02:49:29.580]  and i think that everyone's entitled to a speedy trial and due process my biggest concern is that
[02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:37.100]  everybody who is charged with a crime needs to have competent uh uh legal uh legal representation
[02:49:37.820 --> 02:49:42.460]  that has their best interests and their clients best interests in heart many of these
[02:49:42.460 --> 02:49:47.980]  uh men and women are representing themselves uh or they are stuck with the public defender
[02:49:47.980 --> 02:49:53.660]  who just wants them to sign a confession and blame donald trump uh so it is it's a national scandal
[02:49:54.220 --> 02:50:01.900]  and it is a disgrace i i'm praying for each and every one of them i tell you to see what they've
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:07.100]  done to people that were nonviolent and to see them say it's the present for all of us this is a
[02:50:07.100 --> 02:50:13.020]  really really really dangerous group but it's good to see the republicans not giving swallows well
[02:50:13.020 --> 02:50:18.380]  and shift committee chairmanship i'm i'm i'm hopefully optimistic with some of the first moves
[02:50:18.380 --> 02:50:23.740]  i see out of mccarthy i think mccarthy is more like a weather vane and which way he sees the wind
[02:50:23.740 --> 02:50:29.500]  blow he'll go uh and so he sees all this populist pressure and so it looks like he's starting to
[02:50:29.500 --> 02:50:36.220]  do some of the right things what do you say uh in the final analysis i think sadly the the result
[02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:40.700]  we got out of the election was the best possible result i said if you're like you predicted it
[02:50:40.700 --> 02:50:45.900]  six months before you said even better than a big majority is a tiny one because that tiny
[02:50:45.900 --> 02:50:50.860]  majority of patriots about to control the conners and i think that is true so right now
[02:50:50.860 --> 02:50:56.620]  matt gates and andy biggs and jim jordan and and alise stefanik and a handful of other
[02:50:57.340 --> 02:51:04.700]  patriots um have disproportionate influence within the caucus had we won by 25 or 35 seats
[02:51:04.700 --> 02:51:11.500]  we'd still have nancy polosi's rules we have king uh mccarthy uh and none of these things
[02:51:11.500 --> 02:51:18.940]  would be possible i think matt gates deserves enormous credit uh for playing uh his hand out
[02:51:18.940 --> 02:51:25.580]  the way he did by taking a principled stand uh and in the end he got all of the rule changes
[02:51:25.580 --> 02:51:30.540]  that allow the republican majority to be extraordinarily effective so he basically he
[02:51:30.540 --> 02:51:39.740]  basically neutered uh mccarthy at any one moment uh if any five members were unhappy with mccarthy's
[02:51:39.740 --> 02:51:45.020]  leadership any one of them can make a privileged motion to vacate the chair and we'd be we'd have
[02:51:45.020 --> 02:51:48.700]  to have a vote a vote and listen i know you don't like to take credit behind the scenes but i know
[02:51:48.700 --> 02:51:53.580]  you advise gates tell you the guy that got him on the show one time uh were you advising gates on
[02:51:53.580 --> 02:51:59.020]  this on this direction i have not talked to matt gates in several years so i cannot take credit
[02:51:59.020 --> 02:52:04.460]  for any of this i just but i think he did a great job uh and uh uh and i think he's handled himself
[02:52:04.460 --> 02:52:11.500]  extraordinarily well in a high pressure situation we got the best possible result mccarthy either
[02:52:11.500 --> 02:52:18.700]  has to deliver for the caucus or he'll be replaced uh and that's the and that is the truth so um i'll
[02:52:18.700 --> 02:52:26.620]  tell you a good starting place alex we need to see the 14 000 hours of videotape of everything
[02:52:26.620 --> 02:52:31.900]  happened around january 6 and gates just said he's gonna release that or trying to he's he's
[02:52:31.900 --> 02:52:37.500]  demanding it and it needs to happen uh and we need to have that that commitment needs to be helped
[02:52:37.500 --> 02:52:43.020]  needs to be kept okay so they had russia gate they had ukraine gate two impeachments uh they had
[02:52:43.020 --> 02:52:49.820]  january 6 what is their net they're pushing race war uh what what's the deep state gonna pull now
[02:52:49.820 --> 02:52:53.500]  i asked you that earlier but really put your thinking cap on your smart guy what your opinion
[02:52:53.500 --> 02:52:58.700]  what are they gonna do they're not gonna give up well i thought that perhaps we'd have another
[02:52:58.700 --> 02:53:05.740]  pandemic but the problem is their last pandemic uh has so undermine the credibility of these
[02:53:05.740 --> 02:53:13.260]  public health organizations um that i think they'd have a hard time pulling that off i think that
[02:53:13.260 --> 02:53:20.380]  they are hell bent on war uh in a war footing and the idea that in a war we have to rally behind the
[02:53:20.380 --> 02:53:27.820]  commander and chief and the and the majority party that's that's my greatest fear at this point
[02:53:27.820 --> 02:53:34.380]  i agree it's a hundred percent war card right now and and that is enough to keep you up at night
[02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:41.020]  i mean we are can anybody even tell how many hundred billion we have sent and where it's going
[02:53:41.020 --> 02:53:46.860]  i think it's close to 200 billion right now and and i think you pointed out some of this
[02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:54.300]  this extraordinarily sophisticated uh military equipment doesn't require soldiers to man it
[02:53:54.940 --> 02:54:02.220]  it's completely you know autonomous uh and and deadly so uh it is uh you know i it's
[02:54:02.220 --> 02:54:08.300]  very hard to understand when senator ran paul sponsors an amendment to require an inspector
[02:54:08.300 --> 02:54:15.100]  general to keep cash track of where the cash is going why would any senator vote against that
[02:54:15.100 --> 02:54:19.980]  why would any senator not want to know that the money is getting to the to the battlefield that's
[02:54:19.980 --> 02:54:27.020]  getting to the war uh very valued on ran paul's part but i think that he had a handful of senators
[02:54:27.020 --> 02:54:32.220]  who supported him disgraceful one minute left what's your prediction or gut level on all the
[02:54:32.220 --> 02:54:37.420]  fizer and modern news that's causing heart attacks and cancer and and and blood clots in the brain
[02:54:37.420 --> 02:54:41.580]  strokes i mean that's all over the news now that's got to scare the establishment this blew over
[02:54:41.580 --> 02:54:48.140]  their face well it's still surprising how many people don't know about it alex i mean you and i
[02:54:48.140 --> 02:54:53.260]  know about it because we watch alternative media uh you've reported on it uh we've read
[02:54:53.260 --> 02:54:58.620]  authoritative studies from around the world but there are still people who believe the vaccination
[02:54:58.620 --> 02:55:05.820]  is both safe uh and effective uh it's funny when you're on twitter you read you get a you get an
[02:55:05.820 --> 02:55:11.980]  enormous amount of good information about authoritative studies and authoritative doctors and so on
[02:55:12.620 --> 02:55:18.620]  in between these government paid ads telling you to get the jab uh it's it is it's really uh
[02:55:18.620 --> 02:55:23.660]  it's really something paradoxical all right roger stone five p.m what central frank speech

[03:02:28.140 --> 03:02:41.740]  this is c nbc published march 30th 2022 if his reputation was it bad enough before russia's
[03:02:41.740 --> 03:02:49.340]  unprovoked invasion of ukraine president vladimir putin is now evenly more seen
[03:02:49.340 --> 03:02:59.260]  un widely seen as unstable unreliable untrustworthy and those are the more generous descriptions
[03:02:59.900 --> 03:03:07.340]  of a leader who has ordered an overseen violent and destructive aggression toward russia's
[03:03:07.340 --> 03:03:17.980]  smaller neighbor this is in journalism this is a lot of rotten stupid garbage crap hey

[03:07:14.300 --> 03:07:15.980]  they go on to say
[03:07:20.700 --> 03:07:33.260]  specifically many experts this is holly elliott el yat t at cnbc specifically many experts
[03:07:33.260 --> 03:07:43.580]  many experts you mean the clowns that you look to as experts hey what expert you're talking about
[03:07:44.220 --> 03:07:51.740]  oh the experts that haven't won a war since world war two oh maybe you're too young to remember the

[03:08:21.820 --> 03:08:25.580]  specifically many experts are asking whether the invasion of ukraine
[03:08:25.580 --> 03:08:31.980]  which has had unintended consequences for russia leaving it on the verge of economic
[03:08:31.980 --> 03:08:41.260]  ruin oh yeah oh it's on the verge of economic ruin this is why by the way you listen to info wars
[03:08:41.260 --> 03:08:49.820]  and you subscribe to the trans journal we don't write crap we're not garbage salesmen like these
[03:08:49.820 --> 03:09:02.300]  people are prostitutes look it up in wikipedia prostitutes a word that i came up with media
[03:09:02.300 --> 03:09:10.300]  whores get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and their government whore masters yep
[03:09:12.940 --> 03:09:19.500]  anyway leaving on the verge of economic ruin while uniting most of the international community
[03:09:19.500 --> 03:09:25.500]  against it no not most of the international community the warm mongering freaks in nato hey
[03:09:25.500 --> 03:09:33.980]  you guys did a great job in yugoslavia love what you did in libya oh and the iraq wars and the afghan
[03:09:33.980 --> 03:09:43.260]  wars wars wars international community oh china they're not international are they oh in india
[03:09:43.260 --> 03:09:49.580]  no no no there's only what 2.8 billion people between the two of them
[03:09:55.740 --> 03:10:03.260]  and most of south america and africa oh they don't count as the international community
[03:10:03.260 --> 03:10:17.180]  why no only only europe does in the united states could backfire spectacularly on putin
[03:10:17.180 --> 03:10:22.780]  leaving him vulnerable to an uprising at home i'm mentioning it to you because this is the
[03:10:22.780 --> 03:10:30.700]  kind of crap that everybody forgets but that everybody was repeating as it was happening
[03:10:30.700 --> 03:10:41.020]  yeah just like they follow the covid war stand six feet apart get behind that plexiglass the wind
[03:10:41.020 --> 03:10:48.380]  doesn't go under it doesn't go around it doesn't go over it no no no no and stand six feet apart
[03:10:48.380 --> 03:10:54.060]  because the wind does not blow any more than six feet in a direct straight line and when you're in
[03:10:54.060 --> 03:10:59.420]  an airplane wear the mask but you can take it off when you're eating and drinking because covid
[03:10:59.420 --> 03:11:08.300]  doesn't get you then these are the same moronic stupid masses that swallow the mainstream media crap
[03:11:10.300 --> 03:11:18.140]  again tracking trends is an understanding of how we got here where we are to see where we're going
[03:11:18.940 --> 03:11:25.980]  so how we got here and that's what i'm doing show you how we got here and how the masses swallow
[03:11:25.980 --> 03:11:33.900]  the propaganda and march off to a i'm a yanky doodle dandy a yanky doodle do or die
[03:11:36.860 --> 03:11:43.820]  do or die for what for what's going on in europe they have no business getting into
[03:11:43.820 --> 03:11:51.820]  what they they shot the odd stupeford man in serriero yeah what's the serriero who cares about
[03:11:51.820 --> 03:11:57.660]  an odd stupe and what are they doing over there or they have no business being there
[03:11:58.700 --> 03:12:00.700]  i mean a place a country that they stole
[03:12:03.740 --> 03:12:12.220]  brought to you by woodrow wilson may he rotten hell he was the federal reserve and income tax
[03:12:12.220 --> 03:12:21.340]  income tax don't forget to pay your income tax and get half of it stolen and half of the 1.7 trillion
[03:12:21.340 --> 03:12:28.540]  dollar budget the clowns the imbeciles that people vote for the repulsive kinsen democrats

[03:12:40.860 --> 03:12:52.780]  so the people buy the crap that they sell and they bought the covid war and this is
[03:12:52.780 --> 03:13:01.900]  the propaganda that they were selling never a word never a word of why the russians invaded
[03:13:02.940 --> 03:13:08.060]  not a word about nato moving not quote one inch further was the deal made between gorbachev
[03:13:08.060 --> 03:13:14.620]  and bush senior that nato would not move one inch further or there were 16 nato countries then
[03:13:15.260 --> 03:13:26.380]  now there were 30 not a word about what we wrote about in the trends journal in 2014 when it was

[03:13:59.260 --> 03:14:06.860]  the coup led by within members of political and business elite quote the solution begins with
[03:14:06.860 --> 03:14:13.340]  naming the problem the problem is a mad dictator which essentially got to tax the reality 20 years
[03:14:13.340 --> 03:14:20.540]  in power and he's absolutely delusional and ready to do whatever he can to destabilize the global
[03:14:20.540 --> 03:14:29.500]  order said vladimir milov a russian opposition politician why of course why not believe a russian

[03:23:03.900 --> 03:23:15.500]  to how we got here they the cnbc remember what they say over here is that they um experts
[03:23:16.140 --> 03:23:22.460]  specifically many experts are asking so the first expert they ask is this guy
[03:23:22.460 --> 03:23:30.860]  who uh latinia milov a russian opposition politician former energy
[03:23:32.300 --> 03:23:40.700]  former deputy energy minister who now lives in wilith wania okay he's he's he's he's really up there
[03:23:41.420 --> 03:23:44.860]  and um u.s president joe biden
[03:23:44.860 --> 03:23:54.540]  this past weekend this is again this is uh march 30th suggested that putin quote
[03:23:55.500 --> 03:24:05.580]  cannot remain in power and quote in russia oh you mean bs biden out of his mind biden
[03:24:05.580 --> 03:24:16.300]  warmongering biden biden the draft dodger a couple of years older than me dodged the vietnam
[03:24:16.300 --> 03:24:24.060]  war draft got deferments but loves to send other people to go get killed and loves killing others
[03:24:24.060 --> 03:24:33.420]  that's joe biden oh by the way when i was a young guy you know in my late teens and early 20s i was
[03:24:33.420 --> 03:24:41.420]  stupid enough to believe the vietnam war and it's the same thing they're doing now just how the masses
[03:24:42.940 --> 03:24:52.540]  believe in supporting ukraine and how i read last week on info was the baloney spewing out of the
[03:24:52.540 --> 03:24:59.420]  crap mouth of little lindsay graham that basically if we don't stop russia now before you know it
[03:24:59.420 --> 03:25:07.820]  it's going to be only europe and the whole world is the next europe is next and this is our it's our
[03:25:07.820 --> 03:25:13.740]  interest they sold the same baloney with the vietnam war that the dominos would keep falling
[03:25:14.380 --> 03:25:20.460]  yeah william f buckley you know that f stands for yeah you could throw you in there too yeah end it
[03:25:20.460 --> 03:25:28.140]  with uh whatever you want yep little nothing of a boy lindsay graham little nothing of a clown
[03:25:28.140 --> 03:25:36.620]  yeah i couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag loves war like yellow warhors never go fight
[03:25:36.620 --> 03:25:46.140]  but send others to go die went over there to ukraine to support them so they're selling the same thing
[03:25:46.140 --> 03:25:51.980]  now and i told you i was too stupid another guy blooming thaw i think that's his name blooming
[03:25:51.980 --> 03:25:58.780]  something blooming crap yet there he is the clown on the left another another arrogant guy that got
[03:25:58.780 --> 03:26:04.380]  like four draft deferments in vietnam war we're about the same age and then because you know he's
[03:26:04.380 --> 03:26:08.780]  in the member of the club he joined you know the national god or something he never left
[03:26:08.780 --> 03:26:16.300]  washington dc and lied and lied when he's running for campaigning that he fought in vietnam
[03:26:16.300 --> 03:26:23.020]  so anyway i was too stupid i believed it but i didn't want to go die that's why i did everything to
[03:26:23.020 --> 03:26:27.660]  beat the drift you know i'm looking at these pictures guys walking up to water this high
[03:26:28.220 --> 03:26:32.220]  with with guns over their head and 50 pounds of weight on their back with these knapsacks
[03:26:32.220 --> 03:26:39.420]  getting shot i said i want to do that but these other guys they lie they lie about what they did
[03:26:39.420 --> 03:26:47.980]  and who they are and keep promoting war so going back to this article biden said quote putin
[03:26:47.980 --> 03:26:55.420]  cannot remain in power what if putin said george w bush cannot remain in power
[03:26:55.980 --> 03:27:04.940]  was starting the iraq and afghan war why those dirty russians how about if putin said the
[03:27:04.940 --> 03:27:17.180]  nobel piece of crap prize winner barack obama here it is god sakes god sakes what god you're
[03:27:17.180 --> 03:27:24.060]  talking about oh you're the phony catholic you're the phony guy that calls yourself a catholic
[03:27:24.060 --> 03:27:30.380]  what god you're talking about because the prince of peace biden doesn't go for murderous wars like
[03:27:30.380 --> 03:27:45.180]  you do so going on about suggesting that biden wants to get rid of putin and the other wars
[03:27:45.180 --> 03:27:51.580]  that they keep lying us into the vietnam war they're doing the same thing now they're saying if we
[03:27:51.580 --> 03:28:03.180]  don't stop the russians it's going to be the end then they quote another guy melinda haring deputy
[03:28:03.180 --> 03:28:11.100]  director of the elana council eurasia told cb nbc on wednesday this is a closed political system
[03:28:11.980 --> 03:28:20.460]  vladimir putin is very paranoid very controlled and we don't know what people at the end
[03:28:20.460 --> 03:28:28.860]  we don't know what people are thinking there are things that have happened that have surprised all of us
[03:28:36.060 --> 03:28:43.340]  the military going to overthrow putin i don't think so it is very very unlikely she was right

[03:33:46.940 --> 03:33:52.700]  came out with and are the true or false but i really want to stay on this ukraine war because
[03:33:52.700 --> 03:33:59.740]  this is my greatest concern and because they keep ramping it up and there's no end in sight you go
[03:33:59.740 --> 03:34:04.940]  back to when it began that uh biden said they weren't going to send any offensive offensive
[03:34:04.940 --> 03:34:12.300]  weapons and that is sending tanks and missiles you know we're at war with russia it's not a proxy
[03:34:12.300 --> 03:34:20.860]  war we're at war but i want to also show you again in trend forecasting tracking trends is the
[03:34:20.860 --> 03:34:27.580]  understanding of where we are and how we got here so you can see where we're going and as i
[03:34:27.580 --> 03:34:35.340]  just detailed and there's more to it in that propaganda piece by cnbc when the whole thing
[03:34:35.340 --> 03:34:40.860]  started the average person started belting out the stuff that putin's out of his mind he's crazy
[03:34:40.860 --> 03:34:51.900]  he's going to be and that's what they were selling and it hadn't stopped this is from december 17th
[03:34:53.900 --> 03:35:05.180]  from the daily star front page vultures circling putin as despot faces coup from once loyal henchmen
[03:35:05.180 --> 03:35:14.140]  mad vlad putin faces pressure in moscow as the continued failure of russians army in ukraine
[03:35:14.700 --> 03:35:21.420]  sparked renewed rumors that the former loyalists inside the kremlin are preparing to oust him
[03:35:26.540 --> 03:35:32.620]  they keep saying that russia is losing how about that place called maripole and about 20 percent
[03:35:32.620 --> 03:35:40.620]  of ukraine that russia took so far how about the destruction of well over 50 percent of ukraine's
[03:35:40.620 --> 03:35:50.620]  infrastructure power and water but this is how they keep selling the lives that people keep
[03:35:50.620 --> 03:35:59.180]  swallowing so they keep supporting the war that was december 17th let's go to december 29th
[03:35:59.180 --> 03:36:09.340]  the war is at a stalemate ukraine's intelligence chief says well if ukraine's intelligence chief
[03:36:09.340 --> 03:36:18.940]  says and it must be true it's not at a stalemate intelligence is an oxymoron when you quote a
[03:36:18.940 --> 03:36:24.060]  moron like they're intelligence chief but that's the way they keep selling it
[03:36:24.060 --> 03:36:32.940]  he told bbc this but but but i can't say the other word it begins with another b
[03:36:36.060 --> 03:36:41.100]  this is judge report boy that thing really went down i used to go to judge report a lot
[03:36:41.740 --> 03:36:45.100]  you know i thought they were putting out some great stuff and now it's the same story there
[03:36:45.100 --> 03:36:51.580]  for like three days and stupid stuff that's it really went down you know and and this is more
[03:36:51.580 --> 03:36:57.740]  proof of it yeah this is this is what the front page looked like it's at the end of the year year
[03:36:57.740 --> 03:37:10.700]  end putin alone doesn't know what to do yep putin's alone he doesn't know what to do total propaganda
[03:37:12.940 --> 03:37:19.660]  and to add imbeciles to the morons and jerks that are running our lives this arrogant little boy
[03:37:19.660 --> 03:37:25.260]  another little clown of a nothing this jen stoltenberg over there the nato secretary general
[03:37:26.940 --> 03:37:33.660]  it may sound like a paradox but military support for ukraine is the fastest way to peace sound like
[03:37:33.660 --> 03:37:40.860]  a paradox you sound like a damn moron you sound like an arrogant imbecilic warmongering freak
[03:37:40.860 --> 03:37:49.820]  not an oxy not a paradox you're a jerk
[03:37:52.460 --> 03:37:57.260]  we know that most wars end with negotiating table probably this war too yeah we know they
[03:37:57.260 --> 03:38:04.060]  do and they will but we know what ukraine can achieve in these negotiations depends
[03:38:04.060 --> 03:38:10.700]  inextricably on the military situation now guess what you're losing
[03:38:13.420 --> 03:38:18.460]  this is from the financial times january 5th
[03:38:20.860 --> 03:38:23.900]  by a boy named henry fox
[03:38:23.900 --> 03:38:33.260]  henry fox the ukraine war has completely gone wrong for putin
[03:38:37.340 --> 03:38:45.020]  kitten not a fox a little kitten a little pussy cat ready for this
[03:38:46.140 --> 03:38:49.820]  yeah why don't you spend a lot of money don't subscribe to the trends journal for only three
[03:38:49.820 --> 03:38:56.060]  dollars a week with a magazine that you can't find you won't find in-depth trends analysis
[03:38:56.060 --> 03:39:02.060]  and trend forecasts anywhere else pay a lot more money and go to foreign policy this is foreign
[03:39:02.060 --> 03:39:10.460]  policy january 7th it's high time to prepare for russia's collapse
[03:39:10.460 --> 03:39:18.140]  you see the propaganda that they're selling and the mainstream buys it
[03:39:19.740 --> 03:39:28.140]  let's go a little further down a couple of days jesus and post january 14th russia's

[03:40:04.140 --> 03:40:09.580]  his goal was to erase ukraine as a sovereign nation in a matter of days no it wasn't total lie
[03:40:09.580 --> 03:40:19.340]  nearly a year later ukraine's survival is much safer bet than putin's i guess you're a losing

[03:48:02.940 --> 03:48:09.180]  russian military chiefs are losing patience with putin and could soon turn on him in a coup
[03:48:09.180 --> 03:48:24.620]  or a former aid predicts this is last friday as ukrainians are losing and this is what they
[03:48:24.620 --> 03:48:33.820]  keep selling zolinsky at the world economic conference over there at the forum davos i'm
[03:48:33.820 --> 03:48:42.540]  unsure if putin is even alive and then of course the great united states military it hasn't won a
[03:48:42.540 --> 03:48:50.380]  war since world war two did a great job at shooting down that balloon yeah yeah pop goes the weasel
[03:48:51.580 --> 03:48:59.180]  yep the pop heard around the world what a joke oh you're going to stop hypersonic missiles coming
[03:48:59.180 --> 03:49:05.980]  and oh yeah of course we are we got the defense system yeah we just paid uh 160 trillion dollars
[03:49:05.980 --> 03:49:13.980]  for it you know it's great yeah you know people realize it rewards the end of life
[03:49:17.260 --> 03:49:23.900]  no they don't realize and world war three has begun it was the cover valin magazine on
[03:49:23.900 --> 03:49:33.500]  february 22nd last year two days before russia invaded yep russian military chiefs are losing
[03:49:33.500 --> 03:49:38.780]  patience and i'm making this stuff up with putin it could soon turn on minnaku a former aid
[03:49:39.500 --> 03:49:45.340]  you know an aid a former aid well if the aid says so then you know and that's all they do
[03:49:45.340 --> 03:49:51.820]  it keeps selling the people that the war should keep going so i want to talk a little bit about
[03:49:51.820 --> 03:50:01.820]  the economy and the big thing happened on you know last week on friday was the job numbers came out
[03:50:02.860 --> 03:50:08.860]  and they said that um over five hundred and sixty something thousand jobs are created
[03:50:09.420 --> 03:50:15.420]  but then when you look at the real data compared to a year ago there were 2.5 million less jobs
[03:50:15.420 --> 03:50:25.020]  and our forecast was that they would raise interest rates only 25 basis points which they did
[03:50:25.900 --> 03:50:33.260]  and we said when they raise some 25 basis points goal prices will go up and sell all the markets
[03:50:33.260 --> 03:50:40.860]  which they did and then they reversed on friday so is this a real number or is it a
[03:50:40.860 --> 03:50:48.460]  jut will it be adjusted because each week in the trends journal for the last 26 weeks
[03:50:49.260 --> 03:50:54.540]  we've been detailing the major firings going off around the country
[03:50:56.460 --> 03:51:01.820]  high tech one one company after another only high tech all throughout you know
[03:51:01.820 --> 03:51:11.500]  those uh furniture companies on and on uh and and another big one is temporary workers
[03:51:11.900 --> 03:51:20.220]  36 000 temporary workers were fired in december during the height of holiday shopping
[03:51:22.540 --> 03:51:28.060]  you hire people during that time don't you yeah but you mean they got fired that's right you
[03:51:28.060 --> 03:51:34.700]  know why they got fired because retail sales were going down okay retail sales are going down
[03:51:35.500 --> 03:51:39.660]  temp workers and by the way the temporary workers that were fired
[03:51:41.340 --> 03:51:51.420]  the um yeah they said 35 000 uh it it's it is a real warning sign the you go back to the panic
[03:51:51.420 --> 03:52:00.700]  of 08 by the way i took that domain name out in 2007 that's where they started firing first
[03:52:00.700 --> 03:52:08.060]  you go back to the dot-com bust they start firing the temporary workers so these numbers to us aren't
[03:52:08.060 --> 03:52:17.180]  realistic but here's the bottom line and the bottom line is it's all going down the markets
[03:52:17.180 --> 03:52:23.020]  are a rig game where they're going anybody it's it's it's guest time the federal reserve the
[03:52:23.020 --> 03:52:28.620]  central banks will do anything they can't keep artificially propping up the economy but even
[03:52:28.620 --> 03:52:41.820]  this 25 rate hike is going to bring down the economy sales are going down across the board
[03:52:41.820 --> 03:52:50.380]  so we are looking for a continued decline when they meet again in March
[03:52:51.900 --> 03:52:57.500]  they're going to raise them another 25 basis points that's going to bring the economy down
[03:52:57.500 --> 03:53:05.100]  even slow even more so it's definitely going to be an economic downturn the biggest crisis
[03:53:05.100 --> 03:53:12.140]  on the real estate front that virtually no one is talking about is in the commercial office sector
[03:53:14.380 --> 03:53:28.140]  you're looking now and this is according to castle with a k their reports just over 50
[03:53:28.140 --> 03:53:33.580]  percent it's like 50.4 percent or something like that of office occupancy in the 10 major cities
