[00:00:04.784 --> 00:00:07.005]  It's Monday, February 6, 2023.
[00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.906]  That still takes some getting
[00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:32.317]  Used to.
[00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:44.267]  I've tried to explain to people for a long time that there is a fight between good and evil and that Satan has a signature and that Satan is using culture to get us to destroy ourselves.
[00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:56.757]  And I've told you a lot of stories about myself and others when I went out to Hollywood and pretty much instantly got taken to the top of it, that it was open Satanism and Luciferianism.
[00:01:00.444 --> 00:01:13.894]  And now every major performance that gets the main focus of a Super Bowl or the Olympics or the Grammys is a satanic ritual.
[00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:20.118]  They'll normally give the different deities ancient names, but now that's not enough for them.
[00:01:20.118 --> 00:01:27.303]  They're openly having people dance around in top hats with women in cages as sex slaves.
[00:01:27.303 --> 00:01:29.085]  And when you think about this and you see
[00:01:31.038 --> 00:01:40.707]  What goes on in Hollywood and the people really in the cages and the pedophilia and all the rest of it they are throwing this in your face.
[00:01:40.707 --> 00:01:53.359]  And of course both the quote stars British pop star Sam Smith is non-binary along with Petrus who's a man saying he's a woman.
[00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.862]  When you go to the Drag Queen Storytime events or you see the video online
[00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:11.958]  Or you see the city council meetings, it's men dressed like clowns, that then go and say, we are women, so it's lie upon lie upon lie, and we want access to your children.
[00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:15.220]  And their regalia is that of satanic clowns.
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:24.386]  The archetype, in all ancient societies, of the most dangerous demons.
[00:02:24.386 --> 00:02:27.948]  And then you see things like the Olympics, with a grim reaper coming down out of the sky,
[00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:31.763]  And killing a bunch of little children.
[00:02:31.763 --> 00:02:38.666]  And that was a little prelude with a big COVID virus with spike protein sticking out of it.
[00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:41.087]  Killing the children.
[00:02:41.087 --> 00:02:46.430]  And the nurses delivering the children into the hands of the Grim Reaper.
[00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.493]  They believe they have to throw it in your face.
[00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:57.795]  And that is indeed what they are doing.
[00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:11.929]  Madonna famously likes to act like she's a priest, or a Puritan, but then she defiles God, or she dresses up like Baphomet.
[00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:17.393]  They're telling you who they work for.
[00:03:17.393 --> 00:03:23.037]  And it's funny, I've been friends with Mark Dice for, I don't know, 15, 16 years, but he's a hard guy to get on the show.
[00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:25.138]  He called me yesterday just about some other issues.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.841]  And we were talking about censorship and I said, you got to come on this week and talk about the satanic agenda.
[00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:41.504]  I, of course, didn't know the Grammys were about to come on and basically be a star studded event of open Satanism.
[00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:44.925]  We had a lot of big stories today, but I'm going to hit this.
[00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:50.326]  We have two big guests as well, Mike Lindell and Roger Stone, but
[00:03:52.671 --> 00:03:55.773]  There's a little cherry on top of all of this.
[00:03:55.773 --> 00:04:00.877]  And guess who the main sponsor of this was last night?
[00:04:00.877 --> 00:04:04.579]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:21.111]  And it doesn't get any more satanic than forcing deadly injections on people that destroy their fertility, lower their life expectancy, and give them horribly degenerative, painful diseases.
[00:04:23.652 --> 00:04:26.994]  Grammys brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:04:26.994 --> 00:04:29.596]  So that's all coming up today and we've got so much more.
[00:04:29.596 --> 00:04:32.618]  We're going to join some stations in 60 seconds.
[00:04:32.618 --> 00:04:40.263]  World health organizations officially put out their new global treaty to ban all free speech, take over your body, and forcibly inject you, and global surveillance.
[00:04:40.263 --> 00:04:43.666]  Bank of America CEO says we're preparing for possible U.S.
[00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:45.827]  jet default and bail-ins.
[00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:48.369]  Bill Gates announces the plan to ban beef and make you eat bugs.
[00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:49.170]  We've got specifics.
[00:04:50.254 --> 00:04:53.483]  And just so much more here today.
[00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:57.033]  You do not want to miss this Monday, February 6th transmission.
[00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:11.454]  The good news is the Real Red Pill Plus after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients run available with supply chain breakdowns is finally back in stock in the last month.
[00:05:11.454 --> 00:05:15.157]  The bad news is we need a limited run of it and it's almost sold out.
[00:05:15.157 --> 00:05:17.539]  So we're in late January when I'm cutting this.
[00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.624]  Only seven days left to get the Real Red Pill Plus with all the key ingredients like preglanone and more
[00:05:23.024 --> 00:05:23.704]  We're good to go.
[00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:52.079]  You need to try the Real Red Pill Plus right now, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:54.001]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:59.326]  Real Red Pill Plus, now available at 50% off at InfoWarStore.com for only a few more days.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.321]  Big Brother.
[00:06:11.321 --> 00:06:13.103]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:13.103 --> 00:06:14.984]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:14.984 --> 00:06:16.686]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:18.447]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:18.447 --> 00:06:28.556]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:35.602]  Human civilizations for thousands and thousands upon thousands of years follow a cycle of death and rebirth.
[00:06:35.602 --> 00:06:37.944]  And always at the end of a civilization,
[00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:43.943]  Opened, devil worship, Satan worship begins.
[00:06:43.943 --> 00:06:46.805]  And the left will claim, oh, that's a Christian construct, the devil.
[00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:47.946]  No, it's not.
[00:06:47.946 --> 00:06:50.887]  It's in every culture, in every age.
[00:06:50.887 --> 00:07:05.375]  And when you start seeing the type of rituals being conducted in public by the establishment, they are ushering in everyone's destruction, and Satan knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:08.237]  Fat men saying they're women,
[00:07:09.332 --> 00:07:13.695]  Dressed like clowns, being worshipped on stage.
[00:07:13.695 --> 00:07:17.837]  That is the uniform of these individuals.
[00:07:17.837 --> 00:07:27.883]  Showing women sex slaves in cages, being beaten by female devils with bull whips.
[00:07:27.883 --> 00:07:38.349]  Now, they have national TV ads by Gillette and others saying if a man asks a woman out it's a harassment.
[00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:41.899]  Well, the word mother and father is bad.
[00:07:41.899 --> 00:08:01.515]  But we have an event like this where Petrus is this man dressed like a woman in a sex slave cage, surrounded by devils, and then a non-binary fat man is being worshipped while he wears a top hat with devil horns.
[00:08:08.533 --> 00:08:10.014]  And do me a favor, guys.
[00:08:10.014 --> 00:08:12.015]  I mean, I was aware of who these people are.
[00:08:12.015 --> 00:08:17.298]  The latest thing being pushed by the Globals in Hollywood is their official corporate message brought to you literally by Pfizer.
[00:08:17.298 --> 00:08:21.440]  But will you print me out the lyrics to this particular song?
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:31.166]  And there were other satanic songs and rituals conducted last night for the audience that was tuning in.
[00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:34.347]  Now, the Grammys has gotten record low ratings the last 15 years.
[00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.288]  It goes down every year.
[00:08:35.288 --> 00:08:37.129]  A rerun
[00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:51.376]  Of the Simpsons gets more views, but they're now pleading with their ghost dance to their God to make themselves relevant again.
[00:08:51.376 --> 00:08:53.577]  Remember who sits at the top of this?
[00:08:53.577 --> 00:09:05.003]  A bunch of people like Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein, and they are flaunting this in your face.
[00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:05.884]  And in Hollywood,
[00:09:09.554 --> 00:09:13.257]  The main camp is satanic pedophiles.
[00:09:36.172 --> 00:09:41.637]  Now this is only the outward coming out by these people.
[00:09:56.041 --> 00:10:10.573]  Guys, pull up the B-roll of Drag Queen Pedophile Time around the country, where the men dress like satanic clowns and say, we are women, we're stealing your identity, we're saying a woman is a fat clown, and we're going to groom your children, and we want access to your children, and no one will stop us.
[00:10:10.573 --> 00:10:19.059]  Or the San Francisco gay choir saying, we're coming for your small children, we're going to take them, we're going to teach them, you'll never stop us, and then you'll finally join us.
[00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:23.523]  And they all look completely psychotic, because this is a spirit
[00:10:25.219 --> 00:10:31.404]  Ladies and gentlemen, and these folks have signed onto it big time.
[00:10:31.404 --> 00:10:36.808]  Remember the kids cartoon?
[00:10:36.808 --> 00:10:39.130]  Blue's Clues?
[00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:47.677]  It's a big fat man dressed like a clown with Bath-O-Mat and Moloch in the background.
[00:10:47.677 --> 00:10:51.941]  And the children are riding on a float at a parade that is
[00:10:53.723 --> 00:11:06.849]  Moloch, the bull that children would be thrown onto with a burning fire.
[00:11:06.849 --> 00:11:13.993]  Here's the words to the song by Sam Smith and Kim Petras.
[00:11:13.993 --> 00:11:17.474]  It's called Unholy.
[00:11:17.474 --> 00:11:22.557]  Mommy don't know daddy's getting hot at the body shop doing something unholy.
[00:11:23.632 --> 00:11:26.673]  He like it, he like it, yeah, he like it, he like it, yeah.
[00:11:26.673 --> 00:11:30.673]  A lucky, lucky girl, she got married to a boy like you.
[00:11:30.673 --> 00:11:37.614]  She'd kick you out if she ever, ever about all that you tell me that you do, dirty, dirty boy.
[00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:41.015]  You know everyone is talking on the scene.
[00:11:41.015 --> 00:11:47.256]  I hear them whisper about the places that you've been and how you don't know how to keep your business clean.
[00:11:47.256 --> 00:11:52.277]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:11:55.011 --> 00:11:59.032]  And again, this is a bunch of slaves, these are a bunch of twits.
[00:11:59.032 --> 00:12:10.394]  They're doing what they're told, and they're putting out the message, literally every break when they went to break, brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:12:10.394 --> 00:12:13.814]  What does that tell you about Pfizer?
[00:12:13.814 --> 00:12:19.135]  Well, you think dancing around in devil outfits is cool, and that's how I've always described it.
[00:12:19.135 --> 00:12:22.456]  They sell Satanism as cool by a bunch of hot devil cheerleaders.
[00:12:24.415 --> 00:12:31.918]  In close-fitting latex with devil horns.
[00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:35.460]  That's how I've described it for decades, how they sell Satanism.
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:52.888]  But when you actually really get into it, it's wars, and famine, and calamities, and starving, and dead children, and absolute pain, and distrust, and just an age of destruction.
[00:12:55.342 --> 00:12:57.443]  So here's what's really satanic.
[00:12:57.443 --> 00:13:05.187]  World Health Organization, pandemic treaty, a fresh push for vaccine passports, global surveillance, and more.
[00:13:05.187 --> 00:13:07.668]  Here's the actual treaty.
[00:13:07.668 --> 00:13:18.934]  Censoring you, controlling you, tracking you, taking over your body, and giving you something absolutely linked to heart attacks, cancer, strokes, you name it.
[00:13:18.934 --> 00:13:21.055]  Here's Bloomberg.
[00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:22.836]  It's all coming out.
[00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:23.977]  This just came out.
[00:13:24.813 --> 00:13:38.799]  Yesterday, COVID-19 vaccines and strokes, Pfizer's risk data, show that it has been linked to increasing strokes.
[00:13:38.799 --> 00:13:44.481]  Now the CDC knew that before they even rolled it out in October of 2000.
[00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:48.043]  But now they're even telling you and rubbing it in.
[00:13:48.043 --> 00:13:51.264]  Millions and millions of dead worldwide, tens of millions sick.
[00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:54.527]  And it's just, oh, guess what?
[00:13:54.527 --> 00:13:56.969]  They knew.
[00:13:56.969 --> 00:14:02.974]  Who releases International Pandemic Treaty Zero Draft that targets misinformation and disinformation?
[00:14:02.974 --> 00:14:06.617]  And I have the head of the WHO saying their main mission is silencing us.
[00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:09.998]  Boy, that's so liberal!
[00:14:09.998 --> 00:14:28.586]  Big party with a bunch of naked girls and a guy in a top hat laughing and he's got horns telling you, I'm a predator and I rule you and you better roll over because young people will go into Stockholm Syndrome watching this and think that in culture and in life these are the leaders we need to follow.
[00:14:28.586 --> 00:14:36.229]  You think a guy with women in cages with red horns telling you he's a predator is a good person to run your life?
[00:14:36.229 --> 00:14:38.170]  You think that's a good person to be your daddy?
[00:14:41.974 --> 00:14:43.975]  The suicides off the charts.
[00:14:43.975 --> 00:14:46.617]  The depressions off the charts.
[00:14:46.617 --> 00:14:47.558]  In these groups.
[00:14:47.558 --> 00:14:54.823]  These are mind control organizations where they brand the women.
[00:14:54.823 --> 00:14:57.645]  Where they make them starve themselves to death.
[00:14:57.645 --> 00:14:59.366]  And commit suicide as a sacrifice.
[00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:06.411]  Remember Ed Buck and the black men and the stuff he was doing to them?
[00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:08.653]  These people mean business.
[00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:18.523]  And they've sold out to the destruction of our civilization.
[00:15:18.523 --> 00:15:20.364]  And they are cutting off our resources.
[00:15:20.364 --> 00:15:23.166]  They are destroying our morals.
[00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:27.470]  They are coming after everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.072]  These people are all completely lost.
[00:15:30.072 --> 00:15:34.576]  They're all trying to act powerful and act dark and act mean.
[00:15:34.576 --> 00:15:35.937]  But what they are is slaves.
[00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:43.019]  We've got a lot more coming up.
[00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:47.021]  You don't want to miss this broadcast.
[00:15:47.021 --> 00:15:49.303]  Wait till we play this next Bill Gates clip.
[00:15:49.303 --> 00:15:49.803]  This is new.
[00:15:49.803 --> 00:15:52.464]  You want to know who one of the top Satanists is?
[00:15:52.464 --> 00:15:54.005]  He is a devil worshipper.
[00:15:54.005 --> 00:15:55.206]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:55.206 --> 00:16:00.808]  The Real Deal.
[00:16:00.808 --> 00:16:03.470]  I just want to say about Diet Force.
[00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.311]  Diet Force is amazing.
[00:16:05.311 --> 00:16:07.572]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[00:16:07.572 --> 00:16:09.993]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[00:16:10.902 --> 00:16:13.485]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[00:16:13.485 --> 00:16:19.832]  Like, under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking Diet Force two tablets a day.
[00:16:19.832 --> 00:16:22.055]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[00:16:23.214 --> 00:16:25.495]  Like, chip shake for the ladies.
[00:16:25.495 --> 00:16:28.236]  Mate, DietForce is the go.
[00:16:28.236 --> 00:16:31.137]  You have to get the DietForce and have it to a day.
[00:16:31.137 --> 00:16:32.898]  And just keep at it.

[00:17:11.908 --> 00:17:16.050]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.

[00:17:20.612 --> 00:17:25.254]  The bad news is, the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[00:17:25.254 --> 00:17:27.275]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.

[00:17:51.691 --> 00:17:52.651]  I thank you for your support.

[00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:56.614]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action.
[00:18:00.191 --> 00:18:12.722]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:25.746]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[00:18:25.746 --> 00:18:37.596]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[00:18:37.596 --> 00:18:39.117]  This is why they attack us.
[00:18:39.597 --> 00:18:42.140]  This is why we need your support.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.922]  Because we tell the truth.
[00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:46.125]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.566]  Join the resistance.
[00:18:47.566 --> 00:18:48.868]  Buy products.
[00:18:48.868 --> 00:18:50.670]  Donate to the cause.
[00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.031]  Share the links.
[00:18:52.031 --> 00:18:54.454]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[00:18:54.454 --> 00:18:56.657]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[00:19:00.054 --> 00:19:12.679]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[00:19:12.679 --> 00:19:15.901]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:18.983]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[00:19:18.983 --> 00:19:26.569]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support, because the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[00:19:26.569 --> 00:19:35.395]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[00:19:35.395 --> 00:19:41.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.520]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:50.782]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[00:19:50.782 --> 00:19:52.182]  It is all in your hands.
[00:19:52.182 --> 00:19:53.543]  So thanks for your support.
[00:19:53.543 --> 00:19:54.723]  Stand up against the globalists.
[00:19:54.723 --> 00:19:58.004]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[00:19:58.004 --> 00:20:01.745]  It's up to you.
[00:20:01.745 --> 00:20:07.666]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:17.435 --> 00:20:20.958]  Go to the land that's far away.
[00:20:34.397 --> 00:21:00.245]  The soulless minions of Hollywood are nothing but the fangs of the snake who inject the psychic spiritual poison into our veins.
[00:21:03.675 --> 00:21:08.757]  And now they don't just inject the psychic venom.
[00:21:08.757 --> 00:21:14.939]  They inject the spike protein of the HIV virus into us.
[00:21:14.939 --> 00:21:24.123]  And watch us die by the tens of millions.
[00:21:24.123 --> 00:21:26.804]  But Hollywood is dying.
[00:21:26.804 --> 00:21:32.306]  The New World Order, even as it tries to get up on its feet, is failing.
[00:21:37.409 --> 00:22:03.831]  And literally after the satanic ritual flashed on screen at the Grammys, brought to you by Pfizer, taking the image of beautiful dancer women conducting a voodoo ritual, having the women worship fat men, claiming that they're women and showing this to the world is an abomination.
[00:22:08.755 --> 00:22:12.217]  God gave us those beautiful women.
[00:22:12.217 --> 00:22:18.002]  God gave us the children and the green earth, the blue seas and the dark skies.
[00:22:18.002 --> 00:22:19.803]  Not this.
[00:22:19.803 --> 00:22:30.510]  This will bring you poverty and pain and destruction.
[00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.592]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:22:34.144 --> 00:22:36.687]  You're a radio listener and I want you to hear it, so with audio.
[00:22:36.687 --> 00:22:39.191]  Play the last little part here as I go out to break.
[00:23:07.587 --> 00:23:09.468]  Now, if you're a radio listener, I'll describe it for you.
[00:23:09.468 --> 00:23:16.173]  He's conjured as a devil that comes up out of the ground, has the voodoo dancers around him.
[00:23:16.173 --> 00:23:24.219]  Then when it's time for him to leave, they get in a circle and push him back into hell.
[00:23:24.219 --> 00:23:27.781]  And all of this is archetypes.
[00:23:27.781 --> 00:23:29.643]  Open up your subconscious mind to this.
[00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:35.873]  When your subconscious mind sees this, it knows that it's in grave danger.
[00:23:35.873 --> 00:23:43.818]  And if you're not conscious of it, you then go into a form of Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:23:43.818 --> 00:23:45.699]  All this is, is like an anglerfish.
[00:23:45.699 --> 00:23:51.923]  It has a glowing light on a little tentacle on the front of its head, 5,000 feet under the ocean.
[00:23:51.923 --> 00:23:53.864]  And little fish swim up, thinking it's something to eat.
[00:23:53.864 --> 00:23:55.565]  Then they get eaten.
[00:23:55.565 --> 00:23:58.047]  So it dangles the image of beautiful women out in front of you.
[00:23:59.224 --> 00:24:02.865]  And then tells you, don't worry about those red horns, those red teeth.
[00:24:02.865 --> 00:24:06.306]  Come closer.
[00:24:06.306 --> 00:24:08.866]  We will fulfill you.
[00:24:08.866 --> 00:24:20.609]  Because God has laws, a natural law in the universe, and you've got to be shown in the fine print of what they are and who they are and how they're going to enslave you.
[00:24:20.609 --> 00:24:26.291]  You've got to be given a chance to reject this.
[00:24:26.291 --> 00:24:27.391]  And that's why they do this.
[00:24:30.506 --> 00:24:32.187]  But they should know.
[00:24:32.187 --> 00:24:42.536]  People ask all the time on the street, why do you have a skull and an armor-piercing dagger and angel wings on a table in your studio?
[00:24:42.536 --> 00:24:55.588]  And I was studying ancient symbols and I was studying the book of Exodus and other books of the Bible and descriptions of the angel of death.
[00:24:57.401 --> 00:25:00.647]  The Angel of Death isn't really described like a Grim Reaper.
[00:25:00.647 --> 00:25:05.956]  That started back in the Black Plague in Europe, mainly in Italy is where you first see the Grim Reaper pop up.
[00:25:06.977 --> 00:25:15.223]  This archetype is actually the symbol of the angel of death that is not in Satan's army but is in God's army.
[00:25:15.223 --> 00:25:24.649]  So that is a symbol to remind me of how short life is and that we are eternal beings and I cannot fear those that can kill my body but he that can kill my soul.
[00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:27.051]  So there is real power on that desk.
[00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:29.973]  Not power I control, not power I wield.
[00:25:29.973 --> 00:25:35.717]  A reminder to the Satanist every day what was carved for thousands of years on Christians' tombstones
[00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:39.410]  Was not even the cross, but that.
[00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:44.873]  The winged skull.
[00:25:44.873 --> 00:25:49.195]  That is the real power.
[00:25:49.195 --> 00:25:52.157]  God gave us life, God gave us death.
[00:25:52.157 --> 00:26:01.662]  These Satanists fear death so much, and they want to take as many of us with them as they can.
[00:26:01.662 --> 00:26:03.063]  So there you have the cross,
[00:26:04.107 --> 00:26:27.653]  The skull and the reminder that we are eternal beings and that though life is transitory in this body, the angel of death is a deliverer to the faithful and the end for the unfaithful who will be committed to be amongst their own spiritual kind for eternity in something far worse than the Phantom Zone.
[00:26:27.653 --> 00:26:29.734]  So if you want to know where all these devils are going,
[00:26:31.769 --> 00:26:56.999]  That's who's coming for them, not their Satan that they worship and that they bow down to, but the real God of the universe that controls life, the wings, the eternal wings, through all space and time, and of course, the transitory nature of our human bodies and death.
[00:26:56.999 --> 00:26:58.139]  You have to understand, folks,
[00:27:00.657 --> 00:27:09.842]  Whether it's Lady Gaga or whether it is any of these people, they're into Satanism.
[00:27:09.842 --> 00:27:13.464]  And it's what they follow.
[00:27:13.464 --> 00:27:19.587]  Now, a lot of groups and organizations actually get out of it before it's too late.
[00:27:19.587 --> 00:27:27.731]  But when you talk about soulless emptiness, these people are slaves.
[00:27:29.082 --> 00:27:50.427]  And what they're asking their God to do is pass them over because they're going to give innocents, unborn babies, children that are mutilated, children that are put on all these drugs, people that are killed by the shots.
[00:27:50.427 --> 00:27:57.129]  All of these are offerings to their God or like blood they put up of the lambs over
[00:27:59.076 --> 00:28:09.645]  The mantles of their doorways so that the angel of death passes them over.
[00:28:09.645 --> 00:28:13.448]  And so that's all any of this is.
[00:28:13.448 --> 00:28:26.119]  Is giant rituals out in the open of losers that serve an entity that is jealous of mankind, humankind, and wants to destroy us.
[00:28:28.114 --> 00:28:33.876]  Now I'm done talking about this for now because I've got some guests and a lot of key information coming up.
[00:28:33.876 --> 00:28:52.263]  And instead of sitting here and just looking at the outward facsimile of pop Satan, let's talk about real Satan when we come back and actually look at some of his real field marshals and generals and operatives and what they're doing and what real Satanism looks like.
[00:28:52.263 --> 00:28:53.124]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:53.124 --> 00:28:54.564]  InfoWars.com.
[00:28:54.564 --> 00:28:56.485]  Tomorrow's news today, you must know your enemy.
[00:29:00.506 --> 00:29:10.488]  The good news is the Real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.
[00:29:10.488 --> 00:29:14.209]  The bad news is we need a limited run of it, and it's almost sold out.
[00:29:14.209 --> 00:29:16.590]  So, we're in late January when I'm cutting this.
[00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:21.671]  Only seven days left to get the Real Red Pill Plus with all the key ingredients like preglanone and more,
[00:29:22.471 --> 00:29:23.472]  We're good to go.
[00:29:47.543 --> 00:29:51.127]  You need to try the Real Red Pill Plus right now, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[00:29:51.127 --> 00:29:53.069]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[00:29:53.069 --> 00:29:58.375]  Real Red Pill Plus, now available at 50% off at InfoWarStore.com for only a few more days.
[00:30:00.552 --> 00:30:05.075]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[00:30:05.075 --> 00:30:17.524]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[00:30:17.524 --> 00:30:18.725]  These are high-end.
[00:30:18.725 --> 00:30:19.786]  These are the very best.
[00:30:20.106 --> 00:30:22.587]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:23.107]  Well, guess what?
[00:30:23.107 --> 00:30:28.889]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[00:30:28.889 --> 00:30:31.509]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:38.391]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality, full-spectrum CBD.
[00:30:38.391 --> 00:30:43.593]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:43.593 --> 00:30:44.553]  The highest quality.

[00:30:53.647 --> 00:30:55.650]  M4 Wars MD at M4WarsStore.com
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:07.902]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the right reviews.
[00:31:07.902 --> 00:31:18.906]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States, and it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already using.
[00:31:18.906 --> 00:31:27.469]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high quality supplements, and in some cases, even better.
[00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:28.049]  Introducing
[00:31:28.889 --> 00:31:33.472]  InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:33.472 --> 00:31:38.736]  InfoWarsMD exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com has 10 new products.
[00:31:38.736 --> 00:31:46.942]  Turmeric 95, Lipido RX, Better Mood, Nitric Boost, Mushroom Max, Anitropic, Angel's Vitality Collagen,
[00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:50.546]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[00:32:06.804 --> 00:32:15.167]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:17.407]  So I thank you for your passion and support.
[00:32:17.407 --> 00:32:20.908]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin.
[00:32:20.908 --> 00:32:26.330]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time is the Teddy Roosevelt
[00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:31.694]  Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[00:32:31.694 --> 00:32:37.479]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[00:32:37.479 --> 00:32:41.001]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:46.306]  And the coin is a collector's item memento of your support during the Second American Revolution.
[00:32:46.846 --> 00:32:58.211]  So if you want to get one of these coins, they're going fast and you can get $30 off on the coin with promo code 1776 at 1776coin.com.
[00:32:58.211 --> 00:33:01.712]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[00:33:01.712 --> 00:33:07.615]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.618 --> 00:33:31.109]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:40.336]  Jill Biden, the wife of the Chinese Communist pedophile agent, Jill Biden spoke at the satanic Grammys last night.
[00:33:40.336 --> 00:33:41.097]  Now I want to talk about
[00:33:42.659 --> 00:33:53.141]  The real Satanism, destroying our culture, cutting off our resources, attacking our children, injecting us with poison shots, censoring us, surveilling us.
[00:33:53.141 --> 00:34:01.043]  All over TV, all over movies, it's not just messages that men are bad, and families are bad, and children are bad, and that poison shots are good.
[00:34:01.043 --> 00:34:07.064]  Everywhere we see Nicole Kidman, the list goes on and on.
[00:34:07.064 --> 00:34:09.065]  Pushing, eating bugs.
[00:34:10.424 --> 00:34:36.280]  When they have poisonous chitin shells that give you cancer, and you're not designed to eat bugs, and they know that, and Bill Gates is bringing the four artificial meat and bug factories all over the world, and saying he's going to make you eat these, and suddenly it's being put in school lunch products all over the western world.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.441]  Again, their religion
[00:34:38.795 --> 00:34:53.864]  is about dominating you and training you to do disgusting things to yourself because they need you to go against logic and self-harm.
[00:34:53.864 --> 00:35:03.330]  If you're a radio listener, you're blessed because we're showing a woman eat large spider after large spider.
[00:35:06.448 --> 00:35:17.557]  And I can tell you on dares in junior high, I have eaten crickets and stuff, screwing around, and they taste disgusting.
[00:35:17.557 --> 00:35:24.462]  Now that's something a dumb 11-year-old does on a bet for $20.
[00:35:24.462 --> 00:35:27.485]  I can tell you that spider tastes like hell on earth.
[00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:34.231]  Because yes, I didn't just eat crickets a couple times on bets.
[00:35:34.231 --> 00:35:44.519]  One time there was a half-alive tarantula on the ground and I've eaten bugs I think three times and once it was a tarantula and it brings back horrible memories.
[00:35:44.519 --> 00:35:50.903]  When I bit into it, it put off a smell of dead rotten meat that made me throw up for like five minutes.
[00:35:50.903 --> 00:35:54.066]  I mean just the thought of that bug
[00:35:56.434 --> 00:36:01.676]  And I'm admitting stupid stories about myself here, but that's what 11-year-old boys do.
[00:36:01.676 --> 00:36:11.518]  This is a woman, she's so disgusting she can barely control herself in her gag reflex, but she's telling you how good and delicious it is.
[00:36:11.518 --> 00:36:14.579]  Just like Robert Downey Jr.
[00:36:14.579 --> 00:36:16.480]  and everybody else up there saying you will eat the bugs.
[00:36:18.857 --> 00:36:20.659]  It's all about complete degradation.
[00:36:20.659 --> 00:36:27.327]  Here, let's take it full screen and crank up the audio so you can hear the smacking and the gag reflex where she's trying to throw up but forcing it back.
[00:36:27.327 --> 00:36:27.607]  Here it is.
[00:36:41.147 --> 00:36:42.628]  Oh, okay, that's enough.
[00:36:42.628 --> 00:36:45.150]  And I only played that to demonstrate the gag reflex.
[00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:51.433]  Your cells, your body, your genetics knows you're not supposed to eat that.
[00:36:51.433 --> 00:37:00.059]  It's like G. Gordon Liddy was in prison, and he beat up some of the tough guys that thought they could tick his ass, and they interviewed people who were in prison with him.
[00:37:00.059 --> 00:37:02.420]  He didn't lie in his book about it, it was all true.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:08.224]  He didn't just eat one rat, he ate rats on a routine basis in front of people, live, head first.
[00:37:10.014 --> 00:37:15.057]  Now it's one thing to do that to dominate people in a maximum security prison.
[00:37:15.057 --> 00:37:21.961]  As a former military man and FBI agent and CIA operative, which I still wouldn't do that to show people that I had a will.
[00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:26.224]  I don't think I could eat a live rat head first, savoring each bite.
[00:37:26.224 --> 00:37:36.830]  But the fact is they've got Nicole Kibb and everybody else on TV doing this, telling you it's great to just see they can get you to go against your ingrained common sense that God gave you.
[00:37:38.513 --> 00:37:39.714]  And it goes on from there.
[00:37:39.714 --> 00:37:40.634]  Let's play the next clip.
[00:37:40.634 --> 00:37:46.038]  This is Bill Gates.
[00:37:46.038 --> 00:37:50.381]  Backs a startup tracking cow burps and farts.
[00:37:50.381 --> 00:37:54.484]  And he says they're going to feed them a special diet so they don't create methane.
[00:37:54.484 --> 00:37:57.966]  Methane is a warming gas in the atmosphere.
[00:37:57.966 --> 00:38:03.750]  It is directly associated with keeping our atmosphere and is a good gas in our atmosphere.
[00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.331]  And we've always had bovine
[00:38:06.883 --> 00:38:19.448]  All over the continents, including the Arctic, and Buffalo here in North America, another species of buffalo all over Africa and Asia, by the millions.
[00:38:19.448 --> 00:38:22.069]  And they put off the exact same methane.
[00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:24.811]  But they list methane as bad, and they make it toxic.
[00:38:24.811 --> 00:38:28.052]  You know who else puts off methane?
[00:38:28.052 --> 00:38:30.593]  You know what comes out of your rear end, right?
[00:38:30.593 --> 00:38:32.854]  A lot of it's methane.
[00:38:32.854 --> 00:38:34.575]  So they're saying something
[00:38:35.609 --> 00:38:37.951]  That is, part of you, part of life is bad.
[00:38:37.951 --> 00:38:42.994]  And by listing life as bad, they can now surveil it, and control it, and go after it.
[00:38:42.994 --> 00:38:56.163]  But don't worry, he's got startup companies getting government money from Australia to the US, from Germany to Canada, with billions of dollars of taxpayer money he got through Green Deals, to roll out these industries.
[00:38:56.163 --> 00:39:02.908]  And that's why you see in Canada, they're making them kill a large part of their herd.
[00:39:02.908 --> 00:39:03.809]  Same thing in the Netherlands.
[00:39:05.011 --> 00:39:10.773]  They are cutting off the resources and saying you will eat the bugs.
[00:39:10.773 --> 00:39:12.813]  Again, that's real Satanism.
[00:39:12.813 --> 00:39:13.894]  Destroying healthy foods.
[00:39:13.894 --> 00:39:15.474]  Destroying prosperity.
[00:39:15.474 --> 00:39:16.675]  Destroying small farmers.
[00:39:16.675 --> 00:39:18.295]  And it's not coming, it's here.
[00:39:18.295 --> 00:39:18.855]  Here's Bill Gates.
[00:39:27.992 --> 00:39:28.232]  I think
[00:39:45.845 --> 00:39:49.508]  Be so much a source of methane emissions.
[00:39:49.508 --> 00:39:51.870]  So we have two paths to solving that.
[00:39:51.870 --> 00:40:01.158]  That's 6% of global emissions are cows who burp and fart methane to an extreme degree.
[00:40:01.158 --> 00:40:04.922]  You can either fix the cows to stop them doing that, or you can make beef.
[00:40:06.382 --> 00:40:23.967]  Here he is, self-appointed, lying in every word.
[00:40:23.967 --> 00:40:26.587]  Oh, then we can just make the beef.
[00:40:26.587 --> 00:40:27.287]  No, it's not beef.
[00:40:27.287 --> 00:40:32.489]  It's artificial garbage you're going to grow that no one wants, that you can control what's in it.
[00:40:32.489 --> 00:40:33.989]  And he wants to put spike protein in beef.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.181]  You've got to stand up against these people.
[00:40:38.181 --> 00:40:42.243]  You've got to realize they're coming for everybody.
[00:40:42.243 --> 00:40:43.904]  Look at these headlines just today.
[00:40:43.904 --> 00:40:53.908]  Great Reset Supermarket Chain Little to Cut Down on Meat Products to Serve Green Agenda.
[00:40:53.908 --> 00:40:56.810]  Farmland Becomes Flashpoint in U.S.-China Relations.
[00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:58.991]  They're blocking China buying farmland across the U.S.
[00:41:00.356 --> 00:41:04.740]  Meanwhile, Bill Gates and the Globals are buying it all up and kicking regular farmers and ranchers off.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:08.904]  This is strategic, it's a takeover, and it's not just China.
[00:41:08.904 --> 00:41:10.225]  Cows are the new coal.
[00:41:10.225 --> 00:41:12.568]  Gotta get rid of them.
[00:41:12.568 --> 00:41:16.712]  Meet the cow fart backpack that wants to fight climate change.
[00:41:16.712 --> 00:41:24.379]  Oh, you can keep your cow, just shove a tube up its rear end, and then gather the methane, pressurize it, and then have it injected into a mine shaft.
[00:41:26.229 --> 00:41:27.869]  None of this is sustainable.
[00:41:27.869 --> 00:41:29.730]  None of this is going to operate.
[00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:31.170]  It's about total control.
[00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:32.570]  Oh, just a month ago, the U.N.
[00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:35.551]  announced their 15-minute Smart Cities Initiative.
[00:41:35.551 --> 00:41:46.953]  Now Canada has nearly 200 cities and towns joined Liberals' Smart City Scheme and promised to block the cars, control everybody, you name it.
[00:41:46.953 --> 00:41:50.514]  And it goes on and on and on with doublespeak.
[00:41:50.514 --> 00:41:54.415]  Hillary Clinton, we need to protect abortion for our grandkids.
[00:41:56.681 --> 00:42:00.743]  You mean we need to kill our grandkids?
[00:42:00.743 --> 00:42:02.483]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:42:02.483 --> 00:42:10.126]  It's an elite revolution against the people of Earth.
[00:42:10.126 --> 00:42:16.629]  Now, when we come back, they are preparing a new type of bank holiday.
[00:42:16.629 --> 00:42:19.590]  It's been tested before, but it's new on a wide scale.
[00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:21.951]  That's bail-ins.
[00:42:21.951 --> 00:42:22.651]  It's now official.
[00:42:23.817 --> 00:42:26.498]  And we have some very important news articles.
[00:42:26.498 --> 00:42:30.819]  Dealing with that, we're going to be laying out.
[00:42:30.819 --> 00:42:33.280]  Bank of America CEO.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.481]  We're preparing for possible U.S.
[00:42:37.481 --> 00:42:43.842]  debt default.
[00:42:43.842 --> 00:42:47.203]  I have a really fabulous case of bronchitis.
[00:42:51.249 --> 00:42:53.231]  Not willing, I'll be able to complete the show.
[00:42:53.231 --> 00:43:01.719]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:43:01.719 --> 00:43:04.862]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:43:04.862 --> 00:43:07.184]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:43:07.184 --> 00:43:11.108]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:43:11.108 --> 00:43:15.052]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:43:16.485 --> 00:43:20.030]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:26.919]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[00:43:26.919 --> 00:43:27.840]  It's really just incredible.
[00:43:28.852 --> 00:43:31.734]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:38.278]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:43:38.278 --> 00:43:49.546]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:43:50.146 --> 00:43:54.548]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at m4store.com.
[00:43:54.548 --> 00:43:59.490]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:00.531]  Please take action now.
[00:44:00.531 --> 00:44:03.752]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[00:44:03.752 --> 00:44:08.074]  If we're so stupid, we let them tell us we deserve it.
[00:44:08.074 --> 00:44:13.657]  Except, children don't deserve it, do they?
[00:44:13.657 --> 00:44:15.118]  And I looked.
[00:44:17.562 --> 00:44:33.635]  And behold, a pale horse, and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[00:44:33.635 --> 00:44:43.343]  Now the translation is, I looked, and behold a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.
[00:44:43.343 --> 00:44:45.425]  The book of Revelation.
[00:44:47.475 --> 00:44:49.136]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[00:44:49.136 --> 00:44:50.837]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[00:44:50.837 --> 00:44:52.418]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[00:44:52.418 --> 00:44:53.779]  This is our fight.
[00:44:53.779 --> 00:44:55.120]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.581]  The Globalists even admit it's leaked.
[00:44:56.581 --> 00:45:00.644]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[00:45:00.644 --> 00:45:02.485]  Infowars is winning.
[00:45:02.485 --> 00:45:04.526]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[00:45:04.526 --> 00:45:07.308]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[00:45:07.308 --> 00:45:10.050]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:12.151]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[00:45:12.151 --> 00:45:14.213]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[00:45:14.213 --> 00:45:15.193]  None of that's true.
[00:45:15.193 --> 00:45:16.094]  It's all being appealed.
[00:45:16.554 --> 00:45:25.517]  They want you to think Infowars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support Infowars, we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[00:45:25.517 --> 00:45:28.958]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[00:45:28.958 --> 00:45:31.659]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[00:45:31.659 --> 00:45:41.543]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the Infowars and empower your life and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[00:45:42.003 --> 00:45:43.384]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[00:45:43.384 --> 00:45:51.868]  Take action at InfoWarsTore.com today, because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:45:51.868 --> 00:45:55.250]  The majority of you have not been signed off, but some of you have.
[00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:57.031]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[00:45:57.031 --> 00:45:58.952]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[00:46:00.973 --> 00:46:08.639]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing Infowars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[00:46:08.639 --> 00:46:10.701]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:12.422]  They know we're telling the truth.
[00:46:12.422 --> 00:46:13.983]  They know we've got their number.
[00:46:13.983 --> 00:46:18.707]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[00:46:18.707 --> 00:46:21.309]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds.
[00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:22.469]  We're good to go.
[00:46:37.967 --> 00:46:38.267]  Thank you.
[00:47:01.693 --> 00:47:20.321]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:20.321 --> 00:47:27.344]  We haven't had a case of bronchitis in a long time, but my five-year-old daughter got it during the swim team, and then I gave it to my wife.
[00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:29.105]  Now, I got it a few days ago.
[00:47:29.105 --> 00:47:30.886]  I'm sitting here during the break, and I go, wait a minute.
[00:47:32.338 --> 00:47:34.580]  I'm coughing, it itches, it hurts.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:35.821]  Lung Cleanze!
[00:47:35.821 --> 00:47:37.923]  Which is one of our great products at Enforcer.com.
[00:47:37.923 --> 00:47:39.764]  The crew's like, yeah, there's some over here on your desk.
[00:47:39.764 --> 00:47:41.446]  They went and got it.
[00:47:41.446 --> 00:47:44.208]  Boom.
[00:47:44.208 --> 00:47:44.848]  Massive relief.
[00:47:45.916 --> 00:47:47.917]  Because it's pure essential oils.
[00:47:47.917 --> 00:47:50.998]  It's not just a couple of essential oils in water.
[00:47:50.998 --> 00:47:58.980]  The only problem is you've got to, if you haven't used it in a while, take the top off, run it under hot water to clean out the sprayer because it's so thick it gets clogged up.
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.241]  There's no fillers in this.
[00:48:00.241 --> 00:48:01.821]  It is so powerful.
[00:48:01.821 --> 00:48:08.404]  And that's why InfoWareStore.com is amazing because it gives you products that empower and enrich your life and fund this operation a 360 win.
[00:48:10.745 --> 00:48:12.447]  I was nothing in a lung cleanse.
[00:48:12.447 --> 00:48:22.356]  It literally just knocked out 90% of the itchiness and pain down in my bronchioles with just one application during the break.
[00:48:22.356 --> 00:48:24.218]  Now I don't feel like I've got to cough every five seconds.
[00:48:24.218 --> 00:48:26.320]  InfoWareStore.com, an amazing product.
[00:48:27.446 --> 00:48:31.590]  All right, so the globalists want to get rid of the majority of the populace.
[00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:39.437]  And to do that, they've got to train us to be envious, stupid, uneducated, uninformed, and basically lay down and die.
[00:48:39.437 --> 00:48:46.804]  And so they're just flooding the zone with Satanism and pedophilia and corruption and decadence and lies.
[00:48:46.804 --> 00:48:49.106]  And they're getting ready to get rid of the old financial system.
[00:48:50.359 --> 00:48:59.202]  And bring in their new hellish system that tracks everywhere you go, what you do, and controls what you can buy and what you can sell.
[00:48:59.202 --> 00:49:06.145]  And under the ESGs and the central bank digital currencies, you'll only be able to buy synthetic meat.
[00:49:06.145 --> 00:49:13.227]  You'll only be able to buy cricket flour that isn't flour, that's toxic chitin protein.
[00:49:15.287 --> 00:49:25.278]  This is just insane how they're creating this poison environment with 5G and everything else around us and we have to reject this sick, evil culture.
[00:49:25.278 --> 00:49:31.665]  But that's why out of the gates it says two men can have a baby and we're going to let convicted pedophiles have access to your children dressed up in clown outfits.
[00:49:31.665 --> 00:49:34.529]  Because if they can get away with letting men compete in women's sports,
[00:49:35.902 --> 00:49:37.505]  And everything else, what's next?
[00:49:37.505 --> 00:49:42.013]  More insanity, more murder of logic, more things that no one would ever accept.
[00:49:42.013 --> 00:49:45.359]  But they need to get you to accept it because it's their agenda.
[00:49:46.846 --> 00:49:52.871]  So about a month ago we played a clip from the FDIC saying they're getting ready for bail-ins and it will happen.
[00:49:52.871 --> 00:49:54.853]  That's where they just grab part of your bank account.
[00:49:54.853 --> 00:49:57.035]  Then Greg Reif sent a report on it that went super viral.
[00:49:57.035 --> 00:49:58.917]  He sent a new report on it.
[00:49:58.917 --> 00:50:01.799]  Then I saw news articles today talking about it.
[00:50:01.799 --> 00:50:05.783]  Bank of America's CEO, we're preparing for possible U.S.
[00:50:05.783 --> 00:50:07.605]  debt default.
[00:50:07.605 --> 00:50:10.547]  And when they go deeper into the article from CNN.com,
[00:50:11.431 --> 00:50:15.392]  They talk about having to basically grab money out of your bank accounts.
[00:50:15.392 --> 00:50:20.894]  There's a bunch of articles dealing with this, but this is the next level of the control.
[00:50:20.894 --> 00:50:23.194]  Here's a story that ties into it from Fox News.
[00:50:23.194 --> 00:50:30.156]  Migrants flee New York City for Canada after drugs, homelessness, people make life unbearable.
[00:50:30.156 --> 00:50:30.856]  So the U.S.
[00:50:30.856 --> 00:50:35.778]  is really more and more becoming unlivable in many, many areas.
[00:50:35.778 --> 00:50:36.318]  So here is
[00:50:37.665 --> 00:50:40.047]  Gregg Reese's report dealing with this.
[00:50:40.047 --> 00:50:42.108]  It's on Band.Video.
[00:50:42.108 --> 00:50:44.890]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:48.913]  European Central Bank preparing for bail-ins and banking collapse.
[00:50:48.913 --> 00:50:54.117]  I'm going to have this video reposted onto the live show feed of the broadcast today.
[00:50:54.117 --> 00:50:55.238]  It's very, very important here it is.
[00:51:02.586 --> 00:51:16.436]  After publishing my video report on bank bail-ins, a contractor for the European Central Bank, who asked that his name be withheld for security reasons, contacted me with the following information.
[00:51:16.436 --> 00:51:29.045]  Shortly after the FDIC meeting that went viral, my source was assigned an urgent project related to bail-in capability for the European Central Bank, or ECB.
[00:51:29.845 --> 00:51:38.758]  Bail-ins is when the bank steals money directly from people's accounts, just like we saw in Cyprus in 2013.
[00:51:38.758 --> 00:51:44.646]  The project goal is to build a data infrastructure for the financial market infrastructures
[00:51:45.086 --> 00:52:02.329]  Which are the networks that allow financial transactions to take place to report to the ECB about the capability of banks and capital markets to absorb losses and to execute bail-ins as quickly and efficiently as possible.
[00:52:02.329 --> 00:52:12.491]  This urgent project makes it clear that the ECB is expecting a system collapse and that they know it is uncontrollable and unforeseeable.
[00:52:13.274 --> 00:52:20.478]  The current security requirements do not legally compel the banks to provide information to the ECB.
[00:52:20.478 --> 00:52:25.080]  If a bank is insolvent, they have no incentive to tell the ECB.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:34.725]  And so the ECB is not targeting banks directly, but rather financial intermediaries like SWIFT and large settlement houses.
[00:52:35.425 --> 00:52:45.155]  The purpose of this contractor's job is to provide a way for the ECB to pinpoint which banks are insolvent and where the collapse will stem from.
[00:52:45.155 --> 00:52:54.003]  This is being done by creating large data lakes which an engineer can analyze and find meaning at a graphical level.
[00:52:54.003 --> 00:52:59.529]  How much bail-ins each bank has to execute and how much of a loss they can take.
[00:53:00.229 --> 00:53:08.216]  This is evidence that the ECB is definitely planning on bail-ins as a means of surviving an imminent collapse.
[00:53:08.216 --> 00:53:15.303]  And when this occurs, we can expect multiple banks to close and stock markets around the world to shut down.
[00:53:16.003 --> 00:53:20.948]  As the banks steal as much money from the people as they deem necessary.
[00:53:20.948 --> 00:53:36.785]  Most of this work is being done in private, but there are pieces of information available to the public on the EU's SRB website, including operational guidance on bail-in implementation and the operational guidance on bail-in playbooks.
[00:53:37.425 --> 00:54:04.202]  The ECB contractor has also pointed out that the latest directives for the European Union's digital service providers states that governments shall appoint trusted bodies for internet domain registry, meaning that the government will have the sole authority on who is able to have a website, and that these new security directives allow a gaping hole for a major cyber attack, which official commentators are ignoring.
[00:54:05.111 --> 00:54:11.593]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:54:11.593 --> 00:54:34.361]  Alright, if you go back about two and a half years ago, I told you that after they phase out the forced injections for now, they'll then bring in climate lockdowns, an economic collapse, and the rollout of the digital currency, and they war game it, they talk about it, we've covered it on air, that they'll say, oh, there's been a cyber attack, or oh, there's a global insolvency in the banks, or a mix of those, and
[00:54:35.322 --> 00:54:36.723]  Your money is safe in the bank.
[00:54:36.723 --> 00:54:39.024]  We've only got to take 20-30% of it.
[00:54:39.024 --> 00:54:42.306]  A computer's going to decide, so no human did it, so it's okay.
[00:54:42.306 --> 00:54:44.047]  You know that's programmed by them.
[00:54:44.047 --> 00:54:54.172]  And your money will be bailed into this new global system that will sure up the stock markets, and you'll have this new digital currency that we control, but you'll get some of your money back.
[00:54:54.172 --> 00:54:56.393]  If you don't, you'll get none of it.
[00:54:56.393 --> 00:55:00.775]  So they're going to hold everybody hostage, and it could be a month away, it could be a year away.
[00:55:00.775 --> 00:55:03.197]  If there's enough political pressure, they'll have to back off.
[00:55:04.099 --> 00:55:07.060]  But this is life and death situations here.
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.162]  People ask me all the time, how do you handle the attacks?
[00:55:09.162 --> 00:55:12.563]  How do you handle thousands of articles a week lying about you in hundreds of TV programs?
[00:55:12.563 --> 00:55:14.184]  How do you handle it?
[00:55:14.184 --> 00:55:16.085]  We're all in the same boat together.
[00:55:16.085 --> 00:55:19.807]  My personal problems are small compared to all of our collective problems, okay?
[00:55:20.523 --> 00:55:26.228]  They don't even, it's like having a scratch on your finger compared to your leg being chopped off.
[00:55:26.228 --> 00:55:26.748]  Okay?
[00:55:26.748 --> 00:55:30.311]  We need to put a tourniquet on this now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:30.311 --> 00:55:38.978]  Now Mike Lindell is a great patriot and has been through hell, and every time he goes on Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Kimmel tries to destroy him, but he comes out on top.
[00:55:40.871 --> 00:55:46.758]  And so, he went on Jimmy Kimmel and Kimmel had him sit there in one of those claw machines.
[00:55:46.758 --> 00:55:49.581]  And I get why Lindell did it, he played along with it.
[00:55:49.581 --> 00:55:57.749]  But Lindell's going to join us, talk about the waterfront, the oceanfront, what's happening in politics, the world, election fraud, new world order, next hour.
[00:55:57.749 --> 00:56:01.574]  I always like talking to Mike, so we appreciate him coming on.
[00:56:02.955 --> 00:56:03.455]  Joining us.
[00:56:03.455 --> 00:56:06.916]  But this is what the system does to make us look stupid.
[00:56:06.916 --> 00:56:09.416]  But Mike's got such good sense of humor.
[00:56:09.416 --> 00:56:15.838]  Both times he's gone on, almost everybody agrees that he basically wins the discussion.
[00:56:15.838 --> 00:56:18.938]  So I hope he'll rise the occasion like he does on those shows here.
[00:56:18.938 --> 00:56:21.739]  He's pretty good on my show, but he's kind of mailing it in.
[00:56:21.739 --> 00:56:26.440]  But he does really, really good when he's on one of these other channels under the pressure.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.080]  So we look forward to talking to Mike Lindell.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:34.342]  Roger Stone had the government lawsuit against him for running January 6th dropped, because that was all a fraud.
[00:56:34.342 --> 00:56:45.307]  We're going to touch on that, but the political prisoners and more, but also politics, Trump, DeSantis 2024, and a lot of other really important inside scoop information in the third hour.
[00:56:45.307 --> 00:56:51.629]  And then tonight, tonight, 7 to 9.
[00:56:51.629 --> 00:56:54.270]  No, we're going to do it.
[00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:58.432]  We're going to do it 6 to 6 to 8, right after Owen's show ends over at
[00:56:59.901 --> 00:57:12.508]  InfoWars spinoff, it's not part of InfoWars, AlexJonesLive.com.
[00:57:12.508 --> 00:57:18.331]  And if folks are asking what AlexJonesLive.com is, well, I'll describe it and break it down tonight.
[00:57:18.331 --> 00:57:21.693]  And the site you see is not going to be the site it's going to be very, very soon.
[00:57:21.693 --> 00:57:23.374]  This is just a basic platform right now.
[00:57:23.374 --> 00:57:25.475]  The new site's actually ready, but I have to
[00:57:27.117 --> 00:57:32.360]  I am shooting videos and PowerPoints and a bunch of special reports and things that are propagating the new site.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:35.943]  I'm still going to be at InfoWars, still going to be on Free Speech, still going to do this show every day.
[00:57:35.943 --> 00:57:41.086]  It's just that I promise you more shows are getting launched, and this one is commercial-free.
[00:57:41.086 --> 00:57:46.929]  So that'll be 6 o'clock tonight, right when the War Room ends, and it'll be simulcast over here on InfoWars as well.
[00:57:46.929 --> 00:57:47.450]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:47.790]  Stay with us.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.982]  Cavalry has arrived.
[00:57:52.982 --> 00:58:06.410]  Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken based bone broth you're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart, but more importantly, your immune system.
[00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:08.671]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[00:58:08.671 --> 00:58:13.755]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with chaga mushroom and
[00:58:14.335 --> 00:58:17.799]  A whole bunch of other ingredients, like turmeric, the list goes on and on.

[00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:54.474]  The second American revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[00:58:55.114 --> 00:59:00.320]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:05.185]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[00:59:05.185 --> 00:59:10.131]  Now in the last year we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[00:59:10.131 --> 00:59:14.055]  When you buy the coin you know that you are supporting the transmission
[00:59:14.335 --> 00:59:19.640]  And you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:32.652]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[00:59:32.652 --> 00:59:36.595]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD,
[00:59:37.196 --> 00:59:37.476]  All right.
[01:00:07.552 --> 01:00:08.733]  Mark Dice, I knew.
[01:00:08.733 --> 01:00:15.158]  I hadn't even gone to his site, but I knew he'd have an out-of-the-park analysis of the Grammy's Satanic Ritual.
[01:00:15.158 --> 01:00:17.020]  So we're going to go to that in a moment.
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:25.346]  Then we're going to come back with Mike Lindell, and we're going to cover so many great topics with him and more.
[01:00:25.346 --> 01:00:29.450]  The poison shot, election fraud, you name it.
[01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:34.934]  So this is definitely a transmission that you are not going to want to miss.
[01:00:34.934 --> 01:00:36.896]  Here is the Mark Dice report.
[01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:46.176]  I tried watching the Grammys on Sunday night, but every song sounded like it was written by Chat GPT and performed by someone at karaoke not at the bar.
[01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:52.962]  It was pure noise pollution, pop culture poison, fitting for the United States of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:00:52.962 --> 01:01:04.731]  It started off paying homage to the 30 million illegal aliens who have invaded the United States from Mexico and Central America, with some artists performing a song in their native language.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.506]  His name is Bad Bunny, or Benito something or other.
[01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.108]  I couldn't care less.
[01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:20.431]  But of course he's bisexual.
[01:01:20.831 --> 01:01:22.954]  He dresses up in drag.
[01:01:22.954 --> 01:01:25.737]  He kisses his backup dancers of any gender.
[01:01:25.737 --> 01:01:27.819]  You know, dismantling machismo.
[01:01:27.819 --> 01:01:35.488]  As a queer Latina woman, this is so important to me because he's starting conversations and normalizing inclusivity.
[01:01:35.708 --> 01:01:46.373]  Madonna was rolled out of the retirement home to introduce the first transgender and gender non-binary duo who performed a satanic ritual.
[01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:52.677]  That's Sam Smith, by the way, who no longer identifies as a man or a woman.
[01:01:52.677 --> 01:01:55.798]  He's a non-binary person.
[01:01:55.798 --> 01:01:56.398]  I know.
[01:01:56.398 --> 01:01:57.879]  Don't even get me started.
[01:01:57.879 --> 01:02:03.202]  That ritual was brought to you by Pfizer, by the way, and that's not a joke.
[01:02:04.152 --> 01:02:07.747]  The 65th Grammy Awards is sponsored by Pfizer.
[01:02:09.389 --> 01:02:19.334]  Aside from celebrating Satan, the Grammys also celebrated gluttony, praising singer Lizzo for her body positivity messages.
[01:02:19.334 --> 01:02:26.838]  But at least we now know that the supposed Chinese spy blimp was just her on her way to the Grammys.
[01:02:26.838 --> 01:02:28.819]  So, no need for concern.
[01:02:28.819 --> 01:02:34.922]  And I have no idea what language this person is speaking or what planet he is from.
[01:02:34.922 --> 01:02:36.203]  What is this gibberish?
[01:02:42.948 --> 01:02:46.191]  I think that was Busta Rhymes, but I'm not sure.
[01:02:46.191 --> 01:02:47.572]  I'm too old for this crap.
[01:02:47.572 --> 01:02:54.117]  There was a new category at the Grammys this year, however, a Grammy for black people.
[01:02:54.117 --> 01:03:02.023]  I'm honored to be here to present a brand new award that the Recording Academy is introducing this year in coordination with the Black Music Collective.
[01:03:03.194 --> 01:03:04.775]  Yeah, yeah, it's good.
[01:03:04.775 --> 01:03:12.202]  Now this award will recognize the contributors and creators and professionals with a proven track record of uplifting black music.
[01:03:12.202 --> 01:03:20.189]  Dr. Dre said that he was surprised and read a five-minute prepared speech from the teleprompter.
[01:03:20.489 --> 01:03:26.035]  Now, I'm not saying that black people uplifting other black people isn't a good thing.
[01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:27.256]  It's definitely needed.
[01:03:27.256 --> 01:03:30.239]  Have you seen the black crime statistics in America?
[01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:33.282]  I'm just not sure that it's worthy of a Grammy.
[01:03:33.282 --> 01:03:37.726]  And did you know that LGBTQ people created music?
[01:03:37.726 --> 01:03:40.209]  I'd like to thank the queer community for your love.
[01:03:41.364 --> 01:03:43.765]  And for inventing the genre.
[01:03:43.765 --> 01:03:45.045]  God bless you.
[01:03:45.045 --> 01:03:47.225]  Thank you so much to the Grammys.
[01:03:47.225 --> 01:03:52.847]  That was Beyoncé after she won the Grammy for Best Dance and Electronic Album.
[01:03:52.847 --> 01:03:59.088]  Of course, one of Hollywood's top priorities is trying to normalize same-sex couples raising children.
[01:03:59.088 --> 01:04:07.270]  So, at the Grammys, they had one performer's so-called wife and children introduce her to the audience.
[01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:12.972]  It means the world to me to stand here tonight with our beautiful daughters by my side.
[01:04:12.972 --> 01:04:22.937]  Here to rock our faces off with Broken Horses from her Grammy-nominated album, In These Silent Days, my wife and their mama, Brandi Carlile!
[01:04:25.405 --> 01:04:32.350]  Joe Biden's caretaker, Jill, even made a special appearance, awarding the Grammy for Song of the Year.
[01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:41.596]  Of course, she's not a musician at all, but Hollywood does everything that they can to try to prop up the embarrassing and failing Biden administration.
[01:04:41.596 --> 01:04:50.342]  The only thing missing was President Zelensky from Ukraine, but the Oscars are coming up soon, so I'm sure they'll give him one for something.
[01:04:55.143 --> 01:04:57.624]  All right, the great Mike Lindell in 60 seconds.
[01:04:57.624 --> 01:05:00.125]  Stay with us.

[01:05:32.117 --> 01:05:32.778]  It's amazing.
[01:05:32.778 --> 01:05:38.100]  I learned about it from a research scientist and a medical doctor who had a similar formula five years ago.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:41.222]  We simply made it stronger and we have great reviews from listeners.

[01:05:50.751 --> 01:05:52.673]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[01:05:52.673 --> 01:05:58.002]  Real Redfield Plus, now available at 50% off at InfoWarStore.com for only a few more days.
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:28.564]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:28.564 --> 01:06:31.348]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:06:48.809 --> 01:06:51.290]  Well, I gotta tell ya, I love fighters.
[01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:54.172]  And I love people under pressure that just get stronger.
[01:06:54.172 --> 01:07:00.695]  And that definition really, for me, is Mike Lindell of MyPillow.com and MyStore.com.
[01:07:00.695 --> 01:07:03.497]  A great supporter of free speech, not just here, but around the world.
[01:07:03.497 --> 01:07:11.461]  Battling and exposing the election fraud, totally vindicated, never giving up, exposing the poison shots, just fighting hard.
[01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:12.702]  And the last time he went on Kimmel,
[01:07:13.582 --> 01:07:16.803]  A year and a half ago or so, he just destroyed Kimmel.
[01:07:16.803 --> 01:07:20.525]  Even though Kimmel tried to destroy him, everybody said Lindell did a great job.
[01:07:20.525 --> 01:07:27.308]  Well this time they wanted him to sit there in a carnival or video game arcade claw machine, and I will ask him why he played along with it.
[01:07:27.308 --> 01:07:30.269]  I can't play the whole 10-minute segment, but he did a great job.
[01:07:30.269 --> 01:07:30.809]  Here's part of it.
[01:07:32.057 --> 01:07:36.202]  Colorful, unhinged characters who've come to prominence in the political era of Donald Trump.
[01:07:36.202 --> 01:07:41.789]  Our next guest is probably the most enthusiastic to help him overcome his debilitating fear of machines.
[01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:45.734]  We have installed him inside a claw machine for his interview tonight.
[01:07:45.734 --> 01:07:50.480]  Joining us now from the corner of Donkey Kong and Q-Bert, the MyPillow guy, Mike Lindell!
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:50.680]  Hello, Mike!
[01:07:52.893 --> 01:07:54.935]  Jimmy Crumble, is that you?
[01:07:54.935 --> 01:07:57.377]  It's me.
[01:07:57.377 --> 01:07:58.197]  Well, Mike.
[01:07:58.197 --> 01:08:01.800]  First question, Mike, is why do you think people don't take you seriously?
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.082]  Well, you know, I want to tell you this, Jimmy.
[01:08:04.082 --> 01:08:08.906]  Remember when we were kids and we questioned these carnival games whether they were rigged or not?
[01:08:08.906 --> 01:08:09.987]  Yeah, right.
[01:08:09.987 --> 01:08:14.171]  But when we spoke up back then, we didn't get sued, did we?
[01:08:14.171 --> 01:08:14.871]  No, that's right.
[01:08:14.871 --> 01:08:16.332]  Hey, Mike, get rid of that kid.
[01:08:16.332 --> 01:08:18.194]  Will you give him a toy or something like that?
[01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:18.514]  Here you go.
[01:08:18.514 --> 01:08:19.155]  You got a winner.
[01:08:19.155 --> 01:08:20.076]  It's a rigged game.
[01:08:20.076 --> 01:08:20.856]  It's a rigged game.
[01:08:20.856 --> 01:08:21.637]  It's a rigged game.
[01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:25.482]  Mike, I know that you're distrustful of machines.
[01:08:25.482 --> 01:08:28.405]  Now that you're inside one, do you feel differently?
[01:08:28.405 --> 01:08:29.947]  No, same thing.
[01:08:29.947 --> 01:08:32.711]  Computers can be rigged out there, absolutely, in elections.
[01:08:32.711 --> 01:08:33.632]  You know that.
[01:08:33.632 --> 01:08:37.097]  Did you ask Donald Trump whether you should do this or not?
[01:08:37.097 --> 01:08:38.679]  Do you run this sort of thing by him?
[01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:40.359]  No, I didn't, Jimmy.
[01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:41.320]  I did this all on my own.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:42.320]  I wanted to be on your show.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:47.342]  You, you, you know, you kept telling me to come on, but you, you know, I seen the monologue there.
[01:08:47.342 --> 01:08:51.583]  You said it's because, to put me in here because I was, wasn't vaccinated.
[01:08:51.583 --> 01:08:52.243]  You tricked me.
[01:08:52.243 --> 01:08:54.324]  You did it to be funny, huh?
[01:08:54.324 --> 01:08:55.044]  No, I didn't.
[01:08:55.044 --> 01:08:57.425]  No, I didn't want you in there because you weren't vaccinated.
[01:08:57.425 --> 01:08:58.045]  I don't know.
[01:08:58.045 --> 01:09:00.966]  To be honest, I don't even remember why I decided you should be in there.
[01:09:00.966 --> 01:09:02.126]  No, you said it on your show.
[01:09:02.126 --> 01:09:04.027]  It seemed like a good idea when it happened.
[01:09:04.027 --> 01:09:06.968]  I have to say, I was very surprised when you said- Hey, let's just pause for a minute.
[01:09:07.612 --> 01:09:24.669]  Mike is so good on his feet here and we'll talk to the man himself in a moment but he acts like Mike's in there of his own accord and Mike's like no you asked me to do this but Mike knew he was gonna come back and expose that it's all a carnival fraud and again that's the disingenuousness
[01:09:25.945 --> 01:09:26.225]  Of course.
[01:09:39.783 --> 01:09:45.725]  So you said yes, so I'm honoring that commitment that I made on the air.
[01:09:45.725 --> 01:09:53.987]  So last week, Mike, you, actually during the weekend, you ran for chairman of the Republican National Committee.
[01:09:53.987 --> 01:10:00.369]  This is the committee that is kind of in charge of fundraising, it decides where the money goes, it's a very powerful group.
[01:10:00.689 --> 01:10:00.969]  Correct.
[01:10:00.969 --> 01:10:07.013]  And you seemed, by my count, very confident that you had a chance to win this thing.
[01:10:07.013 --> 01:10:07.833]  Let's look at the tape.
[01:10:07.833 --> 01:10:10.975]  I'm running for chairman of the RNC.
[01:10:10.975 --> 01:10:12.936]  And I plan on winning.
[01:10:12.936 --> 01:10:14.157]  And you know what?
[01:10:14.157 --> 01:10:15.298]  I plan on winning.
[01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:16.979]  I want to win that RNC chair.
[01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:19.520]  We're ahead in every single poll out there.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.161]  I'm 100% all in.
[01:10:21.161 --> 01:10:23.243]  And when I go all in, I go all in to win.
[01:10:23.243 --> 01:10:24.544]  I just want to win, everybody.
[01:10:24.544 --> 01:10:28.586]  Not only am I going to win, but we're going to, it's going to change real fast.
[01:10:28.586 --> 01:10:29.967]  Are you confident that you can win?
[01:10:30.646 --> 01:10:31.467]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:31.467 --> 01:10:33.628]  A lot of them are going, do you think you can win?
[01:10:33.628 --> 01:10:34.789]  Do you think you win?
[01:10:34.789 --> 01:10:36.070]  Of course I'm gonna win!
[01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:39.031]  Mike, some of the polls show you winning this.
[01:10:39.031 --> 01:10:40.532]  Oh yeah, yeah, they all do.
[01:10:40.532 --> 01:10:45.756]  Now Mike, the poll actually did show you as the favorite, right?
[01:10:45.756 --> 01:10:46.917]  The Rasmussen poll.
[01:10:46.917 --> 01:10:48.137]  That's correct, yep.
[01:10:48.137 --> 01:10:50.219]  And then this happened.
[01:10:50.219 --> 01:10:56.943]  Mike Lindell received 4 votes, Harmeet Dhillon received 51 votes, and Ronna McDaniel received 111 votes.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.184]  Now, does this seem like an indication that maybe your barometer when it comes to voting is off?
[01:11:06.184 --> 01:11:08.946]  Alright, so let's stop right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:08.946 --> 01:11:10.407]  Again, he's the man in the arena.
[01:11:10.407 --> 01:11:13.129]  He runs a big network reaching millions of people a day.
[01:11:13.129 --> 01:11:14.009]  He's fighting back.
[01:11:14.009 --> 01:11:17.812]  And then they act like when you're an underdog, it's pathetic that you try to win.
[01:11:17.812 --> 01:11:19.353]  No.
[01:11:19.353 --> 01:11:22.655]  Winners never quit.
[01:11:22.655 --> 01:11:25.997]  And quitters never win, to quote Vince Lombardi.
[01:11:25.997 --> 01:11:27.238]  And so, I've lost
[01:11:28.268 --> 01:11:32.172]  Way more than I've won, but in the aggregate, we've changed the world.
[01:11:32.172 --> 01:11:40.700]  And that George Washington, in a six-year war with the British Empire that had never been defeated, went on to defeat Napoleon a few years later with the biggest army the world had ever seen.
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:45.244]  He lost 95% of his battles, but he persevered.
[01:11:45.244 --> 01:11:46.745]  He's George Washington.
[01:11:47.446 --> 01:11:51.807]  Mike Lindell, you're with us until 45 after, really appreciate you coming on.
[01:11:51.807 --> 01:12:02.030]  But I just wanted to play this because it just shows the deception and the games and just even how they tried to rig the interview to make you look like a fool but you came out smelling like a rose.
[01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:05.572]  The full interview is up on Infowars.com, it's up on Frank's Beach.
[01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:10.093]  But I just wanted to, I saw this and loved it last week and wanted to have you on because you got a lot of balls, brother.
[01:12:12.295 --> 01:12:18.902]  Well, thanks, but even my lawyers warn me, don't go on, Mike, don't go on, you're going to make a fool of yourself.
[01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:19.983]  I go, you know what?
[01:12:19.983 --> 01:12:25.989]  We have to keep getting the word out about to get rid of these computers in our elections and machines.
[01:12:25.989 --> 01:12:29.453]  And what you're missing there, which I called Jimmy out on it,
[01:12:30.194 --> 01:12:38.999]  About when he first brought this up, he said it was about a half a year ago, and we played it over and over after I got done on Jimmy Kimmel the next day.
[01:12:38.999 --> 01:12:50.665]  As he said, Mike wants to come on the show, but in order to be, you have to be vaccinated to get in our building, so we'll have to do it in the claw machine across the street, so I feel safe.
[01:12:51.085 --> 01:12:53.166]  Those were his words, Alex.
[01:12:53.166 --> 01:12:59.229]  And then, so when I said I'd come on, Jimmy spun that around like, like, you know, well, I never said that.
[01:12:59.229 --> 01:13:01.430]  I can't remember why I wanted you in a claw machine.
[01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:05.231]  When I went out there, we had to get, they still wear masks in that building.
[01:13:05.231 --> 01:13:11.854]  They, uh, we had to get this, we had to be tested for the China virus like, uh, uh, the night before, 12 hours earlier.
[01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:14.095]  So I really didn't even believe I would be in the building.
[01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:15.416]  We're good to go.
[01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:37.861]  I was the favorite to win it, by far, over double Harmeet and Ronna McDaniel.
[01:13:37.861 --> 01:13:43.065]  What people don't understand is only 168 people vote on that.
[01:13:43.065 --> 01:13:44.966]  Three from every state.
[01:13:44.966 --> 01:13:50.870]  Alex, the people, when they did the Rasmussen poll, the people of this country, they wanted a businessman.
[01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:58.455]  No, no, no, you won the National Scientific Poll, but the RNC, it's basically rigged by how they're able to select who does it.
[01:13:59.363 --> 01:14:01.984]  Well, they went against the will of the people.
[01:14:01.984 --> 01:14:08.168]  Now, Ronna McDaniel, in her defense, she said, I would look forward to working with Mike Lindell.
[01:14:08.168 --> 01:14:11.710]  Now, she called me on Friday, so we're going to see how that plays out.
[01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:17.373]  Because one of the things that the RNC just completely ignored the last five years...
[01:14:18.193 --> 01:14:21.496]  Is they ignored the election platforms.
[01:14:21.496 --> 01:14:23.757]  You can't ignore the platforms.
[01:14:23.757 --> 01:14:31.543]  And just like they did with it for seven months, their emails, their Gmail's were all going into spam.
[01:14:31.543 --> 01:14:34.545]  And they finally got the, you know, said, hey, we better go after Google.
[01:14:34.545 --> 01:14:34.945]  And they did.
[01:14:34.945 --> 01:14:36.446]  And they got their emails back.
[01:14:36.446 --> 01:14:38.267]  I said to them, that's a computer.
[01:14:38.267 --> 01:14:40.589]  That's a computer Google was using to destroy your
[01:14:40.749 --> 01:14:45.631]  Sure, the idea that we can just trust this system that's been caught lying about everything is preposterous.
[01:14:45.631 --> 01:14:53.674]  And we'll come back and play the next clip you talked about because, I mean, all the people I saw on it, when everybody said you destroyed him, because again, he wanted to act like you demanded to be in a claw machine.
[01:14:53.674 --> 01:14:54.814]  No, that was his idea.
[01:14:54.814 --> 01:14:57.275]  Just every level is deception.
[01:14:57.275 --> 01:14:58.436]  Right.
[01:14:58.436 --> 01:15:01.397]  We're going to break in about 45 seconds, but what else are we going to cover too?
[01:15:01.397 --> 01:15:02.257]  What else is on your radar?
[01:15:03.191 --> 01:15:08.092]  Yeah, well we've got, we've got a, I'm going to tell you all this as long as we're, as long as we're here.
[01:15:08.092 --> 01:15:11.453]  I just, we're going to, this is the MyPillow 2.0.
[01:15:11.453 --> 01:15:13.594]  I want to bring this up because it's so important.
[01:15:13.594 --> 01:15:20.756]  This was developed, this is a thread, a temperature regulating thread we didn't have back when I invented MyPillow.
[01:15:20.756 --> 01:15:24.917]  So I wanted to announce this on your show, Alex, that you can use your promo code.
[01:15:24.917 --> 01:15:28.638]  This is now the best pillow in history, just got better.
[01:15:28.638 --> 01:15:30.378]  And we're doing a buy one, get one free.
[01:15:30.378 --> 01:15:32.419]  My employees are working hard today.
[01:15:32.679 --> 01:15:33.139]  Stay there.
[01:15:33.139 --> 01:15:35.641]  I want to talk about this when we come back first.
[01:15:35.641 --> 01:15:38.542]  And again, folks, it isn't just a great pillow made in America.
[01:15:38.542 --> 01:15:40.623]  It finances the revolution against the New World Order.
[01:15:40.623 --> 01:15:43.865]  We better get in the mindset of supporting the leaders that are fighting.
[01:15:43.865 --> 01:15:48.367]  We don't get Jordan Soros money or IMF money or Chai Com money like Joe Biden.
[01:15:48.367 --> 01:15:49.768]  We get money from you.
[01:15:49.768 --> 01:15:52.729]  Go to MyPillow.com and use promo code Alex.

[01:16:02.048 --> 01:16:03.869]  Diet force is amazing!
[01:16:03.869 --> 01:16:06.131]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[01:16:06.131 --> 01:16:09.474]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[01:16:09.474 --> 01:16:12.055]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[01:16:12.055 --> 01:16:18.420]  Like under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:20.622]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[01:16:21.804 --> 01:16:24.647]  Like, chip shake for the ladies, mate.

[01:16:26.808 --> 01:16:29.691]  You have to get the Diet Force and have it to a day.

[01:16:58.891 --> 01:17:01.933]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered.
[01:17:01.933 --> 01:17:04.714]  And InfoWars has been the tip of asparagus tyranny.
[01:17:04.714 --> 01:17:10.117]  And when it comes to products we sell to fund our operation, they're just like our news and information.
[01:17:10.117 --> 01:17:13.019]  They are powerful and they change the world.
[01:17:13.019 --> 01:17:18.882]  The Real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years, it's been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[01:17:18.882 --> 01:17:20.603]  It's finally back in stock for

[01:18:10.515 --> 01:18:20.057]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[01:18:20.057 --> 01:18:25.518]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[01:18:25.518 --> 01:18:28.219]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,
[01:18:28.479 --> 01:18:30.900]  We're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:36.081]  You're not going to find 1,000 mg high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[01:18:36.081 --> 01:18:38.441]  You're not going to find it at the 10 mg or the 20 mg.
[01:18:38.441 --> 01:18:42.222]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[01:18:42.222 --> 01:18:44.883]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[01:18:44.883 --> 01:18:50.985]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[01:18:50.985 --> 01:18:55.346]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:55.346 --> 01:18:56.066]  A true 360 win.
[01:18:59.002 --> 01:18:59.463]  We're good to go.
[01:19:18.882 --> 01:19:20.543]  That features natokinase.
[01:19:20.543 --> 01:19:22.885]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[01:19:22.885 --> 01:19:28.569]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[01:19:28.569 --> 01:19:29.369]  This is very important.
[01:19:29.369 --> 01:19:34.413]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[01:19:34.413 --> 01:19:35.894]  People are low with the spike protein.
[01:19:35.894 --> 01:19:36.855]  They don't feel well.
[01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:38.576]  This is a potential solution.
[01:19:38.576 --> 01:19:41.618]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[01:19:41.618 --> 01:19:44.540]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:45.921]  Isn't it interesting?
[01:19:45.921 --> 01:19:47.022]  Natural substances.
[01:19:47.022 --> 01:19:52.024]  It's in a sense combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[01:19:52.024 --> 01:19:56.506]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support and thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[01:19:56.506 --> 01:20:01.248]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[01:20:01.248 --> 01:20:07.151]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:13.246 --> 01:20:18.067]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, February 6, 2023 broadcast.
[01:20:18.067 --> 01:20:22.708]  Mike Lindell of MyPillow.com is our guest.
[01:20:22.708 --> 01:20:24.588]  And I want to get into the balloon.
[01:20:24.588 --> 01:20:25.909]  I want to get into election fraud.
[01:20:25.909 --> 01:20:28.029]  I want to get into Trump vs. DeSantis.
[01:20:28.029 --> 01:20:35.291]  I want to get into where Mike Lindell sees this country going, the great things he's done with Frank Speech TV, reaching millions a day with a great lineup of hosts.
[01:20:35.291 --> 01:20:36.451]  This is a man of action.
[01:20:36.451 --> 01:20:37.151]  I admire him.
[01:20:37.851 --> 01:20:41.074]  And I admire how funny he is as well.
[01:20:41.074 --> 01:20:44.597]  It's always good to be able to have some fun while we battle tyranny.
[01:20:44.597 --> 01:20:47.720]  But you got caught up by the break.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:48.401]  Let's talk about things.
[01:20:48.401 --> 01:20:50.082]  You're a sponsor of the show.
[01:20:50.082 --> 01:20:50.863]  You support us.
[01:20:50.863 --> 01:20:55.707]  It's not the main reason I had you on today, but usually you're hard to even get to plug the products when you're on.
[01:20:55.707 --> 01:20:58.330]  But you've got so many great Made in America products.
[01:20:58.330 --> 01:21:02.213]  And if people go to your sites and use promo code Alex, they get even bigger discounts.
[01:21:02.213 --> 01:21:04.055]  But tell folks about this new pillow you've got.
[01:21:04.847 --> 01:21:06.548]  Yeah, this is a big announcement.
[01:21:06.548 --> 01:21:09.430]  When I invented my pillow, that was in 2004.
[01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:10.972]  It took a year to invent.
[01:21:10.972 --> 01:21:12.092]  Nothing ever changed.
[01:21:12.092 --> 01:21:14.374]  It was the best patented fill, the best.
[01:21:14.374 --> 01:21:18.577]  Remember, sleep is about height and staying there, and temperature.
[01:21:18.577 --> 01:21:26.864]  Well now, I found out about a year and a half ago about temperature regulating thread that's made here in the U.S.
[01:21:26.864 --> 01:21:28.525]  So I had this fabric made
[01:21:29.185 --> 01:21:35.107]  And I said, you know, let's make an exclusive MyPillow fabric and see if it works with the great patented fill.
[01:21:35.107 --> 01:21:37.308]  I've slept on it now for two months.
[01:21:37.308 --> 01:21:39.928]  This stuff is cool to the touch.
[01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:42.789]  You're not going to be flipping that pillow to the cool side.
[01:21:42.789 --> 01:21:46.710]  It is the most, the best pillow in history, just got even better.
[01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:48.551]  And we're doing the buy one, get one free.
[01:21:49.774 --> 01:22:01.378]  We just actually got these into production last week, and the commercial for it, it was one of our big movie commercials we made where the one in the mirror, that comes out in about 10 days.
[01:22:01.378 --> 01:22:09.621]  So you're getting them here, one of the first ones to get them in the country, and trust me, it brings sleep to a whole new level.
[01:22:09.621 --> 01:22:11.282]  They're absolutely the best pillow ever.
[01:22:12.262 --> 01:22:18.726]  You have great products, hundreds of great products, but more importantly, you're using the money to fight the New World Order fearlessly.
[01:22:18.726 --> 01:22:27.330]  That's why everybody should shop for their sheets and their pillows and their beds and their dog beds and their slippers and everything at MyPillow.com.
[01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:29.471]  You've got the great bath rubs, everything.
[01:22:29.471 --> 01:22:37.955]  And just use promo code to get the big discount, promo code A-L-E-X, and that keeps this show on air as well.
[01:22:37.955 --> 01:22:39.976]  What else do you have going on over at MyPillow.com?
[01:22:41.434 --> 01:22:47.497]  Well, that's our biggest announcement, but we've got, with your promo code, we have the slippers on sale.
[01:22:47.497 --> 01:22:53.739]  We even have some closeout styles, so you can get them really great price using promo code ALEX.
[01:22:53.739 --> 01:22:54.820]  We've got the sheets.
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:23:01.002]  We've got a buy one, get one free that started last week on the sheets, the Gaze of Dreams sheets.
[01:23:01.002 --> 01:23:06.785]  And we've got a lot of closeouts for products from the winter here, so you've got to check that out.
[01:23:07.165 --> 01:23:09.847]  The bathrobe, the closeout sale on the bathrobes.
[01:23:09.847 --> 01:23:12.068]  Those are the best bathrobes ever made.
[01:23:12.068 --> 01:23:13.649]  That's Sabina Cotton.
[01:23:13.649 --> 01:23:17.872]  Amazing, amazing bathrobes.
[01:23:17.872 --> 01:23:20.493]  And you can just go down the overstock sale there.
[01:23:20.493 --> 01:23:22.014]  We have an overstock sale.
[01:23:22.014 --> 01:23:30.039]  We have passed, because we lost off just about 99% of all our retailers, we're passing this all on to our customers.
[01:23:30.039 --> 01:23:31.760]  And yes, you're right, Alex.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.282]  It supports everything I get that comes through to me.
[01:23:34.802 --> 01:23:36.965]  I'm using it to help save our country.
[01:23:36.965 --> 01:23:39.428]  I mean, that's what I'm doing with all my money.
[01:23:39.428 --> 01:23:46.878]  I poured millions upon millions of dollars into saving our country because we've got to get rid of these elections.
[01:23:46.878 --> 01:23:52.345]  And if just a fraction more successful businessmen and women did what you've done, we would not be in this much trouble.
[01:23:53.473 --> 01:23:54.295]  I'm optimistic.
[01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.697]  I'm seeing a huge awakening.
[01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.780]  I get nothing but love when I'm on the street.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:00.225]  I got a lot of hate, you know, years ago.
[01:24:00.225 --> 01:24:01.707]  Mostly love, but still a lot of hate.
[01:24:01.707 --> 01:24:03.049]  All I'm getting is love.
[01:24:03.049 --> 01:24:04.412]  All we're seeing is a huge awakening.
[01:24:04.412 --> 01:24:04.933]  What are you seeing?
[01:24:06.127 --> 01:24:07.429]  No, that's exactly right.
[01:24:07.429 --> 01:24:15.258]  You know, when I went on Jimmy Kimmel, I did it for a very good reason, and that is to get the word out.
[01:24:15.258 --> 01:24:19.543]  Remember, we don't have Fox News, everybody, and Newsmax and CELA Media.
[01:24:19.543 --> 01:24:22.046]  They won't talk about our election platforms.
[01:24:22.046 --> 01:24:24.089]  They will not talk about elections.
[01:24:24.549 --> 01:24:25.310]  We're good to go.
[01:24:40.763 --> 01:24:54.794]  Do you know that, Alex, that I was being in California there, people were climbing fences and stuff when I was on Jimmy Kimmel to talk and go, we will help you save our country, save our country, and wanting autographs and pictures.
[01:24:54.794 --> 01:24:58.337]  And a lot of them I talked to later and they, you know, they voted Democrat.
[01:24:58.337 --> 01:25:04.842]  They're not doing that again because they realized the manifestation of a stolen election must slash what's going on now.
[01:25:06.763 --> 01:25:14.830]  So, I see so much hope and there's also so much more that I know that if people knew what I know, you know, we have great things that happen.
[01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:21.255]  You have, you just had Alabama go get rid of Eric, the dirty roller bowls, that system.
[01:25:21.255 --> 01:25:25.639]  You had Cleaborn County, Arkansas go completely paper, hand-counted.
[01:25:26.299 --> 01:25:52.791]  You've got all these states we have over and we have over 50 lawsuits going on to change back to our The things that were put in illegally by Secretary of State's to change them back to where that was the how they were before You know, you can't break our Constitution and keep that as the status quo So we're fighting every day and we've got a big announcement at the end of the week this platform that I'm putting together this and
[01:25:53.471 --> 01:25:55.933]  It's going to be amazing when this is announced.
[01:25:55.933 --> 01:25:58.376]  Hopefully by Friday.
[01:25:58.376 --> 01:26:03.340]  But this is going to be the platform that really brings it all together like a hub of a wheel.
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:05.402]  So we have a communication process.
[01:26:05.402 --> 01:26:06.483]  We have everything.
[01:26:06.483 --> 01:26:08.865]  Because it's not just a few of us out there.
[01:26:08.865 --> 01:26:13.729]  It's millions of us out there that are working hard to get this country back.
[01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:14.570]  Basically back.
[01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:19.332]  Well, that's why the enemies of freedom work around the clock to try to take you and I and others off the air.
[01:26:19.332 --> 01:26:22.553]  Because we have the majority of people awake every race, color, and creed.
[01:26:22.553 --> 01:26:26.055]  They just feel alone because they don't have places to come together.
[01:26:26.055 --> 01:26:27.295]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:26:27.295 --> 01:26:35.719]  I see people, if they're out there, I'll tell you this, if they're, you know, the attack media actually helps us, Alex, because it helps us get the word out, right?
[01:26:35.719 --> 01:26:40.861]  But it's the ones, when I see people out there that are feeling hopeless, I go, have you been watching Fox News?
[01:26:40.861 --> 01:26:42.402]  They go, yeah, that's all they watch is Fox.
[01:26:42.742 --> 01:26:53.986]  Well, they're not going to tell you about the hope that's going on, the things out there like, you know, lawsuits for winning and to change these election platforms back, getting rid of these electronic machines.
[01:26:53.986 --> 01:26:56.287]  You know, they're not going to report these things.
[01:26:56.287 --> 01:26:58.067]  And people need to hear that.
[01:26:58.067 --> 01:27:02.709]  Right now, they're hearing, you know, you hear about the border with the fentanyl pouring across.
[01:27:03.869 --> 01:27:07.752]  And over 300 people dying every day from addiction.
[01:27:07.752 --> 01:27:09.133]  Well, you know what?
[01:27:09.133 --> 01:27:13.155]  I've been putting out there right on my platform, the LyndaleRecoveryNetwork.org.
[01:27:13.155 --> 01:27:14.456]  It's free, everybody.
[01:27:14.456 --> 01:27:16.118]  You can send anyone you want there.
[01:27:16.118 --> 01:27:16.658]  It's free.
[01:27:16.658 --> 01:27:18.039]  I put it out there.
[01:27:18.039 --> 01:27:19.560]  I used to be an addict, so I know.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.141]  And it works.
[01:27:21.141 --> 01:27:22.482]  It'll help them and give you hope.
[01:27:23.042 --> 01:27:27.966]  So, I want to spread the message of hope and so people, and then they got to be courageous.
[01:27:27.966 --> 01:27:29.066]  We know that Alex.
[01:27:29.066 --> 01:27:31.848]  Courage is contagious everybody.
[01:27:31.848 --> 01:27:34.090]  So now's the time to be courageous.
[01:27:34.090 --> 01:27:37.232]  You need, people ask me all the time, well how can I help?
[01:27:37.232 --> 01:27:42.715]  When you, you know, when you get information, put it on all the media platforms, all the new platforms.
[01:27:42.715 --> 01:27:43.696]  Choose social.
[01:27:43.696 --> 01:27:49.220]  Frank's Social, Getter, Gab, Telegram, even the new Twitter, even Suckabuck's Facebook.
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.701]  The more we can keep spreading
[01:27:51.261 --> 01:27:55.464]  Well, the globalists admitted in their own documents they're losing worldwide, not just here.
[01:28:13.723 --> 01:28:15.244]  That's why they're working so hard.
[01:28:15.244 --> 01:28:25.489]  So we're at that critical part of the football game where we've just got possession and we're a few points ahead, but now we've got to just get eye of the tiger and focus and not shut up.
[01:28:25.489 --> 01:28:32.712]  And just like you said, I'll go on Mainstream News, even though it's rigged, even though they attack, people hate them so much, we always get nothing but positive feedback.
[01:28:33.570 --> 01:28:34.891]  Right, that's right.
[01:28:34.891 --> 01:28:36.072]  That's exactly right.
[01:28:36.072 --> 01:28:41.576]  And, you know, if it wouldn't be for the media attack, it would be silent out there.
[01:28:41.576 --> 01:28:52.565]  I mean, when I went on Jimmy Kimmel, I'll tell you, Jimmy came up afterwards, he gives me a hug, you know, and he asked me, he goes, Mike, without these machines, how are we going to do this?
[01:28:52.565 --> 01:28:56.608]  I want to hear about this, and the balloon, and Trump is saying so much more.
[01:28:56.608 --> 01:28:57.069]  Mike Lindell.

[01:31:10.044 --> 01:31:11.605]  Let's win the war.
[01:31:11.605 --> 01:31:13.365]  The information war.
[01:31:13.365 --> 01:31:18.147]  There's nothing you can do more important than keeping InfoWars on air and the fight for liberty.
[01:31:18.147 --> 01:31:19.948]  I don't think anybody denies that fact.

[01:32:00.123 --> 01:32:05.005]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[01:32:05.005 --> 01:32:11.428]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but the world.
[01:32:11.428 --> 01:32:16.550]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:18.251]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[01:32:18.251 --> 01:32:24.674]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[01:32:25.394 --> 01:32:30.836]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[01:32:30.836 --> 01:32:35.158]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[01:32:35.158 --> 01:32:44.382]  And that's why today is more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[01:32:44.382 --> 01:32:45.743]  God bless you all.
[01:32:45.743 --> 01:32:46.783]  I salute you.
[01:32:46.783 --> 01:32:47.784]  I thank you.
[01:32:47.784 --> 01:32:53.586]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[01:32:53.886 --> 01:32:55.228]  The fight is my fight.
[01:32:55.228 --> 01:32:55.848]  It's your fight.
[01:32:55.848 --> 01:32:56.589]  It's our fight.
[01:32:56.589 --> 01:33:01.234]  God bless you all.
[01:33:01.234 --> 01:33:07.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.251 --> 01:33:20.095]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:20.095 --> 01:33:22.016]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.016 --> 01:33:25.618]  Our love is unconditional.
[01:33:25.618 --> 01:33:29.321]  We knew it from the start.
[01:33:29.321 --> 01:33:32.263]  I see it in your eyes.
[01:33:32.263 --> 01:33:36.826]  You can feel it from my heart.
[01:33:36.826 --> 01:33:41.830]  From here on after, let's stay the way we are right now.
[01:33:43.291 --> 01:33:47.292]  To the audience, I agree with George Strait.
[01:33:47.292 --> 01:33:49.872]  I cross my heart.
[01:33:49.872 --> 01:33:50.432]  I promise you.
[01:33:50.432 --> 01:33:51.333]  We're not like these.
[01:34:08.599 --> 01:34:10.759]  Evil Satanists.
[01:34:10.759 --> 01:34:14.740]  We love God, we love justice, and you've got my commitment to be the best man I can be.
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:17.521]  Promote freedom for my children and your children in the future.
[01:34:17.521 --> 01:34:27.683]  I think about George Strait's beautiful, loving Texas voice, compared to all that Satanism we saw at the Grammys, and just the open evil of Hollywood and everything they're doing.
[01:34:27.683 --> 01:34:31.184]  Mike Lindell, I want to ask you just about your relationship with God and
[01:34:32.517 --> 01:34:40.063]  The fact that this is a spiritual battle, and how God healed you and has healed so many, and has healed me as well, and it's a continuing, ongoing process.
[01:34:40.063 --> 01:34:53.553]  But what do you make of the poison shots, the total vindication now, Bloomberg and Pfizer admitting it causes heart attacks and strokes today, the Satanism everywhere, the war, I mean, all of this.
[01:34:53.553 --> 01:34:56.435]  What is your view on the battle between good versus evil?
[01:34:57.594 --> 01:35:10.322]  Well, that gets brought up a lot to me, and I say, you know, God's had his hand in all of this, and if all of the, you know, people don't look to Jesus as things are going bad, usually.
[01:35:10.322 --> 01:35:13.483]  If things are going good, they get complacent, whatever.
[01:35:13.483 --> 01:35:16.645]  We're in the greatest revival for Jesus Christ in history.
[01:35:16.645 --> 01:35:18.666]  I mean, people are pouring in.
[01:35:18.666 --> 01:35:26.211]  And, you know, if we get to this great place out here, you're going to look back and you're going to say, all these things had to happen just the way they happened.
[01:35:27.186 --> 01:35:28.847]  Um, even the good, even the bad.
[01:35:28.847 --> 01:35:32.349]  Remember God uses, God uses everything for good.
[01:35:32.349 --> 01:35:37.891]  So if you, you know, things are going bad at that time, you're going, okay, maybe there's a reason when you get way out here.
[01:35:37.891 --> 01:35:41.273]  Um, you have to, it's opening people's eyes.
[01:35:41.273 --> 01:35:42.914]  I really think it's been amazing.
[01:35:42.914 --> 01:35:47.376]  I think back, I say, you know, if Donald Trump would have been put back in on December 14th of 2020,
[01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:49.997]  You know what?
[01:35:49.997 --> 01:35:57.823]  We would have lost our country, and more importantly, we wouldn't have had all these people pouring into Jesus.
[01:35:57.823 --> 01:36:05.468]  And what I mean by that is that you wouldn't have found all of these things that are coming out, all the evil that's exposing itself.
[01:36:05.468 --> 01:36:09.691]  Remember, Alex, we're in a spiritual battle of biblical proportions, and evil
[01:36:10.382 --> 01:36:10.642]  We're good.
[01:36:28.027 --> 01:36:31.310]  But I'm telling you, I talked to, let me tell you something.
[01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:33.753]  I went to California about two months ago.
[01:36:33.753 --> 01:36:35.354]  I was up in California.
[01:36:35.354 --> 01:36:36.776]  I know it was in September.
[01:36:36.776 --> 01:36:41.000]  I'm up there with all these kids at 25 to 30 years old that have voted Democrat.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.201]  They were flipping.
[01:36:42.201 --> 01:36:44.463]  They were asking, is there any hope for our country?
[01:36:44.463 --> 01:36:45.564]  We talked about the Lord.
[01:36:45.564 --> 01:36:46.385]  We talked about God.
[01:36:46.385 --> 01:36:47.226]  We talked about Jesus.
[01:36:47.746 --> 01:36:50.287]  And I spent a week in that town.
[01:36:50.287 --> 01:36:56.270]  Then the next week, I go down to Florida for the hurricane victims, giving them pillows and blankets and everything.
[01:36:56.270 --> 01:37:06.215]  We went in this one trailer park, and it looked like a river with two banks of just all physical possessions and everything from their trailers.
[01:37:06.215 --> 01:37:08.836]  They lost everything they had physically.
[01:37:08.836 --> 01:37:13.438]  And they're all out there, a lot of Hispanics, and I'm talking to them, even with an interpreter.
[01:37:13.438 --> 01:37:15.379]  The common theme was, you know what?
[01:37:16.619 --> 01:37:22.302]  They had hoped that if we could save our country, our freedoms, they can get their physical possessions back.
[01:37:22.302 --> 01:37:30.565]  They were worried more about the spiritual battle we're in and worried more about the future than those physical things.
[01:37:30.565 --> 01:37:34.146]  They could get those back if we could save our freedoms.
[01:37:36.747 --> 01:37:39.889]  For me, people say, well, Mike, you have so much courage and whatever.
[01:37:39.889 --> 01:37:42.751]  No, I only fear the Lord, so it's pretty easy.
[01:37:42.751 --> 01:37:44.071]  I give it to Him.
[01:37:44.071 --> 01:37:44.752]  I just pray.
[01:37:44.752 --> 01:37:46.593]  I pray for discernment.
[01:37:46.593 --> 01:37:48.914]  I pray Proverbs 3, 5, 6.
[01:37:48.914 --> 01:37:51.375]  Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[01:37:51.375 --> 01:37:57.839]  Lean not on your own understanding, and always acknowledge Him, and He will guide your paths.
[01:37:57.839 --> 01:38:01.341]  You know, Alex, I was going down some bad paths back when I was a crack addict.
[01:38:01.341 --> 01:38:04.763]  I pray, and people, I want to say one more thing that you brought up that
[01:38:05.467 --> 01:38:09.692]  People, you know, everyone out there, Mike, I prayed and this didn't happen, I prayed.
[01:38:09.692 --> 01:38:12.796]  Those are reactionary prayers, everybody.
[01:38:12.796 --> 01:38:14.418]  And you know what?
[01:38:14.418 --> 01:38:18.604]  If you want to be proactive in prayer... You've got to surrender and tell God to take over.
[01:38:18.604 --> 01:38:19.244]  Right.
[01:38:19.244 --> 01:38:19.565]  Right.
[01:38:19.565 --> 01:38:20.847]  But I will say this.
[01:38:20.847 --> 01:38:24.191]  Remember, the reactionary prayers, that might not be God's will.
[01:38:24.944 --> 01:38:26.446]  And where is God's will?
[01:38:26.446 --> 01:38:28.088]  God's will is in the Word.
[01:38:28.088 --> 01:38:33.674]  So if you stay in the Word, your proactive prayers, they line up a lot better.
[01:38:33.674 --> 01:38:34.715]  And you're exactly right.
[01:38:34.715 --> 01:38:36.477]  You surrender to Jesus, it's over.
[01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:38.319]  It's easy.
[01:38:38.319 --> 01:38:39.741]  But they want us to surrender to Satan.
[01:38:39.741 --> 01:38:42.064]  You said something so important a few minutes ago.
[01:38:42.064 --> 01:38:44.607]  They're revealing themselves, even though it's destroying them.
[01:38:44.607 --> 01:38:45.668]  Why are they doing that?
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:50.521]  That's what I say, because evil is greedy.
[01:38:50.521 --> 01:38:53.602]  You would think that they would have backed off.
[01:38:53.602 --> 01:38:54.603]  Hey, they're on to us.
[01:38:54.603 --> 01:38:57.544]  Let's just talk the election crime, just that alone.
[01:38:57.544 --> 01:38:59.004]  You know what?
[01:38:59.004 --> 01:38:59.805]  They're on to us.
[01:38:59.805 --> 01:39:02.366]  We've got the machines and computers forever.
[01:39:02.366 --> 01:39:03.526]  Let's at least back off.
[01:39:03.526 --> 01:39:05.407]  No, they doubled down, tripled down.
[01:39:05.407 --> 01:39:08.088]  Look at the race in Arizona, everybody.
[01:39:08.088 --> 01:39:14.490]  If you've got all these corrupt machines where you're hacking in and everything else, you would at least make them work on the front end.
[01:39:15.130 --> 01:39:19.194]  Uh, that they're functioning right, and then it's pretty obvious we have sixty-seven percent of them.
[01:39:19.194 --> 01:39:20.716]  No, they've stolen every level greedily.
[01:39:21.710 --> 01:39:23.191]  Yeah, they don't care.
[01:39:23.191 --> 01:39:26.554]  It's like, you know, whatever level they can steal at, that's what they're doing.
[01:39:26.554 --> 01:39:29.657]  And evil is greedy, and that's to our advantage, everybody.
[01:39:29.657 --> 01:39:31.859]  And they're very deceptive, Alex.
[01:39:31.859 --> 01:39:33.080]  They're very deceptive.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:36.503]  It's like a huge marketing game when you look at it, too.
[01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:45.130]  Remember when we had Afghanistan, everybody, and the whole world was on the worst decision ever made in human history, and one of the worst.
[01:39:45.130 --> 01:39:48.092]  And ten days later, nobody's talking about it.
[01:39:48.092 --> 01:39:48.553]  You know why?
[01:39:49.153 --> 01:39:51.234]  Because they're all sitting there going, what are we going to do?
[01:39:51.234 --> 01:39:54.616]  Everyone's focusing on their own twist, all this, you know, these things.
[01:39:54.616 --> 01:40:01.099]  Well, 10 days later, they had Biden come out and go, anyone with 100 or more people in their company, you have to get a shot.
[01:40:01.099 --> 01:40:03.981]  So the attention of the world went, we're not doing it.
[01:40:03.981 --> 01:40:06.282]  But you forgot about Afghanistan.
[01:40:06.282 --> 01:40:10.284]  And this is all so much of this stuff is done to deflect.
[01:40:10.284 --> 01:40:13.045]  And that's why it's so important that we stay focused.
[01:40:13.045 --> 01:40:15.526]  This is a, this is a bigger battle.
[01:40:15.526 --> 01:40:17.227]  The time we have left is you got to leave us.
[01:40:17.227 --> 01:40:17.968]  I'm going to make a break.
[01:40:17.968 --> 01:40:18.488]  Major news.
[01:40:20.043 --> 01:40:21.504]  I like Trump.
[01:40:21.504 --> 01:40:23.004]  I like DeSantis.
[01:40:23.004 --> 01:40:25.905]  But the big money's lining up behind DeSantis, which I don't like.
[01:40:25.905 --> 01:40:28.806]  Seems I have problems with Trump still pushing the shot.
[01:40:28.806 --> 01:40:33.788]  When you got the Koch brothers against him, I'm like, wow, I should probably back Trump then.
[01:40:33.788 --> 01:40:35.708]  What's your view on that?
[01:40:35.708 --> 01:40:37.409]  Well, I've said it before.
[01:40:37.409 --> 01:40:43.611]  If Ron DeSantis wants to help our country at all, he should endorse Donald Trump right now, today.
[01:40:44.329 --> 01:40:47.292]  I mean, it's, you know, just endorse him, unite him.
[01:40:47.292 --> 01:40:49.794]  If he wants to run, do it in 2028.
[01:40:49.794 --> 01:40:51.656]  Be the governor you are.
[01:40:51.656 --> 01:40:53.338]  That's very simple.
[01:40:53.338 --> 01:40:58.462]  Donald Trump is the favorite of this country by overwhelming proportions.
[01:40:58.462 --> 01:40:58.983]  He won.
[01:40:58.983 --> 01:41:00.544]  He deserves that term.
[01:41:04.108 --> 01:41:05.348]  Yeah, he would destroy them.
[01:41:05.348 --> 01:41:07.769]  He would destroy anybody running in the primary.
[01:41:07.769 --> 01:41:17.053]  So why, you know, you got, like I say, I think they're pitting this, putting DeSantis and talking about DeSantis.
[01:41:17.053 --> 01:41:20.274]  I want to say one thing, too, that this is news on your show.
[01:41:20.274 --> 01:41:23.975]  I actually looked into, our cyber guys looked into Miami-Dade County.
[01:41:24.515 --> 01:41:31.917]  And that was all over the news because it was a deviation where a Republican won Miami-Dade County hadn't been run in decades.
[01:41:31.917 --> 01:41:32.698]  Well, guess what?
[01:41:32.698 --> 01:41:34.678]  We just got that news back.
[01:41:34.678 --> 01:41:40.500]  There was no computer manipulation in 2022 in Miami-Dade County.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:46.302]  That's the first big county we found where there was no computer manipulation in the last two elections.
[01:41:46.302 --> 01:41:47.942]  Now, let me tell you what that means.
[01:41:47.942 --> 01:41:50.323]  That means that this whole country's red.
[01:41:51.063 --> 01:42:01.751]  If you take all the places where they're manipulating with computers, if Miami-Dade County had nothing, it's not because DeSantis is the greatest guy ever, that he overran that.
[01:42:01.751 --> 01:42:03.652]  It's because they didn't even cheat at all there.
[01:42:03.652 --> 01:42:04.613]  Exactly.
[01:42:04.613 --> 01:42:05.413]  Let me say this.
[01:42:05.413 --> 01:42:06.534]  You're a prominent guy.
[01:42:06.534 --> 01:42:07.575]  I'm prominent.
[01:42:07.575 --> 01:42:08.976]  Our listeners aren't, which is a blessing.
[01:42:08.976 --> 01:42:09.957]  They need to be private.
[01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:10.957]  They don't see the love.
[01:42:10.957 --> 01:42:15.300]  I used to get 70% love, 30% hate when Trump first got elected.
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:16.121]  That was the worst it ever was.
[01:42:17.722 --> 01:42:19.765]  Basically nothing but love in public.
[01:42:19.765 --> 01:42:20.285]  Everywhere.
[01:42:20.285 --> 01:42:22.948]  Liberals apologizing, crying, saying they were wrong.
[01:42:22.948 --> 01:42:25.592]  I agree with you that we've already won the hearts and minds.
[01:42:25.592 --> 01:42:28.035]  Now we've just got to take the country back.
[01:42:28.035 --> 01:42:29.176]  Yep, absolutely.
[01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:30.257]  We've got to fix our election.
[01:42:30.257 --> 01:42:32.260]  So that's all you're getting in the street is basically love too?
[01:42:33.425 --> 01:42:34.686]  A hundred percent.
[01:42:34.686 --> 01:42:35.806]  A hundred percent.
[01:42:35.806 --> 01:42:43.989]  I haven't had one person come up to me, and I've spent a lot of time in very liberal, progressive places, and in the cities for weeks at a time.
[01:42:43.989 --> 01:42:48.151]  I just came from California again, and they come up, they go, they're on board.
[01:42:48.151 --> 01:42:49.771]  They want, you know, they're just loving it.
[01:42:49.771 --> 01:42:51.012]  We are winning, praise God.
[01:42:51.012 --> 01:42:52.092]  Mike Lindell, incredible.
[01:42:52.092 --> 01:42:52.892]  Join us again soon.
[01:42:52.892 --> 01:42:54.393]  Frank Speaks TV, incredible.
[01:42:54.393 --> 01:42:56.033]  God bless you, brother.
[01:42:56.033 --> 01:42:56.674]  Yep, thanks.
[01:42:56.674 --> 01:42:57.294]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:42:59.138 --> 01:43:01.321]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:43:01.321 --> 01:43:03.123]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:43:03.123 --> 01:43:05.185]  This is an information war.
[01:43:05.185 --> 01:43:09.870]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:16.358]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[01:43:16.818 --> 01:43:17.559]  We're good to go.
[01:43:38.373 --> 01:43:46.300]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:48.642]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[01:43:48.642 --> 01:43:50.464]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:43:50.464 --> 01:43:51.605]  We're going over the top.
[01:43:51.605 --> 01:43:53.106]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[01:43:53.106 --> 01:43:56.109]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[01:43:59.153 --> 01:44:05.319]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[01:44:05.319 --> 01:44:18.331]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting InfoWarstore.com right now and taking action.
[01:44:18.331 --> 01:44:23.276]  I thank you for your vast support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[01:44:23.696 --> 01:44:25.317]  Keep Info Wars on the air.
[01:44:25.317 --> 01:44:27.618]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[01:44:27.618 --> 01:44:29.079]  They're coming for you and your family.
[01:44:29.079 --> 01:44:30.340]  They're coming for me.
[01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:31.561]  They're coming for the children.
[01:44:31.561 --> 01:44:34.142]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[01:44:34.142 --> 01:44:37.544]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[01:44:37.544 --> 01:44:38.825]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[01:44:39.065 --> 01:44:41.166]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[01:44:41.166 --> 01:44:46.590]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[01:44:46.590 --> 01:44:50.513]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[01:44:50.513 --> 01:44:51.713]  Let's do it together.
[01:44:51.713 --> 01:44:54.015]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:54.015 --> 01:44:57.837]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:57.837 --> 01:44:59.198]  Now take action now!
[01:44:59.198 --> 01:45:06.383]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago,
[01:45:08.294 --> 01:45:11.817]  Rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[01:45:11.817 --> 01:45:15.841]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[01:45:15.841 --> 01:45:18.143]  And it's the same scion today.
[01:45:18.143 --> 01:45:22.567]  Infowars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[01:45:22.567 --> 01:45:25.729]  Because the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:33.997]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[01:45:34.537 --> 01:45:40.721]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:45:40.721 --> 01:45:42.683]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[01:45:42.683 --> 01:45:49.948]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[01:45:49.948 --> 01:45:51.349]  It is all in your hands.
[01:45:51.349 --> 01:45:52.690]  So thanks for your support.
[01:45:52.690 --> 01:45:53.891]  Stand up against the globalists.
[01:45:53.891 --> 01:45:57.173]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[01:45:57.173 --> 01:45:58.954]  It's up to you.
[01:45:58.954 --> 01:46:02.437]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:46:07.233 --> 01:46:08.593]  I want you all to know something.
[01:46:08.593 --> 01:46:10.534]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:46:10.534 --> 01:46:14.075]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[01:46:14.075 --> 01:46:17.176]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:46:17.176 --> 01:46:21.437]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:46:21.437 --> 01:46:23.657]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:46:23.657 --> 01:46:27.178]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:46:27.178 --> 01:46:30.639]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:46:30.919 --> 01:46:33.800]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:34.800]  Years ago.
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:36.901]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[01:46:36.901 --> 01:46:38.882]  Not for a second.
[01:46:38.882 --> 01:46:41.402]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:46:41.402 --> 01:46:43.863]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:46:43.863 --> 01:46:47.004]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:46:47.004 --> 01:46:48.545]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[01:46:48.545 --> 01:46:54.286]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:46:54.286 --> 01:46:55.527]  AlexJonesLive.com
[01:47:00.552 --> 01:47:05.153]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:05.153 --> 01:47:23.956]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:23.956 --> 01:47:28.057]  All the sweet young things, trying to make the scene.
[01:47:40.712 --> 01:47:43.053]  Star Spangled Banner.
[01:47:43.053 --> 01:47:46.935]  Flutters in the sky.
[01:47:46.935 --> 01:48:09.004]  Time waits for those who are afraid to die.
[01:48:09.004 --> 01:48:09.985]  Keep on pushing.
[01:48:11.576 --> 01:48:13.117]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:13.117 --> 01:48:17.279]  All right, I wanted to get Mike Lindell on because he just has a lot of energy and I like him.
[01:48:17.279 --> 01:48:19.360]  He's a great guy.
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:24.262]  Look, I got all these stacks I haven't hit, more than 10 stacks of incredible news.
[01:48:24.262 --> 01:48:28.524]  And I'm going to run through the waterfront with Roger Stone next hour on these.
[01:48:28.524 --> 01:48:38.089]  But I got to tell you, this stack right here, I'm almost guilty that I didn't just cancel the guests and do this for the whole show.
[01:48:39.096 --> 01:48:41.537]  Because I'd already seen an earlier draft of this U.N.
[01:48:41.537 --> 01:48:50.182]  treaty, but now we've got the official final draft, and it is spectacularly authoritarian, totalitarian.
[01:48:50.182 --> 01:48:53.985]  It just, I mean, we knew this was coming.
[01:48:53.985 --> 01:49:03.230]  But to see it all front and center like this is crazy.
[01:49:03.230 --> 01:49:06.652]  And that's what everybody's saying on the Internet.
[01:49:06.652 --> 01:49:08.133]  I'm not even trying to look for my name.
[01:49:09.482 --> 01:49:12.083]  I don't say, oh, my name's big, oh, I'm big.
[01:49:12.083 --> 01:49:13.163]  No, it makes me a target.
[01:49:13.163 --> 01:49:15.243]  But I'm also a barometer.
[01:49:15.243 --> 01:49:20.225]  And so it was trending again this morning, Alex Jones, about the satanic ceremony they had.
[01:49:20.225 --> 01:49:23.606]  Alex Jones is right, at the Grammys.
[01:49:23.606 --> 01:49:32.188]  So the enemies tried to make me a symbol of lies, a symbol of fraud, a symbol of toxic masculinity.
[01:49:32.188 --> 01:49:36.429]  But thanks to all of you supporting us and standing up, it's not working, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:37.506 --> 01:49:39.026]  That's what I was getting to with Mike Lindell.
[01:49:39.026 --> 01:49:42.267]  I was talking to him during the breaks.
[01:49:42.267 --> 01:49:45.047]  He said, yeah, I used to get 10% attacks.
[01:49:45.047 --> 01:49:50.348]  It was pretty bad because you walk through a crowd of 200 people and you shake 100 hands and then all of a sudden people attack you.
[01:49:50.348 --> 01:49:59.270]  It's still very disconcerting when you're at the grocery store or the gas station or church or walking down the street or at the post office and somebody gets in your face.
[01:49:59.270 --> 01:50:04.791]  And knock on wood, because I hate it happening, it's not been happening any.
[01:50:06.311 --> 01:50:17.473]  I mean, I go months now out in public before I get any hate.
[01:50:17.473 --> 01:50:19.974]  Months.
[01:50:19.974 --> 01:50:31.176]  And I went to Cancun for four days with my wife and my youngest child and a bodyguard, and he would sit back under the trees where they had chairs when we were out in the sun throwing the football and everything else, taking a break that I had to have.
[01:50:32.452 --> 01:50:38.197]  And it's so easy and quick from Texas, two hour flight down there, 400 bucks on Southwest, you're right back.
[01:50:38.197 --> 01:50:39.678]  He said it was incredible.
[01:50:39.678 --> 01:50:41.720]  He sat there.
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:45.484]  Great guys, one of my security guys for four or five years.
[01:50:45.484 --> 01:50:47.766]  Mike sat there and listened to people.
[01:50:49.255 --> 01:50:57.859]  Under the palm trees, under the cabana, talk about me while I was out there throwing the football and playing for four or five hours a day with my daughter, building sandcastles.
[01:50:57.859 --> 01:51:01.881]  And over and over again, they said, I used to think he was a bad guy, a liar.
[01:51:01.881 --> 01:51:02.542]  He's right.
[01:51:02.542 --> 01:51:03.702]  He's a good guy.
[01:51:03.702 --> 01:51:04.543]  I used to be a liberal.
[01:51:04.543 --> 01:51:05.743]  I used to be a Democrat.
[01:51:05.743 --> 01:51:06.784]  What do we do?
[01:51:06.784 --> 01:51:14.928]  He heard all these people, including the Mexicans that were working at the resort saying Alejandro Jones is right.
[01:51:17.059 --> 01:51:18.400]  And my wife speaks pretty good Spanish.
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:19.700]  She was talking to him.
[01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:23.322]  Even in Mexico, folks, people are awake.
[01:51:23.322 --> 01:51:25.563]  I mean, they're already awake to a lot of stuff, but they know Alex Jones.
[01:51:25.563 --> 01:51:30.145]  I mean, so I only report that to you, again, not to say, Oh, I'm famous.
[01:51:30.145 --> 01:51:31.005]  Oh, I'm a big fish.
[01:51:31.005 --> 01:51:31.686]  Oh, I'm important.
[01:51:31.686 --> 01:51:34.047]  No, it's the opposite of that.
[01:51:34.047 --> 01:51:37.148]  The level of love is so intense.
[01:51:37.148 --> 01:51:38.869]  That is a major barometer.
[01:51:41.309 --> 01:51:44.250]  On what their attacks have done, and what their demonization has done.
[01:51:44.250 --> 01:51:49.852]  Because people know when they see the system attacking us, and coming after us, they know the system's bad.
[01:51:49.852 --> 01:51:51.252]  They've turned against the system.
[01:51:51.252 --> 01:51:56.594]  It's not about loving Alex Jones, or Mike Lindell, or Tucker Carlson.
[01:51:56.594 --> 01:51:57.995]  We're just people that love freedom like you.
[01:51:57.995 --> 01:51:58.655]  We're just like you.
[01:51:58.655 --> 01:52:03.077]  We don't want to hurt people, or have world government, or Satanism, or fentanyl deaths, or crime.
[01:52:03.077 --> 01:52:04.897]  I mean, we have children.
[01:52:04.897 --> 01:52:10.079]  We want prosperity, and justice, and security, and freedom, and everything else that comes with it.
[01:52:11.994 --> 01:52:24.029]  And to have been on air 28 years and experience this and now see almost universal acceptance is very exciting.
[01:52:24.958 --> 01:52:30.460]  I saw a few left to shake in their head and they wouldn't say anything and they were just totally freaked out at the airport and things like that.
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:39.805]  And when I came back, they flagged me in the system and my wife and family went through and customs and they said, we're supposed to search you and you should do a FOIA request.
[01:52:39.805 --> 01:52:40.705]  We don't think this is right.
[01:52:40.705 --> 01:52:41.145]  You can go.
[01:52:41.145 --> 01:52:44.367]  We're not going to search you, Mr. Jones.
[01:52:44.367 --> 01:52:49.689]  That was human intelligence overriding what they'd been ordered to do to me.
[01:52:50.851 --> 01:52:51.632]  They were shaking their heads.
[01:52:51.632 --> 01:52:52.433]  They were pretty upset.
[01:52:52.433 --> 01:52:56.018]  Whatever it is they were supposed to do to me, probably a strip search.
[01:52:56.018 --> 01:52:59.182]  But, it didn't happen.
[01:52:59.182 --> 01:53:01.185]  Because the humans on the ground knew it was wrong.
[01:53:02.099 --> 01:53:03.800]  And that's the Fight Club nature of this.
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:08.321]  It's like Tyler Durgan is going around everywhere and we're like, yes, Mr. Durgan, we're in on it with you.
[01:53:08.321 --> 01:53:10.082]  Yes, we're going to fight this with you.
[01:53:10.082 --> 01:53:15.024]  That's kind of a leftist dream of their communist revolution, but it's not happening for them.
[01:53:15.024 --> 01:53:16.184]  They don't have the thinkers.
[01:53:16.184 --> 01:53:17.285]  They don't have the good people.
[01:53:17.285 --> 01:53:18.825]  They've got the mindless drones.
[01:53:18.825 --> 01:53:21.526]  But in my life, it's like Fight Club.
[01:53:21.526 --> 01:53:25.908]  So I want listeners to know when you feel alone and you feel down and you feel like people aren't listening to you,
[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:33.964]  In the real world, where the rubber meets the road, the public is really awake right now.
[01:53:33.964 --> 01:53:37.327]  And the enemy knows that, and it's gone into full panic mode.
[01:53:37.327 --> 01:53:44.932]  So this stack of news I talked about earlier, I'm going to cover it with Roger Stone first when he comes on, and then get into politics after that.
[01:53:44.932 --> 01:53:48.014]  But this is so big, this UN treaty.
[01:53:48.014 --> 01:53:55.519]  And then Bloomberg last night comes out and says, okay, Pfizer admits their shots causing strokes.
[01:53:57.125 --> 01:54:01.567]  Well, it's really causing heart attacks and myocarditis way above strokes, but they're admitting the strokes.
[01:54:01.567 --> 01:54:03.067]  How big a deal is that?
[01:54:03.067 --> 01:54:04.288]  Why would they do that?
[01:54:04.288 --> 01:54:07.609]  Because they know they can't contain it anymore.
[01:54:07.609 --> 01:54:18.793]  And that's because of the scientists and the doctors and the nurses and the medical workers and the whistleblowers and the general public spreading the word that their whole house of cards to take control of our body is coming down.
[01:54:18.793 --> 01:54:25.716]  In fact, let's play Tedris, the head of the World Health Organization, last night, saying their main mission
[01:54:26.701 --> 01:54:31.423]  And their call for action is to shut down people questioning us.
[01:54:31.423 --> 01:54:33.283]  But everything they said was a lie.
[01:54:33.283 --> 01:54:34.724]  So again, they're hitting the panic button.
[01:54:34.724 --> 01:54:38.445]  And it doesn't mean we're winning this war.
[01:54:38.445 --> 01:54:40.686]  But the enemy thinks they're losing.
[01:54:40.686 --> 01:54:41.646]  So I'm not God.
[01:54:41.646 --> 01:54:43.667]  I don't have omnipresence or anything close to it.
[01:54:43.667 --> 01:54:45.828]  I'm not sure whether we're winning or losing.
[01:54:45.828 --> 01:54:46.488]  But I know this.
[01:54:46.488 --> 01:54:47.828]  We're fighting back.
[01:54:47.828 --> 01:54:51.790]  And at least the enemy's scared.
[01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:52.550]  Here's the head of the UN.
[01:54:54.062 --> 01:55:01.084]  We'll call for action from everyone with influence on the spread of mis and disinformation on the Internet.
[01:55:01.084 --> 01:55:07.945]  Governments, regulators, policy makers, technology companies, the media, civil society.
[01:55:07.945 --> 01:55:09.906]  Stop the hate.
[01:55:09.906 --> 01:55:12.366]  Set up strong guardrails.
[01:55:12.366 --> 01:55:15.027]  Be accountable for language that causes harm.
[01:55:16.215 --> 01:55:26.800]  And as part of my report to our Common Agenda, we are convening all stakeholders around the Code of Conduct for Information Integrity on Digital Platforms.
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:35.605]  And we'll also further strengthen our focus on how MIS and disinformation are impacting progress on global issues, including the climate crisis.
[01:55:37.222 --> 01:55:40.305]  So, and by the way, there's so many of these clips, I confuse it.
[01:55:40.305 --> 01:55:43.969]  We have a WHO head saying that as well.
[01:55:43.969 --> 01:55:45.590]  That's the Secretary General saying it.
[01:55:45.590 --> 01:55:46.992]  So, that's what I'm saying.
[01:55:46.992 --> 01:55:54.879]  They are hitting the panic button and saying the UN has to regulate, the UN has to centralize.
[01:55:54.879 --> 01:55:58.643]  That's Antonio Gutierrez, Secretary General of the UN.
[01:55:58.643 --> 01:56:01.426]  So they are in full retreat right now.
[01:56:02.751 --> 01:56:03.955]  And saying we're lying.
[01:56:03.955 --> 01:56:06.324]  No, we said it caused heart attacks and strokes.
[01:56:06.324 --> 01:56:07.668]  We said it caused blood clots.
[01:56:07.668 --> 01:56:08.752]  And now it's confirmed.
[01:56:10.267 --> 01:56:12.509]  And their only hope is to shut us up?
[01:56:12.509 --> 01:56:20.415]  That's not going to work no matter... You can try to take out an Alex Jones or a Tucker Carlson or a General Flynn, but you're not taking everybody out.
[01:56:20.415 --> 01:56:30.182]  And that's why the average woman or man, black, white, old, young, doesn't matter, wherever you are, is so powerful when you share articles and share videos and circumvent the AI.
[01:56:30.182 --> 01:56:33.905]  You're defeating the enemy's greatest push.
[01:56:33.905 --> 01:56:35.466]  We're going to go to break.
[01:56:35.466 --> 01:56:38.748]  Very powerful clip from Stu Peters that I want to play next segment.
[01:56:40.276 --> 01:56:42.637]  Roger Stone joins us.
[01:56:42.637 --> 01:56:44.938]  I haven't even plugged this yet today, my goodness.
[01:56:44.938 --> 01:56:46.279]  Today is the last day.
[01:56:46.279 --> 01:56:48.159]  I mean, I might extend it one day because I'm so busy.
[01:56:48.159 --> 01:56:50.901]  I have to come up with new sales and we're almost sold out of everything.
[01:56:50.901 --> 01:57:03.126]  But today is the last day to get up to 50% off on the Alex Jones was right super special at InfoWarsTore.com on immune support, RainForce Plus and RainForce Ultra, multi-food, multivitamin, vitamin C with zinc.
[01:57:03.646 --> 01:57:03.906]  I think so.

[01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:24.531]  Real red pill, plus 50% off.

[01:57:39.297 --> 01:57:40.118]  It's all there.
[01:57:40.118 --> 01:57:43.419]  Ultimate Bone Broth, back in stock, doing improved and updated.
[01:57:43.419 --> 01:57:44.760]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:57:50.566 --> 01:57:53.707]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:57:53.707 --> 01:57:56.007]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:57:56.007 --> 01:57:59.948]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:57:59.948 --> 01:58:08.870]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:15.752]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[01:58:15.752 --> 01:58:16.652]  It's really just incredible.
[01:58:17.691 --> 01:58:21.332]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:58:21.332 --> 01:58:27.114]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:58:27.114 --> 01:58:28.054]  I know you spread the word.
[01:58:28.054 --> 01:58:28.974]  I know you pray for us.
[01:58:28.974 --> 01:58:29.574]  That's wonderful.
[01:58:29.574 --> 01:58:30.135]  Keep doing it.
[01:58:30.135 --> 01:58:37.197]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:58:37.197 --> 01:58:38.377]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:58:39.097 --> 01:58:43.379]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:43.379 --> 01:58:48.321]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWars.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:58:48.321 --> 01:58:49.122]  Please take action now.
[01:58:58.806 --> 01:59:06.591]  All of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost for selling it to you.
[01:59:06.591 --> 01:59:07.772]  These are high-end.
[01:59:07.772 --> 01:59:09.173]  These are the very best.
[01:59:09.173 --> 01:59:11.655]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[01:59:11.655 --> 01:59:12.175]  Well, guess what?
[01:59:12.175 --> 01:59:17.919]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[01:59:17.919 --> 01:59:19.941]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[01:59:20.581 --> 01:59:27.444]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality, full-spectrum CBD.
[01:59:27.444 --> 01:59:32.646]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:32.646 --> 01:59:42.690]  The highest quality, directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50%, in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[01:59:42.690 --> 01:59:44.691]  InfoWars MD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:50.959 --> 01:59:55.602]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:55.602 --> 02:00:06.550]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:14.335]  We've talked a lot on this program about how the world that we live in today is really just the empire of lies.
[02:00:14.335 --> 02:00:18.998]  The self-appointed ruling elites have lied for decades, maybe even centuries, about virtually everything.
[02:00:20.023 --> 02:00:24.965]  In more recent times, some of those lies that we were told were some of the biggest lies you could ever wrap your head around.
[02:00:24.965 --> 02:00:47.853]  We've been lied to about the assassination of a sitting president, JFK, the circumstances surrounding the death of Princess Di, the causes of wars in Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan, weapons of mass destruction, supposed Islamic terrorists responsible for 9-11, the Obama red line in Syria, the Benghazi embassy, the ruthless boogeyman Vladimir Putin just waking up one day deciding to go and conquer Ukraine, totally unprovoked.
[02:00:47.853 --> 02:00:49.214]  He's a war criminal, they tell us.
[02:00:50.233 --> 02:01:00.840]  Well, meanwhile, Ukrainian Azov battalion, literal Nazis, shoot innocents trying to flee, recruit non-military fighters, and literally eat opposition soldiers.
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:03.341]  We've been lied to about the actual events of these wars.
[02:01:03.341 --> 02:01:06.083]  The Ghost of Kiev, the bombing of maternity wards.
[02:01:06.083 --> 02:01:13.808]  And now we're learning in the last couple of days about child organ harvesting that Russian troops just discovered taking place in Ukraine.
[02:01:13.808 --> 02:01:18.691]  Lies about COVID-19, its origins, the bioweapon injection being a safe and effective vaccine.
[02:01:19.625 --> 02:01:43.875]  We've exposed the lies about the medical-industrial complex, deadly hospital protocols and treatments, when the truth is, these for-profit hospitals and clinics have been killing for cash, murdering for money for decades, using poisonous drugs and damaging serums, venoms, and injections that cause the breakdown of immune systems, kick-start inflammation, lead innocent Americans to an early grave, all for the almighty dollar and the quest for power, control, and status.
[02:01:45.848 --> 02:01:47.108]  This is all true.
[02:01:47.108 --> 02:01:54.530]  The criminal fake news media tells us lies about a sitting president, Donald Trump, colluding with Russia, a violent insurrection.
[02:01:54.530 --> 02:01:56.870]  Oh, and a supposed pee tape.
[02:01:56.870 --> 02:02:08.233]  And anyone that points out or broadcasts or publishes the truth about any of these things is a far-right shock jock, or a white supremacist, an extremist Christian nationalist, or a conspiracy theorist, of course.
[02:02:09.537 --> 02:02:26.154]  The enemy pays billions of dollars to major broadcasts and cable news networks to brainwash and propagandize and program and repeat and gaslight the viewing audience consisting of hundreds of millions of clueless victims, in many cases leading them directly to their death.
[02:02:26.154 --> 02:02:27.696]  We aren't conspiracy theorists.
[02:02:27.696 --> 02:02:29.097]  No, not at all.
[02:02:29.097 --> 02:02:30.579]  And telling big lies isn't new.
[02:02:31.607 --> 02:02:38.673]  The Jewish Virtual Library points this out, quote, If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.
[02:02:38.673 --> 02:02:48.220]  The lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political, economic, and or military consequences of the lie.
[02:02:48.220 --> 02:03:00.670]  It thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus, by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the state.
[02:03:02.830 --> 02:03:08.693]  This is why slaveholders refuse to allow their slaves the ability to learn to read or write.
[02:03:08.693 --> 02:03:19.340]  The Jewish Virtual Library continues, quote, The broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily.
[02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:26.224]  And thus, in the primitive simplicity of their minds, they're more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie.
[02:03:27.358 --> 02:03:34.662]  Since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters, but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.
[02:03:34.662 --> 02:03:44.467]  It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously.
[02:03:44.467 --> 02:03:55.373]  Even though the facts, which prove this to be so, may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation."
[02:03:58.783 --> 02:04:07.152]  Let me ask you, which one of those words that I just read from the Jewish Virtual Library are not true?
[02:04:07.152 --> 02:04:09.214]  All of this sounds objectively true.
[02:04:09.214 --> 02:04:14.620]  Who among us that's being completely objective and bare naked honest could disagree with any of those words?
[02:04:16.971 --> 02:04:32.320]  For the last two years, both fake political sides of the aisle have been fighting to own the definition of the term, the big lie, in an effort to control the narrative and conceal from the public what the big lie actually is.
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:33.901]  And the big lie is this.
[02:04:33.901 --> 02:04:46.168]  We have a corporate government crime syndicate, public and private sectors colluding with one another and the media, in an effort to lock the entire population of the planet into virtual, digital and real life prisons.
[02:04:48.342 --> 02:04:50.329]  What we've just described here is fascism!
[02:04:59.557 --> 02:05:01.958]  Cavalry has arrived.
[02:05:01.958 --> 02:05:15.366]  Ultimate Bone Broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken-based bone broth you're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart, but more importantly, your immune system.
[02:05:15.366 --> 02:05:17.648]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[02:05:17.648 --> 02:05:22.691]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with chaga mushroom and
[02:05:23.311 --> 02:05:26.755]  A whole bunch of other ingredients like turmeric, the list goes on and on.
[02:05:26.755 --> 02:05:33.983]  This is definitely the strongest, best bone broth out there and your purchase supports the MFO or a 360 win.
[02:05:33.983 --> 02:05:37.567]  If you've not experienced bone broth, even the regular ones have great effects.

[02:06:01.374 --> 02:06:04.016]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:04.016 --> 02:06:14.525]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:14.525 --> 02:06:20.250]  Well, joining us to cover the waterfront in the next hour is the great Roger Stone.
[02:06:20.250 --> 02:06:22.652]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:22.652 --> 02:06:27.677]  And Roger, I want to cover the weapons platform balloon, Trump-DeSantis, bank
[02:06:28.737 --> 02:06:34.082]  Well, I'm still in shock about the American response to this Chinese surveillance balloon.
[02:06:50.376 --> 02:07:00.303]  I mean, it seems to me that we've learned nothing about the lessons of history, that weakness is what promotes aggression and war.
[02:07:00.303 --> 02:07:13.173]  And now suddenly the Biden administration says, without any evidence or proof whatsoever, that a Chinese surveillance balloon entered American airspace
[02:07:13.753 --> 02:07:17.696]  Twice or maybe it's three times during the Trump presidency.
[02:07:17.696 --> 02:07:34.108]  Even Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, who was fired by Trump, who's most definitely not a Trump fan or supporter, denies that he ever had any knowledge or was ever informed by anyone in the military that that was the case.
[02:07:34.108 --> 02:07:36.870]  And of course, the Biden administration offers no proof.
[02:07:36.870 --> 02:07:37.971]  It's just a talking point.
[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:48.403]  They're clearly trying to get rid of Biden right now.
[02:07:48.403 --> 02:08:11.694]  I have said this on your show and on my own show, The Stone Zone, that I really think that those who really are running the country, the global elites who are running the country, with whom former President Barack Obama has a disproportionate amount of influence, have decided that Joe Biden is dispensable.
[02:08:12.542 --> 02:08:30.730]  That between the coming investigations into the corruption by his son, his brother, and himself, and record gas prices, record food shortages, record inflation, and a disastrously weak
[02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:33.112]  Who is his replacement?
[02:08:57.651 --> 02:09:04.038]  Well, the question is who is his immediate replacement and who is his ultimate replacement.
[02:09:04.038 --> 02:09:18.395]  I think most people who watch the show understand that if he resigned, let's just say hypothetically elected to resign tomorrow, maybe after pardoning himself and his son and his brother,
[02:09:19.355 --> 02:09:25.360]  Then Kamala Harris, the Vice President, would automatically be President of the United States.
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:27.081]  By the way, there is no swearing in.
[02:09:27.081 --> 02:09:35.808]  That famous picture of LBJ on Air Force One being sworn in, all theatrics, completely legally unnecessary.
[02:09:35.808 --> 02:09:48.677]  A way for LBJ to twist the knife in Bobby Kennedy, and also by having the widow, Kennedy, standing next to him, get the imprimatur of the Kennedy dynasty on his presidency.
[02:09:49.357 --> 02:09:55.019]  But she would immediately become president upon Joe Biden's resignation.
[02:09:55.019 --> 02:10:13.463]  The other possibility, because Joe is a very, very stubborn guy, as is his wife, if he refused to resign, but really could no longer fulfill the functions or responsibilities of the office, well then he could be removed under the 25th Amendment.
[02:10:13.923 --> 02:10:20.849]  That requires a majority of the cabinet plus the sitting vice president.
[02:10:20.849 --> 02:10:31.739]  While her self-interest would be extraordinarily clear, and I would argue that Barack Obama could line up a majority of the cabinet in an afternoon round of phone calls.
[02:10:31.739 --> 02:10:39.106]  So I still think that if things get bad enough and they're headed in that direction, that may well happen.
[02:10:39.426 --> 02:10:41.408]  What do you think is really going on with Kamala Harris?
[02:10:41.408 --> 02:10:51.476]  Because she was dumb in the campaign, but now, I don't just watch clips of her, I watch her speeches, and she looks like she's on 3 or 4 Xanax and has a bottle of vodka.
[02:10:51.476 --> 02:10:54.378]  I mean, she doesn't know what planet she's on.
[02:10:54.378 --> 02:10:57.821]  Would the establishment actually allow her in that position?
[02:10:57.821 --> 02:10:59.743]  Or is she such a puppet they think they can control her?
[02:11:00.985 --> 02:11:03.808]  I think that they really have no choice.
[02:11:03.808 --> 02:11:08.292]  They've positioned her here, and therefore she would rise to the presidency.
[02:11:08.292 --> 02:11:12.076]  But that doesn't mean that she either would be a candidate for re-election.
[02:11:12.903 --> 02:11:37.028]  Within the dynamics of the Democratic Party, the only way you could replace a woman of color is with another woman of color, which is why I have said on the show multiple times that I thought Michelle Obama would not only be a formidable candidate for president, but ultimately will be their candidate.
[02:11:37.028 --> 02:11:39.089]  So you think they're really going to bring forward Big Mike?
[02:11:41.465 --> 02:11:45.587]  I think that she would be their strongest candidate.
[02:11:45.587 --> 02:11:51.551]  She's not out doing all these book signings and these voter registration tours for her health.
[02:11:51.551 --> 02:11:54.193]  She certainly doesn't need money.
[02:11:54.193 --> 02:12:04.680]  And collectively, I think the Democratic Party leaders know that she's an infinitely stronger candidate than Vice President Kamala Harris.
[02:12:05.642 --> 02:12:17.584]  Then I think they probably go to Gavin Newsom for Vice President, but that's only because Pete Buttigieg has essentially failed his audition for that position.
[02:12:17.584 --> 02:12:24.845]  For those that haven't been paying attention, I know most listeners have, the Koch brothers are coming out for DeSantis against Trump.
[02:12:24.845 --> 02:12:30.026]  I like DeSantis on many fronts, but his campaign fundraising is from elites.
[02:12:30.026 --> 02:12:32.347]  He does have the Koch brothers backing him.
[02:12:32.347 --> 02:12:34.447]  That makes me really have a concern about DeSantis.
[02:12:36.072 --> 02:12:39.333]  Well, the Koch brothers were opposed to Donald Trump in 2016.
[02:12:39.333 --> 02:12:40.794]  They weren't for him in 2020.
[02:12:40.794 --> 02:12:47.216]  So the idea, fostered by some of the media, that this is a desertion of Trump.
[02:12:47.216 --> 02:12:49.857]  And first of all, there's only one Koch brother.
[02:12:49.857 --> 02:12:52.058]  The other Koch brother has passed away.
[02:12:53.139 --> 02:13:00.847]  But they've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on politics, yet they haven't been terribly successful.
[02:13:00.847 --> 02:13:08.296]  They're strong supporters, as you know, of open borders, because they need cheap labor for their particular industries.
[02:13:08.296 --> 02:13:11.219]  So they are the quintessential globalists.
[02:13:12.459 --> 02:13:25.984]  It's amazing today, there's a New York Post editorial in which President Donald Trump begins to distance himself from Operation Warp Speed and he gets criticized for that.
[02:13:25.984 --> 02:13:27.724]  So he can't have it both ways.
[02:13:27.724 --> 02:13:30.585]  That's where I was going next.
[02:13:30.585 --> 02:13:35.267]  He's been criticizing the Santas for supporting the shots, but the Santas got out in front of that.
[02:13:35.267 --> 02:13:38.548]  I think Trump's finally figuring out what a loser these shots are.
[02:13:40.464 --> 02:13:49.709]  Well, the truth of the matter is that we had some of the most draconian lockdowns in the country here in Florida for over two years.
[02:13:49.709 --> 02:14:01.936]  And Governor DeSantis, like President Trump, was a full-throated advocate for the safety and the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination.
[02:14:01.936 --> 02:14:04.478]  And he really cannot rewrite that history.
[02:14:05.218 --> 02:14:19.051]  He made a claim that he had banned masks at a time that 3.6 million Florida school children were still actually... But in fairness, he did get off the mRNA injection bandwagon earlier than Trump.
[02:14:19.051 --> 02:14:25.637]  Slightly earlier, but neither one of them has been for mandatory injection, mandatory vaccination.
[02:14:25.637 --> 02:14:27.499]  And I think that that's an important point.
[02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:35.899]  So, I've seen ads on Fox News basically already running saying, should DeSantis run?
[02:14:35.899 --> 02:14:37.902]  Those are campaign ads to get emails.
[02:14:37.902 --> 02:14:38.904]  I mean, DeSantis is running.
[02:14:40.944 --> 02:14:51.694]  He is running, and therefore we have to see if he is held to his many campaign promises before this most recent election.
[02:14:51.694 --> 02:14:59.000]  One example that I have written about is the critical race theory curriculum back in the Florida public schools.
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:06.307]  Prior to the election, the governor said that he would ban that, yet I can tell you here in Broward County,
[02:15:06.927 --> 02:15:12.828]  The largest county in the state, the sixth largest school district in the United States.
[02:15:12.828 --> 02:15:22.531]  They have just adopted an ADL approved school curriculum that is some of the most virulent anti-white hate speech I have ever seen.
[02:15:22.531 --> 02:15:27.252]  It's my understanding that this is being done in 13 other counties.
[02:15:27.252 --> 02:15:31.793]  So it's a perfect example where the governor has to follow through.
[02:15:32.453 --> 02:15:46.940]  To his credit, I saw over the weekend that the state was revoking a liquor license for a venue that had a drag queen show that admitted children.
[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:54.104]  Now, I'm in favor of consenting adults doing whatever they want that's legal, but I'm not in favor of children, either is the governor.
[02:15:54.104 --> 02:15:54.284]  I agree.
[02:15:54.284 --> 02:15:55.405]  Stand there, Roger Stone.
[02:15:58.854 --> 02:16:03.441]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars?
[02:16:03.441 --> 02:16:05.764]  Attaching myself and the crew and our other hosts.
[02:16:06.516 --> 02:16:08.577]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[02:16:08.577 --> 02:16:10.277]  They know we're telling the truth.
[02:16:10.277 --> 02:16:11.838]  They know we've got their number.
[02:16:11.838 --> 02:16:16.579]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[02:16:16.579 --> 02:16:24.442]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[02:16:24.442 --> 02:16:34.845]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[02:16:35.891 --> 02:16:43.053]  And to give your body the key elements and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.
[02:16:43.053 --> 02:16:46.035]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.
[02:16:46.035 --> 02:16:48.395]  This is real Red Pill Plus.
[02:16:48.395 --> 02:16:50.196]  Sold out for two years.

[02:16:58.339 --> 02:17:01.480]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:03.981]  And we're so stupid, we let them kill us.
[02:17:03.981 --> 02:17:04.561]  We deserve it.
[02:17:06.544 --> 02:17:11.448]  Except children don't deserve it, do they?
[02:17:11.448 --> 02:17:31.402]  And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[02:17:31.402 --> 02:17:35.325]  Now the translation is, I looked, and behold, a pale horse,
[02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:41.117]  And his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.
[02:17:41.117 --> 02:17:43.220]  The Book of Revelation.
[02:17:45.273 --> 02:17:46.934]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[02:17:46.934 --> 02:17:48.634]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[02:17:48.634 --> 02:17:50.235]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[02:17:50.235 --> 02:17:51.576]  This is our fight.
[02:17:51.576 --> 02:17:52.916]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[02:17:52.916 --> 02:17:54.377]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[02:17:54.377 --> 02:17:58.358]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[02:17:58.358 --> 02:18:10.864]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones's film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[02:18:14.079 --> 02:18:23.906]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[02:18:23.906 --> 02:18:35.756]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:18:35.756 --> 02:18:37.277]  This is why they attack us.
[02:18:37.757 --> 02:18:40.301]  This is why we need your support.
[02:18:40.301 --> 02:18:42.083]  Because we tell the truth.
[02:18:42.083 --> 02:18:44.286]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:44.286 --> 02:18:45.728]  Join the resistance.
[02:18:45.728 --> 02:18:47.029]  Buy products.
[02:18:47.029 --> 02:18:48.832]  Donate to the cause.
[02:18:48.832 --> 02:18:50.194]  Share the links.
[02:18:50.194 --> 02:18:52.617]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[02:18:52.617 --> 02:18:54.820]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:18:58.323 --> 02:18:58.784]  We're good to go.
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:19.841]  That features natokinase.
[02:19:19.841 --> 02:19:22.181]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[02:19:22.181 --> 02:19:27.863]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[02:19:27.863 --> 02:19:28.664]  This is very important.
[02:19:28.664 --> 02:19:33.705]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[02:19:33.705 --> 02:19:35.206]  People are low with the spike protein.
[02:19:35.206 --> 02:19:36.146]  They don't feel well.
[02:19:36.146 --> 02:19:37.867]  This is a potential solution.
[02:19:37.867 --> 02:19:40.928]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[02:19:40.928 --> 02:19:43.849]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[02:19:43.849 --> 02:19:44.809]  Isn't it interesting?
[02:19:45.209 --> 02:19:51.336]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[02:19:51.336 --> 02:19:55.820]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support, and thank you for getting into that, because it's important.
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:59.524]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[02:19:59.524 --> 02:20:05.451]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:34.446 --> 02:20:36.989]  Roger Stones, our guest, here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:36.989 --> 02:20:44.277]  And I want to finish up with Trump, who's on other issues, but just in the spirit of being completely honest about this.
[02:20:47.188 --> 02:20:50.911]  It's good to have Trump and DeSantis showing who was the most anti-shot.
[02:20:50.911 --> 02:20:53.553]  It's good to have Trump coming out in news articles criticizing it now.
[02:20:53.553 --> 02:21:00.278]  Because even Bloomberg is out yesterday saying, OK, Pfizer admits the shot's causing strokes and other problems.
[02:21:00.278 --> 02:21:03.881]  So the sooner Trump gets away from this, the better.
[02:21:03.881 --> 02:21:05.802]  I like Trump coming out against China.
[02:21:05.802 --> 02:21:08.805]  I like Trump coming out against World War III.
[02:21:08.805 --> 02:21:12.047]  I mean, I know the establishment is going against Trump.
[02:21:12.047 --> 02:21:14.169]  So that's a big feather in his cap.
[02:21:14.169 --> 02:21:16.170]  But Roger, come on, the only place I could go
[02:21:17.225 --> 02:21:19.366]  Six months into the lockdown was Florida.
[02:21:19.366 --> 02:21:26.049]  I know at first DeSantis clamped down, but California was the worst, New York was the worst, to say the worst in the country.
[02:21:26.049 --> 02:21:29.030]  And I know Trump early on only wanted two weeks and he wanted to open things up.
[02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:30.931]  And I mean, I get all that.
[02:21:30.931 --> 02:21:36.433]  But I mean, really, you're not really saying DeSantis had the most draconian lockdowns in the country, are you?
[02:21:37.738 --> 02:21:38.319]  Pretty close.
[02:21:38.319 --> 02:21:39.780]  Of course, I do live here.
[02:21:39.780 --> 02:21:44.184]  But Alex, let's not pretend that COVID-19 is the only issue.
[02:21:44.184 --> 02:21:47.988]  Actually, I think there's a great piece on this at Politico today.
[02:21:47.988 --> 02:21:49.709]  I wrote a piece about it two days ago.
[02:21:49.709 --> 02:21:52.392]  I think Donald Trump is the peace candidate.
[02:21:53.012 --> 02:21:57.696]  I think that he is the only candidate who doesn't want to spend more money.
[02:21:57.696 --> 02:22:06.722]  When he keeps coming out against World War III, when DeSantis has been on the fence about it or even supporting it, that made me go back to Trump instead of DeSantis.
[02:22:06.722 --> 02:22:09.925]  I'm all about not having a nuclear war, so that's a good thing about Trump.
[02:22:11.118 --> 02:22:17.320]  Well, it won't matter if we have a COVID-19 vaccination if we're all incinerated in a world war, will it?
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:24.362]  I mean, the point here is Trump ran in 2016 as the anti-interventionist candidate.
[02:22:24.362 --> 02:22:28.984]  I really do believe if he were president today, we wouldn't have this conflict.
[02:22:29.805 --> 02:22:44.320]  This is really about pushing Ukraine to put American-funded offensive missiles on the ground in Ukraine, pointed at Russia, not to mention bioweapons labs that, yes, do exist.
[02:22:46.742 --> 02:22:54.407]  This is not about Vladimir Putin seeking to occupy Ukraine, which financially I don't even think he can do.
[02:22:54.407 --> 02:22:59.650]  Now, Putin is not a good guy, we're not saying that, but to say that this is about democracy?
[02:22:59.650 --> 02:23:00.411]  Really?
[02:23:00.411 --> 02:23:08.316]  I mean, Zelensky has outlawed all the political parties but his, has arrested all the candidates who ran against him in the last election,
[02:23:08.697 --> 02:23:14.952]  Shut down newspapers, shut down television stations, shut down radio stations, arrested journalists.
[02:23:14.952 --> 02:23:17.098]  Shut down the oldest Christian church in the world.
[02:23:18.478 --> 02:23:19.939]  I was just about to get there.
[02:23:19.939 --> 02:23:25.320]  So this is not, most definitely, not about democracy.
[02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:40.044]  And as a congressman, of course, Congressman Ron DeSantis co-signed a letter supporting the illegal coup against democracy that was pulled off by the Biden, pardon me, by the Obama administration.
[02:23:40.044 --> 02:23:41.805]  And as a governor, he hasn't
[02:23:42.405 --> 02:23:48.711]  He hasn't had to tell us where does he stand in terms of spending more money in Ukraine.
[02:23:48.711 --> 02:23:52.574]  Look, Eisenhower was elected by saying he would end the war in Korea.
[02:23:52.574 --> 02:23:55.998]  Nixon was elected by saying he would end the war in Vietnam.
[02:23:55.998 --> 02:24:00.782]  Ultimately, I think Trump will be elected by saying he will end the war in Ukraine.
[02:24:00.782 --> 02:24:04.165]  And he is the guy who cut off the Russian pipeline.
[02:24:04.165 --> 02:24:07.248]  He is the guy who sold offensive weapons to the Ukrainians.
[02:24:07.828 --> 02:24:11.591]  Uh, that the Obama administration would, uh, not sell.
[02:24:11.591 --> 02:24:15.334]  The idea that he is pro-Russian, I think we've seen this movie.
[02:24:15.334 --> 02:24:16.214]  It's a joke.
[02:24:16.214 --> 02:24:17.155]  It's total crap.
[02:24:17.155 --> 02:24:18.876]  In fact, let's talk about that.
[02:24:18.876 --> 02:24:23.920]  The Russiagate hoax, now we have major, even liberal major publications coming out.
[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:27.363]  Major Democrat think tanks admitting Russiagate was a hoax.
[02:24:27.363 --> 02:24:30.365]  They dropped the fake lawsuit against you on January 6th.
[02:24:30.365 --> 02:24:34.848]  Where has that whole fraud gone, and what is the Democrat deep state going to do next to try to
[02:24:36.554 --> 02:24:52.323]  Stunning three-piece set in the Columbia Journalism Review by Jeff Gerth, who is one of the most respected and toughest investigative reporters in American history.
[02:24:52.323 --> 02:24:55.065]  Certainly no conservative, certainly no Trump supporter.
[02:24:55.825 --> 02:24:57.146]  I finished it last night.
[02:24:57.146 --> 02:24:58.907]  It is devastating.
[02:24:58.907 --> 02:25:15.175]  It proves that those in the CIA and the FBI knew that the Steele dossier was a fraud and that they did principally use it to justify the Mueller investigation and the illegal FISA warrants on Trump supporters.
[02:25:15.935 --> 02:25:31.363]  Where Mr. Girth did not go, and I think he should have, is he just accepts at straight value the continued claim that Russian intelligence hacked the Democratic National Committee, that they were the target of an online hack.
[02:25:31.363 --> 02:25:39.707]  In my trial, the FBI was forced to admit they never investigated the DNC servers, they never inspected them.
[02:25:39.707 --> 02:25:42.449]  Sure, so where do they go next now that fraud fell apart?
[02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:44.439]  I mean, they're in deep trouble politically.
[02:25:44.439 --> 02:25:45.910]  What are they going to pull next?
[02:25:47.249 --> 02:25:50.451]  That's an excellent question, but I don't have an answer for you.
[02:25:50.451 --> 02:25:57.496]  I mean, a lot will depend on how courageous and how organized these House Republicans are.
[02:25:57.496 --> 02:26:10.584]  They have a unique opportunity to further expose the four years of censorship and cancellation between them and Elon Musk.
[02:26:10.584 --> 02:26:14.527]  The dam is now broken, and the American people are learning all kinds of things.
[02:26:14.527 --> 02:26:15.027]  I totally agree.
[02:26:16.608 --> 02:26:17.450]  I totally agree.
[02:26:17.450 --> 02:26:22.760]  And so, Republicans need to take control of the narrative with an impeachment of Joe Biden.
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:23.301]  Shouldn't that happen?
[02:26:24.629 --> 02:26:26.870]  I thought from the beginning that that should happen.
[02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:32.653]  It continues to disappoint me that Speaker McCarthy seems to oppose it.
[02:26:32.653 --> 02:26:35.074]  But, you know, that's today.
[02:26:35.074 --> 02:26:39.036]  Let's see what the Hunter Biden investigation now proves.
[02:26:39.036 --> 02:26:41.877]  What they are doing now, Alex, is very interesting.
[02:26:41.877 --> 02:26:43.478]  We've seen this before.
[02:26:43.478 --> 02:26:53.122]  In order to distract attention from the actual content of Hunter Biden's laptop, the actual details regarding corruption,
[02:26:53.903 --> 02:26:57.446]  Treason, debauchery, and so on.
[02:26:57.446 --> 02:27:04.191]  They're attempting to create a controversy about how this information became public.
[02:27:04.191 --> 02:27:07.893]  And it became public in a perfectly legal way.
[02:27:07.893 --> 02:27:15.479]  John Paul MacIsaac, the computer repair technician... Sure, the crackhead's carelessness did this.
[02:27:16.653 --> 02:27:31.087]  But that's not what you would believe based on the letter written by his lawyer, Abby Lowell, to the Attorney General of Delaware, to the US Attorney of Delaware, to the Assistant Attorney General.
[02:27:31.087 --> 02:27:34.310]  So this is an effort to try to shift the focus.
[02:27:34.310 --> 02:27:35.531]  We've heard this before.
[02:27:35.531 --> 02:27:36.773]  Don't focus on Hillary's
[02:27:37.293 --> 02:27:39.675]  How bad did Biden's dithering on this giant Chinese spy balloon hurt him?
[02:28:04.978 --> 02:28:06.079]  I think very badly.
[02:28:06.079 --> 02:28:17.471]  I have not seen any new polling, but I think most Americans understand that the statements putting out saying, well, it's not doing any harm, so we're not going to shoot it down.
[02:28:17.471 --> 02:28:19.153]  How do we know what it's doing?
[02:28:19.153 --> 02:28:22.477]  I mean, what's really surprising is it seems to me, and I'm not an expert,
[02:28:23.078 --> 02:28:29.562]  But experts I have talked to say that the Chinese have far, far more sophisticated technology.
[02:28:29.562 --> 02:28:43.332]  So you almost wonder whether this was a willful provocation or an act of propaganda, or whether they really think that they could use a balloon to deliver some kind of nuclear device.
[02:28:44.252 --> 02:28:46.453]  Well that's what they brag about as the EMP.
[02:28:46.453 --> 02:28:53.135]  Let's come back and talk about the censorship battle and Elon Musk with the great Roger Stone straight ahead.
[02:28:53.135 --> 02:28:58.417]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:58.417 --> 02:29:01.258]  I just want to say about Diet Force.
[02:29:01.258 --> 02:29:03.879]  Diet Force is amazing.
[02:29:03.879 --> 02:29:05.340]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[02:29:05.340 --> 02:29:08.681]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[02:29:08.681 --> 02:29:11.182]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[02:29:12.831 --> 02:29:17.615]  Under my peck, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[02:29:17.615 --> 02:29:19.837]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[02:29:20.996 --> 02:29:23.859]  Like, chip shake for the ladies, mate.
[02:29:23.859 --> 02:29:26.020]  Diet Force is the go.
[02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:28.923]  You have to get the Diet Force and have it to a day.
[02:29:28.923 --> 02:29:30.564]  And just keep at it.
[02:29:30.564 --> 02:29:32.186]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:29:58.015 --> 02:30:02.780]  The second American revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[02:30:02.780 --> 02:30:07.986]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[02:30:07.986 --> 02:30:12.832]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[02:30:12.832 --> 02:30:17.176]  Now in the last year we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[02:30:17.757 --> 02:30:27.480]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission, and you get a historical memento, so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[02:30:27.480 --> 02:30:40.283]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now, while supplies last, at 1776coin.com.
[02:30:40.283 --> 02:30:43.344]  And just like an NPR pledge drive, where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt,
[02:30:43.644 --> 02:30:44.485]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered.
[02:30:44.485 --> 02:30:46.326]  And InfoWars has been the tip of spear against tyranny.
[02:30:46.326 --> 02:30:49.849]  And when it comes to products we sell to fund our operation, they're just like our news and information.

[02:32:01.345 --> 02:32:04.168]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[02:32:04.168 --> 02:32:06.891]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[02:32:06.891 --> 02:32:08.172]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[02:32:08.172 --> 02:32:12.076]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[02:32:12.076 --> 02:32:16.982]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[02:32:17.262 --> 02:32:23.445]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[02:32:23.445 --> 02:32:32.068]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[02:32:32.068 --> 02:32:37.751]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[02:32:37.751 --> 02:32:43.173]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[02:32:43.413 --> 02:32:45.894]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[02:32:45.894 --> 02:32:48.576]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[02:32:48.576 --> 02:32:50.077]  So go check out the store.

[02:32:54.139 --> 02:32:59.582]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[02:32:59.582 --> 02:33:04.184]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:04.184 --> 02:33:05.485]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:09.724 --> 02:33:16.891]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.891 --> 02:33:22.136]  Alright, I'd say to Roger Stone, give us the 35,000 foot, give us the others.
[02:33:22.136 --> 02:33:22.717]  Surveillance.
[02:33:24.411 --> 02:33:24.951]  It's a tinderbox.
[02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:59.025]  President Biden himself said weeks ago that he couldn't give a particular type of tank to the Ukrainians that it would mean World War III.
[02:33:59.025 --> 02:34:01.246]  He's now sending them those tanks.
[02:34:01.246 --> 02:34:08.069]  He's now sending them Patriot missiles, which is a huge boondoggle for Raytheon.
[02:34:08.069 --> 02:34:13.992]  They have a long history of unreliability, but they're very, very, very expensive.
[02:34:14.332 --> 02:34:17.553]  So I think we are flirting with World War III.
[02:34:17.553 --> 02:34:25.935]  This is why I come back to my argument before, which is Trump's greatest opportunity here is to emerge as the peace candidate.
[02:34:25.935 --> 02:34:40.619]  He is the one candidate, given his track record of getting a peace that nobody said he could do in the Middle East, given his track record of getting this lunatic in North Korea to step down from his nuclear weapons development program,
[02:34:41.079 --> 02:34:56.663]  Given his track record, as I said earlier, shutting down the Russian pipeline, selling or giving offensive weapons to Ukraine, tough to say he's a Russian stooge under those circumstances, wouldn't you say?
[02:34:56.663 --> 02:35:05.905]  Let me expand on that, because I totally agree with you that DeSantis is being pro-war, and that's a big problem, and when Trump says he can end this in a couple hours,
[02:35:06.465 --> 02:35:07.866]  I know what Trump would do.
[02:35:07.866 --> 02:35:08.486]  With U.S.
[02:35:08.486 --> 02:35:19.353]  power as a president, he would have the power to cut off funding if Zelensky didn't make a deal to not join NATO and to give Russians some of those areas that are basically 99% Russian just on the border.
[02:35:19.353 --> 02:35:23.736]  This would all end, Putin would save face, and the world would not be in this much danger.
[02:35:23.736 --> 02:35:26.358]  I think that's probably what Trump would do, correct?
[02:35:27.714 --> 02:35:28.695]  Well, we'd be guessing.
[02:35:28.695 --> 02:35:34.781]  I mean, Trump would be a fool to blurt out to the entire country his plan, because then his plan would not be workable.
[02:35:34.781 --> 02:35:39.765]  Then the folks in the Biden State Department start working against such a plan.
[02:35:39.765 --> 02:35:42.848]  But I think you've got a pretty good guess there.
[02:35:42.848 --> 02:35:50.635]  I mean, he hasn't divulged to me what his plan is, but he understands that you don't end the war by giving them more money.
[02:35:50.635 --> 02:35:53.378]  You end the war by cutting the money off.
[02:35:54.247 --> 02:35:58.393]  And also, you know, he's got to, he's got to allow Putin.
[02:35:58.393 --> 02:35:59.535]  Well, yeah, let's make no mistake.
[02:35:59.535 --> 02:36:00.096]  The U.S.
[02:36:00.096 --> 02:36:03.001]  is run by globalists, but it's in charge of the world pretty much.
[02:36:03.001 --> 02:36:07.408]  So if he was president, obviously this would never have happened because Putin would have been scared of Trump and wouldn't have done it.
[02:36:08.806 --> 02:36:12.429]  Well, we've still got to keep an eye on the Chinese and Taiwan.
[02:36:12.429 --> 02:36:16.531]  I mean, they see our weakness on the balloon.
[02:36:16.531 --> 02:36:19.173]  They see our weakness in Afghanistan.
[02:36:19.173 --> 02:36:24.557]  They see our weakness in Eastern Europe.
[02:36:24.557 --> 02:36:26.858]  These things are provocative.
[02:36:26.858 --> 02:36:32.642]  And they would never move on Taiwan if Donald Trump were president.
[02:36:32.642 --> 02:36:33.523]  Not a chance.
[02:36:33.903 --> 02:36:37.385]  So his best chance is to run as the peace candidate.
[02:36:37.385 --> 02:36:43.147]  Well, let's talk about that because all the polls show he'd win by huge percentage points right now, despite election fraud.
[02:36:43.147 --> 02:36:45.008]  It's just a tsunami they can't defeat.
[02:36:45.008 --> 02:36:45.989]  They're in full panic mode.
[02:36:45.989 --> 02:36:48.010]  I saw ABC News Sunday panicking.
[02:36:48.010 --> 02:36:49.410]  I mean, it looks like he'll be the nominee.
[02:36:49.410 --> 02:36:50.371]  He'll probably win.
[02:36:50.371 --> 02:36:54.693]  What are they going to do to stop that A and B if he gets in?
[02:36:54.693 --> 02:37:00.616]  I think it will be a more awake, galvanized Trump this time going after the deep state.
[02:37:00.616 --> 02:37:01.396]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:37:02.814 --> 02:37:03.374]  Absolutely.
[02:37:03.374 --> 02:37:15.718]  I think the Trump you see running is going to be more like the 2015-2016 Trump that you met, Alex, rather than the incumbent with the trappings of the Republican establishment around him.
[02:37:15.718 --> 02:37:20.860]  And therefore, I think he's a lot freer to run a guerrilla-style campaign.
[02:37:21.861 --> 02:37:35.616]  Many people are not paying attention to these terrific issue videos that he's been putting out on True Social and I really wish he would go to Twitter where he now has the right to go where he could reach millions of more people.
[02:37:36.317 --> 02:37:37.558]  We're good to go.
[02:37:53.359 --> 02:37:55.180]  Well, let's see what he does tomorrow.
[02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:57.561]  I mean, he can go back at any time.
[02:37:57.561 --> 02:38:13.350]  But if you saw the best of these last week, he was saying that as president, he would end the Chinese ability to own any ranchland, farmland, harbor, airport, bridge, tunnel, roadway, highway.
[02:38:13.350 --> 02:38:14.071]  Yeah, they should know.
[02:38:14.071 --> 02:38:16.072]  No foreign government should own critical infrastructure.
[02:38:17.014 --> 02:38:22.863]  Well, but the point of course is that any Chinese national who owns land in this country, that is the government.
[02:38:22.863 --> 02:38:26.148]  There's no private property rights in China.
[02:38:26.148 --> 02:38:28.472]  That was a threat to kill your family if you don't do what they say.
[02:38:29.825 --> 02:38:34.850]  You can't just say, well, he's a Chinese citizen, he's not the Chinese government.
[02:38:34.850 --> 02:38:37.853]  Everything belongs to the Chinese government.
[02:38:37.853 --> 02:38:44.600]  Canada, by the way, won't let foreign nationals own any real estate whatsoever in Canada.
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:46.842]  That's hardly a right-wing government, to say the least.
[02:38:47.262 --> 02:39:02.683]  So, I think that Trump has demonstrated, again, he will be tougher on the Chinese than he even was in his first term, where he forced them to pay billions and billions of dollars and ope up some of their markets to our products.
[02:39:02.683 --> 02:39:04.145]  All right, let's shift gears into censorship.
[02:39:04.145 --> 02:39:04.686]  You mentioned it.
[02:39:06.239 --> 02:39:11.223]  Look, I don't trust Musk as far as I can throw him, but more and more he's doing bold stuff.
[02:39:11.223 --> 02:39:13.785]  He reinstated you, he reinstated so many others.
[02:39:13.785 --> 02:39:15.747]  He hasn't done it to me because I'm so demonized.
[02:39:15.747 --> 02:39:19.970]  I get that, but what do you think of Musk?
[02:39:19.970 --> 02:39:27.076]  You know, I'm very grateful to him, first of all, because all I did was fill out a form and send it in.
[02:39:27.076 --> 02:39:30.578]  I never dreamed that my voice would be restored.
[02:39:30.578 --> 02:39:34.962]  Since being hunted and hounded for three and a half years,
[02:39:35.762 --> 02:39:42.928]  In the Russian collusion hoax and being unable to defend yourself because you have no platform to do so.
[02:39:42.928 --> 02:39:50.413]  One of the rare exceptions is this one right here, InfoWars, where you've always let me have a voice to defend myself.
[02:39:50.413 --> 02:39:53.615]  It is refreshing to be back on Twitter.
[02:39:53.615 --> 02:39:55.817]  Now, it drives leftists crazy.
[02:39:55.817 --> 02:40:00.700]  The amount of invective and hatred that I get in the comments.
[02:40:02.061 --> 02:40:06.224]  It's the kind of stuff that in the old days, if I did, I would be banned for.
[02:40:06.224 --> 02:40:09.927]  These people, of course, will not be banned.
[02:40:09.927 --> 02:40:12.089]  But frankly, I'm in a different place now.
[02:40:12.089 --> 02:40:13.930]  I just block them and move on.
[02:40:13.930 --> 02:40:17.133]  I don't argue with anybody.
[02:40:17.133 --> 02:40:18.534]  I'm a different person than I was.
[02:40:18.534 --> 02:40:23.317]  I'm not nearly as combative and I'm much more focused on pleasing God.
[02:40:23.317 --> 02:40:26.199]  I'm much more focused on being a good Christian.
[02:40:26.199 --> 02:40:31.143]  I'm much more focused on doing what is necessary to save this nation.
[02:40:31.703 --> 02:40:35.468]  And I try to avoid petty fights with lunatics.
[02:40:35.468 --> 02:40:36.750]  By the way, I know you well.
[02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:38.753]  You were never a bad guy, but you were pretty worldly.
[02:40:38.753 --> 02:40:40.255]  You loved to get in a fight.
[02:40:40.255 --> 02:40:44.841]  You really got born again in the crucible of the fiery furnace.
[02:40:44.841 --> 02:40:47.824]  And you saw God as soon as you received Jesus Christ.
[02:40:47.824 --> 02:40:49.547]  Your fate totally turned.
[02:40:51.132 --> 02:40:54.957]  That is absolutely correct, and I understand that there is only one way.
[02:40:54.957 --> 02:40:55.758]  It is His way.
[02:40:55.758 --> 02:40:57.280]  He is the controller of all.
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:59.664]  He is the King of Kings.
[02:40:59.664 --> 02:41:04.790]  And when you say the Lord's Prayer, listen to the words you're saying, because they're vitally important.
[02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:05.792]  Vitally important.
[02:41:06.572 --> 02:41:07.492]  No, I'm not perfect.
[02:41:07.492 --> 02:41:08.793]  I'm a broken individual.
[02:41:08.793 --> 02:41:13.294]  I'm certainly a sinner, and I'm very less than perfect.
[02:41:13.294 --> 02:41:20.516]  But the Lord often calls on broken vessels, has often called on people who are not perfect to work His will.
[02:41:20.516 --> 02:41:26.138]  In fact, God, except in Jesus who was perfect, God usually calls on the broken vessel.
[02:41:26.138 --> 02:41:26.898]  Why do you think that is?
[02:41:26.898 --> 02:41:28.699]  Because I guess we've been on both sides, we know more?
[02:41:29.727 --> 02:41:32.889]  Well, maybe because he believes it's because you have been tested.
[02:41:32.889 --> 02:41:34.490]  Maybe that's what it's about.
[02:41:34.490 --> 02:41:46.016]  But, you know, I've started going to Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, a great, great, great church founded by Dr. James Kennedy, dedicated by the great Billy Graham.
[02:41:46.016 --> 02:41:47.457]  Oh man, James Kennedy, amazing.
[02:41:48.482 --> 02:41:50.964]  It's just, it's an amazing church.
[02:41:50.964 --> 02:41:53.086]  You really feel like you're at home.
[02:41:53.086 --> 02:42:03.434]  Our pastor, Rob Pacenzia, is one of the most incredible orators I've ever met, and I've seen some great speakers in my day, but he is, he's amazing.
[02:42:03.434 --> 02:42:05.016]  Just amazing.
[02:42:05.016 --> 02:42:10.020]  So, is the Holy Ghost the highest you've ever been, Roger?
[02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:11.181]  I'm not sure what you mean by that.
[02:42:11.181 --> 02:42:15.204]  Well, you're not a drug guy, you drink a few martinis, but I'm saying, is the high of Jesus not incredible?
[02:42:16.844 --> 02:42:23.510]  Once you really completely understand it, I mean, the point of course is that you have to surrender all fear to faith.
[02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:24.851]  It's not an easy thing to do.
[02:42:24.851 --> 02:42:33.539]  The two hardest things about being a Christian is, one, is downloading all fear and putting total faith in Him.
[02:42:34.379 --> 02:42:40.540]  And then secondarily, since I'm, you know, half Sicilian, in the old days, Roger Stone would want revenge.
[02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:44.781]  Revenge on anybody who tried to destroy me and my family.
[02:42:44.781 --> 02:42:50.563]  But Hebrews 10, 30 through 31, tells us, Vengeance is reserved for the Lord.
[02:42:50.563 --> 02:42:54.163]  And therefore the bad guys will get theirs, but not from me.
[02:42:54.163 --> 02:42:55.324]  God will make those just.
[02:42:55.324 --> 02:42:55.784]  That's right.
[02:42:55.784 --> 02:42:56.104]  Stay there.
[02:42:56.104 --> 02:42:56.584]  Powerful.
[02:42:56.584 --> 02:42:56.964]  Stay with us.
[02:42:59.522 --> 02:43:02.623]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:43:02.623 --> 02:43:04.944]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:43:04.944 --> 02:43:08.866]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:43:08.866 --> 02:43:17.809]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:43:17.809 --> 02:43:25.592]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:43:26.610 --> 02:43:30.251]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:43:30.251 --> 02:43:36.053]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:43:36.053 --> 02:43:39.074]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:43:39.074 --> 02:43:47.316]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:43:48.016 --> 02:43:52.321]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsware.com.
[02:43:52.321 --> 02:43:57.267]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsware.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:43:57.267 --> 02:43:58.048]  Please take action now.
[02:43:59.923 --> 02:44:05.385]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[02:44:05.385 --> 02:44:12.628]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[02:44:12.628 --> 02:44:16.149]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[02:44:16.149 --> 02:44:24.733]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[02:44:25.513 --> 02:44:33.416]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[02:44:33.416 --> 02:44:43.839]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[02:44:43.839 --> 02:44:46.580]  You will then be my slaves.
[02:44:46.580 --> 02:44:46.780]  Only.
[02:44:47.356 --> 02:44:51.225]  And then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[02:44:51.225 --> 02:44:57.279]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[02:44:58.462 --> 02:45:04.703]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[02:45:04.703 --> 02:45:13.065]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[02:45:13.065 --> 02:45:15.306]  So I thank you for your passionate support.
[02:45:15.306 --> 02:45:18.807]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin.
[02:45:18.807 --> 02:45:24.228]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time is the Teddy Roosevelt
[02:45:24.728 --> 02:45:29.614]  Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[02:45:29.614 --> 02:45:35.380]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[02:45:35.380 --> 02:45:38.984]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[02:45:38.984 --> 02:45:44.210]  The coin is a collector's item memento of your support during the Second American Revolution.
[02:45:44.750 --> 02:45:50.415]  So if you want to get one of these coins, they're going fast and you can get $30 off on the coin with promo code 1776 at 1776coin.com.
[02:45:50.415 --> 02:45:51.536]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[02:45:58.496 --> 02:46:05.699]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the rave reviews.
[02:46:05.699 --> 02:46:16.703]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States, and it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already using.
[02:46:16.703 --> 02:46:25.287]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high quality supplements, and in some cases, even better.

[02:47:36.619 --> 02:47:37.399]  Roger, you know me.
[02:47:37.399 --> 02:47:41.181]  I don't like to cover January 6th because I knew it was a fraud to begin with and we tried to stop what happened.
[02:47:41.181 --> 02:47:42.342]  We were set up.
[02:47:42.342 --> 02:47:43.122]  Same thing with the Russia game.
[02:47:43.122 --> 02:47:44.043]  But now it's all come out.
[02:47:44.043 --> 02:47:46.084]  They've dropped their fake lawsuit against you.
[02:47:46.084 --> 02:47:48.445]  The Democratic Party has.
[02:47:48.445 --> 02:47:58.810]  But they're still persecuting Joe Biggs and falsely convicting people from the Oath Keepers like Stuart Rhodes.
[02:47:58.810 --> 02:48:04.652]  And they admit it's a precedent to put any of us they want in prison anytime they want by calling us domestic terrorists.
[02:48:04.652 --> 02:48:05.613]  So what's your view on that?
[02:48:07.709 --> 02:48:29.531]  I'm, first of all, I'm gratified that the Lord answered my prayers and a federal judge last week dismissed all the charges in a civil lawsuit filed ostensibly by eight Capitol Hill police officers against President Trump and I and others, but really financed and pushed forward by some George Soros
[02:48:31.413 --> 02:48:32.854]  front group.
[02:48:32.854 --> 02:48:39.180]  As you know, Alex, I was not on the Ellipse, didn't march to the Capitol, wasn't at the Capitol, and know nothing about this.
[02:48:39.180 --> 02:48:46.006]  Any claim that I knew in advance about, participated in, or condone any illegal action is false.
[02:48:46.006 --> 02:48:49.549]  The same is true of you, because I know that.
[02:48:49.549 --> 02:48:51.071]  And therefore, I was looking at
[02:48:51.767 --> 02:49:03.111]  Tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees in a complicated civil trial which there is no evidence against me because I'm completely uninvolved.
[02:49:03.111 --> 02:49:06.793]  At the same time, I am praying for those men and women
[02:49:10.076 --> 02:49:27.055]  I don't condone any illegal action, but I think the punishment has to fit the crime, and I think that everyone's entitled to a speedy trial and due process.
[02:49:27.775 --> 02:49:41.867]  My biggest concern is that everybody who is charged with a crime needs to have competent legal representation that has their best interests and the client's best interests at heart.
[02:49:41.867 --> 02:49:51.776]  Many of these men and women are representing themselves or they are stuck with a public defender who just wants them to sign a confession and blame Donald Trump.
[02:49:51.776 --> 02:49:55.279]  So it is it's a national scandal and it is a disgrace
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:08.885]  I tell you, to see what they've done to people that were nonviolent, and to see them say it's the precedent for all of us, this is a really, really, really dangerous group.
[02:50:08.885 --> 02:50:15.848]  But it's good to see the Republicans not giving swallows well and shift committee chairmanships.
[02:50:15.848 --> 02:50:19.549]  I'm hopefully optimistic with some of the first moves I see out of McCarthy.
[02:50:19.549 --> 02:50:20.310]  I think McCarthy
[02:50:21.050 --> 02:50:25.832]  Is more like a weather vane in which way he sees the wind blow, he'll go.
[02:50:25.832 --> 02:50:28.494]  And so he sees all this populist pressure.
[02:50:28.494 --> 02:50:30.415]  And so it looks like he's starting to do some of the right things.
[02:50:30.415 --> 02:50:32.456]  What do you say?
[02:50:32.456 --> 02:50:39.680]  In the final analysis, I think, sadly, the result we got out of the election was the best possible result.
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:41.520]  You predicted it six months before.
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:48.184]  You said even better than a big majority is a tiny one, because that tiny majority of patriots will be able to control the Congress.
[02:50:49.065 --> 02:50:50.126]  And I think that is true.
[02:50:50.126 --> 02:51:01.978]  So right now, Matt Gaetz and Andy Biggs and Jim Jordan and Elise Stefanik and a handful of other patriots have disproportionate influence within the caucus.
[02:51:01.978 --> 02:51:12.428]  Had we won by 25 or 35 seats, we'd still have Nancy Pelosi's rules, we'd have King McCarthy, and none of these things would be possible.
[02:51:12.808 --> 02:51:22.616]  I think Matt Gaetz deserves enormous credit for playing his hand out the way he did, by taking a principled stand.
[02:51:22.616 --> 02:51:29.923]  And in the end, he got all of the rule changes that allow the Republican majority to be extraordinarily effective.
[02:51:29.923 --> 02:51:33.946]  So he basically neutered McCarthy?
[02:51:33.946 --> 02:51:35.047]  At any one moment.
[02:51:37.176 --> 02:51:40.720]  Five members were unhappy with McCarthy's leadership.
[02:51:40.720 --> 02:51:45.865]  Any one of them can make a privileged motion to vacate the chair, and we'd have to have a vote.
[02:51:45.865 --> 02:51:50.110]  A vote in which- And listen, I know you don't like to take credit behind the scenes, but I know you advise Gates.
[02:51:50.110 --> 02:51:52.492]  Hell, you're the guy that got him on the show one time.
[02:51:52.492 --> 02:51:54.615]  Were you advising Gates on this direction?
[02:51:55.518 --> 02:52:00.301]  I have not talked to Matt Gaetz in several years, so I cannot take credit for any of this.
[02:52:00.301 --> 02:52:08.167]  But I think he did a great job, and I think he's handled himself extraordinarily well in a high-pressure situation.
[02:52:08.167 --> 02:52:10.768]  We got the best possible result.
[02:52:10.768 --> 02:52:15.552]  McCarthy either has to deliver for the caucus, or he'll be replaced.
[02:52:15.552 --> 02:52:18.674]  And that is the truth.
[02:52:18.674 --> 02:52:20.175]  I'll tell you, a good starting place, Alex.
[02:52:20.675 --> 02:52:28.065]  We need to see the 14,000 hours of videotape of everything that happened around January 6th.
[02:52:28.065 --> 02:52:30.228]  And Gates has said he's going to release that.
[02:52:30.228 --> 02:52:30.689]  Or trying to.
[02:52:31.482 --> 02:52:34.465]  He's demanding it, and it needs to happen.
[02:52:34.465 --> 02:52:35.946]  And we need to have that.
[02:52:35.946 --> 02:52:38.608]  That commitment needs to be held, needs to be kept.
[02:52:38.608 --> 02:52:42.672]  Okay, so they had Russiagate, they had Ukrainegate, two impeachments.
[02:52:42.672 --> 02:52:44.494]  They had January 6th.
[02:52:44.494 --> 02:52:47.717]  What is their push and race for?
[02:52:47.717 --> 02:52:49.999]  What's the deep state going to pull now?
[02:52:49.999 --> 02:52:53.642]  I asked you that earlier, but really, put your thinking cap on, you're a smart guy, I want your opinion.
[02:52:53.642 --> 02:52:54.202]  What are they going to do?
[02:52:54.202 --> 02:52:54.803]  They're not going to give up.
[02:52:55.888 --> 02:53:11.634]  Well, I thought that perhaps we'd have another pandemic, but the problem is their last pandemic has so undermined the credibility of these public health organizations that I think they'd have a hard time pulling that off.
[02:53:12.794 --> 02:53:24.800]  I think that they are hell-bent on war and a war footing and the idea that in a war we have to rally behind the commander-in-chief and the majority party.
[02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:27.621]  That's my greatest fear at this point.
[02:53:27.621 --> 02:53:28.381]  I agree.
[02:53:28.381 --> 02:53:29.202]  It's 100% war card right now.
[02:53:32.137 --> 02:53:33.398]  I think it's close to 200 billion right now.
[02:53:47.748 --> 02:53:55.093]  Extraordinarily sophisticated military equipment doesn't require soldiers to man it.
[02:53:55.093 --> 02:54:00.517]  It's completely autonomous and deadly.
[02:54:00.517 --> 02:54:06.461]  It's very hard to understand when Senator Rand Paul sponsors an amendment
[02:54:06.961 --> 02:54:12.403]  To require an inspector general to keep track of where the cash is going.
[02:54:12.403 --> 02:54:15.244]  Why would any senator vote against that?
[02:54:15.244 --> 02:54:19.966]  Why would any senator not want to know that the money is getting to the battlefield?
[02:54:19.966 --> 02:54:22.226]  It's getting to the war.
[02:54:22.226 --> 02:54:28.188]  Very valiant on Rand Paul's part, but I think he had a handful of senators who supported him.
[02:54:28.188 --> 02:54:28.769]  Disgraceful.
[02:54:28.769 --> 02:54:29.569]  We've only got a minute left.
[02:54:29.569 --> 02:54:34.891]  What's your prediction or gut level on all the Pfizer and Moderna news that's causing heart attacks and cancer?
[02:54:36.591 --> 02:54:47.417]  Well, it's still surprising how many people don't know about it, Alex.
[02:54:47.417 --> 02:54:51.279]  I mean, you and I know about it because we watch alternative media.
[02:54:51.279 --> 02:54:52.619]  You've reported on it.
[02:54:52.619 --> 02:54:55.581]  We've read authoritative studies from around the world.
[02:54:55.581 --> 02:55:01.404]  But there are still people who believe the vaccination is both safe and effective.
[02:55:02.484 --> 02:55:17.613]  It's funny, when you're on Twitter, you get an enormous amount of good information about authoritative studies and authoritative doctors and so on, in between these government-paid ads telling you to get the jab.
[02:55:17.613 --> 02:55:19.934]  It's really something.
[02:55:19.934 --> 02:55:20.674]  Paradoxical.
[02:55:20.674 --> 02:55:22.695]  All right, Roger Stone, 5 p.m.
[02:55:22.695 --> 02:55:23.696]  Central, Frank Speech.
[02:55:25.019 --> 02:55:25.800]  5 p.m.

[02:55:33.047 --> 02:55:34.328]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[02:55:34.328 --> 02:55:37.071]  And I'll be back tonight on the InfoWars feed, 6 p.m.
[02:55:37.071 --> 02:55:38.932]  Central with AlexJonesLive.com.

[02:55:41.233 --> 02:55:42.994]  It's going to be really beefed up.
[02:55:42.994 --> 02:55:45.234]  A lot of stuff added, but the live feed will be there tonight.
[02:55:45.234 --> 02:55:45.914]  Please share that.
[02:55:45.914 --> 02:55:49.055]  The URL is not getting blocked right now, so it's alexjoneslive.com.

[02:55:52.096 --> 02:55:59.797]  And by commercial free, I mean, I'll air a couple of promos, maybe an ad at the end, but I mean, there's no planned format other than news and deep analysis.
[02:55:59.797 --> 02:56:02.738]  And I'm not getting interrupted every 10 minutes by a break.
[02:56:02.738 --> 02:56:03.778]  I'm not complaining about that.
[02:56:03.778 --> 02:56:05.698]  It's just alexjoneslive.com.
[02:56:05.698 --> 02:56:07.999]  And then please don't forget, today is the last day.
[02:56:09.346 --> 02:56:11.627]  You should make the decision to get these game-changing supplements.
[02:56:11.627 --> 02:56:15.429]  You should see what they do for you and realize, wow, his inflow isn't just powerful.
[02:56:15.429 --> 02:56:17.610]  These products are powerful.
[02:56:17.610 --> 02:56:19.151]  This is the last day.
[02:56:19.151 --> 02:56:19.911]  I say the last day.
[02:56:19.911 --> 02:56:20.551]  I'm so busy.
[02:56:20.551 --> 02:56:22.632]  We don't even know what the sale's going to be tomorrow.
[02:56:22.632 --> 02:56:25.814]  And I've been so busy and booked so many interviews and so much stuff.
[02:56:25.814 --> 02:56:27.555]  I'm like a fat guy at a buffet, man.
[02:56:27.555 --> 02:56:30.936]  I just order too many plates of work here.
[02:56:30.936 --> 02:56:32.277]  Tomorrow's the last day, probably.
[02:56:32.277 --> 02:56:34.558]  But we're getting the biggest sale of the year.
[02:56:34.558 --> 02:56:36.279]  It's as big as the Christmas sale.

[03:00:26.032 --> 03:00:28.894]  You see they have the American Journal.
[03:00:28.894 --> 03:00:30.776]  We got the Trends Journal.
[03:00:30.776 --> 03:00:35.240]  Yep, in-depth trends analysis and trend forecasts.
[03:00:36.701 --> 03:00:39.042]  That you won't find anywhere else.
[03:00:39.042 --> 03:00:41.623]  And this is such an important time.
[03:00:41.623 --> 03:00:45.444]  To stay tuned to Info Wars and of course the Trends Journal.
[03:00:45.444 --> 03:00:48.906]  Because we're doing everything we can to keep you informed.
[03:00:48.906 --> 03:00:52.407]  As all they do is keep selling propaganda and hate.
[03:00:52.407 --> 03:00:53.307]  And hysteria.
[03:00:53.307 --> 03:00:55.128]  I wonder what athlete died.
[03:00:55.128 --> 03:00:56.669]  Oh, how about the Grammys, you know?
[03:00:56.669 --> 03:00:58.349]  What a clown show.
[03:00:58.349 --> 03:01:00.690]  You think of what music used to be.
[03:01:00.690 --> 03:01:03.971]  You know, back in the day.
[03:01:03.971 --> 03:01:05.272]  Now it's a freak show.
[03:01:06.596 --> 03:01:08.276]  Oh yeah, Count Basie would love that.
[03:01:08.276 --> 03:01:09.136]  Duke Ellington?
[03:01:09.136 --> 03:01:09.617]  Oh sure.
[03:01:09.617 --> 03:01:10.597]  Ella Fitzgerald?
[03:01:10.597 --> 03:01:11.797]  Oh great.
[03:01:11.797 --> 03:01:12.377]  What are they?
[03:01:12.377 --> 03:01:14.577]  What's a Duke Ellington?
[03:01:14.577 --> 03:01:18.678]  Was he a Duke somewhere in the Netherlands?
[03:01:18.678 --> 03:01:20.318]  Louis Armstrong?
[03:01:20.318 --> 03:01:21.459]  Frank Sinatra?
[03:01:21.459 --> 03:01:23.719]  Yeah, one after another.
[03:01:23.719 --> 03:01:25.839]  One of the greats.
[03:01:25.839 --> 03:01:28.000]  And now it's just junk.
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:28.500]  Junk.
[03:01:28.500 --> 03:01:34.641]  And that's why you need to subscribe to InfoWars to keep the truth alive in the Trends Journal.
[03:01:34.641 --> 03:01:35.761]  We're doing everything we can.
[03:01:36.325 --> 03:01:38.066]  To give you the best we can.
[03:01:38.066 --> 03:01:41.268]  Last week's edition is like 170 pages plus.
[03:01:41.268 --> 03:01:43.529]  No ads.
[03:01:43.529 --> 03:01:44.849]  So.
[03:01:44.849 --> 03:01:46.730]  What in the world is going on?
[03:01:46.730 --> 03:01:49.232]  Well, the Ukrainian war is the big one.
[03:01:49.232 --> 03:01:52.934]  And my greatest concern, of course, is that World War III has started.
[03:01:52.934 --> 03:01:54.774]  Now they're even saying it.
[03:01:54.774 --> 03:01:59.997]  The clown playing the UN head over there said today, oh, we're getting closer to war.
[03:01:59.997 --> 03:02:01.258]  Yeah, no kidding.
[03:02:01.258 --> 03:02:04.920]  You look at this guy, Marlon.
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:05.280]  So, you know,
[03:02:06.676 --> 03:02:12.498]  Tracking trends is the understanding of how we got here, where we are and where we're going.
[03:02:12.498 --> 03:02:19.901]  So I want to read you some of the, how we got here and where we were to see where we're going.
[03:02:19.901 --> 03:02:22.782]  Can Putin be overthrown?
[03:02:22.782 --> 03:02:30.625]  Putin might seem, Putin might be seen as a mad dictator.
[03:02:30.625 --> 03:02:34.547]  This is CNBC published March 30th.
[03:02:37.453 --> 03:02:56.606]  If his reputation wasn't bad enough before Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin is now widely seen as unstable, unreliable, untrustworthy.
[03:02:56.606 --> 03:03:05.992]  And those are the more generous descriptions of a leader who has ordered and overseen violent and destructive aggression
[03:03:06.667 --> 03:03:11.309]  Toward Russia's smaller neighbor.
[03:03:11.309 --> 03:03:13.430]  This isn't journalism.
[03:03:13.430 --> 03:03:17.871]  This is a lot of rotten, stupid, garbage crap.
[03:03:17.871 --> 03:03:19.312]  Hey!
[03:03:19.312 --> 03:03:34.838]  Hey, Holly Elliott, who wrote this, Holly, how about his reputation wasn't bad enough before the United States' unprovoked invasion of Iraq?
[03:03:36.997 --> 03:03:38.238]  No, no, Holly!
[03:03:38.238 --> 03:03:39.799]  Hey, Holly!
[03:03:39.799 --> 03:03:41.080]  Hey, Holly!
[03:03:41.080 --> 03:03:53.808]  How about if his reputation wasn't bad enough before the United States' unprovoked invasion of Afghanistan?
[03:03:53.808 --> 03:03:55.349]  You're a prostitute!
[03:03:55.999 --> 03:03:57.980]  You're a prostitute!
[03:03:57.980 --> 03:04:04.902]  Oh yeah, boys and girls, media whores, who get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and their government whoremasters.
[03:04:04.902 --> 03:04:08.963]  How come you weren't writing this about little Georgie Bush?
[03:04:08.963 --> 03:04:11.224]  Yeah, little Georgie Bush!
[03:04:11.224 --> 03:04:13.825]  The little moron of an imbecile!
[03:04:13.825 --> 03:04:18.067]  The little nothing of a clown, the daddy's boy!
[03:04:18.067 --> 03:04:21.108]  Again, born on Third Basin, thought he had a home run.
[03:04:21.108 --> 03:04:22.368]  Killed over what?
[03:04:22.368 --> 03:04:24.749]  Over a million people between Afghanistan
[03:04:27.088 --> 03:04:28.268]  In Iraq?
[03:04:28.268 --> 03:04:33.190]  And you're writing crap like this?
[03:04:33.190 --> 03:04:36.430]  This is how they're sending us to war and hate.
[03:04:36.430 --> 03:04:38.571]  And it gets worse.
[03:04:38.571 --> 03:04:41.812]  And that's why you need to support InfoWars.
[03:04:41.812 --> 03:04:44.673]  Because they're fighting for peace and freedom.
[03:04:44.673 --> 03:04:47.193]  As are we at the Trends Journal.
[03:04:47.193 --> 03:04:47.933]  So we come back.
[03:04:47.933 --> 03:04:49.454]  We got a lot more.
[03:04:49.454 --> 03:04:50.974]  And where are the markets going?
[03:04:50.974 --> 03:04:51.754]  What's next?
[03:04:51.754 --> 03:04:52.855]  And what to do?
[03:04:52.855 --> 03:04:53.535]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:58.479 --> 03:05:00.501]  Infowars has made history.
[03:05:00.501 --> 03:05:03.124]  You have made history by supporting Infowars.
[03:05:03.124 --> 03:05:06.307]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.
[03:05:06.307 --> 03:05:09.751]  And now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[03:05:09.751 --> 03:05:11.312]  Let's win the war.
[03:05:11.312 --> 03:05:13.074]  The information war.
[03:05:13.074 --> 03:05:17.859]  There's nothing you can do more important than keeping Infowars on air in the fight for liberty.
[03:05:17.859 --> 03:05:19.661]  I don't think anybody denies that fact.
[03:05:19.921 --> 03:05:31.603]  And I thank you for your fast support, but I'm encouraging you now to get one of the very last coins in a four-coin series, the Teddy Roosevelt Man of the Arena coin, exclusively at 1776coin.com.

[03:05:46.387 --> 03:05:50.213]  It's exclusively available right now for a limited time at 1776coin.com.

[03:06:09.270 --> 03:06:12.652]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:06:12.652 --> 03:06:17.294]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente!
[03:06:17.294 --> 03:06:29.821]  We're on the Alex Jones Show, and here we can't afford him for words, because we got the media whores, the little prostitutes.
[03:06:29.821 --> 03:06:35.724]  If you don't swallow the crap that they're shoveling out, they call it disinformation, or misinformation.
[03:06:36.765 --> 03:06:40.346]  We shouldn't call it misinformation.
[03:06:40.346 --> 03:06:41.047]  That's terrible.
[03:06:41.047 --> 03:06:43.047]  We should call it Mr. Information.
[03:06:43.047 --> 03:06:44.788]  No, gender information.
[03:06:44.788 --> 03:06:46.048]  Call it gender information.
[03:06:46.048 --> 03:06:47.229]  You know what happened?
[03:06:47.229 --> 03:06:48.369]  I thought it was Adam and Eve.
[03:06:48.369 --> 03:06:50.850]  How did we get the rest of these?
[03:06:50.850 --> 03:06:53.511]  I guess they got it wrong with that Adam and Eve stuff.
[03:06:53.511 --> 03:06:57.373]  You know, they should have thrown another one in there.
[03:06:57.373 --> 03:07:02.574]  Anyway, going back to CNBC, Wednesday, March 30, 2022.
[03:07:06.437 --> 03:07:10.439]  It's like a month after the war started.
[03:07:10.439 --> 03:07:13.880]  The war started on February 24th, 2022.
[03:07:13.880 --> 03:07:31.407]  They go on to say, specifically, many experts, this is Holly Elliott, E-L-L-Y-A-T-T, at CNBC.
[03:07:31.407 --> 03:07:35.289]  Specifically, many experts, many experts,
[03:07:36.286 --> 03:07:41.772]  You mean the clowns that you look to as experts?
[03:07:41.772 --> 03:07:43.734]  Hey, what expert are you talking about?
[03:07:43.734 --> 03:07:50.080]  Oh, the experts that haven't won a war since World War II?
[03:07:50.080 --> 03:07:53.184]  Oh, maybe you're too young to remember the Vietnam War.
[03:07:53.184 --> 03:07:55.226]  Oh, way too young to remember the Korean War.
[03:07:55.885 --> 03:08:00.610]  Oh, I forgot about the Iraq wars and the Afghan wars.
[03:08:00.610 --> 03:08:01.591]  Oh, yeah.
[03:08:01.591 --> 03:08:03.293]  Oh, losing wars?
[03:08:03.293 --> 03:08:03.993]  Experts?
[03:08:03.993 --> 03:08:05.255]  What experts?
[03:08:05.255 --> 03:08:05.755]  I love it.
[03:08:05.755 --> 03:08:07.757]  They bring on these generals.
[03:08:07.757 --> 03:08:09.799]  General jerks!
[03:08:09.799 --> 03:08:11.081]  You arrogant!
[03:08:11.081 --> 03:08:15.766]  Oh, you're still wearing your little buttons like you're still in the Boy Scouts.
[03:08:15.766 --> 03:08:16.847]  You got all your medals.
[03:08:22.076 --> 03:08:32.699]  Specifically, many experts are asking whether the invasion of Ukraine, which has had unintended consequences for Russia, leaving it on the verge of economic ruin.
[03:08:32.699 --> 03:08:33.699]  Oh yeah!
[03:08:33.699 --> 03:08:37.580]  Oh, it's on the verge of economic ruin!
[03:08:37.580 --> 03:08:44.121]  This is why, by the way, you listen to InfoWars and you subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[03:08:44.121 --> 03:08:47.062]  We don't write crap!
[03:08:47.062 --> 03:08:50.983]  We're not garbage salesmen like these people are!
[03:08:53.601 --> 03:08:56.003]  Prostitutes!
[03:08:56.003 --> 03:08:58.425]  Look it up in Wikipedia!
[03:08:58.425 --> 03:09:00.187]  Prostitutes!
[03:09:00.187 --> 03:09:02.068]  A word that I came up with.
[03:09:02.068 --> 03:09:10.195]  Media whores who get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and their government whoremasters.
[03:09:10.195 --> 03:09:13.117]  Yep.
[03:09:13.117 --> 03:09:15.940]  Anyway, leaving it on the verge of economic ruin,
[03:09:16.852 --> 03:09:20.275]  While uniting most of the international community against it.
[03:09:20.275 --> 03:09:22.937]  No, not most of the international community.
[03:09:22.937 --> 03:09:25.138]  The warmongering freaks in NATO.
[03:09:25.138 --> 03:09:28.821]  Hey, you guys did a great job in Yugoslavia.
[03:09:28.821 --> 03:09:31.063]  Love what you did in Libya.
[03:09:31.063 --> 03:09:35.246]  Oh, and the Iraq wars and the Afghan wars.
[03:09:35.246 --> 03:09:38.028]  War wars, war wars.
[03:09:38.028 --> 03:09:39.909]  International community.
[03:09:39.909 --> 03:09:40.730]  Oh, China.
[03:09:40.730 --> 03:09:42.631]  They're not international, are they?
[03:09:42.631 --> 03:09:43.372]  Oh, in India?
[03:09:43.372 --> 03:09:44.352]  No, no, no.
[03:09:44.352 --> 03:09:45.794]  There's only, what, two point
[03:09:47.122 --> 03:09:55.987]  Eight billion people between the two of them.
[03:09:55.987 --> 03:09:59.549]  And most of South America and Africa.
[03:09:59.549 --> 03:10:03.371]  Oh, they don't count as the international community.
[03:10:03.371 --> 03:10:03.851]  Why?
[03:10:03.851 --> 03:10:09.114]  No, only only Europe does in the United States.
[03:10:14.178 --> 03:10:20.081]  Could backfire spectacularly on Putin, leaving him vulnerable to an uprising at home.
[03:10:20.081 --> 03:10:30.908]  I'm mentioning it to you because this is the kind of crap that everybody forgets, but that everybody was repeating as it was happening.
[03:10:30.908 --> 03:10:35.470]  Yeah, just like they follow the COVID war.
[03:10:35.470 --> 03:10:38.032]  Stand six feet apart!
[03:10:38.032 --> 03:10:39.833]  Get behind that plexiglass!
[03:10:40.754 --> 03:10:45.456]  The wind doesn't go under it, doesn't go around it, doesn't go over it.
[03:10:45.456 --> 03:10:47.036]  No, no, no, no.
[03:10:47.036 --> 03:10:53.619]  And stand six feet apart because the wind does not blow any more than six feet in a direct straight line.
[03:10:53.619 --> 03:11:01.021]  And when you're in an airplane, wear the mask, but you can take it off when you're eating and drinking because COVID doesn't get you then.
[03:11:01.021 --> 03:11:08.304]  These are the same moronic, stupid masses that swallow the mainstream media crap.
[03:11:10.476 --> 03:11:19.101]  Again, tracking trends is an understanding of how we got here, where we are, to see where we're going.
[03:11:19.101 --> 03:11:22.203]  So how we got here, and that's what I'm doing.
[03:11:22.203 --> 03:11:29.748]  Showing you how we got here and how the masses swallow the propaganda and march off to war.
[03:11:29.748 --> 03:11:37.052]  I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, a Yankee Doodle do or die.
[03:11:37.052 --> 03:11:38.253]  Do or die for what?
[03:11:40.339 --> 03:11:44.560]  For war going on in Europe they have no business getting into?
[03:11:44.560 --> 03:11:49.941]  They shot the Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo!
[03:11:49.941 --> 03:11:51.341]  Yeah, what's a Sarajevo?
[03:11:51.341 --> 03:11:54.602]  Who cares about an Archduke?
[03:11:54.602 --> 03:11:57.743]  And what are they doing over there where they have no business being there?
[03:11:57.743 --> 03:12:03.924]  You mean a place, a country that they stole?
[03:12:03.924 --> 03:12:06.085]  Brought to you by Woodrow Wilson.
[03:12:06.085 --> 03:12:07.385]  May he rot in hell!
[03:12:08.792 --> 03:12:13.596]  Gave us the Federal Reserve and income tax, income tax.
[03:12:13.596 --> 03:12:30.248]  Don't forget to pay your income tax and get half of it stolen and half of the $1.7 trillion budget, the clowns, the imbeciles that people vote for, the repulsive kids and Democrats just passed.
[03:12:30.248 --> 03:12:36.493]  The military industrial intelligence complex got over half of that dough.
[03:12:39.482 --> 03:12:44.064]  That was federal income tax.
[03:12:44.064 --> 03:12:50.427]  So, the people buy the crap that they sell.
[03:12:50.427 --> 03:12:55.410]  And they bought the COVID war, and this is the propaganda that they were selling.
[03:12:55.410 --> 03:13:03.093]  Never a word, never a word, of why the Russians invaded.
[03:13:03.093 --> 03:13:08.116]  Not a word about NATO moving not, quote, one inch further was the deal made between Gorbachev
[03:13:08.866 --> 03:13:11.287]  And Bush Senior?
[03:13:11.287 --> 03:13:13.028]  That NATO would not move one inch further?
[03:13:13.028 --> 03:13:15.429]  Oh, there were 16 NATO countries then?
[03:13:15.429 --> 03:13:19.932]  Now there were 30?
[03:13:19.932 --> 03:13:28.616]  Not a word about what we wrote about in the Trends Journal in 2014, when it was a quarterly magazine.
[03:13:28.616 --> 03:13:31.418]  The overthrow of the democratically elected government of Viktor Yanukovych.
[03:13:32.833 --> 03:13:34.394]  Brought to you by Victoria Newland.
[03:13:34.394 --> 03:13:39.055]  Yep, under Secretary of State then, and back under the Secretary of State today.
[03:13:39.055 --> 03:13:52.320]  Handin' out cookies in Midan Square, along with John May-Rotten-Hell McCain, another warmongering freak.
[03:13:52.320 --> 03:13:57.281]  John Insane McCain.
[03:13:57.281 --> 03:13:59.302]  All they do is sell propaganda and hate.
[03:14:01.292 --> 03:14:06.394]  A coup led by within members of the political and business elite.
[03:14:06.394 --> 03:14:09.195]  Quote, the solution begins with naming the problem.
[03:14:09.195 --> 03:14:15.957]  The problem is a mad dictator, which essentially got to tax reality 20 years in power.
[03:14:15.957 --> 03:14:24.941]  And he's absolutely delusional and ready to do whatever he can to destabilize the global order, said Vladimir Milov.
[03:14:25.695 --> 03:14:27.957]  A Russian opposition politician.
[03:14:27.957 --> 03:14:33.240]  Why, of course, why not believe a Russian opposition politician?
[03:14:33.240 --> 03:14:35.102]  That's who they quote.
[03:14:35.102 --> 03:14:36.583]  Yes, she is.
[03:14:36.583 --> 03:14:43.207]  Victoria Nuland and a little scum, a little nothing of a clown, Jeffrey Pyatt.
[03:14:43.207 --> 03:14:45.929]  Yep.
[03:14:45.929 --> 03:14:48.551]  America's ambassador to Ukraine right over there.
[03:14:50.017 --> 03:15:02.280]  Could you imagine if the Russians were out handing out cookies and cakes to my Peace and Freedom Rally that I had over here in Kingston, New York?
[03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:03.361]  Oh my God!
[03:15:03.361 --> 03:15:04.901]  Oh my God!
[03:15:04.901 --> 03:15:06.862]  What are you doing over there?
[03:15:06.862 --> 03:15:12.123]  Hey, maybe you arrogant people hate George Washington and the Founding Fathers.
[03:15:13.368 --> 03:15:29.457]  Because you're too arrogant and stupid to read his farewell address, where he warns the Americans not to get involved in any foreign entanglements, particularly in Europe, because this has been going on for centuries with these countries.
[03:15:29.457 --> 03:15:34.840]  Oh no, we're going to get involved, because we're crazy people in charge.
[03:15:34.840 --> 03:15:36.061]  Whoa.
[03:15:36.061 --> 03:15:37.942]  Yep.
[03:15:37.942 --> 03:15:39.463]  Yep, there's our rally we had.
[03:15:41.912 --> 03:15:50.661]  Bill Giraldi, Scott Ritter, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Gary Noll, the Hot Damn Band, and not one word in the media.
[03:15:50.661 --> 03:15:51.562]  No peace allowed.
[03:15:51.562 --> 03:15:54.285]  We're going to take a break and we'll be right back.
[03:15:57.139 --> 03:16:16.284]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war and everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting InfoWarstore.com right now and taking action.
[03:16:16.284 --> 03:16:21.225]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[03:16:21.665 --> 03:16:23.306]  Keep Info Wars on the air.
[03:16:23.306 --> 03:16:25.607]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[03:16:25.607 --> 03:16:27.067]  They're coming for you and your family.
[03:16:27.067 --> 03:16:28.308]  They're coming for me.
[03:16:28.308 --> 03:16:29.548]  They're coming for the children.
[03:16:29.548 --> 03:16:32.109]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[03:16:32.109 --> 03:16:35.530]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[03:16:35.530 --> 03:16:36.791]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[03:16:37.051 --> 03:16:39.152]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[03:16:39.152 --> 03:16:44.553]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[03:16:44.553 --> 03:16:48.474]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[03:16:48.474 --> 03:16:49.694]  Let's do it together.
[03:16:49.694 --> 03:16:51.995]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[03:16:51.995 --> 03:16:55.796]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:16:55.796 --> 03:16:56.776]  Now take action now!
[03:16:57.136 --> 03:17:03.540]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[03:17:03.540 --> 03:17:08.183]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[03:17:08.183 --> 03:17:10.705]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.

[03:17:13.207 --> 03:17:19.971]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[03:17:19.971 --> 03:17:23.354]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[03:17:23.974 --> 03:17:34.646]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the InfoWars label, InfoWarsMD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:17:52.001 --> 03:17:55.523]  This is the best deal out there and it keeps InfoWars on the air.
[03:17:55.523 --> 03:17:57.284]  InfoWarsMD.
[03:17:57.284 --> 03:18:02.647]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[03:18:03.507 --> 03:18:11.897]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[03:18:11.897 --> 03:18:14.140]  So I thank you for your passion and support.
[03:18:14.140 --> 03:18:17.624]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin.
[03:18:17.624 --> 03:18:20.988]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time
[03:18:21.708 --> 03:18:28.433]  Is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[03:18:28.433 --> 03:18:37.440]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left and yes there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[03:18:37.780 --> 03:18:38.421]  Thanks for watching!
[03:18:56.980 --> 03:18:58.982]  InfoWars has made history.
[03:18:58.982 --> 03:19:01.604]  You have made history by supporting InfoWars.
[03:19:01.604 --> 03:19:04.786]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.
[03:19:04.786 --> 03:19:08.249]  And now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[03:19:08.249 --> 03:19:09.790]  Let's win the war.
[03:19:09.790 --> 03:19:11.551]  The information war.
[03:19:11.551 --> 03:19:16.335]  There's nothing you can do more important than keeping InfoWars on air and the fight for liberty.
[03:19:16.335 --> 03:19:18.136]  I don't think anybody denies that fact.
[03:19:18.396 --> 03:19:32.524]  And I thank you for your past support, but I'm encouraging you now to get one of the very last coins in a four coin series, the Teddy Roosevelt Man of the Arena coin, exclusively at 1776coin.com.

[03:19:58.641 --> 03:20:04.546]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:12.785 --> 03:20:30.234]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:30.234 --> 03:20:34.316]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[03:20:37.481 --> 03:20:39.763]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:39.763 --> 03:20:43.827]  Happy to be here and happy that you're there.
[03:20:43.827 --> 03:20:50.133]  And it's so important for us to unite because we have crazy people in charge.
[03:20:50.133 --> 03:20:51.754]  There's no media left anymore.
[03:20:51.754 --> 03:20:54.016]  Journalism is dead.
[03:20:54.016 --> 03:20:56.879]  They used to call journalism the fourth estate.
[03:20:56.879 --> 03:21:03.685]  So you had the executive order, Congress number two, judicial number three, and
[03:21:04.557 --> 03:21:09.979]  The journalists, the media, was number four to watch over and report on them.
[03:21:09.979 --> 03:21:11.020]  Done.
[03:21:11.020 --> 03:21:12.060]  Finito.
[03:21:12.060 --> 03:21:13.241]  Done.
[03:21:13.241 --> 03:21:13.541]  Done.
[03:21:13.541 --> 03:21:20.223]  You have, you know, what, five companies control over 90% of the media.
[03:21:20.223 --> 03:21:25.566]  And they fired journalists all the time.
[03:21:25.566 --> 03:21:32.769]  Once upon a time, there were journalists in every city hall, all the state houses, you know, on and on and on.
[03:21:32.769 --> 03:21:33.649]  You don't get them anymore.
[03:21:35.037 --> 03:21:36.577]  They're firing him.
[03:21:36.577 --> 03:21:40.939]  There's hardly any news out there.
[03:21:40.939 --> 03:21:46.260]  You know, I gotta know about a football player that got a heart attack.
[03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:48.481]  That's the news.
[03:21:48.481 --> 03:21:49.681]  How's Johnny Depp?
[03:21:49.681 --> 03:21:50.602]  I hope he's doing well.
[03:21:50.602 --> 03:21:51.422]  I haven't heard of him.
[03:21:51.422 --> 03:21:52.022]  Never heard of him.
[03:21:54.153 --> 03:21:57.134]  So I'm going over this because, again, it's very important.
[03:21:57.134 --> 03:21:58.494]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[03:21:58.494 --> 03:22:00.574]  I've been at this for 43 years.
[03:22:00.574 --> 03:22:01.895]  Best-selling books.
[03:22:01.895 --> 03:22:05.656]  Trends 2000, Trend Tracking, Weekly Magazine.
[03:22:05.656 --> 03:22:08.216]  Been at it a long time.
[03:22:08.216 --> 03:22:19.499]  They don't teach trend forecasting at Harvard, Yale, nowhere.
[03:22:19.499 --> 03:22:19.979]  Princeton.
[03:22:22.245 --> 03:22:23.665]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale?
[03:22:23.665 --> 03:22:25.286]  Oh, you mean bullets, bombs, and banks?
[03:22:25.286 --> 03:22:26.566]  That Harvard, Princeton, Yale?
[03:22:26.566 --> 03:22:28.206]  No, yeah, that one.
[03:22:28.206 --> 03:22:29.366]  Oxford, Cambridge?
[03:22:29.366 --> 03:22:30.086]  No, you know why?
[03:22:30.086 --> 03:22:32.987]  They don't know how to forecast trends.
[03:22:32.987 --> 03:22:35.507]  Look how the year just ended.
[03:22:35.507 --> 03:22:39.968]  The stupid baloney you heard from the mainstream media, this is what happened in 2022.
[03:22:39.968 --> 03:22:42.328]  What do I care what happened?
[03:22:42.328 --> 03:22:44.589]  What's going to happen next?
[03:22:44.589 --> 03:22:45.249]  What does it mean?
[03:22:45.249 --> 03:22:47.129]  What do I do?
[03:22:47.129 --> 03:22:49.010]  No, no, we don't know anything about that.
[03:22:49.010 --> 03:22:51.410]  The reason I can't teach it in school is because I don't know how to.
[03:22:52.082 --> 03:22:54.223]  Well, you could get a degree in history.
[03:22:54.223 --> 03:22:57.465]  Remember, when did the Peloponnesian War start?
[03:22:57.465 --> 03:22:59.646]  What was your favorite war?
[03:22:59.646 --> 03:23:00.727]  The War of Roses?
[03:23:00.727 --> 03:23:01.247]  Oh, yeah.
[03:23:01.247 --> 03:23:01.827]  Loved it.
[03:23:01.827 --> 03:23:03.228]  Loved the war.
[03:23:03.228 --> 03:23:07.611]  So, going back to how we got here.
[03:23:07.611 --> 03:23:19.237]  The CNBC, remember what they say over here is that the experts, specifically many experts are asking.
[03:23:19.237 --> 03:23:20.938]  So, the first expert they ask
[03:23:21.798 --> 03:23:37.681]  Is this guy who Vladimir Milov, a Russian opposition politician, former Energy, former Deputy Energy Minister, who now lives in Lithuania.
[03:23:37.681 --> 03:23:41.662]  Okay, he's, he's, he's really up there.
[03:23:41.662 --> 03:23:44.883]  And US President Joe Biden.
[03:23:48.322 --> 03:24:00.110]  This past weekend, this is again, this is March 30th, suggested that Putin, quote, cannot remain in power, end quote, in Russia.
[03:24:00.110 --> 03:24:04.312]  Oh, you mean BS Biden?
[03:24:04.312 --> 03:24:06.334]  Out of his mind Biden?
[03:24:06.334 --> 03:24:08.395]  War mongering Biden?
[03:24:08.395 --> 03:24:10.396]  Biden the draft dodger?
[03:24:10.396 --> 03:24:15.300]  A couple of years older than me?
[03:24:15.300 --> 03:24:17.161]  Dodged the Vietnam War draft?
[03:24:18.672 --> 03:24:24.213]  Got deferments, but loves to send other people to go get killed and loves killing others.
[03:24:24.213 --> 03:24:26.233]  That's Joe Biden?
[03:24:26.233 --> 03:24:37.955]  Oh, by the way, when I was a young guy, you know, in my late teens and early twenties, I was stupid enough to believe the Vietnam War.
[03:24:37.955 --> 03:24:40.416]  And it's the same thing they're doing now.
[03:24:40.416 --> 03:24:48.097]  Just how the masses believe in supporting Ukraine and how I read last week
[03:24:48.789 --> 03:24:56.013]  On Infowars, the baloney spewing out of the crap mouth of little Lindsey Graham.
[03:24:56.013 --> 03:25:04.257]  That basically if we don't stop Russia now, before you know it, it's going to be all of Europe and the whole world is next.
[03:25:04.257 --> 03:25:06.318]  Europe is next.
[03:25:06.318 --> 03:25:09.600]  And this is our, it's our interest.
[03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:13.782]  They sold the same baloney with the Vietnam War that the dominoes would keep falling.
[03:25:14.540 --> 03:25:15.000]  Yep.
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:16.300]  William F. Buckley.
[03:25:16.300 --> 03:25:18.101]  You know what that F stands for?
[03:25:18.101 --> 03:25:20.101]  Yeah, you could throw a U in there too.
[03:25:20.101 --> 03:25:23.242]  Yeah, end it with a whatever you want.
[03:25:23.242 --> 03:25:24.142]  Yep.
[03:25:24.142 --> 03:25:27.003]  Little nothing of a boy, Lindsey Graham.
[03:25:27.003 --> 03:25:29.344]  Little nothing of a clown.
[03:25:29.344 --> 03:25:32.684]  Guy couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag.
[03:25:32.684 --> 03:25:33.365]  Loves war.
[03:25:33.365 --> 03:25:35.905]  Like the other war whores.
[03:25:35.905 --> 03:25:38.366]  Never go fight, but send others to go die.
[03:25:38.366 --> 03:25:42.667]  Went over there to Ukraine to support them.
[03:25:44.730 --> 03:25:46.731]  So they're selling the same thing now.
[03:25:46.731 --> 03:25:48.772]  And I told you, I was too stupid.
[03:25:48.772 --> 03:25:50.793]  Another guy, Blumenthal.
[03:25:50.793 --> 03:25:51.653]  I think that's his name.
[03:25:51.653 --> 03:25:52.494]  Bloomin' something.
[03:25:52.494 --> 03:25:53.894]  Bloomin' crap.
[03:25:53.894 --> 03:25:56.576]  Yeah, there he is, the clown on the left.
[03:25:56.576 --> 03:26:01.538]  Another Aryan guy that got, like, four draft affirmants in the Vietnam War.
[03:26:01.538 --> 03:26:03.479]  We're about the same age.
[03:26:03.479 --> 03:26:08.381]  And then because, you know, he's a member of the club, he joined, you know, the National Guard or something.
[03:26:08.381 --> 03:26:09.742]  He never left Washington, D.C.
[03:26:10.660 --> 03:26:11.981]  And lied.
[03:26:11.981 --> 03:26:18.185]  And lied when he's running for campaigning that he fought in Vietnam.
[03:26:18.185 --> 03:26:19.646]  So anyway, I was too stupid.
[03:26:19.646 --> 03:26:20.547]  I believed it.
[03:26:20.547 --> 03:26:21.968]  But I didn't want to go die.
[03:26:21.968 --> 03:26:23.809]  That's why I did everything to beat the draft.
[03:26:23.809 --> 03:26:32.915]  You know, I'm looking at these pictures, guys walking up to water this high with guns over their head and 50 pounds of weight on their back with these knapsacks getting shot.
[03:26:32.915 --> 03:26:34.616]  I said, I don't want to do that.
[03:26:34.616 --> 03:26:37.078]  But these other guys, they lie.
[03:26:38.123 --> 03:26:42.686]  They lie about what they did and who they are, and keep promoting war.
[03:26:42.686 --> 03:26:50.451]  So going back to this article, Biden said, quote, Putin cannot remain in power.
[03:26:50.451 --> 03:27:00.137]  What if Putin said, George W. Bush cannot remain in power, with starting the Iraq and Afghan war?
[03:27:00.137 --> 03:27:02.419]  Why those dirty Russians?
[03:27:02.419 --> 03:27:04.160]  How about if Putin said,
[03:27:04.815 --> 03:27:09.338]  The Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama.
[03:27:09.338 --> 03:27:14.701]  Here it is.
[03:27:14.701 --> 03:27:15.381]  For God's sakes.
[03:27:15.381 --> 03:27:16.662]  For God's sakes?
[03:27:16.662 --> 03:27:18.042]  What God are you talking about?
[03:27:18.042 --> 03:27:20.724]  Oh, you're the phony Catholic!
[03:27:20.724 --> 03:27:24.186]  You're the phony guy that calls himself a Catholic!
[03:27:24.186 --> 03:27:25.967]  What God are you talking about?
[03:27:25.967 --> 03:27:32.691]  Because the Prince of Peace, Biden, doesn't go for murderous wars like you do.
[03:27:32.691 --> 03:27:32.831]  So.
[03:27:34.244 --> 03:27:51.076]  Going on about suggesting that Biden wants to get rid of Putin and the other wars that they keep lying us into, the Vietnam War, they're doing the same thing now.
[03:27:51.076 --> 03:27:58.901]  They're saying if we don't stop the Russians, it's going to be the end.
[03:27:58.901 --> 03:28:01.543]  Then they quote another guy, Melinda
[03:28:02.372 --> 03:28:12.098]  Haring, Deputy Director of the Atlantic Council Eurasia, told CNBC on Wednesday, this is a closed political system.
[03:28:12.098 --> 03:28:22.805]  Vladimir Putin is very paranoid, very controlled, and we don't know what people are thinking.
[03:28:22.805 --> 03:28:28.949]  There are things that have happened that have surprised all of us.
[03:28:36.263 --> 03:28:39.305]  The military going to overthrow Putin?
[03:28:39.305 --> 03:28:40.506]  I don't think so.
[03:28:40.506 --> 03:28:42.367]  It is very, very unlikely.
[03:28:42.367 --> 03:28:43.488]  She was right.
[03:28:43.488 --> 03:28:45.969]  But the part about paranoid and very controlled?
[03:28:45.969 --> 03:28:48.071]  I didn't know it was paranoid.
[03:28:48.071 --> 03:28:50.873]  More paranoid than who?
[03:28:50.873 --> 03:28:54.055]  What's your favorite paranoid president?
[03:28:54.055 --> 03:28:55.015]  Clinton?
[03:28:55.015 --> 03:28:55.636]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:57.318 --> 03:29:00.539]  InfoWars MD is finally here.
[03:29:00.539 --> 03:29:16.826]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through InfoWars line, but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality products from.

[03:29:57.217 --> 03:30:00.784]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[03:30:05.498 --> 03:30:06.839]  I want you all to know something.
[03:30:06.839 --> 03:30:08.800]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:30:08.800 --> 03:30:12.342]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[03:30:12.342 --> 03:30:15.443]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:30:15.443 --> 03:30:19.705]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[03:30:19.705 --> 03:30:21.926]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:30:21.926 --> 03:30:25.448]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:30:25.448 --> 03:30:28.890]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:30:29.170 --> 03:30:32.052]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[03:30:32.052 --> 03:30:33.073]  Years ago.
[03:30:33.073 --> 03:30:35.154]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[03:30:35.154 --> 03:30:37.135]  Not for a second.
[03:30:37.135 --> 03:30:39.657]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:30:39.657 --> 03:30:42.118]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:30:42.118 --> 03:30:45.260]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:30:45.260 --> 03:30:46.801]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[03:30:46.801 --> 03:30:52.545]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:30:52.545 --> 03:30:53.846]  AlexJonesLive.com
[03:30:57.592 --> 03:30:58.053]  We're good to go.
[03:31:17.449 --> 03:31:17.609]  That's
[03:31:35.623 --> 03:31:37.144]  This is a potential solution.
[03:31:37.144 --> 03:31:40.185]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[03:31:40.185 --> 03:31:43.107]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[03:31:43.107 --> 03:31:44.488]  Isn't it interesting?
[03:31:44.488 --> 03:31:50.591]  Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[03:31:50.591 --> 03:31:55.093]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support and thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[03:31:55.093 --> 03:31:56.714]  You didn't come here to do that but I made you do it.
[03:31:57.372 --> 03:32:07.379]  The good news is, the Real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.
[03:32:07.379 --> 03:32:11.102]  The bad news is, we need a limited run of it, and it's almost sold out.
[03:32:11.102 --> 03:32:13.464]  So, we're in late January when I'm cutting this.
[03:32:13.464 --> 03:32:18.548]  Only seven days left to get the Real Red Pill Plus with all the key ingredients like preglanone and more,
[03:32:19.348 --> 03:32:20.349]  We're good to go.
[03:32:44.400 --> 03:32:48.003]  You need to try the Real Red Pill Plus right now, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[03:32:48.003 --> 03:32:49.925]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[03:32:49.925 --> 03:32:58.732]  Real Red Pill Plus, now available at 50% off at InfoWarStore.com for only a few more days.
[03:32:58.732 --> 03:33:04.637]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:16.906 --> 03:33:19.267]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:33:19.267 --> 03:33:22.027]  It's Gerald Solente.
[03:33:22.027 --> 03:33:32.330]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.330 --> 03:33:40.833]  They're doing everything they can to keep the truth alive as it's being robbed from us.
[03:33:40.833 --> 03:33:44.874]  You know, I'm going to talk later about the economy and where that's going.
[03:33:45.592 --> 03:33:50.595]  And what those job numbers came out with and other true or false.
[03:33:50.595 --> 03:33:55.057]  But I really want to stay on this Ukraine war because this is my greatest concern.
[03:33:55.057 --> 03:33:59.480]  And because they keep ramping it up and there's no end in sight.
[03:33:59.480 --> 03:34:06.543]  You go back to when it began that Biden said they weren't going to send any offensive offensive weapons.
[03:34:06.543 --> 03:34:09.885]  And now they're sending tanks and missiles, you know.
[03:34:09.885 --> 03:34:11.426]  We're at war with Russia.
[03:34:11.426 --> 03:34:13.207]  It's not a proxy war, we're at war.
[03:34:14.591 --> 03:34:27.301]  But I want to also show you again, in trend forecasting, tracking trends is the understanding of where we are and how we got here, so you can see where we're going.
[03:34:27.301 --> 03:34:43.074]  And as I just detailed, and there's more to it, in that propaganda piece by CNBC, when the whole thing started, the average person started belting out the stuff that Putin's out of his mind, he's crazy, he's going to be, and that's what they were selling.
[03:34:43.601 --> 03:34:47.423]  And it hadn't stopped.
[03:34:47.423 --> 03:34:54.067]  This is from December 17th.
[03:34:54.067 --> 03:34:58.329]  From the Daily Star front page.
[03:34:58.329 --> 03:35:06.453]  Vultures circling Putin as desperate faces coup from once loyal henchmen.
[03:35:06.453 --> 03:35:09.575]  Mad Vlad Putin faces pressure in Moscow.
[03:35:10.566 --> 03:35:26.730]  As the continued failure of Russia's army in Ukraine sparked renewed rumors that the former loyalists inside the Kremlin are preparing to oust him.
[03:35:26.730 --> 03:35:29.530]  They keep saying that Russia is losing.
[03:35:29.530 --> 03:35:36.352]  How about that place called Maripol and about 20% of Ukraine that Russia took so far?
[03:35:36.352 --> 03:35:37.692]  How about the destruction
[03:35:38.447 --> 03:35:44.372]  Of well over 50% of Ukraine's infrastructure, power and water.
[03:35:44.372 --> 03:35:54.139]  But this is how they keep selling the lies that people keep swallowing so they keep supporting the war.
[03:35:54.139 --> 03:35:57.642]  That was December 17th.
[03:35:57.642 --> 03:35:58.703]  Let's go to December 29th.
[03:36:00.819 --> 03:36:06.860]  The war is at a stalemate, Ukraine's intelligence chief says.
[03:36:06.860 --> 03:36:12.702]  Well, if Ukraine's intelligence chief says, then it must be true.
[03:36:12.702 --> 03:36:15.902]  It's not at a stalemate.
[03:36:15.902 --> 03:36:22.504]  Intelligence is an oxymoron when you quote a moron like their intelligence chief.
[03:36:22.504 --> 03:36:27.025]  But that's the way they keep selling it.
[03:36:27.025 --> 03:36:28.405]  He told BBC this.
[03:36:30.049 --> 03:36:31.850]  I can't say the other word.
[03:36:31.850 --> 03:36:38.334]  It begins with another B. This is Drudge Report.
[03:36:38.334 --> 03:36:39.634]  Boy, that thing really went down.
[03:36:39.634 --> 03:36:41.916]  I used to go to Drudge Report a lot.
[03:36:41.916 --> 03:36:43.977]  You know, I thought they were putting out some great stuff.
[03:36:43.977 --> 03:36:48.259]  And now it's the same story there for like three days and stupid stuff.
[03:36:48.259 --> 03:36:50.980]  It really went down, you know.
[03:36:50.980 --> 03:36:52.401]  And this is more proof of it.
[03:36:52.401 --> 03:36:54.422]  Yeah, this is what the front page looked like.
[03:36:56.161 --> 03:36:57.562]  It's at the end of the year.
[03:36:57.562 --> 03:37:00.803]  Year-end, Putin alone doesn't know what to do.
[03:37:00.803 --> 03:37:06.765]  Yep.
[03:37:06.765 --> 03:37:09.746]  Putin's alone, he doesn't know what to do.
[03:37:09.746 --> 03:37:13.127]  Total propaganda.
[03:37:13.127 --> 03:37:25.292]  And, to add imbeciles to the morons and jerks that are running our lives, this arrogant little boy, another little clown of a nothing, this Jen Stoltenberg over there, NATO Secretary General,
[03:37:27.133 --> 03:37:33.358]  It may sound like a paradox, but military support for Ukraine is the fastest way to peace.
[03:37:33.358 --> 03:37:34.859]  Sound like a paradox?
[03:37:34.859 --> 03:37:37.581]  You sound like a damn moron!
[03:37:37.581 --> 03:37:44.346]  You sound like an arrogant, imbecilic, warmongering freak!
[03:37:44.346 --> 03:37:49.250]  Not an oxym- not a paradox!
[03:37:49.250 --> 03:37:49.851]  You're a jerk!
[03:37:52.600 --> 03:37:56.663]  We know that most wars end with negotiating table, probably this war too.
[03:37:56.663 --> 03:37:59.785]  Yeah, we know they do and they will.
[03:37:59.785 --> 03:38:09.051]  But we know what Ukraine can achieve in these negotiations depends inextricably on the military situation.
[03:38:09.051 --> 03:38:10.132]  Now guess what?
[03:38:10.132 --> 03:38:13.615]  You're losing.
[03:38:13.615 --> 03:38:17.677]  This is from the Financial Times.
[03:38:17.677 --> 03:38:18.378]  January 5th.
[03:38:22.335 --> 03:38:26.496]  A boy named Henry Fox.
[03:38:26.496 --> 03:38:30.098]  Henry Fox.
[03:38:30.098 --> 03:38:37.420]  The Ukraine war has completely gone wrong for Putin.
[03:38:37.420 --> 03:38:38.561]  Kitten.
[03:38:38.561 --> 03:38:41.402]  Not a fox, a little kitten.
[03:38:41.402 --> 03:38:44.543]  Little pussy cat.
[03:38:44.543 --> 03:38:46.343]  Ready for this?
[03:38:46.343 --> 03:38:47.924]  Yeah, why don't you spend a lot of money?
[03:38:47.924 --> 03:38:49.925]  Don't subscribe to the Trends Journal for only $3 a week.
[03:38:51.956 --> 03:38:58.341]  With a magazine that you can't find, you won't find in-depth trends analysis and trend forecast anywhere else.
[03:38:58.341 --> 03:39:01.383]  Pay a lot more money and go to foreign policy.
[03:39:01.383 --> 03:39:06.206]  This is foreign policy, January 7th.
[03:39:06.206 --> 03:39:12.991]  It's high time to prepare for Russia's collapse.
[03:39:12.991 --> 03:39:15.513]  You see the propaganda that they're selling?
[03:39:15.513 --> 03:39:16.854]  And the mainstream buys it.
[03:39:20.009 --> 03:39:21.270]  Let's go a little further down.
[03:39:21.270 --> 03:39:23.210]  A couple of days.
[03:39:23.210 --> 03:39:25.271]  Jerusalem Post.
[03:39:25.271 --> 03:39:27.673]  January 14th.
[03:39:27.673 --> 03:39:37.777]  Russia's Vladimir Putin, afraid of coup, will retire in 2023.
[03:39:37.777 --> 03:39:39.718]  Keep on going.
[03:39:39.718 --> 03:39:43.880]  Let's go to January 23rd.
[03:39:43.880 --> 03:39:45.761]  War.
[03:39:45.761 --> 03:39:48.082]  Germany will not block tanks.
[03:39:50.811 --> 03:39:54.873]  Can Putin survive?
[03:39:54.873 --> 03:39:56.494]  This is from the week.
[03:39:56.494 --> 03:39:56.914]  The week.
[03:39:56.914 --> 03:40:00.876]  How about a second week?
[03:40:00.876 --> 03:40:02.037]  Can Putin survive?
[03:40:02.037 --> 03:40:07.980]  His goal was to erase Ukraine as a sovereign nation in a matter of days.
[03:40:07.980 --> 03:40:09.000]  No, it wasn't.
[03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:11.381]  Total lie.
[03:40:11.381 --> 03:40:18.325]  Nearly a year later, Ukraine's survival is a much safer bet than Putin's.
[03:40:18.325 --> 03:40:20.386]  I guess you're a losing bet guy, huh?
[03:40:22.571 --> 03:40:23.692]  This guy?
[03:40:23.692 --> 03:40:24.392]  This little clown.
[03:40:24.392 --> 03:40:25.633]  Oh, Peter Weber.
[03:40:25.633 --> 03:40:27.895]  Peter Weber.
[03:40:27.895 --> 03:40:30.137]  Yep.
[03:40:30.137 --> 03:40:32.518]  Look at this.
[03:40:32.518 --> 03:40:34.360]  Yep.
[03:40:34.360 --> 03:40:35.461]  What a disgrace.
[03:40:35.461 --> 03:40:36.441]  What a disgrace.
[03:40:36.441 --> 03:40:37.442]  Not my America.
[03:40:37.442 --> 03:40:40.945]  Oh, by the way, hey, take a trip to L.A.
[03:40:40.945 --> 03:40:43.066]  You're in California there, Pelosi.
[03:40:43.066 --> 03:40:45.868]  You love all those homeless people everywhere?
[03:40:45.868 --> 03:40:47.269]  San Francisco?
[03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:48.911]  Homeless everywhere.
[03:40:48.911 --> 03:40:51.713]  People living in RVs because they can't afford a house.
[03:40:52.617 --> 03:40:56.178]  Oh yeah, because the bigs bought up all the properties.
[03:40:56.178 --> 03:41:04.960]  Oh yeah, but there you are, 64% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck, and how much did it cost us to send Clown Pelosi over there?
[03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:08.221]  Yeah, look what this country's descending into.
[03:41:08.221 --> 03:41:09.481]  Look at it!
[03:41:09.481 --> 03:41:11.562]  Look at it!
[03:41:11.562 --> 03:41:19.644]  Look what these politicians are doing, stealing our money to keep killing people in war, as this country's going down the crapper.
[03:41:20.655 --> 03:41:23.757]  Because we got crap heads in charge.
[03:41:23.757 --> 03:41:26.178]  Who's your favorite freak?
[03:41:26.178 --> 03:41:27.499]  I'm a repulsive king.
[03:41:27.499 --> 03:41:28.439]  I'm a democrat.
[03:41:28.439 --> 03:41:29.720]  Don't forget to vote.
[03:41:29.720 --> 03:41:30.520]  Look at this.
[03:41:30.520 --> 03:41:36.764]  Hey Pelosi, how come you're not walking the streets over there?
[03:41:36.764 --> 03:41:40.346]  It's a disgrace what's happened to this country.
[03:41:40.346 --> 03:41:41.766]  All over.
[03:41:41.766 --> 03:41:48.050]  All over.
[03:41:48.050 --> 03:41:48.390]  Look at this.
[03:41:51.525 --> 03:41:52.726]  Everywhere.
[03:41:52.726 --> 03:41:56.288]  East side, west side, all around the town.
[03:41:56.288 --> 03:42:00.670]  And people aren't getting bashed over their head like they are now.
[03:42:00.670 --> 03:42:05.753]  People aren't going into stores and robbing stuff in broad daylight in front of everybody.
[03:42:05.753 --> 03:42:08.354]  Shooting up, whacked out.
[03:42:08.354 --> 03:42:10.135]  And here we are, waging war.
[03:42:10.135 --> 03:42:13.797]  Half our money went to the military-industrial complex.
[03:42:13.797 --> 03:42:15.678]  Aren't you happy about that?
[03:42:15.678 --> 03:42:19.940]  Hey, our Defense Secretary's really happy about that.
[03:42:19.940 --> 03:42:20.881]  Lloyd Austin.
[03:42:21.448 --> 03:42:22.169]  Yeah!
[03:42:22.169 --> 03:42:24.971]  Murderer Austin in Iraq!
[03:42:24.971 --> 03:42:33.939]  That was the former before he got his job, sat on the board of directors of Raytheon!
[03:42:33.939 --> 03:42:35.460]  Yeah!
[03:42:35.460 --> 03:42:36.981]  Don't get excited, Slitty.
[03:42:36.981 --> 03:42:39.103]  Calm down!
[03:42:39.103 --> 03:42:40.464]  Calm down!
[03:42:40.464 --> 03:42:42.145]  Be a good coward!
[03:42:42.145 --> 03:42:47.029]  Tune in to ABC, CNN, NPR!
[03:42:47.029 --> 03:42:48.671]  How about FU You Know What?
[03:42:49.474 --> 03:42:51.795]  Support Info Wars, you get the truth.
[03:42:51.795 --> 03:42:57.737]  We'll be back and we'll talk about the economy.
[03:42:57.737 --> 03:43:07.720]  The good news is, the real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out, because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.
[03:43:07.720 --> 03:43:11.441]  The bad news is, we need a limited run of it, and it's almost sold out.
[03:43:11.441 --> 03:43:13.802]  So, we're in late January when I'm cutting this?
[03:43:13.802 --> 03:43:18.904]  Only seven days left to get the real Red Pill Plus, with all the key ingredients like preglanone and more,
[03:43:19.304 --> 03:43:19.985]  We're good to go.
[03:43:44.747 --> 03:43:46.869]  You need to try the Real Redfield Plus right now.
[03:43:46.869 --> 03:43:48.370]  Plus it funds the Infowar.
[03:43:48.370 --> 03:43:50.291]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[03:43:50.291 --> 03:43:55.636]  Real Redfield Plus, now available at 50% off at InfowarStore.com for only a few more days.
[03:43:55.636 --> 03:43:59.539]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with a globalist.
[03:44:03.906 --> 03:44:10.312]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[03:44:10.312 --> 03:44:15.417]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[03:44:15.417 --> 03:44:17.159]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:44:17.159 --> 03:44:18.560]  Yes, I've persevered.
[03:44:18.560 --> 03:44:23.585]  But the listeners and viewers who support an InfoWars are the real reason you have the success.
[03:44:24.285 --> 03:44:29.727]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the Noodle Order we've ever had.
[03:44:29.727 --> 03:44:34.048]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:44:34.048 --> 03:44:43.211]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[03:44:43.211 --> 03:44:44.632]  God bless you all.
[03:44:44.632 --> 03:44:45.672]  I salute you.
[03:44:45.672 --> 03:44:46.772]  I thank you.
[03:44:46.772 --> 03:44:52.114]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[03:44:52.694 --> 03:44:54.115]  The fight is my fight.
[03:44:54.115 --> 03:44:54.735]  It's your fight.
[03:44:54.735 --> 03:44:55.495]  It's our fight.
[03:44:55.495 --> 03:44:57.716]  God bless you all.
[03:44:57.716 --> 03:45:07.720]  The good news is the Real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.
[03:45:07.720 --> 03:45:11.441]  The bad news is we need a limited run of it and it's almost sold out.
[03:45:11.441 --> 03:45:13.802]  So we're in late January when I'm cutting this.
[03:45:13.802 --> 03:45:18.904]  Only seven days left to get the Real Red Pill Plus with all the key ingredients like preglanone and more
[03:45:19.284 --> 03:45:19.664]  That's right.
[03:45:42.205 --> 03:45:42.505]  I think so.
[03:45:57.455 --> 03:46:02.218]  The Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[03:46:02.218 --> 03:46:07.422]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[03:46:07.422 --> 03:46:12.266]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[03:46:12.266 --> 03:46:17.209]  Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[03:46:17.209 --> 03:46:26.256]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[03:46:26.716 --> 03:46:39.730]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776point.com.
[03:46:39.730 --> 03:46:43.674]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD,
[03:46:44.375 --> 03:46:45.677]  Three hundred percent.
[03:46:45.677 --> 03:46:48.220]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[03:46:48.220 --> 03:46:54.507]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on what coins remain.
[03:46:54.507 --> 03:46:58.892]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[03:46:58.892 --> 03:47:04.799]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:15.387 --> 03:47:21.232]  Hey, great to be on the Alex Jones Show, and again, everybody, please do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:47:21.232 --> 03:47:24.794]  They got great products there, and a number of them are on sale.
[03:47:24.794 --> 03:47:26.796]  They got their bone brothers coming out.
[03:47:26.796 --> 03:47:32.200]  You know, they got a 25% off, and it's better than before.
[03:47:32.200 --> 03:47:36.343]  And this is great stuff, especially during this winter time.
[03:47:36.343 --> 03:47:38.645]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:47:38.645 --> 03:47:41.007]  They got this ultimate bone broth, and
[03:47:42.333 --> 03:47:47.736]  Again, they're putting out the products and giving you the information, so you're getting it both ways.
[03:47:47.736 --> 03:47:50.498]  You're helping yourself and you're helping them.
[03:47:50.498 --> 03:47:51.638]  So, please do what you can.
[03:47:51.638 --> 03:47:58.882]  You know, I'm just going to finish up a little bit more with this Russian thing and the propaganda they're selling.
[03:47:58.882 --> 03:48:00.443]  This is from Business Insider.
[03:48:00.443 --> 03:48:03.105]  How about Business Outsider?
[03:48:03.105 --> 03:48:09.188]  Russian military chiefs are losing patience with Putin and could soon turn on him in a coup.
[03:48:10.993 --> 03:48:14.034]  Or what former aide predicts.
[03:48:14.034 --> 03:48:20.595]  This is, heh, last Friday.
[03:48:20.595 --> 03:48:37.800]  As Ukrainians are losing, and this is what they keep selling, Zelensky, at the World Economic Conference over there, at the forum in Davos, I'm unsure if Putin is even alive.
[03:48:37.800 --> 03:48:38.480]  And then of course,
[03:48:39.909 --> 03:48:47.351]  The great United States military, that hasn't won a war since World War II, did a great job in shooting down that balloon.
[03:48:47.351 --> 03:48:48.952]  Yeah.
[03:48:48.952 --> 03:48:51.813]  Yeah, pop goes the weasel.
[03:48:51.813 --> 03:48:55.494]  Yep, the pop heard around the world.
[03:48:55.494 --> 03:48:56.274]  What a joke.
[03:48:56.274 --> 03:48:59.555]  Oh, you're going to stop hypersonic missiles coming in?
[03:48:59.555 --> 03:49:01.055]  Oh, yeah, of course we are.
[03:49:01.055 --> 03:49:02.816]  We got the defense system.
[03:49:02.816 --> 03:49:04.437]  Yeah, we just paid $160 trillion for it.
[03:49:04.437 --> 03:49:05.397]  You know, it's great.
[03:49:05.397 --> 03:49:05.477]  Yeah.
[03:49:11.201 --> 03:49:14.022]  You know, people realize, with war, it's the end of life.
[03:49:14.022 --> 03:49:19.805]  No, they don't realize.
[03:49:19.805 --> 03:49:21.205]  And World War III's begun.
[03:49:21.205 --> 03:49:27.968]  It was the cover of our magazine on February 22nd last year, two days before Russia invaded.
[03:49:27.968 --> 03:49:31.890]  Yep.
[03:49:31.890 --> 03:49:34.091]  Russian military chiefs are losing patience.
[03:49:34.091 --> 03:49:36.192]  They're not making this stuff up with Putin.
[03:49:36.192 --> 03:49:38.073]  They could soon turn on him in a coup.
[03:49:38.073 --> 03:49:38.853]  A former aide.
[03:49:39.648 --> 03:49:40.949]  You know, a former aide.
[03:49:40.949 --> 03:49:44.052]  Well, if the aide says so, then, you know.
[03:49:44.052 --> 03:49:45.633]  And that's all they do.
[03:49:45.633 --> 03:49:50.757]  It's keep selling the people that the war should keep going.
[03:49:50.757 --> 03:49:54.280]  So I want to talk a little bit about the economy.
[03:49:54.280 --> 03:50:03.207]  And the big thing happened on, you know, last week, on Friday, was the job numbers came out.
[03:50:03.207 --> 03:50:06.609]  And they said that over 560 something thousand jobs were created.
[03:50:09.608 --> 03:50:17.772]  But then when you look at the real data, compared to a year ago, there were 2.5 million less jobs.
[03:50:17.772 --> 03:50:26.096]  And our forecast was that they would raise interest rates only 25 basis points, which they did.
[03:50:26.096 --> 03:50:36.140]  And we said, when they raise them 25 basis points, gold prices will go up, and so will the markets, which they did.
[03:50:36.140 --> 03:50:37.881]  And then they reversed on Friday.
[03:50:38.737 --> 03:50:43.121]  So is this a real number or will it be adjusted?
[03:50:43.121 --> 03:50:56.571]  Because each week in the Trends Journal, for the last 26 weeks, we've been detailing the major firings going off around the country.
[03:50:56.571 --> 03:51:04.738]  High-tech, one company after another, not only high-tech, all throughout, you know, furniture companies, on and on.
[03:51:05.840 --> 03:51:13.222]  Uh, and, and another big one is temporary workers.
[03:51:13.222 --> 03:51:22.724]  36,000 temporary workers were fired in December during the height of holiday shopping.
[03:51:22.724 --> 03:51:25.444]  You hire people during that time, don't you?
[03:51:25.444 --> 03:51:26.684]  Yeah.
[03:51:26.684 --> 03:51:27.705]  But you mean they got fired?
[03:51:27.705 --> 03:51:28.125]  That's right.
[03:51:28.125 --> 03:51:29.825]  You know why they got fired?
[03:51:29.825 --> 03:51:32.986]  Because retail sales were going down.
[03:51:32.986 --> 03:51:33.306]  Okay.
[03:51:33.306 --> 03:51:34.786]  Retail sales are going down.
[03:51:35.632 --> 03:51:47.197]  Temp workers, and by the way, the temporary workers that were fired, yeah, as I said, 35,000.
[03:51:47.197 --> 03:51:50.158]  It is a real warning sign.
[03:51:50.158 --> 03:51:52.780]  You go back to the panic of 08.
[03:51:52.780 --> 03:51:54.881]  By the way, I took that domain name out in 2007.
[03:51:54.881 --> 03:52:00.823]  That's where they've started firing first.
[03:52:00.823 --> 03:52:02.664]  You go back to the dot-com bust.
[03:52:03.373 --> 03:52:06.175]  They start firing the temporary workers.
[03:52:06.175 --> 03:52:10.218]  So these numbers to us aren't realistic.
[03:52:10.218 --> 03:52:13.040]  But here's the bottom line.
[03:52:13.040 --> 03:52:16.722]  And the bottom line is it's all going down.
[03:52:16.722 --> 03:52:18.123]  The markets are a rigged game.
[03:52:18.123 --> 03:52:22.106]  Where they're going, anybody, it's guess time.
[03:52:22.106 --> 03:52:28.271]  The Federal Reserve, the central banksters will do anything they can to keep artificially propping up the economy.
[03:52:28.271 --> 03:52:29.712]  But even this 25% rate hike
[03:52:33.601 --> 03:52:39.563]  Is going to bring down the economy.
[03:52:39.563 --> 03:52:44.525]  Sales are going down across the board.
[03:52:44.525 --> 03:52:49.026]  So, we are looking for a continued decline.
[03:52:49.026 --> 03:52:56.029]  When they meet again in March, they're going to raise them another 25 basis points.
[03:52:56.029 --> 03:53:00.010]  That's going to bring the economy down even more.
[03:53:00.010 --> 03:53:02.391]  So, it's definitely going to be an economic downturn.
[03:53:03.504 --> 03:53:16.048]  The biggest crisis on the real estate front that virtually no one is talking about is in the commercial office sector.
[03:53:16.048 --> 03:53:27.232]  You're looking now, and this is according to Castle with a K, their reports just over 50%, it's like 50.4% or something like that.
[03:53:31.676 --> 03:53:40.858]  Of office occupancy in the 10 major cities, 50.4% in the 10 major cities.
[03:53:40.858 --> 03:53:42.999]  That's what the office occupancy rate is.
[03:53:42.999 --> 03:53:48.741]  So it's down 50% from where it was.
[03:53:48.741 --> 03:53:53.602]  All the businesses that depended on commuters, gone.
[03:53:53.602 --> 03:53:55.822]  No more happy hours.
[03:53:55.822 --> 03:53:57.943]  All the people used to go out to lunch, ain't lunchin'.
[03:54:02.102 --> 03:54:05.163]  Now interest rates are going up.
[03:54:05.163 --> 03:54:11.044]  You got variable rates on a lot of these commercial sectors.
[03:54:11.044 --> 03:54:16.445]  And you got a lot of junk bonds in there, too.
[03:54:16.445 --> 03:54:25.907]  There's going to be a crash in this sector, the likes of which are unparalleled in modern history.
[03:54:25.907 --> 03:54:29.628]  People are not going to go back to work if it gets up even to 60%.
[03:54:31.243 --> 03:54:33.104]  You lost 40%.
[03:54:33.104 --> 03:54:43.272]  Oh, by the way, the offices were overbuilt in 2019 before they started the COVID war.
[03:54:43.272 --> 03:54:57.323]  And then the dollar is going to, this is the, we are nearing the end of dollar dominance.
[03:54:57.323 --> 03:54:58.784]  The Chinese in India,
[03:55:00.163 --> 03:55:10.549]  Are doing business with the Yuan.
[03:55:10.549 --> 03:55:21.756]  The companies that are buying Russian oil, the countries, they're dealing in the ruble.
[03:55:21.756 --> 03:55:25.478]  When the dollar goes down, that's the end of America.
[03:55:25.478 --> 03:55:27.940]  It crashes like the British Empire did.
[03:55:29.372 --> 03:55:32.134]  At World War One.
[03:55:32.134 --> 03:55:35.597]  The sun never set on the British Empire, the war mongers.
[03:55:35.597 --> 03:55:40.861]  That America, we got that strain in America, the war mongers.
[03:55:40.861 --> 03:55:42.282]  So the dollar's gonna go out.
[03:55:42.282 --> 03:55:46.585]  The dollar's on its way.
[03:55:46.585 --> 03:55:49.388]  How fast, how long it will take?
[03:55:49.388 --> 03:55:53.070]  There are wild cards out there.
[03:55:53.070 --> 03:55:57.434]  But remember, when all else fails, they take us to war.
[03:55:58.709 --> 03:56:01.911]  And that's what they're doing.
[03:56:01.911 --> 03:56:04.792]  And now the war with China ramping up.
[03:56:04.792 --> 03:56:10.975]  Another arrogant guy just got elected over there, President of the Czech Republic.
[03:56:10.975 --> 03:56:14.417]  Former General.
[03:56:14.417 --> 03:56:22.621]  Warning the Czech people that we have to build up our defense to fight China.
[03:56:22.621 --> 03:56:25.062]  What if China was down in the Gulf of Mexico?
[03:56:26.323 --> 03:56:30.746]  Oh, it's okay for America to go through the Taiwan Straits?
[03:56:30.746 --> 03:56:33.828]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:56:33.828 --> 03:56:38.111]  And this economy is failing, and society is failing in front of us.
[03:56:38.111 --> 03:56:42.594]  It breaks my heart to see how low we've gone.
[03:56:42.594 --> 03:56:53.341]  And I love going watching InfoWars now, the guys, you know, Harris and Owen, how they dress, and they still have style and class and grace.
[03:56:53.341 --> 03:56:55.102]  And people are dressed like slobs now.
[03:56:56.334 --> 03:57:03.316]  I go into high-class restaurants and guys my age wearing baseball caps.
[03:57:03.316 --> 03:57:05.157]  And the young people have them on backwards.
[03:57:05.157 --> 03:57:08.318]  What are you going to put the catcher's mask on next?
[03:57:08.318 --> 03:57:09.739]  This country's going down.
[03:57:09.739 --> 03:57:14.400]  And to me, the only thing that's going to solve it is a renaissance.
[03:57:14.400 --> 03:57:19.462]  To bring back the joy and beauty of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:57:19.462 --> 03:57:22.863]  And the people on InfoWars are doing that, and we're doing it with the Trends Journal.
[03:57:23.596 --> 03:57:25.118]  TrendsJournal.com.

[03:58:46.795 --> 03:58:59.473]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[03:58:59.473 --> 03:59:02.678]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[03:59:03.459 --> 03:59:05.740]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
