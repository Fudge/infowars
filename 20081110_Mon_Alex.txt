[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:20.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:38.480]  welcome ladies and gentlemen it is November 10, 2008 on this Monday edition glad that you have
[00:38.480 --> 00:45.920]  joined us we're gonna have wide open phones for the full four hours today I do have Dr. Jerome
[00:45.920 --> 00:51.680]  Corsi joining us post-election he wrote the abomination book the media didn't really attack
[00:51.680 --> 00:57.200]  him on any of his facts but that went after him via character assassination and I don't necessarily
[00:57.200 --> 01:03.600]  agree with the Dr. Corsi on a lot of things but his criticism of Barack Obama is very important
[01:03.600 --> 01:10.400]  and he is our president now the big grand distraction from what the real government is doing in the
[01:10.400 --> 01:17.360]  background so we'll look at now going forward what Dr. Corsi will do to try to counter Barack
[01:17.920 --> 01:24.640]  H. Obama and well what the wars were like for him in the last six months since his book came out
[01:24.640 --> 01:30.240]  with the mainstream media last time we ran into Corsi was outside the big hotel where all the
[01:30.240 --> 01:37.840]  politicians were staying in Denver then after Dr. Corsi joins us so for 30 minutes Professor
[01:37.840 --> 01:42.480]  Michelle Chasadowski will be joining us he's got an important article out
[01:43.040 --> 01:49.200]  detailing who exactly is behind the economic collapse and how it is engineered and being
[01:49.200 --> 01:56.160]  carried out to bring in a new world order now we told you that the international banks were
[01:56.160 --> 02:01.440]  going to create a worldwide financial implosion of credit and then offer the solution being a
[02:01.440 --> 02:08.080]  world government run for and by the central banks I saw that in five different mainstream
[02:08.080 --> 02:15.040]  headlines this morning and I didn't do as much preparation today as I normally do
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.400]  and because I've been under the weather somewhat so I'm not even looking for this
[02:22.960 --> 02:30.880]  and it's in my face it's just everywhere I mean here is the London Telegraph today second biggest
[02:30.880 --> 02:37.360]  paper in England Gordon Brown calls for new world order to beat recession
[02:39.360 --> 02:44.000]  but the banks totally take over everything they already basically have control of everything
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.320]  but give them open the governmental power worldwide that's what they say there
[02:49.520 --> 02:54.400]  meanwhile yuppies are still snickering and laughing about world government the new world order
[02:54.400 --> 03:00.880]  uh folks you've already been taken to the cleaners you've already been irreverently robbed
[03:02.480 --> 03:08.160]  I suggest you stop being arrogant about it and stop denying the position we're all in together
[03:08.160 --> 03:12.880]  and then we try to really turn things around we don't have time to be in a four or eight-year
[03:12.880 --> 03:17.200]  love fest with Barack Obama we don't have time to believe fairy tales that he actually runs
[03:17.200 --> 03:25.360]  something or that he has different policies uh than other puppets before him we've got to grow
[03:25.360 --> 03:30.640]  up and address the military industrial complex that is doing whatever it wants in our society
[03:30.640 --> 03:36.480]  which is looting and stealing and expanding a police state to protect themselves to protect
[03:36.480 --> 03:40.400]  themselves from the crimes they've committed that's what they're that's what a tyranny is about
[03:41.760 --> 03:46.560]  also later in the show probably in the fourth hour so I can show it on the document cam
[03:46.560 --> 03:49.360]  the president planet dot tv viewers when we go live in the fourth hour
[03:52.640 --> 04:01.120]  I uh was over my parents last night for dinner and uh back on the back porch that's where they
[04:01.120 --> 04:08.240]  have got their cockatoo so it was literally waiting to be birdcage liner there were two
[04:08.240 --> 04:17.120]  austin american statesmen sitting there and just looking at two papers sitting there I saw
[04:18.560 --> 04:27.200]  editorial cartoons that were almost identical to the editorial cartoon I saw in newsweek magazine
[04:27.200 --> 04:33.920]  this week and then so this morning I got this morning's paper here in austin there were a couple
[04:33.920 --> 04:40.400]  more of the same cartoons and then I went online briefly and found hundreds of them again showing
[04:40.400 --> 04:46.240]  unified brainwashing and I'll tell you what that unified brainwashing is when we get back but in
[04:46.240 --> 04:50.560]  the fourth hour and I'm going to show you on the document cam exactly what I'm talking about this
[04:50.560 --> 04:55.360]  is literally the tip of the iceberg so everybody to send these into me so I can use them in an
[04:55.360 --> 05:04.320]  upcoming film hello friends this is alex jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[05:04.320 --> 05:08.320]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent
[05:08.320 --> 05:12.640]  and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own
[05:12.640 --> 05:17.120]  bread you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for female to take care of your family in
[05:17.120 --> 05:21.920]  any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:21.920 --> 05:26.480]  of a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and
[05:26.480 --> 05:32.080]  email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the
[05:32.080 --> 05:37.440]  american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings
[05:37.440 --> 05:42.800]  to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans reach
[05:42.800 --> 05:48.160]  in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached
[05:48.160 --> 05:53.760]  over 4 billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[05:53.760 --> 05:58.320]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores
[05:58.320 --> 06:03.280]  enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business
[06:03.280 --> 06:08.400]  whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing out on food
[06:08.400 --> 06:13.200]  one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[06:13.200 --> 06:18.160]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's
[06:18.160 --> 06:22.160]  very important for you understand that by having a supply of storable food the government the new
[06:22.160 --> 06:27.120]  old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[06:27.120 --> 06:31.360]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[06:31.360 --> 06:36.320]  you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from ecoli salmonella
[06:36.320 --> 06:41.120]  genetic alteration or chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery

[07:06.640 --> 07:22.560]  storable food ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[07:22.560 --> 07:37.200]  we're gonna open the phones up today we'll talk about any issue you'd like to discuss
[07:37.840 --> 07:41.280]  first-time callers if you volunteer that your first-time caller
[07:41.280 --> 07:49.360]  you will go to the head of the line 1-800-259-9231 and if you disagree with me you go to the head
[07:49.360 --> 07:58.240]  of the line 1-800-259-9231 well the Pentagon and foreign governments are saying that a
[07:58.240 --> 08:04.320]  summit in laden is going to pop up and we're going to have an al-cieta attack sometime in between
[08:05.360 --> 08:11.040]  the transition in the next two and a half months or after the transition to test our new leader
[08:12.640 --> 08:19.120]  this is just like clockwork this is um meant to sell the public on the idea that a the
[08:19.120 --> 08:26.240]  president actually runs something and that be al-cieta is real and is threatening us and
[08:26.240 --> 08:29.600]  that's why the government's stealing all of our money and looting the pension funds and
[08:31.120 --> 08:36.480]  trying to force inoculations on us and surveilling us and feeding on us it's not because we've got
[08:36.480 --> 08:40.880]  total criminals that have overtaken us that are just raping the daylights out of us financially
[08:40.880 --> 08:47.520]  and culturally it's not that they need a smoke screen to set up their control grid to fully
[08:47.520 --> 08:54.640]  rob us and to take the velvet glove off of the iron fist it's because al-qaeda is out there and the
[08:54.640 --> 09:00.960]  government cares so much about you to keep you safe from them that's why they're taking all your
[09:00.960 --> 09:05.280]  liberties so that al-qaeda won't want to attack anymore because the terrorists attack because
[09:05.280 --> 09:13.120]  they hate our freedom but i i i have never seen such hype and except for right before 9-11
[09:13.120 --> 09:18.240]  where they're just saying we're gonna get hit we're gonna get hit and then oh al-qaeda hit
[09:18.240 --> 09:24.400]  the american flags will go back out on all the front porches and whatever obama says we do
[09:25.680 --> 09:29.200]  i may be a good old boy and i didn't like him because he was black but
[09:30.080 --> 09:35.600]  he got tough after al-qaeda hit us i do believe we need a new car ran there behind it
[09:35.600 --> 09:44.400]  but wait there's sheites and those are sunnis shut up al-qaeda boy anybody that questions
[09:44.400 --> 10:00.000]  obama is an al-qaeda there is no end to it 1-800-259-9231 warning of new bin laden attack
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.960]  well some have been laden is planning an attack against the united states that will
[10:05.600 --> 10:12.240]  outdo by far september 11th an arab newspaper in london has reported of course it turns out most
[10:12.240 --> 10:19.040]  your major newspapers not some most are funded hundreds of millions of dollars a year to put out
[10:19.040 --> 10:25.520]  pro-west brainwashing can just google that and not even hidden bin laden planning you was attack
[10:25.520 --> 10:32.720]  gold undo September 11th to outdo it al-qaeda reinforces training camps oh you see they're
[10:32.720 --> 10:39.520]  depoliticizing things now with george bush see oh it was all george bush it was for torture and
[10:39.520 --> 10:48.480]  secret arrest and falsifying weapons reports and it was george bush that did all those things but
[10:48.480 --> 10:55.360]  now that obama is coming to the fore why al-qaeda is right back out there again they want more
[10:55.360 --> 11:01.360]  countries in the middle east and central asia invaded and dominated and crushed and so that's
[11:01.360 --> 11:06.320]  what the arabs want they want to strike the u.s so the u.s can come blown to bits that's just
[11:06.320 --> 11:11.920]  exactly what real arabs and real muslims want that's the complete opposite but doesn't matter
[11:11.920 --> 11:18.160]  it's a good narrative for a population that can't find i reckon i ran on a map they think it's australia
[11:18.160 --> 11:26.640]  and see suddenly none of it matters suddenly it doesn't matter if all the warren's wiretapping
[11:26.640 --> 11:31.360]  stays in place with the pentagon's announcing local police are going to use the spy satellites to
[11:31.360 --> 11:35.760]  watch the american people or it doesn't matter if the pentagon's running the face scanning and
[11:35.760 --> 11:40.400]  license plate reading cameras or it doesn't matter if they're banning protest demonstrations all over
[11:40.400 --> 11:50.320]  the country it doesn't matter and barack obama voted for all of that because the media is just
[11:50.320 --> 11:56.480]  not going to talk about it anymore and make it a political issue that then automatically cements it
[11:56.480 --> 12:03.520]  all patriot act what patriot act iraq war what iraq war the troops are going to stay there
[12:04.160 --> 12:07.920]  barack obama now is admitting that basically they're never leaving they're just going to
[12:07.920 --> 12:13.760]  rotate the larger force in the pakistan and other countries but a large force will stay there
[12:13.760 --> 12:21.200]  basically forever just like germany or south korea and now it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
[12:21.200 --> 12:28.560]  we've got change the only change is we're not worried anymore about it because it isn't evil
[12:28.560 --> 12:37.280]  george bush doing the puppet it's a new puppet so to finish up my story i am uh
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  out on the back porch area where the washing machines are and
[12:46.240 --> 12:50.480]  you know the bird cage with a cockatoo in it when it's not in the house walking around chewing on
[12:50.480 --> 13:02.080]  furniture i'm visiting my parents last night and look down and i see an editorial in the sunday
[13:02.080 --> 13:06.720]  statesman there's actually a whole page of editorials each one basically the same
[13:09.120 --> 13:15.040]  saying that barack obama is a savior and the barack obama is going to fix everything under
[13:15.040 --> 13:20.720]  the sun so i started flipping through the newspapers and
[13:23.600 --> 13:24.880]  notice that it wasn't just the
[13:28.480 --> 13:31.040]  editorial cartoons it was the headlines themselves
[13:32.960 --> 13:35.520]  and i knew they were calling him the one the savior
[13:36.720 --> 13:41.520]  the one to change the world the the chosen one the one foretold
[13:41.520 --> 13:48.000]  but i opened up a news week in my parents house yesterday
[13:49.840 --> 13:53.440]  and it's got the same type of editorial i know you're seeing these everywhere
[13:54.080 --> 13:56.880]  and it's it's obama sitting behind the oval office desk
[14:02.400 --> 14:08.320]  and he's sitting behind the oval office desk and the and it says us constitution we the people
[14:08.320 --> 14:15.360]  and it's been torn up in about 50 pieces but he's putting the last piece with tape back together again
[14:18.400 --> 14:22.000]  and then in the statesman yesterday they had a whole page of these similar
[14:23.120 --> 14:30.160]  cartoons and then this morning this is just my local paper it's the same thing it's a
[14:30.160 --> 14:41.680]  barack obama comes up into the attic and he opens it up this is white house attic and he says hey
[14:41.680 --> 14:48.080]  cool old stuff and it says fragile government of the people by the people for the people
[14:50.080 --> 14:55.440]  and he's looking at it saying hey cool old stuff like he's cool
[14:55.440 --> 15:01.680]  cool now this is form over substance
[15:04.320 --> 15:09.920]  barack obama is racing ahead we're now getting more of his concrete policies on his website
[15:09.920 --> 15:14.800]  his transition site change.gov and the people he's appointing and i mean ladies and gentlemen
[15:14.800 --> 15:21.360]  it is corporate looting from one end of the other it is fascism it is secret police gun control
[15:21.360 --> 15:30.080]  open borders end of sovereignty bigger trade deals more nafta and gat expansions of the
[15:30.080 --> 15:36.960]  n a u and you've got the public this is south park that aired a few nights ago after the election
[15:38.480 --> 15:42.800]  i mean there are a couple minutes of this and and and this isn't even a joke though i watched
[15:42.800 --> 15:49.680]  part of the south park episode this morning and it wasn't even a joke and and in the episode
[15:49.680 --> 15:56.160]  mccain and obama are really working behind the scenes just to rob the american people
[15:56.160 --> 16:01.440]  they want to steal the hope diamond but it's an analogy or a parallel kind of a parable of
[16:02.800 --> 16:06.560]  they're really working for a secret establishment and and really are using the election as a
[16:06.560 --> 16:12.640]  diversion to rob you and you know the south park guys they like people knowing on the inside that
[16:12.640 --> 16:24.160]  they're fully aware of everything that's happening and going on so this isn't even a joke this little
[16:25.040 --> 16:31.920]  fictitious piece you know where they describe the way obama supporters are acting this is how
[16:31.920 --> 16:37.200]  they're really acting and they have no idea i feel so sorry for him i mean i'm just i see him on
[16:37.200 --> 16:42.000]  tv i see him on the street the people are walking around in days with smiles like they're zombies
[16:42.000 --> 16:47.520]  just totally loving towards everyone oh my god everything's wonderful i mean i've got all these
[16:47.520 --> 16:50.400]  youtube clips we played some last week maybe i should dig them back out and play them again
[16:50.400 --> 16:54.880]  when they're saying i'm never going to have a problem again in my life i never have to worry
[16:54.880 --> 17:05.680]  about my bills gas insurance it's my life is saved i i meanwhile obama is going to completely
[17:05.680 --> 17:10.640]  betray them but see when somebody's dedicated to being a sucker they will go along with almost
[17:10.640 --> 17:17.040]  anything i know you're beating me i know you're hurting me but it's for good purposes i guess
[17:18.400 --> 17:22.720]  they're gonna get so much done with obama ladies and gentlemen see the government was
[17:22.720 --> 17:29.120]  stalling it was discredited people were waking up but now now we'll have to get suckered because
[17:29.120 --> 17:35.600]  well he's black and he's cool and the media says he's slick he wants to fix the bill rights
[17:35.600 --> 17:40.480]  and see for the weak-minded they don't know what the bill of rights is what the constitution is
[17:40.480 --> 17:44.400]  they don't know what their rights are they don't know how the system really works her admiralty law
[17:44.400 --> 17:52.400]  or so they just hear oh he fixed it my bill of rights isn't in trouble anymore meanwhile he's
[17:52.400 --> 18:01.360]  racing ahead to kill it let's go ahead and play part of this clip yeah obama we did it we did it
[18:01.360 --> 18:07.120]  it's been a long time coming because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining

[23:48.560 --> 23:56.800]  today i mean i have the cover of the austin chronicle here and it says fun fun fun post
[23:56.800 --> 24:11.600]  election cuddling begins on page 24 and then the chronicle had cartoons with obama saving the
[24:11.600 --> 24:18.880]  bill of rights and constitution and images of people crying and valhalla uh embracing everyone
[24:18.880 --> 24:26.640]  all of this great love all of this great racial love black folks saying oh i guess america
[24:26.640 --> 24:32.640]  isn't really racist well that's right the majority of white people in the united states are the
[24:32.640 --> 24:42.560]  opposite of racist and tribal they hate themselves they believe they're evil they worship anyone
[24:42.560 --> 24:51.600]  who's not white and think it's very trendy they hate their own group uh and uh go around buying
[24:51.600 --> 24:59.920]  into anything that they think makes them a tone for them whether it's global carbon taxes uh or
[24:59.920 --> 25:06.960]  you name it and so they will never it doesn't matter what barack obama does and they don't want
[25:06.960 --> 25:12.080]  to admit they're wrong they don't admit they've been conned or taken for a ride he could do anything
[25:12.080 --> 25:18.160]  just like george bush could do almost anything gun control open borders triple the size of government
[25:18.160 --> 25:25.280]  gay porn stars in the white house every day for nighttime visits you know gay madams
[25:26.240 --> 25:31.840]  hordes of you know sex teams coming in you you tell a neocon that you can pull up mainstream
[25:31.840 --> 25:43.280]  articles they go in true in true liberal lives my point is barack obama could do anything
[25:43.280 --> 25:47.760]  anything because the way he's been framed it's a new religion
[25:50.400 --> 25:54.240]  just like a global warming they've it now proven it's the sun they've now proven carbon
[25:54.240 --> 25:59.840]  dioxide is good for the earth at even 10 times its current level good for plants so they go okay
[25:59.840 --> 26:06.480]  it's now climate change and the earth's climate can never change and there's any change it's bad
[26:06.480 --> 26:13.600]  of course changes the only constant they're not going to admit they were wrong or conned
[26:13.600 --> 26:18.720]  that's why the club of rome and the cfr and un came up with this in the 60s climate change
[26:18.720 --> 26:23.200]  and they said whether it's cold or hot we'll say either way it's caused by carbon dioxide that
[26:23.200 --> 26:28.720]  lets us regulate and tax every facet of life this is a great control mechanism and they will
[26:28.720 --> 26:35.120]  publicly laugh that it's not about the environment but you've got a bunch of suckers who do they're
[26:35.120 --> 26:40.320]  not into really knowing what goes on in the world they're not into being empowered they'd rather
[26:40.320 --> 26:46.240]  just live in a virtual reality where they just make it up and go protest the local airport saying
[26:46.240 --> 26:52.400]  ban all aircraft no one should be allowed to fly back to the stone age a plane when you ride on a
[26:52.400 --> 26:57.600]  plane it causes more damage than your entire carbon footprint all year well we'll just pay an
[26:57.600 --> 27:02.480]  indulgence tax kind of people would go to the catholic church and say well i cheated on my wife
[27:02.480 --> 27:08.320]  oh that's okay uh just buy these indulgences uh you'll pay us a thousand talons and gold and uh
[27:09.200 --> 27:13.680]  you'll uh you'll be and there's people all over awesome where i live driving around with carbon
[27:13.680 --> 27:22.160]  indulgences then you just go to some scam artist company and they say well we then go um we then
[27:22.160 --> 27:31.440]  go plant trees to offset your carbon footprint and then of course the the scammer running it
[27:31.440 --> 27:38.560]  keeps most the money and by the way a tree does breathe carbon dioxide and does offset it then
[27:38.560 --> 27:42.080]  the real hardcore global warming fanatics they say well we got to go ahead and cut down all the
[27:42.080 --> 27:48.960]  trees because when they die they offload even more carbon it's idiocy and so same thing with
[27:48.960 --> 27:59.120]  barack obama you've got people now for trendiness or whatever reasons this has been framed in the
[27:59.120 --> 28:06.080]  media that this is the end of all problems this is the end of problems on earth he is the leader
[28:07.040 --> 28:09.520]  but then of course things aren't going to get better they're going to get worse and that's
[28:09.520 --> 28:16.720]  going to be because you didn't go along with the leader and then as anyone criticizes the one
[28:16.720 --> 28:22.720]  the leader it'll be because they're they're not trendy they're backwards they're mindless they're
[28:22.720 --> 28:27.440]  they're horrible and if you point out hey he's for the whole police state you know you notice
[28:27.440 --> 28:30.960]  the whole police state that went in under bush he didn't do any of it he's a puppet
[28:31.600 --> 28:36.080]  it's just expanding under obama obama is not lifting one finger to slow it down
[28:38.560 --> 28:44.000]  let's see they don't care they'll show like children cartoons in the newspapers and tv
[28:44.000 --> 28:50.960]  saying he fixed it he glued it back together and the childlike mind goes oh he fixed it

[32:44.240 --> 32:52.960]  i um it's real simple as things get worse and worse you're gonna have the obamaoid kool-aid
[32:52.960 --> 33:00.400]  drinkers get more and more disillusion and those that break ranks will be ostracized will be
[33:00.400 --> 33:09.520]  excommunicated uh and conservatives are going to be attacking obama for all the wrong reasons
[33:09.520 --> 33:14.000]  playing into the left right paradigm and then meanwhile the whole agenda just continues i i
[33:14.000 --> 33:20.000]  cannot state clearly enough that obama is a giant distraction and diversion and i know i said that
[33:20.000 --> 33:27.280]  about bush but even more so with barack obama i mean everything is about him running the show
[33:27.280 --> 33:31.920]  and what is he going to do and what are his policies going to be we know what his policies are
[33:31.920 --> 33:36.560]  and everything over the globalist to help set up world government help kill the dollar
[33:36.560 --> 33:43.120]  and launch a bunch of new wars then continue the police state but the childlike mind of the

[34:06.320 --> 34:12.720]  accountability to government but meanwhile he's bringing in the exact same guard the old guard
[34:12.720 --> 34:19.840]  that looted and robbed and set up the banking scam he's the guy that helped bull whip the congress
[34:21.200 --> 34:25.200]  into passing the banker takeover bill and now they can do whatever they want that's in the bill
[34:25.920 --> 34:29.760]  every weekly here oh they're gonna get hundreds of billions more and give them to bankers
[34:30.400 --> 34:35.040]  and then you'll hear the news go well there are some controls on what the ceo's can get and it says
[34:35.040 --> 34:41.680]  yes you know the ceo can only have a 500 million dollar bonus off this money and yes the shareholders
[34:41.680 --> 34:46.880]  can only have you know this much of the money i mean it is just absolute fraud

[35:22.480 --> 35:29.440]  boy if i got a story for you three months ago i applied for an interlevel position with the fbi
[35:29.440 --> 35:36.160]  right yes okay a month and a half ago i went through all the tests i had to do a background check a
[35:36.160 --> 35:41.680]  credit history a physical then a psychiatric evaluation where they try to make you thank you
[35:41.680 --> 35:46.720]  crazy even though you know you're not but maybe you think you are but anyway past all that i got a
[35:46.720 --> 35:53.600]  letter two weeks ago saying congratulations i had met all the criteria you know they was looking forward
[35:53.600 --> 35:59.360]  to working with me and helping keep america and the world safe well i thought all right i'm looking
[35:59.360 --> 36:06.560]  forward to it too well even before yesterday two black lincoln's pulled up in my driveway i'm thinking
[36:06.560 --> 36:12.960]  boy they got the wrong house well they get out too nicely dressed me in one woman and the driver
[36:12.960 --> 36:18.400]  one of the drivers was sitting in another car come up knock on my door i opened the door thinking
[36:18.400 --> 36:26.320]  what do they want well he says is this the residence of in the name i said maybe it was like once again
[36:26.320 --> 36:31.760]  this is the residence i thought well maybe this is serious yes it is and they said we have a
[36:31.760 --> 36:37.280]  ever raster for you would you please open it to see that you understand it right here in front of
[36:37.280 --> 36:44.480]  us i said okay well i'll open it up and it said dear michael it said we are sorry we were great to
[36:44.480 --> 36:51.760]  inform you that you are no longer eligible for any uh an interlevel or any other positions within the
[36:51.760 --> 36:58.800]  federal government and i thought why this is any questions you may have you may call this 800 number
[36:58.800 --> 37:06.320]  is big to a representative about it so i asked i asked um i guess uh secret service or whoever
[37:06.320 --> 37:10.800]  there was a pulled up in my driveway what was it all about they were like do you understand the
[37:10.800 --> 37:15.680]  procedure you need to take now to find out the information you need to know i was like what do
[37:15.680 --> 37:21.120]  i call this number they're like okay good they turn around they leave i thought what's going on so i
[37:21.120 --> 37:28.960]  call 800 number and get this the reason why i am not eligible for a any kind of job in the federal
[37:28.960 --> 37:36.000]  government is because i am an as a listener of the alex jones show through the internet connections
[37:37.280 --> 37:44.640]  no joke and i said you got to be kidding me are you kidding me and no seriously i was turned down
[37:44.640 --> 37:50.000]  after i passed everything well they even told you but see again they're not supposed to be watching
[37:50.000 --> 37:55.600]  where everybody goes and what they do but everything it's all in assay the phone companies
[37:55.600 --> 38:01.520]  are the nsa everything surveilled everything's watched it's all every time they do that that's
[38:01.520 --> 38:07.120]  a felony they should go to prison for that but see they retroactively went and had them pass
[38:07.120 --> 38:12.560]  the faiza law but still that doesn't cover what they're doing there so i'd like you to send me

[39:34.240 --> 39:39.840]  i told him when i called in and i said yes i said i gave him a name you know you had to go
[39:39.840 --> 39:43.680]  through you know your social security number and all that and then they're like they didn't ask him
[39:43.680 --> 39:48.800]  what i was calling for they already knew and they said yes they said the reason for this phone call
[39:48.800 --> 39:56.960]  were assuming is because of the letter you received and i was yeah and they said well here's the
[39:56.960 --> 40:02.960]  reasons why and they you know they already knew why i was calling it was like some kind of
[40:02.960 --> 40:07.360]  men in black thing you know where they know and it's all about other omnipresent and
[40:07.360 --> 40:13.920]  and you know and how we're a bunch of fluoride heads uh now i'll continue though with specifically
[40:14.480 --> 40:20.880]  they then said um i mean you didn't ask well why are you why are you tracking what i listened to
[40:21.600 --> 40:28.080]  i was just so shocked at the you know to me it was a bs reason you know because i have no
[40:28.080 --> 40:32.800]  criminal background you know i was no no no no it's criminal to know that they're criminals
[40:32.800 --> 40:39.440]  it's you see they're looking for people they're looking for people of low moral character who
[40:39.440 --> 40:44.320]  think they have moral character it's a certain type of weak-minded person that'll commit crimes
[40:44.320 --> 40:49.120]  commit evil but as long as authority tells them it's okay they'll do it and and they're look i mean
[40:49.120 --> 40:55.440]  certainly i mean but you didn't say to the person wasn't a man or a woman it was a lady i spoke to
[40:55.440 --> 41:02.560]  you didn't say it says in the future uh they're going to control having a job anywhere that's
[41:02.560 --> 41:09.200]  what the cashless society is about and and then i guess the future is now huh well for you it is
[41:09.840 --> 41:15.440]  working because of the see the fbi is a is a private mercenary army for the private
[41:15.440 --> 41:24.720]  federal reserve and uh that's who they serve and um just unbelievably enumerably wicked and
[41:24.720 --> 41:29.280]  dangerous so you wanted to go i guess you do computer work or be a clerical person or something
[41:29.280 --> 41:34.960]  and they just don't want that but the but just to be clear sir you didn't say to her how do you
[41:34.960 --> 41:40.640]  know what i listened to yeah i said i said well what they got to do with anything like that
[41:41.200 --> 41:46.400]  and she said we'll be sending you information regarding and so i'm thinking what they send me
[41:46.400 --> 41:52.480]  that and it is illegal so i'm thinking either not gonna send me anything to just gonna blow me off
[41:52.480 --> 41:59.440]  no no no the main reason they did that was there there could be some laws about them recording
[41:59.440 --> 42:04.320]  you at your doorstep to use it admissible but when you called i'm sure the phone system told
[42:04.320 --> 42:10.720]  you it was being recorded so they wanted to opt in and then interrogate you to then be able to
[42:10.720 --> 42:18.480]  trigger it somehow uh to then be able to use that against you well you see it's all about
[42:18.480 --> 42:23.280]  what's in the whole government's about using our goodwill and our decency and our gullibility
[42:23.280 --> 42:28.240]  so they the criminals can use us and abuse us and their whole system is about reveling and
[42:28.240 --> 42:34.720]  tricking us and reveling in the bad guys always winning and reveling in in in protecting corruption
[42:34.720 --> 42:41.040]  and reveling in in just carrying out evil upon evil and in tricking us and laughing at us and
[42:41.040 --> 42:43.920]  it's just all about reveling in the destruction of the country
[42:43.920 --> 42:49.280]  so i mean i'm not kidding i mean they're just stealing everything i mean it's a criminal
[42:49.280 --> 42:54.320]  government it's in the Denver post that the cops it's in the Denver post that the cops staged
[42:54.320 --> 42:59.520]  his as rioters so they could attack peaceful crowds just like we told everybody i mean you know
[42:59.520 --> 43:03.840]  they just admit it yeah we go out and attack other people so we can blame it on the citizens
[43:03.840 --> 43:11.920]  it is a rogue criminal government now is that saying all cops are bad no but the bosses directed cops
[43:11.920 --> 43:18.880]  and they went out to set up the American people you see to stop free speech and they don't like it
[43:18.880 --> 43:24.800]  that i'll tell it like it is now what did you say to her specifically you said what does this have
[43:24.800 --> 43:30.880]  to do with him yeah i say yeah and i said what does it have to do with him and my qualifications
[43:30.880 --> 43:36.480]  as far as i know i received a letter i passed everything you know i'm good to go so now what's
[43:36.480 --> 43:44.160]  this and she said you will be receiving a uh a statement on any questions you may have
[43:44.800 --> 43:52.000]  and the reasons why and she wouldn't go into detail other than that and uh and i said well i
[43:52.000 --> 43:57.120]  said can i ask you some uh you know anything else and she said anything else that you uh may
[43:57.120 --> 44:02.400]  want to ask i'm sure it'll be included in the package you'll be received notice why we are
[44:02.400 --> 44:08.320]  it's it all right you've just told me i can't work in america because you're violating the law and
[44:08.320 --> 44:14.640]  watching what i view and where i go yeah you know i mean all they did was listen they don't even have
[44:14.640 --> 44:19.600]  to call up and get it their computers already hooked in you've got a major isp who's your isp
[44:20.480 --> 44:26.480]  uh win stream yeah of course so they just they're already hubbed in all the major hubs so they just
[44:26.480 --> 44:32.640]  hubbed in and oh look at him he's visiting info wars dot com well that may be somebody in his
[44:32.640 --> 44:38.720]  house doing that or that may be a son or a daughter or a neighbor um to disqualify him
[44:38.720 --> 44:42.480]  just so we get some tape on them go ahead and implement procedure q nine seven four three four
[44:42.480 --> 44:47.680]  to five and then they go ahead and send their officers there for the setup and then you're a
[44:47.680 --> 44:52.320]  nice little friendly slave so you're there at the door hi how you doing and then and then they say
[44:52.320 --> 44:57.600]  you call this number and then they get you on tape exactly that was the nexus point
[44:59.920 --> 45:06.320]  well alex i will definitely get this information to you and let's let's be in touch because i
[45:06.320 --> 45:11.840]  i i want to take it to the next level because absolutely let's take it these are hardcore

[52:41.760 --> 52:46.160]  hey you know i'm not kidding around i've been there i've seen police
[52:47.280 --> 52:52.480]  punching and hitting people in front of the news cameras to make the demonstrators look bad so
[52:52.480 --> 52:58.800]  they have a pretext to beat the living daylights out of us and take us to prison that's criminal
[53:00.960 --> 53:06.720]  now i know most police aren't part of those units that do that i don't care those orders
[53:06.720 --> 53:13.280]  are coming from on high your organization is criminal from the top down Denver cops that first
[53:13.280 --> 53:21.280]  day there same thing up in Minnesota guys in black would run out of the police lines overturned
[53:21.280 --> 53:26.560]  stuff and run right back the cops through their face masks would be laughing and they just move
[53:26.560 --> 53:32.640]  in and start beating the daylights out of tasering pepper spraying the crowd that arrest hundreds
[53:33.760 --> 53:41.600]  because in america you don't protest scum slave and in america if you listen alex jones
[53:41.600 --> 53:44.960]  you don't get a government job today and the next day you don't get any job
[53:44.960 --> 53:53.280]  because that's what this country's turned into a bunch of cowards who are on power trips who
[53:53.280 --> 54:02.240]  will follow any legal order it's funny we've gotten behind the scenes videos after the cops
[54:02.240 --> 54:06.640]  have done this in miami and they're sitting around laughing about how they set everybody up
[54:07.360 --> 54:14.160]  go watch it it's on youtube it's funny to shut down free speech and to demonize things and to go
[54:14.160 --> 54:19.040]  false flag that's a false flag they go stage a little riot of a terror attack
[54:20.960 --> 54:25.120]  and then they go and they set everybody up it's real funny it's real cute
[54:27.760 --> 54:34.640]  and and and by saying oh well other cops are good they're not all bad and then nothing gets fixed
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.720]  nothing changes i don't think the average cop wants to be part of that the average cop
[54:42.720 --> 54:47.680]  does want a second amendment the first amendment i understand that the average cop's out generating
[54:47.680 --> 54:57.200]  revenue out responding to burglar alarms i understand that i don't have a problem with
[54:57.200 --> 55:06.080]  your authority i have a problem with tyranny i have a big problem with it and i'm not trying to
[55:06.080 --> 55:12.800]  get mad at uh bill and pa the first time caller but but but you could hear the i'm tired of all
[55:12.800 --> 55:16.800]  this talk it's time to go to the next level you need to do this alex
[55:21.760 --> 55:26.320]  i don't know i mean it's not gonna call ron paul up and i say jump and he says how high
[55:26.960 --> 55:28.400]  not gonna call jesse ventura
[55:31.600 --> 55:34.800]  and a lot of it's the organizations and the groups associated with these people
[55:34.800 --> 55:39.200]  people i mean the minute i try to organize anything everybody would like to send in on it
[55:39.200 --> 55:43.680]  and try to take it over because there isn't real leadership out there and then we have a march in
[55:43.680 --> 55:51.840]  washington they've ron paul's done a couple of those 10 000 people show up because the alternative
[55:51.840 --> 55:59.760]  media is big but it's fractured into the national i mean they've had they've had control the border
[55:59.760 --> 56:06.080]  marches with 800 000 people in dc it doesn't go on the news it only goes on the news if they want it
[56:06.080 --> 56:12.960]  to and so see i'm in the catbird seat the crow's nest i'm seeing what's going on and somebody down
[56:12.960 --> 56:18.560]  the deck is telling me oh alex you need to do this look i need to take more time off i need to make
[56:18.560 --> 56:25.040]  films that affect greater change and reach more people i need to do the radio show it is not all
[56:25.040 --> 56:37.840]  up to me and i'm not trying to be negative with the caller it's just um it's just that
[56:39.600 --> 56:44.560]  i don't even take off when i get sick you know i got a chest cold last week still got it haven't
[56:44.560 --> 56:52.160]  stopped working and i should probably be at home in bed but i'm not and that's as much as i can give
[56:52.160 --> 56:57.120]  you and a lot of people get mad at me because they say alex you need to be directed by us you
[56:57.120 --> 57:00.160]  need to you need to do every idea we talk about and do everything we discuss

[59:14.400 --> 59:21.600]  worse than i originally said plus the cult-like the last leader in the wester world worshiped
[59:21.600 --> 59:28.960]  like this by the media and the culture was adolf hitler literally no one i mean this is 50 times
[59:28.960 --> 59:38.160]  the worship of john f kennedy so um we're in a lot of trouble i'll just tell you that right now
[59:39.680 --> 59:44.160]  and yes they're putting in a cashless society grid so they can turn your cards off taker bank

[59:48.800 --> 59:53.360]  they're going to bring it in very slowly and to watch my fellow americans and people worldwide
[59:53.360 --> 59:59.200]  being brought into great bondage is very upsetting and very painful and to have children living in
[59:59.200 --> 1:00:04.400]  this is very painful and to see the public being suckered in like jim jones cult members after
[1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:11.040]  obama who's a puppet being suckered into the new order agenda is very painful very painful

[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:23.120]  are being suckered in again they're cold-blooded crooks from the government it's their personal
[1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:31.360]  cash machine got it stan and maryland you're on the air go ahead stan

[1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:43.520]  because you won't be up as well um first it was loose change final cut and then end game
[1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:50.480]  and about the state the people were listening out there this whole obama thing they talk about it
[1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:54.400]  being something that's going to bring racial reconciliation well it's actually bringing
[1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:59.920]  division i'm black and i can't talk to some people about the issue they won't even listen to what i
[1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:04.640]  have to say about it about the police state surveillance grid it's like i committed blasphemy
[1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:08.160]  like a caller that you had on earlier said i bet they were listening when you were talking about it
[1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:13.760]  with bush but now no they're saying look at the newspaper there's a cartoon with obama with tape
[1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:18.800]  putting the constitution back together it's all fixed yeah and the strange part of this i listened
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:25.680]  to c stan radio uh this was the day after election day after that and they had black folks calling in
[1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:30.880]  you know of course oh it's going to be this great text or et cetera and then you had white folks
[1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:35.120]  calling in oh i'm scared he's going to take our right away so there's actually a division and the
[1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:41.600]  call was we're encouraging this this was on fm 90 90.1 um in my area and the call was like kind of
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:46.480]  egging it on it reminded me of the call they had the Ralph nader when the guy was saying did you
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:51.920]  regret the uncle samba some kind of uh so it's like child psychology that's going playing both
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:56.480]  sides across against each other exactly and it gets the american people fighting with each other
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:02.800]  instead of a fighting against the bankers yeah and and as far as the bailout goes i mean it's
[1:02:02.800 --> 1:02:07.520]  it i don't want to be negative about it but the more people i talk to you it's like deer in the
[1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:12.640]  headlights uh you it's this guy they were gone public but the bailout money going to the uh
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:18.480]  executives the bonuses and you mentioned people and they're like what and i say read the news it's
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:22.880]  there uh so i want to say to you is just don't be discouraged i know sometimes i've heard on the
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:27.280]  ad the past couple of weeks you are getting exasperated you do what you can do if they won't
[1:02:27.280 --> 1:02:33.040]  listen to the dust off your feet move on and i'll say this to your other listeners real quick
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:38.160]  guys out there i don't i don't know but maybe your wives or your kids they might not be on
[1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:43.760]  board with it you know i feel christian pray form uh if not whatever show them the information
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:48.720]  okay don't back down on it uh because i got into this for my own life you know and i have she's
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:52.880]  coming around to it now that show all your films well i'll tell you what i'm really freaked out
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:58.160]  about is that i would love to love our first black president i would love to have loved george bush
[1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:03.920]  but when they work for the same globalist institutions i can't and now when people finally
[1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:09.680]  turn against obama it is going to really hurt black folks's fault uh uh you know feelings
[1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:15.920]  because the media is going to imply it's because they're racist yeah and that's what i'm getting
[1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:21.120]  back but but also for people who are black it's going to be that you're a race so again it's
[1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:26.000]  both ends being played against each other absolutely good to hear from you my friend
[1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:29.200]  dr corsey straight ahead more your phone calls stay with us
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:41.920]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:46.160]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food
[1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:50.640]  and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:55.360]  never have to go to the super dome and beg for female to take care of your family in any emergency
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:04:00.320]  if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for special interest
[1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:04.800]  so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to
[1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:10.960]  print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the american and european banks
[1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:15.440]  the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and
[1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:21.280]  blast the cost of assassins particularly food beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi germany
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:26.400]  super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:32.240]  marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private
[1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:36.480]  banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:41.520]  their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in
[1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:46.160]  america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of
[1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:50.800]  americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever
[1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:55.680]  it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:04:59.440]  important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the government the new
[1:04:59.440 --> 1:05:04.400]  old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:08.640]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:13.600]  know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from e-coli salmonella

[1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:28.160]  obama's in there in the whole agenda the new order is continuing on and i've never seen
[1:06:28.160 --> 1:06:34.240]  any american leader worship like this the last person in the western world i saw being called
[1:06:34.240 --> 1:06:37.040]  the one the one to change the world the leader
[1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:39.520]  but by major publications
[1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:41.720]  uh... was at all hitler
[1:06:41.720 --> 1:06:46.560]  uh... at all hitler uh... was talked about in europe and the u.s. like this
[1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:49.000]  like he was some type of rock star
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:52.680]  uh... a lot of americans don't know that you only heard the bad stuff about hitler
[1:06:52.680 --> 1:06:54.200]  but before the war
[1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:55.160]  in in the
[1:06:55.160 --> 1:06:57.200]  nineteen forty thirty nine
[1:06:57.200 --> 1:06:59.760]  when we went into checkerslough hockey a
[1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:04.640]  and then into the ryan lands to date and land dancing places like that he was the
[1:07:04.640 --> 1:07:05.920]  savior
[1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:09.320]  uh... he was the guy he had all the answers you know he had the olympics in
[1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:10.400]  thirty six
[1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:16.080]  he drew the designs for the olympics the torches the the rings he was the one
[1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:18.160]  anytime you see that historically
[1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:22.680]  that lets you know the system is planning some bad stuff with this person
[1:07:22.680 --> 1:07:25.920]  they're gonna bring in the police state or american union
[1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:30.480]  carbon taxes everything under him and police military fb i all of you
[1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:33.520]  have a choice to make are you with the american people in liberty or with a new
[1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:34.560]  world order
[1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:39.640]  and a lot of you through fear to go along with this and i am
[1:07:39.640 --> 1:07:43.160]  in the end of this when we fall like germany or however it's gonna happen just
[1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:44.720]  remember you were warned
[1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:46.080]  we could have said no to this
[1:07:46.080 --> 1:07:50.400]  dr corcy of course wrote the book that helped defeat carry
[1:07:50.400 --> 1:07:53.600]  and then he uh... was no big fan of the cane he wrote the book abomination i
[1:07:53.600 --> 1:07:55.280]  found to be very accurate
[1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:58.120]  they didn't attack him on that attack them on interviews he'd done or things
[1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:01.120]  each setter for coming on this radio show and
[1:08:01.120 --> 1:08:04.320]  saying you know that we need to look at the collapse of the towers
[1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:06.040]  he said just look at it
[1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:08.080]  uh...
[1:08:08.080 --> 1:08:12.120]  so that became a big international issue this show
[1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:14.840]  and we interviewed him out in denver but not since then
[1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:17.640]  and so of course he's an expert on the n a u
[1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:20.480]  on the carbon tax on all of us in together
[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:23.760]  with the barack obama so i want to get him on today to talk about what's
[1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:26.160]  happened during the campaign what happened in kenya
[1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:29.040]  he's been pretty sick his uh...
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:32.060]  he got real ill in kenya he's still ill right now
[1:08:32.060 --> 1:08:34.760]  i'm not going to spend too much time on that but uh... he's just now able to do
[1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:36.120]  interviews a lot again
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:38.080]  i thought of course you could have you on with us
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:41.040]  i'll thank you alex great to be back with you on
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:44.880]  yeah i've had um... i've had arthritis in my spine and a really
[1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:47.240]  kind of chronic arthritis
[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:51.360]  it just flared up and kenya i could barely walk
[1:08:51.360 --> 1:08:54.520]  but i want to why he did more research i mean i've been
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:58.400]  really struggling for the last month but still researching and
[1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:01.120]  getting the stories out so i'll be
[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:04.760]  hopefully it will get the meds in me and take some rest now with the elections
[1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:05.600]  over
[1:09:05.600 --> 1:09:10.600]  except the stories continue
[1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:15.360]  that only is going to be much rest for a while
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:17.040]  let's talk about
[1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:20.760]  briefly your experience in the campaign the way the media handled it
[1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:23.320]  the way they gave kid gloves for him but then
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:25.640]  would even make stuff i'm not that i'm defending it but make stuff up about
[1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:27.240]  paleon and others
[1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:29.960]  and then let's talk about now where we're going in the future
[1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:32.680]  we expose last week that on his website
[1:09:32.680 --> 1:09:33.720]  last thursday
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:35.000]  change dot gov
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.520]  but he said compulsory national service for old people young people
[1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:39.920]  little kids
[1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:43.920]  and they took that down over the weekend and now big neo
[1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:46.080]  big uh... neo-lib websites
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:49.280]  are saying we're liars that was never on his site so
[1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:52.520]  colt like devotion and uh... and denial
[1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:56.120]  well i think it was certainly what i thought for what i went through
[1:09:56.120 --> 1:09:58.760]  uh... if you criticize obama
[1:09:58.760 --> 1:10:01.320]  you're in the form of
[1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:04.720]  bill severe attack from the obama campaign
[1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:06.800]  out there but i think it's not
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:08.640]  open to the type of
[1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:10.800]  normal criticism the most
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:12.880]  political candidates expect
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:14.620]  they look at sarah paleon
[1:10:14.620 --> 1:10:16.260]  and the attack that they went
[1:10:16.260 --> 1:10:18.640]  all the attack on sarah paleon or
[1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:20.120]  joe the plumber
[1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:22.080]  and you'll be providing a book
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:23.680]  they were forty page
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:25.640]  unfit for publication
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:27.940]  you'll say my book was full of lies
[1:10:27.940 --> 1:10:30.200]  and accurate he's actually the work
[1:10:30.200 --> 1:10:31.720]  very very minor
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:32.900]  issues
[1:10:32.900 --> 1:10:36.040]  you'll easily correct in the second printing in my book and then they use
[1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:38.100]  data mining with the government
[1:10:38.100 --> 1:10:41.120]  to pull up everything on job the plumber and then twist that but that's okay
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:42.680]  that's loving and sweet
[1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:47.560]  and they also you know they didn't i've i wrote a sixty page rebuttal
[1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:49.040]  rejoinder
[1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:51.100]  to all the yellows up to
[1:10:51.100 --> 1:10:52.400]  for publication
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:54.520]  but probably some world that daily
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:56.360]  and of course the obama
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:10:58.560]  campaign totally ignored
[1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:03.560]  by responses so it's entirely one-way attack
[1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:05.680]  and the obama campaign
[1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:07.720]  seems to be totally
[1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:09.880]  you know totally um...
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:12.000]  unable to take criticism
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.360]  it's going to be a good way if they continue
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:16.480]  this way it's going to be worse than
[1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:18.820]  nixon's enemies or
[1:11:18.820 --> 1:11:21.340]  you know the uh... it will be of a campaign
[1:11:21.340 --> 1:11:23.320]  or president the two
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:25.960]  uh... engage in what's normal
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:27.560]  uh... give and take
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:30.880]  of policy criticism well that's like rama manual
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:33.900]  when he was uh... clinton's head guy in ninety six
[1:11:33.900 --> 1:11:34.840]  screaming
[1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:38.420]  died died as he said the name stabbing the table
[1:11:38.420 --> 1:11:41.680]  at a uh... dinner they were having foaming at the mouth
[1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:44.680]  uh... they're now saying chucky schumer and all of her saying yes they're
[1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:47.800]  coming up to talk radio everybody's free speech
[1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:51.200]  and all these mainline liberals who are against george bush and his police
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:51.840]  state
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:53.480]  they're suddenly saying yes
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:54.200]  yes
[1:11:54.200 --> 1:11:58.900]  ban all the shows ban them but get rid of free speech it's good
[1:11:58.900 --> 1:12:02.340]  well i think we're going to have certainly a first around here
[1:12:02.340 --> 1:12:04.880]  where free speech will have to be defended
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:08.400]  uh... because if it's a fair doctor and gets reinstituted
[1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:11.520]  and there's an attempt made which i think there will be
[1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:13.800]  to shut down talk radio
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:16.480]  all you have to do the american people again
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:19.480]  are denied an opportunity to get the truth
[1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:22.840]  certainly giving down we've got the washington post
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:25.320]  openly saying that they were biased
[1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:26.960]  in favor of obama
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:29.180]  that was obvious certainly the
[1:12:29.180 --> 1:12:30.640]  on new york times
[1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:32.920]  a bc nbc
[1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:35.240]  i msnbc they were all
[1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:37.320]  bias in favor of obama
[1:12:37.320 --> 1:12:38.920]  it was very hard
[1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:40.760]  for anybody for any of us
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:44.000]  to get research out there that was accurate
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:45.600]  i was well-defined and
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:48.120]  and deserved comment criticism
[1:12:48.120 --> 1:12:50.240]  certainly now we're gonna find
[1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:53.200]  that you know a lot of stories we developed at the time
[1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:54.400]  were true
[1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:57.320]  uh... reverend right i'm sure we'll write another book
[1:12:57.320 --> 1:12:59.440]  you've got resco in prison
[1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:01.080]  resco i'm sure to
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:02.920]  save himself he's already
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:05.720]  and turning states evidence against the governor
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:07.360]  i'm sure he'll also
[1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:10.200]  turn states evidence against obama
[1:13:10.200 --> 1:13:12.000]  it's only beginning
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:13.480]  and obama is not
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:15.120]  able to handle
[1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:17.360]  the kind of criticism that most
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:19.000]  president expected
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:22.040]  part of the job
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:26.040]  well we saw that with clinton that that that they really had an enemy's list of
[1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:29.100]  and and and really would stick the irish on people
[1:13:29.100 --> 1:13:32.120]  i mean i don't people personally were authors who would mildly criticize
[1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:33.760]  them at the government come after him
[1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:37.480]  and and we've seen that same inner group of the clinton east is
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:41.100]  come in a little but let's talk about obama's policy because
[1:13:41.100 --> 1:13:44.620]  you know you're an economic uh... you know you've got a degree in that
[1:13:44.620 --> 1:13:46.920]  and uh... you know you've worked with some big firms
[1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:48.840]  obama was the big cheerleader
[1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:50.340]  when mccain said
[1:13:50.340 --> 1:13:52.420]  hey maybe we should look at this bailout
[1:13:52.420 --> 1:13:54.340]  he came out so how dare you mccain
[1:13:54.340 --> 1:13:56.840]  we've got to give him unlimited power and in the banks
[1:13:56.840 --> 1:14:01.160]  kept the money and said they're gonna use it for bonuses and to acquire
[1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:03.720]  uh... healthy institutions
[1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:07.960]  i mean that's not even in the new york times we've got obama for an in a u
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:10.960]  we've got him now saying he's for more trade deals
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:14.240]  uh... we've got him openly saying youth brigades and
[1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:16.800]  million man stasi forces
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:19.800]  i mean you can't make this type of stuff up
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:20.640]  and then there's
[1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:24.160]  literally hundreds of editorial cartoons out the last week showing him
[1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:27.960]  putting the constitution back together taping it gluing it back together
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:31.240]  fix taking it back from george bush that he's going to give us all our
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:32.400]  liberties back
[1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:35.120]  and meanwhile he's actually saying take more
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:37.680]  well what i'm saying here and if you take a look
[1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:40.400]  don't i'm writing now this red alert
[1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:45.200]  go to if you go to red alert dot w m that be for world net daily
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:48.040]  red alert dot w n d dot com
[1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:52.040]  every week i've got a economics newsletter now that i'm publishing
[1:14:52.040 --> 1:14:55.880]  and the current one you'll see also the lead story of world net daily front
[1:14:55.880 --> 1:14:57.040]  page
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:00.160]  i'm saying that the stock market is headed now
[1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:01.880]  to the next blow
[1:15:01.880 --> 1:15:04.200]  which is six thousand
[1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:05.600]  mean right now
[1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:08.520]  we're trading in stock market as we're talking
[1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:11.400]  stock market down about seventy seven point
[1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:12.840]  and it's trading about
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:15.440]  all eighty eight eighty six
[1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:17.720]  uh... on the day of the election
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:21.160]  stock market was you know over ninety five hundred
[1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:23.680]  there was an enthusiasm at the time that
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:26.200]  became with might be winning
[1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:28.360]  and stock market was doing well
[1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:32.080]  stock markets you know died about a thousand points
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:33.880]  and so bomb has been elected
[1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:36.480]  and i'm saying that people should listen to this
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:39.040]  very seriously i'm saying that
[1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:41.640]  you'll build the next blow on the stock market
[1:15:41.640 --> 1:15:43.560]  is six thousand
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:44.800]  which means you know
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:47.040]  we were standing here to lose
[1:15:47.040 --> 1:15:48.760]  twenty eight hundred points
[1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:50.200]  on the stock market
[1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:52.160]  it's a huge amount of money
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:54.800]  out of the economy five trillion
[1:15:54.800 --> 1:15:56.680]  out of four one case
[1:15:56.680 --> 1:15:57.880]  other people
[1:15:57.880 --> 1:16:00.080]  ability to really earn a living
[1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:02.080]  i mean if the stock market it
[1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:04.760]  six thousand which i'm saying it will
[1:16:04.760 --> 1:16:06.840]  it's going to be an economic crisis
[1:16:06.840 --> 1:16:08.200]  there will be equivalent
[1:16:08.200 --> 1:16:09.680]  to starting to
[1:16:09.680 --> 1:16:13.000]  and the great depression well dr corcy that's what's my point
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.160]  you've got all these kool-aid drinkers
[1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:17.960]  who literally are i mean they're on tv
[1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:18.960]  saying
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:21.640]  the world is changed i don't have to work anymore
[1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:25.480]  i'll never have problems again i mean that they actually believe this guys the
[1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:26.520]  messiah
[1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:30.320]  and even if he was a good guy he couldn't change or fix any of this
[1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:31.800]  what are they going to do
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:34.440]  as all the offers is giant million man
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:36.240]  domestic spy forces
[1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:39.040]  and uh... compulsory drafts for our children
[1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:40.920]  well i think first of all the
[1:16:40.920 --> 1:16:41.920]  the key
[1:16:41.920 --> 1:16:44.200]  issue with any new president
[1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:47.840]  with any president all of them to be judged on results
[1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:50.280]  so obama can say whatever he wants
[1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:51.600]  people can now
[1:16:51.600 --> 1:16:54.000]  cheerlead they can say these are
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:56.400]  brilliant moves these are you know
[1:16:56.400 --> 1:17:00.320]  but they love what obama does they can fail wonderful it is
[1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:02.560]  but it's going to get judged on results
[1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:05.280]  and stock market which today is now down
[1:17:05.280 --> 1:17:07.200]  seventy nine points
[1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:09.480]  but the stock market heads towards a
[1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:12.200]  another triple digit loss
[1:17:12.200 --> 1:17:13.480]  will have had
[1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:16.520]  this will have been the third triple digit loss
[1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:18.760]  since obama was elected
[1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:20.360]  you know but he's now president
[1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:21.800]  elect
[1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:23.160]  since last
[1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:26.880]  who's day all the stock market has done has had itself
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:28.480]  that's reality
[1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:30.280]  and cheerlead all we want
[1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:34.600]  but the reality is what is going to be judged on
[1:17:34.600 --> 1:17:37.680]  under course he stayed there quick break when i come back and get it any fast

[1:22:44.920 --> 1:22:47.720]  this is that i mean this is getting worse than i even thought it originally
[1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:49.080]  would be
[1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:51.800]  i think it's going to continue to get worse uh...
[1:22:51.800 --> 1:22:52.960]  look at it
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:56.280]  well i think you know i want to get it was there for a week
[1:22:56.280 --> 1:23:00.680]  i was researching when i got i got called over saying that
[1:23:00.680 --> 1:23:04.880]  my chapter four in the obama nation is all about how old
[1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:07.600]  uh... obama has supported this radical
[1:23:07.600 --> 1:23:10.720]  politician odinga rile odinga
[1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:13.080]  it was a communist basically
[1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:17.500]  extreme socialist or a communist his father was not right communist
[1:23:17.500 --> 1:23:20.160]  and i think i signed an agreement to expand
[1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:22.720]  sharia law is a lot like a lot of the
[1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:25.200]  muslims voted for him in kenya
[1:23:25.200 --> 1:23:28.560]  ten is about eighty five percent christian right now
[1:23:28.560 --> 1:23:32.600]  and also when odinga lost the election in december
[1:23:32.600 --> 1:23:34.840]  we're just talking about seven twenty seven
[1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:36.280]  last year just
[1:23:36.280 --> 1:23:38.120]  a few months ago
[1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:39.000]  odinga
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:42.440]  asked for a little tribesmen to go out of protest
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:44.140]  they protested they killed
[1:23:44.140 --> 1:23:46.960]  a thousand of the kakuyu tribe
[1:23:46.960 --> 1:23:49.960]  they destroyed about eight hundred churches not a single
[1:23:49.960 --> 1:23:51.080]  mosque
[1:23:51.080 --> 1:23:54.760]  you know this little town elder at and it turned out that senator obama's office
[1:23:54.760 --> 1:23:56.640]  and advised them to basically do that
[1:23:56.640 --> 1:23:59.280]  well in fact i came back with the document
[1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:00.920]  which was the plan
[1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:02.780]  for odinga campaign
[1:24:02.780 --> 1:24:04.000]  and the plan
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:06.480]  call and when i talked with top
[1:24:06.480 --> 1:24:10.120]  officials of odinga's campaign would defected
[1:24:10.120 --> 1:24:11.660]  because they were appalled
[1:24:11.660 --> 1:24:14.040]  by the violent after the election
[1:24:14.040 --> 1:24:17.840]  and by the agreement for being assigned with radical islam
[1:24:17.840 --> 1:24:20.600]  so this is accurate document it called for the
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:22.440]  if odinga lost
[1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:23.780]  the general election
[1:24:23.780 --> 1:24:26.380]  he was going to use a round of tribal
[1:24:26.380 --> 1:24:28.600]  violence to gain power
[1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:30.240]  and you had obama
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:33.120]  working with odinga on the cell phone
[1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:34.920]  three entirely
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:37.540]  through the old primary campaign
[1:24:37.540 --> 1:24:39.240]  and new hampshire
[1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:42.400]  to advise odinga's to how to use
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:43.680]  all of this
[1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:48.480]  power all of this tribal violence and that's exactly what obama saying now on
[1:24:48.480 --> 1:24:49.920]  his own website
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:50.880]  they're saying
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:56.120]  youth brigades old folks uh... compulsory military service
[1:24:56.120 --> 1:24:59.480]  and we need a campaign that'll odinga ran
[1:24:59.480 --> 1:25:00.720]  with identical
[1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:03.520]  tool bombers odinga ran a campaign
[1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:05.760]  on hope and change
[1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:07.840]  the themes were identical
[1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:11.800]  uh... you know i thought i brought back the documentary evidence is why i was
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:13.640]  detained in kenya
[1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:15.720]  i would have to go there for a week
[1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:17.880]  the meeting with the government the meeting with
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:19.580]  top party officials
[1:25:19.580 --> 1:25:22.760]  i decided that they were going to leave it would hold a press conference
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:25.320]  and that press conference i would reveal
[1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:27.600]  though the findings including
[1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:31.640]  that obama i brought odinga to the united states three times
[1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:33.600]  and raised a million dollars
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:35.960]  for odinga in the united states
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:38.760]  to run for prime minister in kenya
[1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:41.120]  also more market offy
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:43.940]  and raised a million dollars for obama
[1:25:43.940 --> 1:25:45.960]  i'm sorry for odinga
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:49.740]  to run for you know prime minister for president then
[1:25:49.740 --> 1:25:50.840]  in kenya
[1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:52.200]  so you had obama
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:54.480]  and cut off the working
[1:25:54.480 --> 1:25:56.600]  and then had with odinga
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:25:58.560]  to expand the islam
[1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:00.160]  in kenya
[1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:02.980]  but that's tremendously important story
[1:26:02.980 --> 1:26:06.440]  it was not told of the american press and you can't make this up that the whole
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:09.520]  families basically communists you surrounded by communists
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:12.280]  and we raise it and they say so what if everybody's communist
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:14.960]  and so what if you want to national compulsory service
[1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:16.400]  that's freedom
[1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:19.340]  and then meanwhile uh... what are his
[1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:21.240]  zombie followers going to do
[1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:22.280]  when
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:25.040]  the economy keeps falling apart when they don't get the change or are they
[1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:26.040]  going to blame
[1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:29.440]  people that don't support him and and that if we would have just gotten behind
[1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:31.800]  their savior that everything would have been alright
[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:36.160]  well certainly they'll do that but they'll also be obama people will blame
[1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:38.200]  the current recession on bush
[1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:40.320]  this will be bush's recession
[1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:45.160]  no matter what you prefer the next two years no matter what happened economically you can bet
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:47.320]  that obama will blame it on bush
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:50.440]  obama tends to continue to run against bush
[1:26:50.440 --> 1:26:52.520]  throughout his first term hoping
[1:26:52.520 --> 1:26:54.120]  for a second term
[1:26:54.120 --> 1:26:56.760]  what i'm saying is that the supporters
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:26:59.200]  the obama supporters in kenya
[1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:02.520]  people obama's work with the like of odinga
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:06.000]  or do you know odinga the father without right communist
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.200]  he worked with obama's father
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:10.880]  when obama's father was a failed economist
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:12.640]  in the kenya regime
[1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:14.200]  odinga himself
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:15.640]  was trained
[1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:17.120]  in eastern germany
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:18.920]  and named his first son
[1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:20.520]  fidel kastro
[1:27:20.520 --> 1:27:22.480]  so it can show you both obama's
[1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:23.600]  willingness to work with him
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:24.800]  no it's clear i mean i mean
[1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:26.360]  socialist obama is a
[1:27:26.360 --> 1:27:28.640]  hold on doctor we gotta break longsamer coming up
[1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:31.120]  he comes from hardcore political communist
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:33.520]  that's why the big banks love him because they want to destroy the middle
[1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:34.720]  class and free market
[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:36.200]  have a world government run by them

[1:31:59.520 --> 1:32:03.240]  the people he's bringing in you know written the best-selling book about the
[1:32:03.240 --> 1:32:06.880]  north american union about how they would implode the u.s. currency try to
[1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:12.760]  bring in a new global basket of currencies exactly that is now happening
[1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:16.520]  uh... he helps spearhead the banker takeover when congress wouldn't pass it
[1:32:16.520 --> 1:32:20.680]  obama went on tv and said you've got to do this and had his zombies
[1:32:20.680 --> 1:32:23.120]  uh... call congress and then they ran it through
[1:32:23.120 --> 1:32:24.560]  so break down
[1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:27.960]  doctor coursey from studying these people where you see them going in the
[1:32:27.960 --> 1:32:28.720]  future
[1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:32.360]  well everything i wrote about in the in the late great u.s.a. is happening in
[1:32:32.360 --> 1:32:36.960]  fact i'm interested to ask me to do a paperback version of a great u.s.a.
[1:32:36.960 --> 1:32:39.560]  i'm right now doing the new epilogue
[1:32:39.560 --> 1:32:43.800]  if you saw it today right now writers is running an article
[1:32:43.800 --> 1:32:48.480]  where the uh... that that there's going to be a speech given next week
[1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:52.400]  where britain's prime minister gordon brown
[1:32:52.400 --> 1:32:56.080]  keynote speech he's going to give to an international conference saying
[1:32:56.080 --> 1:32:59.080]  that we need to have a global society
[1:32:59.080 --> 1:32:59.960]  that so that'll
[1:32:59.960 --> 1:33:03.480]  britain is out of the age of pain that the global age
[1:33:03.480 --> 1:33:05.200]  they're using the crisis just
[1:33:05.200 --> 1:33:07.400]  exactly like i said would happen
[1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:11.240]  well i wrote like a great u.s.a i predicted we would have a dollar crisis
[1:33:11.240 --> 1:33:12.520]  we have it
[1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:15.040]  now we've got both france and germany
[1:33:15.040 --> 1:33:17.400]  out there saying we need to look to a
[1:33:17.400 --> 1:33:19.360]  global economy
[1:33:19.360 --> 1:33:23.240]  very few people thought i reported in my red alert newsletter
[1:33:23.240 --> 1:33:25.760]  even the international monetary fund
[1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:27.180]  had given away like
[1:33:27.180 --> 1:33:29.120]  half a trillion dollars
[1:33:29.120 --> 1:33:31.600]  to emerging countries who can't
[1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:33.280]  beat their death
[1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:38.880]  one company's given away the i m f will again on the emerging economies
[1:33:38.880 --> 1:33:42.160]  we're basically running a situation where the government
[1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:45.080]  are nationalizing the banks around the world
[1:33:45.080 --> 1:33:47.760]  at the next step after they nationalize the bank
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:50.160]  is on nationalize the currency
[1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:52.120]  these are the best the progression
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:53.360]  that we're in
[1:33:53.360 --> 1:33:54.640]  and the crisis
[1:33:54.640 --> 1:33:56.840]  this whole subprime crisis
[1:33:56.840 --> 1:33:58.800]  which if you recall what i wrote
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:02.200]  play great u.s.a i was predicting the subprime
[1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:04.320]  crisis and i was predicting
[1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:06.880]  that we would see the same kind of unemployment
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:09.280]  that we're seeing right now in pennsylvania
[1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:11.000]  ohio in michigan
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:14.560]  where the jobs would be continuously going overseas
[1:34:14.560 --> 1:34:17.000]  also this talk about how a
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:19.480]  global economy would
[1:34:19.480 --> 1:34:21.840]  you know the u.s. economy is not that
[1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:23.960]  all we've done is throw the entire
[1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:26.400]  global economy into a global
[1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:28.280]  recession is our first
[1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:29.840]  global recession
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:32.560]  caused by this new world order thinking
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:35.040]  and it will be used to create a new
[1:34:35.040 --> 1:34:36.760]  world currency
[1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:38.480]  on the push toward the
[1:34:38.480 --> 1:34:41.360]  north american union will never be stronger
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:46.360]  that it will be under up on your obama administration
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:48.640]  now
[1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:50.360]  to be specific
[1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:52.800]  i have the london telegraph today
[1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:54.800]  right with the headline
[1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:57.480]  gordon brown calls for new world order
[1:34:57.480 --> 1:35:00.360]  yet to beat recession i mean this is so
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:03.680]  over-the-top asinine the hoodspot
[1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:07.680]  which is out there openly their plate now well they are the ones that
[1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:09.000]  engineered
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:12.600]  this banking consolidation they've taken the over trillion bucks
[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:15.240]  that's been pumped into their gullets their craws
[1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:19.200]  he already happened once the banks are nationalized one
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:22.720]  united states and great britain nationalized the bank
[1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:27.240]  we've already moved into a government controlled economy
[1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:30.600]  the next step is to move into a government controlled
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:31.740]  regional
[1:35:31.740 --> 1:35:33.800]  currency like the america
[1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:35.960]  if they don't just bypass the barrel
[1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:37.720]  and go directly to a
[1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:40.480]  north american european currency
[1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:42.240]  which now they could do
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:43.760]  it's on the agenda
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:46.360]  at gordon brown by giving the speech
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:49.360]  you know what i do the epilogue to the lake great u s a
[1:35:49.360 --> 1:35:50.760]  i'm going to be saying
[1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:53.880]  that we slow the agenda down
[1:35:53.880 --> 1:35:55.400]  publicizing it
[1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:58.400]  the work you did alex the work i did the work others
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:00.520]  to get out there and publicize it
[1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:03.960]  but given the magnitude of this worldwide depression that's been
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:05.800]  intentionally caused
[1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:06.520]  i think
[1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:08.480]  it's all overwhelmed
[1:36:08.480 --> 1:36:10.600]  so the people will very quickly
[1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:12.080]  instead of saying look
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:15.400]  we're in the verge of losing our homes losing our jobs
[1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:18.880]  to the world like great u s a because enough
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:23.040]  people will be willing to abandon economic sovereignty
[1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:24.720]  and economic control
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:26.400]  into a new world order
[1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:28.520]  that will have a new world currency
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:30.320]  which is exactly where
[1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:31.240]  the bank
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:33.600]  and the government's pushing for these regional
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:37.000]  governmental structure and by the way you weren't flying blind
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.920]  the architects of it like robert pastor
[1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:42.400]  at the cfr said
[1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:45.800]  they would use terrorism and economic crises
[1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:49.040]  to get this in place in their openly saying
[1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:51.360]  a basket of world currencies
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:55.600]  regulated through an international private banking agreement and like you
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:36:57.160]  said they're telling the public
[1:36:57.160 --> 1:36:58.960]  this is your only hope
[1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:03.400]  when going down this path is what will destroy the economy and i said this
[1:37:03.400 --> 1:37:04.280]  again
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:08.560]  when back to july of two thousand seven when i wrote the lake rate u s a
[1:37:08.560 --> 1:37:12.720]  you're going to start seeing the next set of things the council for relations
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:16.280]  and steel which is already he's already written one article
[1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:20.080]  saying that you know regional currencies are a thing of the past
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:22.160]  the next push will be for
[1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:25.400]  you know getting a world currency not just
[1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:27.520]  if forget national currencies
[1:37:27.520 --> 1:37:29.080]  they're already beyond that
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:31.120]  i just got back from africa
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:33.680]  the main portion africa right now is for
[1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:35.720]  an african currency
[1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:37.360]  the african union
[1:37:37.360 --> 1:37:39.600]  is the main push right now
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:40.760]  in africa
[1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:43.200]  just the same as it's going to be in asia
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:45.160]  it's the same as it's going to be in europe
[1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:48.920]  and it's going to be in north america and that destroys their local sovereignty
[1:37:48.920 --> 1:37:53.120]  and brings them under regional governments precisely and the same idea is
[1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:54.080]  that what
[1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:57.840]  the other day the economy is under such bad condition
[1:37:57.840 --> 1:38:00.040]  they'll blame it on george bush
[1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:02.120]  when you know if there is not a problem
[1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:05.480]  doesn't have a single idea that he's expressed so far
[1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:08.280]  except to give more money away i mean
[1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:10.280]  you know it's almost ridiculous
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:12.200]  what about the simply
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:15.360]  by everybody their home then give them to them
[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:19.160]  buy our mortgages and give them to us but the problem is
[1:38:19.160 --> 1:38:21.200]  if they did that the currency
[1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:22.320]  would be you know
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:25.760]  more it'd be worse than what actually mccain said
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:29.720]  by off the bad part of the mortgages and and let the people then have that
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:31.240]  reduction
[1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:34.800]  instead of just letting the banks ride it off and keep the profit well probably
[1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:38.440]  what they don't want to say no all of it goes to the bankers
[1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:41.000]  but he's really a cold hard
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:46.400]  seat what they're going to do is they're going to bail the bankers out of obama will participate
[1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:49.400]  it's been bailing the bankers out what they'll do is they'll
[1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:50.920]  consolidate
[1:38:50.920 --> 1:38:53.960]  but without about a dozen world banks
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:56.040]  consolidate them they'll go to
[1:38:56.040 --> 1:38:57.720]  probably initially
[1:38:57.720 --> 1:39:01.040]  four or five regional world currencies
[1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:02.440]  all of the way
[1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:03.680]  to having the
[1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:04.320]  you know
[1:39:04.320 --> 1:39:06.400]  bank of international settlement
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:08.960]  the international monetary fund
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:13.280]  and the u and b the major agencies in control economically
[1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:15.840]  so the central bank to the individual countries
[1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:17.880]  will be minor details
[1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:20.520]  it basically they're going to say that the paulson
[1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:22.600]  bernicke plan failed
[1:39:22.600 --> 1:39:25.280]  and what that's very now is to move up to
[1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:28.880]  the next level of regional and international control
[1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:31.000]  i'm predicting that's going to be the next
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:34.560]  immediate pressure you're going to start to see what they said they're doing that
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:37.720]  this and by the time i you know that by the time
[1:39:37.720 --> 1:39:41.280]  like a u.s.a. is published out as a as a reprint
[1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:42.600]  as a paperback
[1:39:42.600 --> 1:39:44.640]  it's going to be well along the way
[1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:47.600]  i'm going to do is also ask me to do a reprint
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:49.800]  of the uh... abomination
[1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:53.560]  because again most of the questions i asked for the abomination
[1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:56.120]  have never been dressed up just at all
[1:39:56.120 --> 1:39:59.440]  you know why did they release the original birth certificate
[1:39:59.440 --> 1:40:03.320]  well in fact i've been asked today we had discussions all weekend with joseph
[1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:05.200]  ferron world that daily
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:08.920]  with that daily going right back on to the theme of the birth certificate
[1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:12.120]  i'd say as soon as i get a little bit of rest here maybe a week
[1:40:12.120 --> 1:40:14.080]  uh... we're going to be designing
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:17.680]  a strategy to go after these birth certificate issues
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:20.960]  i've got a variety of theories i intend to
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:26.400]  pursue very directly is to who obama really is what the parentage really is
[1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:29.280]  what the birth certificate to really go look like
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:31.880]  i mean if you've already got being put into place
[1:40:31.880 --> 1:40:34.220]  basic care of the world government
[1:40:34.220 --> 1:40:36.760]  with the american people being totally
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:40.320]  you know misled and fooled as to what's happening
[1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:44.400]  because the structure of everything i argued that that's not a paper crisis
[1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:46.880]  necessity for the fall of the dollar
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:49.680]  uh... when i wrote the lake great u s a
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:52.200]  you know back even when i was writing
[1:40:52.200 --> 1:40:54.440]  black gold stranglehold which was
[1:40:54.440 --> 1:40:57.560]  a year before that in nineteen two thousand five
[1:40:57.560 --> 1:41:00.960]  and i said then the oil would go to a hundred dollars a barrel
[1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:02.800]  i was being ridiculed
[1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:04.760]  people said it would never happen
[1:41:04.760 --> 1:41:09.040]  and now that we've got oil down to about sixty five dollars a barrel
[1:41:09.040 --> 1:41:10.880]  everything isn't this great
[1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:13.480]  look we've solved the problem
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:15.520]  that's just been a relaxation
[1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:19.220]  or else going to be back up to a hundred forty five dollars a barrel
[1:41:19.220 --> 1:41:20.600]  at the economy
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:22.480]  the dow Jones has down
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:25.480]  and six thousand which is where i'm predicting
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:28.880]  i'm saying oil will look again you'll see gold
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:32.640]  head back over to a thousand dollars about uh... all these movements are
[1:41:32.640 --> 1:41:35.800]  already in progress
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:38.440]  and for those that don't know i mean you've got a degree in this from harvard
[1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:39.040]  so
[1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:40.880]  well also i've been predicting
[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:42.820]  over twenty five years i worked
[1:41:42.820 --> 1:41:46.040]  in financial services i work with banks around the world
[1:41:46.040 --> 1:41:49.160]  part of my job was always to do predictions for world that
[1:41:49.160 --> 1:41:51.120]  daily ask me to start doing
[1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:53.760]  at the end of last year was to prepare this
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:56.040]  red alert dot w m d
[1:41:56.040 --> 1:41:57.980]  dot com newsletter
[1:41:57.980 --> 1:42:01.720]  i've got the newsletter now fully prepared designed
[1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:04.200]  i kept it going even through the election
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:07.840]  if you take a look at world that they will be one of the major articles
[1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:09.440]  i posted on there that
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:12.960]  the next bottom number we're headed to the stock market
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:14.600]  it's six thousand and
[1:42:14.600 --> 1:42:17.720]  and out for a thousand people listening today
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:19.120]  and i'm telling people
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:20.760]  failure stocks
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:22.240]  people usually told
[1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:24.760]  hold on the market's going to come back
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:27.240]  don't worry your 401k will
[1:42:27.240 --> 1:42:29.000]  be back if you just hold on
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:31.120]  i'm saying that's nonsense
[1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:33.440]  if you've got one of the stock market today
[1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:35.040]  felon get left
[1:42:35.040 --> 1:42:37.540]  get out of the stock market which you've got left
[1:42:37.540 --> 1:42:41.240]  because it isn't coming back all right if it does come back it's not coming
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:44.520]  back quick doc i want to take some calls before you leave us but
[1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:46.640]  other predictions for the future
[1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:47.680]  uh...
[1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:49.540]  but before you do that
[1:42:49.540 --> 1:42:53.920]  i want you to address the the the million man domestic spy force
[1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:56.200]  as big as the armed forces
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:43:00.800]  uh... the youth brigades and the fact that
[1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:04.600]  obama lies so much i mean they were moved that off their website
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:07.320]  and they're now saying it was never there despite the fact we have the
[1:43:07.320 --> 1:43:08.520]  screenshots
[1:43:08.520 --> 1:43:12.440]  i mean i mean this did this guy is already putting bill clinton shame
[1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:16.800]  online is nothing for obama lying that you know obama said they do
[1:43:16.800 --> 1:43:19.600]  air because they lived in their neighborhood and their kids went to
[1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:20.720]  school
[1:43:20.720 --> 1:43:24.640]  unlike dennis miller once pointed out to me obama's kids are two little girls
[1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:26.800]  and air kids are all grown up in
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:31.400]  but they are kids were very slowly never went to school single-day together
[1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:35.880]  but they are together because a year's at obama agree politically on a radical
[1:43:35.880 --> 1:43:37.680]  leftist agenda
[1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:40.240]  are you going to be the same thing happened with this
[1:43:40.240 --> 1:43:43.800]  national whatever kind of court going to be it's going to be like
[1:43:43.800 --> 1:43:46.080]  a brown shirt effort
[1:43:46.080 --> 1:43:48.040]  to equip the youth
[1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:49.680]  and have them be a
[1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:51.640]  dot control brigade
[1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:55.640]  uh... we're extremely concerned about the world that daily we also
[1:43:55.640 --> 1:43:57.920]  have one of the first following what this
[1:43:57.920 --> 1:44:00.400]  brown shirt brigade means
[1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:04.960]  and expect lying to be the norm for obama obama is very very hard
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:06.760]  depend on the fact
[1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:10.240]  but it's going to be very difficult i i don't care my right is going to write a
[1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:11.460]  new book
[1:44:11.460 --> 1:44:14.480]  uh... you're going to see rezzco rezzco right now
[1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:17.120]  is already spilling the beans on the governor
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:20.160]  our federal prisons not very much fun to be and
[1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:22.720]  i suspect rezzco will try to
[1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:26.800]  start talking about obama's soon they'll look for a pardon
[1:44:26.800 --> 1:44:29.360]  rezzco's only real chance to get out
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:31.960]  obama's going to be pressured to give a pardon
[1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:35.520]  what do you expect obama to do when he first gets in i mean he's
[1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:39.400]  i don't want to be a serious there's going to be a series of executive orders
[1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:41.840]  obama's not even bothered with congress
[1:44:41.840 --> 1:44:43.920]  he's going to take five or six of his
[1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:45.400]  top agendas
[1:44:45.400 --> 1:44:49.400]  whether they be abortion or they be global warming or they
[1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:53.080]  be stem cells or whatever and he's just going to issue
[1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:57.880]  uh... direct executive order saying this is about a fact
[1:44:57.880 --> 1:44:59.600]  and as obama
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:02.560]  gets into power as he begins to
[1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:03.920]  settle in
[1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:07.160]  i think you're going to see the economics all the idea that
[1:45:07.160 --> 1:45:10.040]  ninety five percent of the people who get tax cuts
[1:45:10.040 --> 1:45:11.920]  although that's lies
[1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:15.240]  uh... there's going to be people out there who were expecting that obama
[1:45:15.240 --> 1:45:19.400]  is going to pay their rent and pay their mortgages forget that
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:21.920]  i think obama is going to do very very little
[1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:23.920]  for the poor of the country
[1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:27.000]  he hasn't even done very much for the poor of his own family
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:28.840]  i'll look you can't really show
[1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:31.120]  you know short new people are showing up who
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:33.040]  you know obama's family have
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:35.880]  suffered poverty he's done nothing for them
[1:45:35.880 --> 1:45:37.760]  obama's out for obama
[1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:40.160]  and i think you'll see a series of lies
[1:45:40.160 --> 1:45:43.360]  the next thing also i expect is i expect there to be some
[1:45:43.360 --> 1:45:45.160]  major major test
[1:45:45.160 --> 1:45:46.800]  uh... in the middle east
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:48.520]  i expect there to be major
[1:45:48.520 --> 1:45:52.600]  revival of terrorism well we we keep hearing that i mean i mean doc
[1:45:52.600 --> 1:45:56.360]  the only is going to be the next major station for terrorist
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:45:59.960]  i think tamale is easier to get to the tent in afghan
[1:45:59.960 --> 1:46:02.480]  and tamale is going to be the next major base
[1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:04.360]  with a terrorist look to organize
[1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:06.800]  the training camps
[1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:10.240]  well i mean it's clear that they're preparing a crisis colin powell is
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:12.000]  saying the twenty first or
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.280]  twenty second and then
[1:46:14.280 --> 1:46:15.440]  obama can go
[1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:17.360]  blow up some training camps
[1:46:17.360 --> 1:46:19.040]  that may not even exist
[1:46:19.040 --> 1:46:20.680]  then flex his muscles
[1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:23.240]  and get hawks behind him
[1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:27.160]  all the issues of our violence all the issues of you know
[1:46:27.160 --> 1:46:28.720]  being political
[1:46:28.720 --> 1:46:32.640]  our terrorism are going to be issues used by the obama campaign of the now the
[1:46:32.640 --> 1:46:34.200]  obama presidency
[1:46:34.200 --> 1:46:35.680]  to gain power
[1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:39.400]  i think the obama president the gaining power is going to make
[1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:43.960]  the bush administration steps the bush administration took with these various
[1:46:43.960 --> 1:46:45.840]  you know presidential orders
[1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:49.000]  grabbing pop grabbing power the case of emergency
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:51.400]  they're there for obama to use
[1:46:51.400 --> 1:46:54.720]  i think you can see that's what i was going to say next up the media keeps
[1:46:54.720 --> 1:46:55.760]  implying
[1:46:55.760 --> 1:46:57.640]  he's going to restore the bill of rights
[1:46:57.640 --> 1:47:00.480]  but the obama campaign is actually accelerating
[1:47:00.480 --> 1:47:04.120]  all the powers that bush recruit i think you can see the patriot act number
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:06.000]  two being introduced
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:09.040]  i think you can see very much more radical control
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:10.400]  although be an effort
[1:47:10.400 --> 1:47:13.240]  to control by reinstituting
[1:47:13.240 --> 1:47:15.560]  some kind of a fairness doctrine to
[1:47:15.560 --> 1:47:18.720]  shut down any criticism of obama the press
[1:47:18.720 --> 1:47:20.600]  it'd be very much more difficult i mean
[1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:23.200]  look how difficult it was for me but i went to
[1:47:23.200 --> 1:47:24.200]  kenya
[1:47:24.200 --> 1:47:27.320]  researching kenya the one day i'm trying to do a press conference
[1:47:27.320 --> 1:47:29.200]  i'm arrested and by the way
[1:47:29.200 --> 1:47:30.680]  today in africa
[1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:32.720]  all dinged is already saying
[1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:35.560]  he deserves a payback for arresting me
[1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:37.880]  because that helped elect obama
[1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:39.960]  so just wait to see
[1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:42.880]  you know the extent to which the press is suppressed
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:48.680]  under obama regime that really doesn't want any criticism at all
[1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:52.880]  well i don't know why folks think having a black face is going to change anything
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:56.680]  when obama works for the very same big wall street international firms
[1:47:56.680 --> 1:47:59.960]  that are leading the economy right now and he's a big cheerleader for me
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:04.440]  obama got but it as much or more of the campaign contributions
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:08.360]  from the major wall street firms that became ever did way more
[1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:13.400]  way more i think you're right now in line for reorganization of wall street
[1:48:13.400 --> 1:48:17.040]  and the one firm which survived and i don't think it's accidental
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:17.920]  golden tax
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:19.120]  thrived
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:22.360]  golden tax thrived on the downturn of the housing
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:23.800]  you've got paulson
[1:48:23.800 --> 1:48:26.360]  that any number of people from golden tax
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:28.960]  they'll come out of this organization
[1:48:28.960 --> 1:48:31.800]  and golden tax under the obama administration
[1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:34.040]  will be the main wall street firm
[1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:37.280]  under which a wall street reorganization occurred
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:39.360]  a consolidation of wall street
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:41.480]  if i could see a consolidation of banking
[1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:46.280]  particle integration not her courses together will take some calls when we get back
[1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:49.920]  i am so frustrated i can't seem to remember anything anymore
[1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:50.520]  what

[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:01.640]  obama's now at the white house meeting with the outgoing puppet while we're
[1:52:01.640 --> 1:52:05.200]  all busy watching them the big corporations are looting everything
[1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:11.960]  briefly dr. Corsi because you know you're into economics does it even make you
[1:52:11.960 --> 1:52:17.400]  stand back though in awe to see the level of corporate looting and to openly see
[1:52:17.400 --> 1:52:21.480]  them announcing world government of and by the banks and that they are
[1:52:21.480 --> 1:52:24.520]  literally just taking trillions that we're gonna have to pay back and tax
[1:52:24.520 --> 1:52:28.800]  money was amazing because again i predict it now because exactly what i
[1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:33.640]  wrote only create with a by the way it'll never be paid back what they'll do
[1:52:33.640 --> 1:52:37.840]  is they'll create a new currency the new currency will essentially be a
[1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:42.680]  devaluation and so they'll basically forgive all of these loans that they're
[1:52:42.680 --> 1:52:48.360]  paying back right now the loans will be translated into equity and you'll see
[1:52:48.360 --> 1:52:52.680]  the next round being government ownership and international ownership
[1:52:52.680 --> 1:52:57.720]  because you'll see the next you know immediately the petrodollar states we're
[1:52:57.720 --> 1:53:01.480]  already holding meetings the treasury people know very little about the
[1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:05.120]  treasury is already holding meeting with the petrodollar states as to how
[1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:09.840]  sharia law can be introduced into the account economics of the united states to
[1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:16.120]  invite petrodollar and investments china is very angry china hate seeing you know
[1:53:16.120 --> 1:53:21.200]  the investments that they've made a lot of these you know subprime loans were
[1:53:21.200 --> 1:53:25.960]  sold to china china wants to return on their money china is gonna want to see
[1:53:25.960 --> 1:53:28.760]  direct investment the united states by the way i want to go back there people
[1:53:28.760 --> 1:53:31.840]  don't know that sharia law is just as long as lomic law they think it's
[1:53:31.840 --> 1:53:35.360]  drowning your daughter in the pool they don't understand it's only one small
[1:53:35.360 --> 1:53:42.560]  part of it one ballpark i mean the sharia law is is is so that larger
[1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:46.880]  international institutions can do business with those countries most of
[1:53:46.880 --> 1:53:51.560]  sharia law is about economics sharia law has fundamental controls over
[1:53:51.560 --> 1:53:57.320]  economics and sharia law when it comes to economics is completely different than
[1:53:57.320 --> 1:54:02.000]  u.s. law the rules are different interest is different the handling of money the
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:06.600]  handling of control what you can and cannot do in a corporation is different
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:11.600]  if you think that you know women are not i just can't wait to see what the
[1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:16.640]  feminists are going to do once sharia law is imposed upon economic activity in
[1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:21.440]  banks be lucky to see women advanced in banks at all or women advanced in
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:26.960]  corporations that are owned by Arab investors who are not fond at all of
[1:54:26.960 --> 1:54:32.160]  seeing women advanced to be a fundamentally different world oh man let's take

[2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:21.640]  actually not a senator of the united states that he is not qualified to
[2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:26.320]  uh... be president of the united states uh... uh... dot just a month he could
[2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:28.720]  mention late last week that
[2:01:28.720 --> 2:01:32.920]  to his understanding that mister berg is going to the supreme court on december
[2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:34.320]  first
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:38.400]  and he is going to be presenting documents at the court
[2:01:38.400 --> 2:01:41.640]  at the request of justice david suitor
[2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:46.040]  uh... which will be in the direction of exposing the non-citizenship of
[2:01:46.040 --> 2:01:49.280]  mister barack obama
[2:01:49.280 --> 2:01:50.840]  beyond that alex
[2:01:50.840 --> 2:01:54.600]  uh... rick wiles reported last week
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:01:59.240]  that barack obama's actual current legal name
[2:01:59.240 --> 2:02:02.240]  uh... assuming he's never had a name change

[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:08.240]  s a t o r o yes
[2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:09.560]  and

[2:02:11.640 --> 2:02:12.360]  on
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:16.320]  barack obama's indonesian school application for a believer was for the
[2:02:16.320 --> 2:02:18.360]  most of the school he attended
[2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:19.920]  and then the nation
[2:02:19.920 --> 2:02:23.800]  and showing his birthplace is being indonesia in his name is very
[2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:26.160]  sort of

[2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:42.200]  because

[2:02:46.640 --> 2:02:50.240]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:53.480]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[2:02:53.480 --> 2:02:57.040]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:02:57.880]  bread line
[2:02:57.880 --> 2:03:01.320]  you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the superdome and beg for

[2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:08.880]  elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest
[2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:12.320]  so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and
[2:03:12.320 --> 2:03:16.040]  email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty million dollars at least out
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:19.680]  of thin air this money now owns the american and european banks the
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:23.440]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[2:03:23.440 --> 2:03:27.520]  nothing and blast the cost of assassins particularly food beyond many
[2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:32.000]  americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:36.560]  doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are
[2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:40.760]  skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private
[2:03:40.760 --> 2:03:44.400]  banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough
[2:03:44.400 --> 2:03:48.200]  money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices
[2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:52.080]  to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be
[2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:55.760]  ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:03:59.840]  between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes
[2:03:59.840 --> 2:04:03.920]  get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening

[2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:10.520]  food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's
[2:04:10.520 --> 2:04:14.840]  a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take

[2:05:22.640 --> 2:05:27.480]  excellent article who are the architects of economic collapse Michelle
[2:05:27.480 --> 2:05:33.760]  Chasadowski professor researcher and we really appreciate him joining us today
[2:05:33.760 --> 2:05:37.560]  to go over this detailed article in the next 25 minutes we're gonna have open
[2:05:37.560 --> 2:05:41.800]  phones for the balance of the radio broadcast and a bunch of other scientific
[2:05:41.800 --> 2:05:45.640]  news like two billion honeybees dying in England alone directly linked to
[2:05:45.640 --> 2:05:50.280]  genetically engineered pesticide that's right the corn itself has pesticide in
[2:05:50.280 --> 2:05:55.600]  it and it's killing the bees it's just one part of this so we'll be covering
[2:05:55.600 --> 2:06:00.640]  that as well professor you have a big bio but I always like to introduce you
[2:06:00.640 --> 2:06:05.280]  briefly the most important parts of your bio so people understand that you know
[2:06:05.280 --> 2:06:12.240]  of what you speak well essentially I'm a macroeconomist specializing in the
[2:06:12.240 --> 2:06:17.200]  international financial system but I'm also looking at military aspect the war
[2:06:17.200 --> 2:06:24.920]  because it's all in fact everything is interconnected yes and this crisis has
[2:06:24.920 --> 2:06:29.720]  been cooking for quite a number of years it goes back to what was called the the
[2:06:29.720 --> 2:06:37.240]  1999 financial services modernization act which was a major legislative
[2:06:37.240 --> 2:06:40.920]  initiative of the Clinton administration and which virtually led to the
[2:06:40.920 --> 2:06:46.000]  deregulation of the banking system you know laying the ground the groundworks
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:50.840]  for the for the meltdown of financial markets under the bush administration
[2:06:50.840 --> 2:06:55.240]  all right I want you to break it down and it's all there publicly in view but
[2:06:55.240 --> 2:06:58.880]  it's still even though we knew this was coming to watch them first let's get
[2:06:58.880 --> 2:07:03.960]  into how they engineered this then they pose as saviors they terrorize the
[2:07:03.960 --> 2:07:07.820]  congress and say pass this or we'll have depression then they take the trillion
[2:07:07.820 --> 2:07:13.040]  plus not a hundred billion and give it directly to themselves to buy healthy
[2:07:13.040 --> 2:07:18.800]  institutions like Franklin federal here in Texas not ailing ones and then they
[2:07:18.800 --> 2:07:23.160]  give it to themselves as cash bonuses I mean this is unparalleled and now
[2:07:23.160 --> 2:07:29.160]  Obama is one of the architects of this and help ram it through last month now
[2:07:29.160 --> 2:07:32.520]  he's coming in promising to give them even more power and have a world
[2:07:32.520 --> 2:07:37.880]  regulatory system run by the very inner group of banks that orchestrated all of
[2:07:37.880 --> 2:07:43.120]  this or really seeing the birth of the world government or oven by the private
[2:07:43.120 --> 2:07:49.800]  banks with a nice carbon tax on top of it paid directly to them well precisely
[2:07:49.800 --> 2:07:57.400]  this is a project of the major financial houses on wall street it is
[2:07:57.400 --> 2:08:06.680]  it's a project which purports to centralize management of the financial
[2:08:06.680 --> 2:08:11.640]  system both nationally and internationally in the hands of a of a
[2:08:11.640 --> 2:08:21.520]  few big fish Bank America JP Morgan Chase city group on and I think what is
[2:08:21.520 --> 2:08:28.760]  what is worth mentioning here is the logic behind this bailout because when
[2:08:28.760 --> 2:08:36.640]  you actually pay money to the banks you do it from the public purse which means
[2:08:36.640 --> 2:08:43.520]  that you have to run a big deficit either you run a big deficit or you cut all
[2:08:43.520 --> 2:08:50.160]  other expenditures across the board you run up the public debt and and the public
[2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:54.800]  debt in in the United States is now of the order of ten ten or eleven trillion
[2:08:54.800 --> 2:08:59.280]  dollars and if you if you have another trillion which is in handouts to the
[2:08:59.280 --> 2:09:05.400]  banks that means the public debt goes up and then what do you do you ask the
[2:09:05.400 --> 2:09:10.080]  banks to lend you the money so that you can pay the bailout that that is the
[2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:18.120]  very crucial relationship is to finance the bailout the the US Treasury has to
[2:09:18.120 --> 2:09:23.000]  borrow the money and who do they borrow the money they borrow it from financial
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:28.320]  institutions or they ask the financial institutions to transact and to broker
[2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:32.840]  the the debt operation the sale of Treasury bills government bonds all
[2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:37.720]  over the world okay so that in effect what the government is doing is
[2:09:37.720 --> 2:09:45.880]  financing its own indebtedness it is it is handing money to the to its creditors
[2:09:45.880 --> 2:09:50.200]  and then his creditors are saying well we will lend you the money and then with
[2:09:50.200 --> 2:09:54.280]  the money that we lend you you can finance the bailout okay that's what's
[2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:59.960]  happening and it's a it's a circular relationship it's absurd and what does it
[2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:08.680]  do it can do one of two things one it can literally push the public debt I mean
[2:10:08.680 --> 2:10:15.800]  spiraling public debt going from let's say from from it won't go from ten eleven
[2:10:15.800 --> 2:10:22.080]  to twelve it will go much further because the deflationary impact of this
[2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:27.000]  financial operation on the real economy is devastating so when you when you have
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:32.280]  less people working companies going bankrupt they don't pay taxes okay so
[2:10:32.280 --> 2:10:39.120]  revenues are going to collapse state revenues are going to collapse and and
[2:10:39.120 --> 2:10:44.920]  the way in which you can finance this deficit is either curtailing every
[2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:50.720]  single category of expenditure which served the broader public health
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:11:01.480]  education urban infrastructure you name it okay or you can literally run a very
[2:11:01.480 --> 2:11:08.080]  large deficit which then means a major a major public debt operation and there
[2:11:08.080 --> 2:11:12.360]  the banks will literally strangle you because they will actually control the
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:16.600]  the whole state apparatus I think we're going towards a combination of both
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:23.560]  rising deficit and public debt on the one hand and a massive curtailment of all
[2:11:23.560 --> 2:11:28.600]  categories of public expenditure in a scenario where the real economy is
[2:11:28.600 --> 2:11:33.960]  collapsing well that's what they do these banks they take the bailout and as you
[2:11:33.960 --> 2:11:39.520]  suggested and they start buying out other financial institutions but they they
[2:11:39.520 --> 2:11:45.800]  they will also be buying out the real economy general motors the you name it
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:52.760]  I mean airlines hotel chains they got so much cash that they can literally buy
[2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:56.920]  out what we describe what we describe as the real economy so it's a
[2:11:56.920 --> 2:12:00.920]  consolidation and on the surface as we learned at Bilderberg almost three years
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:05.000]  ago they were going to cut off liquidity to the general economy call it a crisis
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:09.520]  terrorized governments into handing over governmental power so it's not the
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:14.280]  government taking over the banks it's the banks becoming the true bosses of the
[2:12:14.280 --> 2:12:19.720]  government and then the loot and then continue and then continuing and I want
[2:12:19.720 --> 2:12:24.360]  you to comment on this professor and then continuing to cut off liquidity to
[2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:28.960]  deepen it while using the media they own to tell the people that everything's
[2:12:28.960 --> 2:12:33.920]  fine and they're using Obama and his change as the cover to get this cemented
[2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:38.200]  through so speak more to that professor and then well the 64 million question
[2:12:38.200 --> 2:12:47.640]  will they be successful Obama is is is being Obama is providing in fact the
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:53.560]  smoke screen for this whole operation it's it's a neoliberal agenda with a
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:13:00.160]  so-called human face he has a populist rhetoric it appeals to people he sounds
[2:13:00.160 --> 2:13:05.280]  very sincere from a personal point of view I think he's certainly an
[2:13:05.280 --> 2:13:10.600]  improvement over George W. Bush he's he's educated I think he has a certain
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:15.560]  feeling and commitment but the kind of people who are supporting him and
[2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:21.520]  financing his campaign have other types of feelings and what you described is
[2:13:21.520 --> 2:13:29.440]  exactly what is happening the liquidity the credit is being cut off to virtually
[2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:35.640]  every single productive unit across the land to any kind of public or
[2:13:35.640 --> 2:13:42.040]  community-based initiative municipal governments grass-roots organizations
[2:13:42.040 --> 2:13:47.560]  state local government federal government agencies health education etc.
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:54.200]  school boards and essentially what's happening is that all types of debts
[2:13:54.200 --> 2:14:00.800]  private public debts are going to simply skyrocket leading to bankruptcies
[2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:07.040]  strings of bankruptcies municipal debts will go up I mean we know about Orange
[2:14:07.040 --> 2:14:11.760]  County we're going to have lots of orange counties all over the land and
[2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:16.080]  and eventually what they want to do is to privatize the municipalities as well
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:23.840]  I mean that that's that that's ultimate the ultimate objective is to privatize
[2:14:23.840 --> 2:14:28.320]  urban space roads you know it'll be a whole bunch of but it's not even
[2:14:28.320 --> 2:14:32.080]  privatizing they're just they're just handing it over looting everything they
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:35.840]  said they're gonna grab the 83 interstate highways in the US and hand them
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:41.120]  to multinationals as international zones the taxes North American Union mass
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:46.960]  corruption what about these youth brigades and million-man spy forces and
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:52.280]  compulsory service I mean he had that on his website change.gov and then
[2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:57.000]  pulled it and now his people are saying it didn't exist I mean this is crazy I
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:04.320]  didn't see that but there's it's clear that that the various pieces of
[2:15:04.320 --> 2:15:09.680]  legislation and presidential directors which were implemented during the
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:15.720]  Bush administration which established the contours of a police state will still
[2:15:15.720 --> 2:15:23.080]  are still there and they will be used to appease any kind of protest movement
[2:15:23.080 --> 2:15:30.120]  against against this economic policy this is an absolutely devastating
[2:15:30.120 --> 2:15:35.760]  economic agenda and that if you look at the the candidates that the people who
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:42.480]  were envisaged to occupy key positions but specifically the treasury
[2:15:42.480 --> 2:15:48.000]  secretary we're talking about people already have a track record the front
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:55.320]  runner for for the position to head the the US Treasury Department is Lawrence
[2:15:55.320 --> 2:16:00.720]  Summers okay now he's a he's a distinguished professor at Harvard
[2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:06.360]  University is a former president of Harvard but he's better known he was he
[2:16:06.360 --> 2:16:13.520]  was with the World Bank for quite a while and he's all he was also with the
[2:16:13.520 --> 2:16:18.000]  secretary of the Treasury in the last year and a half of the Clinton
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:22.560]  administration and he played a key role in lobbying Congress for the repeal of
[2:16:22.560 --> 2:16:27.560]  what is called the Glass-Steagall Act okay the Glass-Steagall Act is it was
[2:16:27.560 --> 2:16:32.760]  enacted during the Roosevelt administration it was essentially it was
[2:16:32.760 --> 2:16:38.920]  essentially a mechanism to to retain a certain level of sanity in the banking
[2:16:38.920 --> 2:16:43.640]  system to prevent people from speculating and and it and and essentially
[2:16:43.640 --> 2:16:47.880]  that kind of it didn't let banks and insurance companies and brokerage firms
[2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:51.600]  mix which they don't do it stay there stay there we're gonna come back talk
[2:16:51.600 --> 2:17:00.560]  about it question is the world getting better or vastly worse the world

[2:21:01.240 --> 2:21:04.840]  private inner circle of central banks the folks that own the Federal Reserve of
[2:21:04.840 --> 2:21:09.120]  megamingland they changed laws under Clinton Bush continued it fight into
[2:21:09.120 --> 2:21:14.320]  their new guy barkey as they call him
[2:21:14.320 --> 2:21:18.320]  yet the public totally like zombies crying their eyes out thinking
[2:21:18.320 --> 2:21:24.720]  everything's fine they have no idea that rock obama is total new world order
[2:21:24.720 --> 2:21:30.320]  and they're talking about you know staging terror attacks foreign seeking
[2:21:30.320 --> 2:21:34.080]  grandstand there going into more countries he's telling the left now
[2:21:34.080 --> 2:21:38.000]  get ready i'm gonna do stuff you're not gonna like professor chassadosky what
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:39.520]  do you think those things are gonna be
[2:21:39.520 --> 2:21:45.840]  what do you see happening in the future well i see certainly a continuity in
[2:21:45.840 --> 2:21:54.720]  u.s. foreign policy we can we you know the same group of people well not quite
[2:21:54.720 --> 2:22:00.360]  the same group of people now you have big new brisinski who is who is the god
[2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:08.400]  father of of the democrats going back to the Carter administration i think in a
[2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:13.880]  sense i feel a little bit safer with obama than with george w bush because
[2:22:13.880 --> 2:22:18.480]  if it's a choice of of let's say an all-out war in the middle east on the
[2:22:18.480 --> 2:22:27.320]  one hand and and you know and and a nuclear war on the other hand that kind
[2:22:27.320 --> 2:22:34.120]  of choice is still important to make i i i i think that the thrust of u.s.
[2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:41.360]  foreign policy is the same and it goes back to the truman doctrine it's it's
[2:22:41.360 --> 2:22:49.560]  there to to gain hegemony we're talking about hegemony in the military sphere as
[2:22:49.560 --> 2:22:55.400]  well as in in the spheres of finance but that's only for the bankers not for us
[2:22:55.400 --> 2:23:00.480]  the people we pay for it all and get nothing absolutely now i think what's
[2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:05.600]  very important is in a week from now we're going to have this major financial
[2:23:05.600 --> 2:23:12.640]  summit in in washington dc and i think that what is going to be proposed at
[2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:20.120]  least by the u.s. administration is a unipolar financial system which will be
[2:23:20.120 --> 2:23:27.400]  dominated by a handful of of of u.s. or maybe perhaps a handful of u.s.
[2:23:27.400 --> 2:23:37.760]  european british financial institutions rather than some kind of a of a
[2:23:37.760 --> 2:23:44.280]  multipolar system where you you trade with with china russia and it's going to
[2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:48.840]  be a new heavily centralized world reserve currency made up of a basket of
[2:23:48.840 --> 2:23:56.200]  select currencies with this private banking group carrying out governmental
[2:23:56.200 --> 2:24:03.000]  operations well i think that the the agenda is literally to to destabilize
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:09.640]  any competing yes world currency including the euro for that matter whether
[2:24:09.640 --> 2:24:13.280]  they will achieve that objective is another matter because the dollar we
[2:24:13.280 --> 2:24:18.400]  know that the dollar is heavily overextended the dollar denominated debts
[2:24:18.400 --> 2:24:25.160]  are in the trillions the chinese and the japanese hold those debts and but at
[2:24:25.160 --> 2:24:32.000]  the same time we must understand that china in in 2001 opened up its entire
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:38.600]  banking system to to foreign banks in fact in a bilateral agreement which was
[2:24:38.600 --> 2:24:43.560]  signed prior to its entry to the world trade organization so that will these
[2:24:43.560 --> 2:24:51.240]  these other regional powers have the capabilities of doing something else
[2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:59.960]  brazil there's there was a meeting last week in brazil of the group of 20 the G
[2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:05.760]  20 which includes some of the regional powers as well but in effect if you look
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:11.560]  at latin america as a whole and you look at brazil in particular i don't see any
[2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:20.320]  alternative alternative banking structure venezuela perhaps with its
[2:25:20.320 --> 2:25:28.720]  project of the banco del sur the bank of the south but in effect the the
[2:25:28.720 --> 2:25:35.400]  united states hold these countries in in you know politically they're very much
[2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:41.080]  in they're very much controlled by the united states and and economically they
[2:25:41.080 --> 2:25:44.600]  controlled by the fire by the international monetary fund and the
[2:25:44.600 --> 2:25:50.600]  world bank so we're not uh... and i don't see that that uh... that barack obama
[2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:56.040]  will will change this uh... this agenda in any way but he'll make it feel good
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:25:59.800]  about being uh... financially slaughtered and that's what's important
[2:25:59.800 --> 2:26:04.680]  some actually being free it's smiling it's having somebody who smiles at me
[2:26:04.680 --> 2:26:07.160]  while they slip my throat so i uh...
[2:26:07.160 --> 2:26:10.080]  that's why i think obama so much worse with bush you have this
[2:26:10.080 --> 2:26:15.640]  translucent skin little demon you know who just radiated uh...
[2:26:15.640 --> 2:26:17.200]  stand out
[2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:18.960]  that's correct i mean
[2:26:18.960 --> 2:26:23.600]  what what though what i'm saying with all of our administration will do is it
[2:26:23.600 --> 2:26:24.400]  will
[2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:28.720]  it it it will use the rhetoric to confuse people
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:32.760]  it will say well we're here to uh... put through the
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:36.600]  uh... the interest of main street america we're going to look after them

[2:30:35.160 --> 2:30:39.160]  some of the other news stories and information that we're going to be covering
[2:30:39.160 --> 2:30:44.160]  a professor you got cut off by the break there
[2:30:44.160 --> 2:30:47.160]  you were talking about Obama will confuse people with the rhetoric
[2:30:47.160 --> 2:30:51.160]  it's all this talk about change and hope and helping people
[2:30:51.160 --> 2:30:56.160]  and I wasn't for McCain either but McCain actually said let's give some of the bailout to people
[2:30:56.160 --> 2:31:00.160]  let's just forgive some mortgages you know at least for the amount
[2:31:00.160 --> 2:31:04.160]  that they're claiming is a bad loan and Obama said no
[2:31:04.160 --> 2:31:08.160]  and it literally is just giving our money we pay for in tax money and devaluation
[2:31:08.160 --> 2:31:12.160]  to them I mean the level of this heist and
[2:31:12.160 --> 2:31:16.160]  all these editorials about how the bill of rights is back and the constitution is back
[2:31:16.160 --> 2:31:20.160]  but it isn't and he's appointing all these people that are always attacking the bill of rights
[2:31:20.160 --> 2:31:24.160]  and he's going to keep all these powers and so it's a cementing
[2:31:24.160 --> 2:31:28.160]  of everything George Bush got done and the left
[2:31:28.160 --> 2:31:32.160]  is just dancing around drunkenly
[2:31:32.160 --> 2:31:36.160]  well that's correct I think that the left
[2:31:36.160 --> 2:31:40.160]  has an allegiance to
[2:31:40.160 --> 2:31:44.160]  a political party namely the democrats and the democrats
[2:31:44.160 --> 2:31:48.160]  have an allegiance they have an allegiance to Wall Street
[2:31:48.160 --> 2:31:52.160]  in the same way as the republicans is the bipartisan consensus
[2:31:52.160 --> 2:31:56.160]  and we can see this very clearly
[2:31:56.160 --> 2:32:00.160]  I mean the transition team is made up of bankers and politicians
[2:32:00.160 --> 2:32:04.160]  there's not a single I mean there isn't
[2:32:04.160 --> 2:32:08.160]  somebody from organized labor or from community
[2:32:08.160 --> 2:32:12.160]  organizations are the african-american leaders
[2:32:12.160 --> 2:32:16.160]  are the prominent feminists no there's a bunch of bankers
[2:32:16.160 --> 2:32:20.160]  there's not even tokens in there
[2:32:20.160 --> 2:32:24.160]  there's not even tokens I haven't gone through the complete
[2:32:24.160 --> 2:32:28.160]  I mean there's the various lists there but I certainly looked at the list of
[2:32:28.160 --> 2:32:32.160]  the candidates for the position of secretary of the treasury
[2:32:32.160 --> 2:32:36.160]  or his advisory panel with Paul Volcker and every other
[2:32:36.160 --> 2:32:40.160]  well some of the people on the advisory panel
[2:32:40.160 --> 2:32:44.160]  are also candidates for positions so you know but that's not unusual
[2:32:44.160 --> 2:32:48.160]  I think that first of all
[2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:52.160]  well one has to understand
[2:32:52.160 --> 2:32:56.160]  what might be
[2:32:56.160 --> 2:33:00.160]  an alternative agenda there's some people
[2:33:00.160 --> 2:33:04.160]  Kucinich and
[2:33:04.160 --> 2:33:08.160]  definitely neither have alluded
[2:33:08.160 --> 2:33:12.160]  to the possibilities of an alternative economic agenda as an economist
[2:33:12.160 --> 2:33:16.160]  if I wanted to tame the markets the first thing
[2:33:16.160 --> 2:33:20.160]  I'd do would to be to freeze all speculative instruments
[2:33:20.160 --> 2:33:24.160]  it's a very easy thing to do you simply freeze
[2:33:24.160 --> 2:33:28.160]  speculative trade in other words derivatives
[2:33:28.160 --> 2:33:32.160]  and you restore
[2:33:32.160 --> 2:33:36.160]  in a sense the hegemony of the real economy
[2:33:36.160 --> 2:33:40.160]  over the financial sector rather than the reverse and said they're feeding the entire
[2:33:40.160 --> 2:33:44.160]  real economy into the maw of a very creature that caused the problem
[2:33:44.160 --> 2:33:48.160]  to begin with exactly because
[2:33:48.160 --> 2:33:52.160]  for the last I'd say well it goes back to the Reagan administration
[2:33:52.160 --> 2:33:56.160]  but the sources of enrichment have been within
[2:33:56.160 --> 2:34:00.160]  the financial system mainly through
[2:34:00.160 --> 2:34:04.160]  insider information and speculation on the movement
[2:34:04.160 --> 2:34:08.160]  of stocks using indexed bonds options
[2:34:08.160 --> 2:34:12.160]  short selling and so on so forth so that when the market goes down
[2:34:12.160 --> 2:34:16.160]  you make money when it goes up you make money etc
[2:34:16.160 --> 2:34:20.160]  and essentially what we've seen happen in the last couple of months
[2:34:20.160 --> 2:34:24.160]  is a massive transfer of wealth
[2:34:24.160 --> 2:34:28.160]  from ordinary Americans their life long savings
[2:34:28.160 --> 2:34:32.160]  that they invested in the stock market confiscated and transferred to the hedge funds
[2:34:32.160 --> 2:34:36.160]  and then what happens is that all this money
[2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:40.160]  is then used to buy up everything
[2:34:40.160 --> 2:34:44.160]  from motors to airlines and so on
[2:34:44.160 --> 2:34:48.160]  well professor in closing with you
[2:34:48.160 --> 2:34:52.160]  the public's already mad thousand one phone calls against the banker takeover
[2:34:52.160 --> 2:34:56.160]  what is going to happen when the public finds out they've been betrayed again
[2:34:56.160 --> 2:35:00.160]  and that the entire economy has been fed into the hands of the
[2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:04.160]  international banking syndicate I mean is it just they have militarized police
[2:35:04.160 --> 2:35:08.160]  they just keep their foot on our throats we go into a long dark
[2:35:08.160 --> 2:35:12.160]  and then we just become like every other third world country and worldwide
[2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:16.160]  that's your new world order is this international system of banks
[2:35:16.160 --> 2:35:20.160]  above the slaves I mean is that basically yet
[2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:24.160]  well I think people are going to resist this I think that
[2:35:24.160 --> 2:35:28.160]  this process which is now taking place
[2:35:28.160 --> 2:35:32.160]  is very visible Obama has not yet
[2:35:32.160 --> 2:35:36.160]  entered the presidency and he's already made alliances
[2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:40.160]  with a whole series of people and
[2:35:40.160 --> 2:35:44.160]  wealthy individuals with banks and corporations
[2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:48.160]  and so on and he hasn't
[2:35:48.160 --> 2:35:52.160]  signified any real shift as far as
[2:35:52.160 --> 2:35:56.160]  Middle East foreign policy is concerned
[2:35:56.160 --> 2:36:00.160]  he's still threatening Iran
[2:36:00.160 --> 2:36:04.160]  I think people are going to wake up across America
[2:36:04.160 --> 2:36:08.160]  and there's going to be a very significant protest movement
[2:36:08.160 --> 2:36:12.160]  very different from what we might have seen during the Bush administration
[2:36:12.160 --> 2:36:16.160]  people are going to come to realize that party politics
[2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:20.160]  is not the answer to meaningful change
[2:36:20.160 --> 2:36:24.160]  they must understand that
[2:36:24.160 --> 2:36:28.160]  the bipartisan system Democrats and Republicans
[2:36:28.160 --> 2:36:32.160]  is not democracy
[2:36:32.160 --> 2:36:36.160]  it in fact forecloses the possibility of any kind
[2:36:36.160 --> 2:36:40.160]  of real democracy and how this protest movement
[2:36:40.160 --> 2:36:44.160]  is going to unfold is very difficult to predict but I think it's going to
[2:36:44.160 --> 2:36:48.160]  happen and it won't come from the
[2:36:48.160 --> 2:36:52.160]  left necessarily it'll come from the grassroots
[2:36:52.160 --> 2:36:56.160]  from mainstream America once they start realizing
[2:36:56.160 --> 2:37:00.160]  that they have been taken in deceived
[2:37:00.160 --> 2:37:04.160]  by the rhetoric and imposed an economic
[2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:08.160]  agenda which ultimately impoverishes them and destroys their
[2:37:08.160 --> 2:37:12.160]  livelihood but they're going to turn loose the Obama youth corps
[2:37:12.160 --> 2:37:16.160]  as their kind of fake rabble or like the U.N.
[2:37:16.160 --> 2:37:20.160]  points to non-governmental organizations and says see they're the people
[2:37:20.160 --> 2:37:24.160]  but really it's a renomab of young
[2:37:24.160 --> 2:37:28.160]  unemployed dumb down people that think that those protesting Obama
[2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:32.160]  are the ones that have caused heaven to not materialize
[2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:36.160]  on earth and the Denver police just admitted Friday
[2:37:36.160 --> 2:37:40.160]  in the Denver Post that they staged riots at the DNC
[2:37:40.160 --> 2:37:44.160]  they went out and attacked cops so that they could
[2:37:44.160 --> 2:37:48.160]  it's just to realize the government is that evil
[2:37:48.160 --> 2:37:52.160]  constantly doing this the government really doesn't like free speech
[2:37:52.160 --> 2:37:56.160]  they really don't like freedom we really do have an evil government
[2:37:56.160 --> 2:38:00.160]  and they just don't care they're going to steal
[2:38:00.160 --> 2:38:04.160]  all the money they're going to increase the amount of paramilitary police
[2:38:04.160 --> 2:38:08.160]  they're going to turn mindless Obama noids loose on us
[2:38:08.160 --> 2:38:12.160]  this is going to be a really interesting road we're going down and people can learn a lot more
[2:38:12.160 --> 2:38:16.160]  about your great analysis and the great writers you've got it
[2:38:16.160 --> 2:38:20.160]  globalresearch.ca and we appreciate you coming on with us

[2:38:44.160 --> 2:38:48.160]  there he goes ladies and gentlemen
[2:38:48.160 --> 2:38:52.160]  you know people accuse me a lot without ever giving any evidence
[2:38:52.160 --> 2:38:56.160]  of exaggerating or
[2:38:56.160 --> 2:39:00.160]  trying to scare people folks I'm not a very
[2:39:00.160 --> 2:39:04.160]  worldly person you know I'm sick today I have
[2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:08.160]  a chest cold a head cold
[2:39:08.160 --> 2:39:12.160]  well it feels worse right now it feels like it's going into the flu or something
[2:39:12.160 --> 2:39:16.160]  but I'll be fine if I just get home and get some sleep and I'm not whining about myself the point is
[2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:20.160]  I didn't get out of bed at 6 30 in the morning
[2:39:20.160 --> 2:39:24.160]  I got out of bed sick after shivering all night
[2:39:24.160 --> 2:39:28.160]  you know with whatever it is I've got because I like coming up here and being a big shot
[2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:32.160]  I got out of bed this morning
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:36.160]  to come down here because I
[2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:40.160]  know that every day I'm not in prison every day I'm not
[2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:44.160]  gunned down every day that they haven't completely brought us into a depression
[2:39:44.160 --> 2:39:48.160]  is a good day
[2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:52.160]  so this isn't a game or a joke I mean it's so bad
[2:39:52.160 --> 2:39:56.160]  that I can't even articulate it I mean I can get some
[2:39:56.160 --> 2:40:00.160]  economist on from Canada I can separately have Dr. Corsi on I can have a
[2:40:00.160 --> 2:40:04.160]  you know award-winning economist on they'll tell you the same thing
[2:40:04.160 --> 2:40:08.160]  I mean it's in the Boston Globe it's in the Associated Press it's on MSNBC
[2:40:08.160 --> 2:40:12.160]  CNN the London Telegraph that they are setting up a world government
[2:40:12.160 --> 2:40:16.160]  run foreign by the banks where they're going to
[2:40:16.160 --> 2:40:20.160]  manage every facet of our lives through these bureaucracies through
[2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:24.160]  national ID cards it's all being unified decades in the making
[2:40:24.160 --> 2:40:28.160]  by bankers
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:32.160]  who engineer depressions I mean we have their documents
[2:40:32.160 --> 2:40:36.160]  we have their reports they will destroy
[2:40:36.160 --> 2:40:40.160]  us because to them it's just cold-blooded numbers
[2:40:40.160 --> 2:40:44.160]  it's fraud it's criminal it's evil it's malicious
[2:40:44.160 --> 2:40:48.160]  and it's unspeakable and you're never going to hear Rush Limbaugh or Sean
[2:40:48.160 --> 2:40:52.160]  Hannity talk about this because they'll be off the air
[2:40:52.160 --> 2:40:56.160]  in a minute all those you know thousand plus
[2:40:56.160 --> 2:41:00.160]  AM and FM's those guys are on together they're there to act conservative
[2:41:00.160 --> 2:41:04.160]  make fun of liberals act like liberals are just dumb idiots
[2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:08.160]  and they are at the grassroots it's like mainland conservatives are they're part of a false
[2:41:08.160 --> 2:41:12.160]  paradigm but they're there to tell you
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:16.160]  there's no North American Union there's no bankings government
[2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:20.160]  when it's in the news being announced by them
[2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:24.160]  I mean if Rush Limbaugh went on air and said there's a new world order we've got to stop it
[2:41:24.160 --> 2:41:28.160]  he that guy has probably 30 40 million
[2:41:28.160 --> 2:41:32.160]  people that are fans 25 million on average
[2:41:32.160 --> 2:41:36.160]  tune every week imagine
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:40.160]  but see he's been telling people for 15 years
[2:41:40.160 --> 2:41:44.160]  that it doesn't exist every show and all these good conservatives
[2:41:44.160 --> 2:41:48.160]  mainline you know people that found out it's true they call it they go Rush and
[2:41:48.160 --> 2:41:52.160]  he plays cookie music in the background and says you're a nut
[2:41:52.160 --> 2:41:56.160]  and that's because
[2:41:56.160 --> 2:42:00.160]  they've got all the dirt on Rush the women the drugs
[2:42:00.160 --> 2:42:04.160]  the I mean that guy's a party animal
[2:42:04.160 --> 2:42:08.160]  and
[2:42:08.160 --> 2:42:12.160]  you know he's a rock and roll jock big party
[2:42:12.160 --> 2:42:16.160]  animal that found out a shtick and I listen to him
[2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:20.160]  deceiving his listeners it's so funny to him and he taunts them
[2:42:20.160 --> 2:42:24.160]  and flaunts them and makes fun of them on his own show and this makes me
[2:42:24.160 --> 2:42:28.160]  want to puke I mean he just got another 300
[2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:32.160]  something million dollar contract
[2:42:32.160 --> 2:42:36.160]  I hope those 20 pieces of silver are good for you pal and so his listeners
[2:42:36.160 --> 2:42:40.160]  hear this show and they think oh well there can't be a North American union
[2:42:40.160 --> 2:42:44.160]  Rush says there isn't or there can't be a new world order
[2:42:44.160 --> 2:42:48.160]  because Rush says there isn't
[2:42:48.160 --> 2:42:52.160]  and then it's all about
[2:42:52.160 --> 2:42:56.160]  Republicans and Democrats I mean I heard him last night W.O.A.
[2:42:56.160 --> 2:43:00.160]  I was rearing him
[2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:04.160]  out of San Antonio I'm gonna go to your calls in a minute
[2:43:04.160 --> 2:43:08.160]  they were rearing him and
[2:43:08.160 --> 2:43:12.160]  he was talking about how John McCain's a liberal and John McCain
[2:43:12.160 --> 2:43:16.160]  sold out the campaign and how John McCain's own campaign
[2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:20.160]  people are destroying Sarah Palin and talking about her
[2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:24.160]  you know buying clothes and even Marcus on campaign money and
[2:43:24.160 --> 2:43:28.160]  how they're trying to destroy her because she's a real conservative leader
[2:43:28.160 --> 2:43:32.160]  and see
[2:43:32.160 --> 2:43:36.160]  that's all true
[2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:40.160]  but he's telling you when it's too late
[2:43:40.160 --> 2:43:44.160]  see it doesn't matter now he can tell you how you could have won the game
[2:43:44.160 --> 2:43:48.160]  back during the game but he's gonna tell you after
[2:43:48.160 --> 2:43:52.160]  you know Rush Limbaugh could go up and say oh look all these British newspapers reported
[2:43:52.160 --> 2:43:56.160]  that McCain illegally went to Lord Rothschild's palace and raised something like
[2:43:56.160 --> 2:44:00.160]  $5 million in one night and every contribution was a felony
[2:44:00.160 --> 2:44:04.160]  on U.S. citizens but see the corporate
[2:44:04.160 --> 2:44:08.160]  media, not the liberal media, they're owned by the military industrial complex
[2:44:08.160 --> 2:44:12.160]  the private defense contractors that run the military
[2:44:12.160 --> 2:44:16.160]  that's part of a psi op if they're these little it idiot liberals
[2:44:16.160 --> 2:44:20.160]  they don't want you to know that McCain
[2:44:20.160 --> 2:44:24.160]  went and took illegal contributions it's not gonna be about that now it's gonna be about
[2:44:24.160 --> 2:44:28.160]  oh uh Sarah Palin bought some clothes
[2:44:28.160 --> 2:44:32.160]  at Neiman Marcus that's something the average sheep can understand
[2:44:32.160 --> 2:44:36.160]  that's what that's being rich is buying a skirt
[2:44:36.160 --> 2:44:40.160]  at Neiman Marcus it's not stealing trillions of dollars
[2:44:40.160 --> 2:44:44.160]  or it's not going to the Rothschild Palace because Rothschilds don't exist
[2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:48.160]  Limbaugh says I remember him about 12 years ago
[2:44:48.160 --> 2:44:52.160]  he would still say the CFR didn't exist
[2:44:52.160 --> 2:44:56.160]  that was before they'd go on c-span and admit what they were doing
[2:44:56.160 --> 2:45:00.160]  and I'm not even here attacking Rush Limbaugh
[2:45:00.160 --> 2:45:04.160]  he's his own worst enemy, went deaf taking so many painkillers
[2:45:04.160 --> 2:45:08.160]  that it killed the nerves and that's what OxyContin does
[2:45:08.160 --> 2:45:12.160]  I mean he's in his own prison
[2:45:12.160 --> 2:45:16.160]  a worldly self-centered person
[2:45:16.160 --> 2:45:20.160]  married what three times never had any children because he's so selfish
[2:45:20.160 --> 2:45:24.160]  he has no idea and he's there to sell conservatives out
[2:45:24.160 --> 2:45:28.160]  just like Barack Obama is there to sell liberals out
[2:45:28.160 --> 2:45:32.160]  and you know
[2:45:32.160 --> 2:45:36.160]  I don't care what you say you can call me a communist because I'm against the North American Union
[2:45:36.160 --> 2:45:40.160]  or you can say I'm a liar and it doesn't exist
[2:45:40.160 --> 2:45:44.160]  when Judicial Watch sued and we got all the minutes
[2:45:44.160 --> 2:45:48.160]  the first thing on the agenda was how to keep it secret from the public
[2:45:48.160 --> 2:45:52.160]  I mean I don't have time for this
[2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:56.160]  childlike behavior of the Barack Obama supporters
[2:46:02.160 --> 2:46:04.160]  just running around and worshiping this person
[2:46:04.160 --> 2:46:08.160]  who was a puppet
[2:46:08.160 --> 2:46:12.160]  coming up when you go live on prisonplanet.tv next hour
[2:46:12.160 --> 2:46:16.160]  I'm gonna show you just in about three minutes at my parent's house
[2:46:16.160 --> 2:46:20.160]  all of the news articles
[2:46:20.160 --> 2:46:24.160]  that I just picked up in one pile
[2:46:24.160 --> 2:46:28.160]  because my mother reads it and it goes right in the recycle bin
[2:46:28.160 --> 2:46:32.160]  that's right by the birdcage because she uses part of it
[2:46:32.160 --> 2:46:36.160]  but I didn't have to fish this out of the birdcage
[2:46:36.160 --> 2:46:40.160]  and it was just every newspaper article, every magazine
[2:46:40.160 --> 2:46:44.160]  about how Obama is saving the Bill of Rights
[2:46:44.160 --> 2:46:48.160]  all lies
[2:46:48.160 --> 2:46:52.160]  but to the childlike public
[2:46:52.160 --> 2:46:56.160]  they want to be lied to
[2:46:56.160 --> 2:47:00.160]  and that's what's frustrating about it
[2:47:00.160 --> 2:47:04.160]  is that it's like
[2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:08.160]  talking to children and you're trying to explain to them
[2:47:08.160 --> 2:47:12.160]  I remember one time with my daughter
[2:47:12.160 --> 2:47:16.160]  it was like two years old when we were at this hotel that had a balcony
[2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:20.160]  it was like four storeys down and
[2:47:20.160 --> 2:47:24.160]  I was out there and she kept trying to climb up on it and I said honey that's dangerous if you fall off that
[2:47:24.160 --> 2:47:28.160]  so we ended up closing the door and locking it
[2:47:28.160 --> 2:47:32.160]  the point is now she knows it's dangerous

[2:48:58.160 --> 2:49:02.160]  a terrorist act of war against this country
[2:49:02.160 --> 2:49:04.160]  the enemy struck America on September 11th
[2:49:04.160 --> 2:49:06.160]  but who is the enemy?
[2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:08.160]  bin Laden, this is his MO

[2:51:27.160 --> 2:51:29.160]  again, early in the next hour
[2:51:29.160 --> 2:51:31.160]  I'm going to show you a few editorials and cartoons
[2:51:31.160 --> 2:51:34.160]  where Obama's been fixing the Constitution
[2:51:34.160 --> 2:51:36.160]  bringing liberty back
[2:51:36.160 --> 2:51:38.160]  no evidence of that
[2:51:38.160 --> 2:51:40.160]  it's all to the contrary
[2:51:40.160 --> 2:51:42.160]  attacking liberty at every front
[2:51:42.160 --> 2:51:45.160]  the Second Amendment
[2:51:45.160 --> 2:51:50.160]  he's now promising to go out to the borders with amnesty
[2:51:50.160 --> 2:51:52.160]  torture, the secret arrest, all those powers
[2:51:52.160 --> 2:51:54.160]  the wars, the warrantless wiretapping
[2:51:54.160 --> 2:51:57.160]  and all stays
[2:51:57.160 --> 2:52:00.160]  but now the media is going to depoliticize it
[2:52:00.160 --> 2:52:03.160]  so now it won't be an issue and that will cement it
[2:52:03.160 --> 2:52:05.160]  before we go to your calls
[2:52:05.160 --> 2:52:08.160]  I want to tell you about eFoods Direct

[2:52:15.160 --> 2:52:17.160]  it's where I've gotten my storeable foods
[2:52:17.160 --> 2:52:20.160]  they're freeze dried and dehydrated
[2:52:20.160 --> 2:52:22.160]  so they keep all of their nutrients of value
[2:52:22.160 --> 2:52:25.160]  and a lot of food stores in very small containers
[2:52:25.160 --> 2:52:27.160]  so it's very easy to store
[2:52:27.160 --> 2:52:29.160]  it lasts more than 10 years
[2:52:29.160 --> 2:52:31.160]  in climate control but if it's in your garage
[2:52:31.160 --> 2:52:33.160]  or attic like it is in my house
[2:52:33.160 --> 2:52:35.160]  then it lasts for 10 years

[2:52:55.160 --> 2:52:58.160]  Patrick in North Carolina, thanks for holding her on the air
[2:52:58.160 --> 2:53:01.160]  hey, I just had a couple questions about Obama
[2:53:01.160 --> 2:53:03.160]  first of all, what was that
[2:53:03.160 --> 2:53:06.160]  was it called a fairness doctrine
[2:53:06.160 --> 2:53:09.160]  that was basically about censorship that he supports
[2:53:09.160 --> 2:53:11.160]  yes, there'd never been anything like that
[2:53:11.160 --> 2:53:13.160]  in the United States until
[2:53:13.160 --> 2:53:15.160]  the 40s and 50s
[2:53:15.160 --> 2:53:18.160]  and because there was no real editorializing
[2:53:18.160 --> 2:53:20.160]  on radio and TV
[2:53:20.160 --> 2:53:22.160]  there were just a few preachers
[2:53:22.160 --> 2:53:24.160]  on the radio that would do some editorializing
[2:53:24.160 --> 2:53:26.160]  and because the corporations
[2:53:26.160 --> 2:53:28.160]  had consolidated everything down
[2:53:28.160 --> 2:53:30.160]  to just a few owners
[2:53:30.160 --> 2:53:32.160]  that they just told them, okay, you can't make
[2:53:32.160 --> 2:53:35.160]  any political statements during campaigns
[2:53:35.160 --> 2:53:38.160]  you know, your news readers can't comment
[2:53:38.160 --> 2:53:40.160]  well, now that there's been the proliferation
[2:53:40.160 --> 2:53:43.160]  of telecommunications and more media outlets
[2:53:45.160 --> 2:53:47.160]  in the mid-80s, people started complaining
[2:53:47.160 --> 2:53:49.160]  there were lawsuits, the fairness doctrine
[2:53:49.160 --> 2:53:51.160]  was found to be unconstitutional
[2:53:51.160 --> 2:53:53.160]  and of course everything they do, the Patriot Act
[2:53:53.160 --> 2:53:55.160]  is unpatriotic, so they call it patriotic
[2:53:55.160 --> 2:53:57.160]  these all have Orwellian names
[2:53:57.160 --> 2:53:59.160]  like the new freedom initiative
[2:53:59.160 --> 2:54:01.160]  is to force drug
[2:54:01.160 --> 2:54:03.160]  half the population of the US
[2:54:03.160 --> 2:54:05.160]  and how is that new freedom
[2:54:05.160 --> 2:54:07.160]  I mean, it's all Orwellian
[2:54:07.160 --> 2:54:09.160]  but they want to bring in a fairness doctrine
[2:54:09.160 --> 2:54:11.160]  where you can't criticize them
[2:54:11.160 --> 2:54:13.160]  where there's no First Amendment
[2:54:13.160 --> 2:54:15.160]  and they're not kidding, they're saying they're going to do it
[2:54:15.160 --> 2:54:18.160]  but that's called bringing the bill of rights back
[2:54:18.160 --> 2:54:20.160]  I just wanted to look that up
[2:54:20.160 --> 2:54:23.160]  my other question is about the Obama Youth Brigades
[2:54:23.160 --> 2:54:26.160]  you mentioned that they are basically like spies
[2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:28.160]  and I was wondering if you had any specifics on
[2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:31.160]  what exactly, what kind of tabulation
[2:54:31.160 --> 2:54:33.160]  they would be keeping on people
[2:54:33.160 --> 2:54:36.160]  okay, well there's a bunch of different divisions of these
[2:54:36.160 --> 2:54:39.160]  and they've expunged
[2:54:39.160 --> 2:54:41.160]  a lot of this off of the campaign site
[2:54:41.160 --> 2:54:44.160]  but we have screenshots of it up at infoawards.com
[2:54:44.160 --> 2:54:46.160]  and prismplanet.com, big article
[2:54:46.160 --> 2:54:48.160]  Paul Watson did on it today
[2:54:48.160 --> 2:54:50.160]  but what they're going to do is
[2:54:50.160 --> 2:54:52.160]  the Youth Brigades are separate
[2:54:52.160 --> 2:54:55.160]  I mean, I oversimplify
[2:54:55.160 --> 2:54:57.160]  let's just, you know what
[2:54:57.160 --> 2:54:59.160]  let me just do this
[2:54:59.160 --> 2:55:02.160]  let me just go to change.gov
[2:55:02.160 --> 2:55:05.160]  and then I can read it to you directly from there
[2:55:05.160 --> 2:55:07.160]  but it says
[2:55:07.160 --> 2:55:09.160]  sorry, I was just going to say, don't worry about that
[2:55:09.160 --> 2:55:10.160]  I'll go check that out
[2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:13.160]  I just wanted to know specifically what they would be
[2:55:13.160 --> 2:55:15.160]  what they would be keeping track of
[2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:17.160]  but that's probably a really hard question
[2:55:17.160 --> 2:55:19.160]  no, no, no, I mean, I'll be more than happy to tell you
[2:55:19.160 --> 2:55:21.160]  in fact, we'll start the next hour
[2:55:21.160 --> 2:55:23.160]  and we will
[2:55:23.160 --> 2:55:26.160]  I want to get rid of all the collars that are holding the longest first
[2:55:26.160 --> 2:55:30.160]  then I'll get into how the spies are already operating
[2:55:30.160 --> 2:55:32.160]  and what they'll do
[2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:36.160]  I'm just announcing it under Lord Obama

[2:57:23.160 --> 2:57:25.160]  I was at my parents' house
[2:57:25.160 --> 2:57:26.160]  I'm mainly an internet person
[2:57:26.160 --> 2:57:29.160]  There's not a lot of newspapers and magazines around the house anymore
[2:57:29.160 --> 2:57:32.160]  I read them all online but I was rummaging through their stuff
[2:57:32.160 --> 2:57:36.160]  And it's just every magazine, every newspaper
[2:57:36.160 --> 2:57:39.160]  It has Barack Obama saving the earth
[2:57:39.160 --> 2:57:41.160]  Saving the Bill of Rights
[2:57:41.160 --> 2:57:43.160]  Saving the Constitution
[2:57:43.160 --> 2:57:46.160]  And South Park last week did a piece making fun of it
[2:57:46.160 --> 2:57:48.160]  And they're not even exaggerating
[2:57:48.160 --> 2:57:51.160]  I mean it's people just saying all my problems are solved
[2:57:51.160 --> 2:57:54.160]  Barack Obama is God
[2:57:54.160 --> 2:57:56.160]  I want to show one of these on the document cam now
[2:57:56.160 --> 2:57:59.160]  We'll show more later
[2:57:59.160 --> 2:58:01.160]  And I literally dug around for about three minutes
[2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:03.160]  This is just everywhere
[2:58:03.160 --> 2:58:04.160]  I'm sure you're seeing this
[2:58:04.160 --> 2:58:07.160]  In fact mail them into me at the mailing address on the website

[2:58:09.160 --> 2:58:13.160]  Just showing all the magazine articles and editorials where he's God
[2:58:13.160 --> 2:58:16.160]  If you look at this shot
[2:58:16.160 --> 2:58:20.160]  It's on the document cam at prisonplanet.tv
[2:58:20.160 --> 2:58:23.160]  This is out of Newsweek Magazine
[2:58:23.160 --> 2:58:26.160]  There he is putting the Constitution with all these little pieces of tape
[2:58:26.160 --> 2:58:29.160]  And he's putting the last piece in dutifully
[2:58:29.160 --> 2:58:31.160]  He's got his tape
[2:58:31.160 --> 2:58:34.160]  Oh he's in the Oval Office in day one
[2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:36.160]  He's putting it back together
[2:58:36.160 --> 2:58:39.160]  Folks this guy wants compulsory national service
[2:58:39.160 --> 2:58:40.160]  Gun control
[2:58:40.160 --> 2:58:41.160]  Disarming you
[2:58:41.160 --> 2:58:46.160]  That's ripping huge pieces out of the Constitution
[2:58:46.160 --> 2:58:49.160]  I mean how much of this do we have to put up with
[2:58:49.160 --> 2:58:52.160]  How much crap do we have to put up with
[2:58:52.160 --> 2:58:55.160]  Well I'm going to be exposing Mr. Obama
[2:58:55.160 --> 2:58:58.160]  Not that he runs anything but as the front man
[2:58:58.160 --> 2:59:00.160]  How much they can get through on their agenda
[2:59:00.160 --> 2:59:06.160]  I mean I would love to
[2:59:06.160 --> 2:59:09.160]  I would love to be able to like Barack Obama
[2:59:09.160 --> 2:59:12.160]  But you know I'm sorry I would have loved to have been able to like George Bush
[2:59:12.160 --> 2:59:16.160]  But I'm about policies and what they actually do versus rhetoric
[2:59:16.160 --> 2:59:18.160]  So there is your savior ladies and gentlemen
[2:59:18.160 --> 2:59:21.160]  We'll be going over that later in the hour
[2:59:21.160 --> 2:59:24.160]  Right now let's go ahead and go back to your calls
[2:59:24.160 --> 2:59:27.160]  Pull my call list up here
[2:59:27.160 --> 2:59:31.160]  Let's talk to Brandon in New York, you're on the air Brandon
[2:59:31.160 --> 2:59:33.160]  Hey Alex how you doing today
[2:59:33.160 --> 2:59:34.160]  Pretty good
[2:59:34.160 --> 2:59:36.160]  Thank you, thank you for having me on your show
[2:59:36.160 --> 2:59:39.160]  I have been listening to you for quite some time now
[2:59:39.160 --> 2:59:42.160]  And I would also like to thank you for opening my mind sir
[2:59:42.160 --> 2:59:47.160]  People like you that are actually doing greatness for the people in the United States
[2:59:47.160 --> 2:59:50.160]  Unlike the scumbag elites that are trying to control us
[2:59:50.160 --> 2:59:54.160]  I'm actually talking to you today because I'm up here in New York
[2:59:54.160 --> 2:59:58.160]  At what is dubbed by the common people as Mission Control
[2:59:58.160 --> 3:00:02.160]  We're a hub that basically monitors the internet
[3:00:02.160 --> 3:00:06.160]  And I found an article today that I think you would be really interested in
[3:00:06.160 --> 3:00:08.160]  It's in the Los Angeles Times
[3:00:08.160 --> 3:00:12.160]  And it's basically showing how there are different corporations
[3:00:12.160 --> 3:00:16.160]  Such as AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner, Fairpoint
[3:00:16.160 --> 3:00:20.160]  And what they're doing is they're actually putting a cap on the internet
[3:00:20.160 --> 3:00:25.160]  And how much information you can actually bring into and from your ISPs
[3:00:25.160 --> 3:00:28.160]  Yeah, no, that's getting rid of net neutrality
[3:00:28.160 --> 3:00:31.160]  They're also going to restrict the number of sites you can visit
[3:00:31.160 --> 3:00:34.160]  And people are emailing me saying I'm conspiracy theory
[3:00:34.160 --> 3:00:37.160]  When it's admitted by them and governments are saying
[3:00:37.160 --> 3:00:41.160]  They're encouraging ISPs and providers like Comcast and others
[3:00:41.160 --> 3:00:44.160]  And Time Warner to now shut people off
[3:00:44.160 --> 3:00:46.160]  I mean it's already happening
[3:00:46.160 --> 3:00:47.160]  It is
[3:00:47.160 --> 3:00:52.160]  And there's side block proxies, there's side VIN proxies for reporting servers
[3:00:52.160 --> 3:00:54.160]  Log analyze servers
[3:00:54.160 --> 3:00:57.160]  I mean the general public should know anytime you're on the internet
[3:00:57.160 --> 3:00:59.160]  All those things are being recorded
[3:00:59.160 --> 3:01:04.160]  Don't think that your ISP provider isn't looking into all the information that you're looking up
[3:01:04.160 --> 3:01:07.160]  And also don't think that by them not putting a cap on it
[3:01:07.160 --> 3:01:11.160]  That, you know, if I sit here and listen to Mr. L.H. Jones' show every day
[3:01:11.160 --> 3:01:14.160]  They'd eat up 5 gigs of my internet cap
[3:01:14.160 --> 3:01:18.160]  If they closed on my cap, does that mean I'm not going to get to listen to those shows?
[3:01:18.160 --> 3:01:21.160]  And if I have actually gone over that cap
[3:01:21.160 --> 3:01:25.160]  It says right here in the report that the ISP will completely cut my connection off
[3:01:25.160 --> 3:01:27.160]  And let's be specific
[3:01:27.160 --> 3:01:29.160]  You signed up and are paying for that
[3:01:29.160 --> 3:01:32.160]  And then I'm paying to stream it to you
[3:01:32.160 --> 3:01:34.160]  They're just hijacking the web
[3:01:34.160 --> 3:01:38.160]  Just like they're hijacking our entire banking system
[3:01:38.160 --> 3:01:43.160]  Right now and literally feeding the treasury and all of our currency
[3:01:43.160 --> 3:01:46.160]  And our tax money directly into themselves
[3:01:46.160 --> 3:01:48.160]  I mean folks, they're going for broke
[3:01:48.160 --> 3:01:50.160]  They're taking it all down right now
[3:01:50.160 --> 3:02:19.160]  Stay there
[3:02:21.160 --> 3:02:24.160]  This money now owns the American and European banks
[3:02:24.160 --> 3:02:27.160]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[3:02:27.160 --> 3:02:29.160]  Will slash your life savings to nothing
[3:02:29.160 --> 3:02:31.160]  And blast the cost of necessities
[3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:34.160]  Particularly food beyond many Americans' reach
[3:02:34.160 --> 3:02:36.160]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation
[3:02:36.160 --> 3:02:39.160]  The cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[3:02:39.160 --> 3:02:41.160]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks
[3:02:41.160 --> 3:02:43.160]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast
[3:02:43.160 --> 3:02:45.160]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight
[3:02:45.160 --> 3:02:48.160]  The private banks, merging with our government
[3:02:48.160 --> 3:02:51.160]  Are using the loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves
[3:02:51.160 --> 3:02:54.160]  The stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business
[3:02:54.160 --> 3:02:57.160]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready
[3:02:57.160 --> 3:02:59.160]  Everything is zeroing in on food
[3:02:59.160 --> 3:03:02.160]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food
[3:03:02.160 --> 3:03:04.160]  And paying for other necessities
[3:03:04.160 --> 3:03:06.160]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared
[3:03:06.160 --> 3:03:08.160]  Get self-sufficient, get food
[3:03:08.160 --> 3:03:11.160]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand
[3:03:11.160 --> 3:03:13.160]  That by having a supply of storable food, the government
[3:03:13.160 --> 3:03:15.160]  The new old order has a lot less control over you
[3:03:15.160 --> 3:03:19.160]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[3:03:19.160 --> 3:03:22.160]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[3:03:22.160 --> 3:03:25.160]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food
[3:03:25.160 --> 3:03:29.160]  That's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports
[3:03:29.160 --> 3:03:32.160]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices
[3:03:32.160 --> 3:03:35.160]  Call 1-800-409-5633
[3:03:35.160 --> 3:03:37.160]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com
[3:03:37.160 --> 3:03:40.160]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the final list
[3:03:40.160 --> 3:03:44.160]  Of high quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer
[3:03:44.160 --> 3:03:47.160]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog
[3:03:47.160 --> 3:03:50.160]  Or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633
[3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:53.160]  Again, 800-409-5633
[3:03:53.160 --> 3:03:55.160]  Or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com
[3:03:55.160 --> 3:03:59.160]  Take action today, the first step is getting storable food
[3:04:04.160 --> 3:04:08.160]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups
[3:04:08.160 --> 3:04:10.160]  You want answers?
[3:04:10.160 --> 3:04:15.160]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[3:04:15.160 --> 3:04:20.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[3:04:22.160 --> 3:04:26.160]  We are back live and we were talking to one of the callers
[3:04:28.160 --> 3:04:35.160]  Who was discussing the fact that his ISP is restricting the amount of downloads
[3:04:35.160 --> 3:04:38.160]  The amount of data he can take onto his computer
[3:04:38.160 --> 3:04:42.160]  And again, these are pitiful amounts of bandwidth
[3:04:42.160 --> 3:04:46.160]  His subscription way more than pays for it
[3:04:46.160 --> 3:04:50.160]  But in most towns, even big cities, you'll have two or three providers
[3:04:50.160 --> 3:04:54.160]  You can go through for fast downloads, for fast connections
[3:04:54.160 --> 3:04:57.160]  You can get your DSL, the phone company, your cable modem
[3:04:57.160 --> 3:05:00.160]  Maybe another choice
[3:05:00.160 --> 3:05:04.160]  But it's really three or four companies all over North America
[3:05:04.160 --> 3:05:06.160]  Three or four in Europe
[3:05:06.160 --> 3:05:08.160]  And they're all getting together and saying
[3:05:08.160 --> 3:05:10.160]  We're not going to let you visit most websites
[3:05:10.160 --> 3:05:12.160]  We're not going to let you download that much material
[3:05:12.160 --> 3:05:14.160]  We're going to track what you do
[3:05:14.160 --> 3:05:17.160]  Take Austin, Texas, when you type in a wrong website now
[3:05:17.160 --> 3:05:19.160]  You don't get a computer error on your computer
[3:05:19.160 --> 3:05:23.160]  You get a computer error on the Time Warner server
[3:05:23.160 --> 3:05:25.160]  And they log everything you do, they track everything you do
[3:05:25.160 --> 3:05:28.160]  The government's plugged right in, they watch it all
[3:05:28.160 --> 3:05:30.160]  Your digital cable box watches everything you watch
[3:05:30.160 --> 3:05:34.160]  Creates a record of that for psychological makeup
[3:05:34.160 --> 3:05:36.160]  And then they argue with you and say
[3:05:36.160 --> 3:05:38.160]  We're not listening to any of your phone calls
[3:05:38.160 --> 3:05:40.160]  And of course it turns out they're listening to everything
[3:05:40.160 --> 3:05:42.160]  And it's criminal what they're doing
[3:05:42.160 --> 3:05:44.160]  But they just don't care
[3:05:44.160 --> 3:05:46.160]  Anything else, Brandon from New York?
[3:05:46.160 --> 3:05:49.160]  I would just like these elite scumbags to know
[3:05:49.160 --> 3:05:53.160]  That there's a coalition of elite hackers out there in this world
[3:05:53.160 --> 3:05:57.160]  That aren't sensitized, that are about the freedom
[3:05:57.160 --> 3:06:01.160]  Of information and everything that's going on in this world
[3:06:01.160 --> 3:06:04.160]  We know all about your site proxy program
[3:06:04.160 --> 3:06:07.160]  We're just waiting to drop our viruses into your servers
[3:06:07.160 --> 3:06:11.160]  And destroy all that information right from the get-go
[3:06:11.160 --> 3:06:14.160]  So we can open the internet back up to where it should have been
[3:06:14.160 --> 3:06:18.160]  Not paid for, free, by the people
[3:06:18.160 --> 3:06:21.160]  For all the information and everybody to get
[3:06:21.160 --> 3:06:23.160]  Just like it was in the beginning
[3:06:23.160 --> 3:06:26.160]  And now they're Silicon Valley insiders
[3:06:26.160 --> 3:06:28.160]  That are out there working for us
[3:06:28.160 --> 3:06:30.160]  And not against us
[3:06:30.160 --> 3:06:33.160]  Well, that's right, as the tyranny gets worse and worse
[3:06:33.160 --> 3:06:36.160]  As the people find out what's really happened
[3:06:36.160 --> 3:06:38.160]  I mean, did you hear the poor guy in the first hour?
[3:06:38.160 --> 3:06:40.160]  And I believe him, he was going to send it all to me
[3:06:40.160 --> 3:06:42.160]  He wanted to get a clerical job at the FBI
[3:06:42.160 --> 3:06:44.160]  And they said, okay, we're going to hire you
[3:06:44.160 --> 3:06:47.160]  And then they came and said, oh, sorry, we did more research on you
[3:06:47.160 --> 3:06:49.160]  You visit Alex Jones' website
[3:06:49.160 --> 3:06:52.160]  And the guy's like, well, how do you know this?
[3:06:52.160 --> 3:06:55.160]  Well, it's just amazing
[3:06:55.160 --> 3:07:00.160]  I had years ago a lawyer involved
[3:07:00.160 --> 3:07:03.160]  Exposing a bunch of corruption in Arkansas
[3:07:03.160 --> 3:07:05.160]  Dealing with Bill Clinton murders
[3:07:05.160 --> 3:07:09.160]  From way back then and then tied into Oklahoma City
[3:07:09.160 --> 3:07:11.160]  And then when he was in a lawsuit with the Feds
[3:07:11.160 --> 3:07:16.160]  There were his emails to me like a decade ago
[3:07:16.160 --> 3:07:19.160]  In the file because it was all being grabbed
[3:07:19.160 --> 3:07:23.160]  I mean, folks, they just explained to people though
[3:07:23.160 --> 3:07:24.160]  What they're setting up and what they're doing
[3:07:24.160 --> 3:07:26.160]  See, that's why the web's slowing down
[3:07:26.160 --> 3:07:30.160]  They're placing all their hubs, all their snoopers
[3:07:30.160 --> 3:07:33.160]  In front of it, so you've got to go through their switchers
[3:07:33.160 --> 3:07:34.160]  You want to explain that to them?
[3:07:34.160 --> 3:07:37.160]  Yeah, basically what happened is
[3:07:37.160 --> 3:07:41.160]  When Microsoft took over corporation, okay
[3:07:41.160 --> 3:07:43.160]  They started designing computers
[3:07:43.160 --> 3:07:47.160]  So that you had access to the internet through a phone line, okay
[3:07:47.160 --> 3:07:49.160]  And that's how the internet started out
[3:07:49.160 --> 3:07:53.160]  Well, as everything came along and technology progressed
[3:07:53.160 --> 3:07:55.160]  They started taking out these little things
[3:07:55.160 --> 3:07:58.160]  Like your DOS running programs in your computer
[3:07:58.160 --> 3:08:01.160]  Or your hyperlink terminals in your computer
[3:08:01.160 --> 3:08:03.160]  Because phone lines were obsolete
[3:08:03.160 --> 3:08:05.160]  And the reason that they were doing that
[3:08:05.160 --> 3:08:08.160]  Was because they had no monitoring system
[3:08:08.160 --> 3:08:10.160]  Through a phone line or a DSL
[3:08:10.160 --> 3:08:13.160]  It was tracked just like back in the early 90s
[3:08:13.160 --> 3:08:16.160]  When people used to do things like phone freaking
[3:08:16.160 --> 3:08:18.160]  And call for free, long distance
[3:08:18.160 --> 3:08:20.160]  And when the government figured out
[3:08:20.160 --> 3:08:22.160]  That we could still get our information
[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:24.160]  And it couldn't be monitored
[3:08:24.160 --> 3:08:26.160]  They automatically switched everything over
[3:08:26.160 --> 3:08:29.160]  Into an ISP protected network
[3:08:29.160 --> 3:08:32.160]  And when that happened, they started raking you
[3:08:32.160 --> 3:08:34.160]  Of your information from the get-go
[3:08:34.160 --> 3:08:36.160]  And I would say that was probably somewhere
[3:08:36.160 --> 3:08:40.160]  In the midst of 97 until current
[3:08:40.160 --> 3:08:42.160]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:44.160]  And they've got complete files on everybody
[3:08:44.160 --> 3:08:46.160]  Now don't let that intimidate you
[3:08:46.160 --> 3:08:49.160]  They're the crooks, they're the dirty peeping toms
[3:08:49.160 --> 3:08:52.160]  Watching what you do, looking at what you do
[3:08:52.160 --> 3:08:54.160]  In your bank accounts
[3:08:54.160 --> 3:08:58.160]  They're the bad guys, they are the criminals
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:00.160]  It's just disgusting
[3:09:00.160 --> 3:09:03.160]  You know, I would just like to let the American public
[3:09:03.160 --> 3:09:05.160]  Know one thing
[3:09:05.160 --> 3:09:07.160]  These people on the internet
[3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:10.160]  They get blasted as hackers
[3:09:10.160 --> 3:09:12.160]  That are, you know, you see them crack
[3:09:12.160 --> 3:09:15.160]  An IDF security database
[3:09:15.160 --> 3:09:17.160]  And other such things
[3:09:17.160 --> 3:09:19.160]  The American people need to know that
[3:09:19.160 --> 3:09:21.160]  These people are fighting for you
[3:09:21.160 --> 3:09:23.160]  And your freedom
[3:09:23.160 --> 3:09:26.160]  We're not the scumbag elite
[3:09:26.160 --> 3:09:28.160]  We're trying to keep the information
[3:09:28.160 --> 3:09:30.160]  Highways free so that you people
[3:09:30.160 --> 3:09:32.160]  Can get this information
[3:09:32.160 --> 3:09:35.160]  See, the general code of hacker elite
[3:09:35.160 --> 3:09:38.160]  Usually work as we won't do anything
[3:09:38.160 --> 3:09:41.160]  Unless there's a probable cause for it
[3:09:41.160 --> 3:09:43.160]  Well, now the government's giving us
[3:09:43.160 --> 3:09:45.160]  A probable cause to defend ourselves
[3:09:45.160 --> 3:09:47.160]  Well, we wouldn't have the internet today
[3:09:47.160 --> 3:09:49.160]  If it wasn't for the hackers defending it
[3:09:49.160 --> 3:09:51.160]  For the last 20 years
[3:09:51.160 --> 3:09:53.160]  We know a lot of the bad hacking
[3:09:53.160 --> 3:09:55.160]  That we've seen has led right back to
[3:09:55.160 --> 3:09:57.160]  The feds provocaturing
[3:09:57.160 --> 3:09:59.160]  Every time they want to restrict free speech
[3:09:59.160 --> 3:10:01.160]  Or pass a hate law
[3:10:01.160 --> 3:10:03.160]  We've caught them putting child porn out
[3:10:03.160 --> 3:10:05.160]  Putting Nazi stuff out, you know, going in hacks
[3:10:05.160 --> 3:10:08.160]  Anything tied to the U.S. Department of Justice
[3:10:08.160 --> 3:10:10.160]  Homeland security
[3:10:10.160 --> 3:10:12.160]  Any sort of the military branches
[3:10:12.160 --> 3:10:14.160]  Air force, Navy, anything
[3:10:14.160 --> 3:10:16.160]  That's right
[3:10:16.160 --> 3:10:19.160]  And it's staged just as much as Barack Obama's staged
[3:10:19.160 --> 3:10:22.160]  You know, Alex, I would like to make a statement here
[3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:25.160]  And say, if there was a messiah in our world
[3:10:25.160 --> 3:10:27.160]  I would have to say it's you
[3:10:27.160 --> 3:10:31.160]  Everything that we need to know
[3:10:31.160 --> 3:10:35.160]  Instead of the crap that's being filtered through TV
[3:10:35.160 --> 3:10:37.160]  That everybody eats up
[3:10:37.160 --> 3:10:39.160]  It makes me absolutely disgusting
[3:10:39.160 --> 3:10:43.160]  To look at the TV and see the one
[3:10:43.160 --> 3:10:46.160]  No person that's an elected official
[3:10:46.160 --> 3:10:48.160]  In the country of the United States
[3:10:48.160 --> 3:10:51.160]  Should be promoted as Jesus Christ
[3:10:51.160 --> 3:10:54.160]  And that scares me
[3:10:54.160 --> 3:10:56.160]  I hear you, my friend
[3:10:56.160 --> 3:10:57.160]  Good to hear from you
[3:10:57.160 --> 3:10:59.160]  Call back again, Brandon
[3:10:59.160 --> 3:11:01.160]  I want to get to Scott Arthur Vicki Aaron
[3:11:01.160 --> 3:11:03.160]  Because these calls are all so interesting
[3:11:03.160 --> 3:11:04.160]  You want to hear the next one
[3:11:04.160 --> 3:11:05.160]  And if you go too long
[3:11:05.160 --> 3:11:06.160]  You don't get to hear the next one
[3:11:06.160 --> 3:11:08.160]  But then you don't get to spend enough time
[3:11:08.160 --> 3:11:09.160]  With the last person
[3:11:09.160 --> 3:11:11.160]  In fact, I had so many points I wanted to make
[3:11:11.160 --> 3:11:13.160]  And then he said that thing about me
[3:11:13.160 --> 3:11:15.160]  And it made me laugh and I forgot them
[3:11:18.160 --> 3:11:20.160]  The elites are ruthless
[3:11:20.160 --> 3:11:23.160]  They're hurting us really, really bad right now
[3:11:23.160 --> 3:11:25.160]  But they can't carry out their crimes
[3:11:25.160 --> 3:11:27.160]  And have a free internet
[3:11:27.160 --> 3:11:29.160]  So that's why they're trying to shut it down right now
[3:11:29.160 --> 3:11:31.160]  And they are
[3:11:31.160 --> 3:11:33.160]  And that's why, folks
[3:11:33.160 --> 3:11:35.160]  You should take the fact that you can see
[3:11:35.160 --> 3:11:37.160]  Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement
[3:11:37.160 --> 3:11:39.160]  Online for free
[3:11:39.160 --> 3:11:41.160]  Is something really valuable
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:45.160]  You should take the fact that you can see Terror Storm
[3:11:45.160 --> 3:11:47.160]  Or Loose Change Final Cut for free
[3:11:49.160 --> 3:11:51.160]  They don't want that to happen for long
[3:11:51.160 --> 3:11:53.160]  They've sponged it off of a lot of different servers and sites
[3:11:55.160 --> 3:11:57.160]  I'm so busy covering the news
[3:11:57.160 --> 3:11:59.160]  And things that I don't even really get into my films
[3:11:59.160 --> 3:12:01.160]  But that's really a big part of the solution
[3:12:01.160 --> 3:12:03.160]  And we may have to go back
[3:12:03.160 --> 3:12:05.160]  To hand to hand
[3:12:05.160 --> 3:12:07.160]  Giving people videos and books and things
[3:12:07.160 --> 3:12:09.160]  As our only means
[3:12:09.160 --> 3:12:11.160]  Because the establishment is moving in
[3:12:11.160 --> 3:12:13.160]  To try to block our free speech
[3:12:13.160 --> 3:12:15.160]  But
[3:12:15.160 --> 3:12:17.160]  The point I wanted to make is
[3:12:17.160 --> 3:12:19.160]  We've caught the government many times
[3:12:19.160 --> 3:12:21.160]  Doing the hacks
[3:12:21.160 --> 3:12:23.160]  Doing the malicious things
[3:12:23.160 --> 3:12:25.160]  Hacking hospitals and saying
[3:12:25.160 --> 3:12:27.160]  Oh, the hacker tried to turn off the power
[3:12:27.160 --> 3:12:29.160]  At the hospital
[3:12:29.160 --> 3:12:31.160]  So the old people would die
[3:12:31.160 --> 3:12:33.160]  Folks
[3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:35.160]  99% of the time that's government
[3:12:35.160 --> 3:12:37.160]  I mean, is there some mentally ill person out there
[3:12:37.160 --> 3:12:39.160]  That would try something like that?
[3:12:39.160 --> 3:12:41.160]  Oh, absolutely
[3:12:41.160 --> 3:12:43.160]  Absolutely
[3:12:43.160 --> 3:12:45.160]  But every time we track it back, it's the cops
[3:12:45.160 --> 3:12:47.160]  I mean, I remember we're pulling into Denver
[3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:49.160]  I'm talking to We Are Change
[3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:51.160]  And 9-11 Truth Activists and they said
[3:12:51.160 --> 3:12:53.160]  These guys were cops
[3:12:53.160 --> 3:12:55.160]  They were pushing people, they were hitting people
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:12:57.160]  They started a fight
[3:12:57.160 --> 3:12:59.160]  And then we got there and we witnessed people
[3:12:59.160 --> 3:13:01.160]  That were clearly cops stirring stuff up
[3:13:01.160 --> 3:13:03.160]  And I went on air and said
[3:13:03.160 --> 3:13:05.160]  We witnessed us saw Marines
[3:13:05.160 --> 3:13:07.160]  Causing a riot one night
[3:13:07.160 --> 3:13:09.160]  Dressed up like anarchists
[3:13:09.160 --> 3:13:11.160]  But getting out of white vans
[3:13:11.160 --> 3:13:13.160]  Marked U.S. government
[3:13:13.160 --> 3:13:15.160]  It's now in the Denver Post
[3:13:15.160 --> 3:13:17.160]  We've got to make this a big story
[3:13:17.160 --> 3:13:19.160]  That
[3:13:19.160 --> 3:13:21.160]  That
[3:13:21.160 --> 3:13:23.160]  They just admit the cops go
[3:13:23.160 --> 3:13:25.160]  Yeah, we had officers out there
[3:13:25.160 --> 3:13:27.160]  Dressed up like protesters
[3:13:27.160 --> 3:13:33.160]  And we had them attack police
[3:13:43.160 --> 3:13:45.160]  I mean, let that sink in out there folks
[3:13:45.160 --> 3:13:47.160]  I'm not here bashing the police
[3:13:47.160 --> 3:13:49.160]  I want the police on our side
[3:13:49.160 --> 3:13:51.160]  I want them to say no to all this
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:53.160]  But I happen to know
[3:13:53.160 --> 3:13:55.160]  The feds bombed the World Trade Center
[3:13:55.160 --> 3:13:57.160]  The first time
[3:13:57.160 --> 3:13:59.160]  I mean, that's even publicly admitted
[3:13:59.160 --> 3:14:01.160]  They cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, gave them the detonators
[3:14:01.160 --> 3:14:03.160]  You know, they found two nuts to do it
[3:14:03.160 --> 3:14:05.160]  But it was their idea, they created it
[3:14:05.160 --> 3:14:07.160]  They got the informants
[3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:09.160]  They went out and organized and led the attack
[3:14:17.160 --> 3:14:19.160]  So, what am I supposed to do
[3:14:19.160 --> 3:14:21.160]  Just ignore that
[3:14:21.160 --> 3:14:23.160]  And the feds bombed Oklahoma City
[3:14:23.160 --> 3:14:25.160]  They just outright bombed it themselves
[3:14:25.160 --> 3:14:27.160]  BATF did
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:29.160]  And then the feds
[3:14:29.160 --> 3:14:31.160]  Did 9-11
[3:14:31.160 --> 3:14:33.160]  And it's in the Army field manuals
[3:14:33.160 --> 3:14:35.160]  It's in two of them
[3:14:35.160 --> 3:14:37.160]  One of them just got declassified
[3:14:39.160 --> 3:14:41.160]  And every time I mention this
[3:14:41.160 --> 3:14:43.160]  People don't believe me and then go pull it up themselves
[3:14:43.160 --> 3:14:45.160]  And it talks about false flag, torture
[3:14:45.160 --> 3:14:47.160]  Staging terror attacks
[3:14:47.160 --> 3:14:49.160]  I mean, the Army field manual
[3:14:49.160 --> 3:14:51.160]  For captains and above
[3:14:55.160 --> 3:14:57.160]  Tells them how to stage terror attacks
[3:14:57.160 --> 3:14:59.160]  I mean, it's in the manual
[3:15:03.160 --> 3:15:05.160]  I'm sick of it
[3:15:05.160 --> 3:15:07.160]  I mean, do listeners think I'm having fun
[3:15:09.160 --> 3:15:11.160]  Going up against these people
[3:15:11.160 --> 3:15:13.160]  No, I'm not stupid
[3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:15.160]  I mean, you think I like getting up here on air
[3:15:15.160 --> 3:15:19.160]  That I enjoy standing up to these people?
[3:15:21.160 --> 3:15:23.160]  Believe me, folks, I'm a big fish
[3:15:23.160 --> 3:15:25.160]  It's the only reason I'm not in prison or dead
[3:15:25.160 --> 3:15:27.160]  And they may just say, you know, we don't care and kill me anyways
[3:15:27.160 --> 3:15:29.160]  Because they don't care now, folks
[3:15:29.160 --> 3:15:31.160]  They're taking all the money out of the banks
[3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:33.160]  They're stealing everything
[3:15:33.160 --> 3:15:35.160]  They're restricting free speech
[3:15:35.160 --> 3:15:37.160]  They got local cops in Minnesota and Denver
[3:15:37.160 --> 3:15:39.160]  Ready to follow federal orders
[3:15:39.160 --> 3:15:41.160]  To go out and attack other cops
[3:15:41.160 --> 3:15:43.160]  To blame it on the American people
[3:15:43.160 --> 3:15:45.160]  I mean, that the system is broken
[3:15:47.160 --> 3:15:49.160]  And it comes out in the newspaper and nobody gets in trouble
[3:15:49.160 --> 3:15:51.160]  I'm going to skip this break
[3:15:51.160 --> 3:15:53.160]  Because I'm so far behind
[3:15:53.160 --> 3:15:55.160]  I want to continue with your phone calls
[3:15:55.160 --> 3:15:57.160]  So here we go
[3:15:57.160 --> 3:15:59.160]  For folks on prisonplanet.tv
[3:15:59.160 --> 3:16:01.160]  Of the three million
[3:16:01.160 --> 3:16:03.160]  Scott in Oregon, you're on the air
[3:16:03.160 --> 3:16:05.160]  Welcome
[3:16:05.160 --> 3:16:07.160]  You're feeling better
[3:16:07.160 --> 3:16:09.160]  I've been hitting the cough button quite a bit here
[3:16:09.160 --> 3:16:11.160]  Those long pauses, but thank you
[3:16:11.160 --> 3:16:13.160]  I'm calling from Central Oregon
[3:16:13.160 --> 3:16:15.160]  And I'm calling to give a report
[3:16:15.160 --> 3:16:17.160]  And plus two questions for you
[3:16:17.160 --> 3:16:19.160]  One report is I've been making
[3:16:19.160 --> 3:16:21.160]  Contact with my emergency management crew
[3:16:21.160 --> 3:16:23.160]  Here in New Oregon
[3:16:23.160 --> 3:16:25.160]  I've been contacting the state and local police
[3:16:25.160 --> 3:16:27.160]  I have two National Guard
[3:16:27.160 --> 3:16:29.160]  Stations here
[3:16:29.160 --> 3:16:31.160]  In my Central Oregon area
[3:16:31.160 --> 3:16:33.160]  I went to the
[3:16:33.160 --> 3:16:35.160]  Administration of the National Guard
[3:16:35.160 --> 3:16:37.160]  Here and I asked the CO there
[3:16:37.160 --> 3:16:39.160]  Do you know anything
[3:16:39.160 --> 3:16:41.160]  About the upcoming
[3:16:41.160 --> 3:16:43.160]  Marshall law, Rex 84
[3:16:43.160 --> 3:16:45.160]  Operation garden plot and cable splicer
[3:16:45.160 --> 3:16:47.160]  Can you believe
[3:16:47.160 --> 3:16:49.160]  All these agencies
[3:16:49.160 --> 3:16:51.160]  They all acted stupid
[3:16:51.160 --> 3:16:53.160]  Like I was crazy, okay
[3:16:53.160 --> 3:16:55.160]  Then I go down to the
[3:16:55.160 --> 3:16:57.160]  Training facility
[3:16:57.160 --> 3:16:59.160]  Here for a National Guard
[3:16:59.160 --> 3:17:01.160]  And I walked right into the barracks
[3:17:01.160 --> 3:17:03.160]  And I walked right up to the CO's desk
[3:17:03.160 --> 3:17:05.160]  And I talked to him for a minute
[3:17:05.160 --> 3:17:07.160]  And he acted stupid
[3:17:07.160 --> 3:17:09.160]  And then I told him I was proud
[3:17:09.160 --> 3:17:11.160]  To be a Red Lister
[3:17:11.160 --> 3:17:13.160]  And he jokingly
[3:17:13.160 --> 3:17:15.160]  Laughed and said
[3:17:15.160 --> 3:17:17.160]  If you're a Red Lister, I will shoot you
[3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:21.160]  Oh no, it's all about their personal power
[3:17:21.160 --> 3:17:23.160]  See, they're looking forward
[3:17:23.160 --> 3:17:25.160]  They're looking forward to it like it's deer hunting
[3:17:25.160 --> 3:17:27.160]  They want to ride around with miniguns
[3:17:27.160 --> 3:17:29.160]  In the backs of trucks laughing
[3:17:29.160 --> 3:17:31.160]  Like they did in Iraq just shooting us off the road
[3:17:31.160 --> 3:17:33.160]  There'll be lots of families out with flags waving it
[3:17:33.160 --> 3:17:35.160]  They're fighting the domestic
[3:17:35.160 --> 3:17:37.160]  Quad Al-Qaeda
[3:17:37.160 --> 3:17:39.160]  Get them, let the bankers have all our money
[3:17:39.160 --> 3:17:41.160]  Yeah
[3:17:41.160 --> 3:17:43.160]  And he tried to deny it
[3:17:43.160 --> 3:17:45.160]  And tried to act stupid
[3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:47.160]  And then at the end of it I said
[3:17:47.160 --> 3:17:49.160]  I'm going to be a Red Lister
[3:17:49.160 --> 3:17:51.160]  He goes, well, laughingly trying to make a joke of it
[3:17:51.160 --> 3:17:53.160]  If you're a Red Lister, I'll have to shoot you
[3:17:53.160 --> 3:17:55.160]  You know, so
[3:17:55.160 --> 3:17:57.160]  Anyway, after I made
[3:17:57.160 --> 3:17:59.160]  And you hadn't mentioned anything about Red Lister
[3:17:59.160 --> 3:18:01.160]  Excuse me?
[3:18:01.160 --> 3:18:03.160]  You hadn't mentioned anything about Red Lister
[3:18:03.160 --> 3:18:05.160]  After he played stupid
[3:18:05.160 --> 3:18:07.160]  And I told him to Google right there
[3:18:07.160 --> 3:18:09.160]  I said, turn on your computer
[3:18:09.160 --> 3:18:11.160]  I said, clear off the screen
[3:18:11.160 --> 3:18:13.160]  And type in Red List Blue List
[3:18:13.160 --> 3:18:15.160]  And he looked at it for about two seconds
[3:18:15.160 --> 3:18:17.160]  And turned around as well
[3:18:17.160 --> 3:18:19.160]  If you're a Red Lister, I'm going to have to shoot you
[3:18:19.160 --> 3:18:21.160]  And then he laughed
[3:18:21.160 --> 3:18:23.160]  Of course, I didn't take that too kindly
[3:18:23.160 --> 3:18:25.160]  You know
[3:18:25.160 --> 3:18:27.160]  This was two weeks ago
[3:18:27.160 --> 3:18:29.160]  Now, after I've made my visits and my contacts
[3:18:29.160 --> 3:18:31.160]  With the emergency management
[3:18:31.160 --> 3:18:33.160]  And the National Guard
[3:18:33.160 --> 3:18:35.160]  The state and local police
[3:18:35.160 --> 3:18:37.160]  I immediately start getting phone calls
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:39.160]  From survey groups
[3:18:39.160 --> 3:18:41.160]  The Gallup polls
[3:18:41.160 --> 3:18:43.160]  People trying to take polls and ask me questions
[3:18:43.160 --> 3:18:45.160]  And their questions were so sensitive
[3:18:45.160 --> 3:18:47.160]  That it was just
[3:18:47.160 --> 3:18:49.160]  It was insane
[3:18:49.160 --> 3:18:51.160]  Pretty much how many people live in your house
[3:18:51.160 --> 3:18:53.160]  How strong are you
[3:18:53.160 --> 3:18:55.160]  Can you do physical this or that
[3:18:55.160 --> 3:18:57.160]  Or, you know, how much do you weigh
[3:18:57.160 --> 3:18:59.160]  How tall are you
[3:18:59.160 --> 3:19:01.160]  And to me, and I'm asking you this
[3:19:01.160 --> 3:19:03.160]  A question I believe and I feel
[3:19:03.160 --> 3:19:05.160]  With all my heart
[3:19:05.160 --> 3:19:07.160]  That this is all going into a database
[3:19:07.160 --> 3:19:09.160]  Of people getting polls
[3:19:09.160 --> 3:19:11.160]  That's calling their houses to ask them sensitive information
[3:19:11.160 --> 3:19:13.160]  That it's going into a database
[3:19:13.160 --> 3:19:15.160]  No, no, there's no doubt
[3:19:15.160 --> 3:19:17.160]  I mean, that's why one in five houses
[3:19:17.160 --> 3:19:19.160]  Gets the extended
[3:19:19.160 --> 3:19:21.160]  There's different variants of it
[3:19:21.160 --> 3:19:23.160]  The extended census
[3:19:23.160 --> 3:19:25.160]  Where it asks, you know, how many toilets
[3:19:25.160 --> 3:19:27.160]  How many guns you got
[3:19:27.160 --> 3:19:29.160]  Yes
[3:19:29.160 --> 3:19:31.160]  Yeah
[3:19:31.160 --> 3:19:33.160]  So it's all going
[3:19:33.160 --> 3:19:35.160]  In databases because
[3:19:35.160 --> 3:19:37.160]  The bankers that own our government
[3:19:37.160 --> 3:19:39.160]  Their business is controlling slaves
[3:19:39.160 --> 3:19:41.160]  Their business is managing us
[3:19:41.160 --> 3:19:43.160]  The slaves
[3:19:43.160 --> 3:19:45.160]  It is
[3:19:45.160 --> 3:19:47.160]  Not, you know, making or manufacturing anything
[3:19:47.160 --> 3:19:49.160]  And so everything they do
[3:19:49.160 --> 3:19:51.160]  Is about how to control us, how to dumb us down
[3:19:51.160 --> 3:19:53.160]  How to divide us
[3:19:53.160 --> 3:19:55.160]  Scott, I appreciate your call
[3:19:55.160 --> 3:19:57.160]  Here we go
[3:20:05.160 --> 3:20:07.160]  All right, I want to hurry through your calls
[3:20:07.160 --> 3:20:09.160]  Because I want to get into a bunch of news
[3:20:09.160 --> 3:20:11.160]  And the Barack Obama worship that I've been witnessing
[3:20:15.160 --> 3:20:17.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[3:20:17.160 --> 3:20:19.160]  Arthur in New Jersey
[3:20:19.160 --> 3:20:21.160]  Arthur, you're on the air
[3:20:21.160 --> 3:20:23.160]  Hi, I just wanted to
[3:20:23.160 --> 3:20:25.160]  See a new world order
[3:20:25.160 --> 3:20:27.160]  But I do not see a western controlled
[3:20:27.160 --> 3:20:29.160]  New world order
[3:20:29.160 --> 3:20:31.160]  If China and Japan dump their treasuries
[3:20:31.160 --> 3:20:33.160]  Tomorrow, the dollar would be completely worthless
[3:20:33.160 --> 3:20:35.160]  And the U.S. would essentially go into bankruptcy
[3:20:35.160 --> 3:20:37.160]  What I do see in the future is that
[3:20:37.160 --> 3:20:39.160]  You're going to have
[3:20:39.160 --> 3:20:41.160]  The U.S.
[3:20:41.160 --> 3:20:43.160]  Go bankrupting and have them
[3:20:43.160 --> 3:20:45.160]  These foreign countries that
[3:20:45.160 --> 3:20:47.160]  Have holdings
[3:20:47.160 --> 3:20:49.160]  In U.S. treasuries
[3:20:49.160 --> 3:20:51.160]  Essentially it's going to be a bankruptcy liquidation
[3:20:51.160 --> 3:20:53.160]  That's being sold out to these foreign countries
[3:20:55.160 --> 3:20:57.160]  Well, that's exactly
[3:20:57.160 --> 3:20:59.160]  That's exactly what the new world order is
[3:20:59.160 --> 3:21:01.160]  Except, hang on
[3:21:01.160 --> 3:21:03.160]  It's not the new world order
[3:21:03.160 --> 3:21:05.160]  To say
[3:21:05.160 --> 3:21:07.160]  Oswald Spengler wrote in The Cline of the West
[3:21:07.160 --> 3:21:09.160]  It's a great book
[3:21:09.160 --> 3:21:11.160]  That their
[3:21:11.160 --> 3:21:13.160]  Civilizations go in cycles
[3:21:13.160 --> 3:21:15.160]  And that
[3:21:15.160 --> 3:21:17.160]  Western civilization is currently in its winter
[3:21:17.160 --> 3:21:19.160]  Which means it's currently
[3:21:19.160 --> 3:21:21.160]  On its deathbed
[3:21:21.160 --> 3:21:23.160]  Essentially
[3:21:23.160 --> 3:21:25.160]  And that it will not be able to survive
[3:21:25.160 --> 3:21:27.160]  It's lost its culture
[3:21:27.160 --> 3:21:29.160]  It's lost its ideals
[3:21:29.160 --> 3:21:31.160]  Essentially it's a form of second religiousness
[3:21:31.160 --> 3:21:33.160]  Lost its original faith
[3:21:33.160 --> 3:21:35.160]  The western interpretation of Christianity
[3:21:35.160 --> 3:21:37.160]  And
[3:21:37.160 --> 3:21:39.160]  It's morally bankrupt
[3:21:39.160 --> 3:21:41.160]  And Spengler compared
[3:21:41.160 --> 3:21:43.160]  The western man
[3:21:43.160 --> 3:21:45.160]  He compared it to the Faustian man
[3:21:45.160 --> 3:21:47.160]  From Goeth's Faust
[3:21:47.160 --> 3:21:49.160]  The doing is they're selling out their soul
[3:21:49.160 --> 3:21:51.160]  For a few quick bucks
[3:21:51.160 --> 3:21:53.160]  But in reality what's going to happen
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:55.160]  Is that ramifications are just
[3:21:55.160 --> 3:21:57.160]  U.S. is going to
[3:21:57.160 --> 3:21:59.160]  Essentially collapse
[3:21:59.160 --> 3:22:01.160]  And it's not just the U.S.
[3:22:01.160 --> 3:22:03.160]  They're also other western European countries too
[3:22:03.160 --> 3:22:05.160]  And this includes Canada
[3:22:05.160 --> 3:22:07.160]  Actually you just saw Russia giving Iceland
[3:22:07.160 --> 3:22:09.160]  The bridge loan about a month ago
[3:22:09.160 --> 3:22:11.160]  And you're also seeing Russia giving
[3:22:11.160 --> 3:22:13.160]  Loans to Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba
[3:22:13.160 --> 3:22:15.160]  And
[3:22:15.160 --> 3:22:17.160]  There's no turning back
[3:22:17.160 --> 3:22:19.160]  Let me just stop you right there
[3:22:19.160 --> 3:22:21.160]  You know it's easy to sit here
[3:22:21.160 --> 3:22:23.160]  And say this is all just a cycle
[3:22:23.160 --> 3:22:25.160]  And there's not really a new world order
[3:22:25.160 --> 3:22:27.160]  I'm going off all the governmental documents
[3:22:27.160 --> 3:22:29.160]  They said they were going to engineer
[3:22:29.160 --> 3:22:31.160]  This economic collapse
[3:22:31.160 --> 3:22:33.160]  They said that they were going to morally
[3:22:33.160 --> 3:22:35.160]  Bankrupt us so we wouldn't stick together
[3:22:35.160 --> 3:22:37.160]  To make us more easily manageable slaves
[3:22:37.160 --> 3:22:39.160]  This is being done by design
[3:22:39.160 --> 3:22:41.160]  Here's Gordon Brown
[3:22:41.160 --> 3:22:43.160]  The London Telegraph today
[3:22:43.160 --> 3:22:45.160]  There's Gordon Brown right there
[3:22:45.160 --> 3:22:47.160]  Gordon Brown calls for a new world order
[3:22:47.160 --> 3:22:49.160]  To beat recession
[3:22:49.160 --> 3:22:51.160]  Again the bankers engineer the crisis
[3:22:51.160 --> 3:22:53.160]  And then they offer
[3:22:53.160 --> 3:22:55.160]  The solution
[3:22:55.160 --> 3:22:57.160]  Which is world government
[3:22:57.160 --> 3:22:59.160]  Run for and by the bankers
[3:22:59.160 --> 3:23:01.160]  And so that's what they're setting up
[3:23:01.160 --> 3:23:03.160]  It isn't like it's my opinion
[3:23:03.160 --> 3:23:05.160]  A long time beforehand
[3:23:05.160 --> 3:23:07.160]  We laid out what's going on
[3:23:07.160 --> 3:23:09.160]  So I appreciate your call Arthur
[3:23:09.160 --> 3:23:11.160]  Vicki in Ohio
[3:23:11.160 --> 3:23:13.160]  You're on the air welcome
[3:23:13.160 --> 3:23:15.160]  Hello?
[3:23:15.160 --> 3:23:17.160]  Yes
[3:23:17.160 --> 3:23:19.160]  I heard a big beep
[3:23:19.160 --> 3:23:21.160]  I didn't know if I got cut off
[3:23:21.160 --> 3:23:23.160]  Just to make you feel better about it
[3:23:23.160 --> 3:23:25.160]  Year after 9-11
[3:23:25.160 --> 3:23:27.160]  I started doing some research on the computer
[3:23:27.160 --> 3:23:29.160]  About why Islamic Christianity
[3:23:29.160 --> 3:23:31.160]  Would want to kill each other
[3:23:31.160 --> 3:23:33.160]  I ran into the conspiracy theorists
[3:23:33.160 --> 3:23:35.160]  North American
[3:23:35.160 --> 3:23:37.160]  And then I started looking
[3:23:37.160 --> 3:23:39.160]  What's going on in the news
[3:23:39.160 --> 3:23:41.160]  It's all coming true
[3:23:41.160 --> 3:23:43.160]  Now you've got my attention
[3:23:43.160 --> 3:23:45.160]  And I gave up on the political system years ago
[3:23:45.160 --> 3:23:47.160]  I just never put the pieces together
[3:23:47.160 --> 3:23:49.160]  I don't give a crap if they do anything anyway
[3:23:49.160 --> 3:23:51.160]  But I do have a few questions to make short
[3:23:51.160 --> 3:23:53.160]  And number one I am an evangelical Christian
[3:23:53.160 --> 3:23:55.160]  That knows the word of God is the Bible
[3:23:55.160 --> 3:23:57.160]  And not to criticize you
[3:23:57.160 --> 3:23:59.160]  I'm trying to get some of the heat off you
[3:23:59.160 --> 3:24:01.160]  There is a verse in his safiens
[3:24:01.160 --> 3:24:03.160]  Don't go along like a little sheep
[3:24:03.160 --> 3:24:05.160]  It's in the Bible
[3:24:05.160 --> 3:24:07.160]  Christians, if you don't let me check it out
[3:24:07.160 --> 3:24:09.160]  There is a part in the unfulfilled words of darkness
[3:24:09.160 --> 3:24:11.160]  But instead expose them
[3:24:11.160 --> 3:24:13.160]  You are right, they are wrong
[3:24:13.160 --> 3:24:15.160]  This is corrupt as hell
[3:24:15.160 --> 3:24:17.160]  Number one, you are doing the right thing
[3:24:17.160 --> 3:24:19.160]  I forget that
[3:24:19.160 --> 3:24:21.160]  What exact verse is that in Ephesians?
[3:24:21.160 --> 3:24:23.160]  In Ephesians
[3:24:23.160 --> 3:24:25.160]  I'm sorry, I'm so upset right now
[3:24:25.160 --> 3:24:27.160]  Because my head is about to explode
[3:24:27.160 --> 3:24:29.160]  5-11 says God command
[3:24:29.160 --> 3:24:31.160]  Take no part in the unfulfilled words of darkness
[3:24:31.160 --> 3:24:33.160]  Instead expose them
[3:24:33.160 --> 3:24:35.160]  God's law is love
[3:24:35.160 --> 3:24:37.160]  And if you love people
[3:24:37.160 --> 3:24:39.160]  God protects the weaker
[3:24:39.160 --> 3:24:41.160]  I don't give a damn who is doing it
[3:24:41.160 --> 3:24:43.160]  Your government or what
[3:24:43.160 --> 3:24:45.160]  Love protects the weaker
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:47.160]  Number two
[3:24:47.160 --> 3:24:49.160]  They think they are going to get raptured
[3:24:49.160 --> 3:24:51.160]  Out of here when the Antichrist comes
[3:24:51.160 --> 3:24:53.160]  Wrong story about theology
[3:24:53.160 --> 3:24:55.160]  The Bible, and I just want to get some heat off your back
[3:24:55.160 --> 3:24:57.160]  You are going to be here
[3:24:57.160 --> 3:24:59.160]  The Bible, God promises protection
[3:24:59.160 --> 3:25:01.160]  For his people
[3:25:01.160 --> 3:25:03.160]  From the plagues he will enforce
[3:25:03.160 --> 3:25:05.160]  If you are not here, you don't need that protection
[3:25:05.160 --> 3:25:07.160]  Baby, I hate to tell you people this
[3:25:07.160 --> 3:25:09.160]  I don't want you with your pants down
[3:25:09.160 --> 3:25:11.160]  If it comes down, your butts are going to be here
[3:25:11.160 --> 3:25:13.160]  You might as well wake up and just call the coffee
[3:25:13.160 --> 3:25:15.160]  God does not need to promise protection
[3:25:15.160 --> 3:25:17.160]  For people who are raptured out of here
[3:25:17.160 --> 3:25:19.160]  Yes, there is a rapture, probably just before Christ comes
[3:25:19.160 --> 3:25:21.160]  Baptology again
[3:25:21.160 --> 3:25:23.160]  And number two, that unilateral support for Israel
[3:25:23.160 --> 3:25:25.160]  I hate to tell you in angelicals this
[3:25:25.160 --> 3:25:27.160]  God gave Israel no mandate
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:29.160]  To go kill innocent Arabs
[3:25:29.160 --> 3:25:31.160]  He says a nation will be born in today
[3:25:31.160 --> 3:25:33.160]  And spiritually born, Israel will return
[3:25:33.160 --> 3:25:35.160]  At Christ's coming
[3:25:35.160 --> 3:25:37.160]  You are wrong, God does not approve
[3:25:37.160 --> 3:25:39.160]  Of squattering and murdering innocent Arabs
[3:25:39.160 --> 3:25:41.160]  He loves them too
[3:25:41.160 --> 3:25:43.160]  So you might as well wake up and smell the coffee
[3:25:43.160 --> 3:25:45.160]  You guys are wrong, this guy is right
[3:25:45.160 --> 3:25:47.160]  Hold on, I'm going to let you finish up on the
[3:25:47.160 --> 3:25:49.160]  Presidentplanet.tv end of it
[3:25:49.160 --> 3:25:51.160]  We're going to come back and talk to B.L. and others
[3:25:51.160 --> 3:25:53.160]  Stay with me, we're on the
[3:25:53.160 --> 3:25:55.160]  We're on the march, the empires on the run
[3:25:55.160 --> 3:25:57.160]  It's the Alex Jones show, the GCN radio network
[3:25:57.160 --> 3:25:59.160]  Again, coming up, I'm going to go through
[3:25:59.160 --> 3:26:01.160]  The Israel cartoons I saw worshipping Obama
[3:26:01.160 --> 3:26:03.160]  And some other news articles and calls
[3:26:03.160 --> 3:26:05.160]  But I wanted to let
[3:26:05.160 --> 3:26:07.160]  Get a chance to let you finish up
[3:26:07.160 --> 3:26:09.160]  What you were saying, Vicky from Ohio
[3:26:09.160 --> 3:26:11.160]  Go ahead
[3:26:11.160 --> 3:26:13.160]  Hello?
[3:26:13.160 --> 3:26:15.160]  Yes, Vicky, you're still on the air, we're just on the internet
[3:26:15.160 --> 3:26:17.160]  I'm sorry, I had a couple of questions
[3:26:17.160 --> 3:26:19.160]  I'm trying not to do that, why is your time?
[3:26:19.160 --> 3:26:21.160]  Oh no, it's not my time
[3:26:21.160 --> 3:26:23.160]  It's just we've got to
[3:26:23.160 --> 3:26:25.160]  Go ahead and finish up your points
[3:26:25.160 --> 3:26:27.160]  The food situation
[3:26:27.160 --> 3:26:29.160]  I'm trying to do some independent checking
[3:26:29.160 --> 3:26:31.160]  Are the grocery stores and the farmers getting credit
[3:26:31.160 --> 3:26:33.160]  So we'll at least have food in a couple months?
[3:26:33.160 --> 3:26:35.160]  Yes or no?
[3:26:35.160 --> 3:26:37.160]  There is all sorts of speculation
[3:26:37.160 --> 3:26:39.160]  That's driven up the price of food
[3:26:39.160 --> 3:26:41.160]  There has been food riots in more than
[3:26:41.160 --> 3:26:43.160]  50 countries
[3:26:43.160 --> 3:26:45.160]  With shortages
[3:26:45.160 --> 3:26:47.160]  I don't know if that's going to happen
[3:26:47.160 --> 3:26:49.160]  Here in the United States, I know a lot of people
[3:26:49.160 --> 3:26:51.160]  Who I trust
[3:26:51.160 --> 3:26:53.160]  Think that that is going on
[3:26:53.160 --> 3:26:55.160]  But I just don't know
[3:26:55.160 --> 3:26:57.160]  So many supplies of food
[3:26:57.160 --> 3:26:59.160]  So many ways to get food
[3:26:59.160 --> 3:27:01.160]  So I don't have to start really
[3:27:01.160 --> 3:27:03.160]  Well, what I think is clear
[3:27:03.160 --> 3:27:05.160]  That's one thing you said
[3:27:05.160 --> 3:27:07.160]  I can't independently verify and you never claimed it was true
[3:27:07.160 --> 3:27:09.160]  To be specific
[3:27:09.160 --> 3:27:11.160]  Food prices have already gone up a lot
[3:27:11.160 --> 3:27:13.160]  And so
[3:27:13.160 --> 3:27:15.160]  I've been saying for the last year, buy food
[3:27:15.160 --> 3:27:17.160]  In case we go into a full board depression
[3:27:17.160 --> 3:27:19.160]  Because people starved to death during the last one
[3:27:19.160 --> 3:27:21.160]  Okay, so
[3:27:21.160 --> 3:27:23.160]  All I'm saying is
[3:27:23.160 --> 3:27:25.160]  There are uncertain times to have storable food
[3:27:25.160 --> 3:27:27.160]  Right, yeah, but
[3:27:27.160 --> 3:27:29.160]  In my position, the stores were going to be bankrupt
[3:27:29.160 --> 3:27:31.160]  I was going to
[3:27:31.160 --> 3:27:33.160]  Okay, number two, I live relatively close
[3:27:33.160 --> 3:27:35.160]  To the Canadian border
[3:27:35.160 --> 3:27:37.160]  I keep trying to explain this to people
[3:27:37.160 --> 3:27:39.160]  And they dumb down America so much
[3:27:39.160 --> 3:27:41.160]  They don't understand economic theory, finance
[3:27:41.160 --> 3:27:43.160]  And how the banking system works
[3:27:43.160 --> 3:27:45.160]  So they don't understand the dollars close to collapse
[3:27:45.160 --> 3:27:47.160]  And they look at me like I'm nuts
[3:27:47.160 --> 3:27:49.160]  But I have more education
[3:27:49.160 --> 3:27:51.160]  And my IQ is a little bit higher
[3:27:51.160 --> 3:27:53.160]  In a very short drive to the Canadian border
[3:27:53.160 --> 3:27:55.160]  I don't have a lot of money
[3:27:55.160 --> 3:27:57.160]  Would Canadian currency be worth anything
[3:27:57.160 --> 3:27:59.160]  If the dollar collapses?
[3:27:59.160 --> 3:28:01.160]  You know, there's so many different things
[3:28:01.160 --> 3:28:03.160]  The New World Order can do
[3:28:03.160 --> 3:28:05.160]  But they told us
[3:28:05.160 --> 3:28:07.160]  In the Trilateral Commission documents
[3:28:07.160 --> 3:28:09.160]  In the IMF World Bank documents
[3:28:09.160 --> 3:28:11.160]  They told us over and over again
[3:28:11.160 --> 3:28:13.160]  Excuse me
[3:28:13.160 --> 3:28:15.160]  Getting out that cold
[3:28:15.160 --> 3:28:17.160]  They told us over and over again
[3:28:17.160 --> 3:28:19.160]  That
[3:28:19.160 --> 3:28:21.160]  We're going to do specific things in a specific order
[3:28:25.160 --> 3:28:27.160]  If the dollar collapsed
[3:28:27.160 --> 3:28:29.160]  That would probably not portend well
[3:28:29.160 --> 3:28:31.160]  For the loony
[3:28:31.160 --> 3:28:33.160]  But I just don't know
[3:28:33.160 --> 3:28:35.160]  And I've got to jump, I appreciate your call
[3:28:35.160 --> 3:28:37.160]  Vicki
[3:28:37.160 --> 3:28:39.160]  We're going to come back out of
[3:28:45.160 --> 3:28:47.160]  We're going to come back and take
[3:28:47.160 --> 3:28:49.160]  Our phone calls here as we go
[3:28:49.160 --> 3:28:51.160]  Live to the full broadcast
[3:28:51.160 --> 3:29:19.160]  So here we go
[3:29:21.160 --> 3:29:23.160]  Okay
[3:29:29.160 --> 3:29:31.160]  Okay, we're back live
[3:29:31.160 --> 3:29:33.160]  Thanks for joining us
[3:29:37.160 --> 3:29:39.160]  I want to go over
[3:29:39.160 --> 3:29:41.160]  The Barack Obama coverage
[3:29:41.160 --> 3:29:43.160]  That we've been witnessing
[3:29:45.160 --> 3:29:47.160]  First off
[3:29:47.160 --> 3:29:49.160]  People keep saying
[3:29:49.160 --> 3:29:51.160]  Everything has changed
[3:29:51.160 --> 3:29:53.160]  Everything is different
[3:29:53.160 --> 3:29:55.160]  That we are all
[3:29:55.160 --> 3:29:57.160]  Saved now
[3:29:57.160 --> 3:29:59.160]  Because Barack Obama
[3:29:59.160 --> 3:30:01.160]  Is here
[3:30:01.160 --> 3:30:03.160]  They're saying that
[3:30:03.160 --> 3:30:05.160]  We can
[3:30:05.160 --> 3:30:07.160]  Basically all go
[3:30:09.160 --> 3:30:11.160]  Back to sleep now
[3:30:13.160 --> 3:30:15.160]  Because he's been elected
[3:30:15.160 --> 3:30:17.160]  Because he's been elected
[3:30:19.160 --> 3:30:21.160]  And I just see this
[3:30:21.160 --> 3:30:23.160]  Over and over and over and over again
[3:30:23.160 --> 3:30:25.160]  And people are going to find out
[3:30:25.160 --> 3:30:27.160]  Things are not different
[3:30:27.160 --> 3:30:29.160]  Other than we've got a new president
[3:30:29.160 --> 3:30:31.160]  Who's a complete puppet
[3:30:31.160 --> 3:30:33.160]  For the very same financial
[3:30:33.160 --> 3:30:35.160]  Interest
[3:30:35.160 --> 3:30:37.160]  Who he's appointing in his cabinet
[3:30:37.160 --> 3:30:39.160]  His chief of staff
[3:30:39.160 --> 3:30:41.160]  His policies
[3:30:41.160 --> 3:30:43.160]  He was the guy
[3:30:43.160 --> 3:30:45.160]  Who supported
[3:30:45.160 --> 3:30:47.160]  The
[3:30:47.160 --> 3:30:49.160]  Banker Empowerment Banker Takeover
[3:30:49.160 --> 3:30:51.160]  Bill, not one red cent
[3:30:51.160 --> 3:30:53.160]  Given to the economy
[3:30:53.160 --> 3:30:55.160]  All of it the banks brag for bonuses
[3:30:55.160 --> 3:30:57.160]  And to buy up other financial institutions
[3:30:57.160 --> 3:30:59.160]  And elements of the real economy
[3:30:59.160 --> 3:31:01.160]  Which they're now doing
[3:31:01.160 --> 3:31:03.160]  But
[3:31:03.160 --> 3:31:05.160]  I was at my parent's house last night
[3:31:05.160 --> 3:31:07.160]  Eating dinner and back on the back porch
[3:31:07.160 --> 3:31:09.160]  They have a cockatoo
[3:31:09.160 --> 3:31:11.160]  And back there that's where they put their magazines
[3:31:11.160 --> 3:31:13.160]  And they have a birdcage liner
[3:31:13.160 --> 3:31:15.160]  So I've made the point that
[3:31:15.160 --> 3:31:17.160]  Literally this is only good
[3:31:17.160 --> 3:31:19.160]  For birdcage liner
[3:31:19.160 --> 3:31:21.160]  And that's what it was intended for
[3:31:21.160 --> 3:31:23.160]  But
[3:31:23.160 --> 3:31:25.160]  Take this news week here
[3:31:25.160 --> 3:31:27.160]  And I only dug around for about three minutes
[3:31:27.160 --> 3:31:29.160]  Then I went to work last night
[3:31:29.160 --> 3:31:31.160]  To the radio station
[3:31:31.160 --> 3:31:33.160]  And there were magazines and newspapers laying around
[3:31:33.160 --> 3:31:35.160]  And I saw the same thing
[3:31:35.160 --> 3:31:37.160]  And so I know you're seeing it out there
[3:31:37.160 --> 3:31:39.160]  Yourself
[3:31:39.160 --> 3:31:41.160]  This is out of Newsweek
[3:31:41.160 --> 3:31:43.160]  Magazine
[3:31:43.160 --> 3:31:45.160]  Right here
[3:31:45.160 --> 3:31:47.160]  And I'm going to show this to people on PrisonPlanet.tv
[3:31:47.160 --> 3:31:49.160]  On the document cam
[3:31:49.160 --> 3:31:51.160]  And in here
[3:31:51.160 --> 3:31:53.160]  They
[3:31:53.160 --> 3:31:55.160]  They show him
[3:31:55.160 --> 3:31:57.160]  As the savior of the
[3:31:57.160 --> 3:31:59.160]  Bill of Rights
[3:31:59.160 --> 3:32:01.160]  The savior of the Constitution
[3:32:01.160 --> 3:32:03.160]  As the Constitution, we the people
[3:32:03.160 --> 3:32:05.160]  And he's sitting at the Oval Office
[3:32:05.160 --> 3:32:07.160]  I'll put that on screen for people
[3:32:07.160 --> 3:32:09.160]  He is sitting
[3:32:09.160 --> 3:32:11.160]  In the Oval Office
[3:32:11.160 --> 3:32:13.160]  Lovingly trying to fix it
[3:32:13.160 --> 3:32:15.160]  He's got his little roll of tape there
[3:32:15.160 --> 3:32:17.160]  And he's putting the last
[3:32:17.160 --> 3:32:19.160]  Piece
[3:32:19.160 --> 3:32:21.160]  Of the Bill of Rights that's been torn in pieces
[3:32:25.160 --> 3:32:27.160]  Back together again
[3:32:27.160 --> 3:32:29.160]  So he's the good guy
[3:32:29.160 --> 3:32:31.160]  And right next to it is the evil
[3:32:31.160 --> 3:32:33.160]  Dick Cheney
[3:32:33.160 --> 3:32:35.160]  And George Bush
[3:32:35.160 --> 3:32:37.160]  They're playing their part, you know, they're being bad
[3:32:37.160 --> 3:32:39.160]  It says Golly Dick
[3:32:39.160 --> 3:32:41.160]  As our time in office
[3:32:41.160 --> 3:32:43.160]  Comes to a close
[3:32:43.160 --> 3:32:45.160]  I reflect
[3:32:45.160 --> 3:32:47.160]  On all we both have accomplished
[3:32:49.160 --> 3:32:51.160]  And then Cheney says
[3:32:51.160 --> 3:32:53.160]  We didn't get impeached
[3:32:53.160 --> 3:32:55.160]  But that's an interesting point
[3:32:55.160 --> 3:32:57.160]  If we've got so much change
[3:32:57.160 --> 3:32:59.160]  Then crimes should be punished
[3:32:59.160 --> 3:33:01.160]  Bill Clinton was protected by George Bush Sr
[3:33:01.160 --> 3:33:03.160]  Whenever he got into
[3:33:03.160 --> 3:33:05.160]  Office
[3:33:05.160 --> 3:33:07.160]  Blocked congressman Dan Burton's
[3:33:07.160 --> 3:33:09.160]  Committee from going after him
[3:33:09.160 --> 3:33:11.160]  For part and gate of convicted cocaine dealers
[3:33:11.160 --> 3:33:13.160]  And others and Chinese generals
[3:33:13.160 --> 3:33:15.160]  Paying people off in the
[3:33:15.160 --> 3:33:17.160]  Commerce Department
[3:33:17.160 --> 3:33:19.160]  But here is this image
[3:33:19.160 --> 3:33:21.160]  Barack Obama lovingly
[3:33:21.160 --> 3:33:23.160]  Is putting
[3:33:23.160 --> 3:33:25.160]  The Constitution
[3:33:25.160 --> 3:33:27.160]  Back together again
[3:33:27.160 --> 3:33:29.160]  Barack Obama is saying
[3:33:29.160 --> 3:33:31.160]  He's going to have youth brigades
[3:33:31.160 --> 3:33:33.160]  A million man spy force
[3:33:33.160 --> 3:33:35.160]  That they are going to spy more
[3:33:35.160 --> 3:33:37.160]  On the American people
[3:33:37.160 --> 3:33:39.160]  He voted for warrantless wiretapping
[3:33:39.160 --> 3:33:41.160]  And did not have a fourth or fifth amendment
[3:33:41.160 --> 3:33:43.160]  In the U.S. basically
[3:33:43.160 --> 3:33:45.160]  He is saying that we're going to have more
[3:33:45.160 --> 3:33:47.160]  Warrantless wiretapping
[3:33:47.160 --> 3:33:49.160]  In the U.S.
[3:33:49.160 --> 3:33:51.160]  He is saying that we're going to have
[3:33:51.160 --> 3:33:53.160]  More wars
[3:33:53.160 --> 3:33:55.160]  The list goes on and on
[3:33:57.160 --> 3:33:59.160]  He's for the phony drug war
[3:33:59.160 --> 3:34:01.160]  You don't hear him saying
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:03.160]  Reform drug laws, nothing
[3:34:03.160 --> 3:34:05.160]  He's appointing a who's who
[3:34:05.160 --> 3:34:07.160]  Of wall street that have already looted us
[3:34:07.160 --> 3:34:09.160]  He's promising more looting
[3:34:09.160 --> 3:34:11.160]  But they don't care, the simple minded public
[3:34:11.160 --> 3:34:13.160]  Can get news week
[3:34:13.160 --> 3:34:15.160]  And can pull it open
[3:34:15.160 --> 3:34:17.160]  And go, oh gee, he's putting
[3:34:17.160 --> 3:34:19.160]  That together
[3:34:19.160 --> 3:34:21.160]  Now actually, in by their dinner table
[3:34:21.160 --> 3:34:23.160]  I read this first and thought, what propaganda
[3:34:23.160 --> 3:34:25.160]  So then I'm walking by the newspaper
[3:34:27.160 --> 3:34:29.160]  And I see a whole page
[3:34:29.160 --> 3:34:31.160]  Of these
[3:34:31.160 --> 3:34:33.160]  In the Sunday's insight area
[3:34:33.160 --> 3:34:35.160]  A whole page of how
[3:34:35.160 --> 3:34:37.160]  You know the same thing, he's fixing
[3:34:37.160 --> 3:34:39.160]  The Constitution, he's fixing the Bill of Rights
[3:34:39.160 --> 3:34:41.160]  He's fixing America
[3:34:41.160 --> 3:34:43.160]  Folks, if you have these scan these in
[3:34:43.160 --> 3:34:45.160]  And email them to Aaron
[3:34:45.160 --> 3:34:47.160]  On the show tomorrow, I'm tempted to go to
[3:34:47.160 --> 3:34:49.160]  Barnes & Nobles or something to a news stand
[3:34:49.160 --> 3:34:51.160]  And just buy like 20 magazines
[3:34:51.160 --> 3:34:53.160]  And just show this unified propaganda
[3:34:53.160 --> 3:34:55.160]  But here is the
[3:34:59.160 --> 3:35:01.160]  Here's the Austin American statesman
[3:35:01.160 --> 3:35:03.160]  It's got people crying
[3:35:03.160 --> 3:35:05.160]  And worshiping him and everything's saved
[3:35:05.160 --> 3:35:07.160]  And they have this editorial cartoon
[3:35:07.160 --> 3:35:09.160]  White House Attic, hey, cool old stuff
[3:35:09.160 --> 3:35:11.160]  And what's the cool old stuff
[3:35:11.160 --> 3:35:13.160]  Government of the people, by the people, for the people
[3:35:13.160 --> 3:35:15.160]  And he's lovingly looking at it
[3:35:15.160 --> 3:35:17.160]  He loves freedom
[3:35:17.160 --> 3:35:19.160]  He loves America
[3:35:19.160 --> 3:35:21.160]  He's going to fix all that
[3:35:23.160 --> 3:35:25.160]  He's not saying a word about it
[3:35:25.160 --> 3:35:27.160]  He's moving ahead with all these
[3:35:27.160 --> 3:35:29.160]  Police state measures
[3:35:29.160 --> 3:35:31.160]  He's supporting everything but
[3:35:33.160 --> 3:35:35.160]  There's the shot for you
[3:35:35.160 --> 3:35:37.160]  Watching on the internet
[3:35:39.160 --> 3:35:41.160]  Ben Sargent
[3:35:41.160 --> 3:35:43.160]  I put
[3:35:43.160 --> 3:35:45.160]  A Ben Sargent cartoon in my book
[3:35:45.160 --> 3:35:47.160]  9-11 to sit in a tyranny where it's
[3:35:47.160 --> 3:35:49.160]  Ashcroft
[3:35:49.160 --> 3:35:51.160]  Arresting Uncle Sam and he has a bill of rights
[3:35:51.160 --> 3:35:53.160]  And he says, oh, carry in one of those
[3:35:53.160 --> 3:35:55.160]  Terrorist manuals, are you?
[3:35:55.160 --> 3:35:57.160]  See, that was an accurate
[3:35:57.160 --> 3:35:59.160]  Because in reality
[3:35:59.160 --> 3:36:01.160]  Ben Sargent lives in town
[3:36:01.160 --> 3:36:03.160]  And I was told by one of his friends, oh yeah
[3:36:03.160 --> 3:36:05.160]  He got that idea from your show
[3:36:05.160 --> 3:36:07.160]  I was joking around about terrorist manuals
[3:36:07.160 --> 3:36:09.160]  With the pocket constitution
[3:36:09.160 --> 3:36:11.160]  Where, you know, they were listing people
[3:36:11.160 --> 3:36:13.160]  That have pocket constitutions as terrorists
[3:36:13.160 --> 3:36:15.160]  So Ben Sargent, local cartoonist
[3:36:15.160 --> 3:36:17.160]  He did that, we'll see
[3:36:17.160 --> 3:36:19.160]  Oh, now Ben Sargent
[3:36:21.160 --> 3:36:23.160]  Does one that's deceptive
[3:36:23.160 --> 3:36:25.160]  Hey, cool old stuff
[3:36:25.160 --> 3:36:27.160]  In the White House attic
[3:36:27.160 --> 3:36:29.160]  Government of the people
[3:36:29.160 --> 3:36:31.160]  By the people, for the people
[3:36:31.160 --> 3:36:33.160]  Why? Because the people can be suckered
[3:36:33.160 --> 3:36:35.160]  And he can give a better speech
[3:36:35.160 --> 3:36:39.160]  And he can con the public
[3:36:41.160 --> 3:36:43.160]  And then it just goes on and on
[3:36:43.160 --> 3:36:45.160]  With similar editorials
[3:36:45.160 --> 3:36:47.160]  And so email them to AaronInfoWars.com
[3:36:47.160 --> 3:36:49.160]  The next few days, we'll show you a whole bunch more of them
[3:36:49.160 --> 3:36:51.160]  And then there's just lots of coverage like this
[3:36:51.160 --> 3:36:53.160]  Fun, fun, fun, post-election
[3:36:53.160 --> 3:36:55.160]  Cuddling begins on page 24
[3:36:55.160 --> 3:37:05.160]  And they've got similar things in here
[3:37:05.160 --> 3:37:07.160]  And articles with people crying
[3:37:07.160 --> 3:37:09.160]  You know, it's just everything is solved
[3:37:09.160 --> 3:37:11.160]  Everything is fine
[3:37:11.160 --> 3:37:13.160]  And you can find these clips all over YouTube
[3:37:13.160 --> 3:37:15.160]  From mainstream television with people saying
[3:37:15.160 --> 3:37:17.160]  I don't have to worry about my bills again
[3:37:17.160 --> 3:37:19.160]  I have to worry about healthcare again
[3:37:19.160 --> 3:37:21.160]  I'm saved, my future is great
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:23.160]  And optimism, you know
[3:37:23.160 --> 3:37:25.160]  My future is great
[3:37:25.160 --> 3:37:27.160]  And optimism is great
[3:37:27.160 --> 3:37:31.160]  If it's based on some type of real reform
[3:37:31.160 --> 3:37:33.160]  That quantitatively
[3:37:33.160 --> 3:37:35.160]  Historically will actually help the people
[3:37:35.160 --> 3:37:37.160]  But it's not
[3:37:37.160 --> 3:37:39.160]  When it's based on fraud
[3:37:39.160 --> 3:37:41.160]  And you know the agenda
[3:37:41.160 --> 3:37:43.160]  Is continuing run by the same corporate elites
[3:37:43.160 --> 3:37:45.160]  Openly setting up a new world order
[3:37:47.160 --> 3:37:49.160]  And they have no intention of changing it
[3:37:49.160 --> 3:37:51.160]  They're just continuing
[3:37:51.160 --> 3:37:53.160]  But because the person is different
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:55.160]  Rhetoric, everything's okay
[3:37:55.160 --> 3:37:57.160]  Here's another one
[3:37:57.160 --> 3:37:59.160]  Austin American statesman, Monday
[3:37:59.160 --> 3:38:01.160]  Now understand, this is three minutes
[3:38:01.160 --> 3:38:03.160]  Digging around in some newspapers
[3:38:07.160 --> 3:38:09.160]  Because I thought, man, it's in this magazine
[3:38:09.160 --> 3:38:11.160]  Wait, it's in that magazine
[3:38:11.160 --> 3:38:13.160]  Everything I was opening had it
[3:38:13.160 --> 3:38:15.160]  National, local, didn't matter
[3:38:15.160 --> 3:38:17.160]  I opened up a time magazine
[3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:19.160]  My mom said, don't take that with you, I haven't read it yet
[3:38:19.160 --> 3:38:21.160]  And it had them in there
[3:38:21.160 --> 3:38:23.160]  With him fixing the Bill of Rights
[3:38:23.160 --> 3:38:25.160]  Here it is, passing the torch
[3:38:25.160 --> 3:38:27.160]  This is the
[3:38:29.160 --> 3:38:31.160]  Sine Wilkinson, Philadelphia Daily News
[3:38:31.160 --> 3:38:33.160]  Passing the torch, and it's the
[3:38:33.160 --> 3:38:35.160]  Torch of Liberty
[3:38:35.160 --> 3:38:37.160]  It's
[3:38:37.160 --> 3:38:39.160]  Just gone out
[3:38:41.160 --> 3:38:43.160]  And
[3:38:43.160 --> 3:38:45.160]  Obama is reaching for it
[3:38:45.160 --> 3:38:49.160]  Jumbo matches in his hand
[3:38:55.160 --> 3:38:57.160]  Jumbo matches
[3:38:57.160 --> 3:38:59.160]  And
[3:38:59.160 --> 3:39:01.160]  Just every magazine, every newspaper, the same thing
[3:39:01.160 --> 3:39:03.160]  He's going to reignite liberty
[3:39:03.160 --> 3:39:05.160]  He's going to fix the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[3:39:05.160 --> 3:39:07.160]  But he's saying nothing about it
[3:39:07.160 --> 3:39:09.160]  And everything he's doing is
[3:39:09.160 --> 3:39:11.160]  Promising more attacks on individual liberty
[3:39:11.160 --> 3:39:13.160]  The Second Amendment, right to defend yourself
[3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:15.160]  The Second Amendment
[3:39:15.160 --> 3:39:17.160]  Warrantless wiretapping, war wars
[3:39:17.160 --> 3:39:19.160]  Domestic spy forces
[3:39:19.160 --> 3:39:21.160]  As strong as the U.S. military
[3:39:21.160 --> 3:39:23.160]  In fact, when he first said this
[3:39:23.160 --> 3:39:25.160]  About six, seven months ago
[3:39:25.160 --> 3:39:27.160]  In the Chicago Tribune reported on it
[3:39:27.160 --> 3:39:29.160]  People didn't believe it and they denied it
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:31.160]  John, pull that audio clip up
[3:39:31.160 --> 3:39:33.160]  About
[3:39:33.160 --> 3:39:35.160]  A domestic spy force
[3:39:35.160 --> 3:39:37.160]  As strong
[3:39:37.160 --> 3:39:39.160]  As the military
[3:39:39.160 --> 3:39:41.160]  Jumbo matches
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:43.160]  Put it back up there
[3:39:43.160 --> 3:39:45.160]  He's going to fix it
[3:39:45.160 --> 3:39:47.160]  Everything is solved
[3:39:47.160 --> 3:39:49.160]  Everything is fine
[3:39:49.160 --> 3:39:51.160]  Again, I'm going to go ahead
[3:39:51.160 --> 3:39:53.160]  And stop going through these
[3:39:53.160 --> 3:39:55.160]  There are even more
[3:39:57.160 --> 3:39:59.160]  And I am going to make a documentary on Barack Obama
[3:39:59.160 --> 3:40:01.160]  I've decided it
[3:40:01.160 --> 3:40:03.160]  In fact, I'm just going to say now
[3:40:03.160 --> 3:40:05.160]  I'm still going up to Dallas for the anniversary of JFK
[3:40:05.160 --> 3:40:07.160]  I'm making that film
[3:40:07.160 --> 3:40:09.160]  With a bunch of people in it
[3:40:09.160 --> 3:40:11.160]  But that is going to be going on the shelf
[3:40:11.160 --> 3:40:13.160]  So is my film
[3:40:13.160 --> 3:40:15.160]  On the overall eugenics plan
[3:40:15.160 --> 3:40:17.160]  That's going to be the masterpiece
[3:40:17.160 --> 3:40:19.160]  I'm just going to put out a quick film on Obama
[3:40:19.160 --> 3:40:21.160]  Because we need something to go viral
[3:40:21.160 --> 3:40:23.160]  And go viral now
[3:40:23.160 --> 3:40:25.160]  So send me all your videos of Obama
[3:40:25.160 --> 3:40:27.160]  All your research, we want it all
[3:40:27.160 --> 3:40:29.160]  Send it to 3001
[3:40:29.160 --> 3:40:31.160]  South Lamar, Suite 100
[3:40:31.160 --> 3:40:37.160]  In Texas 78704
[3:40:37.160 --> 3:40:39.160]  And then there's all
[3:40:39.160 --> 3:40:41.160]  These type of headlines
[3:40:41.160 --> 3:40:43.160]  I just knocked my stack off here
[3:40:45.160 --> 3:40:47.160]  About Obama to change world
[3:40:47.160 --> 3:40:49.160]  Obama to save world
[3:40:51.160 --> 3:40:53.160]  On and on and on and on and on
[3:40:53.160 --> 3:40:58.160]  Now I want to go to your phone calls
[3:41:04.160 --> 3:41:06.160]  I want to go to your phone calls
[3:41:06.160 --> 3:41:08.160]  But there's a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet
[3:41:08.160 --> 3:41:10.160]  So let me hurriedly go over this
[3:41:10.160 --> 3:41:12.160]  Northcom
[3:41:12.160 --> 3:41:14.160]  To participate in exercise
[3:41:14.160 --> 3:41:16.160]  Vigilant Shield 09
[3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:18.160]  And they're going to do
[3:41:18.160 --> 3:41:21.160]  A coordinated practice takeover
[3:41:21.160 --> 3:41:24.160]  The local constabulary in multiple states
[3:41:24.160 --> 3:41:26.160]  For three simultaneous nukes
[3:41:26.160 --> 3:41:28.160]  Going off in the United States
[3:41:28.160 --> 3:41:30.160]  November 12th through the 18th
[3:41:30.160 --> 3:41:32.160]  Always got to look at those because
[3:41:32.160 --> 3:41:35.160]  They use that as a pretext
[3:41:35.160 --> 3:41:37.160]  To carry out real attacks
[3:41:37.160 --> 3:41:39.160]  As an overall cover
[3:41:40.160 --> 3:41:42.160]  On the Barack Obama issue
[3:41:42.160 --> 3:41:44.160]  This is the one I was looking for
[3:41:44.160 --> 3:41:46.160]  Barack Obama vows to change the world
[3:41:46.160 --> 3:41:48.160]  Look he's
[3:41:48.160 --> 3:41:50.160]  He's the one
[3:41:50.160 --> 3:41:52.160]  He's going to change it all
[3:41:55.160 --> 3:41:57.160]  They're saying bin Laden is going to attack
[3:41:57.160 --> 3:41:58.160]  It's not to test him
[3:41:58.160 --> 3:42:00.160]  The CIA may stage another terror attack
[3:42:00.160 --> 3:42:02.160]  Or Israel might or somebody else
[3:42:02.160 --> 3:42:03.160]  To then embolden him
[3:42:03.160 --> 3:42:05.160]  See we got to get behind him
[3:42:05.160 --> 3:42:07.160]  Now he's got to have another war
[3:42:07.160 --> 3:42:09.160]  He didn't want to but he has to
[3:42:09.160 --> 3:42:11.160]  Because the terrorists hit us again
[3:42:15.160 --> 3:42:17.160]  But let me get into this one
[3:42:17.160 --> 3:42:19.160]  This one
[3:42:19.160 --> 3:42:21.160]  Mainstream news is reporting
[3:42:21.160 --> 3:42:23.160]  George Washington blogspot has done a
[3:42:26.160 --> 3:42:28.160]  Boil down of this
[3:42:28.160 --> 3:42:30.160]  About we must push for a prosecution
[3:42:30.160 --> 3:42:32.160]  Of Bush and Cheney
[3:42:32.160 --> 3:42:34.160]  That is certainly important to me to do that
[3:42:35.160 --> 3:42:37.160]  I have a couple other stories here
[3:42:37.160 --> 3:42:39.160]  But I've got so many
[3:42:39.160 --> 3:42:41.160]  I need to be careful about how many I cover
[3:42:41.160 --> 3:42:47.160]  Time to cover them all
[3:42:47.160 --> 3:42:49.160]  There was another one here
[3:42:51.160 --> 3:42:53.160]  Out of AFP
[3:42:57.160 --> 3:42:59.160]  Where the New York Times
[3:43:00.160 --> 3:43:02.160]  Is reporting that
[3:43:04.160 --> 3:43:06.160]  The US ran secret terror attacks
[3:43:06.160 --> 3:43:08.160]  Inside Iran trying to topple the government
[3:43:08.160 --> 3:43:10.160]  I've been telling you that for five years
[3:43:10.160 --> 3:43:12.160]  And the White House submitted it over a year ago
[3:43:12.160 --> 3:43:14.160]  Now the New York Times is breaking it
[3:43:14.160 --> 3:43:17.160]  They'll probably get a Pulitzer Prize or something
[3:43:17.160 --> 3:43:19.160]  Before we do that
[3:43:19.160 --> 3:43:21.160]  Before we go back to your phone calls
[3:43:32.160 --> 3:43:34.160]  This is what happens when I go on the air
[3:43:34.160 --> 3:43:35.160]  When I got a cold folks
[3:43:35.160 --> 3:43:37.160]  I'm kind of out of it a little bit today
[3:43:37.160 --> 3:43:39.160]  Before I go to BL and Texas
[3:43:39.160 --> 3:43:41.160]  And others that are holding
[3:43:43.160 --> 3:43:45.160]  There's a couple sponsors I want to tell you about
[3:43:45.160 --> 3:43:47.160]  To make this broadcast possible
[3:43:47.160 --> 3:43:49.160]  One of them is Akola Blue
[3:43:49.160 --> 3:43:51.160]  The great atmospheric water generator
[3:43:51.160 --> 3:43:54.160]  That I use here in my office
[3:43:54.160 --> 3:43:56.160]  And I just ordered another one from my home
[3:43:56.160 --> 3:43:59.160]  Same thing Willie Nelson basically pushes
[3:43:59.160 --> 3:44:01.160]  And it's got five filters in it
[3:44:01.160 --> 3:44:03.160]  It grabs the water out of the air
[3:44:03.160 --> 3:44:05.160]  Then runs through the five filters
[3:44:05.160 --> 3:44:07.160]  Find out more at ECOLOblue.com
[3:44:07.160 --> 3:44:09.160]  You really want to check this out

[3:44:36.160 --> 3:44:38.160]  Is NuVitality
[3:44:38.160 --> 3:44:40.160]  Their website is nuvitality.com
[3:44:40.160 --> 3:44:43.160]  Have a banner up on infowars.com
[3:44:43.160 --> 3:44:45.160]  And prisonplanet.com for those folks
[3:44:45.160 --> 3:44:47.160]  And they've got hundreds of just mainline
[3:44:47.160 --> 3:44:49.160]  High quality herbs and vitamins and minerals
[3:44:49.160 --> 3:44:51.160]  That have been well documented to have
[3:44:51.160 --> 3:44:53.160]  Nutritive and health effects
[3:44:53.160 --> 3:44:57.160]  And you can go to nuvitality.com
[3:44:57.160 --> 3:44:59.160]  Or call 800-569-4056
[3:44:59.160 --> 3:45:01.160]  And ask them for a catalog
[3:45:01.160 --> 3:45:04.160]  Or brochure 1-800-569-4056
[3:45:04.160 --> 3:45:06.160]  Some of their products are alloys, colon and body
[3:45:06.160 --> 3:45:08.160]  Cleanse really good at flushing out
[3:45:08.160 --> 3:45:11.160]  And detoxifying or super beta prostate
[3:45:11.160 --> 3:45:13.160]  For men above 45
[3:45:13.160 --> 3:45:18.160]  Excellent super beta prostate 1-800-569-4056
[3:45:18.160 --> 3:45:21.160]  I certainly hope that you will check that out
[3:45:21.160 --> 3:45:24.160]  I certainly hope that you will give them a call
[3:45:24.160 --> 3:45:28.160]  And that you will find out about the line
[3:45:28.160 --> 3:45:30.160]  Of great products that they have
[3:45:30.160 --> 3:45:33.160]  At nuvitality.com
[3:45:33.160 --> 3:45:36.160]  We're going to come back with the final segment
[3:45:36.160 --> 3:45:39.160]  And I'm going to dig around here
[3:45:39.160 --> 3:45:42.160]  Because I had several stories I wanted to cover
[3:45:42.160 --> 3:45:46.160]  And I'm not finding them here
[3:45:46.160 --> 3:45:49.160]  So I'll use this break to find those
[3:45:49.160 --> 3:45:53.160]  And I'll take a few final calls
[3:45:53.160 --> 3:45:59.160]  But the key to all this is just the lawlessness
[3:45:59.160 --> 3:46:03.160]  Of the Denver police admitting that they attacked
[3:46:03.160 --> 3:46:05.160]  Their own police to blame it on the citizenry
[3:46:05.160 --> 3:46:07.160]  To give a bad name to protesting
[3:46:07.160 --> 3:46:09.160]  Because the agenda is to ban protesting
[3:46:09.160 --> 3:46:11.160]  Because the government wants to do really bad things to us
[3:46:11.160 --> 3:46:13.160]  And knows that we're going to revolt against it
[3:46:13.160 --> 3:46:15.160]  And they don't want the image of the people
[3:46:15.160 --> 3:46:17.160]  Not going along with it on TV
[3:46:17.160 --> 3:46:19.160]  Well the same thing goes with the New York Times
[3:46:19.160 --> 3:46:21.160]  Admitting that the U.S. government
[3:46:21.160 --> 3:46:23.160]  Staged all these terror attacks inside Iran
[3:46:23.160 --> 3:46:26.160]  For the last five years
[3:46:26.160 --> 3:46:28.160]  Trying to get Iran to attack us back
[3:46:28.160 --> 3:46:30.160]  I mean that's a criminal government folks
[3:46:30.160 --> 3:46:33.160]  We've got a really evil government
[3:46:33.160 --> 3:46:36.160]  And it's not our government
[3:46:36.160 --> 3:46:39.160]  It's just a private corporate management group
[3:46:39.160 --> 3:46:41.160]  That does whatever it wants whenever it wants
[3:46:41.160 --> 3:46:43.160]  However it wants
[3:46:43.160 --> 3:46:48.160]  So I'm going to dig that out there in the break
[3:46:48.160 --> 3:46:50.160]  And go over it
[3:46:50.160 --> 3:46:52.160]  And I'm starting to get desensitized
[3:46:52.160 --> 3:46:55.160]  All these world leaders calling for world government
[3:46:55.160 --> 3:46:57.160]  And then our media never says
[3:46:57.160 --> 3:47:00.160]  Oh Alex Jones was right
[3:47:00.160 --> 3:47:02.160]  Hello I'm Steve Shank
[3:47:02.160 --> 3:47:04.160]  We're entering a holiday season
[3:47:04.160 --> 3:47:06.160]  Never before seen in America
[3:47:06.160 --> 3:47:08.160]  We're thankful for the warning given by members
[3:47:08.160 --> 3:47:10.160]  Of Mr. Obama's campaign team
[3:47:10.160 --> 3:47:12.160]  Of the coming international incident
[3:47:12.160 --> 3:47:15.160]  Which will force unpopular decisions
[3:47:15.160 --> 3:47:16.160]  Without this warning
[3:47:16.160 --> 3:47:18.160]  Many of us who still have money available
[3:47:18.160 --> 3:47:21.160]  Would have unknowingly wasted on our Christmas gifts
[3:47:21.160 --> 3:47:23.160]  That will be useless when the only food available
[3:47:23.160 --> 3:47:25.160]  Is in a government bread line
[3:47:25.160 --> 3:47:27.160]  When the president is faced with the expected
[3:47:27.160 --> 3:47:29.160]  National security incident
[3:47:29.160 --> 3:47:31.160]  The in place patriot legislation
[3:47:31.160 --> 3:47:34.160]  Will control transport and distribution of food
[3:47:34.160 --> 3:47:36.160]  Those of us who are able to take care of ourselves
[3:47:36.160 --> 3:47:38.160]  Must put in supplies of food
[3:47:38.160 --> 3:47:40.160]  This will free up the relief organizations
[3:47:40.160 --> 3:47:42.160]  To give food to those unable
[3:47:42.160 --> 3:47:44.160]  Or not smart enough to prepare
[3:47:44.160 --> 3:47:46.160]  The greatest gift this Christmas
[3:47:46.160 --> 3:47:48.160]  Is life itself
[3:47:48.160 --> 3:47:50.160]  Food for these unknown times
[3:47:50.160 --> 3:47:53.160]  Call 800-409-5633
[3:47:53.160 --> 3:47:55.160]  On the web eFoodsDirect.com
[3:47:55.160 --> 3:47:59.160]  800-409-5633
[3:47:59.160 --> 3:48:02.160]  It is a big idea
[3:48:02.160 --> 3:48:04.160]  A new world order
[3:48:04.160 --> 3:48:06.160]  In the near future
[3:48:06.160 --> 3:48:09.160]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[3:48:09.160 --> 3:48:11.160]  It's known as the builder bird
[3:48:11.160 --> 3:48:14.160]  But their objective being world domination
[3:48:14.160 --> 3:48:17.160]  For thousands of years their dark order grew
[3:48:17.160 --> 3:48:20.160]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[3:48:20.160 --> 3:48:23.160]  Their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:48:23.160 --> 3:48:25.160]  Of humanity is at hand
[3:48:27.160 --> 3:48:29.160]  For the first time in history
[3:48:29.160 --> 3:48:31.160]  The elite's plan for world government
[3:48:31.160 --> 3:48:33.160]  Is blown wide open
[3:48:33.160 --> 3:48:35.160]  You will learn the secret that drives
[3:48:35.160 --> 3:48:37.160]  The entire new world order agenda
[3:48:37.160 --> 3:48:39.160]  The builder bird is making great progress
[3:48:39.160 --> 3:48:40.160]  For the world government
[3:48:40.160 --> 3:48:41.160]  Most people have no idea
[3:48:41.160 --> 3:48:42.160]  They're not after money
[3:48:42.160 --> 3:48:43.160]  They have all the money they need
[3:48:43.160 --> 3:48:44.160]  They're after power
[3:48:44.160 --> 3:48:45.160]  That's their aptitude

[3:48:59.160 --> 3:49:00.160]  Have you ever thought about
[3:49:00.160 --> 3:49:02.160]  What's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[3:49:02.160 --> 3:49:04.160]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol
[3:49:04.160 --> 3:49:07.160]  Sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more
[3:49:07.160 --> 3:49:09.160]  Even fragrance can indicate
[3:49:09.160 --> 3:49:11.160]  The presence of some 4000 separate ingredients
[3:49:11.160 --> 3:49:13.160]  Most of which are synthetic
[3:49:13.160 --> 3:49:14.160]  Hi, this is Alex Jones
[3:49:14.160 --> 3:49:16.160]  I was shocked when I discovered
[3:49:16.160 --> 3:49:17.160]  I could be inhaling these additives
[3:49:17.160 --> 3:49:19.160]  That can lead to coughing, wheezing
[3:49:19.160 --> 3:49:21.160]  And shortness of breath, headaches, nausea
[3:49:21.160 --> 3:49:22.160]  Irritation of the skin

[3:50:02.160 --> 3:50:03.160]  Alright, it's the final segment
[3:50:03.160 --> 3:50:04.160]  I'm tempted to go into overdrive
[3:50:04.160 --> 3:50:06.160]  So I can talk to Chloe and Michelle
[3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:10.160]  And Chris and Aaron
[3:50:10.160 --> 3:50:12.160]  BL, BL's next
[3:50:12.160 --> 3:50:14.160]  And I meant to get into this
[3:50:14.160 --> 3:50:16.160]  I mentioned this on the Sunday show
[3:50:16.160 --> 3:50:18.160]  And I never even got to it today
[3:50:18.160 --> 3:50:21.160]  It's actually a CBC documentary
[3:50:21.160 --> 3:50:23.160]  The disappearing mail
[3:50:23.160 --> 3:50:25.160]  And it admits that just the chemicals
[3:50:25.160 --> 3:50:27.160]  In plastic are deforming
[3:50:27.160 --> 3:50:29.160]  And sterilizing men
[3:50:29.160 --> 3:50:30.160]  But they don't tell you
[3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:32.160]  That was all done by design
[3:50:32.160 --> 3:50:36.160]  And you notice the EPA
[3:50:36.160 --> 3:50:39.160]  Is not saying get rid of it
[3:50:39.160 --> 3:50:41.160]  The FDA is not saying get rid of it
[3:50:41.160 --> 3:50:42.160]  This is all by design
[3:50:42.160 --> 3:50:44.160]  And that's the thing, cops and military
[3:50:44.160 --> 3:50:46.160]  And FBI, those that think you're part of the system
[3:50:46.160 --> 3:50:47.160]  You're not
[3:50:47.160 --> 3:50:48.160]  You're being hurt too
[3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:49.160]  And it's all by design
[3:50:49.160 --> 3:50:51.160]  And I'm sorry you can't grow up
[3:50:51.160 --> 3:50:52.160]  And realize that
[3:50:52.160 --> 3:50:55.160]  But you know, this is real
[3:50:55.160 --> 3:50:56.160]  This is real
[3:50:56.160 --> 3:50:58.160]  BL in Texas, you're on the air
[3:50:58.160 --> 3:50:59.160]  Go ahead
[3:51:01.160 --> 3:51:03.160]  Hi Alex
[3:51:03.160 --> 3:51:05.160]  Thanks to the efforts of Attorney Berg
[3:51:05.160 --> 3:51:07.160]  Dr. Corsi, your organization
[3:51:07.160 --> 3:51:10.160]  Matt Bruce in Florida, so many others
[3:51:10.160 --> 3:51:13.160]  It's coming out and getting some traction
[3:51:13.160 --> 3:51:16.160]  In the media that we seem to have
[3:51:16.160 --> 3:51:19.160]  Elected an illegal alien as president
[3:51:19.160 --> 3:51:22.160]  And that brings up some serious
[3:51:22.160 --> 3:51:24.160]  Constitutional issues here
[3:51:24.160 --> 3:51:26.160]  Assuming that it gets some traction
[3:51:26.160 --> 3:51:28.160]  With the Supremes
[3:51:28.160 --> 3:51:32.160]  I'm just wondering where we go from there
[3:51:32.160 --> 3:51:33.160]  Does that leave us with Bush?
[3:51:33.160 --> 3:51:35.160]  Do we have the election over again?
[3:51:35.160 --> 3:51:36.160]  That's a crisis
[3:51:36.160 --> 3:51:38.160]  No, you end up with Biden
[3:51:38.160 --> 3:51:40.160]  And yeah, then they would have some type
[3:51:40.160 --> 3:51:41.160]  Of special election probably
[3:51:41.160 --> 3:51:43.160]  But if it came out now
[3:51:43.160 --> 3:51:45.160]  Before the Electoral College
[3:51:45.160 --> 3:51:47.160]  That's why they have that
[3:51:47.160 --> 3:51:48.160]  So that the states, people say
[3:51:48.160 --> 3:51:50.160]  Well, that bypasses popular vote
[3:51:50.160 --> 3:51:52.160]  No, it's your state legislature
[3:51:52.160 --> 3:51:53.160]  Which you also elected
[3:51:53.160 --> 3:51:55.160]  As another check in Mowins
[3:51:55.160 --> 3:51:58.160]  Then the Electoral College
[3:51:58.160 --> 3:51:59.160]  Would not elect Obama
[3:51:59.160 --> 3:52:01.160]  And would put McCain in
[3:52:01.160 --> 3:52:03.160]  The problem is, of course, then
[3:52:03.160 --> 3:52:04.160]  The new owner would still win
[3:52:04.160 --> 3:52:06.160]  Because he's total globalist
[3:52:06.160 --> 3:52:08.160]  It's a mess
[3:52:08.160 --> 3:52:10.160]  But I mean, by getting traction
[3:52:10.160 --> 3:52:12.160]  It is in the news that
[3:52:12.160 --> 3:52:14.160]  It isn't just the issue
[3:52:14.160 --> 3:52:16.160]  That his mother didn't live here long enough
[3:52:16.160 --> 3:52:18.160]  And did have him out of the country
[3:52:18.160 --> 3:52:20.160]  And that they falsified the birth certificate
[3:52:20.160 --> 3:52:21.160]  And won't show the original
[3:52:21.160 --> 3:52:23.160]  It's also the issue of his real name
[3:52:23.160 --> 3:52:24.160]  Being something else
[3:52:24.160 --> 3:52:27.160]  And now even who his dad is being in question
[3:52:27.160 --> 3:52:29.160]  But that's why the elite shows him
[3:52:29.160 --> 3:52:33.160]  It's because there's so much dirt on
[3:52:33.160 --> 3:52:36.160]  The whole thing
[3:52:36.160 --> 3:52:38.160]  Very Satoro
[3:52:38.160 --> 3:52:39.160]  Yeah
[3:52:39.160 --> 3:52:43.160]  Well, I was in Fort Worth on Friday
[3:52:43.160 --> 3:52:46.160]  At one of the big ammunition discounters
[3:52:46.160 --> 3:52:48.160]  And I couldn't get
[3:52:48.160 --> 3:52:50.160]  I could hardly get anything
[3:52:50.160 --> 3:52:51.160]  Less than 24 hours before
[3:52:51.160 --> 3:52:53.160]  They had gotten a million dollar shipment
[3:52:53.160 --> 3:52:54.160]  Of ammunition
[3:52:54.160 --> 3:52:57.160]  And you couldn't get any
[3:52:57.160 --> 3:52:59.160]  You couldn't get shotgun shells
[3:52:59.160 --> 3:53:01.160]  You couldn't get most handgun ammunition
[3:53:01.160 --> 3:53:02.160]  A lot of rifle ammunition
[3:53:02.160 --> 3:53:04.160]  I mean, you can't get it, Alex
[3:53:04.160 --> 3:53:06.160]  Well, I mean, I had a whole article here today
[3:53:06.160 --> 3:53:08.160]  That I never got to
[3:53:08.160 --> 3:53:09.160]  I was kicking myself during the break
[3:53:09.160 --> 3:53:11.160]  Looking at all this
[3:53:11.160 --> 3:53:13.160]  Where it was a mainstream news article
[3:53:13.160 --> 3:53:15.160]  Listing all the gun control
[3:53:15.160 --> 3:53:17.160]  And by the way, the article's for it
[3:53:17.160 --> 3:53:19.160]  How great it is
[3:53:19.160 --> 3:53:22.160]  And I mean, he's coming after everything
[3:53:22.160 --> 3:53:24.160]  So I mean, I guess in a way it's changed
[3:53:24.160 --> 3:53:26.160]  Because like I said
[3:53:26.160 --> 3:53:28.160]  Every president we get is just going to get worse
[3:53:28.160 --> 3:53:30.160]  Regardless of what color they are
[3:53:30.160 --> 3:53:33.160]  Because the agenda is just building B.L.
[3:53:33.160 --> 3:53:35.160]  Change only a globalist could love
[3:53:35.160 --> 3:53:37.160]  Well, I mean, did you ever
[3:53:37.160 --> 3:53:39.160]  I mean, we're living to see them call for world government
[3:53:39.160 --> 3:53:41.160]  And Limbaugh isn't talking about it
[3:53:43.160 --> 3:53:45.160]  I guess they've printed enough money
[3:53:45.160 --> 3:53:46.160]  To buy everybody off
[3:53:46.160 --> 3:53:48.160]  Yeah, and then they're going to leave us
[3:53:48.160 --> 3:53:50.160]  Holding the bag with the debt
[3:53:50.160 --> 3:53:52.160]  For the money they issued to buy everybody off
[3:53:53.160 --> 3:53:55.160]  It's the old Chinese curse, Alex
[3:53:55.160 --> 3:53:57.160]  May you live in interesting times
[3:53:57.160 --> 3:53:58.160]  Well, we do, buddy
[3:53:58.160 --> 3:54:00.160]  I appreciate your call, good to hear from you
[3:54:00.160 --> 3:54:02.160]  Yeah, all records were broken
[3:54:02.160 --> 3:54:04.160]  The last week for gun sales, ammo sales
[3:54:04.160 --> 3:54:06.160]  You can go pull that up, it's everywhere
[3:54:06.160 --> 3:54:08.160]  Just every state level, federal record
[3:54:08.160 --> 3:54:10.160]  Just gun, good
[3:54:10.160 --> 3:54:12.160]  I love it, more weapons
[3:54:12.160 --> 3:54:14.160]  More firearms
[3:54:14.160 --> 3:54:17.160]  Because it's a symbol that we're not gilded
[3:54:17.160 --> 3:54:18.160]  We don't want to go to that
[3:54:18.160 --> 3:54:21.160]  But it's that great final thing
[3:54:21.160 --> 3:54:23.160]  When you know what
[3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:25.160]  Everybody will know the time
[3:54:25.160 --> 3:54:27.160]  But if they bring tyranny far enough
[3:54:27.160 --> 3:54:29.160]  Then you know what to do, ladies and gentlemen
[3:54:29.160 --> 3:54:31.160]  1776
