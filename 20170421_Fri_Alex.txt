[00:00.000 --> 00:17.840]  before America can be great again she must be free again you're listening to
[00:17.840 --> 00:29.960]  the Alex Jones show we are live on this Friday April 21st edition of the Alex
[00:29.960 --> 00:34.360]  Jones show again we have another huge broadcast waiting in the wings in the
[00:34.360 --> 00:39.400]  final hour of the show we have Michael Heaver coming on who is Nigel Farage's
[00:39.400 --> 00:43.640]  former press aide of course we had the surprise announcement of a snap election
[00:43.640 --> 00:48.480]  in the United Kingdom we have a massive election taking place in France at
[00:48.480 --> 00:54.920]  least the first round of it this coming Sunday with Marine Le Pen 20% matched up
[00:54.920 --> 00:58.960]  against the establishment candidate Macron 20% matched up against the far
[00:58.960 --> 01:04.240]  left candidate Melenchon also at 20% all the polls are within the margin of
[01:04.240 --> 01:09.200]  error it could go anyway of course the final round is on May 7th so the two who
[01:09.200 --> 01:13.800]  win the first round get to go through to the final round and what happened
[01:13.800 --> 01:21.040]  yesterday in Paris no surprise to anyone another jihadist terror attack now
[01:21.040 --> 01:25.280]  Donald Trump came out we're gonna go to this clip in a second hours after the
[01:25.280 --> 01:29.680]  attack and said it looks like a terrorist attack after the police had said
[01:29.680 --> 01:35.180]  it was a terrorist attack after the president of France Francois Alon said
[01:35.180 --> 01:40.880]  that it was a terrorist attack but Trump had the temerity the temerity to come
[01:40.880 --> 01:45.880]  out and say that it was a terrorist attack hours after everybody knew it was
[01:45.880 --> 01:50.080]  a terrorist attack let's go to that Trump clip right now
[01:50.080 --> 01:55.320]  well first of all our condolences from our country to the people of France again
[01:55.320 --> 01:59.800]  it's happening it seems I just saw it as I was walking in so that's a terrible
[01:59.800 --> 02:03.880]  thing and I'd say very very terrible thing that's going on in the world today
[02:03.880 --> 02:11.640]  but it looks like another terrorist attack and what can you say just never
[02:11.640 --> 02:15.160]  ends we have to be strong and we have to be vigilant and I've been saying it for
[02:15.160 --> 02:20.920]  a long time so there is Donald Trump again having the nerve to call a terrorist
[02:20.920 --> 02:26.120]  attack a terrorist attack hours after it happened hours after we knew the
[02:26.120 --> 02:30.280]  details the fact that he'd driven up behind the police car waited until they
[02:30.280 --> 02:35.400]  were stationary got out shot them at point blank range with a Kalashnikov
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.880]  rifle but oh no you can't say it's a terrorist attack let's just pretend it's
[02:39.880 --> 02:44.480]  you know maybe it's workplace violence maybe it's a white right-wing
[02:44.480 --> 02:48.400]  extremists who knows then wait until everybody's forgotten about it and move
[02:48.400 --> 02:52.600]  on let's go back to that headline up on info wars.com media again scolds
[02:52.600 --> 02:57.880]  Trump for referring to Paris terrorist attack as a terrorist attack now this
[02:57.880 --> 03:02.920]  goes through AP AP put out a tweet saying Trump calls Paris shooting
[03:02.920 --> 03:07.200]  terrorist attack Paris police have not yet announced a motive well they hadn't
[03:07.200 --> 03:10.880]  announced a motive but they had announced that it was a terrorist attack
[03:10.880 --> 03:16.000]  okay Trump didn't even get into any motive all he said was it looks like a
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.160]  terrorist attack but God forbid anyone can you can't even say Islamic terrorist
[03:21.160 --> 03:25.040]  attack you can't even say terror attack anymore I mean that's how warped it's
[03:25.040 --> 03:31.200]  become this is the same AP remember who on Monday after that Fresno shooting said
[03:31.200 --> 03:36.120]  that the killer who after he had gone down three innocent people in Fresno
[03:36.120 --> 03:40.960]  said Allah Akbar but no you can't say Allah Akbar you can't report the truth
[03:40.960 --> 03:45.960]  of what he actually said they changed it and said that the shooter had said
[03:45.960 --> 03:51.360]  quote God is great oh they they helpfully translated it just just to help
[03:51.360 --> 03:55.080]  everybody out with the understanding of what Allah Akbar means because nobody
[03:55.080 --> 04:00.040]  knows what it means right by now it's only said by terrorists after every
[04:00.040 --> 04:03.920]  single terror attack but nobody knows what it means so the AP has to explain
[04:03.920 --> 04:09.320]  that to us and now it's the AP taking Donald Trump to task for calling a
[04:09.320 --> 04:13.640]  terrorist attack a terrorist attack after the president of France had called it a
[04:13.640 --> 04:19.120]  terrorist attack MSNBC reporters the article continues couldn't hide their
[04:19.120 --> 04:23.680]  utter disdain that Trump would dare to suggest that a terrorist shooting was a
[04:23.680 --> 04:28.760]  likely terrorist attack so you had Chuck Todd up there saying that Trump was
[04:28.760 --> 04:32.120]  getting ahead of the facts despite the fact that the French police were
[04:32.120 --> 04:37.240]  already suggesting the incident was terrorism the Daily Beast Christopher
[04:37.240 --> 04:43.920]  Dickey doing exactly the same absolutely incredible that he's now on the rack for
[04:43.920 --> 04:47.240]  calling it a terrorist attack when everybody else was saying it was a
[04:47.240 --> 04:50.680]  terrorist attack we're gonna get more into it gonna get into how this is
[04:50.680 --> 04:55.400]  gonna play into the French election with Marine Le Pen looking good to get to
[04:55.400 --> 04:59.800]  that second round Alex Jones show live in fours calm we'll be back are your
[04:59.800 --> 05:03.200]  headphones spying on you if you have a new pair of wireless Bose headphones
[05:03.200 --> 05:07.640]  then probably a lawsuit filed in Chicago accuses the sound giant Bose of
[05:07.640 --> 05:11.840]  violating the wiretap act and a variety of privacy loss you see the Bose
[05:11.840 --> 05:16.000]  headphones have an app which allows you more options but this app also serves as
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.800]  a gateway to sharing your metadata to anyone anywhere you agree to terms and
[05:20.800 --> 05:24.440]  conditions on the Bose headphone app they then send whatever data is collected
[05:24.440 --> 05:28.880]  via the app off to a San Francisco based firm called segment which offers to
[05:28.880 --> 05:32.880]  collect all of your customer data and send it anywhere this court case which
[05:32.880 --> 05:36.760]  is said to be worth millions could set a precedent for other potential cases
[05:36.760 --> 05:40.360]  where companies are data mining their customers then selling or moving that
[05:40.360 --> 05:45.440]  data anywhere don't be naive Bose is not the only company doing this a similar
[05:45.440 --> 05:49.920]  lawsuit was settled last month for three point seven five million dollars by a
[05:49.920 --> 05:55.160]  sex toy maker called we vibe all those social media apps are monitoring this
[05:55.160 --> 06:02.000]  case closely for info wars.com I'm Owen shroyer this is Alex Jones I want to

[08:05.080 --> 08:13.840]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show and now your host
[08:13.840 --> 08:24.720]  Paul Joseph Watson so we've had 21 jihadist terror attacks in France since
[08:24.720 --> 08:31.800]  January 2015 alone since the Charlie Hebdo massacre six attacks in Paris in
[08:31.800 --> 08:35.200]  the last three years alone and that's probably playing it down there've
[08:35.200 --> 08:38.440]  probably been other individual incidents which you know come out later
[08:38.440 --> 08:42.080]  were terror attacks but France is getting absolutely blitzed by these
[08:42.080 --> 08:47.840]  incidents almost on a monthly basis now we had another one yesterday one cop
[08:47.840 --> 08:53.960]  dead three people injured after a known extremist who was on a watch list and in
[08:53.960 --> 08:58.160]  fact I think they tried to put him in prison at one point gone down this cop
[08:58.160 --> 09:03.840]  injured another again point blank Kalashnikov shot but Trump is bad
[09:03.840 --> 09:08.040]  Trump is bad because he came out two hours after and said it looks like a
[09:08.040 --> 09:12.480]  terrorist attack that's what we should be outraged about not the fact that these
[09:12.480 --> 09:16.760]  friggin attacks are happening on a monthly basis take Europe as a whole
[09:16.760 --> 09:22.280]  it's almost on a bi-weekly basis now but no don't get upset about that don't
[09:22.280 --> 09:26.160]  look into solutions about that get upset with Donald Trump because he said a
[09:26.160 --> 09:30.080]  terrorist attack was a terrorist attack let's go to this Fox and Friends video
[09:30.080 --> 09:35.080]  about the mainstream media attacking Trump over this instead of focusing on
[09:35.080 --> 09:38.800]  the terror the attack and hitting hitting one of the most famous cities in
[09:38.800 --> 09:44.200]  one of our and impossibly are with no arguably inarguably our first ally
[09:44.200 --> 09:48.400]  instead everyone starts focusing on Donald Trump why did he possibly jump to
[09:48.400 --> 09:51.760]  the inclusion that this is terror that's not the way what a president should be
[09:51.760 --> 09:54.680]  saying first of all the president said I give my condolences to the French
[09:54.680 --> 09:58.120]  people and it looks like another terrorist attack here we go again he said
[09:58.120 --> 10:01.840]  he said it just never it just never ends exactly he's saying it looks like
[10:01.840 --> 10:05.640]  Terry's not definitely calling it terror at that point that's right and so the
[10:05.640 --> 10:10.800]  Associated Press tweeted out almost instantaneously this Trump calls
[10:10.800 --> 10:15.360]  Paris shooting terrorist attack Paris police have not yet announced a motive
[10:15.360 --> 10:20.400]  as if to scold him 11 minutes later they had to admit hey maybe it was right
[10:20.400 --> 10:24.640]  breaking French prosecutors have opened a terrorism investigation into the
[10:24.640 --> 10:28.520]  Shun State at least a attack on Paris police officers meanwhile the same
[10:28.520 --> 10:33.200]  debate was happening over on MSNBC where they just couldn't believe that the
[10:33.200 --> 10:38.400]  president would say it looks like terror when it looked like terror and if you go
[10:38.400 --> 10:41.640]  back to the info wars article which we had up before media against Golds
[10:41.640 --> 10:45.200]  Trump for referring to Paris terrorist attack as terrorist attack and you
[10:45.200 --> 10:49.880]  scroll down you can watch the MSNBC videos in the article where they're
[10:49.880 --> 10:54.760]  decrying Trump for calling it terrorist attack one of the quotes is from one of
[10:54.760 --> 10:58.520]  the MSNBC guests quote well the president is quick to declare it probably a
[10:58.520 --> 11:02.080]  terrorist attack I think it's too soon to know whether that indeed is the case if
[11:02.080 --> 11:05.680]  it turns out that it's not terrorism I think the White House is going to have
[11:05.680 --> 11:11.440]  some explaining to do again this was after the president of France had come
[11:11.440 --> 11:15.000]  out and said this is a terrorist attack after the police had said it was a
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.240]  terrorist attack the basic circumstances of what happened tell you it's a
[11:19.240 --> 11:23.840]  terrorist attack it happened in Paris which has constantly been blitzed
[11:23.840 --> 11:28.360]  bombarded with terrorist attacks absolutely incredible they had another
[11:28.360 --> 11:33.600]  contributor on this MSNBC program daily beast editor Christopher Dickey who
[11:33.600 --> 11:37.520]  launched into an in-depth analysis that pinpointed everything apart from
[11:37.520 --> 11:42.640]  terrorism as the problem and so he didn't talk about the fact that we've had 21
[11:42.640 --> 11:47.440]  jihadist attacks in France since January 2015 six in Paris alone in the past
[11:47.440 --> 11:51.800]  three years he didn't talk about this huge problem about ghettoization of
[11:51.800 --> 11:58.080]  Islamist basically he talked about how Marine Le Pen is a racist well imagine
[11:58.080 --> 12:03.200]  my shock Dickey lamented that the latest attack would embolden Le Pen's anti
[12:03.200 --> 12:08.080]  Muslim very anti-immigrant campaign so again they're more concerned about hurt
[12:08.080 --> 12:13.760]  feelings and lost votes than friends being hit by terror attacks on an almost
[12:13.760 --> 12:19.400]  monthly basis at this point this huge migrant crisis which you see there you
[12:19.400 --> 12:24.360]  know I visited France after the massacre in November 2015 in between that
[12:24.360 --> 12:28.760]  point and December 2015 you could see the difference just in that you know year
[12:28.760 --> 12:33.720]  gap there's mattresses on the streets there are migrants wandering wandering
[12:33.720 --> 12:37.200]  around everywhere you think this is restricted to the Calais migrant camp
[12:37.200 --> 12:42.560]  no way you've got riots on the streets happening now on an almost monthly
[12:42.560 --> 12:47.920]  basis this is a huge problem massive problem not just with terrorist attacks
[12:47.920 --> 12:52.320]  but again with the march through the institutions the growth of sharia law
[12:52.320 --> 12:59.680]  the ghettoization of these communities well let's not forget that the Paris
[12:59.680 --> 13:06.200]  massacre butcher basically Abdeslam escaped into Belgium after the attack he
[13:06.200 --> 13:10.960]  was shielded he was hidden by members of his own community after he'd just been
[13:10.960 --> 13:16.480]  involved in the massacre of 200 plus people they didn't turn him in they
[13:16.480 --> 13:20.800]  sheltered him they gave him protection what was it for months and months after
[13:20.800 --> 13:25.360]  the attack that's what we need to be talking about rooting out the source of
[13:25.360 --> 13:29.000]  this radicalization and why these terrorists are being protected in their
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.240]  own communities but no what we should be upset about is Donald frigging Trump
[13:34.240 --> 13:38.400]  saying that it's terrorism when it's obviously terrorism absolutely
[13:38.400 --> 13:44.360]  incredible you have you know people barreling trucks into children in niece
[13:44.360 --> 13:49.640]  shooting officers officers at point blank range that's not extreme is it no
[13:49.640 --> 13:53.600]  what's extreme is Marine Le Pen's policies because she's a racist because
[13:53.600 --> 13:59.640]  she actually wants to address this problem why do they think that she's so
[13:59.640 --> 14:06.120]  popular even with all the demonization the character assassination because she's
[14:06.120 --> 14:12.080]  the only candidate that's actually proposed policies to deal with this then
[14:12.080 --> 14:14.960]  you look at Macron and we had that headline we just flashed up there we
[14:14.960 --> 14:19.600]  can go back to it this is out of Breitbart French presidential favorite
[14:19.600 --> 14:25.360]  Macron terrorism part of our daily lives for years to come this is the exact same
[14:25.360 --> 14:31.440]  rhetoric we heard out of French Prime Minister Manuel vowels after the niece
[14:31.440 --> 14:37.720]  truck attack where he said French people will just have to learn to live with
[14:37.720 --> 14:42.220]  terrorism it's the exact same rhetoric of complete submission and
[14:42.220 --> 14:47.360]  capitulation Emmanuel Macron the current favorite to win the French
[14:47.360 --> 14:50.560]  presidential election who by the way is a fake populist and was literally
[14:50.560 --> 14:56.600]  created four years ago by Francois Hollande team literally cultivated in
[14:56.600 --> 15:03.080]  the lab there in the Lise Paris in Paris total establishment candidate Ross
[15:03.080 --> 15:08.240]  child banker yet they tried to sell him as a populist French people are finally
[15:08.240 --> 15:13.240]  beginning to realize that he's just another establishment dupe that he's
[15:13.240 --> 15:17.240]  another fake Barack Obama which is why Obama endorsed him which we're gonna
[15:17.240 --> 15:21.760]  get on to but Macron the current favorite has described terrorism as an
[15:21.760 --> 15:26.280]  imponderable problem which will be quote part of our daily lives for years to
[15:26.280 --> 15:32.560]  come speaking to the Guardian imagine my shock the center left leader of on
[15:32.560 --> 15:35.560]  March candidate appeared to echo former Prime Minister Manuel vowels
[15:35.560 --> 15:40.680]  controversial statements following the niece lorry attack on Bastille Day
[15:40.680 --> 15:46.520]  2016 in which a Tunisian migrant mow down 434 men women and children killing
[15:46.520 --> 15:51.520]  87 now that's this is what Val said at the time remember this we report on it
[15:51.520 --> 15:56.520]  this is what Val said after niece their Prime Minister times of change and we
[15:56.520 --> 16:02.040]  should learn to live with terrorism learn to live with trucks barreling down
[16:02.040 --> 16:08.600]  tourist thoroughfares mowing down little kids just live with it just accept it
[16:08.600 --> 16:14.040]  just put up with it are you gonna change your policies allowing millions of
[16:14.040 --> 16:17.880]  these people in who share some of the same beliefs again 20% of Syrian
[16:17.880 --> 16:23.880]  migrants support ISIS he is the Antifa on the streets of Paris they had signed
[16:23.880 --> 16:29.760]  some of them expressing support for terrorists which we've seen before we've
[16:29.760 --> 16:35.440]  even seen that in America with Antifa what did I warn about when ISIS came out
[16:35.440 --> 16:39.960]  with that manual back a year ago saying that they would try to recruit far-left
[16:39.960 --> 16:48.080]  agitators because they broadly share the same goals again Miller militant
[16:48.080 --> 16:53.600]  Antifa radicals who openly use violence to further their political aims and are
[16:53.600 --> 16:58.480]  proud about it that's terrorism that's a very definition of terrorism there you
[16:58.480 --> 17:01.840]  see it gateway pundit ISIS calls the terror lines with radical leftists to
[17:01.840 --> 17:07.120]  conquer Rome dabik the official ISIS magazine we reported on it at the time
[17:07.120 --> 17:13.000]  they said these people share the same beliefs we need to start radicalizing
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.960]  them we need to start giving them weapons now they're on the streets of
[17:16.960 --> 17:26.600]  Paris 500 euros it costs to get an AK-47 on the streets of Paris within hours to
[17:26.600 --> 17:30.680]  conduct massacres like the Paris massacre and nothing is being done
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.680]  Macron fion fion supposedly the conservative candidate the hard-line
[17:35.680 --> 17:40.520]  security guy gets up and rambles about terrorism for 20 minutes offers
[17:40.520 --> 17:45.960]  absolutely no solution Macron says we're just gonna have to live with it
[17:45.960 --> 17:51.640]  Melanchon the far left candidates even worse but who's got an actual policy to
[17:51.640 --> 17:57.880]  deal with it Marine Le Pen headline Marine Le Pen restore France's border and
[17:57.880 --> 18:02.880]  expel foreigners on watch lists again the guy who carried out the attack yesterday
[18:02.880 --> 18:05.480]  was on one of these watch lists in the wake of Thursday's terror attack
[18:05.480 --> 18:09.120]  France presidential candidate Marine Le Pen call for France who immediately
[18:09.120 --> 18:13.920]  expel all foreigners on watch list and reinstate their borders she said as
[18:13.920 --> 18:18.360]  elected president of Larry public I would immediately and with no hesitation
[18:18.360 --> 18:22.080]  carry out the battle plan against Islamist terrorism and against judicial
[18:22.080 --> 18:27.600]  laxity the sympathizers of Islamist should be fought for 10 years we have
[18:27.600 --> 18:31.880]  seen this happening Le Pen said the release of terrorist Kareem Turofi by
[18:31.880 --> 18:37.160]  state prosecutors is quote the symbol of the failure of politics in this country
[18:37.160 --> 18:44.540]  they had the guy he was on an extremist watch list you know he was
[18:44.540 --> 18:50.000]  arrested before for plotting to attack police that's exactly what he did in
[18:50.000 --> 18:56.880]  this instance but again Emmanuel Macron says just learn to live with it learn
[18:56.880 --> 19:03.080]  to live with terrorism on the streets of France on the streets of Europe he also
[19:03.080 --> 19:08.240]  says they see skynes what we know about Sean's Lise government as Paris home
[19:08.240 --> 19:13.560]  raided again they had him on the watch list he'd previously been flagged as an
[19:13.560 --> 19:17.240]  extremist to authorities and had a conviction for shooting at two police
[19:17.240 --> 19:24.080]  officers he carried out tried to carry out this exact same attack before the
[19:24.080 --> 19:28.600]  man suspected of carrying out the Sean's Lise attack was detained and freed in
[19:28.600 --> 19:35.200]  February for threatening to kill police absolutely insane Marine Le Pen says we
[19:35.200 --> 19:39.280]  need to deport these people on watch list if they're French citizens we need to
[19:39.280 --> 19:44.480]  put them in prison not let them go over and over again but Emmanuel Macron the

[24:38.120 --> 24:43.040]  judicial source said the hardline militant group claimed the attack which
[24:43.040 --> 24:46.960]  also wounded two other police officers so they found the note right next to him
[24:46.960 --> 24:52.440]  the police came out and said I was following it live on Twitter before
[24:52.440 --> 24:56.480]  Trump gave his speech they said it was a terrorist attack before Trump gave his
[24:56.480 --> 25:00.560]  speech Alon came out and said it was a terrorist attack but Donald Trump is bad
[25:00.560 --> 25:04.720]  for saying it's a terrorist attack absolutely incredible now sky news is
[25:04.720 --> 25:10.200]  reporting the response to this Paris shooting 50,000 troops and police
[25:10.200 --> 25:14.360]  mobilized after Sean's a lazy attack more than 50,000 police and soldiers
[25:14.360 --> 25:17.880]  have been fully mobilized probably were already given that it's happening
[25:17.880 --> 25:20.920]  virtually every week now after the killer killing of a police officer in
[25:20.920 --> 25:26.600]  Paris and days before the country's presidential election so they got 50,000
[25:26.600 --> 25:30.640]  troops out on the streets again but they're still gonna be importing hundreds
[25:30.640 --> 25:35.000]  of thousands of these people who then ghetto eyes into these are Islamists no
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.120]  go areas and continue the radicalization that's not gonna be
[25:39.120 --> 25:44.120]  addressed not if Macron wins at any rate but now they've got 50,000 troops out on
[25:44.120 --> 25:49.200]  the streets you know yeah on the police but bullets aren't gonna stop an
[25:49.200 --> 25:53.000]  ideology you have to get to the root of the ideology you have to elect someone
[25:53.000 --> 26:00.240]  who has actual policies to address it and that's Marine Le Pen this is up on
[26:00.240 --> 26:05.880]  4wars.com right now Le Pen responds shut down Paris mosques to stop terror
[26:05.880 --> 26:09.120]  French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has called for a crackdown on
[26:09.120 --> 26:13.120]  terrorism in her country with a specific focus on Islamists and foreigners
[26:13.120 --> 26:17.680]  with terror ties and the expulsion of radical imams and the closure of Islamic
[26:17.680 --> 26:23.680]  mosques she has an actual policy to deal with it she has a policy to deal with it
[26:23.680 --> 26:28.280]  in terms of prison radicalization which is where a lot of this happens as well
[26:28.280 --> 26:34.440]  it happens in the schools you had a poll out of France a few weeks ago we did an
[26:34.440 --> 26:39.680]  article on it I think it was upwards of what was it a third of Muslim students
[26:39.680 --> 26:46.280]  in these schools support terrorism 33% support violent actions to further a
[26:46.280 --> 26:50.440]  political goal the very definition of terrorism so it's not just about the
[26:50.440 --> 26:55.280]  mosques it's about the kids at the educational level are being brainwashed
[26:55.280 --> 26:59.960]  with this absolutely insane you're not just going to stop it by putting armed
[26:59.960 --> 27:05.720]  soldiers on the streets this is the march through the institutions as soon as
[27:05.720 --> 27:10.760]  you get past six seven percent Muslim population in France you start to have
[27:10.760 --> 27:16.360]  problems it happens in every European country it's happening in Sweden but
[27:16.360 --> 27:21.120]  what's Emmanuel Macron solution well this is out of Sputnik Macron supports
[27:21.120 --> 27:26.880]  strikes against alleged chemical weapons storages in Syria so he wants to bomb the
[27:26.880 --> 27:32.360]  people who are fighting ISIS he wants to bomb the people who are fighting the
[27:32.360 --> 27:37.440]  terrorists who are committing acts of murder on the streets of Paris on a
[27:37.440 --> 27:41.920]  regular basis that's his solution that's the establishment candidate
[27:41.920 --> 27:47.280]  Emmanuel Macron he wants to bomb the people who are fighting ISIS he said
[27:47.280 --> 27:51.360]  quote I am ready for us to take on our responsibilities under the UN mandate that
[27:51.360 --> 27:54.640]  is to say targeted strikes to destroy stocks of chemical weapons in Syria
[27:54.640 --> 28:01.600]  Macron said on France to TV late last night Macron remains in the lead he's
[28:01.600 --> 28:07.040]  still in the lead he's still fooling people with this fake populist act now
[28:07.040 --> 28:12.480]  calling to bomb Bashar al-Assad's quote chemical stockpiles which he's
[28:12.480 --> 28:18.480]  supposedly relinquished back in 2013 no independent investigation of this chemical
[28:18.480 --> 28:23.200]  weapons attack that happened a few weeks ago we know in the past the rebels were
[28:23.200 --> 28:27.400]  given the weapons by Saudi Arabia mishandled them that happened in
[28:27.400 --> 28:32.080]  Ghouta Robert Perry all these top experts Seymour Hirsch Pulitzer prize-winning
[28:32.080 --> 28:36.640]  journalist came out and said the rebels staged that attack did they stage this
[28:36.640 --> 28:42.000]  attack again we haven't got answers to that but Macron the establishment
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.720]  candidate is just out saying we need to bomb the people who are fighting ISIS
[28:46.720 --> 28:52.520]  that is his solution to these massacres that happening on a bi-weekly basis now
[28:52.520 --> 28:57.120]  almost across Europe they're gonna continue to happen if you follow the
[28:57.120 --> 29:03.320]  same disastrous policies of capitulation and submission I mean I've got an image
[29:03.320 --> 29:07.280]  posted on my Twitter account I sent it if you can flash it up of a guy walking
[29:07.280 --> 29:12.800]  down a street in France draped in an ISIS flag just walking down the street
[29:12.800 --> 29:16.840]  nonchalantly in France you can see the signs in France it's on my Twitter if
[29:16.840 --> 29:22.840]  you want to pull it up again nobody seems to care people just in the cafe look
[29:22.840 --> 29:28.600]  there it is that is France great in an ISIS flag just casually walking down the
[29:28.600 --> 29:33.520]  street nobody says a word it happened in London in Westminster they questioned the
[29:33.520 --> 29:40.000]  guy let him go if somebody was draped in a Nazi flag walking down the street
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.320]  would anyone say anything absolutely insane we'll be back with more on the

[30:03.960 --> 30:09.600]  conservative commentator Ann Coulter speaking event citing safety concerns
[30:09.600 --> 30:14.160]  Coulter did say that the university tried to reschedule the event in short
[30:14.160 --> 30:18.880]  notice for a later date on May 2nd which would be during dead week when
[30:18.880 --> 30:24.280]  students are not even in class as they prep for finals so essentially Berkeley

[33:03.440 --> 33:10.160]  broadcasting live from the UN stronghold Austin Texas you're listening to the
[33:10.160 --> 33:25.880]  alex jones show and now your host paul joseph what's and we are back live on
[33:25.880 --> 33:31.280]  the alex jones show so again we had MSNBC up there railing on donald trump for
[33:31.280 --> 33:34.960]  daring to say this was a terrorist attack you had died their guests on there
[33:34.960 --> 33:40.600]  saying that it was marine lapen who was bad for her extremist rhetoric it was
[33:40.600 --> 33:44.400]  donald trump who was bad for saying it was a terrorist attack everyone's bad
[33:44.400 --> 33:48.400]  apart from the actual terrorists that carried out the attack no let's not
[33:48.400 --> 33:53.480]  analyze that ideology let's analyze marine lapen's ideology the only candidate
[33:53.480 --> 33:59.080]  who has actual policies to address this let's put her on the rack they see
[33:59.080 --> 34:03.520]  daily beast doing the same thing that's all they bothered about the votes in fact
[34:03.520 --> 34:07.800]  skynews went further they even suggested that it could have been a you know a
[34:07.800 --> 34:12.280]  white right winger false flagging this attack it's not a conspiracy theory when
[34:12.280 --> 34:17.560]  they say it by the way to help marine lapen so we have absolute insanity in
[34:17.560 --> 34:21.880]  the aftermath you know ostrich stick your head in the sand behavior again and
[34:21.880 --> 34:27.160]  again and again people saying oh we're so courageous we're gonna just continue
[34:27.160 --> 34:31.080]  with life as normal we're gonna walk down the street as normal because the
[34:31.080 --> 34:34.640]  terrorists won't change our way of life well they already have changed your way
[34:34.640 --> 34:38.040]  of life it's the march through the institutions it's not just the terror
[34:38.040 --> 34:42.360]  attack you can't just stick your head in the sand and hope it goes away you
[34:42.360 --> 34:46.920]  don't change society by turning it into a police state by putting a prison camp
[34:46.920 --> 34:53.520]  around Paris you change it by cutting off the evil ideology at the source which
[34:53.520 --> 34:59.680]  is Islamism which is what Emmanuel Macron the establishment candidate has
[34:59.680 --> 35:04.360]  embraced basically by saying we're just gonna live with this this is a routine
[35:04.360 --> 35:11.720]  part of our lives by now calling for the people in Syria fighting ISIS to be
[35:11.720 --> 35:17.240]  attacked Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian army absolutely incredible now of course
[35:17.240 --> 35:21.440]  we had the whole Russia interfered in the US election narrative which ran for
[35:21.440 --> 35:25.240]  months and months and months that seems to have died down now in the aftermath
[35:25.240 --> 35:30.400]  of the bombing of Syria the Tomahawk missile attacks but again the narrative
[35:30.400 --> 35:35.240]  was established foreign interference in elections outside interference in foreign
[35:35.240 --> 35:41.000]  elections is terrible it's reprehensible we should really stop that well what is
[35:41.000 --> 35:47.440]  Barack Obama doing yet again he's interfering in a foreign election of
[35:47.440 --> 35:52.040]  course he tried to interfere fear in Brexit got up with David Cameron gave a
[35:52.040 --> 35:56.200]  speech try to manipulate people that way now he's interfering in the French
[35:56.200 --> 36:01.760]  election to stop populist Marine Le Pen he had a nice little friendly call and
[36:01.760 --> 36:06.840]  an endorsement for the establishment candidate Emmanuel Macron in fact we
[36:06.840 --> 36:12.720]  have that clip let's roll that right now I have the president Barack Obama for
[36:12.720 --> 36:17.840]  you hold on one second thank you very much hello hello mr. president how are
[36:17.840 --> 36:24.720]  you Emmanuel yeah exactly well I'm doing very well how are you can you hear
[36:24.720 --> 36:31.040]  me yes I hear you very well the main message I have is to wish you all the
[36:31.040 --> 36:37.200]  best in the in the coming days and make sure that as you said you work hard all
[36:37.200 --> 36:41.000]  the way through because you never know it might be that last day of campaigning
[36:41.000 --> 36:49.760]  but yeah I do agree I will do my best believe me and and and and so I will
[36:49.760 --> 36:54.960]  fight is the last minute and we will we will keep it in touch and our teams
[36:54.960 --> 36:59.880]  will will I as in order to organize and a new contact and see how to work
[36:59.880 --> 37:05.000]  together if I'm going to the runoff thank you very much I do appreciate you
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.680]  took the time but what so there you have it Barack Obama endorsing the
[37:10.680 --> 37:14.760]  establishment candidate Macron who again they tried to introduce as a populist
[37:14.760 --> 37:20.320]  remember Obama's hope and change back in 2007 2008 they tried to do the exact
[37:20.320 --> 37:25.040]  same thing with Macron they tried to pretend that he was this authentic
[37:25.040 --> 37:31.440]  grassroots candidate when in reality his whole campaign was hatched from within
[37:31.440 --> 37:37.880]  the Elise palace in the capital of France four years ago by Francois
[37:37.880 --> 37:43.160]  Hollande who will endorse Macron if he makes it to the second round again it's
[37:43.160 --> 37:47.560]  a two-round runoff basically Marine Le Pen has to win the first round if she
[37:47.560 --> 37:52.520]  comes second she's not going to have the momentum to carry her through to take
[37:52.520 --> 37:57.520]  the presidency she has to come first in the first round but again it's a
[37:57.520 --> 38:02.320]  complete toss-up at this point you have four major candidates about all on 20
[38:02.320 --> 38:06.520]  percent roughly the polls are all within the margin of error you have Macron the
[38:06.520 --> 38:10.920]  establishment candidate you have Le Pen the nationalist you have Malenche on the
[38:10.920 --> 38:16.360]  far leftist who is the French Hugo Chávez endorsed by the Communist Party
[38:16.360 --> 38:21.520]  and you have Francois Fillon the more establishment conservative who again
[38:21.520 --> 38:26.680]  waffles on about security and terrorism he has offered no actual policies to
[38:26.680 --> 38:32.080]  deal with it no forceful policies like Marine Le Pen so this is absolutely
[38:32.080 --> 38:35.480]  huge if Marine Le Pen wins and of course they're saying oh she's going to be
[38:35.480 --> 38:39.200]  defeated in the second round easily just like Brexit wouldn't happen just like
[38:39.200 --> 38:44.200]  Trump wouldn't happen if she wins it could be the death knell for the European
[38:44.200 --> 38:49.920]  Union and now the analysts who predicted Trump's ascendancy bets on Le Pen's win
[38:49.920 --> 38:54.200]  this is out of Bloomberg markets are underpricing the prospects of Marine
[38:54.200 --> 38:58.720]  Le Pen emerging victorious in the French election as a sea of undecided
[38:58.720 --> 39:02.600]  voters throws into sharp relief pronounced apathy for center leftist
[39:02.600 --> 39:07.520]  Emmanuel Macron they're finally starting to figure out that he is basically the
[39:07.520 --> 39:12.280]  French Tony Blair he's the frontrunner by a whisker right now but there's a
[39:12.280 --> 39:16.640]  backlash brewing against the European Union project that's the conclusion
[39:16.640 --> 39:21.760]  just drawn by Charles Gave who accurately predicted the triumph of
[39:21.760 --> 39:24.720]  Donald Trump in the US election and is now betting on a win for the anti-
[39:24.720 --> 39:29.560]  euro national front candidate quote Le Pen's momentum is a slow-moving
[39:29.560 --> 39:34.000]  reaction against the men of Davos as we have seen with Brexit and Trump but
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.320]  markets don't want to believe it he said by phone before the first round of the
[39:38.320 --> 39:43.980]  French poll on April 23rd which is on Sunday so a lot of those analysts were
[39:43.980 --> 39:49.120]  kind of discredited weren't they before the US election a lot of the people who
[39:49.120 --> 39:53.040]  came out and said no the indications are the algorithms are showing that Donald
[39:53.040 --> 39:57.120]  Trump will sweep to victory meanwhile on the flip side you had the New York
[39:57.120 --> 40:00.680]  Times the Huffington Post you know you saw the polls you saw the tweets
[40:00.680 --> 40:06.160]  Hillary Clinton 95 98% chance of winning meanwhile if you actually look at
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.600]  these AI models which were proven accurate when Donald Trump was elected
[40:10.600 --> 40:16.360]  months beforehand professors that had predicted successfully the winner of the
[40:16.360 --> 40:21.040]  US presidential election time and time again they were all saying that Trump
[40:21.040 --> 40:24.960]  would win they were proven right some of the same people are saying that Le
[40:24.960 --> 40:29.240]  Pen would win but still you have this narrative in the media she can't win
[40:29.240 --> 40:35.580]  she can't win we will see will French people be cow-towed by this character
[40:35.580 --> 40:40.560]  assassination I would say they're more likely to be manipulated by it given the
[40:40.560 --> 40:45.120]  history of that country obviously what happened during the Second World War it's
[40:45.120 --> 40:51.240]  more easy to taint her with that brush and discredit her campaign that way we
[40:51.240 --> 40:55.720]  will see if that is successful but at the moment the polls are showing absolute
[40:55.720 --> 41:01.480]  tied neck and neck in France between these four candidates now of course
[41:01.480 --> 41:04.960]  before the terrorist attack yesterday in Paris which was a terrorist attack
[41:04.960 --> 41:08.640]  Donald Trump was right to call it a terrorist attack we had another foiled
[41:08.640 --> 41:13.400]  terror plot this is out of Breitbart front-nationale Le Pen was likely
[41:13.400 --> 41:18.080]  target of foiled terror plot so this could have been connected the article
[41:18.080 --> 41:21.280]  states in the aftermath of the foiled terror plot against French presidential
[41:21.280 --> 41:25.520]  candidates the anti mass migration front-nationale have claimed Marine Le Pen
[41:25.520 --> 41:30.320]  may have been the target in reaction to the foiled attacks Republican Francois
[41:30.320 --> 41:34.760]  Fion and socialist Benoit Hamon have said they hope people will not be
[41:34.760 --> 41:38.720]  deterred from voting well in fact Fion has said we should just suspend the
[41:38.720 --> 41:43.680]  election at least at this point which is insane the anti mass migration national
[41:43.680 --> 41:46.640]  front has claimed that their candidate Marine Le Pen was likely a target source
[41:46.640 --> 41:52.000]  from Le Pen's entourage and remember this happened in Holland with their
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.880]  election with their right-wing candidate as well a source told the paper the fact
[41:56.880 --> 42:00.880]  that two individuals were arrested in Marseille while Marine Le Pen is holding
[42:00.880 --> 42:05.880]  a meeting of the net on the next day is perhaps not a coincidence a security
[42:05.880 --> 42:09.240]  source within the FN noted the Union of Islamic Organisations of France had
[42:09.240 --> 42:16.640]  singled out Le Pen as the candidate to be and yet you still see people on MSNBC
[42:16.640 --> 42:22.640]  on Sky News suggesting that Islamists are carrying out these attacks even some
[42:22.640 --> 42:25.880]  suggesting that it's a false flag but some saying Islamists are carrying out
[42:25.880 --> 42:31.840]  these attacks because they want Marine Le Pen to win even though she's the only
[42:31.840 --> 42:36.080]  one whose policies will stop them getting into the country in the first
[42:36.080 --> 42:41.360]  place of course they don't want Marine Le Pen to win they want the socialist soft
[42:41.360 --> 42:45.800]  touch they want someone like Macron who's basically embraced the fact that
[42:45.800 --> 42:50.320]  France is now going to have to live with terrorism for years and years to come
[42:50.320 --> 42:56.240]  while saying that he will bomb a support coalition bombing of the people in
[42:56.240 --> 43:00.880]  Syria who are actually fighting ISIS absolutely incredible the election the
[43:00.880 --> 43:05.200]  first round is this Sunday it's going to be huge it's nationalism versus
[43:05.200 --> 43:10.640]  globalism Axios reports how Trump and Brexit could predict the French
[43:10.640 --> 43:15.880]  elections again another source saying despite the narrative that she has no
[43:15.880 --> 43:19.880]  chance in the second round this could happen Axios's Steve Levine a long-time
[43:19.880 --> 43:24.640]  foreign correspondent for the big papers sees a quote better than 50-50
[43:24.640 --> 43:29.080]  chance Le Pen goes all the way based partly on the rule of threes following
[43:29.080 --> 43:34.280]  the upset victories for Trump and Brexit he said quote the first round is a tight
[43:34.280 --> 43:38.120]  race amongst four candidates and one of them John Luke Mellon Sean who is the
[43:38.120 --> 43:42.640]  communist backed Hugo Chavez of France is every bit the firebranders Le Pen
[43:42.640 --> 43:48.120]  only from the far left so that's another possibility now Mellon Sean for all
[43:48.120 --> 43:53.400]  his faults he actually wants to reduce working hours in France from 35 hours a
[43:53.400 --> 43:58.680]  week to 32 if you can believe that because the French economy isn't anemic
[43:58.680 --> 44:04.160]  enough French youth unemployment which is at 25% that's not high enough we
[44:04.160 --> 44:08.360]  need to bump that up even more by instituting these more draconian work
[44:08.360 --> 44:13.040]  hours he's bad on many issues he's terrible but on one issue he's good
[44:13.040 --> 44:16.800]  again he wants to get out of the EU he wants to have a frexit the French
[44:16.800 --> 44:21.960]  referendum are exiting the EU he's not a fan of the bureaucratic globalist
[44:21.960 --> 44:27.000]  European Union so you could have a situation where Le Pen and Mellon Sean
[44:27.000 --> 44:31.960]  win the first round they come one and two in what in whatever order then they
[44:31.960 --> 44:37.000]  go on to face-off in the second round on May 7th so either way you will get some
[44:37.000 --> 44:41.440]  kind of populist face-off I mean if you being generous to Mellon Sean you would
[44:41.440 --> 44:44.560]  say he was the French Bernie Sanders other people call him the French Hugo
[44:44.560 --> 44:49.880]  Chavez but at least you would have an actual real fight to authentic candidates
[44:49.880 --> 44:54.800]  from the left and the right but they're probably gonna want Macron in there so
[44:54.800 --> 44:59.680]  manipulation is happening right now we had Facebook come out and Google come out
[44:59.680 --> 45:04.480]  and I think I talked about this on Monday said they would educate the French
[45:04.480 --> 45:08.640]  people on fake news and how they were being misled which of course means
[45:08.640 --> 45:13.560]  Google is gonna change its algorithm they're gonna manipulate millions and
[45:13.560 --> 45:17.880]  millions of French people undecided voters and there's a huge number of
[45:17.880 --> 45:23.080]  them they're gonna be manipulated in the crucial days and hours leading up to
[45:23.080 --> 45:27.000]  this vote there you see our Bloomberg Facebook starts to educate users on how
[45:27.000 --> 45:32.520]  to spot fake news they're just gonna lend people a helping hand oh and by the
[45:32.520 --> 45:37.080]  way we've shut down 30,000 Facebook accounts a lot of which were aligned
[45:37.080 --> 45:42.560]  we're supporting Marine Le Pen what a surprise that is they see YouTube
[45:42.560 --> 45:46.200]  offering fake news workshops to teenagers we're gonna get into that later
[45:46.200 --> 45:51.960]  because I know exactly the real agenda behind that so this election is huge it's
[45:51.960 --> 45:56.920]  nationalism versus globalism first round on Monday the terror attack how will
[45:56.920 --> 46:01.280]  that affect voters terror attacks on an almost weekly basis in France how will
[46:01.280 --> 46:07.920]  that affect voters gonna be massive and in fact I've got a French political
[46:07.920 --> 46:10.480]  analysts coming in on Monday to talk about it so we've got that to look
[46:10.480 --> 46:16.920]  forward to as well sticking in Europe though Sweden did you hear about what
[46:16.920 --> 46:20.560]  happened last night in Sweden did you hear about what happens every night in
[46:20.560 --> 46:26.240]  Sweden riots gang shootouts people being kicked out of these Islamic ghetto
[46:26.240 --> 46:30.160]  areas it's all going down of course we had the Stockholm terror attack a couple
[46:30.160 --> 46:35.080]  of weeks ago another truck attack thankfully wasn't as bad as it could
[46:35.080 --> 46:39.440]  have been a braver individual swerved his vehicle in front of the truck
[46:39.440 --> 46:44.200]  preventing further carnage but now we have somebody who's put up a video and
[46:44.200 --> 46:50.120]  we can flip to this in a second this is they go into a rich area a rich suburb
[46:50.120 --> 46:56.320]  of Sweden and they start blaring out the call to prayer the Islamic call to
[46:56.320 --> 47:02.240]  prayer through the through the megaphone the people don't know how to react but
[47:02.240 --> 47:06.240]  again most of them probably would capitulate at this point it's actually
[47:06.240 --> 47:11.040]  surprising how a couple of these people do react this is multiculturalism
[47:11.040 --> 47:17.480]  arrives at a rich Swedish neighborhood and I'll talk over it here's the clip
[47:17.480 --> 47:23.160]  so they've driven up to this well-to-do Swedish neighborhood they've got the
[47:23.160 --> 47:27.360]  loudspeakers on the trucks they're blaring out the Islamic call to prayer
[47:27.360 --> 47:32.880]  to see how Swedes react because Swedes are very welcoming of cultural
[47:32.880 --> 47:38.280]  enrichment very welcoming of mass immigration so this one guy responds
[47:38.280 --> 47:42.200]  and bearing in mind this is like 6 a.m. in the morning starts filming them on
[47:42.200 --> 47:45.840]  his phone good morning bourgeois standing there filming is what is the
[47:45.840 --> 47:50.000]  problem the guys with the loudspeakers that's multiculturalism is here you
[47:50.000 --> 47:55.680]  voted for it yourself could it be that you are xenophobic as he can are you
[47:55.680 --> 48:01.120]  against the multicultural society then a woman appears what the bleep it's six
[48:01.120 --> 48:05.240]  o'clock in the morning good morning the multicultural society has arrived you
[48:05.240 --> 48:12.800]  voted for it she lets them know know what she thinks about it we will do
[48:12.800 --> 48:19.680]  everything in our power to open asylum accommodation on your street this is a
[48:19.680 --> 48:27.120]  6 a.m. broadcast call to prayer on a rich well-to-do Swedish suburb just to see
[48:27.120 --> 48:32.040]  how they respond to it bearing in mind Islamists in London have called for this
[48:32.040 --> 48:36.360]  to be made legal for them to broadcast this at 6 a.m. on the streets of London
[48:36.360 --> 48:39.760]  so the police arrived what is happening here the multicultural society has
[48:39.760 --> 48:44.480]  arrived to these neighborhoods isn't it pleasant the police say the music is
[48:44.480 --> 48:48.080]  deserving the peace they respond this can happen with multiculturalism
[48:48.080 --> 48:54.120]  sometimes it's disturbing so it appears that Swedes aren't really fans of
[48:54.120 --> 48:59.320]  cultural enrichment when it comes to their doorstep they're all good and
[48:59.320 --> 49:03.560]  well to virtue signal about it on Facebook and Twitter and hold up
[49:03.560 --> 49:07.560]  refugee welcome signs but when you actually bring it to their doorstep the
[49:07.560 --> 49:13.600]  reality of what that means not so big fans of it and again we've covered the
[49:13.600 --> 49:18.080]  articles before in London these Islamic mosques in East London which are
[49:18.080 --> 49:23.320]  basically 80 90% Muslim population at this point they want the law to be
[49:23.320 --> 49:27.720]  changed so they can broadcast the Islamic call to prayer just like you heard in
[49:27.720 --> 49:32.920]  that video at 6 a.m. now some of the councils there have shown signs that

[1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:29.920]  of the alex jones show now a lot of you've probably been following the on
[1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:35.800]  again off again situation with and cool to speech at Berkeley of course several
[1:00:35.800 --> 1:00:40.080]  months ago we had Milo try to give a speech that ended in absolute bedlam and
[1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:44.320]  chaos Berkeley has made it clear repeatedly that they don't stand behind
[1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:48.960]  the First Amendment unless you're spouting far left regressive social
[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:53.040]  justice warrior rhetoric then you can do whatever you want but god forbid you
[1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:56.280]  would commit the thought crime of having a different opinion because we don't
[1:00:56.280 --> 1:00:59.760]  want to actually celebrate and embrace diversity of opinion and thought in
[1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:05.400]  universities do we god forbid and cool to calls Berkeley's bluff administrators
[1:01:05.400 --> 1:01:10.440]  reverse decision to cancel speech the pressure has worked but they're still
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:14.120]  trying to reschedule it and cool to wants to do it on the originally
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:19.800]  scheduled date of April 27th if the Berkeley police actually did their job
[1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:23.760]  which they didn't in this case which they didn't during the battle of Berkeley
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:29.000]  last weekend then the situation would be a whole lot easier wouldn't it let's go
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:33.760]  to and cool to on Sean Hannity now talking about Berkeley's reversal here's
[1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:38.200]  the clip I think that Berkeley just want for one thing they are so completely
[1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:44.440]  insulated obviously they were stung by all these lefties around the country
[1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:48.880]  saying well no even though you're a university campus and you seem to have
[1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:53.040]  abandoned all constitutional rights or concept of free speech you have to let
[1:01:53.040 --> 1:01:57.440]  you have to let people speak you can't discriminate them against them on the
[1:01:57.440 --> 1:02:03.160]  basis of viewpoint no you cannot impose arbitrary and harassing restrictions on
[1:02:03.160 --> 1:02:07.680]  the exercise of a constitutional right I don't happen to be available on May
[1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:12.520]  2nd moreover there are a lot of great reporters in San Francisco I think they
[1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:17.120]  might want to ask Janet Napolitano this is she willing to have even if this
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:22.200]  were possible to pay the hundreds of thousands of dollars in rescheduled
[1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:28.960]  rebooked hotel rooms flights for me my security my guests was it been sent to
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:33.880]  Fox required to reschedule randomly when they cancelled originally they said
[1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:37.200]  they'd reschedule for September now it should they just pick another date out
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:43.240]  of the out of the hat none of this has to do with security after exceeding to
[1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:47.880]  all of their requirements which were also arbitrary and silly and they
[1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:52.600]  claimed it was on the basis of safety I suggested two measures that actually would
[1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:57.680]  allow free speech to exist on Berkeley if they wanted it to and that was one
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:02.520]  thing to announce that any students caught engaging in violence may him or
[1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:09.400]  disrupting an invited speakers speech would be expelled and number two to have
[1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:14.000]  a little talk with the Berkeley chief of police who was allowing these Rodney
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:18.640]  King riots to go on whenever a conservative speaker speaks this is a
[1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:24.520]  form you know I mean it is anarchy when you are only enforcing the law in
[1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:29.760]  order to allow liberals to speak but no we'll let we'll let these masked riders
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:34.640]  show up with with with with weapons and start I mean they are all little beta
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:38.320]  males but with a weapon even a beta male can do some damage especially to a
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:44.320]  99 pound girl to have it to have them stepping in those private individuals
[1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:48.520]  according to courts are acting under color of state law and for the police to
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:54.040]  refuse to protect even even offensive speech and by the way I mean author of
[1:03:54.040 --> 1:03:58.000]  12 New York Times bestsellers this is damaged my reputation for them to be
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.040]  acting like I'm David Duke out there but courts have found even somebody out
[1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:07.040]  burning an American flag the police cannot stand by and let skinheads beat
[1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:12.760]  them up that is viewpoint discrimination that double standard isn't it if the
[1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:16.840]  police does just did their job and treated everyone equally we wouldn't
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:19.880]  have a problem here look at what happened in Auburn with Richard Spencer's
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:26.040]  speech a few days ago the cops did their job they broke up the fights they
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:31.400]  forced Antifa to de-mask before they even got to the area if the cops in
[1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:35.120]  Berkeley simply did their job this wouldn't be an issue don't allow the
[1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:40.520]  chicken-necked Antifa thugs to burn things down and violently attack people
[1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:44.440]  then everybody can have their free speech and this is not even going to be
[1:04:44.440 --> 1:04:49.920]  an argument just do your damn job and be police officers and allow the First
[1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:53.560]  Amendment to be expressed we will be back live on the Alex Jones show with
[1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:58.840]  more breaking news info wars dot com don't go away
[1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:03.760]  UC Berkeley which has been the battleground for free speech has canceled
[1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:09.400]  conservative commentator and Coulter speaking event citing safety concerns
[1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:13.960]  Coulter did say that the university tried to reschedule the event in short
[1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:18.720]  notice for a later date on May 2nd which would be during dead week when
[1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:24.120]  students are not even in class as they prep for finals so essentially Berkeley
[1:05:24.120 --> 1:05:29.440]  is appeasing the temper tantrum throwing Antifa by canceling conservative
[1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:34.200]  speaker events that were properly invited by recognized student groups
[1:05:34.200 --> 1:05:37.880]  Coulter has stated that she plans to speak at Berkeley despite the

[1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:27.120]  we're live into the second hour of the Alex Jones show we're talking about Ann
[1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:31.200]  Coulter and her speech at Berkeley which was originally scheduled again for
[1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:36.280]  April 27th they tried to cancel it huge amount of pressure they had to back off
[1:08:36.280 --> 1:08:40.320]  now they're trying to rearrange it for a different date Ann Coulter is refusing
[1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:45.360]  to back down we also have Howard Dean the former presidential candidate coming
[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:49.760]  out and saying hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment that's
[1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:54.640]  the headline Howard Dean in a tweet the former Vermont governor and DNC chair
[1:08:54.640 --> 1:08:59.320]  said quote hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment that was his
[1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:03.840]  tweet news flash for Howard Dean there's no exception in the First Amendment
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:08.680]  everything goes also the Supreme Court has ruled over and over again that hate
[1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:13.480]  speech is part of free speech of course we know that according to a leftist hate
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:18.440]  speeches disagreeing with their opinion so that's why it's important to remain
[1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:21.600]  part of the First Amendment but according to Howard Dean he doesn't know
[1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:25.480]  the Constitution he doesn't know the history of Supreme Court rulings he
[1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:28.880]  says hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment he got absolutely
[1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:34.560]  rinsed over that tweet and rightly so Leanne McAdoo we're talking about Ann
[1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:38.960]  Coulter I mean if as I was saying before the break if the cops in Berkeley just
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:42.160]  did their job this wouldn't be a problem right exactly that's what we saw in
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:47.200]  Auburn where they at least made Antifa take off their masks saying listen we'll
[1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:50.560]  let you in the event you can even take your little rioting sticks in there with
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:54.960]  you but you're gonna be unmasked you're going to be open and available to get
[1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:59.760]  surveilled and have you will have you on video so if you want to pull any stunts
[1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:04.600]  or you know we've got the Antifa group selling concealed knives on their
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:09.120]  website so if you want to go stab people beat them with bike locks we're gonna
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:12.000]  be able to track you down and find out who you are there's gonna be some
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.880]  consequences there was actually an article up today of America Mirror and
[1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:20.720]  they put up an interesting video the headline is mystery did Berkeley police
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:24.840]  fire stun grenades at Trump supporters instigate clash and it's an
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:29.480]  interesting video they claim in this video that some of the so-called flash
[1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:33.720]  bangs or fireworks that were you know fired towards Trump supporters during
[1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:38.120]  that clash were actually fired by the police standing on a nearby building
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:42.520]  that they actually wanted to create this clash between Antifa and Trump
[1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:46.160]  supporters again total opposition to what happened at Auburn which was the
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:50.320]  police actually doing their jobs it seems if this video is true the police
[1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:54.080]  could have actually been inciting that now that's not proven but that's the
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:57.920]  claim being made by that video well of course that would bolster support for
[1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:01.080]  the police to move in and get a little bit more heavy-handed with these
[1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:05.760]  protesters give them because that initially when Milo Yiannopoulos was
[1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:09.920]  there the mayor was in full support of these protesters and then he had to walk
[1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:17.160]  that back once he saw how violent these Antifa protesters were and the fact
[1:11:17.160 --> 1:11:20.600]  that they were burning down their own city beating people up hitting them with
[1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:25.760]  shovels just really violent and then the mayor was like oh okay sorry sorry about
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:30.320]  that my constituents I didn't mean for them to burn the town down and so of
[1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:34.600]  course they're planning this same type of violence with with this and cold or
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:38.760]  speech so I can understand the school you know it's finals week or people are
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:42.800]  getting ready for finals we're concerned I'm surprised these progressive leftist
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:46.720]  professors don't just cancel finals all together and give them a credit for
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:50.000]  showing up to these riots well they've actually unmasked some of the
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:53.880]  individuals involved in these riots at Berkeley and some of them are professors
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:12:00.960]  yeah directly they're directly involved in the fighting the the beatings but
[1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:05.320]  yeah I mean it's an interesting video the other aspect of it is of course what
[1:12:05.320 --> 1:12:09.000]  happened at Auburn when the police did their jobs and made Antifa unmasked and
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:13.560]  we played that video earlier on in the week they weren't so keen to get involved
[1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:17.720]  in squabbles when their faces were visible because their whole shtick is
[1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:22.120]  committing crimes exactly that's what they are showing up to do like I said
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:27.120]  they're selling concealed knives on their website so these are knives that
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:31.640]  look like little credit cards so they can take these in and they're for slicing
[1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:38.120]  conservatives this is anarchic it's the very violent driven message and they're
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:43.800]  they're protesting against people that they haven't even read their work I mean
[1:12:43.800 --> 1:12:49.160]  when we had Heather McDonald her speech was heavily fought against there they
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:55.280]  stopped it shut it down it was about law enforcement and how dangerous it is for
[1:12:55.280 --> 1:13:00.760]  people to be actually targeting now the law enforcement and the the black lives
[1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:04.920]  matters shut that down because it was a racist she's racist for saying don't
[1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:08.840]  kill cops that's you can't say that now that's a racist thing so they haven't
[1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:12.400]  even read a lot of the work that they're out there protesting and trying to shut
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:17.120]  down but what I just you think is so incredible is that for some reason they
[1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:23.400]  think that this type of this type of violence this type of censorship isn't
[1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:28.320]  going to come back to bite them like Howard Dean saying that the hate speech
[1:13:28.320 --> 1:13:32.360]  isn't protected by the First Amendment but like you pointed out hate speech is
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:36.360]  just whatever the flavor of the day is of what social justice warriors are
[1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:41.320]  offended by this week and that's considered hate speech but interesting
[1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:44.840]  you know right now we're seeing how these millennials are being really
[1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:48.920]  propagated to and programmed here in universities but the generation right
[1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:52.320]  behind them is trending more conservative even more conservative than
[1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:58.640]  their parents so imagine in a few years time are those generation Z I believe
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:02.680]  they're called are they going to be shutting down the progressive speakers
[1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:05.680]  from coming into the university I mean it's going to completely flip on its
[1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:09.320]  head so it's interesting that they don't think that this is going that they're
[1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:12.680]  always going to be in power and that they're not going to be on the receiving
[1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:16.440]  end of this censorship well I mean that's the point isn't it progressives or
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:19.680]  regressives of that accurately called all the new puritans it used to be
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:25.140]  religious conservatives that censored people back in the 60s 70s and 80s now
[1:14:25.140 --> 1:14:29.280]  it's flipped over but again we're seeing the same process whereby this is
[1:14:29.280 --> 1:14:32.360]  defended it doesn't matter what your opinion even Richard Spencer who we
[1:14:32.360 --> 1:14:36.760]  disagree with he has his First Amendment right just let him express it of
[1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:41.400]  course they say that words of violence and he disagree with agreement with them
[1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:45.440]  is actual violence they've re-characterized it as that in their you
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:50.200]  know trump derangement syndrome but we also had the media focus after the second
[1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:54.520]  battle of Berkeley it wasn't about the Antifa thugs throwing fireworks it
[1:14:54.520 --> 1:14:58.720]  wasn't about them throwing stones it was about this girl with the dreadlocks
[1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:03.440]  being punched moldy lock moldy locks now we don't advocate punching women in
[1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:07.680]  the face but if you are going around smashing bottles on people's heads with
[1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:12.280]  the intent to take some Nazi scalps yeah which she posted on her own Facebook
[1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:16.600]  page then I personally have got no sympathy for her yeah I wouldn't do it
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:19.640]  myself I wouldn't attack her myself I want to attack a woman but if that
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:24.200]  happens she's going into that wanting to be violent wanting to have a violent
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:28.920]  confrontation you can't really have any sympathy for her or Antifa as a whole
[1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:32.840]  when that's their entire shtick is to cause violence but what was the media
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:36.440]  reaction it's sort of sexist of you to say that you wouldn't hit a woman well
[1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:42.280]  but then the weaker sex so that was always in the media was this poor girl
[1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:46.400]  being punched in the face yeah you don't see her hitting throwing bottles and
[1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:50.880]  rocks at people beforehand and I don't you know the guy that that hit her and
[1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:54.440]  I don't think that that's right at all I I mean obviously I think that's but it's
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:15:57.920]  just so interesting to see the hypocrisy because they were they were
[1:15:57.920 --> 1:16:01.840]  really pushing the media was like debating is it okay to punch a Nazi
[1:16:01.840 --> 1:16:06.120]  yeah I think it's okay you know and then if it's flipped around violent
[1:16:06.120 --> 1:16:10.320]  Antifa people you can't punch you had the the guy the maker of what was it
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:14.200]  stranger things the Netflix show get up on stage and say punch a Nazi in the
[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:18.360]  face they all celebrated it if you if you want to live by that rule then you
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:22.720]  die by that rule so I've got absolutely no sympathy if your people are getting
[1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:27.240]  punched in the face because you made that bed now you've got a lie in it right
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:32.800]  it's just equality for all we're all equal in our oppression now but but
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:37.760]  again how the censorship is gonna turn around could come back to bite them we
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:41.600]  have the media kind of really celebrating that Facebook and Google these
[1:16:41.600 --> 1:16:46.240]  other tech giants are gonna be using these truthiness filters as former
[1:16:46.240 --> 1:16:51.200]  president Obama called for but it's now coming back to bite them it's actually
[1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:56.520]  affecting their traffic Facebook's fake news filter is killing traffic more new
[1:16:56.520 --> 1:17:02.040]  sites are saying we are at the mercy of the algorithms and so they are now this
[1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:06.200]  is the Chicago Tribune is one of the most affected by this fake news filter
[1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:10.520]  but that's it it says it's just like just like determining what is hate speech
[1:17:10.520 --> 1:17:15.840]  or what's offensive today people are going to be able to kind of gain these
[1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:20.200]  algorithms and everyone's going to be affected that's why it's so important to
[1:17:20.200 --> 1:17:23.040]  fight for the First Amendment and to understand that even though you might
[1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:28.680]  disagree with what someone is saying we have to protect free speech and the free
[1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:32.880]  access to information and the headline is where at the mercy of the algos more
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:37.000]  news sites say Facebook's fake news filter is killing traffic if you want to
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:41.200]  flash that up is a zero hedge article they talk about the Chicago Tribune's
[1:17:41.200 --> 1:17:46.160]  deputy editor complaining about the fact that their Facebook reach has been
[1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:50.640]  dramatically suppressed over the past few weeks since this newer filter came
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:55.480]  into effect now it turns out the Chicago Tribune was not alone the Boston Globe
[1:17:55.480 --> 1:18:00.160]  is also talking about how engagement has plummeted I've seen this on our own
[1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:04.960]  Facebook pages so it seems that the very outlets that called for this censorship
[1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:09.040]  it's now blowing back in their face right yeah the legitimate news sources
[1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:13.360]  are they say they're worse off than where they were to start with before they
[1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:17.000]  were calling for all yes shut down the fake news and they all changed their
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:21.720]  headline we're the real news democracy dies in the dark and now their online
[1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:26.760]  traffic is being affected because you can't just censor one group of people
[1:18:26.760 --> 1:18:30.600]  and not think that that censorship is going to be turned against you even by
[1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:35.720]  AI even by an algorithm they might just decide that you're offensive well I mean
[1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:38.760]  they came out with a fake news list one of them which the Washington Post
[1:18:38.760 --> 1:18:43.200]  heavily featured the proper not list which they had to back away from it was
[1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:48.160]  just basically every conservative website there's a distinction between fake news
[1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:52.440]  blogs that deliberately put out insane headlines like you know Hillary

[1:21:14.440 --> 1:21:18.480]  adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took
[1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:23.080]  the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis

[1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:26.920]  interesting piece from Alex Jones himself the truth about what's happening
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:30.960]  with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News of course we have the brothers now exerting
[1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:35.600]  their influence over Fox News Network what that means going forward and in
[1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:38.320]  fact I'm going to get into that a little bit later as well but Leanne we got a
[1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:42.280]  few minutes left here you want to talk about PBS putting out Islamist
[1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:46.960]  propaganda. Yes I know David touched a little bit on this the other day but so
[1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:53.480]  this is a PBS kids series dying to be a martyr and it explores the struggle of
[1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:59.040]  being a terrorist and so they say that this is appropriate for students grades
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:03.440]  nine through twelve there's three videos in this lesson plan about the
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:10.280]  struggle of Palestinian terrorists and basically trying to help them sympathize
[1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:13.600]  with the struggle of being a Palestinian terrorist which they call them
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:20.680]  liberators and kind of letting them understand why someone would be a
[1:25:20.680 --> 1:25:26.040]  suicide bomber why they would be just decided to be a martyr. It's legitimizing
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:32.400]  it right? Yeah I mean it's just to me it's just incredible to see how Christianity
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:37.040]  for instance has been so demonized in this country and it just to the point
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:40.240]  where people who are Christian are afraid to even speak out because they'll
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:47.560]  be so fought against but then you will have Islam which is like you know if
[1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:54.320]  you're gay for instance it's a sin punishable by death and that for whatever
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:25:58.760]  reason is now being held up and exemplified and protected especially by
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:03.080]  feminists who are like putting on hijabs and stuff in solidarity it's just so
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:08.440]  weird. Linda Saw-Saw is a big icon now the Sharia law SGM and you literally said
[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:13.800]  that Ayan Hirsi Ali who was a victim of female genital mutilation should have
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:18.080]  her vagina removed. She's the big feminist icon right now but with the
[1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:21.560]  PBS thing again you know there's an argument to be made you drop a drone
[1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:24.360]  bomb on someone's house it's gonna radicalize them yes that's one issue
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:28.440]  don't get involved in foreign entanglements but the argument that
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:32.680]  terrorism as a whole is a result of Western intervention that argument
[1:26:32.680 --> 1:26:36.880]  can't be made when you account for the fact that terrorism primarily targets
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:41.560]  Muslims killing other Muslims in Islamic countries many of which have had no
[1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:45.040]  involvement you know with a Western for an intervention so that completely
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:49.440]  destroys that argument on the face of it right. Right well this is also why you
[1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:54.400]  see so many people after a terrorist attack they're immediately defending the
[1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:59.280]  people who are the suicide bombers and they're basically that's they rush to
[1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:04.680]  go and sympathize with the people who would mow down innocent people in
[1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:09.800]  niece for instance and 80 plus people including children killed in this attack
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:13.640]  and so they instantly instead of saying wow this is terrible that they say well
[1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:17.920]  I get it I mean you see what's happening in their countries which yeah you saw it
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:22.040]  after the Fresno thing they were more concerned about again the narrative on
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:25.600]  Twitter and denying it's like we saw with the French attack yesterday don't
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:28.600]  say it's a terror attack don't say it's a terror attack until we know all the
[1:27:28.600 --> 1:27:32.520]  details and by the time they've known all the details in like two weeks time
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:38.600]  everybody's forgotten about it right exactly yeah yeah and then Trump comes
[1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:42.440]  out after the French president had come out and said it was terrorism and says
[1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:46.560]  it's likely terrorism so it looks like didn't even say still searching for a
[1:27:46.560 --> 1:27:51.160]  motive yeah still searching for a motive and they will they will run that spiel
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:56.000]  for hours and then days afterwards until the next one happens and then it's oh
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:59.600]  we don't know who it is might be a white super because if it is a white person
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:05.000]  then it's immediately a terrorist attack right within minutes on Twitter did
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:08.680]  white people have to answer for this you've seen the salon dot com articles
[1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:12.880]  you know the Boston bombing and white people have to answer but when the
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:16.720]  Boston bombing happened they didn't run that same spiel did they no he got a
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:22.720]  rolling stone cover exactly he was a rock star yeah there's a YouTube fake
[1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:27.120]  news workshop it's out of BBC news YouTube to offer fake news workshops to
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:31.240]  teenagers so basically what they're doing because we're completely decimating
[1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:34.360]  them on YouTube we've got millions of views and subscribers they've got
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:40.920]  pathetic amount they're selecting and promoting these SJW accounts putting
[1:28:40.920 --> 1:28:44.920]  them in the trending section you can go down the list I'll get more into detail
[1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:48.760]  about this later but it's basically you know black lives matter social justice
[1:28:48.760 --> 1:28:53.680]  warriors feminists nobody wants to watch that on YouTube you've seen the up votes
[1:28:53.680 --> 1:28:59.200]  to down votes it's an absolute wreck it's a completely demolished channel some
[1:28:59.200 --> 1:29:03.480]  of these people are quitting all together because they don't resonate we
[1:29:03.480 --> 1:29:07.360]  do so YouTube is now trying to game its own system and posh these people well
[1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:11.560]  and talk about fake news I mean there's just so much fake information out there
[1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:15.840]  I just saw something I think it was on Instagram about how or no it was on
[1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:22.280]  Twitter about how the white English language was created by black people
[1:29:22.280 --> 1:29:26.200]  through series of you know historical and it's just like what are you talking
[1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:30.960]  about no it was not it's like a Germanic language I just there's a lot of fake
[1:29:30.960 --> 1:29:35.440]  news out there so it'll be interesting to see how the social justice warrior
[1:29:35.440 --> 1:29:39.720]  YouTube fares they're gonna try and push it because they're failing miserably
[1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:44.360]  otherwise Alex Jones is coming up with a special report on Bill O'Reilly and Fox
[1:29:44.360 --> 1:29:51.000]  News don't miss it we'll be back live next we're on the March the Empires on
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:57.080]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:29:57.080 --> 1:30:03.240]  you see Berkeley which has been the battleground for free speech has
[1:30:03.240 --> 1:30:08.880]  canceled conservative commentator Ann Coulter speaking event citing safety
[1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:13.120]  concerns Coulter did say that the university tried to reschedule the
[1:30:13.120 --> 1:30:18.080]  event in short notice for a later date on May 2nd which would be during dead
[1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:22.760]  week when students are not even in class as they prep for finals so
[1:30:22.760 --> 1:30:27.880]  essentially Berkeley is appeasing the temper tantrum throwing anti-fah by
[1:30:27.880 --> 1:30:32.560]  canceling conservative speaker events that were properly invited by
[1:30:32.560 --> 1:30:36.760]  recognized student groups Coulter has stated that she plans to speak at
[1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:40.640]  Berkeley despite the cancellation and has criticized Berkeley's chief of
[1:30:40.640 --> 1:30:44.760]  police for allowing Rodney King style riots to go on when only
[1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:49.080]  conservative speakers speak Berkeley was known as the birthplace of the student
[1:30:49.080 --> 1:30:54.000]  led free speech movement in the 1960s and now it's becoming the birthplace of

[1:33:37.720 --> 1:33:44.160]  complex character very intelligent man I remember seeing him on extra and shows
[1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:51.480]  like that back in the 1980s and early 1990s doing pieces on the JFK assassination
[1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:56.280]  and the government shipping narcotics into the United States he was once
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:03.280]  pretty much a proto Alex Jones he was a forerunner of investigative modern
[1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:07.920]  journalism and the internet world kind of a Matt Drudge in some respects he was
[1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:14.200]  also famous for you know saying effort do it live have tomorrow and that is it
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:25.040]  for us today and we will leave you with a I can't do it we'll do it live that said
[1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:30.680]  Bill O'Reilly was also a tremendous bully famous when he had a radio talk
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:38.200]  show that failed for having his security team with caller ID but it was in
[1:34:38.200 --> 1:34:43.240]  Florida or New York actually in some cases reportedly fly to go to another
[1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:48.800]  state to go to the door and knock on it and threaten callers that had
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:53.360]  disagreed with him or made a point he didn't like that is just crazy and I
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:34:57.760]  remember him threatening callers on air we should probably look online trying to
[1:34:57.760 --> 1:35:03.440]  find some of those so the guy was a consummate bully and he also would do
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:07.960]  stuff like play a clip of me yelling about some police corruption turn my
[1:35:07.960 --> 1:35:23.360]  face red and say coming up we explore sexual predators against women speak now
[1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:28.200]  Facebook is apologizing for allowing it worldwide but can anything be done to
[1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:33.000]  stop the hatred which is directly linked into the IRS team party scandal
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:38.680]  we'll have a factor investigation well no one's ever said that about me so he
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:45.440]  was projecting on that yours truly Alex Jones what he himself has settled cases
[1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:50.120]  on not where he put out advances towards women and then they were you know
[1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:53.840]  rebuffed it and stopped but where he pressured people under him over and over
[1:35:53.840 --> 1:36:02.320]  and over and over and over and over again to have sex with him and of course
[1:36:02.320 --> 1:36:06.720]  they refused him and then he would reportedly demote them or have them
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:12.640]  transferred and Roger Ailes basically encouraged all of this and he's been let
[1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:18.160]  go with the same reason now that said Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly are doing
[1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:23.560]  the same garbage that Democrats in Hollywood are even more famous for but
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:27.440]  they're getting child actors girls and boys have sex with them that's all come
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:31.800]  out over and over again and that all gets covered up so all I'm saying is yeah
[1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:34.600]  let's prosecute Edward Snowden for breaking the law leaking secret
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:38.680]  documents after you prosecute our own government and all these corporations
[1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:42.920]  were doing things ten thousand times literally worse and then you'll never
[1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:46.200]  get around to Snowden because he was actually exposing criminal activity so
[1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:49.200]  maybe he shouldn't be charged the point is letter of the law spirit of the law
[1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:53.360]  you can't be violating the letter and the spirit many many times worse than
[1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:58.240]  somebody else and then have the very same system sitting judgment so this is a
[1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:03.280]  part of a purge at Fox by Rupert Murdoch's sons that are admittedly saying
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:06.680]  this in the news I was the first to break it during the RNC because I went to
[1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:10.680]  the Ritz-Carlton in Cleveland and met for several hours with some of the top
[1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:14.480]  Fox people and got the intel and it all buried out to be true that there was a
[1:37:14.480 --> 1:37:18.720]  coolant Fox Megan Kelly was meant to kind of be the flipping of them from
[1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:23.640]  conservative Americana at least light or what they posed to be the synthetic
[1:37:23.640 --> 1:37:27.120]  version that they used to control the conservative movement into a whole
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:33.080]  leftist kind of globalist conservatoid synthetic system even more than what it
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:38.160]  had been so as so as so a true counterfeit to lead the conservative
[1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:41.880]  movement the libertarian movement the nationalist movement into a true rat hole
[1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:46.200]  but Fox threw everything and had it at Trump Megan threw everything she had a
[1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:51.240]  Trump it failed so she left NBC Ailes still stepped down because clearly he
[1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:54.560]  done some things that were wrong and bad I'm not defending him people say oh
[1:37:54.560 --> 1:37:58.120]  you're being nice to foxes you want a job from Roger Ailes I was offered shows
[1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:04.560]  on Fox okay now get to that in a minute but expanding on that if they can take
[1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:08.680]  them out they can take brutesh out they can take me out they could then shut
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:13.040]  down all free speech and that's why you see info wars with the total
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:17.440]  distortions of the media even more than billow rally pretty much last week being
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:23.000]  demonized and attacked with a bunch of twisted made-up garbage is because they
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:28.480]  know I basically represent our incredible audience of patriots who
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:32.560]  understand globalism understand it's unelected understand it's authoritarian
[1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:38.560]  and are educating others so it's our ideology of freedom and free market but
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:42.120]  it's so frightened the globalists that they've got to take us down they can
[1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:46.880]  bring down billow Riley and Roger Ailes who did have Achilles heels and
[1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:50.240]  quite frankly did deserve it at a certain level they can bring everybody
[1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:54.680]  down but you got to understand the motive for bringing Ailes and Billow
[1:38:54.680 --> 1:38:59.600]  Riley down was not the motive of actually loving women are caring about
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:04.960]  women our own leftist governments back radical jahads women being sold in Libby
[1:39:04.960 --> 1:39:08.560]  after a failed state was created by Hillary by the tens of thousands ISIS
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:12.320]  selling thousands of little girls into sex slavery some of them raped to death
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:16.520]  this is all documented but it's buried in the back of the newspaper never
[1:39:16.520 --> 1:39:21.160]  mentioned on mainstream TV jihad attacks happen almost every day now I
[1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:24.200]  mean we just had another one yesterday another one today it's it's it's
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:27.920]  becoming just unbelievable and they mocked Trump saying what happened in
[1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:32.720]  Sweden nothing happened in Sweden so police officers getting killed people
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:35.680]  getting run over every week by cars getting stabbed getting shot getting
[1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:39.520]  bombed whether it's in England or whether it's in France or whether it's
[1:39:39.520 --> 1:39:43.280]  in Sweden or whether it's in Belgium or whether it just goes on and on and on
[1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:48.120]  and they just shut that all down and that's a big leftist Achilles heels so
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:52.600]  they double down and say no feminism endorses Islam let's put her jobs on
[1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:58.280]  that's their response is quadruple down but getting back to Bill O'Reilly here
[1:39:58.280 --> 1:40:08.240]  briefly because it's so important Bill O'Reilly his biggest mistake is he sold
[1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:16.520]  out the system he was quasi against Trump he was conservative light he was
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:21.000]  completely basically again there to be controlled opposition but now he's got
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:25.880]  to be taken down as a sacrificial lamb and as a victory for the left that
[1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:31.040]  they're openly destroying any vestige of independent media that could oppose the
[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:34.560]  globalist program that's it I'm not gonna say any more okay in respect for
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:39.880]  your father it was a poor and I know what I was doing shut up respect in
[1:40:39.880 --> 1:40:45.080]  respect for your father who was a poor authority work fine American who got
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:49.400]  killed unnecessarily by barbarian by radical extremists yeah fine trained by
[1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:53.360]  this government respect for him of America I'm not gonna do ruling class a
[1:40:53.360 --> 1:40:57.440]  small minority cut his mic I'm not gonna dress you down anymore and that's why
[1:40:57.440 --> 1:41:01.160]  they call us fake news it's why they lie and say that I'm fake when I'm not they
[1:41:01.160 --> 1:41:04.000]  say do you ever play an actor well yeah I do skits and things but that doesn't
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:07.560]  mean everything I do some actor that's individual bases it's clear when I do it
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:13.760]  cobra commander of the Joker David Mendelsohn the third of you know British
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:18.240]  globalist character I played I mean when I play a street preacher in scanner
[1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:23.200]  darkly with Keanu Reeves Woody Harrelson all those people I mean that's actually
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:26.560]  took a role where I was playing a part of a patriot in the future dystopia who's
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:31.720]  being arrested for his free speech wow that was 2006 or we are 2017 and now
[1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:35.800]  it's almost become reality now it's near future the face scanners the total
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:40.240]  surveillance the grid I advised on that film my advisory capacity on that peak
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:48.480]  the PKD film rendition it's basically come true government bringing in a drug
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:51.720]  for the population to become addicted to it then using the drug war to put you in
[1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:58.000]  these basic drug rehabs are actually slave warrants to then reprogram you and
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:02.200]  then here we are so Bill Riley sold out to the system and got burned by which is
[1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:06.800]  a lesson to all these folks there's no honor among thieves but remember this the
[1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:10.240]  truth always will defeat tyranny of people have courage to promote it that's
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:14.180]  why Mark Twain said a lie to go halfway around the world before the truth can
[1:42:14.180 --> 1:42:18.680]  put his pants on another Mark Twain I love to quote in the beginning of
[1:42:18.680 --> 1:42:22.120]  Patriots scarce man hated fear and scorn and the time was costing see the Tim
[1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:26.960]  to join him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot and I am a patriot for
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:29.760]  our Republic I do support it it's not perfect it's better than every other
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:34.320]  country system I want to restore it and I want to thank you all for your support
[1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:38.720]  everything you've done in the past to pray for us and to promote our links in
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:42.360]  our articles it's a big deal that certain of it's got the documents and Google had
[1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:48.320]  to admit that they were having an army of operatives downvote in fuller stories
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:52.360]  to block them that's only part of a wider spectrum of us being strangled
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:55.920]  right now but because of you coming through we're actually growing all of
[1:42:55.920 --> 1:42:59.960]  us together towards victory in the face of this so no this I'll never surrender
[1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:04.240]  to quote Winston Churchill I will go on to the end whatever the cost may be we
[1:43:04.240 --> 1:43:09.280]  should go on to the end whatever the cost may be we shall fight and we shall
[1:43:09.280 --> 1:43:12.920]  never surrender we will defend our Republic we will defend freedom we will
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:16.920]  defend Renaissance we will defend the right to peaceful religion we will
[1:43:16.920 --> 1:43:19.960]  defend the right to art and literature and true culture and we will defeat the
[1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:23.420]  right wing control freaks the left wing control freaks and all the cults the
[1:43:23.420 --> 1:43:27.200]  secret term of me to take humanity and turn us into a bunch of servile brain
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:30.680]  dead zombies and the zombie wars here a lot of the public is dumbered in a box
[1:43:30.680 --> 1:43:35.040]  of rocks I don't take solace in that that scares me but the elite swim in an
[1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:38.680]  ocean of idiots that's why they want to produce more of them so Bill O'Reilly
[1:43:38.680 --> 1:43:45.200]  with his hundreds of millions of dollars can sail off into the sunset but
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:51.480]  he's a bully and he's a thug and he tried to bring me down I've seen articles
[1:43:51.480 --> 1:43:54.320]  on M4 wars you know halfway defending them people say well what's this you
[1:43:54.320 --> 1:43:57.000]  don't want Bill O'Reilly I don't control my riders they've got some good
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  perspectives he's not all bad I get the fact it was political targeting and I
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:04.240]  get the fact that we're in the same boat even though I'm not the same type of
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:09.360]  person as he is so I understand that they got him they're coming for everybody
[1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:11.480]  else
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:15.400]  limbaugh's attacked me many times I've defended him they try to take a month a
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:19.000]  year I guess he didn't like me or thought he didn't like me because they put me on
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:25.280]  the same time as them that was not my decision but I mean all the industry says
[1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:28.560]  the media says you know I'm the quote heir to Rush Limbaugh let me say that
[1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:33.400]  in final closing I already have more listeners and viewers every week than
[1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:36.280]  Rush Limbaugh conservatively he has mainly radio listeners twenty something
[1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:39.200]  million a week that's huge biggest retro show that it's like Dwork's Norian
[1:44:39.200 --> 1:44:43.320]  Miles Savage and others great guys and then on the internet he's got a pretty
[1:44:43.320 --> 1:44:47.640]  big presence but M4 wars dwarfs him the only thing bigger is drudge and it's
[1:44:47.640 --> 1:44:52.800]  not about who's the biggest but if I am the biggest thing out there now with
[1:44:52.800 --> 1:44:57.440]  because of you us together then am I a target well look at those that'll tell
[1:44:57.440 --> 1:45:02.120]  you why we're under such attack info wars.com for my show spread that link
[1:45:02.120 --> 1:45:04.840]  spread our video spread our articles please know that you're having huge
[1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:08.640]  effect double down the face of tyranny they've jumped the shark they've they've
[1:45:08.640 --> 1:45:11.520]  really are going for broke if they don't get their censorship in place which
[1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:15.080]  they're moving forward with if we block it if we expose it if we have whistle
[1:45:15.080 --> 1:45:17.960]  blowers like the patriots that leaked from Google about info wars being
[1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:23.000]  censored it'll blow up in their face and we are the new counterculture we are
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:26.520]  the avant-garde you just the questioners of the authoritarian system the
[1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:29.680]  pro-free speech people you're the classical liberals the paleo-conservatives
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:35.800]  and so they miscalculated if you stand up and you take action you get it's game
[1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:40.520]  over man to quote Mr. Paxson that just passed last month game over is the game
[1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:48.920]  over for us or them they've miscalculated they've miscalculated Royale Royale so

[1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:41.040]  my world why is it so much better than what I just bought melatonin in the store
[1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:46.680]  and I said I figured if we just took melatonin L tryptophan the larian root
[1:46:46.680 --> 1:46:50.040]  and all these other key things are known as natural and healthy and organic
[1:46:50.040 --> 1:46:53.160]  sources of this that have been known for thousands of years to aid and sleep

[1:48:19.280 --> 1:48:23.120]  single almost Achilles heel we're backed by the people and that's why even though

[1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:41.160]  island home to ride out the storm of war and to our lives of menace of tyranny if
[1:49:41.160 --> 1:49:49.320]  necessary for years if necessary alone at any rate that is what we're going to
[1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:55.760]  try to do then it was all of its magic in government every man of them that is
[1:49:55.760 --> 1:49:59.480]  the will of parliament and the nation the British Empire and the French
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:05.720]  Republic linked together in their cause and in their need will defend to the
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:10.760]  death their native soil aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of

[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:36.520]  now now you to you heard before the break Alex was ranting and raving about
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:41.160]  O'Reilly and Fox News with good reason because of course he's just been let go
[1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:46.480]  after a long protracted controversy over allegations over sexually assaulting
[1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:51.840]  women now we have this article out of Gateway Pundit the new Fox News and
[1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:55.960]  James Murdoch's lefty wife works for Clinton climate initiative
[1:56:55.960 --> 1:57:01.120]  regularly trashes Trump on Twitter so the two sons who have been given control
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:06.960]  of the rains basically at this point are now linked directly with Clinton
[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:10.720]  operatives the Murdoch family fired Bill O'Reilly the top personality on
[1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:15.240]  Kevel news for the past 15 years on Wednesday now this James Murdoch's
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:19.520]  wife Catherine Murdoch is an outspoken leftist who works for the Clinton
[1:57:19.520 --> 1:57:24.800]  climate initiative Catherine Murdoch hates Donald Trump and regularly
[1:57:24.800 --> 1:57:28.800]  trashes the president on Twitter if you scroll down in the article you can read
[1:57:28.800 --> 1:57:35.880]  some of her tweets where she trashes the president on a routine basis I'm with
[1:57:35.880 --> 1:57:41.920]  her she's a Hillary Clinton operative that is the wife of James Murdoch who
[1:57:41.920 --> 1:57:47.640]  is now basically in control of Fox News which led to O'Reilly being let go of
[1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:51.560]  course they've still got to make money they've still got a resonate so they're
[1:57:51.560 --> 1:57:55.320]  gonna push Tucker Carlson up to the prime-time O'Reilly slot they've also
[1:57:55.320 --> 1:57:59.600]  got I think is Eric Boling coming in for Tucker's slot he's red-pilled he's a
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:05.600]  Trump supporter so leftists who are celebrating taking down O'Reilly really
[1:58:05.600 --> 1:58:09.160]  should take another look at it because now you've got two prominent red-pilled
[1:58:09.160 --> 1:58:14.720]  Trump supporters in prominent prime-time positions on Fox News but again their
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:19.480]  audience is dying out their average viewer is 69 years old they're still on
[1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:24.160]  top of the game but for how much longer is the question in the aftermath of the
[1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:28.600]  firing of Bill O'Reilly we will be back in the next segment with more news and
[1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:33.000]  with Michael Heaver after that he's talking about the UK election and the

[2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:41.720]  clash the Titanic battle which begins this Sunday between globalism and
[2:00:41.720 --> 2:00:45.840]  populism it is the French presidential election for the moment let's dip back
[2:00:45.840 --> 2:00:51.240]  into the news breaking story up on info wars.com Sweden did you hear about what
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:55.600]  happened last night in Sweden again Muslim avoids jail for anally raping
[2:00:55.600 --> 2:01:00.760]  teen because he quote couldn't understand no oh it's part of his culture
[2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:07.200]  to anally rape teens so let's treat him nicely that's liberalism despite his
[2:01:07.200 --> 2:01:11.160]  14 year old victim repeatedly saying no a Muslim migrant won't face rape charges
[2:01:11.160 --> 2:01:16.640]  because the court claimed he had difficulties in interpreting the word no
[2:01:16.640 --> 2:01:20.760]  the royal court Western Sweden said the Iraqi who had former convictions had
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:25.160]  suspected ADHD oh okay that's that's a good defense so if you just claim to
[2:01:25.160 --> 2:01:29.680]  have ADHD now you can go around raping teenagers okay which according to the
[2:01:29.680 --> 2:01:33.080]  court gave him difficulties in interpreting and interacting with other
[2:01:33.080 --> 2:01:36.680]  people as well as recognizing the standards he is expected to live up to
[2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:41.520]  bearing in mind this is a country in Sweden which allowed back into their
[2:01:41.520 --> 2:01:48.080]  country a hundred and fifty ISIS terrorists and tried to reintegrate them
[2:01:48.080 --> 2:01:52.520]  back into society people who've literally fought on the battlefields of Syria
[2:01:52.520 --> 2:02:00.200]  and Iraq beheading children and slaving Christians shooting at firing a Syrian
[2:02:00.200 --> 2:02:04.880]  army troops they're now coming back into Europe and we have to be nice to them
[2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:09.800]  we have to be nice to them because we're a progressive tolerant society so we
[2:02:09.800 --> 2:02:17.120]  have to tolerate them raping teenage boys we saw it in Austria again the
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:22.000]  migrant goes to a swimming pool rapes what was it a nine-year-old boy is
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:26.440]  absolutely baffled when the police come to arrest him because oh it's just part
[2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:31.040]  of my culture yeah you see out of the sun outrageous Iraqi migrant who raped
[2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:35.880]  boy 10 in sexual emergency that's what he called it a sexual emergency
[2:02:35.880 --> 2:02:40.040]  conviction overturned because court couldn't prove the child said no
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:45.720]  absolutely chilling the police turned up he was like why are you arresting me
[2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:50.360]  this is completely normal in my country they have bag it was he called bag a
[2:02:50.360 --> 2:02:55.000]  barzy in Afghanistan where they have an annual thing a regular custom where
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:59.960]  they just rape teenage boys the US Army the soldiers were told to ignore it when
[2:02:59.960 --> 2:03:05.240]  some of them tried to blow the whistle they tried to blow the whistle they
[2:03:05.240 --> 2:03:09.040]  were told to shut up about it now these people are coming into Europe and the
[2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:15.560]  courts are showing leniency for raping 14-year-old teenagers we have the
[2:03:15.560 --> 2:03:19.680]  situation all over Europe where they claim to be under 18 they claim to be
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:25.280]  minors so they get lesser sentences and now the big new feminist political
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:30.200]  icon in Sweden says that rapists shouldn't be deported foreign criminals
[2:03:30.200 --> 2:03:34.760]  shouldn't be deported this is what's happening in Sweden they're actually
[2:03:34.760 --> 2:03:40.760]  saying ISIS jihadists who come back into the country should be given welfare
[2:03:40.760 --> 2:03:46.320]  jobs housing they should be tolerated it's a progressive society we need to
[2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:51.600]  tolerate the most regressive belief system on planet earth that's not
[2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:57.640]  tolerance that's capitulation that's destroying true classical liberal
[2:03:57.640 --> 2:04:04.080]  beliefs European welfare benefits help fund ISIS fighters out of USA today and
[2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:08.720]  we featured the articles before they actually called on Swedes to give up
[2:04:08.720 --> 2:04:13.760]  their garages to give up that the annexes in their properties to house
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:19.640]  incoming migrants absolutely insane now Muslim avoids jail for anally raping
[2:04:19.640 --> 2:04:23.760]  team because he couldn't understand no any excuse whatsoever you've had
[2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:29.000]  victims on trains that get raped by some of these migrants and they say well I
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:34.160]  didn't want to report it because even reporting it might be seen as racist and
[2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:37.680]  these people have been through a difficult time so perhaps we should have
[2:04:37.680 --> 2:04:42.120]  tolerance of them raping women and children no we shouldn't have any
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:48.680]  tolerance of that in a truly progressive liberal tolerant society we'll
[2:04:48.680 --> 2:04:52.720]  be back on the Alex Jones show with Michael he ever talking about the
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:58.680]  French presidential election don't go away in four wars dot com
[2:04:58.680 --> 2:05:03.680]  UC Berkeley which has been the battleground for free speech has cancelled
[2:05:03.680 --> 2:05:09.280]  conservative commentator and Coulter speaking event citing safety concerns
[2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:13.840]  Coulter did say that the university tried to reschedule the event in short
[2:05:13.840 --> 2:05:19.080]  notice for a later date on May 2nd which would be during dead week when students
[2:05:19.080 --> 2:05:24.200]  are not even in class as they prep for finals so essentially Berkeley is
[2:05:24.200 --> 2:05:29.280]  appeasing the temper tantrum throwing anti-fah by canceling conservative
[2:05:29.280 --> 2:05:34.080]  speaker events that were properly invited by recognized student groups
[2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:37.760]  culture has stated that she plans to speak at Berkeley despite the
[2:05:37.760 --> 2:05:41.560]  cancellation and has criticized Berkeley's chief of police for allowing
[2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:46.200]  Rodney King style riots to go on when only conservative speakers speak
[2:05:46.200 --> 2:05:50.480]  Berkeley was known as the birthplace of the student-led free speech movement in
[2:05:50.480 --> 2:05:55.960]  the 1960s and now it's becoming the birthplace of student-led censorship this

[2:08:31.720 --> 2:08:36.320]  about earlier we have a huge election coming up in france first round of which
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:42.200]  happens on sunday it is globalism versus populism once again it is marine
[2:08:42.200 --> 2:08:46.680]  le pen in the running with several other candidates the polls are incredibly
[2:08:46.680 --> 2:08:50.160]  tight right now gonna talk about that gonna talk about the uk election with
[2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:53.960]  my guest michael heaver he is the former preside for nijl forage he's a
[2:08:53.960 --> 2:08:57.960]  commentator in his own right he worked on the leave dot eu campaign with air
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:03.480]  and banks and the website is west monster dot com michael welcome to the
[2:09:03.480 --> 2:09:08.400]  show thanks for having me cool now let's get into paris because of course we
[2:09:08.400 --> 2:09:12.120]  have the terrorist attack yesterday you know they used to call bay route the
[2:09:12.120 --> 2:09:17.560]  paris of the east now they're calling a paris the bay route of the west this has
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:22.680]  happened 21 times we've had islamic terror attacks since charlie hebdo six in
[2:09:22.680 --> 2:09:27.120]  three years in paris alone i mean my question is you know if marine le pen
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:31.080]  does fail to win this election should we just accept that the french have
[2:09:31.080 --> 2:09:36.520]  capitulated to another form of fascism this time in the guise of islamo
[2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:41.880]  fascism well you know things in france are looking pretty dire there's no
[2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:47.320]  doubt about that i saw a stat actually on zero hedge early that the twitter
[2:09:47.320 --> 2:09:55.000]  account that said since early 2015 there have been 230 islamist murders in
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:59.600]  france i mean if that doesn't show you that this is a war then i don't know
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:04.000]  what does 230 that is absolutely incredible they're talking about they're
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:07.840]  talking about murders not just terrorist attacks individual murders right yeah
[2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:15.360]  yeah 200 zero heads has calculated 230 islamist murders in france since early
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:19.840]  2015 and although we know what we've got problems right across europe i think
[2:10:19.840 --> 2:10:23.560]  france has bared the brunt of it in a way that is unimaginable i mean we've
[2:10:23.560 --> 2:10:28.000]  obviously had some terrorist attacks in london and we've seen things in germany
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:32.480]  and so on but france is you know this is the front line of the european war
[2:10:32.480 --> 2:10:37.560]  against islamist extremism and this election you know the stakes just
[2:10:37.560 --> 2:10:41.160]  couldn't be higher as you point out this is a huge election not just for
[2:10:41.160 --> 2:10:45.640]  france but for the whole of europe i feel but michael donald trump is bad
[2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:50.920]  because he came out two hours after the attack had happened when the police said
[2:10:50.920 --> 2:10:53.880]  it was a terrorist attack when france war along said it was a terrorist attack
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:10:58.520]  donald trump had the temerity to call it a terrorist attack and shouldn't we be
[2:10:58.520 --> 2:11:03.880]  outraged about that and not the fact that there have been 21 at least islamic
[2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:08.720]  terror attacks to 230 murders in france shouldn't we be outraged about what
[2:11:08.720 --> 2:11:14.280]  donald trump said i know i'm just unbelievable i mean i just give you an
[2:11:14.280 --> 2:11:17.120]  example of the way it's been painted by some of the mainstream media here well i
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:21.480]  just watched the a bbc report which of course as we know is one of the sort of
[2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:26.000]  main mainstream news in the uk and that's six o'clock rundown there was no
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:30.840]  mention of the pro-isis note that was left by the terrorists there was no
[2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:35.520]  mention of the karam found in the car very interesting how some of this is
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:40.800]  being framed you know again people are very quick to try and separate all this
[2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:45.000]  is nothing to do with islam and donald trump's terrible for saying these things
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:48.320]  and i just think the thing that fills me with a lot of confidence is i think that
[2:11:48.320 --> 2:11:52.240]  line of argument has never been less credible has never been listened to by
[2:11:52.240 --> 2:11:57.880]  fewer people and i think that's why you know the pen not that logo was you know
[2:11:57.880 --> 2:12:01.120]  people would say she was an extreme figure she had no chance of winning she
[2:12:01.120 --> 2:12:04.360]  does have a real chance of winning we're looking at election here that's going to
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:08.520]  be very tight very unpredictable you've got four candidates that could all go
[2:12:08.520 --> 2:12:12.880]  through to that second round but she has got a very good chance of winning and
[2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:15.960]  let's talk about some of the candidates now in fact let's get that clip ready to
[2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:21.000]  roll again with them obama endorsing macron the establishment candidate who
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:25.240]  they tried to frame as a populist for the first portion of his campaign we have
[2:12:25.240 --> 2:12:32.840]  that clip ready let's roll obama endorsing immanuel macron thank you
[2:12:32.840 --> 2:12:38.240]  very much hello hello mr. president how are you
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:44.960]  yeah exactly well doing very well how are you can you hear me yes i hear you
[2:12:44.960 --> 2:12:51.720]  very well the main message i have is to wish you all the best in the in the
[2:12:51.720 --> 2:12:56.720]  coming days and make sure that as you said you work hard all the way through
[2:12:56.720 --> 2:13:02.000]  because you never know it might be that last day of campaigning but yeah i do
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:08.560]  agree makes all the difference i will do my best believe me and and and and so i
[2:13:08.560 --> 2:13:14.000]  will find is the last minute and we will we will keep it in touch and our teams
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.880]  will rely on us in order to organize and a new contact and see how to work
[2:13:18.880 --> 2:13:24.000]  together if i'm going to the runoff thank you very much i do appreciate you
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  took the time now i call the media wind and wind about putin interfering in
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:34.360]  the us election they wind about putin interfering in the french election but
[2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:40.680]  obama can interfere in the french election and nobody bats an eyelid well
[2:13:40.680 --> 2:13:43.960]  you know obama's obviously got a fantastic record because if you remember he came
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:47.800]  over to britain and threatened us and said we'd be at the back of the queue if
[2:13:47.800 --> 2:13:52.320]  we dare vote to leave the european union and the british people basically went
[2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:55.880]  to the polls and told him where to go so frankly you know i think there's a bar
[2:13:55.880 --> 2:13:59.480]  interventions marvelous i think it's going to show once again the likes of
[2:13:59.480 --> 2:14:03.440]  macron and obama and all these people who have had their time in government
[2:14:03.440 --> 2:14:06.720]  tony blairs another one they've had their time of this so-called centrist
[2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:10.920]  politics and what i find interesting is when people like obama and macron they
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:14.240]  now describe the centrist let's look at what that means what it actually means
[2:14:14.240 --> 2:14:19.360]  is that they're pro open border they're pro-eu they've got they've effectively
[2:14:19.360 --> 2:14:24.360]  allowed in isis to walk into europe and cause all of this mayhem and i would now
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:26.960]  argue that it's people like macron actually that are on the fringe of
[2:14:26.960 --> 2:14:31.480]  politics and we are the new mainstream you know the average french voter now is
[2:14:31.480 --> 2:14:35.440]  not sitting around thinking that the EU is marvelous that pro open borders has
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:39.200]  worked the mass immigration is a good thing the multi-culturalism should go
[2:14:39.200 --> 2:14:43.600]  on that's the macron position but that's the fringe position now and so i
[2:14:43.600 --> 2:14:47.520]  think when you have people like obama and macron grouping together i think it
[2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:51.360]  actually exposes that these are yesterday's men with yesterday's answers
[2:14:51.360 --> 2:14:56.320]  that have tried to govern and we've seen what's resulted it's been mass islamic
[2:14:56.320 --> 2:15:00.560]  terrorism it's been open borders and it's been complete disaster in fact we
[2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:04.240]  had a poll out of europe it was constant it was a conducted by the royal
[2:15:04.240 --> 2:15:07.440]  institute of international affairs where they found i think it was a
[2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:12.640]  10 000 people surveyed in europe 55 percent wanted a total shutdown on all
[2:15:12.640 --> 2:15:16.480]  islamic immigration compared to about what was it 20 on percent who said the
[2:15:16.480 --> 2:15:20.320]  opposite the rest didn't know and in france those numbers were even higher
[2:15:20.320 --> 2:15:25.120]  than 55 percent right yeah i mean just astronomical numbers and
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:28.320]  what i find very interesting is the immigration debate
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:33.040]  on terms of the anti-eu uh side of things initially started out as a lot of
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:35.840]  an economic one the argument was that if you let
[2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:40.000]  unlimited amounts of people into into europe it pushed you know from eastern
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:43.920]  europe into britain it pushes down wages and living standards for
[2:15:43.920 --> 2:15:46.080]  people i now think we're seeing an evolution of
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:50.400]  that from an economic argument to security argument and the problem is
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:54.560]  people are looking around and thinking immigration equals national security
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:15:58.480]  risk immigration equals a threat from isis and
[2:15:58.480 --> 2:16:01.840]  that's very very bad because you know at the end of the day we want people to be
[2:16:01.840 --> 2:16:04.960]  able to move around the world but the way that it's being done at the moment
[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:08.880]  is totally outrageous to allow people to walk into europe
[2:16:08.880 --> 2:16:13.840]  with some sob story you know i've seen on west monster we've run a few stories
[2:16:13.840 --> 2:16:17.760]  about the dutch government their 8 000 failed asylum seekers that the dutch
[2:16:17.760 --> 2:16:21.520]  government said no you've applied for asylum we've rejected your
[2:16:21.520 --> 2:16:25.360]  bid to stay in the country and then they said oh but you can make your own way
[2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:28.800]  out of the country as if they're all just going to go wow okay you said we
[2:16:28.800 --> 2:16:33.200]  can't stay so off we go you know germany has over 500 000
[2:16:33.200 --> 2:16:38.000]  failed asylum seekers now still in the country the authorities have lost
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:41.120]  control of it and it's to the point where
[2:16:41.120 --> 2:16:45.680]  they've they've got an open door with anyone they have to walk in virtually
[2:16:45.680 --> 2:16:49.360]  and they don't know what to do they've got a zero policy solution
[2:16:49.360 --> 2:16:54.640]  what is a manual macron solution to mass immigration what's the solution to isis
[2:16:54.640 --> 2:16:58.480]  what's the solution to failed asylum seekers coming in under bogus
[2:16:58.480 --> 2:17:02.400]  i d's he's got no solution his solution is the eu
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:06.000]  and it's a failed one and that's i think the exciting thing for well
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:09.520]  i think increasingly people are looking at this and thinking we've had enough
[2:17:09.520 --> 2:17:13.520]  it's time for a change and hopefully we see the pen elected president france
[2:17:13.520 --> 2:17:17.040]  well macron came out with his so-called solution yesterday which was
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:20.480]  the same as manwell vows the french prime minister after niece and he
[2:17:20.480 --> 2:17:24.000]  basically said this terrorism is going to continue for years and years we just
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:27.600]  have to live with it absolutely incredible right
[2:17:27.600 --> 2:17:31.920]  yeah well you know that just shows they've totally won out of ideas
[2:17:31.920 --> 2:17:37.200]  i mean again all i would say is they cast themselves as centrists
[2:17:37.200 --> 2:17:40.560]  who on earth in france is going to look at that answer
[2:17:40.560 --> 2:17:44.480]  and think that's a logical rational response
[2:17:44.480 --> 2:17:49.360]  to mass murder in you in france and europe they're just not
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:54.320]  unfortunately as we've seen in britain this argument was defeated
[2:17:54.320 --> 2:17:58.480]  what happened was politicians fought for the eu the establishment fought for
[2:17:58.480 --> 2:18:02.000]  the e u regardless of the merit of the case
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:05.760]  now it cannot be argued that your country is more secure
[2:18:05.760 --> 2:18:09.360]  with e u open borders than it is by controlling the borders
[2:18:09.360 --> 2:18:12.720]  but they will ignore that fact because they are fully signed up
[2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:16.800]  to the eu project come what may we ran another story in westland recently
[2:18:16.800 --> 2:18:19.680]  about marina lapin before she did an interview
[2:18:19.680 --> 2:18:23.360]  on with her french media so they had an eu flag and french flag behind her and
[2:18:23.360 --> 2:18:26.400]  she demanded that the eu flag be removed because she wants to be the
[2:18:26.400 --> 2:18:31.040]  president of france not of a nation state of an eu
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:34.720]  superstar and mac but macron you saw it in that video with
[2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:37.920]  abama you've seen it in many other interviews and he gave a speech where he
[2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:42.960]  held up the eu flag to me the eu flag is a flag of a dying project
[2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:46.960]  that's utterly failed and has frankly made the continent of europe
[2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:50.880]  massively more unsafe than ever should have been the migrant crisis
[2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:53.440]  i'm afraid is going to run on and on there's no solution
[2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:56.800]  austria are now saying let's shut the Mediterranean border
[2:18:56.800 --> 2:19:00.240]  let's shut the ability for people to come across but it's just not going to
[2:19:00.240 --> 2:19:03.280]  work the people are there there's three million of them
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:06.960]  according to another eu commissioner and they've been encouraged by the likes
[2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:10.160]  of Merkel to come cross borders and get into europe
[2:19:10.160 --> 2:19:13.840]  and macron hasn't got any answers all he can say is
[2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:17.280]  don't vote for me because the other lot are very scary vote for me for a
[2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:20.320]  continuation of what we got it just won't wash
[2:19:20.320 --> 2:19:23.520]  and i'm you know i'm enormously optimistic now that with brexit
[2:19:23.520 --> 2:19:27.760]  with trump and hopefully with le pen we're seeing i think a tipping point in
[2:19:27.760 --> 2:19:31.040]  the history of our continent our country
[2:19:31.040 --> 2:19:33.920]  and i think what we're going to see is what we saw before trump which is a
[2:19:33.920 --> 2:19:37.040]  lot of virtue signaling about yes i'm going to vote for the establishment
[2:19:37.040 --> 2:19:39.920]  i'm going to vote for macron but when it comes down to it
[2:19:39.920 --> 2:19:42.800]  they will side with le pen of course the other threat is they will go the
[2:19:42.800 --> 2:19:45.840]  opposite way and vote for the far left candidate melan
[2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:49.360]  shawnam will talk about him as we come back after the break we're talking to

[2:24:25.120 --> 2:24:30.640]  Alex Jones so talking to michael heaver of westmonster.com this
[2:24:30.640 --> 2:24:33.680]  is quite a new website with a lot of excellent
[2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:37.040]  breaking news he's also very active on twitter
[2:24:37.040 --> 2:24:42.400]  michael underscore heaver on twitter or westmonster on twitter is westmonster.com
[2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:46.080]  breaking news is the fact that it appears the police officer killed in
[2:24:46.080 --> 2:24:50.000]  yesterday's terror attack in france was one of the same police officers involved
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:53.840]  in saving lives of people during the batter clan massacre
[2:24:53.840 --> 2:24:59.520]  back in 2015 so that just adds an extra dimension of tragedy to what happened
[2:24:59.520 --> 2:25:02.960]  yesterday in france michael we got the first round of this
[2:25:02.960 --> 2:25:05.920]  election coming up we briefly touched on it but
[2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:09.840]  20% either way you can really you can't split these candidates it's within the
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:13.200]  margin of error you have macron the establishment candidate
[2:25:13.200 --> 2:25:16.160]  fionn the conservative then we have this guy melenchon
[2:25:16.160 --> 2:25:21.040]  who is basically come out of nowhere what do we know about him
[2:25:21.040 --> 2:25:24.720]  well he's basically an old throwback comedy but he's very
[2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:27.440]  sort of anti-euro on an economic front i mean
[2:25:27.440 --> 2:25:31.360]  don't forget the interesting thing and one of the biggest examples of how the
[2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:34.560]  EU has crushed democracy in europe is if you look
[2:25:34.560 --> 2:25:39.120]  at Greece now Greece you know the greek people are very very desperate they
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:42.800]  elected basically a far left far left revolutionary government
[2:25:42.800 --> 2:25:46.800]  called syriza who basically were meant to fight the the crushing austerity being
[2:25:46.800 --> 2:25:50.240]  posed upon them by the EU and they got elected
[2:25:50.240 --> 2:25:53.760]  and then crushed by the EU and weren't allowed to basically implement and had
[2:25:53.760 --> 2:25:58.800]  to submit to the to brussels so that that far left
[2:25:58.800 --> 2:26:02.880]  anti-euro sentiment is now building and what it shows you
[2:26:02.880 --> 2:26:06.800]  is that increasingly the people that are opposed to the EU it's got there are
[2:26:06.800 --> 2:26:10.560]  so many holes in it whether you're a far left communist
[2:26:10.560 --> 2:26:14.400]  supporter or far left socialist whether you're you know someone on the
[2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:17.600]  patriotic right if you're a libertarian if you're a
[2:26:17.600 --> 2:26:21.600]  center-right conservative you know there are so many problems with the EU now
[2:26:21.600 --> 2:26:24.240]  whatever your ideological background whatever your
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:27.760]  massive interest in in policy whether it's economic whether it's national
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:31.760]  security whether it's border controls the EU basically fails on all
[2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:34.720]  fronts you know it hasn't got a single initiative
[2:26:34.720 --> 2:26:38.400]  right it's got a migrant crisis it's got a eurozone that's going to collapse
[2:26:38.400 --> 2:26:41.680]  eventually we've seen the rise of people you know in Italy and
[2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:46.000]  all the rest of it five-star movement so for me it shows you once again how the
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.800]  EU is uniting people effectively against it
[2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:51.920]  for a range of different reasons because it's made so many
[2:26:51.920 --> 2:26:56.000]  bad flaws and I rather you know I rather like the delicious
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  prospect of there being a a all anti-euro
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:05.280]  Eurosceptic runoff between two people who strongly dislike the euro and the EU
[2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:07.440]  for very different reasons I think that's uh
[2:27:07.440 --> 2:27:11.440]  it would be quite the indictment on the EU that is the establishment's worst
[2:27:11.440 --> 2:27:14.640]  nightmare of course the top two candidates go through to the final
[2:27:14.640 --> 2:27:18.240]  round it could be the populists on both sides of
[2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:21.280]  the equation another thing that interested me is
[2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:24.960]  Marine Le Pen has support amongst young people in France aged
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:29.840]  18 to 24 39% of young people in those age brackets say they're
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:34.000]  going to vote for Marine Le Pen we saw with Brexit
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:37.440]  you know it's this is all people destroying young people's future they
[2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:41.200]  can't say that about France can they what's driving that phenomenon
[2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:46.000]  of youth energy behind Marine Le Pen well obviously people like me and
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:49.200]  you Paul you know across Europe we're driving the agenda now I think we you
[2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:52.480]  know we've grown up in a Europe much like many in France
[2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:55.760]  where we've seen the damage the open borders have done
[2:27:55.760 --> 2:27:59.920]  that we've seen this ridiculous throwback project be painted out as some
[2:27:59.920 --> 2:28:04.000]  forward-thinking globalist initiative that can solve all the world's
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:07.440]  problems and what it's actually done is completely
[2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:11.680]  failed on all fronts and I think you know if you were the thing I was saying
[2:28:11.680 --> 2:28:15.600]  about Britain I think is much the same in France is if you're a young 18-year-old
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:17.760]  school leaver you didn't do that well at school
[2:28:17.760 --> 2:28:20.640]  you want to go and work hard though you want to get that first job you want to
[2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:23.760]  go and get your foot on the ladder and you're now an 18-year-old in
[2:28:23.760 --> 2:28:27.520]  much in lots of parts of the EU and you're competing against people that
[2:28:27.520 --> 2:28:30.800]  are 30 40 years old that have come in from Eastern Europe or come
[2:28:30.800 --> 2:28:34.320]  right from around the world and so the jobs market I think in
[2:28:34.320 --> 2:28:38.240]  terms of job prospects is absolutely dismal now for a lot of young people
[2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:41.440]  not only that but wages have been absolutely crushed
[2:28:41.440 --> 2:28:44.560]  one other thing I would like to mention is you talked about young people that's
[2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:47.760]  very very true another set of people I would argue it's very
[2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:50.560]  important that the French people listen to and take seriously
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:53.200]  is the thoughts of the French police and their new poll that we ran on
[2:28:53.200 --> 2:28:57.840]  westminster.com is that 51 percent of French police
[2:28:57.840 --> 2:29:02.480]  this was before the Paris attack by the way 51 percent are planning to vote Le Pen
[2:29:02.480 --> 2:29:06.160]  and Le Pen today has basically said that she wants
[2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:11.040]  massive military step up against ISIS and she wants 15 000 extra troops on the
[2:29:11.040 --> 2:29:14.480]  streets in France to defend against ISIS terror
[2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:18.320]  attacks we've I've heard as well that on the day of
[2:29:18.320 --> 2:29:22.000]  the polling for the French election there are going to be 50 000
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:25.520]  French police they have to put out across the streets
[2:29:25.520 --> 2:29:28.720]  like to defend against terrorist attacks I mean if that doesn't show you that
[2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:33.760]  there's a war you have to deploy 50 000 troops and police
[2:29:33.760 --> 2:29:37.120]  to secure polling stations they're telling us Michael
[2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:41.360]  this is the new normal will French people reject that as part of their routine
[2:29:41.360 --> 2:29:44.640]  daily lives we'll come back with the final segment with Michael Heaver after
[2:29:44.640 --> 2:29:47.440]  the break this is the Alex Jones show live in four wars

[2:29:59.520 --> 2:30:03.840]  UC Berkeley which has been the battleground for free speech has cancelled
[2:30:03.840 --> 2:30:07.760]  conservative commentator Ann Coulter speaking event
[2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:12.960]  citing safety concerns Coulter did say that the university tried to reschedule
[2:30:12.960 --> 2:30:17.040]  the event in short notice for a later date on May 2nd which would
[2:30:17.040 --> 2:30:20.960]  be during dead week when students are not even in class as
[2:30:20.960 --> 2:30:25.120]  they prep for finals so essentially Berkeley is appeasing the
[2:30:25.120 --> 2:30:28.640]  temper tantrum throwing anti-fa by canceling
[2:30:28.640 --> 2:30:32.720]  conservative speaker events that were properly invited by
[2:30:32.720 --> 2:30:36.720]  recognized student groups Coulter has stated that she plans to speak at
[2:30:36.720 --> 2:30:40.560]  Berkeley despite the cancellation and has criticized Berkeley's chief of
[2:30:40.560 --> 2:30:44.800]  police for allowing Rodney King style riots to go on when only
[2:30:44.800 --> 2:30:48.640]  conservative speakers speak Berkeley was known as the birthplace of the
[2:30:48.640 --> 2:30:52.320]  student-led free speech movement in the 1960s and now
[2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:56.160]  it's becoming the birthplace of student-led censorship this is

[2:33:27.440 --> 2:33:30.960]  we are back on the alex jones show live final long segment with
[2:33:30.960 --> 2:33:35.760]  michael heaver of west monster dot com we're talking about the french election
[2:33:35.760 --> 2:33:38.560]  i'm going to wrap that up here in a second and move on to the
[2:33:38.560 --> 2:33:42.160]  uk election which of course was just announced a few days ago
[2:33:42.160 --> 2:33:46.480]  michael just to finish up on the french issue the polls are all over the place
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:51.680]  a can marina le pen win b if she does win is it the beginning of the end
[2:33:51.680 --> 2:33:56.080]  for the european union well i've heard you say nothing you're
[2:33:56.080 --> 2:33:59.440]  absolutely correct in your analysis poor that she can win but she needs to win
[2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:04.240]  that first round she needs to build up a real sense of momentum
[2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:08.480]  as a winner as someone who has not just done well in polls but has followed it
[2:34:08.480 --> 2:34:12.480]  through at the ballot box and i am optimistic that she can do it and one
[2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:15.840]  of the biggest reasons for that is if you dial down into some of the polling
[2:34:15.840 --> 2:34:19.280]  numbers you'll see that her voters her base is
[2:34:19.280 --> 2:34:23.200]  incredibly committed to her i think about over 83 percent of
[2:34:23.200 --> 2:34:27.680]  her voters are 100 percent going to vote 100 percent aren't going to switch you
[2:34:27.680 --> 2:34:31.360]  can pair that with a manual macron he has similar not overall numbers
[2:34:31.360 --> 2:34:34.400]  but then you dial down and about a third of his voters may switch
[2:34:34.400 --> 2:34:38.080]  and my feeling is you know i think the easiest victory for
[2:34:38.080 --> 2:34:41.760]  le pen would be if you took on france while i feel on because i think a lot of
[2:34:41.760 --> 2:34:46.000]  more left-wing workers and socialists would actually back le pen over him
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:49.280]  but i think she could actually be any of the three but i think it's vital that
[2:34:49.280 --> 2:34:53.200]  she comes top and uh just one more thing i wanted to mention was another stat
[2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:56.480]  i've seen recently just to show the scale of the problem that france has
[2:34:56.480 --> 2:35:01.840]  over 17 000 people now on the france serious anti-terror
[2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:07.520]  lips this is a small army over 2 000 of them i reckon to have
[2:35:07.520 --> 2:35:11.760]  gone and fought for the isis in iraq or syria this is the scale of the problem
[2:35:11.760 --> 2:35:15.440]  frankly i've heard and this might not be true but i've
[2:35:15.440 --> 2:35:19.600]  heard that there is some polling in france that suggests le pen is actually
[2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:23.040]  doing way better than polls the official poll suggests
[2:35:23.040 --> 2:35:26.000]  private polling showing she's doing very very well indeed
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:29.440]  i'm confident and and hopefully we see it be a great thing
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:33.120]  no that's why i've been hearing that the energy behind le pen on the ground is
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:36.240]  far more vigorous than the polls would suggest we will
[2:35:36.240 --> 2:35:40.000]  wait and see the first round is on sunday of course as you mentioned
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:44.480]  with the extremist the guy who killed the officer in paris yesterday
[2:35:44.480 --> 2:35:49.120]  was another extremist they had him on a list he had targeted officers before
[2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:54.000]  they let him go that is marine le pen's policy to deport those people if their
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:57.280]  friend citizens get them in jail she's the only one advocating that but let's
[2:35:57.280 --> 2:36:00.480]  move on to the uk because of course tereza may a few days
[2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:04.320]  go announce this snap election of course the primary question that people
[2:36:04.320 --> 2:36:08.640]  have is you know 48 percent of the country voted for remain
[2:36:08.640 --> 2:36:13.920]  does this election pose any kind of threat to the hard brexit that those
[2:36:13.920 --> 2:36:18.720]  that 52 percent of leave supporters really want to see push through is it
[2:36:18.720 --> 2:36:23.680]  going to be a threat to brexit realistically i don't think it i don't
[2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:28.000]  think it will be um but you never quite this could be this could be a quiet
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:31.040]  unpredictable election everyone's looking at the moment is this
[2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:36.560]  you've got tereza may who has what you know campaign to stay in the eu
[2:36:36.560 --> 2:36:39.680]  but is now saying that she's going to implement it and and basically deliver
[2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:42.240]  the brexit that most people want to see
[2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:46.320]  what the problem that the anti-brexit side have is they're just not that
[2:36:46.320 --> 2:36:49.920]  credible in this country you've got jeremy corbin a you know a throwback
[2:36:49.920 --> 2:36:54.560]  hard left socialist who has got no public support really outside of london
[2:36:54.560 --> 2:36:58.640]  and you know much like uh many of the people on the far left is very much of
[2:36:58.640 --> 2:37:01.440]  a niche character he hasn't got much widespread support
[2:37:01.440 --> 2:37:05.600]  you've then got the liberal democrats who are very much a tarnished brand but a
[2:37:05.600 --> 2:37:08.800]  bit of a resurgent force the interesting thing is going to be the
[2:37:08.800 --> 2:37:11.840]  anti-eu party that obviously i've been involved in the past and
[2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:15.520]  is niger forages party although he's not standing at this election himself
[2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:20.160]  is ukip because the weird system we have here for people that understand is we
[2:37:20.160 --> 2:37:24.480]  have this ridiculous voting system where it's all done on a constituency or
[2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:28.320]  regional basis so ukip for instance at the last election
[2:37:28.320 --> 2:37:32.960]  it got about four million votes but only one c because although it had a
[2:37:32.960 --> 2:37:35.280]  massive spread of millions of votes across the country
[2:37:35.280 --> 2:37:38.800]  geographically that was only concentrated in one area or enough to win
[2:37:38.800 --> 2:37:42.240]  any representation so the really bad thing about
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:46.080]  our voting system is that you can have millions of people totally unrepresented
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:49.280]  unlike say in the french presidential election where obviously
[2:37:49.280 --> 2:37:52.160]  everyone that votes whoever gets the most votes they all count they're not
[2:37:52.160 --> 2:37:56.080]  broken down in that way my feeling is that the labor party are
[2:37:56.080 --> 2:37:59.040]  going to get demolished because they've got this niche appeal
[2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:01.840]  and a lot of labor voters who are concerned about things like border
[2:38:01.840 --> 2:38:05.920]  controls and mass migration i could see going to ukip
[2:38:05.920 --> 2:38:09.280]  and frankly you know there's no app all the polls show there's no appetite in
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:13.200]  this country for reversal of brexit but we do know of course
[2:38:13.200 --> 2:38:17.200]  there are people like Gina miller a crowdfunding trying to block brexit these
[2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:20.320]  campaigners you know they're going to some of the big businesses and all the
[2:38:20.320 --> 2:38:23.280]  big ministers etc they're trying to block brexit
[2:38:23.280 --> 2:38:27.520]  but i'm quite optimistic that's not going to happen now there is this fear that
[2:38:27.520 --> 2:38:31.120]  you know tereza may is holding this election and let's not forget that she
[2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:34.160]  was a remainder she didn't campaign vigorously for it but she
[2:38:34.160 --> 2:38:37.600]  support the remain side there's this fear that she's going to
[2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:40.800]  build up this political capital providing she wins
[2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:43.200]  handsomely which the polls look like she will
[2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:47.840]  to try and make brexit her own so it becomes not so much the Boris Johnson
[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:51.760]  Michael Gove brexit but the tereza may brexit so then
[2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:55.200]  she has that political capital to call it her own
[2:38:55.200 --> 2:38:58.240]  and will then push for soft brexit you're saying you don't think that's going
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:03.280]  to happen right i think tereza may is long term if
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:06.480]  she backs down from a position of delivering a full brexit then ukip will
[2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:09.200]  surge to numbers that we've never seen before and i think the conservatives
[2:39:09.200 --> 2:39:12.080]  know that look let's not forget the only reason that david camera and the
[2:39:12.080 --> 2:39:15.600]  conservators had the referendum was because ukip and Nigel Farage forced
[2:39:15.600 --> 2:39:17.840]  their hand right the reason that we won the referendum
[2:39:17.840 --> 2:39:21.600]  was because Nigel Farage spearheaded it i think the conservators now
[2:39:21.600 --> 2:39:25.200]  backed into a corner with ukip but look i don't trust them and the biggest
[2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:28.720]  litmus test for all of this is going to be what are they going to do
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:33.760]  about mass immigration now the brexit conservative minister david davis
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:37.840]  along with Boris Johnson along with tereza may before the election was
[2:39:37.840 --> 2:39:40.240]  announced they made several comments each
[2:39:40.240 --> 2:39:43.520]  that basically we may have to go on with mass migration because
[2:39:43.520 --> 2:39:48.160]  how could big bosses possibly cope if they didn't have thousands and hundreds
[2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:50.960]  of thousands each year of unskilled workers pouring in
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:54.880]  from europe to keep wages at rock bottom now that if they intend to continue
[2:39:54.880 --> 2:39:58.720]  that and they can't blame EU open borders because we won't be in them
[2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:01.360]  then that is not going to go down well the other thing that isn't going to go
[2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:04.800]  down well is if they insist on a massive payment
[2:40:04.800 --> 2:40:08.480]  you know yunker and all the rest of minne bros was talking about 50 billion
[2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:13.120]  pounds being handed over i mean that is just not going to wash at all
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:17.200]  and i think the EU i you know i think they're going to try a quite hard line
[2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:19.600]  approach to negotiations on the basis that well
[2:40:19.600 --> 2:40:22.960]  if britain does really well then lots of other people are going to want to leave
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:26.480]  unfortunately if there is no deal it will hurt the european economies and people
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:30.400]  far more than it will hurt britain so i hope you know the EU nationally see
[2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:34.720]  sense on this but my feeling is there could well be no EU deal because the EU
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:38.480]  nationalists are going in this with a very very hard head it would seem
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:42.240]  now let's just break this down for people our american audience because i don't
[2:40:42.240 --> 2:40:46.560]  think they truly grasp the the situation with immigration in the united
[2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:49.840]  kingdom a tiny country a packed overcrowded
[2:40:49.840 --> 2:40:53.920]  country the transport is basically stuttering at this point
[2:40:53.920 --> 2:40:58.160]  the NHS waiting rooms are overflowing population of 60 million
[2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:02.400]  talk to people about the numbers of people who are coming into the uk every
[2:41:02.400 --> 2:41:05.440]  single year well at the post war average for
[2:41:05.440 --> 2:41:09.040]  britain you know as you say we're a very small country really geographically
[2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:13.200]  is that we had between 30 and 50 000 net
[2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:17.120]  per year coming in that was the post war average we're now looking
[2:41:17.120 --> 2:41:25.040]  we've had up to 330 000 net migration a year right so that's not 330 000 people
[2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:28.960]  coming in that's 330 000 more people coming in than
[2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:32.880]  leaving i mean these are just astronomical numbers
[2:41:32.880 --> 2:41:36.720]  and the thing is a lot of this is concentrated in certain areas
[2:41:36.720 --> 2:41:41.280]  you know london is is is just so overcrowded now it's ridiculous the
[2:41:41.280 --> 2:41:45.040]  transport station system you know the underground all the rest of it
[2:41:45.040 --> 2:41:49.440]  is really struggling NHS and hospitals you know just to give you an example of
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:53.040]  you're you're these people watching now a flavor though of the debate in this
[2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:55.680]  country is that politicians here will often talk
[2:41:55.680 --> 2:41:59.840]  about as an example a housing crisis they'll say
[2:41:59.840 --> 2:42:03.120]  well we're not building enough homes we're not building enough homes and what
[2:42:03.120 --> 2:42:06.400]  they never point out is the fact that how can you build enough homes for the
[2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:10.720]  people coming in at 330 000 net migration or
[2:42:10.720 --> 2:42:15.200]  even 200 000 net migration a year on top of everyone here that already
[2:42:15.200 --> 2:42:18.560]  needs a house you know that's what they always leave out
[2:42:18.560 --> 2:42:21.840]  and that's one of the crippling problems we're having in this country now the
[2:42:21.840 --> 2:42:25.440]  NHS as you say is another one there are so many problems building up and the
[2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:29.120]  scale upon which this is happening it's just been huge
[2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:33.360]  now if the conservatives think that they can come out of the EU
[2:42:33.360 --> 2:42:37.040]  and have a Britain that is controlling its borders but chooses
[2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:40.480]  to go on with a policy of mass migration even though we have control of our
[2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:44.080]  borders my feeling is you're going to see an absolute
[2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:48.720]  political revolution in this country because it'll be one step too far
[2:42:48.720 --> 2:42:52.160]  people this is the number one priority in the EU referendum
[2:42:52.160 --> 2:42:55.760]  controlling the borders ending mass migration and it was David Cameron
[2:42:55.760 --> 2:42:59.920]  himself with Theresa May as Home Secretary who put out a target of tens of
[2:42:59.920 --> 2:43:03.520]  thousands net migration a year and so far they've been nowhere near it
[2:43:03.520 --> 2:43:07.840]  they've got to deliver on this. People just don't quite grasp it you've
[2:43:07.840 --> 2:43:11.440]  got a nation of renters you've got a nation increasingly of people living
[2:43:11.440 --> 2:43:15.600]  with their parents to give people an idea to live in London to buy
[2:43:15.600 --> 2:43:20.400]  a two bedroom apartment in London a small two bedroom apartment
[2:43:20.400 --> 2:43:23.920]  in a council block which is the equivalent of government housing ex
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:26.640]  government housing you're looking at shelling out
[2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:31.040]  what are we talking in a in a half decent area you know five six seven
[2:43:31.040 --> 2:43:34.560]  hundred thousand pounds that's upwards of one million dollars
[2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:38.240]  people simply can't afford it it's not sustainable
[2:43:38.240 --> 2:43:42.080]  they talk about a housing crisis the fact they're bringing in net
[2:43:42.080 --> 2:43:46.880]  300 000 people every single year is never part of the debate
[2:43:46.880 --> 2:43:50.880]  and that's the rejection you saw with Brexit I want to talk about Brexit
[2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:53.920]  actually it's almost a year since the vote we had
[2:43:53.920 --> 2:43:57.920]  massive doomsday proclamations that when this vote went through if it went
[2:43:57.920 --> 2:44:01.360]  through for leave which it did we would instantly begin to see
[2:44:01.360 --> 2:44:05.920]  economic armageddon all these different companies deserting the UK
[2:44:05.920 --> 2:44:10.160]  what's happened in the 10 months since the brexit vote
[2:44:10.160 --> 2:44:14.160]  well things have been pretty good I mean tourism's up and retail sales are up
[2:44:14.160 --> 2:44:17.040]  and of course you won't hear any of this on the tv because the whole thing's
[2:44:17.040 --> 2:44:20.560]  been a disaster and a catastrophe the economic reality is not
[2:44:20.560 --> 2:44:22.960]  bared out any of the predictions from the
[2:44:22.960 --> 2:44:26.560]  cycled experts and one interesting thing I like to think about Paul
[2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:30.640]  isn't often discussed is if you think about the people that run Britain
[2:44:30.640 --> 2:44:34.320]  or you know and the run the treasury the people that made all these predictions
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:39.120]  the people whose job it is to get economic forecast correct
[2:44:39.120 --> 2:44:43.440]  these people didn't just get it wrong they got it catastrophically wrong
[2:44:43.440 --> 2:44:46.560]  some of them said that this country would be in recession
[2:44:46.560 --> 2:44:50.320]  and yet they've been proven to basically not know what they're talking
[2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:53.440]  about and the interesting thing about what we talk about the swamp and
[2:44:53.440 --> 2:44:57.200]  trunk and drain and the swamp how many of them have lost their jobs
[2:44:57.200 --> 2:45:00.160]  how many of these economists and these officials in the treasury
[2:45:00.160 --> 2:45:03.120]  that made all these predictions about what would happen with brexit and
[2:45:03.120 --> 2:45:06.800]  were proven basically to not have a clue what they were talking about
[2:45:06.800 --> 2:45:10.560]  have lost their jobs they're all still there they're all still making predictions
[2:45:10.560 --> 2:45:14.560]  oh the government's still relying on them to make the predictions about
[2:45:14.560 --> 2:45:17.600]  economic policy and that's the thing I find interesting now I don't think
[2:45:17.600 --> 2:45:20.400]  that's good enough anymore I think when we're looking at a brexit
[2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:23.920]  revolution and democracy spreading and the move against globalism
[2:45:23.920 --> 2:45:27.840]  we need some accountability here if we're relying on people to make economic
[2:45:27.840 --> 2:45:30.960]  forecasts in very important economic forecast don't forget
[2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:34.480]  you know some of those scare stories could have swung the referendum could
[2:45:34.480 --> 2:45:36.880]  have changed the course of this country's history
[2:45:36.880 --> 2:45:40.000]  and the people that made them and got them so badly wrong are just not
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  accountable in fact George Osborne who was the chancellor at the time is just
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:46.640]  to start who's just announced he's standing down as an MP
[2:45:46.640 --> 2:45:49.920]  by the way national doubled the national debt as well isn't he a great guy
[2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:52.640]  who oversaw these ridiculous economic forecasts
[2:45:52.640 --> 2:45:56.080]  it's just been made editor of the London even standard newspaper in London
[2:45:56.080 --> 2:46:00.560]  so you know this shows you failure in politics is sometimes rewarded it is
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:03.360]  quite bizarre they're rewarding people who've
[2:46:03.360 --> 2:46:06.640]  got it absolutely 100% wrong especially in terms of
[2:46:06.640 --> 2:46:10.720]  as he said economic forecast in the media regarding the media actually I wanted
[2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:13.440]  to talk about a big story you covered a few weeks ago
[2:46:13.440 --> 2:46:17.200]  which was you looked at the average age of people who are watching mainstream
[2:46:17.200 --> 2:46:21.440]  media broadcasts very interesting results tell us the
[2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:26.160]  figures well basically it shows you I think that the BBC was
[2:46:26.160 --> 2:46:31.440]  about 61% you know you're talking mid 50s even the hip channels that are sort
[2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:36.320]  of targeted I think E4 was one it's sort of mid 40s now
[2:46:36.320 --> 2:46:40.720]  so what it shows you is an entire generation of people
[2:46:40.720 --> 2:46:44.400]  that aren't tuned into this sort of scheduled programming
[2:46:44.400 --> 2:46:48.320]  of sit down at seven o'clock around the fire with your family type thing
[2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:52.560]  that's basically that's basically dying out and again I'm
[2:46:52.560 --> 2:46:55.680]  although there's a lot going on in the world it's scary and you know the ISIS
[2:46:55.680 --> 2:46:59.360]  threat in Europe and all the rest of it I find things like this incredibly
[2:46:59.360 --> 2:47:04.080]  exciting because it shows that you know people like you and info wars
[2:47:04.080 --> 2:47:07.920]  the impact is there now it's plain to see the audiences are dying out for a lot
[2:47:07.920 --> 2:47:10.640]  of mainstream news and even if people do watch it
[2:47:10.640 --> 2:47:14.400]  they pick out the bits they want they don't want to sit through one hour of
[2:47:14.400 --> 2:47:17.680]  political interviews to listen to the one person that they're interested in
[2:47:17.680 --> 2:47:21.120]  they'd rather go on YouTube an hour later and pick out that interview
[2:47:21.120 --> 2:47:25.040]  and it's making people quite proactive in a way in their engagement
[2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:28.560]  the democratic process and what's going on in the media so I find all this stuff
[2:47:28.560 --> 2:47:31.840]  fascinating I think we're going to see more and more and more of it we've seen
[2:47:31.840 --> 2:47:35.840]  obviously various other internet based media group startup
[2:47:35.840 --> 2:47:38.800]  and I think it's fantastic we're even seeing it by the way in sports in this
[2:47:38.800 --> 2:47:42.240]  country in Britain which is very interesting rather than just having paid
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:46.000]  pundits on TV that analyze games now you're having fan
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:49.360]  channels right so you're having people who are fans of teams
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:53.040]  going outside grounds and interviewing other fans about the game and not and
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:47:56.240]  you know I just find that exciting that it's expanding through the whole of our
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:47:59.440]  cultural fabric now and it's more interesting because it's
[2:47:59.440 --> 2:48:02.640]  more controversial they've got leeway to say exactly what they want they're
[2:48:02.640 --> 2:48:07.360]  not going to say the same cookie cutter crap that you see on sports commentary
[2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:10.560]  or on news commentary which is what the bvc is
[2:48:10.560 --> 2:48:15.200]  the average age of their view are 61 years old you know CNN is 59
[2:48:15.200 --> 2:48:18.720]  Fox News is even older I think it's something like 69 they're literally
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:22.560]  dying out they're getting decimated on YouTube which is why they're coming
[2:48:22.560 --> 2:48:26.000]  down with the censorship on that and it's really refreshing to see and that's
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:29.680]  why as you mentioned earlier more and more younger people are being drawn to
[2:48:29.680 --> 2:48:33.680]  our political message because we're on demand we're more accessible
[2:48:33.680 --> 2:48:37.040]  we're more controversial we're not controlled by anyone
[2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:40.080]  people don't tell us what to say we say what we think and that's what people
[2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:43.280]  want to see just in the final couple of minutes here Michael
[2:48:43.280 --> 2:48:46.640]  westmonster.com you start this website what backer
[2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:50.320]  I think it was about five six months ago now tell us about Westmonster
[2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:54.880]  yeah we started up in January it's me and Aaron Banks who was a major UKIP donor
[2:48:54.880 --> 2:48:59.280]  and it also is the chairman of the leave.au campaign group for Brexit who
[2:48:59.280 --> 2:49:02.880]  played such a fundamental role in in winning the referendum here
[2:49:02.880 --> 2:49:07.200]  and basically I mean my whole push on it is that I think
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:11.440]  you know my utopia politics being the new punk my I feel very very strongly now
[2:49:11.440 --> 2:49:14.480]  that the arguments that the likes of Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage and
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:18.880]  Donald Trump make on borders on culture on you know putting your own
[2:49:18.880 --> 2:49:23.040]  country's economic interests first I think these are mainstream values
[2:49:23.040 --> 2:49:26.960]  and I really resent the way that sometimes people push these ideas as
[2:49:26.960 --> 2:49:31.760]  being on the fringes of society and it's all a bit strange isn't it if you
[2:49:31.760 --> 2:49:35.200]  think mass migration is a bad thing and you must be a bit of a weirdo
[2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:38.880]  now that's sort of a very london centric quite well you know a lot of wealthy
[2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:41.680]  people who think they're very clever try pushing that messages through a lot of
[2:49:41.680 --> 2:49:44.960]  big media and what we're doing is actually breaking this down and
[2:49:44.960 --> 2:49:48.080]  pointing out in a lot of times the ridiculousness
[2:49:48.080 --> 2:49:51.840]  of the so-called centrist view I mean again we mentioned
[2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:56.880]  manual Macron what's centrist about keeping your country
[2:49:56.880 --> 2:50:01.280]  inside a dying EU project with a failed currency
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:05.040]  that's been a disaster in terms of the migrant crisis and jobs
[2:50:05.040 --> 2:50:09.200]  and economically and been a disaster in terms of national security
[2:50:09.200 --> 2:50:12.640]  that's the new fringe we're the mainstream and so
[2:50:12.640 --> 2:50:16.240]  we wanted to present a lot of the stories that are going on in europe
[2:50:16.240 --> 2:50:20.000]  and going with trump and brexit and push the good news of brexit because
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:22.880]  there's a lot of good economic news and just you know
[2:50:22.880 --> 2:50:26.160]  just point just point out and say you know we're the new mainstream is that
[2:50:26.160 --> 2:50:28.640]  that's how I think a lot of people feel now
[2:50:28.640 --> 2:50:32.240]  you're resonating with people we're resonating with people they're not
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:35.520]  that's why they're in a blind panic they are the new fringe as
[2:50:35.520 --> 2:50:39.520]  you said we are the emerging new front line of
[2:50:39.520 --> 2:50:44.080]  media and youthful energetic truth behind presidential candidates
[2:50:44.080 --> 2:50:47.440]  behind these issues that people really care about mass migration
[2:50:47.440 --> 2:50:51.360]  being prime amongst them. Michael Heaver westmonster.com thanks for

[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:54.400]  us officials announced yesterday that they would seek
[2:55:54.400 --> 2:55:59.040]  the arrest of wiki leaks founder julian assange that was a huge story
[2:55:59.040 --> 2:56:01.680]  yesterday it continues to rumble on today
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:05.920]  basically you know wiki leaks release has classified information
[2:56:05.920 --> 2:56:10.880]  it believes is in the public interest from anonymous sources
[2:56:10.880 --> 2:56:14.800]  the new york times and the washington post does exactly
[2:56:14.800 --> 2:56:18.800]  the same thing so why aren't their journalists being arrested
[2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:22.480]  too why aren't they being brought up on charge as well we know why
[2:56:22.480 --> 2:56:26.160]  because they're working directly with the deep state
[2:56:26.160 --> 2:56:29.600]  whereas julian assange and wiki leaks is working to expose
[2:56:29.600 --> 2:56:34.160]  the crimes of the deep state that's why he's under threat of arrest
[2:56:34.160 --> 2:56:39.440]  and they're not now attorney general jeff sessions has come out
[2:56:39.440 --> 2:56:43.680]  and pushed for assange's arrest of course he should be focusing on
[2:56:43.680 --> 2:56:48.480]  what he was brought into the trump administration to do which is arresting
[2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:52.960]  and deporting illegal aliens narco terrorists and drug dealers
[2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:58.000]  now he's moving over to focus on arresting julian assange again
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:01.520]  splitting with the trump base a lot of people are concerned about that
[2:57:01.520 --> 2:57:05.920]  let's be honest a lot of people have said that could be their final straw
[2:57:05.920 --> 2:57:09.840]  if julian assange is arrested again especially given the fact
[2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:13.120]  remember trump said quote i love wiki leaks
[2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:16.800]  i love wiki leaks that's what he said now julian assange is under threat
[2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:20.400]  of arrest now congressman pete king and we have this
[2:57:20.400 --> 2:57:23.920]  clip we can cue it up said yesterday on cnn that trump is
[2:57:23.920 --> 2:57:28.240]  seeing assange and wiki leaks from a quote different perspective
[2:57:28.240 --> 2:57:31.200]  here's the clip the president is seeing this now from a
[2:57:31.200 --> 2:57:34.640]  different perspective and realizing that yeah while maybe one day
[2:57:34.640 --> 2:57:38.880]  assange can help you overall he is this is damaging to the national interest
[2:57:38.880 --> 2:57:43.600]  of the united states and again he's put american lives at risk over the years
[2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:48.080]  so there you have pete king celebrating this decision how concerned should we be
[2:57:48.080 --> 2:57:51.680]  that people like pete king are celebrating the trump administration's
[2:57:51.680 --> 2:57:56.080]  decisions how concerned should we be that lindsay grayham is up on fox news
[2:57:56.080 --> 2:58:00.240]  saying he's quote the happiest dude ever given what's
[2:58:00.240 --> 2:58:03.760]  happening with syria nato and a bunch of other issues
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:07.840]  now let's be clear we're absolutely delighted that hillary clinton is not in
[2:58:07.840 --> 2:58:10.880]  the white house but let's also be clear in saying
[2:58:10.880 --> 2:58:14.160]  the elephant in the room is that many in trump's base
[2:58:14.160 --> 2:58:19.040]  are extremely concerned about these 180 reversals that have happened
[2:58:19.040 --> 2:58:23.040]  over the past month the potential arrest of julie and assange
[2:58:23.040 --> 2:58:26.880]  being one of them huge concern amongst the base many people have said that that
[2:58:26.880 --> 2:58:30.640]  is their red line that's the final straw they will abandon trump
[2:58:30.640 --> 2:58:34.160]  he's impressionable we need to talk to him and we'll continue to do so we'll
[2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:39.600]  be back with the next segment alex joneshow live don't go away

[3:00:04.160 --> 3:00:07.200]  the globalist great error is to believe that as they
[3:00:07.200 --> 3:00:13.120]  collapse humanity they end up on top the truth is humanity is coming down
[3:00:13.120 --> 3:00:19.920]  fast but we're miles above them on our journey to hell
[3:00:19.920 --> 3:00:28.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:31.440]  david knight is coming up with the fourth hour i'm going to break down some
[3:00:31.440 --> 3:00:34.800]  final news stories here for the moment though as i mentioned before the break
[3:00:34.800 --> 3:00:39.440]  we have attorney general jeff sessions indicating that he will support
[3:00:39.440 --> 3:00:44.480]  and push for the arrest of julien assange saying it's a priority
[3:00:44.480 --> 3:00:48.880]  i think arresting actual drug lords and narco terrorists should be a priority
[3:00:48.880 --> 3:00:52.560]  rather than somebody who leaks information that's in the public
[3:00:52.560 --> 3:00:56.960]  interest unlike the new york times in the washington post who leak
[3:00:56.960 --> 3:01:00.240]  information that's not even in the public interest which only serves to
[3:01:00.240 --> 3:01:04.160]  delegitimize and destabilize a presidency and a country
[3:01:04.160 --> 3:01:07.520]  in their own parties and interests they can leak that
[3:01:07.520 --> 3:01:11.520]  they don't face arrest julien assange faces arrest and now
[3:01:11.520 --> 3:01:14.960]  elements of the trump administration are pushing full weight
[3:01:14.960 --> 3:01:19.680]  for that to happen he's also making it a priority too
[3:01:19.680 --> 3:01:23.760]  basically continue the war on drugs in terms of marijuana we had a hill poll
[3:01:23.760 --> 3:01:27.760]  few days ago which found that 61 percent of americans want marijuana to be
[3:01:27.760 --> 3:01:31.360]  legalized a five percent increase in a year that's the
[3:01:31.360 --> 3:01:35.840]  highest ever support for the legalization of marijuana
[3:01:35.840 --> 3:01:39.520]  you know roger stone's been on here he's tweeted that he thinks
[3:01:39.520 --> 3:01:44.240]  attorney general jeff sessions has continued push to keep that criminal
[3:01:44.240 --> 3:01:50.000]  is draconian i agree with him why is he continuing the war on pot smokers
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:53.600]  why is he moving to target julien assange why not target
[3:01:53.600 --> 3:01:56.960]  the actual narco terrorists the hard drug dealers
[3:01:56.960 --> 3:02:00.400]  that are destabilizing the country target the drug lords
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:05.360]  deport the criminal illegal aliens why have they now shifted why are they now
[3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:09.680]  saying the priority is julien assange that's not the priority
[3:02:09.680 --> 3:02:13.680]  donald trump said quote i love wikileaks why has this change
[3:02:13.680 --> 3:02:16.960]  happened we're not sycophants we're free to criticize
[3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:20.480]  the trump administration when it does things we don't like
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:23.920]  when it breaks its promises and we're gonna do that
[3:02:23.920 --> 3:02:28.160]  doesn't mean we're abandoning trump it means we're still delighted there's no
[3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:31.760]  hillary clinton but again we're not sheep we're not sycophants
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:36.080]  we're gonna hold their feet to the fire because they represent you the american
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:38.400]  people you don't have to worship them you
[3:02:38.400 --> 3:02:40.880]  don't have to bow down and accept everything they say
[3:02:40.880 --> 3:02:44.080]  without question people have got serious concerns
[3:02:44.080 --> 3:02:47.440]  this is the elephant in the living room with trumps base and we're gonna
[3:02:47.440 --> 3:02:51.520]  call them out on it every opportunity we get in a functioning
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:55.760]  democracy that's the whole point let's hit a final news story here which is
[3:02:55.760 --> 3:03:00.080]  about youtube bbc news reports youtube to offer
[3:03:00.080 --> 3:03:04.240]  fake news workshops to teenagers youtube is launching a new campaign to
[3:03:04.240 --> 3:03:07.920]  tackle internet safety and issues around fake news the video streaming site
[3:03:07.920 --> 3:03:10.800]  has announced they're going to launch a workshop
[3:03:10.800 --> 3:03:15.840]  aimed at 13 to 18 year olds to help them spot fake news
[3:03:15.840 --> 3:03:19.520]  and to provide a guide as to what constitutes
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:24.080]  topics like hate and extremism while encouraging them to spread
[3:03:24.080 --> 3:03:28.000]  positive messages now if you actually look into what this
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:31.200]  is about which i did the people listed on this
[3:03:31.200 --> 3:03:36.560]  creators for change list of channels that they will promote on youtube
[3:03:36.560 --> 3:03:40.800]  it's basically the linda sarsaw islamist feminist angle
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:44.560]  this is a woman who has advocated sharia law who is linked
[3:03:44.560 --> 3:03:48.400]  to her mass who has spouted islamist propaganda
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:54.320]  who has called for ayan hersey ali a muslim reformist to have her genitals
[3:03:54.320 --> 3:04:00.480]  removed supported fgm and sharia law she's the person being pushed by youtube
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:04.560]  to tackle hate and extremism you can look at the other channels that they're
[3:04:04.560 --> 3:04:09.040]  pushing black lives matter masculinity so fragile
[3:04:09.040 --> 3:04:14.080]  my hijab story again it's all social justice warrior
[3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:18.240]  regressive left this crap which doesn't resonate with anyone
[3:04:18.240 --> 3:04:21.120]  you can go on their channels you can see the video views
[3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:24.400]  it's pathetic it's one thousand two thousand views
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:28.560]  we're decimating them they're nervous about it that's why they're target
[3:04:28.560 --> 3:04:31.840]  targeting us for censorship and demonetization
[3:04:31.840 --> 3:04:34.960]  while pushing these social justice warrior channels
[3:04:34.960 --> 3:04:38.640]  because again they don't resonate with anyone
[3:04:38.640 --> 3:04:43.520]  so they're having to rig the game to silence truly independent voices
[3:04:43.520 --> 3:04:47.680]  that people really want to hear that's going to wrap it up for my part in the
[3:04:47.680 --> 3:04:51.680]  alex germ show david night coming up fourth hour fresh
[3:04:51.680 --> 3:04:55.120]  breaking news it's the alex germ so live in four wars

[3:05:03.600 --> 3:05:07.520]  conservative commentator ann colter speaking event
[3:05:07.520 --> 3:05:12.720]  citing safety concerns colter did say that the university tried to reschedule
[3:05:12.720 --> 3:05:15.920]  the event in short notice for a later date on may
[3:05:15.920 --> 3:05:20.720]  second which would be during dead week when students are not even in class as
[3:05:20.720 --> 3:05:24.880]  they prep for finals so essentially berkeley is appeasing the
[3:05:24.880 --> 3:05:28.400]  temper tantrum throwing anti-fah by canceling
[3:05:28.400 --> 3:05:32.560]  conservative speaker events that were properly invited by
[3:05:32.560 --> 3:05:36.560]  recognized student groups colter has stated that she plans to speak at
[3:05:36.560 --> 3:05:40.800]  berkeley despite the cancellation and has criticized berkeley's chief of police
[3:05:40.800 --> 3:05:44.000]  for allowing rodney king style riots to go on
[3:05:44.000 --> 3:05:48.320]  when only conservative speakers speak berkeley was known as the birthplace of
[3:05:48.320 --> 3:05:51.520]  the student-led free speech movement in the 1960s
[3:05:51.520 --> 3:05:54.800]  and now it's becoming the birthplace of student-led
[3:05:54.800 --> 3:05:59.280]  censorship this is millie weaver reporting for info wars dot com
[3:05:59.280 --> 3:06:03.280]  today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors

[3:08:20.240 --> 3:08:24.240]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david knight on this friday april 21st
[3:08:24.240 --> 3:08:28.480]  sandwiched between uh 420 and earth day
[3:08:28.480 --> 3:08:33.040]  i guess uh they did earth day two days after 420 so people
[3:08:33.040 --> 3:08:37.280]  have enough time to prepare themselves mentally for the fallacies of earth day
[3:08:37.280 --> 3:08:42.560]  but uh we'll have that tomorrow but today we have a blackout in san francisco
[3:08:42.560 --> 3:08:46.080]  top of dredge report is showing that they've had about estimates right now
[3:08:46.080 --> 3:08:52.000]  about 95 000 people according to kgo and mbc
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:57.680]  and of course these are 88 outages that have spread across the area
[3:08:57.680 --> 3:09:01.840]  shut down businesses the bart station which is um
[3:09:01.840 --> 3:09:05.760]  their public transportation that they have their cable cars traffic lights
[3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:10.480]  so forth this is a good example folks that highlights
[3:09:10.480 --> 3:09:14.000]  the vulnerabilities of complicated infrastructure
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:18.080]  at the same time that we're moving to complicate our infrastructure even
[3:09:18.080 --> 3:09:22.800]  farther so that we can monitor and track
[3:09:22.800 --> 3:09:27.520]  and tax everything that everyone does i think it's interesting to note over the
[3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:30.320]  last week i've seen a number of articles of course
[3:09:30.320 --> 3:09:33.760]  it's almost like if you look at the car press anymore i'm somebody who likes
[3:09:33.760 --> 3:09:37.120]  cars if you look at the car press anymore all you see two things
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:41.360]  you see articles about hypercars and supercars that cost a couple of million
[3:09:41.360 --> 3:09:44.960]  dollars that none of us will ever see and that we're not going to see the
[3:09:44.960 --> 3:09:48.640]  technology filter down because the other part of the articles that are out there
[3:09:48.640 --> 3:09:51.680]  about self-driving cars i don't really care how
[3:09:51.680 --> 3:09:55.520]  they're powered i don't care if it's fuel cells or hydrogen
[3:09:55.520 --> 3:10:00.480]  or electricity or gasoline or diesel i don't really care
[3:10:00.480 --> 3:10:04.800]  as long as humans are in control of it and by humans i don't mean one or two
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:09.280]  people that are part of a massive corporation that's working hand in
[3:10:09.280 --> 3:10:11.840]  glove with the government or if it's the government itself that is going to
[3:10:11.840 --> 3:10:14.560]  be controlling all this those are the things that concern me
[3:10:14.560 --> 3:10:17.280]  and if you look at what's happening in the future
[3:10:17.280 --> 3:10:20.000]  when you look at what's going on with agenda 21 i think it's a good time we
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:23.760]  look at these types of power outages that hit
[3:10:23.760 --> 3:10:28.480]  again as the heart of the tech companies they're the same people who are
[3:10:28.480 --> 3:10:32.320]  bringing about the internet of things and they want
[3:10:32.320 --> 3:10:35.840]  your car to join the internet of things that they will own
[3:10:35.840 --> 3:10:40.160]  that they will control because they're going to drive you out of your car
[3:10:40.160 --> 3:10:43.680]  they're going to make it too expensive or they're going to make it too
[3:10:43.680 --> 3:10:46.800]  short lived for to make sense for you to own it
[3:10:46.800 --> 3:10:50.560]  you know they could mandate for example right today they could mandate
[3:10:50.560 --> 3:10:54.960]  everybody go to electric and make it so expensive with all the safety devices
[3:10:54.960 --> 3:10:59.120]  that you can't possibly afford to keep it for the
[3:10:59.120 --> 3:11:01.840]  short amount of time that's going to last before the batteries die i mean
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:04.640]  there's a lot of different ways that they can come up with planned obsolescence
[3:11:04.640 --> 3:11:08.320]  but the key is that they want to make sure that you don't own the car
[3:11:08.320 --> 3:11:11.280]  a few of them will own everything they will own the roads they'll own the toll
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:14.400]  roads this is one of the things that we have to be concerned about and watch
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:16.960]  out for when we look at the infrastructure bill that
[3:11:16.960 --> 3:11:20.320]  donald trump is talking about yes we do need our infrastructure fixed
[3:11:20.320 --> 3:11:23.920]  as i pointed out yesterday when a reporter from the nation went to south
[3:11:23.920 --> 3:11:27.360]  korea to see what the situation to report on the situation there
[3:11:27.360 --> 3:11:30.800]  he began his story by talking about how wonderful their airport was and the
[3:11:30.800 --> 3:11:34.880]  infrastructure that they had there but of course ours is not ours is crumbling
[3:11:34.880 --> 3:11:38.160]  the only thing that we invest in is surveillance technology
[3:11:38.160 --> 3:11:43.280]  and security guards and screening devices we don't invest in anything that
[3:11:43.280 --> 3:11:46.800]  actually serves us and only serves the control state
[3:11:46.800 --> 3:11:49.280]  and that's what we're going to be investing in if we're not careful this
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:11:54.320]  infrastructure bill will be used to create smart information highways and
[3:11:54.320 --> 3:11:58.400]  smart cities if we're not careful about what we're going to do
[3:11:58.400 --> 3:12:01.360]  and we'll wind up funding it because we don't want to raise taxes we want to
[3:12:01.360 --> 3:12:05.360]  have a nice infrastructure bill without anybody seeing
[3:12:05.360 --> 3:12:08.880]  the cost immediately so we'll go to foreign corporations
[3:12:08.880 --> 3:12:12.480]  and multinational corporations to finance toll roads
[3:12:12.480 --> 3:12:17.760]  that they will then own your cars will not be affordable for you to own
[3:12:17.760 --> 3:12:20.640]  they'll not be drivable by you it'll be the toll roads and the foreign
[3:12:20.640 --> 3:12:23.200]  corporations that will be controlling your transportation and
[3:12:23.200 --> 3:12:26.640]  tracking you everywhere and of course the people who want to get in on this
[3:12:26.640 --> 3:12:30.640]  are the automobile manufacturers themselves they realized
[3:12:30.640 --> 3:12:34.000]  that it was far more profitable for them to lease cars to you than it was to
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:38.080]  sell cars to you that's a great way to set up
[3:12:38.080 --> 3:12:42.480]  planned obsolescence but they know that it is even more profitable
[3:12:42.480 --> 3:12:48.240]  to go from leasing a car to leasing the rides and that's why
[3:12:48.240 --> 3:12:51.760]  Ford and GM and the rest of these people are pushing so hard working
[3:12:51.760 --> 3:12:56.240]  in conjunction with Uber with Lyft with other companies
[3:12:56.240 --> 3:13:00.320]  and in many cases setting up the infrastructure to do it themselves
[3:13:00.320 --> 3:13:03.280]  one of the things I think indicates this you know we're talking about this
[3:13:03.280 --> 3:13:06.320]  massive shutdown where everything just shuts down in san francisco
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:10.400]  because they've lost their power and think about what's going to happen
[3:13:10.400 --> 3:13:14.080]  on the roads when you have a blackout everybody's just going to freeze you're
[3:13:14.080 --> 3:13:16.800]  not going to be able to get anywhere you're not going to have control of
[3:13:16.800 --> 3:13:19.920]  anything it's all going to be connected it'll all be connected to them and of
[3:13:19.920 --> 3:13:23.120]  course they can shut you down if you've got outstanding
[3:13:23.120 --> 3:13:27.360]  fines or outstanding income tax or they've got a
[3:13:27.360 --> 3:13:31.200]  beef with your political views so forth and so on we'll see that happening
[3:13:31.200 --> 3:13:34.080]  everything that they're doing right now on the internet to free speech they'll
[3:13:34.080 --> 3:13:36.880]  do to you physically that's going to be coming
[3:13:36.880 --> 3:13:40.880]  let's take a look at this article here that's from a car and driver for example
[3:13:40.880 --> 3:13:43.120]  as I said most of the articles now they're like
[3:13:43.120 --> 3:13:46.400]  half these hypercars and half of it about the new
[3:13:46.400 --> 3:13:49.360]  coming technology and I thought it was kind of interesting because they said
[3:13:49.360 --> 3:13:53.040]  despite concerns Cadillac is now going to press forward with what they call their
[3:13:53.040 --> 3:13:56.720]  super cruise semi-autonomous technology
[3:13:56.720 --> 3:14:01.040]  General Motors intends to launch a semi-autonomous feature called super cruise
[3:14:01.040 --> 3:14:03.760]  they're going to do it later this year despite the fact that federal safety
[3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:08.240]  regulators have expressed concern about a key aspect of the system's design
[3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:10.960]  under certain highway conditions according to the company
[3:14:10.960 --> 3:14:15.520]  the super cruise system can follow lanes it can break it can control speed
[3:14:15.520 --> 3:14:20.000]  notice that caveat there under certain highway conditions under ideal
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:24.400]  conditions it can do that they're going to bring it out in the fall with their
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:29.120]  2018 Cadillac CT6 sedan they say it is quote true
[3:14:29.120 --> 3:14:32.640]  hands-free driving technology for the highway but it still requires you to pay
[3:14:32.640 --> 3:14:36.400]  close attention and so to get you to pay attention the nanny
[3:14:36.400 --> 3:14:40.480]  technology is going to monitor your head position
[3:14:40.480 --> 3:14:44.720]  if it decides that you are not paying attention
[3:14:44.720 --> 3:14:48.480]  that your head is not in the proper position or somehow whatever it's going
[3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:51.680]  to monitor your eyes I don't know how it's going to determine whether the nanny
[3:14:51.680 --> 3:14:54.560]  car is going to determine whether you're paying attention or not you're going
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:14:58.560]  to receive an escalating series of cues and warnings
[3:14:58.560 --> 3:15:02.640]  and nagging that will urge you to pay attention
[3:15:02.640 --> 3:15:06.720]  and if you don't do all of that then it's going to come to a stop
[3:15:06.720 --> 3:15:09.040]  but it isn't going to pull over to the side of the road it'll just stop where
[3:15:09.040 --> 3:15:11.760]  it is like right in the middle of the road like right in the middle of the
[3:15:11.760 --> 3:15:15.520]  interstate and so you see the obvious problem with this right
[3:15:15.520 --> 3:15:19.360]  that if this car is going along and it decides that it's going to stop it might
[3:15:19.360 --> 3:15:23.520]  do it pretty quickly or even if you catch it
[3:15:23.520 --> 3:15:27.520]  and you slow down maybe the guy behind you isn't going to look when you stop a
[3:15:27.520 --> 3:15:31.360]  car especially on the interstate which is most likely where you're going to use
[3:15:31.360 --> 3:15:34.640]  supercruise right it's not going to be when you're going
[3:15:34.640 --> 3:15:37.200]  through the town and you've got a lot of traffic lights but on the interstate it's
[3:15:37.200 --> 3:15:41.520]  just going to shut down you do that and at some point
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:46.240]  as the cars start to back up somebody is going to get rear-ended
[3:15:46.240 --> 3:15:50.720]  somebody's going to get hurt but we don't worry about that because this
[3:15:50.720 --> 3:15:55.040]  is the kind of what we used to call a feature creep when we were designing
[3:15:55.040 --> 3:15:59.200]  systems we would say you're going to keep adding bells and whistles to the system
[3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:02.640]  you're going to have this feature creep well these are creepy features and
[3:16:02.640 --> 3:16:06.720]  it's just technology for bragging rights and to
[3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:12.240]  experiment on the road against you now the national highway traffic safety
[3:16:12.240 --> 3:16:17.360]  association and i sometimes refer to as knitsa they had a
[3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:21.360]  lawyer in november 2016 his name was paul hemmersbog
[3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:26.000]  and he wrote to he was their chief lawyer he wrote quote we note that gm indicates
[3:16:26.000 --> 3:16:28.480]  that when the driver is unable unwilling to take control of the vehicle the
[3:16:28.480 --> 3:16:31.760]  system will bring the vehicle to a stop in or near the roadway
[3:16:31.760 --> 3:16:35.600]  we urge gm to fully consider the likely operation of the system
[3:16:35.600 --> 3:16:39.280]  it is contemplating and ensure this fallback solution does not present an
[3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:42.480]  unreasonable risk to safety and they might get
[3:16:42.480 --> 3:16:46.080]  recalls if they put this out and don't follow those rules right well what
[3:16:46.080 --> 3:16:48.960]  happened well we find out that after he wrote that
[3:16:48.960 --> 3:16:54.080]  letter general motors hired him say that's the way that it works
[3:16:54.080 --> 3:16:58.080]  whether you're a big pharma or you're the big auto companies or whoever you
[3:16:58.080 --> 3:17:01.600]  can get rid of these little nagging regulatory issues by
[3:17:01.600 --> 3:17:05.600]  hiring the right people hiring them away if they give you a problem you just buy
[3:17:05.600 --> 3:17:08.240]  them off okay i don't know if that's what happened with
[3:17:08.240 --> 3:17:11.760]  this guy but it certainly looks suspicious we have seen that happen
[3:17:11.760 --> 3:17:15.600]  many many times in many different ways but the fact remains
[3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:20.880]  that you're going to have the government bend over backwards to open up the roads
[3:17:20.880 --> 3:17:24.720]  to this technology that is not tested and they're going to test it
[3:17:24.720 --> 3:17:27.840]  on the roads and where is this all headed well we had
[3:17:27.840 --> 3:17:31.600]  just a few days ago an article a very long article from the wall street
[3:17:31.600 --> 3:17:36.640]  journal called the rise of the smart city see this is all about agenda 21
[3:17:36.640 --> 3:17:39.920]  this is about confining you to the cities and controlling you
[3:17:39.920 --> 3:17:43.360]  within the cities very tightly controlling you making sure that you're
[3:17:43.360 --> 3:17:46.640]  not going to be getting out of the cities and going into the
[3:17:46.640 --> 3:17:52.080]  area the rural areas where you can now can travel without their
[3:17:52.080 --> 3:17:54.480]  permission you won't be able to do that with their little
[3:17:54.480 --> 3:17:58.640]  electric cars they're in limited range and their smart highways
[3:17:58.640 --> 3:18:02.320]  and so this is all in praise of the smart city
[3:18:02.320 --> 3:18:06.080]  at wall street journal and of course a lot of organizations have been set up
[3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:09.040]  grants have been set up for smart cities this is nothing new
[3:18:09.040 --> 3:18:13.040]  it's just yet another article that is praising
[3:18:13.040 --> 3:18:16.240]  this agenda 21 approach of concentrating people in the cities and then
[3:18:16.240 --> 3:18:19.040]  controlling them so they talk about the internet of things they talk about
[3:18:19.040 --> 3:18:23.280]  how they can use inexpensive sensors to track a vast array of information things
[3:18:23.280 --> 3:18:26.720]  like gunshots or traffic or air pollution
[3:18:26.720 --> 3:18:31.440]  and then of course there's the widespread use of smartphones and mobile devices
[3:18:31.440 --> 3:18:34.480]  that will let them monitor you and then they get to the bottom of all this and
[3:18:34.480 --> 3:18:37.600]  they say well you know all this data collection really kind of raises
[3:18:37.600 --> 3:18:42.000]  understandable privacy concerns and then they immediately push back but
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:44.880]  cities understand that and they're going to make sure that really doesn't happen
[3:18:44.880 --> 3:18:47.840]  so you don't have to worry about that and then they focus only on the
[3:18:47.840 --> 3:18:52.720]  upsides of this technology never talking about the downsides of this that's
[3:18:52.720 --> 3:18:55.840]  why we cover this because you have to understand
[3:18:55.840 --> 3:19:00.480]  where this is headed this is headed to a situation that is going to
[3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:05.440]  tax and track everything that you do and of course they're going to profit
[3:19:05.440 --> 3:19:09.360]  immensely from this these corporations that not only will make more money by
[3:19:09.360 --> 3:19:12.720]  leasing you the cars but they're also going to make money by selling
[3:19:12.720 --> 3:19:16.480]  information about you they're not just going to give it to the government when
[3:19:16.480 --> 3:19:19.520]  the government demands it they're also going to sell all this
[3:19:19.520 --> 3:19:22.960]  information so there's another story on car and driver about how automakers will
[3:19:22.960 --> 3:19:26.880]  soon have new ways to profit from driver data they said there's so much data
[3:19:26.880 --> 3:19:30.160]  that is streaming already for modern cars that automakers have trouble
[3:19:30.160 --> 3:19:33.680]  making sense of it all and they said that now
[3:19:33.680 --> 3:19:37.360]  subcontractors like delphi automatic are going out there
[3:19:37.360 --> 3:19:40.720]  and automotive rather are buying up all these different companies that are
[3:19:40.720 --> 3:19:44.240]  going to aggregate the information they're going to sell it to interested
[3:19:44.240 --> 3:19:49.280]  parties just like google facebook and your isp provider that's where this is
[3:19:49.280 --> 3:19:52.000]  all headed a lot of money for them to establish

[3:25:55.360 --> 3:25:58.720]  you know one of the things i was talking about in the last section
[3:25:58.720 --> 3:26:06.240]  was the move by the government by the car companies to take over our
[3:26:06.240 --> 3:26:08.880]  transportation and you know it's kind of funny
[3:26:08.880 --> 3:26:13.280]  general motors who's going to be putting out a car system that if it
[3:26:13.280 --> 3:26:16.640]  doesn't think that you're paying enough attention it will punish you by just
[3:26:16.640 --> 3:26:19.680]  slamming on the brakes there wherever it happens to be on the interstate
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:22.960]  and everybody else can just try to react to that
[3:26:22.960 --> 3:26:26.560]  now they have in venezuela slammed the brakes on
[3:26:26.560 --> 3:26:30.000]  gm they've confiscated gm's automotive
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:34.480]  factory and we have this story on info wars.com before seizing general motors
[3:26:34.480 --> 3:26:38.560]  venezuela tried to make a car partnering with iran this was like
[3:26:38.560 --> 3:26:42.000]  seven years ago and they came up you'll see that picture on the article the
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:48.720]  car was the terpial uh it's kind of funny uh because uh
[3:26:48.720 --> 3:26:52.080]  the thing it kind of sounds like a terpid car which is actually kind of
[3:26:52.080 --> 3:26:55.680]  reflection of the policies there in venezuela socialist policies
[3:26:55.680 --> 3:27:01.200]  terpid, foul, base, wicked, morally depraved, you know just steal whatever you
[3:27:01.200 --> 3:27:04.160]  want and of course we saw this happen with Hugo Chavez
[3:27:04.160 --> 3:27:08.080]  he nationalized a lot of industries and then he was eventually thrown out a
[3:27:08.080 --> 3:27:11.600]  coalition of people who were conservatives libertarians even
[3:27:11.600 --> 3:27:15.680]  socialists threw this guy out because he was nothing but a
[3:27:15.680 --> 3:27:19.360]  kleptocrat see socialism communism always devolves
[3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:22.640]  into a kleptocracy there you can see the the terpial
[3:27:22.640 --> 3:27:26.720]  or as i like to call the terpid um it was funny when they're talking about it
[3:27:26.720 --> 3:27:30.560]  uh like venezuela and iran will deliver their first
[3:27:30.560 --> 3:27:34.400]  300 or they got a big ambitious plan there they're going to make
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:38.080]  300 cars now anybody that knows anything about
[3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:41.840]  tooling up to make a car you know that you're not going to set up to do 300
[3:27:41.840 --> 3:27:44.720]  unless you're going to set up some kind of a hyper car that's going to sell for
[3:27:44.720 --> 3:27:48.800]  millions of dollars but they're going to have their first 300 anti-imperialist
[3:27:48.800 --> 3:27:52.560]  cars and i looked at that anti what is an anti-imperialist car
[3:27:52.560 --> 3:27:57.120]  is that something that is opposed to the old chrysler imperial uh
[3:27:57.120 --> 3:28:00.720]  exactly the opposite chrysler imperial actually it looked very much like
[3:28:00.720 --> 3:28:05.600]  some car from the 1970s and of course it failed
[3:28:05.600 --> 3:28:09.360]  just like their socialist policies from the early 20th century have failed
[3:28:09.360 --> 3:28:13.120]  because they as i was saying they always devolved into a kleptocracy
[3:28:13.120 --> 3:28:17.680]  when Hugo Chavez went in and seized all these other industries and he was
[3:28:17.680 --> 3:28:21.040]  eventually driven out by coalition across the spectrum because they
[3:28:21.040 --> 3:28:25.840]  understood he was just a crook and when he got driven out he and his
[3:28:25.840 --> 3:28:28.800]  friends who had nationalized all these different
[3:28:28.800 --> 3:28:32.400]  corporations then decided at the last minute that they would privatize them
[3:28:32.400 --> 3:28:35.200]  and that they would be the ones who would be holding
[3:28:35.200 --> 3:28:38.800]  the stock in these companies that's exactly the way
[3:28:38.800 --> 3:28:42.720]  this always works out but we have to be very careful in this country
[3:28:42.720 --> 3:28:47.360]  as to allowing these people to take over all of our
[3:28:47.360 --> 3:28:51.040]  freedom of transportation that's what's on the chopping block here folks
[3:28:51.040 --> 3:28:55.280]  it's not simply a car factory they're taking over our freedom of movement to
[3:28:55.280 --> 3:28:59.360]  confine us into their quote-unquote smart cities
[3:28:59.360 --> 3:29:02.320]  now when we come back i want to talk about the move
[3:29:02.320 --> 3:29:07.600]  by general by attorney general sessions saying that they're going to
[3:29:07.600 --> 3:29:10.720]  seek a way to come after julie and assange i want to talk about freedom of
[3:29:10.720 --> 3:29:14.240]  the press and what's involved in that and as we look at this
[3:29:14.240 --> 3:29:18.640]  attack in paris paul watson did a great job of covering the politics there in
[3:29:18.640 --> 3:29:22.080]  europe of course but we need to take a look at what is happening
[3:29:22.080 --> 3:29:26.080]  with muslim culture in america how do we
[3:29:26.080 --> 3:29:30.720]  counter that will they take that over will they take over our culture will it
[3:29:30.720 --> 3:29:34.000]  be something that we see happening in this country so we're going to take a
[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:48.240]  look at the move of islam in america say with us we'll be right back
[3:29:48.240 --> 3:29:52.160]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:29:52.160 --> 3:29:56.880]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:56.880 --> 3:30:03.120]  you see berkeley which has been the battleground for free speech has
[3:30:03.120 --> 3:30:07.600]  canceled conservative commentator and culture speaking event
[3:30:07.600 --> 3:30:12.800]  citing safety concerns culture did say that the university tried to reschedule
[3:30:12.800 --> 3:30:16.000]  the event in short notice for a later date on may
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:20.800]  second which would be during dead week when students are not even in class as
[3:30:20.800 --> 3:30:24.960]  they prep for finals so essentially berkeley is appeasing the
[3:30:24.960 --> 3:30:28.480]  temper tantrum throwing anti-faw by canceling
[3:30:28.480 --> 3:30:32.560]  conservative speaker events that were properly invited by
[3:30:32.560 --> 3:30:36.560]  recognized student groups culture has stated that she plans to speak at
[3:30:36.560 --> 3:30:40.800]  berkeley despite the cancellation and has criticized berkeley's chief of police
[3:30:40.800 --> 3:30:44.640]  for allowing rodney king style riots to go on when only
[3:30:44.640 --> 3:30:48.800]  conservative speakers speak berkeley was known as the birthplace of the student

[3:33:24.000 --> 3:33:30.160]  want to switch gears here to attacks on what i see as the first amendment attacks
[3:33:30.160 --> 3:33:34.320]  on wiki leaks and i think this headline from any war says that all attorney
[3:33:34.320 --> 3:33:39.440]  general sessions seeks to jail publishers of leaks this is the essence
[3:33:39.440 --> 3:33:44.480]  of what we're looking at here and when you look at the most recent
[3:33:44.480 --> 3:33:50.560]  anger that we've seen from pompio about cia director pompio saying hey
[3:33:50.560 --> 3:33:55.040]  these people are our enemies we need to do something about it i think it has a
[3:33:55.040 --> 3:33:57.840]  lot to do with vault seven coming out and when i look at vault seven i have to
[3:33:57.840 --> 3:34:02.720]  wonder because i had some people point this out i don't know if these hacks
[3:34:02.720 --> 3:34:07.920]  that they had funded and curated i don't know if those are classified many
[3:34:07.920 --> 3:34:11.040]  people said well you know they're not going to be classified because if they
[3:34:11.040 --> 3:34:16.000]  were classified then the cia that is pushing these
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:19.920]  things out onto your computers sprinkling them out in the public
[3:34:19.920 --> 3:34:23.680]  domain they would be distributing classified information and they could
[3:34:23.680 --> 3:34:28.000]  go to jail wouldn't that be interesting so they don't classify these
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:30.720]  hacks this code that they're putting onto your computer
[3:34:30.720 --> 3:34:34.480]  they don't copyright it either because they want to keep it secret
[3:34:34.480 --> 3:34:37.920]  and they don't control it either because it leaked out and it was out there one
[3:34:37.920 --> 3:34:42.240]  of the things that wiki leaks was doing was warning people about this
[3:34:42.240 --> 3:34:45.920]  so that the different internet providers
[3:34:45.920 --> 3:34:51.680]  and software companies could fix the holes that the cia had exploited
[3:34:51.680 --> 3:34:57.680]  to give you the citizens of america the citizens of all over the country all
[3:34:57.680 --> 3:35:01.680]  over the world to give all of us who aren't
[3:35:01.680 --> 3:35:07.120]  part of this deep dark secret state to give us the ability to protect
[3:35:07.120 --> 3:35:11.360]  ourselves not just from them but from any criminals who might get this
[3:35:11.360 --> 3:35:15.520]  information use it to steal our identity or steal into steal our bank
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:20.320]  account or do any number of things because we are all at risk when the cia
[3:35:20.320 --> 3:35:24.480]  creates these burglar tools and puts them out for everybody to use
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:29.040]  and then tells different companies that have relationships with them don't
[3:35:29.040 --> 3:35:32.960]  fix those holes so wiki leaks put that information out there a lot of the
[3:35:32.960 --> 3:35:35.920]  companies uh did not want to have any more information
[3:35:35.920 --> 3:35:38.800]  about that did not correspond to them did not fix the holes they've left these
[3:35:38.800 --> 3:35:42.560]  things vulnerable so you have a lot of very powerful
[3:35:42.560 --> 3:35:46.320]  multinational corporations part of the military industrial complex the military
[3:35:46.320 --> 3:35:51.920]  industrial surveillance complex that is now working with the cia they're also
[3:35:51.920 --> 3:35:55.120]  going to be exposed and shamed and humiliated by wiki leaks because they're
[3:35:55.120 --> 3:36:00.800]  going to talk about who is not fixing the vulnerabilities in their software
[3:36:00.800 --> 3:36:03.600]  they've already mentioned that google didn't seem to be very responsive i
[3:36:03.600 --> 3:36:06.960]  don't know if that's changed since then but they said they're going to put out
[3:36:06.960 --> 3:36:10.240]  a list talking about those who wanted to fix it and those who didn't they said
[3:36:10.240 --> 3:36:13.680]  for example sisco was very interested in fixing their stuff and others they
[3:36:13.680 --> 3:36:16.000]  they mentioned saying hey they got in contact with us
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:18.960]  we've been working with them to fix the vulnerabilities
[3:36:18.960 --> 3:36:23.440]  and uh their software but others who have relationships with the government
[3:36:23.440 --> 3:36:27.120]  don't want to do it but i want to talk about the legal aspects of this
[3:36:27.120 --> 3:36:31.600]  they have this story on the washington post saying that the justice department
[3:36:31.600 --> 3:36:36.720]  is debating charges against wiki leaks members because of ci
[3:36:36.720 --> 3:36:40.080]  materials and so forth and so on and of course it's interesting that
[3:36:40.080 --> 3:36:44.240]  the washington post for many years and so is the new york times they
[3:36:44.240 --> 3:36:47.840]  publish people who are whistleblowers you know i mean
[3:36:47.840 --> 3:36:52.880]  when people expose criminal actions by our government
[3:36:52.880 --> 3:36:59.120]  should we the people not know that i think that new york times and cnn and
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:03.280]  washington post and wiki leaks and info wars anybody who publishes that i
[3:37:03.280 --> 3:37:06.240]  think we ought to be grateful that that kind of information is published
[3:37:06.240 --> 3:37:10.240]  instead of throwing the whistleblowers in jail throwing the journalists in jail
[3:37:10.240 --> 3:37:15.280]  which is what obama wanted to do obama put more journalists and whistleblowers
[3:37:15.280 --> 3:37:20.960]  in jail using a 100 year old act the 1917 espionage
[3:37:20.960 --> 3:37:24.480]  act he put more journalists and whistleblowers in jail than all the other
[3:37:24.480 --> 3:37:28.560]  presidents before him combined so is this going to be the continuation
[3:37:28.560 --> 3:37:32.400]  uh the continuing policy of the trump administration i hope not
[3:37:32.400 --> 3:37:37.680]  i hope not and the attorney for julie assange his name is barry j pollock
[3:37:37.680 --> 3:37:40.800]  said that the justice department officials had not discussed with him or
[3:37:40.800 --> 3:37:44.480]  assange the status of any investigation despite his request that they do so
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:48.480]  he said there was quote no legitimate basis for the department of justice to
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:51.360]  treat wiki leaks differently than it treats other journalists he said the
[3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:53.760]  fact of the matter is of course they've tried to
[3:37:53.760 --> 3:37:57.840]  jail journalists when you expose their criminal actions they don't do anything
[3:37:57.840 --> 3:38:01.280]  to the people who are violating the law violating the constitution
[3:38:01.280 --> 3:38:04.640]  violating the trust that has been put in them the blind trust
[3:38:04.640 --> 3:38:07.200]  that we put in these people because we're not allowed to see anything that
[3:38:07.200 --> 3:38:11.200]  they do they operate in the dark trust me it's a matter of national security i
[3:38:11.200 --> 3:38:14.480]  can't tell you anything about it they redact and black out everything
[3:38:14.480 --> 3:38:18.640]  that's what you ought to be ashamed ashamed of and angry about
[3:38:18.640 --> 3:38:22.240]  but they're not ashamed of it and the american people aren't angry enough
[3:38:22.240 --> 3:38:25.120]  about it and so what they do is they jail the
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:29.280]  whistleblowers they jail the people who expose the crimes but the criminals
[3:38:29.280 --> 3:38:32.640]  and the government stay there he said the fact of the matter is this is
[3:38:32.640 --> 3:38:36.000]  julie assange lawyer pollock however frustrating it might be to whoever
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:40.960]  looks bad when the information is published wiki leaks is a publisher
[3:38:40.960 --> 3:38:47.360]  and they are publishing truthful truthful information folks and it is in
[3:38:47.360 --> 3:38:52.640]  the public's interest truthful information in the public's
[3:38:52.640 --> 3:38:57.120]  interest democracy he said thrives because there are
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:01.120]  independent journalists reporting on what the government is doing i mean even
[3:39:01.120 --> 3:39:04.560]  the washington post they've changed their moniker and it's a pretty
[3:39:04.560 --> 3:39:07.840]  stupid moniker especially when you look at the way the washington post is
[3:39:07.840 --> 3:39:11.520]  slanting the information but of course their subtitle their their new motto is
[3:39:11.520 --> 3:39:14.880]  democracy dies in darkness well it does die in darkness
[3:39:14.880 --> 3:39:18.800]  if you're allowed to hide all this information and if you're allowed to
[3:39:18.800 --> 3:39:23.920]  are they going to then if wiki leaks or whistleblower exposes this
[3:39:23.920 --> 3:39:27.440]  i mean is it okay for the washington post to publish something
[3:39:27.440 --> 3:39:30.880]  that a whistleblower puts out but if wiki leaks does it wiki leaks is going
[3:39:30.880 --> 3:39:33.840]  to go to jail what if wiki leaks publishes at
[3:39:33.840 --> 3:39:37.360]  first and then the washington post quotes what wiki leaks
[3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:40.320]  puts out or they link to what wiki leaks puts out
[3:39:40.320 --> 3:39:43.120]  is then the washington post is going to go to jail do you understand
[3:39:43.120 --> 3:39:47.760]  there is no end when we get on this slippery slope of censorship
[3:39:47.760 --> 3:39:50.720]  to say that we can't know what's going on with our government even when it's
[3:39:50.720 --> 3:39:54.800]  violating the laws wiki leaks lawyer pollock noted the
[3:39:54.800 --> 3:39:57.520]  course of the obama administration has been no shrinking violent when it came
[3:39:57.520 --> 3:40:00.000]  to pursuing reporters and journalists like i said they've
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:04.160]  arrested more in the last 100 years and all the previous presidents combined
[3:40:04.160 --> 3:40:08.320]  and remember we had the cia director the new cia director called wiki leaks a
[3:40:08.320 --> 3:40:12.160]  non-state hostile intelligence service
[3:40:12.160 --> 3:40:16.320]  and i would say that what we are continually seeing
[3:40:16.320 --> 3:40:23.360]  is that the cia is a secret state that is hostile to our constitution hostile to
[3:40:23.360 --> 3:40:27.360]  the values that we want in this country they don't make us
[3:40:27.360 --> 3:40:31.600]  safer they make us less safe vault seven is a good example of it
[3:40:31.600 --> 3:40:35.440]  they collect and create these burglary tools and leave them out there for
[3:40:35.440 --> 3:40:39.200]  anybody and everybody to use and they tell these companies
[3:40:39.200 --> 3:40:42.160]  don't fix the vulnerabilities that they've worked with to create these
[3:40:42.160 --> 3:40:45.040]  vulnerabilities and then they also point out in a recent
[3:40:45.040 --> 3:40:48.800]  washington post op-ed piece julien assange said that his group's motive was
[3:40:48.800 --> 3:40:52.320]  quote identical to the motive claimed by the new york times in the washington
[3:40:52.320 --> 3:40:55.280]  post to publish newsworthy content he said the media
[3:40:55.280 --> 3:40:58.640]  has a long history of speaking truth to power
[3:40:58.640 --> 3:41:04.080]  with perlorned or leaked material and he gives some examples jack anderson's
[3:41:04.080 --> 3:41:08.320]  reporting on the cia's enlistment of the mafia to kill fidel castrow
[3:41:08.320 --> 3:41:12.880]  maybe the public should consider whether they want the cia doing that type of
[3:41:12.880 --> 3:41:16.800]  thing should the cia be assassinating people well i guess we've
[3:41:16.800 --> 3:41:19.680]  had that discussion and the public is just fine with that as long as we do it
[3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:23.760]  with drones and that sort of thing i'm not fine with it but public seems to be
[3:41:23.760 --> 3:41:26.880]  fine with it nevertheless the providence journal bulletin's
[3:41:26.880 --> 3:41:30.880]  release of president nixon's stolen tax returns the new york times
[3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:35.040]  publication of the stolen pentagon papers remember that the post
[3:41:35.040 --> 3:41:40.160]  tenacious reporting of watergate leaks and of course that was being leaked to
[3:41:40.160 --> 3:41:44.000]  them by the number two guy at the fbi and of course the fbi's never been
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:47.680]  political i'll go back and look at the history of
[3:41:47.680 --> 3:41:50.960]  jagger hoover and this is his number two guy okay
[3:41:50.960 --> 3:41:55.600]  nevertheless uh signs wrote he says i hope historians place wiki leaks
[3:41:55.600 --> 3:42:00.720]  publications in this pantheon yet there's widespread calls to prosecute me
[3:42:00.720 --> 3:42:04.080]  and this is something he wrote before they started talking about that
[3:42:04.080 --> 3:42:08.960]  he says he believes that the uh justice department rules barred a prosecution
[3:42:08.960 --> 3:42:14.400]  of him he said if they follow their rules if they follow the first amendment
[3:42:14.400 --> 3:42:18.960]  they shouldn't be pursuing a prosecution because we have a long history going
[3:42:18.960 --> 3:42:22.160]  back decades we want to know when our government
[3:42:22.160 --> 3:42:25.360]  is involved in criminal action and that's what they've done for us but let's
[3:42:25.360 --> 3:42:27.840]  take a look at the other side of the first amendment of course we have this
[3:42:27.840 --> 3:42:31.120]  back and forth going on with anculture whether she's going to be allowed to go
[3:42:31.120 --> 3:42:35.520]  to janet napolitano's berkeley you know janet napolitano she goes from being
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:39.200]  big sis to a big brother i guess at berkeley but
[3:42:39.200 --> 3:42:43.920]  nevertheless um howard dean says uh and talking about that hate speech is not
[3:42:43.920 --> 3:42:47.520]  protected by the first amendment and then of course uh who declares what is
[3:42:47.520 --> 3:42:51.360]  hate who declares what is truth who declares what is
[3:42:51.360 --> 3:42:54.160]  controversial and of course we've seen all of this being
[3:42:54.160 --> 3:42:59.280]  brought up by google by facebook by the democrats saying um
[3:42:59.280 --> 3:43:03.600]  even the fcc the fec so we're going to shut down anything we think is hateful
[3:43:03.600 --> 3:43:06.320]  and we will be the judges of whether it's hateful we're going to shut down
[3:43:06.320 --> 3:43:09.520]  anything that we think is not truthful and we will be the judges of whether
[3:43:09.520 --> 3:43:13.680]  or not it's truthful and then even to the point that youtube is saying
[3:43:13.680 --> 3:43:18.320]  if we think your videos are controversial we'll kill the monetization of it
[3:43:18.320 --> 3:43:22.000]  doesn't even have to be something that's hateful or false in their estimate
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:24.160]  they don't even have to defend that they just have to say well we think it's
[3:43:24.160 --> 3:43:27.760]  a little bit controversial maybe it's talking about religion so we'll shut
[3:43:27.760 --> 3:43:31.360]  that down and so this is where it goes folks and
[3:43:31.360 --> 3:43:35.200]  here's a good example uh from the week and this was uh on drudge
[3:43:35.200 --> 3:43:39.280]  report today talking about how google operates as monopoly and it was an
[3:43:39.280 --> 3:43:42.080]  interesting example because they had this website called
[3:43:42.080 --> 3:43:46.240]  celebrity net worth they had a guy that founded this back in 2008 so
[3:43:46.240 --> 3:43:49.280]  nine years ago uh he was kind of curious about how
[3:43:49.280 --> 3:43:52.880]  much larry david uh had a net worth of of course he's a guy who was
[3:43:52.880 --> 3:43:56.560]  involved in sign film and the other thing so uh he couldn't find any good
[3:43:56.560 --> 3:43:59.040]  date on it so he thought well maybe other people are interested in it so he
[3:43:59.040 --> 3:44:02.880]  started up a small media business he eventually had a staff of 12 people
[3:44:02.880 --> 3:44:06.560]  to conduct detailed investigations then google came up with the idea that they
[3:44:06.560 --> 3:44:10.640]  would do something themselves called featured snippets which would give you
[3:44:10.640 --> 3:44:14.160]  the answers to search queries at the top of the search page well that was his
[3:44:14.160 --> 3:44:16.880]  business and so they came to him and they said
[3:44:16.880 --> 3:44:20.320]  well you know we want to do some stuff on celebrity net worth so
[3:44:20.320 --> 3:44:24.560]  we'd like to use your information he said no that's my business and i spend a
[3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:27.920]  lot of money creating that content and i'm not just
[3:44:27.920 --> 3:44:32.080]  going to give it to you for free so he declined
[3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:35.200]  and then they did it anyway they scraped the site
[3:44:35.200 --> 3:44:38.800]  they took the information off and he said the interesting thing was is about a
[3:44:38.800 --> 3:44:45.760]  year ago february 2016 he had um put in some fake listings for
[3:44:45.760 --> 3:44:49.040]  friends who are not celebrities to see if they would pop up in google's
[3:44:49.040 --> 3:44:53.600]  featured answers and they did so they're going in
[3:44:53.600 --> 3:44:56.480]  they don't vet the information they don't do the work
[3:44:56.480 --> 3:45:00.960]  they don't create the original content they steal it and they monetize it
[3:45:00.960 --> 3:45:03.840]  but the other part of this is that they're not just taking over somebody's
[3:45:03.840 --> 3:45:06.640]  business they're not just taking over and shutting
[3:45:06.640 --> 3:45:10.160]  down the people who are actual content creators who actually do the research
[3:45:10.160 --> 3:45:14.880]  who put the stuff together instead what they're doing is they're creating
[3:45:14.880 --> 3:45:18.240]  their own narrative their own news see that's the way that they can do this is
[3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:20.800]  where we really need to be concerned that's another level of it
[3:45:20.800 --> 3:45:24.880]  yes they create a monopoly but they also just like facebook and twitter they
[3:45:24.880 --> 3:45:29.760]  also want to control content in a way that is politicized
[3:45:29.760 --> 3:45:32.800]  and so it isn't simply that they're doing this for the money yes they're doing it
[3:45:32.800 --> 3:45:36.320]  for the money and they get a lot of sweetheart deals
[3:45:36.320 --> 3:45:40.240]  and crony capitalism involved with the government when they help the government
[3:45:40.240 --> 3:45:43.600]  with their narratives when they push this through
[3:45:43.600 --> 3:45:46.400]  and as they point out and this is something where I should start looking
[3:45:46.400 --> 3:45:49.600]  at and try to help some of their competitors they point out that in
[3:45:49.600 --> 3:45:53.520]  this article that duck duck go is a superior tool when looking for less
[3:45:53.520 --> 3:45:56.560]  immediate material they said 80% of the online search traffic there
[3:45:56.560 --> 3:45:59.520]  is first mover advantage in other words they're looking for the people
[3:45:59.520 --> 3:46:02.960]  who are creating the content trying to reward the people who create the
[3:46:02.960 --> 3:46:06.240]  content instead of the people who just steal it
[3:46:06.240 --> 3:46:09.920]  and then monetize their theft which is what's going on another example of this
[3:46:09.920 --> 3:46:13.520]  the museum this is a story from a couple of days ago
[3:46:13.520 --> 3:46:17.120]  from the free beacon and if you don't know the museum
[3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:24.720]  is a museum of news in washington dc and they're oh so special about their worship
[3:46:24.720 --> 3:46:28.480]  of the first amendment they have a great big marble plaque of the first amendment
[3:46:28.480 --> 3:46:31.120]  when you walk in the place and they want to tell you about
[3:46:31.120 --> 3:46:34.240]  news and how important news is and it's the fourth
[3:46:34.240 --> 3:46:38.560]  estate and so forth and so on and they just gave a free speech award to
[3:46:38.560 --> 3:46:44.720]  apple's ceo tem cook and this is a guy you know like facebook who has bowed down
[3:46:44.720 --> 3:46:48.960]  to every demand for censorship that is given to him except when it is in
[3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:52.800]  america okay i said it was only a few months ago that apple
[3:46:52.800 --> 3:46:57.280]  removed the new york times app from the chinese version of the app store
[3:46:57.280 --> 3:47:00.480]  so they took out the new york times because the chinese didn't like the
[3:47:00.480 --> 3:47:04.560]  new york times you think the chinese government wants the info wars
[3:47:04.560 --> 3:47:09.440]  on the on the app store do you think they want uh
[3:47:09.440 --> 3:47:12.720]  do you think that apple wants any of our news articles
[3:47:12.720 --> 3:47:17.040]  on apple news no they want to try to curate the news for you they want to
[3:47:17.040 --> 3:47:21.200]  try to take control the news for you and as they point out in this free beacon
[3:47:21.200 --> 3:47:24.720]  story they say the move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for
[3:47:24.720 --> 3:47:28.320]  readers of mainland china to read the new york times without resorting to
[3:47:28.320 --> 3:47:31.680]  special software and this wasn't the first time that apple had
[3:47:31.680 --> 3:47:35.440]  accommodated the communist dictatorship and its quest to deny apple has
[3:47:35.440 --> 3:47:39.920]  previously removed other less prominent media apps from its china store
[3:47:39.920 --> 3:47:43.840]  the times ask apple what was going on and they said well we're merely complying
[3:47:43.840 --> 3:47:47.040]  with the request to chinese authorities they said well it's funny but a year
[3:47:47.040 --> 3:47:50.720]  earlier he self-righteously refused to comply with the
[3:47:50.720 --> 3:47:53.920]  fbi request unlike an iphone for an investigation of the san
[3:47:53.920 --> 3:47:56.800]  bernadino shooting terrorist and understand that was nothing
[3:47:56.800 --> 3:48:00.880]  but virtue signaling they're giving this information to
[3:48:00.880 --> 3:48:06.480]  the government when they want it uh and uh when this whole debate was going on
[3:48:06.480 --> 3:48:12.240]  as i talked to john mackaffey interviewing him he said uh we said you
[3:48:12.240 --> 3:48:16.960]  can't give tools over to the fbi as the fbi was demanding anyway
[3:48:16.960 --> 3:48:20.880]  because the fbi isn't going to be able to keep track of them they're going to
[3:48:20.880 --> 3:48:23.760]  lose them they're going to go into the public domain
[3:48:23.760 --> 3:48:28.320]  and that was uh right a couple of months uh several months before we saw
[3:48:28.320 --> 3:48:31.760]  vault seven which showed that the cia's hacking tools
[3:48:31.760 --> 3:48:36.080]  got out into the public domain so john mackaffey was exactly right they're
[3:48:36.080 --> 3:48:40.400]  not going to protect your privacy uh they're not going to
[3:48:40.400 --> 3:48:44.080]  keep control of these tools we don't want to let them have those tools
[3:48:44.080 --> 3:48:47.120]  and they say you know what connection does tim cook have to the cause of the
[3:48:47.120 --> 3:48:50.320]  free press other than suppressing it for profit
[3:48:50.320 --> 3:48:54.000]  and then they pointed out at the very bottom of the article so why would
[3:48:54.000 --> 3:48:58.160]  they give pimp cook apple computer removing even the new york times if the
[3:48:58.160 --> 3:49:02.720]  chinese government demands it why would they give him an honor like this
[3:49:02.720 --> 3:49:06.640]  and as he said uh well somebody who is a commenter on this story
[3:49:06.640 --> 3:49:12.640]  said that apple is a platinum sponsor of the new york's free expression awards
[3:49:12.640 --> 3:49:18.800]  how's that for irony and hypocrisy and as he says mystery solved exactly
[3:49:18.800 --> 3:49:22.960]  because that's what we just saw with uh gm how they're going to make sure that
[3:49:22.960 --> 3:49:27.040]  they don't have somebody at the national highway uh traffic and safety
[3:49:27.040 --> 3:49:30.240]  administration shut down their crazy scheme to just have the
[3:49:30.240 --> 3:49:33.440]  car uh shut down in the middle of the road
[3:49:33.440 --> 3:49:37.680]  i want to move over to uh what's going on as i said uh paul covered the politics
[3:49:37.680 --> 3:49:41.040]  on the french side of this but we need to take a look at what's going on
[3:49:41.040 --> 3:49:46.640]  worldwide with terrorism with islam there's a story by w&d
[3:49:46.640 --> 3:49:50.960]  about how muslims want to have blasphemers prosecuted worldwide and
[3:49:50.960 --> 3:49:54.800]  they're using the united nations to try to push for censorship laws this is
[3:49:54.800 --> 3:49:58.240]  we're talking about uh google and china censoring people and
[3:49:58.240 --> 3:50:02.320]  of course we have uh china now taking control of hollywood
[3:50:02.320 --> 3:50:05.040]  because they want to control that part of the narrative as well
[3:50:05.040 --> 3:50:09.200]  they say that on w&d they say uh for years islamic nations have successfully
[3:50:09.200 --> 3:50:12.160]  pressed the un to pass non-binding resolutions
[3:50:12.160 --> 3:50:15.600]  that would condemn the defamation of religion but what they really want in
[3:50:15.600 --> 3:50:21.360]  countries like pakistan is to have criminal penalties for blasphemy they
[3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:25.200]  had pakistan's interior ministry his last name is khan like
[3:50:25.200 --> 3:50:28.960]  uh the the guy that hillary clinton had who is a big
[3:50:28.960 --> 3:50:34.560]  advocate of sharia law they had him talk about what he was going to do they
[3:50:34.560 --> 3:50:38.560]  want to expedite anyone who is overseas and accused of islamic
[3:50:38.560 --> 3:50:41.600]  blasphemy so they want all the social media
[3:50:41.600 --> 3:50:45.280]  and the search engines to help them to find anybody that is even criticizing
[3:50:45.280 --> 3:50:47.840]  islam and then extradite them well of course that
[3:50:47.840 --> 3:50:51.760]  doesn't going to happen in the u.s and the uk but of course it will happen if
[3:50:51.760 --> 3:50:55.440]  you travel to some of the 25 30 muslim countries they might
[3:50:55.440 --> 3:50:59.120]  arrest you and extradite you to pakistan stay with us we'll be right back

[3:52:14.160 --> 3:52:18.160]  and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they
[3:52:18.160 --> 3:52:21.920]  took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the

[3:54:17.360 --> 3:54:20.160]  abroad of course we had this article from michael snider
[3:54:20.160 --> 3:54:24.320]  a day or so ago islamic terrorists will be specifically targeting christians
[3:54:24.320 --> 3:54:29.200]  and churches in america he wrote that before we saw the specific targeting of
[3:54:29.200 --> 3:54:32.240]  police and paris but of course we know they're
[3:54:32.240 --> 3:54:35.440]  going to do that we've had terrorist target churches
[3:54:35.440 --> 3:54:39.120]  in the past they targeted them in south africa i had a very interesting
[3:54:39.120 --> 3:54:44.480]  interview with charle funvic who was in south africa at the time they had the
[3:54:44.480 --> 3:54:46.720]  communist terrorists there were trying to take over that country they
[3:54:46.720 --> 3:54:50.640]  specifically targeted a white liberal church because they knew nobody there
[3:54:50.640 --> 3:54:53.280]  would be armed they didn't know that this guy
[3:54:53.280 --> 3:54:57.120]  was going to be visiting the church he had a gun
[3:54:57.120 --> 3:55:00.880]  only had five bullets these guys came in throwing hand grenades
[3:55:00.880 --> 3:55:05.760]  spraying the church with automatic machine gun fire
[3:55:05.760 --> 3:55:09.520]  he was able to save a thousand people there this this is a video and it's only
[3:55:09.520 --> 3:55:13.360]  at about 23 000 views and it's a year too old

[3:55:33.440 --> 3:55:37.360]  snider sniders article here the point he was making about something
[3:55:37.360 --> 3:55:41.760]  that had just happened in south dakota not even going back to this story from
[3:55:41.760 --> 3:55:44.960]  south africa from charle funvic uh but before we do i'll just
