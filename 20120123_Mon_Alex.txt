[08:55.280 --> 09:02.720]  and he said uh no you're not going to grope me i just want to be wanded it's normal to not want
[09:02.720 --> 09:07.920]  to be touched i mean it you know in the old days people being inducted into prison if that was the
[09:07.920 --> 09:14.640]  upsetting thing was being groped having someone touch your genitals but but now it's a sacrament
[09:14.640 --> 09:22.720]  of land of the coward home of the sleigh and now uh in the same state funny epicenter tennessee
[09:22.720 --> 09:30.160]  but also in illinois and uh texas it's going on in dalas and also all over florida you pull up to a
[09:30.160 --> 09:38.000]  checkpoint and their state police u.s army sometimes more than 15 agencies run by tsa they're the little
[09:38.000 --> 09:48.000]  bosses and the families are jerked out of the cars and the groping begins it's on the news you can
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.560]  pull up uh just just tsa checkpoints lord and you'll actually see small children with with potbellied
[09:54.560 --> 10:01.680]  men rubbing all over their bodies i mean imagine you pull up to a hardcore not see criminal checkpoint
[10:01.680 --> 10:05.680]  that has nothing to do with keeping you safe it's all about breaking your will and they're going
[10:05.680 --> 10:08.880]  to touch your wife they're going to touch your children and you know what people are just going
[10:08.880 --> 10:14.240]  to start standing up to it and that's what they want they want to get a fight going with the
[10:14.240 --> 10:20.960]  american people so that all the criminals and scum that run the federal government can get a real
[10:20.960 --> 10:27.200]  war going and have the local cops march out to do their dirty work the equivalent of jumping in
[10:27.200 --> 10:33.360]  front of an 18-wheeler that's going 100 miles an hour i mean i saw the associated press roiders
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.080]  all of it friday i covered it yesterday on the nightly news uh on the sunday radio show
[10:38.080 --> 10:45.920]  oh the top federal prosecutors that plead the fifth on fast and furious they're all caught
[10:45.920 --> 10:51.440]  lying shipping the guns into mexico shipping the drugs back in it's all you know all the federal
[10:51.440 --> 11:00.160]  documents they've declared national security it's a drug dealing group of criminals criminals
[11:00.160 --> 11:06.160]  ruthless tyrants and they're staging the terror attacks and they're listing the american people
[11:06.160 --> 11:09.840]  as the terrorists and they're saying they'll secretly arrest us and that was disappearing to
[11:09.840 --> 11:21.680]  black holes and it's totally illegitimate and evil and now a u.s senator who's all over national
[11:21.680 --> 11:31.600]  television and and they know who he is we're gonna grab your private parts pal now the pilots they
[11:31.600 --> 11:36.800]  said a year and a half ago they said you know what we're just gonna boycott and stop flying and and
[11:36.800 --> 11:42.800]  again it was in the news a lot of these guys were veterans air force veterans you name it
[11:44.160 --> 11:50.240]  tough guys some of them are vietnam veterans they would get physically ill or they would get angry
[11:50.240 --> 11:57.120]  or they would actually go in the bathroom and vomit and be so upset that they could not fly
[11:57.120 --> 12:02.000]  and so they said okay we'll have a separate screening for the pilots and the people because
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  if you're going to be trusted to fly the plane obviously we don't need to grab your your your
[12:06.000 --> 12:17.520]  crotch now why would full grown men vomit well let me tell you something i in
[12:20.400 --> 12:25.040]  flying out of las vegas last year you know three or four months ago after being out there to do
[12:25.040 --> 12:31.440]  interviews with jesse ventura uh and uh because we were inspecting a private rocket base and some
[12:31.440 --> 12:35.280]  other stuff that's out there private space program that's where we're in vegas that's one of the
[12:35.280 --> 12:42.640]  reasons we were out there and flying back out i refused the body scanner but it was about nine
[12:42.640 --> 12:46.640]  a.m i was really tired i hadn't had any sleep and i said i'll just see what this is like i told the
[12:46.640 --> 12:51.200]  guys to don't don't touch my genitals or i will sue you he was i know who you are alex jones
[12:51.200 --> 12:57.600]  i listened to your show and while the guy was doing it he was enjoying the domination
[13:00.880 --> 13:04.720]  it was ridiculous i was wearing a tight t-shirt
[13:06.800 --> 13:13.200]  and tight jeans and you could see every part of my body and he was rubbing on my chest
[13:13.760 --> 13:18.560]  and going just going to check here i'm going to check down here i'm going to go right into
[13:18.560 --> 13:25.120]  your waistband and if i hadn't been out till you know three a.m with uh
[13:26.640 --> 13:33.520]  sean stone oliver stone son and uh ventura son tyrell and uh didn't have one hell of a headache
[13:34.560 --> 13:38.400]  you know i rationalized it as well i'll just kind of go through this prisoner of war
[13:38.400 --> 13:43.760]  prisoner induction thing and i'll just sue him if he you know goes down there to the to the family
[13:43.760 --> 13:56.000]  jewels but um but the point is this is all about total domination
[13:59.680 --> 14:05.280]  okay yeah we're in touch we just yeah obviously okay well we've just gotten uh information from
[14:05.280 --> 14:10.640]  ran paul's office this is breaking i know curtsman working from home lately until about noon we
[14:10.640 --> 14:17.280]  you get curtain here right now obviously won't give the source in paul's office but this is breaking
[14:17.280 --> 14:21.840]  and the drudge reports obviously going to want this so uh yeah i just got it right as you told me
[14:21.840 --> 14:28.240]  in my ear i got it right here no i got it just just just just give this to kurt with an update
[14:30.080 --> 14:37.280]  that this is from a ran paul office source we'll just leave it at that uh ran paul's sources tell us
[14:37.280 --> 14:43.680]  there was an anomaly or a blip in the scanner reading which i see with most people again it's
[14:43.680 --> 14:48.880]  all about more and more groping and ran was called aside for a second screening he offered to rescan
[14:48.880 --> 14:53.680]  but was only given the option of a pat down he refused the pat down and was taken aside and
[14:53.680 --> 14:57.680]  detained this is directly from somebody in his office i'm not going to give the source he has
[14:57.680 --> 15:04.080]  recently uh been released and he is currently on a plane to dc we are in contact with his staff
[15:04.080 --> 15:09.600]  and should be speaking to him soon i don't know if that's going to be on air but this is just
[15:10.320 --> 15:14.880]  what we wrote from a senior staffer what was written on the phone conversation
[15:15.520 --> 15:18.800]  and i will talk to that staffer during the break here when we go to the break in a moment
[15:19.760 --> 15:27.200]  the point is this is all about completely breaking your will and it's about the two
[15:27.200 --> 15:33.120]  plus million people on a no fly list no criminal record no judge no jury you can't find out why
[15:33.120 --> 15:40.720]  you're on a list it's just you don't fly now you don't drive the tsa has set on c span
[15:41.600 --> 15:45.360]  going back almost 10 years ago that they would have highway checkpoints that you'd have to get
[15:45.360 --> 15:49.600]  their approval to have a job you'll have a federal card now they've had the unions opt
[15:49.600 --> 15:56.080]  into that and make union members do it all over the u.s major unions you have to get tsa approval
[15:56.080 --> 16:03.920]  for a job the tsa is going to be the new total federal bureaucrat class that commands your
[16:03.920 --> 16:10.080]  local police against you and who will do anything they're told and see you as an absolute enemy
[16:10.080 --> 16:14.080]  and they're going to stick their hands down your five-year-olds pants in front of you and
[16:14.080 --> 16:19.920]  smile they're going to grab your wife's breast and smile they're going to take your baby's diaper

[16:25.520 --> 16:31.360]  income taxes and the irs with its own fake court stealing people's property and the rich are exempt
[16:31.360 --> 16:35.840]  and you know are offshore but only the elite are allowed to be offshore and pay almost zero tax
[16:36.480 --> 16:42.640]  you are going to be absolutely dominated with forced inoculations government american medical

[24:58.480 --> 25:04.720]  get groped and harassed it doesn't matter it's about the banking class that has hijacked this
[25:04.720 --> 25:11.440]  nation and controls the security forces having total control over society remember a couple
[25:11.440 --> 25:21.120]  years ago there was a backfire in the parking garage of the capital building in dc and they
[25:21.120 --> 25:26.640]  ordered all the house and senate members to leave and some of the senators weren't walking fast
[25:26.640 --> 25:32.720]  enough and were actually thrown down on the ground and grabbed on by the security forces and their
[25:32.720 --> 25:40.960]  black uniforms with mp5 submachine guns always that's the threat in society in rom 2000 years ago
[25:41.680 --> 25:52.160]  in venezuela today in nigeria africa in the united states there it is right there and the type of
[25:52.160 --> 25:59.200]  people they're hiring for those positions now just a bunch of wanton thugs who sit around fantasizing
[25:59.200 --> 26:07.360]  watching all these cop shows with a torture and kill people and are always right the government
[26:07.360 --> 26:14.560]  is paid off with 500 billion dollars of drug money a tiny amount of that is used to buy them
[26:16.240 --> 26:21.920]  the majority's laundered through large globalist banks and it's all public and no one gets in
[26:21.920 --> 26:26.080]  trouble and you tell cops that the government deals the drugs they go well everybody knows that but
[26:26.080 --> 26:29.760]  still i'm just doing my job doing your job keeping the prices up with the drugs train
[26:29.760 --> 26:36.880]  everybody to be a good slave your phony drug war keep prices up your phony drug war to pack the
[26:36.880 --> 26:41.280]  four plus million people in private prisons working for 25 cents an hour driving down everybody
[26:41.280 --> 26:49.200]  else's wages if i see one more good old boy on unemployment you know when i think it's good
[26:49.200 --> 26:54.800]  they're putting prisoners in jail for nonviolent drug offenses and they ought to make them work
[26:54.800 --> 26:58.640]  they got hot tubs and cable tv no they don't
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.240]  last time i checked prisons in texas to fade are phasing out air conditioning
[27:06.240 --> 27:11.920]  oh that's a really good idea in the summer when it's 115 degrees inside without air conditioning
[27:15.360 --> 27:20.720]  you like four million people in prison at any one time working to drive down your wages and take
[27:20.720 --> 27:28.160]  your job are you stupid and see my problem is
[27:31.200 --> 27:34.480]  i get in here and i read this news and i look at it and i get so
[27:35.200 --> 27:40.240]  angry because i know it's just going to get worse and worse you know folks i told you
[27:41.360 --> 27:46.240]  more than 13 years ago that the big mega banks and i listed the six mega banks would implode the
[27:46.240 --> 27:53.200]  world economy within the next 15 years through derivatives and would announce a bank of the
[27:53.200 --> 27:59.600]  world as the solution that we would pay carbon taxes to exactly that's now happened i told you
[27:59.600 --> 28:05.520]  they start making announcements about government developing weaponized airborne flues mouse pox
[28:05.520 --> 28:12.800]  abola just so they can plausibly deny involvement when it gets released and claim it was an accident
[28:12.800 --> 28:17.440]  they're now making the announcements about all these airborne weapons they're so concerned
[28:17.440 --> 28:22.480]  about which means they're edging towards using them i told you they'd pass laws to secretly
[28:22.480 --> 28:28.000]  arrest citizens and disappear us ahead of staging massive domestic terror attacks you know i told
[28:28.000 --> 28:33.360]  you 9 11 was going to happen and they were going to blow up the world trade center trade centers
[28:33.360 --> 28:40.080]  and blaming on their asset bin laden and then on september 11th i said that undoubtedly in the next
[28:40.080 --> 28:47.200]  month you're going to see a bio attack in the us but a small one just to prep that fear for the future
[28:47.200 --> 28:55.440]  now how did i know that a lot of data goes into it i'll just i'll just leave it at that
[28:56.800 --> 29:00.480]  there's a lot of famous criminology cases where detectives have been tracking a serial killer
[29:00.480 --> 29:05.920]  for a decade eating sleeping drinking it and they end up staking out certain spots on maps
[29:05.920 --> 29:10.800]  they've created and dead reckoning actually end up being there when the serial killer dumps another
[29:10.800 --> 29:17.280]  body i don't know how to it's it's it's all the data it's all the research but i know what they're
[29:17.280 --> 29:24.640]  going to do and i guess in a sick way that's kind of the good part about it because if we don't turn
[29:24.640 --> 29:31.280]  this around all of you that have served the system are going to be killed by it and no i'm not talking
[29:31.280 --> 29:36.400]  about world war three that could kick off with iran i'll have the latest on that we get back but
[29:37.040 --> 29:43.280]  gran paul you know he didn't want somebody grabbing his genitals so he's evil i mean i guess the new
[29:43.280 --> 29:47.600]  american flag should be a man having his genitals grabbed i'm sorry but that's what america is now
[29:47.600 --> 30:00.480]  and the perverts we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[30:18.240 --> 30:24.400]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[30:24.400 --> 30:30.800]  to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[33:51.440 --> 34:00.320]  that press releases on it their parks and facilities in disney usa are live time laboratories
[34:01.680 --> 34:08.720]  tracking human behavior and are the model of the future smart cities where everywhere you go

[34:27.440 --> 34:34.480]  states but see you pay to get in it's so special to get queued up in the big herd lines and so
[34:34.480 --> 34:40.000]  that's why disney world is the beta testing ground for the latest on fema camp behavioral
[34:40.000 --> 34:47.120]  psychology and mass controlling of populations and people pay to go be part of it
[34:50.640 --> 34:54.400]  i told the story on the radio last night i was over my parents yesterday afternoon and
[34:54.400 --> 34:59.200]  i was talking about disney world and i said well you know the whole thing's a laboratory i said
[34:59.200 --> 35:04.720]  the shopping malls are now mall of america's hooked in with department of defense that's now
[35:04.720 --> 35:10.080]  been confirmed we had sources months ago telling us about it and i said all of these wars everything
[35:10.080 --> 35:15.680]  is a laboratory they called a laboratory uh they call iraq and afghanistan laboratories they call the
[35:15.680 --> 35:21.280]  united states a laboratory everything is a laboratory by the scientific technocratic elite
[35:21.280 --> 35:27.120]  to slowly test engage and develop systems that's what they call the scientific dictatorship
[35:29.120 --> 35:32.800]  and i just said watch this i said i'm going to use my little new world order
[35:32.800 --> 35:34.800]  data tracker phone
[35:38.880 --> 35:43.600]  and i'm going to type into the nsa search engine that's actually there to track what
[35:43.600 --> 35:49.200]  i'm thinking about what i'm looking into see you think it's just one way you're just getting
[35:49.200 --> 35:52.800]  info from google and it's showing you some advertising no that's only one small part
[35:52.800 --> 35:58.240]  of it but i said watch this i'm going to type in disney world department of defense disney
[35:58.240 --> 36:04.000]  world laboratory and it was just white papers documents press releases hundreds of them
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.800]  and i'd never even seen that information i just knew it would be because it's all department of
[36:08.800 --> 36:15.280]  defense eisenhower said we have a technological ruling elite that's taken over and they control
[36:15.280 --> 36:21.280]  the military industrial complex now the media will never play i've played it the full speech where he
[36:21.280 --> 36:26.640]  says a technocratic elite is now in control of 90 percent of all research at universities
[36:26.640 --> 36:30.480]  we are in a scientific dictatorship he basically goes on to warn everybody
[36:33.280 --> 36:37.840]  and somebody drops a book or something you hear a slam in the background he acts totally scared
[36:37.840 --> 36:42.160]  like you think somebody's about to kill him and he definitely went off script for that
[36:42.160 --> 36:47.600]  that was admitted they had cue cards for him and he went off script in his farewell address
[36:47.600 --> 36:53.040]  because he had somewhat of of a conscience we now know the joint chiefs of staff had just
[36:53.040 --> 36:57.360]  approached him to stage terror attacks in the u.s start war with the soviets he said no
[36:58.000 --> 37:03.360]  that they'd recently come to him with a eugenics plan uh about the sodium fluoride in the water
[37:03.360 --> 37:08.720]  and and and uh to reduce population he discovered the cancer viruses and the vaccines
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.160]  kennedy of course was later briefed on all this and kind of flipped out because back then you
[37:14.160 --> 37:19.840]  know they were from an older world they'd actually been in combat in world war one and world war two
[37:19.840 --> 37:24.880]  kennedy world war two eyes an hour tank commander highly decorated world war one i guess in the
[37:24.880 --> 37:32.080]  same unit as uh macarthur but side issue all of that happening and and and they're going it's a
[37:32.080 --> 37:36.720]  scientific dictatorship we're going to jack the food and the water and dumb them down and this is
[37:36.720 --> 37:46.240]  horrible but see that's what runs america now and it's like walking around with people in a trance
[37:46.240 --> 37:50.880]  and they physically are close to being in a trance and to see people going about their
[37:50.880 --> 37:56.240]  business like everything is normal and they have no idea that an artificial environment is being
[37:56.240 --> 38:07.840]  constructed and is being set up in our society now let me get into the news uh since we uh
[38:07.840 --> 38:12.880]  have started with the whole tsa thing let me finish up with it here's new york daily news

[39:32.640 --> 39:39.200]  you but it's for your safety again here they are denying it last week they were denying in a month
[39:39.200 --> 39:44.400]  before that but now this week tsa apologizes for strip searching two grandmothers at jfk
[39:45.040 --> 39:51.040]  wheelchair bound ruth sherman 89 was forced to show colostomy bag and they actually ask you what
[39:51.040 --> 39:54.880]  they are and a lot of times just pull them out of you like what is that that's a colostomy bag
[39:54.880 --> 40:00.560]  well what's a colostomy bag well my intestines are diverted into that and so that's where i
[40:00.560 --> 40:06.880]  defecate what's defecation literally that came out in the news and of course urology bags uh
[40:07.920 --> 40:12.640]  colostomy bags they just rip them off and then reportedly laugh at you and of course they had
[40:12.640 --> 40:18.640]  to settle a lawsuit in texas or was it midland where the woman was reportedly very attractive
[40:18.640 --> 40:23.440]  and they made her pull her shirt off and then uh three men got around her and asked her for dates
[40:24.720 --> 40:30.160]  while giggling profusely and of course this is what america is this is and americans will turn
[40:30.160 --> 40:35.120]  their daughters their sons their wives over to this because the average american likes it
[40:36.160 --> 40:41.920]  they like it and don't worry you're gonna get a lot more can you imagine once they fully bring
[40:41.920 --> 40:47.200]  this in and your son comes home and is a member of homeland security and his black uniform he's 25
[40:48.000 --> 40:54.000]  and starts interrogating his parents this happens in every authoritarian country and and and making
[40:54.000 --> 41:02.000]  sure that uh they're loyal and then if the parents argue with them about any issue politics life
[41:03.600 --> 41:08.960]  the 25 year old son looks at him and says i wonder if you're loyal and then gets off on the fear of

[41:54.000 --> 41:59.840]  isn't about the people being the boss no it's about the government being the boss and tipping your

[43:27.760 --> 43:32.080]  the drain and then goes super fast as it's going down the middle we've only gone about an inch
[43:32.080 --> 43:38.400]  from the rim we're not even that far down yet but as we go around it goes faster and faster and faster

[54:33.680 --> 54:41.600]  and my main job here is as this tyranny comes in and it's coming in that enough people have been
[54:41.600 --> 54:48.400]  warned about who did it who was behind it why they did it that then people will finally listen

[55:44.000 --> 55:48.560]  a one of my children to sleep and i just look in their eyes and their innocence and there's
[55:48.560 --> 55:53.920]  so much good in the world there's so much innocence in the world there's so many good
[55:53.920 --> 56:00.720]  things that we've got to protect and i'm angry i'm angry at men out there who are too weak-minded
[56:00.720 --> 56:07.520]  to face the facts because i know i'm right how much more has got to come true how much
[56:07.520 --> 56:10.640]  further down this road do we got to get before you wake up
[56:10.640 --> 56:20.480]  i got the iran news here we got a member of the european union parliament joining us coming up
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.160]  i want to play a clip though ran paul talking to pistole the head of the tsa
[56:27.440 --> 56:31.680]  about children being robbed and i've seen clips for pistole i haven't watched this whole clip yet
[56:32.400 --> 56:35.360]  they were just showing to me during the break where pistole denies they even do it even though
[56:35.360 --> 56:41.200]  there's thousands of videos of it i mean again they're just they're just scum they're enemies
[56:41.200 --> 56:47.040]  they hate you they hate america the globalists do hate america that's why they're totally
[56:47.040 --> 56:52.880]  destroying it and turning it into a joke a joke of absurdist police state here's ran paul
[56:53.760 --> 56:57.600]  we're all from bowling green that was on good morning america that many people saw and she was
[56:57.600 --> 57:03.680]  on there with the tsa agent doing an invasive search inside of her clothing inside of her pants
[57:03.680 --> 57:08.160]  we had an eight month old who's having their diaper inspected then we had a 95 year old who had
[57:08.160 --> 57:13.600]  their diaper taken off and inspected and stayed up i presume for hours waiting to get all about
[57:13.600 --> 57:20.560]  humiliation when the tsa head pistole was here he said well we need to do these invasive searches
[57:20.560 --> 57:25.280]  and he said well you may slow down or we may not do them as much but then he sent me a letter and
[57:25.280 --> 57:31.280]  said absolutely that we have to because an eight-year-old in kandahar exploded a bomb to me i think
[57:31.280 --> 57:36.400]  that shows a bit of naivete to think that somehow there's a similarity between an eight-year-old
[57:36.400 --> 57:41.520]  in kandahar and an eight-year-old in bowling green kentucky i mean the only similarities their age
[57:41.520 --> 57:50.080]  and i wouldn't consider that's enough to be a no they're not naive we're the terrorist al qaeda
[57:50.080 --> 57:56.560]  who's gotten on the airplanes and and and and given control of libya and syria they work for
[57:56.560 --> 58:05.200]  the new world order and i know rand knows that but this whole homeland security thing that good
[58:05.200 --> 58:08.640]  old boys think is for the muslims and all the rest of it you hate so much now it's for you
[58:09.920 --> 58:16.640]  and it's always been for you and you wait till they try to start this war with iran iran says if
[58:16.640 --> 58:22.000]  they cut off their oil supplied their oil sales they're gonna blot the straight of hormones well
[58:22.000 --> 58:28.640]  europe's voted to do it that is the bankers that have hijacked europe and so the next few weeks
[58:28.640 --> 58:33.840]  are gonna be interesting we have a very good chance a major war is going to break out which is
[58:33.840 --> 58:46.320]  exactly what the bankers want well they're on back stay with us this is gcn the genesis communications

[58:59.280 --> 59:03.840]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed
[59:03.840 --> 59:08.080]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[59:08.080 --> 59:13.280]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[59:13.280 --> 59:19.280]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[59:19.280 --> 59:23.600]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified
[59:23.600 --> 59:28.960]  in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them
[59:28.960 --> 59:34.720]  today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give them a call at eight

[59:48.400 --> 01:00:06.000]  survival seed bank dot com waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network big brother
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:15.040]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:28.640]  on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.840]  all right i blew a gasket in the last hour
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:43.120]  because i just think about the tsa groping all those children the forced inoculations
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:48.320]  starting up around the country i see the news tightening around our republic's throat i see
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:53.600]  the globalist gearing up for new giant wars and then i what really got me mad before i even
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:58.320]  went on there today was i kept reading all these articles where these billionaires and
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:05.360]  hundred millionaire people on average pay about three percent tax and that's if they try to bring
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:14.160]  money back in the us okay here's a london uh independent article and you know about google
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:21.920]  paying 2.4 tax general electric zero super rich romney admits paying only 15 in taxes
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:28.960]  folks somebody making 30 000 a year pays more than that one way or the other the feds i mean i pay
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:34.960]  35 percent and by the way i pay a lot more than that because they've gotten rid of all the exemptions
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:40.320]  and people say we'll stop paying them yeah we didn't have the income tax till 1913 yeah it wasn't
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:46.480]  adopted generally until 1951 i know all that i know you write the checks of the federal reserve
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.480]  i know it's a scam i understand that but i have to choose my battles
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.680]  but the point is they've gotten rid of all the exemptions what five six years ago
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.520]  they changed the law where cpa's are basically agents of the irs so you get audited constantly if
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:12.080]  you don't use a big establishment uh auditing firm cpa firm and then they don't give you all the
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:18.800]  exemptions and so you pay more like 45 percent so then you simply just try to make sure you spend
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:24.560]  all your money on the operation which is what we want to do anyways then your employees just all
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:30.320]  pay it or you know you you you you build a studio when you're building and the state of texas comes
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:34.880]  along one of the taxes rick perry got passed because he doubled the size of government folks found out
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:41.120]  about that twice dropped out of the race now when he was the heir apparent the globals thought they'd
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:47.920]  have and then they made him the leader out of the gates remember but uh he got this tax where
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.960]  they tax everything in your business it's like it's an income tax and then they got this hospital
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.560]  district property tax thing on top of it and everything in here every year i get charged for
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:06.480]  this this on-air light this uh they're building a giant bureaucracy of a little snot-nosed inspectors
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:14.320]  that want to force their way into your business um with no warrant and when they come around
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.920]  they're on real power trips all geared up and you're the enemy and you're supposed to lick

[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:28.640]  nuttle he's a european union member of parliament out of england and he's part of the uk independence
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.920]  party at 32 he got elected as ukip's youngest ever chairman and he is certainly doing a great
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.800]  job of their exposing the globalist and the socialist takeover through the eu dictatorship
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:47.600]  something the uk independence party lord mongton and others been exposing for a long time now it's
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:53.520]  admitted and the last head of the eu von rupee admitted they want a socialist world government
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:00.560]  but i wanted to play a clip from three and a half years ago of the uk independence party member
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:08.640]  of paul nuttle in the european parliament exposing the carbon tax fraud and of course years later it
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:14.000]  all comes out that they know it's a fraud internally with the whole climate gait situation but we'll
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.240]  also look at the eu move for sanctions on iran with him and we'll also look at some of the other
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:25.520]  big developments happening in the eu dictatorship right now let's go ahead and go to that clip
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:31.840]  mr president i recent well i've just heard a socialist colleague over there talking about
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.240]  greenland and you know the ice the ice melting in greenland well you know the question i'd like
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:42.000]  to ask on this subject is why is greenland called greenland is it perhaps because greenland was once
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.800]  green when the world was hotter well it seems that the british people are onto this because
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:51.200]  a recent opinion poll in the times newspaper clearly shows that the british people no longer
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:58.240]  believe in so-called man-made global warming the british people are very astute and they're clear
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:06.160]  that politicians have hijacked the environmentalist agenda it's been cynically used to raise taxes to
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:13.280]  exert control and now it's being used by the european union to justify your own existence this week
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:18.720]  we've also had the spectacle of one of the leading climate research centers in the uk which advises
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:25.200]  the government being caught altering data and stifling debate it's an absolute disgrace so i
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:30.000]  look forward to kopenhagen when the political class is sitting around the table awkwardly
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.960]  failing to mention the giant elephant in the room which is that the globe has not actually warmed
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:39.840]  all right past 10 years thank you now to paul nuttles so much to talk about in the 20 minutes
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:45.600]  we have or so uh with him but uh for those that don't understand you've got people that are elected
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.800]  to the parliament but the bureaucrats actually have all the power and now set what is it 80 plus
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.440]  percent of the laws in england without england ever even really being officially brought into the
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:04.560]  europe around 80 percent of our laws are now made not by the parliament not by people who are elected
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.080]  it's made by the european commission and now the european commissioners are a mile up the
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:12.400]  road from the european parliament and they sit in something called the bailamont building and these
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:18.400]  27 commissioners make these laws make these rules make these directives in secret they meet in secret
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:24.400]  and what's worth is this 4 000 working groups who sit around the commission and advise them
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:30.160]  on these regulations and we've asked before in the past what big business is involved here
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:34.000]  what lobbyist groups involved in these working groups the commission won't even tell us it's
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.400]  that secretive it's that out of control and finally the people of britain seem to be waking up to
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:45.680]  this and if you look at the opinion polls over the past couple of years people now are consistently
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:50.080]  agreeing with eukip's position and which is quite simply that britain will be better than our thousand
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:55.680]  governing our own affairs and even as you know but for listeners in the u.s. Cameron had said i won't
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.400]  let the people of the uk vote on you know getting out of the euro even though they never voted to
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:07.520]  get into it but now he's kind of backed off for now because of the huge awakening and said uh yeah
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:13.600]  no we're not going to basically vote to expand EU power over us i think they've a cabinet position
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.320]  on this has been at the street from day one when he was in opposition he gave us a cast-iron
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:22.880]  guarantee he wrote in the biggest selling newspaper in this country it's called the sun he wrote in
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.440]  that newspaper that he would give us a cast-iron guarantee that we would be given a vote on the
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:33.520]  lisbon treaty he then backtracked on that uh after the european elections after he promised
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.960]  his own voters people who went on voters naturals conservative in 2009 on the back of that promise
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:45.600]  he then reneged a couple of days later disgraceful stuff now he's come into power he sold us completely
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:51.440]  down the river you know a classic of four months ago uh there was a petition we have a system in
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:55.840]  this country now where if online there's a hundred thousand people sign a petition we can have a
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.000]  debate in parliament on an issue and there was a debate on whether we should have a referendum
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.720]  on our membership of the european union david cambran not only david cambran but nick clegg
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:11.600]  and ed milliband so the leaders of three biggest parties in this country three line with their
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:16.720]  own members to vote against a referendum these people are terrified at the views of the people
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:23.200]  and what's interesting is that the last referendum we had on the issue of europe was back in 1975
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:30.240]  so if you're under 54 you've never had a vote on this issue david cambran himself ed milliband
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:35.520]  and nick clegg are all under 54 and they've never had a vote on it and what we voted on in 75
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:41.520]  was trade we voted to join a european economic community what we've got now is the embryo
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.760]  i wouldn't even call it an mbr anymore we're being guided towards the political superspeed
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.880]  and when you look at von ruby and others they admit it's global governance it's unelected
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:59.120]  it's anti-family uh they want in europe i've seen in der spiegel where there won't be single
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:04.960]  parent homes allowed anymore uh they want to make everybody live in communes i mean this is a cult
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:11.760]  of sickos even the russians uh you know call it the new soviet yeah the russians do and what is
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.800]  interesting is that there are quite close comparisons between the soviet union and the european union
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.400]  if you look at the structure you've got a commission which meets in fiefden very much like a polyp
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:26.960]  bureau shall we say and then you've got a european parliament which is in effect uh a complete
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.600]  joe heavy that the whole thing is smoking mirrors it has no power whatsoever the real
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:37.120]  power lies with the people who meet in fiefden that very much mirrors uh the supreme soviet
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:42.880]  there are definite there is a definite likeness between the two and i suppose there is no
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.720]  there is no coincidence that a lot of the commissioners do tend to be ex-communist
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.280]  including the head of the commission the president of the commission jose manwell but also who's an
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:59.600]  ex-mallist and uh yes i mean it's all about not listening to the people and i never forget
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:04.640]  listening to peter mandelson who was a minister in the Blair government and then was sacked and
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:10.240]  went on to be a european commissioner i never forget him as trade commissioner talking about
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:16.800]  what we live in now is a post-democratic society what does that mean what does a post-democratic
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:22.080]  society mean it was frightening and then to hear a couple of months later jose manwell
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:28.160]  but also describe referendums as inconvenient when the dutch and when the french voted no
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:35.360]  to the uh to the european uh lispin treaty to then hear him say that the referendums were
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:41.520]  inconvenient was a disgrace and then he went on and described the EU as the first non-imperial
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:48.800]  empire the first non-imperial empire and expanding on that now uh i mean i read economist magazine
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.520]  every week when it comes out and of course it's a big establishment rag and almost every article
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:59.440]  is how we have technocrats now and it's good you can have elected people but they're not going to
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.320]  run anything the central bankers that created the derivatives and you're going to rate we're
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:09.040]  going to raise your taxes and have it paid to private groups and we're going to run everything
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:15.280]  in your life and it's good to have dictatorial groups running things they actually admit it
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:20.880]  but then separately for lower strata they have the mainstream media when when i talk about it
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:25.760]  or you talk about it or ron paul talks about it they call it a conspiracy theory when it's all
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:31.520]  admitted well this sort of ties in doesn't it to exactly what peter mandleton said when he spoke
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:37.680]  about the post-democratic society where in effect he believes and i'm sure others in the commission
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:41.440]  believe because this is the system that they're they're working in and making a lot of money out
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:47.120]  of it i hasten to add the system they believe works best is the one where you cut out the people
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:52.400]  where you ignore the people where you make the people of ireland vote twice on two occasions
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:57.600]  in referendums when the irish people said no to the nice treaty they were made to vote again when
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:02.800]  the irish people said no to the lisbon treaty they were made to vote again it's all about
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:09.040]  taking no notice of the people and the e-year juggernaut will march on even to the point now
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:15.840]  where crewysia through a very dodgy referendum over the weekend i hasten to add has now voted to
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:22.960]  join the european union um it will expand further east it will expand and it will expand and it will
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:28.000]  expand and i remember about 10 years ago romano prozzi the former head of the commission talking
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.760]  about one day he looks forward to countries like tunisia and morocco also joining the european union
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:39.840]  even though they're not actually in europe this whole thing is expansionist imperialist and quite
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:46.560]  frankly the sooner we the better off well it'll be better for everybody well it's certainly will
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:52.000]  let's look at this iran situation i mean this is not even really big news here in the us iran
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.440]  deval's the shutdown straight of or moose as e u passes oil embargo and the united states in nato
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.520]  have said they're going to attack iran if they block the straight of or moose but it is an active
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.960]  war to cut off their oil sales uh again i'm not a fan of the mulas but i mean i don't think a lot
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:13.200]  people realize this is a huge escalation why would the euro crats want to do this because a war
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:19.200]  is a good political distraction from their power grabbing i'm not sure about that i'm not even sure
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.920]  they realized the the brevity of the situation that they've got themselves into i mean let me just
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:30.560]  explain all all new contracts include oil and petroleum will now be banned uh within the e u
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:37.120]  from iran and also all existing contracts will be cancelled in july on top of that the iranian
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:42.800]  central bank could have its assets frozen in the european union and of course we've got the problem
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:49.920]  in the streets of or moose where six battleships or six warships from america france and britain
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:54.320]  sailed through there over the weekend in a show of strength a show of power it was a warning
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:59.440]  to the mulas that uh we won't stand for this and i think we are thinking on the brink of something
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.720]  very very frightening indeed because as a response the iranians could well attempt to shut that
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.640]  streets and then you could see the first the first gunfire and the conflict
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:17.680]  now i mean you're again if you're just joining us you're a member of the european union parliament
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:23.280]  hailing out of the uk paul nuttle is our guest member of the uk independence party
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:31.600]  uh and he's the youngest chairman ever of that party which is the fastest growing now in the
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:35.760]  uk as folks begin to wake up there as they're waking up here if you're a new listener or
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:41.840]  aren't familiar with uk politics it's basically a ron paul style you know national sovereignty
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:48.080]  constitutional libertarian conservative you know just common sense they're not globalist marxist
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:56.240]  leninist new world order banker minions basically uh looking at this and looking forward uh when can
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:03.040]  we expect to see iran respond to this uh what's the time frame on these contracts well the time
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:09.440]  frame on the contract is that it's immediate the embargo is is immediate and as i say existing
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:17.600]  contracts will be uh will be cut off in july and i expect to see iran um respond pretty quickly and
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:21.920]  i think as i said a minute ago i think we are we are thinking on the brink of something scary but
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:27.040]  you know the european union i mean it was the foreign ministers of the nation's day to have
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.480]  agreed this alongside ambassadors so taking that aside the european union is encroaching
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:37.440]  international sovereignty in the area of foreign policy because we now have the high representative
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:42.800]  of course bareness ashton who's never been elected to anything in her life she's a political
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:51.040]  employee of the european union it's also now beginning to put in place embassies right across
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:57.520]  the globe which in effect are going to supersede the embassies of the nation's state it is a complete
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:03.760]  and uttered a front to democracy and it's also a complete and utter a front to national sovereignty
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:12.000]  it certainly is now now now you talk about the awakening i give us some indicators of that that
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.840]  you're seeing in england uh in the rest of the uk are you starting to see an awakening in europe
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:24.640]  uh to the euro's tyranny uh with the uh bureaucrats installing their own people
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.440]  over these countries that they're sucking dry right now well you've seen it happen twice now
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:35.840]  over the past three months you've seen uh bellistoni removed in italy and you've got your own
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:42.720]  crat now who's not been elected placed as prime minister uh you've also seen the same in greece
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:47.920]  where papandreou was forced aside now we have another euro crat again who hasn't been elected
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.320]  who's been put in his place so they really are showing their teeth here they're really showing
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:56.800]  their true selves the awakening which is going on is happening right across the board the people
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:04.080]  are out on streets burning pu flags in lisbon in athens enrol there is a real movement out there
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:11.280]  against the european union and what you're seeing in northern europe is a uh is a revolution really
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:15.760]  in the polls what you're seeing in finland for example with the true finj you're seeing it in
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:22.320]  holland with health builders uh frighteningly enough um you're seeing it now beginning in
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:27.600]  france if you look at the opinion polls in france we're front national are leaving in the polls out
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:33.040]  there and it looks like marina le pen could certainly get into the second round of the of the uh the
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:39.040]  french presidency elections actually this year there is a movement that is an anti-eu movement
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:44.080]  right across northern europe and what we're seeing here in the uk is a growth of ukip not only in
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:49.520]  members but also in the opinion polls and at the moment ukip is almost neck and neck with the liberal
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:56.800]  democrats who are actually in government so ukip seems to have grown from two to three percent to
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:02.160]  around eight to eleven percent in the opinion polls and as i say what we need to do is we need to
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:07.760]  keep this momentum up and we need to ensure that the opinion poll ratings that we've got at the
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:16.080]  moment then transcend into votes at local elections and the big one for us is 2014 where we believe
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:21.200]  we genuinely think we can go on and cause a political earthquake in this country and win
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:26.640]  those european elections now expanding on this and if you just join us we have a european union
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:32.240]  member of parliament paul nuttle on with us from the uk independence party uh i know in europe
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:38.640]  they're starting tsa style uh naked body scanners doing some groping i know that there's more and
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:44.000]  more checkpoints on the highways more and more internal policing all the borders themselves
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.600]  in many areas are wide open uh what other types of police state stuff are you seeing i know that
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:54.960]  they've got politically correct police now out there arresting people for stuff that's legal in
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:00.960]  the u.s i know there's all sorts of persecution of people that try to stand up for nationalism
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:07.840]  yeah i mean the european union doesn't like people standing up for nation states in fact
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:13.760]  let me just quickly move on to this i'll come back to that uh the guy who's just been elected as the
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:19.040]  president of the european parliament is a man called martin schultz he was elected last week
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:22.960]  it was the biggest undemocratics that took you've ever seen in your life in fact i'd
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:28.160]  refused to vote and they had refused to take part in this farce this was a presidency which was
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:34.960]  decided two and a half years ago now if you know the way the european union parliament works it sits
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:40.400]  for five years and you have a president whose term is two and a half years so in the five years you
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:47.520]  have two presidents the european parliament is run by two big groups you have the socialists and you
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:53.600]  have the european people's party which is the conservators well they're not real conservators
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:58.320]  but they pretend to be conservators although they are completely euro file and they would
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:02.880]  love more and more european unions to control people's lives and the way it works is that for
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:07.200]  two and a half years the conservators can have their president of the parliament and then for the
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.000]  next two and a half years they buy those votes and the socialists will then have their two and a half
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.840]  years as in the presidency so this guy Martin Schulz is the socialist who's just become the
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:23.120]  president of the european parliament this man is a dangerous fanatic more dangerous than anything
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:29.520]  you've ever seen before i ask your listeners go on youtube look at this man he is a fanatic
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:35.360]  fanatic nationalist of the european union he's not known very well in germany but this man will
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:41.200]  be known right across europe within the next two and a half years and in a way it's the best thing
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.720]  that could have happened to us if the best thing that could have happened to you kip because some
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:50.160]  of us are just coming to the conclusion that waste is better this man is the new face of europe
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:54.320]  believe me believe me alex you'll be hearing a lot more of martin schultz in the next two and a half
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:26:00.080]  years the very dangerous individual well i've noticed that whenever you're speaking or nigel
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:06.000]  farage or others bring up real issues they laugh at you and they're so arrogant and they just
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:12.160]  radiate criminal light from their eyes i mean you know slimy criminal types when you see them
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:19.920]  and these members of the the the bureaucracy know that you guys are ceremonial and they
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:23.840]  arrogantly sit there and laugh at you you're just you know meant to be there so folks think that
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:30.240]  they're electing their leaders in the euro and i think that that their hubris is something that
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:35.680]  backfires on them and they've got to realize from kopenhagen imploding to to so many other
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:40.400]  issues that time is running out for them well the man who does most of the laugh and was not
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:45.840]  laughing barely it's most of the shouting is actually martin schultz he's sitting there opposite
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:52.560]  nigel farage and he's shouting fascist at them and he's screaming abuse one trying to put them off
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:58.400]  but actually there's real anger there there's real hatred it's a feeling that you you surely
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:03.600]  can't be criticized in the european union this is his beloved project that is the same martin schultz
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:08.720]  who's now been elected to be the president who should be impartial an impartial president but
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:14.000]  we know he can't be impartial because it's not in his nature to be so he's a very angry little man
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.960]  he's also the same man who uh one of our members was throwing out a couple of months ago for
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:25.680]  having serious where i mean this guy is a pretty poor individual he'll be a pretty poor president
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:31.040]  but the good thing for us and the good thing for you guys on the internet is that you will now see
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:36.160]  the true face of the european union because everything which is wrong in politics is represented
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:43.360]  by this man what are you expecting to see them uh do next i know that the devos crowd announced
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:49.760]  last year they want 100 trillion in taxpayer money to give to themselves in in in banker bailouts
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:57.360]  now they're announcing that they're looking forward to the new system run by the bureaucrats
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:02.720]  that the that they're saying will get rid of outdated capitalism when it's been their insider
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:08.800]  crony capitalism that's actually caused the problems and i mean now they're really dispensing
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:16.160]  with any pretext that that this is democratic yes they are and as i said earlier you're talking
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:22.400]  about two EU technocrats who are now the prime ministers of great nation states in fact the
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:27.040]  tradeals of democracy if you do you want to call it that or the tradeals of civilization Greece and
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:33.760]  Italy they are doing away with every sort of pretence that we have democracy here i mean look
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:39.360]  they're going to be talking in a in a summit next week and what they'll be talking about is full
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:44.720]  physical union what they're going to try to do is to prop up the euro safety euro through full
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:48.960]  physical union when the people's of Europe aren't even being asked whether they want this in the
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:53.760]  first place the people's of Europe are being sidestepped again these are deals which will take
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:00.240]  place in smoke filled rooms behind closed doors they're doing away with any pretence of democracy
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:05.520]  all together the big problem that the EU has the big elephant the white elephant in the room
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:12.800]  is the euro because the euro itself cannot survive it cannot survive certainly in the
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:20.400]  cutting state that it's in and probably Greece Italy Spain Portugal maybe Ireland we'll have to
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:24.400]  fall off the euro in the end and they're going to do everything they can to try to prop it up and
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:30.160]  that'll really expose them member of the parliament EU parliament from England from the UK Paul

[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:16.640]  being inconvenienced the nashville tennessee airport below please find comments representative ron paul
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:22.560]  if you want full quotes media we've got the ron paul interview on the tsa we talked about how he's
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:27.520]  been groped at info wars dot com the police state in this country is growing out of control
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:34.400]  one of the ultimate embodiments of this is the tsa that groves and grabs our children
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.280]  our seniors and our loved ones and neighbors with disabilities the tsa does all this while
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:43.600]  doing nothing to keep us safe this is why my plan restore america in addition to cutting
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:49.520]  one trillion dollars in federal spending in the year eliminates the tsa we must restore the
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:55.040]  freedom and respect for liberty that once made america the greatest nation in human history
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:59.600]  i am deeply committed to doing that as president of the united states
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:08.000]  and this tsa is the big deal because if they can get away with this and violating the fourth
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:15.600]  amendment and and and and sell it on the back of the idea that we've got to protect you from
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:21.040]  any danger whether it be champagne corks that kill over a hundred people a year look it up
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:26.000]  world almanac or honey bees that kill several hundred a year or deer that kill several hundred
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.720]  a year not just running out in front of your car but sometimes deer actually kill people with
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:37.360]  their antlers a couple times a year or on and on and on there's thousands of things more dangerous
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:43.920]  than terrorism and most the terrorism is provocateur or flat outstaged but since winded land of the
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.760]  free home of the brave say the terrorists are so scary because they have beards and turbines on
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:52.320]  their heads that that we're going to overthrow the entire bill of rights of constitution and
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:57.920]  say you can't travel unless the tsa says so there's no more due process we're just going to do this
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:07.040]  this is the type of bull that makes my blood boil and of course they're saying that they
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:13.200]  didn't detain him all they ever do is lie about groping kids they're always saying i have people
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:18.480]  on the street come up and go alex the tsa has stopped groping children they've made the announcement
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.600]  now get emails like that i'm like they've made that announcement over and over again they keep
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:31.840]  doing it just like they said don't worry obama's gonna veto the ndaa and i said no he's not he's
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:38.960]  gonna sign it how do i know i know their playbook he said he would veto it so you wouldn't politically
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:48.080]  make an issue out of it now ron paul has introduced legislation to repeal it the sections that in
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.920]  positive commentators and patroops on the streets that allow them to black bag anybody they want
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:57.840]  have you disappeared forever that allow worldwide war without congress i mean this happens in every
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:03.280]  other country a bunch of crooks get in and run wild and commit a bunch of crimes that's always the
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:07.520]  first phase then they get scared that the people are waking up so they try to bring in a total
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:12.800]  tyranny and if it looks like they're about to get arrested they'll start a big war to try to get
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:19.680]  everybody to rally around them and do what they're told now i'm gonna open the phones up a little bit
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:28.160]  before baren von note house joins us the head of the liberty dollar illustrating the police state
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:34.800]  he'd been in coining silver and gold commemorative coins for more than three decades i remember watching
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:43.040]  his royal hawaiian mint ads when i was a teenager you know 14 years old laying around watching
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:50.480]  television on the weekend uh and and thinking boy those royal hawaiian coins look neat he was the
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:56.960]  owner of that and for i don't know 14 years he issues the liberty dollar silver gold and copper
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.280]  coins and his whole thing is about the federal reserve being a fraud and we should all get into
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:06.320]  golden silver totally legal totally lawful but what's wild is in fact guys i forgot to tell you to
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:12.000]  print this for me just type in just department statement on liberty dollar conviction it's
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.960]  going to read that it's on the fbi website just department statement on liberty dollar it's on
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:22.720]  the fbi website and they say these people are terrorist those that try to use alternate currencies
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:28.000]  are enemies and we will infiltrate frustrate and destroy them and all this i mean it's like
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:36.400]  they're talking about real criminals or something like themselves and they've got these kept federal
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:42.240]  juries that are total frauds and convict 98 of those that go before them just total kangaroo
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:48.000]  many cases paid off criminal hardcore criminals no justice at the federal level just sickening
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:53.760]  grand juries that work for narcotics trafficking murderers i mean that's basically what the government
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:58.720]  is i mean the troops publicly grow the opium now and tell you on the news and people are like well
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:04.720]  that's patriotic they can't even hide it anymore so what do they do well just put it on bbc and
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:10.320]  fox and cnn that an abc nightly news that the troops grow the opium and float it on c 130s but
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:20.960]  they don't talk about that again i'm living in a total twilight zone and he's facing sentencing
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:24.720]  next month and he's calling for people's help so we're gonna have him pop in for about 20 30
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:31.440]  minutes then i'll continue with your calls but it's really getting to me you know i guess in
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:37.360]  years past at night having a couple glasses of wine and eating a bunch of barbecue or whatever
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:45.520]  was a way to sedate myself but now running eight miles a day and cutting my calories in about half
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:54.560]  or more and cutting out alcohol and things i mean i i feel like i did when i was about 20 years old
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:04.880]  and i i just maybe i can't handle it because i am i'm just really getting angry and i'm sick of it
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:13.120]  i mean i am just getting so angry at the new world order but i'll tell you who i'm really angry at
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:18.640]  it's all these people that even as everything we warned you about comes true exactly like we said
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:25.280]  it would do you realize how horrible it's going to get after this this is nothing this is just the
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:29.760]  preparatory getting all their system lined up it's like when you're going to make a big dinner
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:35.840]  for friends that are coming over and you know you you go to the grocery store you get the food you
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:41.840]  unpack it you chop up the vegetables you get the meat ready you get the you know the marinade ready
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:48.560]  for the meat you you know make the salad you you put out a tablecloth you put the plates down you
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:58.400]  put the napkins there you you uh go out the backyard cut some flowers make a bouquet put some
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:09.840]  jazz on wipe some candles and the new world order let the candles folks they're done they're just
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:15.520]  waiting for dinner time of course you know what's on the menu right all the rest of our freedoms
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:22.240]  liberties and dignities humiliating bondage you know that folks live under bondage it's horrible
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:29.200]  and the financial bondage of having no future i hate seeing opportunity destroyed i hate seeing
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:35.680]  people working two three jobs and can't get ahead i i don't like lack of prosperity i don't like seeing
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:42.240]  people poor i don't like seeing people empty i don't like seeing people unhealthy i don't like seeing
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:53.120]  where all of this is going
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:04.080]  and the worst part is seeing how unconscious the average person is even if they know the
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:10.640]  government's out of control and big corporations control it they still think that somebody else's
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:16.960]  problem or there's nothing they can do about it there better be something you can do about it
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:25.200]  and there is see i want to tell people that serve the system something and then i'm going to get
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:35.200]  into more news i want to explain something to people
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:46.800]  i want to try to get something across to you you like to steal money and you like to sit around
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:54.400]  all day and you like insider scams and good old boy deals and you rationalize that well the money
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:43:00.240]  is just going to go to somebody anyways and that you're going to you know buy things in the economy
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:06.320]  so so so you got it all figured out but the problem is you can't stand up against other
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:11.840]  forms of corruption that are greater than what you've done because if you do the more corrupt
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:18.080]  people will simply blow the whistle on you in fact give me a document camp shot please for
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:21.920]  people that are watching on prisonplanet.tv a sharpie'd be better but i can do this with a
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:29.040]  regular ballpoint pen i'm going to show people how this works okay okay let's say here's a midline
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:36.880]  of people that will not engage in corruption and we're seen as the schmucks the idiots the suckers
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:45.920]  the morons you know the hard-working people are seen as idiots by the corrupt we're seen as marks
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:54.800]  we're seen as basically cannon fodder but it's a step-up process those that are a little corrupt
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:59.120]  you know they think it's not going to hurt anything and then there are those above them
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:03.680]  that don't do you know engage a little bit more corruption it's kind of stairs leading upwards
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:08.960]  or downwards and at each level though
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:16.640]  people that go along with corruption always tend to be self-centered they're not deeper
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:22.640]  more wisdom filled creatures they think they can engage in a little bit of cheating
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:31.840]  and the next person thinks that the next person the next person the next level as you go upwards
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:38.960]  in the continuum of corruption but by the time you get up here you're dealing with total sociopaths
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:45.360]  the time you go up a few steps you're dealing with just completely corrupt individuals who either
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:51.520]  don't care or who are sadistic and actually enjoy abusing people and like doing bad things
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:57.760]  and then you've also got psychopaths who just have no connection to reality
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:04.720]  and then you've got these master controller types who know what they're doing but want to be in
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:12.160]  control and see everybody as animals so they'll do anything and think that they're gods you know
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:16.720]  that's a good point john just popped in my ear and said and think that they're gods yeah the globalist
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:24.000]  play with us like our whole world is their little toy and watching us squirm and doing things in
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:30.400]  social engineering and these guys up here control the fractional reserve banking system so they control
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:36.640]  the symbol of energy money that they get out of nothing and then the whole world at every level
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:44.320]  will sell out their own mother down here for chicken feed these con artists made out of nothing
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:54.880]  but at every level of this corruption continuum that's got all these tentacles you know going
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:03.280]  down sucking off the general population if the lower level ever has a conscience or thinks what's
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:09.680]  happening up here is destructive or nihilistic this level can simply destroy the next level
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:14.320]  with the dirt that they have on them because most people on this level will go along with destroying
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:19.920]  that person because they don't want to upset the apple cart and it's the same at every level right
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:29.280]  down the line so what this creates is a acceleration of corruption because the most devious manipulative
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:41.440]  and ruthless will automatically ascend this continuum of evil and no one in the lower levels
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:45.440]  can say no to people in the higher levels as they escalate the corruption
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:54.000]  because they're all in on it and of course what does this create
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:07.200]  it creates a society of pure death it creates a collapse of the general society
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:14.160]  so the globalists understand all this so they've created a cosmology on record that they call a
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:21.920]  post-industrial world where the standard of living is lowered and being poor and the language being
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:27.760]  reduced and the art being reduced and destroyed all this ugliness and everything is sold as beauty
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:37.760]  so it's not survival of the fittest as they say raising the species it's actually lowering the
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:53.360]  species and that's the fruits of this system and it is a race to the bottom it is a giant
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.960]  sucking sound not just of jobs but of our families and of our morals and of everything we are
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:10.640]  it is death the new world order at the end of the day is all about death because you see in
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:15.360]  this continuum in this competition for who can be the most destructive and the most evil
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:25.520]  these globalists i guess kind of enter into a type of insanity
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:33.280]  i mean that's what it is when they've got 50 000 plus nuclear weapons globally aimed at everybody
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:39.680]  and they've got gmo giant factories everywhere splicing organisms as fast as they can giving
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:48.960]  rise to superviruses bacteria elizkos on and on micro plasms and every disease you could imagine
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:54.800]  being weaponized and stored in facilities that are designed to basically release them at one point
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:02.400]  and radiation levels rising and all of the fruits of this system
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:07.120]  metastasizing
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:15.840]  and then those of us that don't like the death that don't like the evil that don't like the fraud
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:24.560]  that don't like the corruption the fbi homeland security adl southern
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:31.920]  poverty law center corporate dinosaur media they run around talking about how horrible we are
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:39.520]  and how extreme we are and how bad we are because we see what they are and we see that the system has

[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:21.920]  unifies people across political lines that's why the white house has come out against ran poll

[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:36.480]  white house age uh come out and a side with tsa and ran paul standoff
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:44.000]  and they go on to say that uh we filed a procedure yeah they had procedures in nazi
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.640]  germany and soviet russia gulags too remember bush when you talk about torture and defend it
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:52.880]  he'd say these are professionals and he'd say it with this little twinkle in his eyes it's so
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:59.920]  professional what we're doing you study criminology it's always very professional
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:06.800]  how the tyranny it makes it okay if it's a professional the white house is standing by
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:12.160]  the transportation security administration and it's standoff with senator ran paul and his father
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:16.960]  republican presidential candidate representative ron paul the elder paul called the tsa a police
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:23.680]  state monday after senator paul was reportedly detained by tsa after he refused to take a pat down
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:29.440]  from the tsa officials the nashville international airport white house press secretary j carney said
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:34.400]  monday that he didn't have any reaction to paul's comment about police state no you just had the
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:39.600]  president sign a law that every constitutional lawyer has said is the ultimate police state
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:44.720]  secret arrest disappearance of citizens you don't know anything about that do you or the tens of
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:49.920]  trillions your bosses help steal for foreign banks from us taxpayer money you don't know nothing about
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:58.400]  that do you but carney um sided with the tsa said i think it's absolutely essential that we take
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:03.200]  necessary actions to ensure air travel is safe kind of like all your highway checkpoints make
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:08.720]  sure we stay safe from you the criminal government representative paul who was one of four remaining
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:15.360]  republican candidates for president this agreed monday afternoon paul said after he confirmed the
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:21.040]  incident involving senator paul on his twitter page that it showed why the tsa should be eliminated
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:27.840]  and he went on see they hate it they want to pass their tsa garbage and have us just lay down and
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:32.240]  take it and their ndaa and have us lay down and take it they want us to all just act like it's
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:37.920]  normal but by fighting back we expose just how outrageous these crooks are stay with us third
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:47.200]  hour coming up you are listening to gcn visit gcn live dot com today
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:55.360]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:59.680]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:04.720]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:10.320]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:15.440]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:20.720]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:25.360]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:30.720]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:35.120]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:41.040]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's

[01:59:47.200 --> 02:00:02.960]  1-877-327-0365 waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:12.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:21.840]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:34.640]  you know last thursday with wane paul brother of uh ron paul we first talked about this and
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:40.800]  curtain emma wrote a story saying hey what's happening in iowa the media there is saying that
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:46.800]  that the election outcome is in question but that rick santorum is now the winner of iowa
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:55.520]  but then it just fades off into history and then over the weekend cbs news reported and
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:01:01.120]  i'm going to get a special article out on this uh later at info wars dot com it says estimated
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:15.840]  republican delegates scorecard and it says ron paul zero delegates and then another one it says
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:26.080]  ron paul three delegates so it's a very very very very very very strange that now they're just
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:32.640]  talking about ron paul not getting any of the delegates i mean how could ron paul i mean here's
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:38.240]  the cbs read they're getting from the state of iowa romney 19 santorum 12
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:42.320]  paul three
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:56.480]  three so there's this mystery and then no one is even asking well okay who does get the delegates
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:07.280]  and i mean that's the crazy part about all this just huge things happen all the time
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:11.280]  and it's just move along
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:20.560]  but then if some football player you know cracks a nail you'd think space aliens had
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:26.640]  landed in central park the story's so big now i know we've got loaded phones here for 20 minutes
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:33.360]  we're going to have bernard von notaus the owner of liberty dollar who's been convicted and is
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:40.400]  facing sentencing he has begun for a long time for issuing silver and gold coins something totally
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:47.200]  legal even the associated press when he got convicted last year uh said but we read the law
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:51.920]  that clearly isn't against the law what he did wall street journal even said it was a miscarriage
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:03:00.400]  but didn't matter they've got grand juries that will convict anybody federal grand juries i mean
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:05.680]  again do you really believe 98 percent of people it was like 96 a few years ago now it's 98 nationally
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:10.640]  98 percent of people that go to court with the feds go to jail and the feds love that
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:14.960]  that's why they'll ship cocaine in and heroin and ship guns out and get caught not getting
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:20.480]  trouble because they're murdering gangsters folks at the top these are hardcore criminals
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:27.920]  the magnitude of which makes the head spin and i keep just going back to that
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:31.040]  that i mean they think we're so dumb
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:40.480]  that they just engage in all sorts of incredible crimes and then just declare national security
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:45.600]  what we have is a mafia that owns and runs our military through fraud that declares national
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:54.320]  security and diplomatic immunity and of course it's coming out in the news that uh ron paul
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:59.760]  and ron paul members of congress have immunity under the constitution of course the bill of
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:04.800]  rights gives you immunity to these out-of-control searches but the white house says it doesn't
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:11.360]  matter now here's steve watson's article tsa directly violates u.s constitution by detaining
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:16.400]  senator ron paul and preventing kentucky senator ron paul from flying to washington this morning
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:21.680]  the tsa directly violated the law as written in the u.s constitution yeah they say he's gonna
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:29.360]  miss some votes now yeah well they can put him on no fly list they say he'll never fly again no judge

[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:22.480]  legalize their criminal activity tyranny is just government by criminals by gangs now this article
[02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:27.840]  is key at info wars dot com and nobody's really pointing this out the white house is weighed in
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:36.560]  and says good job detaining senator paul the congress has already become ceremonial ran paul
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:42.400]  is trying to change that and and and you know take back the constitutional powers on war you name it
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:50.240]  but the tsa directly violates us constitution by detaining senator ran paul see why does the
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:59.280]  un have diplomatic immunity well out of our common law that's how they claim that power that they're
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:08.640]  voting and so if people detain them or people persecute them that could stop them from carrying
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:14.720]  out their office and that because their work is so important there's always criminal intrigues
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:21.040]  to try to set them up if they're not going along with what a different part of the establishment
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:29.600]  wants but to boil it down very simply in the constitution during the house or senate being
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:38.640]  open for business you cannot arrest or detain a senator or representative i'm going to read
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:42.720]  this a lot of people don't know about this but this is diplomatic immunity basically
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:48.720]  now as soon as that is over then it can be looked at but i'm going to read you from the
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:53.760]  constitution now again you've got these potbellied nobodies they got legislation in congress where
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:58.000]  they quit calling themselves officers they're not officers they're not trained they're not bonded
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.320]  they've had a background check you know about them robbing bags all of it we're going to our
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:09.680]  guest here in a moment tsa directly violates us constitution by detaining senator ran paul
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:14.480]  and preventing kentucky senator ran paul from flying to washington and he is going to miss
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:19.680]  some votes this morning the tsa directly violated the law is written in the u.s constitution but
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:25.120]  what did bush call it a gd piece of paper the constitution specifically protects federal
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:31.760]  lawmakers from being detained while in route to washington dc article one section six states
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:41.520]  the senators and representatives shall in all cases you hear that the senators and representatives
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:46.800]  shall in all cases this is just the law of the land though folks yeah the law of the land says
[02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:49.920]  potbellies can't be sticking their hands down your pants without warrants but they do it
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:56.000]  the senators and representatives shall in all cases accept trees and felony and breach of the
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:04.560]  peace be privileged from the arrest during the attendance at the session you hear that
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:12.880]  of their respective houses and in going to and returning from the same traveling to and from
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:18.800]  their district ran paul was traveling from his home in louisville to attend a session in the senate
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:26.480]  today this is the reason the tsa officials not servants have since put out the talking point
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:30.240]  to the media that ran paul was never officially detained these are the same folks that said
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:33.680]  they weren't strip searching old ladies and now admit they were the same folks should always say
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:37.600]  they're not strip searching little kids but they admit they are despite the fact the senator
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:44.160]  himself confirmed that he was told to sit in a cubicle and wait without any indication of whom
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:49.200]  and when he would be allowed to leave the senators back in session at 2 p.m. in votes
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:56.800]  are scheduled for 4 30 senator paul was allowed to board a second flight after a second screening
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:03.120]  by a tsa agents however it remains to be seen whether he will make it to the capital in time
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:09.440]  well the fourth amendment says that they can't secretly arrest us and have us disappear but
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:14.880]  they've signed a law saying they can't which is no void marbury versus madison and hundreds of other
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:26.640]  federal rulings in all crimes we're entitled to a jury but you disappear do you get one of the
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:33.040]  irs to get one with cps they've created fake courts for the irs fake courts for the cps it's all

[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:25.120]  email um for aid he's a great patriot been on many times so we've got him on uh baron vaughn
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:33.520]  notehouse bernard vaughn notehouse i like that on the on i knew his name was bernard
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:39.600]  been interviewing him for like 15 years and on my uh on my on my guest sheet it says baron vaughn
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:43.200]  notehouse it kind of sounds like a guy would have a name you know he'd be a baron though it's a cool
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:48.240]  name it says baron vaughn notehouse he keeps saying baron i'm like things bernard and sure
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:56.960]  and yeah it's bernard vaughn notehouse that's a funny one ah uh but uh getting back to this
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:07.680]  this is from the federal government's own website and we'll put it up on screen here right now
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:19.840]  uh with the uh fbi seal on it this is what the federal government put out the day that mr
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:23.120]  notehouse was convicted
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:31.520]  this is the western district of north carolina fbi federal bureau of investigation
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:39.600]  u.s attorney's office march 18 2011 western district of north carolina of course they waited
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:45.840]  a long time almost record time for sentencing because the media even the ap even the wall
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:49.840]  street journals said they read the statute and what he did was not illegal you know printing
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:54.800]  your own gold and silver coinage he didn't advertise it as u.s government or federal reserve stuff
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:16:00.720]  let's see he put out wrong poll coins folks so we had to go to jail
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:12.160]  and here's their press release about bernard vaughn notehouse now listen to what they say
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:16.480]  here at the end and we'll scroll down to the bottom attempts to undermine the legitimacy
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:22.560]  and legitimate currency of this country are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:25.520]  you're wondering what they're going to use the ndaa on and all this here it is
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:33.840]  u.s attorney tomkins said in announcing the verdict but the good news is everybody who
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:39.760]  looked at this knows he didn't break the law but they have kept juries of of of servile demons
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:46.480]  who will send anyone they're told to jail the two percent of the time you're not convicted is when
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:50.080]  one hand doesn't know what the others doing and you're some government narcotics trafficker
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:56.480]  and they just let you off wall these forms of anti-government activities i'm reading from
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:00.800]  from their statement wall these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence
[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:04.640]  so they're saying it's it's illegal to be anti-government when your government's a bunch of criminals
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:09.360]  wall these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence they are every bit as
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:14.080]  insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the economics stability of this country
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:20.160]  i thought it was the foreign banks imploding our economy and nafta and gat she added a danger
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:26.000]  we are determined to meet these threats through infiltration this is a guy publicly advertising
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:33.200]  on national tv oh they infiltrated disruption and dismantling of organizations would seek to
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:38.000]  challenge the legitimacy of our democratic form of government oh yeah don't challenge the government
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:44.320]  uh and we'll put you in jail for challenging the legitimacy of the government
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:48.720]  see we're saying you're illegitimate and they're saying no no no we're not illegitimate you're
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:53.440]  going to jail you don't like the government shipping guns into mexico we'll just arrest you
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:02.880]  and they go on to celebrate how many years he's facing prison uh bernard von note house
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:06.960]  good to have you on we're about to go to break but uh you're facing sentencing soon uh and i guess
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:11.360]  they sleep good at night knowing how many people they send to prison here buddy probably better than
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:18.320]  me alex yep well what's the saying about uh you know when tyrants run things the patriots rot in
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:26.400]  filthy jails i think that's the case well uh we're about to go to break and i i was a long intro there
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:34.160]  but uh how can we help you i guess we plead on the judge who sits on top of this fake court and
[02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:38.400]  uh asked their lordship not i mean the judge should have mistrialed it right there i mean
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:42.720]  i think they waited eight nine months to do this because obviously you know as you know the news
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:47.440]  media even the establishment dinosaurs read the code and said what you did wasn't illegal
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:51.760]  actually alex we're at a critical stage in the trial right now because i'm facing
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:58.000]  sentencing up to 22 years and so i've asked people who support the liberty dollar and the
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:04.400]  idea of that it represents in other words honest golden silver money to actually write a letter
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:11.360]  to judge boy he's asking him either to dismiss my case or to sentence me to no prison time
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:17.040]  and if people really want to do that and they want to help then they should actually email me
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:24.800]  very simply bernard at liberty dollar dot org and i will reply with the judge's address uh but
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:32.000]  we do indeed people to write as many letters than that to be long short is good but it comes down to
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:38.960]  show a popular support for the cause that liberty dollar exemplifies that is right the judge and
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:46.240]  by the way hundreds of cities towns private groups have their own money uh i mean i mean that's what
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:51.840]  gift cards are but but but you put out a wrong paul coin so you need to go to jail for 22 years
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:57.040]  at taxpayer expense and uh they've got people calling you a terrorist we'll be right back

[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:25.840]  you promote gold and silver private currencies totally legal what's illegal is creating a
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:32.720]  counterfeit of us dollars which is what the federal reserve did you don't have a us dollar you
[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:36.960]  have a federal reserve note so it's funny they're accusing him of what they're doing he never
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:42.480]  acted like he was a us government currency he was all about don't trust the corrupt
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:49.600]  federal reserve currency and so they went into their little jury and they say here he's a terrorist
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:57.600]  and they go okay 22 years in prison as a terrorist for 14 years putting out gold and silver coins
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:02.960]  and again we covered this at the time wall street journal associated press i fact i was
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:06.880]  shocked they rarely get something right they went and looked at the code and law and said this guy
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:17.760]  didn't break the law they don't care they don't care uh so bernard von note house is our guest
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:24.800]  how big of a wake-up call has this been them coming out and saying you're a terrorist
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:33.360]  it's been a huge wake-up call halex because uh the people have really been shocked by that statement
[02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:39.520]  that you read earlier by and tomkins and what's amazing is is that they had that statement
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:46.560]  was bang ready to go when the verdict came in it was like almost they knew that i was going
[02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:52.960]  to be found guilty because i mean the guilty verdict came in about 10 o'clock in the morning
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:58.880]  and they issued that in the early afternoon i mean boy that was awfully fast work for the federal
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:05.280]  government well they're good people you know fast and furious and uh agent orange and the
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:12.080]  government grows the opium and afghanistan on record but they're good people now uh continuing if
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:16.960]  you've got the contact info for the judge uh you know for people that have been involved with
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:23.120]  liberty dollar especially to you know to contact the court as his customary uh and to make comment
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:28.640]  on sentencing how do folks do that well actually alex that's a very important and critical part
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:34.560]  of the whole process i've been to and of course that's the sentencing the government's trying to
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:41.280]  get the judge to sentence me to 22 years in prison so we've been asking people uh if they're
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:46.400]  they don't have to have been involved with liberty dollar they maybe they just want to take a stand
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:53.760]  against the tyranny that the government is uh um saying that uh that we did you know they're saying
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:58.960]  that the liberty dollar was counterfeit so if people want to take a stand they should write to
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:09.200]  the honorable richard boy he's uh that's b-o-o-r-h-e-e-s and he's a district court judge uh he's in a
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:20.240]  western district of north carolina uh the address itself is is uh 250 charles federal charles r jones
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:28.000]  j-o-n-a-s federal building i think you could just send it to uh the federal courthouse and it would
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:35.680]  get to him uh the street address is 401 west trade street that's in charlotte north carolina
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:44.480]  28202 um or they could just send me a quick email burnered at liberty dollar and ask for the
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:49.680]  information and i'd be happy to reply to that you know but you know it doesn't take a long letter
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:55.440]  alex uh this is a really a show of force in terms of people in the community that support liberty
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:28:00.320]  dollar and the ideals it represents in other words honest gold and silver money you know what's funny
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:04.800]  about the feds they're not happy enough to have stolen all the gold and silver and copper turned
[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:09.920]  out you had me a bigger supplies and you were even supposed to to back it all up yes uh that that's
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:14.800]  not enough for them if they want you to get the maximum sentence of 22 years i'd say that's some
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:20.320]  bad karma these folks are piling up for themselves well they obviously are trying to bury me there's
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:26.640]  no doubt about that i'd be as you pointed out earlier there are hundreds of other currencies
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:32.080]  out there in a lot of different communities across the united states uh the antique hours been out
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:40.160]  there since 1991 so this is simply nothing new but the idea of having a local currency a private
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:46.800]  currency that's a hundred percent backed up by gold and silver that is what i think really scared
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:52.400]  the hell out of uh our favorite federal government well yeah i know because they work for foreign
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:56.720]  banks this isn't the federal government they're the banksters and you were one of the biggest
[02:28:56.720 --> 02:29:01.440]  outfits out there and so they just made you a political prisoner or or they're about to try to
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:08.800]  do that and and i guess that's you mean india i mean you're an american terrorist and they say so
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:15.360]  so you disappear now yeah i'm already qualified for the mda a alex i mean you know i've already
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:20.720]  been declared a terrorist they might come and get me at any time i could hear him knock on the door

[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:02.560]  attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country are simply a unique form of domestic
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:08.800]  terrorism us attorney tomkins said in announcing the verdict the fbi put this out as a press release
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:14.640]  they they want to scare us all these forms of anti-government season none of homeland securities

[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:25.520]  activities are not involved violence they're every bit as insidious a secret of the tv ads
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:30.320]  he had running and represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of this country
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:35.600]  she added we are determined to meet this threats through infiltration disruption and dismantling
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:40.880]  of organizations which seek to challenge the legitimacy of our democratic former government
[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:46.560]  i thought the government was it was overthrowing the constitution bill of rights i thought that's
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:52.000]  what was happening so he's facing sentencing coming up next month 22 years in prison in the
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:58.240]  just like the feds sent advisors into illinois and to the state and they all went down last year
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:04.960]  in that case where where the guy filmed cops towing his cars away and stuff and mr allison
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:10.880]  and and they actually put briefs in and said we want him to serve life in prison yes
[02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:16.240]  and the judge went you know what i'm gonna dismiss this but if he wouldn't have dismissed it
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:20.720]  that state jury that they think it's good to put somebody in prison they go in there and they get
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:25.280]  off on it and the cops come in and pat and the prosecutor pats them on the head and they go
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:29.120]  who do we screw up in prison they're like don't worry we're gonna put some innocent people in
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:33.760]  there and they all get real excited you you think i'm joking i remember when a listener called me
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:40.720]  and we're going to mr. note house then your calls kelly rushing in lyon county kentucky
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:47.520]  this is about eight years ago now and he said mr. jones i'll send you the newspaper clipping

[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:30.000]  yes it's going to court so then they had the hearing and the cops come comes in and says
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:34.800]  he gave you that video and it's anti-government and the judge says we find that threatening
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:39.920]  you will convict and the jury didn't and it was in the news but they actually wanted to put him
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:44.960]  in jail for going officer in fact the copy of testified this is important for your future and

[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:39.440]  they'll trump something up i didn't matter though i've already heard them bad and we're gonna
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:45.280]  go but anyways they're the terrorists and they know it uh and i and you know what i mean i hope
[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:49.600]  people contact the judge and but i mean the fact of the judge wouldn't even mistrial this to begin
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:53.600]  with i mean i mean what do you think of this judge overall i know you've tried to say nice
[02:38:53.600 --> 02:39:00.640]  things in the past throw yourself on his godly mercy you know our little tyrant leader but i
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:07.360]  mean what are you facing here 22 years what do you do to his lordship well actually i think the judge
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:14.880]  who was was straight up uh in the trial and i i think that he may have been uh shocked as i was
[02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:24.160]  in terms of the verdict uh i the judge i think presided over a fair and honest trial but i think
[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:33.040]  that the jury certainly aired uh very seriously i mean they were only out less than an hour you
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:38.800]  can read different opinions of different articles but trust me alex i was there i was watching the
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:45.680]  clock and it was just about an hour a little less than an hour that the jury was out and this is on
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:53.760]  three very serious federal offenses counterfeiting obviously and uh they found me guilty on all three
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:59.840]  counts in less than an hour i mean they couldn't even read the jury instructions jury instructions
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:06.080]  was 72 pages they could even have read the jury instructions in an hour and of course if they
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:11.440]  had read the jury instructions then they would have known that we made an extremely strong
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:18.640]  defense in terms of no mens rea there was no criminal all these juries care about the federal
[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:23.120]  ones is the cash they get on the side it's been proven in many cases but in others it's just
[02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:28.320]  they're mentally ill authority worshipers and all they care about is the satisfaction of seeing
[02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:34.000]  you convicted and having the prosecutor nod at them with a little psycho goodie look and it's that
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:39.120]  little psycho enjoyment so they go back to their miserable houses their miserable lives their
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:44.720]  scum filled existence it's just all about abusing good people it's it's a demonic celebration
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:49.600]  well i really don't know much about the jury to be honest with you because i don't know much
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:58.640]  about north carolina but i do know that the majority of jurors were unemployed um and so uh
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:07.760]  obviously uh uh they didn't care uh about uh taking time i mean they were getting paid no
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:13.040]  that's why they're lazy scum oh yeah a lot of us just they're just lazy exactly i'll just prison
[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:21.840]  nab scum well whatever they did they they certainly surprised me because i thought that i was going
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:27.520]  to be found not guilty i i wasn't even planning on staying the whole day but as it turned out
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:34.960]  they immediately launched into uh the forfeiture hearing i mean within 15 minutes after i was
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:43.040]  found guilty they convened a hearing to fluff it all over now we're talking about nine times here
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:48.400]  out and this is people's property on record uh a private bank account kind of like mf global
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:53.840]  well it isn't a bank account but it is their private property that was being held by well
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:58.800]  sure that's my point is that they have certificates of it absolutely it's their account absolutely
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:02.480]  that's how banks started is you'd have golden silver in a place so you wouldn't get knocked on the
[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:07.760]  head then you'd have paper that you could receive it as you know yes the point is that they and
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:14.240]  that's theirs because they're the good government well that's what they're saying uh and there is
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:22.960]  a motion before the court uh for the judge to give them the uh dibs if you would prima facia
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:28.400]  evidence that they have right to all the seized property well that's not going to go anywhere
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:34.960]  uh there's also another motion before the judge which is our post trial motion which is asking
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:40.640]  him to dismiss the case because the jury aired so if anybody was going to write to the judge
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:48.960]  that would be an extremely good thing to ask him is to approve our motion and dismiss the case
[02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:56.800]  either that or give me no prison time uh while i uh appeal the uh the verdict because we will
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:03.920]  certainly appeal this trial halex well that's good news now i guess you'll be clapping irons
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:08.000]  though while the appeal goes on because the feds will probably say you're dangerous or something
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:13.360]  well they may say i'm dangerous but i have been out this whole time which is uh
[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:21.120]  about uh two and a half years or so now on an appearance bond and even though they did try to
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:30.160]  uh violate me on the appearance bond once and threw me in jail uh the judge let me out so i
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:37.520]  would say there's a very good chance that i would be released on my appearance bond pending appeal
[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:45.120]  it is unheard of uh dismissing the case is all but unheard of but being released so i can actually
[02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:53.440]  fight for the appeal um is pretty good alex but the bottom line is is right now i'm facing sentencing
[02:43:53.440 --> 02:44:00.400]  i don't know what's going to happen at sentencing uh dismissing the case is all but impossible and
[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:05.920]  what is that coming up in february the hearing with the kangaroo court well that just did they
[02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:11.200]  haven't set the time for the sentencing yet but we're coming up to the first anniversary can you
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:16.560]  imagine it's been a year since i was convicted alex i mean it's been a long time um okay because
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:20.160]  your email to me i thought it said february i guess you're guessing that's what it's going to be
[02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:26.080]  yes that's what we're projecting is that uh that's what the court is hinting at that it could be
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:32.240]  february uh and it it could be later than that uh we don't know but we know that we're getting
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:39.280]  closed and we know that we got to fire up the troops to actually write the judge and ask him
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:48.000]  to dismiss the case or no prison time wow wow all right we will continue to talk to you as
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:53.040]  this unfolds a burner divine note house thank you so much for joining us i appreciate alex i'll send
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:59.200]  you that info so that you can post that so whether the people can actually uh contact the judge then
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:06.880]  yes sir okay thank you so much alex thank you my friend um it it just makes my blood boil i remember
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:12.320]  when they first rated them took their gold silver and a copper and he was kind of laughing about it
[02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:17.840]  whenever he was going to court because i mean he's doing what literally hundreds of companies have
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:26.400]  done for hundreds of years but he was popular and supporting ron paul and uh i said man they're gonna
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:34.960]  convict you i mean this isn't a real government there's no justice there's no laws with these
[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:40.160]  people they do what they want the one thing holding them back is they haven't recruited enough criminals
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:46.160]  they're recruiting criminals into government as fast as they can and trying to kick out the good people
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:50.640]  and right now their global masters are trying to teach them to be confident
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:57.920]  and so they're showing them with fast and furious and the government growing the drugs in afghanistan
[02:45:57.920 --> 02:46:03.520]  and publicly shipping it into america they're kind of showing everybody to the troops look we're
[02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:08.160]  allowed to do this we're on fox and the troops are all oh and you want us to talk about it i
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:11.600]  thought this is classified no it's time to go public
[02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:19.760]  and that's kind of like congress they're like so uh dinecore runs child kidnapping ranks they're
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:25.440]  like yes we're allowed to and they're like okay well it's not public i mean it's just pure mega
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:30.240]  maximum evil out in the open totally just out of control danger zone
[02:46:30.240 --> 02:46:37.440]  with a bunch of compartmentalized morons running around on the bottom acting all
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:42.240]  serious like it's important to hin peck the general public and suck every dime out of
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:45.920]  as you can because your bosses tell you the country's gonna go bankrupt if you don't raise
[02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:51.360]  more revenue when the revenues all sucked out of the nation faster than you can whistle
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:58.320]  it doesn't matter though you just got to experience it those of you that want to
[02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:03.280]  serve this system you're going to have to just experience it so drink more tap water give your
[02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:13.040]  kids more shots uh bisfee in all a products aspartame msg you know what don't believe me
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:20.800]  i'm a kook i'm the bad man you're right and it's good to ship guns into mexico and drugs
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:25.680]  back in as the government's been caught doing and uh it's good to have the troops use du and it's
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:31.120]  good to take their pension funds and uh it's all good then okay great uh let's go to ed in texas
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:40.240]  said you're on the air welcome uh yes alex this is ed fox 777 great to talk to you hey buddy yes um
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:45.680]  i was to have a really important question and i was wondering if you can explain or rationalize
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:52.000]  why is it that if the senior citizen conservative voters by majority who are once talked to us
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:58.320]  when growing up to read the constitution get into politics now don't listen to the young voters who
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:04.560]  by majority follows wrong paul and the senior citizens who just cares about their retirement checks
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:08.960]  threatened by obama it doesn't matter though hey all those seniors are going to have their
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:13.280]  that money devalued they're you already see 80 year olds out there working everywhere
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:16.320]  all these people that go along with socialism and try to keep the retirement they're not going to get
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:19.760]  it anyways so don't worry they'll be judged by their own greed they're going to lose it all
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:27.200]  all that is what they want believe me they're going to get it but uh let me expand they like
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:32.640]  feeling like their winners they think fox news is their friend while fox news puts out christmas
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:39.840]  cards make it fun of them as dumb sheep and so they are literally watching television in a mesmerized
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:46.720]  state they're zombies and so they don't care about romes for abortion open borders gun control and
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:53.520]  carbon taxes they're told their winners and that they're trendy when they vote for him so they feel
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:59.200]  powerful out on the golf course and like they're part of the winning team it's like a bandwagon
[02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:04.640]  thing and so they feel like the new world order is winning and so they're signed on to it do you
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:11.840]  understand that yes sir but uh but the talking points like raw paul is going to have drug addicts
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:17.600]  on the streets or destruction of israel or look look look look unfortunately most of these older
[02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:24.000]  folks line up and get mercury filled shots even though three of them uh flu shots on record
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  doubles your chances of Alzheimer's they love it i mean they're lining up to be killed they want it
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:35.360]  that they want mommy government to smash their brains out and it is they want to be hurt bad and
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:41.920]  it is it happens in every culture they want what they're going to get and they're going to get it
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:47.520]  they want tyranny they want world war three they want bondage they want to be starving on the street
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:52.800]  they'll get it they want their dollar devalued down to nothing they'll get it they'll get it all
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:57.040]  have you ever been around these federal prosecutors and people there are a bunch of
[02:49:57.040 --> 02:50:01.680]  chicken neck power tripping people that watch cop shows all all night when they get home and they
[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:06.080]  wear little suits and they're all into themselves and go into the courthouses acting all powerful
[02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:12.560]  and stamping around a little little fake world i mean the general public the older folks young
[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:19.120]  people whoever whoever's into the system is in a make-believe world i watch the secret service on
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:23.680]  tv with obama all acting tough and like they're looking around and it's all about this little
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:29.280]  play land of their real men and they're talking into their little vest thing it's all ridiculous
[02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:35.600]  the president runs nothing it's all theater it's a matrix it's all fake and it's all coming down
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:43.680]  and our only chance is to warn people ahead of time about everything that was going to happen
[02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:50.400]  so that as it all unfolds as we've said that will cause the great awakening but people are
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:56.400]  going to have to be in a lot more pain first they're going to have to have everything taken
[02:50:56.400 --> 02:51:00.560]  from them that's what the tyranny is about is totally bankrupting everybody

[02:54:04.880 --> 02:54:20.320]  it's been a pretty nutty show today we've had nut house and nut along
[02:54:21.760 --> 02:54:27.120]  that's a joke christus said you got to have some gallows humor i'm sorry i've been ranting so much
[02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:33.040]  today the audience seems to like it but it's not on purpose it's just the level of corruption is so
[02:54:33.040 --> 02:54:39.280]  ridiculous and it's getting worse by the second and you've got people that are waking up but some
[02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:44.080]  saying you can't affect any change others that are waking up that are taking action and this big
[02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:50.480]  sea of people that just have no idea what's even going on look at this article mexican state bordering
[02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:57.520]  us deadlier than all of afghanistan last year the just department's own numbers but that's not a
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:05.440]  problem let's leave the border wide open again out of sight out of mind they tell you they're
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:10.640]  doing all this keep you safe from terrorists fall on record prescription drug interactions are
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:16.080]  killing over 300 000 a year flesh eating bacteria are killing hundreds of thousands a year in
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:24.640]  complications they know about all the real crises i mean think of how crazy it is to say
[02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:29.200]  we're federalizing and setting up checkpoints all over the united states
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:38.640]  because a terrorist might strike a cornfield or a or a or a highway somewhere the idea they can
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:45.520]  just randomly search people is ridiculous all right i got a bunch of callers here i'm
[02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:53.840]  meant to get to more calls today uh it does make my head spin though uh let's go ahead and go to
[02:55:53.840 --> 02:56:00.800]  chris in texas christier on the air hey alex al-qaeda jones how's it going today oh good i had a real
[02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:06.800]  al-qaeda al-qaeda on earlier the feds say he's a domestic terrorist because uh he issues his own
[02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:12.800]  gold and silver and exposes the federal reserve well of course what do you expect from the nazi
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:17.520]  government we have nowadays all i know is is how much are they going to get away with i mean they're
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:22.640]  i mean they are really putting it in our face right now yeah well i need to take get rid of
[02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:27.360]  congress and start with a new new new batch starting with uh the gene pool from the from the
[02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:32.320]  paul family i think that'd be good i did have one quick question if you could pull up uh
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:40.960]  for the ndaa the 1022 and 1031 sections i'm not it's actually the 1022 section it looks like it
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:46.960]  does exclude us citizens from being detained if you could expand on that or read that and uh yeah
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:54.560]  the reason the aclu ron paul myself that section points to another section so when you repeal that
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:57:01.760]  section it removes the other section uh and so again it was written to be deceptive but the
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:07.600]  senators admit it's designed for us citizens and ins posse commentators i don't i don't have it in
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:11.200]  front of me in the few minutes we've got left we don't really screen call so i didn't know you were
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:16.720]  calling in about that subject or i would have had time i mean go to the aclu's website ron paul's
[02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:22.000]  broken down we've written articles breaking it down but but see they'll say this doesn't affect us
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:29.280]  citizens except in this case if the president says so it's kind of like us code title 50
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:35.680]  chapter 32 subsection 1520 a paragraph b it says the government can't do any secret chemical
[02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:42.560]  biological or radiological testing on you but then it says unless it mentions another section
[02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:48.080]  and then in that section it says unless it's for research purposes oh well if it's for research go
[02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:53.680]  ahead and shoot kids up with syphilis or spray chemical weapons on troops and kill them which
[02:57:53.680 --> 02:57:58.560]  they admit they've all done and the public goes and looks at the code and doesn't know what they're
[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:05.360]  reading it's like a non-disclosure act people will read it and say well it says here that
