[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live here, Gerald Salente with us five minutes to the next hour.
[00:29.960 --> 00:37.080]  He is the editor and publisher of the Trends Research Journal and you can visit his site
[00:37.080 --> 00:41.440]  at whattrendsjournal.com or trendsresearch.com.
[00:41.440 --> 00:42.440]  It's excellent.
[00:42.440 --> 00:46.040]  You've got the Rothschilds and Rockefellers merging, that happened a month ago, a sign
[00:46.040 --> 00:48.120]  that the whole world is coming together under this.
[00:48.120 --> 00:51.520]  They're announcing a banking dictatorship worldwide.
[00:51.520 --> 00:52.640]  They're butchering our liberties.
[00:52.640 --> 00:57.440]  How does Iran tie into that and the storm clouds there and what do you see happening
[00:57.440 --> 00:58.440]  in the election?
[00:58.440 --> 01:04.040]  Well, on Iran, I have to tell you, I'm quite upset about what I just saw.
[01:04.040 --> 01:12.600]  In Florida, they're running ads, campaign ads, featuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
[01:12.600 --> 01:17.720]  Netanyahu warning about that red line and no one's to tell Israel that they have a red
[01:17.720 --> 01:20.840]  light and how Iran's is great threat.
[01:20.840 --> 01:28.840]  I want to read to you a quote from our Autumn Trends Journal, it just went out last week.
[01:28.840 --> 01:37.880]  Mr. Prime Minister, you want a crude, rude, unprecedented, reckless and risky intervention
[01:37.880 --> 01:40.600]  into the U.S. elections.
[01:40.600 --> 01:43.760]  Who are you trying to replace?
[01:43.760 --> 01:50.880]  The administration in Washington or that of Tehran?
[01:50.880 --> 02:00.280]  That Alex was from Shol Moffaz, the head of Israel's Kadima Party.
[02:00.280 --> 02:02.480]  That's the second major party.
[02:02.480 --> 02:13.680]  Could you imagine that a foreign power is injecting themselves into our American election?
[02:13.680 --> 02:19.080]  There are the prostitutes saying what an outrage this is.
[02:19.080 --> 02:27.160]  That somebody should be running ads and telling us that we have to support Israel unconditionally.
[02:27.160 --> 02:31.280]  This is running on, and I'm going to make this clear, I'm not an anti-Semite.
[02:31.280 --> 02:35.560]  I'm not in favor of supporting anybody outside of America.
[02:35.560 --> 02:37.560]  I'm Italian.
[02:37.560 --> 02:41.560]  That's where my money would go first, but I don't want to go in there either.
[02:41.560 --> 02:46.400]  So to have this going on, so where is the election going?
[02:46.400 --> 02:48.920]  It's right at the wire.
[02:48.920 --> 02:51.680]  We had changed our forecast.
[02:51.680 --> 02:55.440]  We had believed that Obama was going to win.
[02:55.440 --> 03:01.600]  Now we don't know, and I'll tell you why, because it's all about performance.
[03:01.600 --> 03:03.440]  Look at what happened.
[03:03.440 --> 03:04.680]  Obama bombed.
[03:04.680 --> 03:07.880]  He was lackluster in the first debate.
[03:07.880 --> 03:16.000]  Oh, his poll numbers shot down, why, because it's the presidential reality show.
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.800]  There is no substance, so the second debate he does better is poll numbers move up.
[03:22.800 --> 03:25.800]  What did he say of substance?
[03:25.800 --> 03:30.840]  What did Romney say of substance in the last debate?
[03:30.840 --> 03:32.640]  How about nothing?
[03:32.640 --> 03:42.120]  There was one guy, Obama, trying to defend a track record that's undefensible, and then
[03:42.120 --> 03:46.960]  we have Romney with a plan that has no plan.
[03:46.960 --> 03:50.520]  So here's what the campaign debates have come down to.
[03:50.520 --> 03:56.520]  They get asked a question, and then what they do is they repeat the question, and after
[03:56.520 --> 04:02.840]  they repeat the question, they go, and, and kick into the same damn campaign speech we've
[04:02.840 --> 04:06.400]  been hearing over and over for over a year.
[04:06.400 --> 04:09.600]  So all it is about is performance.
[04:09.600 --> 04:17.440]  Look at the language that they use after that so-called debate that was hosted by Candy
[04:17.440 --> 04:25.920]  Crowley from the Cartoon News Network CNN, featuring Mouse Blitzer, ACDC 180, and the
[04:25.920 --> 04:27.920]  rest of the crap clown crew.
[04:27.920 --> 04:33.520]  Stay there, long segment coming up, Gerald Salente, and I've been up for more than 24
[04:33.520 --> 04:34.720]  hours, so I'm a little dingy.
[04:34.720 --> 04:37.840]  It's trendsresearch.com and trendsjournal.com.
[04:37.840 --> 04:43.240]  Trendsresearch.com and trendsjournal.com, and valuable, and you get the magazine there
[04:43.240 --> 04:44.240]  as well.
[04:44.240 --> 05:00.440]  We're right back with Gerald Salente to get into where he sees things going now.
[05:00.440 --> 05:03.360]  Cold and flu season is upon us.
[05:03.360 --> 05:09.400]  Protect yourself with supernatural silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial.
[05:09.400 --> 05:13.520]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be
[05:13.520 --> 05:19.560]  used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, as well as help improve
[05:19.560 --> 05:21.120]  wound healing.
[05:21.120 --> 05:25.720]  Silver salt technology is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to
[05:25.720 --> 05:31.400]  destroy the causes of many serious diseases like strep throat, staph, pneumonia, colds,
[05:31.400 --> 05:33.960]  flus, and other harmful pathogens.
[05:33.960 --> 05:38.680]  This new technology is much more effective than colloidal or ionic silvers, and has the
[05:38.680 --> 05:44.960]  ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness
[05:44.960 --> 05:47.400]  of older solutions.
[05:47.400 --> 05:50.520]  Supernatural silver is what you need for any emergency.

[05:57.000 --> 05:58.200]  us on Facebook.
[05:58.200 --> 06:08.120]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[06:08.120 --> 06:22.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:22.160 --> 06:26.760]  Now listen, we covered this yesterday, it's all over the news, Nobel Prize winning for
[06:26.760 --> 06:31.280]  economics Joseph Stick, former head of the World Bank, a chief economist there, says
[06:31.280 --> 06:34.040]  hey, it's a depression in Europe, it's going global.
[06:34.040 --> 06:38.240]  Wow, Gerald Salente's been saying that for four and a half years, so have I.
[06:38.240 --> 06:40.960]  But they said we left the recession four years ago and everything's great and oh, I'll just
[06:40.960 --> 06:46.760]  see those new unemployment numbers, oh yeah, I mean it is literally ridiculous, they could
[06:46.760 --> 06:53.720]  tell us the moon is made out of licorice next, or swiss cheese, and here is Gerald Salente
[06:53.720 --> 07:02.320]  of the Trends Journal, TrendsResearch.com joining us, and again, hands down he is everybody's
[07:02.320 --> 07:07.760]  favorite guest, and so you want him, you got him.
[07:07.760 --> 07:10.720]  Right here, and we don't do pre-interviews, it's whatever he basically wants to cover
[07:10.720 --> 07:15.040]  and you know points I want to ask, but Gerald, I just got to ask you, I mean it's coming
[07:15.040 --> 07:19.480]  to a head with the TSA, they're now at highway checkpoints, taking people into trailers
[07:19.480 --> 07:24.040]  and grabbing their genitals, I mean, I don't fly now basically unless I have to because
[07:24.040 --> 07:30.000]  of it, I won't fly with my wife and kids because I can't put up with it, and now they've got
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.720]  army checkpoints popping up, not just drills everywhere, I mean they are, we're going into
[07:34.720 --> 07:39.440]  martial law, they're just not going to call it that, Jumbo Tron's going up at mall, America
[07:39.440 --> 07:44.880]  Walmart saying don't trust anyone but Big Sis, Obama announcements to people's phones,
[07:44.880 --> 07:49.480]  I mean we are going into a science fiction system, why is the ruling class turning the
[07:49.480 --> 07:55.360]  heat up a thousand times, I mean this is just, I feel like I'm in fantasy land right now.
[07:55.360 --> 08:02.320]  But we said when the crash began in the panic of 08, that we said that after all of the
[08:02.320 --> 08:10.000]  recovery failed, they would take us to war, and taking us to war takes its shape in different
[08:10.000 --> 08:16.840]  ways, and the war now is to control the people, look at the numbers that just came out two
[08:16.840 --> 08:24.120]  days ago, oh violent crime is up 18%, what a shock, blow me away, how could that have
[08:24.120 --> 08:30.200]  happened, you know my saying, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose,
[08:30.200 --> 08:36.240]  they lose it, and by the way before we go on I want to thank you so much for all you
[08:36.240 --> 08:43.880]  are doing, for how hard you and your team are working, and how dedicated you all are,
[08:43.880 --> 08:50.920]  and I'm listening to that lineup of guests that you have, and there's nothing in any
[08:50.920 --> 08:59.320]  of the media, mainstream or otherwise, that could match a ticket like that, and so thank
[08:59.320 --> 09:06.080]  you very much for what you are doing, and it also came into my mind many, oh about four
[09:06.080 --> 09:13.240]  years ago about that you did that expose on Obama when everyone was still drinking the
[09:13.240 --> 09:21.200]  Kool-Aid called the Obama deception, and I encourage everyone to take a look at that
[09:21.200 --> 09:31.080]  because it fit right in with our motto, the signature of the trends journal, history before
[09:31.080 --> 09:39.080]  it happens, and that's what you did with the Obama deception, with myself and others that
[09:39.080 --> 09:45.840]  were on there, we showed the history of how this would play out when he just started playing
[09:45.840 --> 09:53.760]  the role as commander in chief, and then before I answer your question, please after I get
[09:53.760 --> 10:01.840]  off the air, we'd like to also contribute to keeping this money bomb growing so you
[10:01.840 --> 10:09.040]  could have the best equipment, the best satellite hookups, and get this message around the world
[10:09.040 --> 10:16.720]  because as Joseph Stiglitz said, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, yeah it's crashing over
[10:16.720 --> 10:22.400]  there in Europe, no kidding, I would have never guessed, it couldn't be because they
[10:22.400 --> 10:30.760]  have 25% unemployment in Greeks, no, it couldn't be because 80,000 people took to the streets
[10:30.760 --> 10:38.760]  yesterday in Greece protesting again, the fourth one this month, no, no that had nothing
[10:38.760 --> 10:44.120]  to do with it, couldn't be because of those millions of Spanish that are taking to the
[10:44.120 --> 10:54.000]  streets virtually weekly circling the parliament because of the poverty that's being imposed
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.400]  upon them, the money grabbed being taken from them and given to the banks, no, no that would
[11:00.400 --> 11:06.920]  have nothing to do with the depression, they only have 25% unemployment, officially over
[11:06.920 --> 11:14.520]  50% unemployment for the young people in the country, so the whole system is collapsing
[11:14.520 --> 11:20.880]  around the world, oh I forgot, the wars in Libya, you remember that humanitarian mission,
[11:20.880 --> 11:29.440]  hey I saw the commander in chief yucking it up with John Stuart, I didn't watch it, I
[11:29.440 --> 11:39.040]  only watched the clip, the commander in chief sitting on a cheap two-bit clown show talking
[11:39.040 --> 11:47.360]  about foreign policy, would you imagine Eisenhower sitting there, that's how low the bar has
[11:47.360 --> 11:55.880]  fallen in America and check it out, Obama says about Libya and the problems that they
[11:55.880 --> 12:04.560]  had, we're gonna fix it, oh yeah you're gonna fix it, hey just like you fixed it in Afghanistan
[12:04.560 --> 12:10.800]  with the 30,000 troops that you sent over there and what did they do, oh they got killed
[12:10.800 --> 12:16.600]  a lot of them, wiped out a lot of people, oh, oh, oh it didn't make the front page of
[12:16.600 --> 12:23.680]  the toilet paper of record yesterday, it was buried on page 12, they killed another three
[12:23.680 --> 12:32.400]  little Afghan children, but who cares, because it's the presidential reality show, so the
[12:32.400 --> 12:39.320]  whole thing is collapsing and what are they doing, they're distracting us at every moment,
[12:39.320 --> 12:45.800]  last week it was Big Bird, this week it's about Romney's binder and no one is speaking
[12:45.800 --> 12:53.760]  about the issues, both of these little boys are just going on all the talk shows, all
[12:53.760 --> 13:01.960]  the yucking it up, I love the way they laugh, they were criticizing Biden for his behavior
[13:01.960 --> 13:09.160]  when he was debating Ryan, you know, the Cheshire cat against the mouse, that's what it looked
[13:09.160 --> 13:21.040]  like to me and here's Biden, check it out, go to the, look at the dinner that Obama,
[13:21.040 --> 13:27.720]  the Al Smith dinner and Romney were out yesterday and you see the picture now, I used to work
[13:27.720 --> 13:35.240]  in politics, that's what they do, they're a bunch of phonies, it's always, and all the
[13:35.240 --> 13:42.080]  stooges around them laugh on cue, so it takes it to the bigger level about you talking about
[13:42.080 --> 13:48.600]  all these leaders in all these different positions that are leading us to destruction, it's the
[13:48.600 --> 13:56.080]  same in Germany with that Merkel, it's the same over there in Spain with Rajoy, it's
[13:56.080 --> 14:02.640]  the same over there in Italy with three cod Monty, it's the same everywhere, it's the
[14:02.640 --> 14:10.120]  club and they're destroying us and the big news today that, hey, we got to talk about
[14:10.120 --> 14:16.760]  Romney's binder, oh, oh, and I love the other one, his boy Tag, I love the names, Nick Tag,
[14:16.760 --> 14:23.080]  yeah, you're it, he was going to come down there swinging, oh yeah, swinging at Obama,
[14:23.080 --> 14:30.160]  what was he going to do, toss a swing at him, these guys never fought a day in their lives,
[14:30.160 --> 14:37.280]  oh, they are a big mouse, so it's not making the news, just a minor little story, eh, doesn't
[14:37.280 --> 14:47.000]  make much difference, they just did a deal yesterday, today, in Europe, in Brussels,
[14:47.000 --> 14:54.800]  it's happened, the banking systems have merged, they have now taken control, sovereign control
[14:54.800 --> 15:01.880]  over all of the banks throughout Europe and have now put it under the one bank in Brussels,
[15:01.880 --> 15:09.520]  now it's a new central bank, there is a new world order, now it's not the Illuminati,
[15:09.520 --> 15:16.240]  you don't have to go find it someplace hiding, it's in front of everybody's eyes, Alex,
[15:16.240 --> 15:21.640]  the new world order is the banking order, it's an old world order, they kind of try
[15:21.640 --> 15:26.520]  to cover it up, and they're covering it up again, this is not news that's making the
[15:26.520 --> 15:27.520]  news.
[15:27.520 --> 15:31.120]  And as you said, it's in the paper, but in the back of it, it's like, oh yeah, and
[15:31.120 --> 15:35.240]  now the country's all sovereignty will be given to the private bank, and that's the
[15:35.240 --> 15:38.920]  way it is, and we're going to take your taxes and pay it to foreign bankers and tell you
[15:38.920 --> 15:43.400]  how lazy you are, how's that sound, and they call it a world government and brag they've
[15:43.400 --> 15:48.520]  conquered us, and the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, as you know, Financial Times has reported,
[15:48.520 --> 15:54.400]  they just merged their holdings, so it's a global government, global merger happening
[15:54.400 --> 16:00.480]  right now, we'll be back with Gerald Salente, stay with us.
[16:00.480 --> 16:04.880]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest
[16:04.880 --> 16:10.280]  half year on record, 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions, not only corn,
[16:10.280 --> 16:15.000]  but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices, the
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.960]  cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[16:18.960 --> 16:24.280]  food prices, the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices
[16:24.280 --> 16:28.960]  by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now, as the price of raw ingredients

[18:40.960 --> 18:45.280]  the plastic, ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there, it's what my family

[19:00.000 --> 19:04.440]  Aaron Fullen here, as the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers,
[19:04.440 --> 19:08.560]  Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy
[19:08.560 --> 19:12.960]  home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt and kefir, it seems there's
[19:12.960 --> 19:17.320]  a war on life giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria, but frankly I'm not
[19:17.320 --> 19:20.880]  sure what the food police are so afraid of, these remarkable foods have been around since
[19:20.880 --> 19:24.480]  the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages
[19:24.480 --> 19:29.480]  being found across the globe in almost every culture, even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans
[19:29.480 --> 19:34.040]  eat fermented porches, Koreans eat kamichi and in India, fermented milk is a staple for
[19:34.040 --> 19:35.040]  healthy living.
[19:35.040 --> 19:38.840]  But here's some good news, self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these
[19:38.840 --> 19:43.040]  amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes, since it's still legal
[19:43.040 --> 19:45.680]  to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[19:45.680 --> 19:51.000]  For more information check out fermentationfactor.com, that's fermentationfactor.com, it's easy
[19:51.000 --> 19:56.760]  to create your own powerful fermented foods, and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com,
[19:56.760 --> 20:01.360]  that's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[20:01.360 --> 20:08.760]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:08.760 --> 20:22.400]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[20:22.400 --> 20:30.120]  Gerald Salente of the Trends Research Center, TrendsResearch.com, publisher of the Trends
[20:30.120 --> 20:36.640]  Journal, joins us, and I love the new cover of the new journal that just came out, it's
[20:36.640 --> 20:43.320]  a guy in a suit with a presidential looking tie, the dark suit with two heads, and the
[20:43.320 --> 20:47.400]  two headed ogre, of course, is Romney and Obama.
[20:47.400 --> 20:53.400]  And never before have there been so little differences between these two guys.
[20:53.400 --> 20:57.960]  Gerald, look, everything you saw coming many years ago, you know, been a bestselling author
[20:57.960 --> 21:01.760]  for several decades forecasting trends, I mean, I guess what is the number one New York
[21:01.760 --> 21:04.280]  Times bestseller before?
[21:04.280 --> 21:09.120]  You've really proven that you understand where things are going, because you've worked as
[21:09.120 --> 21:13.280]  a consultant, you've worked as a lobbyist, you've worked in government, you've been
[21:13.280 --> 21:17.200]  a successful author, you've done so many different things.
[21:17.200 --> 21:22.200]  Where do you see it going specifically now that so much of what you've broken down has
[21:22.200 --> 21:26.920]  now been accurate, fine-tuning or looking out into the future, more and more it looks
[21:26.920 --> 21:31.520]  like the really bad scenarios where we're going instead of just the, you know, nasty
[21:31.520 --> 21:37.880]  scenario, really bad, really serious, and you've got a general decadence and a lot of people.
[21:37.880 --> 21:43.680]  They're still hardworking, decent people that aren't criminals that are holding up society.
[21:43.680 --> 21:46.400]  Government is becoming more and more insane and unaccountable.
[21:46.400 --> 21:54.720]  I saw a case yesterday, in fact, guys, I printed it, you just type in child suspended iPad,
[21:54.720 --> 21:58.640]  and the children were suspended a bunch of them in the class, it was in the Huffington
[21:58.640 --> 22:04.680]  Post and their places, because the teachers' iPhones synced with the class iPads they had
[22:04.680 --> 22:08.520]  and saw her breath that she'd sent her boyfriend, and they said, well, you still shouldn't have
[22:08.520 --> 22:10.360]  seen it even though it's our fault.
[22:10.360 --> 22:11.920]  She's not in trouble, you're in trouble.
[22:11.920 --> 22:16.880]  Or here in Austin, the people call 911 because their husband, you know, the father's having
[22:16.880 --> 22:21.480]  a seizure, and cops get there first, they send a fire truck, you know, all this stuff
[22:21.480 --> 22:25.200]  now, and they get there and they go, stop having a seizure and start tasering him till
[22:25.200 --> 22:26.200]  he had a heart attack.
[22:26.200 --> 22:29.320]  That was unconscious, and they're not getting in trouble.
[22:29.320 --> 22:34.400]  I mean, I saw an article out of England where it was like an almost 80-year-old guy who
[22:34.400 --> 22:41.960]  had a stroke, no criminal record, a scientist with a white cane who's blind can barely walk,
[22:41.960 --> 22:45.760]  and the police didn't say halt, stop anything, they just tasered him.
[22:45.760 --> 22:49.560]  And they said, well, that's okay, I mean, it's a bunch of sadist and crazy people in
[22:49.560 --> 22:55.840]  charge now, they're pushing out any good people, and it's just getting crazier and crazier
[22:55.840 --> 23:00.440]  by the minute, and I just don't see where it's going to go from this point.
[23:00.440 --> 23:06.160]  I've seen other civilizations go through decadent cycles, they're nothing like this, this technology
[23:06.160 --> 23:10.520]  is going to allow fraud to go so much further, not against technology, but it does have that
[23:10.520 --> 23:16.480]  manifestation that, I mean, I just can't believe everything that we've basically broken down
[23:16.480 --> 23:22.240]  is so accurate, and that if there's any criticism of you or I and other experts we have on,
[23:22.240 --> 23:26.800]  because I have people on that are accurate and piercing and have records of being accurate,
[23:26.800 --> 23:33.840]  not establishment liars, but still, it's sick to be right, so I mean, you get the gist
[23:33.840 --> 23:36.800]  of what I'm saying, it's just a marvel at what we're witnessing.
[23:36.800 --> 23:41.880]  No, we've never seen anything like it, and again, I'm talking about, I call it the Presidential
[23:41.880 --> 23:49.360]  Reality Show, what American could be proud to be an American after watching these debates?
[23:49.360 --> 23:59.240]  This is it, an empty suit and a stuffed shirt, an emperor with no clothes, and a vulture
[23:59.240 --> 24:02.480]  capitalist that craves power?
[24:02.480 --> 24:09.680]  Listen to what Eisenhower said, that any man that seeks the presidency is either an egomaniac
[24:09.680 --> 24:11.480]  or crazy.
[24:11.480 --> 24:18.480]  You don't seek this, you like George Washington, they want you, you don't go see the president,
[24:18.480 --> 24:22.400]  you want you, you don't go seek it, Rami's been running forever.
[24:22.400 --> 24:24.920]  Is Obama really playing president?
[24:24.920 --> 24:31.120]  I mean, this cat's out there with his sleeves rolled up every damn day doing a campaign
[24:31.120 --> 24:32.120]  gig.
[24:32.120 --> 24:36.400]  You and I know, we're running businesses, you can't do this, who the hell's running
[24:36.400 --> 24:37.400]  a show?
[24:37.400 --> 24:41.520]  You've got a whole country to run, and this guy's on the campaign trail.
[24:41.520 --> 24:46.760]  It's so serious, but people refuse to see it for what it is.
[24:46.760 --> 24:52.080]  As I mentioned, when you looked at that debate, that so-called debate the other night, and
[24:52.080 --> 25:00.120]  look at all of the coverage, all it was about, Obama came out swinging, it was bitter from
[25:00.120 --> 25:05.280]  the beginning, and biting, and blah, blah, blah, but how about the policies?
[25:05.280 --> 25:07.000]  What did they talk about?
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.760]  What did they say that it was going to do?
[25:09.760 --> 25:14.320]  And there's not a dime's worth of difference, I can make a point to prove it.
[25:14.320 --> 25:19.920]  Rami comes out and says, more clean coal, oh, clean coal, great.
[25:19.920 --> 25:21.920]  That's like being almost pregnant, isn't it?
[25:21.920 --> 25:29.280]  I got more fracking, and Obama hasn't opened up enough public lands, I'm going to open
[25:29.280 --> 25:31.320]  it up for more fracking.
[25:31.320 --> 25:37.400]  Oh, and more opening up of those pristine areas for drilling, and get that pipeline
[25:37.400 --> 25:41.720]  running down there from the tar sands through Canada.
[25:41.720 --> 25:43.600]  What does Obama do?
[25:43.600 --> 25:46.000]  He one ups him.
[25:46.000 --> 25:54.440]  He kills out Rami for closing down a coal burning plant when he was governor of Massachusetts.
[25:54.440 --> 25:56.440]  So this is what we have.
[25:56.440 --> 26:01.560]  When it comes to more war, each one talks tougher than the other.
[26:01.560 --> 26:07.800]  So when you're saying where is the nation going, it's right in front of us.
[26:07.800 --> 26:15.440]  It's going down the crapper by two little boys that try to play tough out there on the
[26:15.440 --> 26:21.480]  stage that couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag.
[26:21.480 --> 26:28.480]  And this fat mouth Rami, I've had it with him talking about bombing this country, bombing
[26:28.480 --> 26:36.840]  that country, while Rami spent two years running away from the draft in Vietnam, missionary
[26:36.840 --> 26:39.960]  mitt in France.
[26:39.960 --> 26:47.920]  Imagine being a Mormon missionary in wine, drinking, cigarette smoking, caffeine addicted,
[26:47.920 --> 26:50.720]  Bridget Bardot loving France.
[26:50.720 --> 26:55.520]  No wonder why he got punched out when he was over there, and he did.
[26:55.520 --> 27:01.560]  So here's a draft dodger, and telling us what we should do.
[27:01.560 --> 27:03.960]  By the way, here's my, oh, and Obama.
[27:03.960 --> 27:08.000]  I love when Obama goes into commander in chief mode.
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.200]  Twice he reminded us, I got Osama bin Laden.
[27:13.200 --> 27:15.920]  And by the way, who is this guy Al-Qaeda?
[27:15.920 --> 27:19.360]  I thought Al-Qaeda was dead after they got Osama.
[27:19.360 --> 27:20.880]  Well, tell me where Al-Qaeda is.
[27:20.880 --> 27:23.960]  They're putting him into Syria and Libya, and that's my question.
[27:23.960 --> 27:26.600]  Rami saying, hey, we're going to get you, Russia.
[27:26.600 --> 27:28.960]  Our troops are in a proxy war in Syria.
[27:28.960 --> 27:30.560]  That's now admitted.
[27:30.560 --> 27:34.240]  Playing with Al-Qaeda, even the New York Times, months after it was out, admitted it
[27:34.240 --> 27:35.240]  this Monday.
[27:35.240 --> 27:37.680]  So now it's true, kind of like when Sticklet says it's a depression.
[27:37.680 --> 27:42.720]  Well, now, oh my gosh, it's true, because they say so, because they control reality.
[27:42.720 --> 27:49.040]  But I mean, the craziness of our troops fighting by Al-Qaeda in Syria, and then Hillary says,
[27:49.040 --> 27:53.040]  we've got to go into Syria, they're Al-Qaeda, and we've got to go into Iran.
[27:53.040 --> 27:54.040]  They're Al-Qaeda.
[27:54.040 --> 27:58.240]  Knowing Iran is Shiite, arch enemies of Al-Qaeda, I'm not defending Iran.
[27:58.240 --> 28:01.440]  They just, they talk to us because they know Gerald.
[28:01.440 --> 28:05.760]  The general public doesn't know how to find their butt with both hands.
[28:05.760 --> 28:06.760]  You got it.
[28:06.760 --> 28:07.760]  You got it.
[28:07.760 --> 28:08.760]  And that's what they do.
[28:08.760 --> 28:09.760]  So where is it going?
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.760]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[28:14.760 --> 28:19.760]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[28:19.760 --> 28:25.600]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[28:25.600 --> 28:32.600]  Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[28:32.600 --> 28:43.600]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed, the poor stay poor, the rich get rich, that's how it
[28:43.600 --> 28:45.600]  goes.
[28:45.600 --> 28:50.600]  Everybody knows.
[28:50.600 --> 28:55.600]  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking.
[28:55.600 --> 29:00.600]  Everybody knows the Captain Lion.

[31:00.200 --> 31:04.600]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest
[31:04.600 --> 31:06.000]  half year on record.
[31:06.000 --> 31:09.120]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[31:09.120 --> 31:14.720]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[31:14.720 --> 31:18.720]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[31:18.720 --> 31:19.720]  food prices.
[31:19.720 --> 31:24.360]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting
[31:24.360 --> 31:27.360]  your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now.
[31:27.360 --> 31:31.240]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have to raise prices too.

[31:32.880 --> 31:36.640]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we have all known this was
[31:36.640 --> 31:37.640]  coming.

[31:44.080 --> 31:47.440]  years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.

[33:05.120 --> 33:09.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:09.120 --> 33:22.760]  Oh, this is the other thing where I have a real beef.
[33:22.760 --> 33:28.880]  They're spending this baloney nothing moronic presidential reality show.
[33:28.880 --> 33:34.960]  They're spending 2.5 billion, billion with a B, in advertising.
[33:34.960 --> 33:37.840]  You know where the advertising is going?
[33:37.840 --> 33:39.760]  That's to pay the prostitutes.
[33:39.760 --> 33:43.080]  You pay the prostitutes to do your dirty work.
[33:43.080 --> 33:46.600]  So here we have the prostitutes.
[33:46.600 --> 33:54.960]  Whether it's the guy Lear or Candy Crowley or the last one, we had an A come up with
[33:54.960 --> 34:00.760]  I forgot the questions and I decide what I'm going to ask.
[34:00.760 --> 34:04.200]  Hey, how about the rest of us?
[34:04.200 --> 34:05.200]  What do you mean?
[34:05.200 --> 34:07.160]  Hey, don't talk mad about Alex Crowley.
[34:07.160 --> 34:09.240]  He's got a lot of followers.
[34:09.240 --> 34:10.240]  What?
[34:10.240 --> 34:11.240]  I'm calling her Alex Crowley.
[34:11.240 --> 34:13.280]  No, I mean it's ridiculous.
[34:13.280 --> 34:14.640]  It's ridiculous.
[34:14.640 --> 34:16.280]  Here they are, Alex.
[34:16.280 --> 34:19.560]  The networks are running the campaigns.
[34:19.560 --> 34:21.280]  Let's get this straight.
[34:21.280 --> 34:23.920]  They're getting all the money to run the ads.
[34:23.920 --> 34:27.040]  All the debates are being run by the networks.
[34:27.040 --> 34:29.680]  They used to be the debates.
[34:29.680 --> 34:32.800]  Most people are too young to remember.
[34:32.800 --> 34:36.760]  They used to be run by the League of Women Voters.
[34:36.760 --> 34:37.760]  That's right.
[34:37.760 --> 34:42.760]  Before the Democratic and Republican Mafia took it over.
[34:42.760 --> 34:46.360]  This is just a stage two bitch show.
[34:46.360 --> 34:48.720]  They're delivering nothing.
[34:48.720 --> 34:51.440]  Nothing of substance comes out of these.
[34:51.440 --> 34:53.800]  Again, it's the same campaign rhetoric.
[34:53.800 --> 34:54.800]  So where's it going?
[34:54.800 --> 34:56.440]  I mentioned the rise in crime.
[34:56.440 --> 34:58.800]  It's up 18%.
[34:58.800 --> 35:01.360]  Violent crime is up 18%.
[35:01.360 --> 35:05.360]  How about the new housing numbers that came out today?
[35:05.360 --> 35:08.360]  It down almost 2%.
[35:08.360 --> 35:13.400]  You look at the unemployment numbers that you keep mentioning and just mention.
[35:13.400 --> 35:14.680]  They readjusted them.
[35:14.680 --> 35:16.600]  They went back up again.
[35:16.600 --> 35:25.080]  You're looking, what about 388,000 people a week, a week going on unemployment?
[35:25.080 --> 35:28.040]  You look at one issue after the other.
[35:28.040 --> 35:29.880]  There is no recovery.
[35:29.880 --> 35:30.920]  It's a cover up.
[35:30.920 --> 35:33.280]  So now let's see what else is going on.
[35:33.280 --> 35:35.040]  Oh, isn't it great?
[35:35.040 --> 35:37.840]  They have China and Japan fighting each other.
[35:37.840 --> 35:40.080]  Hey, sound familiar?
[35:40.080 --> 35:44.440]  Couldn't be because the United States is opening up bases over there in Australia.
[35:44.440 --> 35:49.560]  They've announced that they're after being defeated in Afghanistan and Iraq, destabilizing
[35:49.560 --> 35:50.560]  the Middle East.
[35:50.560 --> 35:52.000]  Hey, let's take on China.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.320]  They got thousands of nukes and a billion, 300 million people.
[35:55.320 --> 35:57.400]  Let's start a fight with them.
[35:57.400 --> 35:58.400]  Exactly.
[35:58.400 --> 36:00.120]  We failed over there.
[36:00.120 --> 36:02.240]  Let's fail real big.
[36:02.240 --> 36:07.760]  Let's get Japan our little proxy puppet over there and have them steal a two bit
[36:07.760 --> 36:13.120]  island, say that they paid for it so they could start clashing between each other.
[36:13.120 --> 36:15.280]  And boy, this thing's coming down big.
[36:15.280 --> 36:17.640]  The Chinese aren't letting it go away.
[36:17.640 --> 36:21.840]  And think of the stupidity of the psychopaths.
[36:21.840 --> 36:24.920]  China is one of Japan's biggest markets.
[36:24.920 --> 36:28.480]  Now the people in China aren't buying Japanese stuff.
[36:28.480 --> 36:32.040]  And remember what I said, and you see it happening.
[36:32.040 --> 36:37.880]  The crash of 29, the panic of 08, same.
[36:37.880 --> 36:40.400]  The panics fall followed by depression.
[36:40.400 --> 36:41.400]  We're in a depression.
[36:41.400 --> 36:44.480]  Oh, even Stiglitz says it now.
[36:44.480 --> 36:52.600]  Currency wars listen to the head of the financial head of the Brazilian government, the finance
[36:52.600 --> 36:54.480]  minister, Montega.
[36:54.480 --> 36:56.360]  We're in a currency war.
[36:56.360 --> 37:01.240]  The United States, Europe, China, they're all devaluing their currencies.
[37:01.240 --> 37:05.760]  China just lowered interest rates twice in the last week and a half.
[37:05.760 --> 37:09.600]  They're flooding money into the system to prop it up.
[37:09.600 --> 37:16.440]  Currency wars, same thing, panic of 08, crash of 29, depression, currency wars, trade wars.
[37:16.440 --> 37:23.800]  You hear Mittens and you hear Obama bashing China, the trade wars are heating up.
[37:23.800 --> 37:28.920]  World War, how many more pieces have to be put together?
[37:28.920 --> 37:32.080]  You talked about what's going on in Spain, what's going on in Greece, what's going on
[37:32.080 --> 37:38.360]  in Portugal, millions of people are taking to the streets in desperation.
[37:38.360 --> 37:39.440]  They have nothing.
[37:39.440 --> 37:40.440]  They have nothing.
[37:40.440 --> 37:44.760]  Oh, and this banking deal that was just done in Brussels, you know what the European stability
[37:44.760 --> 37:48.800]  mechanism means in outside of white shoe boy language?
[37:48.800 --> 37:49.800]  It's very simple.
[37:49.800 --> 37:53.440]  We're going to tax you more, we're going to cut your pensions, your benefits, we're
[37:53.440 --> 37:57.400]  going to raise your retirement age till after you die, we're going to take every penny that
[37:57.400 --> 38:03.120]  you have, we're going to buy worthless bonds with the money, oh, and we're going to deposit
[38:03.120 --> 38:08.240]  it directly into the accounts of the bankers and we're going to pay an interest for the
[38:08.240 --> 38:09.800]  money they lost in between.
[38:09.800 --> 38:14.280]  Yeah, so we bail, I mean explain that slowly though, we bail out the mega banks, the media
[38:14.280 --> 38:19.680]  tells us we're lazy and that we're in debt, 90 plus percent of the money goes directly
[38:19.680 --> 38:24.480]  to the bankers who then bail us out but then the money goes back to them because we bailed
[38:24.480 --> 38:31.720]  them out, it's fraud within fraud within fraud, it makes Bernie Madoff look like a saint and
[38:31.720 --> 38:36.480]  the general public doesn't care because they think Al Qaeda is hiding in their underwear.
[38:36.480 --> 38:38.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[38:38.120 --> 38:44.400]  And then when you, and then keep piling onto that one, and then we heard the grand madame
[38:44.400 --> 38:47.280]  Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF.
[38:47.280 --> 38:52.080]  You're not working hard enough, you scumbag people in grace, enough of your kids aren't
[38:52.080 --> 38:56.560]  starving to death, your tourism hasn't imploded enough, give me more money, you need to work
[38:56.560 --> 38:58.840]  six, seven days a week.
[38:58.840 --> 39:05.240]  And pay your taxes as she doesn't pay a penny in taxes.
[39:05.240 --> 39:10.320]  Oh, because the EU wrote the rules where the bureaucrats don't pay taxes, just like the
[39:10.320 --> 39:14.080]  big banks don't pay taxes, oh.
[39:14.080 --> 39:19.120]  You use the word by the way, also in the debate, the issues that they talked about, none of
[39:19.120 --> 39:24.800]  the major issues, and you just use the word, so now I can say it.
[39:24.800 --> 39:28.960]  What they talked about in that last debate, so much about gun control, people have no
[39:28.960 --> 39:32.960]  jobs, they're losing their homes, elderly people can't pay their property taxes, school
[39:32.960 --> 39:36.200]  taxes, they're throwing them out of their houses, they're taking them.
[39:36.200 --> 39:40.600]  Kids are going to college, 50% of them are getting out, they're taking, they get to jobs,
[39:40.600 --> 39:45.240]  have jobs that are paying high school level wages, these are facts.
[39:45.240 --> 39:47.640]  And we know what they're talking about, gun control.
[39:47.640 --> 39:51.680]  Let's talk about 20 minutes on gun control and contraception.
[39:51.680 --> 39:58.200]  And I realized why Obama and Romney spoke so much about contraception, because the word
[39:58.200 --> 40:02.640]  you just used, both of them are scumbags.
[40:02.640 --> 40:06.200]  That's what they talk about, none of the big issues.
[40:06.200 --> 40:11.160]  So as we're looking around the world and what's going on, we're at war, there's a war in
[40:11.160 --> 40:16.080]  Yemen, a war in Bahrain, Syria, they destroyed Syria.
[40:16.080 --> 40:19.760]  And who's destroying it, the United States and the Arab Little League.
[40:19.760 --> 40:24.960]  And by the way, IMF is International Mafia Federation, that's what it is.
[40:24.960 --> 40:28.600]  They take your money, they're the loan sharks, the last resort.
[40:28.600 --> 40:33.640]  Then you have, as I mentioned, all the other wars going on, they're taking us to war, you
[40:33.640 --> 40:39.240]  keep talking about it over and over again, how they grope us, how they surveil us, how
[40:39.240 --> 40:45.920]  they demean us, how they keep pushing us down so we have no dignity, courage, respect
[40:45.920 --> 40:49.680]  or integrity left and bow to their wishes.
[40:49.680 --> 40:51.320]  That's what's going on.
[40:51.320 --> 40:57.400]  It's in front of everyone's eyes, but no one wants to call a spade a spade.
[40:57.400 --> 40:59.280]  And it's building towards the crescendo now.
[40:59.280 --> 41:03.960]  I mean, they're rolling out the trips on the streets, the TSA, and the forced inoculations
[41:03.960 --> 41:06.200]  of kids that's totally illegal all over the country.
[41:06.200 --> 41:08.280]  They're just shooting kids out at public schools.
[41:08.280 --> 41:11.520]  I mean, government has put out the green light, they're not going to get in trouble
[41:11.520 --> 41:13.080]  for fast and furious.
[41:13.080 --> 41:17.000]  They've just put the green light out, hey, it's time to just go crazy.
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.000]  Yeah.
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.600]  And oh, nobody gets, you haven't seen any heads roll on Wall Street.
[41:22.600 --> 41:23.600]  I love it.
[41:23.600 --> 41:26.800]  They're all talking about what has to be done on, they have a free hand.
[41:26.800 --> 41:34.560]  Oh, and by the way, one of the reasons that's given why John the slime cause line was never
[41:34.560 --> 41:40.160]  even brought in for questioning, besides him being a bundler for Obama, besides him being
[41:40.160 --> 41:45.600]  the former CEO of the Goldman Sachs gang, besides him being the senator and governor
[41:45.600 --> 41:57.560]  of New Jersey, the same law firm that represents MF global is the white collar law syndicate,
[41:57.560 --> 42:00.200]  one of the top ones in the country.
[42:00.200 --> 42:02.960]  And you know who used to work there?
[42:02.960 --> 42:05.040]  It's such a surprise.
[42:05.040 --> 42:08.520]  Eric Holder, our attorney.
[42:08.520 --> 42:16.880]  Yeah, couldn't be no, how dare you insinuate that he's a good man.
[42:16.880 --> 42:17.880]  Yeah.
[42:17.880 --> 42:22.960]  And just because they're doing business with MF global, and that's the law firm that he
[42:22.960 --> 42:23.960]  came from.
[42:23.960 --> 42:25.920]  The whole thing is one club.
[42:25.920 --> 42:27.800]  It's not a revolving door.
[42:27.800 --> 42:29.240]  It's one door.
[42:29.240 --> 42:30.760]  It's the banking door.
[42:30.760 --> 42:36.560]  Hey, you know that cover that we had on the trends journal that got so much popularity
[42:36.560 --> 42:39.160]  that wonderful Anthony Frieda cover.
[42:39.160 --> 42:41.160]  Yes, we'll punch it up.
[42:41.160 --> 42:42.160]  Right.
[42:42.160 --> 42:43.680]  Whipping the money changes that of the temple.
[42:43.680 --> 42:45.200]  Think about it, Alex.
[42:45.200 --> 43:00.800]  This has been going on as old as civilization.
[43:00.800 --> 43:03.520]  Cold and flu season is upon us.
[43:03.520 --> 43:09.600]  Protect yourself with supernatural silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial.
[43:09.600 --> 43:13.720]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be
[43:13.720 --> 43:19.760]  used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold and food poisoning, as well as help improve
[43:19.760 --> 43:21.280]  wound healing.
[43:21.280 --> 43:26.240]  Silver salt technology is safe enough to consume every day while powerful enough to destroy
[43:26.240 --> 43:32.440]  the causes of many serious diseases like strep throat, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus and other
[43:32.440 --> 43:34.160]  harmful pathogens.
[43:34.160 --> 43:38.880]  This new technology is much more effective than colloidal or ionic silvers and has the
[43:38.880 --> 43:45.160]  ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness
[43:45.160 --> 43:47.600]  of older solutions.

[44:59.960 --> 45:04.360]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest
[45:04.360 --> 45:05.600]  half year on record.
[45:05.600 --> 45:09.120]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[45:09.120 --> 45:14.440]  Not only corn but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[45:14.440 --> 45:17.920]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business.
[45:17.920 --> 45:19.400]  Blowing up your food prices.
[45:19.400 --> 45:24.040]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting
[45:24.040 --> 45:27.000]  your own supply of foods from eFoods direct now.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.880]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[45:30.880 --> 45:32.560]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[45:32.560 --> 45:36.200]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods direct because we have all known this was
[45:36.200 --> 45:37.200]  coming.
[45:37.200 --> 45:39.560]  You know about their delicious long term storeable foods.
[45:39.560 --> 45:44.080]  The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today and because it stores for 25 years
[45:44.080 --> 45:47.120]  you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[45:47.120 --> 45:48.120]  Don't wait.

[45:59.680 --> 46:00.720]  Aaron Fullen here.
[46:00.720 --> 46:04.720]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are
[46:04.720 --> 46:09.360]  losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy home crafted sources
[46:09.360 --> 46:12.280]  for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt and kefir.
[46:12.280 --> 46:16.400]  It seems there's a war on life giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[46:16.400 --> 46:19.160]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[46:19.160 --> 46:22.640]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological
[46:22.640 --> 46:26.560]  evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[46:26.560 --> 46:27.560]  culture.
[46:27.560 --> 46:31.800]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi and
[46:31.800 --> 46:34.840]  in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[46:34.840 --> 46:36.000]  But here's some good news.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.520]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented
[46:39.520 --> 46:42.240]  foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[46:42.240 --> 46:45.480]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[46:45.480 --> 46:50.360]  For more information check out fermentationfactor.com, that's fermentationfactor.com.
[46:50.360 --> 46:56.560]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods, and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[46:56.560 --> 47:25.840]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[47:26.560 --> 47:51.040]  So we're here, we're live, a very upsetting interview with David Ike.
[47:51.040 --> 47:56.600]  It's painful because so much of what he's getting into with Jerry Sandusky and other
[47:56.600 --> 48:01.320]  top BBC, you know, hosts and people caught in giant pedophile networks, connected to
[48:01.320 --> 48:05.680]  the royal family, mainstream news, I mean it's just confirming everything, Prince Charles
[48:05.680 --> 48:11.400]  saying basically he's Dracula reincarnated, I mean it's just all, it's way too crazy.
[48:11.400 --> 48:13.240]  And it's all right there.
[48:13.240 --> 48:20.440]  And you've got this Jimmy Savelle, the guy that helped children in England who was an
[48:20.440 --> 48:26.440]  obvious pervert, weirdo, said, called the kids a little slave, sorted boast, the dark
[48:26.440 --> 48:32.440]  truth about friend Jimmy Savelle by the biographer who tried to unmask him and now it's all coming
[48:32.440 --> 48:33.440]  out.
[48:33.440 --> 48:40.880]  It just absolutely blows me away that we've let evil people get in the positions of power.
[48:40.880 --> 48:45.640]  That's why you end up getting human sacrifice in every culture, it's because the very, very
[48:45.640 --> 48:50.920]  worse to get into control and they just seek to do absolutely horrible things.
[48:50.920 --> 48:55.240]  And now all the wars and the torture and the secret arrest and the warrantless wire
[48:55.240 --> 48:58.880]  tapping and the, all of it coming to a head.
[48:58.880 --> 49:02.960]  By the way, we covered the headline yesterday, Joseph Stiglitz has come out, the Nobel Prize
[49:02.960 --> 49:04.560]  winner and said Europe's in a depression.
[49:04.560 --> 49:09.720]  I thought Gerald Salenta and I were pessimist porn dealers for pointing out this was happening.
[49:09.720 --> 49:14.800]  So more and more of it is all admitted and they're really gearing up towards Iran.
[49:14.800 --> 49:18.320]  They've cut off the Iranian cable network in Europe.
[49:18.320 --> 49:21.360]  All the previous saber rattling, that didn't happen.
[49:21.360 --> 49:26.160]  So that's a big sign and you've got the big proxy war to bring down Syria.
[49:26.160 --> 49:27.160]  Then they go into Iran.
[49:27.160 --> 49:28.720]  That's always been the plan.
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.160]  It looks like we're headed into very serious times, whether it's this year or early next
[49:32.160 --> 49:39.320]  year, it'll all and basically implode by April, but you could have cities burning and, you
[49:39.320 --> 49:40.320]  know, whatever.
[49:40.320 --> 49:45.080]  And then the news would say, you know, unemployment's at 0% and government loves you and everything's
[49:45.080 --> 49:46.080]  fine.
[49:46.080 --> 49:47.080]  This is the greatest time of your life.
[49:47.080 --> 49:49.760]  I mean, they could be lowering your dead kid into a coffin in the ground and they'd
[49:49.760 --> 49:54.520]  say, look, your child's dancing beautifully, you know, it's just, just all pure lies shoveled
[49:54.520 --> 49:55.520]  at us.
[49:55.520 --> 50:01.800]  An empire of lies by a bunch of control freaks and Jerry Sandusky types running around having
[50:01.800 --> 50:02.800]  their way with us.
[50:02.800 --> 50:04.720]  I mean, I personally have had enough.
[50:04.720 --> 50:10.120]  I personally have had enough on so many fronts that I don't even know, you know, what to
[50:10.120 --> 50:11.120]  say anymore.
[50:11.120 --> 50:13.600]  It's just over the top and we're going to be talking with Gerald Salento.
[50:13.600 --> 50:28.720]  He's been gracious enough to join us coming up in a moment.
[50:28.720 --> 50:36.200]  I'm a jolly banker or the bankers lament, you can call it either one you want to.
[50:36.200 --> 50:46.840]  And let's see here how that goes when I'm trying to sing you that.
[50:46.840 --> 50:58.680]  My name is Tom Cranker and I'm a jolly banker, I'm a jolly banker, jolly banker, am I?
[50:58.680 --> 51:16.320]  When the storms are sealing and the crops they are feeling, I'm a jolly banker, jolly
[51:16.320 --> 51:20.360]  banker, am I?
[51:20.360 --> 51:31.360]  I check up your shortage and bring down your mortgage, saying I'm a jolly banker, jolly
[51:31.360 --> 51:32.360]  banker, am I?
[51:32.360 --> 51:38.360]  When money you're needing and mouths you are feeding, I'm jolly banker, jolly banker,
[51:38.360 --> 51:40.360]  am I?
[51:40.360 --> 51:46.360]  Gerald, is that the song you're talking about, jolly banker?
[51:46.360 --> 51:52.360]  Christ for President is the song.
[51:52.360 --> 51:55.080]  That's the name of the song, Christ for President.
[51:55.080 --> 51:58.440]  Christ for President, well we'll find that one.
[51:58.440 --> 52:04.640]  This is Woody Guthrie, jolly banker, but we'll find Christ for President and play that later.
[52:04.640 --> 52:08.920]  Gerald, continuing here, there's so much to talk about.
[52:08.920 --> 52:11.960]  What's your take on the Iran thing, I mean how fast that could happen?
[52:11.960 --> 52:16.280]  I guess they want to get Syria out of the way and get al-Qaeda in charge there and then
[52:16.280 --> 52:19.520]  I guess in a year after that they'll be bombing Syria again to get rid of the al-Qaeda they
[52:19.520 --> 52:20.520]  put in.
[52:20.520 --> 52:21.520]  That's already started in Libya.
[52:21.520 --> 52:25.280]  I mean where do you see this military madness going?
[52:25.280 --> 52:27.520]  Well it's again, it's World War III.
[52:27.520 --> 52:28.680]  Will they attack Iran?
[52:28.680 --> 52:35.160]  I don't know, who knows, but as I say if they do our lives won't be worth anything anymore
[52:35.160 --> 52:40.800]  because you know how they say Alex that generals always fight the last war?
[52:40.800 --> 52:41.800]  Yes.
[52:41.800 --> 52:45.000]  They're doing it again, they're fighting the last war.
[52:45.000 --> 52:49.520]  If there's a war against Iran, these are the Persians, there's 70 million of them, very
[52:49.520 --> 52:50.520]  intelligent people.
[52:50.520 --> 52:56.600]  This is in Iraq with 26 million people in a very different country, this is a very sophisticated
[52:56.600 --> 52:57.600]  society.
[52:57.600 --> 53:04.400]  You're going to see, when I wrote Trends 2000 back in 1996, I wrote about all the weapons
[53:04.400 --> 53:09.880]  of mass destruction, all the suitcase size nukes that were being sold on the black market
[53:09.880 --> 53:16.160]  when the Soviet Union fell apart, they're still out there and they're more sophisticated.
[53:16.160 --> 53:23.080]  So the next war is going to go, boom goes London, boom parry, you're going to see suitcase
[53:23.080 --> 53:29.040]  size nukes blowing off, you're going to see dirty bombs, you're going to see weapons
[53:29.040 --> 53:34.240]  of mass destruction, biological warfare, it's going to be uncontrollable.
[53:34.240 --> 53:40.600]  Gerald, if you were on national TV, which isn't what it used to be, the ratings have
[53:40.600 --> 53:45.960]  dropped, but let's say you were talking to millions of people, which you are, but folks
[53:45.960 --> 53:49.400]  that weren't informed, what would you say in the five minutes we have left?
[53:49.400 --> 53:54.000]  What would you say to them about changing the direction we're going or where it's going
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.520]  if we don't change it?
[53:56.520 --> 54:00.880]  I will say that, but I just want to finish that thought I had to say about the big deal
[54:00.880 --> 54:07.440]  when the ambassador gets killed, when Sergeant Rodriguez gets blown up and gets killed by
[54:07.440 --> 54:14.200]  a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, when Tammy White gets her brains blown out by a sniper
[54:14.200 --> 54:22.880]  in Afghanistan, when somebody else, you know, Michael Smith, the lieutenant, he gets killed
[54:22.880 --> 54:31.200]  by a rocket-propelled grenade, the president, the secretary of state, nobody shows up, they
[54:31.200 --> 54:37.680]  don't even show the coffins on TV, but when the ambassador gets killed, boy, oh, boy,
[54:37.680 --> 54:43.680]  the whole crew comes out, the world stops, the embassies are all, but when anything
[54:43.680 --> 54:47.360]  happens to us, it doesn't matter.
[54:47.360 --> 54:52.000]  And I'm saying that because it leads into your next question, what could change it?
[54:52.000 --> 54:57.680]  The whole system is built upon making them look better than you or me.
[54:57.680 --> 55:03.960]  And what I say to everyone right now, that the only way that the change is going to come
[55:03.960 --> 55:07.040]  is when you make the change.
[55:07.040 --> 55:09.480]  It has to start with the individual.
[55:09.480 --> 55:11.800]  We all have unique gifts.
[55:11.800 --> 55:13.880]  You have yours, they're a parent.
[55:13.880 --> 55:19.360]  And everybody has to rise up to keep making your unique gift greater and greater.
[55:19.360 --> 55:24.400]  I have a friend of mine, Sonny Rollins, the great jazz saxophonist, he's in his 80s.
[55:24.400 --> 55:29.800]  He gave me a quote from one of my books when Zizi gave Honey Boy, he practices every day.
[55:29.800 --> 55:33.560]  He practices every day getting better at his trade.
[55:33.560 --> 55:35.480]  You don't hope for things to happen.
[55:35.480 --> 55:39.400]  I say this because we're in this campaign cycle that's ending.
[55:39.400 --> 55:42.840]  We're going to be left with a choice of a lesser of two evils.
[55:42.840 --> 55:47.240]  And I'm saying I don't go out with evils, I don't deal with evils, I don't do business
[55:47.240 --> 55:49.320]  with evils, I don't hang out with evils.
[55:49.320 --> 55:53.440]  Why would I vote for an evil to run my life or run my country?
[55:53.440 --> 56:01.840]  So I'm saying that because people don't have the belief that they are as least good as
[56:01.840 --> 56:03.200]  their leaders.
[56:03.200 --> 56:06.080]  So I suggest this.
[56:06.080 --> 56:17.880]  If Clinton can, if Bush can, if Obama can, and Romney can, then you can, and I can, unless
[56:17.880 --> 56:22.360]  of course, you think that their mother's better than yours.
[56:22.360 --> 56:27.760]  So speaking for myself, they're not superior to me.
[56:27.760 --> 56:35.400]  They're red carpets, all saluting, I salute, I got one for you, save it, you're not better
[56:35.400 --> 56:39.520]  than me and your mother's not better than mine.
[56:39.520 --> 56:43.600]  Let's just call it equal so this doesn't get out of hand.
[56:43.600 --> 56:50.360]  So people have to find within themselves to stop buying into the baloney, raise themselves
[56:50.360 --> 56:56.360]  to the highest levels because when the collective consciousness changes, Alex to me that's the
[56:56.360 --> 56:57.360]  only way it changes.
[56:57.360 --> 56:58.360]  No, no, I agree.
[56:58.360 --> 57:02.280]  It's these so-called elites that are dragging us down and they know it, they're just willing
[57:02.280 --> 57:06.120]  to do horrible things that normal good virtuous people aren't.
[57:06.120 --> 57:09.520]  They have desires that we don't have, they're like cancer.
[57:09.520 --> 57:14.440]  Like you said, they're anti-team humanity and it's time to stop bowing down to them,
[57:14.440 --> 57:17.400]  it's time to get in their face and tell them they're scum and filth.
[57:17.400 --> 57:18.400]  I do that.
[57:18.400 --> 57:20.640]  In fact, my mother, my mother's a lot better than them.
[57:20.640 --> 57:24.480]  I don't come from inbred parasites that suck off people.
[57:24.480 --> 57:25.760]  My mother's better than theirs.
[57:25.760 --> 57:30.320]  Well, I was just trying to keep it equal, you're not trying to mean, you know, of course,
[57:30.320 --> 57:31.840]  what do you think their mother could cook?
[57:31.840 --> 57:36.040]  Now, I mean, these globalists come from a bunch of murdering inbred scum most of them,
[57:36.040 --> 57:37.440]  their mothers were pigs.
[57:37.440 --> 57:43.400]  All right, hey, Gerald Salente, you're awesome, Trends Journal, everybody can find out more

[57:49.640 --> 57:50.640]  Thank you so much.

[59:51.600 --> 01:00:16.000]  We are joined by the one the only, George Norrie, who is nipping at Rush Limbaugh's
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  heels.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.400]  Not that we're against Rush Limbaugh overall, it's just that it's interesting that he's
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:25.760]  been the reigning king of talk radio here in the U.S. and worldwide for more than 20
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:32.160]  years, and now here comes George Norrie overnights with Coast to Coast AM, which is a timer you've
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:37.080]  got generally about 10 percent of the regular audience, but he's almost got as many listeners
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:41.600]  as Rush Limbaugh now as fighting an uphill battle at night when there's about 10 percent
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.880]  of the listeners.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:48.440]  He is still absolutely kicking butt because, well, he's got the courage to bring crazy people.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:53.720]  Someone would say like me on 9 years ago, hard to believe it's now been 9 years since
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:58.920]  George Norrie first brought Alex Jones on the show, and, you know, of all the people
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:03.040]  that have helped Infowars.com, which was already reaching millions of people with the films
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.520]  in my little syndicated radio show, probably on 30-something stations when George first
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.320]  had me on it, a little more than that, to where we are today.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.120]  If people ask who really gave you a break, it's George Norrie.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.120]  It is George Norrie.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.800]  If you've been on the last five years or so, Matt Drudge, the number one sensation when
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:26.200]  it comes to internet news worldwide, he has really helped get us out as well, but George
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:32.040]  Norrie and Matt Drudge, and of course, right in between that overall, you the listeners
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:37.560]  spread the word, you're the reason we're able to do this and have now 10 reporters and 50-plus
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:43.360]  crew members and reaching 15 million people a week on internet and talk radio and through
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.360]  films.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:48.920]  George Norrie reaches 16 to 20 million a week just on terrestrial radio and tens of millions
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.880]  overall every month on the internet, and it is just such an honor that he would spend
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:58.600]  an hour and a half or so with us tonight, and he said, hey, I want to take calls, Alex.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.640]  So come out in about 30, 40 minutes, we'll give the number out and take your calls on
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.640]  any subject.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.640]  I said, what do you want to cover?
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.640]  And he said, hey, everything.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:11.320]  He goes, I'm concerned about this prepper confirmed to be banned to fly because he criticized
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.560]  the NDAA.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.760]  This is the new, they did that with Jews in Germany, they said, well, you criticize the
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.280]  government, you can't have a business or travel, and we're going to get into Iran situation,
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:29.080]  the election, so much more with George Norrie of coast-to-coastam.com, where I'll be on
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:37.320]  with him in the first hour tonight, midnight to 1 a.m. central, I guess 10 to 11 p.m. Pacific
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.320]  tonight at coast-to-coastam.com, or just turn your a.m. or f.m. radio on and dial through.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.360]  You can't miss it.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:48.640]  On close to 600 radio stations, George Norrie, it is still, I pinch myself to have you here
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.640]  with us tonight.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.640]  It's so amazing.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.640]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.640]  Oh, my pleasure, Alex.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.880]  I wanted to tell you a real funny Matt Drudge story, Matt and I are very close.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:02.040]  And some time ago, he contacted me, sent me a little email and said, George, I got to
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.200]  get ahold of Alex.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.840]  Can you get me his number?
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.000]  And I said, yeah, sure.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.240]  So I went to Tommy, my producer, and I said, look, I need you to get Alex's number over
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.240]  to Matt Drudge.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.160]  I don't know what he wants, but he wants to talk to him.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:23.680]  So I have noticed that a lot of your stories appear on the Drudge report, and he's interested.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:29.840]  What's kind of funny, Alex, is what was conspiratorial years ago with things that you did and things
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.120]  that I did that are beginning to become mainstream now.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.600]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.160]  Yeah, thanks to you.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.160]  I mean, I'm not groveling.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.480]  I only give credit where it's due.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:43.040]  You were already growing, would have broken out, had some success, but I'm telling you,
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.680]  you were the nitrous oxide.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.320]  You know in the road warrior where they got the cars going 200, but then humongous turns
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.640]  it on nitrous oxide and goes, boom, it's like George Norrie was, boom.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.920]  And then Matt Drudge, boom, just like really sending us into the stratosphere.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.360]  So thank you, my friend, because most people in media are egomaniacs.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.920]  They're not like you and Drudge who really care about the information.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.280]  No, not at all.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.640]  You're absolutely right about that.
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:10.840]  And I'm also in jubilation tonight because my Detroit Tigers, that's where I was born.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.320]  They're going to the World Series.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.160]  They beat the Yankees four games to none.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.240]  And of course, as you know, Alex, I spend a lot of time between St. Louis and LA, my
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:26.320]  other place, and St. Louis is almost World Series-bomb, you know.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.000]  So I may have a chance to see both teams in the World Series.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.680]  Talk about a dream come true, rooting for teams for your whole life.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.400]  And now both of them could be up against each other.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.400]  Yep, absolutely.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.400]  Now, who would I pick?
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.960]  Well, you've got to pick Detroit because it's a boy thing.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.920]  My son was born in St. Louis.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.520]  He's going to pick the Cardinals, so we'll see what happens.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.080]  Very, very exciting.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:55.160]  George, wow, where should we start tonight with the hundreds of incredible topics out
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.160]  there?
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.680]  Why don't we talk a little bit about the Iranian situation?
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.040]  Yeah, that's getting wild.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.840]  Being full in here, as the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers,
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.560]  Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.520]  home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.600]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.400]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.880]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.760]  evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.760]  culture.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:34.040]  Like Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi, and in India,
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.040]  fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.200]  But here's some good news.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.720]  South Reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.760]  foods legally and privately in their own homes, since it's still legal to make these foods
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.680]  as long as you can make them yourself.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.600]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.560]  That's fermentationfactor.com.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:57.760]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods, and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.760]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:09.760]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:27.240]  I've had Jerry Corsi on the show for at least a year and a half, where we have talked about
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:32.440]  the Iranian situation, and both of us felt that there'd be some kind of military conflict
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.720]  against Iran about a year and a half ago.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.120]  It hasn't happened yet.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.040]  I think it's getting close.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:43.400]  My prediction is something's going to happen after the election.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:51.360]  I do not believe that the powers that be want anything to get involved with the election
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.360]  one way or another.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:57.160]  I think they're a little confused over what candidate would benefit from some kind of
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:01.640]  military intervention in Iran, but I think something's going to happen.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:08.320]  We have seen Iranian hackers attacking the bank system successfully, shutting down websites
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.360]  and things like that, and that's just what we know.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:16.720]  We don't know what we don't know, but I just have this gut feeling, Alex.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:17.720]  Something is going to happen.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:22.800]  It's going to be very, very soon, and all hell could break loose.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:27.280]  Let's hope to God it's not as bad as I think it could be, but I think something's going
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.280]  to happen.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.080]  It's a double-edged sword.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.080]  There's a problem here.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:37.840]  There's no question that Iran is working on nuclear weaponry along with their nuclear
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:38.840]  program.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.000]  I mean, they're doing that.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.160]  You have to be concerned over a nation like that that spouts the kind of rhetoric and
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:49.040]  hatred that they have toward Americans.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.440]  Well, just to interrupt, which you know I'm the king of, that's it.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:59.600]  You know I'm anti-war, and I don't try to take sides in all this, but I mean, the Iranian
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.480]  president every week says, and I wouldn't look at the translation.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.160]  He's saying, we're going to blow Israel off the map.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.880]  You've got a country like Israel with all these nukes.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:08.880]  Iran's getting nukes.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:13.120]  They want to be able to deploy them, and then they're saying, I'm going to nuke you.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:19.200]  It's like some guy that weighs, you know, 50 pounds threatening the UFC champion.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.840]  Why is Iran asking for it?
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:27.080]  Because I don't want this war, I don't want $10 a gallon gas, but why is Iran just asking
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.080]  for it?
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.080]  These people are insane.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:36.000]  I've got a lot of friends who were Iranians who came here after the Shah of Iran situation,
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.840]  who by the way was no Boy Scowling.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.440]  We can talk about that a little bit later on.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:47.880]  But I've got one source who has told me weeks before anything happens in Iran, and I've
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.200]  had it on coast to coast.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:56.680]  He'll say, look, people are upset that the valuation of our Rael is going to go down.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.200]  That's their currency.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.080]  And sure enough, a week or two later, it goes down.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.080]  He's been spot on.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.720]  He said the people in Iran love the United States overall.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.280]  He said, we want that kind of government.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.620]  We want to live that way.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.240]  We buy blue jeans.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.280]  We buy cell phones.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.400]  We like that style.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:25.200]  It's the mullahs, these insane people who are out there spouting this hatred, spouting
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.200]  this rhetoric.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:31.840]  I mean, you know, we've got nukes, and yes, we used them during World War II and we stopped
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:32.840]  the war.
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.720]  We can argue whether it was right or wrong to use it.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:40.680]  But I haven't heard the United States threaten to use nukes against any other country ever
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.920]  since, even in the Cold War during the Soviet Union back in the 60s.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.080]  I mean, we didn't say, we're going to launch against you.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:55.200]  I mean, the Iranians, the government talks in terms of using this stuff.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.480]  You know, when you have a neighbor that says, we're going to blow you off the map, we want
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.800]  a regime change.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.800]  We want you gone.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.080]  Oh, listen, if I had a neighbor that got in my face and said, I'm going to kick your
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.280]  butt and then he was menacing me with an axe, I'd kick his ass.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.760]  You'd have to do something.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.040]  You could be living right next to him.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:17.640]  You know, he could peer over his fence all the time, like tool time.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.840]  You just can't let that happen.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:25.480]  When you weigh all that, you weigh all that, I have got to assume that there's going to
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:28.480]  be some kind of conflict to take out.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:33.720]  But Iran, like I said, I mean, Israel is an absolutely armed camp.
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.960]  It's got the United States backing it up.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.000]  Why is Iran playing into that?
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.480]  I mean, I don't want this war.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.680]  I'm not against Iran.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.760]  Like you said, polls show 70 plus percent of Iranians love America and hate the moolas
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.240]  show, you know, a lot of people in our government don't want to attack Iran either.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.240]  They think it could.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.120]  I mean, it's just horrible that this could happen.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:58.360]  I think what they've been hoping is an Arab Spring by bringing the Iranian economy down
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.520]  so far that the people would just go ballistic and would do what they had to do.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.960]  But they can't do that.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.880]  The moolas are too strong.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.400]  They're too entrenched with their revolutionary guard.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.800]  Those people are not going to give up oil, money, power that easily.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.080]  And they're going to hang in there for as long as they can.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:24.480]  I mean, look at Assad in Syria, holding on as long as he can, butchering his own people.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.600]  And they don't have those kind of resources.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:30.080]  Syria is not an oil rich nation.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.680]  The Iranians are rich.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.680]  They're powerful.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:38.200]  And the 70-some people who are controlling the destiny of that country don't want to
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200]  give it up.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.800]  And on the other side, George, we've got the West sending in a bunch of Saudi Arabian jihadis
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.800]  against Syria.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.280]  It runs from bad to worse.
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.000]  And it's all coming to a head.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.120]  What do you make of Joseph Sticklets in the Washington Post today, former head of the
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:00.680]  World Bank as the economist there, head world bank economist, Nobel Prize winner, saying
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:03.240]  Europe's in a depression and spreading worldwide.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.240]  Where do you see that going?
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.080]  Because here you are, five, six, seven, eight years ago, talking about it, being criticized.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.080]  I'm being criticized.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.160]  Gerald Salente, so many others.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:17.000]  And now everything on the news sounds like something we would have been covering.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  But I'm not waiting for some award or a pat on the back for being right.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.840]  Instead, we still get criticized.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840]  But it's all coming true.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:30.920]  I mean, if you and I had a crystal ball years ago, and we were able to look into the future,
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.960]  Alex, we are looking exactly at what we had seen.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:35.960]  We knew this.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.000]  We predicted this.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  We talked about it.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.920]  We both had specialized guests on the ear talking about the things that would happen.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.680]  And it's all coming true.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:49.880]  I mean, I don't like the fact that it's happening, but it's happening.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.720]  And the name of the game is control.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:59.040]  You know, when Sigmund Abrasinski said about a year and a half ago that they, being us,
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:04.560]  are becoming more aware of what the plan is, we have to act and act fast.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.640]  We have to do this quickly.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.080]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.640]  They are operating and working as if they are running out of time.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.840]  And you know what?
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.280]  I think they are.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:20.400]  And so that's why they're pushing all these agendas so fast.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.440]  One thing they never anticipated.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.200]  They didn't expect people to push back and that's what's beginning to happen.
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:32.320]  And it's happening in all walks of life and people are fed up.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.320]  You can feel it.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.960]  You can talk to your friends, your neighbors.
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.240]  They just don't feel comfortable anymore and they're pushing back.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:45.800]  And I think that pushback is healthy because that is what's going to keep people in line
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:46.800]  eventually.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:52.040]  It's what's going to keep these world government leaders to realize that they just can't do
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.400]  that to people.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.080]  George, what type of pushback should the people be engaged in?
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:02.080]  Well, you know, I was in a Navy nine years, Alex, and I'm not an advocate of any kind
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.760]  of conflict.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.680]  But you've got to protest.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:11.560]  You've got to do what you can do in the voting booth, even though, you know, the old adage
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.720]  is, you know, it doesn't matter.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:17.480]  Every candidate's the same or they'll change eventually.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.960]  Violence is not a way to get it done.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.640]  You have to protect yourself.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:25.080]  I'm a guns rights activist, I'm a concealed weapons permit holder.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.960]  You do that for safety purposes.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.320]  You don't do that for aggressive purposes.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:37.160]  But you've just got to continue to tell your friends, tell your family members what is
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:43.000]  going on and hopefully that this mission that we've all been on for these years will continue
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  to grow.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  I mean, years ago, people didn't believe us when we talked about things like that.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.160]  They thought we were nuts.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.720]  They don't think that anymore.
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:59.320]  I mean, now that the camp that we're in is getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:03.920]  But with great power comes great responsibility and that's what's so frustrating is trying
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:10.880]  to figure out all the angles when even the power structure isn't in control.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:15.960]  It's an amazing thing to see, but I've studied as you have other countries and whether it
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:21.160]  was the Nazis or the communist Chinese or the Russians or Pol Pot or any of them, fascist
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.840]  communists, authoritarian doesn't matter, all basically the same thing, different flavors
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.120]  of the same thing.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:31.400]  The same end result, total tyranny, a bunch of crooks taking control.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:37.000]  The fact that our founders did put that second amendment in there, it slows down the riots,
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.600]  it slows down the corruption, it's a checkmate against tyranny.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:50.800]  That is such a bulwark, even in a collapse, basically like bulkhead doors or floodgates.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:55.120]  The term I guess would be, what do you call it, firewalls.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:00.760]  That second amendment is just so important and is such a wild card.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:05.200]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.440]  half year on record.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:12.040]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions, not only corn, soy, alfalfa, fruits,
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:15.280]  vegetables and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.280]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280]  food prices.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.920]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.880]  your own supply of foods from Eat Foods Direct now.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.760]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, Eat Foods will have to raise prices too.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.440]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:37.200]  I recently increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct because we have all known this was
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.200]  coming.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.200]  You know about their delicious long term storable foods.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:44.920]  The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today and because it stores for 25 years,
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.720]  you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:48.720]  Don't wait.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:53.760]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eatfoodsdirect.com forward slash alex.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.240]  Call 800-409-5633 or eatfoodsdirect.com forward slash alex.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.600]  You can bet your life on Eat Foods Direct.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.520]  Gold and flu season is upon us.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:09.560]  Protect yourself with supernatural silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:13.680]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:19.720]  used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, as well as help improve
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.240]  wound healing.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:26.200]  Silver salt technology is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:32.400]  the causes of many serious diseases like strep throat, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and other
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.120]  harmful pathogens.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:38.800]  This new technology is much more effective than colloidal or ionic silvers and has the
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:45.120]  ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:47.520]  of older solutions.
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:50.680]  Supernatural silver is what you need for any emergency.

[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.840]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for tree seekers.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:08.240]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:13.600]  at infowars.com and out of all the titles we've carried one stands out because it is
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:19.520]  just so chillingly convincing and that's Dreams From My Real Father by Joel Gilbert
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:22.080]  available at infowars.com.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.680]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:29.800]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:34.000]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.

[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.280]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:45.080]  We're also carrying behind the green mask, You and Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.960]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:52.760]  The greater good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.920]  the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:19:00.280]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:04.200]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freak setting poison to your water and laughing
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.880]  as you get sick and die?
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:08.080]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.680]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:17.240]  is ProPure and it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:20.760]  These filters are silver and pregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:22.400]  There's no priming required.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.920]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:28.320]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.920]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.480]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:34.400]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:37.800]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.880]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.600]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:49.720]  That's what my family uses, infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure, but if you
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:55.280]  add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:01.640]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:05.400]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:12.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:19.960]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:22.280]  the mind of man.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:24.000]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:39.280]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:42.480]  We're going into a controlled depression.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:45.840]  What do you expect to happen, George, from all the different guests and experts you talk
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.840]  to in the next six months to a year?
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.760]  Well, if you listen to people like Gerald Salente and he's been on your program as well
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.800]  as mine, we're at the cusp of collapse.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.720]  I'm not sure it's that bad.
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:06.480]  I still think that these fiat net money people are going to prop up this economy for several
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.480]  years.
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:11.320]  We're going to get hit with some downturns, but they're going to keep printing money.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:17.240]  The problem, Alex, is eventually your kids and my kids or my grandchildren, they're going
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.080]  to pay the piper.
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.680]  That's where it's going to be bad.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:24.840]  It's going to be bad five, 10, 15 years out from now.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:29.240]  We may get by over the next couple of years with these ups and these downs.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:35.000]  I mean, if gasoline prices ever get back to anything that was respectable, auto sales
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.040]  will pick up even higher than they've been going lately.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:43.200]  I'm more concerned about the future of your kids, the future of mine and what's going
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.640]  to happen to them.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:46.960]  It's like race.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:52.680]  When you're in a four-person race and you're in a team and you hand the baton off to the
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:59.360]  guy when you come around the circle and he runs, you want to give them a pretty darn
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:03.320]  good head start because that'll help ensure some victory.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:08.200]  Well, we're not passing the baton off to our people, to our young people.
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.600]  We're not giving them that head start anymore, Alex.
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:16.640]  If anything, we're giving them laps and laps behind the leaders.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:21.320]  They're not going to have that opportunity that you and I have had over these years.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:24.280]  My son got a degree in criminal justice.
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:27.600]  He was not able to use it in that chosen field.
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.760]  He ended up working as a casino host at St. Louis.
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.920]  He got transferred to Vegas.
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:33.920]  He didn't like it.
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.480]  He felt that the baton switched him.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.800]  He moved back to St. Louis.
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.800]  I'm helping him out there.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.240]  People are looking for work.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.680]  I get emails every day from listeners.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:48.160]  Every day, can you help me with this?
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:50.000]  Can you help me with that?
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.360]  Can you do this for... Can you find me a job?
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:58.160]  It's amazing what's going on in society.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:02.400]  One of the things I'm going to do because I think it's gotten so bad out there is I'm
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.760]  working on a project which I cannot announce yet, but I will with you when the time comes.
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:13.600]  I'm going to set up a foundation and help our coast-to-coast listeners who are financially
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.240]  stressed.
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:19.000]  The show has been very good to me.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.600]  I'm going to set this up at the time that we start rolling along with this project that
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.160]  I'll announce hopefully within 30 days.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:34.520]  If any coast-to-coast listeners or even info-war listeners are in serious trouble and they need
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:38.000]  some money for utilities and things like that, we're going to help them out.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.480]  I did that with our book sales.
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:45.160]  We didn't give out a lot of money because we didn't get a lot of requests, but I think
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.720]  we're going to point now where people need help and we're going to do it.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:49.720]  It's the honor system.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:54.400]  I'm going to have my producer, Tom, handle it for me.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.760]  We could get burned once in a while with someone who just wants to put a few hundred bucks
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.800]  in their pocket, but so be it.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.800]  It's well worth the chance.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.320]  Well, that's what it's all about.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:06.120]  We've got to be all in and George, you told me about some of your plans.
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:11.680]  They're just simply amazing, but this is a planned implosion and if we don't try to take
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:17.200]  care of each other, if we don't promote people that promote liberty, if we don't stand up
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:22.040]  for what we believe in, we're going to lose it all because the ruling class is so disconnected
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.600]  from reality.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:27.880]  These globalist brag, they're about monopolies that government can give them.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.800]  They're monopoly capitalist.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.280]  They're monopoly men.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:36.080]  They're mafia, basically, and they, I mean, they're public about it.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:41.360]  They think they're going to organize and control and ride this tiger of economic collapse,
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:48.600]  but historically every elite thinks that because they're living in these armored redoubts and
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.080]  you know, feel insulated.
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:54.160]  I mean, this is not the way America was supposed to be.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:25:02.120]  Greed got us there, Alex, when it was cheaper to send your products out to get made to China
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:08.920]  or Mexico or Indonesia, cheaper to make it out there, cheaper to ship it all back into
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:16.360]  the country and not use US labor to use that to do that, that's when it started to happen.
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:22.840]  It was a systematic plan to increase the shareholder value for most of these companies.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:25.360]  Hey, you know what, I'm all for profit.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:26.360]  I'm all for profit.
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:31.840]  I think if you're running a business, you need to make a profit, but at what point do
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:35.200]  you say this is not right?
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:40.440]  So I'm going to lower my profit, but I'm going to employ more Americans.
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:42.440]  I'm going to keep people working.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:47.720]  I'm going to do the old Henry Ford routine and that simply was, you know what, you're
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:53.760]  working for me, support us, buy our goods, and let's push this product, let's push this
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.200]  company and let's get going.
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.720]  Well, they didn't do that.
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:04.400]  Instead, they all decided to go to China and that's what has hurt us and until we get
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:10.720]  to a point where we can be competitive again, truly competitive in the marketplace, it's
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.720]  not going to come back.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:17.560]  My daughter, who you've been so kind to put up on your website, has this little jewelry
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:22.840]  company and she got two little girls and these little girls said, mommy, mommy, we want to
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:23.840]  make this jewelry.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.840]  We want to do one of these.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:29.200]  So as a mother, she said, have some fun, make this little necklace and do it.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:35.200]  But it was hilarious because the way it looked, I said to her, you are using little children
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:40.520]  to make these products and she started laughing, but that's what they do in all these other
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.520]  countries.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:48.360]  They're using that kind of labor, that minimal cost labor to generate products and things
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.480]  like that and it's just, it's abominable.
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.080]  I wish I had the answer.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:00.480]  I wish I had that special answer to get this thing solved and done.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:08.160]  Both presidential main candidates, they all try, Alex, you know where I come from, I think
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:14.080]  most of these people are nice people, well-intentioned and want to do the best job.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:19.360]  They think they can, but of course, for their own special interest groups, they get in the
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:24.840]  way and everything goes to H and a basket.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.920]  But I don't think they have the answers for this.
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:35.000]  I mean, I think this is one of the most difficult things in the world to solve and just coming
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.440]  in for four years or eight years is not going to solve a problem that has been going on
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:43.240]  for a long, long time.
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:48.440]  All they want to do is minimize it, make it look good until they get it in out of office
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:54.320]  and they're out of there and hand the baton off to the next guy or women and let them
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.320]  worry about it.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:58.000]  Hey, by the way, George, I got to stop here right now.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.560]  Your daughter is a sponsor of MFullWords.com and if you go to MFullWords.com, about a third
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:08.640]  of the way down or halfway down, there's a jewelry ad and I didn't tell anybody at the
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.680]  office because, you know, the guy's running the show.
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:14.000]  They don't know what's going on in sales that your daughter was a sponsor, a small sponsor,
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.120]  but she's been a good sponsor for about two years or so.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:21.480]  And I clicked on it and Chris, who's in there running the board and the cameras because we're
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.800]  also streaming video, said, hey, I love that site.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:28.680]  I bought jewelry for my wife and now she just absolutely loves it.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:32.120]  He was just saying this in my ear while you were talking, so no, no, he didn't even know
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:36.280]  was your daughter, it's just funny that he bought some.
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.280]  It's tuliptopia-jewelry.com.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:42.360]  She's one of a kind, a little entrepreneur that she is.
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:46.880]  Hey, that's what it's all about and then it creates this incredible industry in the country,
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.880]  instead, globalism.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:50.240]  Look, it's not bad to go in a box store and buy something.
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:54.360]  If you buy something that's also original, but it's when everything is a box store and
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:29:00.960]  everything's from China, hey, folks, you know, it's not a good deal.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.960]  We're in full in here.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:05.940]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are
[01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:10.560]  losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy home-crafted sources
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.480]  for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:17.600]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.360]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.840]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:27.680]  evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.680]  culture.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:34.040]  Today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi, and in India,
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.080]  fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.200]  But here's some good news.
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:40.760]  South Reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:44.820]  foods legally and privately in their own homes, since it's still legal to make these foods
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:46.720]  as long as you can make them yourself.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:49.640]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.

[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:41.760]  needs.

[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.440]  Cold and flu season is upon us.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:09.520]  Protect yourself with supernatural silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial.
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:13.600]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:19.640]  used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, as well as help improve
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.200]  wound healing.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:26.160]  Silver salt technology is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:32.120]  the causes of many serious diseases, like strep throat, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:34.060]  other harmful pathogens.
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:38.640]  This new technology is much more effective than colloidal or ionic silvers, and has
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:44.040]  the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times
[01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:47.480]  the effectiveness of older solutions.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.600]  Supernatural silver is what you need for any emergency.

[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:05.400]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:17.360]  Well, gentlemen, we have the one, the only, David Ike joining us here in just a moment,
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:20.640]  and David didn't request this, but I just want to do something different.
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:24.560]  I'm going to talk to him just four or five minutes, bring up a few topics, and then I'm
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:30.760]  going to step back, and then we're going to have David Ike just absolutely wide open.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:34.640]  I had a good idea what David would want to get into first, and I was talking to him this
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:36.000]  morning, and I said, what do you want to get into?
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.040]  And he said, the Jimmy Savelle sex abuse scandal, and because David has researched
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:45.120]  and exposed, it's undoubtedly that it's a pedophile network at the top worldwide.
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.920]  I mean, you saw that with Jerry Sandusky, and of course it went higher up, and we told
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:49.920]  you that a long time ago.
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:50.920]  Now, that's come out.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:54.440]  I never remember John DeKamp on the show more than a decade ago saying that there was sex
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:58.040]  abuse at Penn State and the football program, and I remember shutting him down because I'd
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:01.320]  never been in the news, and I don't want to get sued.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:06.000]  And you've had all the cases in Europe where, you know, they find little kids dead in dungeons
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.360]  and it turns out judges and people are running, and we have the Texas Youth Commission here
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:13.040]  in Texas where they would have the judges and police go in and have sex with little
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:18.480]  kids in the CPS and also in the juvenile halls, and that got all swept out of the rug.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:24.360]  I mean, these are really creepy people, I mean, beyond creepy, and this is their world.
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:28.360]  They admit the CPS are in this country seven times more likely to sexually abuse children
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.680]  than any other group, five times more likely to physically abuse them.
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.240]  You can look those numbers up.
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:38.840]  They put two-thirds of the kids plus on psychotropic drugs, seven on average.
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:42.520]  So it's all about hurting the children, and they can't get away with chopping their hearts
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:45.640]  out like every other culture did while they do the other things.
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:50.200]  So we're going to tie that into former IMF head, live the life of eyes wide shut.
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:57.280]  That's what the New York Times said, down in underground grottoes in mass sex orgies.
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.800]  That's just the gateway to all this.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:05.280]  I've talked to high-level Hollywood people who have been in underground caves in England
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:09.360]  and in satanic orgies, and then of course it's off record, I'm not allowed to say who,
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.360]  but that says a journalist.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.360]  None of it was illegal.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.360]  I was told about it.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:17.360]  It was adults, but that's just the gateway into all of this.
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.720]  We're going to be going over all of that, and I said I'd cover this Wednesday and then
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:27.160]  Thursday, never did, meet Manzamoza, the richest human being in all history, but number two
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.160]  are the Rothschilds.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:32.000]  That was London Independent, and it's a big list, the 26 richest people in history.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.840]  And actually, it's a pretty accurate list from my research, so we're going to be going
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:40.000]  over that and talking about Iran, Joseph Stiglitz saying, Europe's under depression.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  No kidding.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.040]  It's proven right there, the stupid presidential reality show, all of it, with the one, not
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.040]  only David Icke.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:52.120]  Now, before we go to David, he's got his big event coming up there at one of the most
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:58.160]  famous stadiums in the world, not just in Britannia or Albion, they're over in the UK,
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:03.000]  and it is so important that everyone who lives in Europe or England, or great time of year
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.400]  to travel to England if you're planning to go on a vacation or visit family or whatever,
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:12.720]  get to his historic event because it's already getting a lot of media attention, and it's
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:16.080]  important that it be big, and it's important to call the media and tell them to give it
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:20.840]  attention because in 12 hours, it's going to be historic, but never fear David is going
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.840]  to provide.
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:24.840]  I don't know how he's going to do this because it's killing us to give out free video streams
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:25.840]  we've got right now.
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:29.680]  It's kind of like the snake eating itself where we're bringing in money, but then putting
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:33.280]  out the free video streams to hundreds and hundreds of thousands that have tuned into
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:37.240]  those is quite expensive, but he's going to offer, I think it's free to everybody
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:42.240]  a video feed, and he said for several months it'll then be free, so it sounds like David
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:44.840]  is all in, and that's what we're doing.
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:49.720]  We're all in, but go to davidike.com, get your tickets signed up, but call the media,
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:54.240]  spread the words, your Facebook, your Twitter, tell people about the Wembley Arena October
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:58.240]  27th, notice you're doing it right before Salmon or Halloween, the big globalist occult
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:05.560]  day to really kind of counter their darkness, davidike.com, David Ike, David D-A-V-I-D-I-C-K-E
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:10.000] .com, all right, without further ado, again, I want to thank everybody, I want to thank
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.520]  all the guests, I want to thank David Ike, I want to tell you, go to davidike.com and
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:18.240]  get behind what he's doing, and David, before we get into the big pedophile scandals, the
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:23.640]  war, the economy, all of that, and I'm just going to step back, but upfront, spend a few
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:28.040]  minutes telling us about the Wembley event and why it's so important, I mean, I know
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:31.800]  why it's so important, but in your own words, why is it so important?
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:37.200]  Well, Alex, in many ways, it's where my life's been going since I started on this road.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:44.120]  I didn't realize it was until the last year or so, but it's the culmination of the work
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:47.680]  that I've done and the research that I've done up to this point, it's not the end of
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:53.400]  it, it's the start of a new era, but it's a culmination of nearly 25 years of research
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:38:00.680]  in 50 odd countries, and I wanted to get a large number of people together to make a
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:07.280]  statement to not just the mainstream media, but mainstream society, that something's
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.280]  changing.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:14.040]  You know, I can remember not that long ago when the number of people that were coming
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:20.680]  to my events was in hundreds, and not long before that, it was on, you know, you could
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:22.320]  be count them on two hands.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:30.640]  You know, I talked in Chicago to eight people, and in those lonely years of the 1990s, when
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:36.960]  no one really wanted to know about this in any kind of numbers, and now, you know, thousands
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:42.280]  of people are coming to the Wembley Arena next Saturday, and there'll be thousands
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:50.240]  of more watching around the world, and what I'm going to do is connect an absolute massive
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:56.840]  number of dots, because I guess, you know, what my contribution to all this over the
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:07.360]  years has been to take apparently unconnected people, historical events, modern events,
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:15.560]  everything from food additives to Fukushima, to some far out stuff from mainstream society's
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:22.400]  point of view, and fit the dots together, because you can only see the picture, as you
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:27.240]  can only see a jigsaw puzzle picture when the pieces are in place.
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:32.620]  You can see a jigsaw puzzle all over the table or over the floor, and you can pick
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:37.520]  up an individual piece, and you know, this is interesting, it's a nice shape, it's some
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:45.040]  nice colors, it's interesting in and of itself, but you put it together with the other pieces,
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:53.000]  and the true relevance of that one piece when connected to all the others is seen with crystal
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:58.360]  clarity, and that's what I'm going to do over an event, the event's going to last 12 hours,
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:04.280]  I'm going to be talking for about 9 and a half, with about 1500 images and videos, and
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:09.440]  there'll be music and everything, but it's the dot connecting that's vital.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.600]  The first two and a half hours, where I'm talking about the nature of reality, the reality
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:20.120]  that we're experiencing is absolutely vital, because I would suggest, I could talk a bit
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:25.680]  about that in this hour you've given me, but it's absolutely vital to understand the nature
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:31.120]  of the reality that we're experiencing, because without that we cannot even begin to understand
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:38.720]  the true nature and depth of the conspiracy and the manipulation that we are being subjected
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:45.480]  to hour by hour, because at the core of the core of the core of those who are at the center
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:50.840]  of these networks that are behind that, they understand what the nature of reality is,
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.960]  they understand how we interact with it, they understand how we manifest our sense of perception
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:02.920]  and our sense of daily reality, and if they have that knowledge and we don't, or mass,
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:10.560]  the human population, then we are a piece of cake to manipulate, and so all these different
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:17.640]  areas that appear completely unconnected must be connected for the picture to be seen.
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:23.640]  This is why science is a waste of space, mainstream science, because it's a series of disciplines
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:29.480]  where each discipline is focused on its own discipline, often competing with other disciplines
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:35.360]  for funding and prestige and all the rest of it, and they're not connecting the dots
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:40.720]  even of what they know, and when you do, you see a very, very different world.
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.680]  This is why, and a very different explanation of the world, to mainstream science.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.360]  This is why some even mainstream scientists with a bit more of an open mind are starting
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:53.760]  to look at some of the things I've been talking about all these years and realize that they
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:59.400]  do provide answers to apparently unanswerable, great questions and great mysteries.
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:00.400]  They're not mysteries.
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:04.800]  They're mysteries only because the dots are not connected.
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.640]  It's so simple, and so over this nine and a half hours that I'll be speaking, I'll
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:16.560]  be strand by strand by strand putting the tapestry together, and whoa, will it make
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:21.240]  the world look different, but also, and this is my, I can say this with confidence because
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:25.600]  I've seen it happen to so many people all around the world when they've heard this information
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:32.040]  put together, they will see the world with a clarity that they couldn't see before because
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:38.240]  the idea of the conspiracy is to keep the dots apart, keep the dots apart, and then
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:43.600]  they won't see the picture, keep the pieces in the jigsaw puzzle, unconnected, and they
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:50.280]  won't see the picture, and then they are banking on the fact that we will never see the picture.
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:55.760]  Well we have, it's there to be seen, and when it is, whoa, the world looks a very different
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:25.600]  place.
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:30.760]  We've got the live straw, so you can turn fetted water into safe water anywhere you go.

[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:01.680]  Aaron Fullen here.
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:05.720]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:10.320]  losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy home crafted sources
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:13.240]  for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt and kefir.
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:17.360]  It seems there's a war on life giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:20.120]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:23.600]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:27.440]  evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:28.440]  culture.
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:32.800]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi, and
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.800]  in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.040]  But here's some good news.

[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:43.200]  foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:46.440]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.

[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:31.720]  Okay, I've been on this road for nearly 25 years and I've walked the path
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:39.120]  with an open mind, not a naive mind, an open mind, a mind that says I'm not going to reject
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:44.680]  something just because it sounds far out, I'm not going to reject something because
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:47.080]  it is at odds with my belief system.
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:54.880]  I am going to let the information that I come across be my guide on what I accept to be
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:57.760]  true and what I do not.
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:03.560]  And it's a blank sheet of paper, what goes on there justifies its place, but I'm not
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:10.440]  going to deny anything a place on that piece of paper just because it's different to the
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:14.800]  norms that humanity has been programmed to believe is real.
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:22.360]  And so I'll just put this story together in simple this way I can in the time we have.
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.000]  And at the Wembley Arena, I'm going to be going into this and so much more in great
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  detail.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:33.520]  The first thing that I think we need to understand to understand the world is what is the world?
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:40.080]  You know, we're born into the world and we tend to accept the world as it is when we're
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:41.560]  born into it.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:45.840]  So yeah, well everyone knows that mate, it's always been like that, well maybe it hasn't.
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:49.760]  And maybe you've always thought it's like that because that's the only information
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:51.600]  you've ever been given.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.600]  Let's look at it.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:54.880]  Where did you get your information from, okay?
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:55.880]  You're born.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:56.880]  Yeah?
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:59.640]  You know the womb and you come into a family.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:05.160]  Now the family, your parents have been through the same system that you're about to go through
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:10.720]  and overwhelmingly there are hallelujah exceptions but overwhelmingly they will have accepted
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:16.880]  what the system told them was real about history, about life, about reality, about all of it.
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:22.000]  Now they're not being nasty people to you and telling you something they believe not
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.200]  to be true just because they don't like it.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:31.160]  They're going to tell you in your formative years what they have been, I would say programmed
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:32.600]  to believe is real.
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:36.840]  So they're doing it because they think what they're saying is right because the systems
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:38.360]  told them it's right.
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:45.000]  You, you then go into school and you go through the smaller schools and the bigger schools
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.680]  and then into college and university and through all that time.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:55.800]  Different levels are academics, professors and teachers who've been through the same
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:50:01.400]  system and then some to get to that level in academia and therefore they have taken
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:06.880]  on the same belief systems that the system has told them is real, be it science, be it
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:09.920]  academia, be it medicine, whatever.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:16.680]  And now through your life, your young life, they, all those people, system people, system
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:21.840]  software are going to then tell you what, what is right based on what they believe is
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:25.840]  right and what the curriculum has told them is right and they have to follow the curriculum.
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:32.280]  If you accept that version of reality and you've got a good memory, you can be very
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:35.560]  good at passing exams and the system will reward you then.
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.600]  It will say, oh yes, here's a degree and all Johnny's done ever so good at school.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:41.840]  How has he done well at school?
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:45.720]  Well, he's told the system what it told him to believe and he repeated it and the system
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:46.720]  loves that.
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:47.720]  Yeah.
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:48.720]  What happens if you challenge the system?
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.160]  Well, the authority figure, the teacher, all the rest of it is, is jumping in straight
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.160]  away.
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:59.720]  You know, you conform in the education system because it's programming you and preparing
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:02.200]  you to conform for the rest of your adult life.
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:07.920]  So where I'm going with this initially is where do we get these belief systems from
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:13.840]  that we then take on for the rest of our lives is real and then anyone like me who challenges
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:19.440]  that sometimes majorly challenges it, he's got to be mad or crazy or something.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:24.320]  No, no, I've just not accepted the system's version of events and by system, I mean religious
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:25.320]  version of events.
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:27.200]  I mean science version of events, all of it.
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:32.120]  I've let the blank sheet of paper be my guide on what I believe based on the information
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:33.640]  justifying itself there.
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:39.400]  And when you do that and you erase what the systems told you and you don't let the systems
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:45.480]  version of events be a constant 24 seven sensor for anything outside of it, then the world
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:48.920]  looks a very different place and your mind can now move.
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:52.160]  It's no longer in the prison cell of conformity.
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:53.160]  It's moving.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.160]  It's expanding.
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:55.160]  It's getting insights.
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:57.000]  It's seeing things it didn't see before.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:05.160]  And I found it very interesting that in 1984 in George Orwell's book, he made the point
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:12.320]  about history and to summarize, he was basically saying, if you control history, you control
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:14.040]  the present.
[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:22.400]  Because if you can manipulate and distort and outright lie about where we've come from,
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:28.520]  what we call history, then you are going to give people a totally distorted view of where
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:33.480]  they are because they're going to see where they are as the culmination of where we've
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:34.640]  come from.
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:38.760]  So hijacking history has been fundamentally important.
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:43.760]  You look at the detailed evidence of the background, the Rockefellers and all these people hijacked
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:45.800]  the writing of history.
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:52.680]  So that blank sheet of paper I'm talking about also has history erased from it on the basis
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:55.360]  of what the systems version of history is.
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:53:04.320]  And history has to earn its place on the paper by evidence, by credible evidence, not by
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:08.080]  the systems version of events that we have to follow.
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:13.760]  And understanding history is fundamental to understanding where we are and what's going
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:17.040]  on and what's really behind this global conspiracy.
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:24.120]  So let me go through a story which I will back up with evidence at Wembley and in massive,
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:26.880]  massive evidence in my books.
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:33.240]  First of all, we need to, like I say, understand or appreciate the basics of the reality we're
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:38.880]  experiencing even before we can understand the historical part of it.
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:46.080]  We look in the mirror and we think that we're looking at a body and the body is us.
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:50.800]  We look around the world and we think it's all very solid and all the rest of it.
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:51.800]  It's not solid.
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:52.800]  The world's not solid.
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:58.760]  You look at quantum physics and it will show you the world's not solid.
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:00.600]  It's supposed to be made up of atoms.
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:04.720]  This is what this solid desk is supposed to be made up of atoms, and you once seen it
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:09.200]  inside of an atom, it has no solidity whatsoever.
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:18.440]  Someone rightly said that if you take an atom to be the size of a cathedral, then the nucleus
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:23.680]  of the atom will be about the size of a 10 cent piece, and then you've got the electrons
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:29.400]  flying around the nucleus, and there is no solidity.
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:33.120]  It's just a pocket of energy, if you like.
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:39.320]  So how can the world be solid when it's made, we're told, of atoms that have no solidity?
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:40.320]  That's crazy.
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:44.000]  This is why what's happened with quantum physics, where they've shown this to be the
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:51.160]  case, that basically if you look at it, the rest of mainstream science just goes on in
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:54.880]  its disciplines as if quantum physics doesn't exist.
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:59.600]  I know the world's not solid, but it's going to be a lot of problem for all our belief
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:05.080]  system in science if we accept that it's not solid, so we'll carry on as if it is.
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:07.400]  That's exactly what's happened, it's crazy.
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:12.440]  And thus, when you look deeper at it, the world is not solid.
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:16.520]  It is like, I call it the cosmic internet.
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:23.280]  If you look at a room, you're sitting in a room and they've got the wireless internet.
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:25.320]  Okay, where is it?
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:27.320]  You can't see it.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:34.760]  I tell you this, if you didn't have a computer to tune into that wireless internet and pull
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:41.760]  that information onto the screen as a reality, then people would ridicule anyone and say,
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:45.000]  you know, in this room, you know, in this room, there's a wireless internet.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.480]  It's a whole information field that can be accessed anywhere on the planet.
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:50.480]  You're mad.
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:52.000]  I can't see it.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  Well, there is a cosmic internet, which is based on the same basic principles, and it's
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.120]  an energetic field and fields of information.
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:10.880]  And we, through the human form, which is a biological computer, are picking up and tuning
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:18.200]  in to that information field, and we're bringing it in to what we call the world, the solid
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:19.200]  world.
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:24.960]  You can look at the internet on a computer screen going from website to website and website,
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:27.440]  and things can look very, very solid.
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:32.640]  But what you're looking at is simply decoded information, nothing else.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:35.800]  People say, tell me about the internet.
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:41.880]  Well, it's graphics and pictures and text on the screen.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:43.920]  Well, yes, it is.
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:51.080]  But only on the screen, everywhere else the internet is electronic information and circuits.
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:55.640]  Only on the screen does it look like we think of the internet.
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:57.240]  Okay, tell me about television.
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:59.000]  Well, it's moving pictures on a screen.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.200]  Well, yes, it is.
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:02.360]  But only on the screen.
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:07.600]  Everywhere else, it's information fields, be digital or frequency fields, whatever version
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:09.120]  it is.
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:16.040]  And the only place that this world that we think is outside of us and we think is so
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:21.280]  solid, the only place it exists is on our screen.
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:25.520]  David, I look forward to watching your event and then having you on in the aftermath after
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:26.520]  it.
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:27.520]  I'd like to talk to you.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:31.600]  But thank you so much for your courage, David, and the world is a much better place because
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:32.600]  you're in it.
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:33.600]  Well, it's very kind of you, mate.
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:36.000]  You just do your best, and tomorrow you do your best even more.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  That's all you can do.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  And then what happens happens.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.480]  Well, come on, we can do this.
