[00:49.720 --> 00:55.420]  news new legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the United States so we're
[00:55.420 --> 01:05.360]  going to be going over that today and all of the new victim disarmament that is
[01:05.360 --> 01:09.100]  unfolding we also have some guests that I'm going to tell you about a little bit
[01:09.100 --> 01:14.840]  later in the show that are coming on also Curt Nemo's been here all week

[01:32.920 --> 01:37.400]  go ahead and I think I'm gonna have Curt on today we've got several other guests
[01:37.400 --> 01:42.440]  and I've got to check with my producer exactly when the best time to have Curt
[01:42.440 --> 01:48.840]  in studio where this is specifically I want to open the phones up in the next
[01:48.840 --> 01:57.520]  segment for listeners to call in with their response to reading a lot of you've
[01:57.520 --> 02:02.600]  read at HR 645 and we know they've built FEMA camps we know they've been
[02:02.600 --> 02:05.480]  conditioning the local police to accept the FEMA camps we know they've been
[02:05.480 --> 02:09.760]  federalizing things the John Warner Defense Authorization Act PD 51
[02:09.760 --> 02:13.640]  announcing their new troops against the American people everything that was
[02:13.640 --> 02:17.440]  covert that we warned you about is now pretty much public this final piece of
[02:17.440 --> 02:22.160]  the puzzle is exactly what we said it was going to be because we reverse
[02:22.160 --> 02:28.000]  engineered it with all of the fragments of the secret operation we had with
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  those pieces it was complete now it's just we know we put the puzzle together
[02:32.000 --> 02:39.480]  exactly right because it gives you a very clear view of the PR the public
[02:39.480 --> 02:44.160]  relations offensive they're already engaged in with this cashless society
[02:44.160 --> 02:49.400]  surveillance system how they're gonna sell the public on going into the camps
[02:49.400 --> 02:54.240]  so I want to continue discussing this today but before I get into all the new
[02:54.240 --> 02:58.120]  gun control developments and it's all off the charts it's just every more is
[02:58.120 --> 03:02.000]  happening in a day now that again would happen in six months a year five years
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.360]  previously I mean it's just they are making their move right now completely
[03:07.360 --> 03:14.200]  parasitic criminal government totally illegitimate cremeditated long-term
[03:14.200 --> 03:20.440]  strategic planning for a invincible tyranny it is not invincible though if
[03:20.440 --> 03:25.560]  the people take action against it but the elite are trying to set up a full
[03:25.560 --> 03:35.920]  proof fail-safe grid technological enslavement system so we're going to be
[03:35.920 --> 03:42.200]  breaking that down here on the transmission today the toll-free number
[03:42.200 --> 03:52.880]  to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 and specifically you
[03:52.880 --> 03:56.920]  heard me break down how they're announcing I'll have the clergy response
[03:56.920 --> 04:02.080]  teams at the camps it says six major camps they've already built hundreds of
[04:02.080 --> 04:08.440]  camps they built what four big one million man camps it was reported about
[04:08.440 --> 04:13.960]  three years ago that FEMA contracts for Halliburton subsidiary KBR but now
[04:13.960 --> 04:18.360]  they're announcing that these will be massive fusion centers that'll have your
[04:18.360 --> 04:25.640]  local police the federal National Guard now be completely federalized pastors
[04:25.640 --> 04:33.200]  and other community quote activist and that's the Obama brigades so their
[04:33.200 --> 04:39.200]  private army this is this is really happening it's it's now unfolding it's
[04:39.200 --> 04:43.560]  no longer in the planning phases as they slowly built the architecture in
[04:43.560 --> 04:48.240]  semi-secrecy it wasn't hard to find out about if you were looking but it was
[04:48.240 --> 04:51.840]  somewhat secret before now they've turned the cloaking device off so they
[04:51.840 --> 04:55.760]  can open fire on us their cloaking device just dropped that means they're
[04:55.760 --> 04:59.480]  going in for the kill they are literally slitting the throat of the nation right
[04:59.480 --> 05:03.880]  now phase one of the insiders plan for a one-world government has been
[05:03.880 --> 05:07.560]  initiated with the recent bailout international bankers and power brokers

[08:29.200 --> 08:35.680]  key information and the problem that we all face psychologically is that even
[08:35.680 --> 08:39.480]  if we consciously know they're building FEMA camps and consciously know the
[08:39.480 --> 08:44.040]  office of the presidency has been turned into a dictatorship a vehicle of
[08:44.040 --> 08:47.600]  control over this region of the New World Order by the offshore private
[08:47.600 --> 08:51.800]  central banks looting the planet who are known as the New World Order really
[08:51.800 --> 08:56.960]  the old world order the robber barons the black nobility from Europe that it
[08:56.960 --> 09:03.040]  it's still hard to believe it even as it's happening now there are at least
[09:03.040 --> 09:12.880]  10 that we have found serious gun bills in the House of Representatives that
[09:12.880 --> 09:19.920]  will completely ban semi-automatic rifles and handguns there is a new one I
[09:19.920 --> 09:25.160]  couldn't believe it when I saw it I had to do some research there is a new bill
[09:25.160 --> 09:30.720]  that's cosponsored by Rahm Emanuel that he was cosponsoring right when he left
[09:30.720 --> 09:37.920]  what a month ago but when right before he resigned and the NRA is not telling
[09:37.920 --> 09:42.000]  people about it it's only gun owners of America it's only the new American
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.720]  magazine we went to Thomas dot loc dot gov and sure enough it's true ladies and
[09:47.720 --> 09:51.840]  gentlemen every gun owner in the United States will have to go in and be
[09:51.840 --> 09:57.280]  federally registered and you will register your guns so it's gun registration
[09:57.280 --> 10:03.440]  they've got another bill to ban all private transfer of firearms I mean it's
[10:03.440 --> 10:07.360]  a nightmare and then they set up on the news saying we're not coming after your
[10:07.360 --> 10:10.040]  guns we're not coming after your guns we're not coming after your guns we're
[10:10.040 --> 10:13.000]  not coming after your guns just like at Waco as they were machine-gunning them
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.360]  as they ran out the back door after the feds caught the place on fire for the
[10:16.360 --> 10:20.760]  Delta Force dead they were had loudspeakers saying this is not an
[10:20.760 --> 10:25.000]  assault this is not an assault remember two and a half years ago Senator
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.200]  Sessions with a whistle they said we're having a secret immigration reform
[10:28.200 --> 10:32.960]  bill but we won't let you know what it is till we vote and then it leaked and it
[10:32.960 --> 10:37.960]  was total amnesty for all illegal aliens for felons anyone who wanted to come
[10:37.960 --> 10:44.320]  here it was instantly legalized for six years then it was quote sunsetted but
[10:44.320 --> 10:49.560]  then it automatically re-upped unless they voted it down they are a pack of
[10:49.560 --> 10:55.880]  criminal control freaks and they hate it that you own property I don't care if
[10:55.880 --> 11:00.200]  it's one acre or a thousand acres they hate it that you've got nice houses and
[11:00.200 --> 11:03.520]  swimming pools they hate it you can homeschool your children they hate it you
[11:03.520 --> 11:06.840]  can send them to private school they hate it that you're not dependent on
[11:06.840 --> 11:10.960]  them they love the inner city and cultures they've had control of for
[11:10.960 --> 11:17.920]  hundreds of years as slaves and then as a 14th amendment slaves and breaking up
[11:17.920 --> 11:21.840]  the families and setting up the Planned Parenthoods to kill their babies they
[11:21.840 --> 11:25.600]  want that for everybody if you're black if you're Hispanic if you're white if
[11:25.600 --> 11:31.840]  you're Asian your middle class they hate your stinking guts and they're not in
[11:31.840 --> 11:36.400]  control this is one big giant reservation but we're Indians that still got guns
[11:36.400 --> 11:40.680]  still got bows and arrows and they don't like it first gun control laws against
[11:40.680 --> 11:48.200]  Native Americans first gun control laws against blacks it's slavery and we
[11:48.200 --> 11:55.200]  told you the attorney general of the United States Eric Holder or being
[11:55.200 --> 11:59.520]  approved Eric Holder this is the guy that helped cover up Oklahoma City we
[11:59.520 --> 12:04.440]  have his internal memos through lawsuits this is the guy who lobbied before the
[12:04.440 --> 12:10.400]  Supreme Court for total and complete disarmament of what he calls civilians
[12:10.400 --> 12:13.840]  he says no one who was not in the military or law enforcement to be able to
[12:13.840 --> 12:24.320]  own a gun period it's on record on record now you notice they just passed the
[12:24.320 --> 12:27.800]  big stimulus package was a trillion dollar you know they say it's 800 and
[12:27.800 --> 12:30.000]  something million but really it's over a trillion dollars if you look at it
[12:30.000 --> 12:38.240]  properly pay off to the stage pay off to their cronies corporate welfare but I'm
[12:38.240 --> 12:41.680]  not even covering that you know they talk about 25 50 billion dollar bailouts
[12:41.680 --> 12:48.680]  for Ford and Chevy and you know Ford GM none of that even compares to the 8.5
[12:48.680 --> 12:52.680]  trillion stolen as of seven weeks ago and then they've kept the numbers secret
[12:52.680 --> 12:56.960]  but at that time it was a trillion 300 billion a week the offshore banks were
[12:56.960 --> 13:01.640]  stealing they're going for broke ladies and gentlemen and they are coming for
[13:01.640 --> 13:05.640]  your guns make no mistake and you're like well never get away with it it's
[13:05.640 --> 13:10.440]  going to be crazy oh they shut your food your water your gas off for a few months
[13:10.440 --> 13:15.520]  most people are going to turn them in see this is all going to be done through
[13:15.520 --> 13:19.200]  psychological warfare these people are smart it's why they're in control they're
[13:19.200 --> 13:23.800]  not going to march out tomorrow and and say Alex Jones you know we're arresting
[13:23.800 --> 13:27.440]  you and taking you to a camp they're not going to march out and and and and go
[13:27.440 --> 13:33.120]  after political enemies day one they're going to let society unravel and fall
[13:33.120 --> 13:36.160]  apart they're going to suck the treasury completely dry and then they're
[13:36.160 --> 13:40.760]  going to foment riots if they have to to get them started and let cities burn
[13:40.760 --> 13:45.960]  and then they're going to send the army in the middle and the police in just like
[13:45.960 --> 13:55.640]  New Orleans just like LA Los Angeles to disarm people and stop people defending
[13:55.640 --> 14:00.480]  themselves you want to know where the SWAT teams and the flakback trailers of
[14:00.480 --> 14:04.360]  FBI leading regular army troops are coming they're coming to the wealthy
[14:04.360 --> 14:08.240]  areas they're going to come in and take your guns and take your jewelry like they
[14:08.240 --> 14:11.760]  did in New Orleans and they're going to have mercenaries with them like Bill
[14:11.760 --> 14:17.440]  Moyers get a report a few months ago admitting Mossad backed Israeli
[14:17.440 --> 14:23.560]  mercenaries were involved in operations and gun confiscation in New Orleans go
[14:23.560 --> 14:28.360]  pull it up you cannot make this up what is blackwater rating all over
[14:28.360 --> 14:33.480]  California Oregon right now California in Oregon legalized marijuana for
[14:33.480 --> 14:40.960]  medical use they can't get the local police to rate them they just send in
[14:40.960 --> 14:50.040]  blackwater it's in the LA Times they're coming after you all you idiots that
[14:50.040 --> 14:52.600]  gave money to the government all you idiots that gave money to the
[14:52.600 --> 14:56.320]  politicians all you that play golf with state senators and think you're elitist
[14:56.320 --> 15:01.040]  you're the ones they're coming after they want your bank accounts they want
[15:01.040 --> 15:05.360]  your house they want your company the Nazis you know the media always covers
[15:05.360 --> 15:09.320]  how Hitler put Jews and people in camps and he certainly did but most of what he
[15:09.320 --> 15:16.360]  did was stealing most of what they did was run around the world stealing all
[15:16.360 --> 15:20.280]  the art and literature and gold and diamonds and stealing from their own
[15:20.280 --> 15:24.480]  population and hundreds of thousands of prominent Nazis were killed and
[15:24.480 --> 15:29.440]  everything they had stolen robbed that's how the Nazis worked he let their
[15:29.440 --> 15:33.240]  low-level Nazi steal all the goodies and they'd line them up and shoot them and
[15:33.240 --> 15:37.920]  take the goodies for themselves that's what we're dealing with here this is and
[15:37.920 --> 15:42.400]  if you think the American people aren't as immoral as the Germans were let me
[15:42.400 --> 15:45.960]  give you a newsflash the Germans were a very moral upright people on average
[15:45.960 --> 15:51.360]  compare and with a work ethic but what they were is slavish to authority so
[15:51.360 --> 15:56.240]  authority told him to do something they do it but prior to Hitler it was one of
[15:56.240 --> 16:02.600]  the most moral nations in the world lowest crime rates least amount of
[16:02.600 --> 16:07.320]  stealing handshake deals very intelligent hard-working people and in a
[16:07.320 --> 16:12.720]  few years he had the cops in black uniforms lining kids up and blowing their
[16:12.720 --> 16:20.400]  heads off now that's how this works now I'm gonna tell you again
[16:20.400 --> 16:26.280]  everything we told you came true we've been right about it all now I have in
[16:26.280 --> 16:35.120]  front of me a huge stack of gun control bills these things have sponsors these
[16:35.120 --> 16:41.360]  things are racing through the house right now they are coming for your guns
[16:41.360 --> 16:46.400]  Barack Obama is a state and federal senator supported Chicago and DC gun
[16:46.400 --> 16:55.960]  ban ban you understand ban ban they've got another bill where Eric Holder the
[16:55.960 --> 16:59.520]  new Attorney General or whoever the Attorney General is going to be can by
[16:59.520 --> 17:05.240]  executive fiat pronounce guns illegal just like the new zoning laws make it
[17:05.240 --> 17:11.480]  where city councils or mayors can just announce that this is illegal or that's
[17:11.480 --> 17:17.080]  illegal or the Patriot Act you heard a top lawyer on yesterday saying yes talking
[17:17.080 --> 17:22.200]  back to a police officer as an act of terrorism under the subsection of the
[17:22.200 --> 17:28.040]  Patriot Act you heard that on air from the guy quoted in the LA Times now you
[17:28.040 --> 17:33.280]  want to laugh at Alex Jones and say oh you're exaggerating bull bull it's you
[17:33.280 --> 17:36.760]  who cannot some of you out there get your head around this and I want to tell
[17:36.760 --> 17:40.560]  all the yuppies and all the neocons and all the people laughing about this and

[17:55.320 --> 17:59.440]  it but they've gone past the point of returning their crimes so they're going

[18:34.560 --> 18:42.640]  my notes it's something like compulsory volunteerism I'm going to play a clip
[18:42.640 --> 18:48.360]  from a newscast where they actually read these text of the speech I just can't
[18:48.360 --> 18:52.560]  keep track of it anymore it's just all unbelievable there's so much happening
[18:52.560 --> 18:56.000]  we're not like crawling around in the dirt looking for evidence of the new
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.840]  world order looking for evidence of FEMA camps I've got stacks of it here in
[18:59.840 --> 19:05.320]  front of me and I look at the commenters on info wars dot com and prison punnet
[19:05.320 --> 19:08.480]  on com look at the comments on our YouTube videos and it's like Alex Jones the
[19:08.480 --> 19:12.280]  new order doesn't exist you're a lie when they talk about the new world order
[19:12.280 --> 19:16.080]  they just mean a new a new system of government well yeah that's what it is
[19:16.080 --> 19:20.200]  I mean here it is in the Wall Street Journal yesterday where it says the new
[19:20.200 --> 19:24.840]  world order is upon us full of hope and promise how realistic is the North
[19:24.840 --> 19:29.480]  American currency uniting US Canada to Mexico would result from crisis and then
[19:29.480 --> 19:33.200]  they say you've got to change the way your views are this isn't a conspiracy
[19:33.200 --> 19:38.800]  theory in fact it's good we've got to do it see they told you it didn't exist back
[19:38.800 --> 19:43.440]  when you could probably have stopped it now that it's probably too late they're
[19:43.440 --> 19:50.400]  saying oh by the way that was all true the camps are real the devaluation of
[19:50.400 --> 19:56.400]  the dollars real the death camps are real you understand we're gonna have to

[24:33.520 --> 24:36.720]  misdemeanors won't be able to own firearms bigger than the 68 gun control
[24:36.720 --> 24:41.440]  act thumb prints face scans you'll have to have a mental health check and do a

[24:48.320 --> 24:54.440]  dominance they want a monopoly of power the battle is on so Obama that lying
[24:54.440 --> 24:59.800]  criminal that puppet sits up there and says hey there's no gun control coming
[24:59.800 --> 25:04.360]  only reasonable gun control but he calls reasonable total victim disarmament
[25:04.360 --> 25:10.960]  like DC and Chicago where this criminals from I want to just go ahead and play
[25:10.960 --> 25:17.280]  part of Lou Dobbs here it is gun sales have simply soared since the election of
[25:17.280 --> 25:22.680]  President Obama gun owners all across this country are concerned and many
[25:22.680 --> 25:27.320]  others are concerned that the Obama administration will curtail second
[25:27.320 --> 25:30.880]  amendment rights to bear arms this concern is based on the president's
[25:30.880 --> 25:35.520]  past record on gun rights and that of his nominee to be attorney general who
[25:35.520 --> 25:41.840]  will be running the Justice Department Eric Holder Bill Tucker with our report
[25:41.840 --> 25:49.720]  gun sales soared at the end of last year the FBI reported a 42% spike in
[25:49.720 --> 25:54.880]  background checks in November of last year versus November of 2007 background
[25:54.880 --> 26:01.400]  checks rose 24% in December versus December of 07 some gun shops report
[26:01.400 --> 26:05.720]  back orders for guns that are as long as 11 months for gun owners president
[26:05.720 --> 26:10.000]  Obama and his choice for Attorney General Eric Holder or a double threat to
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.560]  their second amendment rights last year holder went on record refusing to
[26:14.560 --> 26:18.400]  support what is essentially an individual's right to own a gun in
[26:18.400 --> 26:23.840]  Washington DC Eric Holder signed on to a brief before the Supreme Court the so
[26:23.840 --> 26:28.800]  called heller decision overturning the DC gun ban and he was in favor of keeping
[26:28.800 --> 26:32.600]  the gun ban he wants people in the District of Columbia to go to jail if
[26:32.600 --> 26:36.960]  they have a handgun after the court ruled against the gun ban president Obama
[26:36.960 --> 26:40.920]  says he will quote uphold the constitutional rights of law-abiding
[26:40.920 --> 26:46.120]  gun owners hunters and sportsmen but as witnessed in the surge of gun sales
[26:46.120 --> 26:50.360]  gun owners don't think so they're worried their second amendment rights are
[26:50.360 --> 26:54.960]  about to come under assault the president has tried to ease those concerns
[26:54.960 --> 26:59.720]  saying he supports enacting quote common-sense laws like closing the gun
[26:59.720 --> 27:03.920]  show loophole and improving our background check system so that guns do
[27:03.920 --> 27:08.040]  not fall into the hands of terrorists stop right there stop right there they
[27:08.040 --> 27:11.640]  say the Americans think their second amendment may be coming under attack
[27:11.640 --> 27:16.160]  it's always under attack they're attacking it at every level shutting down
[27:16.160 --> 27:19.800]  gun shops harassing people trying to stop importation whatever they can do
[27:19.800 --> 27:25.160]  bureaucratically outside law but when you hear oh getting rid of gun show
[27:25.160 --> 27:27.960]  loopholes that means not being able to transfer firearms to family or anybody
[27:27.960 --> 27:32.920]  else registering everything and the other comment you know was about tracking
[27:32.920 --> 27:36.520]  gun sales better that's registering and I have the bills I have all the bills
[27:36.520 --> 27:39.160]  right in front of me we're covering them later after I take some calls on the
[27:39.160 --> 27:43.240]  FEMA camp issue then I'm going back into the FEMA camps back into all of it
[27:43.240 --> 27:47.200]  hurt memo is going to be in studio coming up in an hour and a half and then
[27:47.200 --> 27:53.720]  in the last hour today we have joining us Jordan Maxwell on the 29th day of
[27:53.720 --> 28:00.000]  January 2009 back to the newscast guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.720]  or criminals groups advocating for gun rights say mr. Obama's efforts would
[28:04.720 --> 28:10.000]  instead make gun ownership expensive and bureaucratic as an example of their
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.920]  concerns they note that in the Illinois Senate mr. Obama supported a 500%
[28:14.920 --> 28:20.240]  increase in the federal tax on firearms and ammunition they are very concerned
[28:20.240 --> 28:24.840]  about efforts that might be undertaken by this administration or the new
[28:24.840 --> 28:30.480]  Congress that would ban certain firearms or put restrictions on the ability of
[28:30.480 --> 28:34.960]  law abiding Americans to purchase firearms they also point to president
[28:34.960 --> 28:39.240]  Obama's support of micro stamping that is having a gun imprinted bullet with an
[28:39.240 --> 28:43.560]  identifiable mark a process that researchers including the University of
[28:43.560 --> 28:48.400]  California Davis and the National Academies of Science say is not currently
[28:48.400 --> 28:53.280]  viable in other states there have been separate efforts to put serial numbers
[28:53.280 --> 28:58.960]  on bullets which also draws skepticism as being unworkable and expensive it's
[28:58.960 --> 29:04.640]  prohibitively expensive but that's that's the goal the goal is to go ahead
[29:04.640 --> 29:10.200]  and make everybody hang their guns on the wall because they won't be able to
[29:10.200 --> 29:15.240]  afford to buy ammunition now the two groups strongly behind the push for
[29:15.240 --> 29:19.920]  micro stamping or the Brady campaign and the coalition to end gun violence
[29:19.920 --> 29:23.240]  all right I'll stop there we'll come back and put the rest up and go to your calls
[29:23.240 --> 29:28.240]  to analyze it yeah a sword snickers already passed this the micro stamping
[29:28.240 --> 29:32.480]  will force all the guns manufactured in the country even if it's done in one big
[29:32.480 --> 29:35.600]  state like California that's where they adopt all the standards for the rest of
[29:35.600 --> 29:42.080]  the nation that in New York to adopt it and then that will ban all the sales of
[29:42.080 --> 29:46.160]  guns that don't stamp the bullets that don't stamp the casings and just an
[29:46.160 --> 29:52.560]  another way to shut it down we'll be right back we're on the March the

[33:50.160 --> 33:54.960]  guns they create the perception of that and then it isn't registration it's

[34:11.760 --> 34:16.960]  restamping of the Brady campaign and the coalition to end gun violence
[34:16.960 --> 34:22.000]  coalition also supports numbering each and every bullet made and no one in the
[34:22.000 --> 34:25.920]  gun community understands the logic of that one nor even how it can be done in
[34:25.920 --> 34:31.200]  fact it's worth noting here that 75% of the violent crime in this country does
[34:31.200 --> 34:36.400]  not involve the use of a gun and there are other considerations here but
[34:36.400 --> 34:42.960]  normally and you know I talked about being over the past weekend picking up a
[34:42.960 --> 34:48.880]  shotgun at the Gator guns in southern Florida and West Palm Beach in hearing
[34:48.880 --> 34:54.480]  about these stories of guns being back-ordered and ammunition not available
[34:54.480 --> 34:58.560]  and it's we're finding out it's true across the entire country and you'd
[34:58.560 --> 35:02.360]  like to be able to say to folks simmer down there what's your concern you know
[35:02.360 --> 35:06.600]  these are just crazy rumors it turns out they're not just crazy really crazy
[35:06.600 --> 35:12.120]  rumors exactly right there's reason for concern this is amazing and I and I
[35:12.120 --> 35:17.600]  appreciate it thank you very much all right we're gonna turn you can see the
[35:17.600 --> 35:21.240]  rest of the newscast we haven't linked up on info wars dot com right now in
[35:21.240 --> 35:25.040]  prison planet dot com I'm gonna take calls now and then in the next hour I'm
[35:25.040 --> 35:31.400]  gonna get into the full-scale attack never before seen it anything near this
[35:31.400 --> 35:36.360]  and at any level near this in u.s. history against the second amendment
[35:36.360 --> 35:41.800]  while the Pentagon psyops running the country out of north com tell you over
[35:41.800 --> 35:46.280]  and over again this is not an assault this is not an attack stand down so they
[35:46.280 --> 35:51.440]  can overrun our republic's positions this is military attack the Pentagon
[35:51.440 --> 35:54.720]  doesn't work for the u.s. it works for offshore banks the White House is a
[35:54.720 --> 35:58.640]  puppet of all of this we are in global receivership and they can't have their
[35:58.640 --> 36:04.320]  slaves being armed they have to come after your guns so that when the rioting
[36:04.320 --> 36:07.560]  and the breakdown of society happens they have laws saying well your guns
[36:07.560 --> 36:12.720]  aren't registered you didn't get a license nationwide Texas Arizona Vermont
[36:12.720 --> 36:16.320]  everywhere where the second amendment still strong they are coming and the
[36:16.320 --> 36:21.280]  police will say hey I'm just following orders it's the law I've talked to so
[36:21.280 --> 36:24.840]  many police say well I'm for the second amendment unless they pass a law you
[36:24.840 --> 36:28.440]  can't pass a law overturning free speech or the second amendment or the fourth
[36:28.440 --> 36:32.800]  amendment but they're doing it notice everything is happening and everybody
[36:32.800 --> 36:35.400]  said oh the Supreme Court ruling says we have an individual right but it said
[36:35.400 --> 36:41.520]  but they can also curtail it by law the ruling was against the second amendment
[36:41.520 --> 36:49.760]  you understand that you understand that look at how they're ruling against the
[36:49.760 --> 36:55.200]  first and against the fourth on every issue right now I know how to read what
[36:55.200 --> 37:02.840]  they said and what they did it just said that you can't completely outright
[37:02.840 --> 37:06.560]  banned somebody's guns and that's what Obama said he said well I'm I'm for
[37:06.560 --> 37:11.000]  reasonable gun control you know I'm not saying we can unilaterally ban them all
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.880]  that's a quote on the web and a speech ban them all in one day we've just got
[37:14.880 --> 37:20.840]  to restrict them through law so the print so the Supreme Court they said oh
[37:20.840 --> 37:23.840]  it ruled for the second amendment no all the previous rulings have been a
[37:23.840 --> 37:27.200]  hundred percent second amendment being individual right like the first 10 Bill
[37:27.200 --> 37:32.120]  of Rights they're all individual the new rulings says oh yeah it's an individual
[37:32.120 --> 37:40.160]  right if you jump through all of our hoops and if we think it's okay so that's
[37:40.160 --> 37:44.920]  coming up let's go to your call Steve in Tennessee you're on the air
[37:44.920 --> 37:51.160]  how you doing mr. Jones welcome thank you thank you well basically I want to
[37:51.160 --> 37:55.600]  say this I voted for a bomber you know I'm a young black man but uh but
[37:55.600 --> 37:59.760]  basically after you know just just looking at him and in exerting him you
[37:59.760 --> 38:03.360]  right you know he's basically a puppet I was caught up in the hype just like the
[38:03.360 --> 38:09.240]  majority of black people and uh and not just black man it's not just black folks
[38:09.240 --> 38:14.000]  that caught up in the hype yeah yeah yeah yeah and and um and as far as a
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.760]  black man as far as a black man being being being president you know you know
[38:18.760 --> 38:24.920]  I'm an American and I love my I love my country itself or itself or it's over
[38:24.920 --> 38:29.440]  really the most oppressed people in this country are black men and American
[38:29.440 --> 38:35.800]  white women and and and I really think I really think that Obama is being set up
[38:35.800 --> 38:40.280]  and they're gonna no brain race back into the issue because the economy in two
[38:40.280 --> 38:45.560]  years I think it's going to collapse and we're gonna have a mirror or something
[38:45.560 --> 38:50.480]  of this standard this uh no that's it they never they never do something that
[38:50.480 --> 38:54.120]  looks good on the surface for good they're gonna set it up make it look
[38:54.120 --> 38:58.040]  like Obama's running everything create racial strife and then blame everything
[38:58.040 --> 39:02.400]  on him when he is a wicked globalist but he's only a front man and then it'll
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.680]  all be about Obama instead of the actual controllers of the system and the
[39:07.680 --> 39:11.560]  actual controllers as you constantly point out at international bankers but
[39:11.560 --> 39:16.640]  but most Americans don't they don't realize that the Federal Reserve is
[39:16.640 --> 39:22.000]  80% privately owned and creates money out of nothing and then and then charges
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.240]  us interest on the money that they're basically they did that basically they
[39:26.240 --> 39:30.680]  magically create what do you think of and that's why they rule the world for
[39:30.680 --> 39:34.040]  that fraud that's light of hand what do you think of them openly announcing
[39:34.040 --> 39:37.720]  FEMA camps but putting the spin on it that well it's a place for you to live
[39:37.720 --> 39:44.920]  and stay for your safety on the on the on the FEMA camp issue I'm kind of I'm
[39:44.920 --> 39:50.520]  kind of split down the middle because because because the FEMA camps because
[39:50.520 --> 39:55.960]  the FEMA camps they also can be used for for for for a good you know this is a
[39:55.960 --> 40:01.000]  like another another net that's the whole point see how they make it look
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.320]  good but I but yeah and they're acting like they just now set it all up but we
[40:05.320 --> 40:11.000]  know it's been set up for bad uses okay okay and I and and and and and the
[40:11.000 --> 40:16.800]  treasury and it and the secretary treasury he the dog he he he doesn't pay
[40:16.800 --> 40:21.880]  his taxes guys you know he gets appointed and and and you know the system
[40:21.880 --> 40:25.960]  is this is this really is this really messed up and I wish that people would
[40:25.960 --> 40:31.000]  take more initiative to inform yourself and actually mobilize and become more
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.480]  militant and and you know and and get back our rights in the second amendment
[40:35.480 --> 40:42.000]  right it's for it's for it's for it's for it's for of course it's of course to
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.920]  protect yourself if it but but the main reason for the second amendment is this
[40:46.920 --> 40:50.520]  in case the government gets too big the people have the arms to overthrow the
[40:50.520 --> 40:54.320]  government absolutely and that's what the founding fathers said and the FBI now
[40:54.320 --> 40:58.160]  says that's terrorism I appreciate your call to the everything Steve Jim in
[40:58.160 --> 41:04.200]  Colorado you're on the air worldwide yeah wow thanks for taking the call out
[41:04.200 --> 41:10.360]  yes sir the news yesterday was unreal and just just real scary people that are
[41:10.360 --> 41:14.600]  hurry up and wake up I just need 30 seconds and maybe you've seen this
[41:14.600 --> 41:20.560]  movie maybe you haven't I was relaxing last night watching HBO and you know I
[41:20.560 --> 41:23.800]  go to the movies despite the fact that it's 90% programming and
[41:23.800 --> 41:29.400]  desensitization but I was watching a movie called children of men it's a
[41:29.400 --> 41:34.440]  2006 movie with Clive Owen and Julianne Moore yeah it's everybody's been
[41:34.440 --> 41:38.920]  sterilized by design by the government yeah it's set in a dystopian
[41:38.920 --> 41:46.240]  2027 London setting and America's on fire it's an epidemic that has led to
[41:46.240 --> 41:52.280]  worldwide infertility and there's no kids born for the last 18 years everyone
[41:52.280 --> 41:56.680]  is in shock and scared around the world there's war in every country total
[41:56.680 --> 42:02.200]  prison camps worldwide signs on the road telling people the title tale and it's
[42:02.200 --> 42:07.200]  just so sick brothers it's totally those signs are in Austin they've now
[42:07.200 --> 42:11.400]  suddenly all over the country put up big flashing billboards saying tattle on
[42:11.400 --> 42:14.720]  your neighbors it's now happening why that's why I brought that up I mean it's
[42:14.720 --> 42:18.520]  totally prophetic Alex is totally commissioned by the CIA it's very
[42:18.520 --> 42:24.400]  realistic and they say start of the film they say twice at the start of the
[42:24.400 --> 42:28.240]  film that the government is staging the terror attacks and I actually know a
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.040]  director who knows why I caught that line and they but they didn't say it
[42:32.040 --> 42:35.640]  about America was about Britain and they just made it sound like it's normal you
[42:35.640 --> 42:39.280]  know but they will be here of course it's not normal but unlike most CIA movies
[42:39.280 --> 42:44.280]  that I've seen you know this one is very realistic if people want to
[42:44.280 --> 42:47.280]  understand what we are desperately fighting against they just need to watch
[42:47.280 --> 42:52.480]  that movie with an open mind because it's it's real I listen I appreciate your
[42:52.480 --> 42:56.200]  call yeah if you watch children of men they have big ghettos for the poor
[42:56.200 --> 43:00.120]  people in the collapse society and then they just randomly grab large amounts
[43:00.120 --> 43:05.360]  every day and take them to death camps and then they execute people then they
[43:05.360 --> 43:09.240]  put some of them in the camp that's exactly how it worked in Russia everywhere
[43:09.240 --> 43:12.960]  else I happen to know a director who knows that Mexican director who's very
[43:12.960 --> 43:19.280]  well accomplished you made children of men and it is not CIA propaganda you see
[43:19.280 --> 43:23.280]  Hollywood is not completely controlled by the New World Order there are a lot of
[43:23.280 --> 43:27.640]  prominent directors who've had four five six seven eight ten or more big hits who
[43:27.640 --> 43:32.480]  can finally make their own film if you can get it distributed you've got the
[43:32.480 --> 43:36.480]  big name you've got the money you can finance it and if you don't go over
[43:36.480 --> 43:41.480]  budget that's how the contracts work then you get final cut and you know a
[43:41.480 --> 43:45.580]  scanner darkly is anti-New World Order I consulted on it I'm in it with
[43:45.580 --> 43:57.000]  Keanu Reeves and on a writer and others so Woody Harrelson and others and that
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.640]  the people say well why is there a new order imaging in this because because I
[44:00.640 --> 44:05.080]  consulted on the film because we're showing you the New World Order is the
[44:05.080 --> 44:08.880]  bad guys it's not subliminal it's right out in the open you know wearing an all
[44:08.880 --> 44:20.560]  seeing eye on the guy's t-shirt on a downy junior so you see that that's
[44:20.560 --> 44:24.440]  people in the culture in the system that don't like this that are able to get
[44:24.440 --> 44:30.360]  films out through fiction there's gonna be a film called the New World Order that
[44:30.360 --> 44:33.400]  I'm in that's a documentary that's gonna be airing on a major cable network I'm
[44:33.400 --> 44:37.360]  just gonna leave it at that well actually it's been in the newspaper now so
[44:37.360 --> 44:40.960]  I can talk some about it but it's the main selection of the South by Southwest
[44:40.960 --> 44:47.720]  this year and it's the first fair film I've ever seen Discovery Channel maker
[44:47.720 --> 44:53.880]  the guy that made some kind of monster and Brothers Keeper and Paradise Lost
[44:53.880 --> 44:59.080]  you know he's in the very top echelon of documentary filmmakers in the world
[44:59.840 --> 45:06.240]  they made a was it three and a half or four million dollar series that I was in
[45:06.240 --> 45:11.240]  and they basically told him well we want this to be more of a you know hit piece
[45:11.240 --> 45:17.880]  against Alex Jones and he said look it's fair and they said well it's not
[45:17.880 --> 45:24.840]  gonna air that's the first thing he's ever had ever made where it where he was
[45:24.840 --> 45:33.520]  told that's it it's not gonna air so there's major battles I'm I'm a witness
[45:33.520 --> 45:37.160]  to it and what's happening is Hollywood comes and checks out my information
[45:37.160 --> 45:42.800]  checks out what I'm doing and then the major filmmakers make films and then the
[45:42.800 --> 45:49.160]  bosses of Hollywood will kill it or the government will kill it so there's a
[45:49.160 --> 45:54.280]  major rebellion the directors the actors don't like what's going on and
[45:54.280 --> 46:04.120]  they're held hostage basically but you know you could call it predictive
[46:04.120 --> 46:08.840]  programming with shows like The Prisoner and all these other films they've had
[46:08.840 --> 46:13.840]  about camps and things and some of that has been propaganda like a film like I
[46:13.840 --> 46:20.120]  am legend is definitely conditioning where a vaccine to cure cancer kills the
[46:20.120 --> 46:24.200]  majority of the population but some that are immune turned into these raving
[46:24.200 --> 46:31.840]  lunatics if you see the movie oh what's the movie they made out of Firefly
[46:32.720 --> 46:39.200]  serenity where the government is putting Prozac into the air an advanced
[46:39.200 --> 46:45.560]  prozac on a colony planet a terraform planet and it kills once it builds up in
[46:45.560 --> 46:49.960]  their system 99% of people but the 1% it makes them go completely psychopathic
[46:49.960 --> 46:54.400]  that's actually in government studies that that's a way to boil it down more
[46:54.400 --> 46:58.920]  simply prozac does make a percentage people go completely psychopathic but
[46:58.920 --> 47:01.480]  it's more than that they found with other studies that there's always people
[47:01.480 --> 47:05.680]  immune to what they do and they've found that they're conditioning their
[47:05.680 --> 47:10.840]  brainwashing actually counteracts and actually breaks some people a minority
[47:10.840 --> 47:15.400]  instead of being zombies most people are in a dream state the brainwaves of the
[47:15.400 --> 47:18.640]  general public in the United States and England and Europe from watching more
[47:18.640 --> 47:21.840]  than four hours of TV a day are now different brainwaves than we have 50
[47:21.840 --> 47:25.760]  years ago we're in it most people are in a dream like state they're actually
[47:25.760 --> 47:29.960]  hypnotized but they found that they're conditioning I've seen the studies on
[47:29.960 --> 47:35.200]  this with some people actually short circuits that and gets people even more
[47:35.200 --> 47:41.160]  almost an allergy to propaganda and I definitely have that I mean it just I
[47:41.160 --> 47:44.800]  don't know it gets into more complex issues most of you listening have an
[47:44.800 --> 47:49.640]  allergy to this type of garbage and that's really what it is it's their
[47:49.640 --> 47:57.320]  very propaganda that woke you up it's so obvious and see as things get scary as
[47:57.320 --> 48:00.760]  things come together more and more people are gonna fight against the Lord
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.000]  but also others are going to get scared and decide to join forces with it out
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.760]  of fear they're afraid of the big bully they're afraid of the abuser so
[48:08.760 --> 48:13.960]  they're going to go act like they're enthusiastically working with it and
[48:13.960 --> 48:17.200]  they'll make excuses they'll psychologically do whatever mental
[48:17.200 --> 48:22.560]  gymnastics and back flips they have to rationalize what they're doing you've
[48:22.560 --> 48:29.200]  also got sociopath psychopaths sadistic sociopaths and psychopaths controlled
[48:29.200 --> 48:34.480]  psychopaths genius psychopaths that whole group who tend to be in the command
[48:34.480 --> 48:38.760]  positions and then also enforcer positions so they're at the both the top
[48:38.760 --> 48:44.160]  and the bottom and then you've just got all the cowardly people and the greedy
[48:44.160 --> 48:47.600]  people kind of in the middle it's like an Oreo cookie you've got psychopaths at
[48:47.600 --> 48:50.360]  the bottom psychopaths at the top and kind of like the big cream filling of
[48:50.360 --> 48:57.640]  just cowardly rationalizing thieves and and and people who can be bought off for
[48:57.640 --> 49:04.200]  the almighty dollar and what happens is these systems accelerate into their
[49:04.200 --> 49:13.560]  final phases the Oreo cookie part eats the cream filling so after the system's
[49:13.560 --> 49:18.520]  done dominating the general public and enslaving then it eats itself then
[49:18.520 --> 49:24.040]  after that phase there's a psycho war and the psychos once they have total
[49:24.040 --> 49:26.960]  power and massive death camps and because I mean that's the ultimate
[49:26.960 --> 49:30.960]  expression of control freaks it's why it always manifests itself it's a human
[49:30.960 --> 49:36.320]  condition when we hit rock bottom that then you will always have a few king
[49:36.320 --> 49:39.520]  psychopaths who are paranoid and then they'll mainly start killing their own
[49:39.520 --> 49:42.720]  people they kill their people when they first get in power then they kill and
[49:42.720 --> 49:47.480]  enslave the general public then there's an accelerated even larger purge purge
[49:47.480 --> 49:53.080]  after purge after purge after purge purge purge purge purge purge purge as the
[49:53.080 --> 49:59.240]  hyper dominant psychopaths do battle with each other and then generally after
[49:59.240 --> 50:02.520]  the hyper dominant psychopaths have have have finally gone through those three
[50:02.520 --> 50:07.360]  phases then they look outward and start running mass wars and that's generally
[50:07.360 --> 50:11.000]  how they fall because they're so used to always winning dominating their own
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.520]  country dominating their own people dominating their own inner party then
[50:14.520 --> 50:18.040]  they look outward and they say okay let's start dominating other nations and
[50:18.040 --> 50:22.120]  they think they're invincible and then generally rebellion at home and
[50:22.120 --> 50:28.720]  overreaching military operations outside the black hole nation that's what I
[50:28.720 --> 50:37.080]  determined it's a nation that enters a hellish vortex then it falls but they

[54:29.840 --> 54:37.560]  and they're doing it let's go to Kelly and Georgia Kelly you're on the air
[54:37.560 --> 54:41.880]  hi Alex this is my first time calling in I just want to tell you thank you for
[54:41.880 --> 54:49.120]  helping wake me up I it's hard to maintain a sense of humor in the midst of
[54:49.120 --> 54:53.000]  everything that's going on but I saw something on MSNBC this morning that was
[54:53.000 --> 54:58.240]  kind of amusing and it's in Texas so I don't know if it's one of your listeners
[54:58.240 --> 55:02.800]  or what but if somebody took one of those large highway signs that you know
[55:02.800 --> 55:07.640]  the flash like you know whatever might come along there but it says let's be
[55:07.640 --> 55:11.600]  clear they can as I said a decade ago they would put them up and started out
[55:11.600 --> 55:15.920]  with save kidnapped children right old ladies been lost Alzheimer's but now
[55:15.920 --> 55:20.960]  it's report illegal guns report terrorism see there they phase everything in with
[55:20.960 --> 55:25.440]  a good reason on the surface yep and then bring in the evil go ahead well
[55:25.440 --> 55:29.480]  this one someone had changed the wording on it whatever from it was originally
[55:29.480 --> 55:37.920]  and it says caution zombies ahead not see zombies run zombies in area run and
[55:37.920 --> 55:42.440]  then it says like run for cold climates and then it says the end is near so
[55:42.440 --> 55:46.840]  somebody obviously sounds like somebody doing a joke instead of being serious
[55:46.840 --> 55:52.320]  and saying police state billboard fascism yeah yeah they probably should have
[55:52.320 --> 55:55.280]  put something like that but then then it wouldn't have shown up on it all over
[55:55.280 --> 56:00.800]  the country people are also vandalizing speed cameras red light cameras so this
[56:00.800 --> 56:06.360]  of the resistance is beginning to mount yep yep another thing too is on the on
[56:06.360 --> 56:11.320]  ABC News last night I was watching the report about the CIA guy and they had
[56:11.320 --> 56:14.320]  someone on there from the council and formulations and I just think it's funny
[56:14.320 --> 56:18.320]  that you still have people who denied that that even exist but then they'll
[56:18.320 --> 56:22.120]  have him on mainstream news and have you know across the bottom spokesperson for
[56:22.120 --> 56:26.200]  council and formulations or whatever so and supposedly he would drug the women
[56:26.200 --> 56:29.920]  in videotape raping on this why they're talking about indicting him but I mean
[56:29.920 --> 56:34.080]  who do you think a CIA section chief is going to be right I mean anybody at that
[56:34.080 --> 56:38.440]  level now isn't it you know clearly knows and about 9-11 or was involved yeah
[56:38.440 --> 56:43.360]  and we've got old CIA section chiefs coming out like Bill Christiansen of he
[56:43.360 --> 56:48.280]  was the Berlin office I mean that's high level saying 9-11's an inside job here
[56:48.280 --> 56:54.120]  on the show and you know mr. Bear and others coming out saying all the
[56:54.120 --> 57:00.280]  evidence says inside job but most of the good guys are speaking out but I mean
[57:00.280 --> 57:02.920]  now it's just a bunch of people that want to write children or women I mean
[57:02.920 --> 57:07.640]  that's that's who the new allot are they they're psychos a smart psycho doesn't go
[57:07.640 --> 57:12.520]  out with a yellow Volkswagen to pick up teenage girls at shopping malls okay
[57:12.520 --> 57:16.760]  that's your low level the smart ones and main criminology teaches this is
[57:16.760 --> 57:21.480]  police should know this that that smart psychos want uniforms they want badges
[57:21.480 --> 57:26.520]  they want power so that they can't be caught and that's all it is I mean that's
[57:26.520 --> 57:31.560]  who runs things now is psycho killers right and that kind of leads me into my
[57:31.560 --> 57:35.440]  next comment which is I know you haven't talked about it today but about the
[57:35.440 --> 57:39.680]  draft and that was you know that's kind of been a subject lately too and I've
[57:39.680 --> 57:44.000]  got a 14-year-old son and I've always said you know if they start a draft and
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.600]  just you know you just tell them you're gay or whatever and then I started
[57:47.600 --> 57:51.720]  thinking about it because I guess before the inauguration what had to been like
[57:51.720 --> 57:56.160]  through four weeks ago I saw a headline somewhere that don't ask don't tell
[57:56.160 --> 58:01.400]  policy will likely be taken away under Obama oh yeah they're gonna make we'll
[58:01.400 --> 58:05.800]  see they're also oh it's a quality for women with you know they're gonna be
[58:05.800 --> 58:10.280]  drafted to in the new legislation oh you get to go be a slave to isn't that
[58:10.280 --> 58:14.760]  fair yep yep so now you can't even use being homosexual excuse they just want
[58:14.760 --> 58:18.960]  to get everybody in see they make death and destruction a right oh abortion you
[58:18.960 --> 58:24.000]  get to kill your baby nobody's gonna take that away see oh you get to have
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.000]  suicide education then the suicide explodes teaching them how to commit
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.760]  suicide you see what I it's all psych warfare and the dumb teachers teaching
[58:31.760 --> 58:34.160]  at their compartmentalized they don't even know they're part of it good to
[58:34.160 --> 58:38.640]  hear from you Kelly all right more calls straight ahead and analysis of the

[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:24.440]  all of this now they're all concerned they know what's coming now I want to
[1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:27.200]  continue with a few more calls for folks at the moment longest that I'm gonna get
[1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:32.520]  into again if I just calmly get up here and report this news it doesn't do its
[1:01:32.520 --> 1:01:35.760]  service I mean I need to be howling screaming pulling my hair out somehow to
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:38.880]  get your attention so that you'll get other people's attention it's really
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:43.960]  happening massive gun control bills hitting on every side getting massive
[1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:48.840]  sponsorship Obama will sign these if they get to his desk what do you do then
[1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:53.800]  I mean I'm not turning my semi-autos in I'm not going and being thumb printed and
[1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:59.600]  face printed and registered to own guns it's all there it's all happening it and
[1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:02.480]  the FEMA camps I'm gonna get back into that more detail Paul Watson's doing a
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:05.560]  big detailed part two on that right now it'll be on prisonpunna.com very soon
[1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:11.360]  let's talk to Philip in Tennessee you're on the air
[1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:15.840]  how much you do a great job you've done more in five years than the John Burke
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:21.600]  Society did in the previous 50 hey referencing HR 645 I don't want to
[1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:27.960]  turn this segment into Cisco and Ebert but have you seen the movie Defiance no
[1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:33.520]  I've heard about it okay it's a pretty good movie as far as movies go basic
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:37.640]  theme there based on a true story is don't get on the bus don't turn in your
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:43.000]  gun you don't go to the camp so I think there's a good message there as far as
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:50.040]  a Hollywood movie is concerned also a HR 645 I noticed in section two the
[1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:55.240]  establishment of the emergency center is to have a centralized location among
[1:02:55.240 --> 1:03:01.680]  other things to have a coordination for your faith-based organizations so this
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:06.600]  ties in with the clergy response team and this sort of thing which is also
[1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:10.080]  referenced in the movie Defiance we're gonna go to the camp and we're all
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:14.560]  gonna go in one happy flock and we're gonna have a nice we always told people
[1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:19.720]  historically in every example they the British 200 years ago in Africa and
[1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:23.520]  other places in the United States other than the colonies they would say we're
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:27.680]  taking you here for your safety and they're gonna have newscast first with
[1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:30.960]  the homeless people that have lost their houses there's exactly as I said they
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:35.640]  would do it because it's history I'm not that smart I mean this is classical
[1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:38.560]  tyranny that's why we're always right we know the next step so they're gonna
[1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:41.680]  have rock bands and country bands playing at the camps it'll be on the news
[1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:47.480]  they'll have idiots clamoring to be in the camps but again it sets the precedent
[1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:52.360]  huge FEMA camps with Briggs on them controlling every major region it says a
[1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:57.520]  major camp in every 10 FEMA regions tied into smaller camps if you read in
[1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:02.600]  there camps on national parks how long do we tell people that was the plan we
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:07.200]  knew all this in 1990 especially with the base closures because then it came
[1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:11.840]  out from our sources and Mark Kornke's on record making films saying this that
[1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:16.440]  they were keeping those refurbished to be camps and now it's in the bill see
[1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:20.440]  this is key intelligence for us because the whole bill confirms everything we've
[1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:25.360]  said and lets us know that our analysis of the enemy attack profile was accurate
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:30.760]  this is a key piece of intelligence yes in the end of reference what's going on
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:33.800]  just north of me in Kentucky they have the ice storm now they're saying that
[1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:39.440]  those people may be out of a power and water till mid-February so after a
[1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:42.880]  little bit of free time those people may be clamoring to get on a bus and go
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:47.160]  somewhere so this is a wake-up call for people to have burpees on hand you can
[1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:52.060]  use ice and snow stay there stay there I'm gonna come back to you and see how
[1:04:52.060 --> 1:04:56.800]  this works they have these FEMA drills they bring in Mexican troops into New
[1:04:56.800 --> 1:05:03.880]  Orleans it all just sets the precedent stop wasting your time struggling with
[1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:07.040]  everything you're trying to learn learning should be a pleasure not
[1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:10.680]  torture the school of phenomenal memory gives you the training and tools you

[1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:17.520]  the bankers rob and loot it basically everything they know the public starting
[1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:21.920]  to wake up to it so they're moving in the classical tyranny I'm gonna go back to
[1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:26.680]  Philip in Tennessee here just a moment to finish up with how they're just
[1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:30.120]  conditioning everybody to go under federal control during emergencies and
[1:08:30.120 --> 1:08:33.560]  now admitting that the PIMS are dual use for the American people that Homeland
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:37.240]  Security is to be used in a regular army against the American people in combat
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:42.600]  that's official Army doctrine now and it's in mainstream news Wall Street

[1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:50.960]  Chris is in Louisiana and says he only has five minutes left on his lunch break

[1:08:54.240 --> 1:08:58.680]  what he's calling in about Chris go ahead
[1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:06.160]  Chris and Louisiana go ahead yes yes Alex I was calling in regards to the
[1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:11.000]  military exercises they're being conducted with the NOPD down here I
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:17.240]  don't have a lot of time to talk but they didn't alert the public I received
[1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:21.960]  phone calls last night from friends and family they were kind of on edge because
[1:09:21.960 --> 1:09:29.600]  they reported black helicopters flying at low altitudes and I told them it was
[1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:35.440]  probably just a military exercise and sure enough two days after their
[1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:44.280]  campaign started they released on wwl.com that residents on notice
[1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:50.840]  overhead police training and just goes into discussing the operations yeah it's
[1:09:50.840 --> 1:09:54.720]  further conditioning the public for military occupation we always told
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:57.360]  people that's why all these secret drills would be done but they would
[1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:02.040]  later admit they were doing buying off local police this is a military takeover
[1:10:02.040 --> 1:10:06.760]  just acclimating it's all dog training it humans are very similar it's all
[1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:10.640]  animals like a training a bear they're just acclimating us it's
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:17.760]  domestication it's institutionalization wwl radio correct all right yeah that's
[1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:22.560]  the big 50,000 want blowtorch we will go to their site we'll get that posted up
[1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:26.720]  on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com what specifically do they say they're
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:33.120]  doing well I actually contacted the NOPD part of me before I had to go to work
[1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:37.120]  this morning test them if they were actually gonna be conducting any type
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:42.120]  of ground exercises like I know that they have in the past in Indianapolis
[1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:46.560]  Indiana and they really didn't give me any information I actually called
[1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:51.560]  Congressman Steve Scalise and they told me they didn't have any information
[1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:56.080]  yeah I'm surprised I didn't tell you it didn't exist right right well you know
[1:10:56.080 --> 1:11:05.400]  if the Coast Guard conducts rescue operations on Lake Pontchartrain
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:09.920]  which is for those that aren't familiar with the area down here by New Orleans
[1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:16.120]  correct they'll uh announced that a week before and then you know small to large
[1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:22.720]  crowds sometimes will gather to witness the yeah sure this is done yeah they'll
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:26.480]  always pick a place by a nursing home they'll buy a police building they'll
[1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:30.960]  blow the building up for a shy op they'll have operatives there videotaping the
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:34.680]  public response so when they really take over a city hall if they have to or
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:38.720]  they really throw out a governor that's in PDD 51 when they were when they
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:42.360]  really running off the public will stand down thinking it's just another drill
[1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:46.360]  right and the thing that disturbs me is that's right told a few friends and
[1:11:46.360 --> 1:11:50.600]  family last night that this is probably an exercise it was almost like a thigh
[1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:56.800]  relief and I tried to express to them that this is all psychological to step
[1:11:56.800 --> 1:12:01.720]  the military on the street and did they deny that but but they've already had
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:06.400]  their guns confiscated I mean they've already seen that so well to be honest
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:12.040]  with you some people are listening but unfortunately the majority aren't but
[1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:17.200]  we've seen army documents New Orleans was a laboratory and that's why an
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:20.680]  experiment that's why they ordered the stand down of local police that's why
[1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:25.080]  they held the the other rescue workers in the Coast Guard and Walmart back it was
[1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:28.720]  a shy opt to see how the public respond to then claim people didn't have enough
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:33.640]  power enough money quote we screwed up give us more power problem reaction
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:38.520]  solution and then I did see references to it now being a laboratory zone where
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:43.880]  they brought in Dutch troops Mexican troops all of it and so you know that
[1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:48.920]  is now a hot zone where they're running operations I mean as you know the gun
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:53.640]  confiscations right well okay I appreciate speaking with you Alex and
[1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:59.240]  anything else you wanted to add thank you well not really I just wanted to I
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:06.600]  sent an email to Aaron earlier and I actually posted it earlier on a social
[1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:13.120]  network that I belong to that kind of resurrected after the Info Wars network
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:22.960]  was disbanded and that is a snarkfarker at mean.com alright we'll get it up on
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:29.680]  Info Wars God bless you thanks for that report and again all of this is just a
[1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:34.360]  condition you but I mean they'll have an ice storm they'll have a tornado and
[1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:38.440]  suddenly the army shows up says anybody caught in the town will be shot you'll
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:45.640]  be arrested and that sets the precedent you know your child's caught with holes
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:49.720]  over the counter cough drops they give one to a friend they're arrested or
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:53.280]  they're fine to their feet or they're kicked out of school it's all zero
[1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:57.000]  tolerance it's all about letting us know we're prisoners what do you think
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.680]  getting on an airplane is them take your shoes off and not being able to have
[1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:02.600]  water not being able to have your toothpaste saying it could be a bomb
[1:14:02.600 --> 1:14:06.560]  it's about normal people having interactions with bureaucrats and
[1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:12.680]  paramilitary forces and and preparing us to be asked questions to be lined up to
[1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:15.640]  show our papers same thing in England it's happened to me it's happened to Steve
[1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:19.480]  Watson I've been in England over there one time since this was enacted and the
[1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:23.440]  cops walked up as I was videotaping in on the street and they said that we're
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:28.600]  putting you in a terror database it's all in video it's in terror storm Steve
[1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:33.000]  Watson's taking his girlfriend to a concert they're getting on a bus and
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  they come over and say give us your ID line up put you in a database and they
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:41.800]  were just doing it to random people and they admit now what is it two million
[1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:44.240]  people last time I saw in England put in the terror that no it's eight million
[1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:48.080]  excuse me eight million put the terror database check that memory fell
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:52.360]  sometimes I believe it's eight million a few months ago I saw in the news they're
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:57.360]  also now arresting anybody that videotapes the police all over the US all
[1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:01.520]  over England all over Canada all over Australia yeah they have all the same
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:05.280]  programs it's called head start here it's called six secure start in England
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:10.880]  it's called something else start in Canada in Australia they have not the
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:20.960]  animal ID system in Australia they have the livestock ID the national livestock
[1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:31.320]  ID so instead of national animal ID it's national livestock so it's an NL instead
[1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:39.400]  of and then the first two letters the acronym instead of in a it's all
[1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:45.320]  happening the bankers have unlimited money our tax money to understand they
[1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:49.840]  get our money through the taxes then they come with the federal forces and
[1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:54.760]  extract even more paying them with our money it's just a Ponzi scheme it's
[1:15:54.760 --> 1:16:01.240]  it's it's like made off to the power of a billion in total control just doing
[1:16:01.240 --> 1:16:07.880]  whatever they want all right going back to Philip in Tennessee go ahead Philip

[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:55.240]  incinerator with rail track and sightings in the state of Ohio yes I'm
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:17:00.720]  calling more for an informational return on this if anybody living in Ohio can
[1:17:00.720 --> 1:17:06.720]  more or less pinpoint this or get pictures of it item number two regarding
[1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:14.320]  mind control I was to the United States patent office website there is a patent
[1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:28.520]  number 5159703 which stand which indicates silent subliminal presentation

[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:06.580]  federally designated and controlled and they put the bar bar facing in that's
[1:18:06.580 --> 1:18:10.800]  been videotaped put on YouTube that hasn't been publicly admitted to be a
[1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:16.960]  camp by the government but we know it is okay now what we do know the the there's
[1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:23.280]  been two places that I've seen articles about incinerators one was in a
[1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:27.640]  northern California newspaper five years ago I can't remember the headline I
[1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:35.200]  do remember the headline six and a half years ago in the Rocky Mountain news and
[1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:38.520]  a few weeks ago I mentioned this when somebody called in and I said put it
[1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:42.000]  because I don't have time to find it again I actually tried a few weeks ago
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:46.360]  and didn't have time to look deep enough I can't remember the exact headline but
[1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:56.000]  it was something like governor says incinerators ready for mass outbreak is
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:00.720]  and that was the basic headline if somebody can find it again we'll post
[1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:04.680]  it on the main page as a flashback and info wars.com or prison planet.com or
[1:19:04.680 --> 1:19:07.400]  put it in the prison plan forum I said this a few weeks ago it's probably in
[1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:11.840]  there and I just didn't see it and they said yes we built emergency FEMA
[1:19:11.840 --> 1:19:17.680]  centers to burn 15,000 people I'm going from memory on this you know my memory
[1:19:17.680 --> 1:19:23.360]  is about 99% to burn incinerate 15,000 people a day the federal government
[1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:28.720]  built an incinerator outside Denver now Rocky Mountain news I read it on air
[1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:37.840]  probably 20 times when it came out in 2002 I believe so there you go you want
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:43.160]  news admitting incinerators there it is and my info is and they map it out in
[1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:46.440]  this bill that they're gonna have it at all these facilities they just don't
[1:19:46.440 --> 1:19:49.400]  mention it they say other uses but they're gonna have these in every town
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:55.480]  also some idiot posted a thing saying I'm lying about Highland Mall having a
[1:19:55.480 --> 1:20:00.480]  FEMA center in it hey Bob but just Google FEMA Center Highland Mall there's
[1:20:00.480 --> 1:20:05.440]  video of it. Today Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources January 29th 2009 goal

[1:20:36.120 --> 1:20:40.280]  programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to ensure bank deposits
[1:20:40.280 --> 1:20:44.520]  taxation and inflationary printing of the US dollar are inevitable pressures

[1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:36.160]  camps for you and your family but before I do that about a month ago I started
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:41.640]  getting phone calls at the office about FEMA taking over two large stores
[1:24:41.640 --> 1:24:46.000]  department stores and it shut down in Highland Mall and they pulled the names
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:49.120]  off the stores so I can't even tell you I never I don't go to the mall much I
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:53.920]  don't go to that mall it's in north east Austin rather not 35 but when I went
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:59.280]  out there to check it it was two major stores and FEMA was out there and you
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:02.240]  go knock on the door they say get back get out of here there's feds in there
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:08.200]  there's locals in there and I just mentioned it yesterday in passing that
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:13.440]  Highland Mall had this and somebody in the I believe it's the prison planet
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:19.960]  comment page on the FEMA camp article that Paul Watson wrote said that I was
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:23.480]  making it up and how dumb does Alex think we are that we wouldn't go to
[1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:28.560]  Highland Mall and check this well you must be as blind as a bat or this info
[1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:34.520]  agent not to know this now if you just Google FEMA Highland Mall you'll see
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:41.360]  mentions in the Austin Chronicle and the Austin American statesman an
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:45.160]  emergency outpost is what they're calling because they have all these
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:48.600]  little metastasized things outside their camps and their threat integration
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:52.800]  centers and you'll see local Austin activists that went out there and had
[1:25:52.800 --> 1:25:58.400]  the security guards threatened to throw them off now what they do is they move
[1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:01.600]  in with these oh Hurricane Ike's gonna hit and then after they leave they keep
[1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:05.640]  it open that they're taking over see these things all have dual and multiple
[1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:09.680]  use so they say oh we built a camp for emergencies and if the people riot and
[1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:13.360]  you know they'll show the newscast people begging to get into these and then
[1:26:13.360 --> 1:26:17.520]  that will sell the public that's a good thing Germany did that but they admit it
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:21.120]  is for political dissonance that's now in the legislation Congress has been
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:25.640]  threatened with martial law this is public so go ahead and play the audio
[1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:29.720]  we'll post this video and I'll play it again next hour when we go live at
[1:26:29.720 --> 1:26:33.680]  prisonplanet.tv so folks can actually watch it but here's one of the many
[1:26:33.680 --> 1:26:39.280]  videos at the one little FEMA center my only point was is that they're setting
[1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:42.400]  these up everywhere they say they're going to set them up everywhere this isn't
[1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:46.720]  one of the big ones this is a little node which practices and trains the locals
[1:26:46.720 --> 1:26:52.160]  to go under FEMA control here it is what are y'all doing here I just want to know
[1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:55.880]  I don't know what y'all are doing here will you tell me what's going on I will
[1:26:55.880 --> 1:27:04.120]  be more than happy as soon as you step outside. Sure is there a reason you're doing that?
[1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:10.120]  We just saw the FEMA camp and I thought y'all were part of the emergency or what's going on?
[1:27:10.120 --> 1:27:17.120]  Not the mall the store had already been shut down but is there some reason why he was here?
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:21.120]  In case I can't. In case what?
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:25.120]  Dude you're just a security guard. I'm a security guard.
[1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:31.120]  I'm sorry we're part of an organization that is just making sure everybody understands what's going on these days
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:36.120]  I don't understand why y'all are here though. I still didn't explain why y'all are here.
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:45.120]  So what kind of operations are going on inside? Just tell me what kind of operations are going on inside?
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:51.120]  Okay so all over the country they're putting these in there'll be a nice storm there'll be a hurricane coming and then they never leave
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:57.120]  and there's other videos I've seen guys there should be more videos than that there's one where it shows a homeland security bus
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:02.120]  and it shows FEMA buses and we can show folks that next hour.
[1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:08.120]  So I mean I told you FEMA moved in and put in a little command center with the local police.
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:12.120]  Yeah here it is. Here's the video of the buses and FEMA RVs.
[1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:16.120]  I mean you know I don't know what I'm supposed to do for you people.
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:23.120]  I mean the denial is just off the charts and I guess you're just blind as a bat if you claim you went out to Highland Mall and it isn't there.
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:29.120]  Okay and of course we've got people in these articles commenting going hey things are breaking down.
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:35.120]  We need the camps. We need a place to put all these people that are intent cities sprouting up all over the country from Michigan to California
[1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:38.120]  from Florida to New York.
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:43.120]  You know people who don't have money to pay their bills are freezing to death in their houses. They need to go to a warm camp.
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:51.120]  You can go read them. As I always said they would introduce it this way but if you read the fine print it is for insurrection.
[1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:55.120]  The Army War College had mentioned it. Northcom admits they're preparing to engage the American people.
[1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:59.120]  First they said 4,000 troops then 20,000 troops. Now they're saying 50,000 troops. It's on the nightly news.
[1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:03.120]  Getting you ready for this.
[1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:08.120]  And they've publicly signed deals with Canada and Mexico.
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:11.120]  It's in mainstream newspapers.
[1:29:11.120 --> 1:29:15.120]  Google Congress anger they were not consulted about troops sharing deal.
[1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:19.120]  I mean you can read these articles.
[1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:25.120]  Where Congress said last year we weren't consulted on foreign troops being used against the American people.
[1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:34.120]  I mean I saw deals. They were signing 7 years ago on this that I put in films with mainstream news articles.
[1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:37.120]  It's all siob, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:46.120]  So yes, Highland Mall has had two major department store buildings taken over by FEMA in Austin.
[1:29:46.120 --> 1:29:51.120]  There's a FEMA camp at the old airport. Got it? I got video of it and local news admitting it.
[1:29:51.120 --> 1:29:55.120]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.120 --> 1:30:01.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:05.120]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.

[1:31:01.120 --> 1:31:08.120]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:31:08.120 --> 1:31:12.120]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:31:12.120 --> 1:31:14.120]  Bin Laden. This is his M.O.
[1:31:14.120 --> 1:31:17.120]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:31:17.120 --> 1:31:24.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:31:24.120 --> 1:31:31.120]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:35.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:35.120 --> 1:31:42.120]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:31:42.120 --> 1:31:46.120]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[1:32:54.120 --> 1:33:01.120]  That's 800-409-5633 on the Web eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:33:24.120 --> 1:33:37.120]  Many a soldier shed his life's blood on my blade. The bastards hung me in the spring of 25, but I am still alive.
[1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:47.120]  They will be remembered as tyrants, and those of us that fought them as lovers of liberty.
[1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:59.120]  With the sea I did abide, I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico.
[1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:17.120]  I went all off to Pearl, Mexico, and up low, and when the arms broke, I said that I got killed, but I am still alive.
[1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:29.120]  I was a damn builder, across the street, deep and wide. We're stealing water in Colorado.
[1:34:29.120 --> 1:34:41.120]  A place called Boulder on the Wild Colorado. I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below.
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:50.120]  They better bring me in than they bring to the middle of the sound, but I am still alive.
[1:34:50.120 --> 1:34:59.120]  Always be around, and around, and around, and around.
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:16.120]  I love Johnny Cash, I fly a Starship, across the universe divine, and when I reach the other side,
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:28.120]  I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can. Perhaps I may become a highwayman again.
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:37.120]  Or I may simply be a single drop of rain, but I will remain.
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:41.120]  I'll be back again, and again, and again.
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:45.120]  Good guys will be back again and again to fight evil or progeny.
[1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:49.120]  Just like our ancestors fought them, and evil will be back again and again.
[1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:59.120]  It is the eternal contest, but evil is eternally playing the part of the loser, the pitiful losers.
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:07.120]  Satan is a cosmic con artist, as my grandfather would call him, a great loser.
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:16.120]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I know we have a lot of calls, but I'm going to get into the gun control, the gun banning.
[1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:21.120]  Rather than give you the history of the operation or why they want to do it, you know the object slavery.
[1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:28.120]  God, they want to have their way with us. They're just itching to attack us. They're just itching to go after us.
[1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:32.120]  Look at this, UK terror law to make photographing police illegal.
[1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:34.120]  There's a link to the British Journal of Photography.
[1:36:34.120 --> 1:36:42.120]  It says, photographing or videotaping police will result in 10-year prison sentence and or a fine.
[1:36:42.120 --> 1:36:47.120]  The true patriot knows one of our best weapons against police abuse and tyranny is the video camera.
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:55.120]  It's destroying their police state. They're not able to carry it out as they train their police to be attack dogs incrementally to go after the public.
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:36:57.120]  It's not working anymore.
[1:36:57.120 --> 1:37:00.120]  So they've been harassing and arresting and beating up photographers.
[1:37:00.120 --> 1:37:05.120]  There's all these countless videos in England and the U.S. of cops calling people cameras, but then somebody else has got a camera.
[1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:16.120]  Like in my film, Truth Rising, Lukradowski and others bravely are out there, but Tom Foddy bravely are out there.
[1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:22.120]  And these off-duty, well, retired police and the police coming back them up and say, your backpacks a bomb.
[1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:26.120]  We're going to say it's a bomb. We know it's not a bomb. We're going to say it's a bomb. Leave and turn your cameras off.
[1:37:26.120 --> 1:37:32.120]  And the uniform police show up, grab the camera and say, this is a gun.
[1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:36.120]  But thank God they had cameras down the street.
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:39.120]  So all that was caught on tape. This is a gun.
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:48.120]  Imagine the disrespect to himself, those officers engaged in to sit there and try to frame somebody and feel good about it.
[1:37:48.120 --> 1:37:50.120]  That's tyranny.
[1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:54.120]  So go ahead and try to put people in prison to be videotaped.
[1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:57.120]  It's not going to stop. It's all going to keep coming out.
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:03.120]  And just go ahead and squeeze because in the end you're going to be brought to justice, all of you.
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:13.120]  And hey, if you're a good police officer, you're a good police chief, you don't want to be part of this evil architecture, speak out. Say no.
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:16.120]  Say no.
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:20.120]  Because they need our compliance. They need our acquiescence.
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:24.120]  I'm going to tell you something, police. They're going to take your pension funds. You're not going to get them.
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:29.120]  The new owner is going to rape you too. So remember 10, 20 years on the road when you're living in a hell unimaginable,
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:33.120]  that if you didn't stand up and help us stop this, we need you.
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:37.120]  We want to be your brothers and sisters. We want to love you and honor you.
[1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:42.120]  We want you to join the light. We want you in this one life you've got to do the right thing.
[1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:50.120]  To stand with the heroes of liberty and freedom, the sons of liberty, the daughters of liberty, the sons and daughters of the republic.
[1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:55.120]  Don't choose the dark side.
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:38:58.120]  I know that there is still humanity and goodness in you.
[1:38:58.120 --> 1:39:03.120]  You know you've been conditioned. You know you've been twisted through peer pressure. You know you've been lied to.
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:11.120]  And you know we've told you the truth. So I ask you now with an open hand, join the republic in its darkest hour.
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:19.120]  Join the people. Join God. Join creativity and honor and goodness and decency.
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:26.120]  Join truth. Join everything that is honorable.
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:30.120]  Repent that you've been deceived.
[1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:35.120]  And to those of you that have not been deceived who have willingly joined evil,
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:41.120]  because of the raw exhilaration of the raw exercise of power,
[1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:49.120]  you will fail and you have never tasted of the true spirit of goodness.
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:57.120]  And I feel sorry for you, but you are no less dangerous despite the fact I feel sorry for you.
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:40:02.120]  Just like I feel sorry for a copperhead I find in my backyard or a coral snake.
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:05.120]  Its nature is to bite. Its nature is to kill.
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:11.120]  Its danger to me and my family and so it has to be dealt with.
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:18.120]  But for those of you who aren't snakes, whose true nature is out of a good person of a lion,
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:21.120]  be the lion you were born to be.
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:25.120]  Have the mental toughness to see through your conditioning and brainwashing.
[1:40:25.120 --> 1:40:32.120]  And come in and join the people of humanity on God's side for the big win.
[1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:35.120]  Don't say you weren't born.
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:41.120]  Don't say God didn't put people in your life and didn't have you come across people in your path
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:45.120]  who didn't put signposts up ahead to let you know what you were doing.
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:51.120]  Don't say you weren't given a chance when you stand before the creator of the universe.
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:56.120]  And the sum of your free will is judged.
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:40:59.120]  In your heart you know it is true.
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:04.120]  In your heart you know there is a God. In your heart you know I'm telling the truth.
[1:41:04.120 --> 1:41:11.120]  If you haven't been turned completely over to darkness.
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:15.120]  If you haven't gone past the point of no return.
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:17.120]  And that is the greatest sadness.
[1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:20.120]  You are damned.
[1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:23.120]  Not even damned by God. You are separated from goodness.
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:25.120]  You have committed and been consumed by evil.
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:31.120]  You are of your father.
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:42.120]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am now going to get into the massive grouping of gun control bills.
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:48.120]  I'm going to go over some of the past bills we've covered the last few weeks and get into the new stuff.
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:59.120]  Let it be here proclaimed publicly. It's on record again to millions listening that the assault on the Second Amendment at the greatest level ever seen is now upon us.
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:03.120]  And the mainstream media is running silent, running deep.
[1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:07.120]  They know if they admit it's going on there will be a giant groundswell that will defeat them.
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:11.120]  So they're going by stealth by way of deception.
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:24.120]  Those law may allow Obama AG Holder to ban guns that will. HR 1022 sponsored by New York Democrat Carolyn McCarthy with 67 cosponsors and growing was introduced.
[1:42:24.120 --> 1:42:28.120]  And it's now been reintroduced to the new Congress.
[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:37.120]  And you can go read the bill for yourself or it says the attorney general who supports total gunman on record.
[1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:50.120]  And before the Supreme Court, citizens have no right to own any firearms is saying out of the gates in this bill, any semi automatic rifle shotgun or handgun that he wishes by a decree will be banned.
[1:42:50.120 --> 1:43:02.120]  So they're passing just like the banker bailout bill gave executive fiat power to the private Federal Reserve, not just to create money, but to do whatever they want, keep it, not even tell the Congress, the public or any court.
[1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:13.120]  See, they're now vesting. They already did this repeatedly 51 and other executive orders and directives, but they have to get Congress in line with that or it's a total fraud.
[1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:18.120]  Even if Congress, though, then passes a law with something that's unconstitutional or against the common law, it's a fraud.
[1:43:18.120 --> 1:43:23.120]  But the point here is they want to get it all lined up at least on paper.
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:28.120]  And so everything is just about executive fiat.
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:34.120]  No courts, no judges, no juries. He just says it.
[1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:39.120]  Now, that article written three weeks ago by Kurt Nemo is up on info wars.com.
[1:43:39.120 --> 1:43:41.120]  It's January 7th.
[1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:46.120]  Proposed law may allow Obama, a G holder to ban guns at will.
[1:43:46.120 --> 1:43:50.120]  You can go read the bill for yourself.
[1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:57.120]  Now, here is the new one out of the New American magazine, January 19th.
[1:43:57.120 --> 1:44:03.120]  It's been 10 days and I missed this. We are not omnipresent, far from it.
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:09.120]  Did I believe the Blair Holt Other Gun Control Efforts on Horizon article? No.
[1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:13.120]  Even though I trust this publication, I went and looked up the bill.
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:18.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, here is the bill.
[1:44:18.120 --> 1:44:24.120]  HR 45, Blair Holt Forum Licensing and Record of Sale Act.
[1:44:24.120 --> 1:44:29.120]  Here is the summary from the bill.
[1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:33.120]  Blair Holt's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act in 2009 amends the Brady
[1:44:33.120 --> 1:44:36.120]  Handgun Violence Prevention Act prohibit a person from possessing a firearm
[1:44:36.120 --> 1:44:41.120]  unless that person has been issued a firearm license under the act
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:44.120]  or the state system certified under this act federalizing it.
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:48.120]  And such license has not been initiated, invalidated or revoked,
[1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:53.120]  prescribed license application, issuance, and renewal requirements.
[1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:57.120]  It prohibits transfer or receiving a qualified firearms unless the recipient
[1:44:57.120 --> 1:45:00.120]  presents a valid firearms license. This is like Illinois.
[1:45:00.120 --> 1:45:05.120]  The license is verified and the dealer records a tracking authorization number.
[1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:10.120]  Total registration prescribes firearms transfer reporting and record keeping requirements
[1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:16.120]  direct the attorney general to establish and maintain a federal record of sale system.
[1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:19.120]  So it tracks and bans private sales and registers you.
[1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:24.120]  It's psychological testing weight, folks. This thing alone is just devastating.
[1:45:24.120 --> 1:45:29.120]  Prohibits transferring a firearm is part one to any person other than a licensee
[1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:33.120]  unless the transfer is possessed through a license dealer in accordance with
[1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:37.120]  the National Institutional Criminal Background Check System requirements, with exceptions.
[1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:40.120]  A license manufacturer or dealer from failing to comply with reporting
[1:45:40.120 --> 1:45:43.120]  and record keeping requirements of the SAC-3 failing to report the loss
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:47.120]  or death of a firearm to the attorney general within 72 hours, got a report to the Feds
[1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:50.120]  or your gun gets stolen or lost, failing to report to the attorney general
[1:45:50.120 --> 1:45:53.120]  and address change within 60 days, got a report where you're at,
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:55.120]  gunlers got to check in, you're on probation.
[1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:58.120]  That's what a license does, turns it right into a privilege, you're on probation.
[1:45:58.120 --> 1:46:05.120]  Keeping a loaded firearm or a loaded firearm and ammunition from the firearm
[1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:09.120]  knowingly or recklessly is regarding the risk to a child capable of gaining access.
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:14.120]  So this is like California where you have to lock the handgun, the rifles,
[1:46:14.120 --> 1:46:18.120]  the guns up and have it separated and then they do SWAT team rage to check
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:21.120]  and then when somebody comes in as acts murdering people, the famous case,
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:23.120]  they can't get the gun.
[1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:26.120]  If a child uses the firearm and causes death or serious bodily injury,
[1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:30.120]  prescribes criminal penalties for violations of firearms provision act by the SAC,
[1:46:30.120 --> 1:46:34.120]  directs the attorney general to establish and maintain a firearms inquiry information clearinghouse,
[1:46:34.120 --> 1:46:38.120]  so a big tattletail squad grippy report to, conducting continuing studies
[1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:40.120]  and investigations of firearm-related deaths and injuries,
[1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:44.120]  collect and maintain current production and sales figures for each licensed manufacturer,
[1:46:44.120 --> 1:46:50.120]  authorizes the attorney general to certify state firearms licensing or record of sales systems.
[1:46:50.120 --> 1:46:55.120]  And then, I'm digging through the bill here, where's the part I found when I was reading it?
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:47:01.120]  It gets into the test, you're going to have to do federally to get a gun.
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:05.120]  Psychological records, any misdemeanor, it's all here.
[1:47:05.120 --> 1:47:11.120]  Where is it?
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:20.120]  This is out of the article in HR 2666, which has now been reintroduced as HR 45.
[1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:25.120]  The bill requires, this is out of the New American, you can go to the subsection,
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:30.120]  the bill requires a Blair Holt license involving a detailed application including photo, thumbprint,
[1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:33.120]  written test, release of mental health records.
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:37.120]  They make you waive that, they're not allowed now to do that,
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:41.120]  but see, now they're making you bring the private records and put it in there for your entire life.
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:44.120]  Firearms owners would also be required to report all gun transfers,
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:46.120]  even those to other fellow members, to the attorney general's database.
[1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:50.120]  It would also be illegal for a licensed gun owner to fail to record a gun lost,
[1:47:50.120 --> 1:47:53.120]  or theft within 70 hours, and it goes on and on and on.
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:56.120]  This was introduced by Rahm Emanuel in the last legislative session,
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:48:01.120]  has now been reintroduced into the new title, HR 45.
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:04.120]  This is the absolute end of the Second Amendment.
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:07.120]  This bill alone, and I've got 10 of them here in front of me.
[1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:17.120]  Now, remember, they built the biggest federal building in U.S. history.
[1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:20.120]  Over the last five years, it was completed a year and a half ago.
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:26.120]  The new BATF, alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, now BATFE,
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:31.120]  and they have massively increased their bureaucracy,
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:34.120]  and Bush supported the assault weapons ban,
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:38.120]  and you cowardly, foolish, fake, limbaugh listening conservatives
[1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:42.120]  confronted me on the street and in emails, and even in McBride's,
[1:48:42.120 --> 1:48:45.120]  one of their employees while I was buying a shotgun,
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:49.120]  came over and said, Alex, I don't appreciate you saying Bush supported the assault weapons ban.
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:52.120]  And then the manager came over and said, no, it's true.
[1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:53.120]  It's true, he's right.
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:58.120]  And the guy was like, who? Listen, coward, I'm right. You're wrong.
[1:48:58.120 --> 1:49:00.120]  Okay, they're coming for your guns.
[1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:02.120]  And a lot of you gun shops may think it's cute right now.
[1:49:02.120 --> 1:49:03.120]  Everybody's scared to death.
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:04.120]  You're not going to have a business soon.
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:06.120]  You're not going to have a future soon.
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:08.120]  I told you the incident check was registration.
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:10.120]  You lied and said, Alex, don't say that.
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:11.120]  It scares away customers.
[1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:12.120]  Then they only do private sales.
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:16.120]  There's even some gun dealer consortiums that are lobbying to ban private sales
[1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:17.120]  because they think they'll get more business.
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:21.120]  Listen, fools, the Second Amendment comes before you,
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:26.120]  making some short-term money.
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:31.120]  Good thing I got restrained or I'd punch people like you in the nose.
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:35.120]  You're disgustingly stupid and short-sighted.
[1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:38.120]  Your jackasses is what you are.
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:41.120]  And while they built up this infrastructure to go out for the Second Amendment
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:46.120]  for the last eight years, you were sleepy time.
[1:49:46.120 --> 1:49:48.120]  You weren't listening.
[1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:49.120]  You weren't involved.
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:52.120]  I told you the ultimate assault was coming last year.
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:53.120]  You better support Gunners of America.
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:56.120]  And I told you the NRA is a gun control group.
[1:49:56.120 --> 1:50:00.120]  It was founded for gun control and it lobbied for the 68 Gun Control Act
[1:50:00.120 --> 1:50:02.120]  and every other major act before that.
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:08.120]  Then they quote, compromise each time to get our neck further in the noose.
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:10.120]  They are coming for your guns.
[1:50:10.120 --> 1:50:11.120]  They want you to fight back.
[1:50:11.120 --> 1:50:13.120]  They want a physical war to start.
[1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:15.120]  They're bastards.
[1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:20.120]  And I'm telling you we have no other choice but to not give them our guns.
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:22.120]  They're going to incrementally pass these laws.
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:24.120]  They're going to incrementally swat team and harass people
[1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:26.120]  and they love hitting old people.
[1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:28.120]  A lot of old folks won't go get registered.
[1:50:28.120 --> 1:50:29.120]  They won't even know about the law.
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:31.120]  Then they'll swat team like doing Illinois and other areas.
[1:50:31.120 --> 1:50:33.120]  They've done this over and over again at state level.
[1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:35.120]  Now they're doing it federally.
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:37.120]  Now that's only one of the bills.
[1:50:37.120 --> 1:50:39.120]  There's more.
[1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:41.120]  There's more.
[1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:46.120]  And again, Holder trying to get a new law passed where he can ban any guns he wants
[1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:50.120]  by the struggle of a pen himself.
[1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:54.120]  They are criminal degenerate terrorists.
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:57.120]  Holder was clearly involved in Oklahoma City.
[1:50:57.120 --> 1:51:01.120]  These are terrorists that want our guns.
[1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:05.120]  Everyone knows that Omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:07.120]  With so many different methods of consumption,
[1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:10.120]  how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[1:51:10.120 --> 1:51:14.120]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American nutrition have the answer.

[1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:21.120]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota,
[1:51:21.120 --> 1:51:24.120]  providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours,
[1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:28.120]  producing the highest quality premium golden flaxseed around.
[1:51:28.120 --> 1:51:33.120]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flaxseeds by size and weight,
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:37.120]  keeping only the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of Omega-3.
[1:51:37.120 --> 1:51:40.120]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor.

[1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:05.120]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:10.120]  I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:13.120]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:17.120]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:26.120]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:52:26.120 --> 1:52:29.120]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth
[1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:33.120]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:36.120]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:42.120]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:52:42.120 --> 1:52:45.120]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[1:52:54.120 --> 1:52:56.120]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[1:52:56.120 --> 1:53:00.120]  they're going to commit moracks and bring in martial law.
[1:53:00.120 --> 1:53:04.120]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.

[1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:08.120]  Not an important point, but the guys just informed me that the audio that goes out
[1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:12.120]  versus my voice is a 200 millisecond delay so that I shouldn't sing along with music
[1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:16.120]  because when I'm hearing it, it's actually delayed, but it doesn't sound right.
[1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:19.120]  I never said it sounded right. I'm not a singer.
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:22.120]  To see if I still feel
[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:25.120]  I focus on the pain
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  The only thing
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:31.120]  The only thing
[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:34.120]  But the way it's that big, I have to say it way before?
[1:54:34.120 --> 1:54:38.120]  The needle tears the hole
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:40.120]  The old familiar stink
[1:54:40.120 --> 1:54:43.120]  The old familiar stink
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:45.120]  Try to kill it
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:47.120]  Try to kill it
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:49.120]  All the way
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:51.120]  But I remember
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:53.120]  But I remember
[1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:57.120]  Everything
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:00.120]  How have I become
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:03.120]  My sweetest friend
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:05.120]  My sweetest friend
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:07.120]  Everyone
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:11.120]  Everyone I know
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:14.120]  Goes away
[1:55:14.120 --> 1:55:17.120]  In the end
[1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:21.120]  I just want to hear it turned into a way off.
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:24.120]  I've got all this serious news here.
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:28.120]  But I like to screw around a bit because I can't psychologically take out hardcore
[1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:31.120]  serious all this is without having a little fun.
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:39.120]  We need to hurt. We need to know how evil and bad we are
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:42.120]  and how out of control society is and turning it around.
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:46.120]  Oh man.
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:49.120]  They really tripled the size of the gun confiscators.
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:51.120]  They really are going to use the military against us.
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:54.120]  They really are building FEMA camps.
[1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:56.120]  And there's no more time to screw around public.
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:55:58.120]  There's no more time to sit there and deny what I'm saying.
[1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:01.120]  If you did any research, you know I'm telling you the truth.
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:03.120]  And they really are coming for our guns.
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:07.120]  And we need people hysterically calling all their friends, family, neighbors.
[1:56:07.120 --> 1:56:09.120]  We need everybody calling Congress.
[1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:12.120]  We need everybody calling the White House and not saying please don't pass these bills.
[1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:15.120]  Tell them look you murdering pieces of trash, you criminals,
[1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:18.120]  you made off scammers, all you offshore crooks.
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:21.120]  Don't start World War III with the American people.
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:24.120]  You are not going to get our guns, you pieces of trash.
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:31.120]  Let these pieces of trash know that you are not going quietly into the night.
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:33.120]  You are not going into their FEMA camps.
[1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:35.120]  You are not going along with it.
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:38.120]  They have the House, the Senate and the presidency and the courts
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:41.120]  and they say they're going after your second amendment in action.
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:48.120]  While the liar front man, Barack Obama, sits up there saying I'm not coming after your guns.
[1:56:48.120 --> 1:56:51.120]  I'm only going to have some reasonable gun control.
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:57.120]  And reasonable is in the bills he's tried to pass and what he said in the past
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:57:01.120]  and his new attorney general and the Illinois crime boss,
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:07.120]  Mossad officer, Rahm Emanuel is confiscating your guns.
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:09.120]  They're coming for your guns.
[1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:13.120]  They're going to shift the whole anti-terror apparatus,
[1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:18.120]  the whole phony drug war apparatus of paramilitary police against the second amendment.
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:20.120]  These guys like to kill people.
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:24.120]  They're going to enjoy sitting out front of your house and gunning you down.
[1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:33.120]  They think it's tough. They think it's fun.
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:38.120]  We're going to go live at 20 after at prisonplanet.tv for 40 minutes with Kurt Nemo in studio.
[1:57:38.120 --> 1:57:40.120]  We're going to get Kurt back in studio again tomorrow.
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:42.120]  We got Jordan Maxwell coming up.
[1:57:42.120 --> 1:57:47.120]  And I haven't even gotten into the FEMA camp news.
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:51.120]  I haven't even gotten into it.
[1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:55.120]  And I haven't even plugged any sponsors that make this show possible.
[1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:56.120]  I better do that.
[1:57:56.120 --> 1:57:59.120]  I'll tell you right now the biggest thing sponsoring us is the sale of videos
[1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:00.120]  and we got a great film.
[1:58:00.120 --> 1:58:03.120]  Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill just came in.
[1:58:03.120 --> 1:58:06.120]  The third installment of Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings,
[1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:08.120]  Volume 3, this just came out.
[1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:17.120]  This is just now available at infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:19.120]  Info War is the key.
[1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:23.120]  We're trying that so that we can stop a physical war.
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:26.120]  And if it goes to a physical war, the Info War will assure we win
[1:58:26.120 --> 1:58:30.120]  because we'll have enough people awake to defeat the Global Crime Syndicate
[1:58:30.120 --> 1:58:34.120]  and their Hitlerian Stalinist operation against the Republic.
[1:58:34.120 --> 1:58:39.120]  Mobilize, activate, engage the enemy in the Info War now!
[1:59:05.120 --> 1:59:07.120]  And beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:09.120]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:12.120]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[1:59:12.120 --> 1:59:16.120]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:19.120]  from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[1:59:19.120 --> 1:59:23.120]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[1:59:23.120 --> 1:59:25.120]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:43.120]  Again, 800-409-5633.
[1:59:43.120 --> 1:59:45.120]  Or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:59:45.120 --> 1:59:46.120]  Take action today.
[1:59:46.120 --> 2:00:02.120]  The first step is getting storable food.
[2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:04.120]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:00:04.120 --> 2:00:07.120]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[2:00:07.120 --> 2:00:08.120]  Big brother.
[2:00:08.120 --> 2:00:09.120]  Mainstream media.
[2:00:09.120 --> 2:00:10.120]  Government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.120 --> 2:00:11.120]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.120 --> 2:00:13.120]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.120 --> 2:00:17.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[2:00:17.120 --> 2:00:22.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:26.120]  Your medical records or psychological records will be turned over to the federal government.
[2:00:26.120 --> 2:00:29.120]  They will conduct tests on you.
[2:00:29.120 --> 2:00:31.120]  It turns a right into a privilege.
[2:00:31.120 --> 2:00:34.120]  Licensing and full federal registration introduced.
[2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:37.120]  Racing to the House of Representatives right now.
[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:45.120]  Rahm Emanuel co-sponsored before he resigned to become the true president, as the New York Times said.
[2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:48.120]  He is the man basically running everything.
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:54.120]  Another bill to let Holder, who argued for the Supreme Court for total gun confiscation and bans,
[2:00:54.120 --> 2:00:59.120]  is now soon to be the AG.
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:01.120]  It's just incredible.
[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:05.120]  And he will have the power in another bill to ban any guns he wants by the struggle of a pen.
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:07.120]  And they say in the bill they're going to move to ban.
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:08.120]  Ban.
[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:10.120]  We mean turning these in.
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:12.120]  Any semi-automatics.
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:16.120]  It's in introduced legislation.
[2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:20.120]  Hunch showed by the White House.
[2:01:20.120 --> 2:01:24.120]  Hunch showed by the White House.
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:25.120]  Right now.
[2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:27.120]  It's happening right now.
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:29.120]  It's going on right now.
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:33.120]  Not next week, not next year, not I heard there's a plan.
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:36.120]  It's here.
[2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:37.120]  And what does that dovetail with?
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:39.120]  It dovetails with a report.
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:42.120]  Watson told me to be out earlier today, but I guess he's busy adding things to it.
[2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:47.120]  Part two, the new legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the U.S.
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:48.120]  And why is this so important?
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:50.120]  Why is this of the utmost importance?
[2:01:50.120 --> 2:01:55.120]  Because this shows us that we were right in predicting how they would roll these out.
[2:01:55.120 --> 2:01:56.120]  Oh, the economy's collapsing.
[2:01:56.120 --> 2:01:59.120]  We just magically just built these camps.
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:03.120]  And it's for when society breaks down and the army will merge with local police and local
[2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:07.120]  established and there'll be pastors and other non-governmental faith-based organizations
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:10.120]  and non-for-profits working in the camps.
[2:02:10.120 --> 2:02:12.120]  And we've built all these FEMA camps.
[2:02:12.120 --> 2:02:16.120]  We want six major regional centers and then another sub-center in every 10 FEMA regions
[2:02:16.120 --> 2:02:18.120]  and all the 10 FEMA regions.
[2:02:18.120 --> 2:02:21.120]  And also we're going to have camps on national parks.
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:23.120]  And it's for the American people to live in.
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:25.120]  And we're going to take care of you.
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:28.120]  But of course you won't be armed there and you won't be able to leave.
[2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:32.120]  Of course there's curfews in many cities now.
[2:02:32.120 --> 2:02:34.120]  Daytime for adults as well as children.
[2:02:34.120 --> 2:02:36.120]  But it's all for your safety and we just love you.
[2:02:36.120 --> 2:02:39.120]  And just give us your guns and let the bankers have unlimited power.
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:43.120]  We need a banker bail out too where they can remove any U.S. power
[2:02:43.120 --> 2:02:48.120]  and give it to a private international bank and we love you.
[2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:50.120]  And then, again, I see these articles every day,
[2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:52.120]  but I didn't get into this properly yesterday.
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:56.120]  The Wall Street Journal Market Watch comes out and says,
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:02:59.120]  North American Union currency uniting U.S., Canada, Mexico,
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:01.120]  money could result from crisis.
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:05.120]  The New World Order is upon us full of hope, promise, and a fair amount of fear.
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:08.120]  Oh, the New World, and it goes on to say that,
[2:03:08.120 --> 2:03:11.120]  we know we said this wasn't real, but it is.
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:15.120]  And then it goes on to say that the answer is,
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:17.120]  for us to merge with Mexico and Canada,
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:20.120]  that will fix the economic crises.
[2:03:20.120 --> 2:03:25.120]  And out of this crisis, it will fix everything.
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:26.120]  Oh, the dollar's dying.
[2:03:26.120 --> 2:03:28.120]  We have to merge with Canada and Mexico with a new currency.
[2:03:28.120 --> 2:03:29.120]  That will fix things.
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:31.120]  Oh, you have to have trips on the streets.
[2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:32.120]  That will fix things.
[2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:33.120]  And, oh, you have to give all your rights.
[2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:34.120]  That will fix things.
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:37.120]  And just do whatever we say and we'll fix things that we engineered,
[2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:44.120]  the globalists say.
[2:03:44.120 --> 2:03:46.120]  And then there's comments on the Wall Street Journal saying,
[2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:48.120]  Gethron's the disciple of Kissinger's New World Order.
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:51.120]  Henry the K. has been hawking over the New World Order.
[2:03:51.120 --> 2:03:55.120]  Over YouTube as of late, CNBC, Charlie Rose talking about New World Order.
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:04:04.120]  And I love the fact that the comments, hundreds and hundreds of them,
[2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:09.120]  are seeing right through it going, my God, they denied all of this.
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:15.120]  And now they're pushing world government in an American Union like the EU.
[2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:17.120]  Next is the North American Union.
[2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:18.120]  There will be no border fence.
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:22.120]  Instead, there will be a limited access highway being built from Canada to Mexico right now.
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:23.120]  Check out the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:25.120]  This is going to be owned by Cintra.
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:32.120]  And by the way, I just talked to yesterday to one of my employees whose wife works in transportation
[2:04:32.120 --> 2:04:36.120]  and they were in the meeting, closed door meeting, openly saying,
[2:04:36.120 --> 2:04:39.120]  we've just changed the name of the Trans-Texas Corridor to this.
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  But don't let the public know.
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:46.120]  Deceptive little creatures.
[2:04:46.120 --> 2:04:47.120]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:51.120]  I mean, you know, you talked with Cintra Fox, he would always admit it.
[2:04:51.120 --> 2:04:52.120]  Yes, we are setting up a New World Order.
[2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:54.120]  Yes, we're setting up an American Union.
[2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:55.120]  What's wrong with that?
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:04:56.120]  And then we say, we don't want it.
[2:04:56.120 --> 2:04:57.120]  There you go.
[2:04:57.120 --> 2:05:01.120]  Doesn't exist.
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:06.120]  Lead a superior life by drinking superior life brand ionized water.
[2:05:06.120 --> 2:05:09.120]  A couple of soft drinks each day, a few slices of pizza.
[2:05:09.120 --> 2:05:10.120]  Last night's cheeseburgers.
[2:05:10.120 --> 2:05:13.120]  These acidic foods will make you tired, overweight and cause numerous
[2:05:13.120 --> 2:05:16.120]  negative health problems in the short and long term.
[2:05:16.120 --> 2:05:20.120]  An acidic environment is created in the body, causing fuzzy memory
[2:05:20.120 --> 2:05:23.120]  and that all day low energy feeling.
[2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:26.120]  These are the early signs of your body telling you that it's not getting
[2:05:26.120 --> 2:05:27.120]  the proper care it needs.
[2:05:27.120 --> 2:05:29.120]  We are truly a junk food nation.
[2:05:29.120 --> 2:05:33.120]  Drinking ionized water will help you drop the weight, feel better,
[2:05:33.120 --> 2:05:38.120]  actually become hydrated and can improve the quality of your life.
[2:05:38.120 --> 2:05:40.120]  It's all about the pH.
[2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:42.120]  Disease cannot thrive in an alkaline body.
[2:05:42.120 --> 2:05:45.120]  What can a life brand water ionizer do for you?
[2:05:45.120 --> 2:05:49.120]  Call 800-276-9601.
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:53.120]  That's 800-276-9601.
[2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:56.120]  Or visit us at superiorlifewater.com.
[2:05:56.120 --> 2:05:59.120]  That's superiorlifewater.com.
[2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:01.120]  What's in your water?
[2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:03.120]  It is a big idea.
[2:06:03.120 --> 2:06:05.120]  A new world order.
[2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:10.120]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:06:10.120 --> 2:06:16.120]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:06:16.120 --> 2:06:19.120]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:06:19.120 --> 2:06:22.120]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[2:06:22.120 --> 2:06:27.120]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:35.120]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:06:35.120 --> 2:06:39.120]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:06:39.120 --> 2:06:42.120]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:06:42.120 --> 2:06:44.120]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[2:06:44.120 --> 2:06:46.120]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[2:06:46.120 --> 2:06:47.120]  That's their affidavit.

[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:10.120]  It's now winter. Hello, cold. Hello, Mr. Flu.
[2:07:10.120 --> 2:07:13.120]  Oh yeah, welcome aboard the ship of Irritating Sickness.
[2:07:13.120 --> 2:07:19.120]  But wait! Ahoy! The sickness answer! Get the tea dot com.
[2:07:19.120 --> 2:07:23.120]  That's get the tea dot com. Let life change tea.
[2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:27.120]  Battle your yuck so you can have your life back.
[2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:30.120]  Bye-bye, cold. Bye-bye, Mr. Flu.
[2:07:30.120 --> 2:07:35.120]  And oh, by the way, you toxins and chemicals, get the mp out of here.
[2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:42.120]  Feel better. Lose weight. Call us. 928-308-0408.

[2:07:49.120 --> 2:07:54.120]  That's getthetea.com. Make an investment in your life.
[2:07:54.120 --> 2:07:57.120]  Ah, P.S., I've been drinking it for years.
[2:08:24.120 --> 2:08:29.120]  They have to maintain control of the government and the public to be able to carry out their current crimes,
[2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:33.120]  cover up their past crimes, and carry out future crimes.
[2:08:33.120 --> 2:08:39.120]  That's how tyranny works. It either takes over and explodes and never stops, or it's defeated.
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:43.120]  No amount of baloney, no amount of brainwashing will change that.
[2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:46.120]  No amount of government disinformation will change that.
[2:08:46.120 --> 2:08:50.120]  We are in classical tyranny, all around us.
[2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:54.120]  Jordan Maxwell is coming up. I know we have loaded phones. We're going to get to some calls
[2:08:54.120 --> 2:09:00.120]  and some economic news as well, and more on legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the United States.
[2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:03.120]  You learn so much from this bill.
[2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:09.120]  But before we do that, I want to just say that the show, again, is possible because of our great sponsors
[2:09:09.120 --> 2:09:14.120]  like SurvivalSeedBank.com. Their number is 877-327-0365.
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:19.120]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[2:09:19.120 --> 2:09:23.120]  to feed your loved ones. There have been times in American history for pilgrims, for example,
[2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:27.120]  when seeds had the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:33.120]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:36.120]  Governments are storing seeds, the U.N. is storing seeds.
[2:09:36.120 --> 2:09:44.120]  Globals on every stripe are storing seeds all over the world for control of power while restricting their sale.
[2:09:44.120 --> 2:09:48.120]  Buying up companies no longer selling the heirloom seeds that are non-hybrid or GMO.
[2:09:48.120 --> 2:09:53.120]  Solution from science, trying to get out seeds out of the globalist hands into the hands of the people.
[2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:57.120]  One seed bank at a time, one family at a time, SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[2:09:57.120 --> 2:10:09.120]  We're giving a call at 877-327-0365-877-327-0365 to get your hands on these heirloom seeds, thousands of them.
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:11.120]  Great prices.
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:17.120]  Also, another sponsor that makes this transmission possible, speaking of food,
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:22.120]  is eFoodsDirect.com, the J. Michael Stevens group.
[2:10:22.120 --> 2:10:28.120]  And they have the great three-day responder for what, $21?
[2:10:28.120 --> 2:10:31.120]  Three days of food for one person.
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:35.120]  It's a great sampler to see how much quality is in the food.
[2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:37.120]  It's a great little tester for you to get.
[2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:40.120]  I suggest you buy a two-year supply from them.
[2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:45.120]  But regardless, get a boogie pack good for a month for one person, very inexpensive.
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:52.120]  Or get the three-day boogie pack, the three-day responder, the letter eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com,
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:56.120]  800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[2:10:56.120 --> 2:11:02.120]  I mean, people are insane if they don't get guns, gold, silver, seeds, a piece of real property to run to.
[2:11:02.120 --> 2:11:06.120]  And then you just hope the cops don't come to gun confiscate.
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:07.120]  I mean, it's going to break down into this.
[2:11:07.120 --> 2:11:08.120]  They're going to give us no quarter.
[2:11:08.120 --> 2:11:10.120]  They are phony warriors.
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:11.120]  They want to feed on the public.
[2:11:11.120 --> 2:11:17.120]  They've been trained to hate us, and they've been brainwashed to follow any order they're given to taser children.
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:20.120]  And I'm not saying all the police, but the commanders, I mean, they confiscating guns.
[2:11:20.120 --> 2:11:24.120]  Blagojevic ordered the National Guard to confiscate guns all over Illinois.
[2:11:24.120 --> 2:11:25.120]  They have a speech about it.
[2:11:25.120 --> 2:11:26.120]  It happened in New Orleans.
[2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:28.120]  They're giving us no quarter, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:11:28.120 --> 2:11:29.120]  They follow orders.
[2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:32.120]  They've been asking Marines and Army for decades what they fire on Americans.
[2:11:32.120 --> 2:11:34.120]  All those that said yes got promoted.
[2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:40.120]  Those that said no, 70-plus percent got sent overseas and got a special vaccine injection.
[2:11:40.120 --> 2:11:47.120]  800-409-5633 eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:11:47.120 --> 2:11:49.120]  You know, people say, oh, Alex, don't be so negative.
[2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:50.120]  Hey, I'm sorry.
[2:11:50.120 --> 2:11:52.120]  Reality is reality.
[2:11:52.120 --> 2:11:57.120]  And only by realizing just how horrible and out of control and crisis level it is,
[2:11:57.120 --> 2:12:00.120]  we've been slowly conditioned to accept all this.
[2:12:00.120 --> 2:12:02.120]  Slowly conditioned to go along with the New World Order.
[2:12:02.120 --> 2:12:09.120]  Slowly conditioned to accept all this tyranny.
[2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:10.120]  The time has come.
[2:12:10.120 --> 2:12:14.120]  The time is now, my friends, to really understand, consciously,
[2:12:14.120 --> 2:12:18.120]  that I've hit you in the brain and subconsciously in your gut and your spirit,
[2:12:18.120 --> 2:12:21.120]  to understand this is the real deal.
[2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:22.120]  They are going for broke.
[2:12:22.120 --> 2:12:26.120]  Now, if we scream bloody murder, go nuts, go crazy, warn everybody.
[2:12:26.120 --> 2:12:27.120]  Folks aren't going to laugh now.
[2:12:27.120 --> 2:12:28.120]  They're going, yeah, you're right.
[2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:32.120]  The public is ready to awaken because we're finally here.
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:34.120]  Thank God, Patriots, warned for decades.
[2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:39.120]  Thank God they warned and saw the bills and the documents and the creeping fascism and the corruption
[2:12:39.120 --> 2:12:40.120]  and everything.
[2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:42.120]  Thank God we've exposed and discredited these people.
[2:12:42.120 --> 2:12:43.120]  But they don't care.
[2:12:43.120 --> 2:12:44.120]  They're still going.
[2:12:44.120 --> 2:12:46.120]  They're still moving on us.
[2:12:46.120 --> 2:12:47.120]  But the public is ready to hear.
[2:12:47.120 --> 2:12:48.120]  The public is ready to understand.
[2:12:48.120 --> 2:12:52.120]  They're going to put us into a controlled economic implosion by design.
[2:12:52.120 --> 2:12:53.120]  They're going to pose as the saviors.
[2:12:53.120 --> 2:12:55.120]  They're going to have controlled riots.
[2:12:55.120 --> 2:12:56.120]  They're going to try to sell us on all of this.
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:13:00.120]  And we've got to be there every step of the way, pointing out police have been caught all over the world,
[2:13:00.120 --> 2:13:05.120]  including Greece, England, the United States, Canada, Denver last year, staging attacks on other
[2:13:05.120 --> 2:13:07.120]  police as a pretext to attack peaceful crowds.
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:13.120]  They are going to do this, the microwave guns, the sound cannons, the FEMA camps.
[2:13:13.120 --> 2:13:15.120]  They are going to police.
[2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:18.120]  Please be with the people.
[2:13:18.120 --> 2:13:21.120]  But see, the feds know governors are going to flip against the feds.
[2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:23.120]  Governors are going to say, we're not going along with the feds.
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:28.120]  That's why under PDD 51, they say they'll remove governors, put in troops.
[2:13:28.120 --> 2:13:29.120]  They are ready.
[2:13:29.120 --> 2:13:30.120]  Northcom is ready.
[2:13:30.120 --> 2:13:38.120]  It is not even a treasonous organization.
[2:13:38.120 --> 2:13:43.120]  Now, here's a new story just out two days ago, World Net Daily.
[2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:45.120]  Congress plan would let AG ban guns at will.
[2:13:45.120 --> 2:13:48.120]  Second Amendment critics are ready to run wild.
[2:13:48.120 --> 2:13:51.120]  We reported that back on January 7th.
[2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:53.120]  And I believe that says the 26th.
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:54.120]  Oh, that's the 16th.
[2:13:54.120 --> 2:13:55.120]  So they reported on the 16th.
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:13:58.120]  I'm looking at it across the room on the TV.
[2:13:58.120 --> 2:13:59.120]  There you have it.
[2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:03.120]  People didn't believe it when Kurt wrote an article, posted it first.
[2:14:03.120 --> 2:14:06.120]  I guess they believe it when World Net Daily reports it.
[2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:07.120]  Good.
[2:14:07.120 --> 2:14:08.120]  Just believe it.
[2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:10.120]  Go read the bill.
[2:14:10.120 --> 2:14:12.120]  It's happening.
[2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:13.120]  All right.
[2:14:13.120 --> 2:14:14.120]  Kurt Nemo is going to be in studio coming up.
[2:14:14.120 --> 2:14:18.120]  And we'll be taking your phone calls for all those that are patiently holding at 800-259-9231.
[2:14:18.120 --> 2:14:25.120]  But for the next five minutes, gold has now been up above 900 for the last three days.
[2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:29.120]  It's gone up what $5 today.
[2:14:29.120 --> 2:14:33.120]  It was $810 an ounce two weeks ago.
[2:14:33.120 --> 2:14:37.120]  Ted Anderson is about to run out of gold at the 830 level.
[2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:38.120]  He bought gold at 830.
[2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:40.120]  You can pass on those savings to you.
[2:14:40.120 --> 2:14:41.120]  He's run out of most of his silver.
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:42.120]  Everybody yells.
[2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:47.120]  I mean, literally 90-something percent of the gold shops and even big dealers are out.
[2:14:47.120 --> 2:14:51.120]  Or they're huge premiums, not with Ted Anderson.
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:53.120]  This is the best deal out there I have found.
[2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:55.120]  And he's got it in stock, ready to ship to you.
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:59.120]  Ted Anderson joining us from Minnesota at the headquarters of Minus Resources and the GCN Network.
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:00.120]  Are you there?
[2:15:00.120 --> 2:15:02.120]  Yeah, I'm right here with you, Alex.
[2:15:02.120 --> 2:15:06.120]  Ted, what do you think of the Wall Street Journal coming out and saying, yeah, the world government's real?
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:09.120]  We know people told you that was kooky, but actually it's real.
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:10.120]  They say this.
[2:15:10.120 --> 2:15:12.120]  It's a good thing.
[2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:13.120]  We need it.
[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:14.120]  Only the Amerero will save us.
[2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:15.120]  Again, we've been completely right.
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:16.120]  Yeah, I know.
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:19.120]  Well, the thing is at least it's coming to mainstream right now.
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:22.120]  Hopefully we've woken up enough people to understand that it's not a good thing.
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:30.120]  And this is just more of the same or even more control, less liberty, and the United States citizens are going to get cooked on this one.
[2:15:30.120 --> 2:15:32.120]  I hope they understand that.
[2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:42.120]  I mean, if there's anything else that we've done doing this network and your efforts and all the videos that you put out in the news and everything you do every day on the radio,
[2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:48.120]  I hope to God that people are getting the message out that this is not a good thing.
[2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:52.120]  This is not a good thing to enter into a world market.
[2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:53.120]  We're going to end up paying world taxes.
[2:15:53.120 --> 2:16:02.120]  It's, you know, we're going to end up answering to some foreigner to tell us whether or not we can have an economic good economy or a bad economy.
[2:16:02.120 --> 2:16:08.120]  It just, you know, it's, it is just us surrendering to an elite group.
[2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:12.120]  And it just, it Alex, it's just it burns, burns me up.
[2:16:12.120 --> 2:16:14.120]  Man makes my blood boil.
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:15.120]  I know you got little kids.
[2:16:15.120 --> 2:16:17.120]  My kids are getting to the point where they're going to get married.
[2:16:17.120 --> 2:16:19.120]  They're going to get married and have little kids.
[2:16:19.120 --> 2:16:23.120]  And, and I just don't want to leave that kind of future for the generations to come.
[2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:29.120]  It just absolutely makes my heart sink when I see this.
[2:16:29.120 --> 2:16:32.120]  I mean, it just, well, how could we let our nation go this direction?
[2:16:32.120 --> 2:16:35.120]  Ted, it is the worst possible night.
[2:16:35.120 --> 2:16:38.120]  I mean, literally Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Maoist China.
[2:16:38.120 --> 2:16:46.120]  It is the worst attack configuration, the worst signature, the worst combination of tyranny.
[2:16:46.120 --> 2:16:48.120]  They're really doing it.
[2:16:48.120 --> 2:16:52.120]  And it's just the bravada, the hootspot, whatever you want to call it.
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:58.120]  It's just light years worse than we can even with all the knowledge and integrated information.
[2:16:58.120 --> 2:17:04.120]  It just would take 20 volumes to put all of our studies and we know how they operate and how sneaky they are.
[2:17:04.120 --> 2:17:07.120]  And why would federal agents want to be part of this?
[2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:09.120]  Why would cops want to be part of this?
[2:17:09.120 --> 2:17:13.120]  Well, because they're incrementally introduced to different phases.
[2:17:13.120 --> 2:17:16.120]  They are incrementally eased into this just like the public.
[2:17:16.120 --> 2:17:19.120]  They're more brainwashed and put through more training than the public is.
[2:17:19.120 --> 2:17:22.120]  Well, and go ahead, Ted.
[2:17:22.120 --> 2:17:25.120]  All I can say is that we got to go into hyperspeed overdrive to fight this thing.
[2:17:25.120 --> 2:17:27.120]  There's no question about it.
[2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:34.120]  We have to get out to every single individual possible to get them the information about how this thing comes into existence.
[2:17:34.120 --> 2:17:41.120]  What's happening monetarily and also, you know, politically in the United States right now, everybody wants answers.
[2:17:41.120 --> 2:17:43.120]  They think they're getting it.
[2:17:43.120 --> 2:17:46.120]  Oh, my gosh, they're almost 80% polled.
[2:17:46.120 --> 2:17:49.120]  Thought that it would be a good idea to have this next bailout.
[2:17:49.120 --> 2:17:50.120]  I mean, why?
[2:17:50.120 --> 2:17:54.120]  Just because Barack Obama's saying it now rather than George Bush makes it a good idea.
[2:17:54.120 --> 2:17:56.120]  I mean, we're supposed to have change here.
[2:17:56.120 --> 2:17:57.120]  We're getting the same thing.
[2:17:57.120 --> 2:17:58.120]  It's getting fed.
[2:17:58.120 --> 2:17:59.120]  That's right.
[2:17:59.120 --> 2:18:01.120]  By another look, look, look, look at psychological warfare.
[2:18:01.120 --> 2:18:03.120]  People know the first bailout was for the bankers.
[2:18:03.120 --> 2:18:04.120]  So they want theirs.
[2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:09.120]  They don't know it's federal control strings attached that it's tax money.
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:16.120]  And yeah, 99% in every major poll, a thousand to one phone calls against the last banker takeover.
[2:18:16.120 --> 2:18:20.120]  This one because Obama's for it 75, 80% depending on the poll.
[2:18:20.120 --> 2:18:23.120]  And now he says bailout to that's it.
[2:18:23.120 --> 2:18:25.120]  They've already given dictatorial power to the Fed.
[2:18:25.120 --> 2:18:31.120]  Now it's going to be rolled in Wall Street Journal into a new global government bank that will run the United States.
[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:38.120]  The end, the total end, not incremental, the total end by high treason till we only got a minute and a half left.
[2:18:38.120 --> 2:18:39.120]  What are some of today's gold offer?
[2:18:39.120 --> 2:18:41.120]  Well, I'm still offering the stuff from 830.
[2:18:41.120 --> 2:18:43.120]  I've got that around still.
[2:18:43.120 --> 2:18:44.120]  The Franks have a 214.
[2:18:44.120 --> 2:18:46.120]  The British sovereigns are 263.
[2:18:46.120 --> 2:18:48.120]  I'll give you an idea.
[2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:55.120]  Right now shopping for the Franks, I have to charge 227 for that coin and the British sovereigns at 277.
[2:18:55.120 --> 2:18:57.120]  Now I got to tell you a little secret.
[2:18:57.120 --> 2:19:03.120]  Gold took a little dip here recently about $17 less than it is today because it's up that much right now.
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:05.120]  And I bought a whole bunch of stuff at that level.
[2:19:05.120 --> 2:19:14.120]  And that's going to allow me to offer another special but not this good because this stuff was down at 830 and I was able to buy it about 870 on this last dip.
[2:19:14.120 --> 2:19:16.120]  Now we've got gold coming back up again.
[2:19:16.120 --> 2:19:17.120]  But guess why?
[2:19:17.120 --> 2:19:29.120]  Because the Federal Reserve system right now is talking about contemplating actually doing buying U.S. government treasuries to lower the interest rates to make it easier to get into a mortgage at lower interest.
[2:19:29.120 --> 2:19:35.120]  Well, they always lie. They'll say they'll do that and just give themselves credit not the people.
[2:19:35.120 --> 2:19:39.120]  800-686-2237. How long can you hold this deal?
[2:19:39.120 --> 2:19:42.120]  I'm going to hold this till tonight and it depends upon how many people buy it.
[2:19:42.120 --> 2:19:48.120]  I mean I got to tell you the phones are going to ruin off the hook because gold's over 900, silver's up 2.
[2:19:48.120 --> 2:19:50.120]  So you're going to run out, people need to call now.
[2:19:50.120 --> 2:19:54.120]  800-686-2237. Here's the number.
[2:19:54.120 --> 2:20:01.120]  686-2237. Transmission continues.

[2:21:00.120 --> 2:21:07.120]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:21:07.120 --> 2:21:11.120]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:21:11.120 --> 2:21:13.120]  Bin Laden. This is his M.O.
[2:21:13.120 --> 2:21:16.120]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:21:16.120 --> 2:21:23.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:21:23.120 --> 2:21:30.120]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:21:30.120 --> 2:21:34.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:34.120 --> 2:21:41.120]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:21:41.120 --> 2:21:45.120]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[2:21:53.120 --> 2:22:00.120]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[2:22:00.120 --> 2:22:06.120]  Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[2:22:06.120 --> 2:22:14.120]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[2:22:14.120 --> 2:22:20.120]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[2:22:20.120 --> 2:22:27.120]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[2:22:27.120 --> 2:22:33.120]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[2:22:33.120 --> 2:22:38.120]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[2:22:38.120 --> 2:22:46.120]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[2:22:46.120 --> 2:22:52.120]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[2:22:52.120 --> 2:22:59.120]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:23:23.120 --> 2:23:32.120]  You could expect to pay hundreds of dollars or more for someone to look inside your engine, but now for only $14.95.
[2:23:32.120 --> 2:23:37.120]  We will send you a test kit with easy to follow directions. Yes, just $14.95.
[2:23:37.120 --> 2:23:43.120]  Then you can speak directly with one of our experts on your engine's condition and how to make it last longer.
[2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:45.120]  Act now and we'll pay the shipping to you.
[2:23:45.120 --> 2:23:53.120]  Visit oilcompanysecret.com. That's oilcompanysecret.com or call 888-873-7371.
[2:23:53.120 --> 2:23:59.120]  That's 888-873-7371. 888-873-7371.
[2:23:59.120 --> 2:24:14.120]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[2:24:14.120 --> 2:24:21.120]  Here I'm coming for your guns, knocking on your door. We're here for your possession of illegal firearms.
[2:24:21.120 --> 2:24:27.120]  All the semi-autos will be banned. Everyone else will be registered to anybody with any psychological thing in their life.
[2:24:27.120 --> 2:24:32.120]  You have a car, they say, oh, I'm giving you a prescription at the hospital for Prozac. You've got post-traumatic.
[2:24:32.120 --> 2:24:35.120]  You don't really. No more Second Amendment.
[2:24:35.120 --> 2:24:40.120]  This will dwarf the 68 Gun Control Act, everything. This is a Chicago big city crime machine.
[2:24:40.120 --> 2:24:46.120]  They like their slaves disarmed so they can then have their mafia police feed on the slaves.
[2:24:46.120 --> 2:24:52.120]  Like every day, I watch. Call them all suckas.
[2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:57.120]  Kurt Nemo is in studio with us visiting for the week.
[2:24:57.120 --> 2:25:01.120]  You're not going to find me being a sucker going for the scam. What about you?
[2:25:01.120 --> 2:25:02.120]  No way.
[2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:06.120]  We know 9-11's an inside job. Kurt, we're going to go to you, my friend, in a moment. I wanted to finish up with Ted Anderson.
[2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:10.120]  We just went live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[2:25:10.120 --> 2:25:22.120]  Ted Anderson, bottom line, you are selling gold at the price of the market at $75, $80 less than what it should be priced at per ounce.
[2:25:22.120 --> 2:25:26.120]  And that's just the bottom line because you buy it when it's low and you sell it when it's low and when it's high.
[2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:32.120]  So folks can move on this now and get an incredible deal, 800-686-2237.
[2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:40.120]  Does you ever think you'd see the Wall Street Journal market watch saying, world government's good, we need a world government, and we need to have a North American Union?
[2:25:40.120 --> 2:25:46.120]  Only it will save us. Two years ago, it was in the secret SPP documents that they were going to say, use a crisis to get it.
[2:25:46.120 --> 2:25:48.120]  Now here are the bastards doing it, Ted.
[2:25:48.120 --> 2:25:51.120]  They're just doing it right out. I mean, that's just the thing.
[2:25:51.120 --> 2:25:58.120]  It is surprising to see it as blatant as it is in one sense, but then in the other sense, if you just looked underneath,
[2:25:58.120 --> 2:26:04.120]  if you could have half the sense to read between the lines and what was being published out there, you could see it there too.
[2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:11.120]  They're just gotten to the point now where people are so dumbed down that they look at this and they say, hail to Obama, let's do this.
[2:26:11.120 --> 2:26:16.120]  I mean, the whole new order agenda stall, everybody hates Bush.
[2:26:16.120 --> 2:26:19.120]  The hatred of Bush translates into Obama who's their man.
[2:26:19.120 --> 2:26:23.120]  And so suddenly, okay, we didn't like it when Bush was doing it, but we love it when you're doing it.
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:29.120]  The whole agenda, and as we said in these first six months, is the key, is just surging gun control, open borders, more wars,
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:37.120]  increasing troops in the Middle East and Central Asia, just total tyranny, openly announcing World Government's saying it'll save you.
[2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:42.120]  And Obama's new banker bailout is to set up this new World Government Bank that will taxes.
[2:26:42.120 --> 2:26:45.120]  Folks, give Ted's brokers a call. Protect yourselves today.
[2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:53.120]  They're going to steal your 401Ks, your bank accounts. They're doing it through inflation. Protect yourselves, 800-686-2237.
[2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:54.120]  Ted, good talking to you.
[2:26:54.120 --> 2:26:56.120]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[2:26:56.120 --> 2:27:04.120]  You bet. Kurt Nemo in studio here in Austin, Texas with us visiting from where he works and runs infowars.com for us.
[2:27:04.120 --> 2:27:12.120]  A lot of folks we have are contractors here, but Kurt is actually an employee of infowars.com and saw the great work he was doing for years and got him on the team now about a year and a half ago.
[2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:18.120]  And it's good to have Kurt Nemo here with us, a great guy that redesigned infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:23.120]  Kurt, this is a short seven. We're coming back in a long one, but that first question, we always talked about the jump point.
[2:27:23.120 --> 2:27:29.120]  When they finally went with the camps and the gun control and the open borders and the world bankings, and we had all their documents.
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:33.120]  We knew what it would be. Now it's emerged. What is the public going to do?
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:37.120]  Are they going to just be hypnotized by Obama and walk right into the New World Order?
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:41.120]  Well, I think most of the public's oblivious. They don't have any clue what's going on.
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:43.120]  They don't pay attention to any of this stuff.
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:47.120]  Or they remember the old propaganda that it didn't exist. And so they're kind of like Robbie the Robot.
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:50.120]  You go, well, here's the Wall Street Journal in New York Times saying, world government's good and they're doing it.
[2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:55.120]  They go, can I compute? Can I compute? Smokester, it's coming out. It does not exist, but they say it does.
[2:27:55.120 --> 2:27:57.120]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[2:27:57.120 --> 2:28:01.120]  That's okay. They're plugged into CNN and Fox News and they don't talk about any of this stuff there.
[2:28:01.120 --> 2:28:03.120]  So what do they know?
[2:28:03.120 --> 2:28:09.120]  Unless they listen to Alex Jones or read stuff on the web, they don't know anything about this stuff.
[2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:13.120]  What about, I mean, is the FBI going to apologize for all those training manuals for police saying,
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:17.120]  if you talk about a New World Order or a world government, you're a terrorist?
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:20.120]  No, absolutely not. The FBI doesn't apologize for anything.
[2:28:20.120 --> 2:28:24.120]  So they'll just, we're going to have world government, but if you say you don't like it, I guess you're a terrorist.
[2:28:24.120 --> 2:28:27.120]  But they won't, it won't be billed as world government. It'll be billed.
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:34.120]  I mean, it's like these, these scams are coming up with their billed as, you know, just in case there's another Katrina
[2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:39.120]  or a, you know, a natural disaster or a bio attack or whatever, it's for your own good.
[2:28:39.120 --> 2:28:42.120]  But then when you read what the Army's saying, they're admitting it's for the American people.
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:43.120]  Right.
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:46.120]  But of course it does have a dual use for emergency, but suddenly they're building them everywhere.
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:53.120]  But it's billed as for your safety, you know, it's billed for, you know, if something happens,
[2:28:53.120 --> 2:28:57.120]  if there's a bio attack or a hurricane, you go to the camp.
[2:28:57.120 --> 2:29:03.120]  I mean, read the bill. It says in the bill, it says there'll be facilities, humanitarian facilities, you know.
[2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:05.120]  And other facilities for other purposes.
[2:29:05.120 --> 2:29:06.120]  Right.
[2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:10.120]  And the local police will be there and the local pastors that we told everybody were secretly training with them.
[2:29:10.120 --> 2:29:12.120]  They'll be there, oh, it's out the Lord.
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:14.120]  Precisely.
[2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:18.120]  And Pat Roberts is going, nothing can stop Obama. He is of the Lord. Socialism is good.
[2:29:18.120 --> 2:29:21.120]  And they're like, yes, oh, hey, of the Lord.
[2:29:21.120 --> 2:29:26.120]  They're cranking it up. Like you said, the next six months, they're going to try to push all this stuff through.
[2:29:26.120 --> 2:29:28.120]  And once it's there.
[2:29:28.120 --> 2:29:34.120]  Well, I mean, all the preparations, Curt, we're finally here. We're finally alive during the time of them defecating all over us.
[2:29:34.120 --> 2:29:36.120]  We're, I mean, it's here.
[2:29:36.120 --> 2:29:37.120]  It's one way to put it.
[2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:43.120]  I'm sorry to be gross, but the new order hind in just popped out above us and, you know, and then they're going, here comes your freedom.
[2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:44.120]  Curt, stay there.
[2:29:44.120 --> 2:29:45.120]  Okay.
[2:29:45.120 --> 2:29:48.120]  We're going to come back a long segment. By the way, I like that hat you're wearing.
[2:29:48.120 --> 2:29:55.120]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.120 --> 2:29:58.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:26.120 --> 2:30:33.120]  With double enamel cans and nitrogen packaging, when purchasing from ready reserve foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[2:30:33.120 --> 2:30:39.120]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months while ready reserve ships within five business days.
[2:30:39.120 --> 2:30:41.120]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[2:30:41.120 --> 2:30:53.120]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you free of charge dial 1-800-453-2202 1-800-453-2202 or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com
[2:30:53.120 --> 2:31:00.120]  Factory direct wholesale pricing from ready reserve foods. Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[2:31:00.120 --> 2:31:08.120]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:31:08.120 --> 2:31:11.120]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:31:11.120 --> 2:31:14.120]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[2:31:14.120 --> 2:31:18.120]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.
[2:31:18.120 --> 2:31:27.120]  They visit our channel. The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[2:31:27.120 --> 2:31:33.120]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:31:33.120 --> 2:31:37.120]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:31:37.120 --> 2:31:40.120]  I don't think about the comic suggestion at 9-11.
[2:31:40.120 --> 2:31:43.120]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:31:43.120 --> 2:31:51.120]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.
[2:31:51.120 --> 2:31:57.120]  Truth rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:31:57.120 --> 2:32:00.120]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:32:00.120 --> 2:32:06.120]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[2:32:06.120 --> 2:32:12.120]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[2:32:12.120 --> 2:32:17.120]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[2:32:17.120 --> 2:32:23.120]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[2:32:23.120 --> 2:32:26.120]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[2:32:26.120 --> 2:32:29.120]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[2:32:29.120 --> 2:32:33.120]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[2:32:33.120 --> 2:32:38.120]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[2:32:38.120 --> 2:32:42.120]  Do your part. Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[2:32:42.120 --> 2:32:51.120]  Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[2:32:51.120 --> 2:32:57.120]  Order your bottle of Alkavision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[2:32:57.120 --> 2:33:09.120]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[2:33:28.120 --> 2:33:42.120]  Will the people not be slaves? Will they say no? Will they fight back against it in the Info War?
[2:33:42.120 --> 2:33:46.120]  Kurt, what do you think of the new digs here at the new office?
[2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:49.120]  Wonderful. Excellent. It's definitely good.
[2:33:49.120 --> 2:33:53.120]  You got a lot more going on. We're turning the heat up. You see us doing interviews, bringing folks in.
[2:33:53.120 --> 2:33:55.120]  We're beefing it up right now.
[2:33:55.120 --> 2:33:57.120]  The heat's not up in here, though.
[2:33:57.120 --> 2:33:59.120]  No. Do you like how I keep the studio?
[2:33:59.120 --> 2:34:01.120]  Kind of a freezer in here.
[2:34:01.120 --> 2:34:08.120]  Well, I like it cold. I used to have to boil another office because the AC didn't really work well in that little studio, so now it's the opposite.
[2:34:08.120 --> 2:34:12.120]  I like a haunted house in this office. It's hot in one room and cold in another.
[2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:19.120]  Kurt, there's a lot to talk about with you. We've got Jordan Maxwell coming up.
[2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:25.120]  But of all the things going on, what's most important to you right now that's happening?
[2:34:25.120 --> 2:34:34.120]  I have a positive view, even though things are negative, because now that they're openly announcing World Government's saying it's the only thing that will save you, because they are actually announcing a lot of publications.
[2:34:34.120 --> 2:34:37.120]  Oh, it did exist, but it's for your own good.
[2:34:37.120 --> 2:34:42.120]  I don't know if the establishment realizes how many people we warned who then laughed at us who were now going, whoa, you were right.
[2:34:42.120 --> 2:34:45.120]  Or maybe they do. They're just so arrogant.
[2:34:45.120 --> 2:34:52.120]  The most important thing for me is the economy, the engineered implosion of the economy is what's really front and center for me.
[2:34:52.120 --> 2:34:59.120]  Everything else is secondary to facilitate this destruction of the American economy, the global economy.
[2:34:59.120 --> 2:35:06.120]  Yeah, that's going to be their organized controlled crises. They use terror, they use wars, they use controlled implosions.
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:17.120]  Right. And they're trying to sell this, you know, this camp situation as, you know, like they did with Rex 84, you know, illegal aliens and whatnot, but it's for the American people.
[2:35:17.120 --> 2:35:21.120]  It's not for an influx of Mexicans coming across the border.
[2:35:21.120 --> 2:35:27.120]  Well, again, the army admits that. They're over here in the Army War College saying we're preparing to engage the American people and put them in detention centers.
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:32.120]  And all the urban warfare footage I've taped, they're admitting it's for America and they're practicing putting Americans in camps.
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:42.120]  But they're not building it as a camps for detention though. They're building it as a humanitarian response to some kind of crisis, which will probably be the economy.
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:50.120]  You know, I've never played this on TV. I've played the audio, but now that we're at TV, guys, go to YouTube and type in martial law.
[2:35:50.120 --> 2:35:57.120]  And you'll see a bunch of my videos, but you also see a bunch of local newscasts. Punch it up and I'll show you which one it is.
[2:35:57.120 --> 2:36:04.120]  Scroll down. Keep scrolling down.
[2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:09.120]  I'm trying to find the one all. Here it is.
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:16.120]  No, no, that's that's a town where they have martial law 24 hours a day.
[2:36:16.120 --> 2:36:22.120]  Oh, it doesn't matter. I'll find it during the break. The point is I have these newscasts where locally they admit they're preparing to engage the American people.
[2:36:22.120 --> 2:36:26.120]  And there's one I particularly want to play, but.
[2:36:26.120 --> 2:36:34.120]  But again, you don't hear this on corporate news. You don't hear that this is for detention, per se.
[2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:41.120]  Well, keep fleshing this out, Kurt Nemo. How do you see things unfolding? How do you, I mean, on the good side, how could this go?
[2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:43.120]  Or on the bad side, how do you see it going?
[2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:49.120]  Well, I don't really see any difference in the Bush administration. This is a contiguous continual thing that's going to go on.
[2:36:49.120 --> 2:36:59.120]  It's the same global agenda. It's not going to change. The only difference is we got a new front guy, you know, and he's much more, you know, savvy and you can read the teleprompter is better.
[2:36:59.120 --> 2:37:05.120]  And he's just it's the same agenda. Same agenda under Clinton, same agenda under Bush senior.
[2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:11.120]  So it's just a continuation of the same agenda.
[2:37:11.120 --> 2:37:13.120]  I agree. Continue.
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:23.120]  So I think that Obama is probably going to have to know what really is really interesting is this when you had Wayne Matson on and he was talking about
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:31.120]  Rahm Emanuel, who's who's apparently the real president cracking his knuckles in Obama's ear.
[2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:39.120]  So you take a look at this guy and you see the real face of the global elite because he's a front man. He's a former investor.
[2:37:39.120 --> 2:37:55.120]  And I think that Obama's, you know, his his the sheen that he has the the urbane sheen of him will start to slip away when we see these other faces appearing.
[2:37:55.120 --> 2:38:03.120]  And that's what Rahm Emanuel is. He's the real voice back there.
[2:38:03.120 --> 2:38:09.120]  Yeah, in front of the congressional delegation getting a crack at his knuckles and Obama says please stop that it bothers me.
[2:38:09.120 --> 2:38:15.120]  He gets up in front of everybody in front of the congressional leadership and goes right in his ears. Oh, yeah, I rule you.
[2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:17.120]  I'm in control.
[2:38:17.120 --> 2:38:19.120]  Is it Pitbull? It's a sociopath.
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:24.120]  Well, this is a guy again in 96 when Clinton won at the victory dinner in front of everybody with a knife going our enemies.
[2:38:24.120 --> 2:38:28.120]  He'd say their name for like five minutes and die, die, die.
[2:38:28.120 --> 2:38:30.120]  You can't make this stuff up, Kurt.
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:35.120]  You know who his father was. His father was a terrorist in Israel, you know, your gun terrorists.
[2:38:35.120 --> 2:38:41.120]  So I guess the acorn doesn't fall too far from the tree.
[2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:48.120]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the new chief of staff of the White House father was one of the leaders in the Mossad in the Ergon terrorist.
[2:38:48.120 --> 2:38:50.120]  Explain what they did.
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:56.120]  Ergon terrorists were what was a supposedly a Israeli defense force prior to the establishment state of Israel.
[2:38:56.120 --> 2:39:04.120]  Basically, what they did is they attacked the British, they attacked their Arab enemies and they engaged in terrorism, classic terrorism,
[2:39:04.120 --> 2:39:06.120]  blowing up hotels, killing people.
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:09.120]  And that's basically where his father came from.
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:15.120]  His father made the comment about, you know, his, what was it about the Arabs cleaning the floor in the White House?
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:19.120]  I forget what the exact quote was, but this is the mentality.
[2:39:19.120 --> 2:39:21.120]  This is the mentality his son has.
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:28.120]  We have enemies, you know, and so we stab the knife in the table and it's just an attitude.
[2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:32.120]  That's the attitude that's behind Barack Obama. He's just the frontman.
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:34.120]  You know, this is driving me crazy.
[2:39:34.120 --> 2:39:40.120]  There's this particular video out of Georgia with the police playing a part of Americans and the armies they're putting them in the camp.
[2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:42.120]  And I've always, I play the audio many times on there.
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:49.120]  I'm trying to find it on YouTube and can't remember the exact, the exact headline. It doesn't matter.
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:55.120]  What I do want to play, though, is guys, because I said I'd do it, pull up some of those local activist videos
[2:39:55.120 --> 2:40:02.120]  and put them on screen where FEMA took over one part of the old shopping mall
[2:40:02.120 --> 2:40:07.120]  and said it was for Hurricane, it was coming, but at the same time, it's still there.
[2:40:07.120 --> 2:40:09.120]  And that's where they move in for something like that.
[2:40:09.120 --> 2:40:12.120]  And then they admit there's going to be all these federal centers everywhere,
[2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:17.120]  nexusing in with the police and then with the clergy response teams.
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:23.120]  And then we have the newscast there where they admit the clergy response teams are training for people to stand down under martial law.
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:26.120]  Remember those clips yesterday? We never actually played, guys.
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:29.120]  One was the clergy response teams, martial law.
[2:40:29.120 --> 2:40:32.120]  And then the other was here in Austin.
[2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:39.120]  Okay, play the Highland Mall one and then pull up the one you had yesterday that we didn't get to.
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:42.120]  So the clergy will be there to pick up people, right?
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:45.120]  FEMA's RV thing right over here.
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:47.120]  I don't think that's a paper like this.
[2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:49.120]  A security part.
[2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:53.120]  Yeah, but why is a FEMA RV parked in front of the mall?
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:55.120]  Parked in front of the mall.
[2:40:55.120 --> 2:40:58.120]  In front of the closed part of the mall.
[2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:00.120]  That's real weird.
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:02.120]  Dude, look, it says Department of Homeland Security.
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:06.120]  It's the Department of Homeland Security parked in front of the mall?
[2:41:06.120 --> 2:41:09.120]  In front of that closed part, though.
[2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:11.120]  Okay, that's the first video.
[2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:15.120]  Go to the next video and show me the title of these so I can plug them.
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:18.120]  FEMA Homeland Security, Secret Ops in Highland Mall, Austin, Texas.
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:21.120]  Okay, now this is them talking to the police.
[2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:25.120]  I mean, it's right here, guys. You guys are typing it in.
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:28.120]  It's the video right to the right of it, right there.
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:30.120]  See, right there to the right?
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:32.120]  That's the video right there.
[2:41:32.120 --> 2:41:34.120]  There you go.
[2:41:34.120 --> 2:41:37.120]  I just want to know, I want to know what y'all are doing here.
[2:41:37.120 --> 2:41:38.120]  Step outside, please.
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:39.120]  Will you tell me what's going on?
[2:41:39.120 --> 2:41:41.120]  I will be more than happy as soon as you step outside.
[2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:43.120]  Sure.
[2:41:46.120 --> 2:41:48.120]  Is there a reason you're doing that?
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:51.120]  We just saw the FEMA camera and I thought y'all were part of the...
[2:41:51.120 --> 2:41:53.120]  There's some sort of emergency here. What's going on?
[2:41:53.120 --> 2:41:55.120]  The mall had already been shut down. Not the mall.
[2:41:55.120 --> 2:41:57.120]  The store had already been shut down.
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:41:58.120]  But...
[2:41:58.120 --> 2:42:00.120]  Is there some reason why FEMA's here?
[2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:02.120]  In case I can't...
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:04.120]  In case what?
[2:42:04.120 --> 2:42:06.120]  Dude, you're just a security guard.
[2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:08.120]  I'm a security guard.
[2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:11.120]  Yeah, we're... I'm sorry, we're part of an organization that...
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:14.120]  It's just making sure everybody understands what's going on.
[2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:16.120]  Secretive and angry they're asking, but the point is,
[2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:18.120]  I went over there and they told me get away.
[2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:20.120]  I was inside of all these wires and TV sets running in
[2:42:20.120 --> 2:42:23.120]  and they had other events with kids in front of big screens
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:26.120]  being thumbprinted and face scanned and going to database for their safety.
[2:42:26.120 --> 2:42:28.120]  But it's still there and they're building them.
[2:42:28.120 --> 2:42:30.120]  But I mean, here they are admitting they're building them
[2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:33.120]  for the American people, not just for emergencies.
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:37.120]  So what was this like a beta test for?
[2:42:37.120 --> 2:42:39.120]  I don't understand what they were doing.
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:42.120]  They just use any excuse they can to come over and take over spaces.
[2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:45.120]  They're putting little mini FEMA centers just all over the nation.
[2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:47.120]  They're building little FEMA camps for emergencies everywhere
[2:42:47.120 --> 2:42:50.120]  and they have little stockage. You've seen my police state films.
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:52.120]  Right.
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:56.120]  Yeah, here's the local newscast piece.
[2:42:56.120 --> 2:42:59.120]  Pastors for martial law, continuity of government.
[2:42:59.120 --> 2:43:02.120]  Now, the original video of this probably has a couple hundred thousand views.
[2:43:02.120 --> 2:43:04.120]  I've seen it.
[2:43:04.120 --> 2:43:09.120]  We're playing some new posting. I don't know how good the audio is on this piece.
[2:43:09.120 --> 2:43:12.120]  You always want to find one that has a higher hit view.
[2:43:12.120 --> 2:43:14.120]  That means it's older so that it has a...
[2:43:14.120 --> 2:43:16.120]  But so what? Just go ahead and play it.
[2:43:16.120 --> 2:43:18.120]  Come a reality in America?
[2:43:18.120 --> 2:43:23.120]  Some fear any nuclear, biological or chemical attack on U.S. territory?
[2:43:23.120 --> 2:43:25.120]  Cut her off. You've got to find the other older versions.
[2:43:25.120 --> 2:43:27.120]  It has her fully say martial law.
[2:43:27.120 --> 2:43:30.120]  That's the problem with a 50th generation video.
[2:43:30.120 --> 2:43:35.120]  Just type clergy response teams in and then I'll control it from here.
[2:43:35.120 --> 2:43:38.120]  Because I just want to show people how to do this and go how to find this stuff.
[2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:41.120]  Clergy response teams, play it.
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:46.120]  Okay. Feds train clergy response teams to quell dissent.
[2:43:46.120 --> 2:43:49.120]  And that's this video mixed with my videos.
[2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:54.120]  Let me find the newscast here.
[2:43:54.120 --> 2:43:59.120]  I need to look at it for hit counts. This doesn't make any sense.
[2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:04.120]  And of course this mouse doesn't work properly in here in my office.
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:13.120]  I need a new mouse or something. It's wireless into the other room.
[2:44:13.120 --> 2:44:20.120]  There I am on San Antonio TV talking about it.
[2:44:20.120 --> 2:44:26.120]  Clergy response teams. We'll go ahead and play this one.
[2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:29.120]  For folks that are out there listening, it was just the audio.
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:31.120]  Law ever become a reality in America?
[2:44:31.120 --> 2:44:38.120]  Some fear any nuclear, biological or chemical attack on U.S. territory might trigger just that.
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:41.120]  And as KCLA News 12 Jeff Ferrell discovered,
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:46.120]  the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[2:44:46.120 --> 2:44:50.120]  From my cold dead hand in Charlton Heston.
[2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:52.120]  Did you hear that?
[2:44:52.120 --> 2:44:57.120]  It's their biggest problem, us. That's what the Army says, engaging the American people.
[2:44:57.120 --> 2:44:59.120]  And they say it's over the Lord, Romans 13. We're prepared.
[2:44:59.120 --> 2:45:01.120]  Then you read the actual FEMA documents.
[2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:04.120]  Forced inoculations, gun confiscation, it's all in there.
[2:45:04.120 --> 2:45:08.120]  This famous declaration captures a truly American value.
[2:45:08.120 --> 2:45:11.120]  The overarching desire to protect our freedoms.
[2:45:11.120 --> 2:45:15.120]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency
[2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:18.120]  following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:22.120]  U.S. troops also arrived, something far easier to do even now
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:27.120]  thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse-Kamitadas Act.
[2:45:27.120 --> 2:45:32.120]  That forbid U.S. troops from policing on American soil.
[2:45:32.120 --> 2:45:37.120]  If martial law weren't enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege,
[2:45:37.120 --> 2:45:40.120]  easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[2:45:40.120 --> 2:45:46.120]  And that's exactly what the clergy response team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[2:45:46.120 --> 2:45:50.120]  The primary thing that we say to anybody is, let's cooperate and get this thing over with.
[2:45:50.120 --> 2:45:53.120]  And then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[2:45:53.120 --> 2:45:57.120]  Such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government
[2:45:57.120 --> 2:45:59.120]  versus the wishes of the public.
[2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:03.120]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:06.120]  in which they're helping to diffuse that situation.
[2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:07.120]  I had him on.
[2:46:07.120 --> 2:46:11.120]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down
[2:46:11.120 --> 2:46:14.120]  or obey the law is the Bible itself.
[2:46:14.120 --> 2:46:16.120]  Specifically, now what is the law?
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:17.120]  There's no Constitution.
[2:46:17.120 --> 2:46:18.120]  No Bill of Rights.
[2:46:18.120 --> 2:46:19.120]  You're going to a FEMA camp.
[2:46:19.120 --> 2:46:20.120]  We're taking your guns.
[2:46:20.120 --> 2:46:25.120]  And then the preachers are like, we helped deal with it here in Katrina.
[2:46:25.120 --> 2:46:27.120]  So I mean, they did it.
[2:46:27.120 --> 2:46:30.120]  And remember, this didn't exist when we broke this year and a half before this.
[2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:33.120]  We have the secret documents 10 times worse than this.
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:35.120]  Well, the newscast is misleading.
[2:46:35.120 --> 2:46:40.120]  She said that the Posse-Kamitadas Act has been repealed or no longer in effect.
[2:46:40.120 --> 2:46:41.120]  That's not true.
[2:46:41.120 --> 2:46:42.120]  Well, they blew holes in it.
[2:46:42.120 --> 2:46:43.120]  You could drive a Death Star through it.
[2:46:43.120 --> 2:46:47.120]  But it has not officially been repealed.
[2:46:47.120 --> 2:46:50.120]  They just enacted through executive orders.
[2:46:50.120 --> 2:46:51.120]  Fiat.
[2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:52.120]  Fiat.
[2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:53.120]  Right.
[2:46:53.120 --> 2:46:54.120]  Through Fiat.
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:46:55.120]  That's freedom.
[2:46:55.120 --> 2:46:56.120]  It's freedom.
[2:46:56.120 --> 2:46:57.120]  You know, I had that big lawyer on your street.
[2:46:57.120 --> 2:46:58.120]  He said, yes.
[2:46:58.120 --> 2:46:59.120]  Arguing with police is a terrorist act now.
[2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:00.120]  I'm sure about 20 years in prison.
[2:47:00.120 --> 2:47:01.120]  That's in the Patriot Act.
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:02.120]  Just talking.
[2:47:02.120 --> 2:47:03.120]  Isn't that what I mean?
[2:47:03.120 --> 2:47:04.120]  He's an attorney.
[2:47:04.120 --> 2:47:05.120]  He's an attorney.
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:06.120]  Well, that's America's hell to keep you safe.
[2:47:06.120 --> 2:47:07.120]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:12.120]  Hey, cops, you think a corrupt system like this is going to let you have your pension
[2:47:12.120 --> 2:47:14.120]  because this is the world you want your children living in.
[2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:17.120]  I guess I do to find Alcada.
[2:47:17.120 --> 2:47:23.120]  And then overnight they swing the whole thing on, the whole apparatus against the people.
[2:47:23.120 --> 2:47:24.120]  Romans.
[2:47:24.120 --> 2:47:25.120]  Romans 13.
[2:47:25.120 --> 2:47:26.120]  Oh.
[2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:28.120]  Because the government is established by the war, you know?
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:30.120]  And that's what we believe in the Christian faith.
[2:47:30.120 --> 2:47:32.120]  That's what's stated in the scripture.
[2:47:32.120 --> 2:47:37.120]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how
[2:47:37.120 --> 2:47:41.120]  long they expect a suspension of their rights might last.
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:44.120]  Jeff Farrell, KSLA News 12 reporting.
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:48.120]  According to Tuporville during Hurricane Katrina, the clergy response team provided 38 chaplains
[2:47:48.120 --> 2:47:52.120]  a day around the clock at eight different camps.
[2:47:52.120 --> 2:47:55.120]  Oh, eight different camps, Kurt.
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:47:56.120]  Once again, misleading.
[2:47:56.120 --> 2:48:00.120]  He said, what, depending on how long it lasts.
[2:48:00.120 --> 2:48:02.120]  Well, tyranny lasts forever.
[2:48:02.120 --> 2:48:03.120]  It doesn't get...
[2:48:03.120 --> 2:48:04.120]  Well, that's what they're saying.
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:08.120]  Just let us do what we want now and then things will be okay later.
[2:48:08.120 --> 2:48:09.120]  That isn't how it works.
[2:48:09.120 --> 2:48:11.120]  It's not how it works.
[2:48:11.120 --> 2:48:12.120]  Historically, it's not how it works.
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:13.120]  Well, Hitler used the clergy.
[2:48:13.120 --> 2:48:14.120]  Stalin did.
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:15.120]  So did Mao.
[2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:16.120]  There was approved churches.
[2:48:16.120 --> 2:48:18.120]  It was just ones that weren't approved.
[2:48:18.120 --> 2:48:21.120]  They went after.
[2:48:21.120 --> 2:48:24.120]  And Romans 13 doesn't say that.
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:26.120]  I mean, I guess Hitler was good then.
[2:48:26.120 --> 2:48:27.120]  Stalin, Mao.
[2:48:27.120 --> 2:48:28.120]  We shouldn't have fought King George III.
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:29.120]  Right.
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:33.120]  Well, you have to read that scripture in the context of the rest of the Bible.
[2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:34.120]  I mean, it's just...
[2:48:34.120 --> 2:48:37.120]  They take it out, stick it out there and say, you know, the government is of the Lord
[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:39.120]  and whatever the government does is kosher.
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:41.120]  It's not true.
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:45.120]  All governments are of the Lord.
[2:48:45.120 --> 2:48:47.120]  I mean, Christ, what did He do?
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:50.120]  He fought against the established order in Palestine.
[2:48:50.120 --> 2:48:51.120]  You know, so...
[2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:53.120]  What did all the other disciples do?
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:54.120]  Most of them got killed.
[2:48:54.120 --> 2:48:55.120]  Right.
[2:48:55.120 --> 2:48:56.120]  They were crucified.
[2:48:56.120 --> 2:48:57.120]  They were in prison.
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:48:58.120]  I mean, all because they did what they said.
[2:48:58.120 --> 2:49:03.120]  I mean, can you imagine the apostle Paul running around with the clergy response teams going,
[2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:07.120]  do what the Romans say, you know, worship whatever they...
[2:49:07.120 --> 2:49:10.120]  Go to the FEMA camps or any of them.
[2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:11.120]  Right.
[2:49:11.120 --> 2:49:12.120]  Right.
[2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:16.120]  Well, I mean, once again, it just shows they can get away with this because people are ignorant.
[2:49:16.120 --> 2:49:18.120]  They do not know history.
[2:49:18.120 --> 2:49:20.120]  They do not even know the Bible per se.
[2:49:20.120 --> 2:49:22.120]  They just buy this and these local...
[2:49:22.120 --> 2:49:26.120]  And they look towards television to give them the news and they believe whatever they've...
[2:49:26.120 --> 2:49:28.120]  Whatever's told on television.
[2:49:28.120 --> 2:49:30.120]  There's at least 26,000 of these preachers.
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:35.120]  They're under secret contract to brainwash you beforehand and then after.
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:40.120]  And I'm telling you, folks, if your preacher's going, Romans 13 of the Lord, firearms are not good.
[2:49:40.120 --> 2:49:42.120]  Go to emergency centers when it's needed.
[2:49:42.120 --> 2:49:44.120]  We've got all these TV preachers saying it after this happened.
[2:49:44.120 --> 2:49:45.120]  Yeah.
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:46.120]  I mean, they're reading a script.
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:50.120]  In fact, people have done videos of preacher after preacher saying the same thing.
[2:49:50.120 --> 2:49:52.120]  That crisis is coming.
[2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:54.120]  Do what the government says.
[2:49:54.120 --> 2:49:56.120]  You may have to go to emergency centers.
[2:49:56.120 --> 2:49:58.120]  I mean, how creepy is this, Kurt?
[2:49:58.120 --> 2:50:03.120]  This is like a nightmare science fiction novel about some dystopia takeover of America.
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:10.120]  Yes, George Orwell in slow motion, leading up to total tyranny.
[2:50:10.120 --> 2:50:17.120]  Kurt, why don't you just support Homeland Security and let the foreign bankers take over and turn your guns in, Kurt?
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:18.120]  I mean, come on.
[2:50:18.120 --> 2:50:20.120]  The government wants to help you.
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:22.120]  They're not run by made-offs.
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:26.120]  They're run by good people that want to help you.
[2:50:26.120 --> 2:50:27.120]  Right.
[2:50:27.120 --> 2:50:28.120]  It's of the Lord.
[2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:30.120]  That's what the scripture teaches.
[2:50:30.120 --> 2:50:33.120]  Why don't you repent and worship government?
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:36.120]  Kneel down right now before Obama.
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:38.120]  Messiah Obama.
[2:50:38.120 --> 2:50:41.120]  It's of the Lord.
[2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:44.120]  Kurt, we're worried about your soul right now.
[2:50:44.120 --> 2:50:46.120]  It's unbelievable that people buy this.
[2:50:46.120 --> 2:50:49.120]  Kurt, you need to turn your children over to the government.
[2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:53.120]  In the FEMA training manuals, the preachers are there to go, ma'am, let them take your child now.
[2:50:53.120 --> 2:51:01.120]  Now, ma'am, the Lord says, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord.
[2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:03.120]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[2:51:03.120 --> 2:51:05.120]  What does humidity mean to you?
[2:51:05.120 --> 2:51:07.120]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[2:51:07.120 --> 2:51:12.120]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[2:51:12.120 --> 2:51:15.120]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablu.com.

[2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:08.120]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:52:08.120 --> 2:52:10.120]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:52:10.120 --> 2:52:12.120]  But who is the enemy?
[2:52:12.120 --> 2:52:13.120]  Bin Laden.
[2:52:13.120 --> 2:52:14.120]  We see his MO's.
[2:52:14.120 --> 2:52:15.120]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:52:15.120 --> 2:52:17.120]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:52:17.120 --> 2:52:24.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:52:24.120 --> 2:52:31.120]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:52:31.120 --> 2:52:35.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:42.120]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:52:42.120 --> 2:52:47.120]  the warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[2:53:25.120 --> 2:53:29.120]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[2:53:29.120 --> 2:53:33.120]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.

[2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:25.120]  I'm with him.
[2:54:25.120 --> 2:54:31.120]  Remember Jim Jones said, drink the kool-aid with the arsenic. He was the government in that little community.
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:35.120]  And he said, it's of the Lord. The Lord.
[2:54:35.120 --> 2:54:40.120]  I mean, I just can't get over them going. It's of the Lord to go to the FEMA camp, Kurt.
[2:54:40.120 --> 2:54:46.120]  These people don't know what the Lord is. It's amazing. It really is amazing.
[2:54:46.120 --> 2:54:51.120]  The depth of brainwashing on a societal level.
[2:54:51.120 --> 2:54:55.120]  Kurt, I want to go to some phone calls from Neil, Maggie, Paul, Ronnie, Wilson, and others.
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:54:57.120]  But anything else you want to add before you go to those calls?
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:54:58.120]  No, let's go to the calls.
[2:54:58.120 --> 2:55:06.120]  Let's go to Neil in South Dakota. Neil, you need to worship all governments, including Ahmed Denizide. It's of the Lord.
[2:55:06.120 --> 2:55:07.120]  Hello.
[2:55:07.120 --> 2:55:08.120]  Hello, Neil.
[2:55:08.120 --> 2:55:13.120]  Hey, how are you? Say, I'm actually getting a question with a gun control stuff you were talking about earlier.
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:16.120]  Yes, sir. The victim disarmament, yes.
[2:55:16.120 --> 2:55:23.120]  Yes, exactly. You had mentioned that they're not getting my semi-auto. I'm not going to go for fingerprinting, et cetera.
[2:55:23.120 --> 2:55:27.120]  And as I recall, I apologize. I'm a little bit nervous here.
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:33.120]  You mentioned that they're not going to get that stuff from you, but as I recall, you've got me on kids.
[2:55:33.120 --> 2:55:40.120]  How do you reconcile the fact that you've got to take care of your kids and yet, you know, make a shot or take them to a camp trying to resist?
[2:55:40.120 --> 2:55:44.120]  Well, this isn't just Australia where they disarm the people so they can start stealing their land.
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:48.120]  They kill the real crocodile gun Dundee. Like 10 years ago, he wouldn't turn his guns in.
[2:55:48.120 --> 2:55:53.120]  This is a hardcore tyranny. So if they get the guns, they're taking you to the camp anyways.
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:56.120]  And so I'm always somebody who's calling against violence.
[2:55:56.120 --> 2:56:02.120]  It's not a radical statement, though, to say that they're taking people to camps and forcibly taking them. That's tyranny.
[2:56:02.120 --> 2:56:07.120]  And it's the natural law that this is the illegitimate government run by foreign bankers.
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:11.120]  And all I'm saying, and we as a people need to say, no, you're criminal.
[2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:16.120]  No, you know, if they do pass these illegal laws, we need to turn out protests, call Congress.
[2:56:16.120 --> 2:56:20.120]  And can you imagine when they do it? Everybody lining up, turning them in.
[2:56:20.120 --> 2:56:23.120]  The images of that on the news, there's going to be shootouts.
[2:56:23.120 --> 2:56:27.120]  They're going to make examples of people kill people in their houses and go, well, it's the law.
[2:56:27.120 --> 2:56:33.120]  That's what team guys on the news going. Good job, red leader. You did a great job. Just watch me shoot him.
[2:56:33.120 --> 2:56:37.120]  I know I'm such a man. I mean, that's where it's going.
[2:56:37.120 --> 2:56:45.120]  And if they succeed, the country's dead. The guns, the guns are the final insurance policy and they're coming for them.
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:48.120]  But let's stop the legislation now. Kurt.
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:51.120]  Well, what is there? 86 million guns in this country?
[2:56:51.120 --> 2:56:54.120]  Oh, no, there's 150 million gun owners on average owning two guns.
[2:56:54.120 --> 2:56:58.120]  So there's more than 300 million guns. And that's what's known. That's what the government says there is.
[2:56:58.120 --> 2:57:06.120]  So this, this whole government, this whole plan will have to be, will have to depend on people actually willingly turning in their guns.
[2:57:06.120 --> 2:57:10.120]  Well, I mean, here's the deal. The bills are all introduced toward demand.
[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:18.120]  All semi-autos to make you go get a federal register, federal license, making a right of privilege, a license is to do something that would be illegal.
[2:57:18.120 --> 2:57:26.120]  And they're doing it. And it's happening and psychological testing and everything else.
[2:57:26.120 --> 2:57:34.120]  I mean, remember during the debates for the vice presidents, Biden, the guy on the YouTube, who was a YouTube reporter for CNN,
[2:57:34.120 --> 2:57:38.120]  they got says, reporters said, here's my AR 15. This is my baby. You're not going to take it.
[2:57:38.120 --> 2:57:44.120]  Are you? And he said, yes, I'm going to take that gun. You're mentally ill for wanting to have that.
[2:57:44.120 --> 2:57:48.120]  See, it's mentally ill to them, but it's not to see a slave with a gun because that's not a slave.
[2:57:48.120 --> 2:57:53.120]  It's very upsetting. They were all like, oh man, God, I can't wait to disarm that wild human.
[2:57:53.120 --> 2:57:58.120]  I can't wait to have him under my control. And he's just like, yes, you're mentally ill and you wouldn't be able to own a gun.
[2:57:58.120 --> 2:57:59.120]  Well, that's part of the process.
[2:57:59.120 --> 2:58:01.120]  Wanting a gun is mentally ill. It's in the bill.
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:03.120]  Right, right. And that's part of the process.
[2:58:03.120 --> 2:58:05.120]  45, HR 45.
[2:58:05.120 --> 2:58:09.120]  Is brainwashing people into thinking that owning a firearm is mental illness?
[2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:15.120]  Hey, Alex. Yes, sir. I can jump in real quick here and just make sure I see my question properly.
[2:58:15.120 --> 2:58:20.120]  As someone, you know, as a father who has young children to save, you know, personalize it in your case.
[2:58:20.120 --> 2:58:25.120]  How do you reconcile the fact that you got to take care of your kids and yet they're coming to take away your guns and stuff like that?
[2:58:25.120 --> 2:58:28.120]  Do you want to protect your kids? You can't really give up your guns.
[2:58:28.120 --> 2:58:36.120]  Look, it's real simple. These bastards want our guns to make us slaves. I'm going to protect my family and I'm not giving them my guns.
[2:58:36.120 --> 2:58:41.120]  Like they say, come and take it in Gonzales, Texas.
[2:58:41.120 --> 2:58:46.120]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[2:59:16.120 --> 2:59:41.120]  Visit GCNLive.com today.

[2:59:46.120 --> 2:59:54.120]  Take action today. The first step is getting storable food.
[2:59:54.120 --> 3:00:01.120]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:01.120 --> 3:00:15.120]  You know, I'm very sad all these things are happening, but in a way, we know the battle needs to be joined.
[3:00:15.120 --> 3:00:20.120]  This country's been rotting slowly for a long time. They've got to be making their move.
[3:00:20.120 --> 3:00:26.120]  What did General Chesty Puller say when they were surrounded in North Korea?
[3:00:26.120 --> 3:00:32.120]  About, like, 15 times their number. As it's sort of completely surrounded, he said, well, that makes our situation a lot easier.
[3:00:32.120 --> 3:00:37.120]  It makes our logistics a lot better. Don't let any of them escape.
[3:00:37.120 --> 3:00:42.120]  But we do outnumber the New World Order millions to one.
[3:00:42.120 --> 3:00:44.120]  And, again, a lot of police and military don't like what's happening.
[3:00:44.120 --> 3:00:49.120]  They need to draw the line in the sand mentally and ask themselves FEMA camps, foreign troops, gun confiscation.
[3:00:49.120 --> 3:00:54.120]  Is this what you want to sign your soul, your one life onto?
[3:00:54.120 --> 3:01:00.120]  Do you stand with the Republic?
[3:01:00.120 --> 3:01:06.120]  They need to get out of their lethargy and start investigating. They need to learn the truth.
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:12.120]  Unfortunately, a lot of people are intellectually lazy. They just go to CNN and Fox News and buy whatever they sell.
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:15.120]  That's the major one, the major problem.
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:21.120]  Speaking of buying, we're really trying to build up capital here to expand to do more during this maximum time.
[3:01:21.120 --> 3:01:28.120]  It's all about the information. It's all about funds to get better servers, make more videos, hire more staff, make the websites better, more writers.
[3:01:28.120 --> 3:01:32.120]  We just got these in. I noticed there was a pile up on the desk and Kurt got one for himself.
[3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:35.120]  Kurt, tell us about the Attorney Response Team hat.
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:37.120]  Nice hat. High quality.
[3:01:37.120 --> 3:01:40.120]  That's a handsome hat. It says infowars.com on the back.
[3:01:40.120 --> 3:01:41.120]  Right.
[3:01:41.120 --> 3:01:47.120]  Look at that sucker. That is one handsome hat, Kurt.
[3:01:47.120 --> 3:01:51.120]  There's a banner hat on infowars.com. Just click it and you'll go to the ad.
[3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:53.120]  You've had the ladies chasing you around.
[3:01:53.120 --> 3:01:56.120]  I sure did.
[3:01:56.120 --> 3:02:03.120]  Oh, man. I can't believe it's all real. I knew intellectually it was all real, but to just see them in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times,
[3:02:03.120 --> 3:02:06.120]  when world government's good, it's going to save you.
[3:02:06.120 --> 3:02:10.120]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[3:02:10.120 --> 3:02:15.120]  Yes. I was looking at myself on the monitor over there.
[3:02:15.120 --> 3:02:19.120]  I was admiring myself. No, you're absolutely right.
[3:02:19.120 --> 3:02:27.120]  And if you look at the stimulus bill and the way they've been selling it, so-called stimulus bill, corporate media is really slick.
[3:02:27.120 --> 3:02:31.120]  They're really pushing it. It's going to help us.
[3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:39.120]  It's going to help us when it's actually just going to increase the national debt astronomically and facilitate the banker collapse even more and far sooner.
[3:02:39.120 --> 3:02:46.120]  Well, the last caller had been a great point that I haven't even mentioned about the victim's armament. Chicago, New York, places where they have total gun bans,
[3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:50.120]  have two, three, four, five times the national average, depending on which year it is, it changes.
[3:02:50.120 --> 3:02:52.120]  But it's always, I mean, it's a hell hole.
[3:02:52.120 --> 3:02:56.120]  And the cops openly are shaking everybody down. It's admittedly mafia.
[3:02:56.120 --> 3:02:59.120]  I mean, why would mafia run cities when you're guns?
[3:02:59.120 --> 3:03:02.120]  Well, obviously, so that you can't resist them.
[3:03:02.120 --> 3:03:07.120]  But I'll say what, I live in Chicago. A lot of people have guns in the inner city. They're illegal, but they have guns.
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:12.120]  And that's why they want the National Guard to do door-to-door gun checks.
[3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:16.120]  Total constitutional violation. Totally. On numerous levels.
[3:03:16.120 --> 3:03:20.120]  Well, they just can't wait. They want to target the good people of America.
[3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:26.120]  And they, I mean, they're already doing it. They're pulling over old ranchers that got a handgun, you know, in the glove compartment.
[3:03:26.120 --> 3:03:31.120]  Jail, right here in Texas. They'll say, well, I as an officer choose to say, I don't like that.
[3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:37.120]  And they get, get the old guy, take his cowboy hat off, get the old man and it's been on the news and take him to jail.
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:42.120]  The judge goes, you're going to jail, boy. Oh, yeah, I love America.
[3:03:42.120 --> 3:03:48.120]  I mean, they're criminals, man. They love their security, their guns all.
[3:03:48.120 --> 3:03:52.120]  Notice how the government also is building up armaments against us while going after our guns.
[3:03:52.120 --> 3:03:56.120]  But the good news is, Kurt, 44% increase broken all-time record.
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:04:03.120]  Right. And that's classic. I mean, you look at Germany before Hitler's dictatorship or during his assent after the Enabling Act.
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:07.120]  That's precisely what they did is they first they registered the guns. They made you register your gun.
[3:04:07.120 --> 3:04:11.120]  They made you go to a hunting club and put your guns in their facility.
[3:04:11.120 --> 3:04:16.120]  And then they just confiscated them. And that's precisely what's unrolling now here in the United States.
[3:04:16.120 --> 3:04:19.120]  Yep. And then they started having, but then everything was okay.
[3:04:19.120 --> 3:04:20.120]  Of course everything was okay.
[3:04:20.120 --> 3:04:23.120]  The government was nice after that.
[3:04:23.120 --> 3:04:26.120]  It's so long as you did in the government.
[3:04:26.120 --> 3:04:29.120]  Well, I mean, when a government wants your guns, folks, they're planning bad stuff.
[3:04:29.120 --> 3:04:30.120]  That's right.
[3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:36.120]  It's real simple. I mean, I got a family. I'm on the radio. You think I want to be on air saying lock and load?
[3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:41.120]  I mean, you know, this is it. This is the Republic. Every day I've got to make the decision to commit fully to this.
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:47.120]  There's so many people, and you've pointed this out constantly, that out there who believe that guns are evil.
[3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:49.120]  You know, this is America.
[3:04:49.120 --> 3:04:51.120]  Well, they are evil in the hands of evil government.
[3:04:51.120 --> 3:04:55.120]  Right. But I'm saying the mere presence of this piece of hardware is evil.
[3:04:55.120 --> 3:05:22.120]  Yeah. He's the writer at info wars.com. We'll be back in tomorrow live in studio. He is Kurt Nemo. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:22.120 --> 3:05:27.120]  We'll understand why families trust e foods direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.

[3:05:34.120 --> 3:05:42.120]  Food is an everyday need. The three day responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.

[3:06:01.120 --> 3:06:08.120]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:06:08.120 --> 3:06:12.120]  The enemy struck America on September 11. But who is the enemy?
[3:06:12.120 --> 3:06:14.120]  Bin Laden. This is his M.O.
[3:06:14.120 --> 3:06:17.120]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:06:17.120 --> 3:06:24.120]  Fabled enemies is the first 9 11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:06:24.120 --> 3:06:31.120]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:06:31.120 --> 3:06:35.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:42.120]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:06:42.120 --> 3:06:46.120]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much much more. Fabled enemies.

[3:06:54.120 --> 3:07:01.120]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[3:07:01.120 --> 3:07:05.120]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[3:07:05.120 --> 3:07:10.120]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[3:07:10.120 --> 3:07:15.120]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:07:15.120 --> 3:07:23.120]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[3:07:23.120 --> 3:07:27.120]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[3:07:27.120 --> 3:07:33.120]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[3:07:33.120 --> 3:07:39.120]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[3:07:39.120 --> 3:07:46.120]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[3:08:47.120 --> 3:08:53.120]  The attorney general will be able to ban any guns he wishes by a simple stroke of the pen, so executive tyrannical power being transferred.
[3:08:53.120 --> 3:08:56.120]  Global bankers engineering the collapse by design.
[3:08:56.120 --> 3:09:02.120]  Hundreds of mainstream publications announcing the world government is upon us and it's a good thing.
[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:11.120]  Like the Wall Street Journal Market Watch yesterday with the headline North American Union Currency Uniting US, Canada, Mexico Money Could Result from Crisis.
[3:09:11.120 --> 3:09:16.120]  And they say, yes, it's true, but it will save you and save the economy.
[3:09:16.120 --> 3:09:18.120]  So this is classic problem reaction solution.
[3:09:18.120 --> 3:09:28.120]  Create the economic crisis, then say total tyranny is the solution and paying our taxes, carbon taxes on all human activity to the new super private central bank.
[3:09:28.120 --> 3:09:30.120]  They're openly setting up in Bretton Woods too.
[3:09:30.120 --> 3:09:35.120]  So joining us, ladies and gentlemen, is Jordan Maxwell. Jordan, good to have you here with us.
[3:09:35.120 --> 3:09:42.120]  Well, I'm glad to be with you again, Alex. I don't know what we could add to what you just said. I mean, that pretty well says it all.
[3:09:42.120 --> 3:09:54.120]  I mean, my God, it's just incredible watching what's going on right in front of our eyes, right in front of our faces and nothing seems to bother the American public.
[3:09:54.120 --> 3:09:59.120]  They just keep watching and it just keeps getting darker and darker down the tunnel.
[3:09:59.120 --> 3:10:03.120]  And I'm just amazed. I don't have any words for it.
[3:10:03.120 --> 3:10:09.120]  But there is something else bigger, even bigger than all of that going on.
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:15.120]  This thing that's happening to America is very, very ancient, very old.
[3:10:15.120 --> 3:10:30.120]  And I've been looking at this thing for a long time and it's really, really scary because the implications are it's not just going to destroy the individuality of the people of America and enslave the Americans.
[3:10:30.120 --> 3:10:39.120]  This is a worldwide phenomenon and it's been going on for a long time and I've been doing a lot of work on that over the years.
[3:10:39.120 --> 3:10:43.120]  And I just, you know, I'm just amazed. I don't know where to start.
[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:50.120]  Well, Jordan, that was my first question for you. Is that what, 40, 45? How long have you been fighting the global?
[3:10:50.120 --> 3:10:57.120]  I started in 59. So that's right around 48 years now. I've been looking and talking about this subject.
[3:10:57.120 --> 3:11:08.120]  So getting close to 50 years here, dealing with this, everything you said, everything you laid out, how they would do it, the steps they would go in.
[3:11:08.120 --> 3:11:12.120]  You were right. Others were right. You're covering different slices of the agenda.
[3:11:12.120 --> 3:11:21.120]  G. Edward Griffin, Gary Allen, people like that. And now you've been proven right, vindicated in spades.
[3:11:21.120 --> 3:11:29.120]  Now tell us what it's like to see it all admitted and what that means that the globalists are now emerging.
[3:11:29.120 --> 3:11:34.120]  We always said that was key. The uncloking was when they would put the capstone on.
[3:11:34.120 --> 3:11:39.120]  And then, so what does it mean that they're now announcing it all after denying it? And then where are we going?
[3:11:39.120 --> 3:11:45.120]  Oh, I'll tell you. Alex, like you said, I've been working on this for many, many years.
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:55.120]  Back in 1967, I stumbled upon a piece of the puzzle that at the time I knew was going to be very important.
[3:11:55.120 --> 3:12:03.120]  I just didn't know why or how. And since 1967, I've been looking at that one piece along with everything else,
[3:12:03.120 --> 3:12:12.120]  but especially has that piece of the puzzle that I discovered in 1967 been paramount in my thinking and in my research.
[3:12:12.120 --> 3:12:27.120]  And only until the coming of the new president did that, what is it, 40 some odd years of research in 1967 finally come into full view.
[3:12:27.120 --> 3:12:41.120]  It's a story that you would not believe. And I'm just amazed that all the things that I've been researching on that one subject is now in your face everywhere.
[3:12:41.120 --> 3:12:52.120]  I was talking about it many years ago. And another reason I'm not getting into that one symbol and one subject is because it's so big.
[3:12:52.120 --> 3:13:03.120]  It's such a huge subject. But the same symbolism, the words and terms that were used by the Egyptians, used in the ancient Middle East,
[3:13:03.120 --> 3:13:11.120]  and in ancient Greece, and in Rome, and then finally into Europe and Britannia, and finally into America.
[3:13:11.120 --> 3:13:16.120]  You can trace these words, terms, and symbols all the way back into ancient history.
[3:13:16.120 --> 3:13:30.120]  And the implication is that we are facing something which is so awesome and so old and so well established that this is why we are not able to do anything.
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:40.120]  Because people, generally speaking, do not know the perimeters of how old and vast and monumental this apparatus is.
[3:13:40.120 --> 3:13:48.120]  And unless until you understand how far back this thing goes and what these symbols mean.
[3:13:48.120 --> 3:14:01.120]  Like I said, I've got over 40 years looking at this one symbol that is just driving me crazy because Obama's government is filled with this kind of occult symbolism.
[3:14:01.120 --> 3:14:06.120]  The rising sun? You've got it. That's exactly right.
[3:14:06.120 --> 3:14:22.120]  Now, let's stop there. I mean, we saw Obama coming, but I didn't realize that in America, even the Washington Post admits that he's using Hitlerian and Maoist and Stalinist colorations, posters, slogans.
[3:14:22.120 --> 3:14:31.120]  And now they create the crisis with Bush, get everybody scared, and then make all the hate of Bush about loving Obama, transferring all that energy into their agenda.
[3:14:31.120 --> 3:14:37.120]  And now it's all just going at light speed and they're calling him president of the world Messiah.
[3:14:37.120 --> 3:14:44.120]  Is he a prototype of their world leader or could Obama be their messianic leader?
[3:14:44.120 --> 3:14:55.120]  Well, I'll tell you, everything you just said is absolutely correctly understood. You're exactly right that the words and terms, you said it so much better than I could.
[3:14:55.120 --> 3:15:15.120]  That the terms, the symbols, the words, the catchphrases are taken directly out of the Soviet school of philosophy, taken directly out of the communist philosophy, taken directly out of Adolf Hitler's philosophies and words and terms that we use by the Nazis.
[3:15:15.120 --> 3:15:21.120]  And once you see this, it's just overwhelming to me. It's just a staggering word.
[3:15:21.120 --> 3:15:40.120]  It's staggering how in your face it is. It's right there in your face, but the people have never spent time looking at this kind of an arcane subject of how world leaders use occult terms and symbols to manipulate the human masses.
[3:15:40.120 --> 3:16:02.120]  And so again, I don't see it as a problem for America. Now I see it as a problem for the human race. The entire human species on earth is now in serious trouble because the entire earth is now covered with these symbols, words and terms and today around the world.
[3:16:02.120 --> 3:16:09.120]  Nobody seems to recognize it. Nobody seems to know why because no one studied the subject. It's just appalling to me.
[3:16:09.120 --> 3:16:26.120]  Now, let me just ask you. The global architects, the Babylon Mystery Schools, they believe in a coming world messiah and in the prototypes that they've had from India and the Middle East, it is generally a brown-skinned man.
[3:16:26.120 --> 3:16:41.120]  And I couldn't believe it when I saw Obama coming that he could be the one and I'm not even getting into a Christian issue here because the elites have their own messiah complex as you know well, Jordan, but for the audience, is he a prototype to their coming world messiah?
[3:16:41.120 --> 3:16:47.120]  Or do you think the elite are actually trying currently to make him be the one?
[3:16:47.120 --> 3:17:08.120]  Well, I'm not sure, but on the one hand I have to say about Obama and his family. I like his presence. His presence is very blackable. His family is very charming and the girls are absolutely charming and I don't have anything against Obama and his family.
[3:17:08.120 --> 3:17:29.120]  But I'm just saying that if you know the symbols, if you've studied them over the years, the words, the terms, the catchphrases, the little small emblems, the words and the terms that are used and begin to study how these symbols are used, what the words mean.
[3:17:29.120 --> 3:17:42.120]  Once you have got that down, then you begin looking at American politics and American presidential politics. It's alarming. It's just staggering.
[3:17:42.120 --> 3:18:04.120]  These are the same terms that Adolf Hitler used, but especially now the Soviet terms and symbols that were, I was talking many years ago, giving lectures back in 67 on Soviet philosophy, symbolism, what it meant and today it is everywhere in your face.
[3:18:04.120 --> 3:18:13.120]  And the newspapers, magazines, television, they're using the same terms that I grew up with since 1967, looking at those terms.
[3:18:13.120 --> 3:18:26.120]  What about the charms? What about the charms? He carries different days, little Norse gods, little monkey gods from the Hindus. He always has these charms with him. What's that about?
[3:18:26.120 --> 3:18:38.120]  Well, I know that's just on the face of it that's frightening and scary because I already know that, like I said, not just America, but the entire earth is in trouble.
[3:18:38.120 --> 3:18:55.120]  The whole world is in trouble. And probably one of the most fantastic things is for me to see around the world, people jumping and in jubilation for the coming of Obama and people are dancing in the streets around the world.
[3:18:55.120 --> 3:19:02.120]  They're never even suspecting what the whole entire agenda really is.
[3:19:02.120 --> 3:19:11.120]  And notice he came right as the crisis was peaking. They engineered it perfectly. As he comes in, he's now got the agenda. He'll save you.
[3:19:11.120 --> 3:19:21.120]  You got it. And it's just amazing to me how much people don't know. They've just, no one has taken the time to look at these symbols.
[3:19:21.120 --> 3:19:29.120]  Well, let me ask you this, and we're going to come back from breaking through it. The monkey charm in Hindu religion, what does that symbolize?
[3:19:29.120 --> 3:19:38.120]  Well, it goes all, you know, like I said, it's just a huge subject on ancient religions. We can talk about that later then.
[3:19:38.120 --> 3:19:55.120]  Okay, well, let's come back and continue with the world agenda. Why are they openly announcing world government, world taxation, world regulation, and saying we've got to get behind Obama, and then Henry Kissinger saying Obama will bring in the new world order on CNBC.
[3:19:55.120 --> 3:20:02.120]  Obama will bring in the new age. Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen. Jordan Maxwell is our guest.
[3:20:02.120 --> 3:20:13.120]  Hello, this is Tom with hempusa.org. Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.

[3:21:01.120 --> 3:21:10.120]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:21:10.120 --> 3:21:17.120]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:21:17.120 --> 3:21:26.120]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:21:26.120 --> 3:21:33.120]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:21:33.120 --> 3:21:42.120]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[3:22:00.120 --> 3:22:07.120]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the US dollar has been evaluating.
[3:22:07.120 --> 3:22:14.120]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances. Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[3:22:14.120 --> 3:22:19.120]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver. They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[3:22:19.120 --> 3:22:31.120]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[3:22:31.120 --> 3:22:37.120]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000. The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[3:27:10.120 --> 3:27:37.120]  www.alomastor.com
[3:27:37.120 --> 3:27:43.120]  As far back as the ancient world, they were using a particular symbol. The ancient kings were.
[3:27:43.120 --> 3:27:48.120]  And the ancient princes were using the symbol everywhere.
[3:27:48.120 --> 3:27:58.120]  And as I said, the Greeks used it. That was used in Egypt. It was used in Babylonia and especially it wasn't used in the Roman Empire.
[3:27:58.120 --> 3:28:09.120]  And of course coming into Britannia and into Europe, it was everywhere among the royals of Europe and now in America it is everywhere.
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:24.120]  And unless you go back to the beginning and see what this thing really meant and trace it through history and begin to see how ancient this apparatus really is, it's not going to really hit you until you see it.
[3:28:24.120 --> 3:28:35.120]  And when you finally see it for the first time, it will be shocking to the world to know this stuff goes back thousands of years.
[3:28:35.120 --> 3:28:43.120]  George Maxwell, why is Kissinger and others hailing Obama as the one that will unify the world and bring in the new world order? Or is that wishful thinking?
[3:28:43.120 --> 3:28:45.120]  I mean, why would they be saying that now about a leader?
[3:28:45.120 --> 3:29:03.120]  I think that they already, because of the symbols that he's using, because of the symbols, words and terms that he's using, it implies for me that this is a very long, well laid out plan that I was seeing already and back in 67.
[3:29:03.120 --> 3:29:19.120]  They were laying out the words, the terms, the strategy and how it was going to come about, the words that would be used, the symbols that would be used. And now to see this happening today with Obama tells me that this is the combination.
[3:29:19.120 --> 3:29:35.120]  This is the final blow on the earth of something that I've been aware of for 40 years and the world has been talking about for thousands of years. It's a very powerful story once you finally see it.
[3:29:35.120 --> 3:29:52.120]  Stay there. Long segment coming up.

[3:31:01.120 --> 3:31:08.120]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:31:08.120 --> 3:31:12.120]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[3:31:12.120 --> 3:31:14.120]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[3:31:14.120 --> 3:31:17.120]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:31:17.120 --> 3:31:24.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:31:24.120 --> 3:31:31.120]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:31:31.120 --> 3:31:35.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:31:35.120 --> 3:31:42.120]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli Intelligence Network,
[3:31:42.120 --> 3:31:54.120]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.

[3:33:14.120 --> 3:33:34.120]  All our times have come, fear but now they're gone. Seasons don't fear the replay, not due to when the sun of the rain.
[3:33:34.120 --> 3:33:48.120]  We can be like they are, come on baby, don't fear the replay, baby take my hand, don't fear the replay, but we'll be able to fly, don't fear the replay, baby I'm gonna land.
[3:33:48.120 --> 3:34:09.120]  We are back live with a real legend in the fight against the globalist of the New World Order, Jordan Maxwell, JordanMaxwell.com, and Jordan I'm about to be out of town for a few days, but if you really want to do that, just try to figure out a time, a place, how you want to do it, and do it as quickly, but also with the quality that you want.
[3:34:09.120 --> 3:34:18.120]  So I'd be honored to work on a film and present your findings to people, and I'm honored that you've said that you'd like to work with me.
[3:34:18.120 --> 3:34:29.120]  Separately in the 27 minutes of airtime we have left here today, I want to explain to people whether they believe in the supernatural or not, the elite do, and that's a fact.
[3:34:29.120 --> 3:34:45.120]  And there's different mystery religions, but they all basically have the same tenets as you go up the pyramidal power structure. But you're seeing in your research the highest level cult is this sunrise cult, or the morning star cult.
[3:34:45.120 --> 3:35:07.120]  And clearly, Oprah Winfrey's, her symbol, governmental symbols, Obama, we are seeing it more and more. They believe they manifest the power by that, and when you study the beliefs of this cult, let us sit on a little bit of your own research on that and why this is such a dangerous time and so horrifying for humanity in your research.
[3:35:07.120 --> 3:35:20.120]  Well, it's hard to put into words, as I said, you need to, it's not something that I could just come out and shoot for a couple of days and it's done. No, this subject is too big.
[3:35:20.120 --> 3:35:42.120]  I've got quite literally hundreds and hundreds of documents, pictures, photographs explaining this story, because it's not easy to talk about, it's not easy to tell, because it's too simple to just mention a particular cult and a particular symbol.
[3:35:42.120 --> 3:36:00.120]  Nobody gets the effect of it. It's when you sit down and you begin to see how Hollywood has used this, how the motion picture industry, how the news organizations, the symbols that are used in government, the symbols which are used in federal and state seals,
[3:36:00.120 --> 3:36:13.120]  and going back into the British Empire and tracing it back, then you begin to see how all-encompassing and overwhelming this particular subject is, and this particular symbol is.
[3:36:13.120 --> 3:36:15.120]  And Arthur C. Clarke?
[3:36:15.120 --> 3:36:27.120]  Yes. Then you begin to see for the first time how massive this web of conspiracy really is. It's massive.
[3:36:27.120 --> 3:36:31.120]  And I'm just appalled that it's not easy.
[3:36:31.120 --> 3:36:39.120]  So you're saying how do you express a huge research that is the continuity of human history and this great mystery?
[3:36:39.120 --> 3:36:45.120]  That's exactly right. And I'm out of lost to do that, because I don't have the funding to do something like that.
[3:36:45.120 --> 3:36:59.120]  I've got all kinds of professional people on the West Coast in Hollywood who know me and who know that my work is served as a means spring for many television shows and movies and books,
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:07.120]  and all kinds of people are using my stuff over the years, because I share it freely with everyone in Hollywood.
[3:37:07.120 --> 3:37:17.120]  And I've been here for 48 years, so everyone knows that. And they've used stuff directly out of Da Vinci Code, used things directly out of my videos.
[3:37:17.120 --> 3:37:31.120]  The whole concept of the conspiratorial apparatus, Founding America, I've talked about that many, many years ago, and the Knights Templars, all of that I've been talking about around in Hollywood for years.
[3:37:31.120 --> 3:37:44.120]  But I've got something Hollywood doesn't have yet, and I've had some movie offers coming to motion picture companies coming wanting to do a movie on it, on this one particular symbol, this one particular work I'm talking about.
[3:37:44.120 --> 3:37:51.120]  And I've turned them down, because I know until this thing can be done right, I don't want to put out.
[3:37:51.120 --> 3:38:01.120]  Well, Jordan, last time we talked and you brought this up to me, just tell me what your blueprint is and how you want it done, and if you do want me to work on it with you, I'd be glad to.
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:07.120]  But regardless, just get it done. Get this information out to people, regardless of who does it. Make sure you get it done.
[3:38:07.120 --> 3:38:21.120]  Well, I know because I don't want to leave this planet until this work is done, and it's something that has caught my attention for over 40 years. I've been looking at this one subject and it's very, very powerful stuff.
[3:38:21.120 --> 3:38:27.120]  And I can't think of anybody that could do more with it than you.
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:37.120]  So that's why I'd like to have you a part of this, because I'd like for you to handle it and put it out there, because I don't have the wherewithal to do any of this.
[3:38:37.120 --> 3:38:47.120]  I need somebody that has a system already in operation that can distribute and can get to the largest amount of people, and you have a huge audience.
[3:38:47.120 --> 3:38:57.120]  So that's why I mentioned before that I'd like to maybe possibly do something with you in relation to this subject, but you're going to have to see it for yourself first.
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:07.120]  Jordan, what I'll do is I'm going to be out on the West Coast soon, very soon. I'm about to be out there this weekend, but I have something else I have to do.
[3:39:07.120 --> 3:39:11.120]  So I need to come out there and see you.
[3:39:11.120 --> 3:39:21.120]  Yes, yes. I would like for you to come here, see me, sit here, and spend an hour here, and let me just go through the basics.
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:31.120]  Let me just go through it slowly and show you the progression of the story, so at least you have in your mind the concept and how large it really is.
[3:39:31.120 --> 3:39:36.120]  All right, well, I'm honored. Let's pull the trigger on it. I'll get out there as soon as I can when it's a good day for you.
[3:39:36.120 --> 3:39:41.120]  A couple days at least. Like you said, I don't want you to take a while. I've got more time in an hour if you've got it.
[3:39:41.120 --> 3:39:45.120]  And then just tell me how you want it done. Let's pull the trigger on it, Jordan.
[3:39:45.120 --> 3:39:47.120]  I think that would be great.
[3:39:47.120 --> 3:39:55.120]  Well, thank you. This is exciting. We have so many of these discussions on the air. Perhaps we might have it privately as well.
[3:39:55.120 --> 3:40:10.120]  Yes, because I'm telling you, Alex, I have something here that I know is so explosive and so incredibly mind boggling when it's finally presented correctly,
[3:40:10.120 --> 3:40:19.120]  so that you begin to see the progression of the use of this symbol, how it is used by the different cults, different religions of the world,
[3:40:19.120 --> 3:40:28.120]  how it is used by the different governments, all governments of the world, all the royalty of Europe have used this word in terms of symbols,
[3:40:28.120 --> 3:40:37.120]  and then to see it now finally unfold display right now in America, it will finally hit you how big this thing really is.
[3:40:37.120 --> 3:40:43.120]  And that signifies, though, that's what I keep asking. I mean, the fact that they're now going with everything, they suddenly display the symbol,
[3:40:43.120 --> 3:40:53.120]  you know, moving away from the eye to the rising sun over the earth, they move into that, which I guess signifies in their hierarchy,
[3:40:53.120 --> 3:40:57.120]  and correct me if I'm wrong, that they are now engaging what the final plan?
[3:40:57.120 --> 3:41:11.120]  Yes, yes. The ultimate final conclusion to thousands of years of a plan that was laid out a long time ago is finally being blanketed across the world,
[3:41:11.120 --> 3:41:22.120]  and no one is able to comprehend how large this thing is, how big it is, and the implications of it.
[3:41:22.120 --> 3:41:33.120]  It's just a staggering story, and I don't even know what to do with it. I don't even know how to explain to the audience how big this thing really is,
[3:41:33.120 --> 3:41:47.120]  how ancient it is, and how serious our existence is on this earth because of this incredible ancient apparatus that was set up thousands of years ago,
[3:41:47.120 --> 3:41:55.120]  and the whole idea is coming from the darkness of night into the new light of a new world order.
[3:41:55.120 --> 3:42:04.120]  Well, did you hear his acceptance speech where he kept saying the new age, the new age, the new age, Barack Obama went, well, his inaugural speech.
[3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:05.120]  Please continue.
[3:42:05.120 --> 3:42:10.120]  Yes, I know. It's all part and parcel of what I'm talking about.
[3:42:10.120 --> 3:42:14.120]  Coming into the new age, coming into the new light, why are you saying that's so dangerous?
[3:42:14.120 --> 3:42:30.120]  It is profoundly dangerous because the people who are doing it, they have, look at, the best way I can explain it is that for years, kids, years ago,
[3:42:30.120 --> 3:42:36.120]  kids used to talk on the phone in front of their parents and use terms, and they still do today.
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:46.120]  They could use terms and catchphrases which the young people understand but which the adults don't, and so the kids could be sitting right in the front room talking in front of their parents
[3:42:46.120 --> 3:42:55.120]  and talking about a drug deal or something really nefarious, and the parents are hearing it and they don't understand at all the terms that are being used,
[3:42:55.120 --> 3:42:57.120]  and the catchphrase is what they mean.
[3:42:57.120 --> 3:43:02.120]  Well, the same thing is true today with the elite who are running the world.
[3:43:02.120 --> 3:43:10.120]  They have a lingo, they have symbols of words and terms that they use among themselves, that they know what they're talking about,
[3:43:10.120 --> 3:43:17.120]  and they realize that the people of the world have no idea about what they're saying, what it means.
[3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:25.120]  And once you've cracked this code of words and terms, it's staggering and it's frightening and it's implications.
[3:43:25.120 --> 3:43:31.120]  Because they're saying, at least with the Earth First Battalion and what the Pentagon says,
[3:43:31.120 --> 3:43:38.120]  and what General Stubblebine and others have said, that the new age means killing most of us, doesn't it?
[3:43:38.120 --> 3:43:44.120]  Well, I'm afraid so, yes, because it's part of the agenda.
[3:43:44.120 --> 3:43:50.120]  And the new man, the cybernetic merger of humans into machines and the extermination of the majority of us.
[3:43:50.120 --> 3:43:59.120]  That's right, because they are dumbing down the humans while making the machines and the computers able to think for themselves.
[3:43:59.120 --> 3:44:04.120]  And so in America, we like to brag that we've got computers that can think for themselves.
[3:44:04.120 --> 3:44:07.120]  And I say, thank God, because the people can't.
[3:44:07.120 --> 3:44:14.120]  So the new age, one facet, I know I oversimplified all, but one facet of the new age is the new man, the new creation.
[3:44:14.120 --> 3:44:15.120]  That's right.
[3:44:15.120 --> 3:44:18.120]  And the old man goes, bye-bye.
[3:44:18.120 --> 3:44:19.120]  You've got it.
[3:44:19.120 --> 3:44:22.120]  That's exactly one of the most important terms is the new man.
[3:44:22.120 --> 3:44:31.120]  And when you begin to see what that term new man actually implies and why Adolf Hitler talked about all the time,
[3:44:31.120 --> 3:44:37.120]  creating the new man, why Stalin and his writings talked about the coming of the new man.
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:43.120]  When you see the Communist symbols and words and terms that were used by the Communist Party all around the world,
[3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:48.120]  talking about the coming of the new man, when the sun would rise on a new order.
[3:44:48.120 --> 3:44:55.120]  Once you begin to see this, then you see how very powerful and ancient and old and well financed this,
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:44:59.120]  this whole monstrosity on the human race really is.
[3:44:59.120 --> 3:45:05.120]  And then for the first time, you begin to see how serious in trouble we really are.
[3:45:05.120 --> 3:45:07.120]  And without saying any names.
[3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:08.120]  Everywhere.
[3:45:08.120 --> 3:45:09.120]  It's everywhere.
[3:45:09.120 --> 3:45:12.120]  Without saying names, getting into arguments with other people out there.
[3:45:12.120 --> 3:45:13.120]  A lot of them are misled.
[3:45:13.120 --> 3:45:17.120]  A lot of folks have taken your deep research and then added onto it.
[3:45:17.120 --> 3:45:19.120]  Oh, but we're going to have a new man.
[3:45:19.120 --> 3:45:24.120]  So they've co-opted your research and others' research and then added by telling you about the new world order.
[3:45:24.120 --> 3:45:26.120]  They say, oh, but there's this new man coming.
[3:45:26.120 --> 3:45:32.120]  We're going to come together and have this new system and the computers will rule us because they're fair.
[3:45:32.120 --> 3:45:38.120]  And then you get blamed for the people putting out that message claiming it's your message when your message is actually the opposite.
[3:45:38.120 --> 3:45:39.120]  Exactly.
[3:45:39.120 --> 3:45:46.120]  And that's happened to be on many different fronts because I will use terms that are in the Bible
[3:45:46.120 --> 3:45:50.120]  and I'm trying to explain what they mean in relation to my research.
[3:45:50.120 --> 3:45:56.120]  Then people go out and say, well, Jordan is saying this is not and therefore he obviously is working for the government.
[3:45:56.120 --> 3:45:58.120]  He's working for the conspiracy.
[3:45:58.120 --> 3:46:04.120]  I'm just appalled because I'm not able to really put anything out there into the public.
[3:46:04.120 --> 3:46:08.120]  Because this is so nuanced and sophisticated and multifaceted.
[3:46:08.120 --> 3:46:15.120]  You're saying they're going to come in with the dictatorship of the machines and the cybernetic merger and other things that they say are coming.
[3:46:15.120 --> 3:46:23.120]  You're saying they've built all of this to then have a false revolution and bring in this control and that others come and take your research,
[3:46:23.120 --> 3:46:27.120]  get everybody on board with the research and then say, but the new man, that will fix it.
[3:46:27.120 --> 3:46:30.120]  The false revolution, the false new age.
[3:46:30.120 --> 3:46:34.120]  Well, that's exactly what the Bible talks about, how the devil works.
[3:46:34.120 --> 3:46:44.120]  Even in Scripture, even in Christianity, Christians aren't aware that there is a concept that the dark side will use what is good to deceive.
[3:46:44.120 --> 3:46:48.120]  And that even the elect could be deceived is so well done.
[3:46:48.120 --> 3:46:53.120]  Well, absolutely, it's counterfeit.
[3:46:53.120 --> 3:47:06.120]  But unless you understand and are able to sit for an hour or so and watch a presentation that was showing the symbols that were used thousands of years ago,
[3:47:06.120 --> 3:47:14.120]  used in Rome, used in England, and today are being used here, finally hit you what I'm talking about.
[3:47:14.120 --> 3:47:16.120]  It's something you have to see.
[3:47:16.120 --> 3:47:22.120]  You have to watch the progression in order to understand the severity of what I'm talking about.
[3:47:22.120 --> 3:47:23.120]  Well, I'm honored.
[3:47:23.120 --> 3:47:29.120]  Let's get on the horn very soon and set up a time to do that.
[3:47:29.120 --> 3:47:38.120]  Now, specifically, without giving out the deep knowledge you've got, which you know will then be misconstrued, mispackaged, thus destroying a message.
[3:47:38.120 --> 3:47:39.120]  That's why you can't come out of that.
[3:47:39.120 --> 3:47:48.120]  I've grown the same page where I know you've done deeper research than I've, but you notice I'm throwing out basically what it is here.
[3:47:48.120 --> 3:47:55.120]  Just talking about what we're facing in the upheaval, more stage terror attacks, more economic collapse, open world government bank being set up,
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:48:03.120]  carbon taxes with bureaucratic regulators over every facet of our lives, shutting down all small industry farms and ranches, gun confiscation,
[3:48:03.120 --> 3:48:06.120]  giant youth brigades, it's all being announced.
[3:48:06.120 --> 3:48:09.120]  And exactly when the symbol manifests, now they're launching.
[3:48:09.120 --> 3:48:16.120]  Now, is this a beta test prototype or what I'm saying is, because you know they built minis before they built the big one,
[3:48:16.120 --> 3:48:22.120]  or does this in the battle configuration look like it is the final wavelength of the final signature?
[3:48:22.120 --> 3:48:25.120]  I think it is the final, last and final move.
[3:48:25.120 --> 3:48:28.120]  This is, in my humble opinion, this is it.
[3:48:28.120 --> 3:48:30.120]  There is nothing to come after this.
[3:48:30.120 --> 3:48:32.120]  You have never said that before.
[3:48:32.120 --> 3:48:34.120]  You have never said that in 49 years of research.
[3:48:34.120 --> 3:48:36.120]  You've never said this is it.
[3:48:36.120 --> 3:48:37.120]  This is it.
[3:48:37.120 --> 3:48:45.120]  But as far as I'm concerned, there is no doubt in my mind, because I've watched the steps and watched it progress over the years
[3:48:45.120 --> 3:48:52.120]  and looked at it from every point of view. I've taken this to other authors, writers, researchers, and private,
[3:48:52.120 --> 3:48:56.120]  and they're looking at it and we're studying this thing.
[3:48:56.120 --> 3:49:03.120]  Up until now, I have always believed that there was going to be some way that people would wake up and find out
[3:49:03.120 --> 3:49:05.120]  and be able to thwart this thing.
[3:49:05.120 --> 3:49:12.120]  But now, I am totally convinced that the last and final stroke has been put into place now.
[3:49:12.120 --> 3:49:16.120]  And now, it's the survival of the human rights now.
[3:49:16.120 --> 3:49:19.120]  Now, it is cosmic in proportion.
[3:49:19.120 --> 3:49:24.120]  Because once the elite engage all these thousands of years of programming, conditioning, and preparation,
[3:49:24.120 --> 3:49:26.120]  this isn't even a machine they can turn off, is it?
[3:49:26.120 --> 3:49:28.120]  That's right. Exactly.
[3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:30.120]  It's not something that they have control over anymore.
[3:49:30.120 --> 3:49:33.120]  Now, it is cosmic in proportion.
[3:49:33.120 --> 3:49:36.120]  It is the basis for governments.
[3:49:36.120 --> 3:49:43.120]  The symbol is used in governmental systems, educational systems, law enforcement, and military.
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:47.120]  And you're saying there is an above...let's just get down to bottom lines.
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:49.120]  Christians can call it spiritual entities, whatever.
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:51.120]  The elite believe this in their own writings.
[3:49:51.120 --> 3:49:54.120]  There is an above human government that's been directing things.
[3:49:54.120 --> 3:49:57.120]  Oh, you can bet on that. There is no doubt in my mind.
[3:49:57.120 --> 3:50:03.120]  That's why so many people have asked and talked about my religious faith as to whether I believe in God.
[3:50:03.120 --> 3:50:06.120]  I have no problem at all believing in God.
[3:50:06.120 --> 3:50:13.120]  I have no problem believing in the divine because I have studied the occult world for many, many years.
[3:50:13.120 --> 3:50:20.120]  I know what these symbols and religions, where they've come from, how they were co-opted,
[3:50:20.120 --> 3:50:24.120]  put into use by the elite powers of the world.
[3:50:24.120 --> 3:50:31.120]  I have no doubt in my mind that there is a God and I have nothing but praise and honor for spirituality.
[3:50:31.120 --> 3:50:38.120]  But I'm telling you, and I don't even...at this point I don't even care how people view this statement.
[3:50:38.120 --> 3:50:45.120]  The religions of this world are, as just as the Scripture says, all flesh has lost its way.
[3:50:45.120 --> 3:50:50.120]  You have no idea in the world to what extent religions have been co-opted by the dark side,
[3:50:50.120 --> 3:50:54.120]  and it's right in your face. We just don't see it.
[3:50:54.120 --> 3:50:56.120]  And the dark side always tells riddles.
[3:50:56.120 --> 3:51:00.120]  They say they're bringing the light. They're really bringing the dark sunshine.
[3:51:00.120 --> 3:51:02.120]  They're bringing the darkness.
[3:51:30.120 --> 3:51:34.120]  No shoe binding for $8 or $48 a dozen, and so much more.
[3:51:34.120 --> 3:51:38.120]  Even hard to find surplus items all at surplus prices.
[3:51:38.120 --> 3:51:43.120]  Preparing the whole family has never been so affordable at mainmilitary.com.
[3:51:43.120 --> 3:51:48.120]  Mainmilitary.com, one of the last surviving true surplus stores in the country.

[3:53:01.120 --> 3:53:04.120]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[3:53:04.120 --> 3:53:08.120]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[3:53:08.120 --> 3:53:11.120]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science,
[3:53:11.120 --> 3:53:14.120]  one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.

[3:53:19.120 --> 3:53:22.120]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly,
[3:53:22.120 --> 3:53:25.120]  emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[3:53:25.120 --> 3:53:28.120]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[3:53:28.120 --> 3:53:33.120]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[3:53:33.120 --> 3:53:36.120]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts,

[3:54:10.120 --> 3:54:15.120]  Think of how dear and sweet the children of the world are, how innocent the light of God in their eyes.
[3:54:15.120 --> 3:54:20.120]  Think about all the people that have struggled against tyranny and oppression
[3:54:20.120 --> 3:54:23.120]  so that we have some monocle of liberty.
[3:54:23.120 --> 3:54:26.120]  And then think about the great darkness the Newell Order is forging, all their crimes,
[3:54:26.120 --> 3:54:30.120]  all the wicked things they've done, how they enjoy hurting the innocent.
[3:54:30.120 --> 3:54:34.120]  We are in maternal fight against evil. It is good versus evil.
[3:54:34.120 --> 3:54:38.120]  And evil is making its greatest move in history.
[3:54:38.120 --> 3:54:44.120]  Right now, all of the elite's own words, planets are aligned.
[3:54:44.120 --> 3:54:51.120]  They are going into high gear. They believe this is their jump point, their move.
[3:54:51.120 --> 3:54:55.120]  We have no future that we don't struggle and fight back and speak out now
[3:54:55.120 --> 3:54:59.120]  and have a mass awakening against this system.
[3:54:59.120 --> 3:55:02.120]  Jordan, just in summation because the show's basically over,
[3:55:02.120 --> 3:55:06.120]  how do you see this in the last four minutes playing out?
[3:55:06.120 --> 3:55:09.120]  I mean, is there a light at the end of the tunnel that isn't afraid train coming at us?
[3:55:09.120 --> 3:55:11.120]  Is there a way if people...
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:16.120]  I see folks actually waking up in mass. They're not waking up with the sophistication of the attack
[3:55:16.120 --> 3:55:19.120]  but I do see the massive beginnings of it.
[3:55:19.120 --> 3:55:23.120]  So I see a lot of positives actually. I understand the enemy's making its move
[3:55:23.120 --> 3:55:26.120]  but I also believe in the due sex.
[3:55:26.120 --> 3:55:32.120]  The unseen goodness, unseen help also throughout history.
[3:55:32.120 --> 3:55:34.120]  The balance.
[3:55:34.120 --> 3:55:37.120]  I appreciate what you're saying.
[3:55:37.120 --> 3:55:44.120]  Myself, I just question whether the human race is going to be able to extricate itself out of this mess
[3:55:44.120 --> 3:55:49.120]  because unless and until you understand what your enemy is really all about
[3:55:49.120 --> 3:55:52.120]  and what is actually happening here
[3:55:52.120 --> 3:55:58.120]  and the military has planners and people in the CIA who plan things
[3:55:58.120 --> 3:56:01.120]  and getting intelligence.
[3:56:01.120 --> 3:56:09.120]  And as far as I'm concerned, I don't see much intelligence being done in the so-called truth movement
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:17.120]  because they do not have a grasp on the cosmic size of this thing.
[3:56:17.120 --> 3:56:21.120]  We're all looking at the different problems and they're all right there in your face.
[3:56:21.120 --> 3:56:24.120]  And we're looking at the low level puppets and minions in front men.
[3:56:24.120 --> 3:56:26.120]  Right, and that's what we're looking at.
[3:56:26.120 --> 3:56:28.120]  Yeah, never looking past it.
[3:56:28.120 --> 3:56:33.120]  I'm telling you there's something far, far bigger and far worse.
[3:56:33.120 --> 3:56:37.120]  The implications are absolutely frightening for the human race.
[3:56:37.120 --> 3:56:39.120]  And I've been working on this for a long time
[3:56:39.120 --> 3:56:43.120]  and I would like to be able to do something with it before I leave here.
[3:56:43.120 --> 3:56:51.120]  But is God, is God, I mean, is the creative, you know, energy of the universe, the creator?
[3:56:51.120 --> 3:56:54.120]  I mean, will God allow that to happen?
[3:56:54.120 --> 3:56:58.120]  There's good and evil.
[3:56:58.120 --> 3:57:00.120]  Well, that's another subject.
[3:57:00.120 --> 3:57:03.120]  I hate to talk about it because I don't want to offend anybody.
[3:57:03.120 --> 3:57:06.120]  But by their fruits, you will know them.
[3:57:06.120 --> 3:57:12.120]  Christianity is praying every day for protection, for this and for that, for God to help them.
[3:57:12.120 --> 3:57:16.120]  And yet darkness is growing on the earth every day.
[3:57:16.120 --> 3:57:18.120]  Goodness is dying every day.
[3:57:18.120 --> 3:57:23.120]  Any time any wisdom is out there or anything of any real value,
[3:57:23.120 --> 3:57:27.120]  the dark side will crush it and crush it into out of existence.
[3:57:27.120 --> 3:57:32.120]  So I'm just saying that people who have religious beliefs
[3:57:32.120 --> 3:57:38.120]  have better start looking at where their religious church and beliefs have actually come from
[3:57:38.120 --> 3:57:46.120]  and what these words actually mean, but just a blind faith is not going to help anything anymore.
[3:57:46.120 --> 3:57:51.120]  We are in serious trouble and people have better start looking for the real truth
[3:57:51.120 --> 3:57:54.120]  because the more you pray, the worse things are getting.
[3:57:54.120 --> 3:57:59.120]  And until you understand who your enemy is and understand it thoroughly and correctly,
[3:57:59.120 --> 3:58:03.120]  you're never going to be able to get yourself out of the mess.
[3:58:03.120 --> 3:58:05.120]  Yeah, most religious people, especially Christians,
[3:58:05.120 --> 3:58:07.120]  think they're praying to one God and they're praying to another.
[3:58:07.120 --> 3:58:08.120]  That's what you're saying.
[3:58:08.120 --> 3:58:10.120]  You got that right. That's exactly what's happening.
[3:58:10.120 --> 3:58:13.120]  All right, Jordan, I will talk to you very soon.
[3:58:13.120 --> 3:58:16.120]  In fact, I'll even call you this evening if that's a good time for tomorrow.
[3:58:16.120 --> 3:58:18.120]  That's fine. That's fine.
[3:58:18.120 --> 3:58:22.120]  Make sure everyone goes on the website and check it out because I got a lot of stuff there.
[3:58:22.120 --> 3:58:25.120]  Now, a lot of books and key videos, jordanmaxwell.com.
