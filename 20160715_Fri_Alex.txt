[00:00.000 --> 00:19.680]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:30.000 --> 00:45.440]  31-year-old Mohammed Lahoyage Buhulel from Tunisia North Africa ran over and
[00:45.440 --> 00:50.880]  killed 83 people last night he targeted a celebration he knew was full of men
[00:50.880 --> 00:56.000]  women and most importantly children and witnesses are reporting that he attempted
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  to like something out of a dystopic road warrior movie target and run down the children
[01:03.600 --> 01:08.880]  will there be a mad max response to this certainly not we'll be taught more sensitivity training
[01:10.480 --> 01:14.480]  that's what the london mayor is calling for you need to submit to the muslims and they'll stop
[01:14.480 --> 01:22.240]  killing you but don't worry it's up on info wars dot com media blames truck not terrorist
[01:22.240 --> 01:31.760]  or islam for the niece attack and we have cnn we have the new york times when you go to cnn.com
[01:31.760 --> 01:37.120]  like i did this morning i took these screenshots and send to watson when you go and look at this
[01:37.120 --> 01:44.080]  there were more than 15 articles i looked at scrolling down that said truck attack truck maniac
[01:44.080 --> 01:53.920]  man in truck goes berserk no it was a cold calculated jihad attack on little children
[01:55.520 --> 02:00.480]  now when a cop who's wrong or a cop who's in a bad situation or a cop who's psycho
[02:00.480 --> 02:03.680]  shoots a innocent person in the back be they black or white you're going to see it on the news
[02:04.880 --> 02:10.080]  they're going to be personalized one man dies as a tragedy 10 000 dies in statistic
[02:10.080 --> 02:16.640]  but when islam does this you try to show the footage on facebook youtube you name it they are
[02:16.640 --> 02:22.080]  shutting you down but i've seen the footage it was about 5 30 i just gotten home was walking
[02:22.080 --> 02:30.960]  in to say hi to my children i'm sitting there in the parking lot of my house in the driveway and
[02:30.960 --> 02:38.480]  i go i'm gonna check in force and i go there boom dozens run over in niece i go okay i know where
[02:38.480 --> 02:43.120]  to go to act to have something even i had a us this just happened 50 minutes ago boom got a
[02:43.120 --> 02:49.040]  drug it's like 15 articles everything bam bam bam bam bam uh you know 50 something dead at that
[02:49.040 --> 02:54.640]  time now it's 80 plus and i just turned the car around and drove right back over here to the office
[02:54.640 --> 03:01.920]  we did two hours and then fours nightly news live and then aired the news after that as i said months
[03:01.920 --> 03:07.600]  ago as i said years ago and it's kind of a sick feeling to see bill o'reilly now picking it up
[03:07.600 --> 03:11.360]  and uh new generous because they're usually so wrong but they're totally right this time
[03:12.560 --> 03:20.800]  this is a war against the west this is a slow motion tet offensive or tet two as we've been
[03:20.800 --> 03:24.800]  warning you and this is only the beginning you notice the attacks are getting bigger and they're
[03:24.800 --> 03:31.600]  getting closer together and france is close to 30 islamic now a lot of folks are converting under
[03:31.600 --> 03:42.080]  pressure they're not going to go back you can't deport them without a civil war france is gone
[03:42.720 --> 03:48.080]  it's gone england is almost gone the mayor has declared it's an islamic city he said we don't
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.560]  care about briggs that we're staying with the e u that's open the borders to islam's invasion
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.200]  the e u bureaucrats have allied with islam that is not rhetoric this is actually happening
[03:57.200 --> 04:02.320]  and i used to hear this from pentagon people 15 years ago and i'd say you guys are paranoid it's
[04:02.320 --> 04:07.520]  crazy you know this clash of civilizations is bad news you're going to stir this up well the pentagon
[04:07.520 --> 04:11.040]  is not bad they're the ones fighting it but the globalists above it are the ones that have started
[04:11.040 --> 04:15.760]  up and let me tell you it's on you you're going to see more and more of these attacks that are
[04:15.760 --> 04:20.160]  going to get more and more frequent and it was incredible last night we have it in live time
[04:20.160 --> 04:28.480]  video during the broadcast trying to upload videos that we shot live sections facebook would not let
[04:28.480 --> 04:35.760]  you put in any words about islamic terror anything in the descriptions in live time just wouldn't
[04:35.760 --> 04:41.200]  let you put it so it's not just the president tells you what words to use now and no one will
[04:41.200 --> 04:48.320]  say islamic terror now they won't let you just like an iphone won't let you say a cuss word or
[04:48.320 --> 04:54.880]  whatever you try to say the f word it puts the word duck in now the ai is controlling everything
[04:54.880 --> 05:02.720]  in live time this is information warfare against us let's just media outlets reacted to the devastating
[05:02.720 --> 05:07.920]  attack in the east not by blaming islam or even terrorists but by suggesting that an inanimate
[05:07.920 --> 05:13.760]  object the truck was responsible for the carnage instead of pointing our fingers at islamis cnn cbc
[05:13.760 --> 05:18.800]  in the new york times all published headlines the serve to hide the true nature of the attack cbc
[05:18.800 --> 05:24.160]  reported children feared killed in these is truck attacks family events presumably the truck was
[05:24.160 --> 05:30.400]  somehow able to manifest artificial intelligence and plow itself through dozens of victims way to
[05:30.400 --> 05:36.480]  go mainstream media ding ding ding not to be all done CNN reported truck rams crowd 84 dead
[05:36.480 --> 05:42.720]  and these again providing a convenient way to avoid any mention of the ideology that inspired
[05:42.720 --> 05:48.560]  the driver did it rhyme with aloha snack bar the new york times went with truck attack on french
[05:48.560 --> 05:54.240]  crowd scores died again painting the blame on the vehicle rather than the islamist inside it you can

[06:59.920 --> 07:04.880]  if you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but we're waiting for an outrageously
[07:04.880 --> 07:10.000]  low price you are not going to want to miss this important message here's why my friends we already
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.440]  see major power grid problems and it's getting worse so please listen solar generators really do
[07:15.440 --> 07:21.360]  provide lifesaving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run silently amid no
[07:21.360 --> 07:26.720]  fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun whether it's dangerous summer storms blackouts
[07:26.720 --> 07:31.440]  intensifying civil unrest you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep
[07:31.440 --> 07:36.080]  and here's the best news if you want to get one this week solutions from science has a big sale
[07:36.080 --> 07:41.520]  on their fast charge solar generators and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of
[07:41.520 --> 07:46.720]  off the grid gear in addition to the low price for info wars listeners so it's a good time to check
[07:46.720 --> 07:52.240]  it out go to grid wars dot com that's grid wars dot com it's a great opportunity to generate
[07:52.240 --> 08:02.720]  maximum electricity with minimum money go to grid wars dot com that's grid wars dot com
[08:02.720 --> 08:16.560]  well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.560]  you won't hear me
[08:28.560 --> 08:38.400]  me
[08:45.840 --> 08:54.240]  the globalists are setting up a planetary system of total control they are allied with the communist
[08:54.240 --> 09:03.600]  chinese and with the islamist in the middle east run by the saudi arabian wahhabist if you control
[09:03.600 --> 09:08.160]  china with a billion three hundred million people you control the economic destiny of the world
[09:08.160 --> 09:14.400]  and now to a great extent the military destiny and the power is being transferred in a double cross
[09:14.400 --> 09:19.520]  by the globalist to china i that that is my own analysis i've been studying it for decades
[09:19.520 --> 09:25.840]  undoubtedly the transfer is being made long term probably 20 30 years but but the transfer
[09:25.840 --> 09:30.720]  is being made the globalists have admitted that they call it the chinese century uh what it is
[09:30.720 --> 09:38.960]  is the dehumanization history uh a century the new century of total tyranny but if you control
[09:38.960 --> 09:44.400]  the middle east with the wahhabist and and and uh saudi arabia that's geographically right in the
[09:44.400 --> 09:52.960]  middle and you control 80 of islam that is sunni based that again comes right out of saudi arabia
[09:53.920 --> 10:03.920]  you can then control east asia central asia your asia eastern europe much of uh northern africa
[10:05.600 --> 10:08.000]  eastern africa down into central africa
[10:08.000 --> 10:17.120]  and then we've got islamic seed pods invasion ships i mean that's what this is like is an alien
[10:17.120 --> 10:22.320]  invasion folks being set down in all our major cities they're buying off our leadership they're
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.440]  moving in with political correctness to censor our speech they're installing their islamic mayors
[10:28.240 --> 10:34.880]  this is not just a class of civilizations the deal's been made to just to kill the west
[10:34.880 --> 10:39.920]  and to shut down true liberalism and it's being orchestrated by the so-called liberals
[10:40.720 --> 10:47.680]  who are nothing but corporate fascist a lot of real liberals and academics would call them neo
[10:47.680 --> 10:55.040]  liberals but this is very very serious and they've moved their timetable up because they know europe's
[10:55.040 --> 11:00.320]  waking up to globalism africa is waking up to globalism latin america is waking up to globalism
[11:00.320 --> 11:07.040]  the different sectors of asia are waking up to globalism russia is in full resistance to globalism
[11:07.040 --> 11:10.960]  right now that does not mean russia is in a predator group it doesn't have its own corruption
[11:10.960 --> 11:19.840]  but it's old-fashioned male-driven strongman gangster stuff just it's it's completely different
[11:19.840 --> 11:25.520]  than what we are dealing with right now we're dealing with globalists launching an ai takeover
[11:25.520 --> 11:31.920]  the russians are banning gmo throwing it out of their country saying it's a genetic takeover
[11:31.920 --> 11:37.280]  economic warfare saying carbon taxes are a world government takeover meant to destroy the nation
[11:37.280 --> 11:42.400]  state and the family and bring down the west say which one about the russians by the month they
[11:42.400 --> 11:47.920]  become this broadcast and it's and it's been articles written that like russian leadership's
[11:47.920 --> 11:54.000]  turning into alex jones nobody's turning into alex jones okay i have eyeballs i know what's
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.640]  going on i have a brain i'm seeing the same thing russia's saying you'd have to be a moron not to see
[12:00.640 --> 12:07.760]  it and i'm not lionizing russia in this whole thing i'm explaining to you they're paying people to
[12:07.760 --> 12:13.920]  have kids they're exposing world government they're blocking the anti-family agenda they are exposing
[12:13.920 --> 12:20.320]  the radical jihad forces of saudi arabia being funded by the the traders that have taken over our
[12:20.320 --> 12:30.240]  nations so that's basically how the chess pieces sit the navy seal the best-selling author the
[12:30.240 --> 12:36.000]  researcher who's a very humble man that came highly recommended by um people i trust at the pentagon
[12:37.200 --> 12:42.000]  mr bracken is going to be joining us he warned two years ago of the tet due offensive that he
[12:42.000 --> 12:49.440]  believed would start being launched in 2016 an islamic tet offensive and it's definitely here now
[12:49.440 --> 12:55.840]  now we have told you this is a war on western civilization now that's been adopted by newt
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.440]  genrich bill o'reilly and fox news again not bragging we're just pointing out we know what
[13:01.440 --> 13:13.200]  we're dealing with cnn msnbc abc news the new york times all of them will not say islamic terror
[13:13.200 --> 13:17.840]  and our article is up on info wars dot com it needs to go viral media blames truck not
[13:17.840 --> 13:24.880]  not care us or islam for the niece attack that's killed 83 with more than 50 fighting for their
[13:24.880 --> 13:32.160]  lives right now and a man on a motorcycle tried to drive up to the side and climb in and stop him
[13:32.160 --> 13:36.800]  a la road warrior and got killed there were a lot of heroes over there and a lot of men that
[13:36.800 --> 13:41.040]  tried to get into the truck but they were shot by this guy oh you have total gunman in france
[13:41.040 --> 13:44.320]  but this guy had a gun the jihadis always have a gun because they're bringing them in
[13:44.320 --> 13:50.320]  again just like the last mastermind of the theater attack was a migrant
[13:51.920 --> 13:55.840]  whose new job once he got into france a year before was bringing in more migrants just like
[13:55.840 --> 14:03.680]  the nightclub shooter at pulse nightclub his father-in-law runs a major program in the refugees
[14:03.680 --> 14:07.120]  and there's a new story out at info wars dot com is from right bart dot com
[14:07.120 --> 14:13.360]  com hillary wants to bring in a million quote islamic refugees in the first year
[14:15.600 --> 14:20.000]  see this is how it always works they tell you it's 10 000 it's 100 000 when they tell you it's
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.480]  100 000 it's a million when they tell you it's a million it's five million we've seen the metric
[14:24.480 --> 14:29.760]  in europe just two years ago they were saying it was a hundred thousand it was two million then
[14:29.760 --> 14:43.200]  it's five million now admitted comprende and folks they are bringing in military age men in every
[14:43.200 --> 14:49.680]  photo in every video in in in nato and interpulse on admissions 80 percent are military age men
[14:50.640 --> 14:57.360]  and almost all of the syrian passports are fake and they're just let in they're not syrians
[14:57.360 --> 15:05.600]  which these are the invasion force that entered syria like the huns or or the mongols you have
[15:05.600 --> 15:11.040]  the military force goes in with these uh suny invasions they've done it all over the middle east
[15:11.760 --> 15:21.920]  100 and 15 years ago in 1901 the house of sod controlled 200 square miles in the middle of
[15:21.920 --> 15:32.480]  Saudi Arabia a few years later they controlled all of Saudi Arabia by 1932 33 excuse me they
[15:32.480 --> 15:39.920]  had control of the entire middle east this is what they do they go in with the forces and behind
[15:39.920 --> 15:46.480]  them come the men women and the children like locust they just steal everything murder everyone
[15:46.480 --> 15:52.880]  with hillary funding them with all the sick weird freakazoid hillary supporters is loving it
[15:52.880 --> 15:58.000]  oh christians are being married good these are these are evil people that know their ally with
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.840]  their muscle and they hate america and the free market and the second amendment so much the average
[16:03.840 --> 16:10.080]  liberal i've talked to actually knows this and can't wait to see the west fall these are the
[16:10.080 --> 16:15.200]  anti liberals and as an enemy they call themselves liberals you've got to understand this folks
[16:15.200 --> 16:20.640]  everything is upside down liberal means you keep more money liberal means you can raise your children
[16:20.640 --> 16:24.320]  as you see fit liberal means you have private property rights liberal means you can practice
[16:24.320 --> 16:30.560]  whatever religion you want as long as you don't harm our others liberal means you can live your own
[16:30.560 --> 16:36.800]  life and have a right to self-defense that's liberal real feminism is a woman being able
[16:36.800 --> 16:42.480]  to be armed and protecting herself under the state run feminism it's complete incredibly weak
[16:42.480 --> 16:48.720]  chip on the shoulder women whose husband is the state now i'm going to go over these numbers
[16:48.720 --> 16:56.080]  i'm going to talk about this we have the picture of this individual uh now the first as supposed
[16:56.080 --> 17:02.160]  image of him and we'll put that up on screen from his id they're calling him a frenchman
[17:02.720 --> 17:09.760]  who's from tunisia and he's a madman on a rampage with a 18 wheeler
[17:09.760 --> 17:18.560]  no he is an islamist so here i'll just go to drugs report right here
[17:20.160 --> 17:25.440]  and i'll go right here where it says first photos of the individual and we'll just click
[17:26.000 --> 17:33.760]  click on that and everybody can then see what the fellow looks like but continuing here ladies and
[17:33.760 --> 17:45.280]  gentlemen we have the media again trying to spin all of this
[17:48.560 --> 17:57.920]  and behave like it's not another islamic attack but the big issue here is for everyone to understand
[17:57.920 --> 18:02.320]  there is a method to this madness they intend to let these people attack they intend to condition
[18:02.320 --> 18:07.520]  us to allow them to attack they intend to encourage more attacks they intend to bring in
[18:07.520 --> 18:13.280]  larger numbers and then make you conform and go to islamic sensitivity training at all high
[18:13.280 --> 18:20.320]  schools and all colleges already being put in place right now at quote muslim camps to learn
[18:20.320 --> 18:28.560]  that your speech can incite them and you must submit to their strictures and that's what the
[18:28.560 --> 18:34.640]  london mayor is doing he says i'm not going to be an uncle tom i'm going to be proud of my islamic
[18:34.640 --> 18:40.160]  background and we're going to enforce it and you're not going to have women on the buses or city on
[18:40.160 --> 18:51.520]  buildings in bathing suits say sharia law and then oh he wants more money for security measures
[18:51.520 --> 19:00.800]  to shut down everybody else's free speech but let people run around with ices flags on the streets
[19:00.800 --> 19:06.080]  in london but if i or paul watson or others go out and even try to videotape or talk to people the
[19:06.080 --> 19:13.120]  cops run over and act like we are the antichrist so this is their plan and they are planning to
[19:13.120 --> 19:19.120]  let these attacks intensify and get worse and worse and worse and you see the mainstream media
[19:19.120 --> 19:31.280]  and you see the corporate governance systems you see all of these different forces working together
[19:31.280 --> 19:40.320]  in unison working together as one unified system of total war to not even tell you that it's an
[19:40.320 --> 19:47.120]  islamic attack or an islamic invasion and they won't even tell you what the true numbers are
[19:47.120 --> 19:55.920]  are they won't even let you know how many people have been brought in and when they attack they
[19:55.920 --> 20:03.120]  say us citizens did it even when the woman in san Bernardino wasn't and for two days they ordered
[20:03.120 --> 20:08.240]  the fbi to say it wasn't islamic it wasn't a terror attack it was workplace violence and they have
[20:08.240 --> 20:14.880]  facebook and they have google and they have twitter all censoring people that even mildly report on it
[20:14.880 --> 20:21.360]  and now we have a video coming up for tv viewers radio listeners i'll describe it we're not even on
[20:21.360 --> 20:30.160]  facebook able to put in the word islamic in the keywords under our reports or in the headlines
[20:32.800 --> 20:37.600]  the videos up on info wars dot com facebook caught censoring words islamic terror during
[20:37.600 --> 20:46.800]  this attack world's largest social media site assistant controlling the narrative we need
[20:46.800 --> 20:51.040]  to write a bigger article about this and actually have screenshots for folks we have the video
[20:51.040 --> 20:58.960]  but screenshots people understand we have video facebook caught on video censoring words islamic
[20:58.960 --> 21:06.640]  care working to allow the invasion to intensify they are accelerating the islamists being brought
[21:06.640 --> 21:13.600]  in they are bringing in people from suny held radical areas that failed in their invasion so far
[21:14.160 --> 21:19.840]  partially of syria they're now being brought in through turkey they're then being flown in by
[21:19.840 --> 21:25.280]  the state department and by the pentagon to bases everywhere they are now you go to a park in austin
[21:25.280 --> 21:33.040]  you go to a doctor's office you go to a it is all the sudden women in burkus all over the place
[21:33.040 --> 21:43.280]  the numbers must be gigantic my high school last year got 200 and what is it 30 plus people
[21:43.280 --> 21:47.200]  and then we call the other high schools they all have similar numbers the elementary schools wouldn't
[21:47.200 --> 21:53.120]  give us the no they they claim 100 have come to austin total these are hundreds and hundreds and
[21:53.120 --> 22:01.440]  hundreds of children per school then you've got the open latin america border and the chinese
[22:01.440 --> 22:10.560]  flowing in and they're all being put directly on the democratic party mammary gland they're
[22:10.560 --> 22:16.160]  being inducted in as the army of the socialist and the big mega corporation the control to bring
[22:16.160 --> 22:23.120]  down the nation this is so incredible and then the news won't let you see the children being
[22:23.120 --> 22:29.040]  run over and won't even let you see their dead little bodies but you better believe when a cop
[22:29.040 --> 22:34.400]  does something wrong or makes a mistake you're going to see it everywhere because they want the
[22:34.400 --> 22:39.440]  war to be on the local government that they know the globalists don't completely control
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.440]  doesn't mean local government's perfect god no but it's our local government
[22:47.200 --> 22:51.120]  police arrest bastille day killers wipe his romantic footage shows moment
[22:51.120 --> 22:57.040]  mohammed that's his name was shot dead in the truck he used to drive through crowds killing
[22:57.040 --> 23:04.720]  84 people including 10 children warning graphic content but everybody needs to go look at this
[23:04.720 --> 23:08.880]  and look at it real good and understand it's being seen in some of the european press they
[23:08.880 --> 23:14.640]  are blocking it out here of course the first thing we said last night during two hours of
[23:14.640 --> 23:22.560]  live coverage was are we gonna have a five-day waiting period on trucks are we gonna have maybe
[23:22.560 --> 23:26.160]  safety locks on trucks maybe the answer is they have to all be computer robot driven
[23:26.160 --> 23:29.680]  oh but then somebody will hack that because you can't trust humans to drive because hey
[23:29.680 --> 23:36.160]  the truck did it we need truck control incorporated maybe we should sue the truck
[23:36.160 --> 23:40.240]  manufacturers like you sue gun manufacturers and you know what find out the maker of the truck
[23:41.680 --> 23:46.640]  that'd be like suing bowing because uh you know one of their aircraft was used on 9 11
[23:48.080 --> 23:54.800]  you say alex this is satire this is ridiculous yeah it's ridiculous to sue bush master because
[23:54.800 --> 24:03.600]  the supposed shooter uh in newtown got one illegally from someone else who got it legally
[24:03.600 --> 24:08.320]  and went and reportedly shot people i don't know what happened i just know anderson cooper's on
[24:08.320 --> 24:12.000]  green screen saying he's there and they're walking in circles in and out of the building with a
[24:12.000 --> 24:22.720]  chopper over it and i know an fbi agent current fbi agent who thinks it's all bull and then rob
[24:22.720 --> 24:37.200]  dues uncle rob dues uncle former navy seal fbi current agent we were up there to cover new town
[24:37.200 --> 24:43.120]  and guess who was there city council why his uncle and his uncle said this thing's the craziest thing
[24:43.120 --> 24:51.200]  i've ever seen i don't believe any of it but i can't talk to you about it he was there for the fbi
[24:51.200 --> 24:57.600]  looking at it understand folks i don't know what went on there they only oh you say no children died
[24:57.600 --> 25:02.480]  you say no all i know is i know a three-dollar bill when i see one and it didn't real i don't know
[25:02.480 --> 25:07.040]  what happened but i know something really stinks kind of like you on your house and you've been
[25:07.040 --> 25:11.280]  out of town for a week and it stinks horribly and you go i don't know what dead animal you know is up
[25:11.280 --> 25:15.680]  there in the attic but boy i'm gonna go up there with a bag and i and i and a shovel and i'm gonna
[25:15.680 --> 25:20.560]  oh yeah it's a dead possum you know i don't know what's up there but it stinks to i have it
[25:24.160 --> 25:28.480]  so we know two fbi agents that that that that one of them i just named that say
[25:29.200 --> 25:37.680]  it's the funniest thing they've ever seen and so many others but i'm digressing this is real
[25:37.680 --> 25:45.440]  this happened because it is a false flag though in that the globalist are bringing them in letting
[25:45.440 --> 25:49.600]  them get weapons letting them attack and then blaming all of our rights saying we've got to
[25:49.600 --> 25:54.400]  give our liberties up and and we've got to be nicer to the immigrants it's our fault that they're
[25:54.400 --> 26:03.280]  killing us how do you pronounce this guy's name 31 year old mohammed la joy edge boo holy
[26:03.280 --> 26:13.520]  hell and this guy's from tunisia north africa and he comes in and he's sitting there in france
[26:17.040 --> 26:24.320]  in the lap of luxury totally pissed off on the national holiday the fourth of july of france
[26:24.320 --> 26:33.200]  bastille day so the coward the filth goes out and targets a nighttime picnic with the street closed
[26:33.200 --> 26:40.320]  with kids in their pajamas out watching fireworks and he runs over hundreds of people
[26:41.040 --> 26:50.160]  killing 83 what a man what a what a what a great guy what a what a what a fantastic person
[26:50.160 --> 26:53.360]  you imagine if there was footage and certainly our troops have done things that are wrong and
[26:53.360 --> 26:58.160]  the droning and all the things that obama does are wrong that's okay because he's liberal you
[26:58.160 --> 27:05.840]  imagine if say a special forces soldier active duty ran over over 150 people killing 83 of them
[27:05.840 --> 27:13.520]  including children and then no one in our military our government said they were a killer or scumbag
[27:13.520 --> 27:19.120]  or psych psychotic no of course they would but where's where's the islamic groups apologizing
[27:19.120 --> 27:24.800]  they don't have to and they're not going to because the media will not say islamic because
[27:24.800 --> 27:31.520]  this media is literally i overuse that word because it's the only word when i say literally
[27:31.520 --> 27:37.840]  they are literally running a program to flood us to cover it up to work with the enemy because
[27:37.840 --> 27:44.160]  they're the enemy and to merge with their foot soldiers their national security force all over
[27:44.160 --> 27:49.840]  europe all over the uk they are putting islamicists in charge as the police chiefs as the mayors and
[27:49.840 --> 27:56.000]  they are taking people's kids with cps i've had members of parliament on who are liberals
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.040]  saying it's true we hire mainly eastern europeans that come from communist countries and muslims
[28:01.040 --> 28:05.440]  and they don't even speak english and they're taking everybody's kids for no reason and someone
[28:05.440 --> 28:11.120]  just shows up came and speaking which is this block and just drags you off that's who the socials
[28:11.120 --> 28:17.440]  and the government want is a kept group that they control that they can use as a weapon anytime they
[28:17.440 --> 28:24.960]  want now when we come back don't need to play the imam saying we're invading europe we're going to
[28:24.960 --> 28:29.440]  get your women i mean the main imam of jerusalem don't need to play all the moderate muslim leaders
[28:29.440 --> 28:33.920]  in the u.s saying we're going to kill the homosexuals as a blessing to them we're going to murder you
[28:33.920 --> 28:40.080]  you know the guy at his mosque in in in florida and and the media says oh you're allowed to do that
[28:40.080 --> 28:47.200]  oh really telling your your flock go out and kill people and now they have a new
[28:47.760 --> 28:59.200]  pure research pull out in france 18 to 29 support suicide bombing 18 to 29
[29:01.120 --> 29:04.080]  in that demographic 35 in france
[29:04.080 --> 29:15.280]  oh my gosh i'm reading that one that's worse than i said all muslims pulled at all ages of 35
[29:15.280 --> 29:22.080]  percent 18 to 29 is worse it's 42 percent in france excuse me 42 percent of military age
[29:22.080 --> 29:29.040]  males in france 42 percent want to kill you when they're asked but they're very proud of it that's
[29:29.040 --> 29:34.480]  why they want to apologize for these bombings they're very proud of it spain 29 percent are proud
[29:34.480 --> 29:38.000]  to kill you and your family and run over your kids and i'm sure the average liberal probably
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.440]  started lining their kids up like bowling pins we knew sport where liberals bring their kids out
[29:41.440 --> 29:45.280]  muslims run over them i'm not kidding i think if you actually they told liberals to take their
[29:45.280 --> 29:49.520]  kids out the middle street and have a muslim run over them they put their kids head under the tire
[29:49.520 --> 29:55.760]  and say we're on the march kill my kid i'm telling you i'm telling alex jones and the gcn radio
[29:55.760 --> 30:04.480]  psychotic deep leftist media outlets reacted to the devastating attack in nice not by blaming
[30:04.480 --> 30:10.240]  islam or even terrorists but by suggesting that an inanimate object the truck was responsible
[30:10.240 --> 30:14.880]  for the carnage instead of pointing our fingers at islamis cnn cbc in the new york times all
[30:14.880 --> 30:20.240]  published headlines that served to hide the true nature of the attack cbc reported children feared
[30:20.240 --> 30:25.680]  killed in nice his truck attacks family events presumably the truck was somehow able to manifest
[30:25.680 --> 30:32.000]  artificial intelligence and plow itself through dozens of victims way to go mainstream media
[30:32.000 --> 30:37.360]  ding ding ding not to be all done seen and reported truck rams crowd 84 dead and east again
[30:37.360 --> 30:44.480]  providing a convenient way to avoid any mention of the ideology that inspired the driver did it rhyme
[30:44.480 --> 30:50.160]  with a loha snack bar the new york times went with truck attack on french crowd scores died
[30:50.160 --> 30:54.720]  again painting the blame on the vehicle rather than the islamists inside it you can find more
[30:54.720 --> 31:02.640]  reports like this at info wars dot com not a group you develop living defense for us it took you
[31:02.640 --> 31:07.680]  over a year to do it why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem

[33:08.080 --> 33:16.080]  it's alex johnson so i want to be clear i have made five films concerning what really happened
[33:16.080 --> 33:22.640]  on 9 11 it has now been declassified it has now been leaked that everything i put in those films
[33:22.640 --> 33:28.160]  has now been proven to be accurate and the reason it's accurate is almost everything was already in
[33:28.160 --> 33:32.960]  the congressional report that was out in the first year we had all the whistleblowers on
[33:32.960 --> 33:38.400]  on we know what happened to a great external 9 11 and criminal elements of our government
[33:38.400 --> 33:45.200]  bare minimum stood down so saudi arabia could run the attacks now you expand out from there
[33:46.000 --> 33:52.000]  their operas were probably decoys there were other aircraft it gets crazy there were there were
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.040]  flight 93 was shot down we even know who did that the air national guard we even have the
[33:57.040 --> 34:03.280]  recordings of the two aim nines put into the aircraft this is a serious situation and it was
[34:03.280 --> 34:09.280]  meant to start a clash of civilizations between the west and islam and give the united states
[34:09.920 --> 34:14.640]  the pretext to be able to basically take over the middle east control the grand chessboard as
[34:14.640 --> 34:20.080]  brazinski writes because if you control the middle east you control africa below it you control all
[34:20.080 --> 34:26.480]  of asia to the east russia to the north eastern europe and europe to the west and that is the
[34:26.480 --> 34:32.320]  geopolitical strategy and stratagem that has been adopted as the globalist nato program
[34:32.960 --> 34:38.720]  and russia talks a lot about this i was against that because it was immoral
[34:41.280 --> 34:46.160]  okay and because we were targeting muslim countries that were not our enemies
[34:47.920 --> 34:53.760]  and by that we were going after moderates like sdam is saying and qaddafi and then later our
[34:53.760 --> 34:59.920]  allies in egypt and and really doing some bad stuff i mean sdam was put in there by the cia to
[34:59.920 --> 35:06.480]  kick the islamist's butt in an earlier program under eisenhower but that's a story for another day
[35:06.480 --> 35:12.640]  he was totally set up i mean i'll say a complaint uh compared to al qaeda the guy
[35:13.280 --> 35:17.920]  deserves a congressional medal of honor or something all the stuff sdam did killing communist and
[35:17.920 --> 35:22.400]  trying to take out people and and finally overthrowing the bathast and then taking it over for the
[35:22.400 --> 35:26.720]  united states and actually having a policy of stabilizing and building up iraq and then our
[35:26.720 --> 35:33.040]  us policy that was very moral changed in the 1980s when herbert walker bush started right on the
[35:33.040 --> 35:38.080]  show and again sdam was a thug he did a lot of bad things i'm saying compared to al qaeda who was
[35:38.080 --> 35:44.560]  his arch enemy that's that's why trump came out and said sdam hussein sure was good at killing
[35:44.560 --> 35:49.840]  terrorist compared to our president and they said oh you love sdam he goes well no he was a bad guy
[35:49.840 --> 35:54.560]  but all i'm saying he's just good at killing terrorist trump knows that he was a cia officer
[35:54.560 --> 35:59.920]  trump knows he was set up okay i mean sdam hussein was totally set up ladies and gentlemen told
[35:59.920 --> 36:05.760]  to invade co eight okay i'm going off on a jag he had rock and roll on the radio and playboys
[36:05.760 --> 36:11.280]  sold in shops and i'm not saying that's even good but that's why the islamists hated his
[36:11.280 --> 36:18.320]  guts so much he couldn't stand them he couldn't stand them he was trained in the west he was
[36:18.320 --> 36:24.880]  sent in there to westernize the middle east but that policy ended by the 70s late 70s and they
[36:24.880 --> 36:29.600]  decided to go with the jihadis and the saudi arabians and the state department started sending
[36:29.600 --> 36:34.960]  textbooks into the madrasas radicalizing them billions have been spent a year by the west
[36:36.080 --> 36:42.160]  to radicalize what is in islam and to make the most radical forms the dominant form so saudi
[36:42.160 --> 36:49.920]  arabia could take over and that's the new plan and that's what we're under right now and so i was
[36:49.920 --> 36:56.000]  against going in there because i smelled a rat i mean i knew it was a quasi false flag i knew that
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.200]  saudi arabia was involved but what was their payoff what you see now the whole middle east
[37:01.200 --> 37:07.360]  the whole region that's why mccain's involved the neocons obama's running a neocon strategy this is
[37:07.360 --> 37:13.280]  the same stuff we've seen before and who are the neocons you want to talk about immoral and evil
[37:13.280 --> 37:26.640]  and mackey of ellian they are the trotskyites the founder of the neocons was the adjunct of
[37:27.520 --> 37:33.520]  trotsky killed in nexico city and then they merged with astralian school
[37:33.520 --> 37:42.640]  of economics at chicago business school who was a nazi and they went right wing and i mean you talk
[37:42.640 --> 37:51.280]  about whacked out man you talk about whacked out uh they say you're any semitic if you talk about
[37:51.280 --> 37:59.280]  how a lot of the neocons were jewish these people i mean you can have a serial killer you know
[37:59.280 --> 38:03.920]  jeffrey dommer what last name is that and say the whoever those are you know somebody has a
[38:03.920 --> 38:08.880]  name schmeth you can say english people are evil no they weren't jews some of them were
[38:08.880 --> 38:13.680]  happened to be jews but the point was they were communists they were nazis they were whatever
[38:13.680 --> 38:20.800]  gets them power if it means being republicans they're for that and they are allied with saudi
[38:20.800 --> 38:29.120]  arabia who is absolutely totally and completely evil just like the globalist who are a bunch of
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.920]  different groups are allied with communist china there is no race component to this at the bottom
[38:33.920 --> 38:40.240]  of the rabbit hole it is just raw power raw control a race to merge with machines and
[38:40.240 --> 38:44.480]  become gods to quote ray Kurzweil that's what's going on here now i want to drill into what's
[38:44.480 --> 38:50.160]  happened i want to tell you about some of the guests that are coming up today former navy seal

[39:06.800 --> 39:14.000]  out of the 83 dead and the hundreds wounded 50 plus critical still others dying every few hours
[39:14.000 --> 39:21.360]  is the cold blooded evil in fact we you guys a little while queue up that the new snake video
[39:21.360 --> 39:26.400]  that we updated we should probably update it again and i'm going to go over this list of
[39:26.400 --> 39:33.120]  islamic terror in 2016 a shorter list is linked on drudge report dot com from info wars dot com
[39:33.120 --> 39:38.800]  i think i'm going to update the list because there's a full list that we also have on the site
[39:38.800 --> 39:43.520]  that shows the thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and
[39:43.520 --> 39:52.000]  thousands and thousands dead just this year from islamic terror you think 200 and something is bad
[39:55.520 --> 40:01.280]  in france in the last year wait till you've got a concentration of say 80 percent muslims
[40:01.280 --> 40:05.120]  or a hundred percent because when they had a hundred percent they all start killing each other
[40:05.120 --> 40:12.160]  because that's what they do when it's this virulent strain of islamic garbage
[40:14.640 --> 40:19.520]  and you can say well it's radical or oh is it orthodox whatever the dominant form of islam
[40:19.520 --> 40:23.520]  funded by saudi arabia backed by our government and the traders in our media
[40:26.320 --> 40:29.520]  that won't even tell you it's islamic
[40:29.520 --> 40:36.160]  you think about that our government is 110 percent illegitimate
[40:37.520 --> 40:42.080]  you've got the leftist the obama people the neocons and others
[40:43.440 --> 40:48.400]  i just a consortium of criminals that have been bought off basically by saudi arabian money
[40:48.400 --> 40:54.160]  and have made a deal with saudi arabia and a deal with islam that will Islamify the world
[40:54.160 --> 40:59.600]  basically completely within 30 to 50 years most estimates show and the globalists don't care
[40:59.600 --> 41:02.320]  they're intending to actually merge with this thing
[41:08.560 --> 41:12.000]  it's like take me back to the lord of the rings when you got gandalf up there with sauramon
[41:12.880 --> 41:19.680]  and he says we must join with sauron and he says are you insane he can't join with sauron
[41:19.680 --> 41:25.040]  and he's like he's already moving in the east and into the west you have to queue that up later
[41:25.040 --> 41:29.280]  i mean you sit there and watch that this isn't some allegory about jr tolkin
[41:31.520 --> 41:35.600]  who by the way was in world war one and a lot of it is an allegory of world war one but coming
[41:35.600 --> 41:43.360]  wars he saw with islam it's a christian allegory oh yes that's recently his writings they've held
[41:43.360 --> 41:47.600]  back the left has been in the family it's been coming out and i've had some of the top tolkin
[41:47.600 --> 41:54.560]  experts on tolkin was an original info warrior and all those different allegories and you're
[41:54.560 --> 42:02.960]  seeing it now you're absolutely getting front row seats to it ladies and gentlemen and the way
[42:02.960 --> 42:11.360]  this this islam is basically a satanic system
[42:11.360 --> 42:18.880]  and it claims it's bringing all this tyranny to the normal eyes so you submit or at peace but
[42:18.880 --> 42:24.160]  they're never at peace it's a bunch of bullies controlling and dominating society behind wall
[42:24.160 --> 42:30.960]  cities having homosexual orgies but then if they catch an average person doing it they execute you
[42:30.960 --> 42:42.160]  it is just a 1984 world merged with a religion it's a political ideology of dominance and control
[42:42.160 --> 42:47.280]  a thug driven system that has a religion to deliver it its system around the planet
[42:48.960 --> 42:53.440]  and zuckerberg remember a few months ago was on a hot mic with merkel he played it many times and
[42:53.440 --> 42:57.520]  he said don't worry i'ma start censoring you know we've got a way to do this then he hired former
[42:57.520 --> 43:02.400]  members of the stasi to track and report people that mildly criticize open borders and then the
[43:02.400 --> 43:08.320]  police come and arrest you just two years ago it started out where they'd censor you on facebook
[43:08.320 --> 43:15.440]  in germany in sweden or france now they're arresting you well it's already here now now we can't
[43:16.960 --> 43:22.480]  put in to the key words islamic terror or islamic jihad or a whole bunch of other words facebook
[43:22.480 --> 43:29.360]  won't let you they are burning books it's beyond burning books they're burning words their memory
[43:29.360 --> 43:38.160]  holding i mean this is this beyond 1984 it all starts reasonable like you want to send somebody
[43:38.160 --> 43:43.840]  a cuss word on your phone i'm not a big cusser but sometimes i send a text message to somebody
[43:43.840 --> 43:54.640]  saying what that is this and it says what the duck and it won't let you type what you want
[43:56.320 --> 44:01.440]  you see that's the nanny state you're like oh that's a cuss word you shouldn't be doing that
[44:02.320 --> 44:09.280]  if you buy a so-called mini computer and you pay $500 for it you should be able to do whatever you
[44:09.280 --> 44:14.800]  want with that phone in a literary way it's yours but see it's not yours it's not yours it's loaded
[44:14.800 --> 44:20.800]  up with software that's going to train you that it controls your life not you and people like oh
[44:20.800 --> 44:25.280]  well that's just cuss words well now you can't write it or publish it on the internet you see
[44:25.280 --> 44:32.720]  the words aren't even allowed i was told a decade ago before shazam even existed by radio execs but
[44:32.720 --> 44:37.200]  in the future they're going to have systems where they can go out with bots and in a matter of hours
[44:37.200 --> 44:42.880]  they can code key your voice and have your voice banned from the internet in a matter of hours
[44:44.320 --> 44:51.920]  erased unreadable by devices untransmitable you think you've seen book burning by the nazis
[44:52.480 --> 44:57.840]  you think you've seen corruption ladies and gentlemen you ain't seen nothing yet with these
[44:57.840 --> 45:03.520]  powers they're bringing in and city-wide killing cell phone video cameras and and see all of this
[45:03.520 --> 45:09.600]  this is this is so draconian and it will enslave all of us whether you're a black man a white man
[45:09.600 --> 45:14.160]  hispanic a woman an old person whether whether you're a muslim whether you're a christian whether
[45:14.160 --> 45:23.680]  you're an agnostic this tyranny that's coming in is history ending that's what the globalists call it
[45:23.680 --> 45:28.320]  the final revolution and the end of history go read it where everything's gonna be micromanaged

[45:55.520 --> 46:00.560]  allow a few humans here and there uh but they'll be like bugs i'm giving you real quotes here
[46:00.560 --> 46:04.480]  they'll be like insects we might accidentally step on you that's one of their favorite quotes
[46:04.480 --> 46:09.760]  Kurzweil's and others we might let you live but doesn't mean we might not just step on you

[55:36.400 --> 55:41.600]  just like six years ago to be sued because we talked about their patents to have chips in the pills

[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:40.720]  evil slave factories in the world but they're liberal so it's okay comes from the folks its symbol
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:48.480]  is this image of the fall of humanity an apple with the bite out of it and the other companies

[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:28.160]  supper you're in the game now and then for folks that still get their news from cnn or the new
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.760]  york times in full wars dot com i cannot get over the fact that this is not bigger news i cannot
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.480]  get over the fact that we broke last night to millions of people that watch total
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:45.120]  hundreds of thousands watching on our streams watching on television feeds
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:50.400]  uh hundreds of thousands watched on youtube hundreds of thousands listen to the streams
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.480]  where we just sat there and showed everyone facebook and live time won't let you say islamic
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:03:02.720]  terror and then changes what you write to muslims are not terrorist those are just burned books
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:09.120]  those just destroy language it puts words in your mouth it controls you it engineers you
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:15.840]  but that's okay because mark zuckerberg's a liberal and he lives while you sleep while you
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:23.840]  have the goggles on the virtual reality that he controls he walks bipedal like a man like a god
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:30.960]  amongst subways slaves entering their matrix pods and then you see where this technocracy is going
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:35.760]  just like matt drudge got told back in 2015 that 2016 was when they were going to roll out the
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.600]  real censorship and facebook brags we can deliver an election to whoever we want
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.400]  because well just like the voting machines change the vote for who you vote for just like hillary
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:52.080]  takes bernie's votes you're gonna put up with it bernie supporters like me having their vote taken
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:58.800]  yeah they like hillary yeah yeah they like zuckerberg zuckerberg says yeah our users trust us
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:06.160]  they're dumb efforts or if it was a smartphone that censors you'd be they're dumb duckers
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:14.160]  because you can't say dumb efforts see he's mark zuckerberg he rules the biggest nation in the
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:21.360]  world facebook with several billion users and even cnbc says he's a dictator but there's not
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:26.800]  going to be any news about him controlling language not going to be any news about the cia already
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:32.800]  operating with thousands of fake reporters that are computers yeah an actual agent might have
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:42.240]  pangs of guilt but not the ai computer that's got a nice name we're gonna talk to our navy seal
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.680]  friend who warned of this tet two offensive coming in several years ago mr bracken straight ahead
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:55.920]  paul watson and more the latest on the niece islamic terror attack the orthodox authorized islamic
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:02.720]  supported jihad that our government won't tell us leftist media outlets reacted to the devastating
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:07.920]  attack in the east not by blaming islam or even terrorists but by suggesting that an inanimate
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:13.760]  object the truck was responsible for the carnage instead of pointing our fingers at islamis cnn cbc
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.320]  in the new york times all published headlines that served to hide the true nature of the attack
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:24.000]  cbc reported children feared killed in the east as truck attacks family events presumably the truck
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.240]  was somehow able to manifest artificial intelligence and plow itself through dozens of victims way
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:36.560]  to go mainstream media ding ding ding not to be all done cnn reported truck rams crowd 84 dead
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:42.960]  niece again providing a convenient way to avoid any mention of the ideology that inspired the
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:49.120]  driver did it rhyme with aloha snack bar the new york times went with truck attack on french crowd
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:54.400]  scores died again painting the blame on the vehicle rather than the islamist inside it you can find

[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.760]  recommended from smart folks we talk to that are patriots they say well we can't tell you anything
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.360]  just go get matt bracken on he'll tell you what they're really planning i'm going to say this
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:51.040]  where we go to matt i'm going to ask him his question is there any doubt that this is a coordinated
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:57.760]  globalist program allied with islam and saudi arabia to bring down the left and to merge with the
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:03.120]  left islam with the left and actually persecute everyone that doesn't submit saying it's our fault
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.120]  the muslims are attacking germany's already doing it sweden's already doing it france is already
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:13.120]  arresting people facebook's already censoring uh they're already censoring uh newspaper people
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:18.000]  are going along with it and will not use the words i mean this is crazy that we're under attack
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.720]  and we've got a globalist run information war where we can't even say who is attacking us
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:30.160]  and you've got every weirdo leftist group they have major hollywood movies out attacking me by name
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:36.640]  saying i'm an islamophobe and need to be locked up i mean the the the democratic party platform
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:43.200]  says arrest climate change deniers i mean it is this really their attack plan because you
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:48.400]  predicted it it's here the attacks are bigger they're coming closer together matt bracken
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:56.480]  hi alex it's a it's a terrible day but um you keep wondering at what point will there be a turning
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:05.680]  point um today i i saw president holland of france and his uh his remarks in nith never mentioned
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.640]  islam just terrorism he's the one that brought him in he's the one that brought him in he's
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:16.720]  allied with him he's their general in germany they're arresting people that post anything about the
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:23.840]  invasion on social media they're not in arresting the islamists they're arresting the people who
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:29.600]  warn about the islamists and in our country from our president to our our department of
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:37.440]  homeland security their traders at this point in 2016 you have to say if you're still pretending
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:44.000]  that this is nothing to do with islam then you are either secretly already a muslim or you've
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.920]  already made your separate piece as a dimmy that's under the sharia people have to understand when
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:57.680]  newt was talking about sharia sharia is not just something for muslims to abide when sharia law comes
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:03.280]  everybody has to abide it now if you're a christian or a jew you don't have to become a muslim you can
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:12.240]  become a dimmy dhi mmi that's a category like a caste meaning you have to be submitted you have to
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.520]  be humiliated as an official second or third class citizen and that's if you're in the few
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.560]  countries where they decide to use you as slaves in most countries they go ahead and just run you
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:28.240]  out or kill you right or take your women as sex slaves now uh two weeks ago jay johnson was on
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:36.560]  in a senate hearing uh ted cruz and others won the senate intelligence committee the week earlier
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:42.080]  they had had phil haney and some other patriots on phil haney wrote see something say nothing
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.800]  about how he was kicked out of the department of homeland security had him on and right and all of
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:54.320]  his all of the words that describe islamic terrorism islam jihad umma they're not allowed to use it in
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:00.240]  investigations what do you make of us now no one on facebook can even in their keyword add that to
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:06.400]  their tags yeah and it's it's a shame that even the fbi as we've seen with comey taking a dive
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:12.480]  obviously the word got to him here's let's talk big picture uh big picture what's the master plan
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.720]  in all this i mean what are the socialists the globalist thinking hitting us with probably a million
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:21.600]  refugees here five million in europe they're hiding the numbers we know that what's the big plan the
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:28.480]  socialists think that they can ride the tiger of islam uh but in the end they'll convert because
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:36.640]  secular atheists never have a problem converting like carlos the jackal did to islam because to a
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:43.680]  secular atheist saying 10 or 12 words about mohammed and islam it's just you know an incantation
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.880]  as long as they can kill christians i mean that's the real target i mean i mean they want to mount
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:52.880]  our head on the wall so so they like it well of course they like it now in the end the islamists
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:58.480]  will win because they're willing to bat everybody in sight including atheists that don't convert
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:04.080]  so the atheists will convert the left will just like carlos the jackal the left will just switch
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:09.040]  gears listen we go out to rallies and see women saying they're feminist just worshiping islam
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.960]  and attacking us that we don't criticize it and they're like crazy they go i love islam you
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:18.560]  i'm a feminist you're like that's an oxymoron lady yeah they're brainwashed it's we make fun
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:23.360]  of north koreans running out and you know going and swooning over their dear leader
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:30.080]  but these women in europe are just as crazy as the north koreans you know they are practically
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:35.600]  like the uh the children in the pied piper of hamlet and story where they will willingly drown
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:42.720]  themselves because it's their their brainwashing is that deep people have to understand and that's
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:49.520]  why it's so important your your tagline that there's a war on for your mind it's absolutely true and
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:56.320]  facebook is the leading fountain of this brainwashing so resisting facebook is critical i was i was
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:02.000]  suspended for a couple days from facebook for just posting a text only meme wondering when the
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:08.240]  moderate muslims were gonna you know have a rally against uh islamic terrorism that got me banned
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:13.520]  for a few days with you know threats of being thrown out forever i it's it's really upside
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:18.640]  down world i don't know where we go if um you know facebook won't let you post the truth and
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.240]  people say we'll just leave it no it's been giving all the attention it's the platform it's where the
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.800]  war is we're going to win and force them to censor us and force them out in the open like hillary
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:31.440]  censoring our aircraft banner hangs it's only going to make us resist more now matt bracken
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:35.600]  i want to hold you over when paul watchen joins us as well you talked about the frequency increasing
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.720]  when you were here a month ago you talked about the attacks getting bigger uh i mean i i've got to
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.440]  believe at some point this backfires where none of our media will say islamic terror other than a
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:50.480]  few people on fox news and again newt geinrich is a globalist but he's telling the truth here
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.440]  this is a war we are in a war and if someone says they want sharia law that means they're
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:59.440]  not going to comply with our law and they're going to try to force us under it like the
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:08.720]  mayor of london is now doing so let's play this clip of newt genrich western civilization is in a
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:16.160]  war we should frankly test every person from here who's who is of a muslim background and if they
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:22.880]  believe in sharia they should be deported sharia is incompatible with western civilization modern
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:28.480]  muslims who have given up sharia glad to have them as citizens let me stop there let me stop right
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:34.160]  there we need to be people call that a radical statement you can't go to an islamic country
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.160]  and not submit to them you go to saudi arabia and preach the gospel you'll be arrested and in
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:43.920]  prison so again they're not tolerant of our tolerance bs get the hell out that's not a radical
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:49.840]  statement we're very fortunate in this country because we do have a constitution unlike in
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:54.480]  britain for example they have no first amendment or second uh germany where they're arresting
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:19:00.000]  people for making posts truthful posts about islam but we have a constitution that all the
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.920]  military police and and government officials have to swear to uphold the constitution part of the
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:11.360]  constitution i forget where it is what article it is it is the supreme law of this country
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:18.080]  well sharia to a muslim article nine law of the world right sharia law is the law of the world
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:23.840]  and if you are a believing muslim you believe that no man made law which was what they consider the
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:30.800]  constitution no man made law can be above sharia law now sharia law holds that women are worth half
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:36.400]  of a man a woman who is raped can be stoned to death for adultery if she doesn't have four male
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:42.400]  witnesses conveniently testifying on her behalf you know gays can be thrown off of buildings this
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:48.560]  is all sharia law i'm now wish that the the mainstream media when they play that clip by newt
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:54.400]  they don't explain what sharia law is but at least a lot of the sheeple today at least they've heard
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.480]  of sharia law absolutely stay there matt braggen we're gonna ask the question though what's the

[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:34.800]  ladies and gentlemen you have to understand something i've been doing this 21 years i've
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:39.040]  been politically involved 25 years i've studied history i've interviewed the experts across the
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:45.200]  board i've tried to hold all this back but i i mean i'm actually getting storable food i'm
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:49.040]  actually getting medical supplies i'm actually getting firearms ready and i've always had some
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:54.320]  of that but i mean i'm like actually getting the solar panels you know on the roof actually you
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:01.520]  know turned on and working because i'm a busy guy i'm actually developing collapse plans now
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:05.440]  because i've studied history i've talked to the experts i'm looking at what's going on with our
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:11.440]  power plants getting shut down the cultural warfare the attack on the family the open borders the
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:16.480]  government ordering the border patrol to release people with tb by the thousands and it's just
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:22.320]  spreading everywhere and i'm like my god we are really under attack this is not negligence
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:27.920]  and i know we've had corruption and problems but i i used to get chills every few days thinking
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:35.600]  about this i get chills all the time now my physiology is like get ready to kick ass and
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:39.760]  believe me i'm not looking for trouble folks but you just see the acceleration of everything
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:46.320]  the you know the mass killings the killing of cops the leftist operations all of it it's like
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:50.800]  evil is being turned loose and and and matt bracken's riding shotgun with us into the next
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:56.000]  segment with paul watson former navy seal author researcher who's really predicted all of this but
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.600]  i gotta tell you it's not a good move for the western elite who had everything sewn up until
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:07.760]  you realize they have a desire to bring down the west because they want to control free will
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.760]  they want a technocracy and they think their technocracy is going to be able to control
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:15.920]  islam and they're going to double cross it that is what's happening matt bracken's right
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:23.200]  and i am i am really upset i mean i don't care who you are it's time to get out of your box it's
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:27.280]  time to get aggressive matt bracken what do we do to really get aggressive i'm trying as hard as
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:33.040]  i can you concur with me though that this this confirms our worst analysis i mean we this is
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:37.440]  worse than i thought this it seems like they're moving the timetable up yeah this is a takedown
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:43.840]  this is a destabilization it's going to accelerate it's going to go longer algorithmic um we just had
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:49.520]  a sidebar diversion over to nice france and that's terrible for europe and terrible for the world but
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:56.640]  i have to go back to dallas this is a progression obama and his gang have been stoking the racial
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:03.360]  the racial flames they got the action that they wanted in dallas the next step and what they really
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:10.400]  need is for a right winger to do a magazine dump into a blm mob on a freeway something like that
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:15.680]  i'm very concerned about the convention next week um obviously a lot of morons have just
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:20.880]  figured out that if they ran a truck they can cause mass casualty mayhem uh people that might not
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:26.960]  have thought about that before they all know now and the the problem that i see is that uh at some
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:33.840]  point somebody's going to unload a magazine right into a crowd now the guy in dallas um mica x
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:40.560]  johnson he at least was using a scope at aiming at police otherwise there would have been 30 other
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:46.880]  civilians shot but the next target which is just going to be a mob of blm people you won't need a
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:51.280]  scope all you'll need is a personal and a highway overpass and you'll just be aiming into a crowd
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:56.320]  of a thousand people so every round is going to hit one or two or three that's the next step on
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.600]  the progression that's the next thing that i see coming are you saying blm is going to hit a general
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:08.320]  crowd or globalist will hit blm to false flag and make them go crazy either either a false flag or
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:14.160]  an own goal or just some you know right winger who's off the deep end who's saying you know i'm
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:19.360]  going to uh now strike back for uh sure because this is mass mind control when the media promotes
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:23.840]  blm and obama says it's the cops fault it's going to make somebody on the other side unstable
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:28.800]  and and go do this and and they just know what a law of numbers they need they can't have any
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:35.280]  more left-wingers it doesn't help them when a blm guy like mica x johnson does it they need some
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:40.800]  cracker to do it uh they need to provoke some cracker into you know firing off a couple magazines
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:47.440]  into a blm crowd i see that as the next step but the the big goal is the elections if trump is
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:52.240]  leading or even close the left is going to pull out all the stuff by the way he really is now
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.680]  probably leading he's pulled ahead of hillary from our internal polling and experts they now
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.240]  admit that and that's why they're going into high gear i agree if there's a security climate
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:05.600]  that is dangerous enough there might not be elections in november if there's a race war
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:11.280]  going on in october you know with uh any time a group of people crowds together they get sure
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:14.320]  what is it and we're gonna hold you over what does it signify then that he met with the leader of
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:21.040]  blm three days ago for three hours obama signifies that they're rolling on with the plan and i i
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:25.440]  don't expect a smooth transfer of power in january there might not even be elections in november
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:29.040]  yeah let's talk about that with yourself matt bracken and poll watches straight ahead i'm alex
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.520]  jones and folks we're not playing games i've got total skin in the game i'm up in cleveland on the
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:39.200]  street five days okay so i mean this is the battle for the republic and if we let these people
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:43.760]  intimidate us and stand down they're gonna dig you out of your house later you got to face them on
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:53.840]  the field now now is the info war 100 commitment we're on the march the empires on the run alex
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:30:03.280]  jones and the gcn radio network leftist media outlets reacted to the devastating attack in
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:08.640]  the east not by blaming islam or even terrorists but by suggesting that an inanimate object the
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:14.000]  truck was responsible for the carnage instead of pointing our fingers at islamis cnn cbc in the
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.520]  new york times all published headlines deserve to hide the true nature of the attack cbc reported
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:24.720]  children feared killed in these his truck attacks family events presumably the truck was somehow
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:30.800]  able to manifest artificial intelligence and plow itself through dozens of victims way to go
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:37.120]  mainstream media ding ding ding not to be all done cnn reported truck rams crowd 84 dead niece
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:43.920]  again providing a convenient way to avoid any mention of the ideology that inspired the driver
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:49.200]  did it rhyme with a loha snack bar the new york times went with truck attack on french crowd
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:54.160]  scores died again painting the blame on the vehicle rather than the islamis inside it you

[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:46.160]  package it just to put the bio pqq in it which is equivalent of 300 pounds of blueberries it's above

[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:08.640]  why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:14.320]  me the most i mean i try to make sure that i don't put toxins from food and water and beverages
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:20.800]  in my system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:27.040]  your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:31.760]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about all this
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:35.520]  episode there's so many things that are in it you have the neem in there you have the organic
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:41.360]  clove bud the organic wormwood i recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:44.800]  well i'm glad we've got some back in because i'm going back on it today it just came back in
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:49.120]  yesterday living defense info warslife.com and folks you can't lose it's full of stuff that's
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:55.040]  great for your body period and you support the broadcast info warslife.com thank you doctor group
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.480]  from the global healing center thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:14.720]  the threat is real it's being directed and organized by the devils group elderberg
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:30.960]  oldman sacks jp morgan george soros and the primates waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:39.200]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war hard to believe the globalists are really
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:44.880]  doing it i knew this stuff was on the drawing board man they are crazy so was hitler so was
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:50.320]  stalling i mean it's just you but i tell you they always overestimate their power they always
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:55.280]  think they're going to break the west will and in the end the globalists are going to fall this
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:01.440]  is going to be the final fall may take 20 years maybe might take a year but the best laid plans
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:08.400]  of mice and men often go astray they're not getting away with this and i feel sorry for muslims they
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:13.600]  are brainwashed cult members bullied by their own system tortured in their own countries
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:20.320]  and then so many of them come here and they're impact into their orthodoxy and you know and
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:25.920]  their kid goes out and kills somebody because they're following islam so i welcome islamic
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:33.040]  heretics that want to be free the problem is fundamentally the religion says a lot of people
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:40.720]  say that you're not violent when you are but never deny the martyrs so it's all very schizophrenic
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:45.040]  that's why they'll never say they're sorry what these islamists do and the controlled corporate
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:52.080]  weaponized media will never will never make them say it because they won't tell you it's islamic
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:58.640]  and they'll censor your website they'll censor your youtube the answer is double down and then
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:02.880]  when they censor you double down again and sue them if you have to i mean i've sued i've filed
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:07.600]  lawsuits before ever censorship let me tell you it got youtube's attention
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:15.520]  and hillary's trying to block our aircraft from the skies with hillary for president she's not
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.680]  going to stop you getting the t-shirts she's not going to stop us with trucks now in cleveland
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:25.440]  and in philadelphia i've doubled and tripled down now we're about to order in in philadelphia like
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:31.680]  50 trucks one day with hillary for president i mean i'm just all in and we'll putting 50 trucks
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:37.200]  out there for that day with huge billboards saying hillary for president will that bring her down
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:43.920]  no but that action of resistance that spirit will of defiance to tyranny never submitting
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:48.640]  never backing down never giving in and fighting hard because you think it's a hard battle now
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:52.880]  wait till they get more of their controls in folks the number one meme for a week was hillary
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:36:00.400]  for president it's shaking her up that's just one thing you did listeners and our big secret is
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:03.760]  we're going to teach other people how to fight back so that it doesn't matter what they do to me
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:09.840]  the signal the way to take them down the blueprint is already out there and i studied it from history
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:15.200]  i integrated it with modern information and the truth and it's unstoppable that's a good feeling
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:20.400]  the question is how bad's this war going to get till the globals give up i'll use the world war two
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:28.000]  analogy like it stalingrad or leningrad when the germans were already beat and collapsed hitler
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.880]  didn't give up it took them a couple years till they dug him out of his bunker we've already i
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:37.280]  believe historically defeated the the new world order with briggs and the rest of it they know
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:44.080]  that now and they're launching desperate battle the bulge type counter offenses that are going to
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.640]  fail but do we want to go through 20 years of fighting the new world order or do we want to
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:56.000]  have a mass awakening now and start the program of reversing this before i go any further i'm
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.440]  going to go to our guest um everybody knows what those of us that are on the tip of the spear are
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:06.640]  up against i'm no hero i'm not going to sit here and how these people overrun us have the globalist
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:12.560]  brainwash us have them to destroy our families shut our country and nations down i mean this is
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:16.240]  like watching my neighbor's house burn or my own house burn if i get out of the bed and try to get
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:21.360]  out of the house i'm not a hero it's self-preservation that's what i'm saying you couldn't get me to
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:24.640]  stop doing this you put a gun to my head i'm not going to stop i mean i mean it's just i'm fully

[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:34.160]  take is on all this but before we go any further again hillary hates hillary for president's shirts

[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.960]  then now we find a company they'll do it and then they do a first time exclusion zone for 30 miles
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:00.800]  out at the rnc and dnc it's because it is effective they're putting up defenses it's because they do
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:06.400]  know they are aware we've identified them the globalists are now out in the open this is the
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.600]  beginning of the end so they're going to launch everything they've got at us we'll talk to matt

[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:43.360]  the censorship part of the war on american people the part of the war on truth i mean this is
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:50.960]  coordinated this is military level brainwashing this is this is war level disinfo facebook will
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:55.760]  not let us put in the words islamic terror on our own videos i mean this we have it on video and
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:01.280]  tells us islam is not muslims are not terrorists that's what we're allowed to say i mean this is so
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:08.720]  unprecedented to see coordination with the big tech companies western governments facebook
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:13.040]  for years calls the german police when someone says we're under an invasion and they come and
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:19.680]  arrest you i mean i know we keep saying that this is facebook wants to do that here zuckerberg
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:25.840]  once you arrested he's an enemy of this country he's part of a takeover this is 21st century war
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:32.320]  folks it isn't the japanese bomb and pearl harbor now this is global government with soros and these
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:39.440]  other people coming after us with an army of jihadis i talked to paul that's not even before newt
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:45.360]  gendrick said this before i i said what is this paul he said this is war war on the west attempted
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:49.520]  take down he goes we're taking the gloves off and i said that's right i want the gloves off and i
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:54.640]  want brass knuckles on we're going all out paul watch and give us your take on the situation
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:41:00.720]  the 84 dead over 101 did 50 plus a critical condition haland who lower the drawbridge
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:08.160]  called the enemy in with the signals is now presiding over another death banquet uh what what
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:15.120]  a what a horrible demonic creature well i mean it is a war alex but the problem is many of our
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:21.280]  leaders have already completely capitulated and you can see that today from the reaction from
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:27.760]  manuel vals this is the french prime minister who said that france learned to quote live with
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:35.680]  terrorism he actually said the french people must now tolerate the mangled limbless corpses of innocent
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:41.120]  people of innocent children on the streets because that's the new reality they've got to get used to
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:47.040]  it and that's why frank people keep friends being attacked over and over again because they've surrendered
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:53.280]  because that's where they're going to institute the area even when you surrender they are other
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:59.200]  groups don't do this when you surrender to islam it gang rapes you even harder yeah and then look
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:05.760]  at these headlines ignore the hysteria europe can live with terror another one out the sympathy
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:11.280]  should be our only response to the east terror attack this is how the terrorists are winning
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:16.240]  this emboldens this is why they keep attacking france because now they think we've got our foot
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:22.000]  in the door this is really working they're trying to break our will paul uh the media is trying to
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.840]  normalize this they're running up the white flag that's the headline western media runs up white
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:34.880]  flag please continue look at this hours before the niece attack literally a few hours before in
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:42.640]  fact two hours before president alond quote what threatens us is the rise of populism that's a quote
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:50.000]  two hours before this attack the rise of populism these people are more afraid of losing political
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.440]  power of so-called right-wing populist parties getting in power than the fact that their country
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:03.440]  almost every month now is being bombarded again and again they're more afraid of being called
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:09.920]  islamophobic and it's the same goes for the left than people with whom they disagree getting a chance
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:14.560]  at power and you know i talked about this in a video which is just going up an info was about 30
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:22.000]  minutes ago you know the left you've capitulated you've lost you have no argument remaining now
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:28.080]  it's somebody else's turn to actually try and fix this massive mess that you've created but they
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:32.560]  know that they want to burn everything down because they can't compete with real liberalism and the
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:38.240]  renaissance the body snatcher always wants to kill what it's copying paul i think you underestimate
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:43.680]  their evil no i totally agree i'm i'm just talking to the few leftists who are still ignorant and
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:47.600]  as they don't matter i mean they all are trigly pops and can't even talk but sorry go ahead
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:55.120]  yeah they they have allied themselves with the islamist because again they share the same goals
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:01.360]  in this video again i post the screenshot out of isis's own manifesto where they say
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:06.640]  we're gonna go and recruit the left wing the quote anti zionist the pro-palestinian people
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:12.080]  we're gonna radicalize them we're gonna arm them because they roughly share the same beliefs
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:17.200]  they hate the west they want to bring it down people always say why don't the left ever criticize
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:23.840]  islam many of them are aligned with islam they've allied with islamists that's the danger here it's
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:30.640]  not just individual attacks it's the complete subversion of our society from a fifth column
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:36.240]  that's helping them do sure why do the jihadists always attack those that submit i mean their own
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:42.880]  hell pit countries uh i mean i guess it's like 1984 it's a boot stopping on the face forever they
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:48.560]  just all persecute their daughters their their husbands it's a constant torture murder execution
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:54.720]  death lying weird old men stomping around like rock up look i mean it's like what the hell
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:00.800]  is going on here and then look at this comment again from the prime minister val's who basically
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:05.760]  surrendered today and said you just got to get used to dead little children on the streets it's
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:11.680]  just the new norm he said that this is before the attack he said quote oh it's no legal basis for
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:18.320]  arresting the european jihadists or barring them from leaving or entering france he went on to say
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:25.280]  quote excuse me he said let jihadists in i'm whoa yeah yeah he went on to say quote the fighters in
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:31.360]  syria are not fighting things or fighting against the asad regime so they openly admitted that they
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.680]  were letting these people in and out of france because they were fighting asad who's actually
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:41.680]  destroying isis and al-qaeda he said that before the attack these people are fifth columnists these
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:46.960]  people are even more dangerous than isis because they hold the reins of power and again absolutely
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:53.600]  shocking comment well paul i'm completely blown away stay there i want to get matt bracken again
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:58.080]  former navy seal author anti-terrorism researcher who predicted this islamic tet two would be
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:05.040]  kicking off big time this year more and more frequent larger attacks in concert like a major war
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:08.720]  i just like the global swans to arab spring with this jihadist to take over the middle east
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:16.880]  matt this is clearly coordinated with high level state level international level coordination
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:22.960]  with the media to cover this up and carry this out uh this is this is amazing what do you expect
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:30.560]  to happen next first i want to say paul joseph watson your your videos are amazing my daughter and
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:36.800]  her generation are turned on to them i can't say enough about your videos i think there's the very
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:43.280]  top of the of the entire genre now something that i got i need to use two arabic words one is jizya
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:48.560]  and one is dimmy another concept in english is called the bride price when a trader comes over
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:54.720]  say back in the cold war era terms a russian trader came over the bride price were the secrets
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:58.960]  that he brought you know you didn't just show up and say i hate the kgb you had to burn some kgb
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:08.400]  people back in moscow that's the bride price um the holland and the and merkel their jizya their
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:17.520]  bride price for continuing in power under the new caliphate is to betray their own people to lie
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:22.320]  to their about their own people and to their own right so they've they've had the meetings where they
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:27.520]  say you've got to give us cover for our jihad we want to see you let us do this just like a gang
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:30.960]  member to be initiated has got to go kill an old lady for no reason this is literally a gang
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:37.680]  initiation well this is a gang initiation where the leaders of europe are lying to their own people
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:43.680]  and they know they're lying to their own people this is their bride price their jizya tax for
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:49.600]  becoming safe dimmies and keeping their power now some of them might just out and out say
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:55.600]  i converted long ago i'm a muslim fooled you or they might say as long as i keep my palace and
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:02.800]  my villa in my estate i don't really care but their bride price their jizya tax is to sell out
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:08.400]  their own people people need to understand this our leaders like j johnson at the senate
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:13.680]  intelligence committee two weeks ago he was asked about phil haney and this and they see
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:21.120]  say something see something say nothing he said he had no idea head cruise had a big chart behind
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:28.240]  him with all of the words in the uh 9 11 report that have been expunged year by year and j johnson
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:34.720]  just flicked his hand and said i have no idea what you're talking about so these guys the same
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:38.240]  way they denied world government as they built it now it's out in the other they deny the islamic
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:42.080]  invasion this is the mind control and call you conspiracy theorists they're actually not saying
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:47.120]  that if you say this was islamic that there's new headlines and we are conspiracy theorists we need
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:52.080]  to see them and call them traitors they agree with you now let's expand on this let's expand on this
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:57.120]  map bracket because what you said is absolutely at the heart of this you look at the london mayor
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:01.760]  all of this once they get in they activate and let you know yes we're conquering you yes we're
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:06.400]  taking you over because whatever you want to say about islam it at least wants to take over is
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:11.040]  dominant will do whatever and has a long term strategic plan the the globalist minions just
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:18.480]  want to sell out and are such total scum how do we counter that a bad ideology beats no ideology
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:26.960]  even an evil bad cult beats secular nothingness and nihilism uh you know the postmodern nihilistic
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:33.920]  uh uh all things are the same there's no there's no good there's no bad that means islam wins
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.080]  because don't we need a new crusade i mean the crusades got a dirty name but we were attacked
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:43.040]  for 400 years before we went in there and kicked their ass and i'm sorry if they want one and at
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:48.000]  this time we want to attack countries that are uh moderates saudi arabia and all these other jihad
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:53.040]  centers they want to fight they need to really get one well the the the good thing is that we have
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:59.840]  this constitution so we have at least a legal uh a trench line to fight in which is that our
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:07.200]  constitution is above sharia law and anybody who says for example hillary clinton she wants to
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:14.240]  to pass this thing called un resolution 1618 which outlaws blasphemy against islam like
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:19.040]  like obama said you know the future must not belong to those who slander the problem and that's
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.680]  why the internet now won't let you criticize islam enemy because that's blasphemy gone is our first
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:30.160]  amendment well that's sharia that's submission to sharia but there are thousands of veterans
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:34.800]  and particularly those who have fought in the middle east that have seen this evil up close
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:39.920]  and they're locked and loaded and they are not going to submit i guarantee you they're not i was
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:43.600]  about to say i don't think i don't know what the globals think they've been off but they are this
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:49.040]  is this is like two freight trains at 100 miles an hour going towards each other it is crazy it is
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:54.800]  crazy and it is just unbelievable to see this happening matt brackens our guest says paul watson

[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:12.960]  message here's why my friends we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse so
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:18.880]  please listen solar generators really do provide lifesaving electrical power and unlike gas generators
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:23.760]  solar generators run silently emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:28.880]  whether it's dangerous summer storms blackouts intensifying civil unrest you're not going to
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:32.640]  have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep and here's the best news if you want to get
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:38.320]  one this week solutions from science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:43.520]  they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low price

[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:54.320]  wars dot com it's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money go to
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:54:07.600]  grid wars dot com that's grid wars dot com ladies and gentlemen a globalist or anti-human tyrants
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:14.880]  islam gives them a billion four hundred million or so people that are used to living under tyranny
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:20.640]  and who are willing to go out and kill innocent people remember they're told to
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:28.400]  but to stir up these people the west has also launched wars over there that actually targeted
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.920]  the enemies of radical islam which shows you this has been a long-term strategic plan
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:41.280]  but this isn't the 1990s where they could just deny there was a treaty or deny there was an open
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:45.600]  border we're exposing it info wars dot com has been on the front lines of that
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:51.280]  whether it's obama opening the borders and trying to cover it up or the islamis is being brought in
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:57.280]  i think time is on our side overall i wanted to ask paul watch in his view on this and other
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:03.760]  tidbits but i just don't see how as this intensifies they're going to be able to cover up that there's
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:08.160]  islamic terror and that it's increasing and i just can't believe that the president and others of
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:13.200]  france are just making jokes about this and so we've got to just get used to it and you know we've
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:17.760]  got to just let jahadi's come and go i mean he's like kissing their butts i guess so he hopes they
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:22.640]  don't come kill him i mean is it just the incredible cowardice of these people or what is it paul
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:30.000]  um i mean you could say it was dot com syndrome but they've completely capitulated the narrative
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.720]  that you're now getting and you get this after every single attack is you know oh this is just
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:39.040]  going to make the right wing get into power this is going to cause more division if the right wing
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:45.120]  sees power and then there'll be more attacks so again it's that same narrative we're not being
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:50.800]  nice enough to the precious islamis you know don't upset them we have to appease them otherwise
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:56.080]  they'll kill us don't insult them don't draw the prophet muhammad well it hasn't worked has it it
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:02.560]  hasn't worked they've completely failed multiculturalism has failed most of these jihadists come from
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:08.960]  these islamic ghetto was created by the left mass immigration policies they all get free welfare free
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:13.760]  everything they just shit around these diaper outfits bitching all day it's like the in germany
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:18.160]  we interview they're like i got here everything's free i'm gonna take over i hate germany and i hate
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:24.320]  germans and they're just so honest like i hate you the guys just just like like a like a cartoon
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:30.080]  character but also you know it's not just socio-economics a lot of the suicide bombers are
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:34.960]  actually well educated so you can't just blame that as well so what comes next i mean where does
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:41.760]  this all end paul well it's we're in a war i mean the the head of the french police last week said
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:47.040]  one or two more islamic terror attacks in france it's civil war now the french have largely
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:52.160]  capitulated i what i'm predicting is this is going to happen in germany there's going to be a massive
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:56.720]  attack there's going to be a massive backlash there's going to be civil unrest there's going to be
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:01.360]  riots on the streets it's only a matter of time and let's be clear about the french head cop though
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:05.520]  he was saying i'm worried about right wingers we've got a pounce on them so they're gonna they're
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:09.680]  gonna go raid the right wingers if they even speak out no exactly and then you would talk
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:15.680]  about see something say nothing they let this guy sit on the road in his truck for nine hours when
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:20.800]  this road was supposed to be blocked off to all traffic they questioned him they did nothing
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:25.440]  we saw with sam Bernadino the neighbors they saw the packages coming in said nothing for fear of
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:29.840]  being cold rice they always nest in leftist areas that's a great point i want to hold you guys over
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:33.200]  five minutes for tourists come up i want to get final comments from both matt bracket it seems they
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:39.520]  always attack in nesting areas of ultra left and they go kill their leftist friends uh i mean is
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:46.000]  this part of the loving islam islam is indiscriminate in terms of who they murder they just you saw in
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:52.640]  bagdad they the you know that was just uh suny versus shia bringing a truck bomb into their
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:58.480]  holiest hour of the end of ramadan party sort of like basqueal day for islam that's when they
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:04.560]  detonated this huge truck bomb in the middle of a affluent shia shop shopping center i want to mention
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:11.760]  before i go since the last time i was on i wrote a short story called piss christ piss karan exclamation
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:17.200]  point that's on gates of vienna dot net there are ways to fight back there are some people that will
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:23.440]  fight back we won't submit now my my biggest fear is that at the end of the day the grid goes down
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:29.200]  almost every scenario results in in a possible uh grid we're back in 70 seconds i want you to
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:33.040]  spend a few minutes on that because it's not just the islamists are bringing in again the people
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:38.640]  running our country are trying to collapse us while building breakaway government reservations
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:43.200]  and corporate systems that are exempt to bring in a kind of new dark age where they then reorganize

[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:33.040]  weird way ashamed of it because it costs so much but it cost us 75 to 80 dollars a bottle just to
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:38.640]  package it just to put the bio pqq in it which is the equivalent of 300 pounds of blueberries

[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:13.520]  so
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:19.520]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:30.480]  so
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:39.920]  we're getting into the incremental selective enforcement of industrial society the post
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:43.520]  industrial world that the united nations officially has as international law
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:49.840]  but again the future will not be evenly distributed and it's not distributed
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:53.920]  evenly it's being distributed to the globalists that siphon off our energy our industry
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:59.440]  our inventions build their globalist system while collapsing the world into quagmire using
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:05.120]  islam and socialist revolutions to dumb the public down and put them into two different forms of
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:09.440]  brainwashing control mr bracken finish up with a few minutes on that and we'll talk to
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:15.280]  paul watson but uh you were talking about their other plan as they attack our energy supplies
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:21.040]  our grids everything going back to the beginning they show you said you're not a hero not a brave
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:26.640]  man i think you are i think that all of us now uh we need to stand on the skyline you know our
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:32.080]  training is to hide in the ditches to take a good shot and not to ever skyline ourselves but
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:36.400]  those of us in what you might call leadership positions it is our duty to hide to skyline
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:41.440]  ourselves which you are certainly doing going to cleveland and i admire you greatly for that
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:49.680]  also paul watson tremendous videos um if we're all the gray man the 1984 wins so there there is a
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:56.960]  time to hide now is not the time now is the time to stand tall i i do fear uh that there is not
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.280]  going to possibly not be an election certainly there wouldn't be a smooth transfer of power
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:08.960]  i expect assassinations i expect you know niece style attacks i expect a magazine dumps into
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:14.720]  crowds coming up because team tyranny is going to pull out all the stops we're going to see an
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:19.840]  escalation that's going to make our head spin and and we have to be prepared for that this is all
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:24.400]  part of a destabilization isn't the good news though that i see the military is almost completely
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:30.480]  awake cops are really waking up i mean i are you seeing that yes but the problem is if the
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:36.880]  power goes out it's very hard to for us to organize uh you forget about facebook there won't be
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:43.680]  television so uh we have to be prepared for a lot of worst case scenarios uh like my short story what
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:48.000]  i thought the coup my other short story a last brave new babel on sure well i just want to be
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:53.600]  clear on the whole angle i know there's no future if we don't fight now and so and that's that's why i
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:58.000]  am willing to take basically any risk at this point and i feel good about it because i realized
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.320]  down the road it gets too horrible matt bracken we're and we're not we're not youngsters you know
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:07.600]  what we've had a great life we've had a great shot we owe it to the next generation maybe they're
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:13.360]  being raised as brainwashed uh that's right there had to be some men in this age to stand up we'll
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:16.960]  talk to you again coming up maybe this sunday when uh because i'm going to be flying to cleveland
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:20.880]  there but uh we're going to have uh david niners hopefully you'll pop in with us for an hour we'll
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:24.560]  talk to you again mr bracken god bless you absolutely i mean there are still men left in
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:28.240]  the world i'll just say that and i'm not bowing down to any of this crap i'm done uh thank you sir
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:31.680]  paul watson i got a minute and a half thank you for joining it's the great work you're doing
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:38.000]  yeah i just finished by saying you know this is the most tumultuous year politically in my entire
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.120]  life there's gonna be more terror attacks there's gonna be riots there's gonna be civil unrest
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:50.000]  across the west but this will lead to the rise of populism as it's already doing throughout europe
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:56.880]  and also in america and that's the necessary medicine we need the left policy of multiculturalism
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:02.960]  has completely failed their neoliberal military interventionism has completely failed it's blown
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:09.840]  back it's created an absolute disaster and we need actual leaders to step up and fix this
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:13.920]  complete mess and hopefully that's what's gonna happen what else are you looking at paul what
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:17.840]  else is going up on info wars dot com i'm very thankful that drudge is pointing out that the
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:23.520]  newspapers won't say islamic terror and say truck but this this facebook for me not letting us put
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:28.960]  in islamic terror i mean in live time that should be the top story in the country there's proof to
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:35.200]  the senate of incredible censorship oh no they're up they're banning people all over facebook i've
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:40.240]  got to put one up on twitter it's a quote somebody posted on facebook i'm gonna condemn muslims and
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:46.800]  their death cult religion i'm not gonna say pray for friends banned deleted within hours of this
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:51.600]  attack so that's the most important thing is is banning delete and they target the little people
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:55.440]  first they don't try to ban the big guys first they ban the little people thinking you have no
[02:04:55.440 --> 02:05:01.840]  voice that's why you fight harder because you really are who are important white people get ready

[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:33.840]  tickets wait what is that a mooching mentality of an entitled millennial disguising their
[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:39.440]  intentions as social activism not very well i might add furthermore shackleford sees all whites
[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:44.880]  as oppressors so why would you ask for a handout from someone you hate she don't care she's a
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:51.760]  queer non-binary black fat fem who gets off on the amount of labels she has and oh yeah getting

[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:19.920]  out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the
[02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:25.600]  good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still

[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:33.920]  it's alex jones well for this hour former minnesota governor best-selling author
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:45.760]  former navy seal movie star patriot tv show host desi matured as our guest i remember when he uh
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:52.080]  for several years was kicked off of uh msnbc back when i had bigger ratings and cnn or fox you know
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:57.840]  huge ratings they they killed it he wouldn't endorse the iraq war so they just kicked him off the air
[02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:02.240]  even though he had great ratings that's why i really respect jessie ventura uh you also have
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:09.360]  someone like don trump who was against the war at that time and so even though i don't agree with
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:13.440]  maybe 10 with jessie ventura stands for it doesn't matter because all i want somebody that has
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:19.200]  integrity whether they be a talk show host or whether they be a president or a governor
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:24.480]  and that's what it's really all about what jessie ventura says he stands for is what he stands for
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:29.920]  and there's so much to talk to him about but i i gotta tell you getting to know him now hard to
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:38.080]  believe like eight nine years ago and now uh being a guest on several seasons of his popular show
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:46.000]  conspiracy theory everything we talked about the nsa spying uh the fema centers that's now
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:52.160]  been declassified by the way last year we've covered the resettlement program the program for
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:58.240]  world government atmospheric manipulation that's been partially declassified the brexit you know
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:03.520]  leaving the euro all of this is what he and i and others have covered because it was in the documents
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:15.920]  it wasn't it wasn't speculation it really is mind blowing and so we have to ask ourselves
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:24.080]  what point have we gotten to as a civilization where world government is out in the open
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:33.200]  they admitted to corporate unelected world government and those of us that exposed it
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:44.320]  before it was even admitted to exist do we get an apology and see it's it's not about those of you
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:48.320]  that exposed this kidding an apology or myself getting an apology it's about the fact that we knew
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:52.720]  what was going on
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:02.640]  we understood what was unfolding we warned people accurately and so the general public
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:06.880]  needs to remember that and they are starting to remember that and so yes this show and others
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:10.000]  like it have more credibility and you've got all the government disinfo shills out there that
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.920]  cause end fighting and you know make up silly stories of things that can't be proven but but
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:17.680]  to be called a conspiracy theorist is just someone that is questioning
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:26.240]  known liars in the political spectrum and all these multinational interests
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:33.360]  that are coming in and taking control of our government and our process and i think we can
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:38.240]  all agree no matter what color we are or what party we're in or where we're from that we just want
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:44.320]  transparency we want our governments back we want to be populist now the question is what type of
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:50.960]  populist are you we're going to jesse ventura's phone dropping just came back we know that we've
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:54.240]  attacked the middle east for no reason we know we've overthrown moderates we know now they've
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:12:00.480]  put in radicals and then have opened up europe and the west to it to cause a destabilization
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:04.480]  that i believe will be a backlash to further invade the middle east in the future but also
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:08.640]  take our liberties domestically full spectrum dominance and i want to get jesse ventura's
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:14.800]  take on that i want to talk about his new book one of many bestsellers bleep politicians talk
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:20.960]  about s word politicians say stuff politicians say the funniest dumbest most outrageous things
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:25.040]  ever uttered by leaders number one haven't read the book yet but it's got to be where the congressman
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:29.600]  thinks that guam is a floating island you're a former navy seal governor uh let's fact check
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:36.800]  that congressman from georgia do islands float sir what are islands uh do islands float i don't
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:43.760]  think so i i you know i've been all through southeast asian great parts of the pacific i did
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:52.240]  17 months deployed overseas two tours and i never ran into any floating islands well you're a
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:57.760]  conspiracy theorist i'm saying wait and i and i and i had to swim in a lot of those waters so i
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:02.320]  would have been up close and personal to them too well we're not going to believe you we're just
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:05.680]  going to say you're a conspiracy theorist because the congressman said they float wow where should
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:10.320]  we start i mean what do you think about the terror attacks that we just saw on the last few months the
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:17.760]  one last night in europe well alex what people failed to realize i was talking somewhere one time
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:24.800]  and and there was a there was a a muslim girl waited young and she had the whole get up on you know
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:30.320]  that the stuff they wear and you know i'm not really privy to it being a non-believer i don't
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:35.600]  pay attention to all that stuff with any of them but uh she waited for me and afterwards she came
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:42.320]  up to me and said governor venturi you know exactly you understand the middle east and this is what i
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:50.800]  had said all of this stems from the root problem of colonialism that took place decades and decades
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:58.480]  ago where europe through colonizing the world at some point did it to the middle east and what
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:06.000]  they did they formed countries not based upon the tribes there they placed them upon what they wanted
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:10.880]  you know okay french you're going to take care of this and you're going to take care of that
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:20.960]  and that all to to profit them that's right and they and so you have all the countries have three different religious
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:26.720]  factions that have been warring for years and the only way to keep them under control was to have
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:33.440]  dictators well now we've gone in and taken out all the dictators and now look what you've got this
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:39.200]  is all blowback to me it's blowback from colonialism you sure you're absolutely right and nobody's
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:43.600]  talking about that i mean i you just said it's so true the british created saudi arambia out of
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:48.800]  like four or five groups iraq was created out of three different roads uh all these countries it
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:55.440]  wasn't done according to the needs of the people there it was done according to whatever the europe
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:15:02.800]  colonialization wanted and now it's blowing back on europe because they're getting hit pretty hard
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:10.080]  with it and and to me that's the root problem just like okay we'll transition to what's happening
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:17.120]  in america right here with our police and our black community and all this okay racism is definitely
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:22.960]  one of the problems but that takes generations to get rid of you can't change that overnight
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:30.320]  people's feelings like that but here's the root problem alex the war on drugs sure that's what's
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:37.120]  militarized our police it's made it to where they bust door downs come in shooting first and asking
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:41.040]  questions i was about to say i mean you can really blame the feds they have done all the federal
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:46.000]  training the instinctive shooting the no-knock warrants the asset forfeiture that is all
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:51.520]  the federal government bipartisan going right back to richard nixon and i say stop it like well
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:57.680]  just like you say i totally agree well the point is that's if you end if you end the war on drugs
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:04.480]  you end the militarization of our police when i was doing my internet show i had a 10 or 12 year
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:12.240]  balkamore police cop veteran on and he agreed with me and concurred fully with that by the way
[02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:15.920]  speaking of that you've done all sorts of tv shows can i talk about the r-t thing coming up
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:24.560]  well i haven't officially inked it yet you know it it's unofficial unofficial were i saw it i
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:28.640]  mean i saw the news articles i'm not so i know i'm leaking something but i mean i'd love to see
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:34.000]  that larry king can say whatever he wants on there so yeah no i uh i'm in let's just put it this way
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:43.360]  i'm in i'm in final negotiations with our t good and here's what i find amazing amazing is that i
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:51.920]  grew up alex and lived through the entire cold war right and now i'm censored throughout the united
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:58.560]  states i can't get on tv shows i can't do this i got 33 media conglomerates opposing my lawsuit
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:06.080]  to clear my name and all this stuff and yet who's going to give me the freedom to speak freely the
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:10.240]  russians that's crazy and you know it's crazy because i've talked to folks that have had shows
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:14.000]  and i've talked to one of the producers for larry king because i've met king before out in la and
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:17.520]  they said no he can just say whatever he wants to do even ask what he's going to say and it's like
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:22.800]  wow you know working at msnbc i know being around fox is seeing and they try to control everything
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:30.960]  you say oh alex i found this out when i went to moscow in december when when vladimir putin spoke
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:37.440]  that night at the ten year anniversary he stated he will never interfere artistically he will never
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:42.400]  interfere with anything we want to talk about we hear from our media he totally controls the media
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:49.680]  oh it's the opposite i have i'm going there for freedom i can't even talk here it's the russians
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:54.560]  who are giving me free speech to jessie venpera well that's because they've already been to the
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:58.640]  bottom and we haven't hit the bottom yet and i don't want to help well the point is they're
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:07.200]  embracing capitalism when i was over there they're embracing it so much alex all stores are open 24
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:16.880]  seven i know that's competition everything's open all the time amazing amazing well i can't
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:21.920]  wait i saw that blue alex is that not embracing capitalism i know they have lower taxes than we
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:27.840]  do they can go out at three in the morning and buy a tuxedo someone will be there to wait on you
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:31.520]  that's crazy i've talked to folks that they're really trying to rebuild russia and look at how
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:35.600]  the west has got all these sanctions and moving weapons in did you see putin come out and warn
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:40.960]  the press of nuclear war and the chinese president just uh monday warned of of war with the united
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:44.480]  states and again i don't defend the economy chinese they're terrible government but their
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:49.200]  people are good but it's true that the west is really moving in up against their borders uh
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:56.800]  it's also a fact i heard putin speak he was getting grilled by a bbc guy and the guy was
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:04.000]  grilling putin on russia's aggression and putin was so cool and calm he said well let's put this
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:11.680]  in the common sense for a moment if we can russia has two bases military outside of russia two or
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:18.240]  three um the united states has a hundred what 178 big ones it's like 500 something like that
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:22.880]  putin said using common sense who's the aggressor
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:32.000]  i mean come on we got military i i'm for bringing all closing them bases and bringing our young
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.920]  men and women home where they belong and then if you want to have them guard our border let's do it
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:42.960]  with the u.s military well that's what they're supposed to do in the constitution you know well
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:48.480]  that's what i'm advocating if you're worried about our borders let's have the military truly
[02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:52.560]  protect them yeah walls not gonna do it i mean i like trump but the wall thing is build a bigger

[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:26.000]  just is a really good guy he's been through so much demonization so much disinfo they were
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:29.520]  scared of him running for president well he was just telling me you know he never really made an
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:33.920]  announcement he's not running for president he was telling me why and i want him to spend some time
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:38.400]  talking about that the state of the world and where he sees things are going so governor if you don't
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:44.480]  mind uh repeat what you were just telling me during the break well i i i took hard consideration to
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:51.360]  run alex the uh libertarians contacted me on two occasions and invited me to their big convention in
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:58.320]  orlando but i chose not to go because i sat down with my wife and we talked and uh here's how i felt
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:06.000]  i i'm 65 i just uh it's my birthday i go on medicare today that wonderful happy birthday i didn't
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:12.640]  know it was your birthday you're welcome oh thank you i should say yeah anyway though okay that
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:17.520]  me i run and i run the win and i truly think i could have won in light of the fact that both
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:25.200]  these candidates have negatives that are you know over 50 but that aside i had it in my gut to run
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:31.920]  i wanted to debate him i'd love to take him on but where i fell short in my heart was i didn't feel
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:38.720]  at this time in my life that i wanted to give a hundred percent to late 70 minimum and you gotta do
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:46.400]  it and i just didn't feel i could do that i i if it was 10 years ago i would have did it but i at
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:53.440]  this point personally in my life i know i got only a finite number of years left and as you get older
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:59.360]  and go on medicare it actually becomes more apparent to you believe it or not and i just
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:06.560]  couldn't bring myself to dedicate the hundred percent needed to do that and my wife did not
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:14.720]  want me to run and she's been with me 41 years and i always say this i will pick her over any
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:21.040]  elected official position oh she's a great lady any of them absolutely but expanding on
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:25.760]  why you're very close to doing this big show with rt rt globally is much bigger than cnn
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:31.600]  hundreds of millions of viewers i mean it's really amazing if it's second only to the bbc
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:37.040]  now in the world it's like an 800 million homes throughout the world which shows how discredited
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:41.520]  our media is cnn used to be one of the biggest now no one will carry it overseas it's i mean
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:46.480]  we're so distrusted so so let's talk about that you were saying you have a larger mission than
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:53.360]  just trying to be us president well when i chose not to run for president this december i made a
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:27:00.240]  trip to moscow on behalf of rt because rt and i are going to work together russian television i
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:07.280]  hope we're very close right now to doing the deal and i'm getting older and you know you choose
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:12.640]  the things you want to do or the legacy you want to finish your life with and i was so impressed
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:18.000]  with the russian people when i went over there meeting the common people and it bothered me
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:23.520]  so much having parents who were who fought side by side with the russians and as allies in world
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:32.560]  war two my father spoke very highly of the russian gbat new and uh i want my legacy now to be i want
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:38.880]  to work for russian television and i want to try to bridge the gap any small way i can to make the
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:46.480]  united states and russia friends instead of enemies we should be friends not adversaries or
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:54.720]  enemies anymore they've embraced capitalism so much over there alex stores everything is open 24
[02:27:54.720 --> 02:28:00.800]  seven now that's capital what do you make of nature the globalist uh the republicans and
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:07.440]  democrats obama trying to start a war with russia it's just crazy this isn't iraq it is utterly crazy
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:14.560]  i went i met russian people over there the short time i was there they're they're happy people they're
[02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:20.400]  out from underneath communism they're enjoying a freedom they've never felt before but they're
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:26.640]  new they're just growing at it imagine what our country was like in its first 10 years or whatever
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:33.600]  it's been now i guess 91 when it fell so it's a little over 25 lousy years well they have to have
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:41.280]  a chance and we're not giving it to them where we ought to be standing with them and working with
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:49.760]  them i guess our industrial war machine needs to be fed continually doesn't it well my job i believe
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:54.960]  in life right now is going to be to try to over bridge that i want to be friends with russia not
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:59.040]  enemies sure well world government wants world government and russia doesn't want to be part
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:02.880]  of the world government uh so that's what's happened in fact it's only russia that's the
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:06.480]  holdout the communist chinese are heavily involved the whole project though they've been kind of
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:10.160]  double crossing each other now we're going to break here in a moment but and talk about your book
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:16.480]  what do you make of just briefly all the communist chinese talk of war with the us just crazy well
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:21.760]  i haven't followed that alex that's new to me i don't watch the news and like you do you know i
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:26.240]  try to break away from it well our news won't tell anybody about it i just i just we we write
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:30.160]  articles about the official communist party saying they're getting ready for war with the us this is
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:38.080]  unpressing to talk well you know i don't know i all i can say is this i know two years ago there
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:44.400]  was an international poll done by gallup i think where they pulled like 3000 people internationally
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:51.120]  and they posed the question if you went to war who do you think would likely be your adversary the
[02:29:51.120 --> 02:30:00.320]  empire 23 of them said the united states let's talk about that that's a great point we'll do that
[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:06.640]  white people get ready to write checks and give up your car keys black lives matter organizer
[02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:13.120]  ashley shackleford wants reparations from all white people for 400 years of slavery when only

[02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:26.320]  fuck you pay me pay me a check pay me consistently provide me safe housing offer me a job with
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:33.120]  benefits run me those fiance tickets wait what is that a mooching mentality of an entitled millennial
[02:30:33.120 --> 02:30:38.640]  disguising their intentions as social activism not very well i might add furthermore shackleford
[02:30:38.640 --> 02:30:44.400]  sees all whites as oppressors so why would you ask for a handout from someone you hate she don't care
[02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:51.440]  she's a queer non-binary black fat fem who gets off on the amount of labels she has and oh yeah

[02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:24.560]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alex jones
[02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:34.880]  general's gathered in their masses just like witches at black masses
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:44.960]  evil minds that plot destruct sorcerers of death's construction i'll tell you i've been to a lot of
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:50.720]  big rallies i've snuck into bohemian grove i've covered military drills i've gone out and protested
[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:57.040]  the kukloss clan and mechela raza and the and the black new black panther party but i do have a
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:03.680]  few butterflies about what's coming up next week in cleveland i'll be there i'm gonna be speaking
[02:34:03.680 --> 02:34:08.480]  of some rallies i'm gonna be doing live broadcasts and a lot of big interviews i'll be wearing my
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:15.360]  hillary for prison shirt the fbi is saying they think there may be terror attacks at this event
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:20.160]  or whatever i think overall it's more dangerous driving down the highway but what i know is more
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:26.320]  dangerous is not being engaged not being involved and just rolling over for minnesota governor jesse
[02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:33.440]  ventura is our guest uh sh you know what t politicians say the funniest dumbest most outrageous
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:38.240]  things ever uttered by our leaders i want to talk some about the book here in a moment and i want to
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:43.920]  talk about uh ventura suit he won for defamation now that's been overturned going back to the full
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:47.680]  court he's not really been saying a lot about that because obviously it's going to be litigated
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:54.160]  but first let's talk about election 2016 i have problems with trump saying torture ices though i
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:58.240]  don't like ices we know where torture goes like let me speak to that but overall he's more of a
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:02.320]  populace here i know your friends with him uh i think he really does want to do some things
[02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:06.560]  it'll make this country more successful hillary is a globalist he's dialed into all the corruption
[02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:13.440]  uh i mean trump is more of an outsider than her i'm all in for trump personally uh what is your
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:19.440]  your view on 2016 and where this is going and what is your prediction jesse ventura well for me
[02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:28.640]  it's what i want to see happen is this you got two candidates here trump and hillary whose negatives
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:34.560]  are the highest in history their negatives are higher than their positives their negatives are up
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:46.320]  60 60 some percent and all that i think it opens the door finally let's have debates and let's
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:53.840]  include gary johnson of the libertarian party and give people an alternative to where they can say
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:36:01.200]  no to these two parties and yes to a third alternative finally in this country i'm hoping
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:07.680]  this happens alex i'm hoping gary johnson does well enough that he wins his home state maybe
[02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:14.880]  squeaks out somewhere else and then trump and hillary both split the electoral college so
[02:36:14.880 --> 02:36:22.880]  that nobody gets elected and then maybe out of the 2016 election they'll do away with the antiquated
[02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:29.200]  electoral college system and go back to a one that says if you get the most votes you win well
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:33.360]  that's a great point because i understand states that have a lower population not wanting to be
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:37.280]  slaves of a bigger state and i get the two senators being sent but then the house being
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:44.560]  apportioned but what i don't like is the 1972 78 rules where the dems and the republics can sit
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:50.480]  there the crypts and the bloods as you call them can sit there and say oh we don't care about your
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:55.440]  popular vote we're just going to give this to whoever we want like george will wrote the sovereigns
[02:36:55.440 --> 02:37:00.720]  of the party well the republican so far failed i talked to roger stone today he was being summoned
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:06.000]  by trump so he couldn't come on today but um he's been on this obviously in studio coming up at the
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:13.440]  r&c but they tried to steal it from trump they they succeeded with sanders and i just can't believe
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:18.160]  even seeing and admitted well the ap is overseeing the election and they met with the super delegates
[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:22.320]  who said they were going for hillary so they agreed to call it for hillary and not look at the votes
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:27.760]  in california that was so surreal for me to see them openly say the popular vote didn't count
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:33.280]  well and so we'll look at let's just go back to every other election if you go for mayor
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:41.760]  governor congressman senator he gets the most votes wins yet in 2000 al gore got a half a
[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:48.560]  million more votes yet george bush was the president now that's insane how can you get
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:56.640]  the most votes and lose it's insane and the reason you got the electoral college initially
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:38:02.080]  was because they had to do it they had to ride by horseback to washington to elect the president
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:08.800]  so they had to send delegates well when's the last time anybody went on horseback to washington
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:13.760]  what do you think of the arrogance of the dems and republicans claiming they could
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:17.760]  just ignore the popular vote openly i mean this has been pushed out in the open is what i'm saying
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:24.720]  yeah it's horrible and the point is why isn't gary johnson we haven't seen a third party since
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:32.880]  ross perot in 92 up on that stage why what's wrong with having a third or a fourth have four
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:37.920]  people up there and then people can look at all four of them or three greeny you can put up there
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:45.040]  too the green party the the uh uh uh libertarians the democrats and the republicans and that way
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:51.040]  the people can hear four people and what their vision is because i am voting for gary johnson
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:59.040]  proudly i'm voting for someone not against someone you have been friends with trump for
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:05.920]  a long time overall gary gary gary goes where i go gary believes sure sure no i totally respect
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:12.240]  your saying i mean but and he believes in ending the war on drugs listen jesse i totally hear what
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:17.760]  you're saying my question is separately just trump is the man who i know you've been friends with for
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:23.440]  a long time uh i mean do you think he's for real and what he's doing i certainly want to believe
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:30.720]  he is i mean it's the most important job pretty much on the planet well i think he's very serious i
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:35.600]  think he's very serious do it because i didn't feel i could give a hundred percent in doing the job
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:40.480]  what do you make of his overall courage i mean out there in the face of all these threats and
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:45.200]  what he's doing he's sure working his butt off well and he needs to but they they should all he
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:49.920]  should also be careful it's a thing you know i'm the conspiracy theorist right i'm labeled that
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:55.440]  because i did the tv show and this and that well let's do a scenario for a minute have
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:40:02.960]  a little more big fun with it alex okay you guys trump is being set up perfectly to be taken out
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:11.120]  because uh he now is going to pick this insider from indiana who's well received by the establishment
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:18.960]  republicans called to unite the party back well he's only going to be a heartbeat away now who do
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:25.600]  you think would make the best be javiyas world an undocumented mexican or a muslim
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.800]  i'd be a disgruntled right winger that's what they want to do
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:36.400]  um well no no i think you put it on new maybe an undocumented mexican that way we'll hate
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:40.880]  mexico even worse because they you know he assassinated donald
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:46.240]  think about i mean i may have been fun if i was a script writer
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:51.920]  no i hear you don't worry listen the super service admits that donald trump is probably
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:57.040]  the most threatened candidate in in history and we've seen a repeat and i've talked to the insiders
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:03.520]  i'm just gonna leave it at that not just stone and what's happened here is just like 1980 when
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:07.600]  they told reagan you better take george herbert walker bush or we're not going to let you have it
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:12.560]  they still are fighting today in the rules committee as we speak to try to steal the
[02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:18.000]  nomination from trump but it's basically failed and that is from stone and one other person but
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:24.800]  they were just saying genrich is even worse and that's who the elite up the number adelson
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:31.600]  up the number to 300 million dollars if trump would have taken uh genrich instead he took
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:39.680]  this gentleman mr pence governor pence because he's seen as not as aggressive and as dangerous
[02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:44.160]  and they don't see him as somebody that would try to assassinate uh trump uh little bird told me
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:50.640]  that's what you make of that well i don't know but like i said if i if i i always made why do you
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:56.640]  think i made the statement ingest but it had some reality to it when i said i wanted to run but i
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:00.720]  wanted howard stern is my running mate yes so they never want to kill you to not make the president
[02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:05.040]  howard exactly and i don't know i get it i get it this this makes it more palatable for the
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:08.960]  establishment to kill trump not the pence would be involved because they want to put pence in just
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:15.280]  like reagan got shot you know the day after if they get their guy a heart beat away and he's the
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:22.400]  loyal old to bring you know of the old guard of the corporate republicans that you know that that
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:29.440]  trump is dislodging hey donnell's only one guy see that's why trump would have been better off to
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:37.120]  take me because they would want him way more than me now i hear you absolutely you would have been
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:43.520]  a great choice you would have been a great choice and i say that you laugh about it but i i hey i don't
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:50.240]  this is the most power game in the world we're talking here and you don't think people will do
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:59.600]  take drastic measures and if they feel the times are drastic they will that is an amazing point
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:04.720]  you just raised okay in your gut every sit around the dinner table with your with your wife talking
[02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:09.680]  about you know jesse who do you think's gonna win the election what do you tell her right now i don't
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:15.920]  know because as i said the two major candidates their negatives are so high and now they claim
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:24.400]  they're running even uh which way the wind blows a couple things will come into play if women decide
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:32.560]  ultimately they want a woman president hillary wins if that if that comes into play for whatever
[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:37.360]  reason sure what do you make i agree what do you make of trump not going with the gimmick of a woman
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:43.600]  of not doing what i mean i think it would have been a plus there's a lot of able women i i'm
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:48.000]  actually surprised if i was trump i probably would have gone with a woman yeah but wouldn't
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:52.800]  that look like what you're doing yeah but i mean if it's a qualified person then what what does it
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:58.960]  matter i i don't know hillary's saying elizabeth warren where it's all women so it's total gimmick
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:06.160]  you know well you know and he he hasn't picked elizabeth warren yet let me ask you this don't
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:12.560]  you think hillary's a lot worse than donald trump do i think hillary's worse than donald trump yeah um
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:22.080]  i don't i to be honest here's the problem as an individual i don't i know hillary a donald
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:28.720]  probably isn't as bad as an individual but what i worry about are the parties and i don't care what
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:38.080]  you say i fear the republicans more than i do the democrats and so if the republicans have the power
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:44.720]  that means republican things are going to get implemented which means what women won't be allowed
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:50.880]  abortions anymore and things of that nature are gay rights gay people can't get married now because
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:58.960]  the republicans are back in charge uh so when it comes to that as individuals but the fear i have is
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:05.040]  the parties run the operation no matter what especially if donald you know gives in and
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:10.400]  takes a party solid guy to unite them well then they're going to get their influence back well
[02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:14.000]  let's talk about that i mean you were the populist dark horse that got into minnesota and the model
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:18.400]  for swartz snare everything else and i mean what was it like i mean you you talked about first week
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:22.560]  there the cia comes to visit you you might you know tell folks that story again i mean you've
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:26.880]  been there what is it like even at a state level with the bureaucracy when it shows up and tells you
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:33.840]  who's boss well they don't really tell you who's who's boss what you've got to do you've got to
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:41.920]  create the the main people around you you have to trust explicitly that they are loyal to your agenda
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:48.160]  and not to any and they're not being influenced by any other agenda and that's what i fear in
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:54.800]  the case of trump he's a republican so the republicans are going to get their foothold in there
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:46:00.240]  they're going to get their people on to the inside maybe as a chief of staff or an assistant to this
[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:07.040]  or that and see that's the part you got to worry about your most loyal people that you count on one
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:14.960]  hand had bettered completely be from your corner and not be coming in with an ulterior motive
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:18.560]  that's right even if you're running a media organization or a business or a company your
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:26.000]  biggest issue is your lieutenants going on on their own agendas right and you want their
[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:32.480]  what you have to have their loyalty have to and and and it ain't gonna come from the political
[02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:39.280]  party the established party because the established party's loyalty is to the established party not
[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:46.640]  to you it was interesting when i became governor i didn't hire hardly anybody from the independence
[02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:51.760]  party and i told them point blank i said if you elected me thinking you were going to get a job
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:57.280]  at the capital you were on board for the wrong reason i will be hiring the best people to do
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:04.960]  the job at the capital and politics will not come into play on that aspect and i took a lot of heat
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:11.280]  from my own party because of that because so many people think when you win oh i helped now i get
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:17.600]  this cushy job well with me ah not unless you're qualified to do that cushy job
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:26.560]  jesse ventura's our guest like george bush when he put his buddy who who ran the uh american
[02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:32.720]  arabian club for horses or something in charge of fema member brownie you're doing a hell of a job
[02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:39.600]  well yeah well there's your example he puts a guy who ain't even qualified don't know nothing about it
[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:45.280]  in charge of the military another good example dick cheney never served a day got five deferments yet
[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:50.800]  he's made secretary of defense well that's a neocon thing where everybody has to be a chicken
[02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:55.200]  hawk you're not in the club unless you're a chicken hawk so whatever but i mean see that's
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:48:02.560]  where i was different and that's where donald has to maintain his integrity keep his original people
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:08.080]  who believed in what he was doing intact who are loyal to him because if he lets the party get the
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:15.680]  foothold in there i totally agree this this this pence thing uh is not good uh but i mean compared
[02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:21.280]  to jan riche i mean if he'd have done jan riche i it'd have been some i was i think i you know i
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:26.240]  heard the general would have been a great pick but they they didn't like it because he was too
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:31.520]  socially liberal i know which i thought would have been a good move did i thought that was the best
[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:36.800]  move he could that that would be the way he'd get some of the sanders people and plan has a lot of
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:41.760]  integrity he's the guy that exposed obama and everybody's running al-qaeda and i there you go
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:48.800]  i i would have had i've been trump he would have been my choice not or not not any of these other
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:52.000]  well the left was scared of them they kind of exaggerated some of the more liberal things but
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:57.600]  he is more quasi that way uh but i mean flin's just really i looked at his whole history uh he
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:03.120]  has really he got fired by obama for you know wanting to not back isis and uh really isn't a
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:07.440]  lot of great work and as a patriot you can look at him though i mean he's not an ego maniac crazy
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:11.760]  person i mean i'll be honest jessie i'm hanging around you totally normal guy you know just a
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:15.280]  real person i've been around i'm gonna you know rallies and stuff i've covered hillary you just
[02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:20.320]  see her in person she looks like a rubber like joker creature or something and of course her
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:24.800]  actions are evil but i mean just the way she looks she's scary to me i mean i'll be honest
[02:49:24.800 --> 02:49:28.400]  i'm voting for trump just because hillary scares me and by the way you say you like the russians
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:32.320]  the russian government officially tries to not get involved in our politics but they say we're
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:38.000]  scared of hillary and trump is the clear better choice for russia to see yeah but you know what
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:44.240]  may be but i still won't go as far as to vote for those parties that's why i'll differ from you to
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:50.800]  the very end i'm voting for support gary johnson who will get us out of the wars and will end the
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:55.360]  war on drugs those are two you know i know gary johnson i know you know him too he's been on the
[02:49:55.360 --> 02:50:01.200]  show a lot i've been around him in person quite a bit and man i just it's like he you're talking to
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:06.800]  a frickin brick wall or a robot or something man not an evil robot but a robot i just i love people
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:11.680]  that are real jessie like i mean i mean you know gary i understand i see the difference between and
[02:50:11.680 --> 02:50:17.840]  it's sad the difference between gary and i if i would have did it i have something that is required
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:23.600]  i believe alex and you know what that something is it's called charisma that's exactly he doesn't
[02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:30.640]  have it yeah and unfortunately gary is not a person that walks around with great charisma and it
[02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:36.720]  shouldn't be it shouldn't matter but unfortunately it does but i will still vote for him because
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:42.080]  i ain't sure i'll be honest i don't trust somebody doesn't have charisma and hillary hillary doesn't
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:47.440]  have it she has like the opposite of it you have it i have it obviously trump's got it i just if
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:51.600]  you don't have charisma just get the hell away from me i just see who i am a woman can be the most
[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:55.280]  beautiful woman in the world she doesn't have charisma she's uglier to hell to me a woman
[02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:59.440]  didn't even that good looking she's got charisma baby that is sexy final segment with jessie ventura

[02:53:57.520 --> 02:54:06.560]  one dot com i was just talking about black lives matter with governor mature and we'll get into
[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:10.080]  that another interview but he was just talking about this minnesota case with a guy that can still carry
[02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:17.520]  he had a job for many years as a manager wasn't a bad guy and the cops pull him over get him out
[02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:20.880]  and do shoot him in the back four times because they see a gun which he told him i have a gun
[02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:26.320]  that's when they flip out uh so there are bad cops it does go on my point is the globalists
[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:30.160]  are manipulating that to cause a civil war to get us all fighting with each other but
[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:33.440]  i want to get into your book but 60 seconds on the whole black lives matter thing governor
[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:39.760]  well you know i can only tell you this when i was governor we commissioned a big study in
[02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:46.880]  minnesota with like 60 of our police forces on traffic stops and it came back overwhelmingly
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:53.920]  blacks get stopped more even though they're in comparison to the number of drivers overwhelmingly
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:55:00.480]  they're padded down more but here was the shocker overwhelmingly the white people are caught with
[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:09.520]  the contraband more so than the blacks interesting isn't that something the blacks get to padded
[02:55:09.520 --> 02:55:16.000]  down more they get pulled over more but the whites are carrying contraband at a much higher level
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:21.680]  and then the blacks do because maybe the blacks know they're going to get padded down as they get
[02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:25.200]  well i was about to say the new york times had a big study showing that they're not actually
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:29.120]  shooting more blacks on average and whites but they are uh pulling them over and patting them
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:32.960]  down and violating their rights more often and and it is a problem it's all part of the paranoid
[02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:36.320]  culture i'm just saying this whole black lives matter going out and shooting innocent cops
[02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:42.800]  more paranoid elix let me interject to it's all part of the war on drugs because they pull people
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:49.680]  over predominantly in the in the in the poorer neighborhoods trying to ultimately find drugs
[02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:54.240]  because then they profit from it they know i know i worked in a bad neighborhood at a large at a
[02:55:54.240 --> 02:55:57.520]  small animal that was a large animal that later when i was in high school and i probably got
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:00.720]  pulled over 10 times because it was in that neighborhood believe me i know and it was just
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:06.000]  a real neighborhood profit from it because if they bust you for drugs they get to keep your car
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.960]  they get to do all this stuff that should be against the constitution they have no right
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:16.080]  to to take people's personal property look i i totally disagree with the police state i totally
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:20.720]  agree i'm just trying to stop a civil war but i totally agree with you jesse ventura is our guest
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:25.120]  sh you know what t politicians say amazing book i've already been scanning through we're almost
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:29.840]  out of time but some of these crazy quotes which one is which one do you think's the craziest well
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:35.440]  for me it's the one george bush said because you know i did the conspiracy theory show and the one
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:43.280]  that where he said i'll be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:55.040]  this oval office now alex is that a confession yeah it's just bizarre he's mentally ill i mean i
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:57:02.000]  and then another one of my favorites so we're fair was al gore a zebra does not change its spots
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:08.800]  what about this one death has a tendency to encourage a depressing view of war
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:15.440]  yeah that was titled rumsfeld the concept of global warming was created
[02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:20.880]  buying for the chinese order to make the u.s manufacturing non-competitive i actually i
[02:57:20.880 --> 02:57:25.120]  disagree with you that is dead on jesse i think that's dead on with more of the globalist not
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:33.120]  so much the chinese well so well what do you think climate change is not real well certainly climate
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:36.880]  change is always going on but i'm saying the whole height deal about carbon taxes you should
[02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:41.600]  have said carbon taxes okay well whatever what are some of the other good ones i mean this is a
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:46.160]  book you hardly can put down i just got this morning it's a fun book and it'll also make you
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:50.400]  angry and i think the thing i'll tell you the thing that was interesting in researching the
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:56.160]  book alex quickly i can't believe what our founding fathers said about each other
[02:57:57.440 --> 02:58:03.360]  oh man john adams doesn't have anything good to say about george washington and he has
[02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:10.480]  bitter with uh with uh uh thomas jefferson and yet if these things said they're as bad as you can
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:17.120]  imagine and yet and they weren't singing kumbaya by the fire and yet they still got together
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:21.920]  and managed to create this great nation with the constitution and the bill of rights
[02:58:23.120 --> 02:58:26.720]  listen i've read all your books they're all excellent i am going to read this and over and

[03:00:20.880 --> 03:00:25.840]  a patriot of course he's a libertarian and a little creature told me a little birdie told me he's a
[03:00:25.840 --> 03:00:39.040]  listener we haven't reached out to him haven't we like i said when i walked into concert two years
[03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:45.120]  ago here alex cooper had seen himself as like a teenager and this was playing it sounded better
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:51.600]  than the record i was talking to jessie vinter during the break and he said man be careful in
[03:00:51.600 --> 03:01:00.160]  cleveland he said wow all the word is it is going to be a 15 range circus and you know it's something
[03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:04.240]  i gotta do because most people won't even get politically involved they won't even go and speak
[03:01:04.240 --> 03:01:10.400]  out they won't even uh you know in my life i'm there for my children i'm the person that takes care
[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:16.560]  of them it's me and i'm the guy that runs this operation and and all this means a lot to me but
[03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:23.920]  at the same time with great power comes great responsibility and you have to metaphysically
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:33.840]  put your skin on a routine basis in the arena and not just be a pundit and that brings me back
[03:01:33.840 --> 03:01:38.960]  to that teddy roosevelt quote about the man in the arena forget about the person that sets up in
[03:01:38.960 --> 03:01:43.600]  the bleachers bitching and complaining and you know saying how the great men could have done
[03:01:43.600 --> 03:01:47.520]  something better or where they stumbled you better relieve i stumble all the time and i'm
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:54.560]  moving forward and david night's going to be going also up to the uh democrat situation
[03:01:54.560 --> 03:01:58.160]  in philadelphia he's already been up there with jacari before that when the pope was there that
[03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:05.040]  place is a circus and it's just something you have to do because we don't have a future if we
[03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:10.560]  don't engage the globals we're saying it's a big isis al qaeda target i'm not scared of an individual
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:16.080]  isis al qaeda attack i'm scared of us capitulating to it and allowing the type of censorship i want
[03:02:16.080 --> 03:02:20.720]  to go to david night here david well what is it like for you because it's so surreal for me to see
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:29.840]  our our anti-hillary airplane censored twice unprecedented exclusion zones uh to see them
[03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:34.160]  blocking us on facebook even saying radicalism we just can't even type it in we show it no one
[03:02:34.160 --> 03:02:40.480]  cares uh mainstream media running around uh saying i got crazy guy on a truck seeing in
[03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:44.480]  new york times hundreds of publications they're just and instead the french prime minister and
[03:02:44.480 --> 03:02:48.720]  people want just the proud saying good we need to accept this and let jahadi's in that's actual
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:55.680]  quote today the stock home syndrome weirdness he's getting so crazy you see the concerted effort
[03:02:55.680 --> 03:03:02.080]  what type of elite that already run everything want to break up our families bankrupt us and then
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:08.720]  bring in whacked out radical islamicist it's just doesn't compute until you realize it's pure evil
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:13.280]  we're dealing with yeah alex i was talking to uh dare me bring about that excellent report that he
[03:03:13.280 --> 03:03:18.240]  and rob Jacobson did yesterday about what facebook was doing to not only censor but to alter the idea
[03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:23.600]  you know to say uh no you can't say muslim terrorists you must say muslims are not terrorists they only
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:28.960]  give you a multiple choice they don't allow you to freely enter in tags and that's what people
[03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:32.640]  were not understanding a lot of people are why can type in muslim terrorists it's like no no no
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:38.160]  these are the tags that you don't see that allow people to find what you're putting up there but
[03:03:38.160 --> 03:03:43.280]  of course when i was talking to darin he said remember that they had the open mic and they
[03:03:43.280 --> 03:03:48.720]  caught zuckerberg talking to uh merkel and she said we need to cut down on people you know saying
[03:03:48.720 --> 03:03:52.880]  certain things because i've got that covered and then they uh they shut off the mic on that
[03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:57.440]  they're talking about what kind of people do this i've got uh some stories i want to tell people
[03:03:57.440 --> 03:04:02.480]  about you know just before all this stuff happened a story broke out about france while
[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:09.520]  hollander the french president the fact that he's spending 11 000 a month on his hair on his hair
[03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:16.240]  that's more than three times what the average french person makes uh each month okay he's
[03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:20.720]  spending that much just to have his hair done you know because he's worth it and it really is
[03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:25.280]  another classic socials with red carpets yeah everybody else's money never worked a day in
[03:04:25.280 --> 03:04:31.920]  his life bringing in the islamics and he's just a giant sack of you know what yeah it's irony
[03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:36.000]  that he did this on best deal day right we had marianne twinette say let them eat cake i guess
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:41.120]  she said he's saying uh let them eat pomade uh this is the arrogance that's gone full circle
[03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:44.320]  and so we're gonna talk about that when we come back i'm gonna come back i got a few more words
[03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:48.480]  i'm gonna hand the baton to david night and there's so much more but i tell you a great

[03:05:39.600 --> 03:05:45.440]  oppressors so why would you ask for a handout from someone you hate she don't care she's a queer

[03:08:26.640 --> 03:08:30.240]  and the media and the government aren't going to say it's part of islamic attack

[03:08:45.440 --> 03:08:54.800]  happening with islam um again i'm going to cleveland it's historic it's important there
[03:08:54.800 --> 03:08:58.960]  have been attempts they've tried to steal the delegates from trump they tried to sell it
[03:08:58.960 --> 03:09:05.600]  like it was a normal idea that failed it worked with hillary because of how sheep like their
[03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:11.200]  constituents are uh this governor pinch it's not the worst choice he's not the best choice
[03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:15.360]  way better than again rich but that isn't saying much he's kind of an establishment republican
[03:09:15.360 --> 03:09:21.200]  but good with the evangelicals supported naftan yet you name it i'm told you're gonna hear him
[03:09:21.200 --> 03:09:29.120]  recanting that explaining that he he has real positions the next day or two um 300 million
[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:32.880]  dollars a little bird told me it was first was 100 million then 200 million then 300 million
[03:09:33.680 --> 03:09:38.800]  300 million was offered a few days ago by adelson the middle he offered 100 million to trump um
[03:09:38.800 --> 03:09:44.560]  if he would take genrich and whereas i'm not against israel we shouldn't have israel running the
[03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:48.960]  president you know openly here and it's just financing and doing it i mean or the communist
[03:09:48.960 --> 03:09:54.720]  chinese or anybody else so that's what happened uh with that little that little situation there
[03:09:55.280 --> 03:10:00.560]  all i know is we're committed to this fight we've proven we're committed um i think everybody
[03:10:00.560 --> 03:10:05.520]  should just step back and realize how historic the info war is not from some perspective of
[03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:11.120]  power trip i'm a very humble person but all of you would really carried the ball over the goal
[03:10:11.120 --> 03:10:14.880]  line you have spread the word you have done the research you've taken the action our crew
[03:10:14.880 --> 03:10:21.760]  the supporters uh this is historic and so we've got to recognize just how important the info war
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:26.720]  is we've got to recognize how far we've come and how far we're going to go i'm not here just as a
[03:10:26.720 --> 03:10:32.960]  cheerleader just to be a cheerleader for cheerleader's sake i'm here to tell you resistance is victory
[03:10:32.960 --> 03:10:38.880]  knowing we carry the light of liberty in our hearts knowing that god's on our side knowing
[03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:44.000]  that for all of this country's problems we we were the greatest expression of the enlightenment
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:50.320]  and the renaissance and human empowerment and true liberalism and that we are countering a
[03:10:50.320 --> 03:10:55.600]  technocratic system that the globalists believe is going to save them being able to edit our post
[03:10:55.600 --> 03:11:01.920]  and block us and internet ids and what facebook and everybody are doing and controlling language
[03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:06.640]  and having them sell out corporate media never say a muslim's involved in a terror attack but
[03:11:06.640 --> 03:11:12.160]  that's only discrediting them and having everyone leave them so don't think they're the only power
[03:11:12.160 --> 03:11:18.640]  in the universe i've noticed that evil people sociopaths psychopaths control freaks they always
[03:11:19.200 --> 03:11:27.040]  think they're invincible they always are just just super confident they're also very fearful though
[03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:32.320]  of the general public but when it comes to their plans their megalomaniacs and so the wicked play
[03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:37.680]  with none pursue but also they think they're invincible at some point i get more humble as
[03:11:37.680 --> 03:11:44.320]  we become more effective as we change the narrative as we turn the tide and make no mistake info wars
[03:11:44.320 --> 03:11:49.200]  dot com drugs report dot com them there's not many other places that are able to really change the
[03:11:49.200 --> 03:11:55.840]  narrative uh get people thinking and and we're doing it more and more fox i talked to several fox
[03:11:55.840 --> 03:12:02.800]  news insiders last month i just wanted to get this out for our left town and it's not just gossip
[03:12:02.800 --> 03:12:07.680]  about fox it's it's it's part of what's happening in the season of evil and then i talked to some
[03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:10.800]  other folks about this morning and they could confirm when i was saying that you know there's
[03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:15.680]  this sexual harassment investigation of uh roger ailes that started modern talk radio and rush
[03:12:15.680 --> 03:12:22.480]  limbaugh and fox news 20 years ago limbaugh 30 years ago or 28 years ago whatever the numbers are
[03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:28.560]  and that that that that burdox kind of out of it now and that his kids are basically globalist
[03:12:28.560 --> 03:12:32.480]  quote liberals i mean look at their normal tv shows of course they are and that they're not just
[03:12:32.480 --> 03:12:36.720]  going to control conservatives now with fake conservative fox news they're getting ready
[03:12:36.720 --> 03:12:41.200]  in the very near future they've said this to go basically pro hillary pro new world order
[03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:45.760]  and hannity's going to be gone all of them because hannity's not going to play ball so much
[03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:54.880]  obviously people like uh people like uh oriley will but it just shows that even the old
[03:12:54.880 --> 03:13:00.080]  mainline republican guard uh who aren't perfect but weren't out to destroy the country and aren't
[03:13:00.080 --> 03:13:08.560]  communist they're gone ailes is being pushed out um big changes are happening the censorship is here
[03:13:08.560 --> 03:13:14.560]  like matt rudge said like a supreme court justice told him supreme court justices are dying uh i mean
[03:13:14.560 --> 03:13:23.360]  the enemy is moving is all i can tell you and it's a scary thought to look at the metrics and the
[03:13:23.360 --> 03:13:28.640]  numbers and i and i don't want to be arrogant about it because there's a prestige factor and
[03:13:28.640 --> 03:13:33.840]  all the big glitz and the glamour and all the shows together and people repeating it but to know
[03:13:33.840 --> 03:13:41.600]  that info wars and our platforms are overall reaching 30 40 percent maybe more of what fox
[03:13:41.600 --> 03:13:49.680]  news reaches and we're growing and they're going to decline you see the murdochs know that when
[03:13:49.680 --> 03:13:52.800]  they strangle fox news in the crib it's going to hurt their viewers they don't care they've got a
[03:13:52.800 --> 03:13:58.320]  larger mission they're partially owned by the soddies they're again merging with merging with
[03:13:58.320 --> 03:14:05.200]  the enemy but to know that the info wars and others are going to get that audience well the
[03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:09.200]  globalists aren't going to let that happen they're going to try to internet kill switch false flags
[03:14:09.200 --> 03:14:14.240]  censorship talk radio they're coming after drudge they're coming after world end daily
[03:14:14.240 --> 03:14:17.840]  they're coming after the daily caller and right bart not that any of us are perfect or have all
[03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:22.560]  the answers it's just that we're anti-globalist we're we're americana we believe in the second
[03:14:22.560 --> 03:14:27.280]  amendment we believe in pro-life we believe in sovereignty you know we believe the president
[03:14:27.280 --> 03:14:33.360]  isn't a god at least some of those websites like bright bar believe that when obama's in i mean i'll
[03:14:33.360 --> 03:14:39.280]  believe that if trump said or hillary it's just really big historic stuff's happening i i don't
[03:14:39.280 --> 03:14:47.360]  have words to describe how historic things are right now and we just have to be part of it and
[03:14:47.360 --> 03:14:51.840]  we have to be hard-nosed about it and just do what's right and not compromise and i'm telling you
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:14:58.080]  we'll come through this storm if we cower if we compromise if we give it in fear it's game over
[03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:07.360]  trump is a symbol of populism just like nigel forage was he had some people in his leadership
[03:15:07.360 --> 03:15:11.440]  that were you know like a pence character do we judge forage as he had some establishment guys
[03:15:11.440 --> 03:15:16.400]  in this campaign no i think we give trump some breathing room on this and as long as he delivers
[03:15:16.400 --> 03:15:21.360]  against political correctness gun grabbing open borders nafta and gat and things like that i
[03:15:21.360 --> 03:15:24.560]  i thought you know i was talking to folks the other day i said listen this pinch thing in that
[03:15:24.560 --> 03:15:30.480]  bad i expected more compromise you know even like reagan did but if he ever does something like back
[03:15:30.480 --> 03:15:35.840]  tpp or anything else that i will go for the impeachment of donald trump and the person said
[03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:40.320]  i will too absolutely so i think it comes down to that but but everything doesn't ride on trump
[03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:46.640]  but right now he's the carrier wave or the juggernaut ramming down the enemy fortress that
[03:15:46.640 --> 03:15:52.160]  we're going to pour in behind so if trumps using us we're using him and i think he knows that
[03:15:52.800 --> 03:15:57.200]  and i'm telling you he's smart he wouldn't be doing something this big with the rhetoric he's
[03:15:57.200 --> 03:16:01.360]  putting out if he wasn't trying to go all the way and wasn't the real deal because let me tell you
[03:16:01.360 --> 03:16:07.200]  you don't say the stuff he said put it back in the bottle he's done irrevocable harm to their system
[03:16:07.200 --> 03:16:11.840]  just as the brakes it has just as nigel forage has i mean you know that airplane somebody took
[03:16:11.840 --> 03:16:18.240]  control of it and flipped it tried to kill forage the pilots of vegetable i mean the focus this
[03:16:18.240 --> 03:16:21.840]  let me tell you there's a good chance you're going to see donald trump gun down and that's
[03:16:21.840 --> 03:16:25.440]  going to be the false flag to bring this whole country into marshal law there's so many angles
[03:16:25.440 --> 03:16:31.520]  right now so i'm going to sit back and watch but all i know is this we need your prayers we need
[03:16:31.520 --> 03:16:35.120]  your support we need you to spread the word and not take this broadcast for granted i know you're

[03:17:42.080 --> 03:17:50.960]  renaissance we already had the the success we're trying to simply restore free will and and let
[03:17:50.960 --> 03:17:58.400]  people know what real freedom is and to take the blinders off but it takes energy and what is money
[03:17:58.400 --> 03:18:03.600]  what is money money is a symbol of energy of work you've done that you send us and then we

[03:19:04.560 --> 03:19:10.160]  that's absolutely right uh you know when we look at the solutions that hillary is offering us in
[03:19:10.160 --> 03:19:15.520]  the wake of this she's come out before saying that every time there's a terrorist attack
[03:19:15.520 --> 03:19:21.280]  she wants to step up the surveillance state and she's come back to say that again she's now saying
[03:19:21.280 --> 03:19:26.480]  well we need an intelligence surge i think that's a good description of what happened with her
[03:19:26.480 --> 03:19:31.840]  private email server it was an intelligence surge for the other side that's where we saw the
[03:19:31.840 --> 03:19:36.880]  intelligence surging out of this country now when we come back i'm going to talk about what
[03:19:36.880 --> 03:19:42.160]  happened in france in light of the french revolution you know they were selling celebrating a
[03:19:42.160 --> 03:19:47.360]  bastille day and i think there's a lesson to be learned from the arrogance of france's president

[03:24:08.960 --> 03:24:15.440]  david night your host the rest of this hour this fourth hour you know we've seen now hillary clinton's
[03:24:16.480 --> 03:24:22.640]  response to all this and it's that she thinks that we need an intelligence surge as i said before
[03:24:23.600 --> 03:24:29.760]  that's what we've seen with her every time we have an attack remember back in march i think it was
[03:24:29.760 --> 03:24:34.080]  the brussels attacks okay she called for more surveillance then you go back and look at every
[03:24:34.080 --> 03:24:39.360]  time there's an attack she wants to increase the police state the surveillance state that's her
[03:24:39.360 --> 03:24:46.000]  response to everything and of course where is where is the press pointing out the hypocrisy
[03:24:46.560 --> 03:24:51.680]  of this person saying well you know we need to have more intelligence we need to be smarter
[03:24:51.680 --> 03:24:57.440]  in the way we approach this where they have this is the person who put the most highly classified
[03:24:57.440 --> 03:25:04.400]  documents in our government on display for everyone to get in her unsecure private server
[03:25:04.960 --> 03:25:10.800]  and of course that's had a a real cost for her it's been pointed out in this ap story
[03:25:11.360 --> 03:25:15.600]  hillary clinton enters a summer damage by perception she violated the law by using a
[03:25:15.600 --> 03:25:22.560]  private email system perceptions it's not perceptions ap that was the profession of the
[03:25:22.560 --> 03:25:29.520]  fbi director okay and as one guy says later on in that same story uh they talked to a 57-year-old
[03:25:29.520 --> 03:25:34.080]  republican he says well she's innocent until proven guilty but to me the fbi director called
[03:25:34.080 --> 03:25:40.240]  her guilty and then gave her a pass that's exactly how that's that was my reaction to when i was
[03:25:40.240 --> 03:25:44.640]  watching it with my wife i said i can't believe this i didn't think he was going to do anything
[03:25:44.640 --> 03:25:50.160]  to hillary and here he is he's admitting that she committed hundreds of felony charges here
[03:25:50.160 --> 03:25:56.640]  that she sent and received classified emails on her personal server and then he goes on to say well
[03:25:56.640 --> 03:26:02.400]  uh that's okay we're not nobody in their right mind would would prosecute her because you know
[03:26:02.400 --> 03:26:06.160]  she's a clinton and we know what happens to people when you come after clinton's right
[03:26:06.720 --> 03:26:12.160]  but uh then he goes on to say uh don't you try this at home and you know what uh this is the problem
[03:26:13.360 --> 03:26:16.880]  they say that on the hill they say democrats are freaked out about these polls and private
[03:26:16.880 --> 03:26:21.760]  meetings we've heard in the past a couple of weeks you know this is the the never trump narrative
[03:26:21.760 --> 03:26:26.240]  they were all saying wow you know we just got to get uh donald trump out of the uh
[03:26:27.040 --> 03:26:30.480]  we can't have him be the nominee because it's just going to destroy our senate candidates
[03:26:30.480 --> 03:26:35.840]  is going to destroy us down ballot and now the democrats are saying this the hill says nervous
[03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:41.200]  senate democrats raised concerns with hillary clinton during a private meeting on the capital
[03:26:41.200 --> 03:26:46.880]  yesterday over recent polls showing donald trump leading her tide in several battleground states it
[03:26:46.880 --> 03:26:51.600]  said some people were freaked out they were looking down at the polls on real real clear
[03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:58.000]  politics and asking why it was so close she said well you know there's other issues uh people are
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:04.480]  unhappy and they don't trust institutions hillary clinton is a very embodiment of our political
[03:27:04.480 --> 03:27:10.240]  institutions she's a very embodiment of corrupt political institutions that have come to be the
[03:27:10.240 --> 03:27:15.920]  hallmark of the american government for example one of these battleground states is uh of florida
[03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:21.840]  and they had a quintipiac poll uh that was just done showed her behind by four points
[03:27:21.840 --> 03:27:28.560]  in florida to donald trump now just last month she was ahead by eight points and that's a key
[03:27:28.560 --> 03:27:33.600]  state there are certain states that are going to definitely go republican certain states are
[03:27:33.600 --> 03:27:38.800]  definitely going to go democrat they're just that's just baked into the way those uh states are
[03:27:38.800 --> 03:27:43.600]  are but then of course there are states that can go either way that have large numbers of delegates
[03:27:44.240 --> 03:27:49.520]  states like florida ohio pennsylvania where she is not doing well and she's not doing well
[03:27:49.520 --> 03:27:56.400]  nationally uh because of this hypocrisy but again an intelligence surge talking about how we need
[03:27:56.400 --> 03:28:01.360]  to work with nato that was another thing she said yesterday uh maybe somebody should explain to her
[03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:08.960]  what the purpose of nato is nato was an north atlantic treaty organization uh their stated purpose
[03:28:08.960 --> 03:28:14.160]  was to address the threat of the russian communists it's one of the reasons why donald trump says
[03:28:14.160 --> 03:28:18.560]  they're obsolete they're trying to invent a new mission for themselves and of course uh when
[03:28:18.560 --> 03:28:24.480]  things get really tough uh we've we've seen in the past that nato was involved in uh the operation
[03:28:24.480 --> 03:28:31.680]  gladio in idly posing as red brigade terrorist kidnapping the italian prime minister al domo
[03:28:31.680 --> 03:28:38.400]  executing him eventually okay those were nato undercover people grabbing arms that were placed
[03:28:38.400 --> 03:28:44.560]  behind in case uh western europe was overrun by a rapid blitzkrieg like a soviet invasion
[03:28:44.560 --> 03:28:50.240]  that never happened but when they saw uh the communists moving up in the polls in idly
[03:28:50.240 --> 03:28:55.280]  uh they started doing their own false flag terrorist attacks it was gladio you can look
[03:28:55.280 --> 03:28:59.600]  it up it's a matter of record it's not talked about much in the united states but it's very
[03:28:59.600 --> 03:29:05.440]  well known in idly they did an investigation and they weren't going to cover this up after a popular
[03:29:05.440 --> 03:29:11.200]  prime minister was kidnapped and killed so uh yeah nato's got a function and uh but that's not
[03:29:11.200 --> 03:29:17.680]  really uh what who we need to work with i'm surprised you didn't say that uh uh that we need to um
[03:29:17.680 --> 03:29:24.720]  um uh ask nato what to do because that's what leon panetta uh the secretary defense the ci
[03:29:24.720 --> 03:29:29.200]  e director that was put in by uh obama that's what he said in that famous exchange with
[03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:34.320]  senator sessions going back and forth said well we'd talk to nato we'd talk to the un we'd talk
[03:29:34.320 --> 03:29:39.520]  to our other allies and senator session says well you would get a vote from congress before you
[03:29:39.520 --> 03:29:43.520]  would commit troops right now i don't think so stay with us we'll come back we're going to talk
[03:29:43.520 --> 03:29:48.560]  about what was behind the bastille day the arrogance and the corruption of the french
[03:29:48.560 --> 03:29:55.600]  government and the open borders on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[03:29:55.600 --> 03:30:06.000]  network white people get ready to write checks and give up your car keys black lives matter
[03:30:06.000 --> 03:30:12.400]  organizer ashley shackleford wants reparations from all white people for 400 years of slavery
[03:30:12.400 --> 03:30:18.960]  when only 1.4 percent of whites owned slaves at the height of slavery check out this quote from

[03:30:25.760 --> 03:30:32.000]  a job with benefits run me those Beyonce tickets wait what is that a mooching mentality of an
[03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:37.280]  entitled millennial disguising their intentions as social activism not very well i might add
[03:30:37.280 --> 03:30:42.480]  furthermore shackleford sees all whites as oppressors so why would you ask for a handout from
[03:30:42.480 --> 03:30:49.040]  someone you hate she don't care she's a queer non-binary black fat fem who gets off on the

[03:34:46.960 --> 03:34:52.480]  now it's talking just before the break about hillary and her solution is more intelligence but
[03:34:52.480 --> 03:34:56.240]  maybe we need to have some more intelligence about what's going on really at the borders you
[03:34:56.240 --> 03:35:01.760]  know clinton has said that she wants to resettle essentially one million muslim migrants during
[03:35:01.760 --> 03:35:08.800]  her first term this is a math done by breitbart they say between 2001 and 2013 it's a 12 year
[03:35:08.800 --> 03:35:13.600]  period the u.s permanently resettled one and a half million muslim migrants on green cards
[03:35:13.600 --> 03:35:19.760]  however under hillary clinton's stated proposals muslim immigration would grow substantially
[03:35:19.760 --> 03:35:25.840]  faster adding nearly one million muslim migrants into the u.s during her first term alone so in
[03:35:25.840 --> 03:35:32.240]  other words three times faster than it's been going on in the last 12 years now you say well i
[03:35:32.240 --> 03:35:36.240]  don't know if it if she would speed it up if she'd be able to speed it up that much well you
[03:35:36.240 --> 03:35:44.000]  realize this john carrey was bragging on wednesday the day before this happened uh in nice france
[03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:49.760]  the day before this terrorist event happened yesterday so two days ago john carrey was bragging
[03:35:49.760 --> 03:35:57.200]  that he had increased muslim immigration by six fold six fold and so what breitbart is saying is
[03:35:57.200 --> 03:36:01.920]  that hillary clinton will increase it by at least three fold i think that's a very conservative
[03:36:01.920 --> 03:36:05.280]  estimate as alex was saying earlier you know when they tell you that they're bringing in 10 000 no
[03:36:05.280 --> 03:36:09.040]  it's a lot more than that that's just what they're telling you they're bringing in now this is what
[03:36:09.040 --> 03:36:14.320]  john carrey said the day before this terrorist attack yesterday he said the obama administration
[03:36:14.320 --> 03:36:21.040]  will meet its target of settling 10 000 syrians in the u.s by the time fiscal year 2016 ends on
[03:36:21.040 --> 03:36:28.960]  september 30th now he announced this the night before at an end of ramadan reception at the
[03:36:28.960 --> 03:36:34.240]  state department an end of ramadan reception he comes out and he says great we're going to bring
[03:36:34.240 --> 03:36:39.600]  10 000 more of you in here okay and he says this is a different kind of immigration this is refugee
[03:36:39.600 --> 03:36:44.960]  immigration he says it's different from the normal process of migration it's not green cards because
[03:36:44.960 --> 03:36:51.600]  i just read you the statistic about green cards okay that was uh one and a half million coming
[03:36:51.600 --> 03:36:58.560]  in on green cards in 12 years ending in 2013 but he says no this is different from the normal
[03:36:58.560 --> 03:37:03.440]  process of immigration it's different from green cards and becoming a citizen and so forth that's
[03:37:03.440 --> 03:37:07.680]  what he said he says it's a very different category here's his quote it's different from a normal
[03:37:07.680 --> 03:37:12.480]  process of migration green card and becoming a citizen and so forth it's a very different
[03:37:12.480 --> 03:37:18.800]  category said carrey he also said uh it's representing a six-fold increase over what
[03:37:18.800 --> 03:37:24.320]  we did the year before he's so happy six times the number of muslims how many of these people
[03:37:25.280 --> 03:37:31.200]  have they been able to vet okay let's do a little bit of math okay from our brilliant politicians
[03:37:31.200 --> 03:37:37.440]  and you need to understand this as well we bring in a million people and only one percent of them
[03:37:37.440 --> 03:37:45.680]  are terrorists how many terrorists have we brought in 10 000 10 000 people like that guy yesterday
[03:37:45.680 --> 03:37:50.960]  you want 10 000 people like that in the united states you know most of these people coming in
[03:37:51.520 --> 03:37:57.200]  are young healthy strong that's what they were saying in the town where george cloney has his
[03:37:57.200 --> 03:38:02.240]  italian mansion they said well you know we don't mind helping people but these guys coming in here
[03:38:02.240 --> 03:38:06.480]  they don't want to do any work and they're they're big and strong they're not they don't look like
[03:38:06.480 --> 03:38:11.040]  refugees you know it's not really families that are coming in these are big strong guys coming in
[03:38:11.600 --> 03:38:18.400]  you have to understand this is an army that they're bringing in this is a deliberate design of
[03:38:18.400 --> 03:38:24.080]  chaos that they're bringing in and when we look at these things these are simply statistics remember
[03:38:24.080 --> 03:38:30.640]  what stalin said he said one death is a tragedy but a million deaths is a statistic well you know
[03:38:30.640 --> 03:38:35.200]  a million migrants coming in who are going to kill you is just a statistic right let's look at
[03:38:35.200 --> 03:38:39.520]  some of the specifics about the people who died because these are personal stories and as i read
[03:38:39.520 --> 03:38:44.880]  these stories i want you to think about your future your family's future are you going to be killed
[03:38:45.440 --> 03:38:52.000]  in a terrorist attack by maybe you know one percent or even one half a percent okay even
[03:38:52.000 --> 03:38:57.040]  even if they took it down to one tenth of a percent let's say they got they vetted these
[03:38:57.040 --> 03:39:00.400]  people and they admit they're not vetting them at all they're not vetting them at all they're
[03:39:00.400 --> 03:39:04.800]  not even making an attempt they don't even know how they would do that okay they don't
[03:39:04.800 --> 03:39:08.560]  know or care who these people are they're just bringing them in and calling them refugees
[03:39:08.560 --> 03:39:14.080]  first they go to their country drop bombs kill people do assassinations blow up families
[03:39:14.080 --> 03:39:18.480]  get the people good and angry and they say come on let's send your young man over here
[03:39:18.480 --> 03:39:23.120]  military age come on over we'll call you refugees i mean what could possibly go wrong
[03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:29.360]  they know what's going to go wrong that's why they're doing it they've been creating wars
[03:39:29.360 --> 03:39:37.200]  in countries across this across the world long before i was born they'll go into a country
[03:39:37.760 --> 03:39:43.760]  and they will arm both sides in the war we're saying that happened in Syria we see it happen in
[03:39:43.760 --> 03:39:49.200]  all these different places throughout the middle east other places as well understand the people
[03:39:49.200 --> 03:39:54.640]  who have been doing this throughout the world are now going to be doing it here in America
[03:39:54.640 --> 03:40:01.040]  arming both sides creating a conflict for their own purposes to serve their own interests so as
[03:40:01.040 --> 03:40:07.920]  you hear that a texan and his 11 year old son were on a family vacation they decide they would go
[03:40:07.920 --> 03:40:14.240]  to the riviera they would take a european vacation to the riviera and they were one some of the people
[03:40:14.240 --> 03:40:20.640]  who were killed yesterday is that going to be you is that going to be your family more specifically
[03:40:20.640 --> 03:40:25.760]  let's go back to the batiklin massacre where they went in and attacked that movie theater
[03:40:26.800 --> 03:40:35.680]  this is an exclusive from heat street and they have testimony here from investigators and the
[03:40:35.680 --> 03:40:41.120]  commission of inquiry in france and what it shows here is that the french government
[03:40:41.760 --> 03:40:49.280]  suppressed news that there was torture in that massacre and that uh in that concert this is a
[03:40:49.280 --> 03:40:55.360]  story that i think is uh up on drudge report a french government committee has heard testimony
[03:40:55.360 --> 03:41:00.320]  suppressed by the french government at the time not released to the media that the killers in the
[03:41:00.320 --> 03:41:08.560]  batiklin tortured their victims on the second floor of the club wahhabist killers wahhabists the
[03:41:08.560 --> 03:41:16.160]  saudis okay and today we just had the we had the 28 pages declassified and guess what i haven't
[03:41:16.160 --> 03:41:21.760]  had a chance to read this but it's no surprise as i was told when they handed me this article
[03:41:21.760 --> 03:41:27.200]  that it has a prince bandar featured in there prominently you know our ally prince bandar
[03:41:27.200 --> 03:41:34.160]  the you know the guy who is an honorary cia member this these are the people that we have
[03:41:34.160 --> 03:41:39.200]  allied with these are the people who created the petro dollar with us you know when nixon
[03:41:39.200 --> 03:41:44.000]  and kissinger took us off the gold standard with britain woods too they immediately said well you
[03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:48.560]  know we gotta have uh something to make the currency valuable we're not connecting it to
[03:41:48.560 --> 03:41:52.560]  gold anymore the whole world had seen through the fraud they were printing so much paper there
[03:41:52.560 --> 03:41:56.400]  wasn't any way they had the the gold to back it so they just said all right we're gonna get rid of
[03:41:56.400 --> 03:42:00.560]  that pretense but we're going to come up with a different idea we're going to back our currency
[03:42:01.760 --> 03:42:07.680]  by having saudi arabia denominate oil and american dollars we're going to make we're
[03:42:07.680 --> 03:42:12.080]  going to work with saudi arabia of course they're going to buy our worthless treasury bills
[03:42:13.600 --> 03:42:17.440]  give them value they're going to buy a lot of our treasury bills we're going to make them
[03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:24.800]  unbelievably rich and then we will also arm these people and they will support us by making our
[03:42:24.800 --> 03:42:30.400]  our fiat currency the world reserve currency and so we've been working with these wahhabist
[03:42:30.400 --> 03:42:37.280]  killers in saudi arabia we created them and we are they are business partners with the cia
[03:42:38.000 --> 03:42:43.760]  and they didn't want this information to get out in the 9-11 report but that's what's happening
[03:42:43.760 --> 03:42:47.200]  but let me tell you what the other wahhabist killers did because you know saudi arabia
[03:42:47.920 --> 03:42:52.160]  beheads more people than ices does in their own country under sharia law but let's look
[03:42:52.160 --> 03:42:56.480]  at what the wahhabist killers did in the body clown they say they apparently gouged out eyes
[03:42:57.520 --> 03:43:03.120]  they castrated victims they shoved their testicles in their mouths they may have disemboweled some
[03:43:03.120 --> 03:43:09.760]  poor souls women were stabbed in their genitals all the torture was victims toll police filmed
[03:43:10.640 --> 03:43:16.320]  for daesh or the islamic state propaganda for that reason medics did not release the bodies of
[03:43:16.320 --> 03:43:22.640]  torture victims to the families said investigators but prosecutors what did they tell the public in
[03:43:22.640 --> 03:43:30.000]  the media the french government said uh these were just a rumor they said uh they said well you
[03:43:30.000 --> 03:43:34.000]  know we found some sharp knives there but it was just a rumor it was shrapnel that caused all these
[03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:39.600]  injuries now here's some of the testimony i want you to hear this because i want you to understand
[03:43:39.600 --> 03:43:47.200]  that if we do not stop hillary clinton and john carrey and this policy of bringing war
[03:43:47.760 --> 03:43:52.800]  into the united states by bringing in these shihadi terrorists and as i said before
[03:43:52.800 --> 03:43:56.960]  you only got one percent of the million that hillary clinton wants to bring in just in four years
[03:43:57.520 --> 03:44:02.720]  okay that's 10 000 of these people let's take it down to a tenth of that okay let's say that
[03:44:02.720 --> 03:44:11.440]  they're 99.9 percent vetted okay that 99.9 of these people are fine but we get one tenth of one
[03:44:11.440 --> 03:44:17.120]  percent that's a thousand of these people what did they do what did they do i want you to think
[03:44:17.120 --> 03:44:23.360]  about this this is your future this is the future of you of your children of your grandchildren
[03:44:24.000 --> 03:44:32.080]  if you don't stop this i don't care if they call me a racist xenophobe who is a religious
[03:44:32.080 --> 03:44:37.200]  bigot i want to tell you what these people did and why they need to have extra special
[03:44:37.200 --> 03:44:41.040]  permission to come here from certain countries and i think we need to get out of their countries
[03:44:41.040 --> 03:44:45.840]  and stop killing them as well okay we need to get some of these people that are in washington
[03:44:45.840 --> 03:44:50.880]  out right now but here's what these wahhabis did here's a question this is for the information
[03:44:50.880 --> 03:44:55.600]  the commission inquiry they said can you tell us they're talking to one of the investigators
[03:44:55.600 --> 03:44:59.360]  how you learned that there had been acts of barbarism within the batter clan
[03:44:59.360 --> 03:45:04.400]  beheadings eviscerations eyes gouged out and the investigator said well after the assault we were
[03:45:04.400 --> 03:45:09.120]  with the colleagues at the passage st pierre amalot when i saw it weeping from one of the
[03:45:09.120 --> 03:45:16.240]  colleagues who came outside to vomit and he told me what he had seen and he says acts of torture
[03:45:16.240 --> 03:45:21.040]  happened on the second floor and he said bodies have not been presented to families because
[03:45:21.600 --> 03:45:27.280]  there were beheaded people there the murdered people people who had been disemboweled there
[03:45:27.280 --> 03:45:31.840]  were women who had had their genitals stabbed and he said all of this would have been videotaped
[03:45:31.840 --> 03:45:38.480]  for daish and he says i believe so survivors have said so elsewhere the investigator says
[03:45:38.480 --> 03:45:43.920]  women were sexually tortured stabbed in their genitals their eyes were plucked out people were
[03:45:43.920 --> 03:45:49.600]  decapitated the committee chief pressed the investigator and whether the victims were
[03:45:49.600 --> 03:45:54.160]  decapitated or mutilated he stayed the authorities had given out conflicting information that said
[03:45:54.160 --> 03:46:00.320]  the victims were merely shot or blown up the president of the committee replied with this
[03:46:00.320 --> 03:46:05.120]  damning statement about one victim's father discovering the gruesome truth and there more
[03:46:05.840 --> 03:46:10.240]  okay here's your here's your tragedy folks this is a tragedy that awaits for you
[03:46:10.240 --> 03:46:17.280]  if you simply think that hillary clinton's one million migrants are helpless people who need
[03:46:17.280 --> 03:46:22.880]  to come in here and it's simply a statistic this is what the father said when he saw his son
[03:46:22.880 --> 03:46:28.640]  in the morgue on the causes of the death of my son at the forensic institute in paris i was told
[03:46:29.200 --> 03:46:33.760]  and what a shock it was for me at that moment that they had cut off his testicles had put them
[03:46:33.760 --> 03:46:39.760]  in his mouth and he was disemboweled when i saw him behind the glass lying on the table a white
[03:46:39.760 --> 03:46:44.720]  shroud covering it up to the neck a psychologist was with me and he said this is the only
[03:46:44.720 --> 03:46:51.360]  presentable part of your son's left profile i found he had no right eye i made the remark
[03:46:51.360 --> 03:46:57.120]  i was informed that they had punctured his eye and sliced down the right side of his face
[03:46:57.760 --> 03:47:04.000]  where there was a very large hematoma that we could all see this is the hatred that has
[03:47:04.000 --> 03:47:10.560]  been carefully cultivated by the cia and our american policy being brought home to our country
[03:47:10.560 --> 03:47:21.360]  without your consent in spite of the law without any vetting this is the policy of hillary clinton
[03:47:21.360 --> 03:47:24.400]  this is what is going to happen in america that's a heat street exclusive
[03:47:25.760 --> 03:47:30.400]  along with other personal stories the motorcyclist who was crushed to death trying to stop the
[03:47:30.400 --> 03:47:34.960]  killer truck a german journalist who witnessed the niece attack said he saw a motorcyclist
[03:47:34.960 --> 03:47:41.200]  chasing the killer truck the killer truck okay this is a killer truck again this is afp they can't
[03:47:41.200 --> 03:47:47.840]  say the islamic terrorist it was a killer truck that he was chasing and tried to enter the cabin
[03:47:47.840 --> 03:47:52.640]  but fall but fell and ended up ended up under the wheels the german journalist said i stood on the
[03:47:52.640 --> 03:47:57.360]  balcony and suddenly a truck drove through the crowd surprisingly he was driving very slowly not
[03:47:57.360 --> 03:48:02.960]  fast he drove slowly and he was being chased by a motorcyclist the cyclist attempted to overtake
[03:48:02.960 --> 03:48:08.800]  the truck and even tried to open the driver's door but he fell and he ended up under the wheels of
[03:48:08.800 --> 03:48:17.360]  the truck and then he said he saw police officers open fire i tweeted this out last night and i said
[03:48:17.360 --> 03:48:21.040]  i guess they will be saying that we need to have a ban on fully automatic trucks
[03:48:22.560 --> 03:48:28.880]  and they came pretty close blaming it on the trucks and not islam and i also said that when
[03:48:28.880 --> 03:48:36.080]  they find this person they will call him a frenchman not a muslim and they came pretty close to that
[03:48:36.080 --> 03:48:43.520]  as well they call him now a french tunisian except that he's not really a citizen the first papers
[03:48:43.520 --> 03:48:48.480]  that they showed of this guy showed that he has a temporary residence that he's just recently come
[03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:54.400]  over from tunisia but they will do anything that they can to put this out there to blame it on the
[03:48:54.400 --> 03:49:01.280]  truck for example you know it was back in 2006 this happened very close to my home we used to live
[03:49:01.280 --> 03:49:07.600]  not too far outside of chapel hill north carolina university at north carolina chapel hill a very
[03:49:07.600 --> 03:49:14.400]  very political politically correct liberal institution i remember right after 2011 when
[03:49:14.400 --> 03:49:19.680]  the official story was we've been attacked by islamic terrorists their response was to have
[03:49:19.680 --> 03:49:27.840]  all incoming freshmen be required freshmen be required to read the quran that's unc chapel hill
[03:49:28.560 --> 03:49:34.800]  now five years later they had uh muhammad reza tahiri azar an iranian american
[03:49:35.440 --> 03:49:40.480]  intentionally as he later confessed hit people with a sports utility vehicle on the campus of
[03:49:40.480 --> 03:49:48.160]  unc at chapel hill to avenge this is what he said to quote avenge the deaths of muslims worldwide
[03:49:48.160 --> 03:49:53.600]  and to punish the united states government no one was killed in the attack nine people were
[03:49:53.600 --> 03:49:59.840]  entered injured none seriously so he was incompetent in what he did unlike this guy yesterday he
[03:49:59.840 --> 03:50:03.680]  turned himself in he was arrested he wrote in a letter i was aiming to follow in the footsteps
[03:50:03.680 --> 03:50:09.440]  of one of my role models muhammad atto one of the 911 hijackers who obtained a doctorate degree he
[03:50:09.440 --> 03:50:14.880]  said now they had a debate and i remember that when this happened there was a lot of back and forth
[03:50:14.880 --> 03:50:20.320]  because you know of course this is unc chapel hill this is the liberals they just cannot bring it
[03:50:21.040 --> 03:50:27.520]  on themselves to acknowledge this even when the guy says this even when he says he did it
[03:50:28.160 --> 03:50:33.600]  because he wants to avenge the deaths of muslims and he wants to punish americans they can't call
[03:50:33.600 --> 03:50:38.320]  it an act of terrorism they had a debate as to whether or not it was an act of terrorism unc
[03:50:38.320 --> 03:50:44.000]  chancellor james mosler i think is his name stopped short of calling it a full-fledged
[03:50:44.000 --> 03:50:48.320]  act of terror just can't say it just can't say it it's like facebook he's got a block
[03:50:48.320 --> 03:50:52.480]  i can't say that a muslim created a did an act of terror even when he said he did
[03:50:52.480 --> 03:50:54.880]  stay with us be right back we're going to look at the french revolution

[03:54:11.840 --> 03:54:17.040]  here i want to talk about what's going on globally as represented by the french government in the
[03:54:17.040 --> 03:54:22.640]  background of bastille day of course we have the drudge report link to paul joseph watson's article
[03:54:22.640 --> 03:54:29.360]  media blames a truck and not terrorists or islam for the nisa tech uh you know i guess maybe we're
[03:54:29.360 --> 03:54:33.680]  going to have a no drive list and that's what i was saying uh i tweeted out i said well they're
[03:54:33.680 --> 03:54:39.120]  going to ban uh fully automatic trucks and some kind of came back at me and he goes you guys sound
[03:54:39.120 --> 03:54:44.400]  like a bunch of ignorant stupid cavemen guns whoa whoa and i said well you realize of course
[03:54:44.400 --> 03:54:52.080]  that uh the attack ended when somebody used a gun on him it was the police because in a slave
[03:54:52.080 --> 03:54:58.080]  country like france only the police are allowed to defend against something like that that's why it
[03:54:58.080 --> 03:55:03.120]  went for over a mile because nobody else could fight back effectively see that the guy tried
[03:55:03.120 --> 03:55:08.400]  to run up there with his motorcycle and stopped this but he couldn't and so you know we look at
[03:55:08.400 --> 03:55:16.640]  this and uh we can't watch the borders okay we can't take somebody who has had convictions criminal
[03:55:16.640 --> 03:55:20.320]  convictions like many of these terrorists once they're in the city well it's there in the country
[03:55:20.320 --> 03:55:25.520]  we can't uh deport them we can't have a first strike your out policy no we can't vetting these
[03:55:25.520 --> 03:55:30.400]  people we can't throw them out if they come here and they're criminals and then when this happens
[03:55:30.400 --> 03:55:34.960]  we have the media covering for it as watson points out we got the headline from cnn truck
[03:55:34.960 --> 03:55:42.320]  rams a crowd or the new york times truck attack on french crowd cm cbc news says children feared
[03:55:42.880 --> 03:55:48.640]  killed and niece as truck attacks a family event the truck attack instructed it okay they want to
[03:55:48.640 --> 03:55:53.360]  make it all about the truck except you know when a car really does kill people like with a tesla
[03:55:53.360 --> 03:55:59.200]  autopilot then they blame the people okay that's the insanity of this but before i run out of time
[03:55:59.200 --> 03:56:05.040]  okay this french president just hours before this happened it came out that he spends eleven
[03:56:05.040 --> 03:56:09.440]  thousand dollars a month on his hair eleven thousand dollars a month the this is usa today
[03:56:09.440 --> 03:56:14.880]  these socialist leaders personal stylist earned eleven thousand dollars a month now per capita
[03:56:14.880 --> 03:56:19.440]  income in france is less than thirty five hundred a month so he's making three times
[03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:25.440]  what the workers make the workers i thought the socialists cared about the workers okay
[03:56:25.440 --> 03:56:31.360]  okay he's got a five-year contract with his hairstylist that began in 2012 by 2017 the french
[03:56:31.360 --> 03:56:35.680]  president will have shelled out six hundred fifty seven thousand dollars you know because he's
[03:56:35.680 --> 03:56:40.880]  worth it he's worth it now remember marie entoinette that's what they were celebrating you know best
[03:56:40.880 --> 03:56:45.680]  deal day that was where we're told you know they all the liberty loving people in france
[03:56:45.680 --> 03:56:50.800]  uh spontaneously rose up against the tyrannical king this is the way uh new american puts it
[03:56:50.800 --> 03:56:56.640]  took out his haughty wife who said uh let them eat cake now we've got a socialist president
[03:56:56.640 --> 03:57:03.280]  who essentially says let them eat pomade that's what's going on here so what they were celebrating
[03:57:03.280 --> 03:57:06.800]  yesterday was the fact that they stormed the prison the Bastille they took it down and then
[03:57:06.800 --> 03:57:12.400]  of course you had a reign of terror didn't you uh they and they point out here the french revolution
[03:57:12.400 --> 03:57:18.160]  was not really a liberty loving thing but actually the fruit of decades of radical agitation sound
[03:57:18.160 --> 03:57:24.400]  familiar stirred up by anti-christian power-seeking secret societies that drank freely from the
[03:57:24.400 --> 03:57:29.760]  poison well of the enlightenment it has served as a template for every radical leftist revolution
[03:57:29.760 --> 03:57:36.080]  since that time now it's come full circle hasn't it now we've got the arrogant socialist who is
[03:57:36.080 --> 03:57:41.200]  fawning over his hair spending three times per capita income on his hair and the guy's losing
[03:57:41.200 --> 03:57:46.800]  it like me okay i'm not spending that kind of money on my hair uh with radical agitation we see
[03:57:46.800 --> 03:57:51.840]  that as well that's their open borders with policy from secret societies they're the people who put
[03:57:51.840 --> 03:57:56.400]  this stuff together and we look at the uh article he comes out after this and says well you know
[03:57:56.400 --> 03:58:00.400]  france uh you go ahead to learn to live with terrorism you know i think we need to do something
[03:58:00.400 --> 03:58:06.320]  about it they say france is investigating whether a truck attacker act alone you know the uh the
[03:58:06.320 --> 03:58:12.720]  point is he didn't act alone he had the cooperation of hollanda of merkel of the european union of
[03:58:12.720 --> 03:58:19.600]  obama clinton john carrey they're his associates they're the people who brought them in who are
[03:58:19.600 --> 03:58:26.240]  bringing them in by the millions and we don't know how many is it a thousand is it ten thousand
