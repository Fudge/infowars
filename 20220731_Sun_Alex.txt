[00:00.000 --> 00:27.480]  Hey Alexa, where did Joe Biden fall off his cycle?
[00:27.480 --> 00:32.520]  Joe Biden died in National Naval Medical Center.
[00:32.520 --> 00:37.360]  I could spend the next hour on an 11 minute speech Biden put out from the White House
[00:37.360 --> 00:38.360]  officially.
[00:38.360 --> 00:40.360]  People thought it was a deep fake and they went and checked it.
[00:40.360 --> 00:44.120]  No, it's on the White House website, completely insane.
[00:44.120 --> 00:46.920]  In 11 minutes, he blinks six times.
[00:46.920 --> 00:48.960]  Let me close with this.
[00:48.960 --> 00:52.480]  Every day we rely on law enforcement to save lives.
[00:52.480 --> 00:57.880]  Even on January 6th, we relied on law enforcement to save our democracy.
[00:57.880 --> 00:59.640]  We saw what happened.
[00:59.640 --> 01:05.920]  The Capitol Police, the DC Metropolitan Police, other law enforcement agencies were attacked
[01:05.920 --> 01:13.960]  and assaulted before our very eyes, speared, sprayed, stomped on, brutalized, and lives
[01:13.960 --> 01:15.960]  were lost.
[01:15.960 --> 01:22.080]  For three hours, the defeated former president of the United States watched it all happen
[01:22.080 --> 01:26.600]  as he sat in the comfort of the private dining room next to the Oval Office.
[01:26.600 --> 01:31.880]  While he was doing that, brave law enforcement officers were subject to the medieval hell
[01:31.880 --> 01:38.840]  for three hours, dripping in blood surrounded by carnage, face to face with crazed mob that
[01:38.840 --> 01:41.960]  believed the lies that would defeat a president.
[01:41.960 --> 01:44.480]  The police were heroes that day.
[01:44.480 --> 01:48.000]  Donald Trump lacked the courage to act.
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.280]  The brave women and men in blue all across this nation should never forget that.
[01:54.280 --> 01:57.120]  You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-cop.
[01:57.120 --> 01:59.760]  You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy.
[01:59.760 --> 02:02.760]  You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-American.
[02:02.760 --> 02:08.960]  I mean, he looks like an animatronic robot at Chuck E. Cheese or something.
[02:08.960 --> 02:13.320]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this looks like the intro to a horror movie or something where
[02:13.320 --> 02:25.800]  body snatchers have taken over.
[02:25.800 --> 02:29.680]  This happens in human civilization, it normally collapses civilization for at least a time
[02:29.680 --> 02:32.360]  when the good people at Craze is getting charged.
[02:32.360 --> 02:37.280]  Why is the Biden administration building a border wall in Arizona?
[02:37.280 --> 02:42.680]  So we are not finishing the wall.
[02:42.680 --> 02:49.360]  We are cleaning up the mess, the prior administration left behind in their failed attempt to build
[02:49.360 --> 02:50.360]  a wall.
[02:50.360 --> 02:54.720]  Of course, the more pain we are all experiencing from the high price of gas, the more benefit
[02:54.720 --> 02:57.160]  there is for those who can access electric vehicles.
[02:57.160 --> 02:58.160]  We let them be in control.
[02:58.160 --> 03:03.400]  Mr. Biden, are you still groping Senators Children's, Creepy Joe Biden?
[03:03.400 --> 03:07.560]  They always start assaulting reality and assaulting common sense and assaulting due process and
[03:07.560 --> 03:09.080]  assaulting logic.
[03:09.080 --> 03:12.040]  And people keep asking us until everything disintegrates.
[03:12.040 --> 03:18.200]  This is the first time in American history, I believe, that a chamber of the Congress
[03:18.200 --> 03:25.920]  will pass a bill openly defying the Supreme Court's explicit declaration of the constitutional
[03:25.920 --> 03:28.520]  rights of the American people.
[03:28.520 --> 03:35.320]  It represents the farthest ever reach of the Democrats' long-pursued, massive resistance
[03:35.320 --> 03:37.520]  doctrine.
[03:37.520 --> 03:45.320]  In Markup, I asked if any Democrat disputed that this bill bans guns and magazines in common
[03:45.320 --> 03:46.720]  use.
[03:46.720 --> 03:52.640]  Chairman Nadler candidly responded, quote, with the gentleman yield, I would, if I were
[03:52.640 --> 03:53.640]  to answer that question.
[03:53.640 --> 03:55.080]  Yeah, that's the point of the bill.
[03:55.080 --> 03:59.600]  So you mean you clarify, Mr. Chairman, you're saying it is the point of the bill to ban
[03:59.600 --> 04:02.240]  weapons that are in common use in the United States today?
[04:02.240 --> 04:04.360]  Yes, the problem is with the gentleman.
[04:04.360 --> 04:11.280]  In other words, the essence of the bill is to stop commerce in weapons, as alternatively
[04:11.280 --> 04:18.280]  described by the court in Heller in 2008, as those, quote, typically possessed by law-abiding
[04:18.280 --> 04:21.080]  citizens for lawful purposes, close quote.
[04:21.080 --> 04:23.280]  And that is now the point we've entered at every level.
[04:23.280 --> 04:26.120]  Donald Trump blocked the Courage Act.
[04:26.120 --> 04:31.800]  The brave women and men in blue all across this nation should never forget that.
[04:31.800 --> 04:37.280]  Folks, as we fight inflation, bringing down gas prices is a big part of the job.
[04:37.280 --> 04:41.440]  All right, I wanted to play some of the 11-minute speech, so you can see he's not blinking, and
[04:41.440 --> 04:43.440]  then another speech later where he is.
[04:43.440 --> 04:47.040]  I mean, if you can figure out what this is, please tell me.
[04:47.040 --> 04:53.320]  We've reached out to some physiologists and people that can perhaps tell us what in the
[04:53.320 --> 05:00.760]  world this means, but it's getting crazy.
[05:00.760 --> 05:06.240]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being caught
[05:06.240 --> 05:10.720]  flat-footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[05:10.720 --> 05:15.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of
[05:15.360 --> 05:20.640]  the battle that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people
[05:20.640 --> 05:23.320]  like you've never done before.
[05:23.320 --> 05:25.680]  We have come so far together.
[05:25.680 --> 05:27.000]  Please help keep us from the air.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.720]  We're under massive attack right now, but we're going to win with your help.
[05:30.720 --> 05:34.040]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[05:34.040 --> 05:37.440]  Please go to infoworkstore.com and get this book.
[05:37.440 --> 05:39.760]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[05:39.760 --> 05:45.320]  The great reset and the war for the world available right now at infoworkstore.com.
[05:45.320 --> 05:47.840]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[05:47.840 --> 05:51.400]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching
[05:51.400 --> 05:55.960]  as well, but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because
[05:55.960 --> 05:58.360]  it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[05:58.360 --> 06:11.560]  Get the great reset at infoworkstore.com.
[06:11.560 --> 06:16.160]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:16.160 --> 06:17.880]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:17.880 --> 06:22.880]  Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios.
[06:22.880 --> 06:25.040]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:25.040 --> 06:33.560]  Well, the United Nations global government WF combine had been busy these month ago they
[06:33.560 --> 06:38.320]  announced that the private corporate dictatorships merging with the UN that it controls publicly.
[06:38.320 --> 06:43.080]  Last week they announced global censorship interfacing with big tech to block basically
[06:43.080 --> 06:45.040]  any type of pro human information.
[06:45.040 --> 06:50.760]  They had a new COVID lockdowns and now the UN officially came out on Friday.
[06:50.760 --> 06:55.320]  I didn't see it until yesterday and released a video about how they're going to run the
[06:55.320 --> 06:59.840]  new global ID system and control the world ID.
[06:59.840 --> 07:03.200]  So world government with a world ID run by the tyrannical UN.
[07:03.200 --> 07:05.040]  We've got that information.
[07:05.040 --> 07:10.720]  We've got the admission of the global cutoff of food supplies as part two of the great
[07:10.720 --> 07:11.720]  resets.
[07:11.720 --> 07:15.280]  They already use lockdowns to destroy food supply all over the world.
[07:15.280 --> 07:17.880]  In some third world countries they did it for two years.
[07:17.880 --> 07:23.880]  Now they're moving ahead to ban most types of farming and ranching in every major nation
[07:23.880 --> 07:25.480]  of the earth.
[07:25.480 --> 07:28.480]  Unbelievable what that's going to cause.
[07:28.480 --> 07:32.720]  This is going to accelerate a total collapse of the third world and a flooding of the first
[07:32.720 --> 07:34.880]  world and our collapse as well.
[07:34.880 --> 07:41.360]  In Italy and Australia, in the Netherlands, in the UK and in Canada millions of farmers
[07:41.360 --> 07:46.800]  are protesting almost zero coverage in the corporate media of this.
[07:46.800 --> 07:47.800]  Why are they protesting?
[07:47.800 --> 07:55.160]  Well, this is a UN edict and the WEF, your cows, your farms, the grain you're growing,
[07:55.160 --> 07:56.640]  all carbon is toxic.
[07:56.640 --> 08:00.640]  Well, we're carbon based life forms.
[08:00.640 --> 08:02.640]  That's coming up.
[08:02.640 --> 08:06.720]  Biden's had COVID supposedly or touched it positive twice in the last two weeks.
[08:06.720 --> 08:13.680]  He's hiding again supposedly quarantining himself and massive new information adding
[08:13.680 --> 08:18.040]  on to all the other insurance numbers and government numbers we've had around the western world
[08:18.040 --> 08:23.360]  of the so-called COVID vaccines causing mass death, blood clots, infertility and cancer.
[08:23.360 --> 08:27.920]  Those are three stacks I've got here that are absolutely massive and a lot of new monkey
[08:27.920 --> 08:31.920]  pox news as they prepare the new global lockdown that's already been announced that they are
[08:31.920 --> 08:35.080]  planning to do it later this fall.
[08:35.080 --> 08:37.200]  So that's their current trajectory.
[08:37.200 --> 08:38.200]  This is all pre-planned.
[08:38.200 --> 08:39.200]  It's all being rolled out.
[08:39.200 --> 08:40.200]  It's all coming up.
[08:40.200 --> 08:41.200]  And so much more today.
[08:41.200 --> 08:43.200]  We have a special guest joining us in the second hour.
[08:43.200 --> 08:46.760]  But let me just get this out of the way right now.
[08:46.760 --> 08:50.760]  I am proud of the work of M4 Wars in the last 28 years.
[08:50.760 --> 08:52.720]  We have never made a mistake on purpose.
[08:52.720 --> 08:54.120]  We've never lied on purpose.
[08:54.120 --> 08:56.320]  We've never lied.
[08:56.320 --> 09:01.040]  But we're not like the corporate mercenary new world order parrots that put out their
[09:01.040 --> 09:05.040]  lies and propaganda who never admit when they're wrong.
[09:05.040 --> 09:08.480]  When we make a mistake, we admit to it.
[09:08.480 --> 09:14.360]  And it's essential that we do that because all we have is our credibility.
[09:14.360 --> 09:18.960]  That said, with these three Sandy Hook trials, which are show trials where the judges have
[09:18.960 --> 09:23.920]  found me guilty in both Texas and Connecticut without ever letting me have a jury trial,
[09:23.920 --> 09:26.240]  the juries are told he is guilty.
[09:26.240 --> 09:30.120]  The judges said I can't say I'm innocent while I'm obviously going to.
[09:30.120 --> 09:34.160]  And even swing up on murder charges, Charlie Manson can say he was innocent if he wanted
[09:34.160 --> 09:35.160]  to.
[09:35.160 --> 09:39.480]  And I am innocent of what they've claimed premeditatedly lying about nobody dying at
[09:39.480 --> 09:44.360]  Sandy Hook to make money and saying my main career was Sandy Hook.
[09:44.360 --> 09:47.720]  When they've talked more about Sandy Hook at this week long trial, the first week of
[09:47.720 --> 09:53.480]  it, then we talked about in all my time on air since it happened a decade ago.
[09:53.480 --> 09:55.520]  We have all those numbers down to the minute.
[09:55.520 --> 09:59.520]  So it's just a complete lie and a fraud.
[09:59.520 --> 10:03.840]  That said, I looked at some of the evidence later, they claim show that it happened.
[10:03.840 --> 10:04.840]  And it wasn't true.
[10:04.840 --> 10:06.520]  I believe mass shootings happened.
[10:06.520 --> 10:07.840]  I believe Parkland happened.
[10:07.840 --> 10:09.680]  I believe Columbine happened.
[10:09.680 --> 10:13.560]  And I believe in every case we know it's linked to Prozac type drugs, video game shoot them
[10:13.560 --> 10:19.960]  up and mental illness and police stand downs like we just saw in Yvaldi, very, very shameful.
[10:19.960 --> 10:25.400]  That said, though, I didn't lie about WMDs in Iraq on purpose like the CNN, the New York
[10:25.400 --> 10:26.400]  Times.
[10:26.400 --> 10:28.440]  I didn't lie about it being safe and effective.
[10:28.440 --> 10:31.880]  These poison shots they now admit don't work and actually make you sick.
[10:31.880 --> 10:37.000]  I didn't promote drag queen pedophile time and I was the first more than 14 years ago
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.080]  to expose Jeffrey Epstein and Epstein Island and how they were flying kids out and using
[10:42.080 --> 10:46.440]  it to blackmail and control people, particularly in the science divisions of the world for
[10:46.440 --> 10:50.720]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to take over that Epstein basically worked for them.
[10:50.720 --> 10:52.720]  We are the first to expose it.
[10:52.720 --> 10:58.520]  We have been vindicated and I am proud of the body of our work and they see info wars
[10:58.520 --> 11:05.800]  as the brightest light in this coming darkness of populism and pro-human, pro-God, pro-family,
[11:05.800 --> 11:10.920]  pro-children and that's why they hate us because they hate you and they believe they can take
[11:10.920 --> 11:12.320]  us off air.
[11:12.320 --> 11:15.960]  They will be able to defeat everybody else and they have admitted that the model of
[11:15.960 --> 11:20.800]  censoring us and banking us and suing us is the model to shut down Tucker Carlson, Joe
[11:20.800 --> 11:23.400]  Rogan and everybody else.
[11:23.400 --> 11:28.680]  Now that said, when I declared bankruptcy four months ago with info wars and three other
[11:28.680 --> 11:34.160]  sub-companies, that was a very real bankruptcy and it was an attempt to bring a brokered
[11:34.160 --> 11:37.320]  settlement deal with them in federal court because you go to the president and you lie
[11:37.320 --> 11:41.520]  in federal court and say, I don't have $10 million, I don't have $5 million.
[11:41.520 --> 11:46.320]  The time we had $3 million, we could scrounge together out of the company, maybe.
[11:46.320 --> 11:50.760]  We put $3 million on the table and said, here it is in a federal filing, we are in limited
[11:50.760 --> 11:55.920]  bankruptcy, you can come check it all for yourselves and they said, you're a fraud, you're a liar,
[11:55.920 --> 11:56.920]  all this other garbage.
[11:56.920 --> 12:05.480]  Now, four months later, we don't have any extra money and we're going into full bankruptcy
[12:05.480 --> 12:11.040]  to absolutely show all of this, let them have their first trial, show them all the numbers
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.280]  and then they want to have two trials, one in Texas and one in Connecticut starting in
[12:15.280 --> 12:21.360]  September and the judges have said, screw you, you've got to be in both places at once,
[12:21.360 --> 12:27.400]  which is impossible and so we're putting it before the federal judge, we declared bankruptcy
[12:27.400 --> 12:32.800]  on free speech systems, the parent company of this whole operation, all the cards on
[12:32.800 --> 12:40.440]  the table and I'm putting my finances in everything so this crap stops.
[12:40.440 --> 12:45.600]  When they got these bankruptcy lawyers, very respected ones in here, six months ago as we
[12:45.600 --> 12:52.120]  began to develop this, they said, my God, you've not paid yourself in over a year and
[12:52.120 --> 12:55.640]  they went, my God, the news claims you've got all this money, you don't, they're just
[12:55.640 --> 13:00.920]  making it up and so they've never seen anything like this.
[13:00.920 --> 13:08.320]  There are articles all over the news saying, I made $76 million in 2019.
[13:08.320 --> 13:11.560]  We almost lost money in 2019.
[13:11.560 --> 13:15.600]  The big year we made money and thank God because it lasted us for years because I saved a bunch
[13:15.600 --> 13:19.160]  of it and invested it in real estate and doubled the money.
[13:19.160 --> 13:27.040]  We have been operating in the last two years off of money that people buying products and
[13:27.040 --> 13:32.440]  support in that gigantic year of 2016 and I said, I'm going to take this money and invest
[13:32.440 --> 13:33.720]  it in real estate and other things.
[13:33.720 --> 13:37.840]  We sold that real estate in the last year and it has funded this place and kept us on
[13:37.840 --> 13:38.840]  air.
[13:38.840 --> 13:42.040]  So I was a good steward like the aunt who saves for the winter to the grasshopper that
[13:42.040 --> 13:45.560]  doesn't save during the summer and dies in the winter.
[13:45.560 --> 13:48.920]  But this aunt is out of money.
[13:48.920 --> 13:53.120]  This has been a long, hard winter of tyranny and I'm no Sunshine Patriot and I'm a winter
[13:53.120 --> 13:55.240]  soldier so I'm not a victim.
[13:55.240 --> 13:58.840]  I'm a target because I've been effective telling the truth.
[13:58.840 --> 14:00.640]  But listen, we're not going to get shut down.
[14:00.640 --> 14:03.960]  They have admitted the Democrats that run this in the Austin American Statesmen today
[14:03.960 --> 14:08.640]  and in the Boston Globe and the New York Times, their goal is to quote, punish me and silence
[14:08.640 --> 14:10.560]  us and shut us down.
[14:10.560 --> 14:14.560]  That's why they lie to the jury in the damages portion and say, I got hundreds of millions
[14:14.560 --> 14:15.560]  dollars.
[14:15.560 --> 14:16.560]  That's why they do this.
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.360]  So look up with some giant judgment on the already guilty Alex Jones that they hope is
[14:20.360 --> 14:23.880]  too big for us to even get a bond done.
[14:23.880 --> 14:28.640]  Well once you're in bankruptcy, it's all there in the court and the bonds for the appeals
[14:28.640 --> 14:30.160]  are half your net worth.
[14:30.160 --> 14:32.840]  Well that isn't going to be very, very much.
[14:32.840 --> 14:36.120]  Maybe a million, million and a half dollars or something and they're going to try to claim
[14:36.120 --> 14:39.080]  all this other wealth but it's not true.
[14:39.080 --> 14:44.000]  So then we will be able to continue on with appeals and the rest of it for years and we
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.360]  will be able to fight these kangaroo courts and what they've done and this Texas judge
[14:49.360 --> 14:50.520]  really screwed up.
[14:50.520 --> 14:54.920]  She put a motions and limiting in two months ago saying, cannot mention the First Amendment,
[14:54.920 --> 14:55.920]  says it.
[14:55.920 --> 14:56.920]  I published it on Inforwards.
[14:56.920 --> 15:01.760]  Her order cannot mention First Amendment, cannot say you're innocent and a whole bunch
[15:01.760 --> 15:03.040]  of other stuff.
[15:03.040 --> 15:10.440]  So she then withdrew that when we took it to the court of appeals voluntarily but she's
[15:10.440 --> 15:14.000]  still trying to enforce those rules on the trial.
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.080]  And so if the Texas Supreme Court wants to certify that, fine, Texas is dead.
[15:18.080 --> 15:19.320]  I left it all in the field.
[15:19.320 --> 15:22.640]  I'll still be able to work for some other company and be on air because I don't give
[15:22.640 --> 15:26.000]  a damn about money at the end of the day except as a tool to fight the globalist.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.360]  And so one way or another Inforwards will stay on the air.
[15:28.360 --> 15:29.680]  Will it be crippling for a while?
[15:29.680 --> 15:31.280]  Will we have to hear a bunch of the crew?
[15:31.280 --> 15:33.040]  But that's down the road.
[15:33.040 --> 15:35.840]  That's why your massive support now is beyond critical.

[16:51.000 --> 16:55.120]  This is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because it warns the

[17:00.000 --> 17:05.120]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S. that supplies the
[17:05.120 --> 17:10.320]  highest quality signature reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon and other U.S. government
[17:10.320 --> 17:11.320]  agencies.
[17:11.320 --> 17:16.800]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made in America honey end line at
[17:16.800 --> 17:22.000]  a very affordable price, whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone or big
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.640]  pouches that protect laptops and iPads or big bags that promote whatever electronics
[17:27.640 --> 17:30.120]  you want to put in like desktop computers.
[17:30.120 --> 17:36.560]  It is all exclusively available at infowarstore.com under the Redux name.

[17:42.560 --> 17:48.520]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity
[17:48.520 --> 17:53.000]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.

[17:59.440 --> 18:05.640]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[18:05.640 --> 18:08.040]  we've known and what's to come.
[18:08.040 --> 18:14.400]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is don't panic, stay calm because
[18:14.400 --> 18:20.840]  now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course.
[18:20.840 --> 18:26.600]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own
[18:26.600 --> 18:27.720]  society.
[18:27.720 --> 18:33.280]  All we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare.
[18:33.280 --> 18:37.560]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[18:37.560 --> 18:43.880]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and survival gear to
[18:43.880 --> 18:46.320]  keep us strong and at the ready.

[18:58.040 --> 19:02.920]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet, especially as you get older,
[19:02.920 --> 19:07.960]  you gain weight, even if you eat a lot less, I got to tell you, Info Wars is only about
[19:07.960 --> 19:10.640]  bringing you amazing products that really work.
[19:10.640 --> 19:14.200]  So we looked at the supplement market that we find a lot of our operations with and we
[19:14.200 --> 19:20.840]  said, what are the best selling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out
[19:20.840 --> 19:21.840]  there?
[19:21.840 --> 19:22.840]  We went and looked at the top 10.
[19:22.840 --> 19:28.120]  They all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product, but with our new
[19:28.120 --> 19:37.560]  product from X7, Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences
[19:37.560 --> 19:40.080]  that's two amazing things for your body.
[19:40.080 --> 19:44.320]  So I've lost almost 40 pounds, I'm so a little bit overweight, in the last three months and
[19:44.320 --> 19:48.160]  I've been doing it using Diet Force and also exercise.
[19:48.160 --> 19:54.680]  Well now Diet Force is exclusively available right now at InfoWarsStore.com, 40% off.
[19:54.680 --> 20:01.240]  InfoWarsStore.com, Diet Force, you need to take this product, it really works.
[20:01.240 --> 20:07.880]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:07.880 --> 20:23.800]  All right, I want to talk about the dying corporate medias.
[20:23.800 --> 20:29.960]  Arrogance and how they try to set themselves up as fact checkers and the arbiters of truth,
[20:29.960 --> 20:30.960]  it's truly sick.
[20:30.960 --> 20:37.960]  They've had hundreds that I've seen, there's thousands, of their pundits on CNN, ABC, there's
[20:37.960 --> 20:38.960]  NBC, all of them.
[20:38.960 --> 20:47.960]  I've got dozens of clips just I saw this weekend saying a recession is not two quarters of
[20:47.960 --> 20:48.960]  negative growth.
[20:48.960 --> 20:59.680]  I mean that's the very definition of their Keynesian economic system.
[20:59.680 --> 21:04.520]  And you've got Paul Krugman out there saying, well he admitted he was wrong last week that
[21:04.520 --> 21:07.560]  we weren't going to go into a recession, but then he says, but don't worry, the recession
[21:07.560 --> 21:09.720]  means something different today.
[21:09.720 --> 21:13.360]  They say that a man is a woman and a woman is a man.
[21:13.360 --> 21:15.800]  They promote pedophilia.
[21:15.800 --> 21:22.080]  Everything they do is a lie on purpose and they point their fingers at the American people
[21:22.080 --> 21:29.760]  that don't believe a word say, and if we question Jesse Smollett or Yuvaldi or Bubba Wallace
[21:29.760 --> 21:32.400]  or Gulpatonkin or 9-11, we're bad.
[21:32.400 --> 21:38.840]  No, we're good for questioning and we should and we'll continue on questioning.
[21:38.840 --> 21:50.200]  But I saw a video clip of the BBC attacking the Azerbaijani president, who's obviously
[21:50.200 --> 21:55.240]  very well spoken and very well educated, and he says, we have free open media here in this
[21:55.240 --> 21:56.240]  country.
[21:56.240 --> 22:00.280]  You're the ones in the U.K. and the U.S. that have tortured and almost killed Julian
[22:00.280 --> 22:04.120]  Assange in solitary confinement for eight plus years.
[22:04.120 --> 22:09.480]  We're the fraud and this is the perfect way to counter these people that set themselves
[22:09.480 --> 22:17.840]  up as our bosses when they have the worst records on purpose of lying by design.
[22:17.840 --> 22:24.520]  How many Project Veritas videos have we seen of CNN and MSNBC and ABC and all of them behind
[22:24.520 --> 22:27.240]  the scenes in their own outtakes?
[22:27.240 --> 22:28.240]  Remember ABC News?
[22:28.240 --> 22:31.400]  Oh, we knew Epstein was raping people five years ago and they were running child kidnapped
[22:31.400 --> 22:35.000]  rings to blackmail people, but we were told don't cover it.
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  I wish I could have.
[22:36.000 --> 22:37.000]  I'd barely been big.
[22:37.000 --> 22:42.880]  The teleprompter BEMBO said, she didn't care about the kidnapped kids or the sex trade.
[22:42.880 --> 22:43.880]  She was just mad.
[22:43.880 --> 22:46.680]  She couldn't break it because that'd be a big story for her.
[22:46.680 --> 22:47.760]  That was Project Veritas.
[22:47.760 --> 22:53.000]  Just Project Veritas has got to release, like what, 100 in the last six, seven years?
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.600]  Undercover videos of executives and producers admitting they lie on purpose.
[22:57.600 --> 22:59.440]  There's no executives here telling me what to say.
[22:59.440 --> 23:05.360]  I give you what I think is really going on, but again, they set themselves up as self-appointed
[23:05.360 --> 23:13.480]  masters who then organized the corporate media and all the rest of them together at the very
[23:13.480 --> 23:18.840]  same time to then demonize the populace, demonize the person standing up and exposing the new
[23:18.840 --> 23:19.840]  world order.
[23:19.840 --> 23:24.480]  So I'm quite honored to be attacked by this system, but it's still scary up close to see
[23:24.480 --> 23:28.680]  that their corruption goes all the way down to the local court systems.
[23:28.680 --> 23:33.660]  And that the entire corporate media is in lockstep, refusing to report that judge found
[23:33.660 --> 23:39.280]  me guilty without a jury, and that we gave them all the damn discovery that no one would
[23:39.280 --> 23:40.520]  ever give anybody.
[23:40.520 --> 23:44.480]  Bank accounts, all our emails, everything, and they would say, oh, you didn't give it
[23:44.480 --> 23:45.480]  to us all.
[23:45.480 --> 23:48.200]  Oh, there's more for four years.
[23:48.200 --> 23:54.280]  And then I'm sitting there in the trial on how I'm guilty, guilty until proven guiltier,
[23:54.280 --> 23:57.720]  and they're showing all the emails, all the text messages, all the stuff, and we gave
[23:57.720 --> 23:58.720]  it all to him.
[23:58.720 --> 24:02.200]  And then the judge is telling him he's defaulted because he didn't give us any information.
[24:02.200 --> 24:04.680]  He didn't show up to court.
[24:04.680 --> 24:05.680]  All a lie.
[24:05.680 --> 24:09.920]  Oh, we missed like one or two deadlines during COVID.
[24:09.920 --> 24:15.320]  But in that you might get sanctioned for the cost of the court hearing, maybe $5,000, $10,000.
[24:15.320 --> 24:20.440]  No, she sanctioned me over a million and a half dollars the last year and a half alone.
[24:20.440 --> 24:24.160]  Connecticut sanctioned us hundreds of thousands of dollars, the exact same blueprint.
[24:24.160 --> 24:27.840]  They're being run, they're being told what to do.
[24:27.840 --> 24:32.360]  Oh, the judge also doesn't want to mention that we gave them discovery while they show
[24:32.360 --> 24:33.520]  it to the jury.
[24:33.520 --> 24:36.760]  She's hoping she could keep them in the dark.
[24:36.760 --> 24:42.400]  But look at how the president of Azerbaijan counters the arrogant BBC.
[24:42.400 --> 24:43.400]  This is pure gold.
[24:43.400 --> 24:51.640]  And the number of internet users in Azerbaijan is more than 80%.
[24:51.640 --> 24:56.800]  Can you imagine the restriction of media in a country where internet is free, there is
[24:56.800 --> 25:00.720]  no censorship, and there are 80% of internet users.
[25:00.720 --> 25:02.480]  We have millions of people on Facebook.
[25:02.480 --> 25:04.920]  How can you say that we don't have free media?
[25:04.920 --> 25:07.960]  This is again a biased approach.
[25:07.960 --> 25:13.480]  This is an attempt to create a perception in Western audience about Azerbaijan.
[25:13.480 --> 25:14.480]  We have opposition.
[25:14.480 --> 25:16.040]  We have NGOs.
[25:16.040 --> 25:18.440]  We have free political activity.
[25:18.440 --> 25:19.920]  We have free media.
[25:19.920 --> 25:22.320]  We have freedom of speech.
[25:22.320 --> 25:26.040]  But if you raise this question, can I ask you also one?
[25:26.040 --> 25:31.080]  How do you assess what happened to Mr. Assange?
[25:31.080 --> 25:34.440]  Is it a reflection of free media in your country?
[25:34.440 --> 25:36.440]  We're not here to discuss my country.
[25:36.440 --> 25:37.440]  No, let's discuss.
[25:37.440 --> 25:38.440]  Let's discuss.
[25:38.440 --> 25:39.440]  No, president.
[25:39.440 --> 25:44.480]  In order to accuse me, saying that Armenians will not have free media here, let's talk
[25:44.480 --> 25:45.920]  about Assange.
[25:45.920 --> 25:46.920]  How many years?
[25:46.920 --> 25:47.920]  Sorry.
[25:47.920 --> 25:50.080]  How many years he spent in Ecuadorian embassy?
[25:50.080 --> 25:51.080]  And for what?
[25:51.080 --> 25:52.520]  And where is he now?
[25:52.520 --> 25:54.400]  For journalistic activity.
[25:54.400 --> 26:00.680]  You kept that person hostage, actually killing him morally and physically.
[26:00.680 --> 26:03.520]  You did it, not us, and now he's in prison.
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.520]  So you have no moral right to talk about free media when you do these things.
[26:08.520 --> 26:09.520]  Returning to the conflict.
[26:09.520 --> 26:10.520]  How long?
[26:10.520 --> 26:13.720]  Yeah, better return to the conflict, because this is not what you like.
[26:13.720 --> 26:17.040]  You like only to accuse, only to attack.
[26:17.040 --> 26:18.480]  But look at the mirror.
[26:18.480 --> 26:23.080]  Look, I tell many times before coming and lecturing us.
[26:23.080 --> 26:28.000]  And in your question, accusing me, it's not a question, it's accusation.
[26:28.000 --> 26:29.800]  You talk like a prosecutor.
[26:29.800 --> 26:30.800]  Why?
[26:30.800 --> 26:35.200]  If you're so democratic and so objective, why you keep Assange in prison?
[26:35.200 --> 26:36.200]  For what?
[26:36.200 --> 26:41.760]  You keep him in prison because of his journalistic activity.
[26:41.760 --> 26:44.840]  I'm not keeping him in prison, president Aliyev.
[26:44.840 --> 26:46.720]  You don't like this.
[26:46.720 --> 26:51.840]  It's not a question you don't like, it's not the subject of our interview.
[26:51.840 --> 26:54.200]  It's not the subject of our interview, and with respect, president Aliyev.
[26:54.200 --> 26:56.920]  No, it is not the subject of interview, but you raised it.
[26:56.920 --> 26:57.920]  You raised it.
[26:57.920 --> 26:58.920]  No, you raised it.
[26:58.920 --> 26:59.920]  You raised the case of Assange.
[26:59.920 --> 27:04.080]  You said Armenians, if you don't have a free media in your country.
[27:04.080 --> 27:05.640]  Listen to that gaslighting witch.
[27:05.640 --> 27:08.560]  I'm surprised she didn't fly into the interview on a broom.
[27:08.560 --> 27:13.560]  She says, you raised the issue of media censorship.
[27:13.560 --> 27:15.680]  And he goes, no, I didn't.
[27:15.680 --> 27:16.680]  You did.
[27:16.680 --> 27:18.240]  Because I mean Assange.
[27:18.240 --> 27:23.960]  How can she lecture them, when I've looked at it, they're about as free as the UK is,
[27:23.960 --> 27:30.440]  which isn't that good, and then say that him bringing up Assange doesn't matter.
[27:30.440 --> 27:36.600]  Now, look, I'm a proud of exposing that there weren't WMDs in Iraq, and the right wing called
[27:36.600 --> 27:39.400]  me, Fox News called me a communist then.
[27:39.400 --> 27:42.640]  No, I'm an American patriot that doesn't want to get our troops killed, doesn't want American
[27:42.640 --> 27:43.640]  legal wars.
[27:43.640 --> 27:47.280]  And I've exposed the pedophile rings, they're now out in the open in Jeffrey Epstein.
[27:47.280 --> 27:50.680]  And now even Joe Rogan gets on there all the time and says Alex Jones was the first to
[27:50.680 --> 27:51.680]  break it.
[27:51.680 --> 27:57.080]  And Joe now talks about the multiple intelligence agencies that are clearly involved controlling
[27:57.080 --> 27:58.080]  Epstein.
[27:58.080 --> 28:01.720]  But he says he doesn't know why they're going after scientists, because scientists are the
[28:01.720 --> 28:02.720]  real elite.
[28:02.720 --> 28:07.160]  And if they get all the heads of the major universities and major scientific groups blackmailed,
[28:07.160 --> 28:10.960]  then they can launch a COVID-19, even though it's man-made, and have it covered up because
[28:10.960 --> 28:13.760]  they control the scientific intelligentsia.
[28:13.760 --> 28:18.800]  So we're going to play this quick clip, and then I got so much more, man, the food being
[28:18.800 --> 28:23.320]  cut off, the next phase of the collapse, the lockdowns, all of it.
[28:23.320 --> 28:26.520]  Next segment, and we've got some amazing news, wait till you see it out of Australia, they're
[28:26.520 --> 28:29.360]  really waking up.
[28:29.360 --> 28:32.400]  It was an intelligence operation.
[28:32.400 --> 28:37.960]  Whoever was running it, whether it was the Mossad or whether it was the CIA or whether
[28:37.960 --> 28:39.200]  it was a combination of both.
[28:39.200 --> 28:41.240]  It was an intelligence operation.
[28:41.240 --> 28:43.800]  They were bringing in people and compromising them.
[28:43.800 --> 28:49.440]  And then when they would compromise them, they would use whatever they had on them to
[28:49.440 --> 28:55.800]  influence their opinions, and the way they expressed those opinions.
[28:55.800 --> 28:59.800]  And I don't know why they would want to do that with scientists, which is really...
[28:59.800 --> 29:05.280]  The globalist great reset, or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being
[29:05.280 --> 29:09.880]  caught flat footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[29:09.880 --> 29:14.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever, as we reach the critical heart
[29:14.560 --> 29:19.560]  of the battle, that you spread the word, and that you support liberty, and that you warn
[29:19.560 --> 29:22.640]  people like you've never done before.
[29:22.640 --> 29:27.160]  We have come so far together, please help keep us from the air, we're under massive
[29:27.160 --> 29:30.040]  attack right now, but we're going to win with your help.
[29:30.040 --> 29:33.360]  We're going to overcome this with your help, and with God's blessing.
[29:33.360 --> 29:36.760]  Please go to infoworkstore.com and get this book.
[29:36.760 --> 29:39.080]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[29:39.080 --> 29:43.960]  The great reset and the war for the world available right now at infoworkstore.com.
[29:43.960 --> 29:47.320]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[29:47.320 --> 29:50.720]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching
[29:50.720 --> 29:55.280]  as well, but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because
[29:55.280 --> 29:57.680]  it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[29:57.680 --> 30:00.400]  Get the great reset at infoworkstore.com.
[30:00.400 --> 30:04.960]  I don't care if you work at a cafeteria or pump gas, or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[30:04.960 --> 30:10.120]  a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[30:10.120 --> 30:11.120]  You see it every year.
[30:11.120 --> 30:16.320]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers,
[30:16.320 --> 30:22.120]  and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[30:22.120 --> 30:25.520]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[30:25.520 --> 30:26.520]  this and knowing this.
[30:26.520 --> 30:32.120]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[30:32.120 --> 30:37.360]  to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of
[30:37.360 --> 30:38.360]  your money.
[30:38.360 --> 30:43.120]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[30:43.120 --> 30:50.240]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com,
[30:50.240 --> 31:00.120]  or call 833-904-285, 833-904-285.
[31:00.120 --> 31:05.520]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[31:05.520 --> 31:10.080]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages, and the studies are all clear.
[31:10.080 --> 31:16.720]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom, and the number
[31:16.720 --> 31:20.440]  one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[31:20.440 --> 31:24.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people
[31:24.120 --> 31:28.680]  having lasting, good, loving relationships, they want to break up society, and we are
[31:28.680 --> 31:35.880]  so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world available

[33:01.120 --> 33:23.120]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:23.120 --> 33:27.880]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:27.880 --> 33:35.120]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he, live from the InfoWare.com studios, it's Alex
[33:35.120 --> 33:36.120]  Jones.
[33:36.120 --> 33:47.760]  One last breath, four winds blow, lock of your wife and children now, time to wheel the
[33:47.760 --> 34:01.920]  blade, the horsemen are drawing nearer, they come to take your life, onto the dead of night,
[34:01.920 --> 34:17.480]  you see the four horsemen ride, so choose your fate, the four horsemen, and I saw
[34:17.480 --> 34:28.000]  a white horse, he that rode on it was named death, the horse of famine has come as well.
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.280]  Powerful article up on InfoWare.com from the Brownstone Institute, no farmers, no food,
[34:33.280 --> 34:39.640]  no life, another big report, top scientists, top experts around the world confirmed that
[34:39.640 --> 34:45.560]  the W-E-F-U-N policies are what is destroying the crop yields and shutting the world economy
[34:45.560 --> 34:50.760]  down and the U-N admits, for the world economic forum, we're cutting off the farms to lower
[34:50.760 --> 34:56.000]  carbon because crops and cows produce carbon that's part of the life cycle.
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.200]  Meanwhile, Sebastian Vitell reveals climate crisis fears influence his F1 retirement,
[35:02.200 --> 35:08.840]  saying driving cars and creating carbon is bad, so the top F1 driver is looking to quit.
[35:08.840 --> 35:12.240]  Drake defends his short private jet flights, though he supports carbon taxes and taking
[35:12.240 --> 35:16.880]  your cars away by saying plane was empty.
[35:16.880 --> 35:21.920]  Let's play a powerful Australian senator, Malcolm Roberts, dropping absolute truth bombs
[35:21.920 --> 35:28.160]  on Klaus Schwab and the Great Reset, two different clips as he lays out, the human resistance
[35:28.160 --> 35:32.440]  movement worldwide, you're either for the New World Order or you're against it, we are
[35:32.440 --> 35:37.880]  the resistance and make no mistake, it is this transmission, Bolsonaro's son, who's
[35:37.880 --> 35:42.760]  also in the Congress told me this years ago at CPAC, Bolsonaro said it, was invited down
[35:42.760 --> 35:46.320]  there to interview the president like Tucker was, not bragging him to showing our effect,
[35:46.320 --> 35:52.200]  your effect supporting us, Orban's been influenced by us, all of them have been influenced and
[35:52.200 --> 35:57.800]  we now have Australian leaders really waking up, so let's play back to back Australian
[35:57.800 --> 36:03.680]  senator Malcolm Rhodes, let's play clip three and four back to back, here they are.
[36:03.680 --> 36:08.120]  The United Nations has a problem, how can they control the carbon footprint of the world's
[36:08.120 --> 36:13.920]  citizens, very soon government will tell our farmers what they can grow and punish Australian
[36:13.920 --> 36:20.960]  consumers if they buy the wrong things, the dream of micromanaging individual carbon emissions
[36:20.960 --> 36:27.360]  hinges on the soon to be passed so called trusted digital identity bill, if Scott Morrison
[36:27.360 --> 36:34.200]  and Barnaby Joyce want to achieve their net zero 2050 dream, freedoms must be slashed,
[36:34.200 --> 36:39.480]  removed, it is only through the relentless digital stalking of citizens that the Liberal
[36:39.480 --> 36:45.160]  Nationals government can micromanage purchasing choices, businesses are punished with tax
[36:45.160 --> 36:51.680]  while consumers get their credit score docked, this already happens in China, where a person's
[36:51.680 --> 36:58.360]  shopping list lowers their social credit score until they cannot travel, in Australia it
[36:58.360 --> 37:02.640]  may be as simple as denying banking services because you dare to drive a four wheel drive
[37:02.640 --> 37:07.960]  to work, Australian banks have already shown a keen interest in the trusted digital identity
[37:07.960 --> 37:14.240]  bill saying it will quote allow them to create a rich view of their customers, these are
[37:14.240 --> 37:21.000]  the same banks that already list climate risk as a means to deny loans, when the Liberals
[37:21.000 --> 37:29.680]  tell you that digital identity will make your life easier, remember there is no such thing
[37:29.680 --> 37:35.920]  as a free lunch, this is the mark of the beast, that's the main senator, Clare Schwab's life
[37:35.920 --> 37:44.000]  by subscription quote is really serfdom, it's slavery, billionaire globalist corporations
[37:44.000 --> 37:52.600]  will own everything, homes, factories, farms, cars, furniture and everyday citizens will
[37:52.600 --> 38:00.560]  rent what they need, if their social credit score allows, the plan of the great reset
[38:00.560 --> 38:06.760]  is that you will die with nothing, to pull off this evil plan Clare Schwab's World Economic
[38:06.760 --> 38:12.960]  Forum will need to take more than just material possessions from Australians, Senators in
[38:12.960 --> 38:21.920]  this very chamber today who support the great reset threaten our privacy, freedom and dignity,
[38:21.920 --> 38:28.200]  yes they're in this Senate chamber, one nation vehemently opposes the great reset, the digital
[38:28.200 --> 38:32.600]  identity bill, theft of agricultural land use, forcing farmers off their land and all
[38:32.600 --> 38:37.400]  of the great reset, one nation has a comprehensive plan to bring our beautiful country back to
[38:37.400 --> 38:43.640]  sustainable prosperity and in the months ahead we will be rolling that plan out, instead
[38:43.640 --> 38:48.080]  of LibLab pushing Clare Schwab's great reset with the tagline, you will own nothing and
[38:48.080 --> 38:55.920]  be happy, one nation advocates the great resist, we stand for a world where individuals and
[38:55.920 --> 39:01.000]  communities have primacy over predatory globalist billionaires and their quizzling bureaucrats,
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.680]  politicians and mouthpiece media, one nation accepts the challenge to provide a better
[39:06.680 --> 39:08.920]  future for every day of Australia.
[39:08.920 --> 39:14.080]  And one nation is one of the patriot, anti-new world order parties growing very fast in Australia
[39:14.080 --> 39:17.680]  that's what they're panicking trying to bring in total tyranny, now the UN has openly announced
[39:17.680 --> 39:22.160]  their world ID digital system, I told you last year that it had been adopted by China,
[39:22.160 --> 39:25.320]  the UN was in charge of it and now they've officially rolled it out, I'll play that clip
[39:25.320 --> 39:29.520]  here in a moment but first, just like you see in Canada, just like you see in the Netherlands,
[39:29.520 --> 39:34.920]  just like you see in New Zealand and Australia, they're banning the first year 30% of the cows,
[39:34.920 --> 39:39.200]  the next year another 30% so the cows are all banned because they're bad, they have carbon
[39:39.200 --> 39:45.560]  in them, they put off methane, it's good for the environment and they're panicking and
[39:45.560 --> 39:50.080]  trying to accelerate this whole agenda, here's part of the clip.
[39:50.080 --> 39:56.440]  While belching is widely considered to be rude, livestock don't seem to care, all day,
[39:56.440 --> 40:01.400]  every day they burp, but it's not the act of burping that's the problem, it is the methane
[40:01.400 --> 40:08.040]  that they release into our atmosphere, the average cow emits a whopping 220 pounds of
[40:08.040 --> 40:14.880]  methane gas a day, well New Zealand is doing something about it by taxing burping livestock,
[40:14.880 --> 40:18.160]  Mike Drolet explains.
[40:18.160 --> 40:23.120]  With the population of just 5 million, New Zealand's carbon footprint is relatively
[40:23.120 --> 40:29.160]  small, it's okay, so first they tell you carbon dioxide's bad, now all gases out of animals
[40:29.160 --> 40:35.960]  is bad, all animals are burping and passing through the other end, flatulence, methane
[40:35.960 --> 40:40.320]  gas and other gases, this is insane, but it's total control and New Zealand's main export
[40:40.320 --> 40:46.600]  is what lamb, this is so sick, but what's in the hour with the UN officially and it's
[40:46.600 --> 40:51.120]  also in documents they put out, announcing the new global standard they've got for the
[40:51.120 --> 40:56.440]  World ID like Sri Lanka just put in with rationing of food and gas and it's a UN program running
[40:56.440 --> 40:58.440]  it, here it is.
[40:58.440 --> 41:04.280]  Digital transformation is changing the way we manage our data, our information, our interactions
[41:04.280 --> 41:10.160]  and our identities online, the United Nations is ready to digitally transform how it deals
[41:10.160 --> 41:15.760]  with identity, with a system to streamline information sharing, daily workflows, access
[41:15.760 --> 41:20.600]  to platforms and buildings, operating across agencies by providing its personnel with a
[41:20.600 --> 41:27.920]  universal system-wide identity solution, introducing the UN Digital ID, a unique and digital identity
[41:27.920 --> 41:32.080]  for UN personnel from the day you join to the day you part.
[41:32.080 --> 41:38.160]  All of your personal, HR, medical, travel, security, payroll and pension data in the
[41:38.160 --> 41:42.840]  palm of your hand, giving you full control on what you share and with whom.
[41:42.840 --> 41:48.240]  With blockchain and biometrics, the UN Digital ID makes verification efficient, secure,
[41:48.240 --> 41:52.120]  transparent, immutable, portable and universal.
[41:52.120 --> 41:56.360]  It's been piloted by different agencies and the UN Pension Fund where they've replaced
[41:56.360 --> 42:00.520]  current manual processes with certainty for who and where pension recipients say they
[42:00.520 --> 42:02.800]  are at any given time.
[42:02.800 --> 42:07.560]  Imagine original field officers just joined the UN, she uses the mobile app to obtain
[42:07.560 --> 42:13.280]  a digital wallet, stored securely in her smartphone and only accessible to her with biometrics.
[42:13.280 --> 42:17.720]  Even better than a physical wallet, she can store all her credentials issued by any UN
[42:17.720 --> 42:19.880]  organisation in her digital wallet.
[42:19.880 --> 42:25.640]  She has immediate access to core certificates, travel clearances from UN DSS, medical records
[42:25.640 --> 42:31.920]  from allergies to vaccinations, also making any transfer to another organisation a breeze.
[42:31.920 --> 42:36.480]  As innovation transforms the world, we can improve the way we manage our identities online.
[42:36.480 --> 42:41.640]  UN Digital IDs, a building block for digital cooperation, unlocking the promise of the
[42:41.640 --> 42:42.640]  SDGs.
[42:42.640 --> 42:48.840]  And then you see that rainbow crescent symbol, that's the W-E-F's great reset symbol.
[42:48.840 --> 42:52.720]  That's the new swastika, this is their global party and the UN admits they're going to use
[42:52.720 --> 42:56.000]  this all over the world for everybody else, they're just rolling it out first with their
[42:56.000 --> 42:57.000]  personnel.
[42:57.000 --> 42:58.000]  We'll be back with hour number two.
[42:58.000 --> 43:04.400]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being
[43:04.400 --> 43:09.200]  caught flat footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[43:09.200 --> 43:13.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of
[43:13.840 --> 43:19.120]  the battle, that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people
[43:19.120 --> 43:21.760]  like you've never done before.
[43:21.760 --> 43:26.600]  We have come so far together, please help keep us on the air, we're under massive attack
[43:26.600 --> 43:30.360]  right now, but we're going to win with your help, we're going to overcome this with your
[43:30.360 --> 43:32.520]  help and with God's blessing.
[43:32.520 --> 43:37.200]  Please go to infoworkstore.com and get this book, many, many, many years of research have
[43:37.200 --> 43:38.200]  gone into this.

[46:53.120 --> 47:11.040]  great creation, it is amazing and it funds the infowar.
[47:11.040 --> 47:23.680]  Our main energy systems are being shut off, we're being told it's to force us into a great
[47:23.680 --> 47:26.640]  transition, it's being done on purpose, then they change attack and say no, it's Putin's
[47:26.640 --> 47:29.040]  fault or it's the gas station's fault.
[47:29.040 --> 47:33.880]  Full part of this sick plan ladies and gentlemen, thanks for joining us on this live Sunday,
[47:33.880 --> 47:39.880]  531st broadcast, got some domestic news on the Build Back Better UN Great Reset Takeover,
[47:39.880 --> 47:43.840]  there's a big monologue Tucker did Friday that's really powerful, it's up on infowarstore.com
[47:43.840 --> 47:47.600]  but here's just 30 seconds of it.
[47:47.600 --> 47:53.960]  All the world's energy comes from fossil fuels, 80%, solar on the other hand provides 3% of
[47:53.960 --> 47:59.320]  the world's energy after many decades on the market and with the help of massive government
[47:59.320 --> 48:04.280]  subsidies, so it doesn't actually work, it doesn't come close to working, it's a boutique
[48:04.280 --> 48:06.200]  issue, it's ridiculous actually.
[48:06.200 --> 48:09.920]  So why is the Biden administration pushing this and who is benefiting from it?
[48:09.920 --> 48:13.680]  A lot of people are getting rich from it, that's for sure.
[48:13.680 --> 48:17.880]  Insiders are making trillions overall but that's only part of the plan, it's about cutting
[48:17.880 --> 48:18.880]  off infrastructure.
[48:18.880 --> 48:23.000]  Fossil fuels can barely supply what we need into the future and the infrastructure is
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.520]  built for them, there is no replacement, they blocked all the new energy technologies, solar
[48:28.520 --> 48:35.040]  and things are a joke compared to the technologies, they have completely and totally suppressed,
[48:35.040 --> 48:40.320]  they want a post-industrial world, they want you poor because they can't compete with populism
[48:40.320 --> 48:44.960]  and with capitalism, they can't compete in any way.
[48:44.960 --> 48:50.040]  And here's Manchin absurdly claims Democrats' green new deal, which is just the U.N.
[48:50.040 --> 48:56.320]  Build Back Better tax and spending spree will fight inflation, everybody thinks Mnuchin
[48:56.320 --> 49:01.280]  Manchin is a great guy, wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him, meanwhile gas
[49:01.280 --> 49:07.640]  sliding and Thomas Paul Krugman dismisses U.S. recession says term doesn't matter anymore.
[49:07.640 --> 49:15.120]  So first they said it wasn't a recession, now they say it just doesn't matter anymore.
[49:15.120 --> 49:21.840]  No farmers, no food, no life, they're protesting all over the world and all these leftist and
[49:21.840 --> 49:27.280]  people make jokes about their private jets and how great they are and they're not hurting
[49:27.280 --> 49:31.360]  the environment, I'm not against them, but then they say you shouldn't be able to have
[49:31.360 --> 49:36.040]  children, you shouldn't have a car, you shouldn't have air conditioning, as Obama seven years
[49:36.040 --> 49:41.200]  ago told Africans, pull the clip up, in fact you can't play the clip enough guys, find
[49:41.200 --> 49:44.720]  the clip for next hour, Obama tells Africans they have to get rid of air conditioning
[49:44.720 --> 49:51.280]  and cars, they can't have them, but I'll tell you who isn't getting rid of his large,
[49:51.280 --> 49:58.400]  heavy private jet that seats 40 people and that's U.S. Climates are John Kerry slammed
[49:58.400 --> 50:02.800]  over family private jet emissions, here is John Kerry.
[50:02.800 --> 50:07.880]  Rita, it's not just the celebrities but it's also the government, Norman Cloutoura, who
[50:07.880 --> 50:10.400]  are enjoying these private jets, John Kerry.
[50:10.400 --> 50:17.040]  Well yeah, John Kerry, the climates are, his private jet takes him all over to climate
[50:17.040 --> 50:21.440]  summits around the world, where he lectures everybody about how we can't possibly let
[50:21.440 --> 50:27.200]  these high crippling prices slow our progress to net zero.
[50:27.200 --> 50:34.840]  Of course, it is what we said before, all these policies are essentially, it's one rule
[50:34.840 --> 50:36.680]  for the elite, one rule for the rest of the country.
[50:36.680 --> 50:41.760]  And it is the elite because I love this line from the story, it was Kerry's family jet,
[50:41.760 --> 50:48.320]  imagine that having a family Gulf Street, like a family station wagon.
[50:48.320 --> 50:52.600]  And the whole point is, these globalists don't drive around in cars, they're on helicopters
[50:52.600 --> 51:03.000]  and jets constantly, like Drake will fly to his house 40 miles away on his, what, 767,
[51:03.000 --> 51:09.960]  what's that hold, like 80 people, so he's got a big jet, I mean a giant jet and he flies
[51:09.960 --> 51:15.760]  to his house 40 miles away because it takes him five minutes to get there versus an hour
[51:15.760 --> 51:19.000]  driving 40 miles in Canada.
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.320]  But he supports carbon taxes on you and your family.
[51:22.320 --> 51:27.800]  These people are greedy, evil, sickos, like Ted Turner's got what, six kids or whatever,
[51:27.800 --> 51:31.960]  he doesn't want you to be able to have any kids, he's got a fleet of jets and palaces
[51:31.960 --> 51:33.760]  everywhere.
[51:33.760 --> 51:36.920]  But where's the real attack happening, it's on our families.
[51:36.920 --> 51:41.080]  They targeted boys for the last 40 years with Ritalin and all these drugs that stunted their
[51:41.080 --> 51:45.960]  growth and made a mental patients as part of their attack on masculinity.
[51:45.960 --> 51:51.240]  And now they're targeting boys all over the world with puberty blockers particularly,
[51:51.240 --> 51:56.000]  which cause all sorts of health problems and all sorts of mental health problems and they're
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.480]  not even approved for children, but they're doing it, this is a rollout, so a lot of people
[51:59.480 --> 52:05.600]  say it's Tulsi Gabbard's good, well she's anti-war, she's first amendment, she's becoming
[52:05.600 --> 52:10.200]  pro-second amendment, I'm just saying we should invite Democrats, at least saying they support
[52:10.200 --> 52:13.360]  these ideas, I think she's better than most Republicans.
[52:13.360 --> 52:17.760]  There's a new article on FullWars.com by Jamie White, Tulsi Gabbard's transgender hormones
[52:17.760 --> 52:21.000]  or child abuse promoted by Biden administration.
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.760]  That's part of their big spending bill is billions to force us to push us, I gotta tell
[52:24.760 --> 52:29.320]  you, today I was driving around in Austin taking care of errands, I saw men dressed
[52:29.320 --> 52:33.680]  as women who all look super unhealthy out of their minds everywhere.
[52:33.680 --> 52:37.560]  They're men that don't have jobs, don't have futures on average and they've been told this
[52:37.560 --> 52:39.400]  is the trendy cool thing to do.
[52:39.400 --> 52:43.400]  Well if men want to get caught up in this web, that's their issue.
[52:43.400 --> 52:46.320]  And some people feel like they're a woman and they want to do it as an adult, I'm not
[52:46.320 --> 52:47.320]  against them.
[52:47.320 --> 52:48.320]  People are mad at Trump.
[52:48.320 --> 52:54.520]  He's having Caitlyn Jenner to one of his events with AOC, not AOC, the conservative
[52:54.520 --> 53:00.520]  version of AOC, but better, MTG, like what are you doing meeting with this person?
[53:00.520 --> 53:07.040]  Well at least Bruce Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, is against women having their sports taken
[53:07.040 --> 53:11.680]  over by men and he's against targeting children or she's against it.
[53:11.680 --> 53:19.360]  I don't care if for PR and hype Bruce Jenner got roped into that whole TV show he did.
[53:19.360 --> 53:22.320]  I don't support it but I'm not saying he doesn't have a right to do it.
[53:22.320 --> 53:26.400]  At least he's not going after our children overtly, but here's Tulsi Gabbard's playing
[53:26.400 --> 53:30.000]  it all out.
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.600]  The FDA made a disturbing but not at all surprising announcement just a few days ago about children's
[53:35.600 --> 53:36.600]  health.
[53:36.600 --> 53:41.160]  Now if you haven't heard about it or if you missed it, it's because the mainstream media
[53:41.160 --> 53:45.200]  and the Biden-Harris administration have been completely silent on it.
[53:45.200 --> 53:50.400]  This warning that the FDA issued was basically saying that puberty blockers can cause serious
[53:50.400 --> 53:53.080]  health risks for our kids.
[53:53.080 --> 53:58.160]  Unfortunately at almost the exact same time the FDA issued this warning, Biden-Harris
[53:58.160 --> 54:03.920]  administration officials were making public statements actively promoting the use of puberty
[54:03.920 --> 54:07.720]  blockers and irreversible surgeries for kids.
[54:07.720 --> 54:13.880]  Now let's be clear, this administration is dangerously promoting child abuse.
[54:13.880 --> 54:16.880]  Yeah, it's child abuse.
[54:16.880 --> 54:22.160]  So for me the Rubicon is targeting children with sterilization, be it castration or be
[54:22.160 --> 54:29.400]  it chemical sterilization, it is one of our red lines, we've got to stand for and stand
[54:29.400 --> 54:30.400]  against them pushing this.
[54:30.400 --> 54:35.440]  Now coming up next hour, we have a special guest at 15 after, but first you think puberty
[54:35.440 --> 54:40.520]  blockers are bad for children, they are now estimating that a million children six months
[54:40.520 --> 54:46.080]  and older have been injected just since the FDA approved the experimental deadly COVID
[54:46.080 --> 54:56.320]  shots for them and we've got some shocking numbers on this biological, chemical holocaust
[54:56.320 --> 54:57.320]  coming up.
[54:57.320 --> 55:01.920]  But first let me hit a couple of exciting items for all the TV viewers and all the radio
[55:01.920 --> 55:09.160]  listeners because freedom is incredibly popular and that's something that we should be celebrating.
[55:09.160 --> 55:15.820]  So can you get an overhead shot right here for me?
[55:15.820 --> 55:22.760]  This book, The Great Reset and The War for the World written by yours truly is now number
[55:22.760 --> 55:28.520]  35 on the World Charts ahead of Obama's new book and so much more.
[55:28.520 --> 55:33.960]  You can buy a signed copy or a regular copy, it comes out in late August at m4warstore.com.
[55:33.960 --> 55:38.080]  We certainly need the funds but it's an incredible book that lays out their entire battle plan,
[55:38.080 --> 55:42.680]  what is the plans for the Death Star, New World Order and how to take it down.
[55:42.680 --> 55:44.960]  That's available at m4warstore.com.
[55:44.960 --> 55:55.720]  Then we've got this, Top Movies on Apple, Alex's War is listed as number six.
[55:55.720 --> 56:00.960]  They have the top three on the top of the Apple chart and then they have the ones under
[56:00.960 --> 56:01.960]  that.
[56:01.960 --> 56:04.760]  We are number six on the Apple charts.
[56:04.760 --> 56:08.200]  You know, we don't make any money off this film and that's fine, I agreed to the filmmakers
[56:08.200 --> 56:11.840]  and I think they did a pretty fair job and it's 28 year history of our battle against
[56:11.840 --> 56:16.000]  New World Order and it's really going to wake a lot of folks up because they want to destroy
[56:16.000 --> 56:17.720]  me because they can destroy you.
[56:17.720 --> 56:22.320]  They can destroy a populist leader, they think they've got the keys to destroying us all
[56:22.320 --> 56:27.400]  but the fact that the book is number one in so many categories and number 30 something
[56:27.400 --> 56:31.840]  in the World Charts, the fact that Alex's War for weeks was number two, the Apple pre-order
[56:31.840 --> 56:35.080]  charts and many other charts, the fact that it's going on the top of the charts everywhere,
[56:35.080 --> 56:39.600]  another signal of the global great awakening, very, very exciting.
[56:39.600 --> 56:44.000]  I saw Twitter commenters were very upset like my neighbor's keeper.
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.160]  Barack Obama is pushing his book for free, yeah, the Karari's book for free in a promo
[56:49.160 --> 56:54.600]  and it's probably sitting there looking at Alex's, Jones's number one book instead and
[56:54.600 --> 56:59.680]  he's saying to himself, I could have hit him with a drone strike but no, the general said
[56:59.680 --> 57:01.280]  it would be too obvious.
[57:01.280 --> 57:02.280]  His book is good though.
[57:02.280 --> 57:08.520]  To the left is talking about killing me because liberty is so popular and because in the history
[57:08.520 --> 57:14.400]  charts we are number one and Barack Obama is number two for a week straight.
[57:14.400 --> 57:19.120]  Number 34, 35 I forget, we'll cover it next hour but that is a big deal and the World
[57:19.120 --> 57:23.760]  Charts want to salute you and thank you all until everybody buys many copies of the book

[58:01.360 --> 58:06.080]  looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with and we said what

[58:11.600 --> 58:16.840]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that

[58:49.880 --> 58:56.040]  We are now living in the void sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[58:56.040 --> 59:02.600]  we've known and what's to come and right now the most important thing to remember is don't
[59:02.600 --> 59:08.800]  panic stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship
[59:08.800 --> 59:11.280]  onto a safe sound course.

[59:16.920 --> 59:18.120]  society.
[59:18.120 --> 59:23.720]  All we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare the

[1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:59.280]  the world healthy they're full of polyunsaturated fat protein and micronutrients and sustainable
[1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:05.200]  I'm Nicole Kidman and I am going to eat a four course meal of bugs and they want you
[1:01:05.200 --> 1:01:12.000]  to eat these bugs inside a massive prison system that sees humanity as a cancer upon
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:17.360]  the earth for too long humanity has existed within dysfunctional and polluted cities that
[1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:26.560]  ignore nature now a revolution in civilization is taking place imagine a traditional city
[1:01:26.560 --> 1:01:33.080]  and consolidating its footprint designing to protect and enhance nature the line will
[1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:37.760]  be home to nine million residents and will be built with a footprint of just thirty four
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:43.440]  square kilometers and we are designing it to provide a healthier more sustainable quality
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:51.000]  of life the lines communities are organized in three dimensions residents have access
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  to all their daily needs within five minute walk neighborhoods and the lines infrastructure
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:03.240]  makes it possible to travel end to end in 20 minutes with no need for cars resulting in
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:10.080]  zero carbon emissions it is all completely bizarre but it's just the cover story for
[1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:17.720]  a massive depopulation agenda the COVID-19 vaccines are destroying the recipients reproductive
[1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:23.920]  and immune systems and killing people over time with mysterious structures growing within
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:29.600]  the vascular system we are now seeing this all over the world and it's just getting
[1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:36.240]  started there is a whole cultural movement now emerging from the shadows that wants humanity
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:44.160]  to collectively commit suicide this anti-human cult has been around for decades and outside
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:51.320]  of academia have had to tread quietly because much of humanity is opposed to mass murder
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:56.640]  but now that we are in the midst of this cult's massive depopulation effort they are coming
[1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:02.560]  out into the open to convince us that it would be best for most of us to die we cannot hide
[1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:08.520]  away from human population growth because you know it underlies so many of the other
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:14.920]  problems all these things we talk about wouldn't be a problem if there was the size of population
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:19.440]  that there was five hundred years ago all the religious groups that are against me because
[1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:28.920]  I'm talking about population they want more souls I want less on the planet the world
[1:03:28.920 --> 1:03:36.160]  economic forum has become the public domain of the anti-human cults depopulation agenda
[1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:44.080]  and all of pop culture is on board from Hollywood to the holy sea planet all the utopia that
[1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:52.640]  we've been given the overpopulation their agenda is disguised as environmentalism so
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:58.680]  that all who oppose it now can be shamed and when the mass starvation begins to overwhelm
[1:03:58.680 --> 1:04:05.200]  the population the sentimental environmentalists can all be blamed because of course this has
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:11.640]  nothing to do with the environment Boris Johnson's father Stanley Johnson is a member of this
[1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:17.480]  cult and he wrote that the world's population needs to be cut down to a more manageable
[1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:24.160]  number and this is what it's all about a more manageable number because these psychopaths
[1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:30.720]  see the rest of us as their property to manage and call accordingly but humanity still has
[1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:37.080]  a choice and we don't have to die in a prison death factory eating bugs we could choose
[1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:44.200]  freedom but time is running out reporting for info wars this is great Reese if you want
[1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:49.360]  to live learn about the new world order learn about the great reset learn about the transhumanists
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:53.840]  and say no to every part of their agenda there's not much time left folks we're already in
[1:04:53.840 --> 1:05:02.480]  the attack phase we'll be right back seven months ago in December of 2021 we launched
[1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:08.600]  the first three-coin founding member series George Washington slaying the dragon then
[1:05:08.600 --> 1:05:12.880]  we launched the tree of liberty coin and finally the second amendment come and take it Molon

[1:05:53.200 --> 1:06:08.960]  available at 1776 point dot com live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:34.720]  we're now into hour number two of this historic Sunday July 31st Worldwide Transmission I'm
[1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:39.000]  your host Alex Jones special guest joining us tell you about when they join us next segment
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:45.400]  so Tulsi Gabbards that in the weight of what she's done on both sides I would say I believe
[1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:48.960]  it's a good person finding her soul well it's better and better I don't think she's a Trojan
[1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:54.160]  horse I think she's the real deal and I just see a beautiful soul in her and I just see
[1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:58.720]  her waking up and transcending I have been told by folks very close to her we haven't
[1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:03.080]  reached out to her that she is a listener but we need to be ready for the left to wake
[1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:09.240]  up and not be part of what they've been part of she's come out just like Elon Musk has
[1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:14.400]  against the depopulation agenda against the new world order and against hormone blockers
[1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:19.000]  and children which in all the studies cause massive health problems and she came out and
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:23.720]  said why has the FDA we played it last hour authorized something that in the literature
[1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:36.800]  is highly destructive not to mention it makes you not even grow stunts your growth why well
[1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:42.760]  it's because the FDA has always been corrupt but now it's completely weaponized you know
[1:07:42.760 --> 1:07:47.680]  I was actually proud of the FDA two years ago when they were trying to authorize the
[1:07:47.680 --> 1:07:52.240]  poison gene therapy injections that will play clips of her in a moment from the head of
[1:07:52.240 --> 1:08:02.160]  Pfizer making incredible statements this week when the majority of the board of the FDA
[1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:08.320]  top scientist said no to this vaccine so they had that board resigned or those that were
[1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:14.360]  against it then the next board said no to booster shots and no to 16 and below so they
[1:08:14.360 --> 1:08:23.120]  made that board resigned then they said more booster shots and six and up is all on record
[1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:30.240]  they resigned and finally they got a board the board before last member said well we
[1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:34.920]  just decided to see what would happen no testing and they started laughing remember that one
[1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:43.400]  of the board members and so they finally got a board unanimously voted six months now to
[1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:48.000]  give them a shot that annihilates your immune system and is linked to heart attacks cancer
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:51.840]  infertility you name it and all the studies are out now even Tucker Carlson showing the
[1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:59.600]  mainline studies that lesson and even Brett bar or whatever same as on Fox got those clips
[1:08:59.600 --> 1:09:03.320]  I mean it's just everything we said two years ago has been proven right is now in the open
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:07.440]  we had CDC documents it would destroy your immune system and cause cancer and blood clots
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:13.200]  in October of 2020 I mean it's not like I'm just up here saying this stuff we had the chief
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:17.200]  scientist at Pfizer retired a year before this happened Michael Yedon coming out predicting
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:23.320]  every damn bit of it and filing emergency lawsuits in the European Union he says it's
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:31.480]  a depopulation plan world government he was in there with them so when you look at that
[1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:37.040]  you understand this agenda so look at these headlines Biden test positive for COVID again
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:43.240]  in two weeks contested twice in positive goes back into isolation Biden's back to back COVID
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:47.520]  diagnosis undermined administration's narrative of his health the supposed drug he took to
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:55.480]  stop reinfection didn't work and the insert says it doesn't work but he said it's 100%
[1:09:55.480 --> 1:10:04.880]  they still push it though ineffective Pfizer COVID drug tax avoid doesn't work big study
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:11.320]  on this UK government report and excess deaths data from COVID vaccination says on average
[1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:17.160]  takes five months to kill you but it's going to kill you DC schools expand COVID vaccine
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:21.680]  mandate unlike most other districts yeah it's illegal to make people take an experimental
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:27.160]  shot but they're doing it mainly black kids making the vaccine experience easier for your
[1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:34.760]  little ones reports the news NBC and it goes on and on look at this portal black child
[1:10:34.760 --> 1:10:40.280]  being injected with that is going to mess him up for life I mean this is sick ladies
[1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:47.520]  and gentlemen quadruple vax Biden test positive for COVID but I'm vaccinated COVID recovered
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:53.440]  Jovovich Jovovich can't play in the US open he's apparently too big a risk the US health
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:57.960]  care system remember all these countries have forced injection and to get in the US now you've
[1:10:57.960 --> 1:11:05.240]  got to have it unless you're an illegal alien know that Jovovich winning this year's Wimbledon
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:10.960]  after everything went wrong is the stuff of legend Jovovich said I want to take a moment
[1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:15.480]  and say to all of you how grateful I am to see so many messages of support and love more
[1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:19.800]  around the world these days it I wasn't expecting it and that's why it feels so mind blowing
[1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:24.720]  just wanted to say thank you that he's a real leader meanwhile Chicago health care worker
[1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:29.400]  class action lawsuit wins 10.3 million dollars they're being fired for not taking an experimental
[1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:34.000]  shot it's illegal and then I see these articles this is where it really is chilling every day
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:40.160]  now hundreds of them on the sides of buses they say heart attacks hit children now yeah
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:44.840]  heart attacks are up several thousand percentage points and children here we go experts now
[1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:52.920]  worn COVID I'm having a 40 and slip here we go experts now worn cold showers are causing
[1:11:52.920 --> 1:11:58.840]  heart attacks in young adults other articles about a college student drop dead skinny and
[1:11:58.840 --> 1:12:06.480]  healthy because he was so happy he got a good grade he died of joy college basketball star
[1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:11.560]  Derek Gray dead at 20 collapses heart attack on the floor 27 year old triathlete doctor
[1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:16.920]  in Canada dies four days after she collapses while swimming fifth GTA doctor dies within
[1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:24.080]  two weeks and it goes on and on and on young doctors 27 year olds die after taking the
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:30.320]  shot there's another doctor died in the same town in Canada ever taking the shot CDC unusually
[1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:34.680]  large number of newborns infected with potentially life-threatening virus that could trigger fever
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:41.520]  poor feeding and seizures and the mothers have been injected and it goes on and on and
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:47.320]  on I've got stacks of death certificates you name it of children and people that took the
[1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:55.800]  shots it is a holocaust and they're just normalizing the whole thing in real time but I want to
[1:12:55.800 --> 1:13:04.400]  air these clips this is the head of Pfizer there's a bunch of these Pfizer clips we got
[1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:11.120]  two clips Pfizer CEO about the courage it took yeah let's play that the courage the courage
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:16.320]  to push an untested shot they really secretly tested knowing what it would do cause heart
[1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:21.760]  attacks infertility here he is rolling the dice he claims he would roll the dice launching
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:29.880]  this nanotech gene therapy weapon here it is well that's quite an accomplishment is
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:35.920]  for especially for a company as old and as large and you mentioned courage making the
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:41.200]  decision to pursue the mRNA technology was really bold and risky and you were actually
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:46.920]  an original skeptic so share with us how you made that decision especially given the stakes
[1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:58.200]  basically was trusting my people when they told me our mRNA is our solution to what you
[1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:05.900]  are asking us to do which is we want a vaccine very effective very safe very quickly I was
[1:14:05.900 --> 1:14:12.400]  puzzled that was very counterintuitive decision you know Moderna is very good in doing mRNA
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:16.520]  so for them the decision would be only are we doing a vaccine for COVID or not would
[1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:20.440]  never be what technology to use because this is what they are very good in our case you
[1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:26.280]  were using we were very good in multiple different technological platform that could give a vaccine
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:33.800]  so that was the number one decision that we had to make and there was no other medicine
[1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:42.320]  or vaccine that was successful by the time that we made the decision that's enough so
[1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:47.720]  so they lie to you and say it's effective they say it's tested he has courage to release
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:54.040]  it on us then it doesn't work and even Burke's Trump's cop advisor now says we lied to Trump
[1:14:54.040 --> 1:14:58.000]  we knew it wouldn't work so they knew it wouldn't work and they did it but what does it work
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:06.120]  at a racing your immune system absolutely incredible we're gonna come back with a live

[1:20:37.120 --> 1:20:42.000]  By the way, that clip of Obama staying van cars and air conditioners for Africans will
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:49.800]  play that coming up to about 20 minutes. But right now I've known this guy probably 20 years.
[1:20:49.800 --> 1:20:53.720]  They've had the most courage out there to publish books that nobody else will publish
[1:20:53.720 --> 1:20:58.720]  and they become one of the most successful publishing houses in North America, if not
[1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:04.000]  the world, at Sky Horse Publishing. And they approached me six, seven, eight months ago
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:08.960]  and said, we want you to write a great reset book. You're really the expert on it. And
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:12.600]  they approached me before about writing books and I hadn't done it. And I said, well, if
[1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:17.200]  I can get recordings together and all the documents and put together an outline, can
[1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:22.000]  you guys help me get it done? And they did it and it came out even more powerful than
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:26.520]  I thought it would. And we worked a lot on tweaking it and, you know, adding up to date
[1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:32.280]  last minute stuff. This book comes out in late August. It's already in the top of the
[1:21:32.280 --> 1:21:36.640]  top 50 charts on Amazon, number one in more than 20 areas like world history and history
[1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:42.920]  above Obama's new book above Herari's world government book. The great reset. I wanted
[1:21:42.920 --> 1:21:47.000]  to get him on to talk about this because not only was Alex's war a film I didn't
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:50.520]  produce, but I think it's a fair film shows the good and bad, the ugly. Not only was it
[1:21:50.520 --> 1:21:55.760]  number two in the last two weeks on pre-order, now it's in the top six. It's the sixth hottest
[1:21:55.760 --> 1:22:01.680]  thing on Apple iTunes right below all these major Hollywood films that just came out.
[1:22:01.680 --> 1:22:07.080]  As you can see, the new Lord of the Rings, the all these new horror movies, we are number
[1:22:07.080 --> 1:22:11.400]  six. There's three on the top and then you can see we're right there. So that shows people
[1:22:11.400 --> 1:22:14.920]  are really hungry for the truth. I don't make any money off Alex's war. We need money right
[1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:19.360]  now. We're in bankruptcy. We could shut down, but, but I want to explain what bankruptcy
[1:22:19.360 --> 1:22:25.360]  means the top bankruptcy. This is reorganization bankruptcy to stay open. So with all these
[1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:29.760]  lawsuits and all these attacks, the court will see how much money we have and we'll
[1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:33.960]  see we don't have the 150 million they're asking for. We don't have five million extra
[1:22:33.960 --> 1:22:37.760]  dollars. We don't have two million extra dollars. Our whole operating capital is less than four
[1:22:37.760 --> 1:22:42.120]  million and a company this big with employees got to buy product out in the future and everything.
[1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:47.360]  That's insolvency. So if you buy the products at infowarshore.com, you buy the book there,
[1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:51.560]  you can get a signed copy. I really want you to buy it on Amazon. It says number one, that
[1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:55.280]  will keep us on air. We will not go anywhere. That's why this bankruptcy, but it's just
[1:22:55.280 --> 1:23:01.160]  so they can't lie and say, I've got myself, you know, Jones made $76 million in 2019.
[1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:07.280]  We didn't gross that in 2019. These are lies and we're wholesalers. So I may sell $30 million
[1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:12.080]  of food in a year. We get less than 10 million in operational funds and because we have our
[1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:17.160]  own bandwidth and our own cost hundreds of thousands a month in cost for just the bandwidth.
[1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:23.000]  We are very successful five, six, seven, eight million videos watched today that cost money.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:28.200]  So we are in the fight with the tip of the spear and I just want to salute Tony Lyons
[1:23:28.200 --> 1:23:35.400]  because this guy is fearless and this guy took my recordings and my research and the
[1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:40.960]  clips I sent him and how I wanted it done and made it better than I could have. Okay.
[1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:45.040]  And so this is the great reset book coming into the next segment. We'll air a little
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:50.720]  trailer that Steve Bannon put out saying the most important intellectual book for freedom
[1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:57.600]  since the founding fathers. And I got to say it, the credit goes to Tony Lyons and his
[1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:01.600]  researchers that we're going to mention here. It's not ghost written. It's my recordings.
[1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:07.120]  It's my words. It's my clips. I sent them, but he had lawyers involved. You name it.
[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:12.520]  They took it next level. This thing is the Death Star plans and how to defeat the globalist.
[1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:17.160]  So Tony Lyons, we want to salute you. He's the president, publisher of Sky Horse and
[1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:23.760]  an attorney was publisher at Lyons Press between 2007 and 2004. He founded Sky Horse 2006 has
[1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:27.560]  been involved in every aspect of the bush publishing process starting with a small team
[1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:31.640]  of people, some of whom still work at Sky Horse because I know him. Yeah, it's true. Tony has
[1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:36.640]  steadily built a company from the startup, an increasingly prominent mid-sized publisher.
[1:24:36.640 --> 1:24:42.280]  And he joins us right now. Sky Horse Publishing dot com. Tony, all I can say is congratulations.
[1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:46.280]  And gosh, I'm glad I find that a lot of other book deals I turned down. Thank God I was
[1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:52.520]  you because what you did, what we did together is simply is groundbreaking. And I believe
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:58.560]  if people get behind it, it'll go to number one. And culturally, that's so important.
[1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:05.080]  I think that's true. You know, this is the most controversial book coming out this year.
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:09.840]  There's no question the most controversial book, they're going to try to shut it down.
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:14.560]  They don't want you to read this book. They're afraid of the revelations in this book, and
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:20.120]  they're going to censor it in every conceivable way. So the thing to do now is to buy it right
[1:25:20.120 --> 1:25:27.040]  now, push it to the top of the list, so that everybody has to carry it, that they know
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:31.840]  that this book is there, that it's not going to go away, that you're not going to go away,
[1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:36.800]  that you're a patriot, that you're fighting for what's right, and that we don't deserve
[1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:42.920]  censorship in this country. We have fought and died for freedom in this country, and
[1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:47.400]  we need to fight to protect freedom in this country. And that's what your book is about.
[1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:52.560]  It's about combating the great reset. This is a book that people need to read. If they
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:57.360]  disagree with it, if people disagree with it, they should make an argument against it.
[1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:01.840]  They shouldn't censor it. They shouldn't be platform it. They shouldn't write hit pieces
[1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:08.200]  against you. They should buy the great reset and the war for the world by Alex Jones, and
[1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:13.760]  they should decide for themselves. People should decide for themselves what they believe,
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:18.160]  and if they have better arguments, they should make those arguments. But this is an important
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:24.240]  book, and I highly recommend it. And buying it is an act of rebellion, because like I
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:28.200]  said, they're going to try to shut it down in every conceivable way.
[1:26:28.200 --> 1:26:32.840]  Well, all I can say is, as the edits came in the last six months, as we wrote chapter
[1:26:32.840 --> 1:26:37.200]  to chapter, and I thought I'd do everything about the great reset, but your team would
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:40.880]  recommend this, recommend that. Hey, do you see this? What about this idea? And just this
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:46.400]  collaboration, I love to say I wrote this book 100% myself. No, you guys really, I can't
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:51.520]  believe how much more powerful you guys made it. And then I was reading this, the final
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:55.760]  version, like two weeks ago, and then Steve Bannack came out and said, this is the most
[1:26:55.760 --> 1:27:00.960]  important book since the founding fathers, I sat back and I went, it really is the like,
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:04.800]  like I said, it's the blueprint of the Death Star. This is how they're doing it, and how
[1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:09.520]  to stop them. I am just, thank you so much, Tony. How the hell with your team because
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:14.600]  you took my recordings and 20 hours recordings and all the stuff I sent you and all the meetings
[1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:17.520]  we had. And you did this, this is incredible.
[1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:23.680]  Thanks so much. Yeah, I mean, this is a book that's already got great blurbs by, you know,
[1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:30.400]  Tucker Carlson, Mike Adams, Dr. Mercola, lots of people. I mean, this is an important book.
[1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:35.640]  You know, it's, it's a book that people have to read and think through. And they have to
[1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:40.920]  realize that it's not going to be covered in any mainstream newspaper. It might not be
[1:27:40.920 --> 1:27:43.800]  available in, you know, libraries.
[1:27:43.800 --> 1:27:48.880]  Yeah, Tucker Carlson gave it a great quote. I mean, it's awesome.
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:54.680]  Tucker Carlson, you know, said, let's see what he said exactly. He said, why are the
[1:27:54.680 --> 1:28:01.360]  most powerful people in the country trying to silence Alex Jones? Read this book and
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:07.600]  decide for yourself. So that's the thing, read this book, read the great reset and decide
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:14.040]  for yourself whether the things that you Alex Jones have described are really happening
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:19.120]  and whether, you know, we can all get together to fight them to fight for freedom. So this
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:24.520]  is like a battle cry. This is a book that people need to read and they need to recognize
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:29.120]  that a lot of people are going to come out with hit pieces with reasons not to read it.
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:33.200]  They're going to not address any of the claims in the book. They're just going to go after
[1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:39.640]  you personally, Alex. They might come after me. But you know, the reason that we publish
[1:28:39.640 --> 1:28:44.720]  books and the reason that people should read books is to learn something new is to get
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:50.440]  out of your own kind of footprints and look at things and really think them through for
[1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:51.440]  yourself.
[1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:56.840]  We live in a democracy and we can't just let ideas that are totally stay right there.
[1:28:56.840 --> 1:29:01.880]  You're on. I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer or
[1:29:01.880 --> 1:29:06.720]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire. Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these
[1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:11.520]  profiles. You see it every year. 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different
[1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:16.840]  tax returns, 50 different answers. And almost all of them just screw you over, especially
[1:29:16.840 --> 1:29:20.920]  the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't
[1:29:20.920 --> 1:29:25.200]  want the general public understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important
[1:29:25.200 --> 1:29:31.280]  situation with inflation, all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do
[1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:35.240]  things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep on your money. We wouldn't
[1:29:35.240 --> 1:29:41.000]  even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years. The only way

[1:29:57.440 --> 1:30:02.800]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[1:30:02.800 --> 1:30:07.760]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages. And the studies are all clear. The number
[1:30:07.760 --> 1:30:17.040]  one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom. And the number
[1:30:17.040 --> 1:30:22.600]  one issue men have is erectile dysfunction. Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes
[1:30:22.600 --> 1:30:26.880]  about this because they don't want people having lasting, good, loving relationships.
[1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:33.960]  They want to break up society. We are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement

[1:34:01.400 --> 1:34:05.480]  in the world. Here's a little two minute piece with Steve Bannon last week talking about
[1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:13.480]  the great reset in the new world order. I gotta tell you, this book, the great reset
[1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:17.440]  in the war for the world, the left in the mainstream media are going to have to sit
[1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:24.040]  there and we've got to force them to respond to this book. This book is that important.
[1:34:24.040 --> 1:34:29.400]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter. If you compare the finest and I'll tell you
[1:34:29.400 --> 1:34:34.800]  to take MIT technology review, you take science, take all these magazines and journals, add
[1:34:34.800 --> 1:34:40.760]  the electronic part of it and you know, NPR, PBS, all of it. I'll take, I'll match up
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:46.000]  and I will go through and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:49.800]  body has put out there. And if you're a sent in a human being and just watching it, you
[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:52.840]  say, well, got Alex Jones as a head of this, not only that, he kind of explained it.
[1:34:52.840 --> 1:34:59.560]  We're just in this huge revolution against choice and free will and normal technological
[1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:05.160]  development and adoption of technology that empowers humanity. Instead, they want adoption
[1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:10.680]  of technology, forced adoption, world IDs, global social credit scores, carbon taxes
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:13.840]  that dominate and monitor every facet of our lives.
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:20.240]  You make the case of what the not just the new world order is, but using this great reset
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:24.840]  to really take up, there's whole idea of control and authoritarianism.
[1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:29.680]  They have decided to trigger a controlled collapse and then bring in a new dark age
[1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:35.680]  to control the general public where they will be in their Elysium fields. There is no new
[1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:39.960]  technology coming in. They're blocking that. And so really, they're just imploding things
[1:35:39.960 --> 1:35:44.440]  under the cloud pivot model show that they can't get that control over us.
[1:35:44.440 --> 1:35:46.480]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:52.040]  He has presented tons of valid evidence and facts that I think have been really, really
[1:35:52.040 --> 1:35:58.320]  important to raising consciousness to what the sort of technocratic global elite really
[1:35:58.320 --> 1:35:59.800]  want to do.
[1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:05.600]  The true thing that you've done, which is stunning, if you look at the evidence of that
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:10.600]  and the facts, you are one of the great thinkers of this. That is very rare. You've got to
[1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:16.240]  go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that this book, The Great Reset in
[1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:20.280]  the War for the World, I'm telling you, everybody in America, the people that hate Alex Jones
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:24.360]  the most have to read this book. This is no beach read. You're not going to be flipping
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:27.560]  pages or you're going to be having a pen out and you're going to be underlining stuff.
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:28.560]  It's amazing.
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:35.080]  The Great Reset in the War for the World by Alex Jones, available now on Amazon or
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:47.320]  inforstore.com and let me show viewers a screenshot we've got right here. This is in United States
[1:36:47.320 --> 1:36:52.960]  history, in world history and in history period. It's been number one the last few days ahead
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:58.920]  of Obama and Michael, I mean, Michelle Obama. Was that Michael Obama? He called her Michael
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:05.200]  but Michelle Obama. This is the number one book right now ahead of Obama. They are so
[1:37:05.200 --> 1:37:09.600]  pissed off about this. It's a vote against their tyranny. Get it at Amazon.com. Sky Horse
[1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:13.280]  Publishers The Great Reset in the War for the World. Tony Lyons, you are kicking ass
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:17.680]  here. I can feel your excitement. You predicted to me this would happen and you've backed
[1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:21.680]  us and we appreciate you. You're a major imprint of a major publisher. You're in stores
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:26.320]  everywhere. This book is so powerful. This is really going to get on record what we stand
[1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:29.520]  for. So again, thank you so much for coming to me with this project saying you're the
[1:37:29.520 --> 1:37:33.480]  great reset expert. You should do this. Please continue.
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:38.000]  Let me say one last thing. So The Great Reset in the War for the World is the book that
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:43.360]  the government doesn't want you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:48.400]  to control your life, the big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book. They
[1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:54.280]  want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want that and
[1:37:54.280 --> 1:37:59.600]  Alex Jones doesn't want that. And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:04.800]  sort of playbook for how to fight against it. And so by buying this book, you're going
[1:38:04.800 --> 1:38:10.000]  to prove that censorship doesn't work, that freedom is alive in this country. This is
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:15.360]  essential reading. And you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship
[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:19.880]  kicks in. It's not going to be available in bookstores. It's not going to be available
[1:38:19.880 --> 1:38:25.160]  in libraries. They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can,
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:29.840]  but they're not going to be able to do it. Prove that censorship doesn't work. Buy The
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:34.640]  Great Reset. Thank you, Alex Jones. I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate
[1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:37.680]  you writing this book and getting the information out there.
[1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:42.440]  I got a few more questions. I know you got to go, but Tony, you predicted it could go
[1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:47.760]  to number one this early a month before it comes out or a little less than a month. How
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:51.960]  big a deal is it right now that it's in the top 50 on the overall global charts and number
[1:38:51.960 --> 1:38:58.560]  one in so many areas like media, communications, history, politics, fascism? I mean, this is
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:01.280]  ahead of Rise and Fall of Third Reich right now.
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:07.960]  Sure. I mean, this is going to prove, like I said, that censorship, that globalism, that
[1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:13.640]  fascism, that these are things people want to fight against. People see it now. You know,
[1:39:13.640 --> 1:39:18.140]  maybe for the first time, lots of people are seeing what's going on and they're rebelling
[1:39:18.140 --> 1:39:23.440]  against it and they see your book coming out and they're flocking to it. So it really
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:29.640]  is an amazing thing that at this point, so early on, it's already number one in so many
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:35.400]  categories and it's selling so well. It's in the top 50 books in the world and I'm sure
[1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:40.080]  that if your viewers go out and buy it, they can send it to number one where it should
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:41.080]  be.
[1:39:41.080 --> 1:39:44.680]  What do you predict will happen if it hits number one?
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:49.240]  I think that it's going to make a lot of people angry and frustrated and they're going to
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:54.760]  be a whole series of hit pieces and all kinds of newspapers and magazines and they're going
[1:39:54.760 --> 1:39:58.800]  to go against you and they're going to go against me, but they're not going to answer
[1:39:58.800 --> 1:40:03.400]  any of the allegations in the book. They're not going to address the issues. They're just
[1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:08.560]  going to try to shut it down. They're going to use the playbook of ignore the book, ignore
[1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:14.680]  the arguments and just go after the people. So it's cancel culture, it's censorship and
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:16.480]  we have to fight that at all costs.
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:20.680]  Well, that's right. Neil Strauss, four years ago, approached me, one of the top authors
[1:40:20.680 --> 1:40:28.760]  in the world and he said, look, I got a major publisher, one of the top managers in the
[1:40:28.760 --> 1:40:33.040]  world, agents. He said, it's going to happen. And I was on the phone with you three and
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:38.800]  all those other people and they fired the guy and CNN got the book proposal and they shut
[1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:43.320]  it down. He said, he never imagined that could happen. How have you had the position and
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:47.600]  the history of the courage with all the other deals you've got? What made Tony Lyons of
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:51.400]  Sky Horse Publishing decide to really take this bold move? Because this is the boldest
[1:40:51.400 --> 1:40:55.320]  move could be taken in publishing. That's not hype. That's true.
[1:40:55.320 --> 1:41:04.600]  Yeah. So my general feeling is that I'm more afraid of not publishing books that are important,
[1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:10.040]  that are controversial, that make people think. You know, where people look at this title
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:14.760]  and they think, I'm going to disagree with all of this. Well, that's a really good reason
[1:41:14.760 --> 1:41:19.520]  to buy a book. That's a good reason to buy the great reset. Even if you're sure you're
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:24.840]  going to disagree with all of it, read it, think about it. That's what happens in a democratic
[1:41:24.840 --> 1:41:32.200]  country. This is not a country that was built on censorship and the future of this country
[1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:37.960]  can't be shutting things down. So I'm more afraid of shutting things down than I am of
[1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:45.360]  any consequences that can come to me from publishing good, solid books that have important
[1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:50.800]  arguments in them that people, like I said, they can disagree. But that's what's supposed
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:56.120]  to happen in this country. People can disagree, but they can't just shut things down. They
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:42:02.000]  can't just stifle dissent. They can't stifle ideas. And we have to stop them from doing
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.520]  that. And that's what we're trying to do.
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:10.400]  Gut level. This could be the new 1984, but a nonfiction. I mean, I think it's got that
[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:15.240]  potential. And how are you gut level feeling?
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:21.320]  I think that this book could be the number one book in the next month. And if that happens,
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:26.640]  like I said, it's going to make a lot of people angry. But you know, that's the thing is that
[1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:30.520]  people are saying now, so many people, you can read this in the New York Times all the
[1:42:30.520 --> 1:42:35.760]  time that you're not supposed to give a platform to people who you disagree with. But you know,
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:41.680]  what is journalism? I mean, journalism writers in general, they're supposed to write things
[1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:46.840]  that are complicated, that are new, that are interesting, that challenge the beliefs of
[1:42:46.840 --> 1:42:51.400]  the people reading them. So why would you want to only buy books where you know what's
[1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:53.360]  going to be in there? You agree with all of it.
[1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:54.880]  Exactly. Tony Lyons, great job.
[1:42:54.880 --> 1:43:02.880]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here. But humanity is not being caught
[1:43:02.880 --> 1:43:08.120]  flat footed because of info wars and because of your support. Ladies and gentlemen, it
[1:43:08.120 --> 1:43:13.280]  is now more important than ever, as we reach the critical heart of the battle, that you

[1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:15.320]  the new world order, it's Alex Jones. Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming
[1:47:15.320 --> 1:47:29.040]  to you live from the frontlines of the info war. So they're pushing digital IDs again and
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:34.800]  here's Tony Blair, the former prime minister of UK. Are you the prime minister of UK or
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:43.600]  the prime minister of England? I don't know. It's got to be the UK, right? Okay. The telegraph,
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:49.400]  Tony Blair launches new drive for digital ID cards to tackle illegal immigration. Why
[1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:55.920]  is this interesting? Because he keeps changing the reason why we need it. Whatever is going
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:48:03.880]  on in the moment in the culture is the reason why we need it. Tony Blair has launched a new
[1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:10.080]  drive for ID cards as he claims it would tackle illegal immigration. A report by the former
[1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:14.480]  prime minister's institute published on Friday said the weakest link in the government's
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:19.440]  approach to migration was its failure to crack down on a black market filled by unscrupulous
[1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:24.520]  employers giving jobs to illegal migrants. So he knows that's a hot button issue so he's
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:28.880]  going to now try to push that button in you to get you to go along with ID cards because
[1:48:28.880 --> 1:48:33.560]  if you think it's going to hurt illegal immigrants, you'll be for it.
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:39.080]  Why did he, I mean, since when is he against illegal immigrants, the biggest neoliberal,
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:45.040]  though, since when would he be against that? That's so suspicious. Isn't he a big global
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:49.760]  market, lower the wages for every one guy? He's certainly a neoliberal. Well, here's
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:54.640]  what he said about, here's the old reason he used to give about why we need digital
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:55.640]  IDs.
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:49:01.800]  You can create a digital ID today that is much more easily protected so you can deal
[1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:06.800]  with a lot of the privacy and surveillance issues that worry people. But it's a natural
[1:49:06.800 --> 1:49:12.400]  evolution of the way that we're going to use technology in any event.
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:19.880]  It's a natural, this is just natural. This is how nature intended things to be. Nature
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:26.520]  works this way. Nature's a valent state. Nature invented this app. Here we go.
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:30.560]  Look, if a tree falls in the woods, is there a sound? Of course, because someone is always
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:35.640]  listening and watching. Use technology in any event to transact
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:40.080]  daily life. And this COVID crisis gives us an additional reason for doing that because
[1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:46.040]  it's because of COVID. They said COVID would bring in the world
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:50.800]  ID and the carbon tax. We told you 32 months ago, and it all happened just like we told
[1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:56.200]  you because we know who the enemy is. Thank you for joining us. Owen Shroyer is set to
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:50:03.400]  take over from 6 to 8 p.m. with Sunday Live, which is a very powerful Sunday broadcast we
[1:50:03.400 --> 1:50:08.120]  do. We've cut out all the network ads for radio and TV stations. We only have six minutes
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:13.680]  of ads an hour for our local affiliates. That's really the model we're going to go to soon
[1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:18.600]  closer to podcasts. We're still on 400 plus radio stations and TV stations and cable stations.
[1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:23.560]  They have on average 14 minutes of ads an hour. But if we simply take our seven minutes
[1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:28.480]  of ads out or so, you have six minutes of ads during the main show and I guess a minute
[1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:32.720]  at the end of the hour. So Owen is going to take over, but at the
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:39.480]  beginning of it, we're going to air a very powerful program out of the UK, out of Scotland
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:46.880]  particularly, where a Neil Oliver in 9 and a half minutes absolutely does the best job
[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:54.680]  in a very short clip that I've seen of succinctly describing the anti-human great reset. So
[1:50:54.680 --> 1:50:59.960]  we see leaders in Russia, leaders in South Africa, leaders in Brazil, leaders in Mexico,
[1:50:59.960 --> 1:51:07.160]  leaders in the US, leaders in all over the world nailing it and exposing what's happening.
[1:51:07.160 --> 1:51:11.320]  So if your local station doesn't carry Sunday live, they should, but everybody should tune
[1:51:11.320 --> 1:51:15.640]  in to infowars.com, forward slash show and man dot video. We know it takes over, but
[1:51:15.640 --> 1:51:23.080]  we're going to air at the start of the next hour. This report that needs to go viral.
[1:51:23.080 --> 1:51:27.760]  I saw it on Twitter a week ago with like 500 views. I know it was on UK television. I'm
[1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:32.680]  reached millions, but I'm like, wow, this needs 10 million views. Cause this guy's like
[1:51:32.680 --> 1:51:38.480]  Alex Jones without the caffeine and Alex Jones with caffeine is a great thing, but it's good
[1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:45.120]  to have this classic Scott. I mean, he just looks like the archetypal badass Scott up
[1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:51.800]  there laying it out. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the leadership we need. And that just
[1:51:51.800 --> 1:51:57.120]  makes me sleep at a night knowing there's folks like Neil Oliver out there. So that
[1:51:57.120 --> 1:52:05.120]  is coming up start of Sunday live with Owen shroyer here in just a few minutes. Okay.
[1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:09.000]  The UN announced world IDs last year, but they've officially rolled it out now. We played
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:13.760]  that last hour. Then we've got this article on infowars.com by administration, giving
[1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:19.040]  social security numbers to illegal aliens at the US border. Laura Logan learns with the
[1:52:19.040 --> 1:52:24.840]  documents. Absolutely incredible report showing how this all works. It's not about stopping
[1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:29.520]  your legals. It's about controlling you. And then this San Francisco kink and fetish
[1:52:29.520 --> 1:52:35.080]  fest where they urinate and eat poop. Folks, I can't show these clips. We have them and
[1:52:35.080 --> 1:52:39.240]  have sex in the street happens all in a parade children through the streets while they're
[1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:45.360]  having sex with children. This is pedophile extravaganza. San Francisco kink and fetish
[1:52:45.360 --> 1:52:52.600]  festival to press on despite monkeypox emergency declaration. And despite the fact that 99%
[1:52:52.600 --> 1:52:57.240]  of monkeypox cases that finally had one death in Europe, we got a whole new lockdown because
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:03.840]  of it, but they're not going to stop having up to 50 sexual partners a week. I don't care
[1:53:03.840 --> 1:53:09.040]  of your heterosexual or your homosexual leave kids alone. And I don't care of your heterosexual
[1:53:09.040 --> 1:53:17.200]  homosexual. You can't have dozens of partners a week and not have your Johnson fall off.
[1:53:17.200 --> 1:53:24.600]  And so that's what's going on here, folks, is total mental illness, complete out of control
[1:53:24.600 --> 1:53:32.480]  behavior. And these people want your children because nothing else gets them excited anymore.
[1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:38.720]  As monkeypox spreads, health experts urge Texas universities to prepare for outbreaks.
[1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:43.360]  And then even Fox News says, well, don't attack gay people. We're not attacking anybody except
[1:53:43.360 --> 1:53:48.280]  anyone who's having sex with dozens of people a week. And then you want to lock us down.
[1:53:48.280 --> 1:53:53.600]  You don't see them at the pedo parades wearing their fricking mask. They do it as a sign
[1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:58.240]  of their political party at the airport or your school or city council to suppress you.
[1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:06.320]  In fact, we have this clip. This is a clip that's absolutely disgusting. And this deals
[1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:12.040]  with all of this. This is the churches all over the Western world captured by these people.
[1:54:12.040 --> 1:54:19.880]  And this is right here in the USA. Well, this is in New York of a captured church with a
[1:54:19.880 --> 1:54:26.960]  bunch of LGBT supporters wearing mask and rainbow hats, while a giant fat man that looks scarier
[1:54:26.960 --> 1:54:34.680]  than hit the clown or Chucky marching down. So this is blasphemy. This is what the Satanist
[1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:43.320]  always do of going into filing churches. This is 101 that a woman is a 400 pound man that
[1:54:43.320 --> 1:54:48.880]  a woman is a man in a clown outfit with a bunch of children in a church celebrating their
[1:54:48.880 --> 1:55:08.080]  victory over humanity. Here's the report. This is what your churches are now. Imagine
[1:55:08.080 --> 1:55:13.040]  people that built that church hundreds of years ago. Everything they had to build it
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:18.880]  had their names of abuse. And now this is happening. That's another compared to them wanting access
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:42.120]  to our children parking their territory over our children over our lives over who we are
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:50.360]  and trying to take our guns so we can't protect ourselves and make us take experimental injections
[1:55:50.360 --> 1:56:02.240]  into our bodies. Look at this report right here. This meme says it all for radio listeners
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:09.040]  all describe it from Elijah Shafer. Ghost guns dot com. One good guy with a gun is worth
[1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:14.680]  more than 376 cops who did nothing. It's actually over 450 now and you've all day that stood
[1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:19.680]  down while the children were killed. But these two men stopped mass shooters dead in their
[1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:28.960]  tracks before they could kill masses of people. That is the reality. The house is past the
[1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:36.840]  assault weapons man. The move to take our guns is admitted. It's all out of the open
[1:56:36.840 --> 1:56:39.480]  now. All right. Owen Shroyer takes over with this
[1:56:39.480 --> 1:56:46.280]  key report by Neil Oliver at the start of the hour. I hope this goes viral and easy
[1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:49.960]  to go viral. We're going to take this show today that was really I think informative.
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:53.600]  We're going to cut it up to five or six clips. We'll post those at man dot video and that's
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:59.200]  your arsenal of truth to fight the globalist. They wouldn't be censoring if the truth wasn't
[1:56:59.200 --> 1:57:03.480]  hurting him. So please spread the word about the articles videos. Please pray for info

[1:58:55.480 --> 1:59:00.040]  Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year. 30 different tax returns,
[1:59:00.040 --> 1:59:05.200]  30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers and almost all of them
[1:59:05.200 --> 1:59:10.200]  just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part
[1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:14.040]  of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[1:59:14.040 --> 1:59:19.720]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[1:59:19.720 --> 1:59:25.000]  to be able to do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your
