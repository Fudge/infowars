[00:00.000 --> 00:04.480]  Today I want to take just a moment to give you some more in-depth information about these
[00:04.480 --> 00:09.840]  viruses and these vaccines as well as some of the legal proceedings that we are pursuing in
[00:09.840 --> 00:16.080]  the International Criminal Court. You're absolutely right. The legal precedents that exist for vaccine
[00:16.080 --> 00:23.120]  mandates came from an era that was called the eugenics era which is when it's one of the most
[00:23.120 --> 00:29.280]  despised era in the history of the Supreme Court. This was the same Supreme Court that said
[00:29.600 --> 00:35.440]  forced racial segregation was okay. This was the same Supreme Court that said you could force child
[00:35.440 --> 00:41.040]  labor for however many hours you wanted. This was the same Supreme Court that ultimately approved
[00:41.040 --> 00:47.600]  forced sterilizations of poor women. This is the same Supreme Court that their logic, their
[00:47.600 --> 00:54.080]  decisions led to forced detention camps for the Japanese in Korematsu. The vaccine case that was
[00:54.080 --> 00:59.280]  the core of that, I call it the first case of the foundational case of the trilogy of infamy,
[00:59.280 --> 01:03.760]  was the Jacobson decision and nobody should be following it because of where that led.
[01:04.640 --> 01:09.680]  But putting that aside, even the Jacobson case and the subsequent school vaccine cases
[01:10.320 --> 01:17.760]  all involved a very dangerous disease with a very safe and effective proven vaccine over decades,
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.200]  in some cases over a hundred years, and it involved a legislature that passed it
[01:23.840 --> 01:31.200]  and the only limitation was on access to a particular public school ground or a small fine
[01:31.200 --> 01:37.440]  in the case of Jacobson. The Supreme Court has never approved of any vaccine that was mandated
[01:37.440 --> 01:43.120]  by someone other than the legislature. They have never approved a vaccine that is not even
[01:43.120 --> 01:48.560]  biologically licensed. They have never approved a decision of a vaccine that does not have a long
[01:48.560 --> 01:54.160]  history of proven success, and they have never approved a forced vaccine where the disease poses
[01:54.160 --> 02:00.320]  so little risk as this one does to people like children as an example. And so there's a lot of
[02:00.320 --> 02:05.600]  reasons why the Jacobson decision, even if the court wanted to consider it good law, it's not
[02:05.680 --> 02:10.400]  good law, but even if it were, it has no application to this context.
[02:10.400 --> 02:36.960]  Infowars. Tomorrow's news today.
[02:36.960 --> 02:46.480]  Antibody dependent enhancement. It's something that top scientists across the world have been
[02:46.480 --> 02:53.440]  screaming for the last year and a half about these so-called vaccines that create the spike protein
[02:53.440 --> 03:01.440]  in the body and create this violent autoimmune response. We have Dr. Richard M. Fleming in studio
[03:01.440 --> 03:05.360]  coming up in about 45 minutes. He's going to be hosting and doing a detailed
[03:05.360 --> 03:10.240]  PowerPoint. I appreciate him traveling with his crew to Austin, Texas, to bring you this
[03:10.240 --> 03:15.760]  life-saving emergency information. I appreciate our great crew being here on Saturday afternoon
[03:15.760 --> 03:25.040]  and evening as well. It is Saturday, October 2nd, 2021, and our first big story out of all
[03:25.040 --> 03:29.440]  the huge news the last 20 months with this whole global tyranny rollout with COVID
[03:29.440 --> 03:43.200]  has been the fact that this antibody dependent enhancement situation was predicted. And now here
[03:43.200 --> 03:51.760]  we are. And it's happening. It's confirmed by the Pentagon and the Pentagon's main AI project
[03:51.760 --> 03:56.480]  surveilling all the COVID information, public and private, has found in their own report that
[03:56.480 --> 04:03.200]  the majority of people dying supposedly from COVID are vaccinated. And the majority of people
[04:03.200 --> 04:07.840]  in hospitals are vaccinated just as we see in Israel and Australia and around the world.
[04:07.840 --> 04:11.920]  This is just so incredible. And Mike Adams has written about it. Others have written about it
[04:11.920 --> 04:22.080]  different angles from the Pentagon report. But Mike Adams hits the area that AI-powered DOD
[04:22.080 --> 04:29.440]  data analysis program shatters official vaccine narrative shows ADE accelerating and fully
[04:29.440 --> 04:34.960]  vaccinated each week. And that's an important angle. But when you read the conclusion in the
[04:34.960 --> 04:40.560]  report that's getting almost no coverage in the mainstream media, they say that we're seeing
[04:41.280 --> 04:49.520]  antibody problems and the antibody dependency enhancement, which was predicted showing that
[04:49.520 --> 04:55.440]  people's own bodies in a cytokine storm are starting to kill them, as was predicted.
[04:55.440 --> 04:59.680]  So the globalists knew this was going to happen. And now here we are eight, nine months of people
[04:59.680 --> 05:04.560]  having the shots. And every time they now come in contact with a cold virus or something,
[05:04.560 --> 05:08.880]  the body attacks itself. So this is what killed 50 million people during the Spanish flu. It's
[05:08.880 --> 05:13.840]  happening now. And it was predicted. We told you. And now it's here. So we're going to cover that
[05:13.840 --> 05:17.600]  first here in a moment. And then Dr. Fleming, you can be guaranteed, is going to be talking
[05:17.600 --> 05:21.920]  about it as well. But this is the biggest news you get in all of this. We've got a lot of news
[05:21.920 --> 05:27.440]  on that front. We'll also break down, but let's talk about our abilities to speak. Let's talk
[05:27.440 --> 05:35.040]  about our abilities to have our basic rights that made America America and why so many people
[05:36.960 --> 05:42.640]  wanted to be able to come to this country, because not just the first amendment is being overturned
[05:43.440 --> 05:48.880]  and attacked, but also the sixth and the seventh is being completely abolished
[05:48.880 --> 05:54.560]  across the United States by activist judges, authoritarian judges that have been installed
[05:54.560 --> 05:57.440]  by the Democratic Party and George Soros. I'm going to show you all the proof of that,
[05:58.160 --> 06:07.600]  including a Texas judge here in Austin, Texas, that took over a case against us who violated the
[06:07.680 --> 06:14.320]  Seventh Amendment completely and said, I don't have a right to a jury trial, that I am guilty,
[06:14.320 --> 06:20.640]  not even guilty until proven innocent, that I am guilty and that now she will select a jury
[06:20.640 --> 06:24.640]  that will say how much money I pay. That's not in the Constitution. It's not the Bill of Rights.
[06:24.640 --> 06:29.440]  It's so dangerous. Let me just show you this information. So when you see mainstream news
[06:29.440 --> 06:33.040]  headlines, you understand what's really behind it, because the attack I'm under is the attack
[06:33.040 --> 06:37.920]  everybody's under and I'll elaborate on that in a moment, but they're desperate to get us off the
[06:37.920 --> 06:44.000]  air. Here's CNN, Texas judge temporarily blocks anti-abortion group from suing Planned Parenthood
[06:44.000 --> 06:48.720]  abortion providers under new law. And she says, you're not allowed to sue people and harass them
[06:48.720 --> 06:53.280]  to take their rights. Really, that's what she's going along with. And so she's the one blocking
[06:53.280 --> 06:58.560]  that, making sure that Medicare, Medicaid gets paid for abortions as well. And there's Reuters
[06:58.560 --> 07:03.920]  on the same judge. And so out of the whole country, they've got this lady doing it all,
[07:03.920 --> 07:08.640]  Judge Maya Guerrero Gamble, who just got into office a year ago. So she's elected,
[07:08.640 --> 07:13.440]  she's a political person and she's being political here. So you've got that little
[07:13.440 --> 07:16.080]  tidbit about her. Now let's look at what she's done to me.
[07:17.760 --> 07:21.680]  Under the Texas law, because of all these frivolous lawsuits, there's an anti-SLAPP law
[07:22.400 --> 07:27.360]  saying if you're in media and you get sued, you were able to take it all the way to the Supreme
[07:27.360 --> 07:32.720]  Court on the merits of it to even see if they can sue you. Well, in the process of that,
[07:32.720 --> 07:36.880]  we turned over 80,000 pages of documents to them, everything they asked for. They kept saying,
[07:36.880 --> 07:42.080]  we know you've got more. We know you've got more. That judge retired. And so this new political
[07:42.080 --> 07:45.840]  judge was given the case for the Democrats in Travis County and all the judges she was selected.
[07:46.800 --> 07:53.600]  And she just said it at the second hearing, I know you've got stuff. I know you're holding it back.
[07:53.600 --> 07:59.680]  You are defaulted. And now we're going to have a jury trial because you're guilty. Now you get
[07:59.680 --> 08:05.280]  a jury trial to decide if you're guilty, not, oh, you're guilty. And now a jury trial will decide
[08:05.280 --> 08:11.840]  how much you pay. And even the other side's law firm says, well, this is really a myth.
[08:11.840 --> 08:16.720]  The death penalty sanctions never really done unless somebody sued and then runs away and never
[08:16.720 --> 08:21.840]  even comes to trial. I mean, the judge could say this person showed no evidence. This person gave
[08:21.840 --> 08:27.760]  no information over and then show the evidence and sanction you, which they did to us with no
[08:27.760 --> 08:33.040]  evidence, by the way, already $100,000. But they didn't do that. She says, no, a jury
[08:35.280 --> 08:40.080]  isn't going to decide whether you're guilty. You're guilty. And now I'm going to have a jury
[08:40.080 --> 08:44.080]  decide what you pay to people for your free speech with a bunch of misrepresented stuff
[08:44.080 --> 08:47.440]  they've put in my mouth that I didn't even say on top of it. Oh, and it gets worse.
[08:47.680 --> 08:53.680]  Under Texas law, someone can't sue you in defamation if you haven't said their name.
[08:54.480 --> 08:57.840]  We brought that to the Supreme Court and they said, sorry, a couple of the justices said,
[08:57.840 --> 09:01.520]  yeah, we should throw this out. But the other justice said, let it go ahead and go to trial
[09:01.520 --> 09:05.600]  and then we'll override it if we think so. So they said, we don't care if the Texas law says
[09:06.400 --> 09:12.960]  you must say somebody's name to be able to sue them. That went forward. And a bunch of other
[09:12.960 --> 09:16.880]  stuff that we haven't even raised or pointed out yet that we are. So, so this is, this is
[09:17.600 --> 09:20.480]  a deliberate trampling and it's happening all over the country now, not just to me.
[09:21.120 --> 09:25.200]  And the so-called media is going along with this thinking it'll be selectively enforced on us.
[09:25.200 --> 09:29.840]  Now it's going to be used to destroy the press, make it more of a lapdog in this nation.
[09:31.200 --> 09:38.880]  So let's read the public and post report that broke this. Alex Jones just lost two
[09:38.880 --> 09:45.120]  Sandy Hook cases. Really? A judge issued default judgments, a rarity in the legal world against
[09:45.120 --> 09:48.640]  Jones and info wars after the conspiracy theorists failed to produce discovery.
[09:49.920 --> 09:55.040]  That's like saying, if you aren't a witch, you will sink and drown. And we know you're innocent.
[09:55.040 --> 09:57.520]  If you are a witch, you will float and we will burn you to death.
[09:59.680 --> 10:04.800]  It's medieval justice, which is no justice at all. So again, we gave over 80,000 pages,
[10:04.800 --> 10:08.400]  all that everything they asked for. They said, give us your Sandy Hook marketing material.
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.520]  We don't have that. It's like, give us a copy of the t-shirt that says, I love Elmer Fudd.
[10:14.240 --> 10:18.880]  We never made a t-shirt saying, I love Elmer Fudd. You, we've got the t-shirt saying Elmer Fudd.
[10:19.680 --> 10:26.400]  No, we don't. So it's just completely tyrannical, but that's how they play these games.
[10:27.040 --> 10:30.000]  And it just goes on to even have their law firm right here say
[10:32.800 --> 10:39.200]  Bill Ogden, who's deposed before with far and ball told Huffington Post that gamble's default
[10:39.200 --> 10:44.080]  judgment ruling is a bit of a myth in the legal world. We learn about death penalty sanctions in
[10:44.080 --> 10:50.240]  law school as more of a theory. And it's almost unheard of to have them hand down this in a case
[10:50.240 --> 10:54.400]  like this Ogden said, but he goes on to say, but Jones is a special case. He wouldn't give
[10:54.400 --> 11:01.520]  anything over really. That's why I set a sat for two depositions with him and the other lawyer
[11:01.520 --> 11:05.440]  for like six, eight hours a piece. Oh, and we gave him 81,000 documents.
[11:05.440 --> 11:09.920]  They would say, give us anything that says info wars, anything that says sale,
[11:09.920 --> 11:14.240]  anyone that says product marketing and 80 plus thousand documents. And they're like,
[11:14.240 --> 11:20.720]  we were given nothing. We were stonewalled. The one time we go, oh, we did find a video.
[11:20.720 --> 11:24.880]  We couldn't find before online of the helicopter in the woods at Sandy Hook with the man in
[11:24.880 --> 11:31.120]  camouflage and them saying that he was a shooter. And they went, oh my God, you lied and hit that
[11:31.120 --> 11:35.200]  from us. We're like, no, no, it's exculpatory. Meaning it helps us. We just found it online.
[11:35.200 --> 11:40.560]  Now we didn't have it in our archives. And the last judge Jenkins goes, that's a hundred
[11:40.560 --> 11:46.400]  thousand dollar fine. I mean, and in law, if you find something new, you're not hiding it,
[11:46.400 --> 11:53.040]  you bring it forward. So just insane folks, but this judge is even more out of control. I mean,
[11:53.040 --> 12:00.080]  at least in old kangaroo courts, in, in places famously out there like Australia,
[12:00.080 --> 12:03.920]  they call it a kangaroo court because you have a right to a jury, even under English common law
[12:03.920 --> 12:07.840]  and under the crown, but they would have kangaroos. They would joke as the jury. And the
[12:07.840 --> 12:13.440]  judge was really there as the person doing it. This is a court without even the kangaroos.
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.120]  I mean, she came and say like, she's the queen of the kangaroos. She's more just a Democrat
[12:19.120 --> 12:25.520]  headhunter weaponizing the judiciary and thinking things are so corrupt that appeals courts and
[12:25.520 --> 12:29.680]  Supreme court of Texas will certify all this. I mean, people ask, how are you handling this?
[12:30.320 --> 12:33.840]  When they took me off the internet four years ago, I said, they're coming for you next. I'm
[12:33.840 --> 12:38.640]  sad for everybody. And then this happens. I'm like, what do you expect? The Marine
[12:38.640 --> 12:43.520]  Corps, Lieutenant Colonel is in jail without charges for saying the Afghanistan thing
[12:43.520 --> 12:48.880]  was a total disaster. There's preachers all over the country still in jail for opening their
[12:48.880 --> 12:53.440]  churches. They still arrest you in Baton Rouge. If you open your church, but the topless bars in
[12:53.440 --> 13:01.280]  Walmart are open. So this is an attack on, I mean, thousands of children in Texas are taken
[13:01.280 --> 13:06.240]  at age seven and sterilized because one parent wants to do it. And the fathers and mothers are
[13:06.240 --> 13:13.120]  overridden by these judges. Children are taken and sterilized. Am I surprised? No, we have a case of
[13:13.120 --> 13:16.960]  serious tyranny in the Democratic party and the Republican party is doing nothing to stop it.
[13:16.960 --> 13:23.200]  So that's one article. Alex Jones just lost two Sandy Hook cases. A judge issued default
[13:23.200 --> 13:28.400]  judgments. Now you go through the media, they're saying, oh no, Jones lost to a jury. It's all
[13:28.400 --> 13:33.120]  official because they even know the public would wake up if they saw that it was a judge. So I'll
[13:33.120 --> 13:37.360]  show you articles where they're lying and saying the opposite. This is total information warfare.
[13:37.360 --> 13:41.440]  Here's the first amendment. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment religion for
[13:41.440 --> 13:45.200]  having the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the right of the press
[13:45.200 --> 13:49.120]  or the right of the people peaceably to assemble petition the government for redress of grievances.
[13:49.120 --> 13:54.400]  But they don't care. They just sue you in a Democrat area and then take your free speech
[13:54.400 --> 14:00.160]  by misrepresenting even what you said. Now let's show you that this Maya Gamble's wrong and no,
[14:00.160 --> 14:06.640]  she's wrong. Seventh amendment. The seventh amendment in suits at common law where the value
[14:07.680 --> 14:13.680]  in controversy shall exceed $20. The right of trial by jury shall be preserved and no
[14:13.680 --> 14:18.400]  fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the United States
[14:18.400 --> 14:24.480]  than according to the rules of common law. Pretty simple for this judge, but no, she doesn't care.
[14:26.480 --> 14:33.760]  Right to trial by jury clause. Sixth amendment. Same thing. And it goes back to the Magna Carta
[14:33.760 --> 14:38.640]  1215. It's all explained. You can go look at them for yourself. So these are facts I'm showing.
[14:39.840 --> 14:43.360]  Here's the Daily Beast trying to spin it. Alex Jones info wars will be forced to pay
[14:43.360 --> 14:48.160]  whatever damages an upcoming jury determines his claims that the mass shooting was a false flag.
[14:49.120 --> 14:54.000]  So I'm guilty. If it's more than $20, a jury is supposed to say, if I'm guilty,
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.160]  then damages are decided. But they just skip all that and try to act like, oh, it still doesn't
[14:58.160 --> 15:02.400]  violate the seventh amendment because the jury will decide, well, he's guilty, but now we decide
[15:02.400 --> 15:07.680]  the punishment. This is just making new law. This is a revolution of tyranny. Here's another one.
[15:07.680 --> 15:12.080]  This guy got 20 something thousand retweets. Alex Jones is going to be paying the San Diego
[15:12.080 --> 15:18.080]  family's a lot of money after the jury found him liable today showing that a good civil suit can
[15:18.800 --> 15:23.840]  do to get accountability for treacherous misinformation. More of this, please, says
[15:23.840 --> 15:29.680]  Tristan Snell. Read that again. Alex Jones is going to be paying the San Diego family's a lot
[15:29.680 --> 15:36.800]  of money after the jury found him liable today. The jury, the jury found me liable. Let's look
[15:36.800 --> 15:42.720]  at that. 20 something thousand retweets and nobody that I saw in the comments was even
[15:42.720 --> 15:48.000]  understanding that was a lie. The CMD platform, so I can't even go challenge that. See how much
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.920]  fun it is. What did Frank Herbert, a great thinker, have to say a real liberal, not a fascist say
[15:52.560 --> 15:58.960]  when I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles. But
[15:58.960 --> 16:03.520]  I am stronger than you. I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles. And
[16:03.520 --> 16:12.960]  that's Judge Maya Campbell. So how am I doing? Well, I mean, I understand where we are as a
[16:12.960 --> 16:18.800]  nation, where we are as a country, and they have all these delusions about how much money I've got.
[16:18.800 --> 16:24.080]  Well, you can't squeeze blood out of a turnip, but they don't care about that. They want the precedent
[16:25.440 --> 16:30.800]  to shut down anybody they want and terrorize them. They've already passed laws like this in Canada,
[16:30.800 --> 16:35.840]  the UK and Australia. This is a reign of terror and it's only going to get worse.
[16:37.280 --> 16:41.360]  And the judge ruled that she was taking my right of jury away, that she has no right to do under
[16:41.440 --> 16:45.840]  the Seventh Amendment and common sense and common law and everything else back to Magna Carta,
[16:45.840 --> 16:51.040]  which I do not relinquish my right to jury. It says you can relinquish it. I do not relinquish
[16:51.040 --> 16:59.760]  it to Lord Gamble, to Queen Empress Gamble. But she thinks I'll just sit here and let her do that.
[17:01.040 --> 17:07.360]  It's not a real judge, not a real court. It's a tyrannous or a tyrant, a tyrannosaurus rex,
[17:07.360 --> 17:13.280]  a terrible lizard. But I know this is part of the Glaudezer attack. We had this gentleman on
[17:13.280 --> 17:17.600]  the show. It went viral and banned out video because YouTube banned him. FBI arrest retired
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.160]  Green Beret officer Jeremy Brown for attending January 6th protest and standing outside the
[17:22.160 --> 17:28.880]  Capitol after he refused to be an informant. We have all the video in the detailed report.
[17:31.280 --> 17:34.560]  And they came and said, we want you to go set people up on January 6th. He said no.
[17:35.200 --> 17:39.280]  And so he was peacefully there on January 6 outside the Capitol. And they have arrested
[17:39.280 --> 17:43.680]  him for trespassing on the grounds, which is totally legal to be on the Capitol grounds.
[17:44.240 --> 17:48.480]  And they're not letting him out of jail on a misdemeanor because he would not do what they
[17:48.480 --> 17:54.400]  wanted. Just like what happened at Ruby Ridge when the Green Beret there wouldn't be an FBI informant.
[17:55.680 --> 18:00.480]  They came to his house and shot his son and wife in the back, shot her while she was holding the
[18:00.480 --> 18:05.120]  baby in the head. That's what happened to Randy Weaver. So they want you when they come and tell
[18:05.120 --> 18:11.040]  you to work for them as a slave and you don't do it. Well, he's in jail for a misdemeanor.
[18:12.080 --> 18:15.360]  And they said they might just keep him a while, might put him in solitary confinement.
[18:15.360 --> 18:24.320]  That'll teach him. So it's the Judge Maya Gamble school of law all over the country. Meanwhile,
[18:24.320 --> 18:28.800]  Millie, they say, should be arrested for leaking to Woodward and the Chinese generals. But he says
[18:28.800 --> 18:32.720]  it's quite normal. The Democrats all defended because they're involved in a revolution against
[18:32.720 --> 18:36.480]  the country and engage in treason openly. Well, they teach critical race theory that
[18:36.480 --> 18:42.240]  white people are inherently bad. It's just total absolute takeover of our Republican.
[18:42.240 --> 18:47.040]  What are other Texas judges doing? Judge places boy in custody of mother who supports
[18:47.680 --> 18:51.920]  his alleged desire to live as a girl. You've had the father on. We played clips of the son saying,
[18:51.920 --> 18:56.240]  I don't want to be a girl. But when mom's with him, she says he says it. And even the boy told
[18:56.240 --> 19:00.480]  the judge, I don't want to take hormone blockers that stopped my growth and hurt me. The judge
[19:00.480 --> 19:04.880]  said, you will do it until the public stood up and fought back and the governor fought back.
[19:04.880 --> 19:10.640]  That's why we've got to say no to these elected judges who are dishonorable and our Democrat party
[19:10.640 --> 19:17.040]  cult leaders, very dangerous to have judges elected like this because they, they, they work
[19:17.040 --> 19:24.960]  for their party. Here it is. Here's him with a son, 87th legislature, civil society, judicial
[19:24.960 --> 19:30.560]  court strips, James younger, his father of custody, but says permission needed for puberty
[19:30.560 --> 19:36.400]  blockers, gender surgeries. The judge can take the boy away, but they blocked that. So
[19:37.120 --> 19:41.840]  we've got to stand up against this. We've got to say no. We've got to realize what's happening
[19:41.840 --> 19:47.520]  and unfolding. Now we're going to go to constitutional lawyer, Robert Barnes here
[19:47.520 --> 19:53.360]  to talk about the incredible assault on liberties and the latest COVID news and information like
[19:53.360 --> 19:57.920]  legislation introduced by Diane Feinstein to make you take an injection to fly on a plane.
[19:57.920 --> 20:01.760]  But she herself is exempt from all that along with Congress. And then we're going to come back
[20:01.760 --> 20:08.400]  with our top story out of that Pentagon AI finds that Fauci's lying. That's why it never gives any
[20:08.400 --> 20:12.480]  evidence. You're way more likely to die of COVID. If you've had the inoculation, you're way more
[20:12.480 --> 20:17.280]  likely to be in the hospital, which we predicted. And it's in the Pentagon's own AI report that's
[20:17.280 --> 20:22.960]  coming up. We'll be right back in a moment with Robert Barnes. So first of all, I can
[20:22.960 --> 20:30.080]  announce that by Friday, the 15th of October, every single authorized worker that is on that
[20:30.080 --> 20:35.840]  authorized worker list, whether they be in Melbourne or in regional Victoria will need
[20:35.840 --> 20:43.440]  to have had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. That is if they want to continue working.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.640]  How are you going to manage any pushback for those that?
[20:46.640 --> 20:51.840]  Well, Victoria police will take whatever steps they need to take. Protests don't work,
[20:51.840 --> 20:56.400]  protests are not smart. They're not lawful. This is a decision that's been made. It's
[20:56.400 --> 20:59.360]  about getting us open. It's not about the processing, it's the messaging.
[21:00.080 --> 21:03.840]  If there's people that don't want this mandatory vaccine, how do we manage it?
[21:03.840 --> 21:05.120]  Well, then they won't be going to work.
[21:08.080 --> 21:14.080]  It's very, very simple. It's very simple. We want to open the place up. I'm not taking lectures on
[21:14.080 --> 21:20.000]  freedom from people who will hold all of us back. Right? We want to be free. We're going to be free.
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.400]  We're going to be open. And the key to that is getting these vaccination numbers up and up and
[21:24.400 --> 21:28.640]  up. But we've got to make some difficult decisions along the way. And that's why this decision,
[21:28.640 --> 21:35.360]  not made lightly, is critically important. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice
[21:36.160 --> 21:41.760]  I am willing to make. Does that mean you don't have confidence in that 80% number anymore?
[21:41.760 --> 21:46.000]  No, no, not at all. We've just got to get as many people vaccinated as possible. And it's not about
[21:46.960 --> 21:53.280]  the ultimate number in a month's time or so. You will need to be double-vaxxed as an authorised
[21:53.280 --> 22:00.320]  worker. Even when after we get to 80% and the authorisations are no longer there, the mandate,
[22:00.320 --> 22:04.720]  the rule, the Chief Health Officer direction will stay in place because cases will still be
[22:04.720 --> 22:09.520]  an issue then. And I wouldn't want to say to anybody out there, look, you know, just hold out
[22:09.520 --> 22:15.600]  for a few weeks and you'll be able to go about the pub and go to the G and do everything as if
[22:15.760 --> 22:20.880]  you were vaccinated. No, that's not, that's not the case. We're going to have a vaccinated economy
[22:21.840 --> 22:26.720]  and we're going to lock some people out because that is far better than locking everybody down.
[22:27.520 --> 22:34.560]  Well, Victoria Police will take whatever steps they need to take. Protests don't work. Protests
[22:34.560 --> 22:42.720]  are not smart. They're not lawful. We are about to enter a period of history without precedent.
[22:42.960 --> 22:50.640]  A war for the world. And we, you and I, are on the front line.
[22:58.880 --> 23:04.800]  Be calm. Be united. Be brave. And be good.
[23:12.720 --> 23:20.320]  Remember their names and who they are.
[23:24.240 --> 23:34.800]  Remember what they did and what they did not do.
[23:42.720 --> 23:44.800]  We have been deceived by those who we trust.
[23:53.840 --> 23:57.520]  Slowly, the truth has been revealed by the tireless efforts of a few.
[23:58.320 --> 24:03.440]  And this has been the most difficult task. No matter how many they send against us,
[24:03.440 --> 24:07.520]  they cannot defeat 25 million Australians who stand together as one.
[24:07.600 --> 24:17.520]  Be brave. Some of us might be hurt and some of us might die. We must win this war with
[24:17.520 --> 24:25.440]  such moral authority that we are able to win the peace that follows. The guilty will be punished.
[24:25.520 --> 24:42.560]  We, the common people of Australia, are and have always been so much more than the elites. We are
[24:42.560 --> 24:51.120]  better than they are. We fight not because we hate what is in front of us, but because we love what
[24:51.120 --> 25:06.560]  is behind us. It's October 1, 2021, and I've got good news for you. I've got good news for me.
[25:06.560 --> 25:13.280]  I've got good news for everybody alive in America and on this planet today. Now, we spent years
[25:13.280 --> 25:18.560]  developing this, and it's probably one of the strongest, cleanest formulas in the world. There
[25:18.560 --> 25:23.280]  may be something better. We don't know about it. It's made by one of the top labs in the United
[25:23.280 --> 25:27.040]  States that we probably label it from because, again, if we said their name, they'd get attacked
[25:27.040 --> 25:36.800]  by the left. This stuff is incredible. It is Brain Force Ultra, exclusively available at
[25:36.800 --> 25:43.760]  M4WStore.com. We got a limited run of this in a month ago, and it sold out in three days.
[25:44.480 --> 25:50.320]  And we already had a larger batch getting developed. The ingredients came in, and the
[25:50.320 --> 25:55.040]  new batch is here, and I just took some today. And I think it's even stronger than the last batch
[25:55.040 --> 26:00.560]  because this stuff, again, is done in a lab, but it's done organically. So each batch varies a
[26:00.560 --> 26:04.720]  little bit, but it does get all the testing done to show that it's at least up to a basic strength,
[26:04.720 --> 26:10.720]  and this is actually above that. So we got Brain Force Ultra back in stock. We got a big shipment
[26:10.720 --> 26:15.360]  in, but it's so popular, I think it's going to sell out in probably a week. Despite that,
[26:15.360 --> 26:21.840]  we're going to offer it at 50% off the introductory rate for at least four or five days. That's why
[26:21.840 --> 26:27.280]  I'm saying it's October 1st. I'm going to run this until October 5th. Hell, it may sell out.
[26:27.280 --> 26:32.160]  And that's good news for Infowars because we desperately need funding in the face of the
[26:32.160 --> 26:37.760]  Democratic Party assault their rig courts, their kangaroo systems, and their attempts to silence
[26:37.760 --> 26:42.320]  us and silence you. Because that's why they're coming after us is to get to you. We are all in
[26:42.320 --> 26:45.920]  this together, as Benjamin Franklin said, and if we don't hang together, we're going to hang
[26:45.920 --> 26:49.920]  separate. You've been hanging with us. You've been keeping us on air. You've been spreading the word,
[26:49.920 --> 26:54.160]  and it's having an incredible effect. In fact, let me spend a minute or so on that before I get
[26:54.160 --> 26:59.760]  back into this. I had a chance to go up to Glenn Beck's The Blaze. I had a chance to hang out with
[26:59.760 --> 27:04.800]  Steven Crowder at his offices outside The Blaze, and I had a chance to meet with a lot of other
[27:04.800 --> 27:09.680]  big reporters and other pundits, and a lot of them thought I was full of it 10 years ago,
[27:09.680 --> 27:13.520]  even five years ago. They now see everything I predicted come true, and we had a heroes welcome
[27:13.520 --> 27:18.880]  there, and it's happening all over the place. But that's because of your support. If you didn't keep
[27:18.880 --> 27:24.000]  us on air, the world wouldn't be waking up. When this tyranny launched its attack, we would be
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.120]  losing. We'd be submitting. But instead, all over the world, from Australia to the United States,
[27:29.120 --> 27:34.160]  people are fighting back and waking up. And Infowars, at least half the time that we talk
[27:34.160 --> 27:38.560]  to people, is the catalyst that woke them up. That means you're the catalyst that woke them up.
[27:38.560 --> 27:43.200]  So again, Brainforce Ultra is back in stock. You've got to go see what is in this. Let me
[27:43.200 --> 27:48.640]  just read you some of the things. Guarana seed, look at what that does. Alpha GPC,
[27:48.640 --> 27:55.840]  whoo! Green coffee bean, Alethra root, yerba mate leaf, green tea leaves, ginkgo leaf,
[27:55.840 --> 28:03.040]  ashwagandha root, and more. And they are strong, organic, cold-pressed. This isn't dry garbage.
[28:03.040 --> 28:08.560]  This isn't old trash. This is new. At one of the best labs, I'm going to say the best because
[28:08.560 --> 28:12.720]  there might be one better, but it's the best we know of. And we are so proud to bring you this.
[28:12.720 --> 28:19.200]  And then it funds again for clean, long, sustained, deep-focused energy where you don't
[28:19.200 --> 28:24.080]  have the crash. If you love turbo force, if you love Brainforce Plus, that are both different
[28:24.080 --> 28:30.960]  formulas that are excellent, you're going to absolutely love Brainforce Ultra. All
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.800]  three are different formulas. All three do different things. But I've got to tell you,
[28:34.800 --> 28:40.560]  of the three, drop for drop, this is the strongest ever. 50% off info war store.com. And while you're
[28:40.560 --> 28:44.880]  there, check out all the other great products like Ultra 12, Wintersite, and so many others.
[28:44.880 --> 28:48.320]  But whatever you do, keep praying for global awakening and keep spreading the word about
[28:48.320 --> 28:55.280]  info wars. Tomorrow's news today. And remember that every person you reach out to now is one
[28:55.280 --> 28:59.840]  step closer to our victory. So thanks for keeping us in the fight. We're never going to back down.
[28:59.840 --> 29:05.760]  God bless and good luck. And we are back with Robert Barnes. Boy, that was a powerful piece
[29:05.760 --> 29:10.160]  of video. It's live at band.video, something that the globalists are trying to shut down right now.
[29:10.160 --> 29:13.920]  Our first amendment, guilty will be punished. Be sure and share that with everybody you know,
[29:13.920 --> 29:18.560]  because you are the power of info wars out there. All right, Robert Barnes joins us and he's done
[29:18.560 --> 29:22.480]  some legal work for us over the years. He's a very popular guest of ours, good friend of mine.
[29:22.480 --> 29:27.840]  And he doesn't really want to get into it and has advised me not to talk about these cases,
[29:27.840 --> 29:31.760]  but you know, when you got an elected judge who's up there making political statements about you
[29:31.760 --> 29:36.800]  and saying you're being punished because you said it's a kangaroo trial, because it is,
[29:36.800 --> 29:41.840]  they keep saying, I'm not giving them all this stuff. I did give them. And so I've been lied
[29:41.840 --> 29:45.520]  about and I'm just not going to roll over to it. But Barnes, I want to get into all the vaccine
[29:45.520 --> 29:48.720]  news and that level of tyranny with you. And that's why you're joining us on this Saturday
[29:48.720 --> 29:53.280]  evening. But you did say you would make a comment about the media and how they're acting like that
[29:53.280 --> 29:57.120]  the merits of the case have been heard on this one. They've not, they've even got headlines that
[29:57.120 --> 30:04.400]  a jury found that I defamed these people. Yeah. I mean, the media lies continue unabated
[30:04.400 --> 30:09.360]  because I mean, what took place was the court issued a default judgment based on issuing a
[30:09.360 --> 30:16.240]  discovery sanction that is in violation of your basic due process rights and your jury trial
[30:16.240 --> 30:22.400]  rights. And it's something that should absolutely be overturned. And I think it reflects a disturbing
[30:22.400 --> 30:27.920]  trend in liberal jurisdictions, which is you have legislators who ignore the limits of the
[30:27.920 --> 30:32.480]  legislature, the executive branch who ignores the limitations of the executive branch when
[30:32.480 --> 30:37.120]  liberals have that power. And now you're seeing liberal judges exercise their political and
[30:37.120 --> 30:42.480]  partisan prejudices rather than enforce and respect the law and the constitutional rights.
[30:42.480 --> 30:48.640]  And I mean, it's kind of odd that the plaintiff's counsel is so eager not to have a trial on the
[30:48.640 --> 30:53.440]  merits. I mean, he claimed to be very confident in this case, but seems to be scared of a jury
[30:53.440 --> 30:58.720]  trial on the merits, even in Austin, Texas, to such a degree that he got a court to issue what I
[30:58.720 --> 31:05.760]  consider a constitutionally outrageous decision, because that's what it is. It's a decision that
[31:05.760 --> 31:10.800]  is without legal merit that violates core constitutional rights. And we can't, we can't
[31:10.800 --> 31:15.200]  be in a place where we have one set of rules for one political party and a different set of rules
[31:15.200 --> 31:20.080]  for others. And what what's happened in these cases, especially if you compare these to, say,
[31:20.080 --> 31:25.520]  the Rachel Maddow case, where she lied about One American News Network, where the courts,
[31:25.520 --> 31:30.960]  you look at Facebook and others, fact checkers in the Candace Owens case, how is it that those
[31:30.960 --> 31:37.360]  defendants never have to produce any discovery, never have to go to trial, never have to face any
[31:37.360 --> 31:43.760]  consequences, whereas there appear to be a separate set of Alex Jones rules that deny basic
[31:43.760 --> 31:49.920]  due process rights, that deny basic jury trial rights. And for people who claim to be confident
[31:49.920 --> 31:56.720]  in the factual accuracy of their claims legally, they sure seem scared of having an actual trial
[31:56.720 --> 32:03.280]  on the merits by a jury. And in particular here, you produced more discovery than any
[32:04.400 --> 32:08.960]  anti-slap defendant in history that I know of in the Connecticut and Texas cases.
[32:09.920 --> 32:17.840]  I know of no case that has affirmed an order like this. Occasionally you get judges who,
[32:17.840 --> 32:24.560]  based on biased judgments, issue unconstitutional orders. In this context, I'm facing it in another
[32:24.560 --> 32:30.320]  case against Don Lemon, where Don Lemon is trying to do the same thing, trying to deny a trial on
[32:30.320 --> 32:36.000]  the merits based on misstatements, in my view, about discovery. Oh wow, you're involved in the
[32:36.000 --> 32:41.280]  Don Lemon case? Yeah, I represent Dustin Heist. I'm suing Don Lemon. You're involved in so much,
[32:41.280 --> 32:44.880]  wow, we should talk about that in a moment. Well, let me raise this one, we'll get into the COVID
[32:44.880 --> 32:51.600]  information. I noticed that Republican judges by and large follow the Constitution Bill of Rights,
[32:51.600 --> 32:57.280]  and when people sue leftists in Republican jurisdictions and try to do the same thing,
[32:57.280 --> 33:02.160]  the judges don't do it. So it's like the Democrats cheat, they throw everything out the window,
[33:02.800 --> 33:07.520]  and then think it's funny and the media supports them, and I'm not saying conservatives should
[33:07.520 --> 33:13.600]  start doing to them what they've done to us, but just at some point this is going to bring
[33:13.600 --> 33:19.360]  the country down. No doubt, because what you have is in liberal jurisdictions, they ignore their
[33:19.360 --> 33:23.280]  limits of the law, and it doesn't matter whether they're in the legislative branch, the executive
[33:23.280 --> 33:28.080]  branch, or the judicial branch. I mean, right now almost everybody knows certain jurisdictions
[33:28.080 --> 33:33.520]  in this country judicially will not give somebody a fair shake just based on their politics,
[33:33.520 --> 33:38.160]  and that's bad, and it's absolutely the case that it's overwhelmingly on the left.
[33:38.160 --> 33:42.320]  There are some right-leaning jurisdictions where you can't get a fair shake if you're a liberal,
[33:42.320 --> 33:46.560]  but very few. There's a lot more liberal jurisdictions. They increasingly believe
[33:46.560 --> 33:52.480]  the ends justify the mean, so they manipulate the rules, they misapply the rules to serve their
[33:52.480 --> 33:57.600]  political partisan objectives. I mean, there's no precedent that someone that's continually produced
[33:57.600 --> 34:03.360]  massive discovery is denied a jury trial right on the merits. I mean, there's no approved case
[34:03.360 --> 34:08.160]  in Texas that has ever allowed that to happen, and yet this court did that. And you just said it.
[34:08.160 --> 34:12.560]  They're trying to create that case, but the Third Circuit, all I mean to understand, this is a
[34:12.560 --> 34:17.600]  layman here, if they erase my rights, they're erasing their own rights, and there's going to
[34:17.600 --> 34:23.120]  be a giant backlash to this. There's got to be some point at which they do not surpass North
[34:23.120 --> 34:31.760]  Korean levels of injustice. Yeah, it's so overt and so obvious that at some point there is going
[34:31.760 --> 34:35.280]  to be political blowback. There already is political blowback. I mean, the Supreme Court
[34:35.280 --> 34:40.000]  itself has the lowest approval rating it's ever had, and it's because of this perception that the
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.120]  courts are political, that there's two tiers of justice, that there's a double set of standards,
[34:45.120 --> 34:49.920]  and this is happening across the board. I mean, yesterday, a federal judge made this exact comment
[34:49.920 --> 34:55.120]  about the U.S. Attorney's Office in the District of Columbia because he rejected their request to
[34:55.120 --> 35:00.240]  imprison one of the January 6th defendants who had pled guilty, said in fact what needs to happen is
[35:00.240 --> 35:06.400]  just to get probation, and he pointed out how could he take the U.S. Attorney's Office seriously
[35:06.400 --> 35:09.680]  when they have one set of standards for people that are on the right and a different set of
[35:09.680 --> 35:14.880]  standards for people on the left, given all the rioters that took place all of D.C. last year,
[35:14.880 --> 35:20.160]  almost none of whom faced any prosecution at all. And so at some point, our executive branch,
[35:20.160 --> 35:26.000]  our legislative branch, and especially our judicial branch, needs to start applying the law
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.640]  impartially without prejudice. And let's expand on that and then move on to the other big subject
[35:30.640 --> 35:37.600]  that's even just as big, if that's possible. This is also huge. If you pull back and look at all
[35:37.680 --> 35:45.040]  these courts, it's the political operatives that in the end are going to get burned when the other
[35:45.040 --> 35:50.160]  party gets back into power. It just makes no sense that you see Kamala Harris when she's a candidate
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.600]  raising millions of dollars and giving thousands of dollars of her money to bail out people that
[35:55.600 --> 36:00.720]  burned down buildings, and you've got Cuomo saying whoever said demonstrations are peaceful,
[36:00.720 --> 36:04.560]  and then they're all for people that were on the Capitol grounds now who were peaceful,
[36:04.560 --> 36:09.920]  like this Green Beret, he's been arrested. Jeremy Brown. I mean, this is getting crazy.
[36:10.800 --> 36:16.160]  Oh, completely. I mean, and it's like they are unaware that the rest of the world sees it for
[36:16.160 --> 36:21.520]  what it is. And I get that, you know, many of them may not care, but this has political consequences.
[36:21.520 --> 36:28.000]  You can't continue to have the confidence in the judiciary in amongst the public is entirely based
[36:28.000 --> 36:35.840]  on the belief that the judiciary is impartial and is not political. That mask has been ripped off
[36:35.840 --> 36:41.440]  over the past several years. And what that will do ultimately is damage the integrity and confidence
[36:41.440 --> 36:46.880]  in the judiciary and the institution itself will fail. I mean, that's already happening to the FBI.
[36:46.880 --> 36:50.800]  That's already happening to the CIA. It's already happening because of what Millie's done to the
[36:50.800 --> 36:55.600]  Pentagon. How many institutions does the left want to destroy credibility? What you're saying
[36:55.600 --> 36:59.280]  is very sophisticated. When you read deeper level, UN and Carnegie and Ford Foundation
[36:59.280 --> 37:03.680]  and Rockefeller documents and class was public statements. The Davos group, they say,
[37:03.680 --> 37:07.120]  we're going to undermine governmental institutions across the world. We're going to fund the
[37:07.120 --> 37:12.240]  governments, control them, order them to do bad things to destroy confidence in the institutions
[37:12.240 --> 37:16.480]  and then overthrow those countries. So they're not just turning us into a third world country
[37:16.480 --> 37:20.560]  by bringing people in and all the rest of it. They are mentally doing that and politically
[37:20.560 --> 37:25.600]  doing it and judicially doing it to kill the country that way. I mean, this is very deliberate.
[37:25.600 --> 37:31.120]  I don't think the useful idiots in the Democratic Party that are doing this understand that they're
[37:31.120 --> 37:36.560]  not doing this for their new dynasty and their thousand year Reich. They're they're doing this
[37:36.560 --> 37:40.000]  to overthrow the country and they themselves are going to be thrown on the wayside.
[37:41.520 --> 37:47.120]  Exactly. I mean, this is an old, old trick, old tactic, old technique to destroy. I mean,
[37:47.120 --> 37:50.960]  look at what they're doing to the police, for example, in Australia, that, you know,
[37:50.960 --> 37:56.000]  police, by going along with it, by going along with crazy restrictions on core constitutional
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.480]  liberties and every cop everywhere only takes an oath to one thing. It's to the constitution of
[38:00.480 --> 38:05.200]  their government, of their country, not to the politicians who happen to run it at any given
[38:05.200 --> 38:10.080]  time. But it's destroying credibility and confidence in the police in places like Australia,
[38:10.080 --> 38:14.640]  because they're behaving as tools of the state rather than upholders of the oath.
[38:15.360 --> 38:20.960]  And I think that so all of this is part of a continuous pattern to reshift power in a great
[38:20.960 --> 38:26.080]  reset to an entirely different agenda. That's very anti. That looks a lot like the Chinese
[38:26.080 --> 38:30.640]  social credit system and does not look like core American constitutional liberties.
[38:31.520 --> 38:36.080]  It's an incredible time to be alive. All right. You are heavily involved in lawsuits around the
[38:36.080 --> 38:43.040]  country. Robert Kennedy Jr., the block, the tyranny. Norm Pattis got a stay in the circuit
[38:43.040 --> 38:49.600]  court, a federal court in New York. And then Sotomayor shot it down last night and said, no,
[38:49.600 --> 38:53.840]  we're going to forcibly inject all the teachers. It doesn't matter what their union wants,
[38:53.840 --> 38:57.760]  and they can be fired if they don't take the experimental shot, which you pointed out
[38:57.760 --> 39:01.680]  was never authorized. That was another hoax. Let me read some of these headlines. We'll get your
[39:01.680 --> 39:07.920]  take on that. Feinstein introduces bill with COVID requirements for domestic flights, but she is
[39:07.920 --> 39:13.760]  exempt from the injections. Hospitals struggle with staff shortages after vaccine passport
[39:13.760 --> 39:19.840]  mandates. Major hospital chains now saying your spouse must be vaccinated or you'll be fined $200
[39:20.480 --> 39:25.040]  per month. So now they're outside even that jurisdiction. How about now your neighbor?
[39:25.040 --> 39:30.960]  This is true authoritarianism. Major British government report and in Scotland, 25% increase
[39:30.960 --> 39:36.480]  of heart attacks from blood clots directly linked to the vaccines. Senior army flight surgeon pilots
[39:36.480 --> 39:45.760]  may die in mid-flight from COVID vaccines. DOD abandons MRI scan protocol. Fully vaccinated former
[39:45.760 --> 39:50.240]  senior contributor, Mark Lamont. He'll suffer his heart attack and his hospitalized blood clots
[39:50.240 --> 39:56.240]  blast NBA players for not taking the shots. So that Australian guy, a member of the media had
[39:56.240 --> 40:00.320]  a heart attack and said he'd still do it again. Pfizer launches final study of COVID drug that's
[40:00.320 --> 40:06.240]  suspiciously similar to horse pace, uses the same molecules. Breakthrough cases surge,
[40:06.240 --> 40:11.520]  vaccine individuals account for 87% of COVID hospitalizations and that's numbers all over
[40:11.520 --> 40:18.480]  the world show similar things. And it goes on and on. Good news, tyrannical New South Wales premiere
[40:19.280 --> 40:22.240]  that was pushing the worst tyranny resigns from corruption probe.
[40:23.360 --> 40:28.880]  That's just some of what we've got. We also have lies on national TV with the different
[40:28.880 --> 40:32.640]  bureaucrats saying that basically learned immunity, natural immunity doesn't exist.
[40:33.520 --> 40:38.000]  Medical freedom doctor Mercola responds to YouTube man. The world is rising up against
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.680]  tyranny. That's what I see happening as well. CDC is building a gun injury surveillance program
[40:43.680 --> 40:48.400]  at hospital emergency rooms. So that's how they're getting around. Everything is creating
[40:48.400 --> 40:54.240]  a database of gun owners. CDC targets rural youth and four H kids with creepy data project
[40:54.240 --> 40:59.200]  on gun culture. They're creating a database of gun owners and people through the CDC that also
[40:59.280 --> 41:05.760]  said it now that once controls all rents and it goes on and on and on from there.
[41:05.760 --> 41:09.280]  But the big news I'm going to cover after you leave, but I'm going to mention it for you
[41:09.920 --> 41:16.720]  is this new big data dump by the Pentagon and their AI project. They've launched when COVID
[41:16.720 --> 41:20.320]  came out in April of last year. And I want to show folks what ever headshot please.
[41:20.960 --> 41:27.120]  And you can see right here, the Pentagon will use AI to predict panic buying COVID-19 hotspots.
[41:27.120 --> 41:34.800]  Well, they've now found that antibody crises that has been predicted is exploding and that
[41:34.800 --> 41:40.720]  people are way more likely to die. We've had the shots, the injections, and the conclusion is
[41:41.360 --> 41:48.400]  that they are seeing exactly what was predicted. The antibody dependent enhancement taking place.
[41:48.960 --> 41:55.440]  So this is just simply incredible. It is a nightmare scenario. This isn't predictions
[41:55.440 --> 42:01.280]  now by top scientists. It's happening. Robert Barnes, I'm going to give you the floor here
[42:01.280 --> 42:06.240]  to give us an analysis of all of this and where you see this going and what legal remedies we
[42:06.240 --> 42:12.400]  have against this power grab. Well, the vaccine mandate lawsuits continue. New suits filed today
[42:12.400 --> 42:18.720]  in Denver, San Francisco and New York, other places throughout the country. So those cases
[42:18.720 --> 42:25.200]  continue and there'll be more challenges to this. And so far, the courts have consistently ruled
[42:25.200 --> 42:31.360]  against vaccine mandates in the context of religious objections. They've ruled in favor
[42:31.360 --> 42:38.080]  of vaccine mandates in other contexts, but they have not ruled in favor of vaccine mandates as
[42:38.080 --> 42:44.800]  opposed to religious objections. So far, religious objectors have won either a direct outright court
[42:44.800 --> 42:50.960]  victory or a settlement or concession from whom they are suing in a half dozen cases in just the
[42:51.040 --> 42:58.400]  last six months. And it's useful to remember even the Obama administration's EEOC recognized a right
[42:58.400 --> 43:03.920]  to religious objections against vaccine mandates because the EEOC brought multiple cases under
[43:03.920 --> 43:10.080]  Obama, even challenging hospitals, imposing vaccine, flu vaccine mandates on nurses
[43:10.880 --> 43:15.040]  on grounds that it violated their religious rights. And they won every single one of those
[43:15.040 --> 43:20.320]  suits. So where there's going to be robust protection and that everybody should be familiar
[43:20.320 --> 43:25.680]  with is in the religious rights context. And it's important to note, as there's language like this
[43:25.680 --> 43:31.280]  on the Tennessee government site, for example, your religious rights do not require a particular
[43:31.280 --> 43:36.000]  organized religion be the source of your objection. It does not require any religious,
[43:36.800 --> 43:42.720]  co religious person agree with you. It does not require any religious leader agree with you.
[43:42.720 --> 43:49.280]  In fact, it just requires a strongly held belief of a moral or spiritual kind that is light
[43:49.280 --> 43:56.000]  or equal to a organized religious belief. And so it's important, like even in the Second Circuit,
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.960]  which did not interfere with the people who did not assert a religious objections,
[44:00.960 --> 44:06.240]  it did interfere and stop the vaccine mandate from going forward as to anyone with a religious
[44:06.240 --> 44:13.280]  objection. So that's the fourth case, fourth case to actually have a court ruling in favor of those
[44:13.280 --> 44:17.840]  challenging the mandate, the sixth case overall, because several cases prior to that, the defendants
[44:17.840 --> 44:22.880]  folded and agreed to it. So that's probably where courts are going to go. They're going to allow a
[44:22.880 --> 44:28.560]  robust, strong religious objection and that they're not going to mandate the vaccine or
[44:28.560 --> 44:32.800]  allow discrimination to take place against employees who assert a religious objection
[44:32.800 --> 44:38.080]  to the vaccine. And the I'm going to be fighting all the other issues as well, because I don't
[44:38.080 --> 44:43.920]  think a vaccine mandate should exist, period, particularly under this context. But it's good
[44:43.920 --> 44:49.760]  to at least establish a strong, robust religious objection grounds that people can safely assert
[44:49.760 --> 44:53.680]  to protect their civil rights and civil liberty. I mean, you could say I believe in the body
[44:54.480 --> 44:59.120]  God gave me and my natural immunity and I believe my body is a temple and you're not allowed to put
[44:59.120 --> 45:03.280]  things in it. I mean, that's basically in Leviticus. That's that's that's in the Jewish law.
[45:03.280 --> 45:08.320]  It's common sense. You can say I don't want to eat shellfish. I had an allergic reaction to him
[45:08.320 --> 45:13.200]  once. Now we have to eat shellfish because, you know, they say we have to. And why do you think
[45:13.200 --> 45:18.080]  they're bum rushing Barnes to try to get everybody injected before they know these
[45:18.080 --> 45:22.480]  court cases come out like their lives depend on getting these shots in people, which we now know
[45:22.480 --> 45:27.680]  are killing and causing folks to die, which of all our mainline scientists knew that and warned them.
[45:27.680 --> 45:32.080]  They certainly knew it. What do you think, speculatively, they're doing here? Because if
[45:32.080 --> 45:37.440]  you wanted to be super villains, you do something like this. No doubt, because what's taking place
[45:37.440 --> 45:42.640]  is they're rushing this process because they do not want a meaningful evidentiary assessment of it.
[45:43.200 --> 45:47.680]  Like your case, they don't want a trial on the merits because they know they will lose
[45:47.680 --> 45:52.720]  a trial on the merits. They know a trial on the merits will not cut in their favor. In fact,
[45:52.720 --> 45:58.480]  every time the any lockdown or public health intervention or mask mandate or vaccine mandate
[45:58.480 --> 46:03.280]  has had to face strict scrutiny. That's what's called under the law. It's failed. The government
[46:03.280 --> 46:08.000]  has failed. The employers have failed. No one can pass strict scrutiny. And why is that? Because
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.040]  just take a look at the vaccine mandate context. If you're symptomatic, your employer can just send
[46:13.040 --> 46:18.720]  you home in self-quarantine. So the only thing they're worrying about is asymptomatic spread.
[46:18.720 --> 46:25.280]  Well, a vaccine doesn't prevent that anyway. So an asymptomatic spread is remote and almost
[46:25.280 --> 46:30.720]  it's the worst is one in a million. So for a one in a million risk of lethal COVID spread from
[46:30.720 --> 46:36.400]  asymptomatic spread, they're requiring you to take a vaccine that doesn't stop asymptomatic spread.
[46:36.400 --> 46:42.720]  So it's completely something that cannot meet any evidentiary test. And so the goal of this whole
[46:42.720 --> 46:47.760]  process has been to speed rush it so that the evidence can never be assessed and never be
[46:47.760 --> 46:54.560]  evaluated because they know they will lose if it is. But knowing it's going to cause all sorts of
[46:54.560 --> 46:59.600]  illnesses, which it already is in death, how do they intend to cover that up? And when we predicted
[46:59.600 --> 47:03.840]  it over a year ago, they're going to claim unvaccinated are making people sick, which is now
[47:03.840 --> 47:08.160]  their rallying cry. But this new AI report from the defense department that looked at all these
[47:08.160 --> 47:13.200]  Medicare, Medicaid patients, almost 6 million of them finds massive increases in death and
[47:13.200 --> 47:17.680]  illness, basically double the number of unvaccinated. This is incredible bombshell
[47:17.680 --> 47:23.120]  proof. I mean, it almost makes me speechless Barnes. Well, I mean, that's why they've created
[47:23.120 --> 47:27.680]  such expansive immunity. And that's what Newsom's announcement was all about yesterday. Right now,
[47:27.680 --> 47:32.160]  they have complete immunity because everything being put out is only under the emergency use
[47:32.160 --> 47:39.040]  authorization. The biologic licensed FDA approved vaccine is not available. So that's not what's
[47:39.040 --> 47:42.720]  being distributed. The only thing that's being distributed is the one that's under the EUA.
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.840]  And the EUA is everybody's completely immune from suit. Nobody can be sued, period. Now,
[47:47.840 --> 47:53.600]  once they get it on the kids list for the child immunization list, then they also are completely
[47:53.600 --> 47:58.960]  immune. And so that's why their goal has been first they wanted to trick everybody. Our lawsuit
[47:58.960 --> 48:04.000]  exposed that. So they're accelerating the timetable to get it on the kids list. And
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.240]  that's why they forced Newsom to go out there and say he's going to force it on the kids list
[48:08.240 --> 48:13.680]  for California school children because they need it on that list to stay immune. And why is that?
[48:13.680 --> 48:19.680]  Because they know the same thing you're talking about. There's a mounting evidence that this
[48:19.680 --> 48:25.920]  vaccine causes serious and severe injury at a much higher rate than any vaccine in history.
[48:25.920 --> 48:30.400]  And that doesn't even deal with the long term risk, which nobody knows what the scope is
[48:30.400 --> 48:35.440]  because of this very uniquely designed vaccine. So what is the all the drug companies, all the
[48:35.440 --> 48:40.000]  government people, all the medical professionals, they don't want any risk from suit. So they want
[48:40.000 --> 48:45.200]  to make sure this stays completely immune. And the only reason to demand immunity. I was representing
[48:45.200 --> 48:50.000]  a client who said he would only talk if he got complete immunity. That tells me that there's
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.120]  something there that the client needs immunity for. And here what you have is big pharma. The
[48:55.120 --> 49:00.880]  only immunity it actually delivers is legal immunity to itself, not immunity to the populace.
[49:00.880 --> 49:06.080]  And once these consequences start getting detailed, they want this to be hushed up because
[49:06.080 --> 49:12.480]  nobody can sue. Nobody can take any legal remedy. It'll just be somebody's sad story. It'll be
[49:12.480 --> 49:16.320]  something that will never see the public light of day in a courtroom because nobody's allowed
[49:16.320 --> 49:21.600]  to sue in the first place. And again, all of this, the attack on the Seventh Amendment,
[49:21.600 --> 49:24.960]  the attack on the Sixth, the attack on the First, the Second, the Tenth, the Ninth,
[49:25.520 --> 49:28.480]  they are just dismantling everything right now, Robert. And
[49:32.400 --> 49:36.240]  I know this is going to fail because this is a response to Brexit. It was a response to Trump.
[49:36.240 --> 49:40.800]  It was a response to Bolsonaro. And a lot of people are going to get hurt in the process.
[49:40.800 --> 49:45.680]  But this attempt for global government, global corporate governance to create a world ID,
[49:45.680 --> 49:50.880]  a world medical ID in their own words for the great reset, as the public begins to awaken to
[49:50.880 --> 49:56.720]  this and the fact that this is a multinational form of corporate takeover, I believe that
[49:56.720 --> 50:00.720]  humanity will rise up and defeat it. And we're already seeing that where they beta tested all
[50:00.720 --> 50:04.960]  this in Australia. They're getting scared in the system. They know it's backfiring.
[50:04.960 --> 50:08.560]  Do you concur with that analysis or what's your what's your prognosis for the future?
[50:09.680 --> 50:13.600]  You don't have to suspend all of these constitutional liberties that are designed
[50:13.600 --> 50:18.720]  to protect both truth and justice unless you're on the wrong side of both truth and justice.
[50:18.720 --> 50:24.400]  And their awareness of it, their self-awareness of it is reflected in the various procedural
[50:24.400 --> 50:28.400]  tricks and techniques they're using. I mean, if they think a vaccine mandate is popular,
[50:28.400 --> 50:32.800]  why don't they pass it to the legislative branch? Not a single vaccine mandate. The
[50:32.800 --> 50:37.520]  only vaccine mandates ever approved by the Supreme Court, all of them were approved by
[50:37.520 --> 50:43.680]  the legislature. Not a single vaccine mandate in America has been approved by a single legislature
[50:43.680 --> 50:49.680]  in America in the covid-19 context. And so that, by the way, I'm glad you raised that because it
[50:49.680 --> 50:54.400]  was pinned to the Twitter and Facebook and YouTube. Everywhere I went in the last two
[50:54.400 --> 51:00.720]  weeks was the headline Biden's mandate backed up by precedent and experts explain to people
[51:00.720 --> 51:05.040]  the same precedent that said they could sterilize black people, right? The same precedent that said
[51:05.040 --> 51:09.040]  black people were two thirds human. So just because the Supreme Court once said, you know,
[51:09.040 --> 51:12.880]  that blacks weren't human doesn't mean we should follow a lie like that. So why don't you tell them
[51:12.880 --> 51:17.120]  the so-called precedents they're hanging their hat on and what Sotomayor and what
[51:17.840 --> 51:24.000]  Amy Comey Barrett are hanging their tyrannical hats on? So I would say two things about that. One is
[51:24.640 --> 51:31.920]  it's noteworthy that both Barrett and Sotomayor were apparently too afraid to refer the whole
[51:31.920 --> 51:36.720]  vaccine mandate cases that they were presiding over to the whole court, which is supposed to
[51:36.720 --> 51:43.360]  happen. So that tells me that both Sotomayor and Barrett believe there may be a majority to strike
[51:43.360 --> 51:48.560]  down vaccine mandates on the court. And just so far, there's been unlucky at which justice
[51:48.560 --> 51:52.800]  handled those particular emergency appeals. So there's going to be some ones coming up that
[51:52.800 --> 51:57.600]  Thomas is going to be part of and Gorse is going to be part of. So actually, I would say that what
[51:57.600 --> 52:02.800]  Barrett and Sotomayor did to just more hope than some of us thought might be on the Supreme Court.
[52:02.800 --> 52:09.120]  But the second aspect of this is you're absolutely right. The legal precedents that exist for vaccine
[52:09.120 --> 52:16.240]  mandates have came from an era that was called the eugenics era, which is when it's one of the most
[52:16.240 --> 52:22.000]  despised era in the history of the Supreme Court. This was the same Supreme Court that said
[52:22.640 --> 52:28.480]  forced racial segregation was OK. This was the same Supreme Court that said you could force child
[52:28.480 --> 52:34.080]  labor for however many hours you wanted. This was the same Supreme Court that ultimately approved
[52:34.080 --> 52:40.640]  forced sterilizations of poor women. This is the same Supreme Court that their logic, their
[52:40.640 --> 52:47.040]  decisions led to forced detention camps for the Japanese in Korematsu. The vaccine case that was
[52:47.040 --> 52:52.560]  the core of that, I call it the first case of the foundational case of the trilogy of infamy, was
[52:52.560 --> 52:58.240]  the Jacobson decision. And nobody should be following it because of where that led. But putting
[52:58.240 --> 53:04.400]  that aside, even the Jacobson case and the subsequent school vaccine cases all involved a
[53:04.400 --> 53:11.200]  very dangerous disease with a very safe and effective proven vaccine over decades, in some
[53:11.200 --> 53:19.360]  cases over 100 years. And it involved a legislature that passed it, and the only limitation was on
[53:19.360 --> 53:26.160]  access to a particular public school ground or a small fine in the case of Jacobson. The Supreme
[53:26.160 --> 53:33.360]  Court has never approved of any vaccine that was mandated by someone other than the legislature.
[53:33.360 --> 53:38.480]  They have never approved a vaccine that is not even biologically licensed. They have never
[53:38.480 --> 53:43.200]  approved a decision of a vaccine that does not have a long history of proven success.
[53:43.200 --> 53:48.800]  And they have never approved a forced vaccine where the disease poses so little risk as this
[53:48.800 --> 53:54.560]  one does to people like children, as an example. And so there's a lot of reasons why the Jacobson
[53:54.560 --> 54:00.560]  decision, even if the court wanted to consider it good law, it's not good law. But even if it were,
[54:00.560 --> 54:06.800]  it has no application to this context. The Supreme Court has never approved, basically Facebook,
[54:06.800 --> 54:12.320]  Twitter, the social media giants had a bunch of corporate lawyer types go out and lie to people
[54:12.320 --> 54:17.680]  for the last week and tell them that, oh, this has complete approval. That's a lie. It does not.
[54:17.680 --> 54:23.600]  It has never had this kind of vaccine, has never had the judicial approval from the Supreme Court
[54:23.600 --> 54:28.960]  under these circumstances. And so we will find out what the courts will do in this context.
[54:28.960 --> 54:33.600]  But so far, they have enforced religious rights and hopefully they enforce additional rights,
[54:33.600 --> 54:40.480]  because the same U.S. Supreme Court has said that you cannot detain someone against their will
[54:40.480 --> 54:45.360]  or put anything in their body. They have a you have a right against forced medications
[54:45.360 --> 54:50.000]  and you have a right, even if you're a danger to yourself in certain circumstances,
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.560]  they can't deprive you of your civil liberties. You have to be a clear convincing evidence that
[54:54.560 --> 54:58.960]  you're an imminent risk to other people in the mental health context. And Marge,
[54:58.960 --> 55:02.400]  you knocked it out of the park today. I know we're almost out of time and Dr. Fleming's about
[55:02.400 --> 55:06.080]  to come in here. I just can't wait to see his PowerPoint presentation. He's probably when it
[55:06.080 --> 55:10.160]  comes to documents and proof from around the world, the most devastating to show that the
[55:10.160 --> 55:15.280]  majority of sick folks and those dying have taken the poison shots. His PowerPoint, I've seen it as
[55:15.280 --> 55:20.800]  just over the top folks call everybody, you know, tell them to tune in now and also share this once
[55:20.800 --> 55:25.440]  it's archived. It may end up video. But let me raise this issue. The thirty five thousand
[55:25.440 --> 55:30.320]  foot view. You're down at the one foot view and it's dead on. What about this being from the big
[55:30.320 --> 55:35.040]  corporations, from the U.N., about a global idea, about the great reset? They admit they're taking
[55:35.040 --> 55:39.680]  the total power, medical surveillance into the carbon tax. That's now happening. It's been
[55:39.680 --> 55:44.560]  announced. It's not our opinion. Mastercard's coming out. United Airlines, Delta. I mean,
[55:44.560 --> 55:50.400]  it's all here. How do we, as you know, a people educate the politicians, the leaders, the ones
[55:50.400 --> 55:57.520]  that are good, like the Santas and Rand Paul and, you know, others to explain to people that this
[55:57.520 --> 56:02.320]  this is a corporate takeover, that this is putting a new experimental drug in us. I mean, they know
[56:02.320 --> 56:07.520]  they brag it's a precedent and they're getting rid of nation states. That's qua swab says former
[56:07.520 --> 56:11.920]  head of the Bilderberg Group, we're capturing the nation states. The people have no power. I mean,
[56:11.920 --> 56:17.680]  he says this on the Davos Group website. He says it on his Wikipedia page. It's his group
[56:17.680 --> 56:24.000]  editing his own page. He's proud of capturing countries. So this is true authoritarianism
[56:24.000 --> 56:30.000]  that transcends liberal or conservative. I mean, I'm not an enemy of this Travis County judge
[56:30.560 --> 56:34.400]  that's doing all this. I'm scared for the country in the future. I can't believe
[56:34.400 --> 56:39.120]  they got people acting like this. I'm not enemies with, you know, even Barack Obama.
[56:39.360 --> 56:48.240]  I don't like him or George Soros. Why are they so evil? And how do we how do we get the public
[56:48.240 --> 56:54.480]  to realize this is a new type of war? I mean, we are being usurped by corporations that fund and
[56:54.480 --> 57:00.320]  put in people at every level that will overthrow our country. And the people doing it are actually
[57:00.320 --> 57:04.000]  dumb enough, I think, to actually think they're doing a good job. I mean, that's the road to
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.960]  hell paved with good intentions. But the people designing the road and getting the useful idiots
[57:08.960 --> 57:13.360]  to build the road know exactly what they're doing. So what's the international strategy?
[57:13.360 --> 57:18.560]  Nuremberg to what are the mechanisms to go after Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the globalist?
[57:19.840 --> 57:24.560]  Well, the utility is we were supposed to have ended all of this with the Nuremberg
[57:24.560 --> 57:30.240]  Code of 1947, which we enforced retroactively because we said this has always been the case
[57:30.240 --> 57:34.800]  with the Nuremberg Code did was simply put in writing what had always been true. And that's
[57:34.800 --> 57:39.680]  how we were able to prosecute the Nazis. It was because we were able to say this was always the
[57:39.680 --> 57:44.880]  case. And this was the case in 1930 and 1935 and 1940, long before the Nuremberg Code was
[57:44.880 --> 57:50.560]  officially recognized as such in 1947. And I think the three components that are useful in the Court
[57:50.560 --> 57:56.880]  of Public Opinion is one to remind people of our history. This is really it's a new methodology,
[57:56.880 --> 58:02.160]  but it's an old idea. They're taking the old ideas from the eugenics era, when the which was
[58:02.160 --> 58:07.600]  ultimately expressed in its most horrific form by the Nazis that exposed it for what it is.
[58:07.600 --> 58:12.880]  But this is a attempt to recreate the old legal precedents and political precedents
[58:12.880 --> 58:17.600]  and public health power that they had during the eugenics era. And we should remember what
[58:17.600 --> 58:21.760]  happened and remind people of what happened when we gave the state that kind of power.
[58:21.760 --> 58:27.360]  It led to Nazi atrocities. It led to forced sterilizations of poor people. It led to mass
[58:27.360 --> 58:32.320]  force detention camps of people based on just where their grandpapa was born. So that's part
[58:32.320 --> 58:37.920]  one. Part two is to remind people of what the impact of these precedents would be going forward.
[58:37.920 --> 58:42.240]  Maybe they're scared of Covid. Maybe they you know, they have a particular opinion about this
[58:42.240 --> 58:47.040]  one. But what about the next time or the time after that? Because what's happening is people
[58:47.040 --> 58:51.600]  are being treated not only with like the equivalent of a yellow star during the Nazi era,
[58:51.600 --> 58:56.640]  but like a lot of people during the HIV era where people were discriminated against based on pure
[58:56.640 --> 59:02.880]  prejudice. And we're redoing it all over again, labeling back. And they pass laws and in court,
[59:02.880 --> 59:07.440]  as you know, back in the early 80s saying you can't discriminate if somebody has HIV.
[59:07.440 --> 59:12.000]  They're telling all of us wear a mask. All of us take a shot. All of us are dirty. All humans are
[59:12.000 --> 59:16.880]  evil. All of us are to be discriminated against by the mega corporations that give us our sacrament.
[59:16.880 --> 59:21.760]  And then in the word of God, you must take it or you're not listening to God. That's the governor
[59:21.760 --> 59:27.280]  of New York. Exactly. That's the third aspect of all of this is to remind people the broader
[59:27.280 --> 59:32.880]  philosophical issues that are in play. This is about core rights. This is about basic elemental
[59:32.880 --> 59:38.320]  rights that we've established and fought centuries to establish. And we have to protect and preserve
[59:38.320 --> 59:42.160]  them. This is about the about something we've been talking about for years. This is about the
[59:42.160 --> 59:47.360]  American model versus the Chinese model. And are we going to have the Chinese social credit model?
[59:47.360 --> 59:51.120]  Are we going to have the American liberty model? And we all have to fight for the American liberty
[59:51.120 --> 59:56.080]  model. I mean, you had NBA players expressing it yesterday saying, look, what is America all about
[59:56.080 --> 59:59.680]  supposed to be about freedom? And if you and by the way, those guys need talk shows,
[59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.880]  they're more well-spoken than you and I. And we're some of the best-spoken people out there.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:07.040]  Just I mean, exactly. They're getting so many people that haven't been political off the
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:12.000]  bench now. And that's got to be scaring the system. Absolutely. The system underestimated
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.160]  opposition and underestimated the court of public opinion and underestimated people like the
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.120]  audience of Infowars. The I mean, the continued the reason for all of the continuous assaults
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.880]  and probably for the court accelerating these these crazy remedies, in my view,
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.680]  these punitive actions is because you were supposed to be wiped out. Infowars was supposed
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.720]  to be wiped out. But it's failed because they keep underestimating the conscience and cognitive
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:40.480]  capabilities of the ordinary everyday American who refuses, as Dylan Thomas talked about,
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:45.840]  to go gently into that good night and to continue to rage and rage against the dying of the light.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.000]  If we continue to do so and continue to support places like Infowars,
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.920]  then the fight will continue. And ultimately, justice will prevail.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.520]  Well, absolutely. Look, I've expected to be attacked. They're trying to put Owen in jail
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.560]  for just covering the January 6th thing from outside there. They're keeping Marine Corps
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.880]  lieutenant colonels in jail without charging him for criticizing the collapse of Afghanistan,
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.200]  while other militaries allowed to say we're ready to shoot Americans, we're going to get you.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:16.640]  But, you know, that's OK. And it's not that my rights have been violated. It's that everybody's
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.040]  and my children's have. I mean, this is you can read the Seventh Amendment. It's right there.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:26.400]  And so, you know, I criticize this judge, these people, not even as someone in that courtroom,
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.520]  but as an American citizen, I would be covering this regardless. I mean, even liberals say
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.720]  this is unheard of. But Jones wouldn't give them anything. I bit over. You were there. You helped
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.800]  early on. We actually met with the lawyers that are involved right now. Eighty one thousand
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:46.720]  documents. Eighty one thousand documents to two days of depositions myself, all the basic
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:53.120]  employees grilling them and nothing. It's not true. And so, again, they're afraid. Oh, my God,
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:58.640]  we can't have a jury. And so, OK, well, we'll just then we'll just say he's guilty. No judge.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.040]  I mean, no jury, no nothing. It's crazy. And no other judge would do something like this.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:06.320]  But I guess it'll set a precedent now. It'll be called the Alex Jones precedent,
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:11.120]  where you don't get a jury. I mean, that's the risk with all these cases,
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:17.040]  is that they made law about the First Amendment that has never been made before, that severely
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:22.960]  makes it a potential illegal act to voice a theory of a case that the institutional
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.440]  narrative disagrees with. That's never been illegal before. And when it's been illegal,
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.320]  it's saying something factually false about a specific person. And they change the law in this,
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:37.120]  in your cases, to say, oh, no, that that will no longer applies either. So there's a whole bunch of
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:43.120]  Alex Jones loophole exceptions to the Constitution that are all about politically punitive actions
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:48.480]  that suggest a a legal process that's scared of a trial on the merit.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:53.280]  Absolutely. You're absolutely right. And again, just experiencing it, being there,
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.080]  just I mean, giving them stuff had nothing to do with Sandy Hook. Give us this, give us that.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:02.960]  We know you're still hiding it. And then to hear I gave them nothing. And to see people
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:07.360]  with a straight face say that, you know, you see in history, examples of corrupt judiciary
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.760]  and things that you thank God, thank God a little in America, and then you just witness it for
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:18.880]  yourself. It is absolutely crazy. Look at that CNN headline. Since when do you hear a judge rules,
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:24.480]  not a jury? Absolutely crazy. Robert Barnes, thank you for all your time today. I think you agree
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.960]  with me. The worm is starting to turn against this vaccine tyranny. The globalists did it out
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.840]  of desperation to stop populism, to bring the U.N. out as the world authority. And they got a lot of
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:38.240]  headway. But just like Hitler invading Russia in World War Two or Napoleon to use the Russian
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.680]  allegory, they're now getting stuck in the mud of the winter, aren't they? No doubt there's a record
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:49.200]  level of people taking red pills over the last year. And the more people that awake and wake up
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:54.480]  to what's taking place, the better chance Liberty has to survive. All right. Tell me,
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:59.760]  Lord, they can find your very, very popular podcast and shows. Yes. So if people want,
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:06.240]  there's some examples of letters that no copyright asserted. So if you have are facing an employment
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:11.280]  situation or other circumstances, no legal advice. It's just a free letter that people can use and
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:19.600]  have used successfully. You can go to Viva Barnes law dot locals dot com. That's Viva Barnes law
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.280]  dot locals dot com. And pinned at the top is an example of a letter that's been very successful
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.640]  for many employees across the country. Well, you and your co-host do a great job. I'd love
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:34.160]  to get you both on some Saturday or some Sunday for a commercial free show. These are so popular
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.680]  where you guys can really roll together and I can ask questions. We can see we're going to take
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.840]  calls on these shows, too, so that people can call with questions. Thank you, Robert Barnes.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.160]  Glad to be here. And yeah, you know, Barnes is a great lawyer and I've got Norm Patterson,
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.440]  others that are, you know, some of the top first time lawyers in the country. And they've said,
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.960]  you know, Jones, just let us be critical of what's happening. Don't antagonize things.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.520]  Isn't about antagonizing things. I'm a citizen. First Amendment that's being violated with these
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.320]  suits. The Sixth Amendment, the Seventh Amendment. And it's just outrageous. It's absolutely
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:09.280]  outrageous. And it's it's it's over the top because they know I didn't say and do the things
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:14.080]  they said I did. And they know that focus groups have been done. They know that. They know they're
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:19.200]  going to lose a jury trial, but they can handpick one and have the jury say or have the jury told
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.320]  he's guilty. You will now decide an amount that's unheard of that that's new. They think they can
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:30.880]  try to create this this new precedent, this new law, this new judicial law, which, again,
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.800]  you're not supposed to legislate from the bench. So.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.800]  We're just going to have to go the route of judicial complaints and just a lot of other
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:46.080]  things and some really serious legal, lawful political actions here, because I just can't
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:51.520]  see the First Amendment and the Seventh Amendment torched in front of everybody here for my children
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.280]  and your children. I mean, this is this is absolutely out of control. What's happening
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.360]  in America on every front? It's dangerous. It's very, very dangerous.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:05.280]  OK, let me hit this final big piece, and I appreciate Fleming waiting. I went on a little
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.200]  bit late today here on Saturday afternoon, Saturday evening. I can't wait to see Dr.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:12.560]  Richard M. Fleming give his presentation. We're going to put it out, of course,
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.160]  on this full show and we're going to cut it out and put it out as his own
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:23.440]  deep analysis and information. But but let me hit this final big piece of news and then we'll bring
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:29.760]  Dr. Fleming in and he's going to take over things. But before we do that. We are funding this
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:34.560]  operation in the face of the Democratic Party. We are funding it in the face of Soros and the
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:40.720]  globalist who hate my guts and want me off the air. We the same Democratic Party law firms that
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:47.840]  sued Remington into bankruptcy. And now closing its doors and being broken up, the oldest gun
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:54.800]  company in American history is the same group. So I'm extremely honored to have the absolute
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:00.640]  enemies of this country bought and paid for to end our liberties and freedoms coming after me,
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:07.520]  because it means I'm over the target. So. We're going to stay on the air one way or another,
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:12.800]  you can believe that I'm working seven days a week now, I'm going to be starting other shows,
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:17.200]  I'm going to do more. We're going to get three times bigger. I was planning, quite frankly,
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:23.680]  I told my crew this five years ago to phase out and let the crew set up their own media system
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:28.240]  and keep doing it themselves. And I would come on maybe once a week and do a podcast and appear here
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:32.000]  and there. But I've got books, I want to write films I want to make. And I've been doing talk
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.520]  radio for four hours a day for over twenty five years. And that was my plan. And then, you know,
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:42.000]  it's there never happened because I've been attacked and all the rest of this. So instead,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.200]  the system chose what they wanted. So now. When I don't drink, it's because I've got
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:53.200]  to have this victory. When I do extra shows, it's because of how I'm being persecuted.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.520]  When I when I hiked five miles this morning, it was because of that. When I ended up doing
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:02.560]  more and making films again, it's because of the persecution. And that's the way it always is.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:07.280]  And so that's how the Lord works in mysterious ways. I guess God didn't want me to quietly,
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.440]  you know, not retire, but cut way back. So God did this to me. And I understand it's a blessing
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:15.520]  and I actually enjoy it. I feel better than I've ever felt. I feel totally energized. And this type
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:21.200]  of persecution with these rigged courts is just the tip of the iceberg. I mean, there's horrible
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.640]  stuff that's been done to my family, horrible things to my children that I won't even say
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:29.840]  here on air and give the enemy pleasure. But if you think any of this or indicting and arresting
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:35.600]  our crew members for no reason and intimidates us, it's the opposite. I bound out of bed at
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.960]  five a.m. I go to sleep, sleep wonderfully. Best I've ever slept. And I just am so energized.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.840]  And so focused because I know I'm right. And I know you guys are evil. I know you're going to be
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.440]  defeated politically and you've already been defeated in God's eyes.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:53.520]  So, and listeners know that they're really supporting us right now. And that's good
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.960]  because we got a lot of projects. A lot of things need to be done. A lot of supports needed.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.200]  And if you want to see us fight even harder and literally wake up the world and get the
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:08.720]  major thought leaders awake from Tucker Carlson to Joe Rogan to Steven Crowder, all of them will
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.760]  tell you I'm one of their major influences, not the main influence. And we've got others
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.240]  up behind the scenes you wouldn't believe. Advising major world leaders, major members
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.960]  of parliament, members of Senate Congress, they all tune in here. Everybody does. It's the guilty,
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:28.320]  guilty, not pleasure, but guilty awakening. It's the next level of consciousness. Not me, not you,
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.240]  not the guests, but all of us with God together is that next level of resistance. We are the
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:37.440]  dip of the tip of the spear. We are the heart of the heart of the zeitgeist. And so go to

[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:29.680]  going to hit this tomorrow night. I'm going to hit this tomorrow night in depth with Mike Adams.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.320]  Now there's a bunch of different angles of this. I'm gonna hit it quickly. And then we're going to
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:38.400]  go to break, come back with Dr. Fleming. But the article is on info wars.com from naturals.com. AI
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:46.080]  powered DOD data analysis program shatters official vaccine narrative shows ADE accelerating
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:52.080]  and fully vaccinated each week. Now this is so big that it makes me have an anxiety attack
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.280]  because I already had all the top scientists on. I already knew this was going on. I already knew
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:58.960]  what was going to happen. I believe them. I mean like the former head scientist at Pfizer,
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.720]  the top EU advisor, Dr. Wolfgang Woodard, the inventor of MRNA. On and on and on.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.960]  All come out. They all say this and then it all starts happening. And then the Pentagon surveils
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:17.200]  all of Medicare, Medicaid, the hospitals, everything. And a program called Project Solace
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:22.160]  analyzed data from 5.6 million Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and found the vast
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:28.080]  majority of COVID hospitalizations are occurring among fully vaccinated individuals. And even
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.120]  Australia, it's not even the majority that were vaccinated, but it's triple the number
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:37.840]  basically what's 76 and 12. 76% in hospital had both shots. 18% of the other, the other,
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.840]  the other. It's almost a hundred percent of the sick are the ones that have it and the death.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:46.880]  It's very alarming findings. Now the shots are even worse for blacks and Hispanics.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.120]  And it just goes on and on. And this is all from the Pentagon,
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:58.720]  ladies and gentlemen, and their own AI situation. And they've confirmed that they're not vaccines
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:02.720]  and they don't work out for five to six months. And then they start making you sick from regular
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:08.000]  viruses in the environment because you have the big auto-immune cytokine storm response.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.200]  Vaccine failure dramatically worse is five to six months. There it all is right there.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:16.320]  And it just goes on and on with all the numbers showing how it forces the,
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:21.840]  the virus to mutate, even making more deadly ones. Everything we predicted conclusion post
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.840]  vaccine health outcomes are worsening over time. Meaning the vaccines appear to be gradually
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:30.160]  damaging the immune system over subsequent months, making vaccinated individuals far worse,
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.960]  vulnerable and subsequent infections. This is the very definition of ADE antibody dependent
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:40.560]  enhancement about which many analysts such as Dr. Sher, Tim Penny have warned. And now it's here.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:46.720]  And here it is from the overview from the Pentagon, the joint artificial intelligence center.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.800]  And here are them in the news talking about how they surveil at all and how they did the program.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:58.160]  And then now here we are here later. And what are they telling us is going on? This is just
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:04.640]  ab salutely incredible. And remember the politicians are all exempt around the world,
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:10.080]  ladies and gentlemen. All right, we're going to go to break with a very, very important report.
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.280]  About what's happening in Australia and the fight back. And then an extremely important report
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:21.600]  that has come out from Greg Reese, the guilty will be punished. And we're also going to get
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:28.240]  to another Greg Reese report about the vaccines are a thousand times more deadly than COVID-19.
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:34.960]  So we're going to have a report three and report four that are going to be airing as well. We
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:38.560]  already aired the guilty will be punished. I want to thank the crew for the incredible job.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.840]  I want to thank Dr. Fleming for coming in as well. On the other side,
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:46.240]  Dr. Fleming takes over with this incredible life-saving PowerPoint. And again, if I tried
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.200]  to read you his whole bio, let me just go ahead and do that now because it needs to be done.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:54.240]  Dr. Richard M. Fleming is a cardiologist, nuclear cardiologist certified in
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:02.640]  post-Iran emission tomography jurisprudence, doctor of law, researcher, inventor, and author.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:07.920]  In 94, Dr. Fleming presented to the American heart association, his theory that cardiovascular
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:12.800]  disease was due to inflation or inflammation, which we're now seeing the inflammation,
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.760]  which was the theory in 1994 has become well-known fact for decades and was highlighted
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:25.920]  in the 2004 with a feature on ABC news nightly 2020. He has the patent pound nine five six six
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:32.560]  oh three seven was issued. Dr. Fleming on February 14th, 2017 Fleming method patent covers all
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.400]  methods and devices able to measure metabolic and regional blood flow differences. The
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.200]  breakthrough made it possible to differentiate functionality of tissue, tissue types,
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:49.760]  as well as non-tissue and the treatment and measurement of responding using all isotopes,
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:55.040]  enhancing agents and devices table of detecting and measuring isotopes. His knowledge and patent
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:00.160]  enables previously undetectable inflammation to be seen and measured with levels of accuracy not
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:05.440]  found in most common scanning techniques or devices. Fleming method.com. And he's got the
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:09.920]  best site to with all the graphs and all the documentation. So he's coming up on the other
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:22.720]  side right now. Stay with us. Many are now awakened to the harsh reality of depopulation
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:28.480]  and democide, which we find ourselves in today. And the end game is out in the open
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.280]  to destroy humanity under the guise of transhumanism.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:40.960]  What we've unfortunately learned is that there is an overwhelming herd of us who will do whatever
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:48.320]  they are told by the system, which explains how we've gotten this far. There are seemingly
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:54.800]  millions who will believe whatever pop culture tells them, including the mass denial of natural
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:01.120]  health and immunity. While attempting to criminalize a knowledge base spanning millennia,
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:08.720]  corporate pop culture prostitutes spew talking points for big pharma's MRNA mystery cocktail
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:15.360]  as the only solution. And if the solution is less people, which is what the elitists have been
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:22.080]  saying for decades, then they are succeeding. Multiple studies conducted in the UK show that
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:28.800]  after the vaccine was introduced, COVID deaths increased by over a thousand percent and more
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:36.560]  than half of all COVID deaths and hospitalizations are from the fully vaccinated. The numbers in New
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:44.480]  York City are showing the same. Experts in the field, including the inventor of the MRNA tech
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:50.320]  being used, have been warning of this since the beginning, but silenced by the corporate media.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:58.640]  Project Veritas has recently exposed how doctors and nurses are well aware of the dangerous MRNA
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:06.240]  jabs, but care more about their own jobs and how even low level big pharma employees care only
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:14.320]  about the numbers. It is an all out attack against the human race. We knew this a year ago because we
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:20.640]  know they're white papers, which is why we know what comes next. Brought to you by the same
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:28.960]  characters behind the MRNA vaccines. What comes next is the end of natural organic humanity and
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:38.400]  the beginning of man's own version. Man fused with machine in a lab. The end. There is no more hiding
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:46.400]  the end game. It's out in the open where only the unbrainwashed can see it. Ultimately, it will be
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:51.440]  up to the people. The police in Australia are loyally serving their globalist masters.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:57.920]  What makes you think anything will be different in America? A flight surgeon for the U.S. Army
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:04.480]  has warned that all vaccinated pilots are unfit to fly. The U.S. military is being
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:10.240]  destroyed from within. The only way through to freedom is for the people to say no,
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:18.400]  which is now starting to happen all across the world. Humanity uniting together as the human race,
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:26.240]  standing up against the most sophisticated tyranny that mankind has ever faced, all while the pop
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:33.520]  culture media machine ignores it. A worldwide peaceful revolution of the people is a numbers
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:41.120]  game. So continuing to wake people up is our road to liberation. Do not remain silent during
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:47.280]  this dire time at the crossroads of human history. It is the truth that shall set us free.

[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:15.680]  But I also want to make very clear that all of us should look forward to what we can get
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:21.520]  once we hit that 70 percent double dose. And as the road map that we released indicated
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:27.280]  at 70 percent double dose, you will be required under the health orders to only be able to
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.680]  frequent venues if you're vaccinated. And I just want to make that very clear. It's black and
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:38.640]  white. If you're not vaccinated, you can't go to a restaurant. You can't go to a cafe at 70 percent
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:43.280]  double dose. Everybody, every business leader, every community member should be very clear
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.800]  that the health orders will be saying that you cannot go and do anything on the road map,
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:55.200]  which will be specified unless you are completely vaccinated. Everybody who is fully vaccinated at
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:00.080]  70 percent will get freedoms. Let me make that very clear. If you have made the effort of getting
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:05.360]  yourself vaccinated by the time we open up at 70 percent, you will be able to go and eat at a cafe.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:09.280]  You'll be able to get your hair cut. You'll be able to do all those things we've all missed.
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:14.080]  And even though the government is saying unvaccinated people might have other rights
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:19.200]  from the first of December, a lot of airlines have said they won't carry anybody who's not vaccinated.
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:24.160]  A lot of businesses have said we won't welcome anyone that's unvaccinated. I want to be very
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:28.480]  clear life for the unvaccinated will be very difficult indefinitely.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.400]  Good afternoon, everyone. I'm here to make a public statement and won't be taking any
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:50.000]  questions. I've had to make an extremely difficult decision overnight, but one which I feel obliged
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.960]  to do because of the love and respect I have for the people of New South Wales and the high regard
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:00.240]  which I have for the opposite from you. I was advised late yesterday afternoon the independent
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:04.560]  commission against corruption will today release a public statement in which it will state it is
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:09.280]  investigating allegations made about me concerning matters relating to the former member for Wagga
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:14.720]  Wagga. As it is clear from the ICAC statement, the issues which it is investigating are historic
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.280]  matters that have already been the subject of numerous attacks on me by political opponents in
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:24.480]  the last four months. Now comes the part where we throw our heads back and laugh. Ready?
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:35.200]  Hello, my name is Dr. Richard Fleming. A couple weeks ago Alex Jones was kind enough to invite
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:40.720]  me onto his program to talk briefly about the drug vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.880]  Today I want to take just a moment to give you some more in-depth information about these viruses
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:51.520]  and these vaccines as well as some of the legal proceedings that we are pursuing in
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:56.080]  the International Criminal Court to hold the people accountable for the development of this
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:03.680]  virus and the dissemination of these vaccines. The first question to ask is do drug vaccine
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:09.760]  biologics work? Can they work and how? Next slide please. You'll see here at the very beginning of
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:23.120]  2020. Does this mean that if I get the vaccine, I won't get infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:30.160]  That means that there's a 95% chance that you will not get symptomatic infection,
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:37.360]  namely that you won't get infected to the point that you get symptoms. We are unsure right now
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:44.000]  what the protection is against infection because it's conceivable that you could get vaccinated,
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:51.200]  get exposed, get infected, not know it because the vaccine is protecting you against symptoms,
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:58.480]  but that you could have virus in your nasopharynx, which is the reason why we say until we prove
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:05.200]  that the vaccine prevents transmission, that people who are vaccinated should wear a mask
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:08.960]  when they're near people who might be vulnerable to infection.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:19.680]  Early in 2020, you can back that up one slide please. Early in 2020, this comedian who was
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:25.760]  from Mexico had an opportunity to ask Dr. Anthony Fauci about the vaccines themselves long before
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:31.680]  they were popularly used and disseminated and forced upon the U.S. and world population.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:38.000]  One of the big misunderstandings about vaccines is that they somehow prevent you from getting
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:45.280]  infected or spreading an infection. For a vaccine to actually work, it has to be given to a person,
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:50.960]  allow you to make an immune response, and then the only way it actually is any benefit to anybody is
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:58.560]  if you then get infected with the virus because it's that second infection with the real virus
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:04.160]  coming at you from person to person transfer. That's really what's being targeted. In the
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:09.600]  absence of you getting infected by somebody else with the actual virus, the vaccine has no effect
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:14.320]  except for the consequences of giving you the vaccine, all the inflammation of blood clotting
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:19.520]  that we're seeing on the VAERS adverse event sites, and all the deaths that are associated
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:29.040]  with the vaccines. Next slide please. Now I only have six basic concerns about the drug vaccines,
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:35.040]  and I'm going to briefly lay them out here for you over the next few slides. The first part is
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:41.040]  that we have always taken a virus in the past and taken every type of that virus and put it together
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:47.120]  with all of its parts, so the spike proteins and the membrane and the envelope and everything else,
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:52.720]  and then we've weakened it and injected it into people. In fact, in 2007, the Chinese did this
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:59.680]  quite successfully with SARS-CoV-1, but by taking all the different types of variants of the virus
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:06.160]  and all the parts of the virus, when you give that to someone in a vaccine, the person develops
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:12.800]  an immune response or benefit to all of the variants and all of the parts of the virus so
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:17.920]  that no matter which one you get exposed to, you're protected. Next slide please.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:29.600]  This study shows that 2007 study by the Chinese where they took a number of healthy, they took
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:36.160]  36 individuals, 18 men and women, all who had no problems, and they divided them into three groups.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:41.360]  Two different ones got vaccines and one got a placebo group, and if you look down here in the
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:46.000]  graphic, you'll see at the very beginning at zero weeks, there was no antibody response.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:52.880]  At 28 weeks with the second injection, the people who got the drug vaccine developed antibody
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:30:00.000]  responses to all of the virus of the SARS-CoV-2, not just to the spike protein, but to the spike
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:07.040]  protein and to the membrane and the envelope and everything else that makes these coronaviruses
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:16.960]  so infectious. Next slide please. The second concern is that they've picked out one specific
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:24.480]  spike protein. This spike protein is the original one that was found in Wuhan, and so you've heard
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:35.600]  delta virus and mu virus and alpha. The original virus is called SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan HU1. That's the
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:42.000]  spike protein that they targeted, and by targeting that specific spike protein, they're asking our
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:48.480]  immune systems to respond to that spike protein. Nothing else about the virus and any spike protein
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:54.480]  that's too much different from that HU1 spike protein, the farther it gets away from that,
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:31:00.160]  the less likely these vaccines will have any benefit if at all. Next slide please.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:08.640]  Now this rather complicated graphic is the brilliant work of Jean-Claude Perez
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:15.920]  and other individuals who have looked at these spike proteins and the vaccines.
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:27.120]  This shows the makeup of the Wuhan HU1 spike protein. In red, the squiggly red lines show the
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:34.400]  genes that make up the spike protein, and the blue line shows the spike protein itself. Now that's
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:38.960]  important because that tells you what you're actually looking at. Next slide please.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.720]  Here is in fact, go ahead and I think there's some things to advance here.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:51.360]  Here we're going to see the actual Wuhan spike protein in the upper left-hand corner,
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:56.640]  and in the upper right-hand corner you're going to see the Moderna lipid nanoparticle vaccine,
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:02.480]  mRNA, and in the very bottom right you're going to see the Pfizer lipid nanoparticle, mRNA,
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:09.440]  and what you need to notice here is that the red lines and the blue lines of the Wuhan spike
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:18.080]  protein, the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine don't match, which means that what's
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:28.080]  in those vaccines do not genetically match the Wuhan HU1 virus. So when they say they are giving
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:35.200]  us a vaccine that is the exact same thing as the virus, well this data shows that since the red and
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:43.120]  blue lines don't match, the proteins being made and the nucleotide genetic codes are not the same
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:52.720]  as the virus. Next slide please. The third concern is that given the evidence
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:33:00.080]  that we know that the genetic code of this virus and the proteins being made are not identical to
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:08.080]  the Wuhan HU1 spike protein, the next question is what else is not quite correct about what
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:14.160]  we're being told? And the amount of immune response that we're being told that these vaccines
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:22.880]  have indicate that something else is amiss, that in fact what we're really seeing are self-amplifying
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:33.120]  mRNA vaccines. The acronym is SAM. Next slide please. What we see in the left half here is a
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:39.280]  conventional vaccine with A. You inject a certain genetic code into somebody, you get a certain
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:45.680]  protein response. B shows what happens when you take another piece of that genetic code
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:52.080]  that replicates the virus, which is earlier in the genetic code, and you include that in the vaccine
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:59.120]  and you see you get more spike protein or more immune response. Now back in March of this year,
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:05.280]  I cautioned people that it looked to me like this must be what's going on. And if in fact this is
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:13.440]  what's going on, that the mRNA vaccines are self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, it means that we haven't
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:20.400]  been told the truth about everything that's in these vaccines. It's critical because the funding
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:24.320]  that's been paid for, and you can see down the papers where they were published, the New England
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:30.480]  Journal of Medicine and Nature Ecology and Evolution, these same self-amplifying mRNAs
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:36.800]  have been associated with new types of vaccines that are called transmissible and transferable.
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:44.240]  These are studies being done to see if you can inject one person or one, in this case,
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:51.600]  bat and get that person to transfer to the next person the vaccine. Now I'm not saying this is
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:57.600]  what's being done, but what I am saying is that the same people that are doing the self-amplifying
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:04.240]  mRNA research are doing these transmissible vaccine research. And why is this important?
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:10.240]  Next slide, please. Go ahead and just keep advancing those until we get to the next slide.
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:17.760]  Because if we look at the research data on self-amplifying mRNAs down here at the bottom left,
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:26.320]  and we look at the transmissible vaccines in the upper left, you'll see that the same people are
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:32.240]  funding these studies. And when you look at the bottom left and then you look at the table on the
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:39.440]  right, you will see that they have shown in this research self-amplifying mRNA research.
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:47.520]  They've shown multiple viruses including HIV, cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus,
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:56.160]  encephalitis virus, Zika virus, and they show what part of the protein is being made and whether it's
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:02.240]  a lipid nanoparticle. And if you look at the very top over here, second to the right, it says what
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:08.080]  animal is being used for this research. If you go down this column, you'll see mice, pigs, mice,
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:16.560]  pigs, sheep, rats, except at the very top. The animal model being used for SARS-CoV-2
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:24.240]  self-amplifying mRNA research is human. Next slide, please.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:35.280]  Third problem that I have with that is the concept that these vaccines stay at the site
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:41.680]  of injection. We're told that the injection goes in, stays in the muscle, doesn't move around in
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:52.240]  the body, and we know for a fact that this is not true. We know for a fact from the animal studies
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:57.440]  that were done, from the Moderna studies that were done with influenza virus vaccines from
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:03.040]  lipid nanoparticles in 2017, that these vaccines are found in the brain, in the bone marrow,
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:06.560]  in the heart, in the liver, in the spleen, all these organs that are being affected by
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:13.040]  these adverse drug reactions to these vaccines were shown back in 2017.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:23.600]  It's also important to understand that when you get infected normally by a virus, it comes into
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:31.200]  your body and before it gets into your cells, that virus is available for your immune system to
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:38.480]  respond to. Now the first part of your immune system is called the innate immune system.
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:47.440]  That is critical for you to be protected not only if you acquire the infection from another person,
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:55.440]  but if you're trying to build immunity from a drug vaccine. Why? Because that is the first part that
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:02.400]  is fundamental for your body to recognize that it's being invaded. And in the process of seeing
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:09.360]  the virus, you have cells that eat that virus, tear it down, share it with other cells, and one
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:16.960]  of those other cells that are made are what's called T helper 2 cells. T helper 2 cells are
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:24.880]  critical because for antibodies to be made, the T helper 2 cells from the innate immune system
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:33.360]  have to join with the B cells, the antibody making cells, that come from the adaptive humoral immune
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:39.920]  system that's laid on top of innate. So innate has to be activated for the antibodies to work.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:45.760]  T helper 2 has to be activated for the antibodies to really be made. Next slide please.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:52.560]  When lipid nanoparticle vaccines are injected,
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:01.520]  they're coated with cholesterol. So when your body sees that, it sees cholesterol.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:07.920]  It sees lipids, lipid nanoparticle. That's not foreign to the human body, so it doesn't recognize
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:15.040]  that as being a virus invading. And instead of being outside with cells that can first
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:21.760]  eat that virus and then end up making those T helper 2 cells, it gets snuck into our cells
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:28.880]  and our cells start making the virus or the spike proteins without our innate immune system ever
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:36.320]  been awakened to it or activated. This set of data, and you can go ahead and click next so
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:43.920]  we'll get the fill in here, you can see what happens to liver and spleen and muscle when
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:52.800]  these lipid nanoparticles are injected. In fact, this is the study from 2017 with Moderna's lipid
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:40:02.320]  nanoparticle influenza vaccine and these are all the organ systems that they found the vaccines in.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:07.840]  The brain, the bone marrow, the liver, the spleen. In fact, they found them within a matter of hours
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:14.560]  and they lasted for five days in that study. So they not only don't stay where they're injected,
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:19.440]  they're there for the better part of a week. They invade all of our body parts. So when you're
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:25.440]  wondering whether it's possible for these vaccines to spread through the body, well, Moderna showed
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:31.520]  in 2017 that they do. So now when everybody is saying, wait a minute, it looks like these
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:37.920]  vaccines might spread outside of the area of injection, it's a little disingenuous to say,
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.960]  galley, we didn't know that because we did in 2017. Next slide, please.
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:52.000]  So here's kind of the process. Normally what you see on the left-hand part is a virus comes into
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:58.960]  the body and your body recognizes it as being abnormal and begins that innate immune system
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.400]  with T cell response, including T helper 2 cell.
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:09.520]  Well, the lipid nanoparticles won't get picked up that way because as we've already talked about,
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:16.480]  they sneak inside into the second part of it where your cells start making what's inside that vaccine.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:24.240]  Potentially the Janssen, which is typically referred to as Johnson and Johnson vaccine,
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:35.200]  or the AstraZeneca, which use an adenovirus and DNA of this SARS-CoV-2 as the vaccine,
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:42.720]  maybe that works. Well, the simple answer to that question is your innate immune system isn't seen
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:49.040]  SARS-CoV-2 when those vaccines are used. What your innate immune system sees is an adenovirus
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.840]  because that's the carrier virus taking that SARS-CoV-2 into your cells.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:03.520]  So the innate system for the Janssen and the AstraZeneca vaccines aren't responding
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:09.440]  to a SARS-CoV-2, they're responding to an adenovirus. And last time I checked,
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:14.480]  adenovirus and SARS-CoV-2 are two different viruses. Next slide, please.
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:21.200]  Now, this is the complicated drawing showing how this entire thing works.
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.640]  In the upper left-hand corner, you see that a virus comes into the body,
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:34.320]  whether it be adenovirus or Novavax, which is made out of moth cells using a virus that infects the
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:42.080]  cells of moths because it won't even infect human cells. And then your immune system eats that in
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:49.120]  the upper left-hand corner and turns what's called a naive T cell into a T helper 1 cell
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:56.240]  at the lower left, and that eventually will develop and release these chemicals that cause
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:01.680]  inflammation in the body, tissue necrosis factor interferon, which means it interferes with the
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:06.720]  virus. All of these things require this innate immune system to work. Next slide, please.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:19.200]  And this shows what happens when the T helper 1 cells get activated. They actually then will
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:25.360]  release other chemicals, interleukin-12 and a variety of others, to make this T helper 2 cell,
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:32.320]  which is critical because this T helper 2 cell has to respond to the B cell that makes the antibodies
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:40.720]  for your body to really know that you've identified the correct virus to increase the
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:44.720]  amount of B cells making this antibody and to make the right type of antibody.
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:52.720]  It's also critical to know that this initial innate T cell system is responsible for what's
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.920]  called cytotoxic T cells in the bottom left, and these are the cells that actually go in and say,
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:04.480]  wait a minute, cells of our body infected by a virus that needs to be killed and they kill
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:10.880]  the infected cell. Again, that's the innate system and bypassing this
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:17.040]  is tantamount to destroying the effect of our immune system to work. Next slide, please.
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:23.280]  How do we know all of this? You can hit the next slide and it will come up with script that people
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:29.440]  can read because real scientists and real researchers do more than say, gosh, it looks
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:33.920]  like the patients didn't develop COVID, which is what you're really being told.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:41.360]  What we do is we measure, is there a T cell response? Is there a T helper 2 cell response?
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:48.160]  Are these chemicals being made by the vaccines? Next, go ahead and click the next part. Are
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:54.560]  antibodies actually being made in response to these drug vaccines? In fact, what you will not
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:45:01.280]  see in the emergency use authorizations that the FDA used to clear these vaccines is any
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:07.120]  information that shows measurements of T cells or antibody response. Next slide, please.
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:14.080]  Specific concerns with drug vaccines. Next slide, please.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:21.360]  These drug, and you can click the next part, it's going to have some script here. How do we know
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:27.040]  what's actually happening inside the human body? We can measure the response of these T cells and
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:34.640]  B cells, or we can actually measure the tissue damage using a method that admittedly I patented
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:39.760]  called Fleming method, but has been made available for anybody who wants to use it completely free
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:47.040]  of charge. And we have already seen previously that other types of vaccines, well, in this one
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:51.680]  in particular, that they worked with mice and they showed an allergic response
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:02.800]  impairing these T helper 2 cells that are so critical. They showed this earlier with SARS-CoV-1
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:09.200]  and these slides for people who are science and medically oriented show a lot of these
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:16.080]  inflammatory cells building up in these mice in response to these vaccines. Next slide, please.
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:23.040]  And you can go ahead and hit next on this. Here is an example of what has been discovered with
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:29.120]  the Pfizer vaccine. You'll see the BioNTech, that's B-N-T, that's actually the company that
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:40.480]  makes these vaccines for Pfizer. After the second injection, they have first dose and second dose,
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:44.560]  they actually then other people have measured what type of
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:53.200]  innate immune response occurred with tissue necrosis factor alpha and with interleukin
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:47:01.680]  1 beta. And what has been shown with Pfizer vaccine is that once you inject that second
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:10.720]  injection of the Pfizer vaccine, it impairs the ability of your body to respond to influenza virus.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.960]  So it's interfering not only with the production of T helper 2 cells,
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:23.440]  but it's interfering with your then response if you get exposed to influenza. Next slide, please.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:31.600]  Go ahead and click the material. This is an example of the Pfizer vaccine actually showing
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:38.080]  reductions in our T cells after you get vaccinated. So this study was done and published
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:46.240]  in Nature in 2020, again using the Pfizer vaccine. And you can see here the count of the lymphocytes,
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:53.760]  the T cells, actually goes down following the initial injection with the Pfizer vaccine.
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:48:00.320]  Now it doesn't go down as much later on, but it certainly doesn't go up. Next slide, please.
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:09.760]  This is a rhesus study, rhesus monkey study using the Moderna vaccine. And what this study
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:15.840]  clearly showed that was published in New England Journal of Medicine is that when they looked at
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:25.680]  the memory CD4 cells, the T helper 2 response in number B with the red circle, there is no
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:34.960]  T helper 2 cell response using the Moderna vaccine. So there is no complete innate response
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:39.360]  and these cells are the ones critical for antibody production. Next slide, please.
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:47.200]  You've heard a lot of question about whether vaccines or natural immunity provide a better
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:53.200]  response. Well, this study or these studies actually showed two different studies in
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:49:00.000]  Biomedicine and Scientific Reports shows what happens when you get natural immunity
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:09.760]  to SARS-CoV-2. In fact, it shows not only the IgG antibody to the far left, but in C you'll see the
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:15.920]  IgA antibody and that's critical and you don't hear anybody talking about that. But IgA antibody
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:21.840]  is the antibody that needs to be made if your lungs are infected or you GI tract and this is
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:27.520]  a virus that infects our lungs and GI tract. So you should ask the question, where's all the IgA
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:32.560]  data on the drug vaccines? Well, it's not there, but you can see person-to-person transfer natural
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:38.720]  immunity. There is an IgA response and in fact, you can also see here, you can go ahead and
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:44.400]  I think there's more wording up here, but the T cell response that we're concerned about that
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:51.440]  isn't happening with these drug vaccines, if you've had influenza or you've had cytomegalovirus,
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:59.360]  you may already have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 as this latter part showed with these individuals
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:05.120]  that had previously been exposed to influenza cytomegalovirus already had an immune response
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:14.000]  mounted to SARS-CoV-2. Next slide, please. My fifth point of concern is that the EUAs show
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.280]  no statistical reduction in COVID cases. Let's go to the next slide.
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:24.480]  I'm going to walk you through this. Hit next, please. There we go.
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:36.320]  The way vaccine efficacy is determined, all this 95 and 85 and 67 percent numbers that you hear
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:42.160]  is done as follows. It's a ratio of the number of people that get diagnosed with COVID who get the
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:49.920]  vaccine. Go ahead and click next. Eight over divided by the number of people and I see that
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:57.120]  we have a Greek script, but this is the number of people now hit the next component. This is the
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:01.680]  difference between Keynote and PowerPoint translation. So the number of people who end up
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:08.640]  with COVID who didn't get vaccinated. Next. And in the example of Pfizer, they talked about eight
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:13.760]  in the vaccinated group coming down with the diagnosis of COVID versus 162 in the
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:22.160]  non-vaccinated group. Next. Back one, please. My apologies. Which gave a ratio of 0.05
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:27.600]  risk ratio. One minus the risk ratio tells you that vaccine efficacy. So what they did is they
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:34.800]  asked how many people were diagnosed. Next slide, please. But that's not really the question you
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:41.680]  need to be asking. You need to be asking is there a difference between people that are vaccinated
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:49.200]  and unvaccinated and what that difference really is. And so you can look at the relative risk
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:54.480]  reduction. You can look at the more critical absolute risk reduction, the difference between
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:59.200]  groups. And you can look at the numbers of people you need to vaccinate to see the difference of
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:10.960]  just one. Next slide, please. And hit next, next, next. There we go. Now, how was the diagnosis of
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:16.960]  COVID made in these vaccine studies? Well, pretty much the same way as it's done in normal life.
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:23.600]  It's a positive PCR test, whether you get vaccinated or not. And do you have symptoms? Well,
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:29.840]  if you look at the list of symptoms under Pfizer or Moderna or Janssen, Johnson & Johnson, you'll
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:36.080]  see that these symptoms match just about any infection, whether it's SARS-CoV-2 or influenza
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:42.240]  or cytomegalovirus or respiratory syncytial virus or the common cold or cancer or bacterial
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:47.440]  infection. These are all the same symptoms. So this is not a very good way to determine whether
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:53.360]  it really worked. But level the playing field. This was the rules they had. So let's see what
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:59.040]  the data really shows. Next slide, please. Here's a look at the Pfizer vaccine. Next.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:07.520]  Confirmed COVID-19 cases in the emergency use authorization document published by Pfizer. Next.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:13.360]  They found eight people that got vaccinated. That's why we went through this before. Click
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:19.200]  next, which gives you eight in the numerator. Next, please. In the placebo group, the folks
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:24.080]  who didn't get any vaccine, there were 162. Now you're going to look at that first and say, wow,
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:32.880]  eight versus 162. Next. There's the 162. Click next, please. 0.05. Next. Gives you 95 percent
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:41.440]  efficacy. Next. Next slide. Well, here's what the data really shows when you dig into it.
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:48.560]  You can either ask how many got it or you can ask how many people did not get COVID. You can look
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:53.760]  for the absolute risk reduction. And that's what we're going to do here. That same eight shows up
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:54:06.160]  here. And if you take eight from the 17,411 people that were actually getting the vaccine,
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:13.520]  that means 17,403 of the Pfizer group did not get COVID. And that's 0.05 percent.
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:22.080]  The non-vaccinated group, turns out that there were 17,511 people in the non-vaccine group,
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:31.600]  of which 17,349 did not get diagnosed with COVID. That's a ratio of 0.93 percent. And if you do the
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:37.920]  math, if you look at this statistically, like a scientist like I look at it, and you say, are
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:44.400]  these different numbers really meaningful? Or do they just kind of give the impression of it?
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:49.440]  We statistically analyze it. And when you do that, you will see in the bottom right in white,
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:57.200]  not significant at PLS and 0.05. That means the result of this study shows no statistical
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:04.320]  reduction in the number of COVID cases between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. No difference.
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:13.520]  And the absolute risk reduction was 0.88 percent, not 95 percent. The difference between the groups
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:20.560]  was 0.88 percent. Next slide, please. And if you look at the number of deaths in the Pfizer group,
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:25.040]  there wasn't any difference between those who were vaccinated and not. In fact,
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:30.960]  it very specifically states all deaths represent events that occur in the general population of the
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:37.920]  age groups where they occurred at a similar rate. So, no difference statistically in reductions
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:43.760]  of COVID cases, and no difference in the number of deaths for Pfizer. Next slide, please.
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:48.160]  Now that we've done that, we can move a little faster with the same approach.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:55.760]  We see for the Moderna group, if you look at the bottom, there were 13,934 people who were in the
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:04.960]  Moderna vaccine group. 13,923 did not get COVID. That meant 11 did. I give you a value of 0.08
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:12.640]  percent. In the non-vaccinated group, there were 13,883 people. 13,698 did not get COVID.
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:18.800]  If you look at those two groups and you ask, are they different, it turns out that they are
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:26.800]  not statistically different. And if you look at the absolute risk reduction, it's 1.25 percent.
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:32.640]  Next slide, please. If you look at the Moderna group and you say, was there a difference in
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:38.240]  deaths, there's no statistically significant difference in the numbers of deaths between
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:42.240]  the two groups, and they represent what you normally expect to see in the population.
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:48.320]  No statistical reduction in COVID, no statistical reduction in deaths. Next slide, please.
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:54.160]  This is Janssen. Janssen got a little bit more sophisticated with what they did.
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:57:02.320]  They reported both at 14 days and 28. So, this slide looks at the 14-day data. And remember
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:08.640]  that Janssen is a single injection. So, they looked 14 days after that single injection.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:16.640]  Janssen had 21,636 in that group. 21,460 did not end up with COVID. The non-vaccinated group had
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:27.280]  21,574. 21,061 did not end up with COVID. And when you looked at that, the P value was
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:32.800]  significant. There was a statistically significant difference in the people who
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:39.200]  did not come down with COVID if they got the Janssen vaccine at 14 days. Next slide, please.
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:51.040]  However, when you go out two more weeks, 28 days, and you do the same numbers for those groups,
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:56.880]  that difference disappeared. So, it was good if you were looking for a difference at
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:04.720]  14 days, two weeks, but you go out to four weeks, and that difference is completely gone. Next
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:13.840]  slide, please. And because of all the items that Janssen did, they were taking data that wasn't
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:20.480]  confirmed by their central core lab. And if we compare the non-centrally confirmed results to
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:30.320]  the centrally confirmed, next, with eliminating the mild cases, next, next, what happens is you
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:38.880]  see these numbers in the top row of 176 and 513 start to drop to 117 and 351 cases. You see the
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:45.680]  number of people diagnosed with COVID dramatically drop when the central core had to confirm whether
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:54.160]  everybody was right or not. And next, there was a 32 to 42 percent drop in the number of COVID cases
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:59.040]  just by virtue of making sure that the central lab agreed. Next slide, please.
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:07.200]  This is the deaths associated with COVID, with the Janssen vaccine. There was no statistical
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:13.440]  reduction in the differences, and the vast majority of people that were reportedly dead
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:18.720]  that they diagnosed with, they didn't even know if it was COVID. Seven out of the 20
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:26.080]  in the non-vaccine group, they didn't know what the cause was. It wasn't defined as COVID. Next
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:32.400]  slide, please. But what we do know is that Janssen admitted at least right up front all
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:39.440]  the neurologic damage that was caused by the vaccine. And you can see laid out here, blood
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:46.560]  clots ringing in the ears, convulsions, all the stuff you're seeing on social media is exactly
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:52.320]  what was reported in the EUA documents. And yet, despite showing that at 28 days there was no
[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:58.400]  benefit to this vaccine compared to not being vaccinated, no reduction in COVID cases, no
[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:05.440]  reduction in deaths, but the problems with blood clotting and convulsions and neurologic damage,
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:08.960]  the EUAs still pass the FDA. Next slide, please.
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:18.880]  Amazingly enough, in all three EUA documents, it was very clear. There is no data to show
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:26.560]  that anybody who has responded to the virus and recovered with natural immunity has any benefit
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:33.840]  by being vaccinated by any of the three vaccines that the FDA has given EUA approval for. Next
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:40.640]  slide, please. In fact, if you take the absolute risk reduction and you look at the Pfizer,
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:45.440]  the Moderna, the Gamaliya, that's the Russian one, the Janssen, the AstraZeneca, you'll see
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:53.200]  that the numbers aren't 95 percent or 90 percent or 67 percent. The absolute risk reduction goes
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:01:00.560]  from 0.84 to 1.3 percent. The real elephant in the room is what's the difference between the groups,
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:06.960]  and it turns out statistically, nothing. Next slide, please. So why did I put you through
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:11.280]  all those slides? Go ahead and just run that through. So you could do the scientific review
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:17.920]  that the FDA didn't. Next. Based upon the EUA documents, next, there's no statistical
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:24.480]  reduction in COVID rates, no statistical reduction in COVID death rates. There is an unacceptable
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:32.800]  various death and adverse event rate that we're constantly seeing updated. Next. Next, please.
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:42.320]  The absolute risk reduction was actually 0.8 to 1.3 percent, not these higher numbers. Why did we
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:47.600]  go through the slides? Next, to provide you with answers you need. So when somebody says there's
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:53.680]  a benefit of getting the vaccines, you've seen the actual data submitted to the FDA by these
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.240]  drug companies for these emergency use authorization documents showing there's no
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:04.560]  statistical reduction in COVID cases or deaths, but there are substantial adverse effects. Next.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:12.080]  Because the FDA basically failed to do its job. They failed to provide the scientific,
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:19.040]  ask these questions that scientists should ask. Next. Now here's the VAERS adverse death data.
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:26.800]  That's back in November of 2021 in April. You can see these numbers increase. It doesn't matter
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:30.880]  whether we're looking at adverse events, deaths, or serious injuries. Next, please.
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:38.880]  The numbers jump. If we just look at deaths, they go from 2,600 to 3,500 by the 7th of May,
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:46.080]  4,000 next to the 23rd of August, next 13,000, the 3rd of September, 14,000. That's just in the
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:51.440]  United States. And that's not counting the adverse effects on the heart. The 5,000 to 6,000 have been
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:57.280]  documented or any other harm. You know, if these drug vaccines were actually demonstrating a
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:03.040]  statistical reduction in COVID or deaths, you could start to make an argument for why you might
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:10.480]  have to tolerate the side effects. The problem is the documents don't support that. The documents
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:17.440]  don't show a statistical reduction in COVID or deaths, but we are seeing massive numbers of
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:26.560]  disease. And look at the deaths. It doesn't matter whether it's 14,000 or 45,000. We stopped
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:33.280]  the swine flu vaccine in the mid-1970s because of 25 deaths. Next slide, please.
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:40.560]  This is what we can see from the European data bank. Next slide. Several of them here until you
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:45.440]  see all those pop up. Next. There we go. At least one dose of COVID. And you can see next
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:53.680]  the number of reported adverse events in Europe back in May was almost half a million. Next.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:04:00.240]  With more than 600,000 serious injuries. Next. Almost 1,200 multiple symptoms and deaths in
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:08.160]  Europe by May was 12,000 added to what we have. Next slide, please. And finally, the sixth thing.
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:14.160]  The mass vaccination program has produced what's called
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:20.720]  pressure selection of these viruses. So let's take a look at this. Next slide, please.
[02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:27.360]  They've talked about the Delta variant as if it's something unique. I want you to look around each
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:31.520]  and every one of you, look at the people next to you and realize that every one of you are a
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:36.800]  different variant of human. But you're all there and these viruses have the same thing. They have
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:43.840]  variants. There's more than one type of them. And as I said at the very beginning, in 2007 and
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:48.640]  always before with vaccines, we've taken every variant with all of its parts, weakened it and
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:55.120]  made antibodies for immune responses so that you would see everything. But in this case, we only
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:05:01.600]  concluded the genetic material for Wuhan HU1. So you can see on the far left there's been the
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:06.960]  Alpha, the Beta, the Gamma, the Delta. There's Kappa. You're hearing about Mu right now. These
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:11.120]  are all the variants. They each have little variations. And the farther these variations
[02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:17.760]  get from the original Wuhan HU1, the less recognized it's going to be by these vaccines.
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:22.480]  In fact, Pfizer was so concerned that about two to three weeks ago, they announced that
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:29.040]  when these breakthroughs occur so that the vaccines no longer work, within 91 days,
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:33.680]  they can gear up a new vaccine, which they will then need to inject into you
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:38.240]  to bring under control the next scare of the next variant that they produce. Next slide, please.
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:45.680]  This is Alpha 1. This was actually what broke through in England originally that caused all
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:51.760]  this stress. And you can see all these colored areas or the variances in the spike protein of
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:58.320]  the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the HU1 variant. Next slide, please.
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:04.640]  Back that up one, please. If you look at the very bottom, I want you to look at this site.
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:09.520]  You can go to this site and you can get all of this information if you really want to.
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:15.920]  That should be the topic of what everybody's talking about when they're having press releases
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:22.960]  from the federal government or HHS or NIAID or whomever, because these investigators,
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:30.720]  doctors Emma Hodcroft and Luke Montagnier and Jean-Claude Perez have been working diligently
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:34.880]  on getting the information about what's really in these viruses. Next slide, please.
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:42.640]  We're going to look at, real quick, 33 countries. And we're going to look at the different vaccines
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:47.040]  when they occurred. And what you will see is that all this is color-coded. And the consistent theme
[02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:54.640]  here is that every time a new drug vaccine was added, be it Pfizer in P, AstraZeneca in AZ,
[02:06:54.640 --> 02:07:01.600]  the Moderna, or the Janssen in J, drop the line down to where it got started. And you will see
[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:08.720]  in the UK, the US, Germany, Sweden, and the like, you will see an increase in number of
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:18.560]  COVID cases and SARS infections and a pressure selection pushing away from the HU1 to the
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:23.520]  variants that are less like what's in the vaccine, in this case, the Delta variant. So, you can see
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:28.640]  the Delta variant being shown in the green here, popping up at the end of this. This was in June of
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:35.360]  2021. Next slide, please. Here's what happens in these countries and in Spain and Belgium. You can
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:39.920]  see what happened in India. You stop treating people with drugs at work and you start giving
[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:44.960]  them vaccines that put pressure selection on the virus. And this is the disaster you end up with.
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:49.760]  You can see what happened in Mexico. And they have used all eight of them, including Covaxin,
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:57.440]  Cansino, Camilla, and the Sinovac ones. Next slide, please. Same concept here. There's a
[02:07:57.440 --> 02:08:02.480]  lot of countries without data, but Croatia, Australia show the same phenomenon. Next slide,
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:08.640]  please. And this brings us to a few other countries along with Israel. As most people know,
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:17.680]  Israel went full throttle, committed to the Pfizer vaccine and vaccinated the vast majority of its
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:25.520]  population. By June of 2021, Israel was saying they had successfully defeated the virus. But
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:32.000]  because it puts this pressure selection, it selects out for anything further away from the
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:40.400]  HU1. A month later, Delta is roaring its ugly head in Israel, despite most everybody being vaccinated.
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:47.120]  And you can see that with the green pop up here in Israel showing the Delta variant. Next slide,
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:53.840]  please. Now, I'm going to walk you through here step by step because this is, these are all the
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:59.280]  variants on the bottom. And if you look down here to the Delta, I want you to watch how this wave
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:07.360]  appears. Next, please. This is Pfizer. Next. That's when it was started. Moderna. Next. Next
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:14.560]  ones. You can see as these drug vaccines got added, what happened was an increase in cases
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:20.320]  and a shift from one variant to another, as we have seen finally with the last one, the Delta
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:26.960]  variant being pushed across. This tells you the sequence of changes and pressure selection for
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:33.760]  this Delta variant and now to occur as the direct result of these drug vaccines. Next slide, please.
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:40.640]  This shows you Delta. It shows you a two-fold increase in its ability to get away from
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:44.480]  responding to the vaccines. This is the Delta variant. Next slide, please.
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:51.200]  Here's what the Israeli data really looks like. This is what happened back in May and June when
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:55.680]  they thought they had a handle on it. And by August, you can see that the variants are popping
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:03.120]  up. In fact, by the 15th of August, they had 514 Israelis hospitalized. And when people tell you
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:09.840]  this is a phenomenon of unvaccinated people, 59% of the people admitted with the Delta variant were
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:19.120]  vaccinated and 87% of those were in people over age 60. Vaccination and the age increase and we're
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:25.760]  calling for a booster shot in the United States. Next slide, please. Here's all the different
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:30.560]  variants that occur. This is what Mu looks like. So you can see all the color changes of the spike
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:36.160]  protein that's different. And all of this on the left is actually how we compare these different
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:42.240]  variants. This on the right shows the subtle changes that are occurring. And you can see
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:47.360]  exactly where they are. And you can see the overlap. So it's not like these viruses are
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:51.840]  completely different. But there's a lot of similarities just which one of these bases
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:57.040]  and variants are there. Next slide, please. Which brings us to what we're really doing.
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:02.480]  We're doing vaccine chasing. And the phenomenon is really that you're getting a lot of misinformation
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:06.480]  provided to you. And every time there's misinformation, it's like somebody's saying
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:10.080]  squirrel. And your attention is darted there. And this is what happens.
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:30.400]  Next slide, please.
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:37.440]  And that's all it takes. We're just about there. And this is a dog chasing its tail. And the irony
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:42.480]  of this dog chasing its tail that we'll just do the video of is that it's guarding its carrot.
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:49.760]  And it's so concentrated on the distraction. Watch what happens.
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:12:10.080]  This is vaccine chasing.
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:30.400]  And while it's chasing its tail,
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:38.720]  it can't figure out quite what happened. Vaccine chasing is the phenomenon of chasing
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:44.480]  based upon a single spike protein or a single part of this virus, producing pressure selection,
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:49.680]  producing these variants that everybody is now complaining is the result of the unvaccinated
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:54.880]  when in fact it's the direct result of the vaccination sequence. And with that,
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:13:00.160]  I'm going to call a brief break. And we will come back to you in just a moment to discuss
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:05.440]  crimes against humanity. People ask me, Alex, why did you come out with a new natural organic
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:10.880]  sleep aid when you already have knockout that works so well with eight natural ingredients?
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:15.920]  Well, because when you've taken a certain organic blend for a decade, like I've taken this product
[02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:21.040]  I came up with, it doesn't work as well anymore. That's the way herbs work. You go off at a while,
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:25.040]  come back on it, it works again. So what did I do? I went to the developers and I said,
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:29.440]  make a totally different formula with a lot of other known natural healthy compounds that
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:32.800]  make you sleep deep and restful, because that's what helps your immune system. And I want it to
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:38.960]  be at least twice as strong as knockout. Okay, be careful when you take it. It's incredibly strong.
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:42.160]  It's named down and out. I don't have time to get into all the ingredients in it,
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:46.880]  but it is extremely strong. We are extremely proud of it. It is exclusively available
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:53.680]  at info war store.com 50% off right now, sold out for more than four months. Now back in stock,
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:58.640]  get your down and out and your knockout at info war store.com today. I thank you for your support
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:05.120]  because it keeps us on the air. Welcome back. In the last segment, I talked to you briefly
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:09.680]  about my concerns about the vaccines. And I wanted to make certain that we touched on one
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:15.840]  further topic before we move on to addressing how to deal with these individuals responsible for
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:22.560]  this virus and these vaccines. Antibody dependent enhancement is a term that you have undoubtedly
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:28.160]  heard about. And if not, I want to take a moment to make you aware of it. In the past,
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:33.040]  antibody dependent enhancement has been that when you make antibodies to something,
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:39.440]  it causes further inflammation and blood clotting to occur in your body. The ability to make
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:44.400]  antibodies is not always a good thing. Cardiologists like myself have for years,
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:50.800]  when you've had strep throat, given you antibodies or given you antibiotics to prevent you from
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:56.720]  making antibodies. Well, why would we do that? And the truth is, is that the antibodies that
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:02.560]  are made to strep throat can also misinterpret the valves of your heart, your mitral valve and
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:08.480]  your aortic valve as being the bacteria. And when that happens, those antibodies then attack the
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:14.480]  valves of your heart producing rheumatic heart disease, which later in life can lead to heart
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:22.720]  problems and the need for valve replacement. The physicians in Osaka, Japan in 2020 demonstrated
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:28.240]  a new phenomenon for antibody dependent enhancement. The spike protein of this
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:33.600]  coronavirus has more than one part, as you've seen in previous discussions that we've had.
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:39.760]  And one part of it is called the N-terminal domain, which is where nitrogen sits in the
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:45.600]  chemical structure, hence N-terminal domain. When antibodies are made to that part of the
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:53.040]  spike protein, the Osaka, Japan physicians in 2020 showed that those antibodies then cause the spike
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:16:00.480]  protein to open up and make the spike protein four to 10 times as infectious. In addition to
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:05.920]  causing the inflammation and blood clotting, the very antibodies that were trying to kill the virus
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:13.920]  were increasing its infectivity. Early on, you may remember or in about the middle of 2020,
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:19.280]  people receiving convalescent plasma from people who had survived or patients in the hospital that
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:24.960]  weren't doing so well even though they had antibodies. The reason for those bad outcomes
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:31.680]  turns out to be antibodies made to the N-terminal domain. And since bringing the spike protein into
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:38.160]  your body causes you to make antibodies not only to that regional binding domain to try to prevent
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:45.040]  attachment of the spike protein but also the N-terminal domain, not only the virus but the
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:50.480]  vaccines have shown antibody dependent enhancement. In fact, in a recent report
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:59.520]  put out by the Joint Artificial Intelligence of the U.S. Department of Defense, who should know
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:04.640]  something about this since the DOD was involved in the funding of the research for this gain of
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:12.400]  function bioweapon, they're noting that individuals over 65 were getting less and less benefit to
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:19.760]  delta variant and other types of variants produced as a result of these drug vaccines putting pressure
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:27.200]  selection on the actual viruses that exist. This document I know Alex Jones has talked to you about
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:35.040]  and Mike Adams of Natural News published it. It's an info wars talking about this antibody dependent
[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:42.320]  enhancement phenomenon. This information is available for people but only if you get to the
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:48.080]  right sources. The question is why aren't you hearing about this from mainstream media? If
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:53.600]  somebody's spreading misinformation, the easiest way to shut them down is to let them keep talking.
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:18:00.160]  If somebody's spreading correct information, the best way to shut them down is to shut them down.
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:07.360]  In this next section, I'd like to talk to you about what we should be doing to address these
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:13.440]  individuals responsible for the development of this gain of function bioweapon SARS-CoV-2
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:21.600]  and the vaccines that include that same genetic code thus making them biological weapons
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:30.240]  themselves. Next slide please. Crimes against humanity is a term that many people banter around
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:37.040]  and they've used even for recently the disputes between who's allowing which drugs to be used and
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:45.520]  which ones aren't. But crimes against humanity are exactly that. Crimes against humanity causing
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:53.920]  systemic or systematic campaigns against people causing death or large-scale destruction. Next
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:19:03.440]  slide please. A biological weapon and the United States has signed and ratified the biological
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:10.560]  weapons convention treaty is the development of a biological organism that has no benefit
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:17.280]  for mankind and it under all circumstances has been excluded
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:24.080]  and not allowed by any country. To sign the biological weapons convention treaty
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:31.600]  and then to develop a virus with gain of function that causes this type of harm is not to make a
[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:39.920]  peaceful weapon or a good weapon. It violates this treaty which makes those responsible criminals.
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:49.520]  Next slide please. In 1975 the biological weapons convention treaty was signed and I want you to
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:57.680]  simply see this is what the document looked like. Next slide. And these are the countries that have
[02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:04.880]  signed on it and ratified it and in fact that includes the United States of America. So any
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:12.800]  involvement by U.S. citizens of the development of a gain-of-function bioweapon is a violation
[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:18.480]  of an international treaty and under the U.S. constitution the law of the United States that
[02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:26.080]  is supreme is the U.S. constitution treaty law and statutes or legislation passed by congress.
[02:20:26.800 --> 02:20:32.960]  If you're a member of the U.S. elected officials or appointed to an office and you've taken an oath
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:39.840]  to serve and protect the constitution of the United States and you've been involved in this
[02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:46.640]  you have violated your oath and by definition you have committed treason. Next slide please.
[02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:54.160]  To hold these people accountable requires that we go back and look at history. In the 1930s and
[02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:59.920]  1940s Nazi Germany and its leaders felt that they were above reproach. They could do whatever they
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:05.520]  wanted to do and no one would hold them accountable. In fact at the beginning of World War II nobody
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:13.680]  did but after World War II and in 1947 these individuals were brought to justice in criminal
[02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:20.800]  courts. Next slide please. For crime for 24 defendants in the first trial for crimes of
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:28.000]  conspiracy crimes against the peace war crimes and crimes against humanity and you can see
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:34.640]  down here at the bottom to the far left next to the military patrol that's Gering
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:39.920]  number one in command of Nazi Germany after Hitler's death. Next slide please.
[02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:50.560]  Gering made a very daring statement during his trial. He said that any country can get its people
[02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:55.920]  to do whatever they want as long as they determine that there's a problem
[02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:03.520]  that there's a solution to the problem and that anybody who stands against doing what
[02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:12.240]  the government tells you to do is guilty of conspiracy for being a terrorist to the country.
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:19.600]  Next slide please. This shows what happens when these individuals are brought to accountability.
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:28.480]  In 1947, 24 defendants, Hitler killed himself and Goebbels committed suicide before being held
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:32.800]  accountable but these are all the people that were held in the first trial. Next slide please.
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:41.360]  There were 12 death sentences, three life imprisonment and four sentenced to 10 to 20 years
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:47.680]  but there were additional trials that followed that and I want people to pay attention because
[02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:52.800]  in addition to holding the government leaders accountable, the following trials were the
[02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:59.360]  doctor's trial, the judge's trial and numerous other trials that held elected officials, judges
[02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:05.920]  and doctors accountable for their crimes against humanity. Next slide please. In fact most of you
[02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:11.840]  will remember this gentleman or you've heard about him, Dr. Joseph Mengele. He was an average German
[02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:18.000]  individual. This is him riding a bicycle and these are the people in the ghettos of
[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:26.240]  concentration camps. Dr. Mengele thought that everything he did was for the benefit of the
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:31.680]  German people so it didn't matter if you experimented on other people, what they were
[02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:37.920]  doing was right for the German people and the first people that were imprisoned by the way were
[02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:45.040]  the PhDs and the doctorates that could disseminate information, then the Jews and then other less
[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:52.800]  desirable individuals. Remove discussion, remove debate and you remove the problem. Again if
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:57.520]  somebody doesn't know what they're talking about the easiest way to let them embarrass
[02:23:57.520 --> 02:24:02.880]  himself or make them non-existent is to let them keep talking. They'll show just how foolish they
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:08.480]  are. The problem is that when you have people that are talking and they're telling you the truth,
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:15.040]  the only way you can deal with them is to silence them. Try to harass them, put them in
[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:23.760]  concentration camps, call them conspiracy theorists or something worse, traitors,
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:27.680]  any of a number of things. Next slide please.
[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:38.400]  The doctors trial had significance because there wasn't a set of code for doctors to follow
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:43.520]  prior to Nuremberg and the reason why the Nuremberg code is so critical was because
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:49.360]  in listening to the Nazi doctors they believed that they were innocent of any wrong, that they
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:53.440]  had the right to experiment, do whatever they wanted to on people. They were doing it for the
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:59.760]  betterment of Germany for after all and they said if you looked at the record that it wasn't
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:04.160]  anything really worse than what the Americans were doing or the British were doing or the
[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:09.520]  or other people were doing. The problem with that statement is that they were very correct
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:16.160]  in that statement. What we were doing in this country, we have atrocities longer than you
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:22.160]  could imagine and we've continued to do that. Tuskegee experiments, syphilis experiments,
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:27.520]  radiation experiments in our military and now we have this new experimental project that we're
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:34.560]  doing. So the 1947 Nuremberg code and this is what it looks like at the very front, established
[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:41.600]  criteria from other doctors who said it might be what has been done but it is wrong to experiment
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:48.480]  on people and you do not experiment on people without informed consent and a mandate for a
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:55.840]  vaccine without informed consent which means you have the right to refuse it is a violation of all
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:26:02.080]  the treaties that we have signed that require that patients have informed consent. Next slide please.
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:09.360]  Violation of the Nuremberg code, you can see several different components here.
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:14.640]  Again I put this here because you can watch it, you can stop it, you can read through it. I want
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:19.680]  you to see these are real documents not something that somebody has talked about. Alex Jones and
[02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:27.840]  other people constantly hold up real documents for you to see so that you know there's a validity
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:34.880]  in what's being talked about. It's not just an idea, the documents are truly there and you can
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:41.920]  genuinely see and go read it for yourself and go look for it. At your leisure take the time to go
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:50.400]  through it that you need to. Next slide please. The British Medical Journal and the adjustments
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:58.080]  here discuss the crimes against humanity most recently in 1996 and dating back to the 1949
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:06.240]  documents. Next slide please. It recognizes that experimentation on human beings must be done with
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:12.080]  informed consent and some experiments simply cannot be done. There is not a betterment to
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:18.400]  humanity. There is not a treatment of disease. It's a violation of the Hippocratic oath. It's
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:25.280]  a violation of treaty laws. Next slide please. More on the Nuremberg code. This goes through
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:30.720]  the voluntary consent of human subject was number one. You can see two through ten,
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:35.280]  all the other ten components of the Nuremberg code. Next slide please. Go ahead and play that
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:44.320]  please. Taking their places in the famous Nuremberg courtroom,
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:48.160]  judges of the allied military tribunal begin the trial of minor war criminals.
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:28:03.520]  In the dock once occupied by their leaders are 23 Nazi doctors, accused of many crimes
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:12.960]  in hospitals, concentration camps and research centers. Number one defendant is Karl Brandt,
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:16.400]  formerly Hitler's personal physician and a general in the Waffen-SS.
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:21.600]  Next in importance is Siegfried Hahn-Blesser, a former medical chief of the Wehrmacht.
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:32.160]  Hertha Oberhauser, the only woman defendant, was a physician in the notorious camp at Ravensbrück.
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:37.760]  All the accused pleaded not guilty but time and evidence alone will decide their future.
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:43.840]  Next slide please.
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:52.240]  16 of the doctors were eventually found guilty and seven of them were executed.
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:03.760]  It is not possible for physicians and those individuals that are involved with these
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:10.960]  experimental vaccines to remain completely unaccountable to Americans and to the world
[02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:15.120]  for the crimes that they've committed against humanity. Next slide please.
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:24.160]  It's also a violation of the American medical code, American Medical Association code of ethics
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:30.880]  to do something to a patient without informed consent. So it's unconscionable at this point
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:36.880]  in time that the AMA or any agency in the United States would put pressure on its physicians to
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:44.080]  force them to make their patients get vaccinated. In fact, a recommendation from your doctor to get
[02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:49.760]  vaccinated is fine. I have no problem with it. That's between you and your doctor. The problem
[02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:53.840]  as I asked somebody a couple weeks ago in a conference is that as a cardiologist, I've
[02:29:53.840 --> 02:29:58.720]  frequently looked at people who are smoking and I've said you shouldn't do that. It's bad for your
[02:29:58.720 --> 02:30:05.200]  health. And nobody who wanted to continue to smoke seemed to have a problem saying, Dr. Fleming,
[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:11.840]  I'm going to continue smoking. Don't keep harassing me about that. So the question is why
[02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:18.880]  isn't that where the conversation ends with drug vaccines for this virus when doctors tell you
[02:30:18.880 --> 02:30:25.600]  for whatever reason you need to get a vaccine. This information you're getting allows you to
[02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:29.920]  make an informed intelligent decision and you should be able to then look at your doctor and say
[02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:36.560]  I have made an informed decision and it's not to get the vaccine if that's what you choose.
[02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:39.840]  That's between you and your doctor. Next slide please.
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:48.080]  To make an informed consent you actually have to know what the benefits and the risks of what
[02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:54.080]  you're doing to the patient is. Now I showed in the last segment the emergency use authorization
[02:30:54.080 --> 02:30:59.600]  documents showed no statistical reduction in COVID or deaths even though there were concerns
[02:30:59.600 --> 02:31:05.760]  about inflammation and blood clotting. This on the left if you look at this this is a picture of
[02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:12.640]  the three package inserts of the Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen package inserts laid side by side
[02:31:12.640 --> 02:31:18.880]  with a picture taken over the top. There is nothing on these package inserts. They are
[02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:25.680]  left intentionally blank as the documents say. So left intentionally blank there is no material
[02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:31.200]  for a doctor to obtain knowledge about what the consequences or the benefits of these drug
[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:37.040]  vaccines are. If you're a doctor actually telling your patients they should get these drug vaccines
[02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:41.520]  and you have not read the emergency use authorization documents which are available on
[02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:48.160]  FlemingMethod.com under the documents for this virus. If you've not read the emergency use
[02:31:48.160 --> 02:31:52.880]  authorization documents and you're telling patients that they need it or will benefit
[02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:59.280]  from it then you're doing it on hearsay what somebody else has told you not what you have
[02:31:59.280 --> 02:32:06.320]  done as a physician or scientist to carry through on your obligations to inform your patient to
[02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:14.960]  provide informed consent to provide your medical obligation to your patients. Remembering that
[02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:24.640]  three-letter agencies HHS, FDA, NIH, CDC aren't there with you when you're seeing your patients
[02:32:24.640 --> 02:32:34.080]  who've been admitted either for the infection or COVID or a vaccine complication and understand
[02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:42.480]  there is no CPT code no computer code to put into the computer by doctors that says patient had an
[02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:49.120]  adverse effect to one of these COVID vaccines. There is for measles mumps and rubella there is
[02:32:49.120 --> 02:32:54.880]  for diphtheria tetanus there is for all the other vaccines but there is no computer record of
[02:32:54.880 --> 02:33:01.680]  adverse events to a COVID vaccine. So when we go back in history from in in the future and we look
[02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:12.000]  back in history for the data it's not going to be there. Next slide please. This is the principles of
[02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:20.480]  Helsinki the declaration of Helsinki which was another declaration of how patients could should
[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:26.960]  be treated. It's critical for any research drugs to be used for people to understand informed
[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:33.760]  consent for patients. Next slide please. This is more of the declaration of Helsinki that you're
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:39.440]  welcome to stop and look at and you can see at the very end informed consent participation by
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:44.800]  individuals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical research must be voluntary.
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:50.800]  A mandate is not voluntary. Mr. President
[02:33:54.160 --> 02:34:03.760]  making it mandatory is a violation of informed consent. Violating informed consent violates
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:09.280]  these treaties that I just showed you and a violation of those treaties is a violation
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:14.080]  of the oath taken to uphold and defend the constitution of the United States.
[02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:25.200]  Next slide. More on the declaration of Helsinki. More on the and and this these are the
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:30.400]  Hippocratic oaths and for those of you who think do no harm is in our oaths it's not.
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:39.680]  It's not but there's also not something that says to harm. These oaths that are taken by
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:44.800]  physicians like myself either the Hippocratic oath or my physician's oath this was mine that I
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:56.480]  declared is to our patients not to the federal government not to elected officials not to judges
[02:34:57.280 --> 02:35:00.240]  not to big pharma not to insurance company.
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:08.320]  These are oaths we make to our colleagues who have trained us and to our patients. This is
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:15.040]  an oath that dates back thousands of years predating any laws or any society that currently
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:22.080]  exists. Next slide please. This is the international covenant on civil and political rights treaty.
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:28.160]  Again informed consent is a requirement the U.S. is a signatory and ratifier of this to
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:38.800]  make mandatory these vaccines violates this treaty and that's treason. Next slide please.
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:47.040]  More information on the covenant ICCPR. Next slide please. As is this. Next slide.
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:56.720]  After the prosecution of the criminals who ran the Nazi Germany itself and the doctors who
[02:35:56.720 --> 02:36:01.760]  carried out experimentation and the atrocities upon the people of Germany and other countries
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:07.520]  came the trials of the judges that made it possible for these atrocities to occur in Nazi
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:14.800]  Germany. Judges. The judges of Nazi Germany thought they were immune to prosecution and
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:23.120]  to being held accountable. They were wrong. The judges that make decisions today
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:32.160]  will be held accountable as will the doctors and leaders. They'll not only be held accountable by
[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:39.040]  the people and public opinion by your children and your grandchildren but by international law
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:46.320]  either through the international criminal court or another court that will be assembled should
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:55.680]  that be necessary. Next slide please. These are the judges that were tried in the Nuremberg cases.
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:06.880]  Next slide. Crimes of conspiracy. Crimes against peace. War crimes and crimes against humanity.
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:11.680]  Next slide please. These are the charges for the people that have developed this gain of function
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:16.560]  bio weapon that have blocked physicians from treating patients with medications that have
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:22.800]  been proven from the development of these biological vaccines and the forced coercive
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:28.240]  mandating of people being vaccinated. For people who have been vaccinated I completely understand
[02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:36.080]  this is not an easy topic area. And you were told that for the threat that you pose to the
[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:41.360]  loved ones in your life, your children, your grandparents, the lady down the block with cancer
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:46.480]  or the guy down the block with prostate cancer or the people that you didn't want to harm when you
[02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:51.920]  came into contact. You were told that this was necessary for you as a citizen to protect these
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:58.960]  people. So you stood up. You did what you were told. But this information as you've seen isn't
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:04.480]  validated by the emergency use authorization documents. It's not even validated by Dr. Fauci's
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:14.480]  own words when he was asked by the comedian in March of 2020 of 2021 whether these vaccines
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:19.600]  prevent you from getting infected. They do not and they do not prevent you from transmitting it.
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:27.520]  They are designed to minimize your symptoms when you get infected. That has always been the role of
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:34.480]  vaccines. It continues to be the role of these vaccines. These violations with interference of
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:39.040]  practice of medicine prohibiting doctors from treating you. Next slide please.
[02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:48.480]  These violate the 1947 Nuremberg Code, the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki, the 1976
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:53.280]  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Medical Code of Ethics
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:39:00.080]  and Medical Code of Ethics that are in other countries. Earlier this year four countries
[02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:07.760]  joined a filing or requested a joining of filing with the International Criminal Court to have
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:15.680]  their cases considered together. The United Kingdom, France, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:23.040]  I'm honored to say that I joined Drs. Kevin McCarron and Luke Montagnier to provide
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:28.000]  affidavits of evidence in support of calling for crimes against humanity.
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:41.280]  A couple weeks ago on the 20th of September, We for Humanity, a group of people that are former
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:50.160]  Nazi concentration camp survivors hand-walked this letter to the International Criminal Court
[02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:58.800]  asking for the International Criminal Court, the ICC, to take this joint case to begin investigation
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:09.280]  of these perpetrators. On FlemingMethod.com under the new or hot button you will see if you scroll
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:17.920]  down a document that I posted on the 29th of September asking for everybody to sign a petition
[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:26.880]  to submit to the International Criminal Court to follow up with a request for the ICC to join
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:32.720]  these cases, to begin the investigation and prosecution of these individuals, to take the
[02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:40.080]  affidavits that Montagnier, McCarron and myself provided and the letter from the Nazi concentration
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:47.440]  camp survivors. We are calling upon you. I am calling upon you to go and sign this document.
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:56.560]  It's electronic so we can submit that for further recognition for the court to take this seriously.
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:02.480]  This is not a problem that's going to go away. There's not some cavalry somewhere else. You are
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:10.080]  the cavalry. Your signature will add to the voices calling out for justice in International Criminal
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:15.440]  Court to hold these people accountable and anybody who wonders whether U.S. citizens can be held
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:23.840]  accountable for this or not hasn't reflected on Nazi Germany. The Nazi German political government
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:28.800]  doctors and judges all thought they were immune all because they thought that they had not agreed
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:36.080]  to participate in this. History proved them wrong and history will prove these criminals wrong as
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:47.520]  well. Next slide please. An example of a judge that may be under consideration. This judge required
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:55.600]  that individuals who were being considered for sentences had to be vaccinated. This is a forced
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:42:03.440]  vaccination of these individuals. This is something that will be considered in these
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:10.640]  criminal trials. Next slide please. Loss of personal liberties, income, the world has been
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:16.800]  massively effective. We are still in something of a lockdown. We are still in something of people
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:23.120]  being afraid. We are still being called criminals for having the interest of the country and for
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:28.000]  people having a right to their individual liberties and to be able to make their own
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:33.200]  medical decisions. Cruzan was a case out of Missouri with the Department of Health where
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:40.320]  the Supreme Court of the United States stated that an American citizen may not be forced to take
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:48.880]  a treatment. That is the Supreme Court of the United States. A forced vaccine violates what
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:57.440]  the Supreme Court has said. Next slide please. These crimes and this goes through a list of all
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:03.040]  these different components. Next slide please for you to see. This is the joint case. This is the
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:09.440]  numbers for you to see. For the UK, Slovakia, French and Czech Republic with other countries
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:15.440]  telling us that they are interested in participating in this court. Next slide please.
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:22.720]  And this is my particular document provided and you can see who I have asked to be individually
[02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:29.520]  investigated and prosecuted in the documents that I submitted to the ICC and this is not an
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:37.920]  all-inclusive list by any means. Next slide please. This is the letter. You can see Nazi
[02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:43.600]  concentration camp survivors. Next slide. I want you to understand the severity of what we are
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:51.520]  dealing with. These three brave individuals survived being in a Nazi concentration camp.
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:59.440]  They have colleagues who wanted to sign this document but were afraid of retaliation
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:08.880]  should they sign it including one who is a personal friend of Anne Frank. To say that
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:15.360]  there is not something amiss on this planet when survivors of Nazi concentration camps are afraid
[02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:26.960]  to come forward speaks volumes about what's really going on with this virus. Next slide please.
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:34.000]  And we may not have ratified it but that doesn't mean people in the United States cannot be held
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:41.600]  accountable by the ICC and that something can't be done to punish them for their crimes. Next slide
[02:44:41.600 --> 02:44:51.600]  please. Together we're going to prove that Herman Wilhelm Gearing was wrong but we're going to prove
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:58.160]  to our children that we didn't care about what type of future we left for them and their children.
[02:44:58.160 --> 02:45:05.280]  Next slide please. As that last slide showed go back for me please if you ever wondered what you
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:12.320]  would have done in 1930s Germany I want you to merely now look at what you are deciding that
[02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:20.400]  you're willing to do and what others have done and you will then know what you would have done
[02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:28.800]  in 1930s and 1940s Germany. Next slide please. It does not take a majority to prevail.
[02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:39.120]  We don't need everybody but rather a tireless irate minority keen to set brush fires in people's
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:45.680]  minds. This is how a civilized society intelligently educated with facts discuss things.
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:52.400]  In an open and free society you discuss things. Freedom of speech is a discussion. Medicine and
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:59.920]  science has always exchanged ideas. It has never been one-sided. The exchange of ideas and
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:05.120]  information is critical to understanding a problem and knowing who's causing a problem
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:07.360]  and to solving a problem. Next slide please.
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:17.840]  Next slide please. These are all books that are available should you want them.
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:24.160]  Is COVID-19 a bio weapon, a scientific and forensic investigation, not only details
[02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:30.640]  who paid for this with these viruses as gain of function and what they did, the published papers,
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:37.920]  the research and includes Dr. Yan, a personal expert who was in Hong Kong who's been involved
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:42.720]  with these Chinese scientists who've been involved with the research from the United States.
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:49.840]  This is critical information for you to have and is COVID-19 a bio weapon was actually submitted
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:54.800]  as evidence with the affidavits to hold these criminals accountable. Next slide please.
[02:46:54.800 --> 02:47:01.280]  Next slide please. That's the book. It's available for you. It lays out the detail.
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:09.040]  You can see it has the endorsement of Jean-Claude Perez of attorneys, Melinda May. It has a couple
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:21.360]  other, Cara who's from the UK and a number of other individuals have endorsed the book
[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:25.440]  for the information to provide you knowledge base. You can take it, you can look at it,
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:31.280]  you can see the data for yourself. If this is not the truth, then you will have to explain to
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:37.840]  me why these federal documents exist, why these papers have been published, why these patents
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:43.440]  have been provided and why the paper trail is so clear and concise about who's been involved.
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:52.400]  Senator Dr. Rand Paul asked Dr. Anthony Fauci a very clear set of questions. Has the NIH and
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:48:01.280]  NIAID been involved in gain of function research and the movement lateral, lateral, lateral is
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:07.440]  very clear. He knew about it. He was involved in the funding of it. He's not the only one.
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:16.160]  Collins was involved with NIH and the people that sit there and question an elected position
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:21.280]  in Congress who knows what he's talking about, bringing the evidence forward and then telling
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:27.680]  him he doesn't know what he's talking about is either committing perjury or has something else
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:35.520]  going on that needs to be addressed. Next slide, please. These are ways to get a hold of me or at
[02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:42.320]  least information that you can see. Next slide, please. I want to thank Alex Jones for inviting
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:49.280]  me to present this material. I know a lot of it is material that at first glance seems overwhelming,
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:55.600]  but the truth of the matter is everybody out there watching this has the intelligence and
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:49:02.880]  the ability to use common sense and to read this information and answer the questions for themselves
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:09.520]  in an intelligent enlightened free society. That's what we do. I make this information
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:14.560]  available for you so that you can read it at your own pace so you can make decisions
[02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:22.320]  so you can call for these people to be held accountable so you can join the cause of being
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:27.840]  an American. I talk with people all over the world in other countries, physicians and scientists who
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:33.360]  are worried and their one recurring question they have to me is what are the people in the
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:40.240]  United States going to do about it? The answer comes from you, not from me or Alex Jones.
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:49.760]  It comes from what you do now, the decisions you make. You are the cavalry. You are responsible
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:54.400]  and you are part of history. Your children and your grandchildren will judge you
[02:49:54.720 --> 02:50:00.640]  for the world that you leave them. Today is an opportunity to make a difference in the world.
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:06.880]  It's been my pleasure to provide this information. I want to thank Alex Jones for inviting me here.
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:12.640]  Thank you and good day. It's October 1st 2021 and I've got good news for you.
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:17.360]  I've got good news for me. I've got good news for everybody alive in America
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:23.600]  and on this planet today. Now we spent years developing this and it's probably
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:28.400]  one of the strongest, cleanest formulas in the world. There may be something better.
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:32.560]  We don't know about it. It's made by one of the top labs in the United States that we
[02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:36.720]  probably label it from because again if we said their name they'd get attacked by the left.
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:47.040]  This stuff is incredible. It is Brain Force Ultra, exclusively available at mfoolwarstore.com.
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:54.480]  We got a limited run of this in a month ago and it sold out in three days and we already had a
[02:50:54.480 --> 02:51:00.720]  larger batch getting developed. The ingredients came in and the new batch is here and I just took
[02:51:00.720 --> 02:51:05.680]  some today and I think it's even stronger than the last batch because this stuff again is done
[02:51:05.680 --> 02:51:10.560]  in a lab but it's done organically so each batch varies a little bit but it does get all the
[02:51:10.560 --> 02:51:15.280]  testing done to show that it's at least up to a basic strength and this is actually above that.
[02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:21.280]  So we got Brain Force Ultra back in stock. We got a big shipment in but it's so popular I think it's
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:26.800]  going to sell out in probably a week. Despite that we're going to offer it at 50% off the
[02:51:26.800 --> 02:51:33.360]  introductory rate for at least four or five days. That's why I'm saying it's October 1st. I'm going
[02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:38.400]  to run this until October 5th. Hell it may sell out and that's good news for mfoolwars because
[02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:43.760]  we desperately need funding in the face of the Democratic Party. Assault, their rig courts,
[02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:48.320]  their kangaroo systems and their attempts to silence us and silence you because that's why
[02:51:48.320 --> 02:51:52.960]  they're coming after us is to get to you. We are all in this together as Benjamin Franklin said
[02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:56.400]  and if we don't hang together we're going to hang separate. You've been hanging with us,
[02:51:56.400 --> 02:52:00.320]  you've been keeping us on air, you've been spreading the word and it's having an incredible
[02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:03.360]  effect. In fact let me spend a minute or so on that before I get back into this.
[02:52:03.920 --> 02:52:09.200]  I had a chance to go up to Glenn Beck's The Blaze. I had a chance to hang out with Steven Crowder at
[02:52:09.200 --> 02:52:14.800]  his offices outside The Blaze and I had a chance to meet with a lot of other big reporters and
[02:52:14.800 --> 02:52:19.040]  other pundits and a lot of them thought I was full of it 10 years ago or even five years ago.
[02:52:19.040 --> 02:52:23.840]  They now see everything I predicted come true and we had a hero's welcome there and it's happening
[02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:28.800]  all over the place but that's because of your support. If you didn't keep us on air the world
[02:52:28.800 --> 02:52:34.240]  wouldn't be waking up. When this tyranny launched this attack we would be losing, we'd be submitting
[02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:39.040]  but instead all over the world from Australia to the United States people are fighting back
[02:52:39.040 --> 02:52:44.560]  and waking up and info wars. At least half the time that we talk to people is the catalyst that
[02:52:44.560 --> 02:52:48.960]  woke them up. That means you're the catalyst that woke them up. So again Brainforce Ultra
[02:52:48.960 --> 02:52:52.720]  is back in stock. You've got to go see what is in this. Let me just read you some of the things.
[02:52:53.280 --> 02:53:00.560]  Guarana seed, look into what that does. Alpha GPC, green coffee bean, alethra root,
[02:53:00.560 --> 02:53:08.480]  yerba mate leaf, green tea leaves, ginkgo leaf, ashwagandha root and more and they are strong
[02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:16.080]  organic cold press. This isn't dry garbage. This isn't old trash. This is new at one of the best
[02:53:16.080 --> 02:53:19.920]  labs. I want to say the best because there might be one better but it's the best we know of and
[02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:25.680]  we are so proud to bring you this and that it funds the info war. Clean, long, sustained, deep
[02:53:25.680 --> 02:53:31.920]  focused energy where you don't have the crash. If you love turbo force, if you love Brainforce
[02:53:31.920 --> 02:53:36.880]  Plus that are both different formulas that are excellent, you're going to absolutely love Brain
[02:53:37.600 --> 02:53:43.280]  Force Ultra. All three are different formulas. All three do different things but I got to tell
[02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:48.880]  you of the three drop for drop this is the strongest ever. 50% off infowarsetour.com and
[02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:53.120]  while you're there check out all the other great products like Ultra 12, Wintersite and so many

[02:54:03.440 --> 02:54:08.000]  is one step closer to our victory. So thanks for keeping us in the fight. We're never going to back
[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:13.040]  down. God bless and good luck. Well that was an incredible report and I really appreciate him
[02:54:13.040 --> 02:54:17.920]  coming to Austin with his crew to do this and I really appreciate our crew coming in on Saturday
[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:22.800]  to get this out. This is so life-saving. This is so important. So we've got the whole last
[02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:28.160]  three hours plus posted at band.video and freeworldnews.tv because they blocked the URL

[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:39.680]  get this report out. We also are going to post on the site the interview itself and the breakdown
[02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:45.040]  of everything he put out. So his whole PowerPoint, what he says, what he broke down, that is all
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:51.120]  going to be posted to band.video and freeworldnews.tv as well and that it's up to you
[02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:55.360]  to save lives and to stop the Globals to fight back what you've been doing and that's why they're
