[01:23.280 --> 01:29.400]  United States already occupying the Fed a lot of people spontaneously I guess
[01:29.400 --> 01:33.240]  synchronicity serendipity whatever you want to call it said yeah we should be
[01:33.240 --> 01:37.480]  going after the Fed not just general Wall Street or capitalism's bad and

[02:05.400 --> 02:10.240]  they were spurred by you know basically the idea that I had Sunday saying why
[02:10.240 --> 02:15.520]  don't we just go occupy the Fed instead of this this this general attack on the
[02:15.520 --> 02:19.040]  entire system and I've since learned other groups weeks ago were
[02:19.040 --> 02:24.160]  spontaneously doing this but not getting media attention in New York in
[02:24.160 --> 02:29.400]  Boston in other areas and now there are demonstrations at all Fed locations

[03:03.040 --> 03:08.320]  the New World Order the head of the Dallas Fed has come out and said that he
[03:08.320 --> 03:14.760]  has solidarity with occupy Wall Street Ben Bernanke has come out and said he
[03:14.760 --> 03:19.480]  understands why they're upset and has solidarity Obama has fully endorsed
[03:19.480 --> 03:25.240]  occupy Wall Street but only in an attempt to now try to jump over in public
[03:25.240 --> 03:31.200]  opinion to that side to protect themselves this is a capitulation to the
[03:31.200 --> 03:35.080]  fact that the public is woken up to them and an attempt to grab victory from the
[03:35.080 --> 03:40.720]  jaws of defeat here you've got Obama Bernanke the head of the Dallas Fed you've
[03:40.720 --> 03:44.800]  got George Soros coming out and saying he loves occupy Wall Street they love
[03:44.800 --> 03:49.520]  their attempt to co-opt it and act like they have solidarity when they are
[03:49.520 --> 03:54.000]  representatives of the most corrupt crony capitalist monopolistic
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.520]  capitalism anti-free market elements of Wall Street they are represented by that
[04:00.520 --> 04:06.160]  they captain that they are the generals of this wicked system and now as they
[04:06.160 --> 04:10.640]  set up world government as they fully implode the ones to great West and try
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.240]  to impoverish us just as they've done in their own official policies and State
[04:14.240 --> 04:19.200]  Department Miranda 200 and the British Population Commission of 49 their
[04:19.200 --> 04:23.400]  policy is to make you poor so that you're under their control they use
[04:23.400 --> 04:29.560]  economic bondage as a control mechanism and the fact that they have now come out
[04:29.560 --> 04:34.800]  and said oh we endorse occupy Wall Street that is a cold-blooded attempt to
[04:34.800 --> 04:39.280]  a act like they're with the people with camouflage but be trying to co-opt it as

[09:04.160 --> 09:09.600]  Federal Reserve today this has been a huge success not just our idea but the
[09:09.600 --> 09:14.800]  spontaneous idea that many others had to go out and occupy the Federal Reserve
[09:14.800 --> 09:19.840]  all over the country looking at info wars calm and also drudge report calm
[09:19.840 --> 09:23.200]  I'm gonna go over some headlines here and then throw it to Aaron for a few

[09:27.080 --> 09:32.360]  has there in front of him when I checked in to this hotel last night I noticed
[09:32.360 --> 09:40.520]  that they had a Thursday's paper laying there this is USA today soon to be
[09:40.520 --> 09:48.800]  obsolete physical paper the vestigial mainstream media hanging on by its
[09:48.800 --> 09:55.160]  fingernails and I was reading about Steve Jobs death of course and thinking
[09:55.160 --> 09:58.800]  man I didn't even really talk about that yesterday well that was today
[09:58.800 --> 10:02.280]  yesterday I didn't talk about that today on the show I need to talk about it
[10:02.280 --> 10:07.880]  tomorrow but I flipped open the paper and just every article just jumped out at
[10:07.880 --> 10:11.920]  me look at this one of course we covered this on Monday but here it is in USA
[10:11.920 --> 10:19.320]  today Florida County no fluoride in water there's 700,000 people in the town
[10:19.320 --> 10:25.880]  the move will halt Florida a fluoride being injected into the water reaching
[10:25.880 --> 10:34.200]  about 700,000 residents and of course the feds are freaking out the American
[10:34.200 --> 10:39.560]  Dental Association is freaking out saying oh my gosh our teeth will be rotten
[10:39.560 --> 10:44.920]  that'd be like saying if you don't drink sunscreen your nose will get burned when
[10:44.920 --> 10:49.480]  you're out fishing or when you're out at the beach and of course the American
[10:49.480 --> 10:53.240]  Dental Association was forced what six years ago to say that people under the
[10:53.240 --> 10:57.360]  age of five shouldn't brush with fluoride toothpaste or drink fluoride
[10:57.360 --> 11:01.280]  water because it's causing dental fluorosis and actually weakening the
[11:01.280 --> 11:06.200]  teeth and that's not even getting into the brain damage the bone cancer all
[11:06.200 --> 11:09.640]  the rest of it but here they are with that hoax again saying it's for your
[11:09.640 --> 11:13.600]  kids teeth and you go to the store and it's baby bottled water everywhere
[11:13.600 --> 11:17.200]  four to five with fluoride when the American Dental Association and the
[11:17.200 --> 11:21.000]  American Medical Association American Medals Association about what two years
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.760]  ago the American Dental Association five six years ago I don't know 2006 so yeah
[11:25.760 --> 11:30.720]  five six years ago a couple years ago what 2009 the American Medical
[11:30.720 --> 11:34.120]  Association came out you can look this up we've had doctors on we've covered it
[11:34.120 --> 11:39.240]  they came out and said don't give your baby fluoridated water mixed with the
[11:39.240 --> 11:44.520]  powdered formula if that's what you're giving them but still the establishment
[11:44.520 --> 11:49.040]  counts on the ignorance of the public on one side they cover their butts kind of
[11:49.040 --> 11:52.520]  like putting a warning on a package of cigarettes or a warning on a cell phone
[11:52.520 --> 11:58.280]  they can give you brain cancer but then still push it at you yesterday my wife
[11:58.280 --> 12:01.400]  said you ought to cover this on air look at this women's magazine it says inject
[12:01.400 --> 12:06.560]  boys with Gardasil now and it said you know it's not just for girls and then
[12:06.560 --> 12:10.960]  you flip over the page the front's all happy colors and how it's going to keep
[12:10.960 --> 12:16.920]  you real safe you flip it over there's a giant page of fine print and just of all
[12:16.920 --> 12:21.680]  the horrible things the convulsions the death the the bleeding out of orifices
[12:21.680 --> 12:26.280]  how wonderful it's all going to be but there it is big victories every week I
[12:26.280 --> 12:30.520]  see small towns big cities sometimes multiple times a week that are taking
[12:30.520 --> 12:35.280]  this stuff out of the water fluoride County no fluoride in water opponents
[12:35.280 --> 12:42.200]  site government intrusion and potential risk so there it is right there for you
[12:42.200 --> 12:47.200]  in USA today you also notice there's another little little headline right
[12:47.200 --> 12:51.960]  there right beside the fluoride article radio listeners that are new listeners I
[12:51.960 --> 12:55.360]  get emails all the time and they say I listen to your show on this station in
[12:55.360 --> 13:00.760]  southern California or in Florida or in in Austin you keep talking about look
[13:00.760 --> 13:06.080]  here on the screen this is a radio show well we are on XM we are on a lot of
[13:06.080 --> 13:10.480]  M&FM stations we are on global shortwave but we're also simul casting
[13:10.480 --> 13:18.800]  everything in living video color via the multicast at prisonplanet.tv we
[13:18.800 --> 13:22.880]  also bring you info wars nightly news every night 7 p.m. central Aaron Dykes
[13:22.880 --> 13:28.480]  waiting in the wings riding shotgun with me today as my Ed McMahon the info war
[13:28.480 --> 13:33.000]  he'll be hosting the show tonight we'll have reports by then I'll probably just
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.560]  end up calling into my own show tonight to give you an on-the-ground report we
[13:36.560 --> 13:40.120]  can also upload videos pretty much in real time and have those for the nightly
[13:40.120 --> 13:43.640]  news this evening and our occupy the Fed event I'm gonna get to that in just a
[13:43.640 --> 13:47.880]  moment that's why we're in Dallas but right next to it it says acting ATF
[13:47.880 --> 13:52.640]  director will review practices and they go on to say that they're gonna look at
[13:52.640 --> 14:00.480]  the problems they had and the mistakes that they made to to stop this from
[14:00.480 --> 14:05.200]  happening in the future that'd be like if you the police pulled somebody over
[14:05.200 --> 14:09.840]  and they had two or three dead kids in the back trunk and then they go to the
[14:09.840 --> 14:16.920]  person's house and dig up 25 bodies and then the criminal says well I'm going to
[14:16.920 --> 14:23.320]  try to review the problem and the mistake and make sure it doesn't happen
[14:23.320 --> 14:27.720]  anymore or that be like a bank robber got caught in his hideout with two
[14:27.720 --> 14:31.760]  million dollars he'd stolen from four or five banks in a crime spree and just
[14:31.760 --> 14:38.800]  said it's a mistake it was an accident or it'd be like if you decided to go beat
[14:38.800 --> 14:42.080]  your neighbor's brains out with a baseball bat just because it'd be fun
[14:42.080 --> 14:45.480]  the cops pull up his brains are all over the ground you just say oh it was an
[14:45.480 --> 14:49.560]  accident they go oh well of course you you you say you'll try to do that in the
[14:49.560 --> 14:55.880]  future this is premeditated capital accessory to murder murder one ladies
[14:55.880 --> 15:01.160]  and gentlemen knowingly shipping guns into Mexico and I told you this six
[15:01.160 --> 15:06.360]  months ago I told you this a month ago we told you this years ago the basics of
[15:06.360 --> 15:12.040]  what was happening with it fast and furious and now it has come out that in
[15:12.040 --> 15:17.840]  just one event alone the ATF was ordered to ship 2,000 guns directly to
[15:17.840 --> 15:25.240]  Sinaloa the dominant drug cartel on the US Mexico border the one teamed up with
[15:25.240 --> 15:32.840]  the CIA the FBI the DEA the ATF the Coast Guard aid agencies this is this is
[15:32.840 --> 15:36.720]  in major newspapers this is in the Miami Herald this is in the Chicago Tribune
[15:36.720 --> 15:43.160]  but buried in them and they shipped them in one case 2,000 guns there were the
[15:43.160 --> 15:48.960]  cases where they had the gun shops they would come into gun shop owners and say
[15:48.960 --> 15:54.040]  want you to help your government we are going to have well there's gonna be
[15:54.040 --> 15:57.280]  criminals coming in and buying guns we want to trace those let us set up
[15:57.280 --> 16:03.240]  cameras and then we'll trace it back to the drug cartels and stop the flow of
[16:03.240 --> 16:07.480]  guns and so the gun shops went along with it all over the country not just
[16:07.480 --> 16:11.200]  Arizona that's where the ATF blew the whistle and some of the agents did
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.880]  they're still trying to cover that up now all of that is unfolding but that was
[16:16.880 --> 16:21.560]  only a way to later show it on the news and not tell you it was actually ATF
[16:21.560 --> 16:26.000]  agents coming in and getting the guns it was a way to blame the Second Amendment
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.920]  just act like it was a sting when the sting was really the cover for a Iran
[16:30.920 --> 16:35.920]  Contra type situation where the drugs are shipped in and the guns are shipped
[16:35.920 --> 16:40.880]  out of the US to Mexico so that those cartels that are laundering their money
[16:40.880 --> 16:46.280]  through the big federal reserve banks so that they can defeat their competition
[16:46.280 --> 16:50.600]  that isn't laundering their money so the Mexicans ship in the cocaine the
[16:50.600 --> 16:56.240]  criminal US government ships them the guns and then shuts down the cowboys
[16:56.240 --> 17:01.760]  that are cutting in on all of their business so basically I thought that I
[17:01.760 --> 17:05.320]  would cover that and I keep beating that drum about the drug dealing element
[17:05.320 --> 17:10.920]  of this and the direct shipment of guns directly to the cartels that came out on
[17:10.920 --> 17:17.000]  Mexican TV I don't know six months ago was on National Mexican news down in
[17:17.000 --> 17:23.000]  Mexico but just now is it starting to leak out in our media now you're asking
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.560]  why haven't the Republicans just dropped the hammer the Republicans haven't
[17:27.560 --> 17:31.120]  dropped the hammer because fast and furious is only three years old since
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.840]  Obama got into office and got going but sent a low of documents and other
[17:35.840 --> 17:40.760]  documents that are in the Chicago Tribune and infolwars.com again Paul Watson
[17:40.760 --> 17:44.280]  reported on this six months ago when the documents first came out a few months
[17:44.280 --> 17:52.840]  later other media picked it up the the cartels have brought forward in court
[17:52.840 --> 17:56.400]  that they were authorized by the US government to do this and that's been
[17:56.400 --> 18:03.280]  confirmed and it goes back with Sinaloa at least five and a half years so that's
[18:03.280 --> 18:06.920]  the Bush administration that's why the Republicans are just gonna move to get
[18:06.920 --> 18:11.240]  Holder to step down and score political points against him but that's why Holder
[18:11.240 --> 18:15.160]  probably will end up stepping down but for now is hanging on because he's
[18:15.160 --> 18:19.640]  calling their bluff he knows full well this is an officially sanctioned Federal
[18:19.640 --> 18:24.120]  Reserve operation the Federal Reserve runs the US government runs the Pentagon
[18:24.120 --> 18:28.960]  runs the monetary system runs it all it's the private dictatorship they're
[18:28.960 --> 18:32.560]  officially now setting that up in Europe over the euro and admitting it's a
[18:32.560 --> 18:37.520]  financial dictatorship so this is an official operation just like Iran
[18:37.520 --> 18:42.040]  Contra they may burn a little ollie north or somebody they may burn a G
[18:42.040 --> 18:45.880]  Gordon Liddy like with Watergate but they're gonna move on from that unless
[18:45.880 --> 18:51.760]  we absolutely ran this story out to everybody that's what's going to happen
[18:51.760 --> 18:54.960]  now we're gonna go to break here in a moment I'm gonna come back and give the
[18:54.960 --> 18:58.560]  next little five-minute segment to Aaron because I know he's got a big stack of
[18:58.560 --> 19:03.040]  news and points he wants to point out and then I'm gonna come back at 33 after
[19:03.040 --> 19:08.720]  and reset and get into the incredible developments concerning the Federal
[19:08.720 --> 19:13.920]  Reserve these are some of the most positive things I could ever see happen
[19:13.920 --> 19:19.040]  and really signifies how this establishment has overreached and is in a
[19:19.040 --> 19:24.680]  desperate desperate situation they've had Al Gore George Soros Barack Obama
[19:24.680 --> 19:31.600]  Ben Bernanke the head of the Fed the Treasury Secretary the head of the
[19:31.600 --> 19:34.960]  Dallas Fed all come out in the last three days and say they're in solidarity
[19:34.960 --> 19:38.840]  with Occupy Wall Street that's because they're trying to co-opt it but I can
[19:38.840 --> 19:42.680]  tell you they failed they want to make it about free market Wall Street being
[19:42.680 --> 19:46.840]  bad instead of about the Federal Reserve and the inner coterie the big six
[19:46.840 --> 19:50.120]  megabanks that launder the drug money rather the child kidnapping that run it
[19:50.120 --> 19:53.880]  all and we could time to that as well Aaron Dyke's coming up with some of the

[24:25.720 --> 24:30.920]  we are back at the Alex Jones show this is Aaron Dykes again I'm sitting in with
[24:30.920 --> 24:35.600]  Alex it's an honor to be on the program with him especially on such an important
[24:35.600 --> 24:39.800]  day where we really need to send the signal out that at the root of these
[24:39.800 --> 24:44.560]  protests is the Federal Reserve that is the issue we need to deal with of course
[24:44.560 --> 24:49.680]  the loss of jobs and the attack on student loans and all the other economic
[24:49.680 --> 24:54.600]  issues going on are very important but as many of you know out there listening
[24:54.600 --> 24:59.520]  it is the Federal Reserve at the heart of all this that's an economic warfare
[24:59.520 --> 25:04.520]  strategy that was put in place 98 years ago as we've talked about many times on
[25:04.520 --> 25:08.280]  this show to allow those moneyed interest the robber barons who've all
[25:08.280 --> 25:14.280]  carteled together pooled their power and interest to carry out operations against
[25:14.280 --> 25:18.560]  the American people and throughout the world that's what it's always been even
[25:18.560 --> 25:22.320]  in the third world countries where the various coups that happened under the CIA
[25:22.320 --> 25:27.600]  it's always been really a monetary interest-based what used to be on Wall
[25:27.600 --> 25:31.560]  Street but it's not just Wall Street as we know now I think it's very
[25:31.560 --> 25:36.760]  significant that the Federal Reserve president in Dallas Richard Fisher has
[25:36.760 --> 25:40.800]  come out of the news lately he does appear in the news quite often but I
[25:40.800 --> 25:45.080]  think it's no coincidence he's got a number of statements today saying he's
[25:45.080 --> 25:50.960]  somewhat sympathetic to the Occupy Wall Street interest that that may shock you
[25:50.960 --> 25:55.080]  but he thinks you know job insecurity and high unemployment is the most
[25:55.080 --> 25:58.920]  important thing it's the same mantra the Federal Reserve has always pumped out
[25:58.920 --> 26:02.440]  that they've got to deal with unemployment that they have to be the
[26:02.440 --> 26:07.480]  ones to dole out these things even though we know it costs boo-coos of money to
[26:07.480 --> 26:12.400]  create just a few jobs under the Obama administration and the rest of it what
[26:12.400 --> 26:16.040]  they're really worried about is that someone like Alex Jones is showing up
[26:16.040 --> 26:20.080]  at the Federal Reserve really unmasking the true enemy and they're gonna hear
[26:20.080 --> 26:24.600]  the message and I really hope it is the start of a new American Revolution but
[26:24.600 --> 26:28.160]  you've got people like Richard Fisher coming out and trying to give cover and
[26:28.160 --> 26:32.880]  we've seen the Occupy Wall Street protests throughout the country really
[26:32.880 --> 26:38.160]  focusing in on the Federal Reserve in San Francisco the Occupy San Francisco
[26:38.160 --> 26:43.720]  group has been camped out at the Federal Reserve for more than a week and I'm not
[26:43.720 --> 26:46.520]  sure if they're completely sophisticated but the fact that they chose
[26:46.520 --> 26:51.320]  that location really says a lot we've got people on all sides of the spectrum
[26:51.320 --> 26:55.240]  beginning to identify the real enemy we've got Dennis Kucinich people like
[26:55.240 --> 26:59.920]  Ralph Nader really joining up and becoming allies with people like Ron Paul
[26:59.920 --> 27:04.480]  they certainly don't agree on all issues but they have identified that the Federal
[27:04.480 --> 27:08.440]  Reserve is completely predatory has to be reined in in one way or another
[27:08.440 --> 27:12.480]  people like Kucinich of course want to nationalize the Federal Reserve Ron Paul
[27:12.480 --> 27:16.280]  really wants to move to eliminate it and just draw out his power completely and
[27:16.280 --> 27:21.160]  return to sound money have competing currencies etc whatever happens though it
[27:21.160 --> 27:25.800]  the Federal Reserve does have to go it's a giant parasite it's a giant tick
[27:25.800 --> 27:30.160]  and I really hope people are going to show up in Dallas today they were of
[27:30.160 --> 27:35.360]  course already in Dallas part of the Occupy movement has been there with
[27:35.360 --> 27:39.760]  numbers of more than 200 demonstrators that has been in the news as well so it's
[27:39.760 --> 27:44.200]  really no surprise to see Dallas Federal Reserve president Richard Fisher coming
[27:44.200 --> 27:47.960]  out and trying to placate to this crowd trying to send a signal that he
[27:47.960 --> 27:52.760]  understands and feels our pain really they're afraid of anyone taking away
[27:52.760 --> 27:56.440]  that Federal Reserve power because of who that power represents because of who's
[27:56.440 --> 28:06.000]  behind that power with that in mind we also have Saman Mohamadi I really
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.720]  don't know how to pronounce his name but he always writes excellent articles at
[28:08.720 --> 28:12.640]  the excavator at the gates of the Great Beast occupy the treasonous Fed
[28:12.640 --> 28:19.120]  revolution begins in Dallas and he's got an excellent quote here from David
[28:19.120 --> 28:23.400]  Graham Phillips the treason of the Senate treason is a strong word but not
[28:23.400 --> 28:27.760]  too strong to characterize the situation in which the Senate is the eager
[28:27.760 --> 28:32.920]  resourceful and indefatigable agent of interest as hostile to the American
[28:32.920 --> 28:39.480]  people as any invading army could be and of course there is massive anger at
[28:39.480 --> 28:44.040]  Washington and the other political interests but it really represents the
[28:44.040 --> 28:48.520]  way they've continuously sold us out over a whole century to the moneyed
[28:48.520 --> 28:53.400]  interests who are represented in the Federal Reserve and it's time to as I've
[28:53.400 --> 28:57.440]  already said unmask them and really expose who they are now it's just coming
[28:57.440 --> 29:01.680]  up on the other side of the break but we do just want to hammer home that people
[29:01.680 --> 29:05.200]  are beginning to focus on the Federal Reserve all across the country there's
[29:05.200 --> 29:11.880]  12 branches or districts which are sort of important Federal Reserves in their
[29:11.880 --> 29:16.160]  own right and then there are dozens of other branch locations everywhere just
[29:16.160 --> 29:20.800]  look it up in your area and go to that location and start to send the signal that
[29:20.800 --> 29:24.120]  we know the Federal Reserve is the important issue behind all this walkie
[29:24.120 --> 29:29.960]  occupy Wall Street anger and everything and we're gonna get more into that on
[29:29.960 --> 29:34.240]  the other side keep in mind that Al Gore is among those who called for an Arab
[29:34.240 --> 29:38.760]  Spring in America only about a month ago August 3rd just a little over a month
[29:38.760 --> 29:43.480]  ago and so we're gonna talk about where that occupying Wall Street energy is
[29:43.480 --> 29:48.040]  going more on the other side info wars comm stay with us today will be a great
[29:48.040 --> 29:55.920]  day we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[34:00.040 --> 34:05.520]  very same families and so the bankers learned how to masquerade and come out
[34:05.520 --> 34:10.200]  with a federal reserve they had the big bankers JP Morgan and others come out
[34:10.200 --> 34:17.360]  and speak out against it and 1912 and 1913 how dare you try to pass this I don't
[34:17.360 --> 34:22.920]  want to be thrown in that briar patch whatever you do please please don't set
[34:22.920 --> 34:27.560]  up the Federal Reserve totally separate from government with government power
[34:27.560 --> 34:31.920]  but private for us to now completely control the issuance of currency and
[34:31.920 --> 34:38.200]  credit not just loan out $10 for every dollar in reserve but total power oh not
[34:38.200 --> 34:45.280]  that and that little ruse worked and here we are 98 years later earlier this
[34:45.280 --> 34:50.920]  year they celebrated the 100 year anniversary of hatching the plan at
[34:50.920 --> 34:55.920]  Jekyll Island Georgia just a few years before 1913 and we played the clips on
[34:55.920 --> 35:00.200]  air of Greenspan even released part of the speeches they were giving saying
[35:00.200 --> 35:05.400]  yes a lot of crimes been committed people are going to be angry and we're
[35:05.400 --> 35:09.600]  going to have to work with the people to punish those and there was lots of
[35:09.600 --> 35:17.120]  giggling up there on the stage with Bernanke and Greenspan and the rest of
[35:17.120 --> 35:21.480]  them because they think you're stupid children and they think I'm stupid and
[35:21.480 --> 35:26.400]  they know they can come out and say we're sorry capitalism was bad you're
[35:26.400 --> 35:31.800]  right we'll raise taxes on the middle class I mean the rich and we'll have
[35:31.800 --> 35:36.120]  austerity and oh you want free health care yeah we'll raise health care cost
[35:36.120 --> 35:40.440]  and not actually cover you and knock people off of it and have death panels
[35:40.440 --> 35:44.880]  because that's helping old ladies and then that's in the news more people
[35:44.880 --> 35:50.320]  getting off their health care total control total scams the greatest level
[35:50.320 --> 35:55.760]  of housing bust since great depression it's now official the government admits
[35:55.760 --> 36:04.680]  it they just con you and and and their program to fix the problems was a ruse
[36:04.680 --> 36:09.080]  they haven't failed they've succeeded in bankrupting this country and
[36:09.080 --> 36:14.080]  deindustrializing us and shutting off the value of our currency and hoarding
[36:14.080 --> 36:17.760]  tens of trillions of quote banker bailout money that's really a tax to the
[36:17.760 --> 36:22.120]  private Federal Reserve which they then use to acquire more infrastructure more
[36:22.120 --> 36:26.520]  media companies more defense infrastructure and then not have to have
[36:26.520 --> 36:30.920]  their retail sector banking anymore and actually quote make profits out of
[36:30.920 --> 36:34.720]  loaning you money now they're just like we're not gonna loan you things for cars
[36:34.720 --> 36:40.200]  or business if you got a credit card it's gonna be 30 plus percent that was
[36:40.200 --> 36:45.240]  Obama's credit card reform was to raise raise the interest on what you can you
[36:45.240 --> 36:49.320]  know do to people yeah hey yeah just like the health care was a reform total
[36:49.320 --> 36:55.280]  cold-blooded mislabeling so what's so exciting here Aaron Dykes who will go
[36:55.280 --> 36:58.440]  to in a moment was just alluding to it and then I'm gonna open the phones up
[36:58.440 --> 37:03.400]  coming up for pretty much the entire second hour today with your host Alex
[37:03.400 --> 37:09.560]  Jones that's of course good ol me and Aaron Dykes fact I'll just give the
[37:09.560 --> 37:19.720]  number right now 800-259-9231-1800-259-9231 we'll get you up and on the
[37:19.720 --> 37:24.320]  air now let me just boil this down very simply for new listeners we've got to
[37:24.320 --> 37:29.000]  remember for our old line listeners listening 16 plus years many of you
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  were
[37:33.120 --> 37:37.440]  teaching how they were we're having some kind of technical difficulties let me
[37:37.440 --> 37:41.560]  know as soon as Alex is back it's just about to break down really the Federal
[37:41.560 --> 37:46.440]  Reserve system for new listeners but in the meantime we want to talk more about
[37:46.440 --> 37:52.000]  Eric Blair's article Obama and Congress our Wall Street Geithner is the Federal
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.680]  Reserve the government itself is really just an interface a medium between the
[37:56.680 --> 38:00.760]  various powers in this country and we have been ruled far too long by those
[38:00.760 --> 38:05.360]  monetary interest but that does not mean that some broader socialist movement
[38:05.360 --> 38:09.480]  is the answer to taking on what really amounts to the Federal Reserve power and
[38:09.480 --> 38:14.160]  that is why we are trying to put so much spotlight on the Federal Reserve here
[38:14.160 --> 38:18.920]  Alex is back so we're gonna go back to him right now yeah what amazing
[38:18.920 --> 38:22.640]  technology we've been using Skype on and off for four or five years but it's
[38:22.640 --> 38:27.800]  just now gotten good enough with 4G technology as I sit here radiating
[38:27.800 --> 38:33.200]  myself the 4G is even better than the hotel landline connection so as I said
[38:33.200 --> 38:39.240]  here barbecuing myself with RF pollution that they now admit is cancer
[38:39.240 --> 38:44.520]  causing there is a good cost-benefit trade-off because now I can sit here like
[38:44.520 --> 38:51.640]  we're in the movie 2001 Space Odyssey Arthur C. Clark you know talking to you
[38:51.640 --> 38:58.240]  right now it is Buck Rogers so a great tool but it does have some glitches
[38:58.240 --> 39:02.280]  still now continuing you just heard what Aaron was saying government has
[39:02.280 --> 39:09.160]  become nothing but a facade a interface for mega global corporations that are
[39:09.160 --> 39:11.960]  owned by the big central banks because they're able to issue unlimited
[39:11.960 --> 39:16.800]  currency and credit and derivatives fraud instruments and buy real assets that
[39:16.800 --> 39:22.080]  consolidate power with it and now the big mega banks in every part of the world
[39:22.080 --> 39:26.360]  are are instituting what they've done in the last hundred years in the third
[39:26.360 --> 39:32.360]  world coming in financing politicians into power or financing coups military
[39:32.360 --> 39:38.720]  coups into power and then coming in and jacking up the utility prices jacking up
[39:38.720 --> 39:44.120]  the water and energy prices jacking up the toll roads slapping fines and fees
[39:44.120 --> 39:47.800]  on everything and calling it privatization but it's the opposite they
[39:47.800 --> 39:53.640]  seize what the public taxes and infrastructure and culture have built
[39:53.640 --> 39:59.360]  over hundreds of years and then absolutely shut the economy down and
[39:59.360 --> 40:06.400]  they don't care about quote so much making money they they raise the taxes
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.560]  through their dictators or or or plutocrats they put in power through
[40:10.560 --> 40:16.200]  their bureaucracies they raise the taxes up and up and up on every facet of life
[40:16.200 --> 40:21.600]  they devalue the currencies which are then also a tax on the price of energy
[40:21.600 --> 40:28.160]  and food because of devaluation and it's designed to fully destroy those
[40:28.160 --> 40:34.200]  cultures it is an economic warfare system and it was a big deal in 2002 when
[40:34.200 --> 40:39.680]  Joseph Stiglitz two-time Nobel Prize winner quit the World Bank he was the
[40:39.680 --> 40:45.040]  chief economist and right after that wink wink he says he didn't do it the BBC
[40:45.040 --> 40:49.680]  and Greg Palace were leaked thousands of pages of documents now
[40:49.680 --> 40:54.480]  palace in one report got quite a few of them out then so much pressure was put
[40:54.480 --> 40:58.560]  by the government on BBC which is government run in England the rest was
[40:58.560 --> 41:03.280]  not released but palace has talked about what was in those and the parts he was
[41:03.280 --> 41:08.200]  able to release were the I think it was a hundred and eleven point plan of the
[41:08.200 --> 41:12.760]  IMF and World Bank and concert together of how to come in take over a country
[41:12.760 --> 41:19.640]  give them quote loans which are then given only two subsidiaries of the IMF
[41:19.640 --> 41:23.880]  and World Bank they're just the holding company for the private banks that sit
[41:23.880 --> 41:27.800]  behind them they come in and say here's ten million dollars Brazil but you've
[41:27.800 --> 41:33.800]  got to spend it with XYZ globalist company and then that globalist company
[41:33.800 --> 41:38.360]  is a subsidiary of the very banks and that money they're loaning them is just
[41:38.360 --> 41:43.000]  fiat but backed up by Western taxpayers that's what gives it the value and also
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.320]  the Western giant military that we as taxpayers pay for and they wrap it all
[41:48.320 --> 41:52.520]  in the American flag the British flag the EU flag and then we the people get
[41:52.520 --> 41:56.600]  the blame for this great tyranny when we're the ones actually paying for it
[41:56.600 --> 41:59.640]  out of our hide now we do deserve some of the blame because we've been ignorant
[41:59.640 --> 42:04.160]  and allow this rod to be taken place but it's so complex how can you blame
[42:04.160 --> 42:08.520]  people you can only blame people once they've been given this information and
[42:08.520 --> 42:16.160]  they don't listen so let me sum it up this way those IMF World Bank plans
[42:16.160 --> 42:20.560]  talked about how they carried out these phases how they would come in with quote
[42:20.560 --> 42:25.120]  reforms after their first policies implode the economy to a certain level
[42:25.120 --> 42:29.960]  then they come in with more reforms promise to fix things that only make it
[42:29.960 --> 42:35.520]  worse and then more money more taxes is needed more toll roads more cutting of
[42:35.520 --> 42:40.960]  pensions more austerity as everything is crushed I mean California has raised
[42:40.960 --> 42:45.240]  more than 20 taxes the last two years they've now passed a giant 20 plus
[42:45.240 --> 42:49.880]  percent carbon tax they've gone into complete freefall from 20 something
[42:49.880 --> 42:54.360]  percent to over 33 percent back in November of last year it's reportedly
[42:54.360 --> 42:59.160]  40 plus percent in some areas now but 30 plus percent in California and a lot
[42:59.160 --> 43:02.520]  of economists say why is California doing this they know it's gonna make
[43:02.520 --> 43:06.840]  they're already ailing economy go into cardiac arrest because that's the plan
[43:06.840 --> 43:12.720]  once you fully implode everything through the phases everybody's completely
[43:12.720 --> 43:17.800]  desperate completely poor everything's falling apart crime explodes the police
[43:17.800 --> 43:21.840]  departments go bankrupt and then the globalists roll in and buy up
[43:21.840 --> 43:27.200]  everything for pennies on the dollar this is a scorched earth policy similar
[43:27.200 --> 43:31.560]  militarily to how the NATO the US England will blow the daylights out of
[43:31.560 --> 43:36.800]  Serbian infrastructure Iraqi infrastructure living in infrastructure
[43:36.800 --> 43:42.200]  the list goes on and on Ivory Coast infrastructure I mean they will go in
[43:42.200 --> 43:46.240]  even when they've already overthrown who they want in the 48 hours after they'll
[43:46.240 --> 43:51.320]  still keep bombing rebel forces and they'll blow up the water treatment the
[43:51.320 --> 43:56.920]  power plants whatever they can to then come in and tell the new government okay
[43:56.920 --> 44:02.960]  now we're going to loan you money at 20 30 40 percent compounding interest to
[44:02.960 --> 44:06.960]  rebuild this and you've got to spend that money with us so they give them our
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.000]  taxpayer money we gave the bankers in the bailouts and the taxes and the rest of
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.040]  it and then it comes right back to the bankers in their infrastructure but now
[44:15.040 --> 44:19.440]  it's globalist infrastructure with fluoridated water for the Irish or for
[44:19.440 --> 44:25.480]  the Ugandans in Africa now it's UN program for shots and Angelina Jolie
[44:25.480 --> 44:29.520]  shows up with little African kids and says I'm here to give you the shots
[44:29.520 --> 44:35.200]  meanwhile 10 miles away and you've got to their lining up families to take
[44:35.200 --> 44:40.000]  their property to quote plant trees for carbon offsets and just machine gunning
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.920]  them but it's all right because Angelina Jolie with big lips pumped full of
[44:43.920 --> 44:55.000]  college and it's going Brad Pitt and so it's just kill us I mean this is the
[44:55.000 --> 45:01.280]  incredible level of evil we're talking about now going back to this you've
[45:01.280 --> 45:04.200]  seen what they've done in the third world now they're coming to do it here
[45:04.200 --> 45:08.560]  incrementally as well and if you get to a pretty they just blow something up and
[45:08.560 --> 45:12.640]  say terrorists did it so now we've got to ban your protest and now we've got to
[45:12.640 --> 45:15.760]  stick our hands down your pants and violate you and now we've got to take
[45:15.760 --> 45:20.800]  blood from you checkpoints under federal mandates it's all about control it's all
[45:20.800 --> 45:24.080]  about training you that you're a prisoner that we've talked so much about now
[45:24.080 --> 45:28.560]  here is the incredible good news the Federal Reserve is just the regional
[45:28.560 --> 45:35.640]  holding company for the six big mega banks Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of
[45:35.640 --> 45:42.560]  America Wells Fargo City group and then there's a consortium of others but the
[45:42.560 --> 45:49.040]  point is they're pretty much subsidiaries of the same guys I mean that's why when
[45:49.040 --> 45:54.200]  you have a big Federal Reserve bailout in 2008 you learn more than half the
[45:54.200 --> 45:57.720]  money went overseas to foreign banks and foreign investors and then now you're
[45:57.720 --> 46:00.960]  hearing about the first bailout of Europe to begin you know the first two or
[46:00.960 --> 46:05.400]  three were just Spain or Ireland he were actually like bailout five or six now
[46:05.400 --> 46:08.680]  of you had all the bailouts together they're not bailouts they're taxes to
[46:08.680 --> 46:12.800]  the bankers they create derivatives they they control the finance ministers
[46:12.800 --> 46:15.840]  prime ministers and presidents they control the head of the Nature
[46:15.840 --> 46:19.760]  Conservancy they control it all he's a former Goldman Sachs guy most these
[46:19.760 --> 46:22.360]  third world countries they bring down you go look at who their president
[46:22.360 --> 46:26.160]  prime minister or finance minister is in some cases all three and they're all
[46:26.160 --> 46:29.880]  Goldman Sachs they're the even more than JP Morgan they were given the
[46:29.880 --> 46:34.200]  management job JP Morgan overalls bigger than Goldman Sachs it's kind of the big
[46:34.200 --> 46:42.480]  daddy but his henchmen you know the attack dog like hatchet man executor is
[46:42.480 --> 46:47.280]  Goldman Sachs the last 25 years and it's their operatives everywhere and those
[46:47.280 --> 46:50.880]  are the ring rates that come riding into your town into your city into your
[46:50.880 --> 46:54.520]  company into your business they're the ones shutting down the coal plants while
[46:54.520 --> 46:57.880]  they've got the coal plants that have the waiver they're the ones coming
[46:57.880 --> 47:02.960]  giggling with simpering soft voices with the daggers coming for the
[47:02.960 --> 47:06.840]  republic coming for infrastructure bringing you down to surf them all the
[47:06.840 --> 47:11.720]  same snake men marching and their little suits prancing around thinking that you
[47:11.720 --> 47:16.480]  can't see hoping you stay in darkness and blind but the minute we reveal them
[47:16.480 --> 47:22.040]  they become so weak now this here's the key to it all the snake men are
[47:22.040 --> 47:28.560]  panicking right now the snake men are in freefall right now they have
[47:28.560 --> 47:33.800]  actuaries they bragged about this they have Google and NSA tracking systems and
[47:33.800 --> 47:39.400]  that's what Google is that can predict with 99% certainty what mass movements
[47:39.400 --> 47:44.600]  are going to do down to just a few day period they admit this they have 93%
[47:44.600 --> 47:50.400]  accuracy and you can pull this up Google says their algorithm has 93% accuracy
[47:50.400 --> 47:54.480]  on what you're going to do next I think that one of the headlines earlier this
[47:54.480 --> 47:58.880]  year was Google knows what you're going to do before you know it's already tracked
[47:58.880 --> 48:02.920]  your subconscious mind by thousands of decisions it's tracked it's got an
[48:02.920 --> 48:07.440]  actuary matrix code layered system and it knows when you're going to go see a
[48:07.440 --> 48:10.920]  movie it knows what steakhouse you're going to go to because it's tracked all
[48:10.920 --> 48:14.320]  the decisions you've made and where you surf and where you go with those
[48:14.320 --> 48:18.680]  cookies Facebook same thing all integrated into a master NSA database
[48:18.680 --> 48:22.760]  it's come out Apple total NSA front Steve Jobs didn't develop any of it
[48:22.760 --> 48:27.280]  basically and he's one of their top technologists but he's a front man Bill
[48:27.280 --> 48:31.360]  Gates didn't develop any of it total NSA front Google didn't develop any of it
[48:31.360 --> 48:35.880]  admitted NSA and QTEL front all of this is 30 year old technology they're just
[48:35.880 --> 48:40.160]  doling out and we think we're getting something out of it really it's a
[48:40.160 --> 48:44.080]  tracking grid to to understand everything we're doing what we're thinking
[48:44.080 --> 48:48.240]  where we're going so it's a literal and this is what they call it they call it a
[48:48.240 --> 48:53.520]  crystal ball system an electronic crystal ball that's why they want RFID on
[48:53.520 --> 48:56.760]  all real products in the real third dimension so they can actually track
[48:56.760 --> 49:00.480]  physical things and they'll have true crystal ball power according to them and
[49:00.480 --> 49:05.800]  they can then look at that system and it gives them an algorithm and it says our
[49:05.800 --> 49:12.120]  prime projection by mid-october 2011 this is a year ago there will be
[49:12.120 --> 49:16.920]  uprisings across the Western world due to commodity price increases joblessness
[49:16.920 --> 49:20.800]  the statistics come in you know prime targets will be Wall Street you know
[49:20.800 --> 49:24.320]  Zbigniew Brzezinski said the public finally is awake and watching us
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.600]  computer continues prime analysis outbreaks of rebellion and then they
[49:29.600 --> 49:33.840]  bring in the actuaries on top of that prime response co-op revolution
[49:33.840 --> 49:39.160]  endorsed socialism and collectivization to transfer further wealth in next phase
[49:39.160 --> 49:42.880]  of program they bring in the next actuary map they got the men all in the
[49:42.880 --> 49:48.160]  rooms pentagon analysis bring in the other experts prime projection this has
[49:48.160 --> 49:53.320]  a 97% accuracy rate to be able to carry this out against them the alternative
[49:53.320 --> 49:56.720]  media scope shows that they're growing at this point they still can't stop us
[49:56.720 --> 50:01.000]  this is the type of actuaries that are going into all this prime projection then
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.280]  they bring in other experts if this fails stage terror attack new war that'll
[50:06.280 --> 50:11.160]  change the matrix flow of the data grid at a tribal level by getting us through
[50:11.160 --> 50:14.960]  fear to submit to them but I'm getting a little bit too technical here the point
[50:14.960 --> 50:18.880]  is they're looking into their crystal ball they they're tracking everything

[54:15.240 --> 54:19.640]  about 8 o'clock I'm gonna be there with fellow patriots who understand the
[54:19.640 --> 54:24.560]  fellow reserve is the holding company of the big mega parasitic foreign banks
[54:24.560 --> 54:28.000]  that have engineered our collapse that are getting a lion's share of our tax
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.120]  money through fraud and you have the gall because they realize that public
[54:33.120 --> 54:37.320]  awareness of them is cresting and with their Google systems with their
[54:37.320 --> 54:41.920]  Facebook systems tracking everybody tracking the decisions you make tracking
[54:41.920 --> 54:45.680]  Google admits with Google Gmail then they can sample tens of millions of
[54:45.680 --> 54:51.360]  people they have computers reading that that goes into algorithms the Federal
[54:51.360 --> 54:53.680]  Reserve admits they're tracking everybody in real time what you're
[54:53.680 --> 54:57.640]  saying about them that's been going on for decades now they're just going
[54:57.640 --> 55:01.480]  public with it you see and looking into their crystal ball which is really in
[55:01.480 --> 55:06.680]  thousands of graphs and breakdowns and boil downs and their their statisticians
[55:06.680 --> 55:11.880]  their sociologists their psychologists their behavioral psychologists all get
[55:11.880 --> 55:16.480]  together and they admit this now product placement propaganda placement I call a
[55:16.480 --> 55:19.800]  propaganda placement they now call it behavior placement they have all these
[55:19.800 --> 55:24.080]  messages in the media but they know it's not going to work that's why four years
[55:24.080 --> 55:27.000]  ago the British Ministry of Defense predicted everything that's now
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.480]  beginning to happen right around this same time frame so they're tempting
[55:31.480 --> 55:36.720]  they're attempting here to shift everything they're attempting here to try
[55:36.720 --> 55:42.160]  to take control and brand the idea against the Federal Reserve and the New
[55:42.160 --> 55:46.320]  World Order as something socialist just like four years ago with the beginning
[55:46.320 --> 55:51.040]  of the realty party under Ron Paul myself and others they tried to make it a
[55:51.040 --> 55:54.840]  right-wing white thing and said everywhere if you're against the Federal
[55:54.840 --> 55:59.560]  Reserve and big government you must be a white racist to make everybody else feel
[55:59.560 --> 56:04.360]  like well I can't be for freedom then see that mind game now they've sent in
[56:04.360 --> 56:10.160]  Al Gore George Soros move on dot org the unions Obama endorsing Occupy Wall
[56:10.160 --> 56:13.840]  Street the head of the Dallas Fed the head of the New York Fed the chairman of
[56:13.840 --> 56:20.280]  the Fed they're all coming out out in Los Angeles Mayor Villa Rigo says handing
[56:20.280 --> 56:25.600]  out ponchos to the protesters saying yes we need to raise taxes California has
[56:25.600 --> 56:29.960]  enough we're gonna give you free goodies I represent the people that's what
[56:29.960 --> 56:35.120]  Bernanke says now so they're attempting to steer all this anger and keep it away
[56:35.120 --> 56:38.520]  from the Federal Reserve that's why they've had the Federal Reserve minions
[56:38.520 --> 56:43.120]  and bosses come out and say oh it's so good we agree with you you want higher
[56:43.120 --> 56:47.880]  taxes now that's not even true we've had reporters all over the country it's true
[56:47.880 --> 56:52.200]  that the mainstream media lied and said Occupy Wall Street wanted socialism and
[56:52.200 --> 56:57.880]  that their leader was Michael Moore who says capitalism is the problem so so
[56:57.880 --> 57:02.720]  so they branded it like that like branding the Tea Party white racist you
[57:02.720 --> 57:06.280]  know stuff like that they're branding this socialist I have come out and said
[57:06.280 --> 57:10.880]  don't let them co-opt it this is attempting to take place right now
[57:10.880 --> 57:14.600]  Rand Paul has come out and said the same thing he's saying basically these are
[57:14.600 --> 57:19.120]  minions of Obama many of them and Occupy Wall Street can become violent if
[57:19.120 --> 57:24.760]  Obama continues to to endorse it now again that's not saying Occupy Wall
[57:24.760 --> 57:29.160]  Street is bad the point is the way Obama is endorsing it the way they're saying
[57:29.160 --> 57:33.520]  yes you deserve free health care you deserve free education you deserve all
[57:33.520 --> 57:37.720]  these things free well the people aren't gonna get that and then they're going to
[57:37.720 --> 57:40.840]  get violent you understand you tell somebody you tell a kid after the haircut
[57:40.840 --> 57:45.160]  if you're good at the haircut you get a lollipop you know barbershops used to do
[57:45.160 --> 57:47.960]  that I remember I'd sit there with a scratchy hair on my neck and you know
[57:47.960 --> 57:51.640]  the guy cutting my hair thinking about the lollipop if I didn't get the lollipop
[57:51.640 --> 57:54.160]  well I wouldn't have spoiled brat I wouldn't have gotten mad the point is a
[57:54.160 --> 57:58.160]  lot of kids will and so Rand Paul's talking about that it's up on info wars
[57:58.160 --> 58:02.520]  calm it's also one of the top stories of a drudge report calm but the bigger
[58:02.520 --> 58:08.760]  issue here is this is a huge awakening the fact that the establishments having
[58:08.760 --> 58:12.720]  to come out and try to co-opt a movement against corruption on Wall Street
[58:12.720 --> 58:16.200]  centering in and around the Federal Reserve shows how weak they are and
[58:16.200 --> 58:21.080]  shows how pathetic they are and the other great news is that all over the
[58:21.080 --> 58:25.720]  United States everywhere people are protesting the Fed right now and it's
[58:25.720 --> 58:32.320]  getting a lot of media attention and so so you're actively shifting away from
[58:32.320 --> 58:36.920]  just blaming capitalism to actually blaming the criminals the monsters that
[58:36.920 --> 58:40.400]  run the Federal Reserve stay with us
[58:42.400 --> 58:49.440]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network

[1:00:13.480 --> 1:00:23.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:29.000]  we are live from Austin Texas with Aaron Dykes they're waiting in the wings to
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:32.640]  add commentary today and also takeover there's any problems with our
[1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:36.400]  connection from Dallas as I overlook the private run-for-profit fellow reserve

[1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:48.120]  all of you Dave, Gerald, Chris, Maureen, Jaren, Jason, everybody that's
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:53.960]  patiently holding we're going to get to you coming up the toll-free number to
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:59.480]  join us is 800-259-9231 you know it's sort of just simplifying things always
[1:00:59.480 --> 1:01:03.800]  going to go into all this minutiae and the background and examples but I think
[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:06.880]  that's an effective way to get the word out but I think it's also important just
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:11.920]  to sum up what's going on I'm not a cheerleader 10-15 years ago I was pretty
[1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:18.120]  negative about our prognosis because I saw the the creepy police state being
[1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:21.880]  set up I knew history I'd read what the globalists said they were planning to do
[1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:26.760]  but I'm pretty positive now because they're not as arrogant as they used to
[1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:30.880]  be they're scared now they still can stage terror they could still launch new
[1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:34.600]  wars and boy that's certainly getting on the front burner now Israel Army
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:41.920]  simulates war call up that's coming up later but still once you identify the
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:46.080]  global banking structure that's not free market the jigs up that's why they're
[1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:50.720]  desperate as they've been for the last hundred years to brand all opposition to
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:55.840]  corrupt rich people as communism and then that's something they control that's
[1:01:55.840 --> 1:02:00.520]  collectivism they don't want true grassroots free market Aaron Dykes you've
[1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:04.560]  been hearing me rant here get give me your take on what I've been talking about
[1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:08.920]  here do you think I'm being overly optimistic or do you concur that the
[1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:12.880]  establishment is just absolutely desperate to be endorsing Occupy Wall
[1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:16.760]  Street in attempt to have them not see the fellow reserve as the enemy well I
[1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:20.320]  think they're desperate to endorse it because they know that anger's there and
[1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:23.880]  has to be vented somewhere and the important thing is that they're
[1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:27.920]  waiting to steer that into the agenda that's already in place Obama really
[1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:31.480]  doesn't have a leg to stand on anyway if you look at the way he's handled the
[1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:36.080]  economy in the true fashion but if he sort of panders to the masses and
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:39.680]  pretends he's on their side and working for the middle classes they may be able
[1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:44.160]  to posture Wall Street's candidate against Wall Street and co-op that
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:47.200]  movement and that's really what I think has to be warned against look what
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:51.080]  happened with the Tea Party it started with Ron Paul type people who wanted
[1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:54.760]  liberty who wanted to end the Federal Reserve who wanted to end the wars
[1:02:54.760 --> 1:03:01.560]  etc and that energy was transferred into endorsing and rebranding establishment
[1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:06.560]  candidates now Herman Cain is leading in all the polls this week 20 points ahead
[1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:10.960]  of even Romney and he's a total Federal Reserve creature but he has those Tea
[1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:15.480]  Party credentials so when I see someone like Al Gore calling for an American
[1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:19.600]  Arab Spring and then a month and well not even a month till those Occupy Wall
[1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:23.680]  Street demonstration started I really look to those establishment figures for
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:28.160]  trying to take that energy and they're trying to co-opt it so we need to fight
[1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:31.360]  back against that and try to make sure we're still looking at the main issues
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:36.960]  Alex exactly the establishment to simplify it just like they tried to make
[1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:40.960]  the Tea Party a partisan movement when it started out as just a true populist
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:44.960]  constitutional movement they were somewhat successful now they're trying to
[1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:54.280]  rebrand the Occupy Wall Street as a Obama Al Gore American Spring you know
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:04:01.840]  type thing where the solution is the tired old propaganda of collectivist
[1:04:01.840 --> 1:04:06.320]  everywhere like Michael Moore and I notice here that there's giant starvation
[1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:12.760]  increasing in North Korea North Korea spirals towards starvation it doesn't
[1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:17.920]  work it doesn't work you can't give everybody free education free
[1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:23.520]  healthcare somebody's got to have something taken from them and when you
[1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:29.640]  breed the populations that live in dependency you get the type of folks
[1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:35.080]  you see on the Jerry Springer show and I go out into America just since I was a
[1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:39.160]  child whether the people are black white Hispanic old young more and more
[1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:43.440]  America looks like a Jerry Springer show from the fluoride the bad food the
[1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:48.000]  dumbing down the TV the people talking about mindless issues it's a feedback
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:52.760]  loop but they're still I'd say more than half the population is not a Jerry
[1:04:52.760 --> 1:04:57.040]  Springer reject type and it's up to us to realize the establishment is trying to
[1:04:57.040 --> 1:05:01.640]  play class warfare and as Rand Paul said they could take over the occupants
[1:05:01.640 --> 1:05:06.160]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:11.800]  is our last chance to not relive history as a finishing off this agenda that we
[1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:15.960]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home turn members influence
[1:05:15.960 --> 1:05:20.800]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think
[1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:26.200]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the

[1:07:08.640 --> 1:07:12.920]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:16.920]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:07:16.920 --> 1:07:21.360]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:25.600]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:29.360]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:07:29.360 --> 1:07:33.480]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:22.120]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live I am here on the road in Dallas Texas I
[1:08:22.120 --> 1:08:28.440]  want to encourage all of you out there to be sure and come out tonight to the
[1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:36.280]  Dallas Federal Reserve five day to clock and if you can to stay out there
[1:08:36.280 --> 1:08:41.520]  even if you got a nearby hotel because I know folks that you have families and
[1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:46.440]  things you know it's it's it's hard to sit there and sleep out on the sidewalk
[1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:52.320]  or with a sleeping bag even if you rotate in and out at night and during the
[1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:56.560]  day and then more people will come we need to occupy this Fed here in Dallas
[1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:02.680]  to eat to get even more media attention and make sure that Ben Bernanke and all
[1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:06.760]  the rest of them the head of the Dallas Fed has come out today saying that he's
[1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:11.440]  in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street people not with the end the Fed
[1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:16.720]  people we are the in the Fed folks and it's time that we show that it's not
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:19.440]  about being liberal it's not about being conservative it's about being an
[1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:24.760]  American who wants your republic back and that we're tired of this private
[1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:30.320]  offshore banking dictatorship that has hijacked our country now Rand Paul came
[1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:34.320]  out today and later if we have time we'll play part of it it's again up at
[1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:37.760]  drudgereport.com it's our story from infowars.com Rand Paul
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:43.240]  Obama's rhetoric could turn Occupy protest violent and that's what I've
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:48.600]  said the system wants a French Revolution where the globalist can sit
[1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:53.360]  offshore and have a collectivist revolution to go after anybody who has
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:59.360]  wealth anybody that has created jobs a collectivist banker push to shut down
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:03.920]  the American system once and for all of the crony capitalist arch enemy is the
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:11.480]  founder of the Rockefeller dynasty said competition is a sin and so right now
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:15.920]  there's a battle over which way reforms are going to go in this country the road
[1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:19.000]  the globalist want to take you where they just blame Wall Street in the free
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:25.080]  market and the Federal Reserve's and solidarity with the demonstrators or the
[1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:28.280]  road of actually targeting the private Federal Reserve that owns the military
[1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:31.880]  industrial complex that has set up this corporate world government and is
[1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:35.920]  attempting to destroy our republic and every other free nation on the planet
[1:10:35.920 --> 1:10:40.960]  now I want to be clear just because Ben Bernanke and the head of the Dallas Fed
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:46.080]  and George Soros and Al Gore and Barack Obama have come out and endorsed
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:52.720]  Occupy Wall Street that is their attempt to basically like a guy trying to get a
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:57.480]  date to pick up the girl at the bar she's got to say no that's their attempt
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:03.080]  to say we're with you we love you okay at one level to co-opt it but at
[1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:08.560]  another level to make conservatives and libertarians go that must be a bunch of
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:13.320]  communist no I've had reporters all over the country I want to report to you the
[1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:18.600]  George Soros move on people have not been successful they have not been
[1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:23.000]  successful most the people there have got their head screwed on they know
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:26.760]  what's happening the media likes to go in though and show a bunch of people that
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:30.840]  aren't quite focused and don't know what they want to make them look confused and
[1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:35.600]  then cut to well these people got it together they want higher taxes and free
[1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:38.880]  everything now we're working on getting Lenin LaRouche on we're having some type
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:43.920]  of connection issue and we do have him now Aaron Dykes is riding shotgun with
[1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:47.760]  us we're only gonna have Lenin here for about 30 minutes then I promise we're
[1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:50.760]  gonna go to your phone calls people that are patiently holding and Bob
[1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:55.560]  Chapman's gonna be popping in and G. Edward Griffin as well towards the end
[1:11:55.560 --> 1:11:58.440]  of them we're gonna have G. Edward Griffin back on tonight with an ever
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:01.720]  before seen interview we did earlier in the week for him full wars nightly news
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:06.000]  7 p.m. central if you believe in this type of information please become
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:10.320]  subscribers at presentplanet.tv because you're truly supporting the
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:13.800]  growth of the alternative media look what we're able to do now with reporters
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:18.720]  in multiple cities we're here in Dallas we're here launching an operation to
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:23.600]  target the actual central bankers the actual crony capitalist monopoly
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:28.560]  insiders instead of just a general occupy Wall Street capitalism's evil
[1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:33.480]  free markets evil raise taxes to pay it in austerity money to foreign bankers
[1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:38.120]  now Aaron Dykes anytime you want pop in with questions for Lenin LaRouche he
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:44.640]  needs no introduction I've studied his material for about 16 years and I cannot
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:48.320]  disagree with his analysis of how the world works who was behind the power
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:52.800]  structure former director of the CIA called him the best private intelligence
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:57.360]  analyst organization out there of course that's the LaRouche organization you
[1:12:57.360 --> 1:13:02.000]  can disagree I guess you know with at least I do with some of their solutions
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:08.240]  but regardless of that out of all the hundreds of economists and historians we
[1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:13.600]  interview he's in the top two or three of his accuracy and analyzing the
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:17.280]  Super Congress a few months ago with us and where all this would go and now the
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:20.800]  admission that it's worse than the Great Depression and housing and spiraling
[1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:25.760]  out of control and everything that's happening Lenin LaRouche thank you so
[1:13:25.760 --> 1:13:32.400]  much for joining us sir bottom line give us your executive summary on exactly
[1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:37.720]  what happened three weeks ago with Occupy Wall Street who they are and the
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:43.240]  attempt by the Federal Reserve inner cartel to co-opt it in my view and trick
[1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:49.880]  the people into calling for austerity to be paid to the very culprits of our
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:54.720]  predicament well of course this is an old story it went through several phases
[1:13:54.720 --> 1:14:01.320]  what we're looking at now is the result what happened in 2007 when the bailout
[1:14:01.320 --> 1:14:06.640]  process really started it actually ran openly in 2008 but it was already
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:12.720]  running in 2007 at the end of at the end of September that year so we now are
[1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:17.320]  in a breakdown crisis of the entire international system that is the
[1:14:17.320 --> 1:14:23.360]  transatlantic system and there is no cure for this in the ordinary way this
[1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:29.640]  thing is going we're going dead on the water and you can't say exactly what
[1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:33.680]  date because a lot of things can be done to adjust things in the short term but
[1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:38.360]  essentially we reached the limits this thing is coming down now the solutions
[1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:43.400]  are fairly obvious we have to go to Glass-Steagall first but I think we have
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:48.040]  to get Obama out first now I don't think that his situation is impossible now
[1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:52.700]  Obama is extremely unpopular even some of the press has been going after him
[1:14:52.700 --> 1:14:58.520]  on interviews in a way which treats him as dead meat politically and I think
[1:14:58.520 --> 1:15:02.000]  he's pretty close to that right now unless sir in fact you talked about this
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.120]  months ago now we have the Washington Post Chicago Tribune every day calling
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:10.440]  for him to basically step down what did you make of him trying to embrace
[1:15:10.440 --> 1:15:16.920]  Occupy Wall Street yesterday in that speech and what did you make of the
[1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:25.560]  fact that you know so many people are now basically deserting him and then his
[1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:29.760]  statement of well I haven't prosecuted bankers because what they did was legal
[1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:33.840]  well yeah this very group of bankers changed the law got rid of Glass-Steagall
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:37.760]  to allow themselves to commit crimes but we've had the government say black
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:41.680]  people aren't humans before and it's the law we Hitler said he was allowed to put
[1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:47.480]  people in death camps because it was the German but it shows that it's still
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:51.040]  illegal to pass a law to be able to do something that's illegal under common
[1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:56.560]  law yeah the problem here is this thing is really coming down now and Obama is
[1:15:56.560 --> 1:16:01.600]  down you find a lot of the presses down on him too which means the signals out
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:07.960]  this guy is totally dead meat how it's going to work out is not exactly so what
[1:16:07.960 --> 1:16:13.080]  is needed is Glass-Steagall without without this reform and this is going
[1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:16.680]  to be enough we're going to have to go to a credit system that's the only way
[1:16:16.680 --> 1:16:21.600]  we can get enough jobs that productive jobs not the so-called fake jobs but
[1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:25.280]  enough to start rebuilding the US economy we're going to have to do it
[1:16:25.280 --> 1:16:31.840]  quickly we have very little time to waste we have options but it's highly
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:36.280]  dangerous and at the last minute virtually but the buildings about to
[1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:40.560]  go up in flames people have now changed their mind it says they're going to
[1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:45.640]  fight against Obama and fight against the kind of things he represents and so
[1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:49.960]  he's spinning that and running with open arms towards people that have woken up
[1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:54.680]  to him in a desperate way to co-opt it but I'm I'm on the ground sir I'm not
[1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:58.640]  seeing that working so I want to get into where you see this going for Obama
[1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:04.160]  what the Anglo-American establishment will do versus some of your ideas of
[1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:08.240]  instead of giving tens of trillion into foreign bankers they hoard this credit
[1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:14.160]  system to to to defrip to defibrillate of the economic heart
[1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:19.040]  we can do that this that's a very simple thing to do from a standpoint of
[1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:26.800]  technicalities and I think we have now a real search inside the US population
[1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:31.200]  you've got to look at the you know the 80% of the population of the voting
[1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:35.040]  population which has tended to vote against both Republicans the Democrat
[1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:39.640]  who they suspected of being sympathetic to what Obama represents that's where
[1:17:39.640 --> 1:17:43.560]  it stands now and what's happened you've seen now the press itself which has
[1:17:43.560 --> 1:17:49.360]  lost come on the game and began to ask nasty questions and make that gentle
[1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:54.720]  insults to the president in the last a lost appearance so he is actually dead
[1:17:54.720 --> 1:17:58.760]  meat and the only thing that he get him in the presidency still would be a
[1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:04.280]  virtual cool like some some kind of thing that that sort he's finished now the
[1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:08.600]  exact day he's finished is what some said but let me stop you for just a
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:13.600]  moment sir I'm because we got you on a bit late and I want to spend as much
[1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:16.960]  time with you as we can but Mr. LaRouche let me ask you this question from
[1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:22.160]  your deep understanding and connections out there in Wall Street in NDC is the
[1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:27.680]  mainstream organs of establishment you know mouthpieces like like Wall Street
[1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:32.280]  Journal like Washington Post Chicago Tribune telling him to step down is
[1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:37.040]  that so they get a new puppet to con people or is that members of the
[1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:41.320]  establishment realizing the system coming down is probably going to destroy
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:46.480]  them as well and is that desperate floundering do the do the banksters
[1:18:46.480 --> 1:18:50.480]  think they're in control of things or has it reached panic level because I'm
[1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:56.360]  seeing real signs now of panic and that's even more scary so that is panicked
[1:18:56.360 --> 1:19:00.760]  there is but there's first of all this qualified panic there's a there's a
[1:19:00.760 --> 1:19:06.080]  definite to get this guy out now we've had you know up to 80% of the actively
[1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:11.520]  voting of people have tended to vote against both Republicans and Democrats
[1:19:11.520 --> 1:19:17.040]  who went with Obama that was the early in September now we're getting now we're
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:22.000]  getting an actual breakdown crisis they cannot go any further with this bailout
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:27.480]  the bailout effort would blow everything out we have international all kinds of
[1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:32.120]  things that are going on I say right now we're on the edge it's a highly
[1:19:32.120 --> 1:19:37.240]  popular motive motivation out there we're gonna skip this break guys we're gonna
[1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:41.160]  skip this network break I'm telling Genesis that right now okay sorry
[1:19:41.160 --> 1:19:45.640]  Linden go ahead okay we're we're actually in a breakdown crisis and the
[1:19:45.640 --> 1:19:48.880]  only thing that work is there's several things that we have to understand what
[1:19:48.880 --> 1:19:52.960]  the positive measures are that will work the first thing you've got to do you've
[1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:57.480]  got to get this president out of there because with the cowardice among the
[1:19:57.480 --> 1:20:01.320]  politicians despite what some of them are saying these days they don't have
[1:20:01.320 --> 1:20:06.720]  the stamina to fuck this guy really and he has to be fucked absolutely his whole
[1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:11.920]  program has to go otherwise you cannot save the United States now if you get
[1:20:11.920 --> 1:20:15.760]  him under control in the process of being impeached or something like that
[1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:23.080]  you can control it at least temporarily if you then enact glass steel again the
[1:20:23.080 --> 1:20:27.120]  new version it's the same thing that before but simple version you think you
[1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:31.680]  will solve the problem by bringing it under control but you have to realize
[1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:37.280]  we have a huge mass of worthless paper which has been dumped on the United
[1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:42.080]  States as other nations in this bailout process of the past several years so we
[1:20:42.080 --> 1:20:46.720]  don't have much legroom to move we need to get a real employment program that is
[1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:50.760]  the production program not just okay let's go back then we bring back in
[1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:54.000]  glass steel doesn't let them create derivatives anymore which then he
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:59.680]  stabilizes and creates uncertainty in the entire financial universe we ride
[1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:04.360]  off the fraudulent debt of these mega banks and what pre-odd into some other
[1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:08.560]  financial institution how do you do that then let's get there's only one thing
[1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:13.160]  you know glass steel yes that'll solve the problem in one sense it'll bring
[1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:17.520]  the thing under control what you will have the Wall Street crowd of the London
[1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:21.920]  crowd and so forth will take a boss beyond belief they're going to lose
[1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:27.440]  heavily but the problem is with glass steel we would do the right thing but
[1:21:27.440 --> 1:21:31.520]  can we do enough of the right thing we've got to put people back to work
[1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:37.000]  rather faster I mean real production fast it's going to be a hard job we're going
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  to have to have more credit the system so we're going to have to take a create a
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:44.840]  credit system of the time that the United States did in the first
[1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:49.000]  Constitution which is how we got out of the mess we were in at the you know at
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:52.160]  the end of the war we're going to have to do that we're going to have to launch
[1:21:52.160 --> 1:21:57.720]  some large programs and high-gain programs and these programs will actually
[1:21:57.720 --> 1:22:02.920]  allow us to get into a recovery mode we're going to have to get rid of NASA I
[1:22:02.920 --> 1:22:08.560]  mean we building projects bridges NASA maglev what are some of the other
[1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:13.280]  examples and if people say this is socialist I'm here debating different
[1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:16.880]  programs the point is we've already given tens of trillions to foreign banks
[1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:20.400]  that goes nowhere paying off derivatives you know the point is they've
[1:22:20.400 --> 1:22:23.880]  already killed our free market there's got to be some way to put people back to
[1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:27.960]  work instead of just going on welfare roles might as well give them a job is
[1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:33.080]  what you're saying no they did that they we won't even give them welfare that was
[1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:38.160]  that's what's happening now so that what we have a situation where the federal
[1:22:38.160 --> 1:22:43.120]  government must take responsibility for what is responsible for the federal
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:47.640]  government the private interests are not compelled to serve the public
[1:22:47.640 --> 1:22:52.000]  interest their comp their compelled to try to do what they can in their own
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:56.560]  judgment and in their own interest but we need a large program like what
[1:22:56.560 --> 1:23:02.360]  Roosevelt did we need on a large scale the WAPA is one of the key drivers we
[1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:07.480]  have to reform our system as a credit system we have to build up a banking
[1:23:07.480 --> 1:23:14.360]  system of the proper type now we've got to get high technology jobs in there and
[1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:18.720]  we've got to start bringing the population back in to the direction of
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:24.760]  high-quality production we also have an option with what's going on with Russia
[1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:30.480]  and China as some other countries today in the Pacific region we have the market
[1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:36.040]  at ability to launch one of the biggest programs of recovery that's ever been
[1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:40.000]  done it's potentially available to us it's going to take some years to get the
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:44.640]  thing really successful but we can act immediately to stabilize the present
[1:23:44.640 --> 1:23:48.960]  situation and reverse some of the evil trends that are killing people okay we're
[1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:54.040]  talking to Lyndon LaRouge right now and we're gonna give you the websites in a
[1:23:54.040 --> 1:23:59.000]  moment and regardless of you like his solutions or not I like some of it I
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.520]  just don't know if it was ever doable and there's always the danger of this but
[1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:06.800]  we are here at the point of total collapse. Lyndon my issue here is you
[1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:10.920]  talk about high technology programs that have led the world that that made
[1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:17.320]  America great look at just Apple with some well deployed well marketed trinket
[1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:23.960]  technology that was already out there they were just good at more cash reserves
[1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:27.920]  in the US government there's no doubt that pure research and and true
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:33.880]  development would put this country you know at the forefront why do the
[1:24:33.880 --> 1:24:38.840]  banksters wage war against industrial and high-tech economies why do they
[1:24:38.840 --> 1:24:43.400]  openly say morey strong and others they want a post-industrial world in the
[1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:48.200]  United States while transferring it to China why are they destroying their own
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:52.320]  military command base but they're doing it because that's that's what they're
[1:24:52.320 --> 1:24:58.200]  like centuries is that what happened was you had but we were about to go to war
[1:24:58.200 --> 1:25:02.800]  in the end of China the president president Kennedy opposed that
[1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:08.680]  he posted flat with back with Douglas MacArthur on it so suddenly Kennedy is
[1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:13.360]  killed on what happened not only did we get into a war which ruined us for about
[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:18.320]  10 years of war in inter-China area and that ruined us permanently because
[1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:23.440]  Kennedy would oppose that war and who had a large industrial development
[1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:29.320]  program in there that was killed and the killing of Kennedy resulted in the
[1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:37.600]  cancellation of the glass of the glass table the WAPA program the WAPA was on
[1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:42.760]  the board Bobby Kennedy was going to go for it too if we've gone with the WAPA
[1:25:42.760 --> 1:25:47.120]  at that time we have solved our problem and maintained the dynamic that we were
[1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:50.520]  getting into in the beginning of the 1960s well he was also moving to
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:57.240]  nationalize the Fed and start issuing interest-free US money at least to the
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:26:02.480]  government it was that's different that's that's actually a credit system yes
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:06.600]  been done been done before it warred it in other kinds of emergencies and it's
[1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:10.280]  correct to do as long as the right program but but this is the situation
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:16.120]  once once Kennedy was killed and then his brother Bobby to this assassination
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:21.920]  ensured this long war like this long pattern of long wars we've been going
[1:26:21.920 --> 1:26:27.800]  into ever since we've been blood led to death by long wars and the public hasn't
[1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:33.200]  been so you're saying these finance capitalist parasites crony monopoly men
[1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:38.000]  it's a tropism they can't help but destroy everything it's what they do they
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:41.800]  don't build things they wreck things but you've got a political interest by
[1:26:41.800 --> 1:26:44.640]  they're not just the money people but the money people have to be working for a
[1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:48.360]  kind of interest they don't give a damn about the United States they don't give
[1:26:48.360 --> 1:26:52.560]  a damn about the people they want to reduce the population size the British
[1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:56.540]  for example and testing on reducing the world's population from about seven
[1:26:56.540 --> 1:27:01.040]  billion people down to less than one and that's the kind of policy we're
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:06.560]  talking about this is this this whole it kind of program going on so we have to
[1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:11.960]  get a program going like glass steel and glass steel is the kind of driver which
[1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:17.720]  can most quickly restore the okay let me ask you this then a mr. LaRouche
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:20.680]  because your abs I totally agree with you glass steel yeah I mean that that's
[1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:24.360]  what got us into all this that's what allowed them to do this and Obama says
[1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:28.120]  well it was legal yeah because you criminals got in to the government
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:33.120]  changed the law there was a reason this was illegal it got us into 1929 how do
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:36.960]  we get glass steel back I mean you've said as the crisis gets worse and worse we
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:40.440]  have a chance now but I don't hear Congress talking about bringing glass
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:44.320]  steel back well you will find it that we're getting close to the point that
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:49.800]  the folks will be there the danger is not getting glass steel and is the fact
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:54.280]  as long as this president still has an account he with his foreign partners
[1:27:54.280 --> 1:27:58.440]  will probably able to jam up and prevent glass steel from being enacted at
[1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:03.360]  that time so this fellow has got to be in neutralized not just he's not going
[1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:08.400]  to leave office at once I don't think but he's going to be jammed up by various
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:13.160]  kinds of legal action against him for what he's done if he's neutralized in
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:15.920]  some significant degree and I think he's on the way to that that's what's
[1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:21.320]  happening with somebody's turncoats who sell me back in against Obama now but
[1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:26.440]  if we get him under control we can get glass steel through we almost have the
[1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:31.960]  votes for it now except it's Obama's is still president as effectively president
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:35.080]  it's gonna be tough to get that vote through we see what happened with that
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:38.920]  before okay so Obama has to go and and you were saying this a year ago six
[1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:42.200]  months ago two months ago now the establishment's panicking so much
[1:28:42.200 --> 1:28:45.880]  they're saying that mr. Little Rouge we're going to break here in a moment
[1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:49.280]  I'm gonna come back and talk about where we're going if we don't change course
[1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:53.800]  and the if we don't change course what's the time frame start getting into that
[1:28:53.800 --> 1:28:58.760]  now where are we going what did when you say collapse what does that mean I mean
[1:28:58.760 --> 1:29:03.280]  a general breakdown crisis of the of the transatlantic system which will then
[1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:08.400]  become a crisis for the trans-pacific system but the immediate threat now is
[1:29:08.400 --> 1:29:12.440]  that Europe is already going down the ditch the United States is virtually on
[1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:17.200]  the ditch if we don't reverse this immediately we're going into we're going
[1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:21.160]  into a breakdown crisis not just a depression I mean a breakdown crisis
[1:29:21.160 --> 1:29:26.160]  it's all there we also are inches away with a lot with a lot of public
[1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:31.120]  support for the kind of measures of recovery measures which we can we do
[1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:35.600]  know how to put it to effect but we need to have enough control in terms of
[1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:39.480]  political control to make sure that the necessary measures go through all right
[1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:43.480]  little Rouge please please stay there we got to go to break info wars comms our

[1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:34.960]  Chris in Texas Marine in Virginia Jason in Texas and others for your comments
[1:33:34.960 --> 1:33:40.120]  and questions Aaron Dykes is riding shotgun with us today I am here in
[1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:45.960]  Dallas Texas Lynn and LaRouge I want to ask you this question sir you've got the
[1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:49.320]  Occupy Wall Street people just criticizing free market capitalism at
[1:33:49.320 --> 1:33:52.680]  least some of them that's how the Federal Reserve is trying to steer it
[1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:57.600]  instead of pointing out that it's insiders operating that have created
[1:33:57.600 --> 1:34:01.920]  this I'm calling for moves to actually occupy the private Federal Reserve and
[1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:06.480]  point out that it needs to be nationalized as Kennedy began to move
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:11.400]  towards doing or as you know Lincoln did with a similar system as you know at
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:15.360]  the time when the Rothschild's you know wanted outrageous amounts of interest
[1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:19.680]  for them to loan him money he just said I'll just issue government credit which
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:23.560]  is what the banksters do and have built their world empire out of can you sum
[1:34:23.560 --> 1:34:28.720]  up for people out there what the Federal Reserve is and if you agree with my plan
[1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:36.200]  to try to shift away from nebulous Wall Street and Soros is crowd trying to you
[1:34:36.200 --> 1:34:41.480]  know call for austerity back towards the Federal Reserve itself and the British
[1:34:41.480 --> 1:34:46.440]  in tell type folks well we first of all we have to do plastic well that's the
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:50.360]  first step if you don't do class table you know you cannot solve this problem
[1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:54.360]  you can't manage it if you put through glass steel you would only have a
[1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:59.840]  problem but you've halfway to solving it what we have to go toward is a federal
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:04.840]  credit system which is pretty much what we did with the in the coming out of the
[1:35:04.840 --> 1:35:09.360]  Revolutionary War victory there it was built into the Constitution now the
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:13.880]  system of national banks the first and second national bank of the United
[1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:18.480]  States were the instruments by which the United States was safe we get in a
[1:35:18.480 --> 1:35:24.160]  situation where we have to get out of credit as such signed off for by the
[1:35:24.160 --> 1:35:27.960]  federal government this credit will be then used through banks and other things
[1:35:27.960 --> 1:35:34.360]  through loans which are going to build up our economy now that that's what we
[1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:39.920]  need to do if we do that we can get out of this mess by going to a high
[1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:45.560]  technology project as a policy typified by the water but we also have to take
[1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:49.840]  intermediate steps at the same time which will get an unemployed population
[1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:55.640]  unskilled population back into labor force as an active product okay we've
[1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:58.800]  covered that earlier give us your websites for people to find out more
[1:35:58.800 --> 1:36:05.560]  about your plan oh again I don't have this but the head there's a loose pack
[1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:11.040]  and and and LaRouche pub both of those will lead you there we have links to
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:15.160]  them up on info wars calm I just wanted to find out the best one I guess
[1:36:15.160 --> 1:36:21.840]  LaRouche pack and LaRouche pub both of them yeah right we'll we'll we'll we'll
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:25.840]  take people there look sir we've had you on about solutions before and I I
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:30.120]  appreciate your ideas and I agree with quite a bit of it my only question here
[1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:34.600]  is the time frame because you've been very accurate as of late predicting what
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:39.400]  would happen next where is Europe going will Germany put up with bank rolling
[1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:45.120]  this new economic union that that's just a system for extracting the wealth of
[1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:49.640]  the people to the multinational banks and where does that go in Europe because
[1:36:49.640 --> 1:36:54.040]  you know obviously Europe is connected to what's happening here in America in
[1:36:54.040 --> 1:36:58.680]  the whole transatlantic situation it will go the other way what you have some
[1:36:58.680 --> 1:37:04.960]  movements as in France a former prime minister of France is moving in a useful
[1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:09.400]  direction you have tendencies at various parts of Europe to do something but
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:15.880]  unless the United States acts first you're both do it so therefore who's got
[1:37:15.880 --> 1:37:19.680]  to do it but you'll get the Russia is doing something big China is doing
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:23.320]  something big that's going to be a significant factor of this thing but the
[1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:29.480]  key thing is the United States must take the lead we must get this guy under
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:34.600]  control get him out we have to go back to the kind of program but Kennedy
[1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:38.320]  company would appreciate would appreciate including classic I understand
[1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:42.640]  that sir but this is my question we know Obama's a puppet we know he
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:47.680]  represents the corrupt elements of Wall Street but isn't it like shark teeth I
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:53.240]  mean who rolls in behind Obama and won't you just have a new puppet but
[1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:58.480]  the same same puppeteers you know you won't they would be the only thing you
[1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:04.400]  could get in that direction would be an outright dictatorship that's that's the
[1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:08.800]  only thing you get from that squad they are not capable of any bailout program
[1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:13.520]  they're not capable of doing anything good it's up to you top to those in the
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:18.520]  institutions who recognize the United States has to be saved it has to be very
[1:38:18.520 --> 1:38:23.640]  rough and direct action because we've got a sick population they can't take
[1:38:23.640 --> 1:38:27.680]  any more of this the whole system is on the verge of crashing I mean we could be
[1:38:27.680 --> 1:38:31.000]  talking tomorrow morning and find out there's no economy anymore we're
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:35.040]  tied box gonna say that's gonna be the case but I'm saying that's what could be
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:40.400]  the case at any time now no our ship is going directly towards rocks we've
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:44.520]  already hit some big ones but we're going towards a rocky shoreline there's no
[1:38:44.520 --> 1:38:49.480]  doubt but if we put that through glass steel get it through and get into a
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:54.520]  credit system operation use no opera as a commitment that's gonna dictate what
[1:38:54.520 --> 1:38:58.840]  we do you're saying now return the ship but then we've got to repair the holes
[1:38:58.840 --> 1:39:04.040]  the actually we can we know how to fix those hole we've done it before look
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:07.560]  what Frank and Roosevelt did when he came in now this situation is worse
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:12.360]  actually the Frank and Roosevelt face but the same method the same approach
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:17.600]  will work what you need is not jobs what you need is real based building
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:22.680]  jobs high technology jobs as much as possible and the waffa is the
[1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:27.680]  typification of that we have opportunities and you know we can we can
[1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:32.800]  actually from go we can start a slow buildup that accelerating buildup of the
[1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:37.680]  US economy again and that can be done by the federal government it can be the
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:41.880]  only way it will happen it will happen by the help of other countries but it
[1:39:41.880 --> 1:39:45.360]  will happen only but in the US government itself puts its muscle behind
[1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:50.360]  this but this record rescue operation I know this the Democrats want to raise
[1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:54.360]  taxes which will put the country into a bigger cardiac arrest they make it about
[1:39:54.360 --> 1:39:58.440]  taxing the rich when the big globalist Richard offshore and exempt the main line
[1:39:58.440 --> 1:40:01.640]  Republicans are like just keep the banker bailouts going and corporate
[1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:05.640]  welfare is great and have a $2 trillion total defense budget that's gonna
[1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:10.240]  bankrupt us and it goes nowhere and so people can't criticize you calling for
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:14.280]  pure investment and call that socialism when the other two things we have are
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:19.960]  just sheer sheer madness you know I would like to just see massive tax cuts I'd
[1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:24.760]  like to see some basic fair tariffs put in place I'd like to see our military
[1:40:24.760 --> 1:40:30.520]  pulled out of most the bases I'd like to see the Glass-Steagall reenacted I'd
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:34.880]  like to see the the the the quadrillion-plus and derivatives written
[1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:39.520]  off and sure that would cause it I mean I mean that's just common sense I don't
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:43.680]  want a year though from so-called conservatives all day about well we
[1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:47.880]  shouldn't have any investment or programs to get people working when
[1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:50.480]  they're just gonna be on welfare anyways and if you don't give them the
[1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:54.600]  welfare they're gonna burn the cities down I mean every direction we go down
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:40:59.040]  more and more of our options are being shut down and and Lyndon I'm not trying
[1:40:59.040 --> 1:41:02.680]  to be negative here but I don't really see the establishment changing course I
[1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:07.960]  I know there's elements that think the wrecking of the ship is is the way
[1:41:07.960 --> 1:41:11.560]  they're gonna fully take over the system like we're some third-world country
[1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:15.980]  that the IMF is imploding through the shock doctrine but I don't think you're
[1:41:15.980 --> 1:41:18.920]  gonna have the same effect this is not a third-world country they're wrecking
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:23.960]  when they wreck the US and the Euro they wreck the entire globe and we go into
[1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:27.320]  absolute hell and we've got Israel running around talking about hitting
[1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:31.400]  Iran I think they're gonna try to start a big war I think that's how they plan
[1:41:31.400 --> 1:41:36.080]  on getting out of this and it was that was a plan on there but I don't think
[1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:40.160]  it can work at this point they said this we're actually gonna break down
[1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:45.840]  crisis these guys who have been running this show have lost their nerve they
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:51.040]  realize that they've got no bottom in their ship and the question is if we've
[1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:56.240]  got the leadership inside the United States of leading responsible citizens
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:42:00.400]  especially but some in the Congress who will come out I think under proper
[1:42:00.400 --> 1:42:04.160]  condition will come out now it's not to do the kinds of things that should have
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:09.280]  been done before we have the agenda which can actually fix this problem it's
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:12.320]  not going to be a miracle solution but it will seem like a miracle the people
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:16.280]  have been going down the road it's ways this is going for the past years we can
[1:42:16.280 --> 1:42:21.280]  actually rebuild this nation we've done it before we know how to do it it's in
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:25.280]  the system it's built into our system our system of government and there's
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:29.800]  some options we have in the world of the large we can win the question is can we
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:34.440]  enough people with the guts in leading positions influential positions decide
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:39.280]  we're going to do it we can save this nation with this right now and we don't
[1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:44.000]  have much time I understand well obviously next week sometime I'd like to
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:47.520]  get you back on when I'm back in studio to really go over your ideas for
[1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:51.400]  solutions then we're gonna have some people on like Lou Rockwell to give a
[1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:55.480]  more Austrian economic view on it but regardless we know the direction we're
[1:42:55.480 --> 1:42:58.840]  going right now has got to be reversed and I do I have studied history and
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:03.640]  you're right at the end of the war in 1798 hyperinflation totally bankrupt the
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:08.160]  system you're talking about got us out of it and work quite well Lincoln did
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:12.000]  something similar and funded a whole war off of what you're talking about and
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.960]  then of course is why they killed him later regardless what you think of
[1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:19.960]  Lincoln the fact is is that we know the way we're going is destructive Aaron
[1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:23.120]  Dykes in closing I know you've been waiting in the wings there do you have
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:25.720]  any questions or comments for Lenin Rouge we're gonna let him go and go to
[1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:29.860]  phone calls yeah obviously I see the significance of bringing back Glass
[1:43:29.860 --> 1:43:34.000]  Stegel but I was wondering what he sees as the role of reigning and globalism
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.960]  because it'd be very hard to bring any kind of industrial productive base back
[1:43:37.960 --> 1:43:43.160]  to the country when they're dedicated to shipping jobs overseas the brain drain
[1:43:43.160 --> 1:43:47.640]  stuff that they facilitated how do we fight that if it means ending treaties
[1:43:47.640 --> 1:43:52.680]  I'm ready to start talking about that but we're right now reality is real money
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:57.160]  I'm talking about money that's fungible real money exists only in the hands of
[1:43:57.160 --> 1:44:01.320]  nation got national governments including the United States we may look
[1:44:01.320 --> 1:44:07.400]  poor but all those bankers are bankrupt all the big money guys are bankers on
[1:44:07.400 --> 1:44:13.840]  these yep and therefore we the United States government controls the ability
[1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:19.240]  of the government to create credit federal credit the mobilization of
[1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:24.360]  federal credit for getting the economy working again is the most powerful force
[1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:29.640]  on this planet if we make it we do that do that and that's the solution get
[1:44:29.640 --> 1:44:35.400]  federal credit mobilize for things that do work and the federal government has
[1:44:35.400 --> 1:44:39.400]  to do it because that's going to be the same works but we have we have to by
[1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:44.920]  putting the Glass Stegel through we will wipe out Wall Street and the city of
[1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:52.000]  London they cannot withstand a Glass Stegel impact on their swindles you're
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.480]  right that's why they won't bring it back even though it's the common sense
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:59.000]  thing because it's off that their power to create artificial money for
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:04.560]  themselves exactly and only in a crisis of this time where the American people
[1:45:04.560 --> 1:45:08.200]  and more and more members of the Congress and others are breaking you
[1:45:08.200 --> 1:45:13.360]  know they're breaking out of the cage they're willing to go now to a federal
[1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:19.920]  resort a federal credit system to get this country moving again this is the
[1:45:19.920 --> 1:45:25.520]  time where we have the we have the aces what about things like the Dakotas
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:29.920]  your state bank system as well I mean that's a microcosm those have worked
[1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:35.240]  quite nicely as well but if you need the power of federal credit you can't rely
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:39.920]  upon just bank deposit credit you have to rely on bank deposit credit for the
[1:45:39.920 --> 1:45:44.720]  banking system but the real thing we need is we need a masses of federal
[1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:49.200]  credit control federal credit for large projects which will rebuild this
[1:45:49.200 --> 1:45:54.000]  economy all right this is where the as Roosevelt did in his time all right
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:57.840]  well we're having a discussion about this undoubtedly the system we're under
[1:45:57.840 --> 1:46:03.000]  this crony insider monopoly thing is the worst possible system and we're
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:06.760]  certainly looking at different lifeboat options here linen LaRouche you called so
[1:46:06.760 --> 1:46:10.160]  much of this with great precision people can find out more just googling
[1:46:10.160 --> 1:46:14.040]  linen LaRouche you'll see LaRouche pack what is it dot com LaRouche pub dot com
[1:46:14.040 --> 1:46:18.120]  and other sites thank you so much for spending time with us today sir good to
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:22.440]  be with you all right well again we're here trying to protest the Federal
[1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:28.000]  Reserve itself and that is one of our demands and I'm people saying well Alex
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:34.200]  write down our demands I've given my ideas but this is for you also to come
[1:46:34.200 --> 1:46:38.880]  to demonstrations to tell the media what you want you notice with the Occupy
[1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:43.080]  Wall Street group there are people in there I'd say 40 50% I'm calling to end
[1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:48.280]  the Fed you understand the problem but the media the mainstream corporate media
[1:46:48.280 --> 1:46:51.640]  has not been interviewing them instead they talk to people that just go I want
[1:46:51.640 --> 1:46:55.760]  free health care I want free this I want free that you you don't get anything
[1:46:55.760 --> 1:47:01.280]  without industry and jobs and then it's that job that then gets you those things
[1:47:01.280 --> 1:47:04.560]  because you're contributing to the economy we just go to a system where it's
[1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:08.040]  all free everything collapses I mean it's just common sense I can't believe
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:14.280]  people don't understand this but we are calling as I did no bomb deception for
[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:17.760]  the Republic as I did with George Humphrey economists you know 12 years
[1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:21.320]  ago when they got rid of it I had him on predicting everything that would happen
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:27.720]  he wrote a book on it common sense copying the name Thomas Payne of his
[1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:32.360]  book I've tried my best to warn you about what was coming and I agree with
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:36.800]  LaRouche the globalist had the power they had the Hutzpah the bravada the
[1:47:36.800 --> 1:47:42.040]  hubris they went with it and now it's creating something a black hole that's
[1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:47.760]  even gonna destroy them I think they're going past the phase of lying to
[1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:51.640]  themselves saying they can control this they got greedy it's like Hitler
[1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:57.040]  turning into Russia to try to go beat Stalin it's a fatal move by the
[1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:00.360]  globalist they've bitten off more than they can chew and they're taking us
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:03.320]  along with them now in the next two segments I promise we're gonna go to
[1:48:03.320 --> 1:48:07.200]  your phone calls but this is history happening right now if you aren't going
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:11.640]  out to your Federal Reserve in your area and exposing that it's a fraud and that
[1:48:11.640 --> 1:48:15.320]  it's the author of the scam and that it's a Ponzi scheme and that they're the
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:19.760]  problem and that hey we know you're trying to co-op occupy Wall Street so
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:24.360]  you can call for socialism to make the public dependent and pay yourself bail
[1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:28.920]  out money if you're not doing this right now you're crazy folks this is the big
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:33.720]  fight we the American people who understand what's happening black white

[1:49:07.040 --> 1:49:12.040]  war it's that simple Aaron what do you think of my basic strategy I mean it's
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:15.720]  just a no-brainer for me it's just total common sense it seems like anybody
[1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:19.560]  should understand this you've got to identify the actual globalist you've
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:23.400]  got to go to the head of the stake and people need to be here this is history
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:27.200]  that's about to happen and I'm excited to see between 200 and 600 depending on
[1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:31.840]  what's press report yesterday out there at the Fed and I noticed in the news
[1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:35.520]  today they said that was basically triggered off of my call Sunday again
[1:49:35.520 --> 1:49:39.920]  that shows the power of this we show up in mass Aaron and people see that it's
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:44.400]  gonna then domino effect we got to push this first domino over and folks it's
[1:49:44.400 --> 1:49:49.000]  tipping like this right now Aaron yeah and I'm very heartened by the momentum
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:52.880]  that's been built up people starting to understand that the Fed needs to at a
[1:49:52.880 --> 1:49:56.980]  bare minimum be audited by an independent entity not the stuff Herman
[1:49:56.980 --> 1:50:02.920]  Cain's talking about about little minutia inside baseball audits why don't
[1:50:02.920 --> 1:50:06.640]  you just call them up well you did go to the Kansas City Fed he was the boss of
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:10.600]  and they came off the property with guns and said leave yeah they said don't
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:13.880]  even look at the building don't film it even from other properties public
[1:50:13.880 --> 1:50:17.280]  you just call Aaron you want to make a video about that showing what happened
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:22.000]  to you and and Robin and put the Herman Cain stuff in yeah yeah it's not just
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:25.240]  that clip on Neil Boerts he's repeated that talking point at like lots of
[1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:31.560]  speeches yeah another pushed him to the forefront of the GOP what they're
[1:50:31.560 --> 1:50:38.200]  offering he's opened up a 20-point lead on closest rival now yeah but it would
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:41.120]  you're saying before it's a no-brainer we've got to look at the Fed they're
[1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:45.520]  behind all this economic sabotage that's been going on and it's time to hold
[1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:48.720]  that part accountable well it's incredible you know they're saying they
[1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:52.800]  want Chris Christie cuz he's obese I mean it's like just anything well he
[1:50:52.800 --> 1:50:56.040]  looks different well he looks different but it's what do they stand for

[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:32.560]  rest of it of the of the taped interview coming up this evening on the

[1:54:40.200 --> 1:54:44.400]  Gerald here in a moment I just want to recap and restate this you cannot
[1:54:44.400 --> 1:54:48.960]  underestimate how big a deal it is that the establishment knew by tracking
[1:54:48.960 --> 1:54:52.080]  everybody's email and listening to people's phones and having computers
[1:54:52.080 --> 1:54:55.800]  collate that that people were about to start rebelling against Wall Street to
[1:54:55.800 --> 1:54:59.600]  then kind of have some of their operatives kick it off then the public
[1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:05.240]  showed up and it became grassroots so they tried to recoopt it and now the
[1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:08.360]  Federal Reserve saying how much they love it and how they're in solidarity with
[1:55:08.360 --> 1:55:15.040]  occupy Wall Street no it's occupy you the Fed that shows how incredibly
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:20.520]  desperate and pathetic they are Aaron seeing quantitative easing among other
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:25.200]  programs really help undermine the base I mean just to recap what we've seen in
[1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:29.040]  terms of the Obama and Bush administration yet Hank Paulson total
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:33.760]  Goldman Sachs insider you got the Larry Summers and Robert Rubin people under
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:36.720]  Clinton and the other administrations and now you've got Timothy Geithner a
[1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:41.000]  Treasury Secretary he was at the New York Federal Reserve and a direct minion of
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:45.440]  Robert Rubin who helped destroy Glass-Steagall Alex so these are the
[1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:49.640]  people in the system they're synonymous with the Federal Reserve are the crooks
[1:55:49.640 --> 1:55:53.120]  that did it and then they're they're up there lecturing Wall Street is some
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:58.680]  general evil yeah and now we're being offered people like Herman Cain of the
[1:55:58.680 --> 1:56:03.760]  Kansas City Federal Reserve is some kind of solution on the right and Obama to
[1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:08.080]  target the middle class and quote rich as some kind of solution on the left you
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:10.960]  know Aaron I know you've got a big I know you've got a big show coming up
[1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:13.560]  tonight on Info Wars nightly news but you ought to just even though you're
[1:56:13.560 --> 1:56:18.880]  hosting it just take that clip of Herman Cain saying come on by drop on by the
[1:56:18.880 --> 1:56:24.160]  Fed I'm your friend dropped by Kansas City and then it shows the people a half
[1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:27.120]  mile away with their guns out saying you know you know with the guns on their
[1:56:27.120 --> 1:56:31.480]  side saying get out of here we're God we're security guards leave just to show
[1:56:31.480 --> 1:56:35.480]  how asinine that is you know go to the you know Herman Cain says the Fed loves
[1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:38.680]  you and you know something like that let's go to a phone call here because
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:42.240]  now people will pay attention to that just shows how full of baloney that guy
[1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:46.040]  is Gerald in Texas thanks for holding her on the air what do you think all
[1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:52.600]  this craziness hey Alex I think it's a great idea to occupy the Fed and I plan
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:57.000]  on being there this evening along with you and other Patriots in Dallas awesome
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:02.920]  awesome my wife I think will also join me but I've got a couple of practical
[1:57:02.920 --> 1:57:10.240]  ideals for the Patriots to maximize media effect unfortunately I'm not gonna
[1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:17.200]  have it in time but I ordered some shredded U.S. fiat currency which you
[1:57:17.200 --> 1:57:21.840]  can order I ordered two five pound bags oh yeah instead of shredding your own
[1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:26.200]  money you can order I did I did that once at a U.S. men I visited you can
[1:57:26.200 --> 1:57:29.640]  order bags of it real cheap and throw it around go ahead exactly we ought to throw
[1:57:29.640 --> 1:57:36.280]  it at the Fed and say we're tired of your fiat worthless money and that's the
[1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:42.040]  first idea the second idea is I just finished watching V for vendetta and in
[1:57:42.040 --> 1:57:49.160]  that you know V he wears a mask of guy folks I think if we could obtain a large
[1:57:49.160 --> 1:57:54.960]  number of Ron Paul mask that all the Patriots that believe along with Ron
[1:57:54.960 --> 1:58:00.000]  Paul that the Fed should be ended they ought to wear those to these events and
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:05.760]  can you imagine the nightmare of the enemy looking outside and seeing how
[1:58:05.760 --> 1:58:11.880]  listen to all that's it I'm gonna have Tim Fruget at the info or store we are
[1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:18.160]  definitely gonna get a Ron Paul mask made I'm doing that you're a genius
[1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:23.360]  anything else sir the profits could even go into the Ron Paul campaign to get
[1:58:23.360 --> 1:58:28.440]  him elected in 2012 sure but regardless down the road that image of Ron Paul
[1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:31.400]  he's gonna be part of history now that's it and we ought to make George
[1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:36.400]  Washington ones too and of course we already have the Max Kaiser action
[1:58:36.400 --> 1:58:41.600]  figure alright sir great points more calls straight ahead stay with us you

[2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:45.520]  into the economy again riding shotgun as my second as they would say if I drop
[2:00:45.520 --> 2:00:52.480]  out is Aaron Dykes Aaron let's go ahead and go to Chris in Texas what we'll
[2:00:52.480 --> 2:00:57.080]  first off what do you think of that idea the Ron Paul mask that that fellow was
[2:00:57.080 --> 2:01:01.800]  talking about that is great instead of some guy Fox guy it's genius Alex and
[2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:05.200]  remember you know I never have caught on how historically accurate is but you
[2:01:05.200 --> 2:01:09.040]  know the Spartacus revolt from the movie where everybody starts saying I am
[2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:13.360]  Spartacus that was really a story they're trying to find out where he is
[2:01:13.360 --> 2:01:15.880]  everybody says I'm Spartacus I'm Spartacus yeah they're out in the
[2:01:15.880 --> 2:01:19.120]  countryside after they've you know Spartacus and the others had the
[2:01:19.120 --> 2:01:25.040]  slave revolt escape from their system of being gladiatorial slaves to the Roman
[2:01:25.040 --> 2:01:29.120]  Empire and they're in the countryside where Spartacus and they all start
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:33.640]  saying I'm all Spartacus that means at least the idea behind it we're all for
[2:01:33.640 --> 2:01:37.840]  freedom none of us are your slaves and Ron Paul is a great symbol of that and I
[2:01:37.840 --> 2:01:42.200]  also wonder when is Ron Paul himself going to start saying Herman Cain is a
[2:01:42.200 --> 2:01:45.720]  fraud he's not the tea partier he's part of the system we're trying to defeat
[2:01:45.720 --> 2:01:50.160]  Alex well Ron Paul turned his guns under pressure because he's such a
[2:01:50.160 --> 2:01:56.280]  gentleman but in this war discretion is not the better part of valor or as one
[2:01:56.280 --> 2:02:02.280]  of Ron Paul's icons that said sometimes silence isn't golden it's yellow and I
[2:02:02.280 --> 2:02:05.560]  must think Ron Paul's been silent he's been a great patriot against Terry had
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:10.280]  great courage but he went after Perry and ran the ads pointing out the Al Gore
[2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:14.360]  cheerleader stuff and the socialist health care he started to go after Romney
[2:02:14.360 --> 2:02:17.840]  it's destroying them both I mean you you attack them doesn't matter how much
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:21.440]  corporate money they get their records are so bad people go these guys both
[2:02:21.440 --> 2:02:26.320]  support carbon taxes they love Al Gore they're the you know they go to
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:30.680]  Bilderberg group it's over and you've got to go after Herman Cain and say you
[2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:34.420]  want a new sales tax on top of the income tax to pay our share to the
[2:02:34.420 --> 2:02:40.560]  bankers you say the Federal Reserve is good you he is the enemy the fee is the
[2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:46.240]  Federal Reserve slick talking candidate I mean Herman Cain is the neo
[2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:51.880]  conversion of Barack Obama and again people are like well he's black I see a
[2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:55.200]  lot of white conservatives maybe he'll fix it you know we've tried with old white
[2:02:55.200 --> 2:02:59.400]  guys and it's like liberals thought that with Obama I actually saw an article
[2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:02.800]  last week where they said well Chris Christie doesn't look presidential you
[2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:06.120]  know he looks like he weighs 500 pounds not against folks that are overweight we
[2:03:06.120 --> 2:03:09.680]  all have been there one time or another at least some of us have the point is
[2:03:09.680 --> 2:03:13.840]  just because somebody looks like grimace from a McDonald's commercial doesn't
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:17.320]  mean he's suddenly gonna be good because he's a fat guy or because he's a black
[2:03:17.320 --> 2:03:22.560]  guy he worked he was at the number two to number three most powerful fed
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:27.360]  position he's CFR I'm sorry Erin go ahead I'm gonna go to the call in a
[2:03:27.360 --> 2:03:31.360]  minute mmm well it's just disgusting it's time to realize that because he had a
[2:03:31.360 --> 2:03:35.920]  lot of extremely well many people who identified a lot of the real problem in
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:41.200]  that Tea Party movement it had a lot of important momentum it was truly grassroots
[2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:46.000]  for many years until it was totally co-opted and just rebranded to steer
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:50.440]  the establishment GOP in a new direction and they're all frauds all of them who
[2:03:50.440 --> 2:03:54.280]  tried to identify with that and now they don't even really associate people like
[2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:58.400]  Ron Paul with the Tea Party which he has every right to say he helped found his
[2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:02.360]  supporters were in fact the ones who founded that movement Alex and right
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:07.120]  and we all have to be Ron Paul show up at the Fed and the other places and say
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:12.440]  we're not your slaves I totally agree yeah and I think really a manifestation of
[2:04:12.440 --> 2:04:17.880]  that become of the V for Vendetta mask is the Tri-cornered hat it means 1776 and
[2:04:17.880 --> 2:04:23.320]  I've talked about 1776 worldwide now I'm seeing books coming out and people

[2:08:05.960 --> 2:08:10.720]  because there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:20.240]  alright my friends we are back live Bob Chapman is waiting in the wings we're
[2:08:20.240 --> 2:08:26.600]  going to momentarily and I promise we're going to Chris and Jason and others
[2:08:26.600 --> 2:08:32.400]  that are patiently holding and I should punch up my computerized phone system
[2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:37.040]  but I scribbled this and I came read my own writing 20 minutes later who's after
[2:08:37.040 --> 2:08:43.240]  Chris there in order Maureen we're gonna go Maureen here in just a moment and
[2:08:43.240 --> 2:08:47.000]  then we'll continue with Bob into the economy but I want to get started with
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:50.480]  Bob Chapman but I know Bob also likes taking calls Bob Chapman what do you
[2:08:50.480 --> 2:08:55.520]  think of our idea to instead of just having Michael Moore and George Soros
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:08:59.840]  try to co-opt the Occupy Wall Street movement and have the head of the
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:03.240]  Federal Reserve Bernanke the head of the Dallas Fed we're about to demonstrate
[2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:07.240]  against here in a few hours come out and say he's in solidarity and supports
[2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:12.440]  Occupy Wall Street and they need to raise taxes on rich people which they
[2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:17.440]  mean middle-class and pay it in banker bailouts to him I mean this is incredibly
[2:09:17.440 --> 2:09:22.000]  transparent and I see it as a desperate move that Obama is trying to lick the
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:26.840]  boots of Occupy Wall Street and Rand Paul says they want to whip it in to not a
[2:09:26.840 --> 2:09:32.720]  1776 revolution like we had but kind of a French Revolution while George Soros
[2:09:32.720 --> 2:09:36.600]  sits off shore and sees some color revolution where people run around
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:40.600]  blaming capitalism for what's happened when we've had the opposite under the
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:49.600]  Federal Reserve well how about the financing yes all the money coming from
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:54.280]  that's another good question what's your overall view on the Occupy Wall Street
[2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:58.560]  phenomenon and what's happening in the deteriorating markets and our idea to
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:03.560]  try to shift this over to the real enemy the Fed well the original ideas were
[2:10:03.560 --> 2:10:09.720]  good and then all of a sudden we find out we have a group of retreads from the
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:16.800]  60s and 70s who are socialists and Marxist etc and you know the kind of
[2:10:16.800 --> 2:10:22.680]  money that they have is large and so was George Soros responsible for that
[2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:27.120]  probably move on no no they admit move on and Soros are involved at some levels
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:31.000]  they're trying to take it over but my point is watching all these Federal
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:35.240]  Reserve people and the president act like they're fighting corruption Wall
[2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:40.480]  Street I mean this is like Hitler running the Nuremberg trials exactly you
[2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:47.800]  know I think the idea really should be and I think the opportunity is there is
[2:10:47.800 --> 2:10:56.360]  to neutralize this movement and I saw in the films I've seen that there are a
[2:10:56.360 --> 2:11:02.840]  number of people who are not socialists and further to the left and some of them
[2:11:02.840 --> 2:11:06.720]  are complainants that have lost their jobs and their businesses and so on and
[2:11:06.720 --> 2:11:12.480]  that's understandable and then you have people espousing the same things that you
[2:11:12.480 --> 2:11:21.280]  are on radio and I am and others about the real way to go on this the the
[2:11:21.280 --> 2:11:26.600]  exposition of what they put forward as their answers looks like it was written
[2:11:26.600 --> 2:11:31.840]  by Karl Marx I mean I can't believe they were dumb enough to do that that is the
[2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:37.600]  people who have usurped the movement and now we have other conservative people
[2:11:37.600 --> 2:11:43.160]  moving in and telling a different story and I think if more middle of the road
[2:11:43.160 --> 2:11:49.320]  and conservative people were to attend I think they could neutralize and perhaps
[2:11:49.320 --> 2:11:54.680]  even take over the movement that's in motion no that's the answer I've seen
[2:11:54.680 --> 2:12:01.120]  some people criticize activist like mr. Penzella who have gone out there to try
[2:12:01.120 --> 2:12:04.920]  to wake up some of the socialists and people are saying don't hang around with
[2:12:04.920 --> 2:12:08.560]  those people well number one we've had reporters all over it's a very diverse
[2:12:08.560 --> 2:12:13.000]  group what's happening is the mainstream media is skewing who they interview to
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:16.920]  make it look like it's a bunch of Michael Moore capitalism is the problem
[2:12:16.920 --> 2:12:21.120]  people and now there's a full attempt by Obama and the rest of them to take it
[2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:25.760]  over but it's a desperate attempt and that's why we're shifting to occupy the
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:30.440]  Fed Bob and it's wildly successful I know you track the news all over the
[2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:33.960]  country people are already by the hundreds going and demonstrating and
[2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:37.440]  staying at the Federal Reserve and it's getting huge attention and so the
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:40.520]  Federal Reserve had here in Dallas this morning where I'm about to be
[2:12:40.520 --> 2:12:44.760]  demonstrating in a few hours came out and said I'm with you I agree it's bad but
[2:12:44.760 --> 2:12:49.160]  didn't say Federal Reserve and the crony insiders he said Wall Street I mean
[2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:53.040]  what a joke you've got the Federal Reserve that represents the big six
[2:12:53.040 --> 2:12:57.480]  megabanks and the SEC that preys on the rest of real Wall Street and free
[2:12:57.480 --> 2:13:02.240]  market up here now lecturing us and saying you know he's with the protesters
[2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:06.440]  that is a desperate desperate attempt to say you know if you can't beat them
[2:13:06.440 --> 2:13:12.840]  join them well I think the long-term view of the we'll call them socialists and
[2:13:12.840 --> 2:13:21.160]  they're apparatus apparatus are I think the direction they were going in it was
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:27.960]  to have these demonstrations throughout the country and I think that eventually
[2:13:27.960 --> 2:13:32.200]  what they wanted to have was confrontation with law enforcement
[2:13:32.200 --> 2:13:39.360]  the violence and that would give the administration the opportunity to bring
[2:13:39.360 --> 2:13:44.000]  in martial law and I'm guessing but I think that's where they want to go with
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:47.640]  this thing and we've got to stop them from doing that we don't want violence in
[2:13:47.640 --> 2:13:53.880]  America we want to use the system and Rand Paul system you lose everything
[2:13:53.880 --> 2:13:58.240]  well Rand Paul concurs with you our articles linked up at drudge report
[2:13:58.240 --> 2:14:02.640]  right now where Rand Paul said the you know a lot of these groups remind him
[2:14:02.640 --> 2:14:07.240]  of the French mobs and the French Revolution that I was alluding to earlier
[2:14:07.240 --> 2:14:14.840]  and that Obama endorsing the socialist angle of it is going to embolden people
[2:14:14.840 --> 2:14:18.680]  to violence and that's the last thing we want and you've got this North Carolina
[2:14:18.680 --> 2:14:22.760]  Democratic governor saying suspend elections during the crisis turns out
[2:14:22.760 --> 2:14:26.960]  that was serious you've got all this other talk about it talk about Obama
[2:14:26.960 --> 2:14:31.520]  stepping down by Democratic apparatchiks to use your term like the
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:39.160]  Washington Post what does that signal to you Bob Chapman well I think that what
[2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:44.560]  it signals is that they think they're going to be able to move this movement
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:50.400]  forward and they're hoping nobody's paying any attention to who the players
[2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:59.280]  are behind the scenes and I have a report which I sent to you some 24 pages
[2:14:59.280 --> 2:15:03.960]  of the backgrounds of some of these people but when I first looked I saw
[2:15:03.960 --> 2:15:11.680]  Bill Ayers and I remember him you know in the streets in 1960 and 70s and when I
[2:15:11.680 --> 2:15:16.720]  saw that those kind of people involved I knew it wasn't what it seemed to be but
[2:15:16.720 --> 2:15:24.360]  when you the Washington Post is a functioning information instrument of
[2:15:24.360 --> 2:15:32.920]  the CFR etc and you watch them and they'll tell you which direction they'd
[2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:38.880]  like this thing to go well there's two ways to look at it the system is
[2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:43.840]  endorsing it to try to act like their friends with it or they're doing it to
[2:15:43.840 --> 2:15:48.080]  try to supercharge it and try to steer it and I think it's basically a mix of
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:53.440]  both Bob I want to go to some phone calls here right now for folks that have
[2:15:53.440 --> 2:15:56.840]  been patiently holding but I want to bring in the wildcard Aaron Dykes is
[2:15:56.840 --> 2:16:00.600]  riding shotgun with us today Aaron do you have any angles or points you'd like to
[2:16:00.600 --> 2:16:05.240]  raise or questions for Bob I'm just excited that we're continuing to focus
[2:16:05.240 --> 2:16:09.120]  on the Federal Reserve and it's just very interesting the way they've begun
[2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:13.240]  to speak out I think it's preemptive to knowing your action was coming and that
[2:16:13.240 --> 2:16:16.760]  so many of these Occupy Wall Street groups were already starting to focus on
[2:16:16.760 --> 2:16:20.640]  the Federal Reserve and as you mentioned they have not reported that in the media
[2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:26.120]  I think that continues to be significant you're absolutely right on that point
[2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:40.600]  let's go to Alex hey buddy this is Chris my horse will voice from camping in
[2:16:40.600 --> 2:16:44.480]  the Fed all day yesterday but this is Chris from San Antonio I'm reporting on
[2:16:44.480 --> 2:16:48.040]  the Occupy movement on behalf of Matthew Medina we from We Are Changed
[2:16:48.040 --> 2:16:51.880]  San Antonio we had a great day of unity while we were protesting in the Fed
[2:16:51.880 --> 2:16:57.280]  yesterday we were out there all day with Cody Harris and Matthew Medina we had a
[2:16:57.280 --> 2:17:02.480]  huge banner identifying the real enemies being the Fed we have we marched all
[2:17:02.480 --> 2:17:06.720]  through the city ended up around the federal building circled it several
[2:17:06.720 --> 2:17:11.040]  times we're all in their grill I mean I had a ten foot tall Ron Paul signed I
[2:17:11.040 --> 2:17:14.320]  was holding up to the second story windows you can imagine the fear that
[2:17:14.320 --> 2:17:18.960]  brought in the in the banker's face is that window I mean it was just
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:21.400]  wonderful and I just got so many things I want to tell you I want to make it
[2:17:21.400 --> 2:17:25.200]  quick though but I tell you that it's really a wonderful thing that's going
[2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:30.440]  down there it's very unified the city is behind this 100% the cops aren't
[2:17:30.440 --> 2:17:35.400]  snickering at us they're smiling at us more than that there I mean the cops
[2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:38.800]  know the fellow reserves the problem again is the names of fraud it's private
[2:17:38.800 --> 2:17:44.360]  but also they've been told to leave you alone the cops in New York were paid by
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:50.000]  Jake Morgan for me the night before they directed Occupy Wall Street onto the
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:54.280]  Brooklyn Bridge we have video of this this is admitted to create an event
[2:17:54.280 --> 2:17:57.880]  they beat the people up it's not just that the cops have been given a green
[2:17:57.880 --> 2:18:01.280]  light to beat people up it's that some of the demonstrators were told to be
[2:18:01.280 --> 2:18:05.520]  provocative so it would get attention they don't want these federal reserve
[2:18:05.520 --> 2:18:10.320]  protests to get attention that's why when I'm at the Fed the police are very
[2:18:10.320 --> 2:18:15.160]  nice unless you're there by yourself in the case of the Kansas City Fed where
[2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:18.880]  the guys were there shot video traveled a half mile away to a hilltop to a city
[2:18:18.880 --> 2:18:23.200]  park to videotape it they drove in a car and came there with their guns and said
[2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:26.000]  show us your license but you're a private security guard show it put their
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:29.520]  hands on it so it's kind of like a hold up basically was it was official
[2:18:29.520 --> 2:18:33.320]  oppression outside the law impersonating an officer whatever you want to call it
[2:18:33.320 --> 2:18:38.920]  and did a I guess kind of a fake citizens arrest and said now leave and the
[2:18:38.920 --> 2:18:43.200]  guys you know didn't want to get a cause a bigger confrontation so they did but
[2:18:43.200 --> 2:18:48.680]  that was because they were alone so so again the enemy wants to play friendly
[2:18:48.680 --> 2:18:52.560]  right now I'm not saying the cops are bad but very exciting and of course I'm
[2:18:52.560 --> 2:18:56.120]  going to be in San Antonio Sunday at 10 a.m. at the private fellow reserve
[2:18:56.120 --> 2:19:01.400]  building any comments or questions for Bob Chapman not necessarily for Bob I
[2:19:01.400 --> 2:19:04.000]  want to tell you that we are looking forward we're trying to really get the

[2:19:10.440 --> 2:19:13.680]  this occupied movement we are aware of the co-opters we're very aware of it
[2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:17.840]  we've already identified the move on guys that came in there they're not
[2:19:17.840 --> 2:19:21.560]  making very good grounds though I mean we are educated to this and when we
[2:19:21.560 --> 2:19:25.360]  identify them we point them out they're not exceeding in co-op what do they do
[2:19:25.360 --> 2:19:33.040]  they show up and just go get rid of the ridge I mean what do they say how do
[2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:36.960]  you identify them well they try to pick people off individually they'll pull them
[2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:41.320]  off to the side and ask them I don't want you to move on and you know talking all
[2:19:41.320 --> 2:19:45.640]  this stuff you know I can't verify that hold on I want to hear more of this well
[2:19:45.640 --> 2:19:49.000]  no they admit the move on people have been sent in stay there we're gonna come
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:52.240]  back and Bob Chapman's take on this see that's when I'm getting Bob all over the

[2:26:03.440 --> 2:26:07.320]  there three four hours I'm asking people to stay there in and around it off and
[2:26:07.320 --> 2:26:10.840]  on as much as they can from around the country as I travel to other sites to
[2:26:10.840 --> 2:26:14.880]  draw attention to the real monetary problem that's destroying your future as
[2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:18.640]  well police so I'll be getting off air here when we go to this G. Eber Griffith
[2:26:18.640 --> 2:26:26.280]  interview and I will call the police and check in with them but they know full
[2:26:26.280 --> 2:26:29.480]  well you know they did the same thing but the army leaked this to us and others
[2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:33.920]  three years ago they sent the army out and in the mid in the memo they said
[2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:38.680]  don't let them know your army they may attack you you know it's like it's like
[2:26:38.680 --> 2:26:43.480]  don't talk to that neighbor they may kill you it's a way to demonize so no
[2:26:43.480 --> 2:26:48.600]  we're not gonna be violent are you gonna be no the answer is no because you
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:53.840]  don't want attention brought on to the mafia bosses we understand that if it
[2:26:53.840 --> 2:26:58.680]  was a Soros operation and we were dupes you'd crack our heads to get attention
[2:26:58.680 --> 2:27:02.440]  but you wouldn't know that you're compartmentalized you wouldn't know why
[2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:06.280]  you were told to crack heads and follow orders so you've been told to bring us
[2:27:06.280 --> 2:27:12.040]  probably ice tea on silver platters haven't you that's why okay because this
[2:27:12.040 --> 2:27:16.640]  is the real enemy here okay we're targeting the criminals but I want them
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:22.800]  brought to justice through the law okay and we're identifying them so Lynch mob
[2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:27.360]  coming here today my entire history is nonviolent and you know it you know it
[2:27:27.360 --> 2:27:30.640]  you know it but we got a clip of the Austin police chief sitting wants to
[2:27:30.640 --> 2:27:33.800]  come on the show I don't know we'll have time to get that I had the guys on by a
[2:27:33.800 --> 2:27:38.400]  Austin thing Bob Chapman what do you think of this latest development well I
[2:27:38.400 --> 2:27:45.880]  think that it's intimidation as usual and trying to see if you'll go out there
[2:27:45.880 --> 2:27:49.800]  and do the kind of things they can beat your heads in for and of course you're
[2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:54.520]  not going to do that and they're trying to take it one step forward and try to
[2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:59.560]  show you that they're in control and that's okay you just do what you're
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:07.960]  going to do and just say well yeah cuz it's called the first amendment yeah
[2:28:07.960 --> 2:28:11.800]  they want to call up and see if they can scare me all that does is make me just
[2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:17.440]  wish I was doing this even more I'm not giving into this anymore Bob I don't
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:21.920]  think any of us shouldn't that's why people should be considering joining
[2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:28.280]  these occupy Wall Street groups and saying look that's not right we shouldn't
[2:28:28.280 --> 2:28:33.240]  be asking for those kind of changes these are the kind of changes we need
[2:28:33.240 --> 2:28:38.160]  let's stop start with getting rid of the Federal Reserve I mean they've been
[2:28:38.160 --> 2:28:43.160]  looting us for a hundred years and I mean we're there I mean the system can't
[2:28:43.160 --> 2:28:46.640]  believe we're actually looking past the puppets now and going right to the
[2:28:46.640 --> 2:28:54.720]  actual criminals and we're actually what we're trying to also go forward to
[2:28:54.720 --> 2:29:02.240]  identify what they're really after here down the road and I think that to me is
[2:29:02.240 --> 2:29:08.240]  violence and a martial law well I've had cops call me before demonstrations
[2:29:08.240 --> 2:29:11.600]  before just to say hey we just want to know where you're what your route is
[2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:15.200]  and what roads we need a block of any and want you to stay on the sidewalk you
[2:29:15.200 --> 2:29:18.440]  understand blah blah blah that's fine I don't get mad at that when they call it
[2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:22.120]  going you're not planning anything violent are you that's like calling them
[2:29:22.120 --> 2:29:25.040]  up and going you're not you're not planning to sell methamphetamine on the
[2:29:25.040 --> 2:29:29.120]  side of the street are you know it's just a way to demonize psychologically I

[2:33:18.640 --> 2:33:22.240]  because previously I was gonna stay in Austin do the first few hours the radio
[2:33:22.240 --> 2:33:27.840]  show drive up to the event but then my mother called and pointed out you know
[2:33:27.840 --> 2:33:31.520]  it's Texas OU weekend there'll be a lot of traffic on I-35 so we went ahead and
[2:33:31.520 --> 2:33:34.680]  came up the night before but I'm looking out of the traffic here downtown
[2:33:34.680 --> 2:33:39.920]  there's really nothing so everybody get in here this evening and yes we're gonna
[2:33:39.920 --> 2:33:45.280]  be peaceful and nice we're gonna draw media attention as Dalasites and Texans
[2:33:45.280 --> 2:33:50.040]  did yesterday to the private Federal Reserve as Texans did in San Antonio as
[2:33:50.040 --> 2:33:55.680]  Bostonians did in Boston as New Yorkers did in New York and we're gonna draw
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:33:58.800]  attention to these guys and point out there the people running the show the
[2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:03.080]  insiders that get to create the money and use it for themselves and then put
[2:34:03.080 --> 2:34:08.880]  us into debt nationally for money they get it's incredible now I wanted to
[2:34:08.880 --> 2:34:12.000]  finish up with Chris and Texas with Bob Chapman and then go to Marine and
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:15.560]  Jason and that's it cuz I got to go to this G ever Griffin interview and then
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:19.240]  Aaron will take us out of the show here and I'll see you all tonight and in
[2:34:19.240 --> 2:34:22.360]  full works nightly news that Aaron's gonna be hosting but we'll have reports
[2:34:22.360 --> 2:34:25.720]  on there perhaps even live from the ground we'll we'll see what happens to
[2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:30.040]  this evening we couldn't do this by the way without the dedication of our
[2:34:30.040 --> 2:34:33.680]  incredible job they're doing and you the listeners that buy the books the
[2:34:33.680 --> 2:34:37.800]  videos the DVDs the prison planet dot TV memberships you are supporting this
[2:34:37.800 --> 2:34:41.880]  finishing up Chris down in San Antonio what do you think of the you're saying
[2:34:41.880 --> 2:34:45.160]  the cops are real nice to you in San Antonio we went to break and I found
[2:34:45.160 --> 2:34:48.400]  out the Dallas police are calling our office a whole bunch of different ones
[2:34:48.400 --> 2:34:52.320]  lieutenants sergeants people call themselves the chief we've got the head
[2:34:52.320 --> 2:34:56.720]  of the Dallas Federal Reserve saying he loves us now or whatever so they're
[2:34:56.720 --> 2:35:01.720]  definitely definitely circling the wagons I guess for the bright lights of
[2:35:01.720 --> 2:35:05.840]  publicity you know I I believe the pen is mightier than the sword and they've
[2:35:05.840 --> 2:35:12.120]  profiled Alejandro Jones they know this isn't why well what's coming tonight
[2:35:12.120 --> 2:35:17.760]  unless they're very provocateurs I think we must be scared of you we'll see how
[2:35:17.760 --> 2:35:21.360]  they act Sunday when you get down here because you know I'm not saying so much
[2:35:21.360 --> 2:35:25.520]  that they were super nice to us but you know you can just they weren't being
[2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:29.040]  negative and maybe they did the Dallas cops here three years ago really nice
[2:35:29.040 --> 2:35:32.400]  they told us they agree with us and so that's that's fine this is the
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:37.080]  politician cops that are calling us what do you think about this though the
[2:35:37.080 --> 2:35:41.080]  city council and the park police have given us permission to occupy in the
[2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:46.480]  park downtown and to literally set up camp and stay there indefinitely until
[2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:49.680]  again they're giving you permission because you always had it under the
[2:35:49.680 --> 2:35:53.840]  First Amendment and they've been told by the establishment revolutions come in
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:59.360]  you better play nice see the the red coat started cracking heads in 1775 and
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:03.360]  the years before that and it resulted in the real deal so they're trying to
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:07.400]  screw us right now but act friendly great points I look forward to seeing you
[2:36:07.400 --> 2:36:11.360]  Sunday down there 10 a.m. to noon and I hope you guys occupy down there that's
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:17.120]  wonderful Bob Chapman what do you think of that I think the best thing to do is
[2:36:17.120 --> 2:36:24.200]  be gentlemen and ladies and just expound the truth and stay with well within the
[2:36:24.200 --> 2:36:29.440]  confines of the law and every time they look at you give them a big smile yeah
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:33.680]  I'm not even worried about that point I I'm quite frankly there are always will
[2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:38.360]  be some provocateurs but whatever I love it that means we're winning when they
[2:36:38.360 --> 2:36:45.080]  resort to that okay let's go to Maureen in I guess that's Virginia thank you
[2:36:45.080 --> 2:36:48.080]  for holding so long we've got a lot of breaking news welcome to the airwaves
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:54.080]  thank you I can now understand why our savior used a whip on the money
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:36:59.400]  changers I would like to do the same but that's not okay oh yeah that's al-Qaeda
[2:36:59.400 --> 2:37:05.440]  of course anyway do you know who Lewis T. McFadden was the congressman that was
[2:37:05.440 --> 2:37:15.080]  murdered after he gave us H. J. R. 192 in public law 73 yes okay I've got a feeling
[2:37:15.080 --> 2:37:20.880]  we need to use what he gave us to get rid of the national debt our bodies have
[2:37:20.880 --> 2:37:27.240]  been monetized the way to get rid of the national debt it is owed to us the
[2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:33.800]  people when we were born they turned us into all capital letter corporations and
[2:37:33.800 --> 2:37:38.760]  they printed up federal reserve notes with the same numbers as are on the back
[2:37:38.760 --> 2:37:44.080]  of our social security numbers well they do monetize us we do pledge our our
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:48.600]  bodies and our tax money to fund their whole system you know for those that
[2:37:48.600 --> 2:37:51.760]  haven't really read the Bible Christ wasn't going after the priests for
[2:37:51.760 --> 2:37:56.720]  selling pigeons for sacrifice he was going after him because they made you
[2:37:56.720 --> 2:38:01.040]  buy a special coin that was in limited circulation for like 20 times what it
[2:38:01.040 --> 2:38:04.800]  was worth you had to buy that coin to then buy a sacrifice whether it was a
[2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:09.920]  lamb whatever the case was and that was a form of money manipulation and he
[2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:14.160]  went in and turned over the tables and beat him but nowadays the Dallas police
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:17.480]  would you know what they do to Jesus because he's bad I guess but we're not
[2:38:17.480 --> 2:38:24.880]  doing that here we're just identifying where the den of Viper's any other
[2:38:24.880 --> 2:38:30.080]  comments on that ma'am yeah if anybody listening knows about the original
[2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:36.680]  13th amendment which basically was stolen I know they got one archived in
[2:38:36.680 --> 2:38:42.800]  Richmond Virginia basically it said no one with the title of nobility meaning
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:50.120]  Esquire meaning lawyer can hold any office in this government that would
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:54.480]  take care of a whole lot that's actually it's in the Constitution I forget the
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:38:58.000]  section that I've read it on air before that you can't serve a foreign power
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:02.080]  take a foreign title when you're in the executive branch that's why Obama
[2:39:02.080 --> 2:39:06.320]  becoming the head of the UN Security Council a few years ago was such a big
[2:39:06.320 --> 2:39:10.920]  deal it violates article 1 section 9 I'm going from memory here Bob what
[2:39:10.920 --> 2:39:17.800]  section is that don't ask me I'm old I can't remember I know it's on the back
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:22.400]  of my a folder public DVD great points ma'am good to hear from you comments on
[2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:26.320]  what she's bringing up about Christ and the money changers Bob well I think it's
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:34.280]  a good point and I think that people have to look within the whole situation
[2:39:34.280 --> 2:39:39.080]  in order to identify really what it's all about not only the case of the money
[2:39:39.080 --> 2:39:43.360]  changes but all of the things who were talking about what is subliminally
[2:39:43.360 --> 2:39:49.600]  underneath all of this where is this headed where are they trying to take it
[2:39:49.600 --> 2:39:55.440]  notice though the people Christ was fighting 2000 plus years ago the people
[2:39:55.440 --> 2:39:59.160]  George Washington was fighting the people Andrew Jackson was fighting the
[2:39:59.160 --> 2:40:06.240]  people Lewis T McFadden and and in Limburg were fighting is the very same
[2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:14.880]  type of system today absolutely and you know to an extent it's the same cast of
[2:40:14.880 --> 2:40:20.760]  characters in families and they've evolved through the centuries and that's
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:25.400]  one of the things that most people don't know nor understand that this is really
[2:40:25.400 --> 2:40:30.520]  nothing new and now that we know how they did it before when they was
[2:40:30.520 --> 2:40:34.880]  successful or unsuccessful we can use that to stop but that's exactly what
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:39.360]  you're doing well that's the secret the globalists do study history and they
[2:40:39.360 --> 2:40:43.080]  they hope we don't ever look at it because then the whole blueprint of how
[2:40:43.080 --> 2:40:49.160]  humans operate is right there you get the playbook exactly and and you know I
[2:40:49.160 --> 2:40:54.760]  repeat this over and over again you and I and people like us need help and
[2:40:54.760 --> 2:40:59.440]  informing people of really what's going on and so the people who are going to
[2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:03.840]  become engaged that and I hope there's lots of them they should study history
[2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:08.000]  because it's very very important and very very interesting and entertaining as
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:12.360]  well in a horrific way sometimes final comments from Aaron Dykes is we're going
[2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:16.640]  to talk to Jason for like a minute and then go to the G ever griffin thing and
[2:41:16.640 --> 2:41:20.560]  then Aaron will take us out at the very end of the show today but most of the
[2:41:20.560 --> 2:41:23.400]  segments left in the next segment will be the G ever griffin interview in the
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:27.720]  second on air part tonight 7 p.m. Central will be at the end of the show on
[2:41:27.720 --> 2:41:31.480]  info works not only news at prisonplanet.tv but any closing comments on
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:35.760]  money changers and what we were just talking about Aaron yeah Alex it is a
[2:41:35.760 --> 2:41:39.880]  larger system and I think the important thing today with Occupy the Federal
[2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:44.800]  Reserve is an education opportunity it's a very good sign that many of the Occupy
[2:41:44.800 --> 2:41:48.360]  Wall Streeters whatever their original reason for going down there is are
[2:41:48.360 --> 2:41:52.480]  associating with the Federal Reserve people but even if they are on the far
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:56.880]  left or whatever side it's important to educate them that the Federal Reserve was
[2:41:56.880 --> 2:42:00.720]  the sort of wicked instrument of the bailout they were the ones who absorbed
[2:42:00.720 --> 2:42:05.400]  secret trillions on their balanced street sheets secretly gave to foreign
[2:42:05.400 --> 2:42:09.160]  banks and it took people on the far left like Bernie Sanders to call up
[2:42:09.160 --> 2:42:13.600]  Bernanke who had the audacity to say no Congress has no right to know on the
[2:42:13.600 --> 2:42:17.680]  floor of the House and everything or the Senate rather and I think we need to
[2:42:17.680 --> 2:42:21.560]  remind them of that as they roll out the predictable intimidation tactics
[2:42:21.560 --> 2:42:25.840]  because of course the pen is mightier than the sword and that's why they've
[2:42:25.840 --> 2:42:30.280]  used platforms like Facebook and Twitter in the Arab Spring but if you use it for
[2:42:30.280 --> 2:42:33.720]  the Federal Reserve to educate people there that's why they're cracking down
[2:42:33.720 --> 2:42:37.480]  profiling key bloggers and that's why they're calling up people like Alex Jones
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:40.640]  when they want to go down physically to the Federal Reserve and send a message
[2:42:40.640 --> 2:42:44.720]  well I'll say this we are nonviolent because that's the best way we are
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:48.040]  trying to educate people and I call the police I'll call them back after the
[2:42:48.040 --> 2:42:51.680]  show ends here in a few minutes and then talk to them we're here to be educational
[2:42:51.680 --> 2:42:57.320]  but the only time Christ ever got violent in his whole life was with the
[2:42:57.320 --> 2:43:01.320]  bankers with the money changers with the manipulators and he turned over tables
[2:43:01.320 --> 2:43:08.480]  and beat them in just a energetic rampage with a cat or nine tail beat them
[2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:12.920]  with a whip with a rope I mean what does that tell you right there if you're a
[2:43:12.920 --> 2:43:17.760]  Christian I mean this this is the evil this is the parasitic system this is
[2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:23.920]  the this is it this is the enemy not capitalism and free market and property
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:29.760]  rights it's just incredible what they've turned us into in closing your
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:35.040]  tail gunner Jason in Texas go ahead sir hey how's it going today good thanks
[2:43:35.040 --> 2:43:39.520]  for holding sir welcome all right I got one comment I'm going to Dallas I'm

[2:45:26.920 --> 2:45:30.160]  you we're all doing this together and believe me the system is scared right
[2:45:30.160 --> 2:45:33.840]  now the head of the Dallas Fed has responded and is trying to grovel and
[2:45:33.840 --> 2:45:37.920]  you know say he comes in peace which we know they don't well we do come in
[2:45:37.920 --> 2:45:42.240]  peace to expose you so the legal system of our awakened countrymen can bring
[2:45:42.240 --> 2:45:46.680]  them to justice and of course I'll give them abstention as well I mean if they
[2:45:46.680 --> 2:45:52.120]  want to go to abstention and you know be sent like a Napoleon to the islands or
[2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:55.640]  something after they've been convicted that's fine too you know through history
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:45:58.880]  people always done things like that because it's not good to corner rats we
[2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:02.440]  just want our republic back and we don't want you to carry out your eugenics
[2:46:02.440 --> 2:46:06.120]  implosion of the entire world we won't get to most of this interview even much
[2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:09.520]  of it now this is part of part one that's 20 minutes long we'll air never
[2:46:09.520 --> 2:46:13.480]  before seen part two tonight with Aaron Dyke's hosting in force not only knows
[2:46:13.480 --> 2:46:16.080]  but here's five minutes of it going to break we'll come back with a little bit
[2:46:16.080 --> 2:46:19.520]  more on the other side and then Aaron will take us out of here I'll see you
[2:46:19.520 --> 2:46:22.800]  tonight at the Dallas Federal Reserve and Federal Reserve locations across the
[2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:27.680]  country I'm Alex Jones signing off from the front lines of the Info War but we
[2:46:27.680 --> 2:46:31.760]  are joined now by G. Albert Griffin sir thank you for being with us thank you
[2:46:31.760 --> 2:46:35.280]  Alex thanks for inviting me now you don't need any introduction but you're
[2:46:35.280 --> 2:46:38.760]  the best-selling author of the creation from Jekyll Island for close to 50 years
[2:46:38.760 --> 2:46:42.800]  you've been exposing the private banking cartel and I can't think of anybody out
[2:46:42.800 --> 2:46:47.160]  there who explains the pressure from above pressure from below system people
[2:46:47.160 --> 2:46:52.280]  ask me why would elite bankers why would they support communist why would they
[2:46:52.280 --> 2:46:55.840]  support socialists why would they support collectivism and we see move on
[2:46:55.840 --> 2:47:01.120]  dot org the White House all Wall Street finance Soros financed pumping millions
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:06.440]  into co-opting the Occupy Wall Street movement that's why I'm calling for an
[2:47:06.440 --> 2:47:10.960]  Occupy the Fed and so I want to get your view on that idea and if you think
[2:47:10.960 --> 2:47:14.960]  that's a good one then I want to segue into what Carol quickly and others wrote
[2:47:14.960 --> 2:47:19.240]  about you made films about this pressure from above and below why do we see so
[2:47:19.240 --> 2:47:24.480]  many billionaires supporting collectivism G. Albert Griffin well you
[2:47:24.480 --> 2:47:27.960]  really raised a good point there Alex because there's a tremendous amount of
[2:47:27.960 --> 2:47:35.720]  confusion today between having a lot of money and being wealthy and being a
[2:47:35.720 --> 2:47:41.400]  capitalist those words need to be defined don't they capitalism does not
[2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:46.560]  necessarily mean that you're not a socialist well we have today let's cut
[2:47:46.560 --> 2:47:50.360]  to the chase is that we have a lot of very wealthy socialists in the world a
[2:47:50.360 --> 2:47:56.240]  lot of very wealthy collectivists and the old definition of capitalism was
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:47:59.880]  more accurate than the new one the new definition of capitalism is or a
[2:47:59.880 --> 2:48:02.920]  capitalist is anybody with a lot of money and that's not doesn't cover it at
[2:48:02.920 --> 2:48:06.680]  all because the wealthiest people in the world today are not free enterprise
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:11.160]  capitalists their monopoly capitalists you need to make that distinction people
[2:48:11.160 --> 2:48:15.360]  make their money today in the world not by free enterprise competition not by
[2:48:15.360 --> 2:48:19.560]  producing a better product at a better price or anything like that they make
[2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:24.560]  their money today by buying politicians and buying political favoritism and
[2:48:24.560 --> 2:48:29.480]  sending their lobbyists into the power centers of the legislative power centers
[2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:33.080]  of whatever governments there are in the world and getting them to pass special
[2:48:33.080 --> 2:48:39.480]  laws that favor them money today is made the great wealth today is made by
[2:48:39.480 --> 2:48:44.920]  political maneuvering and favoritism and that is not capitalism so when people
[2:48:44.920 --> 2:48:48.800]  go out there and they say our crisis today in the banking system proves that
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:53.400]  capitalism doesn't work there they don't understand any of this at all they
[2:48:53.400 --> 2:48:57.960]  they're still thinking that capitalism is the same as well so you're right on
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:49:02.840]  target I think especially when you want to emphasize that we need to occupy not
[2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:08.360]  Wall Street what is that Wall Street is a physical location it's where a lot of
[2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:12.720]  brokerage houses ours where the banks are centered but the real problem is the
[2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:17.840]  federal reserve system that's the problem it's a monopoly it's a cartel
[2:49:17.840 --> 2:49:22.140]  that's been given this monopolistic power by Congress and it's a perfect
[2:49:22.140 --> 2:49:26.920]  example of what I'm talking about it's this marriage between corporations and
[2:49:26.920 --> 2:49:31.760]  government that's not capitalism that is collectivism in its purest form so
[2:49:31.760 --> 2:49:35.720]  when these people say let's overthrow capitalism they missed the point
[2:49:35.720 --> 2:49:40.640]  because capitalism has been gone really totally gone in the sense of the word
[2:49:40.640 --> 2:49:45.400]  that I'm using it been totally gone since World War two well that's my point
[2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:50.400]  exactly jibber that's what I want you to elaborate on is that even Ross Perot
[2:49:50.400 --> 2:49:54.720]  who claims he's free market made the lion share his money selling EDS to the
[2:49:54.720 --> 2:49:59.920]  government you look at all these big fortunes it's the monopoly power of
[2:49:59.920 --> 2:50:03.120]  government and one of the clearest examples is Barack Obama and General
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:07.440]  Electric the head of his economic council they the very day that his new
[2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:13.240]  carbon rules went into effect they were given an exemption and now they're
[2:50:13.240 --> 2:50:16.960]  shutting power plants down all over the country but General Electric can still
[2:50:16.960 --> 2:50:20.960]  operate and their profits are going way up I mean this is so dangerous and it
[2:50:20.960 --> 2:50:26.240]  destroys it destroys progress and then to see the monopoly capitalist using
[2:50:26.240 --> 2:50:30.360]  collectivism to destroy their their competition to consolidate power to see
[2:50:30.360 --> 2:50:33.560]  Michael Moore he's made hundreds of millions of dollars in a so-called free
[2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:37.000]  market system saying capitalism is the problem not the Federal Reserve we have
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:41.840]  a clip of that we played earlier as we went out to break and he's saying that's
[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:45.840]  the problem the problem is capitalism and so people now think monopoly
[2:50:45.840 --> 2:50:50.280]  corruption is capitalism and they're selling them on more collectivism I
[2:50:50.280 --> 2:50:53.960]  mean isn't that just putting our leg in a bigger bear trap because I remember you
[2:50:53.960 --> 2:50:57.720]  decades ago talking

[2:54:09.080 --> 2:54:13.360]  in a so-called free market system saying capitalism is the problem not the
[2:54:13.360 --> 2:54:17.400]  Federal Reserve we have a clip of that we played earlier as we went out to break
[2:54:17.400 --> 2:54:22.040]  and he's saying that's the problem the problem is capitalism and so people now
[2:54:22.040 --> 2:54:26.360]  think monopoly corruption is capitalism and they're selling them on more
[2:54:26.360 --> 2:54:30.320]  collectivism I mean isn't that just putting our leg in a bigger bear trap
[2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:34.760]  because I remember you decades ago talking about this this juncture we've
[2:54:34.760 --> 2:54:39.680]  now entered where when the collectivism causes society to implode the danger is
[2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:44.420]  the establishment will use that as an excuse to sell more of the same as the
[2:54:44.420 --> 2:54:49.760]  solution instead of getting back to true freedom so break that down and and the
[2:54:49.760 --> 2:54:55.400]  choice we have between the monopoly capitalist and true freedom well you've
[2:54:55.400 --> 2:54:59.920]  said it so well Alex all I can do is go over the same ground and I think it does
[2:54:59.920 --> 2:55:04.360]  need to be repeated over and over again because it's foreign to the ears of
[2:55:04.360 --> 2:55:09.520]  most Americans you don't hear this sort of thing on ABC, CBS, NBC and all that
[2:55:09.520 --> 2:55:15.440]  they the major news outlets continue to spew out the same old propaganda about
[2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:19.880]  this is a capitalist system well it's not it's a collectivist system there's not
[2:55:19.880 --> 2:55:24.040]  much difference anymore between the system in America and the system you
[2:55:24.040 --> 2:55:30.680]  find in in red China or in Cuba or in what used to be called the old Soviet
[2:55:30.680 --> 2:55:34.880]  Union or Russia that they have different labels but once you peel off the label
[2:55:34.880 --> 2:55:38.640]  and look down underneath you've got bedrock collectivism everywhere in the
[2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:43.200]  world today and you're quite right when you say that the the advocates of
[2:55:43.200 --> 2:55:48.520]  collectors of collectivism who want more more and more create a boogeyman they
[2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:52.560]  say capitalism is what's causing all this problem let's have more government
[2:55:52.560 --> 2:55:57.240]  intervention let's have more government control let's have more marriage
[2:55:57.240 --> 2:56:03.080]  between corporate and state let's have these private partnership relationships
[2:56:03.080 --> 2:56:07.000]  with the government you know all these things they're advocating as you say more
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  of the same poison that's killing the patient they're advocating that is
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:15.760]  supposed to be the medicine for him and the only real solution is first of all
[2:56:15.760 --> 2:56:19.480]  the American people have to understand this little trick that's being played on
[2:56:19.480 --> 2:56:22.520]  them and then they have to understand well what is the alternative it's
[2:56:22.520 --> 2:56:27.480]  something that you know we haven't seen in America in the lifetime of any of us
[2:56:27.480 --> 2:56:31.480]  living today you have to go back to the history books to find out what the
[2:56:31.480 --> 2:56:35.840]  solution is people say well you don't want to go backwards well moving
[2:56:35.840 --> 2:56:41.400]  backwards in time would be moving forward in ideology would be moving
[2:56:41.400 --> 2:56:46.480]  forward in solutions because we would be moving forward to the idea of a free
[2:56:46.480 --> 2:56:51.160]  market not in bed with the government see the government loves to come in and
[2:56:51.160 --> 2:56:54.760]  say we're going to regulate these industries for you folks for the benefit
[2:56:54.760 --> 2:56:59.440]  of the population you know but what really happens is that the regulators
[2:56:59.440 --> 2:57:03.440]  get into bed with the corporations that are being regulated and then they
[2:57:03.440 --> 2:57:08.440]  become one and the same and so under this umbrella of supposedly regulating
[2:57:08.440 --> 2:57:13.320]  industry and the banks among other things another industry and supposedly
[2:57:13.320 --> 2:57:18.360]  controlling the society on the benefit for the benefit of the people they're
[2:57:18.360 --> 2:57:22.440]  actually just protecting the corporations under that umbrella so we've
[2:57:22.440 --> 2:57:27.080]  got to get this in our brains that this is the reality of today and the only
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:31.480]  solution to this problem is to go forward to where we were about 80 years
[2:57:31.480 --> 2:57:36.880]  ago I mean that literally go forward to where we were 80 or 100 years ago and
[2:57:36.880 --> 2:57:41.920]  get the government out of all of these things go back to a true free enterprise
[2:57:41.920 --> 2:57:46.560]  system where competition is the only thing that will produce the best
[2:57:46.560 --> 2:57:50.400]  products the best service the lowest prices the best amount of freedom for
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:54.840]  the individual and not that it's not with its without problems because of
[2:57:54.840 --> 2:57:58.760]  course it does have problems but those problems are minuscule compared to the
[2:57:58.760 --> 2:58:02.920]  problems that we have today which is the result of government control and
[2:58:02.920 --> 2:58:06.680]  regulations supposedly to protect the people what in fact is to protect the
[2:58:06.680 --> 2:58:14.920]  corporations well very well said historically here's an analogy to you
[2:58:14.920 --> 2:58:19.080]  be added to what you were talking about about going forward to the past okay we
[2:58:19.080 --> 2:58:22.720]  have more of that interview with G ever Griffin tonight on the info wars nightly
