[00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:06.335]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.335 --> 00:00:08.097]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.097 --> 00:00:09.858]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.858 --> 00:00:11.460]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.001]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:17.205]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:21.269]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:29.574]  Top of the morning to you, or top of the afternoon, or wherever you're joining us across the world.
[00:00:29.574 --> 00:00:39.560]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is, obviously, the Alex Jones Radio Show, coming to you live from Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.461]  It, of course, is October 7, 2011, on this Friday edition.
[00:00:46.061 --> 00:01:00.451]  Riding shotgun with me today is Aaron Dykes, contributor to InfoWars Nightly News, and of course, host of the Alex Jones Show in his own right, and one of our great researchers and writers.
[00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:03.172]  He also has worked heavily on our documentary films.
[00:01:03.172 --> 00:01:06.255]  He's going to be riding shotgun with us throughout the day.
[00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:14.580]  Bob Chapman will visit us, as he always does, on Fridays in the third hour to cover all the big economic developments of the week.
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.641]  And looking forward,
[00:01:16.962 --> 00:01:26.292]  Well, if you type in Federal Reserve today, there are hundreds of articles about people all over the United States already occupying the Fed.
[00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:37.441]  A lot of people spontaneously, I guess synchronicity, serendipity, whatever you want to call it, said, yeah, we should be going after the Fed, not just General Wall Street or capitalism's bad.
[00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:39.482]  And it's beautiful to see what's happening.
[00:01:39.482 --> 00:01:42.603]  People are targeting the insider monopoly men.
[00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:46.245]  Drudge Report has a report of the 300 to 600.
[00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:56.349]  Some reports are more Tea Party type folks, along with Occupy Dallas, more liberal people, actually going and marching.
[00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:16.573]  Throughout the day, multiple times, different groups of people at the Dallas Fed, and I've talked to some of the locals, they were spurred by basically the idea that I had Sunday, saying, why don't we just go occupy the Fed instead of this general attack on the entire system.
[00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:23.194]  And I've since learned other groups, weeks ago were spontaneously doing this, but not getting media attention in New York,
[00:02:23.974 --> 00:02:24.434]  I don't know.
[00:02:47.424 --> 00:02:50.547]  Arguably the second or third most powerful regional Fed.
[00:02:50.547 --> 00:02:51.949]  New York's number one.
[00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.751]  Dallas, Kansas City, you can argue, are number two or three respectively.
[00:02:56.038 --> 00:02:58.540]  The one Herman Cain was the head of, that's why he's so high-powered.
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.146]  I mean, they don't put you as the head of the Kansas City Fed unless you're super mobbed up with the New World Order.
[00:03:05.146 --> 00:03:12.993]  The head of the Dallas Fed has come out and said that he has solidarity with Occupy Wall Street.
[00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:17.417]  Ben Bernanke has come out and said he understands why they're upset and has solidarity.
[00:03:17.417 --> 00:03:22.641]  Obama has fully endorsed Occupy Wall Street, but only in an attempt to
[00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:29.328]  Now try to jump over in public opinion to that side to protect themselves.
[00:03:29.328 --> 00:03:37.397]  This is a capitulation to the fact that the public has woken up to them and an attempt to grab victory from the jaws of defeat here.
[00:03:37.397 --> 00:03:40.661]  You've got Obama, Bernanke, the head of the Dallas Fed.
[00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:44.265]  You've got George Soros coming out and saying he loves Occupy Wall Street.
[00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:45.046]  They love
[00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:59.311]  Their attempt to co-opt it and act like they have solidarity when they are representatives of the most corrupt, crony capitalists, monopolistic capitalism, anti-free market elements of Wall Street.
[00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:00.712]  They are represented by that.
[00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:01.892]  They captain that.
[00:04:01.892 --> 00:04:04.473]  They are the generals of this wicked system.
[00:04:04.473 --> 00:04:04.974]  And now,
[00:04:05.974 --> 00:04:23.028]  As they set up world government, as they fully implode the once great West and try to impoverish us, just as they've done in their own official policies in State Department Memorandum 200 and the British Population Commission of 49, their policy is to make you poor so that you're under their control.
[00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:27.552]  They use economic bondage as a control mechanism.
[00:04:27.552 --> 00:04:31.515]  And the fact that they have now come out and said, oh, we endorse Occupy Wall Street,
[00:04:32.316 --> 00:04:40.704]  That is a cold-blooded attempt to A. act like they're with the people, with camouflage, but B. try to co-opt it, as I told you they would do.
[00:04:40.704 --> 00:04:45.288]  Aaron Dykes is going to give us on the other side and more.
[00:04:45.288 --> 00:04:52.154]  Rand Paul has come out, and this is linked to DrudgeReport.com, and said Obama's rhetoric could turn Occupy protest to violent.
[00:04:52.154 --> 00:04:54.356]  That, of course, is an InfoWars.com article.
[00:04:54.356 --> 00:04:56.438]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:56.438 --> 00:04:57.919]  The revolution starts today.
[00:05:00.905 --> 00:05:07.547]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:07.547 --> 00:05:12.709]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:21.432]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:21.432 --> 00:05:25.493]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:25.493 --> 00:05:27.594]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:29.773 --> 00:05:34.517]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:39.581]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:41.723]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:41.723 --> 00:05:43.524]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:43.524 --> 00:05:46.406]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.406 --> 00:05:53.032]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:53.032 --> 00:05:55.734]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:55.734 --> 00:05:58.957]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[00:06:00.385 --> 00:06:03.247]  Steve Shank here with a special alert from eFoods Direct.
[00:06:03.247 --> 00:06:06.389]  The stock market continues to crash and re-crash daily.
[00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.151]  Since July, the market has dropped 15% with no signs of recovery.
[00:06:10.151 --> 00:06:11.292]  What does that mean to you?
[00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:18.116]  When stocks crash, jobs are lost, and you can't buy the food that's already too expensive and continues to raise in cost.
[00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:23.820]  eFoods just got notice that wholesale costs on pasta, rice, and beans will immediately jump 20%.
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.061]  The already high cost of sugar is tripling.
[00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:34.431]  If you invest in the stock market for security or save money in the bank, you continue to see the dollar drop in value while your weekly food bills increase.
[00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:35.553]  So what are you going to do?
[00:06:35.553 --> 00:06:37.495]  Get as much food now as you can.
[00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:43.623]  With these problems you're facing, eFoods Direct has no choice but to extend the free shipping another week to October 9th.
[00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:46.585]  Free shipping buys more food with shipping dollars.
[00:06:46.585 --> 00:06:48.306]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:06:48.306 --> 00:06:49.387]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:06:49.387 --> 00:06:50.608]  You can bet your life on efoods direct.
[00:07:01.035 --> 00:07:16.508]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:07:16.508 --> 00:07:20.191]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:21.195 --> 00:07:33.967]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:07:33.967 --> 00:07:41.233]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:07:41.914 --> 00:07:52.285]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:56.229]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:59.333]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:08:01.929 --> 00:08:08.554]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:11.537]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.245 --> 00:08:22.846]  It is Friday, October 7, 2011.
[00:08:22.846 --> 00:08:34.371]  I'm Alex Jones joining you live from a hotel overlooking the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve branch bank for Region 11.
[00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:44.657]  And from about five to eight o'clock tonight, I'm going to be out there leading the kickoff of the Occupy the Federal Reserve movement.
[00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:47.979]  Aaron Dykes is going to be co-hosting and riding shotgun with us today.
[00:08:47.979 --> 00:08:55.444]  I'm going to air part of an interview we did with G. Edward Griffin a few days ago coming up in the last 15-20 minutes of the show today.
[00:08:55.444 --> 00:09:01.408]  Bob Chapman will also be popping in for the first half of the third hour on the economy
[00:09:02.328 --> 00:09:05.571]  And then I will be down at the private Federal Reserve today.
[00:09:05.571 --> 00:09:07.972]  This has been a huge success.
[00:09:07.972 --> 00:09:16.459]  Not just our idea, but the spontaneous idea that many others had to go out and occupy the Federal Reserve all over the country.
[00:09:16.459 --> 00:09:28.888]  Looking at Infowars.com and also DrugsReport.com, I'm going to go over some headlines here and then throw it to Aaron for a few minutes to get his take on what's happening and some of the news he has there in front of him.
[00:09:28.888 --> 00:09:30.990]  When I checked in to this hotel last night,
[00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:37.033]  I noticed that they had Thursday's paper laying there.
[00:09:37.033 --> 00:09:44.477]  This is USA Today, soon to be obsolete physical paper.
[00:09:44.477 --> 00:09:49.960]  The vestigial mainstream media hanging on by its fingernails.
[00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:58.090]  And I was reading about Steve Jobs' death, of course, and thinking, man, I didn't even really talk about that yesterday.
[00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.511]  Well, that was today, yesterday.
[00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:01.291]  I didn't talk about that today on the show.
[00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:02.852]  I can talk about it tomorrow.
[00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:06.194]  But I flipped open the paper, and just every article
[00:10:06.934 --> 00:10:08.035]  Just jumped out at me.
[00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:08.896]  Look at this one.
[00:10:08.896 --> 00:10:12.800]  And of course, we covered this on Monday, but here it is in USA Today.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.463]  Florida County, no fluoride in water.
[00:10:15.463 --> 00:10:19.467]  There's 700,000 people in the town.
[00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:22.090]  The move will halt fluoridate.
[00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.514]  Fluoride being injected into the water, reaching about 700,000 residents.
[00:10:30.749 --> 00:10:33.712]  And of course, the feds are freaking out.
[00:10:33.712 --> 00:10:39.877]  The American Dental Association is freaking out, saying, oh my gosh, our teeth will be rotten.
[00:10:39.877 --> 00:10:48.385]  That'd be like saying if you don't drink sunscreen, your nose will get burned when you're out fishing or when you're out at the beach.
[00:10:48.385 --> 00:10:51.428]  And of course, the American Dental Association was forced, what, six years ago?
[00:10:52.128 --> 00:11:02.190]  To say that people under the age of five shouldn't brush with fluoride toothpaste or drink fluoride water because it's causing dental fluorosis and actually weakening the teeth.
[00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:06.891]  And that's not even getting into the brain damage, the bone cancer, all the rest of it.
[00:11:06.891 --> 00:11:10.452]  But here they are with that hoax again, saying it's for your kid's teeth.
[00:11:10.452 --> 00:11:15.353]  And you go to the store and it's baby bottle water everywhere fortified with fluoride.
[00:11:15.353 --> 00:11:21.254]  When the American Dental Association and the American Medical Association, American Medical Association came out, what, two years ago.
[00:11:22.374 --> 00:11:25.275]  The American Dental Association five, six years ago, I don't know, 2006.
[00:11:25.275 --> 00:11:27.176]  So yeah, five, six years ago.
[00:11:27.176 --> 00:11:31.918]  A couple years ago, what, 2009, the American Medical Association came out.
[00:11:31.918 --> 00:11:32.678]  You can look this up.
[00:11:32.678 --> 00:11:33.579]  We've had doctors on.
[00:11:33.579 --> 00:11:34.699]  We've covered it.
[00:11:34.699 --> 00:11:41.642]  They came out and said, don't give your baby fluoridated water mixed with powdered formula if that's what you're giving them.
[00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:47.027]  But still, the establishment counts on the ignorance of the public.
[00:11:47.027 --> 00:11:57.091]  On one side, they cover their butts, kind of like putting a warning on a package of cigarettes or a warning on a cell phone that it can give you brain cancer, but then still push it at you.
[00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:59.552]  Yesterday, my wife said, you ought to cover this on air.
[00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.732]  Look at this women's magazine.
[00:12:00.732 --> 00:12:03.754]  It says, inject boys with Gardasil now.
[00:12:04.594 --> 00:12:06.356]  And it said, you know, it's not just for girls.
[00:12:06.356 --> 00:12:11.521]  And then you flip over the page, the front's all happy colors and how it's going to keep you real safe.
[00:12:11.521 --> 00:12:14.524]  You flip it over, there's a giant page of fine print.
[00:12:16.425 --> 00:12:23.768]  Just of all the horrible things, the convulsions, the death, the bleeding out of orifices, how wonderful it's all going to be.
[00:12:23.768 --> 00:12:26.329]  But there it is, big victories every week.
[00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:32.152]  I see small towns, big cities, sometimes multiple times a week, that are taking this stuff out of the water.
[00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:34.933]  Fluoride counting, no fluoride in water.
[00:12:34.933 --> 00:12:38.394]  Opponents cite government intrusion and potential risk.
[00:12:39.935 --> 00:12:43.817]  There it is right there for you in USA Today.
[00:12:43.817 --> 00:12:48.800]  You'll also notice there's another little headline right there right beside the fluoride article.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:59.488]  Radio listeners that are new listeners, I get emails all the time and they say, I listen to your show on this station in Southern California or in Florida or in Austin.
[00:12:59.488 --> 00:13:04.353]  You keep talking about, look here on the screen, this is a radio show.
[00:13:04.353 --> 00:13:10.939]  Well, we are on XM, we are on a lot of MNFM stations, we are on Global Shortwave, but we're also simulcasting everything.
[00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:11.960]  We're good to
[00:13:29.157 --> 00:13:30.959]  He'll be hosting the show tonight.
[00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:32.120]  We'll have reports by then.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.463]  I'll probably just end up calling into my own show tonight to give you an on-the-ground report.
[00:13:36.463 --> 00:13:42.748]  We can also upload videos pretty much in real time and have those for the nightly news this evening at our Occupy the Fed event.
[00:13:42.748 --> 00:13:43.889]  I'm going to get to that in just a moment.
[00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:45.990]  That's why we're in Dallas.
[00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:50.754]  But right next to it, it says acting ATF director will review practices.
[00:13:50.754 --> 00:13:55.538]  And they go on to say that they're going to look at the problems they had and the mistakes
[00:13:57.265 --> 00:14:02.127]  That they made to stop this from happening in the future.
[00:14:02.127 --> 00:14:23.616]  That'd be like if you, if the police pulled somebody over, and they had two or three dead kids in the back trunk, and then they'd go to the person's house and dig up 25 bodies, and then the criminal says, well, I'm going to try to review the problem and the mistake and make sure it doesn't happen anymore.
[00:14:24.818 --> 00:14:36.224]  Or that'd be like if a bank robber got caught in his hideout with two million dollars he'd stolen from four or five banks in a crime spree and just said, it's a mistake, it was an accident.
[00:14:36.224 --> 00:14:42.187]  Or it'd be like if you just decided to go beat your neighbor's brains out with a baseball bat just because it'd be fun.
[00:14:42.187 --> 00:14:44.668]  The cops pull up and his brains are all over the ground.
[00:14:44.668 --> 00:14:45.889]  You just say, oh, it was an accident.
[00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:47.490]  They go, oh, well, of course.
[00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.491]  You say you'll try not to do that in the future?
[00:14:50.491 --> 00:14:53.593]  This is premeditated capital accessory to murder.
[00:14:54.901 --> 00:14:58.924]  Murder one, ladies and gentlemen, knowingly shipping guns into Mexico.
[00:14:58.924 --> 00:15:01.867]  And I told you this six months ago.
[00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:03.768]  I told you this a month ago.
[00:15:03.768 --> 00:15:05.630]  We told you this years ago.
[00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.891]  The basics of what was happening with it.
[00:15:07.891 --> 00:15:09.953]  Fast and Furious.
[00:15:09.953 --> 00:15:18.460]  And now it has come out that in just one event alone, the ATF was ordered to ship 2,000 guns directly to Sinaloa.
[00:15:19.824 --> 00:15:24.005]  The dominant drug cartel on the US-Mexico border.
[00:15:24.005 --> 00:15:31.546]  The one teamed up with the CIA, the FBI, the DEA, the ATF, the Coast Guard.
[00:15:31.546 --> 00:15:32.607]  Eight agencies.
[00:15:32.607 --> 00:15:34.427]  This is in major newspapers.
[00:15:34.427 --> 00:15:35.587]  This is in the Miami Herald.
[00:15:35.587 --> 00:15:37.127]  This is in the Chicago Tribune.
[00:15:37.127 --> 00:15:38.828]  But buried in them.
[00:15:38.828 --> 00:15:42.489]  And they shipped them, in one case, 2,000 guns.
[00:15:42.489 --> 00:15:44.389]  There were the cases where they had the
[00:15:46.178 --> 00:15:51.140]  Gun shops, they would come into gun shop owners and say, we want you to help your government.
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:55.401]  We are going to have, well, there's going to be criminals coming in and buying guns.
[00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:56.682]  We want to trace those.
[00:15:56.682 --> 00:16:04.685]  Let us set up cameras and then we'll trace it back to the drug cartels and stop the flow of guns.
[00:16:04.685 --> 00:16:07.926]  And so the gun shops went along with it all over the country, not just Arizona.
[00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:09.887]  That's where the ATF blew the whistle.
[00:16:09.887 --> 00:16:12.288]  And some of the agents didn't, they're still trying to cover that up.
[00:16:13.337 --> 00:16:24.360]  Now, all of that is unfolding, but that was only a way to later show it on the news and not tell you it was actually ATF agents coming in and getting the guns.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:37.244]  It was a way to blame the Second Amendment and just act like it was a sting, when the sting was really the cover for a Iran-Contra type situation where the drugs are shipped in and the guns are shipped out of the U.S.
[00:16:37.244 --> 00:16:42.466]  to Mexico so that those cartels that are laundering their money through the big Federal Reserve banks
[00:16:43.346 --> 00:16:47.973]  So that they can defeat their competition that isn't laundering their money.
[00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:51.919]  So the Mexicans ship in the cocaine, the criminal U.S.
[00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:59.029]  government ships them the guns, and then shuts down the cowboys that are cutting in on all of their business.
[00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.593]  So, basically, I thought that I would cover that.
[00:17:02.593 --> 00:17:18.847]  And I keep beating that drum about the drug dealing element of this and the direct shipment of guns directly to the cartels that came out on Mexican TV, I don't know, six months ago, it was on National Mexican News, down in Mexico.
[00:17:18.847 --> 00:17:22.430]  But just now, it's just starting to leak out in our media.
[00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.893]  Now, you're asking, why haven't the Republicans just dropped the hammer?
[00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:33.776]  The Republicans haven't dropped the hammer because Fast and Furious is only three years old since Obama got into office and got going.
[00:17:33.776 --> 00:17:43.945]  But Sinaloa documents and other documents that are in the Chicago Tribune and Infowars.com, again Paul Watson reported on this six months ago when the documents first came out.
[00:17:43.945 --> 00:17:46.206]  A few months later other media picked it up.
[00:17:49.804 --> 00:17:54.517]  The cartels have brought forward in court that they were authorized by the U.S.
[00:17:54.517 --> 00:17:57.084]  government to do this, and that's been confirmed.
[00:17:58.317 --> 00:18:02.840]  And it goes back with Sinaloa at least five and a half years.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.862]  So that's the Bush administration.
[00:18:04.862 --> 00:18:10.305]  That's why the Republicans are just going to move to get Holder to step down and score political points against him.
[00:18:10.305 --> 00:18:16.109]  But that's why Holder probably will end up stepping down, but for now is hanging on because he's calling their bluff.
[00:18:16.109 --> 00:18:21.413]  He knows full well this is an officially sanctioned Federal Reserve operation.
[00:18:21.413 --> 00:18:22.974]  The Federal Reserve runs the U.S.
[00:18:22.974 --> 00:18:26.676]  government, runs the Pentagon, runs the monetary system, runs it all.
[00:18:26.676 --> 00:18:27.977]  It's the private dictatorship.
[00:18:28.838 --> 00:18:34.263]  They're officially now setting that up in Europe over the euro and admitting it's a financial dictatorship.
[00:18:34.263 --> 00:18:38.286]  So this is an official operation just like Iran-Contra.
[00:18:38.286 --> 00:18:40.989]  They may burn a little Ollie North or somebody.
[00:18:40.989 --> 00:18:44.011]  They may burn a G. Gordon Liddy like with Watergate.
[00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:50.357]  But they're going to move on from that unless we absolutely ran this story out to everybody.
[00:18:50.357 --> 00:18:51.218]  That's what's going to happen.
[00:18:52.571 --> 00:18:54.012]  Now we're going to go to break here in a moment.
[00:18:54.012 --> 00:19:01.260]  I'm going to come back and give the next little five minute segment to Aaron because I know he's got a big stack of news and points he wants to point out.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:09.508]  And then I'm going to come back at 33 after and reset and get into the incredible developments concerning the Federal Reserve.
[00:19:09.508 --> 00:19:11.009]  These are some of the most
[00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:21.515]  Positive things I could ever see happen and really signifies how this establishment has overreached and is in a desperate, desperate situation.
[00:19:21.515 --> 00:19:36.923]  They've had Al Gore, George Soros, Barack Obama, Ben Bernanke, the head of the Fed, the Treasury Secretary, the head of the Dallas Fed, all come out in the last three days and say they're in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street.
[00:19:36.923 --> 00:19:39.605]  That's because they're trying to co-opt it, but I can tell you they failed.
[00:19:40.509 --> 00:19:46.393]  They want to make it about free market Wall Street being bad instead of about the Federal Reserve and the inter-coterie.
[00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:51.015]  The big six megabanks that launder the drug money, that run the child kidnapping, that run it all.
[00:19:51.015 --> 00:19:52.656]  And we can tie into that as well.
[00:19:52.656 --> 00:19:56.639]  Aaron Dyke's coming up with some of the news, and I'll be back with Aaron after that break.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:07.644]  Iodine Protection Packs from HempUSA.org are now in stock for immediate delivery worldwide.

[00:20:30.137 --> 00:20:39.463]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.463 --> 00:20:40.264]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.264 --> 00:20:46.528]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.528 --> 00:20:47.409]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[00:22:01.368 --> 00:22:06.071]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:12.496]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:22:12.496 --> 00:22:14.777]  Number one, study the past.
[00:22:14.777 --> 00:22:17.179]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:22:17.179 --> 00:22:20.902]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:22:22.017 --> 00:22:25.119]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:22:25.119 --> 00:22:28.941]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:22:28.941 --> 00:22:33.985]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:37.427]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:22:37.987 --> 00:22:41.409]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:22:41.409 --> 00:22:45.911]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:22:45.911 --> 00:22:50.833]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[00:22:55.455 --> 00:22:57.616]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:22:59.659 --> 00:23:02.761]  Guys, notice things are different now that you're a little older.
[00:23:02.761 --> 00:23:06.064]  Girls, notice your guy's not quite the man he used to be.
[00:23:06.064 --> 00:23:09.046]  Lower energy, more fat, lower sex drive.
[00:23:09.046 --> 00:23:12.369]  It all could be the signs of testosterone levels dropping.
[00:23:12.369 --> 00:23:14.330]  It doesn't matter who you are, guys.
[00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.451]  This will happen to you.
[00:23:15.731 --> 00:23:27.974]  But now, for the first time, we can boost testosterone naturally by 61% with Ageless Male, a safe, natural supplement that helps you maintain normal, healthy testosterone levels.
[00:23:27.974 --> 00:23:34.775]  Ageless Male is proven in clinical research to safely boost testosterone by 61%.
[00:23:34.775 --> 00:23:40.056]  Healthy testosterone means more vitality, a great outlook, and a healthy sex drive.
[00:23:40.056 --> 00:23:42.077]  This is a game changer.
[00:23:42.077 --> 00:23:43.437]  Be an Ageless Male.
[00:23:43.717 --> 00:23:45.999]  For your risk-free trial, just call 1-800-350-2122.
[00:23:45.999 --> 00:23:46.699]  Don't wait another day.
[00:23:46.699 --> 00:23:46.959]  Call 1-800-350-2122.
[00:23:46.959 --> 00:23:47.260]  That's 1-800-350-2122.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.881]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.049]  It was an inside joke
[00:24:26.624 --> 00:24:28.706]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:28.706 --> 00:24:29.986]  This is Aaron Dykes again.
[00:24:29.986 --> 00:24:31.928]  I'm sitting in with Alex.
[00:24:31.928 --> 00:24:41.775]  It's an honor to be on the program with him, especially on such an important day where we really need to send the signal out that at the root of these protests is the Federal Reserve.
[00:24:41.775 --> 00:24:44.216]  That is the issue we need to deal with.
[00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:51.622]  Of course, the loss of jobs and the attack on student loans and all the other economic issues going on are very important.
[00:24:52.102 --> 00:24:58.208]  But as many of you know out there listening, it is the Federal Reserve at the heart of all this.
[00:24:58.208 --> 00:25:11.742]  That's an economic warfare strategy that was put in place 98 years ago, as we've talked about many times on this show, to allow those moneyed interests, the robber barons who've all carteled together, pooled their power and interest
[00:25:12.202 --> 00:25:12.382]  No.
[00:25:32.668 --> 00:25:38.013]  That the Federal Reserve President in Dallas, Richard Fisher, has come out in the news lately.
[00:25:38.013 --> 00:25:48.443]  He does appear in the news quite often, but I think it's no coincidence he's got a number of statements today saying he's somewhat sympathetic to the Occupy Wall Street interest.
[00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:49.715]  I don't
[00:26:06.479 --> 00:26:07.039]  We're good to go.
[00:26:35.522 --> 00:26:41.611]  In San Francisco, the Occupy San Francisco group has been camped out at the Federal Reserve for more than a week.
[00:26:43.141 --> 00:26:49.285]  And I'm not sure if they're completely sophisticated, but the fact that they chose that location really says a lot.
[00:26:49.285 --> 00:26:53.648]  We've got people on all sides of the spectrum beginning to identify the real enemy.
[00:26:53.648 --> 00:27:00.172]  We've got Dennis Kucinich, people like Ralph Nader, really joining up and becoming allies with people like Ron Paul.
[00:27:00.172 --> 00:27:08.757]  They certainly don't agree on all issues, but they have identified that the Federal Reserve is completely predatory, has to be reined in in one way or another.
[00:27:08.757 --> 00:27:11.519]  People like Kucinich, of course, want to nationalize the Federal Reserve.
[00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:19.924]  Ron Paul really wants to move to eliminate it and just draw out its power completely and return to sound money, half-competing currencies, etc.
[00:27:19.924 --> 00:27:23.966]  Whatever happens, though, the Federal Reserve does have to go.
[00:27:23.966 --> 00:27:25.047]  It's a giant parasite.
[00:27:25.047 --> 00:27:26.307]  It's a giant tick.
[00:27:26.307 --> 00:27:29.749]  And I really hope people are going to show up in Dallas today.
[00:27:29.749 --> 00:27:32.971]  They were, of course, already in Dallas.
[00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:37.434]  Part of the Occupy movement has been there with numbers of more than 200 demonstrators.
[00:27:37.434 --> 00:27:38.775]  That has been in the news as well.
[00:27:39.455 --> 00:27:50.721]  So it's really no surprise to see Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher coming out and trying to placate to this crowd, trying to send a signal that he understands and feels our pain.
[00:27:50.721 --> 00:27:57.724]  Really, they're afraid of anyone taking away that Federal Reserve power because of who that power represents, because of who's behind that power.
[00:28:00.407 --> 00:28:05.751]  With that in mind, we also have Saman Mohamadi.
[00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:09.954]  I really don't know how to pronounce his name, but he always writes excellent articles at the Excavator.
[00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:15.238]  At the gates of the Great Beast, Occupy the Treasonous Fed Revolution begins in Dallas.
[00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:21.053]  And he's got an excellent quote here from David Graham Phillips, the treason of the Senate.
[00:28:21.053 --> 00:28:36.144]  Treason is a strong word, but not too strong to characterize the situation in which the Senate is the eager, resourceful and indefatigable agent of interest as hostile to the American people as any invading army could be.
[00:28:36.144 --> 00:28:38.866]  And of course there is massive anger at
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:52.046]  Washington and the other political interests, but it really represents the way they've continuously sold us out over a whole century to the moneyed interests who are represented in the Federal Reserve.
[00:28:52.046 --> 00:28:56.288]  It's time to, as I've already said, unmask them and really expose who they are.
[00:28:56.288 --> 00:29:05.052]  Alex is coming up on the other side of the brink, but we do just want to hammer home that people are beginning to focus on the Federal Reserve all across the country.
[00:29:05.052 --> 00:29:05.312]  There's 12
[00:29:07.938 --> 00:29:08.278]  I don't
[00:29:28.718 --> 00:29:30.979]  And we're going to get more into that on the other side.
[00:29:30.979 --> 00:29:39.781]  Keep in mind that Al Gore is among those who called for an Arab Spring in America only about a month ago, August 3rd, just a little over a month ago.
[00:29:39.781 --> 00:29:43.942]  And so we're going to talk about where that Occupy Wall Street energy is going.
[00:29:43.942 --> 00:29:45.982]  More on the other side, Infowars.com.
[00:29:45.982 --> 00:29:47.063]  Stay with us.
[00:29:47.063 --> 00:29:49.843]  Today will be a great day.
[00:29:49.843 --> 00:29:51.244]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.244 --> 00:29:53.784]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.784 --> 00:29:56.425]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.744 --> 00:30:06.445]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:30:06.445 --> 00:30:12.867]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:30:12.867 --> 00:30:15.147]  Number one, study the past.
[00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:17.548]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:30:17.548 --> 00:30:21.249]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:25.493]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:30:25.493 --> 00:30:29.319]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:30:29.319 --> 00:30:34.386]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:30:34.386 --> 00:30:37.791]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:30:38.371 --> 00:30:41.772]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:30:41.772 --> 00:30:46.274]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:30:46.274 --> 00:30:51.196]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[00:31:01.072 --> 00:31:02.793]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:02.793 --> 00:31:08.095]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:31:08.095 --> 00:31:09.635]  Saving means to make money.
[00:31:09.635 --> 00:31:18.399]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.

[00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:34.684]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:34.684 --> 00:31:39.925]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:31:59.719 --> 00:32:00.920]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:07.845]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:07.845 --> 00:32:10.387]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:10.387 --> 00:32:15.771]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:15.771 --> 00:32:18.813]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:18.813 --> 00:32:20.875]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:21.115 --> 00:32:27.380]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.742]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:30.742 --> 00:32:36.527]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:36.527 --> 00:32:38.168]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:38.168 --> 00:32:39.469]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:39.469 --> 00:32:42.151]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:32:42.151 --> 00:32:46.374]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:46.374 --> 00:32:48.396]  You can find the video at www.
[00:32:49.156 --> 00:32:50.978]  End of America 3 dot com.
[00:32:50.978 --> 00:32:53.560]  That's End of America, the number 3 dot com.

[00:33:05.951 --> 00:33:12.416]  I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride.
[00:33:12.416 --> 00:33:14.718]  With sword and pistol by my side.
[00:33:17.722 --> 00:33:26.838]  Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
[00:33:28.795 --> 00:33:32.256]  Yes, today is a good day.
[00:33:32.256 --> 00:33:46.199]  All over the United States, and all over the world for that matter, citizens are marching on their central banks, their federal reserves, their Bank of England, their German bank.
[00:33:46.199 --> 00:33:48.280]  But these are not government banks.
[00:33:49.773 --> 00:33:53.377]  The banksters from the founding of this country always tried to take over.
[00:33:53.377 --> 00:34:00.925]  Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, they all fought the very same banking cartel, the very same families.
[00:34:02.745 --> 00:34:07.086]  And so the bankers learned how to masquerade and come out with a federal reserve.
[00:34:07.086 --> 00:34:14.108]  And they had the big bankers, JP Morgan and others, come out and speak out against it in 1912 and 1913.
[00:34:14.108 --> 00:34:17.069]  How dare you try to pass this?
[00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:20.070]  I don't want to be thrown in that briar patch.
[00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:23.031]  Whatever you do, please, please don't set up.
[00:34:23.391 --> 00:34:37.402]  The Federal Reserve, totally separate from government with government power, but private, for us to now completely control the issuance of currency and credit, not just loan out $10 for every dollar in reserve, but total power?
[00:34:37.402 --> 00:34:40.384]  Oh, not that!
[00:34:40.384 --> 00:34:44.907]  And that little ruse worked, and here we are 98 years later.
[00:34:44.907 --> 00:34:49.611]  Earlier this year they celebrated the 100 year anniversary of hatching the plan.
[00:34:50.894 --> 00:34:53.316]  at Jekyll Island, Georgia, just a few years before 1913.
[00:34:53.316 --> 00:35:02.881]  And we played the clips on air of Greenspan, even released part of the speeches they were giving, saying, yes, a lot of crimes have been committed.
[00:35:02.881 --> 00:35:05.063]  People are going to be angry.
[00:35:05.063 --> 00:35:08.845]  And we're going to have to work with the people to punish those.
[00:35:08.845 --> 00:35:14.288]  And there was lots of giggling up there on the stage with Bernanke and
[00:35:16.092 --> 00:35:17.653]  Greenspan and the rest of them.
[00:35:17.653 --> 00:35:20.193]  Because they think you're stupid children.
[00:35:20.193 --> 00:35:21.714]  And they think I'm stupid.
[00:35:21.714 --> 00:35:26.235]  And they know they can come out and say, we're sorry capitalism was bad.
[00:35:26.235 --> 00:35:26.936]  You're right.
[00:35:26.936 --> 00:35:29.356]  We'll raise taxes on the middle class.
[00:35:29.356 --> 00:35:30.917]  I mean the rich.
[00:35:30.917 --> 00:35:32.638]  And we'll have austerity.
[00:35:32.638 --> 00:35:34.798]  And, oh, you want free health care?
[00:35:34.798 --> 00:35:40.980]  Yeah, we'll raise health care costs and not actually cover you and knock people off of it and have death panels.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.401]  Because that's helping old ladies.
[00:35:43.482 --> 00:35:44.362]  And that's in the news.
[00:35:44.362 --> 00:35:46.403]  More people getting off their health care.
[00:35:46.403 --> 00:35:47.544]  Total control.
[00:35:47.544 --> 00:35:49.404]  Total scams.
[00:35:49.404 --> 00:35:53.986]  Greatest level of housing bust since Great Depression.
[00:35:53.986 --> 00:35:55.047]  It's now official.
[00:35:55.047 --> 00:35:57.147]  The government admits it.
[00:35:57.147 --> 00:35:58.288]  They just con you.
[00:35:59.957 --> 00:36:05.221]  And their program to fix the problems was a ruse.
[00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:06.742]  They haven't failed.
[00:36:06.742 --> 00:36:25.355]  They've succeeded in bankrupting this country and de-industrializing us and shutting off the value of our currency and hoarding tens of trillions of quote banker bailout money that's really a tax to the private Federal Reserve which they then use to acquire more infrastructure, more media companies, more defense infrastructure and then
[00:36:25.735 --> 00:36:32.458]  Not have to have their retail sector banking anymore and actually, quote, make profits out of loaning you money.
[00:36:32.458 --> 00:36:36.480]  Now they're just like, we're not going to loan you things for cars or business.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.982]  If you got a credit card, it's going to be 30 plus percent.
[00:36:39.982 --> 00:36:46.405]  That was Obama's credit card reform was to raise, raise the interest on what you can do to people.
[00:36:46.405 --> 00:36:48.967]  Hey, just like the health care was a reform.
[00:36:48.967 --> 00:36:51.028]  Total cold blooded mislabeling.
[00:36:52.168 --> 00:37:04.277]  So what's so exciting here, Aaron Dykes, who we'll go to in a moment, was just alluding to it, and then I'm going to open the phones up coming up for pretty much the entire second hour today with your host, Alex Jones.
[00:37:04.277 --> 00:37:07.819]  That's, of course, good old me and Aaron Dykes.
[00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:09.173]  Thank you.
[00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:37.213]  Okay, we're having some kind of technical difficulties.
[00:37:37.213 --> 00:37:39.255]  Let me know as soon as Alex is back.
[00:37:39.255 --> 00:37:44.439]  He's just about to break down, really, the Federal Reserve System for new listeners.
[00:37:44.439 --> 00:37:48.482]  But in the meantime, we want to talk more about Eric Blair's article.
[00:37:48.482 --> 00:37:50.683]  Obama and Congress are Wall Street.
[00:37:50.683 --> 00:37:52.445]  Geithner is the Federal Reserve.
[00:37:52.865 --> 00:38:13.796]  The government itself is really just an interface, a medium between the various powers in this country, and we've been ruled far too long by those monetary interests, but that does not mean that some broader socialist movement is the answer to taking on what really amounts to the Federal Reserve power, and that is why we are trying to put so much spotlight on the Federal Reserve here.
[00:38:13.796 --> 00:38:17.018]  Alex is back, so we're going to go back to him right now.
[00:38:18.083 --> 00:38:19.784]  Yeah, what amazing technology.
[00:38:19.784 --> 00:38:26.686]  We've been using Skype on and off for four or five years, but it's just now gotten good enough with 4G technology.
[00:38:26.686 --> 00:38:32.708]  As I sit here radiating myself, the 4G is even better than the hotel landline connection.
[00:38:32.708 --> 00:38:42.631]  So as I sit here barbecuing myself with RF pollution that they now admit is cancer-causing, there is a good cost-benefit trade-off because
[00:38:43.411 --> 00:38:53.354]  Now I can sit here like we're in the movie 2001 Space Odyssey, Arthur C. Clarke talking to you right now.
[00:38:53.354 --> 00:38:59.036]  It is Buck Rogers, so a great tool, but it does have some glitches still.
[00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:01.637]  Now continuing, you just heard what Aaron was saying.
[00:39:01.637 --> 00:39:04.338]  Government has become nothing but a facade
[00:39:04.918 --> 00:39:17.988]  A interface for mega global corporations that are owned by the big central banks because they're able to issue unlimited currency and credit and derivatives, fraud instruments, and buy real assets that consolidate power with it.
[00:39:19.617 --> 00:39:27.223]  And now the big mega banks in every part of the world are instituting what they've done in the last hundred years in the third world.
[00:39:27.223 --> 00:39:46.877]  Coming in, financing politicians into power, or financing coups, military coups into power, and then coming in and jacking up the utility prices, jacking up the water and energy prices, jacking up the toll roads, slapping fines and fees on everything, and calling it privatization.
[00:39:46.877 --> 00:39:47.718]  But it's the opposite.
[00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:48.479]  They seize
[00:39:49.159 --> 00:40:00.892]  What the public taxes and infrastructure and culture have built over hundreds of years and then absolutely shut the economy down and they don't care.
[00:40:02.188 --> 00:40:05.189]  About, quote, so much making money.
[00:40:05.189 --> 00:40:12.130]  They raise the taxes through their dictators or plutocrats they put in power, through their bureaucracies.
[00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:17.091]  They raise the taxes up and up and up on every facet of life.
[00:40:17.091 --> 00:40:24.633]  They devalue the currencies, which are then also a tax on the price of energy and food because of devaluation.
[00:40:24.633 --> 00:40:28.954]  And it's designed to fully destroy those cultures.
[00:40:29.534 --> 00:40:38.372]  It is an economic warfare system and it was a big deal in 2002 when Joseph Stiklitz, two-time Nobel Prize winner, quit the World Bank.
[00:40:39.386 --> 00:40:49.508]  He was the chief economist, and right after that, wink wink, he says he didn't do it, the BBC and Greg Pallis were leaked thousands of pages of documents.
[00:40:49.508 --> 00:40:59.770]  Now, Pallis in one report got quite a few of them out, then so much pressure was put by the government on BBC, which is government run in England, the rest was not released.
[00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:02.430]  But Pallis has talked about what was in those.
[00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:05.331]  And the parts he was able to release were the, I think it was 111 point plan,
[00:41:08.131 --> 00:41:08.431]  Thank you.
[00:41:32.202 --> 00:41:41.272]  And then that globalist company is a subsidiary of the very banks and that money they're loaning them is just fiat but backed up by Western taxpayers.
[00:41:41.272 --> 00:41:46.817]  That's what gives it the value and also the Western giant military that we as taxpayers pay for.
[00:41:47.558 --> 00:41:57.545]  And they wrap it all in the American flag, the British flag, the EU flag, and then we, the people, get the blame for this great tyranny when we're the ones actually paying for it out of our hide.
[00:41:57.545 --> 00:42:03.489]  Now, we do deserve some of the blame because we've been ignorant and allowed this fraud to be taking place, but it's so complex.
[00:42:03.489 --> 00:42:04.870]  How can you blame people?
[00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:11.054]  You can only blame people once they've been given this information and they don't listen.
[00:42:11.054 --> 00:42:12.715]  So, let me sum it up this way.
[00:42:14.795 --> 00:42:25.421]  Those IMF World Bank plans talked about how they carried out these phases, how they would come in with quote, reforms after their first policies implode the economy to a certain level.
[00:42:25.421 --> 00:42:31.064]  Then they come in with more reforms promised to fix things that only make it worse.
[00:42:31.064 --> 00:42:39.689]  And then more money, more taxes is needed, more toll roads, more cutting of pensions, more austerity as everything is crushed.
[00:42:39.689 --> 00:42:41.090]  I mean, California has raised
[00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:43.671]  More than 20 taxes the last two years.
[00:42:43.671 --> 00:42:47.211]  They've now passed a giant 20-plus percent carbon tax.
[00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:53.713]  They've gone into complete free fall from 20-something percent to over 33 percent back in November of last year.
[00:42:53.713 --> 00:42:58.794]  It's reportedly 40-plus percent in some areas now, but 30-plus percent in California.
[00:42:58.794 --> 00:43:01.315]  And a lot of economists say, why is California doing this?
[00:43:01.315 --> 00:43:05.156]  They know it's going to make their already ailing economy go into cardiac arrest.
[00:43:06.036 --> 00:43:07.778]  Because that's the plan.
[00:43:07.778 --> 00:43:23.611]  Once you fully implode everything through the phases, everybody's completely desperate, completely poor, everything's falling apart, crime explodes, the police departments go bankrupt, and then the globalists roll in and buy up everything for pennies on the dollar.
[00:43:24.412 --> 00:43:40.706]  This is a scorched earth policy, similar militarily to how NATO, the US, England will blow the daylights out of Serbian infrastructure, Iraqi infrastructure, Libyan infrastructure, the list goes on and on, Ivory Coast infrastructure.
[00:43:40.706 --> 00:43:48.753]  I mean, they will go in, even when they've already overthrown who they want, in the 48 hours after, they'll still keep bombing rebel forces.
[00:43:49.554 --> 00:44:04.024]  And they'll blow up the water treatment, the power plants, whatever they can to then come in and tell the new government, OK, now we're going to loan you money at 20, 30, 40 percent compounding interest to rebuild this.
[00:44:04.024 --> 00:44:06.325]  And you've got to spend that money with us.
[00:44:06.325 --> 00:44:07.826]  So they give them our taxpayer money.
[00:44:07.826 --> 00:44:11.429]  We gave the bankers in the bailouts and the taxes and the rest of it.
[00:44:11.429 --> 00:44:14.051]  And then it comes right back to the bankers and their infrastructure.
[00:44:14.724 --> 00:44:21.849]  But now it's globalist infrastructure with fluoridated water for the Irish or for the Ugandans in Africa.
[00:44:21.849 --> 00:44:29.275]  Now it's UN program for shots and Angelina Jolie shows up with little African kids and says, I'm here to give you the shots.
[00:44:29.995 --> 00:44:32.476]  Meanwhile, 10 miles away, and you've got it.
[00:44:32.476 --> 00:44:40.359]  They're lining up families to take their property to, quote, plant trees for carbon offsets and just machine-gutting them.
[00:44:40.359 --> 00:44:49.782]  But it's all right, because Angelina Jolie with big lips, pumped full of college, and it's like, uh, ooh, Brad Pitt, ooh, ooh.
[00:44:49.782 --> 00:44:51.903]  And so it's just, kill us, ah!
[00:44:51.903 --> 00:44:54.064]  Oh, my gosh, Angelina Jolie's here.
[00:44:54.064 --> 00:44:58.126]  I mean, this is the incredible level of evil we're talking about.
[00:45:00.014 --> 00:45:02.595]  Going back to this, you've seen what they've done to the third world.
[00:45:02.595 --> 00:45:06.196]  Now they're coming to do it here incrementally as well.
[00:45:06.196 --> 00:45:18.479]  And if you get too uppity, they just blow something up and say, terrorists did it, so now we've got to ban your protest, and now we've got to stick our hands down your pants and violate you, and now we've got to take blood from you at checkpoints under federal mandates.
[00:45:18.479 --> 00:45:19.720]  It's all about control.
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.982]  It's all about training you that you're a prisoner that we've talked so much about.
[00:45:23.982 --> 00:45:26.344]  Now, here is the incredible good news.
[00:45:26.344 --> 00:45:33.109]  The Federal Reserve is just the regional holding company for the six big mega banks.
[00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:42.395]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and then there's a consortium of others.
[00:45:42.395 --> 00:45:45.698]  But the point is, they're pretty much subsidiaries of the same guys.
[00:45:48.619 --> 00:45:57.145]  That's why when you have a big Federal Reserve bailout in 2008, you learn more than half the money went overseas to foreign banks and foreign investors.
[00:45:57.145 --> 00:46:00.427]  And then now you're hearing about the first bailout of Europe to begin.
[00:46:00.427 --> 00:46:03.589]  The first two or three were just Spain or Ireland.
[00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:07.071]  We're actually in like bailout five or six now if you add all the bailouts together.
[00:46:07.071 --> 00:46:09.513]  They're not bailouts, they're taxes to the bankers.
[00:46:09.513 --> 00:46:10.914]  They create derivatives.
[00:46:10.914 --> 00:46:13.996]  They control the finance ministers, prime ministers and presidents.
[00:46:14.756 --> 00:46:16.837]  They control the head of the Nature Conservancy.
[00:46:16.837 --> 00:46:17.858]  They control it all.
[00:46:17.858 --> 00:46:19.459]  He's a former Goldman Sachs guy.
[00:46:19.459 --> 00:46:21.280]  Most of these third world companies they bring down.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:26.943]  You go look at who their president, prime minister, or finance minister is, in some cases all three, and they're all Goldman Sachs.
[00:46:26.943 --> 00:46:31.566]  They're the, even more than JPMorgan, they were given the management job.
[00:46:31.566 --> 00:46:33.647]  JPMorgan overall is bigger than Goldman Sachs.
[00:46:33.647 --> 00:46:39.071]  It's kind of the big daddy, but his henchmen, you know, the attack dog, like,
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.863]  The Hatchet Man Executor is Goldman Sachs in the last 25 years.
[00:46:44.863 --> 00:46:47.024]  And it's their operatives everywhere.
[00:46:47.024 --> 00:46:52.308]  And those are the ringwraiths that come riding into your town, into your city, into your company, into your business.
[00:46:52.308 --> 00:46:56.891]  They're the ones shutting down the coal plants while they've got the coal plants that have the waiver.
[00:46:56.891 --> 00:47:01.134]  They're the ones coming, giggling with simpering soft voices with a dagger.
[00:47:02.395 --> 00:47:18.018]  Coming for the Republic, coming for infrastructure, bringing you down to serfdom, all the same snake men, marching in their little suits, prancing around, thinking that you can't see, hoping you stay in darkness and blind, but the minute we reveal them, they become so weak.
[00:47:18.018 --> 00:47:18.158]  Now...
[00:47:19.284 --> 00:47:20.725]  This here's the key to it all.
[00:47:20.725 --> 00:47:24.629]  The snake men are panicking right now.
[00:47:24.629 --> 00:47:28.233]  The snake men are in free fall right now.
[00:47:28.233 --> 00:47:29.314]  They have actuaries.
[00:47:29.314 --> 00:47:30.115]  They bragged about this.
[00:47:30.115 --> 00:47:33.698]  They have Google and NSA tracking systems.
[00:47:33.698 --> 00:47:39.884]  And that's what Google is that can predict with 99% certainty what mass movements are going to do.
[00:47:40.845 --> 00:47:42.707]  Down to just a few day period.
[00:47:42.707 --> 00:47:43.668]  They admit this.
[00:47:43.668 --> 00:47:45.590]  They have 93% accuracy.
[00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:46.831]  You can pull this up.
[00:47:46.831 --> 00:47:52.858]  Google says their algorithm has 93% accuracy on what you're going to do next.
[00:47:52.858 --> 00:47:57.322]  I think that one of the headlines earlier this year was Google knows what you're going to do before you know.
[00:47:58.263 --> 00:48:02.447]  It's already tracked your subconscious mind by thousands of decisions it's tracked.
[00:48:02.447 --> 00:48:05.910]  It's got an actuary matrix code layered system.
[00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:08.191]  And it knows when you're going to go see a movie.
[00:48:08.191 --> 00:48:10.053]  It knows what steakhouse you're going to go to.
[00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:15.077]  Because it's tracked all the decisions you've made and where you surf and where you go with those cookies.
[00:48:15.077 --> 00:48:16.498]  Facebook, same thing.
[00:48:16.498 --> 00:48:19.101]  All integrated into a master NSA database.
[00:48:19.101 --> 00:48:21.443]  It's come out, Apple, total NSA front.
[00:48:21.443 --> 00:48:23.224]  Steve Jobs didn't develop any of it, basically.
[00:48:23.224 --> 00:48:24.785]  I mean, he's one of their top technologists.
[00:48:25.806 --> 00:48:27.127]  He's a front man.
[00:48:27.127 --> 00:48:28.547]  Bill Gates didn't develop any of it.
[00:48:28.547 --> 00:48:30.008]  Total NSA front.
[00:48:30.008 --> 00:48:31.408]  Google didn't develop any of it.
[00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:33.609]  Admitted NSA and QTEL front.
[00:48:33.609 --> 00:48:37.290]  All of this is 30-year-old technology they're just doling out.
[00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.631]  And we think we're getting something out of it.
[00:48:39.631 --> 00:48:45.093]  Really, it's a tracking grid to understand everything we're doing, what we're thinking, where we're going.
[00:48:45.093 --> 00:48:49.915]  So it's a literal, and this is what they call it, they call it a crystal ball system.
[00:48:49.915 --> 00:48:51.436]  An electronic crystal ball.
[00:48:52.136 --> 00:49:01.060]  That's why they want RFID on all real products in the real third dimension so they can actually track physical things and they'll have true crystal ball power according to them.
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:18.388]  And they can then look at that system and it gives them an algorithm and it says, our prime projection by mid-October 2011, this is a year ago, there will be uprisings across the western world due to commodity price increases, joblessness, the statistics come in.
[00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:20.049]  Prime targets will be Wall Street.
[00:49:21.211 --> 00:49:24.620]  Zbigniew Brzezinski said the public finally is awake and watching us.
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:25.843]  Computer continues.
[00:49:25.843 --> 00:49:26.986]  Prime analysis.
[00:49:26.986 --> 00:49:28.249]  Outbreaks of rebellion.
[00:49:29.187 --> 00:49:31.748]  And then they bring in the actuaries on top of that.
[00:49:31.748 --> 00:49:32.709]  Prime response.
[00:49:32.709 --> 00:49:34.169]  Co-op revolution.
[00:49:34.169 --> 00:49:40.152]  Endorse socialism and collectivization to transfer further wealth in next phase of program.
[00:49:40.152 --> 00:49:42.053]  They bring in the next actuary map.
[00:49:42.053 --> 00:49:43.853]  They got the men all in the rooms.
[00:49:43.853 --> 00:49:45.034]  Pentagon analysis.
[00:49:45.034 --> 00:49:46.654]  Bring in the other experts.
[00:49:46.654 --> 00:49:47.835]  Prime projection.
[00:49:47.835 --> 00:49:52.197]  This has a 97% accuracy rate to be able to carry this out against them.
[00:49:52.717 --> 00:49:55.599]  The alternative media scope shows that they're growing at this point.
[00:49:55.599 --> 00:49:57.021]  They still can't stop us.
[00:49:57.021 --> 00:50:00.864]  This is the type of actuaries that are going into all this crime projection.
[00:50:00.864 --> 00:50:02.785]  Then they bring in other experts.
[00:50:02.785 --> 00:50:12.694]  If this fails, staged terror attack, new war, that'll change the matrix flow of the data grid at a tribal level by getting us through fear to submit to them.
[00:50:12.694 --> 00:50:14.675]  But I'm getting a little bit too technical here.
[00:50:14.675 --> 00:50:16.417]  The point is they're looking into their crystal ball.
[00:50:18.009 --> 00:50:19.590]  They're tracking everything we're doing.
[00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:21.150]  They know we're about to rebel.
[00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:22.631]  So they have Al Gorgo.
[00:50:22.631 --> 00:50:24.372]  It's time for an Arab Spring!
[00:50:24.372 --> 00:50:27.393]  He said that two months ago.
[00:50:27.393 --> 00:50:30.774]  You have George Soros who funds these revolutions worldwide.
[00:50:30.774 --> 00:50:33.275]  Always for collectivism to get more for the bankers to suck out.
[00:50:33.755 --> 00:50:35.976]  They tell the general public, we're big billionaires.
[00:50:35.976 --> 00:50:38.436]  We want to raise taxes to help you.
[00:50:38.436 --> 00:50:39.377]  Got a shot for you.
[00:50:39.377 --> 00:50:43.038]  Oh, can you get some welfare money, but no man in the house is allowed?
[00:50:43.038 --> 00:50:44.198]  Because we care about you.
[00:50:44.198 --> 00:50:52.680]  When I come back, I'm going to explain to you the fact that they knew what was about to happen tracking all this with their societal tracker systems.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.241]  And so now they're trying to trigger
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:06.069]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:06.444 --> 00:52:15.349]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:18.791]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:52:18.791 --> 00:52:19.891]  But take heart.
[00:52:19.891 --> 00:52:23.633]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:52:23.633 --> 00:52:28.596]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:52:29.016 --> 00:52:32.858]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:34.579]  The globalists are scared.
[00:52:34.579 --> 00:52:35.919]  They've overreached.
[00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:39.421]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:52:54.808 --> 00:52:57.089]  We are going to use their system against them.
[00:52:57.089 --> 00:52:58.370]  The info war now.
[00:53:00.274 --> 00:53:07.047]  With economic and job-based stress now the leading cause of illness, is your body ready for the hard times ahead?
[00:53:12.202 --> 00:53:16.324]  This is Bill Hyde with a special report on staying healthy in hard times.
[00:53:16.324 --> 00:53:27.390]  According to a new article in the London Telegraph, job stress associated with the economic downturn has now replaced cancer, stroke, heart attack and back problems as the number one reason people miss work.
[00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:30.292]  In fact, it's now being called the black death of our time.
[00:53:30.492 --> 00:53:37.594]  This means taking care of your body could be the single most important thing you do, especially in these hard economic times.
[00:53:37.594 --> 00:53:45.336]  Recently, we've created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing how to make sure your body is ready for the dangerous times we live in.

[00:54:10.163 --> 00:54:31.184]  Alright, we are overlooking the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve, where today from 5 o'clock to about 8 o'clock, I'm going to be there with fellow patriots who understand the Federal Reserve is the holding company of the big mega-parasitic foreign banks that have engineered our collapse, that are getting the lion's share of our tax money through fraud, and who have the gall
[00:54:31.744 --> 00:54:46.314]  Because they realize that public awareness of them is cresting, and with their Google systems, with their Facebook systems, tracking everybody, tracking the decisions you make, tracking Google admits with Google, Gmail, then they can sample tens of millions of people.
[00:54:46.314 --> 00:54:47.655]  They have computers reading that.
[00:54:49.577 --> 00:54:51.059]  That goes into algorithms.
[00:54:51.059 --> 00:54:54.725]  The Federal Reserve admits they're tracking everybody in real time, what you're saying about them.
[00:54:54.725 --> 00:54:56.768]  That's been going on for decades.
[00:54:56.768 --> 00:54:59.292]  Now they're just going public with it, you see.
[00:54:59.292 --> 00:55:04.180]  And looking into their crystal ball, which is really thousands of graphs and breakdowns and boildowns,
[00:55:04.841 --> 00:55:13.304]  And their statisticians, their sociologists, their psychologists, their behavioral psychologists, all get together and they admit this now.
[00:55:13.304 --> 00:55:19.186]  Product placement, propaganda placement, I call it propaganda placement, they now call it behavior placement.
[00:55:19.186 --> 00:55:23.408]  They have all these messages in the media, but they know it's not going to work.
[00:55:23.408 --> 00:55:29.530]  That's why four years ago the British Ministry of Defense predicted everything that's now beginning to happen right around this same time frame.
[00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:34.876]  So they're attempting, they're attempting here to shift everything.
[00:55:34.876 --> 00:55:44.588]  They're attempting here to try to take control and brand the idea against the Federal Reserve and the New World Order as something socialist.
[00:55:44.588 --> 00:55:48.753]  Just like four years ago with the beginning of the Realty Party under Ron Paul, myself and others.
[00:55:49.954 --> 00:56:01.092]  They tried to make it a right-wing white thing and said everywhere if you're against the fellow reserve and big government you must be white racist to make everybody else feel like well I can't be for freedom then.
[00:56:01.929 --> 00:56:03.351]  See that mind game?
[00:56:03.351 --> 00:56:14.845]  Now they've sent in Al Gore, George Soros, MoveOn.org, the unions, Obama endorsing Occupy Wall Street, the head of the Dallas Fed, the head of the New York Fed, the chairman of the Fed.
[00:56:14.845 --> 00:56:17.168]  They're all coming out.
[00:56:17.168 --> 00:56:18.649]  Out in Los Angeles, Mayor
[00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:24.834]  Villaraigosa is handing out ponchos to the protesters, saying, yes, we need to raise taxes.
[00:56:24.834 --> 00:56:26.055]  California has enough.
[00:56:26.055 --> 00:56:27.896]  We're going to give you free goodies.
[00:56:27.896 --> 00:56:29.677]  I represent the people.
[00:56:29.677 --> 00:56:31.618]  That's what Bernanke says now.
[00:56:31.618 --> 00:56:36.222]  So they're attempting to steer all this anger and keep it away from the Federal Reserve.
[00:56:36.222 --> 00:56:41.625]  That's why they've had the Federal Reserve minions and bosses come out and say, oh, it's so good.
[00:56:41.625 --> 00:56:42.586]  We agree with you.
[00:56:42.586 --> 00:56:43.787]  You want higher taxes.
[00:56:43.787 --> 00:56:45.448]  Now, that's not even true.
[00:56:45.448 --> 00:56:46.709]  We've had reporters all over the country.
[00:56:47.529 --> 00:56:55.649]  It's true that the mainstream media lied and said Occupy Wall Street wanted socialism and that their leader was Michael Moore, who says capitalism's the problem.
[00:56:57.879 --> 00:57:00.120]  So they've branded it like that.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:03.741]  Like branding the Tea Party white, racist, you know, stuff like that.
[00:57:03.741 --> 00:57:05.441]  They're branding this socialist.
[00:57:05.441 --> 00:57:08.082]  I have come out and said don't let them co-opt it.
[00:57:08.082 --> 00:57:11.262]  This is attempting to take place right now.
[00:57:11.262 --> 00:57:13.503]  Rand Paul has come out and said the same thing.
[00:57:13.503 --> 00:57:22.045]  He's saying basically these are minions of Obama, many of them, and Occupy Wall Street could become violent if Obama continues to endorse it.
[00:57:22.825 --> 00:57:26.109]  Now, again, that's not saying Occupy Wall Street is bad.
[00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:37.141]  The point is, the way Obama is endorsing it, the way they're saying, yes, you deserve free healthcare, you deserve free education, you deserve all these things free, well, the people aren't going to get that.
[00:57:37.141 --> 00:57:38.282]  And then they're going to get violent.
[00:57:38.282 --> 00:57:38.702]  You understand?
[00:57:38.702 --> 00:57:43.528]  You tell somebody, you tell a kid after the haircut, if you're good at the haircut, you get a lollipop.
[00:57:44.048 --> 00:57:45.589]  You know, barbershops used to do that.
[00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:50.574]  I remember I'd sit there with scratchy hair on my neck, and you know, the guy cutting my hair, thinking about the lollipop.
[00:57:50.574 --> 00:57:53.657]  If I didn't get the lollipop, well, I wasn't a spoiled brat, I wouldn't have gotten mad.
[00:57:53.657 --> 00:57:55.698]  The point is, a lot of kids will.
[00:57:55.698 --> 00:57:57.300]  And so Rand Paul's talking about that.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.021]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:57:59.021 --> 00:58:00.503]  It's also one of the top stories.
[00:58:00.503 --> 00:58:01.984]  But DrudgeReport.com.
[00:58:01.984 --> 00:58:06.008]  But the bigger issue here is, this is a huge awakening.
[00:58:06.008 --> 00:58:06.868]  The fact that
[00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:14.673]  The establishment's having to come out and try to co-opt a movement against corruption on Wall Street, centering in and around the Federal Reserve.
[00:58:14.673 --> 00:58:18.015]  Shows how weak they are and shows how pathetic they are.
[00:58:18.015 --> 00:58:25.520]  And the other great news is that all over the United States, everywhere, people are protesting the Fed right now.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.802]  And it's getting a lot of media attention.
[00:58:28.802 --> 00:58:32.824]  And so we're actively shifting away from just blaming
[00:58:32.904 --> 00:58:37.089]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.896 --> 00:58:53.737]  Steve Shank here with a special alert from eFoods Direct.
[00:58:53.737 --> 00:58:56.877]  The stock market continues to crash and re-crash daily.
[00:58:56.877 --> 00:59:00.658]  Since July, the market has dropped 15% with no signs of recovery.
[00:59:00.658 --> 00:59:01.798]  What does that mean to you?
[00:59:01.798 --> 00:59:08.620]  When stocks crash, jobs are lost, and you can't buy the food that's already too expensive and continues to raise in cost.
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:13.541]  eFoods just got notice that wholesale costs on pasta, rice, and beans will immediately jump 20%.
[00:59:14.301 --> 00:59:16.723]  The already high cost of sugar is tripling.
[00:59:16.723 --> 00:59:24.928]  If you invest in the stock market for security or save money in the bank, you continue to see the dollar drop in value while your weekly food bills increase.
[00:59:24.928 --> 00:59:26.049]  So what are you going to do?
[00:59:26.049 --> 00:59:27.970]  Get as much food now as you can.
[00:59:27.970 --> 00:59:31.152]  With these problems you're facing, eFoodsDirect has no choice.
[00:59:31.232 --> 00:59:32.673]  Waging war on corruption!
[00:59:32.673 --> 00:59:33.853]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network!
[01:00:05.356 --> 01:00:10.180]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.781]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:13.702]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.702 --> 01:00:17.525]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.525 --> 01:00:21.588]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.486 --> 01:00:27.489]  We are live from Austin, Texas with Aaron Dykes.
[01:00:27.489 --> 01:00:36.860]  They're waiting in the wings to add commentary today and also take over if there's any problems with our connection from Dallas as I overlook the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:42.746]  Lyndon LaRouche is going to pop in for about 30 minutes and then I promise for all of you, Dave, Gerald, Chris,
[01:00:45.089 --> 01:00:53.152]  Maureen, Jaron, Jason, everybody that's patiently holding, we're going to get to you coming up.
[01:00:53.152 --> 01:00:54.573]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:00:54.573 --> 01:01:02.456]  You know, instead of just simplifying things, I always tend to go into all this minutiae and the background and examples.
[01:01:03.476 --> 01:01:05.657]  And I think that's an effective way to get the word out.
[01:01:05.657 --> 01:01:08.758]  But I think it's also important just to sum up what's going on.
[01:01:08.758 --> 01:01:10.758]  I'm not a cheerleader.
[01:01:10.758 --> 01:01:18.760]  10, 15 years ago, I was pretty negative about our prognosis because I saw the creepy police state being set up.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.941]  I knew history.
[01:01:19.941 --> 01:01:22.521]  I'd read what the globalists said they were planning to do.
[01:01:22.521 --> 01:01:26.923]  But I'm pretty positive now because they're not as arrogant as they used to be.
[01:01:26.923 --> 01:01:27.523]  They're scared.
[01:01:28.843 --> 01:01:30.104]  Now, they still can stage terror.
[01:01:30.104 --> 01:01:31.324]  They can still launch new wars.
[01:01:31.324 --> 01:01:33.845]  And boy, that's certainly getting on the front burner now.
[01:01:33.845 --> 01:01:36.046]  Israel army simulates war call-up.
[01:01:36.046 --> 01:01:38.467]  That's coming up later.
[01:01:38.467 --> 01:01:45.490]  But still, once you identify the global banking structure that's not free market, the jig's up.
[01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:53.273]  That's why they're desperate, as they've been for the last hundred years, to brand all opposition to corrupt rich people as communism.
[01:01:54.273 --> 01:01:55.735]  And then that's something they control.
[01:01:55.735 --> 01:01:57.056]  That's collectivism.
[01:01:57.056 --> 01:01:59.539]  They don't want true grassroots free market.
[01:01:59.539 --> 01:02:02.482]  Aaron Dykes, you've been hearing me rant here.
[01:02:02.482 --> 01:02:04.705]  Give me your take on what I've been talking about here.
[01:02:04.705 --> 01:02:06.947]  Do you think I'm being overly optimistic?
[01:02:06.947 --> 01:02:15.917]  Or do you concur that the establishment is just absolutely desperate to be endorsing Occupy Wall Street in an attempt to have them not see the Federal Reserve as the enemy?
[01:02:16.468 --> 01:02:27.361]  Well, I think they're desperate to endorse it because they know that anger's there and it has to be vented somewhere, and the important thing is that they're waiting to steer that into the agenda that's already in place.
[01:02:27.361 --> 01:02:33.349]  Obama really doesn't have a leg to stand on anyway if you look at the way he's handled the economy in the true fashion, but if he
[01:02:34.089 --> 01:02:34.229]  I don't
[01:02:54.341 --> 01:02:54.401]  I'm
[01:03:17.563 --> 01:03:21.429]  Well, not even a month until those Occupy Wall Street demonstrations started.
[01:03:21.429 --> 01:03:27.218]  I really look to those establishment figures for trying to take that energy and they're trying to co-opt it.
[01:03:27.218 --> 01:03:31.644]  So we need to fight back against that and try to make sure we're still looking at the main issues, Alex.
[01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:33.192]  Exactly.
[01:03:33.192 --> 01:03:44.145]  The establishment, to simplify it, just like they tried to make the Tea Party a partisan movement when it started out as just a true populist constitutional movement, they were somewhat successful.
[01:03:44.145 --> 01:03:49.732]  Now they're trying to brand the Occupy Wall Street as an Obama
[01:03:50.793 --> 01:04:03.757]  Al Gore, American Spring, you know, type thing where the solution is the tired old propaganda of collectivists everywhere like Michael Moore.
[01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:07.019]  And I notice here that there's giant starvation increasing.
[01:04:08.499 --> 01:04:12.141]  North Korea spirals towards starvation.
[01:04:12.141 --> 01:04:13.682]  It doesn't work.
[01:04:13.682 --> 01:04:15.003]  It doesn't work.
[01:04:15.003 --> 01:04:19.425]  You can't give everybody free education, free health care.
[01:04:19.425 --> 01:04:22.647]  Somebody's got to have something taken from them.
[01:04:22.647 --> 01:04:24.989]  And when you breed populations,
[01:04:26.448 --> 01:04:31.853]  That live in dependency, you get the type of folks you see on the Jerry Springer Show.
[01:04:31.853 --> 01:04:41.621]  And I go out into America, just since I was a child, whether the people are black, white, Hispanic, old, young, more and more America looks like a Jerry Springer Show.
[01:04:41.621 --> 01:04:47.366]  From the fluoride, the bad food, the dumbing down, the TV, the people talking about mindless issues.
[01:04:47.366 --> 01:04:51.570]  It's a feedback loop, but there's still, I'd say more than half the population is not
[01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:54.571]  A Jerry Springer reject type.
[01:04:54.571 --> 01:04:57.973]  And it's up to us to realize the establishment is trying to play class warfare.
[01:04:57.973 --> 01:05:02.034]  And as Rand Paul said, they could take over the Occupy.
[01:05:02.034 --> 01:05:06.056]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:06.056 --> 01:05:09.298]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:09.298 --> 01:05:14.080]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:20.481]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:20.481 --> 01:05:25.683]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:05:25.683 --> 01:05:35.665]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:05:35.785 --> 01:05:38.127]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:05:38.127 --> 01:05:39.728]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:42.169]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:42.169 --> 01:05:44.311]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:05:44.311 --> 01:05:49.454]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:05:49.454 --> 01:05:58.580]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:01.775 --> 01:06:03.477]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:03.477 --> 01:06:08.782]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:06:08.782 --> 01:06:10.324]  Saving means to make money.
[01:06:10.324 --> 01:06:19.112]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:06:19.833 --> 01:06:27.378]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:06:27.378 --> 01:06:35.383]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:06:35.383 --> 01:06:42.767]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:06:45.529 --> 01:06:48.754]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:50.997]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:06:50.997 --> 01:06:53.260]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:04.793]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.793 --> 01:07:05.714]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.714 --> 01:07:09.136]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.136 --> 01:07:09.997]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.997 --> 01:07:14.880]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.640]  It's true.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:20.504]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:21.344]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.344 --> 01:07:24.926]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.926 --> 01:07:28.609]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:29.610]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:32.373]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.373 --> 01:07:36.057]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:36.057 --> 01:07:36.857]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.857 --> 01:07:41.002]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:41.002 --> 01:07:45.767]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:46.047 --> 01:07:50.211]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.211 --> 01:07:52.013]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:52.013 --> 01:07:54.255]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:54.255 --> 01:07:56.877]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:56.877 --> 01:08:06.827]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:18.859]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:22.621]  I am here on the road in Dallas, Texas.
[01:08:22.621 --> 01:08:32.926]  I want to encourage all of you out there to be sure and come out tonight to the Dallas Federal Reserve, five to eight o'clock.
[01:08:32.926 --> 01:08:33.626]  And if you can,
[01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:36.973]  To stay out there.
[01:08:36.973 --> 01:08:38.315]  Even if you've got a nearby hotel.
[01:08:38.315 --> 01:08:44.043]  Because I know folks that have families and things.
[01:08:44.043 --> 01:08:48.590]  It's hard to sit there and sleep out on the sidewalk or with a sleeping bag.
[01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:50.312]  Even if you rotate in and out.
[01:08:51.353 --> 01:08:53.896]  At night and during the day and then more people will come.
[01:08:53.896 --> 01:09:09.750]  We need to occupy this Fed here in Dallas to get even more media attention and make sure that Ben Bernanke and all the rest of them, the head of the Dallas Fed, has come out today saying that he's in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street people.
[01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:11.851]  Not with the end of the Fed people.
[01:09:12.702 --> 01:09:14.985]  We are the in the Fed, folks.
[01:09:14.985 --> 01:09:21.914]  And it's time that we show that it's not about being liberal, it's not about being conservative, it's about being an American who wants your republic back.
[01:09:23.339 --> 01:09:29.062]  And that we're tired of this private offshore banking dictatorship that has hijacked our country.
[01:09:29.062 --> 01:09:33.444]  Now, Rand Paul came out today, and later if we have time we'll play part of it.
[01:09:33.444 --> 01:09:35.445]  It's again up at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:09:35.445 --> 01:09:37.326]  It's our story from Infowars.com.
[01:09:37.326 --> 01:09:42.708]  Rand Paul, Obama's rhetoric could turn occupied protest violent.
[01:09:42.708 --> 01:09:43.589]  And that's what I've said.
[01:09:44.629 --> 01:09:56.653]  The system wants a French Revolution, where the globalists can sit offshore and have a collectivist revolution to go after anybody who has wealth, anybody that has created jobs.
[01:09:56.653 --> 01:10:01.735]  A collectivist banker putsch to shut down the American system once and for all.
[01:10:01.735 --> 01:10:09.077]  The crony capitalist arch-enemy, as the founder of the Rockefeller dynasty said, competition is a sin.
[01:10:10.859 --> 01:10:15.605]  And so right now there's a battle over which way reforms are going to go in this country.
[01:10:15.605 --> 01:10:17.528]  The road the globalists want to take you?
[01:10:17.528 --> 01:10:22.594]  Where they just blame Wall Street and the free market and the federal reserves and solidarity with the demonstrators?
[01:10:24.682 --> 01:10:36.606]  Or the road of actually targeting the private Federal Reserve that owns the military industrial complex that has set up this corporate world government and is attempting to destroy our Republic and every other free nation on the planet.
[01:10:36.606 --> 01:10:49.750]  Now I want to be clear, just because Ben Bernanke and the head of the Dallas Fed and George Soros and Al Gore and Barack Obama have come out and endorsed Occupy Wall Street, that is their attempt to
[01:10:51.417 --> 01:10:55.218]  Basically like a guy trying to get a date to pick up the girl at the bar.
[01:10:55.218 --> 01:10:56.818]  She's got to say no.
[01:10:56.818 --> 01:11:00.919]  That's their attempt to say, we're with you, we love you.
[01:11:00.919 --> 01:11:09.681]  Okay, at one level to co-opt it, but at another level to make conservatives and libertarians go, ooh, that must be a bunch of communists.
[01:11:09.681 --> 01:11:11.581]  No, I've had reporters all over the country.
[01:11:11.581 --> 01:11:13.242]  I want to report to you.
[01:11:13.242 --> 01:11:17.602]  The George Soros move on people have not been successful.
[01:11:17.602 --> 01:11:19.323]  They have not been successful.
[01:11:20.283 --> 01:11:22.766]  Most of the people there have got their heads screwed on.
[01:11:22.766 --> 01:11:24.008]  They know what's happening.
[01:11:24.008 --> 01:11:31.357]  The media likes to go in, though, and show a bunch of people that aren't quite focused and don't know what they want to make them look confused.
[01:11:31.357 --> 01:11:34.201]  And then cut to, well, these people got it together.
[01:11:34.201 --> 01:11:36.063]  They want higher taxes and free everything.
[01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:38.311]  Now, we're working on getting Lyndon LaRouge on.
[01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:40.671]  We're having some type of connection issue.
[01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:41.472]  We do have him now.
[01:11:41.472 --> 01:11:44.353]  Aaron Dykes is riding shotgun with us.
[01:11:44.353 --> 01:12:02.559]  We're only going to have Lyndon here for about 30 minutes, then I promise we're going to go to your phone calls, people that are patiently holding, and Bob Chapman's going to be popping in, and G. Edward Griffin as well towards the end, and then we're going to have G. Edward Griffin back on tonight with an ever-before-seen interview we did earlier in the week for InfoWars Nightly News, 7 p.m.
[01:12:02.559 --> 01:12:03.239]  Central.
[01:12:03.239 --> 01:12:05.320]  If you believe in this type of information,
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:11.905]  Please become subscribers at PrisonPlanet.tv because you're truly supporting the growth of the alternative media.
[01:12:11.905 --> 01:12:15.488]  Look what we're able to do now with reporters in multiple cities.
[01:12:15.488 --> 01:12:16.549]  We're here in Dallas.
[01:12:16.549 --> 01:12:33.323]  We're here launching an operation to target the actual central bankers, the actual crony capitalist monopoly insiders, instead of just a general occupy Wall Street, capitalism's evil, free market's evil, raise taxes to pay it in austerity money to foreign bankers.
[01:12:34.323 --> 01:12:38.064]  Now, Aaron Dykes, anytime you want, pop in with questions for Lyndon LaRouche.
[01:12:38.064 --> 01:12:39.385]  He needs no introduction.
[01:12:39.385 --> 01:12:48.948]  I've studied his material for about 16 years, and I cannot disagree with his analysis of how the world works, who is behind the power structure.
[01:12:49.748 --> 01:12:55.413]  A former director of the CIA called him the best private intelligence analyst organization out there.
[01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:57.295]  Of course, that's the LaRouche Organization.
[01:12:57.295 --> 01:13:02.820]  You can disagree, I guess, with, at least I do, with some of their solutions.
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:12.049]  But regardless of that, out of all the hundreds of economists and historians we interview, he's in the top two or three of his accuracy.
[01:13:12.569 --> 01:13:24.436]  And analyzing the Super Congress a few months ago with us and where all this would go and now the admission that it's worse than the Great Depression and housing and spiraling out of control and everything that's happening.
[01:13:24.436 --> 01:13:27.758]  Lytton LaRouche, thank you so much for joining us, sir.
[01:13:27.758 --> 01:13:36.423]  Bottom line, give us your executive summary on exactly what happened three weeks ago with Occupy Wall Street, who they are,
[01:13:37.243 --> 01:13:51.872]  And the attempt by the Federal Reserve inner cartel to co-opt it, in my view, and trick the people into calling for austerity to be paid to the very culprits of our predicament.
[01:13:51.872 --> 01:13:53.533]  Well, of course this is an old story.
[01:13:53.533 --> 01:13:54.954]  It went through several phases.
[01:13:54.954 --> 01:13:57.976]  What we're looking at now is the result of what happened in 2007.
[01:13:59.975 --> 01:14:11.821]  When the bailout process really started, it actually ran openly in 2008, but it was already running in 2007 at the end of September of that year.
[01:14:11.821 --> 01:14:19.345]  So we now are in a breakdown crisis of the entire international system, that is the transatlantic system.
[01:14:19.345 --> 01:14:23.107]  And there is no cure for this in the ordinary way.
[01:14:23.107 --> 01:14:26.609]  This thing is going, we're going dead on the water.
[01:14:27.612 --> 01:14:33.577]  And you can't say exactly what date, because a lot of things can be done to adjust things in the short term.
[01:14:33.577 --> 01:14:35.698]  But essentially, we've reached the limit.
[01:14:35.698 --> 01:14:37.560]  This thing is coming down.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.082]  Now, the solutions are fairly obvious.
[01:14:40.082 --> 01:14:42.624]  We have to go to Glass-Steagall first.
[01:14:42.624 --> 01:14:45.166]  But I think we have to get Obama out first.
[01:14:45.166 --> 01:14:48.808]  Now, I don't think that situation is impossible now.
[01:14:48.808 --> 01:14:50.770]  Obama is extremely unpopular.
[01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:57.295]  Even some of the press has been going after him on interviews, in a way which treats him as dead meat, politically.
[01:14:58.095 --> 01:15:00.495]  And I think he's pretty close to that right now.
[01:15:00.495 --> 01:15:00.956]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:00.956 --> 01:15:02.536]  In fact, you talked about this months ago.
[01:15:02.536 --> 01:15:08.197]  Now we have the Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, every day calling for him to basically step down.
[01:15:08.197 --> 01:15:14.278]  What did you make of him trying to embrace Occupy Wall Street yesterday in that speech?
[01:15:14.278 --> 01:15:24.640]  And what did you make of the fact that so many people are now basically deserting him?
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.480]  And then his statement of, well,
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:30.062]  I haven't prosecuted bankers because what they did was legal.
[01:15:30.062 --> 01:15:40.470]  Well, yeah, this very group of bankers changed the law and got rid of Glass-Steagall to allow themselves to commit crimes, but we've had the government say black people aren't humans before, and it's the law.
[01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:51.258]  Hitler said he was allowed to put people in death camps because it was the German... But it shows that it's still illegal to pass a law to be able to do something that's illegal under common law.
[01:15:52.549 --> 01:15:55.791]  Yeah, the problem here is this thing is really coming down now.
[01:15:55.791 --> 01:15:57.693]  And Obama is down.
[01:15:57.693 --> 01:16:00.535]  You'll find that a lot of the press is down on him, too.
[01:16:00.535 --> 01:16:02.096]  Which means the signal's out.
[01:16:02.096 --> 01:16:04.998]  This guy is politically deadbeat.
[01:16:04.998 --> 01:16:07.840]  How it's going to work out is not exactly certain.
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.282]  What is needed is the Glass-Steagall.
[01:16:10.282 --> 01:16:16.106]  Without this reform, and this isn't going to be enough, we're going to have to go to a credit system.
[01:16:16.106 --> 01:16:19.709]  That's the only way we can get enough jobs, productive jobs.
[01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:20.830]  Not the so-called fake jobs.
[01:16:21.505 --> 01:16:23.145]  But enough to start rebuilding the U.S.
[01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:24.366]  economy.
[01:16:24.366 --> 01:16:26.586]  We're going to have to do it quickly.
[01:16:26.586 --> 01:16:28.847]  We have very little time to waste.
[01:16:28.847 --> 01:16:33.208]  We have options, but it's highly dangerous.
[01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:44.070]  And at the last minute, virtually, when the buildings are about to go off in flames, people have now changed their mind and decided they're going to fight against Obama and fight against the kind of things he represents.
[01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:52.432]  And so he's spinning that and running with open arms towards people that have woken up to him in a desperate way to co-opt it.
[01:16:52.432 --> 01:16:54.413]  But I'm on the ground, sir.
[01:16:54.413 --> 01:16:56.013]  I'm not seeing that working.
[01:16:56.013 --> 01:17:13.878]  So I want to get into where you see this going for Obama, what the Anglo-American establishment will do versus some of your ideas of instead of giving tens of trillions to foreign bankers, they hoard this credit system to defibrillate the economic heart.
[01:17:15.489 --> 01:17:20.671]  That's a very simple thing to do from a standpoint of technicalities.
[01:17:20.671 --> 01:17:26.313]  And I think we have now a real surge inside the U.S.
[01:17:26.313 --> 01:17:26.793]  population.
[01:17:26.793 --> 01:17:39.277]  You've got to look at the, you know, the 80% of the population, of the voting population, which has tended to vote against both Republicans and Democrats who they suspected of being sympathetic to what Obama represents.
[01:17:39.277 --> 01:17:40.497]  That's where it stands now.
[01:17:40.497 --> 01:17:42.638]  And what's happened, you've seen now the press itself
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.502]  Let me stop you for just a moment, sir.
[01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:13.296]  Is the mainstream organs of establishment mouthpieces like
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:32.563]  Like Wall Street Journal, like Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, telling him to step down.
[01:18:32.563 --> 01:18:35.705]  Is that so they get a new puppet to con people?
[01:18:35.705 --> 01:18:45.430]  Or is that members of the establishment realizing the system coming down is probably going to destroy them as well, and is that desperate floundering?
[01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:49.892]  Do the banksters think they're in control of things, or has it reached panic level?
[01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:54.495]  Because I'm seeing real signs now of panic, and that's even more scary.
[01:18:56.627 --> 01:19:00.009]  There is, but first of all, there's qualified panic.
[01:19:00.009 --> 01:19:03.312]  There's an effort to get this guy out.
[01:19:03.312 --> 01:19:13.239]  Now we've had, you know, up to 80% of the actually voting people have tended to vote against both Republicans and Democrats who went with Obama.
[01:19:13.239 --> 01:19:16.681]  That was earlier in September.
[01:19:16.681 --> 01:19:19.343]  Now we're getting an actual breakdown crisis.
[01:19:19.343 --> 01:19:22.745]  They cannot go any further with this bailout.
[01:19:22.745 --> 01:19:25.067]  The bailout effort would blow everything out.
[01:19:25.934 --> 01:19:28.756]  We have international, all kinds of things that are going on.
[01:19:28.756 --> 01:19:31.418]  I say right now we're on the edge.
[01:19:31.418 --> 01:19:34.860]  There's a highly popular motivation out there.
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:36.501]  Hold on, we're going to skip this break, guys.
[01:19:36.501 --> 01:19:38.403]  We're going to skip this network break.
[01:19:38.403 --> 01:19:40.384]  I'm telling Genesis that right now.
[01:19:40.384 --> 01:19:40.985]  Okay?
[01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:42.606]  Sorry, Lyndon, go ahead.
[01:19:42.606 --> 01:19:43.406]  Okay.
[01:19:43.406 --> 01:19:45.468]  We're actually in a breakdown crisis.
[01:19:45.468 --> 01:19:51.552]  And the only thing that'll work is, there's several things that we have to understand what the positive measures are that will work.
[01:19:51.552 --> 01:19:54.374]  The first thing you've got to do, you've got to get this president out of there.
[01:19:55.057 --> 01:20:04.359]  Because with the cowardice among the politicians, despite what some of them are saying these days, they don't have the stamina to buck this guy, really.
[01:20:04.359 --> 01:20:06.380]  And he has to be bucked, absolutely.
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:08.540]  His whole program has to go.
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:10.981]  Otherwise, you cannot save the United States.
[01:20:10.981 --> 01:20:17.502]  Now, if you can get him under control, in the process of being impeached or something like that, you can control it.
[01:20:17.502 --> 01:20:18.902]  At least temporarily.
[01:20:18.902 --> 01:20:21.183]  If you then enact Glass-Steagall,
[01:20:21.952 --> 01:20:23.753]  Again, the new version.
[01:20:23.753 --> 01:20:26.995]  It's the same thing as before, but it's a new version.
[01:20:26.995 --> 01:20:30.817]  You will solve the problem by bringing it under control.
[01:20:30.817 --> 01:20:41.063]  But you have to realize we have a huge mass of worthless paper which has been dumped on the United States as the other nations in this bailout process of the past several years.
[01:20:41.863 --> 01:20:44.305]  So we don't have much leg room to move.
[01:20:44.305 --> 01:20:50.090]  We need to get a real employment program, that is a production program, not just... Okay, let's go back then.
[01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:59.119]  We bring back in Glass-Steagall, doesn't let them create derivatives anymore, which then destabilizes and creates uncertainty in the entire financial universe.
[01:20:59.119 --> 01:21:05.845]  We write off the fraudulent debt of these megabanks and want to triage it into some other financial institution.
[01:21:05.845 --> 01:21:06.645]  How do you do that?
[01:21:06.645 --> 01:21:07.086]  Then let's get...
[01:21:07.998 --> 01:21:08.938]  There's only one thing you can do.
[01:21:08.938 --> 01:21:12.759]  You go with Glass-Steagall, yes, that'll solve the problem in one sense.
[01:21:12.759 --> 01:21:15.160]  It'll bring the thing under control.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:21.262]  But you will have the Wall Street crowd and the London crowd and so forth will take Abbas beyond belief.
[01:21:21.262 --> 01:21:23.142]  They're going to lose heavily.
[01:21:23.142 --> 01:21:29.024]  But the problem is, with Glass-Steagall, we will do the right thing, but can we do enough of the right thing?
[01:21:29.679 --> 01:21:32.340]  We've got to put people back to work rather fast.
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:33.781]  I mean, real production.
[01:21:33.781 --> 01:21:34.782]  Fast.
[01:21:34.782 --> 01:21:36.683]  It's going to be a hard job.
[01:21:36.683 --> 01:21:39.104]  We're going to have to have more credit in the system.
[01:21:39.104 --> 01:21:46.067]  So we're going to have to create a credit system of the type that the United States did in the first Constitution.
[01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:50.349]  Which is how we got out of the mess we were in at the end of the war.
[01:21:50.349 --> 01:21:51.470]  We're going to have to do that.
[01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:55.272]  We're going to have to launch some large programs and high-gain programs.
[01:21:56.003 --> 01:21:59.803]  And these programs will actually allow us to get into a recovery mode.
[01:22:00.695 --> 01:22:02.916]  Look at how they're getting rid of NASA.
[01:22:02.916 --> 01:22:09.640]  I mean, building projects, bridges, NASA, Maglev, what are some of the other examples?
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:14.042]  And if people say this as socialists, I'm here debating different programs.
[01:22:14.042 --> 01:22:19.004]  The point is we've already given tens of trillions to foreign banks that goes nowhere paying off derivatives.
[01:22:19.004 --> 01:22:21.966]  You know, the point is they've already killed our free market.
[01:22:21.966 --> 01:22:26.928]  There's got to be some way to put people back to work instead of just going on welfare rolls.
[01:22:26.928 --> 01:22:28.469]  Might as well give them a job is what you're saying.
[01:22:29.286 --> 01:22:33.107]  No, we won't even give them welfare, the way it's going down.
[01:22:33.107 --> 01:22:35.628]  That's what's going down.
[01:22:35.628 --> 01:22:42.670]  So what we have is a situation where the federal government must take responsibility for what it's responsible for.
[01:22:42.670 --> 01:22:48.912]  The federal government, the private interests, are not compelled to serve the public interest.
[01:22:48.912 --> 01:22:53.954]  They're compelled to try to do what they can in their own judgment and in their own interest.
[01:22:53.954 --> 01:22:57.215]  But we need a large program like what Roosevelt did,
[01:22:57.992 --> 01:22:59.793]  We need it on a large scale.
[01:22:59.793 --> 01:23:02.235]  NAWAPA is one of the key drivers.
[01:23:02.235 --> 01:23:05.677]  We have to reform our system as a credit system.
[01:23:05.677 --> 01:23:09.520]  We have to build up a banking system of the proper type.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:20.748]  Now, we've got to get high technology jobs in there and we've got to start bringing the population back in to the direction of high quality production.
[01:23:20.748 --> 01:23:22.129]  We also have an option.
[01:23:22.924 --> 01:23:28.647]  With what's going on with Russia and China and some other countries today in the Pacific region.
[01:23:28.647 --> 01:23:36.831]  We have the market and ability to launch one of the biggest programs of recovery that's ever been done.
[01:23:36.831 --> 01:23:38.511]  It's potentially available to us.
[01:23:38.511 --> 01:23:41.633]  It's going to take some years to get the thing really successful.
[01:23:41.633 --> 01:23:48.116]  But we can act immediately to stabilize the present situation and reverse some of the evil trends that are killing people.
[01:23:48.661 --> 01:23:54.643]  Okay, we're talking to Lyndon LaRouche right now, and we're going to give you the websites in a moment.
[01:23:54.643 --> 01:23:59.125]  And regardless if you like his solutions or not, I like some of it.
[01:23:59.125 --> 01:24:02.426]  I just don't know if it was ever doable, and there's always the danger of this.
[01:24:02.426 --> 01:24:04.807]  But we already are at the point of total collapse.
[01:24:05.387 --> 01:24:12.291]  Lyndon, my issue here is you talk about high technology programs that have led the world, that made America great.
[01:24:12.291 --> 01:24:19.675]  Look at just Apple with some well-deployed, well-marketed trinket technology that was already out there.
[01:24:19.675 --> 01:24:20.636]  They were just good at marketing.
[01:24:23.353 --> 01:24:25.295]  Why are they destroying their own military command base?
[01:24:50.572 --> 01:24:53.294]  Well, they're doing it because that's what they're like.
[01:24:53.294 --> 01:25:00.458]  Essentially, it's like... Look, what happened was, you had... We were about to go to war in Indochina.
[01:25:00.458 --> 01:25:03.499]  The President, President Kennedy, opposed that.
[01:25:03.499 --> 01:25:04.600]  He opposed it flat.
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.041]  With Douglas MacArthur on it.
[01:25:07.041 --> 01:25:09.062]  So suddenly, Kennedy is killed.
[01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:10.283]  Now, what happened?
[01:25:10.283 --> 01:25:15.446]  Not only did we get into a war, which ruined us for about 10 years, a war in the Indochina area,
[01:25:16.167 --> 01:25:26.930]  And that ruined us permanently, because Kennedy, who'd opposed that war, and who had a large industrial development program in there, was killed.
[01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:36.853]  And the killing of Kennedy resulted in the cancellation of the glass... of the glass steel... the WAPA program.
[01:25:36.853 --> 01:25:38.674]  The WAPA was on the board.
[01:25:38.674 --> 01:25:41.614]  Bobby Kennedy was going to go for it, too.
[01:25:41.614 --> 01:25:43.495]  If we'd gone with the WAPA at that time,
[01:25:44.255 --> 01:25:49.457]  We'd have solved our problem and maintained the dynamic that we were getting into in the beginning of the 1960s.
[01:25:49.457 --> 01:25:56.198]  Well, he was also moving to nationalize the Fed and start issuing interest-free U.S.
[01:25:56.198 --> 01:25:58.859]  money, at least to the government.
[01:25:58.859 --> 01:26:00.140]  But that's different.
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:02.320]  That's actually a credit system.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:02.880]  Yes.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:06.441]  That's been done before in war and other kinds of emergencies.
[01:26:06.441 --> 01:26:08.222]  And it's correct to do it as long as it's the right program.
[01:26:09.388 --> 01:26:11.230]  But this is the situation.
[01:26:11.230 --> 01:26:22.721]  Once Kennedy was killed, and then his brother Bobby too, this assassination ensured this long war, like this long pattern of long wars we've been going into ever since.
[01:26:23.706 --> 01:26:26.809]  We've been bled to death by long wars.
[01:26:26.809 --> 01:26:34.737]  And the public hasn't been shown... So you're saying these finance capitalist parasites, crony, monopoly men, it's a tropism.
[01:26:34.737 --> 01:26:37.179]  They can't help but destroy everything.
[01:26:37.179 --> 01:26:37.900]  It's what they do.
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:40.502]  They don't build things, they wreck things.
[01:26:40.502 --> 01:26:42.985]  But you've got a political interest behind it, not just the money people.
[01:26:42.985 --> 01:26:45.587]  But the money people happen to be working for a kind of interest.
[01:26:45.587 --> 01:26:47.229]  They don't give a damn about the United States.
[01:26:48.038 --> 01:26:49.719]  They don't give a damn about the people.
[01:26:49.719 --> 01:26:52.220]  They want to reduce the population size.
[01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:58.343]  The British, for example, are insisting on reducing the world's population from about 7 billion people down to less than 1.
[01:26:58.343 --> 01:27:01.625]  And that's the kind of policy we're talking about.
[01:27:01.625 --> 01:27:05.827]  This is this whole kind of program going on.
[01:27:05.827 --> 01:27:09.249]  So we have to get a program going like Glass-Steagall.
[01:27:09.249 --> 01:27:15.472]  And Glass-Steagall is the kind of driver which can most quickly restore the United States... Okay, let me ask you this then.
[01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:19.412]  A, Mr. LaRouche, because I totally agree with you.
[01:27:19.412 --> 01:27:21.592]  Glass-Steagall, yeah, I mean, that's what got us into all this.
[01:27:21.592 --> 01:27:23.613]  That's what allowed them to do this.
[01:27:23.613 --> 01:27:25.693]  And Obama says, well, it was legal.
[01:27:25.693 --> 01:27:29.134]  Yeah, because you criminals got in to the government and changed the law.
[01:27:29.134 --> 01:27:30.454]  There was a reason this was illegal.
[01:27:30.454 --> 01:27:32.775]  It got us into 1929.
[01:27:32.775 --> 01:27:34.455]  How do we get Glass-Steagall back?
[01:27:34.455 --> 01:27:38.256]  I mean, you've said as the crisis gets worse and worse, we have a chance.
[01:27:38.256 --> 01:27:40.957]  But I don't hear Congress talking about bringing Glass-Steagall back.
[01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:46.297]  Well, you will find that we're getting close to the point that the votes will be there.
[01:27:46.297 --> 01:27:59.543]  The danger in not getting Glass-Steagall is the fact that as long as this president still has an account, he with his foreign partners will probably be able to jam up and prevent Glass-Steagall from being enacted at that time.
[01:27:59.543 --> 01:28:01.584]  So this fellow has got to be neutralized.
[01:28:01.584 --> 01:28:05.505]  He's not going to leave office at once, I don't think.
[01:28:05.505 --> 01:28:11.228]  But he's going to be jammed up by various kinds of legal action against him for what he's done.
[01:28:11.972 --> 01:28:21.182]  If he's neutralized in some significant degree, and I think he's on the way to that, that's what's happening with some of these turncoats who are suddenly backing against Obama now.
[01:28:21.182 --> 01:28:25.387]  But if we get him under control, we can get Glass-Steagall through.
[01:28:25.387 --> 01:28:27.249]  We almost have the votes for it now.
[01:28:28.101 --> 01:28:34.126]  Except if Obama is still president, as effectively president, it's going to be tough to get that vote through.
[01:28:34.126 --> 01:28:35.407]  We've seen what happened with that before.
[01:28:35.407 --> 01:28:37.248]  Okay, so Obama has to go.
[01:28:37.248 --> 01:28:40.210]  And you were saying this a year ago, six months ago, two months ago.
[01:28:40.210 --> 01:28:44.153]  Now the establishment's panicking so much, they're saying that.
[01:28:44.153 --> 01:28:45.855]  Mr. LaRouge, we're going to break here in a moment.
[01:28:45.855 --> 01:28:49.778]  I want to come back and talk about where we're going if we don't change course.
[01:28:49.778 --> 01:28:53.060]  And if we don't change course, what's the time frame?
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:54.181]  Start getting into that now.
[01:28:54.181 --> 01:28:55.322]  Where are we going?
[01:28:55.322 --> 01:28:57.544]  When you say collapse, what does that mean?
[01:28:58.539 --> 01:29:07.127]  I mean the general breakdown crisis of the transatlantic system, which will then become a crisis for the transpacific system.
[01:29:07.127 --> 01:29:10.690]  But the immediate threat now is that Europe is already going down the ditch.
[01:29:10.690 --> 01:29:13.573]  The United States is virtually on the ditch.
[01:29:13.573 --> 01:29:15.315]  If we don't reverse this immediately,
[01:29:16.078 --> 01:29:18.919]  We're going into a breakdown crisis.
[01:29:18.919 --> 01:29:21.320]  Not just a depression, I mean a breakdown crisis.
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.521]  It's all there.
[01:29:22.521 --> 01:29:32.765]  We also are inches away, with a lot of public support for this, for the kind of measures, of recovery measures, which we do know how to put into effect.
[01:29:32.765 --> 01:29:38.728]  But we need to have enough control, in terms of political control, to make sure that the necessary measures go through.
[01:29:39.252 --> 01:29:41.253]  All right, Leonard LaRouge, please, please stay there.
[01:29:41.253 --> 01:29:42.354]  We gotta go to break.
[01:29:42.354 --> 01:29:43.854]  Infowars.com is our website.
[01:29:43.854 --> 01:29:45.555]  We'll give you his when we come back.
[01:29:45.555 --> 01:29:48.156]  On the other side, Aaron Dyches, we'll have some questions for him as well.
[01:29:48.156 --> 01:29:50.177]  Then your calls.
[01:29:50.177 --> 01:29:51.578]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.578 --> 01:29:54.099]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.099 --> 01:29:56.781]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.334 --> 01:30:07.980]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:13.144]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:13.144 --> 01:30:21.871]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:21.871 --> 01:30:25.935]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:30:25.935 --> 01:30:28.297]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:34.943]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:30:34.943 --> 01:30:38.784]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:30:38.784 --> 01:30:40.004]  Others don't.
[01:30:40.004 --> 01:30:42.145]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:43.945]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:43.945 --> 01:30:46.826]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:30:46.826 --> 01:30:51.067]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:30:51.067 --> 01:30:53.447]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:30:53.447 --> 01:30:56.148]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:30:56.148 --> 01:30:58.509]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:30:58.509 --> 01:30:59.389]  Others don't.
[01:31:04.787 --> 01:31:06.068]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:06.068 --> 01:31:09.990]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:12.211]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:12.211 --> 01:31:18.094]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:18.094 --> 01:31:24.317]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.757 --> 01:31:30.702]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.702 --> 01:31:34.905]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening death to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.905 --> 01:31:39.209]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:39.209 --> 01:31:45.154]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:45.154 --> 01:31:48.717]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.717 --> 01:31:50.678]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.678 --> 01:31:51.119]  It's here.

[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.501]  Steve Shank here with a special alert from eFoods Direct.
[01:32:03.501 --> 01:32:06.622]  The stock market continues to crash and re-crash daily.
[01:32:06.622 --> 01:32:10.403]  Since July, the market has dropped 15% with no signs of recovery.
[01:32:10.403 --> 01:32:11.543]  What does that mean to you?
[01:32:11.543 --> 01:32:18.366]  When stocks crash, jobs are lost, and you can't buy the food that's already too expensive and continues to raise in cost.
[01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:24.047]  eFoods just got notice that wholesale costs on pasta, rice, and beans will immediately jump 20%.
[01:32:24.047 --> 01:32:26.288]  The already high cost of sugar is tripling.
[01:32:26.488 --> 01:32:34.677]  If you invest in the stock market for security or save money in the bank, you continue to see the dollar drop in value while your weekly food bills increase.
[01:32:34.677 --> 01:32:35.798]  So what are you going to do?
[01:32:35.798 --> 01:32:37.740]  Get as much food now as you can.
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:43.787]  With these problems you're facing, eFoodsDirect has no choice but to extend the free shipping another week to October 9th.
[01:32:44.207 --> 01:32:46.849]  Free shipping buys more food with shipping dollars.

[01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:50.851]  You can bet your life on efoods direct.
[01:33:22.205 --> 01:33:22.907]  Okay, folks.
[01:33:25.145 --> 01:33:26.126]  I want to ask you this question, sir.
[01:33:26.126 --> 01:33:29.267]  You've got the Occupy Wall Street people just criticizing free market capitalism, at least some of them.
[01:33:29.267 --> 01:33:31.849]  That's how the Federal Reserve is trying to steer it.
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:34:09.019]  Instead of pointing out that it's insiders operating that have created this, I'm calling for moves to actually occupy the private Federal Reserve and point out that it needs to be nationalized as Kennedy began to move towards doing or as Lincoln
[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:16.727]  Did with a similar system, as you know, at the time when the Rothschilds, you know, wanted outrageous amounts of interest for them to loan him money.
[01:34:16.727 --> 01:34:22.993]  He just said, I'll just issue government credit, which is what the banksters do and have built their world empire out of.
[01:34:22.993 --> 01:34:26.957]  Can you sum up for people out there what the Federal Reserve is?
[01:34:26.957 --> 01:34:33.264]  And if you agree with my plan to try to shift away from nebulous Wall Street,
[01:34:35.106 --> 01:34:44.495]  Well, first of all, we have to do Glass-Steagall.
[01:34:44.495 --> 01:34:47.558]  That's the first step.
[01:34:47.558 --> 01:34:50.782]  If you don't do Glass-Steagall, you cannot solve this problem.
[01:34:50.782 --> 01:34:52.063]  You can't manage it.
[01:34:52.063 --> 01:34:56.828]  If you put through Glass-Steagall, you don't have a problem, but you're halfway to solving it.
[01:34:57.594 --> 01:35:07.763]  What we have to go toward is a federal credit system, which is pretty much what we did in the coming out of the Revolutionary War, our victory there.
[01:35:07.763 --> 01:35:09.104]  It was built into the Constitution.
[01:35:09.104 --> 01:35:17.991]  Now the system of national banks, the first and second national bank of the United States, were the instruments by which the United States was saved.
[01:35:17.991 --> 01:35:24.857]  We get in a situation where we have to out our credit as such, signed off for by the federal government.
[01:35:25.549 --> 01:35:32.834]  This credit will be then used through banks and other things, through loans, which are going to build up our economy.
[01:35:32.834 --> 01:35:35.776]  Now, that's what we need to do.
[01:35:35.776 --> 01:35:44.462]  If we do that, we can get out of this mess by going to high technology projects as a policy, typified by NAWAPA.
[01:35:44.462 --> 01:35:51.507]  But we also have to take intermediate steps at the same time, which will get an unemployed population, an unskilled population.
[01:35:52.225 --> 01:35:55.487]  Back into the labor force as an active, productive, and strong labor force.
[01:35:55.487 --> 01:35:56.288]  I don't have the details.
[01:36:20.174 --> 01:36:23.556]  We'll take people there.
[01:36:23.556 --> 01:36:28.839]  Sir, we've had you on about solutions before and I appreciate your ideas and I agree with quite a bit of it.
[01:36:28.839 --> 01:36:35.784]  My only question here is the time frame, because you've been very accurate as of late predicting what would happen next.
[01:36:35.784 --> 01:36:36.944]  Where is Europe going?
[01:36:36.944 --> 01:36:47.391]  Will Germany put up with bankrolling this new economic union that's just a system for extracting the wealth of the people to the multinational banks?
[01:36:47.891 --> 01:36:49.472]  And where does that go in Europe?
[01:36:49.472 --> 01:36:56.698]  Because, you know, obviously Europe is connected to what's happening here in America in the whole transatlantic situation.
[01:36:56.698 --> 01:36:58.039]  It would go the other way.
[01:36:58.039 --> 01:37:00.621]  You have some movements, as in France.
[01:37:00.621 --> 01:37:06.045]  The former Prime Minister of France is moving in a useful direction.
[01:37:06.045 --> 01:37:09.307]  You have tendencies in various parts of Europe to do something.
[01:37:09.307 --> 01:37:13.791]  But, unless the United States acts first, Europe won't do it.
[01:37:14.767 --> 01:37:16.670]  So therefore, who's got to do it?
[01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:19.053]  Well, you'll get the Russia is doing something big.
[01:37:19.053 --> 01:37:20.374]  China's doing something big.
[01:37:20.374 --> 01:37:23.078]  That's going to be a significant factor of this thing.
[01:37:23.078 --> 01:37:27.363]  But the key thing is the United States must take the lead.
[01:37:27.363 --> 01:37:30.687]  We must get this guy under control.
[01:37:30.687 --> 01:37:31.108]  Get him out.
[01:37:32.105 --> 01:37:37.870]  We have to go back to the kind of program that Kennedy and company would appreciate.
[01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:40.572]  I understand that, sir, but this is my question.
[01:37:40.572 --> 01:37:41.813]  We know Obama's a puppet.
[01:37:41.813 --> 01:37:45.336]  We know he represents the corrupt elements of Wall Street.
[01:37:45.336 --> 01:37:48.478]  But isn't it like shark teeth?
[01:37:48.478 --> 01:37:51.401]  I mean, who rolls in behind Obama?
[01:37:51.401 --> 01:37:54.964]  And won't you just have a new puppet, but the same puppeteers?
[01:37:56.222 --> 01:37:57.583]  No, you won't.
[01:37:57.583 --> 01:38:03.788]  The only thing you could get in that direction would be an outright dictatorship.
[01:38:03.788 --> 01:38:06.431]  That's the only thing you'd get from that squawk.
[01:38:06.431 --> 01:38:08.853]  They are not capable of any bailout program.
[01:38:08.853 --> 01:38:11.555]  They're not capable of doing anything good.
[01:38:11.555 --> 01:38:17.800]  It's up to those in the institutions who recognize the United States has to be saved.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:20.042]  It has to be very rough and direct action.
[01:38:21.067 --> 01:38:25.008]  Because we've got a sick population that can't take any more of this.
[01:38:25.008 --> 01:38:27.108]  The whole system is on the verge of crashing.
[01:38:27.108 --> 01:38:30.849]  I mean, we could be talking tomorrow morning and find out there's no economy anymore.
[01:38:30.849 --> 01:38:33.550]  We're, Died Brock's gonna say that's gonna be the case.
[01:38:33.550 --> 01:38:37.431]  But I'm saying that's what could be the case at any time now.
[01:38:37.431 --> 01:38:40.272]  Our ship is going directly towards rocks.
[01:38:40.272 --> 01:38:45.773]  We've already hit some big ones, but we're going towards a rocky shoreline, there's no doubt.
[01:38:45.773 --> 01:38:50.674]  But if we put, get through Glass-Steagall, get it through, and get into a credit system operation,
[01:38:51.414 --> 01:38:55.215]  Use NAWAPA as a commitment that's going to dictate what we do.
[01:38:55.215 --> 01:38:59.917]  You're saying that will turn the ship, but then we've got to repair the holes.
[01:38:59.917 --> 01:39:02.958]  Actually, we know how to fix those holes.
[01:39:02.958 --> 01:39:03.898]  We've done it before.
[01:39:03.898 --> 01:39:06.279]  Look what Franklin Roosevelt did when he came in.
[01:39:06.279 --> 01:39:09.760]  Now this situation is worse, actually, than Franklin Roosevelt faced.
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:13.561]  But, the same method, the same approach will work.
[01:39:13.561 --> 01:39:15.762]  What you need is not jobs.
[01:39:15.762 --> 01:39:19.043]  What you need is real base building jobs.
[01:39:19.043 --> 01:39:20.944]  High technology jobs as much as possible.
[01:39:22.046 --> 01:39:22.566]  Well, I know this.
[01:39:49.113 --> 01:39:53.835]  The Democrats want to raise taxes which will put the country into a bigger cardiac arrest.
[01:39:53.835 --> 01:39:57.997]  They make it about taxing the rich when the big globalist rich are offshore and exempt.
[01:39:57.997 --> 01:40:05.319]  The mainline Republicans are like, just keep the banker bailouts going and corporate welfare is great and have a two trillion dollar total defense budget.
[01:40:05.319 --> 01:40:07.961]  That's going to bankrupt us and it goes nowhere.
[01:40:07.961 --> 01:40:16.084]  And so people can't criticize you calling for pure investment and call that socialism when the other two things we have are just sheer madness.
[01:40:16.824 --> 01:40:19.885]  You know, I would like to just see massive tax cuts.
[01:40:19.885 --> 01:40:23.586]  I'd like to see some basic fair tariffs put in place.
[01:40:23.586 --> 01:40:26.927]  I'd like to see our military pulled out of most of the bases.
[01:40:26.927 --> 01:40:30.448]  I'd like to see the Glass-Steagall reenacted.
[01:40:30.448 --> 01:40:35.729]  I'd like to see the quadrillion plus in derivatives written off.
[01:40:35.729 --> 01:40:39.270]  And sure, that would cause a... I mean, that's just common sense.
[01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:42.091]  I don't want to hear, though, from so-called conservatives
[01:40:42.671 --> 01:40:49.813]  All day about, well, we shouldn't have any investment or programs to get people working when they're just going to be on welfare anyways.
[01:40:49.813 --> 01:40:52.674]  And if you don't give them the welfare, they're going to burn the cities down.
[01:40:52.674 --> 01:40:58.256]  I mean, every direction we go down, more and more of our options are being shut down.
[01:40:58.256 --> 01:41:03.097]  And Lyndon, I'm not trying to be negative here, but I don't really see the establishment changing course.
[01:41:03.097 --> 01:41:06.098]  I know there's elements that think the wrecking of the ship
[01:41:07.278 --> 01:41:14.985]  Is the way they're going to fully take over the system, like we're some third world country that the IMF is imploding through the shock doctrine.
[01:41:14.985 --> 01:41:16.987]  But I don't think you're going to have the same effect.
[01:41:16.987 --> 01:41:19.209]  This is not a third world country they're wrecking.
[01:41:19.209 --> 01:41:20.750]  When they wreck the U.S.
[01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:28.296]  and the Euro, they wreck the entire globe, and we go into absolute hell, and we've got Israel running around talking about hitting Iran.
[01:41:28.296 --> 01:41:30.418]  I think they're going to try to start a big war.
[01:41:30.418 --> 01:41:32.160]  I think that's how they plan on getting out of this.
[01:41:33.515 --> 01:41:38.837]  That was a plan on their agenda, but I don't think it can work at this point.
[01:41:38.837 --> 01:41:41.177]  We are actually in a breakdown crisis.
[01:41:41.177 --> 01:41:45.739]  These guys who have been running this show have lost their nerve.
[01:41:45.739 --> 01:41:49.760]  They realize that they've got no bottom in their ship.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:42:01.503]  And the question is, if we've got the leadership inside the United States of leading responsible citizens, especially some in the Congress who will come out, I think under the proper conditions, will come out now,
[01:42:02.333 --> 01:42:05.756]  It's not to do the kinds of things that should have been done before.
[01:42:05.756 --> 01:42:09.198]  We have the agenda, which can actually fix this problem.
[01:42:09.198 --> 01:42:15.963]  It's not going to be a miracle solution, but it will seem like a miracle to people that have been going down the road the ways this has been going for the past years.
[01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:19.206]  We can actually rebuild this nation.
[01:42:19.206 --> 01:42:20.967]  We've done it before, we know how to do it.
[01:42:20.967 --> 01:42:21.868]  It's in the system.
[01:42:21.868 --> 01:42:23.209]  It's built into our system.
[01:42:23.209 --> 01:42:24.990]  Our system of government.
[01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:27.512]  And there's some options we have in the world at large.
[01:42:27.512 --> 01:42:29.053]  We can win.
[01:42:29.053 --> 01:42:31.015]  The question is, can we get enough people with the guts
[01:42:31.804 --> 01:42:36.326]  In leading positions, influential positions to the side, we're going to do it.
[01:42:36.326 --> 01:42:37.426]  We can save this nation.
[01:42:37.426 --> 01:42:38.747]  We can save it right now.
[01:42:38.747 --> 01:42:40.827]  And we don't have much time.
[01:42:40.827 --> 01:42:41.428]  I understand.
[01:42:41.428 --> 01:42:45.269]  Well, obviously next week sometime I'd like to get you back on.
[01:42:45.269 --> 01:42:48.170]  I'm back in studio to really go over your ideas for solutions.
[01:42:48.170 --> 01:42:53.972]  Then we're going to have some people on like Lou Rockwell to give a more Austrian economic view on it.
[01:42:53.972 --> 01:42:55.913]  But regardless, we know the direction we're going right now.
[01:42:55.973 --> 01:42:56.053]  No.
[01:43:17.293 --> 01:43:19.514]  We know the way we're going is destructive.
[01:43:19.514 --> 01:43:22.836]  Aaron Dykes, in closing, I know you've been waiting in the wings there.
[01:43:22.836 --> 01:43:24.557]  Do you have any questions or comments for Lionel Rouge?
[01:43:24.557 --> 01:43:26.699]  Then we're going to let him go and go to phone calls.
[01:43:26.699 --> 01:43:32.402]  Yeah, obviously I see the significance of bringing back Glass-Steagall, but I was wondering what he sees as the role of
[01:43:32.842 --> 01:43:37.725]  Right now, reality is, real money, I'm talking about money that's fungible, real money exists only in the hands of national governments.
[01:43:59.474 --> 01:44:00.875]  Including the United States.
[01:44:00.875 --> 01:44:05.438]  We may look poor, but all those bankers are bankrupt.
[01:44:05.438 --> 01:44:07.300]  All the big money guys are bankrupt.
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:08.801]  They're zombies!
[01:44:08.801 --> 01:44:16.166]  Yep, and therefore we, the United States government, control the ability of the government to create credit.
[01:44:16.166 --> 01:44:17.887]  Federal credit.
[01:44:17.887 --> 01:44:27.454]  The mobilization of federal credit for getting the economy working again is the most powerful force on this planet if we make it, if we do that.
[01:44:28.155 --> 01:44:29.496]  And that's the solution.
[01:44:29.496 --> 01:44:38.281]  Get federal credit mobilized for things that do work, and the federal government has to do it, because that's the only way this thing works.
[01:44:38.281 --> 01:44:46.425]  But we have to, by putting the Glass-Steagall through, we will wipe out Wall Street and the City of London.
[01:44:46.425 --> 01:44:51.048]  They cannot withstand a Glass-Steagall impact on their swindles.
[01:44:51.869 --> 01:45:00.292]  You're right, that's why they won't bring it back, even though it's the common sense thing, because it cuts off their power to create artificial money for themselves.
[01:45:00.292 --> 01:45:19.559]  Exactly, and only in a crisis of this type, where the American people and more and more members of the Congress and others are breaking out of the cage, they're willing to go now to a federal resort, a federal credit system, to get this country booming again.
[01:45:19.559 --> 01:45:20.479]  This is the time where
[01:45:21.181 --> 01:45:23.582]  We have the aces.
[01:45:23.582 --> 01:45:28.084]  What about things like the Dakotas, your state bank system as well?
[01:45:28.084 --> 01:45:29.345]  I mean, that's a microcosm.
[01:45:29.345 --> 01:45:32.406]  Those have worked quite nicely as well.
[01:45:32.406 --> 01:45:34.547]  But you need the power of federal credit.
[01:45:34.547 --> 01:45:37.748]  You can't rely upon just bank deposit credit.
[01:45:37.748 --> 01:45:41.410]  You have to rely on bank deposit credit for the banking system.
[01:45:41.410 --> 01:45:49.654]  But the real thing we need is we need a masses of federal credit, controlled federal credit, for large projects which will rebuild this economy.
[01:45:50.424 --> 01:45:53.046]  This is where the, as Roosevelt did in his time.
[01:46:19.355 --> 01:46:23.777]  All right, well, again, we're here trying to protest the Federal Reserve itself.
[01:46:23.777 --> 01:46:26.199]  And that is one of our demands.
[01:46:26.199 --> 01:46:29.840]  And people are saying, well, Alex, write down our demands.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:36.364]  I've given my ideas, but this is for you, also, to come to demonstrations, to tell the media what you want.
[01:46:37.608 --> 01:46:41.372]  You notice with the Occupy Wall Street group, there are people in there.
[01:46:41.372 --> 01:46:46.496]  I'd say 40-50% of them calling in the Fed who understand the problem.
[01:46:46.496 --> 01:46:49.719]  But the mainstream corporate media has not been interviewing them.
[01:46:49.719 --> 01:46:54.464]  Instead, they talk to people that just go, I want free healthcare, I want free this, I want free that.
[01:46:54.464 --> 01:46:55.805]  You don't get anything.
[01:46:56.926 --> 01:46:58.789]  Without industry and jobs.
[01:46:58.789 --> 01:47:01.413]  And then it's that job that then gets you those things.
[01:47:01.413 --> 01:47:02.956]  Because you're contributing to the economy.
[01:47:02.956 --> 01:47:06.041]  If we just go to a system where it's all free, everything collapses.
[01:47:06.041 --> 01:47:07.543]  I mean, it's just common sense.
[01:47:07.543 --> 01:47:09.105]  I can't believe people don't understand this.
[01:47:11.718 --> 01:47:19.160]  We are calling, as I did in Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, as I did with George Humphrey Economist, you know, 12 years ago when they got rid of it.
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:21.381]  I had him on, predicting everything that would happen.
[01:47:21.381 --> 01:47:28.563]  He wrote a book on it, Common Sense, copying the name Thomas Paine, of his book.
[01:47:28.563 --> 01:47:31.684]  I've tried my best to warn you about what was coming.
[01:47:31.684 --> 01:47:32.985]  And I agree with LaRouche.
[01:47:32.985 --> 01:47:38.527]  The globalists had the power, they had the chutzpah, the bravado, the hubris, they went with it.
[01:47:38.527 --> 01:47:38.947]  And now,
[01:47:40.097 --> 01:47:45.424]  It's creating something, a black hole, that's even going to destroy them.
[01:47:45.424 --> 01:47:50.151]  I think they're going past the phase of lying to themselves and saying they can control this.
[01:47:50.151 --> 01:47:50.852]  They got greedy.
[01:47:50.852 --> 01:47:53.616]  It's like Hitler turning into Russia to try to go beat Stalin.
[01:47:56.208 --> 01:47:57.869]  It's a fatal move by the globalists.
[01:47:57.869 --> 01:48:01.471]  They've bitten off more than they can chew, and they're taking us along with them.
[01:48:01.471 --> 01:48:06.374]  Now, in the next two segments, I promise we're going to go to your phone calls, but this is history happening right now.
[01:48:06.374 --> 01:48:22.824]  If you aren't going out to your Federal Reserve in your area and exposing that it's a fraud, and that it's the author of the scam, and that it's a Ponzi scheme, and that they're the problem, and that, hey, we know you're trying to co-opt Occupy Wall Street so you can call for socialism to make the public dependent.
[01:48:23.564 --> 01:48:25.206]  And pay yourself bailout money.
[01:48:25.206 --> 01:48:28.010]  If you're not doing this right now, you're crazy folks.
[01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:29.772]  This is the big fight.
[01:48:29.772 --> 01:48:31.874]  We the American people who understand what's happening...
[01:48:33.203 --> 01:48:37.086]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young, Asian, I don't care.
[01:48:37.086 --> 01:48:42.090]  All of you have got to come out now and speak out against the Federal Reserve.
[01:48:42.090 --> 01:48:43.491]  And I need you to come to Dallas.
[01:48:43.491 --> 01:48:48.754]  This is where we're really focusing our operation today, 5 to 8 o'clock.
[01:48:48.754 --> 01:48:52.277]  And then I'm going to go to Houston tomorrow, San Antonio the next day.
[01:48:52.277 --> 01:48:53.978]  It's all up at Infowars.com.
[01:48:53.978 --> 01:48:57.421]  But I need you to be here, and then I need you to stay a few days.
[01:48:58.021 --> 01:49:01.103]  And then others will come and replace you.
[01:49:01.103 --> 01:49:03.764]  It's like the financial Alamo here.
[01:49:03.764 --> 01:49:08.206]  And it doesn't mean we'll win this battle, but we're going to win this war.
[01:49:08.206 --> 01:49:09.207]  It's that simple.
[01:49:09.207 --> 01:49:11.368]  Aaron, what do you think of my basic strategy?
[01:49:11.368 --> 01:49:13.249]  I mean, it's just a no-brainer for me.
[01:49:13.249 --> 01:49:14.529]  It's just total common sense.
[01:49:14.529 --> 01:49:16.950]  It seems like anybody should understand this.
[01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:19.432]  You've got to identify the actual globalist.
[01:49:19.432 --> 01:49:21.192]  You've got to go to the head of the stake.
[01:49:21.192 --> 01:49:22.713]  And people need to be here.
[01:49:22.713 --> 01:49:24.234]  This is history that's about to happen.
[01:49:24.654 --> 01:49:35.337]  And I'm excited to see between 200 and 600, depending on which press report, yesterday out there at the Fed, and I noticed in the news today, they said that was basically triggered off of my call Sunday.
[01:49:35.337 --> 01:49:36.937]  Again, that shows the power of this.
[01:49:36.937 --> 01:49:39.818]  We show up in mass, Aaron, and people see that.
[01:49:39.818 --> 01:49:41.699]  It's gonna then domino effect.
[01:49:41.699 --> 01:49:45.640]  We gotta push this first domino over, and folks, it's tipping like this right now.
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:45.960]  Aaron?
[01:49:46.621 --> 01:49:49.984]  Yeah, and I'm very heartened by the momentum that's been built up.
[01:49:49.984 --> 01:50:02.617]  People starting to understand that the Fed needs to, at a bare minimum, be audited by an independent entity, not the stuff Herman Cain's talking about, about little minutiae inside baseball audits.
[01:50:02.617 --> 01:50:04.439]  Why don't you just call him up?
[01:50:04.439 --> 01:50:06.000]  Well, you did go to the Kansas City Fed.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.402]  He was the boss of it.
[01:50:07.402 --> 01:50:09.484]  They came off the property with guns and said, leave.
[01:50:09.963 --> 01:50:14.004]  Yeah, they said don't even look at the building, don't film it, even from other properties, public areas.
[01:50:14.004 --> 01:50:15.305]  Why don't you just call, Aaron?
[01:50:15.305 --> 01:50:20.026]  You ought to make a video about that, showing what happened to you and Rob, and then put the Herman Cain stuff in.
[01:50:20.026 --> 01:50:25.748]  Yeah, and it's not just that clip on Neil Borch, he's repeated that talking point at lots of speeches.
[01:50:25.748 --> 01:50:28.089]  Drop on by, we'll point guns at you!
[01:50:28.089 --> 01:50:32.030]  Yeah, now they pushed him to the forefront of the GOP, what they're offering.
[01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:35.931]  He's opened up a 20-point lead on closest rival now.
[01:50:37.526 --> 01:50:39.669]  Yeah, but what you were saying before, it's a no-brainer.
[01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:40.990]  We've got to look at the Fed.
[01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:47.337]  They're behind all this economic sabotage that's been going on, and it's time to hold that part accountable.
[01:50:47.337 --> 01:50:48.098]  Oh, it's incredible.
[01:50:48.098 --> 01:50:51.182]  You know, they're saying they want Chris Christie because he's obese.
[01:50:51.182 --> 01:50:52.403]  I mean, it's like just anything.
[01:50:52.403 --> 01:50:53.424]  Well, he looks different.
[01:50:53.424 --> 01:50:54.365]  Well, he looks different.
[01:50:54.365 --> 01:50:56.548]  But what do they stand for?
[01:50:56.548 --> 01:50:58.090]  Herman Cain, my gosh, he's horrible.
[01:51:00.925 --> 01:51:04.768]  If you're a man over 40, you may feel like half the man you used to be.
[01:51:04.768 --> 01:51:06.329]  Are you gaining more body fat?
[01:51:06.329 --> 01:51:07.690]  Are you feeling tired?
[01:51:07.690 --> 01:51:09.671]  Are you losing your sex drive?
[01:51:09.671 --> 01:51:10.792]  It's not your fault.
[01:51:10.792 --> 01:51:13.834]  After 40, your body's testosterone may start dropping.
[01:51:13.834 --> 01:51:15.716]  And if you're an African-American man,
[01:51:15.976 --> 01:51:19.857]  You're at a higher risk of your testosterone turning into estrogen.
[01:51:19.857 --> 01:51:21.378]  Be the man you used to be.

[01:54:13.146 --> 01:54:14.948]  Okay, my friends, we are back live.
[01:54:14.948 --> 01:54:21.155]  We're going to go to Dave, Gerald, Chris, and others that are patiently holding here ahead of Bob Chapman joining us, then Gia McGriffin.
[01:54:21.155 --> 01:54:29.363]  We're going to premiere an interview here and play the rest of it, of the taped interview coming up.
[01:54:31.519 --> 01:54:33.960]  This evening on the InfoWorks Nightly News.
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:38.322]  I don't know what, a caller will hold like 45 minutes and then right when I go to them they drop.
[01:54:38.322 --> 01:54:39.862]  So Dave just dropped.
[01:54:39.862 --> 01:54:41.403]  So we'll go to Gerald here in a moment.
[01:54:41.403 --> 01:54:43.824]  I just want to recap and restate this.
[01:54:43.824 --> 01:54:58.970]  You cannot underestimate how big a deal it is that the establishment knew by tracking everybody's email and listening to people's phones and having computers collate that that people were about to start rebelling against Wall Street to then kind of have some of their operatives kick it off.
[01:54:58.970 --> 01:55:00.131]  Then the public showed up
[01:55:01.352 --> 01:55:10.162]  Uh, and it became grassroots, so they tried to re-co-opt it, and now the Federal Reserve's saying how much they love it and how they're in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street.
[01:55:10.162 --> 01:55:12.885]  No, it's Occupy You, the Fed.
[01:55:12.885 --> 01:55:17.010]  That shows how incredibly desperate and pathetic they are.
[01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:17.351]  Aaron?
[01:55:18.609 --> 01:55:18.869]  I think?
[01:55:48.769 --> 01:55:54.116]  They are the crooks that did it, and then they're up there lecturing Wall Street as some general evil.
[01:55:56.024 --> 01:56:07.987]  Yeah, and now we're being offered people like Herman Cain of the Kansas City Federal Reserve as some kind of solution on the right, and Obama to target the middle class and quote, rich as some kind of solution on the left.
[01:56:07.987 --> 01:56:19.289]  You know Aaron, I know you've got a big show coming up tonight on Infowars Nightly News, but you ought to just, even though you're hosting it, just take that clip of Herman Cain saying, come on by, drop on by the Fed.
[01:56:20.369 --> 01:56:21.310]  I'm your friend!
[01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:22.830]  Drop by Kansas City!
[01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:30.893]  And then it shows the people a half mile away with their guns out saying, you know, with the guns on their side saying, get out of here, we're God, we're security guards, leave.
[01:56:30.893 --> 01:56:33.474]  Just to show how asinine that is.
[01:56:33.474 --> 01:56:37.315]  You know, Herman Cain says the Fed loves you, you know, something like that.
[01:56:37.315 --> 01:56:40.497]  Let's go to a phone call here, because now people will pay attention to that.
[01:56:40.497 --> 01:56:42.937]  Just shows how full of baloney that guy is.
[01:56:42.937 --> 01:56:45.498]  Gerald in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:46.759]  What do you think of all this craziness?
[01:56:47.475 --> 01:56:56.662]  Hey Alex, I think it's a great idea to occupy the Fed, and I plan on being there this evening along with you and other patriots in Dallas.
[01:56:56.662 --> 01:56:58.723]  Awesome, awesome.
[01:56:58.723 --> 01:57:08.991]  My wife, I think, will also join me, but I've got a couple of practical ideas for the patriots to maximize media effect.
[01:57:08.991 --> 01:57:14.515]  Unfortunately, I'm not going to have it in time, but I ordered some shredded U.S.
[01:57:14.515 --> 01:57:15.496]  fiat currency.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.740]  Which you can order.
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:20.241]  I order two five-pound bags.
[01:57:20.241 --> 01:57:24.863]  Oh yeah, instead of shredding your own money, you can order... I did that once at a U.S.
[01:57:24.863 --> 01:57:26.004]  Mint I visited.
[01:57:26.004 --> 01:57:28.265]  You can order bags of it real cheap and throw it around.
[01:57:28.265 --> 01:57:28.605]  Go ahead.
[01:57:28.605 --> 01:57:29.065]  Exactly.
[01:57:29.065 --> 01:57:35.388]  We ought to throw it at the Fed and say we're tired of your fiat worthless money.
[01:57:35.388 --> 01:57:37.008]  And that's the first ideal.
[01:57:37.008 --> 01:57:41.810]  The second ideal is I just finished watching V for Vendetta.
[01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:46.092]  And in that, you know, V, he wears a mask of Guy Fawkes.
[01:57:47.321 --> 01:57:59.509]  I think if we could obtain a large number of Ron Paul masks, that all the patriots that believe, along with Ron Paul, that the Fed should be ended, they ought to wear those to these events.
[01:58:00.792 --> 01:58:07.714]  And can you imagine the nightmare of the enemy looking outside and seeing thousands of Ron Pauls?
[01:58:07.714 --> 01:58:08.255]  That's it.
[01:58:08.255 --> 01:58:11.676]  I'm going to have Tim Fruge at the Impo War store.
[01:58:11.676 --> 01:58:16.257]  We are definitely going to get a Ron Paul mask made.
[01:58:16.257 --> 01:58:17.418]  I'm doing that.
[01:58:17.418 --> 01:58:18.258]  You are a genius.
[01:58:18.258 --> 01:58:20.158]  Anything else, sir?
[01:58:20.158 --> 01:58:24.080]  The Prophets could even go into the Ron Paul campaign to get him elected in 2012.
[01:58:25.563 --> 01:58:30.146]  Sure, but regardless, down the road, that image of Ron Paul, he's going to be part of history now.
[01:58:30.146 --> 01:58:30.706]  That's it.
[01:58:30.706 --> 01:58:33.028]  And we ought to make George Washington ones, too.
[01:58:33.028 --> 01:58:37.011]  And of course, we already have the Max Keiser action figure.
[01:58:37.011 --> 01:58:37.411]  Alright, sir.
[01:58:37.411 --> 01:58:37.951]  Great points.
[01:58:37.951 --> 01:58:39.032]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:58:39.032 --> 01:58:41.494]  Stay with us.
[01:58:41.494 --> 01:58:45.016]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.016 --> 01:58:47.138]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.993 --> 01:58:52.175]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:58:52.175 --> 01:58:59.104]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:59.104 --> 01:59:01.667]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:06.834]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:59:07.034 --> 01:59:10.076]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:59:10.076 --> 01:59:12.377]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:12.377 --> 01:59:18.641]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:18.641 --> 01:59:22.023]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:22.023 --> 01:59:27.807]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:27.807 --> 01:59:29.448]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:29.448 --> 01:59:30.748]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:30.748 --> 01:59:33.270]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:33.410 --> 01:59:37.632]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:59:37.632 --> 01:59:42.254]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:59:42.254 --> 01:59:44.835]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:59:53.899 --> 01:59:56.300]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.300 --> 01:59:59.022]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:10.553]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.553 --> 02:00:12.154]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.154 --> 02:00:13.694]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.694 --> 02:00:17.876]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.876 --> 02:00:21.958]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.033 --> 02:00:25.374]  All right, into hour number three.
[02:00:25.374 --> 02:00:28.236]  Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster joining us.
[02:00:28.236 --> 02:00:37.203]  We're going to air part of an interview that we'll air the rest of that hadn't been seen yet tonight on InfoWars Nightly News with Jared Griffin on Occupy Wall Street, Occupy the Fed idea and more.
[02:00:37.203 --> 02:00:41.206]  We'll continue with calls for the next 40 minutes or so with Bob Chapman getting in the economy.
[02:00:41.206 --> 02:00:44.128]  Again, riding shotgun as my second, as they would say,
[02:00:44.608 --> 02:00:44.828]  I don't
[02:01:00.532 --> 02:01:01.773]  Oh, it's genius, Alex.
[02:01:01.773 --> 02:01:10.363]  And remember, you know, I never have caught on how historically accurate it is, but you know the Spartacus revolt from the movie, where everybody starts saying, I am Spartacus.
[02:01:10.363 --> 02:01:11.264]  That was really a slave revolt.
[02:01:11.264 --> 02:01:11.765]  Yeah, tell the story.
[02:01:11.765 --> 02:01:15.189]  They're trying to find out where he is, and everybody says, I'm Spartacus, I'm Spartacus.
[02:01:15.469 --> 02:01:26.376]  Yeah, they're out in the countryside after Spartacus and the others had the slave revolt escape from their system of being gladiatorial slaves to the Roman Empire.
[02:01:26.376 --> 02:01:28.538]  And they're in the countryside, where is Spartacus?
[02:01:28.538 --> 02:01:30.819]  And they all start saying, I'm all Spartacus.
[02:01:30.819 --> 02:01:34.121]  That means, at least the idea behind it, we're all for freedom.
[02:01:34.121 --> 02:01:35.843]  None of us are your slaves.
[02:01:35.843 --> 02:01:37.684]  And Ron Paul is a great symbol of that.
[02:01:37.684 --> 02:01:42.687]  And I also wonder, when is Ron Paul himself going to start saying Herman Cain is a fraud?
[02:01:42.687 --> 02:01:44.068]  He's not the Tea Partier.
[02:01:44.068 --> 02:01:45.469]  He's part of the system we're trying to destroy.
[02:01:46.770 --> 02:01:52.533]  Well, Ron Paul turned his guns under pressure, because he's such a gentleman.
[02:01:52.533 --> 02:02:02.138]  But in this war, discretion is not the better part of valor, or as one of Ron Paul's icons said, sometimes silence isn't golden, it's yellow.
[02:02:02.138 --> 02:02:07.982]  And I'm not saying Ron Paul's been silent, he's been a great patriot against tyranny and had great courage, but he went after Perry.
[02:02:08.362 --> 02:02:13.128]  And ran the ads, pointing out the Al Gore cheerleader stuff and the socialist healthcare.
[02:02:13.128 --> 02:02:14.429]  He started to go after Romney.
[02:02:14.429 --> 02:02:15.570]  It's destroying them both.
[02:02:15.570 --> 02:02:23.159]  I mean, you attack them, doesn't matter how much corporate money they get, their records are so bad, people go, these guys both support carbon taxes?
[02:02:23.159 --> 02:02:24.140]  They love Al Gore?
[02:02:25.141 --> 02:02:28.242]  They go to Bilderberg Group, it's over.
[02:02:28.242 --> 02:02:33.424]  And you've got to go after Herman Cain and say, you want a new sales tax on top of the income tax?
[02:02:33.424 --> 02:02:35.565]  To pay our share to the bankers?
[02:02:35.565 --> 02:02:37.286]  You say the Federal Reserve is good?
[02:02:37.286 --> 02:02:39.946]  He is the enemy!
[02:02:39.946 --> 02:02:43.888]  He is the Federal Reserve's slick-talking candidate.
[02:02:43.888 --> 02:02:49.010]  I mean, Herman Cain is the neocon version of Barack Obama.
[02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:51.671]  And again, people are like, well, he's black.
[02:02:51.671 --> 02:02:52.852]  I see a lot of white conservatives.
[02:02:52.852 --> 02:02:53.732]  Maybe he'll fix it.
[02:02:53.732 --> 02:02:58.575]  You know, we've tried with old white guys, and it's like liberals thought that with Obama.
[02:02:58.575 --> 02:03:02.276]  I actually saw an article last week where they said, well, Chris Christie doesn't look presidential.
[02:03:02.276 --> 02:03:04.778]  You know, he looks like he weighs 500 pounds.
[02:03:04.778 --> 02:03:06.018]  Not against folks that are overweight.
[02:03:06.018 --> 02:03:09.200]  We've all been there one time or another, at least some of us have.
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:18.005]  The point is, just because somebody looks like Grimace from a McDonald's commercial doesn't mean he's suddenly going to be good because he's a fat guy or because he's a black guy.
[02:03:18.005 --> 02:03:18.545]  He worked.
[02:03:18.885 --> 02:03:24.009]  He was at the number two, the number three most powerful fed position.
[02:03:24.009 --> 02:03:25.570]  He's CFR.
[02:03:25.570 --> 02:03:26.630]  I'm sorry, Aaron, go ahead.
[02:03:26.630 --> 02:03:28.552]  I'm going to go to the call in a minute.
[02:03:28.552 --> 02:03:29.672]  Well, it's just disgusting.
[02:03:29.672 --> 02:03:37.698]  It's time to realize that because you had a lot of extremely well-meaning people who identified a lot of the real problem in that Tea Party movement.
[02:03:37.698 --> 02:03:40.060]  It had a lot of important momentum.
[02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:47.265]  It was truly grassroots for many years until it was totally co-opted and just rebranded to steer the establishment GOP.
[02:03:47.925 --> 02:03:48.946]  In a new direction.
[02:03:48.946 --> 02:03:49.966]  And they're all frauds.
[02:03:49.966 --> 02:03:52.307]  All of them have tried to identify with that.
[02:03:52.307 --> 02:03:58.330]  And now they don't even really associate people like Ron Paul with the Tea Party, which he has every right to say he helped found.
[02:03:58.330 --> 02:04:02.011]  His supporters were in fact the ones who founded that movement, Alex.
[02:04:02.011 --> 02:04:02.512]  You're right.
[02:04:02.512 --> 02:04:03.652]  I agree.
[02:04:03.652 --> 02:04:05.193]  We all have to be Ron Paul.
[02:04:05.193 --> 02:04:08.614]  Show up at the Fed and the other places and say we're not your slaves.
[02:04:08.614 --> 02:04:09.255]  I totally agree.
[02:04:09.986 --> 02:04:16.248]  Yeah, and I think really a manifestation of that, kind of the V for Vendetta mask, is the tricornered hat.
[02:04:16.248 --> 02:04:17.789]  It means 1776.
[02:04:17.789 --> 02:04:21.270]  And I've talked about 1776 worldwide.
[02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:24.571]  Now I'm seeing books coming out and people talking about 1776 worldwide, 1776 global.
[02:04:24.571 --> 02:04:25.472]  You know, the reawakening of 1776.
[02:04:25.472 --> 02:04:25.972]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:04:25.972 --> 02:04:28.573]  When things get bad, we don't want to follow down the globalists.
[02:04:38.928 --> 02:04:40.709]  Okay, we are going to be back in just a moment.
[02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:41.950]  Bob Chapman coming up.
[02:04:41.950 --> 02:04:44.191]  More from Alex Jones on the other side.
[02:04:44.191 --> 02:04:44.832]  Stay tuned.
[02:04:44.832 --> 02:04:46.192]  InfoWars.com.
[02:04:46.192 --> 02:04:47.093]  In the Fed.
[02:04:47.093 --> 02:04:47.373]  Now.
[02:05:02.498 --> 02:05:07.184]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:05:07.184 --> 02:05:13.631]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:05:13.631 --> 02:05:15.894]  Number one, study the past.
[02:05:15.894 --> 02:05:18.297]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:05:18.297 --> 02:05:22.021]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:05:23.143 --> 02:05:26.226]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:05:26.226 --> 02:05:30.070]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:05:30.070 --> 02:05:35.115]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:05:35.115 --> 02:05:38.539]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:05:39.119 --> 02:05:42.523]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:05:42.523 --> 02:05:47.027]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:05:47.027 --> 02:05:51.952]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:05:51.952 --> 02:05:56.576]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:05:56.576 --> 02:05:58.738]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:06:02.054 --> 02:06:06.078]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:06.078 --> 02:06:09.321]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.321 --> 02:06:14.125]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:14.125 --> 02:06:20.511]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.511 --> 02:06:22.754]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:23.294 --> 02:06:24.775]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:06:24.775 --> 02:06:26.056]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:26.056 --> 02:06:28.298]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:42.188 --> 02:06:44.311]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:06:44.311 --> 02:06:49.478]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:06:49.478 --> 02:06:58.590]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:02.523 --> 02:07:06.484]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:06.484 --> 02:07:15.345]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:15.345 --> 02:07:19.966]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:19.966 --> 02:07:30.788]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:31.428 --> 02:07:40.937]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:40.937 --> 02:07:46.362]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:46.362 --> 02:07:53.869]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:53.869 --> 02:07:56.271]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:06.474]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.474 --> 02:08:08.780]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:16.317 --> 02:08:18.099]  All right, my friends, we are back live.
[02:08:18.099 --> 02:08:20.161]  Bob Chapman is waiting in the wings.
[02:08:20.161 --> 02:08:30.190]  We're going to him momentarily, and I promise we're going to Chris and Jason and others that are patiently holding.
[02:08:30.190 --> 02:08:36.576]  And I should punch up my computerized phone system, but I scribbled this and I can't even read my own writing 20 minutes later.
[02:08:36.576 --> 02:08:38.338]  Who's after Chris there in order?
[02:08:41.363 --> 02:08:46.167]  We're going to go Marine here in just a moment and then we'll continue with Bob into the economy.
[02:08:46.167 --> 02:08:49.570]  But I want to get started with Bob Chapman, but I know Bob also likes taking calls.
[02:08:49.570 --> 02:08:58.437]  Bob Chapman, what do you think of our idea to, instead of just having Michael Moore and George Soros try to co-opt the Occupy Wall Street movement,
[02:08:58.937 --> 02:09:08.744]  And have the head of the Federal Reserve, Bernanke, the head of the Dallas Fed, we're about to demonstrate against here in a few hours, come out and say he's in solidarity and supports Occupy Wall Street.
[02:09:08.744 --> 02:09:15.729]  And they need to raise taxes on rich people, which they mean middle class, and pay it in banker bailouts to him.
[02:09:15.729 --> 02:09:23.894]  I mean, this is incredibly transparent, and I see it as a desperate move that Obama is trying to lick the boots of Occupy Wall Street.
[02:09:23.894 --> 02:09:25.715]  And Rand Paul says they want to whip it in.
[02:09:26.556 --> 02:09:44.002]  To not a 1776 revolution like we had, but kind of a French Revolution, while George Soros sits offshore and sees some color revolution where people run around blaming capitalism for what's happened, when we've had the opposite under the Federal Reserve.
[02:09:44.002 --> 02:09:46.843]  Well, how about the financing?
[02:09:46.843 --> 02:09:47.064]  Yes.
[02:09:47.064 --> 02:09:48.184]  Where's all the money coming from?
[02:09:50.475 --> 02:09:51.416]  That's another good question.
[02:09:51.416 --> 02:10:02.082]  What's your overall view on the Occupy Wall Street phenomenon and what's happening in the deteriorating markets and our idea to try to shift this over to the real enemy, the Fed?
[02:10:02.082 --> 02:10:04.584]  Well, the original idea is we're good.
[02:10:04.584 --> 02:10:14.429]  And then all of a sudden we find out we have a group of retreads from the 60s and 70s who are socialists and Marxists, etc.
[02:10:14.429 --> 02:10:18.492]  And, you know, the kind of money that they have is large.
[02:10:19.278 --> 02:10:23.101]  And so, was George Soros responsible for that?
[02:10:23.101 --> 02:10:23.462]  Probably?
[02:10:39.614 --> 02:10:40.115]  Exactly.
[02:10:40.115 --> 02:10:50.684]  You know, I think the idea really should be, and I think the opportunity is there, is to neutralize this movement.
[02:10:50.684 --> 02:10:54.087]  And I saw in the films I've seen,
[02:10:54.847 --> 02:11:01.909]  That there are a number of people who are not socialists and further to the left.
[02:11:01.909 --> 02:11:08.190]  And some of them are complainants that they've lost their jobs and their businesses and so on and that's understandable.
[02:11:08.190 --> 02:11:18.552]  And then you have people exposing the same things that you are on radio and I am and others about the real way to go on this.
[02:11:21.793 --> 02:11:28.260]  Exposition of what they put forward as their answers looks like it was written by Karl Marx.
[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:31.403]  I mean, I can't believe they were dumb enough to do that.
[02:11:31.403 --> 02:11:40.392]  That is the people who have usurped the movement and now we have other conservative people moving in and telling a different story.
[02:11:40.392 --> 02:11:41.393]  And I think if more
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:47.409]  middle-of-the-road and conservative people where to attend.
[02:11:47.409 --> 02:11:52.378]  I think they could neutralize and perhaps even take over the movement that's in motion.
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:54.341]  No, no, that's the answer.
[02:11:54.341 --> 02:12:03.284]  I've seen some people criticize activists like Mr. Penzella, who have gone out there to try to wake up some of the socialists.
[02:12:03.284 --> 02:12:06.145]  And people are saying, don't hang around with those people.
[02:12:06.145 --> 02:12:07.706]  Number one, we've had reporters all over.
[02:12:07.706 --> 02:12:09.247]  It's a very diverse group.
[02:12:09.247 --> 02:12:17.590]  What's happening is the mainstream media is skewing who they interview to make it look like it's a bunch of Michael Moore, capitalism is the problem people.
[02:12:17.590 --> 02:12:19.051]  And now there's a full attempt
[02:12:19.531 --> 02:12:23.875]  By Obama and the rest of them to take it over, but it's a desperate attempt.
[02:12:23.875 --> 02:12:28.279]  And that's why we're shifting to occupy the Fed, Bob, and it's wildly successful.
[02:12:28.279 --> 02:12:30.782]  I know you track the news all over the country.
[02:12:30.782 --> 02:12:37.068]  People are already by the hundreds going and demonstrating and staying at the Federal Reserve and it's getting huge attention.
[02:12:37.068 --> 02:12:41.652]  And so the Federal Reserve head here in Dallas this morning, where I'm about to be demonstrating in a few hours,
[02:12:41.912 --> 02:12:47.617]  Came out and said, I'm with you, I agree it's bad, but didn't say Federal Reserve and the crony insiders.
[02:12:47.617 --> 02:12:48.958]  He said Wall Street.
[02:12:48.958 --> 02:12:49.979]  I mean, what a joke.
[02:12:49.979 --> 02:13:02.609]  You've got the Federal Reserve that represents the big six megabanks and the SEC that preys on the rest of real Wall Street and free market up here now lecturing us and saying, you know, he's with the protesters.
[02:13:02.609 --> 02:13:06.893]  That is a desperate, desperate attempt to say, you know, if you can't beat him, join him.
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:14.596]  Well, I think the long-term view of the, we'll call them socialists, and their apparatus,
[02:13:18.097 --> 02:13:25.939]  I think the direction they were going in was to have these demonstrations throughout the country.
[02:13:25.939 --> 02:13:40.224]  And I think that eventually what they wanted to have was confrontation with law enforcement, violence, and that would give the administration the opportunity to bring in martial law.
[02:13:41.445 --> 02:13:44.974]  I'm guessing, but I think that's where they want to go with this thing.
[02:13:44.974 --> 02:13:46.538]  And we've got to stop them from doing that.
[02:13:46.538 --> 02:13:48.603]  We don't want violence in America.
[02:13:48.603 --> 02:13:49.826]  We want to use the system.
[02:13:50.976 --> 02:13:54.719]  And if you don't use the system, you lose everything.
[02:13:54.719 --> 02:13:56.660]  Well, Rand Paul concurs with you.
[02:13:56.660 --> 02:14:18.714]  Our article's linked up at Drudge Report right now, where Rand Paul said that a lot of these groups remind him of the French mobs and the French Revolution that I was alluding to earlier, and that Obama endorsing the socialist angle of it is going to embolden people to violence, and that's the last thing we want, and you've got this North Carolina
[02:14:18.814 --> 02:14:24.359]  Well, I think that what it signals is that they think they're going to be able to move this movement forward.
[02:14:46.014 --> 02:14:52.597]  And they're hoping nobody's paying any attention to who the players are behind the scenes.
[02:14:52.597 --> 02:15:02.802]  And I have a report, which I sent to you, some 24 pages, of the backgrounds of some of these people.
[02:15:02.802 --> 02:15:08.085]  But when I first looked, I saw Bill Ayers, and I remember him, you know, in the streets in the 1960s and 70s.
[02:15:11.518 --> 02:15:16.644]  When I saw those kind of people involved, I knew it wasn't what it seemed to be.
[02:15:16.644 --> 02:15:27.534]  But when you... The Washington Post is a functioning information instrument of the CFR, etc.
[02:15:27.534 --> 02:15:33.841]  And you watch them, and they'll tell you which direction they'd like this thing to go.
[02:15:36.462 --> 02:15:38.204]  Well, there's two ways to look at it.
[02:15:38.204 --> 02:15:46.651]  The system is endorsing it to try to act like they're friends with it, or they're doing it to try to supercharge it and try to steer it.
[02:15:46.651 --> 02:15:50.614]  And I think it's basically a mix of both.
[02:15:50.614 --> 02:15:58.321]  Bob, I want to go to some phone calls here right now from folks that have been patiently holding, but I want to bring in the wild card, Aaron Dykes, who's riding shotgun with us today.
[02:15:58.321 --> 02:16:01.804]  Aaron, do you have any angles or points you'd like to raise or questions for Bob?
[02:16:03.064 --> 02:16:09.789]  I'm just excited that we're continuing to focus on the Federal Reserve and it's just very interesting the way they've begun to speak out.
[02:16:09.789 --> 02:16:20.758]  I think it's preemptive to knowing your action was coming and that so many of these Occupy Wall Street groups were already starting to focus on the Federal Reserve and as you mentioned they have not reported that in the media.
[02:16:20.758 --> 02:16:24.541]  I think that continues to be significant.
[02:16:24.541 --> 02:16:26.282]  You're absolutely right on that point.
[02:16:26.282 --> 02:16:26.843]  Let's go to
[02:16:33.038 --> 02:16:34.219]  Hey Alex.
[02:16:34.219 --> 02:16:36.000]  Hey buddy.
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.100]  Hey there, this is Chris.
[02:16:37.100 --> 02:16:41.883]  Excuse me, my voice is a little voiced from camping in the Fed all day yesterday.
[02:16:41.883 --> 02:16:48.726]  But this is Chris from San Antonio reporting on the Occupy Movement on behalf of Matthew Medina from We Are Change San Antonio.
[02:16:48.726 --> 02:16:52.388]  We had a great day of unity while we were protesting in the Fed yesterday.
[02:16:54.053 --> 02:16:57.055]  We were out there all day with Cody Harris and Matthew Medina.
[02:16:57.055 --> 02:17:01.797]  We had a huge banner identifying the real enemies being the Fed.
[02:17:01.797 --> 02:17:07.120]  We marched all through the city, ended up around the federal building, circled it several times.
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:08.680]  We're all in their grill.
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:13.203]  I mean, I had a 10-foot tall Ron Paul sign that I was holding up to the second-story windows.
[02:17:13.203 --> 02:17:17.365]  You can imagine the fear that brought in the banker's face when it came to the window.
[02:17:18.124 --> 02:17:20.986]  I mean it was just wonderful and I just got so many things I want to tell you.
[02:17:20.986 --> 02:17:25.529]  I want to make it quick though, but I tell you that it's really a wonderful thing that's going down there.
[02:17:25.529 --> 02:17:27.610]  It's very unified.
[02:17:27.610 --> 02:17:29.772]  The city is behind us 100%.
[02:17:29.772 --> 02:17:33.414]  The cops aren't snickering at us, they're smiling at us.
[02:17:33.414 --> 02:17:37.177]  Well, more than that, I mean the cops know the fellow deserves the problem.
[02:17:37.177 --> 02:17:39.198]  Again, because the name's a fraud, it's private.
[02:17:39.198 --> 02:17:42.660]  But also, they've been told to leave you alone.
[02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:44.702]  The cops in New York were paid by Jake...
[02:17:46.233 --> 02:17:47.814]  Morgan for explaining the night before.
[02:17:47.814 --> 02:17:51.136]  They directed Occupy Wall Street onto the Brooklyn Bridge.
[02:17:51.136 --> 02:17:52.197]  We have video of this.
[02:17:52.197 --> 02:17:54.599]  This is admitted to create an event.
[02:17:54.599 --> 02:17:55.720]  They beat the people up.
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:59.023]  It's not just that the cops have been given a green light to beat people up.
[02:17:59.023 --> 02:18:03.887]  It's that some of the demonstrators were told to be provocative so it would get attention.
[02:18:03.887 --> 02:18:07.189]  They don't want these Federal Reserve protests to get attention.
[02:18:07.189 --> 02:18:08.870]  That's why when I'm at the Fed
[02:18:09.691 --> 02:18:11.412]  The police are very nice.
[02:18:11.412 --> 02:18:13.574]  Unless you're there by yourself.
[02:18:13.574 --> 02:18:25.283]  In the case of the Kansas City Fed, where the guys were there, shot video, traveled a half mile away to a hilltop to a city park to videotape it, they drove in a car and came there with their guns and said, show us your license, but you're a private security guard.
[02:18:25.283 --> 02:18:25.743]  Show it.
[02:18:25.743 --> 02:18:26.944]  Put their hands on it.
[02:18:26.944 --> 02:18:28.806]  So it was kind of like a holdup, basically.
[02:18:28.806 --> 02:18:29.066]  It was a
[02:18:29.226 --> 02:18:38.694]  Official oppression outside the law, impersonating an officer, whatever you want to call it, and did, I guess, kind of a fake citizen's arrest and said, now leave.
[02:18:38.694 --> 02:18:43.137]  And the guys, you know, didn't want to cause a bigger confrontation, so they did.
[02:18:43.137 --> 02:18:45.559]  But that was because they were alone.
[02:18:45.559 --> 02:18:49.202]  So again, the enemy wants to play friendly right now.
[02:18:49.202 --> 02:18:52.164]  I'm not saying the cops are bad, but very exciting.
[02:18:52.164 --> 02:18:55.067]  And of course, I'm going to be in San Antonio Sunday at 10 a.m.
[02:18:55.067 --> 02:18:56.988]  at the private Federal Reserve Building.
[02:18:56.988 --> 02:18:58.810]  Any comments or questions for Bob Chapman?
[02:19:00.143 --> 02:19:01.364]  Uh, not necessarily for Bob.
[02:19:01.364 --> 02:19:06.348]  I just want to tell you though that we are looking forward, we're trying to really get the word out to get as many people out there between now and Sunday.
[02:19:06.348 --> 02:19:08.490]  We're really looking forward to having you out there.
[02:19:08.490 --> 02:19:12.734]  I want to tell you though that these people in this Occupy movement, we are aware of the co-opters.
[02:19:12.734 --> 02:19:13.714]  We are very aware of it.
[02:19:13.714 --> 02:19:17.498]  We've already identified the MoveOn guys that came in there.
[02:19:17.498 --> 02:19:19.539]  They're not making very good grounds though.
[02:19:19.539 --> 02:19:23.463]  I mean, we are educated to this and when we identify them, we point them out.
[02:19:23.463 --> 02:19:25.184]  They're not succeeding in co-opting.
[02:19:25.184 --> 02:19:25.725]  What do they do?
[02:19:25.725 --> 02:19:26.665]  Do they show up and just go, uh?
[02:19:27.967 --> 02:19:29.930]  I mean, what do they say?
[02:19:29.930 --> 02:19:30.991]  How do you identify them?
[02:19:34.383 --> 02:19:36.524]  Well, they try to pick people up individually.
[02:19:36.524 --> 02:19:40.186]  They'll pull them off to the side and ask them, hey, why don't you move on?
[02:19:40.186 --> 02:19:42.187]  And, you know, talking all this.
[02:19:42.187 --> 02:19:45.569]  You know, I can't verify that 100 percent... Hold on, I want to hear more of this.
[02:19:45.569 --> 02:19:47.370]  Well, no, they admit the move-on people have been sent in.
[02:19:47.370 --> 02:19:48.591]  Stay there.
[02:19:48.591 --> 02:19:50.252]  We're going to come back and get Bob Chapman's take on this.
[02:19:50.252 --> 02:19:51.893]  See, that's what I'm getting, Bob.
[02:19:51.893 --> 02:19:54.134]  All over the country, the move-on people are failing.
[02:19:54.134 --> 02:19:56.916]  They're going, socialism, commie, get the guns!
[02:19:56.916 --> 02:19:59.377]  And people are going, get out of here!
[02:19:59.377 --> 02:20:00.178]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:00.178 --> 02:20:00.578]  Stay with us.
[02:20:02.807 --> 02:20:06.169]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:20:06.169 --> 02:20:14.355]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[02:20:14.355 --> 02:20:19.459]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[02:20:19.659 --> 02:20:22.640]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[02:20:31.242 --> 02:20:31.942]  Question.
[02:20:31.942 --> 02:20:34.803]  When the next disaster strikes, will you be ready?
[02:20:34.803 --> 02:20:35.443]  Answer.
[02:20:35.443 --> 02:20:36.163]  Yes.

[02:21:07.645 --> 02:21:11.806]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[02:21:11.806 --> 02:21:17.568]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[02:21:17.568 --> 02:21:23.190]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[02:21:23.530 --> 02:21:30.092]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.

[02:22:00.356 --> 02:22:02.557]  What's been the problem with phone companies?
[02:22:02.557 --> 02:22:06.498]  High prices and contracts that lock you in for two years minimum.
[02:22:06.498 --> 02:22:08.619]  Not FreedomTelephones.com.

[02:23:31.045 --> 02:23:36.088]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[02:23:36.088 --> 02:23:41.412]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.

[02:23:55.441 --> 02:23:56.842]  MySafeDoor.com.
[02:23:56.842 --> 02:23:57.842]  That's MySafeDoor.com.
[02:24:07.529 --> 02:24:10.491]  I don't want no shackles, no shackles on me.
[02:24:10.491 --> 02:24:13.593]  I sit down with Big Brother.
[02:24:13.593 --> 02:24:14.975]  Don't want no shackles.
[02:24:14.975 --> 02:24:15.815]  And the Nashty.
[02:24:15.815 --> 02:24:17.496]  Don't want no shackles.
[02:24:17.496 --> 02:24:19.838]  Alright, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:19.838 --> 02:24:23.561]  That was a little bit of a Jimmy Vaughn bringing us in with his no shackles on me.
[02:24:23.561 --> 02:24:24.982]  We got some breaking news here.
[02:24:24.982 --> 02:24:27.143]  Turns out in the last 10-15 minutes while I was on air,
[02:24:28.324 --> 02:24:32.845]  The Dallas police have called our Austin offices.
[02:24:32.845 --> 02:24:42.208]  I'm here and they called up Janet at the front desk and we're saying to her, you're not planning anything violent, are you?
[02:24:42.208 --> 02:24:45.368]  And we want to know about this and where is Mr. Jones in Dallas?
[02:24:45.368 --> 02:24:46.889]  We want to know where he is right now.
[02:24:48.783 --> 02:24:49.824]  That's just amazing.
[02:24:49.824 --> 02:24:52.346]  I mean, they can get into their Threat Fusion Center database.
[02:24:52.346 --> 02:24:54.347]  They know what hotel we're at right now.
[02:24:54.347 --> 02:24:56.489]  We're overlooking the Federal Reserve here.
[02:24:56.489 --> 02:24:57.550]  You've got my videos.
[02:24:57.550 --> 02:25:00.192]  You've got my press releases.
[02:25:00.192 --> 02:25:02.573]  You've got our entire history.
[02:25:02.573 --> 02:25:05.576]  I've been here and protested the Fed before.
[02:25:05.576 --> 02:25:09.398]  Our listeners, hundreds and hundreds of them, protested the Fed yesterday.
[02:25:09.398 --> 02:25:09.759]  You know
[02:25:11.434 --> 02:25:12.375]  Let me put it this way.
[02:25:12.375 --> 02:25:13.897]  Are you planning anything violent?
[02:25:13.897 --> 02:25:15.119]  How about I call?
[02:25:15.119 --> 02:25:16.841]  It says Dallas Chief.
[02:25:16.841 --> 02:25:18.603]  And then they put us through to Sergeant Smith.
[02:25:18.603 --> 02:25:23.849]  And then we're supposed to talk to Lieutenant Sheed.
[02:25:23.849 --> 02:25:26.333]  And they want to know if we're planning to be violent.
[02:25:26.333 --> 02:25:26.653]  I don't know.
[02:25:26.653 --> 02:25:28.295]  Are you planning to be violent?
[02:25:28.295 --> 02:25:29.557]  No, we're not planning to be violent.
[02:25:30.322 --> 02:25:31.644]  Again, that's how they put it.
[02:25:31.644 --> 02:25:37.374]  You're not planning to barbecue children there today, are you, Dallas Police Department?
[02:25:37.374 --> 02:25:40.959]  You're not planning to inject PCP, are you?
[02:25:40.959 --> 02:25:43.784]  See, they throw it on you like you're bad.
[02:25:44.741 --> 02:25:48.083]  Dallas Police, you're not planning to sell cocaine there today, are you?
[02:25:48.083 --> 02:25:50.464]  Dallas Police, are you planning to abuse children there today?
[02:25:50.464 --> 02:25:52.965]  Dallas Police, do you beat your wife?
[02:25:52.965 --> 02:25:56.207]  See that little psychological thing they play on you?
[02:25:56.207 --> 02:25:58.749]  No, you know full well we have a press release.
[02:25:58.749 --> 02:26:02.971]  You know full well we're coming there to be non-violent and occupy the Fed.
[02:26:03.191 --> 02:26:04.292]  I'll be there three, four hours.
[02:26:04.292 --> 02:26:16.140]  I'm asking people to stay there, in and around it, off and on as much as they can from around the country, as I travel to other sites to draw attention to the real monetary problem that's destroying your future as well, police.
[02:26:16.140 --> 02:26:19.983]  So I'll be getting off air here when we go to this Jim McGriffin interview, and I will
[02:26:22.094 --> 02:26:26.941]  Call the police and check in with them, but they know full well.
[02:26:26.941 --> 02:26:30.687]  You know they did the same thing, but the army leaked this to us and others three years ago.
[02:26:30.687 --> 02:26:35.594]  They sent the army out and in the memo they said don't let them know your army.
[02:26:35.594 --> 02:26:36.555]  They may attack you.
[02:26:37.312 --> 02:26:41.174]  You know, it's like, it's like, don't talk to that neighbor, they may kill you.
[02:26:41.174 --> 02:26:43.115]  It's a way to demonize.
[02:26:43.115 --> 02:26:45.196]  So no, we're not going to be violent.
[02:26:45.196 --> 02:26:46.936]  Are you going to be?
[02:26:46.936 --> 02:26:52.379]  No, the answer is no, because you don't want attention brought on to the mafia bosses.
[02:26:52.379 --> 02:26:53.680]  We understand that.
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:58.522]  If it was a Soros operation and we were dupes, you'd crack our heads to get attention.
[02:26:59.636 --> 02:27:01.738]  But you wouldn't know that, you're compartmentalized.
[02:27:01.738 --> 02:27:04.680]  You wouldn't know why you were told to crack heads and follow orders.
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:09.685]  So you've been told to bring us probably iced tea on silver platters, haven't you?
[02:27:09.685 --> 02:27:11.667]  That's why, okay?
[02:27:11.667 --> 02:27:14.229]  Because this is the real enemy here.
[02:27:14.229 --> 02:27:19.153]  Okay, we're targeting the criminals, but I want them brought to justice through the law, okay?
[02:27:19.153 --> 02:27:21.716]  And we're there identifying them.
[02:27:22.376 --> 02:27:30.558]  Well, I think that it's intimidation, as usual, and trying to see if he'll go out there and do the kind of things they can beat your heads in for.
[02:27:49.324 --> 02:27:58.853]  And of course you're not going to do that, and they're trying to take it one step forward, and try to show you that they're in control, and that's okay.
[02:27:58.853 --> 02:28:00.774]  You just do what you're going to do, and just say look.
[02:28:00.774 --> 02:28:05.459]  Well yeah, because I'm not getting your stinking permits, I don't need one.
[02:28:05.459 --> 02:28:07.921]  It's called the First Amendment.
[02:28:07.921 --> 02:28:10.643]  Yeah, they want to call up and see if they can scare me.
[02:28:10.643 --> 02:28:13.866]  All that does is make me just wish I was doing this even more.
[02:28:13.866 --> 02:28:15.448]  I'm not giving in to this anymore, Bob.
[02:28:17.128 --> 02:28:27.870]  Well, I don't think any of us should, and that's why people should be considering joining these Occupy Wall Street groups and saying, look, that's not right.
[02:28:27.870 --> 02:28:31.671]  We shouldn't be asking for those kind of changes.
[02:28:31.671 --> 02:28:33.731]  These are the kind of changes we need.
[02:28:33.731 --> 02:28:37.612]  Let's stop, start with getting rid of the Federal Reserve.
[02:28:37.612 --> 02:28:41.373]  I mean, they've been looting us for a hundred years, and it wasn't from there.
[02:28:42.281 --> 02:28:49.163]  I mean, the system can't believe we're actually looking past the puppets now and going right to the actual criminals.
[02:28:49.163 --> 02:28:59.365]  And we're trying to also go forward to identify what they really have to hear down the road.
[02:28:59.365 --> 02:29:04.827]  And I think that, to me, is violence and martial law.
[02:29:05.762 --> 02:29:16.406]  Well, I've had cops call me before, demonstrations before, just to say, hey, we just want to know what your route is and what roads we need to block, if any, and want you to stay on the sidewalk, you understand, blah, blah, blah.
[02:29:16.406 --> 02:29:17.047]  That's fine.
[02:29:17.047 --> 02:29:17.847]  I don't get mad at that.
[02:29:17.847 --> 02:29:21.448]  But when they call up going, you're not planning anything violent, are you?
[02:29:21.448 --> 02:29:26.110]  That's like calling them up and going, you're not planning to sell methamphetamine on the side of the street, are you?
[02:29:26.110 --> 02:29:29.071]  You know, it's just a way to demonize psychologically.
[02:29:29.071 --> 02:29:29.852]  I want to finish up.
[02:29:30.872 --> 02:29:43.302]  With Maureen, we haven't gotten to, and Chris, and at least Jason, and let Bob comment, and Aaron comment, and we're getting to part of a Gilbert Griffin interview on this whole issue, and we'll air the rest tonight, InfoWars Nightly News, 7 p.m., PrecisionPlanet.tv.
[02:29:43.302 --> 02:29:46.585]  I want to see everybody out here in Dallas tonight.
[02:29:46.585 --> 02:29:49.948]  Be there with Paul Revere, 21st Century, 1776 Worldwide.
[02:29:49.948 --> 02:29:54.451]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.451 --> 02:29:57.134]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.357 --> 02:30:02.538]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:30:02.538 --> 02:30:09.484]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:30:09.484 --> 02:30:12.026]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:30:12.026 --> 02:30:17.410]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:30:17.410 --> 02:30:20.452]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:30:20.452 --> 02:30:22.514]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:30:22.754 --> 02:30:29.020]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:32.383]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:32.383 --> 02:30:38.168]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:30:38.168 --> 02:30:39.830]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:41.111]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:41.111 --> 02:30:43.793]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:43.793 --> 02:30:45.215]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:30:45.435 --> 02:30:45.836]  We're good to go.
[02:31:00.956 --> 02:31:05.498]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.498 --> 02:31:06.418]  Number one.
[02:31:06.418 --> 02:31:09.840]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.840 --> 02:31:10.700]  Number two.
[02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:15.582]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.582 --> 02:31:16.322]  It's true.
[02:31:16.322 --> 02:31:21.205]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.205 --> 02:31:22.025]  Number three.
[02:31:22.025 --> 02:31:25.606]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.606 --> 02:31:29.308]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.528 --> 02:31:30.309]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.309 --> 02:31:33.072]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:33.072 --> 02:31:36.756]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.756 --> 02:31:37.557]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.557 --> 02:31:41.702]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.702 --> 02:31:46.467]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.747 --> 02:31:50.911]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.911 --> 02:31:52.713]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.713 --> 02:31:54.955]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:31:54.955 --> 02:31:57.317]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:01.030 --> 02:32:03.892]  Steve Shank here with a special alert from eFoods Direct.
[02:32:03.892 --> 02:32:07.033]  The stock market continues to crash and re-crash daily.
[02:32:07.033 --> 02:32:10.815]  Since July, the market has dropped 15% with no signs of recovery.
[02:32:10.815 --> 02:32:11.956]  What does that mean to you?
[02:32:11.956 --> 02:32:18.760]  When stocks crash, jobs are lost, and you can't buy the food that's already too expensive and continues to raise in cost.
[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:23.703]  eFoods just got notice that wholesale costs on pasta, rice, and beans will immediately jump 20%.
[02:32:24.403 --> 02:32:24.643]  I think so.
[02:32:44.235 --> 02:32:44.415]  I'm good.
[02:33:13.499 --> 02:33:17.243]  Alright, we are back live and starting at around 5 p.m.
[02:33:17.243 --> 02:33:35.163]  I said officially 6 to 8 because previously I was going to stay in Austin, do the first few hours of the radio show, drive up to the event, but then my mother called and pointed out, you know it's Texas OU weekend, there'll be a lot of traffic on I-35, so we went ahead and came up the night before, but I'm looking out at the traffic here downtown, there's really
[02:33:35.703 --> 02:33:36.503]  Nothing.
[02:33:36.503 --> 02:33:41.905]  So everybody get in here this evening and yes, we're going to be peaceful and nice.
[02:33:41.905 --> 02:33:51.569]  We're going to draw media attention as Dallasites and Texans did yesterday to the private Federal Reserve as Texans did in San Antonio as Bostonians did in Boston.
[02:33:52.849 --> 02:33:55.132]  As New Yorkers did in New York.
[02:33:55.132 --> 02:33:58.735]  And we're going to draw attention to these guys and point out they're the people running the show.
[02:33:58.735 --> 02:34:02.319]  The insiders that get to create the money and use it for themselves.
[02:34:02.319 --> 02:34:05.442]  And then put us into debt nationally for money they get.
[02:34:07.645 --> 02:34:08.526]  It's incredible.
[02:34:08.526 --> 02:34:21.301]  Now I wanted to finish up with Chris in Texas with Bob Chapman and then go to Maureen and Jason and that's it because I've got to go to this Gilbert Griffin interview and then Aaron will take us out of the show here and I'll see you all tonight at InfoWars Nightly News that Aaron's going to be hosting.
[02:34:21.301 --> 02:34:24.325]  We'll have reports on there, perhaps even live from the ground.
[02:34:24.325 --> 02:34:26.748]  We'll see what happens this evening.
[02:34:27.288 --> 02:34:31.990]  We couldn't do this, by the way, without the dedication of our incredible job they're doing.
[02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:38.213]  And you, the listeners, that buy the books, the videos, the DVDs, the PrisonPlanet.tv memberships, you are supporting this.
[02:34:38.213 --> 02:34:44.175]  Finishing up, Chris, down in San Antonio, what do you think of the, you're saying the cops are real nice to you in San Antonio.
[02:34:44.175 --> 02:34:48.817]  We went to break and I found out the Dallas police are calling our office a whole bunch of different ones.
[02:34:48.817 --> 02:34:51.198]  Lieutenants, sergeants, people calling themselves the chief.
[02:34:51.758 --> 02:34:56.421]  We've got the head of the Dallas Federal Reserve saying he loves us now, or whatever.
[02:34:56.421 --> 02:35:03.486]  So they're definitely circling the wagons, I guess for the bright lights of publicity.
[02:35:03.486 --> 02:35:07.849]  I believe the pen is mightier than the sword, and they profiled Alejandro Jones.
[02:35:07.849 --> 02:35:12.833]  They know this isn't violent, what's coming tonight.
[02:35:12.833 --> 02:35:14.094]  Unless they're hiring provocateurs.
[02:35:16.246 --> 02:35:17.407]  I think they must be scared of you.
[02:35:17.407 --> 02:35:29.153]  We'll see how they act Sunday when you get down here, because, uh, you know, I'm not saying so much that they were super nice to us, but, you know, you can just, they weren't being negative, and maybe they... Oh, the Dallas cops here three years ago were really nice.
[02:35:29.153 --> 02:35:30.454]  They told us they agreed with us.
[02:35:30.454 --> 02:35:31.955]  So that's, that's fine.
[02:35:31.955 --> 02:35:34.276]  This is the politician cops that are calling us.
[02:35:35.814 --> 02:35:36.975]  What do you think about this?
[02:35:36.975 --> 02:35:45.083]  The City Council and the Park Police have given us permission to occupy Hemisphere Park downtown and to literally set up camp.
[02:35:45.083 --> 02:35:46.204]  Stay there indefinitely.
[02:35:46.204 --> 02:35:54.893]  Again, they're giving you permission because you always had it under the First Amendment and they've been told by the establishment, revolution's coming, you better play nice.
[02:35:55.393 --> 02:35:57.394]  I think the best thing to do is be gentlemen and ladies.
[02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:25.843]  And just expound the truth and stay well within the confines of the law.
[02:36:25.843 --> 02:36:29.325]  And every time they look at you, give them a big smile.
[02:36:29.325 --> 02:36:31.826]  Yeah, I'm not even worried about that point.
[02:36:31.826 --> 02:36:37.309]  Quite frankly, there always will be some provocateurs, but whatever, I love it.
[02:36:37.309 --> 02:36:39.890]  That means we're winning when they resort to that.
[02:36:39.890 --> 02:36:44.852]  Okay, let's go to Maureen in, I guess that's Virginia.
[02:36:44.852 --> 02:36:45.973]  Thank you for holding so long.
[02:36:45.973 --> 02:36:47.053]  We've got a lot of breaking news.
[02:36:47.053 --> 02:36:47.794]  Welcome to the Airwaves.
[02:36:48.851 --> 02:36:49.872]  Thank you.
[02:36:49.872 --> 02:36:54.914]  I can now understand why our savior used a whip on the money changers.
[02:36:54.914 --> 02:36:58.416]  I would like to do the same, but that's not okay.
[02:36:58.416 --> 02:37:00.557]  Oh yeah, that's al-Qaeda.
[02:37:00.557 --> 02:37:01.598]  Of course.
[02:37:01.598 --> 02:37:04.339]  Anyway, do you know who Louis T. McFadden was?
[02:37:04.339 --> 02:37:07.821]  The congressman that was murdered after he gave us H.J.R.
[02:37:07.821 --> 02:37:08.242]  192 and public law 73?
[02:37:08.242 --> 02:37:08.342]  Yes.
[02:37:13.223 --> 02:37:20.110]  Okay, I've got a feeling we need to use what he gave us to get rid of the national debt.
[02:37:20.110 --> 02:37:22.572]  Our bodies have been monetized.
[02:37:22.572 --> 02:37:28.338]  The way to get rid of the national debt, it is owed to us, the people.
[02:37:28.338 --> 02:37:36.066]  When we were born, they turned us into all capital letter corporations, and they printed up Federal Reserve notes.
[02:37:36.911 --> 02:37:42.013]  Well, they do monetize us.
[02:37:42.013 --> 02:37:47.836]  We do pledge our bodies and our tax money to fund their whole system.
[02:37:47.836 --> 02:37:54.919]  You know, for those that haven't really read the Bible, Christ wasn't going after the priests for selling pigeons for sacrifice.
[02:37:54.919 --> 02:38:01.542]  He was going after them because they made you buy a special coin that was in limited circulation for like 20 times what it was worth to
[02:38:02.142 --> 02:38:07.006]  You had to buy that coin to then buy a sacrifice, whether it was a lamb, whatever the case was.
[02:38:07.006 --> 02:38:09.748]  And that was a form of money manipulation.
[02:38:09.748 --> 02:38:11.670]  And he went in and turned over the tables and beat them.
[02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:17.114]  But nowadays, the Dallas police would, you know what they do to Jesus, because he's bad, I guess.
[02:38:17.114 --> 02:38:18.275]  But we're not doing that here.
[02:38:18.275 --> 02:38:24.640]  We're just identifying, we're the Den of Vipers.
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:25.681]  Any other comments on that, ma'am?
[02:38:26.733 --> 02:38:34.139]  Yeah, if anybody listening knows about the original 13th Amendment, which basically was stolen.
[02:38:34.139 --> 02:38:38.502]  I know they got one archived in Richmond, Virginia.
[02:38:38.502 --> 02:38:46.028]  Basically, it said no one with the title of nobility, meaning esquire, meaning lawyer, can hold any
[02:38:47.284 --> 02:38:49.665]  Don't ask me, I'm old.
[02:39:16.491 --> 02:39:17.212]  I can't remember.
[02:39:17.212 --> 02:39:17.892]  I think it's a good point.
[02:39:30.257 --> 02:39:37.464]  People have to look within the whole situation in order to identify really what it's all about.
[02:39:37.464 --> 02:39:42.489]  Not only the case of the money changes, but all of the things we're talking about.
[02:39:42.489 --> 02:39:45.331]  What is subliminally underneath all of this?
[02:39:45.331 --> 02:39:46.673]  Where is this headed?
[02:39:46.673 --> 02:39:47.994]  Where are they trying to take it?
[02:39:50.279 --> 02:40:11.383]  And notice though, the people Christ was fighting 2,000 plus years ago, the people George Washington was fighting, the people Andrew Jackson was fighting, the people Louis T. McFadden and Lindbergh were fighting, is the very same type of system today.
[02:40:11.383 --> 02:40:12.623]  Absolutely.
[02:40:12.623 --> 02:40:17.524]  And you know, to an extent, it's the same cast of characters in families.
[02:40:17.524 --> 02:40:19.444]  And they've evolved through the centuries.
[02:40:20.362 --> 02:40:26.967]  And that's one of the things that most people don't know nor understand, that this is really nothing new.
[02:40:26.967 --> 02:40:36.415]  And now that we know how they did it before, when it was successful or unsuccessful, we can use that to stop them, and that's exactly what you're doing.
[02:40:36.415 --> 02:40:37.275]  Well, that's the secret.
[02:40:37.275 --> 02:40:44.721]  The globalists do study history, and they hope we don't ever look at it, because then the whole blueprint of how humans operate is right there.
[02:40:44.721 --> 02:40:45.502]  You get the playbook.
[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:47.861]  Exactly.
[02:40:47.861 --> 02:40:52.265]  And I repeat this over and over again.
[02:40:52.265 --> 02:40:57.949]  You and I and people like us need help in informing people of really what's going on.
[02:40:57.949 --> 02:41:05.476]  And so the people who are going to become engaged in that, and I hope there's lots of them, they should study history because it's very, very important.
[02:41:05.979 --> 02:41:10.762]  And very, very interesting and entertaining as well, in a horrific way sometimes.
[02:41:10.762 --> 02:41:16.006]  Final comments from Aaron Dykes, because we're going to talk to Jason for like a minute, and then go to the G.E.B.
[02:41:16.006 --> 02:41:19.948]  McGriffin thing, and then Aaron will take us out at the very end of the show today.
[02:41:19.948 --> 02:41:22.550]  But most of this segment's left, and the next segment will be the G.E.B.
[02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:25.672]  McGriffin interview, and the second unaired part tonight, 7 p.m.
[02:41:25.672 --> 02:41:29.815]  Central, will be at the end of the show on InfoWorks Nightly News at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:41:29.815 --> 02:41:34.518]  But any closing comments on Money Changers and what we were just talking about, Aaron?
[02:41:34.938 --> 02:41:42.523]  Yeah Alex, it is a larger system and I think the important thing today with Occupy the Federal Reserve is an education opportunity.
[02:41:42.523 --> 02:41:50.388]  It's a very good sign that many of the Occupy Wall Streeters, whatever their original reason for going down there is, are associating with the Federal Reserve people.
[02:41:51.128 --> 02:41:59.573]  But even if they are on the far left or whatever side, it's important to educate them that the Federal Reserve was the sort of wicked instrument of the bailout.
[02:41:59.573 --> 02:42:05.916]  They were the ones who absorbed secret trillions on their balance sheet, secretly gave to foreign banks.
[02:42:05.916 --> 02:42:16.062]  And it took people on the far left, like Bernie Sanders, to call out Bernanke, who had the audacity to say, no, Congress has no right to know on the floor of the House and everything, or the Senate rather.
[02:42:16.682 --> 02:42:40.627]  And I think we need to remind them of that as they roll out the predictable intimidation tactics because of course the pen is mightier than the sword and that's why they've used platforms like Facebook and Twitter in the Arab Spring but if you use it for the Federal Reserve to educate people there that's why they're cracking down profiling key bloggers and that's why they're calling up people like Alex Jones when they want to go down physically to the Federal Reserve and send a message.
[02:42:41.277 --> 02:42:42.237]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:42:42.237 --> 02:42:45.779]  We are non-violent because that's the best way we are trying to educate people.
[02:42:45.779 --> 02:42:50.500]  When I call the police, I'll call them back after the show ends here in a few minutes and then talk to them.
[02:42:50.500 --> 02:43:01.965]  We're here to be educational, but the only time Christ ever got violent in his whole life was with the bankers, with the money changers, with the manipulators, and he turned over tables and beat them
[02:43:02.745 --> 02:43:08.090]  In just a energetic rampage with a cat-or-nine-tail.
[02:43:08.090 --> 02:43:10.573]  Beat them with a whip, with a rope.
[02:43:10.573 --> 02:43:12.695]  I mean, what does that tell you right there?
[02:43:12.695 --> 02:43:13.395]  If you're a Christian.
[02:43:13.395 --> 02:43:15.357]  I mean, this is the evil.
[02:43:15.357 --> 02:43:17.419]  This is the parasitic system.
[02:43:17.419 --> 02:43:19.481]  This is it.
[02:43:19.481 --> 02:43:20.362]  This is the enemy.
[02:43:20.362 --> 02:43:24.265]  Not capitalism and free market and property rights.
[02:43:25.626 --> 02:43:29.127]  Uh, it's just incredible what they've turned us into.
[02:43:29.127 --> 02:43:31.927]  In closing, you're our tail gunner, Jason, in Texas.
[02:43:31.927 --> 02:43:33.207]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:43:33.207 --> 02:43:34.688]  Hey, how's it going today?
[02:43:34.688 --> 02:43:35.608]  Good, thanks for holding, sir.
[02:43:35.608 --> 02:43:36.628]  Welcome.
[02:43:36.628 --> 02:43:38.448]  Alright, I got one comment.
[02:43:38.448 --> 02:43:39.288]  Uh, I'm going to Dallas.
[02:43:39.288 --> 02:43:42.689]  I'm going to be there from Friday to, like, Sunday at midnight.
[02:43:42.689 --> 02:43:54.171]  Um, anybody that's going there that's got a copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island from Webster Griffin Tarpley, like, uh, Jeb or Griffin, bring it down and educate those at Occupy Dallas.
[02:43:54.818 --> 02:44:06.901]  With it, bookmark the highlights of the book, teach them about the Council on Foreign Relations, expose the money changers and the hierarchy of the governmental structure.
[02:44:06.901 --> 02:44:07.641]  Very well said.
[02:44:07.641 --> 02:44:14.482]  We're about to go to this G. Edward Griffin piece, but there's about a two-minute intro or a minute-long intro if you guys want.
[02:44:14.482 --> 02:44:16.483]  We'll just do it with the intro coming up.
[02:44:16.483 --> 02:44:17.723]  But those are great points, sir.
[02:44:17.723 --> 02:44:18.163]  Anything else?
[02:44:19.564 --> 02:44:20.526]  Um, nothing.
[02:44:20.526 --> 02:44:25.412]  All I've really got to say is that I support the WAPA program of Lyndon LaRouche.
[02:44:25.412 --> 02:44:27.655]  I think it's a good way to combat the eco-fascists.
[02:44:30.148 --> 02:44:31.269]  All right, we'll look into that.
[02:44:31.269 --> 02:44:38.055]  We're going to try to get some people from the other side of the debate within that spectrum.
[02:44:38.055 --> 02:44:41.158]  Maybe Lou Rockwell next week to look at that, but we'll also look at that program more.
[02:44:41.158 --> 02:44:42.239]  Thank you so much.
[02:44:42.239 --> 02:44:47.103]  You can get a free copy of the International Forecaster by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:44:47.103 --> 02:44:49.285]  That's the Midas Resources number.
[02:44:49.285 --> 02:44:52.328]  Just call and say, I want a free complimentary copy either mailed or emailed to you.
[02:44:52.968 --> 02:44:54.209]  And a new one comes out tomorrow.
[02:44:54.209 --> 02:44:54.549]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:44:54.549 --> 02:44:59.431]  You can also visit TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:44:59.431 --> 02:45:00.792]  Of course, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:45:00.792 --> 02:45:03.633]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[02:45:03.633 --> 02:45:07.895]  We have a video up there that says the revolution against the Federal Reserve starts now.
[02:45:07.895 --> 02:45:10.076]  Please help get that out to everybody.
[02:45:10.076 --> 02:45:14.679]  And please demonstrate at your private Federal Reserves in your area.
[02:45:14.679 --> 02:45:19.501]  Bob will talk to you, God willing, in the aftermath of this next Friday, my friend.
[02:45:20.728 --> 02:45:26.571]  Well, thank you very much, and thank you all for listening, and you have a very powerful weekend, Alex.
[02:45:26.571 --> 02:45:27.152]  Well, thank you.
[02:45:27.152 --> 02:45:30.694]  We're all doing this together, and believe me, the system is scared right now.
[02:45:30.694 --> 02:45:37.097]  The head of the Dallas Fed has responded and is trying to grovel and, you know, say he comes in peace, which we know they don't.
[02:45:37.097 --> 02:45:42.941]  Well, we do come in peace to expose you so that the legal system of our awakened countrymen can bring them to justice.
[02:45:43.981 --> 02:45:46.304]  Of course, I'll give them abstention as well.
[02:45:46.304 --> 02:45:54.872]  I mean, if they want to go to abstentia and be sent like Napoleon to the islands or something after they've been convicted, that's fine too.
[02:45:54.872 --> 02:45:58.775]  You know, through history, people have always done things like that because it's not good to corner rats.
[02:45:58.775 --> 02:46:04.181]  We just want our republic back and we don't want you to carry out your eugenics implosion of the entire world.
[02:46:04.181 --> 02:46:06.423]  We won't get to most of this interview, even much of it.
[02:46:06.903 --> 02:46:08.964]  No, this is part of part one that's 20 minutes long.
[02:46:08.964 --> 02:46:13.545]  We'll air Never Before Seen, part two tonight with Aaron Dykes hosting InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:46:13.545 --> 02:46:15.265]  But here's five minutes of it going to break.
[02:46:15.265 --> 02:46:19.186]  We'll come back with a little bit more on the other side and then Aaron will take us out of here.
[02:46:19.186 --> 02:46:23.787]  I'll see you tonight at the Dallas Federal Reserve and fellow reserve locations across the country.
[02:46:23.787 --> 02:46:27.488]  I'm Alex Jones signing off from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:46:27.488 --> 02:46:29.609]  But we are joined now by G. Edward Griffin.
[02:46:29.609 --> 02:46:31.549]  Sir, thank you for being with us.
[02:46:31.549 --> 02:46:32.270]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:46:32.270 --> 02:46:33.010]  Thanks for inviting me.
[02:46:33.669 --> 02:46:37.431]  Now, you don't need any introduction, but you're the best-selling author of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:46:37.431 --> 02:46:46.976]  For close to 50 years, you've been exposing the private banking cartel, and I can't think of anybody out there who explains the pressure from above, pressure from below system.
[02:46:46.976 --> 02:46:49.198]  People ask me, why would elite bankers
[02:46:49.958 --> 02:46:51.919]  Why would they support communists?
[02:46:51.919 --> 02:46:53.320]  Why would they support socialists?
[02:46:53.320 --> 02:46:55.122]  Why would they support collectivism?
[02:46:55.122 --> 02:47:03.988]  And we see moveon.org, the White House, all Wall Street financed, Soros financed, pumping millions into co-opting the Occupy Wall Street movement.
[02:47:03.988 --> 02:47:05.228]  That's why I'm calling
[02:47:06.169 --> 02:47:08.231]  For an Occupy the Fed.
[02:47:08.231 --> 02:47:10.632]  And so I want to get your view on that idea.
[02:47:10.632 --> 02:47:11.533]  And if you think that's a good one.
[02:47:11.533 --> 02:47:16.557]  And then I want to segue into what Carol Quigley and others wrote about that you made films about.
[02:47:16.557 --> 02:47:18.538]  This pressure from above and below.
[02:47:18.538 --> 02:47:22.281]  Why do we see so many billionaires supporting collectivism?
[02:47:22.281 --> 02:47:22.521]  G.E.B.
[02:47:22.521 --> 02:47:24.202]  or Griffin?
[02:47:24.202 --> 02:47:26.624]  Well you really raised a good point there Alex.
[02:47:26.624 --> 02:47:32.389]  Because there's a tremendous amount of confusion today between having a lot of money
[02:47:33.356 --> 02:47:33.476]  I'm
[02:47:49.224 --> 02:47:49.484]  I think so.
[02:48:08.991 --> 02:48:10.892]  You need to make that distinction.
[02:48:10.892 --> 02:48:19.259]  People make their money today in the world not by free enterprise competition, not by producing a better product at a better price, or anything like that.
[02:48:19.259 --> 02:48:34.711]  They make their money today by buying politicians, and buying political favoritism, and sending their lobbyists into the legislative power centers of whatever governments there are in the world, and getting them to pass special laws that favor them.
[02:48:35.111 --> 02:48:44.337]  Money today is made, the great wealth today is made by political maneuvering and favoritism, and that is not capitalism.
[02:48:44.337 --> 02:48:53.303]  So when people go out there and they say, our crisis today in the banking system proves that capitalism doesn't work, they don't understand any of this at all.
[02:48:53.303 --> 02:48:57.126]  They're still thinking that capitalism is the same as wealth.
[02:48:57.126 --> 02:49:04.170]  So you're right on target, I think, especially when you want to emphasize that we need to occupy, not Wall Street, what is that?
[02:49:04.991 --> 02:49:05.672]  It's a
[02:49:25.071 --> 02:49:27.794]  between corporations and government.
[02:49:27.794 --> 02:49:28.916]  That's not capitalism.
[02:49:28.916 --> 02:49:31.659]  That is collectivism in its purest form.
[02:49:31.659 --> 02:49:43.493]  So when these people say, let's overthrow capitalism, they miss the point because capitalism has been gone, really totally gone, in the sense of the word that I'm using it, been totally gone since World War II.
[02:49:43.493 --> 02:49:44.355]  Well, that's my point!
[02:49:46.256 --> 02:49:56.044]  Exactly, that's what I want you to elaborate on, is that even Ross Perot, who claims he's free market, made the lion's share of his money selling EDS to the government.
[02:49:56.044 --> 02:50:05.331]  You look at all these big fortunes, it's the monopoly power of government, and one of the clearest examples is Barack Obama and General Electric, the head of his economic council.
[02:50:05.331 --> 02:50:09.435]  They, the very day that his new carbon rules went into effect,
[02:50:10.828 --> 02:50:19.373]  They were given an exemption, and now they're shutting power plants down all over the country, but General Electric can still operate, and their profits are going way up.
[02:50:19.373 --> 02:50:23.196]  I mean, this is so dangerous, and it destroys progress.
[02:50:23.196 --> 02:50:36.804]  And then to see the monopoly capitalists using collectivism to destroy their competition, to consolidate power, to see Michael Moore, who's made hundreds of millions of dollars in the so-called free market system, saying capitalism is the problem, not the Federal Reserve.
[02:50:36.804 --> 02:50:38.205]  We have a clip of that we played.
[02:50:39.225 --> 02:50:42.688]  Earlier, as we went out to break, and he's saying that's the problem.
[02:50:42.688 --> 02:50:44.129]  The problem is capitalism.
[02:50:44.129 --> 02:50:50.154]  And so people now think monopoly corruption is capitalism and they're selling them on more collectivism.
[02:50:50.154 --> 02:50:53.216]  I mean, isn't that just putting our leg in a bigger bear trap?
[02:50:53.216 --> 02:50:55.878]  Because I remember you decades ago talking.
[02:51:01.883 --> 02:51:05.424]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[02:51:05.424 --> 02:51:11.446]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[02:51:11.446 --> 02:51:12.086]  Why?
[02:51:12.086 --> 02:51:16.427]  When you could be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by Le Cig.

[02:54:10.017 --> 02:54:13.961]  In a so-called free market system saying capitalism is the problem, not the Federal Reserve.
[02:54:13.961 --> 02:54:18.144]  We have a clip of that we played earlier as we went out to break.
[02:54:18.144 --> 02:54:19.846]  And he's saying that's the problem.
[02:54:19.846 --> 02:54:21.287]  The problem is capitalism.
[02:54:21.287 --> 02:54:27.332]  And so people now think monopoly corruption is capitalism and they're selling them on more collectivism.
[02:54:27.332 --> 02:54:30.395]  I mean, isn't that just putting our leg in a bigger bear trap?
[02:54:30.395 --> 02:54:32.377]  Because I remember you decades ago.
[02:54:32.757 --> 02:54:47.809]  Talking about this juncture we've now entered, where when the collectivism causes society to implode, the danger is the establishment will use that as an excuse to sell more of the same as the solution, instead of getting back to true freedom.
[02:54:47.809 --> 02:54:54.034]  So, break that down and the choice we have between the monopoly capitalist and true freedom.
[02:54:55.066 --> 02:54:57.087]  Well, you've said it so well, Alex.
[02:54:57.087 --> 02:55:05.452]  All I can do is go over the same ground, and I think it does need to be repeated over and over again, because it's foreign to the ears of most Americans.
[02:55:05.452 --> 02:55:09.534]  You don't hear this sort of thing on ABC, CBS, NBC, and all that.
[02:55:10.414 --> 02:55:17.480]  The major news outlets continue to spew out the same old propaganda about this is a capitalist system.
[02:55:17.480 --> 02:55:18.121]  Well, it's not.
[02:55:18.121 --> 02:55:19.562]  It's a collectivist system.
[02:55:19.562 --> 02:55:31.571]  There's not much difference anymore between the system in America and the system you find in Red China or in Cuba or in what used to be called the old Soviet Union or Russia.
[02:55:32.372 --> 02:55:40.078]  They have different labels, but once you peel off the label and look down underneath, you've got bedrock collectivism everywhere in the world today.
[02:55:40.078 --> 02:55:48.443]  And you're quite right when you say that the advocates of collectivism who want more, more, and more, create a boogeyman.
[02:55:48.443 --> 02:55:53.127]  They say, capitalism is what's causing all this problem, let's have more government intervention.
[02:55:53.427 --> 02:55:55.369]  Let's have more government control.
[02:55:55.369 --> 02:55:58.893]  Let's have more marriage between corporate and state.
[02:55:58.893 --> 02:56:03.919]  Let's have these private partnership relationships with the government.
[02:56:03.919 --> 02:56:05.040]  You know, all these things.
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:09.966]  They're advocating, as you say, more of the same poison that's killing the patient.
[02:56:09.966 --> 02:56:12.789]  They're advocating that as supposed to be the medicine for him.
[02:56:13.550 --> 02:56:20.252]  And the only real solution is, first of all, the American people have to understand this little trick that's being played on them.
[02:56:20.252 --> 02:56:22.452]  And then they have to understand, well, what is the alternative?
[02:56:22.452 --> 02:56:28.254]  It's something that, you know, we haven't seen in America in the lifetime of any of us living today.
[02:56:28.254 --> 02:56:32.855]  You have to go back to the history books to find out what the solution is.
[02:56:32.855 --> 02:56:35.096]  People say, well, you don't want to go backwards.
[02:56:35.096 --> 02:56:40.517]  Well, moving backwards in time would be moving forward in ideology.
[02:56:40.517 --> 02:56:42.798]  It would be moving forward in solutions.
[02:56:43.138 --> 02:56:49.822]  Because we would be moving forward to the idea of a free market, not in bed with the government.
[02:56:49.822 --> 02:56:55.786]  See, the government loves to come in and say, we're going to regulate these industries for you folks, for the benefit of the population.
[02:56:55.786 --> 02:57:05.312]  But what really happens is that the regulators get into bed with the corporations that are being regulated, and then they become one and the same.
[02:57:05.312 --> 02:57:12.097]  And so under this umbrella of supposedly regulating industry and the banks, among other things, another industry,
[02:57:12.637 --> 02:57:22.001]  And supposedly controlling the society for the benefit of the people, they're actually just protecting the corporations under that umbrella.
[02:57:22.001 --> 02:57:26.623]  So we've got to get this in our brains that this is the reality of today.
[02:57:26.623 --> 02:57:32.185]  And the only solution to this problem is to go forward to where we were about 80 years ago.
[02:57:32.185 --> 02:57:33.046]  I mean that literally.
[02:57:33.046 --> 02:57:35.727]  Go forward to where we were 80 or 100 years ago.
[02:57:37.047 --> 02:57:39.489]  And get the government out of all of these things.
[02:57:39.489 --> 02:57:51.916]  Go back to a true free enterprise system, where competition is the only thing that will produce the best products, the best service, the lowest prices, the best amount of freedom for the individual.
[02:57:51.916 --> 02:58:01.902]  And not that it's not with, it's without problems, because of course it does have problems, but those problems are minuscule compared to the problems that we have today, which is the result of government
[02:58:02.222 --> 02:58:02.803]  Well, very well said.
[02:58:02.803 --> 02:58:06.426]  Historically, here's an analogy to be added to what you were talking about, about going forward to the past.
[02:58:18.661 --> 02:58:28.310]  Okay, we have more of that interview with G. Everett Griffin tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News along with other special coverage of Occupy the Federal Reserve and Occupy Wall Street.
