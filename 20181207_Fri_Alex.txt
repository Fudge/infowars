[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex
[00:14.120 --> 00:38.640]  Jones show. It's Friday, December 7th, 2018. I'm your host Alex Jones. We'll be here for
[00:38.640 --> 00:42.520]  the next four hours of the war with Omar Shroy or Robert Stone and others. We've got Mark
[00:42.520 --> 00:51.120]  Dice coming up. We have Paul Watson joining us imminently. We have Roger Stone with Big
[00:51.120 --> 00:56.960]  Breaking News and other guests today. Plus, we'll take your phone calls. I also have gotten
[00:56.960 --> 01:02.040]  some news the last few weeks that's come into crystal clear clarity about the next phase
[01:02.040 --> 01:07.440]  of the attacks. Try to break down info wars and they see as a bellwether that once they
[01:07.440 --> 01:10.800]  get info wars taken down, they're going to make their move. You've seen the great energy
[01:10.800 --> 01:17.880]  behind it. They have looked at their equations, their political calculus, and we are seen
[01:17.880 --> 01:25.520]  as an army that's pro-American, an army of information warfare operatives that tell the
[01:25.520 --> 01:29.880]  truth with our secret weapon that once we've been taken out, then they'll make their main
[01:29.880 --> 01:34.520]  move on Trump. They've been given those orders to take us down and it has gone into very
[01:34.520 --> 01:40.240]  criminal nature and it just shows the type of fight we're in. The Federal Reserve is
[01:40.240 --> 01:44.600]  private run for profit, mainly owned by European robber barons. It's been trying to suppress
[01:44.600 --> 01:49.920]  the economy coming back. They've announced interest rate hikes over and over again now
[01:49.920 --> 01:53.560]  that it's admitted to be killing the economy. They say, okay, we won't raise interest rate
[01:53.560 --> 01:58.200]  yesterday. Stop market comes back. Today they go, oh, actually, we're going to do it. It
[01:58.200 --> 02:02.720]  plunges 400 more points. We'll be looking at all of that. Is Tucker Carlson right about
[02:02.720 --> 02:08.320]  Trump not delivering on any of his promises? That's a publicity grabbing thing that Tucker's
[02:08.320 --> 02:13.040]  done. I know why he's done it, but I'm going to be talking about that at the bottom of
[02:13.040 --> 02:17.640]  the hour. Is it accurate? Partially, but also not partially. So we're going to give an expert
[02:17.640 --> 02:21.640]  analysis with the real facts of that, but it's a good debate starter. It's a way to
[02:21.640 --> 02:26.760]  get the President's attention, something I'll be doing very, very soon in other ways. So
[02:26.760 --> 02:31.680]  that's all coming up. But when we return, Paul Watson will break down because he's lived
[02:31.680 --> 02:36.920]  off and on in France for a long time. The chain reaction, because even the head of the
[02:36.920 --> 02:42.280]  EU, Yonker, even Macron says this could bring down the super state EU, which is a good thing.
[02:42.280 --> 02:47.680]  It's an authoritarian regime. And what's really happening with the yellow vest movement that
[02:47.680 --> 02:53.040]  is a nationalist, anti-radical Islam movement. It's not about the gas tax increase. That
[02:53.040 --> 02:56.760]  was the straw that brought the camel's back. We're going to break in two minutes, but Paul,
[02:56.760 --> 02:59.800]  give us a preview of what's coming up.
[02:59.800 --> 03:05.040]  Well, Alex, there's going to be a massive demonstration this weekend in Paris and in
[03:05.040 --> 03:09.720]  other cities. Despite the fact, as we know, as we reported earlier this week, that Macron
[03:09.720 --> 03:14.920]  caved almost immediately on the request for the gas tax to be eliminated. First, they
[03:14.920 --> 03:20.440]  suspended it for six months. Now they, you know, canned it all together. But their demands
[03:20.440 --> 03:25.920]  have not been met, proving, as you just said, the gas tax was not the only thing. It was
[03:25.920 --> 03:31.280]  a straw that broke the camel's back. So basically, Macron was hailed as the savior of globalism
[03:31.280 --> 03:36.280]  just over a year ago when he took office. Hillary Clinton tweeted, victory for Macron
[03:36.280 --> 03:41.040]  for France, the EU and the world. Sadiq Khan tweeted, the French people have chosen hope
[03:41.040 --> 03:46.800]  over fear and unity over division. He was hailed as the great savior. Today, his approval
[03:46.800 --> 03:52.800]  rating is literally at 18%. And that was a poll before last weekend's riots. So it's
[03:52.800 --> 03:57.920]  probably even lower now. The army's heading to Paris. Some of the police have shown solidarity
[03:57.920 --> 04:02.440]  with the protesters. So it looks like there's going to be another big flashpoint this weekend,
[04:02.440 --> 04:03.440]  Alex.
[04:03.440 --> 04:07.600]  Let's be clear. Macron is the equivalent of a VG French trader. Those are the traders
[04:07.600 --> 04:12.480]  that work with the Nazis and occupied France for five years during World War II. He's literally
[04:12.480 --> 04:19.080]  saying, you cannot have France to be patriotic is to be bad patriotism. He's getting rid
[04:19.080 --> 04:24.040]  of your country. He has just made out, he said, we want to bring in 200 million North Africans
[04:24.040 --> 04:28.680]  in the next 20 years. We need to get rid of France. The heart of France is Africa. I
[04:28.680 --> 04:31.400]  mean, this guy is literally trying to kill the country.
[04:31.400 --> 04:35.840]  No, precisely. And they all rallied behind him. And now they've all got egg on their
[04:35.840 --> 04:41.080]  faces. Initially, he supported limiting immigration, Alex. And then he flipped. And that's when
[04:41.080 --> 04:45.560]  his poll numbers started diving. So we can look at how that started as well after the
[04:45.560 --> 04:46.560]  break.
[04:46.560 --> 04:50.720]  And let's be clear. Why is France so important? The globalists admit this is one of the final
[04:50.720 --> 04:56.320]  dominoes to bring them down. This is a devastating victory. We salute the yellow shirts.
[04:56.320 --> 05:05.160]  In the last few months, in full wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[05:05.160 --> 05:08.560]  of many of our best selling items. And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not
[05:08.560 --> 05:13.280]  just extend the sale of free shipping store wide 50 to 75% off double patriot points.
[05:13.280 --> 05:20.000]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order, even if it's a tube
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.120]  of fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine, four to five super blue, you'll get a free
[05:24.120 --> 05:29.560]  gift of a best selling t-shirt while supplies last. And what I mean by that is everyone
[05:29.560 --> 05:33.360]  will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out. So whatever you order that
[05:33.360 --> 05:37.520]  day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out. Then there'll be
[05:37.520 --> 05:41.640]  another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders. So in the next 12 days, we are
[05:41.640 --> 05:46.800]  going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had. So this is a loss leader. We are
[05:46.800 --> 05:50.580]  losing money on this. This is our biggest sale ever. Get your free gift. You're free
[05:50.580 --> 05:55.760]  shipping everything and don't fight the crowds in four store.com in four's life.com or triple
[05:55.760 --> 05:59.440]  eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. God bless you and thank you for your
[05:59.440 --> 06:00.440]  support.
[06:00.440 --> 06:02.440]  We've got it. We've got it.
[06:02.440 --> 06:03.440]  We've got it.
[06:03.440 --> 06:04.440]  We've got it.
[06:04.440 --> 06:05.440]  We've got it.
[06:05.440 --> 06:06.440]  We've got it.
[06:06.440 --> 06:07.440]  We've got it.
[06:07.440 --> 06:08.440]  We've got it.
[06:08.440 --> 06:09.440]  We've got it.
[06:09.440 --> 06:10.440]  We've got it.
[06:10.440 --> 06:11.440]  We've got it.
[06:11.440 --> 06:12.440]  We've got it.
[06:12.440 --> 06:13.440]  We've got it.
[06:13.440 --> 06:20.680]  Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of The Info War.
[06:20.680 --> 06:47.640]  This is going to be one Friday broadcast you're not going to want to miss and oh next week
[06:47.640 --> 06:52.600]  you don't want to miss any of those you know I don't hype stuff and I tell you believe me
[06:52.600 --> 07:04.120]  you want to tune in next week every day of the week we have communist china putting spy chips
[07:04.920 --> 07:10.680]  on all the cell phones produced there including apple this has come out but they have the code
[07:10.680 --> 07:16.840]  keys to all the apple phones why is that important well it's beyond important because the second biggest
[07:16.840 --> 07:23.800]  phone maker in the world that's bigger than apple had their chief operating officer arrested
[07:23.800 --> 07:29.720]  four days ago we mentioned it now we know why and it's not over trading with iran and getting
[07:29.720 --> 07:36.520]  around sanctions that's the cut and dry it's the spy chips on the phones the phones are illegal
[07:36.520 --> 07:42.360]  on us military bases it's the second biggest phone maker in the world but state run in china
[07:42.360 --> 07:47.480]  and the daughter of one of the top heads of the communist party is about to be extradited from
[07:47.480 --> 07:52.520]  canada the u.s and china is calling it an act of war our trader media is attacking trump we're
[07:52.520 --> 07:57.640]  doing it this is exactly what he should be doing arresting all the heads of these communist chinese
[07:57.640 --> 08:05.480]  firms arrogant criminals i'm going to explain this again they found on these phones 10 years ago
[08:06.040 --> 08:10.040]  chips that take over everything in your house everything in your building everything in your
[08:10.040 --> 08:17.880]  company steals your pass codes and it passes on to china you understand that now the media is acting
[08:17.880 --> 08:22.200]  dumb saying they don't know why but it's on record why i'll give you the rest of the story next hour
[08:24.200 --> 08:28.680]  earthshatter we're going to get obviously you know what's really happening with the stock
[08:28.680 --> 08:31.720]  market the federal reserve said they're going to raise rates again signaling the decline
[08:32.680 --> 08:36.680]  they bait and switch yesterday saying oh we're going to stop raising rates the stock market came
[08:36.680 --> 08:41.080]  back they said oh we're going to raise them this morning it plunged they're playing games here
[08:41.720 --> 08:46.200]  it's insider trading from the folks in private new york head fed they give their buddies in
[08:46.200 --> 08:52.040]  wall street what's about to happen like towards soros that's all coming up meanwhile us fears
[08:52.040 --> 08:56.120]  iran planning massive regional war in the middle east that's exactly what they're planning we'll
[08:56.120 --> 09:03.960]  look at that but first let's go to paul joseph watson with an update because he lives off and on in
[09:03.960 --> 09:09.880]  france and in spain he's in london now france 95 percent of speed cameras in one region destroyed
[09:09.880 --> 09:16.280]  overnight in a yellow vest protest beleaguered micron predicts major violence the fall of france
[09:16.280 --> 09:19.720]  the french interior minister said a month ago france is already basically gone if they don't
[09:19.720 --> 09:25.960]  reverse it now meanwhile the e u says they're afraid the whole e us about to collapse well yeah
[09:25.960 --> 09:30.360]  you want global carbon taxes you want open borders you want to conquer the nation you
[09:30.360 --> 09:36.920]  thought humanity was asleep but we now know the yellow vest are a nationalist populist movement
[09:36.920 --> 09:42.520]  that support le mary le pan who's more hardcore than front paul watson break it down for us
[09:43.960 --> 09:49.080]  well this has been brewing for a while alexis it's no surprise that over the past few decades
[09:49.080 --> 09:55.400]  the top two selling books in france were called uh submission by michael wellbeck and another book
[09:55.400 --> 10:02.440]  called le suicide france by eric zemore they're both about civil war and an islamic caliphate being
[10:03.320 --> 10:07.800]  presided over in france both basically about the same thing those are the two most popular
[10:07.800 --> 10:13.080]  books in france over the past 30 years so these yellow vest protests they obviously the yellow
[10:13.080 --> 10:18.440]  vest stems from it's a law in france you have to have two high visibility jackets in your vehicle
[10:18.440 --> 10:23.240]  at all times which illustrates the owner of bureaucracy that they have to live under but
[10:23.240 --> 10:28.600]  this is a repudiation of a technocratic elite alexis a repudiation of the global warming tax
[10:28.600 --> 10:34.600]  it's a repudiation of macron who is basically just a glorified administrator for the european
[10:34.600 --> 10:39.320]  commission he's not a president he's didn't really have that much power so it's again it's this
[10:39.320 --> 10:44.360]  trump effect you know there are anecdotal reports of these protesters chanting we want trump we
[10:44.360 --> 10:50.200]  want trump it's almost a mirror image of what drove trump to victory it's a silent forgotten
[10:50.200 --> 10:56.440]  non-urban majority who've come to realize that their economic future has been sold down the river
[10:56.440 --> 11:02.440]  for cheap foreign labor for cheap foreign goods the rural towns the rural areas in france are
[11:02.440 --> 11:07.640]  being emptied out they're being depopulated because everyone's having to run into the dystopian
[11:07.640 --> 11:13.880]  metropolis city to try and get a job mainly in the service industry that's their only option now
[11:13.880 --> 11:18.760]  because their industry is being hollowed out just like it was in the ross bell in america
[11:18.760 --> 11:23.560]  then you have the other factor which is the complete lack of integration of migrants and
[11:23.560 --> 11:29.400]  basically the fact that france is being reverse colonized and there were more mosques built in
[11:29.400 --> 11:35.640]  france over the past 30 years than catholic churches built ever in the country that gives
[11:35.640 --> 11:40.520]  you an illustration of what's going on there so the country is being reversed colonized and when
[11:40.520 --> 11:45.640]  you talk to these protesters when you listen to what their demands are it's very much centered
[11:45.640 --> 11:50.840]  on national identity and the complete lack of integration that the french government has
[11:50.840 --> 11:56.040]  presided over with these millions of mainly muslim migrants this is basically europe's
[11:56.040 --> 12:00.760]  autoimmune system is kicking in they keep using france like the california of europe
[12:00.760 --> 12:05.640]  as the test ground to see what they will put up with and finally they've made the french revolt
[12:07.160 --> 12:13.720]  yeah it's it's like the autoimmune system thing but this is funny alex so we've got we've got all
[12:13.720 --> 12:18.360]  these people on tape saying this is why we're protesting it's the soaring cost of living it's
[12:18.360 --> 12:23.640]  the gas tax it's the mass immigration they're all on tape they're all out on the streets saying this
[12:23.640 --> 12:29.080]  but not according to buzzfeed buzz feeds figured out the real reason why these protests are
[12:29.080 --> 12:34.360]  happening and it's because facebook had an algorithm change at the start of the year which
[12:34.360 --> 12:40.520]  more heavily featured local news so these people don't have any legitimate grievance as alex it's
[12:40.520 --> 12:47.000]  just the fact that facebook promoted certain pages over others in the past few months so you know
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.280]  what they're doing there don't you these are the same people who de-platformed you that's a dog whistle
[12:52.280 --> 12:57.320]  for facebook to ban these protest pages that are organizing these protests
[12:58.280 --> 13:03.560]  let's expand that they're saying what globalists are saying you can't have sports teams named after
[13:03.560 --> 13:07.640]  towns because that gives you identity or named after a nation the EU's been calling for that for
[13:07.640 --> 13:13.240]  a decade now they're doing it in five years all the national names are banned in soccer and football
[13:13.240 --> 13:18.200]  and it's the same thing here they're saying don't let people promote local news period so we go from
[13:18.200 --> 13:26.440]  hate to extremists to right wing to alex jones to ban everything local exactly it's a dog whistle to
[13:26.440 --> 13:31.320]  try and ban these protests because again when you have an Arab spring and the left winger proves of
[13:31.320 --> 13:37.080]  them using social media to facilitate their protests that's good and that should be encouraged
[13:37.080 --> 13:42.920]  but god forbid populists try to use the exact same tools for the exact same thing not only
[13:42.920 --> 13:47.880]  is it frowned upon it's a dog whistle to try and get those pages banned so of course it's not about
[13:47.880 --> 13:52.760]  an algorithm that's not the reason they're out on the streets go and talk to them listen to what
[13:52.760 --> 13:57.000]  they're saying the cost of living is soaring you moved out of france i mean let's talk about it
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.840]  they took your steel mills where you worked your dad worked and your brother worked they took those
[14:00.840 --> 14:05.000]  away so you guys took the money you had moved and bought a bed and breakfast in france it was
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.920]  hellish and you said riots and islamist is running around everywhere so you guys evacuated
[14:08.920 --> 14:12.760]  there two years ago i mean you know what you're talking about paul describe it you told me you'll
[14:12.760 --> 14:16.760]  be in a little village and there'll be muslims running around crapping all over the ground
[14:16.760 --> 14:23.400]  screaming at people well the the prevalence of hijabs definitely increased i mean my parents
[14:23.400 --> 14:28.440]  were living in a very remote area the local town just in the in the in the five years that they
[14:28.440 --> 14:33.320]  were living there you would go there at the start and it would be completely normal within five years
[14:33.320 --> 14:38.440]  everyone was wearing a hijab that the the pace of change was very rapid and that's what a lot of
[14:38.440 --> 14:44.440]  people are seeing even in the suburban areas not just in the major cities but it's interesting you
[14:44.440 --> 14:50.840]  know because macron despite being this completely arrogant sociopath as many actual psychiatrists
[14:50.840 --> 14:55.880]  have said that he is a sociopath you know comparing himself to jupiter the roman god and things like
[14:55.880 --> 15:03.320]  that he started off his tenure being somewhat wanting to control immigration he talks about it was a
[15:03.320 --> 15:07.240]  bait and switch it was a bait and switch we asked you this paul what's gonna happen in the
[15:07.240 --> 15:11.720]  fifty seconds we have left a lot of experts say the EU is doomed forever this is accelerating it
[15:11.720 --> 15:17.000]  and now the rebellion under the yellow vest name is spreading across europe is spreading across
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.080]  the europe springs to germany belgium holland they're arresting protest leaders in holland
[15:21.080 --> 15:26.360]  people are asking is this the european spring it's certainly the biggest uprising in 50 years
[15:26.360 --> 15:31.880]  since the 1968 riots so this weekend is going to tell us whether it's going to kick into high gear
[15:31.880 --> 15:37.400]  or subside it will give us a very clear indication and just like they said on the titanic's maiden
[15:37.400 --> 15:42.600]  voyage that not even god could sink this ship macron said i'm god and a couple years later
[15:42.600 --> 15:47.160]  we're learning he's actually toilet paper read paul's incredible reports at news wars dot com
[15:47.160 --> 15:51.640]  and info wars dot com and spread them paul will be watching your reportage on this very closely
[15:51.640 --> 15:57.320]  and dan lineman reporting from paris he'll be right back stay with us roger stone big breaking news
[15:59.720 --> 16:05.320]  hear that that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place

[22:05.160 --> 22:11.080]  we predicted the uh departure of general john kelly here it is the incredible tweet by the
[22:11.080 --> 22:16.520]  president today signaling exactly when he's going to drop the bomb the day that muller
[22:16.520 --> 22:22.920]  re announces his final report he will have a devastating counterattack that is lays out the
[22:22.920 --> 22:31.640]  criminality of muller clinton obama brennan komie and the rest uh very clear from his tweet today
[22:31.640 --> 22:38.120]  that the president is hunkered down and ready for battle uh yesterday uh i went to washington dc
[22:38.120 --> 22:46.120]  to take on congressman adam schiff because i'm tired of his lies and smears and shifty word games
[22:46.920 --> 22:52.360]  tremendous response from that uh in a really energized group of patriots at the american
[22:52.920 --> 22:59.560]  priority conference uh in info warriors to a man to a man many many people say to me
[22:59.560 --> 23:03.800]  please tell alex jones we're with him in this fight against internet censorship
[23:03.800 --> 23:08.680]  and tell me how much they love what we do here info wars that's right in case some listeners
[23:08.680 --> 23:15.000]  reviewers haven't seen the uh tweet there's quite a few about uh the big clinton foundation
[23:15.000 --> 23:19.080]  documents coming out that was paper play as if we already knew that komie and rosa steen helped
[23:19.080 --> 23:23.320]  cover it up with illegal warrants the fact that they all work together there's a whole group of
[23:23.320 --> 23:30.840]  tweets coming out it's very clear the president is ready for battle on my reading to rudy juliani
[23:30.840 --> 23:36.840]  one of the president's attorneys last night he was looking very happy very confident
[23:38.040 --> 23:42.840]  you know i think with presidents on a war footing and he understands that the big state
[23:42.840 --> 23:49.880]  moves to take him down is uh around the corner and he's poised to counterattack i think devastating
[23:49.880 --> 23:56.120]  effect i really think he is ready and he's got the goods he is finally i think woke and figured
[23:56.120 --> 24:03.320]  out that this isn't about paul maniford or roger stone or jerry corcy or alex jones it's about
[24:03.320 --> 24:08.600]  taking out the president of the united states it's about undoing what they could not do at the ballot
[24:08.600 --> 24:18.120]  box in 2016 roger uh trump obviously knows he has to take the gloves off right now
[24:20.280 --> 24:24.040]  what do you expect him to do next because we need major counteroffensive now
[24:24.040 --> 24:29.160]  he's he said freeze and charge is coming but does he have anybody in the justice department that
[24:29.160 --> 24:35.400]  aren't complete cowards you know i think he does i think he has uh he's got the detonator in his
[24:35.400 --> 24:42.760]  hands in my opinion i think he is ready to make his move uh and really the turning point in my view
[24:42.760 --> 24:48.040]  was when paul maniford's attorneys and jerry corcy's attorneys told the president's attorneys
[24:48.040 --> 24:54.040]  all the questioning is about the president all the questioning is about taking down the
[24:54.920 --> 25:02.040]  the chief executive this isn't about his underlings this isn't about his minions this is a speeding
[25:02.040 --> 25:09.160]  bullet heading directly for the head of the president and uh we're we're highly confident that
[25:10.600 --> 25:16.600]  that he's ready for an honorable war fighting and this is an incredible moment because with nixon
[25:16.600 --> 25:20.280]  his main opposition you could you didn't have total proof of criminal activity but as trump
[25:20.280 --> 25:27.640]  is tweeting today he's saying it's comey it's Mueller they are criminals not drum corcy and and
[25:27.640 --> 25:32.200]  so he's telling it like it is they are criminals who illegally spot on the campaign they are
[25:32.200 --> 25:36.680]  criminals that sold us out to russia they are criminals that are trying to overturn the election
[25:36.680 --> 25:43.640]  the president they are and and and i cannot believe they're hootspa it really is incredible
[25:43.640 --> 25:49.800]  that they are pushing ahead you notice today the president is tweets specifically pointing out the
[25:49.800 --> 25:56.360]  long close relationship between robert baller and james comey and also pointing out that the woman
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.680]  heading the investigation into roger stell heading the investigation before the mother
[26:02.680 --> 26:08.840]  home is the former attorney for hillary clinton in the email case and for the clinton foundation
[26:08.840 --> 26:14.360]  in a uh racketeering case if that's not a stunning conflict of interest i don't know what is
[26:16.280 --> 26:20.040]  and of course we are the ones that fared it out and pointed it out the world
[26:20.040 --> 26:23.960]  that the former head lawyer for the clinton foundation is now the head prosecutor i mean
[26:23.960 --> 26:29.560]  trump isn't even given in this intel we are the intel for america drudge report is as well
[26:29.560 --> 26:33.640]  so the washington post is attacking drudge report today and i'm not bragging i don't want to be in

[32:15.080 --> 32:21.160]  in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good

[32:25.640 --> 32:31.640]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due
[32:31.640 --> 32:36.440]  to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[32:36.440 --> 32:41.640]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[32:41.640 --> 32:48.440]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it

[33:05.480 --> 33:17.720]  oh
[33:17.720 --> 33:35.960]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[33:35.960 --> 33:47.160]  i got up this morning at 5 30 and i went to info wars.com
[33:49.160 --> 33:52.600]  and i noticed it hadn't been updated yet no big deal was about to be updated they
[33:52.600 --> 33:58.520]  updated over in england at about 6 a.m want to drugreport.com of course it had been updated
[33:58.520 --> 34:05.960]  and because i don't know how drudge and one other guy were up 247 but they are
[34:05.960 --> 34:10.680]  and it was this little gem tucker trump hasn't kept any of his promises
[34:14.840 --> 34:17.960]  and then i went on to read the article with a german newspaper
[34:17.960 --> 34:28.280]  and it gave me a kind of a frustration headache as i was drinking my coffee at 5 30
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.960]  i read the whole article and i know what tucker crawls is trying to do with this
[34:35.640 --> 34:40.520]  and i think some of the points he makes are very very valid but some aren't
[34:40.520 --> 34:46.360]  and i think this is a little bit of him hedging his bets in case trump goes down
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.360]  and and let me tell you carlson's really smart and i respect him and i think he's the smartest
[34:54.360 --> 35:00.600]  person on television i really like sean hannity too they're both very influential you know they
[35:00.600 --> 35:04.920]  had the big national poll of media and they found matt drudge is the most influential and then
[35:04.920 --> 35:10.600]  and a few other people will talk about that later and the washington poster by attack matt drudge all
[35:10.600 --> 35:16.440]  out of jealousy come up bite in the hand that feeds you for the lord anyways
[35:19.560 --> 35:24.760]  this article i could talk about for two hours not because it's about drudge it's about the
[35:24.760 --> 35:28.840]  lies of corporate medium because everything they say about drudge
[35:28.840 --> 35:34.440]  is what they're doing themselves
[35:37.960 --> 35:43.640]  they call him fake news and this purveyor of evil when i guess that's kind of true in a way
[35:43.640 --> 35:49.560]  because he links more to mainstream media than independent media i guess no weird backhanded
[35:49.560 --> 35:53.240]  way that's true i'm not saying drudge is bad to do that he's showing all the different angles
[35:53.240 --> 35:57.320]  but drudge is just this portal into what he thinks is interesting and people tend to resonate with
[35:57.320 --> 36:05.240]  that because drudge is a smart guy but you read this and it's just like it's a war on reality it's a
[36:05.240 --> 36:13.960]  war on logic drudge links to the washington post almost every day and they even admit in major
[36:13.960 --> 36:19.480]  studies like half the new york times and washington post traffic is routinely from drudge
[36:19.480 --> 36:27.400]  i mean ours is like 10 because he links to us every once in a while these people are incredible
[36:28.760 --> 36:33.160]  again drudge is horrible he links to the evil he's a bad person and by the way he's the reason we
[36:33.160 --> 36:40.840]  exist it's kind of like trump corporate media had absolutely no views it was totally going bankrupt
[36:40.840 --> 36:46.200]  but when they cover him suddenly they get a dead cat bounce and it keeps him alive they of course
[36:46.200 --> 36:49.880]  want him destroyed the article is drudge takes the oscar for cluelessness
[36:52.200 --> 36:57.640]  oh yeah that's why one guy's more successful than jeff bezos pumping 600 million dollars a year in
[36:57.640 --> 37:03.160]  the washington post that's why he's got what 20 30 times i don't know the traffic of the washington
[37:03.160 --> 37:08.280]  post because he's smart and you're not i mean all right he's not a trader and you are i mean
[37:10.280 --> 37:15.240]  let's see they want him to not have a platform they want me to not have a platform they don't
[37:15.240 --> 37:21.880]  want tucker carlson they really hate him they don't him that platform because we're independent
[37:21.880 --> 37:27.880]  we're smarter than them and we're not traders and that reminds them of what unpopular lying
[37:27.880 --> 37:35.400]  scum they are but i digress that's why then i see an article like this this interview with carlson
[37:35.400 --> 37:49.400]  and it's frustrating because i know why carlson did this he didn't tell me i know it's frustration
[37:50.840 --> 37:56.120]  and from his perspective he's right but if you pull back from the perspective
[37:56.920 --> 38:01.240]  of not wanting instant gratification and looking at what trump's working with
[38:01.240 --> 38:09.720]  it's like trump's built a spaceship with some gravel and some tin cans in the backyard that
[38:09.720 --> 38:14.760]  just got off the ground now it's on fire at about 50 000 feet and about to blow up but
[38:14.760 --> 38:19.320]  you're still like boy he sure tried didn't he and then it's a reflection on us
[38:22.440 --> 38:26.440]  i mean if you don't admire trailblazers and people that go against the grain and deliver
[38:26.440 --> 38:33.320]  or even partially it'd be like one guy playing from the nfl playing 11 others
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.480]  10 to 1 11 to 1 and trump only gets the ball down the field 50 yards and since he didn't
[38:41.480 --> 38:57.640]  get it across the line he sucks no he's fighting an uphill battle see that's why it's hard to cover
[38:57.640 --> 39:02.680]  a story like this because there's so many facets to it i could take one line that tucker says look
[39:02.680 --> 39:07.880]  at both angles of it for an hour just one line of story like trump doesn't really know what he's doing
[39:07.880 --> 39:11.800]  he doesn't know how to control washington and that's why he can't get anything done well
[39:11.800 --> 39:16.920]  because he's not part of them that's why he's gotten so much done because he's not part of the
[39:16.920 --> 39:21.320]  good old boy network because he really is the president he really is returning power to the
[39:21.320 --> 39:28.920]  oval office it's revolutionary that alone the nationalism here's the problem i don't have an hour
[39:29.880 --> 39:33.960]  to set aside for trump's accomplishments because there's different list out there
[39:33.960 --> 39:39.160]  summer a thousand long summer 500 long i've got one that's 280 something long here
[39:40.840 --> 39:46.040]  and i was trying to look at it this morning at home and by then my kids were up at 615 running
[39:46.040 --> 39:50.360]  around and we started getting breakfast going and things and i had to stop looking at it and
[39:54.520 --> 39:57.560]  it made me sick to my stomach at the same time i've given me a headache because
[39:57.560 --> 40:04.760]  i realized we really are an instant gratification culture and you look at everything trump's been
[40:04.760 --> 40:10.440]  able to do despite what he's working with and the fact that more of us aren't involved in the field
[40:10.440 --> 40:15.160]  is why we may lose you know we left sent my reporters down two different groups seven to the
[40:15.160 --> 40:23.080]  mexico us border tijuana san diego and every time they're there they're outnumbered about 21
[40:23.080 --> 40:27.800]  by leftist and anti-fascist combats spitting in their face and cussing and yelling at them
[40:27.800 --> 40:34.920]  where are the people going down there as citizen journalists to show what's going on
[40:34.920 --> 40:39.400]  and to have the numbers oh well we're conservatives or we're christians or we're business owners
[40:39.400 --> 40:45.160]  or we're parents you know we don't do that we leave that to alex jones well guess what they
[40:45.160 --> 40:52.600]  just banned my ass they can't stop all of you so i'm not on your butt here i'm just simply saying
[40:52.600 --> 41:00.360]  to everybody we don't have any room to criticize what trump's done and it's not about frustrating
[41:00.360 --> 41:08.840]  myself before trump it's the opposite it's about looking at what we're doing all of us to fight
[41:08.840 --> 41:13.960]  these globalists and their scumbag minions who are such a clear and present danger and it's about
[41:13.960 --> 41:20.600]  realizing that if we all just lift a finger collectively these parasites will be off our back
[41:20.600 --> 41:27.720]  like that it is our acquiescence it is our going along with the system it is our passiveness
[41:27.720 --> 41:32.120]  that has allowed this to happen so here's what i'm going to do because i've got such earth shattering
[41:32.120 --> 41:36.680]  news i mean it's this is all just totally bombshell and totally positive in many ways
[41:38.600 --> 41:42.360]  i'm going to start the next hour and do the tucker Carlson thing i just did some preludes but i'm
[41:42.360 --> 41:46.600]  going to laser focus and do this i'm going to maybe two segments segment two and segment three
[41:46.600 --> 41:51.000]  and then mark dies is coming up and dr nick baggotson and a lot more
[41:53.320 --> 41:54.920]  i'm at the big world news when we come back
[41:57.720 --> 42:06.040]  but just this china thing alone with what they did arresting the deputy head of one of the most
[42:06.040 --> 42:12.360]  powerful people in china his daughter who is a spy chief she has three different names they've
[42:12.360 --> 42:18.680]  caught the company putting spy chips on all the devices that the devices are illegal inside us
[42:18.680 --> 42:24.600]  government buildings and they're all asking oh why she got arrested well we know damn well why she
[42:24.600 --> 42:33.880]  did they're trying to put up 5g all over the us that will break into every device in the country
[42:33.880 --> 42:38.680]  we're under chinese communist attack and trump into trader and he just said no to the whole double
[42:38.680 --> 42:42.840]  cross and that's why hillary and all these traders are crapping their drawers because they're so
[42:42.840 --> 42:48.280]  desperate to get this lion out of here before the world wakes up instead most conservatives are
[42:48.280 --> 42:53.960]  talking about how the lion surrounded by 500 hyenas can do a better job i say all of us get the fight
[42:53.960 --> 43:02.360]  with the lion because we're lions too in the last few months info wars has been escalating our sales
[43:02.360 --> 43:07.000]  to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items and then i came up with the idea last week
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.480]  let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store wide 50 to 75 percent off double patriot
[43:11.480 --> 43:19.000]  points let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order even if it's a tube of
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.160]  fluoride free colloidal silver iodine fortified super blue you'll get a free gift of a best-selling
[43:25.160 --> 43:29.800]  t-shirt while supplies last and what i mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are
[43:29.800 --> 43:35.000]  going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.160]  until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the
[43:39.160 --> 43:45.000]  next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had so this is a loss
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.480]  leader we are losing money on this this is our biggest sale ever get your free gift your free

[47:43.720 --> 47:48.200]  you know how effective trump's been by how much they're attacking how much they demonizing
[47:48.200 --> 47:55.640]  and how much they go after anybody that stands with it so it's not a pain for me it's not a
[47:55.640 --> 48:02.440]  sacrifice it's a real pleasure to be persecuted right alongside president trump and that's the
[48:02.440 --> 48:07.080]  attitude we've all got to have and we're gonna defeat this thing for our children we have to
[48:07.080 --> 48:10.600]  be want to be in the fight ladies and gentlemen if you don't want to be in the fight you might as
[48:10.600 --> 48:14.920]  well get the hell out of the fight and just roll over and let this globalist system totally
[48:14.920 --> 48:21.720]  dominate you okay just so you know what's coming up and i'm gonna start getting into it right now
[48:21.720 --> 48:26.520]  i'm gonna hit what's really going on with the economy i'm gonna hit the biggest news what's
[48:26.520 --> 48:36.600]  happening in china and how that ties into iran and pakistan and india and afghanistan
[48:38.040 --> 48:42.840]  i'm gonna look more what's happening in europe in the fall the e you it's coming down
[48:44.920 --> 48:49.160]  and it turns out one of our listeners got the foyer request to release more of the mk ultra
[48:49.160 --> 48:55.080]  documents so that's in the news today i've got some inside baseball for you on that talk about
[48:55.080 --> 48:59.000]  next week's news today i'm gonna give a little bit of tidbit on what's coming next on that front
[48:59.000 --> 49:08.440]  and i'm gonna stop right there and then i'm gonna look at the jealousy and hatred of the fake media
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.640]  against the real medium and this washington post sickening article drudge takes the oscar for clueless
[49:15.080 --> 49:20.120]  and also the clinton foundation whistleblowers have come forward with hundreds of pages of evidence
[49:20.120 --> 49:25.560]  and it is extremely damning of pay-to-play comingling of funds you guys well why wasn't anything done
[49:25.560 --> 49:32.600]  because comey and mewler and rozenstein were there not a single switch but actively involved
[49:36.760 --> 49:38.920]  actively involved in all of this
[49:41.320 --> 49:46.440]  so let's look at national security and how the nation's under attack and how corporate media
[49:46.440 --> 49:54.440]  and the universities openly say that the country existing itself is a bad thing because you're
[49:54.440 --> 49:59.400]  all treated to the governor of new york saying we were never a great nation will never be a great
[49:59.400 --> 50:08.520]  nation and you've all been treated to similar statements by bill mar and you you see all the
[50:08.520 --> 50:13.960]  news channels we did a compilation a few weeks ago in the last few months did you hear the word he
[50:13.960 --> 50:20.600]  said he said nationalist how dirty how evil just the country existing is bad so here comes the
[50:20.600 --> 50:25.640]  private fellow reserve according to estimates from 1913 they admitted in news reports then that
[50:25.640 --> 50:34.040]  about 80 percent of its stockholders are foreign eu holders today the same people
[50:37.560 --> 50:42.200]  and so the private fellow reserve raises interest rate seven times on us never did under obama
[50:42.200 --> 50:48.840]  and then the economy starts going down some and then yesterday they say you know what we may not
[50:48.840 --> 50:53.960]  do rate heights for the next year and the stock market gets back most of its losses for the year
[50:53.960 --> 51:00.120]  making the year in in the black oh and then magically ladies and gentlemen they come out today
[51:00.120 --> 51:04.360]  and say oh we had a good jobs number report come in actually it wasn't it was down from what they
[51:04.360 --> 51:08.440]  thought about a third and so we're going to raise interest rates again why not just keep your
[51:08.440 --> 51:12.920]  mouth shut no they want to manipulate this economy now because they know no president
[51:15.800 --> 51:22.520]  going into his reelection bid other than franklin delano roosevelt has ever won in a
[51:22.520 --> 51:28.760]  recession or a depression jimmy carter didn't did he and so they know that and they've got
[51:28.760 --> 51:34.440]  op-eds out there saying let's not help the economy let's we've heard bill mar and others
[51:34.440 --> 51:41.880]  let's let's let's hurt it so people don't give trump credit foreign armies couldn't do that to us but
[51:41.880 --> 51:46.840]  you see we've got a rigged economy the president tried to rig it a little for you a little for me
[51:49.320 --> 51:53.640]  it's command and control he said hey china you can get fat off us just give us something
[51:54.200 --> 51:58.200]  they said no you get nothing so he said okay i'll take it all away they said okay whoa whoa whoa
[51:58.200 --> 52:05.880]  we'll give you a third he said no i want half which is fair you know you and your
[52:05.880 --> 52:11.240]  brother go out for pizza and you order a large pizza and you're and you're going dutch you're
[52:11.240 --> 52:20.440]  going to split the money and there's six pieces you get three he gets three
[52:20.440 --> 52:30.120]  so the dow fell 400 points breaking decline for the wild week to more than 3 c mbc
[52:32.360 --> 52:38.440]  jobs growth cools in november monthly wages gain the most but you see that number it cooled but
[52:38.440 --> 52:48.680]  they say the federal reserve came out today and said oh no oh no no no no no no no this is good
[52:48.680 --> 52:53.160]  numbers even though it's not we're going to keep trying to push america under the water
[52:53.160 --> 53:03.240]  and drown at this recovery all in your face completely diabolical because at the same
[53:03.240 --> 53:08.440]  time china's had zero percent interest for decades 10 growth rates a year state run
[53:10.280 --> 53:14.920]  and our own media is cheerleading that how dare trump say we had a month-long moratorium on the
[53:14.920 --> 53:19.960]  trade war when he knew the justice department was about to arrest the number two person at the
[53:19.960 --> 53:25.400]  second largest telecom cell phone company in the world and why is he doing this this is outrageous
[53:25.400 --> 53:32.440]  police state activity you know they catch a russian spy stealing some stuff they give them
[53:33.640 --> 53:37.240]  life in prison they catch an israeli spy like johnson paulard live in prison good
[53:37.240 --> 53:45.800]  but boy you're a chai kong and your company's been caught from australia to japan to south korea
[53:47.400 --> 53:57.640]  to vietnam to england to the uk wide no one will take these phones into their country you

[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:31.640]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:37.880]  ladies and gentlemen next segment i'm getting into how trump has delivered in royal flush
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:46.680]  spades on the key priorities to save this country he said goals that are psychological for the
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:53.480]  public to reclaim their identity he said physical and financial goals for the strategic defense
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:01:02.440]  and offensive operations of this country and he's getting very good advice on many fronts he's
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.920]  having trouble getting his domestic agenda implemented because of cowardice and idiocy and
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:11.960]  people being a bunch of scum and losers we're gonna talk about the next segment but it doesn't matter
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:20.200]  what he's promoting in the iconography is total victory and that is the rest of the story that's
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.360]  coming up next segment well the phone's up after that mark dice is going to be popping in
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:38.120]  this china situation is so big and so so dangerous and so incredible
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.960]  that i really am having trouble coming up with words to describe it i mean
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:50.600]  i mean if you look at the job the globalist did on us selling the country out to mainly the
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.680]  chai cops they were the ones that were meant to break us in the end and to take over japan and
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:00.440]  the koreas and vietnam and everything but they're running into a brick wall
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.600]  and there were traders in our government obviously the clinton's chief amongst them the bushes a
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:17.800]  close second who helped set this up and now you read the pentagon and you read the war
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.560]  colleges nothing to do with russia everyone knows they've cut their defense spending their
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:26.680]  defensive situation there are certain elements trying to start a war from them with them a regional
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:33.160]  conflict to draw us off of china and china's funding iran and pakistan and others trying to do that
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:39.240]  that's why we've got to move very very quickly but make no mistake what trump's doing is in the
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.400]  interest of humanity the interest of america and the interest of the poor people living in china
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:48.440]  and others and everybody should be praying for president trump instead of getting on the bandwagon
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.880]  to bash him and put him down and and and separate themselves from him because he's the man in the
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:03:04.680]  arena china has ignored trump's tweet on iran's his business there will continue even though
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.120]  they're in agreements with us if we put sanctions in they will not uh they'll be part of it
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:15.080]  so this is all heating up and reportedly the head of this big telecom got arrested for deals
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:24.120]  in iran that they violated us trade laws by by using money out of the us to go there it's all
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:33.720]  just a message to the chinese will grab you and the chinese are already shooting on our ships
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:39.800]  already running their mouths they're gonna end up just like hitler and just like the japanese
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:46.040]  you watch if they want that if they think they've if they think that there was just traders in our
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:52.040]  government there weren't there were there were traders but they were allowed to operate by
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.440]  other people so that we'd know exactly who all the traders were when this went down i think we're
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:02.680]  going to leave a bunch of traders in the government when we literally garot yukamis so you're about
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:08.360]  to get it china everybody better decide which side they're on right now it's all these globalists
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:13.000]  are so scared of trump put that london garden reports saying if the world gets destroyed
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.400]  blame alex jones he got trump elected no this audience did and you know what trump's for real
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:24.200]  so all you wimps who wanted to run the white flag up to the chai comms and piss all over
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:30.600]  yourselves we gave china and all these other groups a lot of chances we gave the clinton's chances
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.840]  and we gave the democrats chances and all the traders chances chances are over
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:41.320]  and it doesn't matter what you do to info wars it's going to go forward it's over
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:49.560]  it's over all chinese agents are about to get arrested every one of you
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.320]  quarterly that woman was carrying a database of their operatives we already have the database

[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.640]  that stood against the peer pressure that stood against the threats that have now changed the

[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:17.480]  front lines of the info war night and unprecedented rest escalating trumps trade war to a whole new
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:23.720]  level one of china's most important business leaders arrested in canada she is the cfo of
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:29.400]  tech giant huawei one of china's marquee companies huawei makes more cell phones and apple revenues
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:34.200]  this year are set to top bowings the source telling cnn the view among some officials is
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:39.480]  she could be used as leverage with china in trade talks and of course the expectation is she'll be
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:44.600]  extradited to the united states out front now peter navarro assistant to the president for trade
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:51.000]  and manufacturing policy okay peter this threw everything into disarray today it shocked everybody
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.920]  what is going on here it's pretty simple the two issues are totally separate the trade negotiations
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:06.600]  and this this arrest the justice department acts on an independent track the coincidence
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:13.560]  of the arrest happening in the same time frame was just that and what we need to do on the
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:21.160]  negotiation side is just proceed from the dinner that we had in argentina over the next 90 days to
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:29.480]  see if china can come to an accommodation with the bad behavior they engage in across a wide
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:35.640]  range of things and meanwhile that the justice department will do what it needs to do but can
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:40.440]  i just ask you a question on this on this i mean if that's really what happened the justice
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:45.800]  department did it are you saying they didn't tell the president he had no idea uh erin yes
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:51.560]  erin i was at the uh i was at the dinner with president she and president trump this was an
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:57.400]  amazing thing two presidents there i was also an active participant in several meetings we had
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:03.080]  with the president leading up to that dinner we had discussions with the team steve mnuchin
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:10.600]  lehrichudlow john bolton secretary pompeo of course ambassador lightheiser this issue never came up
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:17.080]  the president was was unaware of it going into that dinner as we're all members of the team and
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:23.480]  look i think what's interesting to observe here is that the fact that a matter is the reason why
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:28.200]  we're having such trouble with china is they do stuff like this all the time they lie they
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:34.200]  cheat they steal they force technology transfers so on any given day uh there have been actions
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:38.360]  taken against china over the course of administration okay but let me just ask you because okay then
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:42.840]  she goes on to basically criticize the president inside of the chai comms as a trader would let's
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:53.000]  explain there were 500 million plus people there when the leftist arm of the cia in 1949 put malice
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.520]  tongue into power this is all declassified now i'm reading about it from the john birch society
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:01.240]  was saying this in the 60s but but now it's all declassified the john birch society got founded
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:05.640]  because they were aware of all this going on uh from john birch who was an army officer who had
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:10.440]  tortured to death over there because he wouldn't go along with it and so they used china as this
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:18.520]  base to commit criminal activity to move us jobs overseas and then work with the chinese communist
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.560]  party that basically the carney foundation the rockefeller foundation and others set up and day
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:28.360]  the rockefeller wrote new york times op ed's admitting all this he wrote books admitting
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:34.600]  it you can just type in david rockefeller praises malice tongue and then they click images on google
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:42.200]  and you'll get the new york times articles so what i'm telling you is a fact and now again 50 years
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:46.920]  ago 99 percent of the country didn't have running water and toilets now they've got more cities more
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:57.560]  systems than we did because the power was all transferred to them not the people of china
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:03.480]  but the authoritarians and now you've got this second biggest cell phone telecom in the world
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:09.240]  who plan to put in a nationwide 5g program obama was bringing it in with them they were
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.240]  gonna use us taxpayer money to pay for part of it trump just killed it and you've got
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:17.160]  not while way the second biggest cell phone company in the world apple's the third largest
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:28.040]  and they moved to china and make up state run and so now they are coming out and saying this
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:38.360]  is an act of war we'll come after you we'll do all this to you if you don't stop what you're doing
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:44.120]  and the media spending it oh they busted her because she was using us money violating us law
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:49.240]  that she's agreed to to give money to iran to to get around the sanctions
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.600]  and that is part of it they've they've
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.480]  got her on that front she's the number two person largest most successful company in china
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:08.520]  this is china's biggest most successful state-controlled company her father is in the top
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.280]  three or four people in the communist party some say he's more powerful than the dictator
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:19.000]  that trump just met with and so yeah it's more than a shot across the bow it's like
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.120]  you keep having your ships in the south china sea and waters that have never been disputed
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:30.120]  to the last five years shooting on our ships you've got drones crashing into our ships you're
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:37.480]  disappearing people you're attacking us embassies with microwave guns you've been killing our assets
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:43.080]  in your country we haven't been killing yours and so now the gloves are off trump's not going to sit
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:49.880]  there and kill low-level people he's not going to arrest low-level people he's telling china we just
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:12:01.880]  grabbed your corrupt daughter who heads up your biggest company and we've got our computers
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.520]  and we're downloading everything off of them because i guarantee you they've been so arrogant
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:11.160]  thinking this country is a bunch of wimps that she's got all the material on her computer believe
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.480]  me they wouldn't have grabbed her they didn't already know it they already scanned her computer
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.760]  remotely they already knew full well what she had they want the custody of it they want the proof
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:26.840]  because let me tell you what she's got she's got the office of personnel management hack that
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:33.240]  obama gave her and she's got everything else in there she's got all those different codes
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:39.160]  and she's over there with her other executives because they're not transferring that stuff over
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:46.120]  the internet they are delivering it computer to computer and she's there setting up their military
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.960]  operations against america and their modern military operations are digital and they're financial
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:58.280]  and they've got the chief of staff for diane feinstein being a communist chinese agent
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.240]  and half the other democrats you'll notice will have a former chinese nationals
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:09.640]  with intelligence ties as either their chief driver assistant or even chief of staff because
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:15.720]  that the chinese say we own you we will be on the senate computers you get our money through
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:21.080]  u.s front companies you and your husband she's gotten over a billion from china her husband has

[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:33.720]  total enemy of this country and under the clinton's and everybody this just became normal clinton would

[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:45.000]  record they're like oh they cannot believe that they were actually giving all the power and and
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.160]  given all the industry and given all the jobs but david rockefell and others set the deal up
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:57.640]  for the one child policy all of it all china had to do was sell out america and sell out
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:02.040]  their own people and they would be given all the power and they have been and now think about it
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:08.200]  trump is coming in and just absolutely rolling and all up and that's why the democrats are so
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:13.400]  scared that's why they're all freaking out that's why they don't know what to do that's why they're
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:19.000]  crapping their breaches that's why it's getting so serious because they have committed such crimes
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:25.880]  so they're all scared trump's coming in he knows china is totally you know taking us over what do
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:31.000]  we do well we're foreign traders we're globals we hate america let's just say he's a russian agent

[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:41.880]  and that's now what's really happening okay i said i give him the Tucker Carlson
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:49.400]  because he's come out and he's taking trump the woodshed he said trump hasn't kept any of his
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:55.000]  promises i don't know what planet tuckers living on but about to take him to the woodshed
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:03.240]  hear that that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place

[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:29.960]  i don't care anymore i don't care anymore
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:41.880]  don't care anymore so it's been argued that things like the vatican things like israel
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:48.520]  gets set up by religions or organizations or groups so that people can commit crimes in one
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:54.040]  country or one area and then run back to those areas well with it with the case of communist china
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:58.840]  corrupt globalists in our country the rockefellers and others on record helped set up modern
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:06.440]  communist china put malin to power so that they could have a place with no human rights no industrial
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:13.800]  cleanliness no regulations to go in and take a group of smart hardworking people industrialize
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:22.280]  them and then use them to take over the planet and that's now been done and it's been done by
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:26.600]  selling out our nation and i've just spent most of the show on this is such a big deal
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:34.280]  that trump has arrested the number two executive at china's biggest company this telecom giant with
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:42.040]  5g second biggest smartphone maker who's been banned from australia to india from japan to the
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:49.240]  united states on u.s military bases but many countries ban it period because they've been caught
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:53.320]  putting spy chips on them remember the big bloomberg investigative report a couple months ago you
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:58.120]  heard about here years ago but you know we're next year's news today little chips and grab your
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:04.280]  wireless code everything and then back channel dial in like a modem back to chi-com headquarters
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:12.440]  with all your personal data but here's the big issue i haven't hit yet if apple moved there
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:16.520]  earlier this year to be tax exempt and gave their apple code keys to the government and
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:21.800]  admitted well that's part of being being state run here to be tax exempt then they're a bigger threat
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:28.440]  than why way and that's what scared tim cook so much four months ago when he called for me to be
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:34.520]  banned and all the other CEOs got in line but see tim we're still on hundreds of am and fm stations
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:39.400]  and hundreds of tv stations and still have info wars dot com and news wars dot com it's something
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:45.960]  even more important we have this great audience of men and women and young people black white
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:52.440]  old young asian christian falon gong buddhas that are upset they're huge supporters because they've
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:57.560]  been imprisoned and killed their families have supporting info wars by something called people
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:05.000]  power word of mouth and they're taking action so i wanted to just recap that because this is so epic
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.160]  and china's calling it an act of war and there could be huge repercussions but at some point
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:21.560]  we've got to stop letting them push and push and push and push and push and push that's what's
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:27.720]  happening now it's called pushback and i wanted to hit that first is one of trump's biggest
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:32.600]  accomplishments he said i'll stand up to china doing one sided trade deals where they have
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:38.200]  multi hundred percent tariffs on us and we have no tariff on them they do it through taxes they do
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:42.680]  it through currency they do it through actual tariffs he said you know canada it's got 280
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:52.040]  percent tariff on on dairy just to name one of many we'll just do that to them and trump did it
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:57.400]  suddenly thousands of factories came back because now we were open for business again so the private
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:01.000]  fellow reserve came in and tried to block all that and then in comes tucker carlson one of the
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:07.640]  smartest people out there definitely smartest on cable news and he does this big interview with
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:15.320]  a german newspaper die welt woke if i'm saying it right tucker trump hasn't kept any of his
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:20.120]  chief promises this horrendous system wasn't created overnight and it can't be fixed overnight so i
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:29.000]  think what he's saying is in a backhanded support i read that article you're not going to be able
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.040]  to defeat this overnight but trumps from the outsides he doesn't even know how to deal with it
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:40.440]  that's actually a good thing but where tuckers really wrong is he says trump hasn't gotten anything
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:48.040]  done he said he would and he list defund planned parenthood repeal obama care and build a wall
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:55.000]  now those are things that trump said that he would support but the republicans are wimps
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.440]  they're sold out they're cowards so a bunch of them 40 plus have stepped down we're getting
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:06.360]  some freedom caucus folks in they get attacked with guns and people try to kill them but we're
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:12.440]  moving forward but i get trying to put heat on the president to do more but the president's already
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:17.640]  done so much let's talk about what the president's actually done where he has executive power to do
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:22.760]  it he said he pulled out of the tpp that was written to totally sell out the us and transfer
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:29.080]  our power he did it he said he would appoint conservative judges in the supreme court wow two
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:38.200]  of them in the first two years and fought like hell to do it he also made populism and nationalism
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:44.520]  good again and gave us faith in ourselves or or at least said it was okay to like america
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:50.280]  and to love the flag and to believe in what our country stood for and then he got trillions of
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:59.480]  the stock market and over a trillion dollars in new jobs and the fastest growing blue collar and
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:08.360]  middle class paychecks you know there's an article by washington examiner that's one of the shorter
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:18.600]  list it's only read the headline here it's only 289 accomplishments because when i'm reading this
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.880]  which i've read the whole thing again today it gives me a headache because my brain starts
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:30.920]  working overtime it's way more than this but you go through it everything he had executive power over
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:35.880]  he's done or tried to do and then his own people brag oh well we just ignore it when he says he's
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:40.200]  going to sign executive order we just we just throw it away he's all about treason
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:45.960]  so economic growth never said it would hit three percent went way above four point two
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:49.640]  fellow reserve came into blocking and there's a huge list of those
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:55.880]  the a weights got cut veteran unemployment got cut black unemployment lowest level it just goes on
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:01.880]  and on american optimism went way up american income went way up deregulation written by globalist
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:08.680]  un regulations all got cut small businesses record growth tax cuts for the poor middle class let me
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:13.000]  tell you how they see me as wealthy my taxes went up i didn't bet you about it he got rid of the
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.680]  property tax right off because the blue states all do that as a scam not pay taxes
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:22.440]  trump blew it all away that's why so he actually like jfk he raised taxes on rich people cut it on
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:29.480]  poor people so we're really dealing here with a jfk type all these different worker development
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.120]  programs all the giant infrastructure preparedness healthcare he can't get rid of all of obama care
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:41.560]  but he got rid of the mandate domestic infrastructure 1.5 trillion combating opioids telling china you
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:45.640]  execute people ship and opioids into your country how about you execute yourself shipping in here
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:49.800]  they're the biggest importer as a weapon law and order all things he's done there
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:57.560]  and he said decriminalize uh medical marijuana which he said he would do border security they
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:01.240]  will never pass it republicans won't democrats won't so he put the military down there and it's
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:06.040]  the lowest level of illegal aliens in the last 30 years in the united states in latest numbers
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:12.920]  on trade again he's standing up for us getting better deals who can deny that that's why the
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:17.880]  globalists are all pissed off and the oh energy turning the cold back on which drives down our
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:23.240]  power prices farm policy bringing back sovereignty to the us doing what he said he do moving the us
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:27.720]  embassy to jerusalem veterans affairs it goes on and on so the idea we're going to come back and

[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:37.560]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:48.920]  all right so we just joined us tucker carlson has come out in the big german magazine interview
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:57.640]  and the headline is trump hasn't kept any of his chief promises now i'm not the cult i'm not the
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:01.400]  trump cult so tucker carlson is a smart guy and i respect what he's doing in fact i know what he's
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:05.720]  doing he's trying to point out that a lot of key things haven't been done a lot of fire under the
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:10.680]  president there's a lot of fire in the general public and to point out that as he says this
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:20.680]  horrendous system wasn't created overnight and it can't be fixed overnight but then he goes on
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:25.880]  to say his chief promises were that he would build the wall defund plan paranoid and repel
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:30.360]  obamacare and he hasn't done any of those things and there's lots of reasons for that but since
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:34.760]  i finished writing the book i've come to believe that trump's role is not as a conventional president
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:39.960]  who promises to get things achieved to congress and that does i don't think that he's capable
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:45.080]  i don't think he's capable of sustained focus i don't think he understands the system i don't
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:50.520]  think congress is on his side i don't think he and his own agenda support him he's not going to do
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:58.440]  that well gosh almighty we got a record economy turnaround tpp killed he's standing up the chai
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:03.880]  comms getting way better trade deals and all these other positive things are happening
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.240]  it's because trump isn't outsider never ran for office that he's so different
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:13.720]  he said he did fire all the lobbyists that's what threatens the system so much so
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.560]  i think if you look at two supreme court justices that are pretty conservative compared
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:24.200]  to what hillary would do light years better that's a big victory he said he would do that
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:29.560]  he said that was a main pillar he said a main pillar was securing our border and he wanted a wall
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:34.440]  as an as a image but we've got the military down there and it's record low number of illegal
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:42.200]  aliens in the country that's a national study he's got parts of obama care chopped up he can do
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:49.640]  executively the mandate and things like that but he's not a dictator so i just don't think it's fair
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:55.000]  to do this and it's kind of like anculture you know she's always got these flamboyant headlines
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:59.960]  about trump's a traitor he's the last republican president and sure it gets people to read what
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.720]  you're writing but i'm always getting accused of putting up flamboyant headlines to get readers
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:11.000]  no i put up the headline i think it's accurate now he goes on to admit that trump does ask the
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.680]  right questions that democrats don't care about working people in fact they hate them
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:19.720]  and that they are robbing people that they're corrupt they're bad well yeah trump's fighting
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:24.760]  the carbon tax he pulled out of that i mean there's so many things trump has done that i just don't
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:31.000]  think it's fair to say that what you should really say is trump's got an incredible amount of things
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.880]  done despite the gridlocking congress despite the cowardice of the republican party uh despite the
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:42.680]  fact the public is still generally asleep i mean how is he supposed to do everything if you just
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:48.520]  blame trump it's like you don't have arms or legs or a brain or a mouth you're just saying he didn't do
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:54.200]  it he didn't come from nowhere and go under all the attack and beat hillary he didn't lose two billion
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:59.640]  dollars out of his fortune since he ran and since they boycotted him he he is an under criminal
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:04.280]  investigation he isn't being harassed his family isn't harassed it's it's like what have you done
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:15.960]  for me lately it's this hyper decadent instant gratification culture i go to congress to go see
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:20.680]  what's happening and there's no constituents at house members doorways there's nobody talking to
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:26.680]  senators so they're senators like some god oh there's we sent a reporter to the border to show
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:31.160]  sends a thousand illegal aliens trying to come across you in funded it's our reporters and nobody
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:37.960]  else fox news maybe a mile away and i'm not bitching but i'm saying take a family vacation
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:42.200]  let the kids go to san diego you go down and videotape what's happening on the border you
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.400]  might catch something nobody else does and just getting the act of putting it on youtube or twitter
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:52.280]  or facebook get in the act of starting your own local news site what does buzz feed and
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:57.080]  sort george soros want they want local news reporting itself shut down they're blaming
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:02.040]  the uh yellow emergency jacket movement that spread over europe on the fact that
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:08.280]  locals can communicate period if we want to talk about where president rump's failed
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  in in in picking what he wants to to focus on he's done a great job trying to turn the economy on
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.760]  thinking that people would see that they've been under bad management and that he was for them
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:25.160]  so part of that they saw part of what they didn't he gets standing up to china who's absolutely
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.640]  dominating and taking over because they bought off our government he sees that as central he's
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:34.360]  right and boy they just arrested the head of the biggest chinese state-run company uh basically
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:38.920]  for espionage against this nation and our own corporate media is against him for that
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.280]  but if you want to know where he's failed he promised to appoint a commission to expose
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:49.400]  vaccines and all the damage they're causing the autoimmune responses he would do his own son baron
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:57.400]  he didn't do it and he has not he's he's spoken about it he's not not done enough yet on antitrust
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:03.320]  and lying to congress a big tech about censorship of nationalist christians conservatives and and
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:11.640]  patriot supporters he said he'd get out of afghanistan and then now they understand it's about
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:17.080]  blocking china moving into afghanistan so we have him he failed us on that i follow all the real issues
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:22.840]  but compared to a hillary clinton it's night and day and trump's trying as hard as he can
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:28.680]  to deliver on what he said he would do and so this process of getting pissed off and thinking
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:33.240]  he's betrayed us it's not accurate he will gain you brownie points with the mainstream medium
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:37.960]  and then they'll go retucker carlson's full interview where he actually indicts the democrats
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:43.640]  for hating america and hating the middle class and creating the crisis i'd get why carlson did it
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:51.400]  was to make himself look non-biased but i think overall it was probably quoted out of context
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:57.080]  as well and just goes too far over the other side but that isn't really what matters it's about us
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:02.600]  looking in the mirror and asking what we've done to restore this republic to restore our own futures
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:10.280]  to stand up to be involved and it's about recognizing that the democrats are totally gone the republicans
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:14.680]  are a bunch of blue blood scum and we've begun the process with the freedom caucus and others
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:19.240]  of getting real republicans elected that will vote with the president and that's happening
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:25.160]  that's what the democrats have had to resort to fraud now i know one of our affiliate relations
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:30.680]  guys does a great job scott bronson wanted to pop in and give his take on this i don't know what his
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:35.160]  take is yet exactly but he's always making good points in the hallways scott you wanted to come
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:41.160]  on here and talk about this give us your take uh yeah i believe that the product that tucker has
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:47.000]  just put the blame on the wrong wrong party uh i think it's the republicans the republicans are
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:53.800]  to blame for this it's not trump the republicans are losers they are losers and losers lose they
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:59.720]  controlled the house the senate and the executive branch they could have did whatever they want
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:06.120]  and they sat and they went for the tool of the loser compromise i want to compromise we need to
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:11.800]  come up with a deal there is no deal that can be made if you if you think you are right you either
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:16.680]  believe in the second amendment and people can own guns and all the stuff that comes with that or
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:22.280]  you don't you either believe in free speech and people are allowed to say everything that they want
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:27.640]  or you don't there's no compromise on those things you either believe that you need a
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:34.440]  defund plan parenthood and you take the steps to do that or you don't and it's not trump that hasn't
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:39.880]  done that it's our elected republicans that's right he went and marched uh repeatedly and
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:44.440]  started pants with the pro-life demonstrations something reagan wouldn't even do exactly he's
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:48.680]  done he has attempted everything he said he would do and gotten so much done that's why i don't want
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:53.880]  to say it's obscene as i respect her carlson but i mean it really is to sit back and say that he's
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:42:00.200]  done none of his main tenants what about tpp what about trying to defend the border what about getting
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:04.760]  good supreme court justice put in what about getting jobs to come back what about turning the economy
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:09.240]  back on he's done it all and now he's being counter-offenced by the federal reserve why didn't
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:12.760]  tucker carlson talk about the federal reserve and i'm not telling tucker what to do i'm not even mad
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:18.600]  at tucker it's good for debate i think tucker just wants to spur debate i don't know what he wants to
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:23.320]  do but i think he's putting the blame at the wrong people there's two there's two types of people out
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:28.440]  there now you have the republicans and then the republicans the republicans keep telling us oh we
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:35.320]  can't repeal obama care so then trump took the step that he could he took away the single payer uh to
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:41.560]  the the part where we have to pay if we don't have yeah yeah the mandate uh so he took that away
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:47.240]  that's what he could do it's on them to make the laws it's not the president's job to make laws
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:50.920]  well tucker makes that point that well he didn't from the swamp don't deal with it well that's
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:55.240]  always he's gotten anything done because you're right the whole swamp is a bunch of glad-handing

[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:17.880]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:25.960]  when you wake up in the morning and the light has hurt your head the first thing you do
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:32.600]  mark dies is coming up the third hour live oh the place you get mark dies lives infowars
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:36.760]  that's a better job live he does those viral videos
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:42.680]  look here is the bottom line as they say
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:50.280]  our country had half the world's wealth in 1955 with four percent of the world's population
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:55.720]  we had more money than 96 percent of people that means real assets because we had a middle class
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:48:01.080]  that's what produces wealth but the left teaches us having wealth made somebody else poor no that's
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:06.760]  not how it works real free market wealth creates more wealth like an engine it's like alchemy
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:14.200]  but trump has come in trying to remind people what made us great and he's under attack
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:18.600]  by the political establishment that sold us out and scott bronson he makes a lot of great
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:22.040]  points during the break it's one of our flit relations guys i've known scott for years
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:27.400]  probably 10 12 years uh he's working on the network for a higherman way scott
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:32.840]  you made another good point about the republicans they're just a bunch of lawyers acting like
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:38.600]  they're conservatives trying to make a deal on the democrats they're ideologues they're a cult
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:44.440]  they're the anti america anti god anti christ club restate what you just said during the break
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:50.760]  well i i think that the republicans are the people that people are voting for right now because
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:54.280]  they don't know what they want to do so they're not going to mess everything up but if you vote
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:49:00.200]  for the democrats they want a world that has no guns no borders and everything you can't say what
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:05.880]  you want so that's not a world i want to live in but the republicans they rely on the again the tool
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:10.280]  of the loser compromise they have no idea what they want to do and they think that the things that
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:16.840]  they they run on that they want to do that if they follow through with what they say that they're
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:21.240]  going to be that somehow that's going to punish them and everybody likes people that tell the
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:26.440]  truth so if you actually run on truth and follow through with what you're saying people will love
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:30.120]  you and they just they hide they coward and they wait
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:39.880]  because you're absolutely right when you ask why are they coming after us why are the republicans
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:45.800]  cowards why are they scared it's because look at how they come after us look at how they demonize
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:50.360]  info wars the truth is popular the truth is great so they censor it they block it they
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:56.840]  sue it they try to shut it down because the globalists can't compete with it a hundred percent and
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:03.000]  look uh trump has put more money in my pocket that's a good thing i know how to spend my money
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:08.120]  better than the government knows how to spend my money beyond that the media the corporate media
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:14.680]  says saying america exist is evil that american flags are bad that's obviously an outside foreign
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:20.920]  group like aliens show up they say lower your flags submit you your scum admit you're bad i mean this
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:28.280]  is 101 we're being taken over by people that literally like apple runs the worst slave factories
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:33.480]  pays people the worst and uses the communist party to kill people that try to organize even
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:38.920]  the communist party tells apple you're too brutal but because tim cook literally goes uh uh uh
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:46.760]  liberal i'm gay uh it's okay it's sick it's sick it's like the left funding the arab spring
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:51.400]  murdering over a million people blowing up all these countries and then the left's like it's
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:51:00.280]  beautiful no they're it's not beautiful you're sick evil scum me yeah i i don't get it um they used
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:08.200]  to me myself i'm more of a libertarian liberal i'm a i'm a liberal person um but i i cannot go to
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:13.000]  the left because they're against freedom they're against they're against everything that america
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:21.880]  used to be uh i they're they're terrifying what they want is absolutely terrifying to me so because
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:28.120]  of that i only have one side to go to and now because they've moved their lines so far to the
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:35.560]  left that i could believe in everything that is we used to be center now i'm far right now now i'm
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:42.600]  an evil person now i have to explain to my 12 year old kid that you're a white guy it's okay to be a
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:48.840]  white guy nobody nobody wants to get after you and hurt you but that's not the stuff that he sees he
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:54.520]  sees he sees things on the news about how white people are bad white men are the cause of all
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:52:00.120]  corporate media that is injecting the opposite of martin Luther king and then we have to deal with it
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:04.760]  if we tell our kids because my kids hear this too and i go no it's not true and they say daddy are
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:09.800]  you racist because whites are inherently evil and i'm like no that's not gonna play a martin
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:14.920]  with her clean a martin with her king club saying everybody's good it's what you stand for and and
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:20.040]  that makes sense to them but that's how whacked out this global of ideology is scott he put the
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:26.280]  great work god bless you thanks uh mark dice is coming up and you know i've covered a lot of the
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:29.640]  breaking news there's a lot of new breaking news in the last few hours uh trump has obviously

[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:12.680]  it in stock infowarstore.com here's one of his latest reports where he breaks all this down they
[02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:18.360]  just can't stop president george hw bush's funeral was yesterday but the liberal media couldn't take
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:25.000]  a break from their non-stop trump trashing and decided to use the occasion to continue to complain
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:31.640]  about the current president but what becomes undeniably obvious with every bio run about bush
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:39.080]  41 is that stark contrast between these two men over the last two years deviancy has continued
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:45.640]  being defined down by this current president his cronies his supporters look donald trump
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:53.640]  is 180 from whom george hw bush thank god the world looked at george bush because he was a leader
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:59.800]  respected he had proven himself this president has yet to do that this president that we have now is
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:05.000]  trying to unravel everything that he did and obama did i think he's doing this because he feels he
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:11.560]  has to do it i can't help but wonder if there was a thought bubble over donald trump's head
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:15.880]  just now what he was thinking i have to imagine he was thinking how much longer do i have to
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:19.400]  stand here we may not approve of this current president but that doesn't diminish one's respect
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:24.520]  for the office because there are a lot of things about george hw bush that maybe people now appreciate
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:29.960]  that they didn't appreciate the time and it just gives you a sense of the of the of the of the big
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:37.880]  character of the man and and and the contrast with the the small character we see uh we see today
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:43.240]  george bush believed in the institutions of government which i think too is another reason
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:47.880]  why this moment to remember and to compare and contrast is so important because our institutions
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:53.400]  are so under siege right now by the government itself and that is why we celebrate george hw
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:03:01.080]  bush's legacy and fear the next two years of mr trump's wild white house ride welcome back and
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:06.920]  we're still chatting with our panel about that moment at the bush uh 41 funeral when the trumps
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:13.560]  walked in and the air turned ice cold as he hit the pew uh and uh paul one thing i've seen with a lot
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:18.040]  of criticism of president trump uh in social media and elsewhere i have seen some conservatives
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:22.760]  criticizing hillary clinton who nodded at melania trump but did not acknowledge the president of
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:26.520]  the united states he didn't they he didn't reach all the way across two or three other people to
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:33.000]  take her to shake her hand so it's his fault it's of course it always is but but so what you know
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:38.280]  our president met the minimal standards of decency and that's news well that's certainly a very
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:43.640]  unique way to pay tribute to a former president by trashing their current one look what they even
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:50.440]  put on the lower third trump awkwardly greets ex-presidents at bush 41 funeral actually the
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:55.560]  only thing that looked awkward during the funeral was hillary clinton the heck is she doing here
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:59.640]  the poor woman can't even stand in a podium without breaking out into a coughing fit she
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:04.280]  can't walk down a flight of stairs without slipping and spreading her wrist and now she
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:08.840]  can't even sit in a chair without looking like she's about to pass out he saw the president of
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:13.560]  united states president trump sitting there watching all of this not giving a role to speak
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:19.080]  for unusual for an incumbent president at times seemed to be a little defiant he held his hands up
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:24.680]  arms up like this uh as if he wasn't quite happy with what he was hearing but otherwise kept quiet
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:31.800]  decided not to uh make any uh remarks to spoil the occasion so you know it was it was a coming
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:35.720]  together for a washington i think you know i don't like that'll jump at all but at least he didn't
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:40.760]  ruin george's hw budget funeral like we all thought he would even little ben Shapiro bill
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:45.720]  crystals neil khan protege revealed his true colors again putting out a photo of the current
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:49.720]  dad past president saying these three dudes are the best that we could come up with and the latest
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:54.200]  alternative was the terrible lady on the end common decent see ben would be to withhold your criticism
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:05:01.000]  until maybe in the last few months in full wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000]  of many of our best-selling items and then i came up with the idea last week let's not just extend
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:11.000]  the sale of free shipping store wide 50 to 75 off double patriot points let's extend that sale but
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:17.400]  also add a free gift with every order even if it's a tube of fluoride free colloidal silver
[02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:24.120]  iodine fortified super blue you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and
[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:28.520]  what i mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:33.480]  you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be
[02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:38.600]  another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have
[02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:43.960]  beyond any other sale we've ever had so this is a loss leader we are losing money on this
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:48.040]  this is our biggest sale ever get your free gift your free shipping everything and don't fight the

[02:08:00.120 --> 02:08:04.840]  get into some of the madness in hollywood the oscars debacle with kevin hart now having to step
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:09.640]  down he was going to host them but first of all regarding liberalism and the mental disorder that
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:15.800]  it is there is i mean it's not a joke this isn't hyperbole it really is some kind of a defect or
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:21.320]  or a disease or a mental disorder in fact there was a documentary produced by pbs hosted by david
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:26.840]  ego man which you can find on netflix or prime maybe even on youtube where he went to a neural
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:31.880]  imaging laboratory at virginia tech and one of the neurologists there discovered an interesting
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:39.480]  connection by scanning people's brains he has determined a test that with a 95 percent accuracy
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:46.040]  he can tell from an mri or an fmri functional mri whether or not someone is a liberal or a
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:50.360]  conservative and so that leads many people to wonder well what's the difference how can you
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:55.000]  tell from a brain scan whether someone is a left wing or right wing person and the answer
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:01.640]  makes perfect sense what he did is these people in the mri he showed them images of disgusting
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:08.120]  things like dead bodies and food being eaten by maggots anything that any normal person
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:13.880]  should be disgusted and repelled by just from the normal protective mechanisms that have
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:20.600]  been built into the human brain and liberals do not feel the levels of disgust that normal
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:28.520]  people do and in fact the less they feel disgusting disgusted towards seeing or experiencing what
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:34.520]  normal people see as disgusting things the more liberal they are which makes perfect sense because
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:40.120]  the liberals brains are defective they they can't see right and wrong their consciences are seared
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:45.480]  the bible calls it the reprobate mind because they've turned themselves over to evil and now
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:51.320]  this poor neurologist at virginia tex imaging laboratory is horrified really at his findings
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:57.160]  because think of the implications of this he has proved that liberals have no conscience that when
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:02.680]  they see something that should absolutely freak out a normal person they feel nothing they see
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:07.720]  nothing wrong with it because their their minds are literally defective let's you know you just
[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:11.800]  said one of the deepest things i've ever heard and i mean you're absolutely right this is everything
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:16.760]  because it's not just this one mri study they found that and we call it the modern term just
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:25.080]  like gay used to mean let's have a gay old time yabba dabba do time uh on the the plinstones
[02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:30.680]  now that word's been taken away you've made that point so now we call them liberal thomas jefferson
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:36.440]  was a liberal when pompeo said america wants to defend the liberal order again that means more
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:42.760]  personal freedom more your taxes more second amendment rights more property rights liberal
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:48.280]  just means you know more or or more open they're really leftist so when they do the studies and
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:55.000]  say liberals are mentally ill they're sociopathic or psychotic every study shows it nine times more
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:59.880]  likely in british and u.s studies show the same thing major universities liberals did did this
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:05.000]  they found that quote liberals really leftist are more likely to virtually signal but not actually
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:10.280]  give a charity nine times less likely to give a charity six times more likely to steal they found
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:16.520]  in russia in japan in the united states so what they are is they're sociopaths that have no moral
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:22.280]  compass so they're all but they know we have them so they project it out because that gets power
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:28.200]  over us and so what you're saying is absolutely true that that they actually like disgusting
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:32.600]  things they like two-year-olds being taught they're really a girl or a boy and being screwed up
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:41.000]  they they like child pornography as vice and the new york times and and and all these other
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:46.600]  things promote these really are evil people two years ago maybe even longer i'm losing track of
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:52.280]  time i posted a video or interviewed people in the senior boardwalk about incest and whether
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:59.240]  or not they thought that incest was disgusting or wrong as long as it was between two adults
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:04.440]  whether that be a brother and a sister or a father and his daughter as long as she was
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:10.040]  18 years old and many of the people here in san diego said that that was totally fine
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:17.960]  and they saw no difference between an incestuous relationship between an 18-year-old girl or woman
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:24.280]  and her father or a brother and a sister and they said that that's that's totally no different than
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:31.080]  you know a consenting heterosexual couple or consenting lgbt couple because they their their
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:35.640]  minds are literally defective and you can watch that it's on youtube and people were stunned when
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:43.800]  it first came out and now we're actually seeing the lgbt community embracing incest as part of
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:50.040]  their community and some of them are calling it gsa genetically sexually attracted couples
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:57.160]  we're seeing stories in the news of couples that are fathers and daughters and sons and their mothers
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:06.200]  and the the leftists the far left now they see no difference between that and a normal you know
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:11.400]  heterosexual couple and lgbt couple and years ago people would joke well what's next is it is it
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:16.520]  incest and unfortunately that's that's what is next you can't make this up it is horrifying and
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:21.160]  that's why in my book liberals and find a care i've been tracking this for so long and even for
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:25.560]  people have been following the news pretty closely it's far worse than you could possibly imagine
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:32.280]  and what i've been seeing for years and documenting and assessing and compiling and tracking the trends
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:38.680]  now we're starting to see it bubble up over the surface because nbc news is now highlighting
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:45.320]  couples who are raising their children gender-neutral the the they bees it's not a boy or girl in
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:49.880]  texas they're taking people's children away if the school convinces a six-year-old to start
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:54.840]  chemical castration and the parents say no the kids taken away and you know as you said we would
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:14:03.080]  always say what's next incest bc ality pedophilia it's all being promoted now it's all being pushed
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:10.040]  it's unbelievable and then and you can't swing a stick in a major city now and and not find where
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:15.720]  two-year-olds three-year-olds five-year-olds are being confused and jacked with and the left saying oh
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:22.280]  they're allowed to be of age now to decide they want to be sterilized no that's called child abuse
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:29.960]  this is so insane and just a few weeks ago at good morning america they had an 11-year-old drag
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:36.040]  kid on named desmond is amazing whose parents since he was even younger have been dressing him up
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:41.880]  in drag and taking him to drag queen festivals i know that you've covered the austin texas drag
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:46.600]  queen festival where of course there were children there and if you just criticize those parents if
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:53.160]  you dare to say that that's wrong or use even more harsh language then that's considered to be

[02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:19.560]  fall of culture yeah the the culture is cancer is that it's almost too late to to even interact
[02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:22.840]  with certain segments of it or to have your kids in public schools you're gonna have to put them
[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:28.360]  in private schools to avoid this madness plant parenthood just tweeted out last night an article
[02:23:28.360 --> 02:23:33.000]  by someone who said well the future is not female that's a big slogan of theirs you know the future
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:37.320]  is female the future is female not not equality it's they want to dominate of course but now if
[02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:43.320]  that's that's still not good enough because that's offensive now the future they say is non-binary
[02:23:43.320 --> 02:23:50.600]  and they're upset about the turfs the transgender exclusionary feminists who are fighting for
[02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:56.520]  feminism but they don't go along with this transgender choose your own gender like the women
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:00.600]  all getting famous feminists are being banned off twitter because they say no men are not women
[02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:04.520]  the sky is blue two plus two equals four they're banned too because they're making way
[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:09.880]  you wrote about this in some of your books this whole transhuman microchip everything
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:13.400]  they're we're gonna have to say clones are real we're gonna have to give rights to robots
[02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:18.200]  they're getting us ready just saying a man doesn't have a uterus but he doesn't have a cervix but
[02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:24.600]  you'll go to jail you'll be fired if he comes in and wants a pap smear four years ago now was when
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:31.320]  the mozilla ceo the the creator the firefox browser software was fired pushed out of his job the
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:37.320]  creator and ceo the company because it was discovered that six years earlier he donated
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:43.000]  like a thousand dollars of his own personal money to proposition eight in california which would have
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:48.680]  defined marriage as just between a man and a woman and so six years later they discovered that he
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:53.720]  he did that pushed him out of his job for simply supporting marriage between a man and one we're
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:58.200]  getting to the point where if you just simply say marriage is between a man and woman i don't care
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:02.360]  what the supreme court says they could say two plus two equals five it doesn't make it so i'm not
[02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:07.720]  going to like not i'm not going to use that term uh then you're going to be seen as just as bad as
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:13.560]  someone who's a member of the kkk so we're almost at the edge of the cliff of our culture and if we
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:19.240]  don't stop this madness the entire human race is going to be affected forever there's going to be
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:25.000]  small remnants of the normal people the christians those who won't go along with this it's getting so
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:30.040]  insane we saw they they're eating their own yesterday kevin hard comedian kevin hard who
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:35.400]  was chosen to host the oscars because the oscars were previously criticized for being too white
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:41.640]  remember the hashtag oscars so white so they they found the social justice warrior uh affirmative
[02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:47.160]  action hire kevin hard to host but then somebody went and dug through his previous tweets from
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:52.760]  almost a decade ago and he was making some jokes about some gay people and how he didn't want to
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:57.960]  have a gay son and get a whole bit about it and so now they said that that's hateful and to see the
[02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:03.320]  evolution of his downfall was quite fascinating it happened very very quick first he posted on his
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:07.480]  instagram you know these people need to get a life you know if you're nitpicking tweets from
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:12.760]  10 years ago and you can't understand that people grow and people change and don't feed the trolls
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:17.160]  and these people are finding finding things to get offensive about it's like yeah whatever
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:22.680]  and then like maybe an hour later he got the he got the call from the handlers and they said hey
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:28.360]  if you don't apologize um and you know have a scripted preplanned in-depth apology and probably
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:33.800]  go to some you know community service or you know invite some lgbt folks over for christmas dinner
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:39.560]  then you're you're out and to his credit at first he said i'm not gonna apologize you know if they
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:44.200]  don't want to have me host that's fine he's already apologized multiple times in previous
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:48.760]  interviews i think rolling stone even whole bunch of interviews he said hey yeah okay so some of that
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:53.480]  stuff you know you can't say that today it was a different time you know back 10 years ago obviously
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:59.720]  it was and then he got the talk from the rest of his team and then came the detailed i'm terribly
[02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:06.680]  sorry i you know i make amends i am evolving and so at first it looked like he was standing up the
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:11.720]  bullies and saying hey you know what you don't want to host the oscars that's that's fine you know i
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:17.960]  don't need to do that and then came the apology it's it's just incredible so now the the oscars
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:22.920]  and grammy's all these award shows are just hollywood propaganda constantly pushing the far
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:27.880]  left agenda so now it's going to be interesting to see because of this controversy they're going to
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:32.680]  inject even more of that oh but let me ask this question we're going to come back and get more
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:38.520]  into this but record low viewers to all these horrible hollywood shows all of its falling apart
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:43.880]  they're killing themselves the nfl 40 less viewers than three years ago so the good news is america
[02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:49.480]  and the world's turning against it but they can't stop because it's their total agenda and it'd be
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:53.720]  like if i turn into tv and like they were trying to teach my five-year-old about heterosexual sex
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:59.400]  i'd say you're a pedophile because it's lbgt p it's supposedly okay so we're going to break all

[02:32:03.880 --> 02:32:07.240]  consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper it consisted of the things that
[02:32:07.240 --> 02:32:11.720]  we're willing to fight for the first amendment the bill of rights the rest of the bill of rights
[02:32:11.720 --> 02:32:18.040]  are prohibitions they're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking
[02:32:18.040 --> 02:32:22.760]  those god-given rights from us as individuals you better understand that because they're taking them
[02:32:22.760 --> 02:32:31.080]  right now we have seen what they want to do they called it UN agenda 21 now they call it the UN
[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:37.000]  2030 agenda they want everybody off of the rural lands they want people out of the suburbs they
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:42.600]  want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control
[02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:48.200]  everyone it's the david night show never missed your show any day
[02:32:52.040 --> 02:32:55.160]  edit forwards dot com forward slash show
[02:32:59.240 --> 02:33:01.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:08.760]  in terms of power i've never felt like i had any power
[02:33:17.480 --> 02:33:23.560]  an apple you believe that technology needs to have a clear point of view on the challenge
[02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:31.560]  that's why we should only have one message you have no place on our platform
[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:42.840]  we have no time here an apple we are not afraid to say that our values drive our curations
[02:33:42.840 --> 02:33:49.320]  the secrets of the universe it's all there you have no place on our platform life is firing with
[02:33:49.320 --> 02:34:06.120]  its beauty you have no place i want to see you truly live i want to see you truly be who you are
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:18.920]  yeah in terms of power i've never felt like i had any power
[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:32.200]  in terms of power i've never felt like i had any power
[02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:45.800]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:53.960]  front lines of the info i'm gonna say something here reintroducing mark dice
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:59.160]  that's something out there here on air we've all heard but we're not talking to the general
[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:03.560]  listener that's smarter than i am in many cases on different topics we're all smarter than each
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:09.720]  other on some topics like our own personal lives but when it comes to different areas like being a
[02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:15.240]  diesel mechanic or being a brain surgeon or you know or or or being a school teacher you're
[02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:18.760]  probably smarter than i am but when it comes to studying geopolitics i'm pretty damn smart
[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:24.440]  because i've done some real studying and then looked at history and seen what's accurate and
[02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:31.320]  what isn't and here's the big announcement there are thousands of ideologies out there
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.960]  and different political systems but because i'd studied so much history
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:42.120]  and i'd studied so many white papers from the real establishment that we really knew what
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:47.080]  their program was for world government the attack on the family and the transgender movement and the
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:52.120]  open borders and the radical islam invasion and the caliphate and it sounded crazy because why would
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:59.400]  you wreck something good but they fundamentally want to control everything and women and men together
[02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:04.200]  with children and futures who are actually egalitarian and classically liberal and open
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:08.440]  that creates so much wealth and power that you can't have an authoritarian system
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:14.920]  so they use our classical liberalism with leftist evil which means luciferian left that
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:20.360]  path against us only thing similar between leftist and liberal is the l nothing else
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:26.280]  world government's out in the open global carbon tax is out in the open the attack on the family's
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:30.600]  out in the open mark dice what is it like because you've written i don't know 20 something books i
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:37.880]  forget we've republished famous books written 200 years ago on the subject uh when i saw americana
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:42.760]  and free market and the renaissance and everything i knew that was reality i knew the globalists were
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:48.760]  fighting that so i thought if we promote already the most powerful successful pro-human thing that
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:53.560]  ever existed i believe once globalism fully emerges with all its tyranny and all its
[02:36:54.200 --> 02:37:01.800]  oppression and all of its forced austerity that people will want the 1776 not the 1984
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:05.640]  we've proven that's true all over the world so here's the juxtapose what is it like
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:08.760]  because you've been involved politically and involved we've done each other like 16 years
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:13.480]  you've been involved like 18 years we're getting old here you're going to college you know for your
[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:19.400]  degree in in in media analysis then what is it like to a be right but then to be attacked more than
[02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:24.280]  ever and then what do you think comes out of this with nationalist winning everywhere and
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:29.080]  populist winning but the globalists still have the money in the media pressing the attack it's so
[02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:35.080]  explosive what would you call this time it's the most exciting time of my life it's one of the most
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:40.040]  critical points in world history for freedom because we've seen their plans you've seen their
[02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:45.320]  plans in 2010 i wrote a book titled the new world or facts and fiction and a lot of the
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:51.160]  stuff that we're talking about it we're experiencing now was sort of on the forefront or coming in the
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:56.600]  future things that the the globalists were planning it was on the horizon and now it's
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:38:01.800]  run us over now it's here and it's it's not just here i mean we're we're in the middle of it and
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:06.920]  there's a lot more people who support us than our vocal online because a lot of people just don't
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:10.600]  want to get involved with social media they don't want to have their tweets from 10 years ago come
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:16.680]  back to haunt them they don't want to be glued to their phone they don't want to be stuck in that
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:22.120]  digital gulag so they're they're talking at the dinner table they're talking at the water cooler
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:27.160]  they're supporting what it is that we're doing but it's very scary to see tim cook the CEO of the
[02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:33.560]  CEO of the most powerful wealthy corporation ever in the history of the planet saying that if somebody
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:39.160]  is just divisive now that you have no place on their platform a guy who you couldn't have you
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:45.080]  could do they're talking about me they're saying anyone that makes that divides us from the big
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:52.040]  motherships orders is gone now he was accepting an award for you know fighting hatred from the
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:58.360]  adl which is what that clip was that you played and the adl also is calling for the elimination of
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:04.600]  celebration of mother day and father's day so it's sort of more from an organization that was
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:11.480]  fighting anti-semitism to this social mothers oh i forgot they're for drag time tots if you
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:15.800]  don't want your two-year-old being taught they're really another sex the adl says you're a nazi
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:22.840]  well then screw you man what a what a cult of evil they have their guide guide for schools on
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:27.720]  their website where they say that they recommend public schools to not celebrate mother's day and
[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:35.000]  father's day anymore because that's divisive not using the terms to all of the i mean what a cult
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:40.200]  mother and father the flags bad schools everywhere banning christmas now they're planning red and
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:45.560]  green this is just a cult saying we control all knowledge you come to us to decide what language
[02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:51.480]  you can use what an incredible group of authoritarians what a group of monsters mark and you know some
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:56.840]  of the great thinkers in the past have put in these put these ideas and warnings into science
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:40:04.840]  fiction like george orwell in 1984 brave new world farenheit 451 and these people like tim cooker
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:11.320]  actually worse than the party and big brother and orwell warned us in 1984 which was published what
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:17.720]  like 60 years ago that the the government wanted to break up the family this is in the book obviously
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:22.760]  which is paralleling reality he was a high-level asian socialist communist uh the the character
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:26.680]  winston smith he had he wrote the nonfiction book he wrote the book was that a year later he wrote
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:32.280]  it in 47 it came out in 48 he he he was he believed in the ideas of communism and power people and
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:36.760]  he was high level when they said no we're just going to destroy everything for evil's sake he
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:43.960]  flipped out well there's a line in 1984 where winston is amusing a lot about how the government is
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:50.760]  breaking up the family so that nobody has allegiance to each other or to any centralized authority or
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:58.280]  any governing body or any any group that's going to instill morality and to have a support structure
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:02.920]  but it's a sense of being they don't want any past they're at war with history they're at war
[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:08.360]  with you having any roots so that people of course will look to the government as god the
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:15.640]  government replaces and the the military industrial complex is is a the police arm of that but the
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:21.560]  hollywood industrial complex is an extension of that power because they're the ones which shape
[02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:27.640]  the culture which andrew bright part so cleverly said the politics is downstream from the culture
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:33.800]  and so hollywood propaganda entertainment complex is constantly poisoning the minds
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:42.120]  of the masses of the kids every award show every every major there's a major breaking from it
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:48.760]  so they've intensified it how do you see that going they're losing their audience but unfortunately
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:53.240]  it's the audience is fragmenting and so they're co-opting a lot of youtube channels now they're
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:59.080]  co-opting a lot of alternative independent websites we are seeing them fail we're seeing a lot of
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:04.280]  these so-called new media sites on the internet like oh i've seen like top protesters that i know

[02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:23.640]  it's the most wonderful time of the year you know it's not just in the bbc or salon of
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:28.760]  the york time saying stations are reviewing many christmas songs and banning them like jingle bells
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:36.440]  and hey baby it's cold outside no they're banning dozens of songs they're evil everything must be
[02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:41.880]  projected on and made evil by the thought police and they can take good old fasting christian
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:46.680]  christmas music and get rid of it well that's another big victory for the thought police because
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:50.840]  then won't what you put up with and oh by the way we're going to sexualize your five-year-old
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:56.200]  we've got grown men dressed like women normally they've got to get in ice cream trucks and offer
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:48:01.400]  candy and have a puppy to kidnap your kid but now they're making grooming first contact and it's no
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:07.400]  big deal and they admit they are so get used to it because you roll over so you deserve it this big
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:12.440]  tech will come after your ass if you don't submit believe me tim cook on slave factories in china he
[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:19.960]  means business so i want to make this huge point because mark just alluded to it mark dice media
[02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:27.960]  commentator bestselling author i'm alex jones who's joined us here on radio or tv we know how
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:33.560]  this works we know that with the nazis or the communist in russia uh or in the time of rom and
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:42.440]  every culture the traitorous group that helps overthrow the good system is really looked down
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:47.160]  upon by those they're taking over so the weird little traders that were dishonorable they're
[02:48:47.160 --> 02:48:54.680]  always long-knifed after the real establishment gets into power like inst rom and the s a or hitler's
[02:48:54.680 --> 02:49:00.440]  brown shirts and so the buzz feeds and the salons follow the orders man you'd see it
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:07.880]  pedophilia is good all the same day uh families are bad and so they would come out and lie about us
[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:12.520]  and put out outrageous lies all in unison hundreds of publications and now that the big censorship
[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:18.840]  happened and the platforming of info wars news wars but wait we're still here though info wars
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:22.200]  dot com news wars dot com our reach has been diminished but our core audience bigger than
[02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:25.080]  ever but see they didn't really have a core audience they were just there to put up the
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:30.920]  talking point to create the illusion for corporations to think they had pressure on them to remove us
[02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:37.560]  to set the precedent to remove everybody and so now it's all over the news why the digital
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:43.640]  bubbles broken and put these articles on screen uh everybody's for sale they're all going bankrupt
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:49.880]  the weekly standard the neocon group shutting down all of it because now george sorrells doesn't
[02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:54.120]  need to spend two or three billion dollars like he did in the last cycle on that because he thinks
[02:49:54.680 --> 02:50:01.560]  he's shut everybody down oh and now you're not needed anymore what fools you know even a sociopath
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:07.320]  that was long-term smart would think you know i exist as a leftist anti-american trader because
[02:50:07.320 --> 02:50:11.400]  there's alex jones is out there fighting me for the republic you know you think you're really
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:15.080]  macchiabella you're not i don't do it from macchiabella in perspective you think i'm mentally
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:19.560]  ill that i have a conscience i tell the truth no we build civilization you destroy it but let me
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:23.240]  explain to you little sociopath something that you're not invented enough or smart enough to even get
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:30.040]  it if you really wanted to be sociopathic really smart long-term see you'd you wouldn't fight too
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:34.360]  hard and totally take out info wars because you'd want opposition once the opposition's gone with
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:40.520]  the fortarians they have no respect for anybody especially you they remove you globalist respect
[02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:49.400]  me they do not respect you because you don't have a soul in their view and so now thousands of digital
[02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:54.600]  sites that were front grips so the democrats are all going bankrupt they're doing monthly layoffs of
[02:50:54.600 --> 02:50:59.240]  20 percent so then just a few months they're all they're gone but don't say face they'll leave one
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:03.160]  person there to you know kind of put up a few articles because they don't need you now they
[02:51:03.160 --> 02:51:09.480]  write one press release it's then rewritten everywhere and republished and so you've just
[02:51:09.480 --> 02:51:17.640]  extincted all of yourselves by blowing up the free society you morons mark that's really incredible
[02:51:17.640 --> 02:51:25.400]  isn't it you talk about sticking your foot in your mouth a social networking site called tumblr
[02:51:25.400 --> 02:51:29.800]  which is sort of like instagram for the insane and thankfully they have their own community so
[02:51:29.800 --> 02:51:35.880]  that they can just kind of stay away from us but they just changed their policy to prevent all ban
[02:51:35.880 --> 02:51:41.720]  all adult content now and so they're screaming about censorship and they're so but the lgbt
[02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:47.480]  community they need to be posting their adult content and now you're oppressing them so now
[02:51:47.480 --> 02:51:54.520]  it's pendulum is swinging the the other way and we've seen megacorporations like sears which was
[02:51:54.520 --> 02:52:01.320]  the largest retailer in america now bankrupt now virtually unknown probably be completely
[02:52:01.320 --> 02:52:07.320]  shut down within the next 12 months gone when's the last time anybody used netscape to log on to
[02:52:07.320 --> 02:52:15.400]  the internet or america online so these once giants can fall so facebook apple twitter all of these
[02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:20.520]  places can come crumbling down and we have to remain vigilant to keep pushing back on them
[02:52:20.520 --> 02:52:24.600]  because they're not going to stop and it's hilarious we have to keep pointing out their laws
[02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:31.560]  because jack dorsi was just over in india and he showed a photo of somebody that there are a
[02:52:31.560 --> 02:52:37.480]  painting that somebody made for him that perpetuated the caste system and so the lower level
[02:52:37.480 --> 02:52:43.640]  peoples of society over there and the cast started criticizing jack dorsi for endorsing the
[02:52:43.640 --> 02:52:49.800]  social stratification separate system over there so he can't even win by going over there and trying
[02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:54.360]  to suck up to the people in india and we got to push back you know every time jack dorsi tweets
[02:52:54.360 --> 02:52:59.560]  something on twitter go follow him and respond everything that he says fill his timeline filled
[02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:05.960]  with a bunch of questions and and comments about what it is that he's doing because they are worse
[02:53:05.960 --> 02:53:11.400]  than big river in 1984 because with the push of a button they can make you disappear but it's great
[02:53:11.400 --> 02:53:17.320]  to see so many people waking up and i was relieved to see the donald trump jr responded to the
[02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:23.880]  controversy about rudolf torredo's reindeer last week by saying that quote liberalism is a disease
[02:53:23.880 --> 02:53:29.400]  and i know some people get into the weeds about well that liberalism doesn't mean what people
[02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:33.960]  say it is i would think at this point the word is almost tainted they've taken it over liberalism
[02:53:33.960 --> 02:53:39.640]  is now leftism it's it means an authoritarian control freak who's mentally ill and brain scans
[02:53:39.640 --> 02:53:46.440]  is a genetic psychopath yeah and we're seeing major companies like buzzfeed literally asking
[02:53:46.440 --> 02:53:52.200]  for donations the london guardian is asking for donations the weekly standard is going
[02:53:52.840 --> 02:53:58.120]  potentially going bankrupt the daily beast an extension of newsweek magazine that they're for
[02:53:58.120 --> 02:54:04.600]  sale and we've even seen the phony patriots on the right like glenn back who in 2011 started his
[02:54:04.600 --> 02:54:10.360]  new independent media empire when he left fox news which should be rivaling fox news by now but
[02:54:10.360 --> 02:54:18.200]  he's a complete phony most of you know this but now he has merged he's found a new host to suck
[02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:25.080]  the blood out of as the blaze has merged with cr tv which was doing very well in the online
[02:54:25.080 --> 02:54:30.840]  environment got a subscriber base some great hosts good content eric boling is over there
[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:37.560]  michelle mulkin was over there now she quit as soon as they announced the merger because glenn back
[02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:43.240]  is trying to suck the blood as the parent that's about to say glenn back is a died in the wool
[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:49.000]  leftist glenn back told a lot of truth at fox he only did to get the audience and tried to
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:56.360]  parlay it and they tried to sell us blaze tv blaze it was for sale they didn't sell they didn't
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:55:02.680]  merge they collapsed into cr tv and i guess to cr tv once there's hundreds of radio affiliates
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:09.000]  uh but that is just a disaster and i like cr tv and let me tell you back will always try to use
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:14.920]  his political power once he gets into a group he's all about controlling things he's all about dirty
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:18.520]  tricks you know he got threatened with what happened to us six seven years ago they said we're
[02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:22.760]  going to come at you we're going to sue you we're going to be platforming he just rolled over and
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:28.360]  thought he'd go be a darling on the left but then they rejected him as well uh so now even though most
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:33.480]  of the folks on cr tv were anti-trump which that's fine like levin and the rest of them now they're
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:38.840]  all pro-trump which is fine we were here we took the heat we've been targeted because we were steadfast
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:41.800]  mark i know you got to go we're going to break one do five more minutes with you and then we're
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:46.040]  going to have nick baggage come in and take over but let me just say this briefly everyone needs
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:49.560]  to get the book i don't care where you get it liberalism find a cure you need to read it but
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:53.480]  most of you as as patriots as conservatives and libertarians you already know all this
[02:55:53.480 --> 02:55:59.880]  you really really need to get the book and give it to everyone you know because
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:04.920]  mark dies isn't funded by the globalist i'm not funded by the globalist and separately
[02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:10.360]  towards soros as we speak has pulled out the stops i learned more stuff the last week that i
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:16.040]  haven't gotten into on air about just as we deceived his last wave of stuff at great expense
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:21.480]  they launched moving more treacherous activity uh and just financing really makes it easier for us
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:26.520]  to fight it's all in god's hands but info or store.com has free shipping store wide double
[02:56:26.520 --> 02:56:30.440]  patriot points but with whatever order you get on the next order from five percent to ten percent

[03:00:08.920 --> 03:00:12.600]  all right folks mark dies here with us and we were talking us so we're new five more minutes
[03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:17.560]  what do you want to hit and he said section 230 telecommunications act it's in the new nafta deal
[03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:22.680]  trump signed cutlow you know told him hey sign it and trump signs it's got a better deal for trade
[03:00:22.680 --> 03:00:28.520]  but it allows the companies to continue to censor the right and actually codifies it into
[03:00:28.520 --> 03:00:36.040]  international law yeah scroll down and i'll show him the new subsection uh right there section 230
[03:00:36.040 --> 03:00:45.080]  can be amended by the u.s and congress but now they've got a new subsection in the piece of
[03:00:45.080 --> 03:00:50.760]  international nafta legislation uh that allows them to engage in the mass censorship
[03:00:53.480 --> 03:00:56.920]  mark let's speak to this and the fact that you know we joke and say oh look the huffington
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:01:01.400]  post call for rudolf red nose reindeer to be banned and then within one day of it your defense of
[03:01:01.400 --> 03:01:06.520]  rudolf red nose reindeer had been demonetized and youtube upheld that that's how far we've gone
[03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:11.640]  that now rudolf the red nose reindeer the adl will probably give youtube an award for fighting this
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:17.240]  nazi yeah it's how poison the culture is and how infected it is with leftists most people are
[03:01:17.240 --> 03:01:21.240]  probably familiar with the controversy about rudolf the huffington post and a bunch of leftists
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:26.040]  said that it's you know sexist homophobic perpetuating gender norms and you know he
[03:01:26.040 --> 03:01:30.360]  he shouldn't be bullying rudolf even though the whole point is that you can overcome adversity and
[03:01:30.360 --> 03:01:35.160]  a perceived flaw can actually be a benefit and i mean a five-year-old understands the story so i
[03:01:35.160 --> 03:01:41.160]  did a video about the madness it was automatically demonetized by youtube system for whatever reason
[03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:46.040]  something that was said in the video was offensive and so the way youtube works is a lot of people
[03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:50.120]  may know this by now you have to submit the videos for a manual review and then it takes a couple
[03:01:50.120 --> 03:01:54.200]  days and then i'm scared to watch them so doesn't even really matter if they gets monetized later
[03:01:54.200 --> 03:02:00.840]  anyway but a manual review from a moderator demonetized the video and confirmed that the video
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:07.320]  was non advertiser friendly defending rudolf the red nose reindeer that's how affected the
[03:02:07.320 --> 03:02:11.960]  culture is with leftism and i just saw an article i thought it was fake news i thought it was satire
[03:02:11.960 --> 03:02:17.560]  i've seen multiple reports in it from respectable outlets the school principal banned all mentions
[03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:22.840]  of christmas and jesus and including and he put a list of things that teachers can't have in their
[03:02:22.840 --> 03:02:30.920]  classroom candy canes candy canes because he said that the candy king represents the j in jesus which
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:36.600]  i've never heard i've never seen a candy cane upside down uh this is the religion of the left
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:41.720]  where like they think clouds are racist because it looks like or the irish name of lynch means hang
[03:02:41.720 --> 03:02:46.840]  black people it's a total attack on reality it's a total mental illness it's like having schizophrenics
[03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:54.200]  run thanks us mca and trenches tech companies write the censor they say anything found objectionable
[03:02:54.200 --> 03:03:00.120]  will be banned and they're giving liability protection to do it in article 19.17 which is
[03:03:00.120 --> 03:03:06.600]  exactly what days later he said at the adl when they bragged that i was banned tim cook said we
[03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:12.200]  will ban anything objectionable that's whatever they want whenever they want always changing my god
[03:03:12.200 --> 03:03:17.000]  this is insane and they knew we were pushing back which is why they slipped it into that bill
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:21.480]  because there's a lot of people who are educated now about section 230 of the communications decency
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:27.880]  act which provides these tech companies safe harbor which means that they can't be sued for
[03:03:27.880 --> 03:03:34.520]  criminally or be beheld civilly or criminally liable for anything that any user posts on the
[03:03:34.520 --> 03:03:39.880]  platform because it's a it's a platform they're not responsible for moderating the content so
[03:03:39.880 --> 03:03:45.000]  they can't have it both ways they shouldn't be able to have it both ways whereas well if you're
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:49.240]  not going to be held liable for what's put on the platform then you can't moderate what's on the
[03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:54.520]  platform and that's why newspapers are liable for what they post because they're making editorial
[03:03:54.520 --> 03:04:00.680]  decisions and they post on their platform and they make the decision so if it's if it's a civil
[03:04:00.680 --> 03:04:07.000]  violation or if it's a criminal content they're liable whereas apple and twitter and all this
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:13.000]  facebook social media platforms they're not liable for what users post because of section 230 so
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:19.080]  section two they should either stop censoring unless it's a criminal content or there's a civil
[03:04:19.080 --> 03:04:25.320]  judgment players that something should be pulled or they should have their section 230 safe harbor
[03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:31.080]  pulled and we can't have it both ways right mark incredibly good point and that's why you're the

[03:04:55.400 --> 03:05:00.440]  wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items and
[03:05:00.440 --> 03:05:04.440]  then i came up with the idea last week let's not just extend the sale free shipping store wide
[03:05:04.440 --> 03:05:12.120]  50 to 75 percent off double page reappoints let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with

[03:05:17.160 --> 03:05:23.080]  you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what i mean by that is
[03:05:23.080 --> 03:05:27.560]  everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day
[03:05:27.560 --> 03:05:31.720]  they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another
[03:05:31.720 --> 03:05:36.520]  shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have
[03:05:36.520 --> 03:05:41.880]  beyond any other sale we've ever had so this is a loss leader we are losing money on this

[03:07:50.440 --> 03:07:56.440]  oh
[03:07:57.800 --> 03:08:04.600]  cal state san marcos held a whiteness forum in which they discussed topics relating to
[03:08:04.600 --> 03:08:13.400]  america systemic racism that was when they decided to bring up how vegetals is a racist
[03:08:13.400 --> 03:08:19.640]  cartoon you know the little series that teaches your children about the bible and eating vegetables
[03:08:19.640 --> 03:08:29.160]  well apparently vegetals is racist according to liberals the villains and vegetals have ethnic
[03:08:29.160 --> 03:08:36.440]  accents wait wait wait they're saying the vegetals are racist because the villains are vegetables
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:45.960]  of color what do you think i think you look like after crunch no i don't do it too when the kids see
[03:08:45.960 --> 03:08:52.360]  the good white character triumph over the bad colored vegetable character they see white as
[03:08:52.360 --> 03:09:00.040]  right and minorities as evil all vegetables are colorful the heroes are vegetables of color
[03:09:01.160 --> 03:09:05.240]  so the villains are going to be vegetables of color all of the characters are going to be
[03:09:05.240 --> 03:09:12.120]  vegetables of color because they're all vegetables in vegetals quick that is your cute just follow
[03:09:12.120 --> 03:09:24.040]  along with me watch the cucumber see how he moves i'm confused please please please show me these
[03:09:24.040 --> 03:09:32.600]  white vegetables on vegetals my son has vegetals movies and i've never seen a white tomato or a
[03:09:32.600 --> 03:09:39.080]  white squash so please show me these white vegetable characters and if you're talking about accents
[03:09:39.080 --> 03:09:45.400]  and how people speak and you're regarding english as something that only white people can use you're
[03:09:45.400 --> 03:09:53.000]  the racist one orange you right like only white people use proper english seriously that's racist
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:59.160]  to think that only white people use proper english what's wrong with you you freaking racist stop
[03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:05.560]  i'll throw it right back at you well maybe if they had an orange character in this
[03:10:05.560 --> 03:10:11.640]  vegetals classic that triumphed over everyone i'm sure they would say that this is teaching children
[03:10:11.640 --> 03:10:21.320]  that orange man is good and it's completely wrong yeah orange man bad they're just trying to add
[03:10:21.320 --> 03:10:28.520]  character to vegetables which is kind of hard to do when they're just vegetables where are these
[03:10:28.520 --> 03:10:35.720]  people getting these things we're taking anti-racist stance we sort of trace christianity through time
[03:10:35.720 --> 03:10:41.400]  we call it christianity the white religion because it's embracing these white ideologies such as
[03:10:42.600 --> 03:10:48.280]  sort of like this fear that we have yes this is an attack on christians and christianity
[03:10:48.280 --> 03:10:53.480]  because it's all biblical remember what your parents teach you and what you've learned from the bible
[03:10:53.480 --> 03:10:58.120]  if someone wants you to do something that you know is wrong stand firm and do what's right
[03:10:59.560 --> 03:11:04.360]  we're doing whiteface in comedy we felt like whiteface in comedy would be a good way to expose
[03:11:04.360 --> 03:11:10.280]  like white privilege and white domination because it's a good way it's a lighthearted way to bring
[03:11:10.280 --> 03:11:15.880]  up race without it being too offensive so in this class we look at how it is that white privilege
[03:11:15.880 --> 03:11:22.600]  and has been institutionalized and embedded in our public and social everyday lives
[03:11:22.600 --> 03:11:27.560]  uh and so that we can understand the system of racism that we currently live in
[03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:35.560]  veggie tails racist veggie tails racist veggie tails bigots bigots bigots bigots tree
[03:11:35.560 --> 03:11:44.040]  misogyny racist veggie tails it's veg veg red red red red red red red veggie tails
[03:11:44.040 --> 03:11:54.200]  time for racist veggie tails there you go i think i left out sexist veggie tails too i'm
[03:11:54.200 --> 03:12:01.080]  sure that will be the next one there's not enough female vegetable characters or they're enforcing
[03:12:01.080 --> 03:12:10.280]  gender roles on the vegetables yeah those most of those veggie tails are phallic shaped vegetables
[03:12:10.280 --> 03:12:18.600]  therefore it's sexist and it's enforcing gender stereotyping roles okay i just made that last
[03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:22.600]  one up
[03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:34.200]  there's not even the same universe i mean he is an abject psychopathic demon from hell people
[03:12:34.200 --> 03:12:41.400]  around her say she's so dark now and so evil and so possessed that they are having nightmares
[03:12:41.400 --> 03:12:46.040]  they're freaking out let me say listen obama and hillary both smell like sulfur
[03:12:47.800 --> 03:12:59.000]  whiskey bottles and brand new cars oak tree in my way there's too much coke and too much smoke
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:07.480]  look what's going on inside you at this point i have two words for you
[03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:10.840]  can't you smell that smell
[03:13:10.840 --> 03:13:28.840]  there's uh radio he said me and hihший ard Хотiman said we smell like
[03:13:58.840 --> 03:14:02.840]  It's foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[03:14:02.840 --> 03:14:24.840]  There's a lot of flies in here and the center is going to do something about these flies.
[03:14:33.840 --> 03:14:41.840]  Welcome back to Wimplewars.com. This is Dr. Nick Beggis standing in in this last hour.
[03:14:41.840 --> 03:14:56.840]  I'm sorry about the confusion. I'm in a little remote location. I'm headed down to visit Alex here in a couple of days and do some work live in the studio.
[03:14:56.840 --> 03:15:11.840]  So I want to get into a little different topic today. I want to go back to some of my traditional subject matter, which is really the issue of mind control manipulation of human behavior.
[03:15:11.840 --> 03:15:24.840]  Which is what we're dealing with right now when we look at the media, we look at what's happening around the world. This is the core of behavior modification on a grand scale.
[03:15:24.840 --> 03:15:39.840]  And so we're going to cover that today. We're going to get into some details. We've got a few segments left and we want to get into this to really talk about the new world order and where we're headed, where this is going and what we can do.
[03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:55.840]  You're listening to Alex Jones. This is Dr. Nick Beggis and you'll be right back shortly.
[03:16:09.840 --> 03:16:20.840]  It's the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away. Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution. Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[03:17:09.840 --> 03:17:32.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.840 --> 03:17:44.840]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:44.840 --> 03:18:03.840]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:18:14.840 --> 03:18:26.840]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:26.840 --> 03:18:37.840]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:18:37.840 --> 03:18:48.840]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:48.840 --> 03:18:53.840]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:18:53.840 --> 03:19:08.840]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk. Believe me, I know. I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:19:08.840 --> 03:19:34.840]  But thanks to supermail vitality at infowarstore.com, I still have that energy. There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:20:05.840 --> 03:20:26.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Vagage. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:26.840 --> 03:20:46.840]  Hey, welcome back. And I appreciate everyone being here and supporting this network. I am really proud to be a substitute host here with with Alex and the team. What a great team it is to work with highly professional, very skilled, great job they do and I appreciate it.
[03:20:46.840 --> 03:21:01.840]  You know, talking about mind control issues, which is one of the areas where I've covered over the last 20 years, one of the first subjects that we talked about with Alex, you know, when we when we look at sort of what's happening.
[03:21:01.840 --> 03:21:17.840]  When you think of the media and how the media works, it generates a certain level of fear, anxiety, tension, the things that actually disturb a person's ability to reach your higher states of awareness.
[03:21:17.840 --> 03:21:35.840]  Your, your way, the way to focus, look at things is altered by the way media comes at us on the on the screen right now is a reference to the CIA MK alter mind control experiments which go back to the 1950s, 1960s.
[03:21:35.840 --> 03:21:47.840]  These projects were huge. And they were looking at a number of different ways to affect people. One was chemical using chemical substances that would affect people's human behavior.
[03:21:47.840 --> 03:22:06.840]  Things like LSD, hallucinogenics of various types were tried. Other things that were utilized in these experiments were electromagnetic signals, signals that could manipulate human behavior in a very subtle way.
[03:22:06.840 --> 03:22:19.840]  In fact, if you look at the work of Persinger at Laurentian University, what he did is a study on the effects of manipulating emotions, which is a relatively simple thing.
[03:22:19.840 --> 03:22:38.840]  And the way it's done is, is a signal is sent in and the brain literally locks onto these external signals. And it's based on a pulse rate, a specific frequency that overlays and connects with the human brain.
[03:22:38.840 --> 03:22:53.840]  And so what you can do and what Persinger said we could do is you could broadcast a signal across a large geographic area that created say a certain amount of anxiety, fear, and then just run the normal newsfeed through the media.
[03:22:53.840 --> 03:23:13.840]  And you'll see really clearly the ability to move a population on the screen now is a is a great illustration. And what it's showing is some of the very deep states of brain activity and up to the beta the active state.
[03:23:13.840 --> 03:23:28.840]  And so what you have in the beginning deep states of sleep are delta that's below four hertz. This is pulses per second. And so what happens below that level this is where you are in that deep, deep state of dreaming.
[03:23:28.840 --> 03:23:33.840]  Now artificially, it's very difficult to drive a person there.
[03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:51.840]  Now the state above that theta is very easy. It's four to eight hertz. Now this is where you are in deep meditation and dream states, altered states of awareness, and they can push you into this.
[03:23:51.840 --> 03:24:06.840]  And what happens with this with this push is the brain locks on and what's called a frequency following response, where you literally lock on you begin to mirror the signal, and you fall into that emotional state.
[03:24:06.840 --> 03:24:21.840]  And then you think about it. When when you're getting a broadcast coming in and it can come in through television, radio, any electromagnetic carrier, your cell phone device.
[03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:31.840]  Just think about anything that carries a signal, whether it's your power grid coming into your house or broadcast signals.
[03:24:31.840 --> 03:24:41.840]  And what you can do is you can piggyback a signal and you can keep that and you receive it, but the brain will change and move into this.
[03:24:41.840 --> 03:24:43.840]  This other frame of reference.
[03:24:43.840 --> 03:24:56.840]  And so what happens then is you can literally program a population emotionally and then feed in the normal news feed through say a television.
[03:24:56.840 --> 03:25:04.840]  And that information is anchored fundamentally deeper.
[03:25:04.840 --> 03:25:10.840]  And you perceive the world also the way you interact with the world. It's very, very simple.
[03:25:10.840 --> 03:25:18.840]  And so it's a matter of generating fear, anxiety to shut down.
[03:25:18.840 --> 03:25:26.840]  And then to add in a signal that distorts the way we are normally functioning.
[03:25:26.840 --> 03:25:34.840]  And so when you think about frequency following response, think about anything that can carry that signal.
[03:25:34.840 --> 03:25:36.840]  And now let me give you another example.
[03:25:36.840 --> 03:25:43.840]  From the standpoint of advertisers, this is very frequent method that's applied.
[03:25:43.840 --> 03:25:48.840]  And what they essentially do is create that background signal.
[03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:57.840]  And then when that background signal comes in, you fall into that suggestive state and then the advertising runs and it just anchors in.
[03:25:57.840 --> 03:26:02.840]  So this is used commercially, politically and otherwise.
[03:26:02.840 --> 03:26:10.840]  Now, when you think about controlling populations on a broader basis, think about some of the simpler things.
[03:26:10.840 --> 03:26:24.840]  Like the Googles and the apples and these organizations, Facebook, all of them have developed systems for not so much manipulating as monitoring.
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:31.840]  And then when you monitor people's activity, then you can deduce tremendous amount of data about them.
[03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:47.840]  In fact, these organizations have incorporated with China to create their social scoring because the Chinese won't let them do business there unless they have access to their systems and those data feeds and everything everybody's doing.
[03:26:47.840 --> 03:26:58.840]  So they've created social profiling programming for the communists and they're applying it commercially in the United States and the rest of the world.
[03:26:58.840 --> 03:27:06.840]  Only this is being run by the big CEOs of the shapers of opinion in the 21st century.
[03:27:06.840 --> 03:27:19.840]  And this is where the fundamental error is because when you consider the fact that they've developed these things for communists to control and manipulate their populations.
[03:27:19.840 --> 03:27:27.840]  And now they're using it to manipulate the speech of Americans by manipulating the feed of data.
[03:27:27.840 --> 03:27:34.840]  And this is through shadow banning, which Alex has talked about through banning this network.
[03:27:34.840 --> 03:27:50.840]  When you start to think about all of this, this is 1984 on steroids. Nobody expected this, but we predicted it 25 years ago and started talking about this 25 years ago.
[03:27:50.840 --> 03:27:55.840]  And when I look at where we've come, it's right on target.
[03:27:55.840 --> 03:28:12.840]  But here's the other part of this. Whenever you have these huge changes in politics, economics, our social platform, you end up creating attention, a pushback, and that pushback has begun.
[03:28:12.840 --> 03:28:22.840]  And this is what I see. It's moving people into action where we recognize we have no choice, we have to engage.
[03:28:22.840 --> 03:28:29.840]  And we can engage respectfully, we can engage consciously, and we can engage with an awareness that changes this world.
[03:28:29.840 --> 03:28:44.840]  This network is part of that change. The people who come on and speak on this network, we're here to inform, to elevate the consciousness of this population so we can take our governments back from around the world.
[03:28:44.840 --> 03:28:52.840]  We're going to be right back. This is Dr. Nick Baggage. I'm standing in for Alex Jones in this fourth hour on the Friday, and we'll be back with you shortly. Thanks for...

[03:30:53.840 --> 03:31:02.840]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the Infowar to fight the globalist and living a free society.
[03:31:02.840 --> 03:31:15.840]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S. to create the strongest, most concentrated, over-the-top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula that is safe.
[03:31:15.840 --> 03:31:26.840]  I know from using this myself the last few months and from seeing my friends and family use it that this new product is going to end up being the number one best-selling product at InfowarsLife.com because it works so well.
[03:31:26.840 --> 03:31:35.840]  This is a gift you want to give yourself and then rest assured you're fighting the Infowar so it's a total absolute sure win, no lose equation.
[03:31:35.840 --> 03:31:39.840]  Try AlphaPower, exclusively available at InfowarsLife.com for yourself.

[03:31:52.840 --> 03:31:59.840]  In the last few months, Infowars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:31:59.840 --> 03:32:05.840]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off double-patriot points.
[03:32:05.840 --> 03:32:11.840]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[03:32:11.840 --> 03:32:20.840]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:32:20.840 --> 03:32:24.840]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[03:32:24.840 --> 03:32:29.840]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[03:32:29.840 --> 03:32:32.840]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[03:32:32.840 --> 03:32:37.840]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[03:32:37.840 --> 03:32:40.840]  So this is a loss leader. We are losing money on this.
[03:32:40.840 --> 03:32:44.840]  This is our biggest sale ever. Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[03:32:44.840 --> 03:32:50.840]  And don't fight the crowds. InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:32:50.840 --> 03:33:03.840]  God bless you and thank you for your support.
[03:33:20.840 --> 03:33:33.840]  And welcome back to Infowars.com. This is Dr. Nick Begich, standing in in this fourth hour this Friday afternoon.
[03:33:33.840 --> 03:33:35.840]  And it's a pleasure to be with everyone again.
[03:33:35.840 --> 03:33:42.840]  We're getting into this mind control issue and area because it is fundamental to many of the things that are going on in the world right now.
[03:33:42.840 --> 03:33:48.840]  And during the last segment, I was talking about the frequency following response and how that works.
[03:33:48.840 --> 03:33:57.840]  And then I was also talking about the China social scoring and the overlay of that and how that can be applied commercially within the West and within the United States.
[03:33:57.840 --> 03:34:06.840]  And in fact, it is. And it's being used really to shape and push a public opinion in a way that has never been before.
[03:34:06.840 --> 03:34:15.840]  I mean, when you think about the internet and the information age that we're in, where you can literally gather any perspective that you want.
[03:34:15.840 --> 03:34:19.840]  And here's what's happened. It's actually worked the opposite of what people expected.
[03:34:19.840 --> 03:34:28.840]  People expected a more informed, a more interactive, a more cohesive global community, which didn't happen.
[03:34:28.840 --> 03:34:34.840]  They expected a more cohesive community within the U.S. That didn't really happen.
[03:34:34.840 --> 03:34:38.840]  What they got instead was the narrowing of people's perspective.
[03:34:38.840 --> 03:34:46.840]  In other words, people only get the data feeds that they're really interested in. So it kind of amplifies the wrong thinking.
[03:34:46.840 --> 03:34:53.840]  It doesn't really broaden the thinking. The way it used to be, we used to get three or four television stations, at least in my world.
[03:34:53.840 --> 03:35:00.840]  But what happened is you'd get sort of all of the news, the left, the right, the in the middle, all of it would come to us.
[03:35:00.840 --> 03:35:06.840]  And we would kind of discern and pick through and make our value judgments and decide what we wanted to believe.
[03:35:06.840 --> 03:35:11.840]  But we always kind of got both sides of the big issues. Today we don't do that.
[03:35:11.840 --> 03:35:18.840]  Because unless we purpose ourselves to look at our opposition, to look at those that oppose our ideas and ideals.
[03:35:18.840 --> 03:35:22.840]  So we understand the argument. So we are better prepared.
[03:35:22.840 --> 03:35:30.840]  So we don't have what happened to the left when they were living in their bubble world and their bubble burst because they didn't have the full picture.
[03:35:30.840 --> 03:35:32.840]  They didn't even know there was a debate going on.
[03:35:32.840 --> 03:35:36.840]  We should not follow the same direction as the liberals.
[03:35:36.840 --> 03:35:40.840]  We need to know what liberals are thinking. We need to know how they think.
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:42.840]  We know how to construct our arguments based on that.
[03:35:42.840 --> 03:35:46.840]  I come from a very liberal background in terms of my family.
[03:35:46.840 --> 03:35:51.840]  I'm a conservative, a very strict conservative, in fact, and a libertarian.
[03:35:51.840 --> 03:36:00.840]  But when I get into the debates with my brothers, which I do, and my sisters, which I do, and my mother, which I do, actually,
[03:36:00.840 --> 03:36:05.840]  they're pretty exciting debates if you're watching them from the outside because we differ so much.
[03:36:05.840 --> 03:36:13.840]  But there's some fundamental things that we do. We listen very carefully because we want to know how each other presents our arguments.
[03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:18.840]  And then we can listen to those arguments and decide, are they missing information?
[03:36:18.840 --> 03:36:21.840]  Is there something that they're missing that I need to inform them of?
[03:36:21.840 --> 03:36:26.840]  Am I missing information, which might change my opinion by listening actively and carefully?
[03:36:26.840 --> 03:36:32.840]  At the end of that listening, now I can feedback. And we have a discussion that leads us somewhere.
[03:36:32.840 --> 03:36:37.840]  And generally speaking, when we come to those debates, we come with a solution in mind.
[03:36:37.840 --> 03:36:40.840]  And that's kind of our standard in my family.
[03:36:40.840 --> 03:36:46.840]  Come with a solution, debate the solution, and then we all together can evolve, perhaps, a better solution.
[03:36:46.840 --> 03:36:50.840]  And again, this is sort of the distance.
[03:36:50.840 --> 03:36:57.840]  This is what the New World Order does not want, what globalists do not want, thinking people.
[03:36:57.840 --> 03:37:06.840]  We need to engage this creative mind that God gave us and begin to apply it in the work that we do and the actions that we engage in
[03:37:06.840 --> 03:37:09.840]  and the interface we have with other people.
[03:37:09.840 --> 03:37:18.840]  You know, when you walk into a room and you carry the joy of the creation in you, people see it, people recognize it,
[03:37:18.840 --> 03:37:23.840]  and people want to talk about it. You know, we're in the Christmas season, we're in the holiday season,
[03:37:23.840 --> 03:37:30.840]  a time to reflect on values, what's important to us, and the direction in which our government and country is going.
[03:37:30.840 --> 03:37:38.840]  We have an opportunity in this generation, perhaps the last generation even, on this planet. Who knows?
[03:37:38.840 --> 03:37:42.840]  You know, when the next coming is coming.
[03:37:42.840 --> 03:37:52.840]  But I can tell you this, we have an opportunity to see change. When there's trauma and there's trauma coming, people begin to wake up.
[03:37:52.840 --> 03:38:01.840]  People begin to recognize each other again and recognize the need to support one another again in the work we do professionally and otherwise.
[03:38:01.840 --> 03:38:09.840]  This kind of community of action coupled with values is what makes a country great.
[03:38:09.840 --> 03:38:13.840]  I was just on radio in Europe, on the biggest independent radio in Europe recently.
[03:38:13.840 --> 03:38:22.840]  And this is, you know, my surprise when we talk about Europe and what's happening in the US and the nationalistic movements happening throughout Europe,
[03:38:22.840 --> 03:38:27.840]  they're all driven by the same overlays. They lay a very specific thing culturally.
[03:38:27.840 --> 03:38:35.840]  I mean, whether I'm in Latin America or whether I'm in the United States or Canada or Europe, there's a little bit of a twist that the globalists apply
[03:38:35.840 --> 03:38:40.840]  in order to socially engineer the direction in which societies go.
[03:38:40.840 --> 03:38:44.840]  This is what we're seeing, but the pushback is coming from the right.
[03:38:44.840 --> 03:38:50.840]  It's coming from nationalists, not just in the United States, but nationalists in Great Britain, nationalists in Germany,
[03:38:50.840 --> 03:38:56.840]  nationalists who recognize that sovereign nations are still valid in the 21st century.
[03:38:56.840 --> 03:39:05.840]  One of my biggest surprises that I mentioned on radio here, the European Parliament that nobody in the European Parliament is elected.
[03:39:05.840 --> 03:39:11.840]  No one elects any of these people, and they call themselves a democratic institution.
[03:39:11.840 --> 03:39:14.840]  Give me a break.
[03:39:14.840 --> 03:39:22.840]  Most Europeans don't even have this cognitively in their head, and we were discussing it in Europe earlier in the week.
[03:39:22.840 --> 03:39:31.840]  The idea that most Europeans don't even contemplate the fact that these unelected people are determining to a great extent how Europe runs,
[03:39:31.840 --> 03:39:39.840]  and then their financial systems hand over to global bankers who control the euro across all of the countries within the European Union,
[03:39:39.840 --> 03:39:42.840]  with a few exceptions that didn't opt for the euro.
[03:39:42.840 --> 03:39:45.840]  Croatia won a case in point. They kept the Kuna.
[03:39:45.840 --> 03:39:54.840]  The point is that when you start to look at sort of the configuration, the detachment, because in the United States we understand one thing.
[03:39:54.840 --> 03:40:03.840]  Government comes and gains its validity from us as individual human beings, as individual living souls.
[03:40:03.840 --> 03:40:10.840]  We are the government. We form our government, and we need to take back that control of our government and assert our birthright
[03:40:10.840 --> 03:40:19.840]  as created human beings with certain rights fundamental to our very creation, and this is part of it.
[03:40:19.840 --> 03:40:27.840]  Governance comes from the people. The European Union, the European Parliament has a governance that does not come from the population.
[03:40:27.840 --> 03:40:35.840]  They have no authority. They should have no authority, and what's going on with the movements in Europe is exactly the right course of action
[03:40:35.840 --> 03:40:40.840]  at a time when we need to begin and continue to push back.
[03:40:40.840 --> 03:40:45.840]  We're all in this together as individual souls on this planet.
[03:40:45.840 --> 03:40:52.840]  We have different national interests that are clearly defined by our governments to some degree, by our citizens to a greater degree,
[03:40:52.840 --> 03:40:58.840]  and that's where we need to put our emphasis, recognize our differences across political spectrums,
[03:40:58.840 --> 03:41:03.840]  look for opportunities where there is correspondence of values where we can cooperate together.
[03:41:03.840 --> 03:41:10.840]  Otherwise, we need to stay out and get out, and we need to ask people to excuse themselves from our affairs as well
[03:41:10.840 --> 03:41:15.840]  when they don't have a vested interest and are not citizens of this country.
[03:41:15.840 --> 03:41:24.840]  You know, a big changes are coming. We're going to see as much as everything is rosy today, there is a wave of building,
[03:41:24.840 --> 03:41:31.840]  the bubble will one day burst, and then we will really need to rely on one another more so than we ever have before.
[03:41:31.840 --> 03:41:40.840]  You know, recently in the last week, last Friday, I was in Alaska in my home, we had one of the biggest earthquakes that we've had since 1964.
[03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:48.840]  What does it do when these things happen? People quickly recognize the need to support one another.
[03:41:48.840 --> 03:41:57.840]  We were lucky. We had no serious injuries. We had no deaths, but we had people pulling together from the very moments of the beginning of that
[03:41:57.840 --> 03:42:06.840]  because that represents the character, the character of Americans, where in the worst of situations, we stand together, we pull together,
[03:42:06.840 --> 03:42:12.840]  and we make our systems work. You know, disasters of all different kinds happen.
[03:42:12.840 --> 03:42:17.840]  There are fires in California. We have earthquakes in Alaska. We have hurricanes in the Southeast.
[03:42:17.840 --> 03:42:27.840]  All of these things remind us, first, our vulnerability, and then secondly, our need to come together as human beings,
[03:42:27.840 --> 03:42:32.840]  begin to support each other in a more vibrant way, a way that truly changes the world.
[03:42:32.840 --> 03:42:37.840]  We're headed into a break. I again want to ask you to support Infowars.com.
[03:42:37.840 --> 03:42:42.840]  If you want information on our books and products, go to the Infowars store and check it out.

[03:46:45.840 --> 03:46:53.840]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Glove will spring win. This is Infowars Darker Sour. We do your support. I'm counting on you.
[03:47:15.840 --> 03:47:35.840]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones show. This is Dr. Nick Beggis standing in in this fourth hour. I appreciate all of the listeners.
[03:47:35.840 --> 03:47:38.840]  I appreciate the guys in the booth keeping this thing moving along.
[03:47:38.840 --> 03:47:53.840]  And, you know, we've been covering a couple of different concepts. You know, we were talking about mind control, talking a little bit about sort of what's been happening in Europe and how things are sort of being framed and pushed in a very specific direction.
[03:47:53.840 --> 03:48:08.840]  And let's get back into sort of what's, you know, what is what is coming in my in my view. You know, first of all, we're going to have a new Congress in January, whatever can be done between now and then by the slain Congress ought to get done.
[03:48:08.840 --> 03:48:20.840]  Call your congressman, call your U.S. Senator, ask him to engage the conservative agenda now. Well, we still have a few months, a few weeks even to get maybe some things done.
[03:48:20.840 --> 03:48:35.840]  We're going to go back into gridlock, I'm afraid. This is going to be bad news. It's going to create a lot of tension. We'll see who blinks first. I'm confident that conservatives will prevail on this.
[03:48:35.840 --> 03:48:41.840]  But we need to hold steady and we need to support this network at this particular time.
[03:48:41.840 --> 03:48:58.840]  Infowars.com. Go to the info store, info war store. My books and videos are all there. There's the mind control book. There's earth rising, which deals with all the platform of various technologies that we've been talking over the weeks and in the past on this program.
[03:48:58.840 --> 03:49:13.840]  They're all there. And these were things that were predicted much, much before things actually emerged. There's hundreds and hundreds of sources cited there, very important in terms of documenting the facts, something that Alex does carefully.
[03:49:13.840 --> 03:49:26.840]  I do very carefully. Most of the hosts, as you know, those who watch the show, you see the exhibits, you see the information, you see those feeds that actually document the very things we're talking about.
[03:49:26.840 --> 03:49:41.840]  Now, jumping back to this sort of illusion of a republic that is being shoved out hard throat these days, I want to get back into sort of how does all of the data collection and the feedback that's now possible.
[03:49:41.840 --> 03:49:49.840]  The feedback is individually tailored for you. This is how Brexit worked and this is how Trump actually won.
[03:49:49.840 --> 03:50:02.840]  Taking big data, they were able to deduce 36 profiles of personality and within those profiles of personality, they were then able to target specific individuals.
[03:50:02.840 --> 03:50:10.840]  And let me give you some examples. If you could get 300 data points on an individual, you know, through the internet, what do they look at? What do they research?
[03:50:10.840 --> 03:50:21.840]  That kind of interactive feed, 300 data points give you as much information as if you had lived with that person for five years in terms of how those programs work.
[03:50:21.840 --> 03:50:37.840]  If you could get 3,000 bits of information, which is relatively easy in today's world of Facebook and social media, 3,000 data points get you the same information as someone who lived with you for 20 years.
[03:50:37.840 --> 03:50:42.840]  In fact, it can predict what you'll do better than you can.
[03:50:42.840 --> 03:50:48.840]  And so what they did with this big data is they targeted very specific groups.
[03:50:48.840 --> 03:51:00.840]  As an example in the southeast, where black voters were expected to vote per Hillary, they knew, Trump people knew they couldn't get those votes, but what they could do is neutralize those votes.
[03:51:00.840 --> 03:51:07.840]  And if those of you remember the ads that were running, there was police with black men on the ground and police dogs chewing on them.
[03:51:07.840 --> 03:51:13.840]  And in the background was Hillary's voice saying, we have to bring them to heal. We have to bring them to heal.
[03:51:13.840 --> 03:51:22.840]  And many will remember that. And she was commenting on inner city use in the big cities, but that ad neutralized minority voters in the southeast.
[03:51:22.840 --> 03:51:26.840]  They didn't go to the polls at all. They didn't vote for Trump, but they didn't vote for Hillary.
[03:51:26.840 --> 03:51:35.840]  This is the techniques that were used in the Trump run and also used in the Brexit exit because they were able to target specific people.
[03:51:35.840 --> 03:51:42.840]  Now, this can be used for you or against you. And this is the very important point in all of this is data.
[03:51:42.840 --> 03:51:49.840]  The data that we give so freely through social media and other means are used specifically to target our views.
[03:51:49.840 --> 03:51:56.840]  So what here's how it works in the long run, what you're going to see more and more of is they're going to look at, say, 99 issues, right?
[03:51:56.840 --> 03:52:01.840]  And they're going to find out the one issue or the two issues that you agree with some candidate.
[03:52:01.840 --> 03:52:11.840]  And then what's going to happen is you're only going to get information coming into your data feeds about that candidate that you support.
[03:52:11.840 --> 03:52:19.840]  In other words, the other 97 issues that they are involved in that you would never support them on, you won't hear about unless you're dialing into other types of media.
[03:52:19.840 --> 03:52:25.840]  So this is, again, why it's important to always get a feed that you search out.
[03:52:25.840 --> 03:52:33.840]  And that is contrary to who you are from time to time so that you can disturb the data fields.
[03:52:33.840 --> 03:52:39.840]  In fact, I'd recommend that routinely people do a search in the absolute opposite direction of your normal nature.
[03:52:39.840 --> 03:52:46.840]  Do 10 searches in the wrong direction, just so you screw up the programs that are being run against you.
[03:52:46.840 --> 03:52:53.840]  If people routinely do this, it will screw up their ability to predict and program the same with polling.
[03:52:53.840 --> 03:53:01.840]  Forget the polling. You know, either don't do it or give them screwed up information so that polls, which are totally unreliable today politically,
[03:53:01.840 --> 03:53:10.840]  they are not worth anything anymore because you can't get a clear profile because of the way data is collected and it's so broken up.
[03:53:10.840 --> 03:53:16.840]  But we can disrupt. We can participate as disruptors. That's who we are.
[03:53:16.840 --> 03:53:19.840]  We are disrupting this social order that we don't believe in.
[03:53:19.840 --> 03:53:28.840]  We can look at data feeds and how we do this. Just do a couple of searches in weird directions and chase them down for a little while.
[03:53:28.840 --> 03:53:31.840]  Spend 20 minutes every once in a while doing it.
[03:53:31.840 --> 03:53:37.840]  And then you screw up the people's ability to gather data and then use it against you.
[03:53:37.840 --> 03:53:40.840]  And then you'll get all kinds of stuff feeding back.
[03:53:40.840 --> 03:53:50.840]  But at least you've done a bit to put a bicycle wrench in the bicycle spokes as a new world order is riding down the hill.
[03:53:50.840 --> 03:53:53.840]  Those are simple things. The other is really even simpler.
[03:53:53.840 --> 03:54:01.840]  Turn off the TV. I mean it. Turn off the TV and then broaden your approach but then be specific.
[03:54:01.840 --> 03:54:10.840]  Listen to the alternative medias. Listen to those other ideas and then engage in learning and educating yourself.
[03:54:10.840 --> 03:54:16.840]  Don't accept the data feed from the new world order, which is the media of the 21st century.
[03:54:16.840 --> 03:54:20.840]  It is totally altered the way our society runs, the way our people function.
[03:54:20.840 --> 03:54:28.840]  This is working against our children and the successor generations that we in this generation have a responsibility to protect.
[03:54:28.840 --> 03:54:33.840]  And you know when I think about this, liberal or conservative, one thing I know that we can all agree on.
[03:54:33.840 --> 03:54:38.840]  The children of the future we care about. We haven't met them yet so we're not mad at them.
[03:54:38.840 --> 03:54:47.840]  Think about those unborn souls coming into this world and what world will we leave them?
[03:54:47.840 --> 03:54:54.840]  We have the opportunity to continue to push. And I say to all of the listeners around the world, don't give up.
[03:54:54.840 --> 03:55:07.840]  Continue to push against your government. Continue to push against change that moves this not backwards but forward into a life that recognizes those base values
[03:55:07.840 --> 03:55:15.840]  that in this part of the world were created over 200 years ago by our founding fathers who recognize the sovereignty of the individual
[03:55:15.840 --> 03:55:23.840]  and the rights of individuals as we project the world around us and our obligation and responsibilities to one another,
[03:55:23.840 --> 03:55:33.840]  both in terms of protecting our ability to speak freely, protecting our ability to practice our religions freely,
[03:55:33.840 --> 03:55:39.840]  to our ability to influence and control the political outcomes of our governments.
[03:55:39.840 --> 03:55:45.840]  These are fundamental to who we are, not just as Americans but as living souls on this planet.
[03:55:45.840 --> 03:55:51.840]  Taking our governments back, whether in the United States, Great Britain, Germany or around the world,
[03:55:51.840 --> 03:55:57.840]  what's happening now is the beginning of the pushback and we're all in the infrared war together.
[03:55:57.840 --> 03:56:03.840]  I want to remind people to support this network. Do the things that need to be done so we stay on the air.
[03:56:03.840 --> 03:56:12.840]  I keep forgetting. I never mentioned my own website but check out earthpulse.com.
[03:56:12.840 --> 03:56:17.840]  We have lots of things there that deal with the issues that we're talking about.
[03:56:17.840 --> 03:56:22.840]  A lot of free information there as well and we encourage you to access that and pass it on to others.
[03:56:22.840 --> 03:56:28.840]  Again, all of our stuff is offered through the info store and I really recommend that you do that.
[03:56:28.840 --> 03:56:35.840]  That gets us two bites of the apple. You support Alex, you support Info Wars and you support the work that I'm doing around the world
[03:56:35.840 --> 03:56:37.840]  and I appreciate it.
[03:56:37.840 --> 03:56:43.840]  Wrapping up this section, I want to talk about where do we go from here?
[03:56:43.840 --> 03:56:50.840]  In the Christmas season, we think about the values, the Christian values that most Americans share.
[03:56:50.840 --> 03:56:58.840]  These are values of consideration, of kindness, of courtesy, of courage.
[03:56:58.840 --> 03:57:03.840]  The ability to step in and stand up when others are falling down.
[03:57:03.840 --> 03:57:08.840]  This is who we are. This is who Americans are and this is who we have always been.
[03:57:08.840 --> 03:57:18.840]  One day, we will see it come back and the world is waiting for that day because the world recognizes that what comes out of this country has been good.
[03:57:18.840 --> 03:57:27.840]  It has changed the world and will continue to change the world and together on Info Wars, we are changing that world and we'll continue to change that world together.
[03:57:27.840 --> 03:57:32.840]  You're listening to Dr. Nick Begich. This is the last segment of this Friday afternoon.
[03:57:32.840 --> 03:57:42.840]  We all appreciate you out there making Info Wars strong, supporting us and helping us change the world together.
[03:57:42.840 --> 03:57:50.840]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018. Info Wars is proud to introduce the 12 days of Christmas.
[03:57:50.840 --> 03:57:59.840]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.

[03:58:39.840 --> 03:59:02.840]  Again, you are the resistance.
[03:59:09.840 --> 03:59:18.840]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email.
[03:59:18.840 --> 03:59:25.840]  So there's no way the sensors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:59:25.840 --> 03:59:33.840]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.

[03:59:40.840 --> 04:00:04.840]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
