[00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:14.987]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.130]  It's Friday, December 7th, 2018.
[00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.512]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.512 --> 00:00:42.153]  We'll be here for the next four hours in the War Room with Owen Troyer, Roger Stone, and others.
[00:00:42.153 --> 00:00:43.254]  We got Mark Dice coming up.
[00:00:43.254 --> 00:00:46.415]  We have Paul Watson joining us imminently.
[00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:50.136]  Here in just about 60 seconds with huge breaking news.
[00:00:50.136 --> 00:00:52.897]  We have Roger Stone with big breaking news and other guests today.
[00:00:52.897 --> 00:00:54.037]  Plus, we'll take your phone calls.
[00:00:55.154 --> 00:01:05.780]  I also have gotten some news the last few weeks that's coming to crystal clear clarity about the next phase of the attacks trying to break down InfoWars.
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.823]  And they see as a bellwether that once they get InfoWars taken down, they're going to make their move.
[00:01:09.823 --> 00:01:12.024]  You've seen the great energy behind it.
[00:01:12.024 --> 00:01:21.110]  They have looked at their equations, their political calculus, and we are seen as a army
[00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:30.853]  That's pro-America, an army of information warfare operatives that tell the truth, with our secret weapon, that once we've been taken out, then they'll make their main move on Trump.
[00:01:30.853 --> 00:01:39.517]  They've been giving those orders to take us down, and it has gone into the very criminal nature, and it just shows the type of fight we're in.
[00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:43.798]  The Federal Reserve is private run for profit, mainly owned by European robber barons.
[00:01:43.798 --> 00:01:45.599]  It's been trying to suppress the economy coming back.
[00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:51.854]  They've announced interest rate hikes over and over again now that it's admitted to be killing the economy.
[00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:54.437]  They say, OK, we won't raise interest rates yesterday.
[00:01:54.437 --> 00:01:55.778]  Stock market comes back.
[00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:58.161]  Today they go, oh, actually, we're going to do it.
[00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:59.823]  It plunges 400 more points.
[00:01:59.823 --> 00:02:01.484]  We'll be looking at all of that.
[00:02:01.484 --> 00:02:05.729]  Does Tucker Carlson write about Trump not delivering on any of his promises?
[00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.830]  That's a publicity grabbing.
[00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:08.652]  The thing that Tucker's done.
[00:02:08.652 --> 00:02:10.573]  I know why he's done it.
[00:02:10.573 --> 00:02:13.555]  But I'm going to be talking about that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:02:13.555 --> 00:02:14.476]  Is it accurate?
[00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:16.357]  Partially, but also not partially.
[00:02:16.357 --> 00:02:19.679]  So we're going to give an expert analysis with the real facts of that.
[00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:21.360]  But it's a good debate starter.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.562]  It's a way to get the president's attention.
[00:02:23.562 --> 00:02:26.564]  Something I'll be doing very, very soon in other ways.
[00:02:26.564 --> 00:02:27.584]  So that's all coming up.
[00:02:27.584 --> 00:02:34.249]  But when we return, Paul Watson will break down because he's lived off and on in France for a long time.
[00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:35.290]  The chain reaction.
[00:02:36.192 --> 00:02:42.218]  Because even the head of the EU, Juncker, even Macron says this could bring down the super-state EU, which is a good thing.
[00:02:42.218 --> 00:02:44.440]  It's an authoritarian regime.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.867]  And what's really happening with the Yellow Vest movement that is a nationalist, anti-radical Islam movement, it's not about the gas tax increase.
[00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:54.289]  That was the straw that broke the camel's back.
[00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:58.733]  We're going to break in two minutes, but Paul, give us a preview of what's coming up.
[00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:14.622]  Well, Alex, there's going to be a massive demonstration this weekend in Paris and in other cities, despite the fact, as we know, as we reported earlier this week, that Macron caved almost immediately on the request for the gas tax to be eliminated.
[00:03:14.622 --> 00:03:16.563]  First, they suspended it for six months.
[00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:19.443]  Now they, you know, canned it altogether.
[00:03:19.443 --> 00:03:25.685]  But their demands have not been met, proving, as you just said, the gas tax was not the only thing.
[00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:27.525]  It was a straw that broke the camel's back.
[00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:33.487]  So basically Macron was hailed as the saviour of globalism just over a year ago when he took office.
[00:03:33.487 --> 00:03:38.591]  Hillary Clinton tweeted, victory for Macron for France, the EU and the world.
[00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:43.335]  Sadiq Khan tweeted, the French people have chosen hope over fear and unity over division.
[00:03:43.335 --> 00:03:44.876]  He was hailed as the great saviour.
[00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:49.982]  Today, his approval rating is literally at 18%.
[00:03:49.982 --> 00:03:54.467]  And that was a poll before last weekend's riots, so it's probably even lower now.
[00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:55.769]  The army's heading to Paris.
[00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.433]  Some of the police have shown solidarity with the protesters.
[00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:02.217]  So it looks like there's going to be another big flashpoint this weekend, Alex.
[00:04:03.263 --> 00:04:06.904]  Let's be clear, Macron is the equivalent of a Vichy French trader.
[00:04:06.904 --> 00:04:11.585]  Those are the traders that worked with the Nazis and occupied France for five years during World War II.
[00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:15.766]  He's literally saying, you cannot have France.
[00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:17.907]  To be patriotic is to be bad.
[00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:20.207]  Patriotism means getting rid of your country.
[00:04:20.207 --> 00:04:25.329]  He has just made out, he said, we want to bring in 200 million North Africans in the next 20 years.
[00:04:25.329 --> 00:04:26.749]  We need to get rid of France.
[00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:28.729]  The heart of France is Africa.
[00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.710]  I mean, this guy is literally trying to kill the country.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.002]  No, precisely, and they all rallied behind him, and now they've all got egg on their faces.
[00:04:37.002 --> 00:04:45.944]  Initially, he supported limiting immigration, Alex, and then he flipped, and that's when his poll numbers started diving, so we can look at how that started as well after the break.
[00:04:45.944 --> 00:04:48.045]  And let's be clear, why is France so important?
[00:04:48.045 --> 00:04:52.047]  The globalists admit this is one of the final dominoes to bring them down.
[00:04:52.047 --> 00:04:53.747]  This is a devastating victory.
[00:04:53.747 --> 00:04:55.968]  We salute the yellow shirts.
[00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:06.659]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:08.220]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.122]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[00:05:13.122 --> 00:05:16.063]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[00:05:16.603 --> 00:05:19.344]  A free gift with every order.
[00:05:19.344 --> 00:05:28.189]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.870]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.233]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:39.614]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[00:05:40.154 --> 00:05:45.035]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[00:05:45.035 --> 00:05:46.576]  So this is a loss leader.
[00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:48.136]  We are losing money on this.
[00:05:48.136 --> 00:05:49.576]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:51.557]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[00:05:51.557 --> 00:05:52.897]  And don't fight the crowds.
[00:05:52.897 --> 00:05:54.318]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:54.318 --> 00:05:55.838]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.765]  We've got it.
[00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:13.150]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.815]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:46.657]  This is going to be one Friday broadcast you're not going to want to miss.
[00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:48.998]  And, oh, next week you don't want to miss any of those.
[00:06:48.998 --> 00:06:50.518]  And you know I don't hype stuff.
[00:06:50.518 --> 00:06:54.419]  And I tell you, believe me, you want to tune in next week.
[00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:59.480]  Every day of the week.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.600]  We have Communist China.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.562]  Putting spy chips on all the cell phones produced there, including Apple.
[00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:10.003]  This has come out!
[00:07:10.003 --> 00:07:12.424]  But they have the code keys to all the Apple phones.
[00:07:12.424 --> 00:07:13.704]  Why is that important?
[00:07:13.704 --> 00:07:15.585]  Well, it's beyond important.
[00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:24.609]  Because the second biggest phone maker in the world, that's bigger than Apple, had their chief operating officer arrested four days ago.
[00:07:24.609 --> 00:07:25.589]  We mentioned it.
[00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:26.470]  Now we know why.
[00:07:27.574 --> 00:07:30.515]  And it's not over trading with Iran and getting around sanctions.
[00:07:30.515 --> 00:07:32.115]  That's the cut and dry.
[00:07:32.115 --> 00:07:35.396]  It's the spy chips on the phones.
[00:07:35.396 --> 00:07:37.137]  The phones are illegal on U.S.
[00:07:37.137 --> 00:07:38.497]  military bases.
[00:07:38.497 --> 00:07:41.018]  It's the second biggest phone maker in the world.
[00:07:41.018 --> 00:07:42.498]  It's state-run in China.
[00:07:42.498 --> 00:07:48.479]  And the daughter of one of the top heads of the Communist Party is about to be extradited from Canada to the U.S.
[00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:50.040]  and China's calling it an act of war.
[00:07:50.962 --> 00:07:53.223]  Our trader media is attacking Trump for doing it.
[00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:55.403]  This is exactly what he should be doing.
[00:07:55.403 --> 00:07:58.944]  Arresting all the heads of these communist Chinese firms.
[00:07:58.944 --> 00:08:02.325]  Arrogant criminals.
[00:08:02.325 --> 00:08:03.625]  Let me explain this again.
[00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:11.307]  They found on these phones 10 years ago, chips that take over everything in your house, everything in your building, everything in your company.
[00:08:11.307 --> 00:08:14.868]  Steals your passcodes and then it passes on to China.
[00:08:14.868 --> 00:08:15.408]  You understand that?
[00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:20.564]  Now, the media is acting dumb saying they don't know why, but it's on record why.
[00:08:20.564 --> 00:08:24.366]  I'll give you the rest of the story next hour.
[00:08:24.366 --> 00:08:26.667]  Earth shattering.
[00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:29.108]  We're going to get, obviously, into what's really happening with the stock market.
[00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:31.770]  The Federal Reserve said they're going to raise rates again, signaling the decline.
[00:08:32.892 --> 00:08:36.055]  They bait-and-switched yesterday, saying, oh, we're going to stop raising rates.
[00:08:36.055 --> 00:08:37.216]  The stock market came back.
[00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:38.757]  They said, oh, we're going to raise them.
[00:08:38.757 --> 00:08:39.778]  This morning, it plunged.
[00:08:39.778 --> 00:08:41.160]  They're playing games here.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.524]  It's insider trading from the folks at the private New York head fed.
[00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:48.246]  They give their buddies in Wall Street what's about to happen, like George Soros.
[00:08:48.246 --> 00:08:50.628]  That's all coming up.
[00:08:50.628 --> 00:08:51.329]  Meanwhile, U.S.
[00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:54.592]  fears Iran planning massive regional war in the Middle East.
[00:08:54.592 --> 00:08:56.093]  That's exactly what they're planning.
[00:08:56.093 --> 00:08:56.674]  We'll look at that.
[00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:05.555]  First, let's go to Paul Joseph Watson with an update because he lives off and on in France and in Spain.
[00:09:05.555 --> 00:09:07.117]  He's in London now.
[00:09:07.117 --> 00:09:12.483]  France, 95% of speed cameras in one region destroyed overnight in a yellow vest protest.
[00:09:12.483 --> 00:09:16.487]  Beligard Macron predicts major violence, the fall of France.
[00:09:16.487 --> 00:09:20.351]  The French interior minister said a month ago, France is already basically gone if they don't reverse it now.
[00:09:22.267 --> 00:09:25.668]  Meanwhile, the EU says they're afraid the whole EU is about to collapse.
[00:09:25.668 --> 00:09:30.330]  Well, yeah, you want global carbon taxes, you want open borders, you want to conquer the nation.
[00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:40.854]  You thought humanity was asleep, but we now know the Yellow Vest are a nationalist populist movement that support Marie Le Pen, who's more hardcore than Trump.
[00:09:40.854 --> 00:09:44.115]  Paul Watson, break it down for us.
[00:09:44.115 --> 00:09:46.636]  Well, this has been brewing for a while, Alex.
[00:09:46.636 --> 00:09:51.298]  It's no surprise that over the past few decades, the top two selling books in France
[00:09:52.105 --> 00:09:52.946]  We're good to go.
[00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.152]  They obviously the yellow vest stems from it's a law in France.
[00:10:15.152 --> 00:10:23.276]  You have to have two high visibility jackets in your vehicle at all times, which illustrates the onerous bureaucracy that they have to live under.
[00:10:23.276 --> 00:10:26.218]  But this is a repudiation of a technocratic elite, Alex.
[00:10:26.218 --> 00:10:28.819]  It's a repudiation of the global warming tax.
[00:10:28.819 --> 00:10:35.603]  It's a repudiation of Macron, who is basically just a glorified administrator for the European Commission.
[00:10:35.603 --> 00:10:36.503]  He's not a president.
[00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:38.524]  He doesn't really have that much power.
[00:10:38.524 --> 00:10:40.045]  So it's again, it's this Trump effect.
[00:10:40.788 --> 00:10:45.391]  You know, there are anecdotal reports of these protesters chanting, we want Trump, we want Trump.
[00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:48.593]  It's almost a mirror image of what drove Trump to victory.
[00:10:48.593 --> 00:10:59.919]  It's a silent, forgotten, non-urban majority who've come to realise that their economic future has been sold down the river for cheap foreign labour, for cheap foreign goods.
[00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:10.145]  The rural towns, the rural areas in France are being emptied out, they're being depopulated because everyone's having to run into the dystopian metropolis city to try and get a job.
[00:11:10.945 --> 00:11:12.586]  Mainly in the service industry.
[00:11:12.586 --> 00:11:18.909]  That's their only option now because their industry's being hollowed out just like it was in the Rust Belt in America.
[00:11:18.909 --> 00:11:28.033]  Then you have the other factor which is the complete lack of integration of migrants and basically the fact that France is being reverse colonized.
[00:11:28.033 --> 00:11:35.316]  There were more mosques built in France over the past 30 years than Catholic churches built ever in the country.
[00:11:35.316 --> 00:11:37.457]  That gives you an illustration of what's going on there.
[00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:40.344]  So the country's being reverse colonized.
[00:11:40.344 --> 00:11:55.027]  And when you talk to these protesters, when you listen to what their demands are, it's very much centered on national identity and the complete lack of integration that the French government has presided over with these millions of mainly Muslim migrants coming into the country.
[00:11:55.027 --> 00:11:58.188]  This is basically Europe's autoimmune system is kicking in.
[00:11:58.188 --> 00:12:03.589]  They keep using France, like the California of Europe, as the test ground to see what they will put up with.
[00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:05.610]  And finally, they've made the French revolt.
[00:12:07.256 --> 00:12:10.057]  Yeah, it's like the autoimmune system thing.
[00:12:10.057 --> 00:12:12.418]  But this is funny, Alex.
[00:12:12.418 --> 00:12:16.559]  So we've got all these people on tape saying, this is why we're protesting.
[00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:18.320]  It's the soaring cost of living.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.400]  It's the gas tax.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.041]  It's the mass immigration.
[00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:21.861]  They're all on tape.
[00:12:21.861 --> 00:12:23.762]  They're all out on the streets saying this.
[00:12:23.762 --> 00:12:25.962]  But not according to BuzzFeed.
[00:12:25.962 --> 00:12:29.824]  BuzzFeed's figured out the real reason why these protests are happening.
[00:12:29.824 --> 00:12:36.546]  And it's because Facebook had an algorithm change at the start of the year, which more heavily featured local news.
[00:12:37.046 --> 00:12:40.468]  So these people don't have any legitimate grievances, Alex.
[00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:46.732]  It's just the fact that Facebook promoted certain pages over others in the past few months.
[00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:48.753]  So you know what they're doing there, don't you?
[00:12:48.753 --> 00:12:51.095]  These are the same people who deplatformed you.
[00:12:51.095 --> 00:12:57.399]  That's a dog whistle for Facebook to ban these protest pages that are organizing these protests.
[00:12:58.482 --> 00:12:59.543]  Let's expand.
[00:12:59.543 --> 00:13:02.124]  They're saying what globalists are saying.
[00:13:02.124 --> 00:13:05.365]  You can't have sports teams named after towns because that gives you an identity.
[00:13:05.365 --> 00:13:06.366]  Or named after a nation.
[00:13:06.366 --> 00:13:08.167]  The EU's been calling for that for a decade.
[00:13:08.167 --> 00:13:09.267]  Now they're doing it.
[00:13:09.267 --> 00:13:13.449]  In five years all the national names are banned in soccer and football.
[00:13:13.449 --> 00:13:14.190]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.611]  They're saying don't let people promote local news period.
[00:13:17.611 --> 00:13:22.874]  So we go from hate to extremists to right-wing to Alex Jones to ban everything local.
[00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:25.591]  Exactly.
[00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:27.752]  It's a dog whistle to try and ban these protests.
[00:13:27.752 --> 00:13:37.220]  Because again, when you have an Arab Spring and the left wing approves of them using social media to facilitate their protests, that's good and that should be encouraged.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:42.664]  But God forbid populists try to use the exact same tools for the exact same thing.
[00:13:42.664 --> 00:13:46.367]  Not only is it frowned upon, it's a dog whistle to try and get those pages banned.
[00:13:46.667 --> 00:13:48.648]  So of course it's not about an algorithm.
[00:13:48.648 --> 00:13:51.108]  That's not the reason they're out on the streets.
[00:13:51.108 --> 00:13:52.249]  Go and talk to them.
[00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:53.669]  Listen to what they're saying.
[00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:55.230]  Their cost of living is soaring.
[00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.350]  You moved out of France.
[00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.130]  I mean, let's talk about it.
[00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.352]  They took your steel mills where you worked and your dad worked and your brother worked.
[00:14:00.352 --> 00:14:01.232]  They took those away.
[00:14:01.232 --> 00:14:04.533]  So you guys took the money you had, moved and bought a bed and breakfast in France.
[00:14:04.533 --> 00:14:05.553]  It was hellish.
[00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.914]  And you said riots and Islamists running around everywhere.
[00:14:07.914 --> 00:14:09.835]  So you guys evacuated there two years ago.
[00:14:09.835 --> 00:14:11.535]  I mean, you know what you're talking about, Paul.
[00:14:11.535 --> 00:14:11.995]  Describe it.
[00:14:11.995 --> 00:14:13.936]  You told me you'll be in a little village.
[00:14:14.176 --> 00:14:17.706]  And there'll be Muslims running around, crapping all over the ground, screaming at people.
[00:14:19.938 --> 00:14:22.759]  Well, the prevalence of hijabs definitely increased.
[00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:29.981]  I mean, my parents were living in a very remote area, the local town, just in the five years that they were living there.
[00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:32.662]  You would go there at the start and it would be completely normal.
[00:14:32.662 --> 00:14:35.582]  Within five years, everyone was wearing a hijab.
[00:14:35.582 --> 00:14:37.663]  The pace of change was very rapid.
[00:14:37.663 --> 00:14:43.565]  And that's what a lot of people are seeing, even in the suburban areas, not just in the major cities.
[00:14:43.565 --> 00:14:44.945]  But it's interesting, you know, because
[00:14:45.894 --> 00:14:57.083]  Macron, despite being this completely arrogant sociopath, as many actual psychiatrists have said that he is a sociopath, you know, comparing himself to Jupiter, the Roman god, and things like that.
[00:14:57.083 --> 00:15:02.327]  He started off his tenure being somewhat wanting to control immigration.
[00:15:02.327 --> 00:15:04.549]  He talked about... It was a bait and switch.
[00:15:04.549 --> 00:15:05.209]  It was a bait and switch.
[00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:06.490]  Let me ask you this, Paul.
[00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.912]  What's going to happen in the 50 seconds we have left?
[00:15:08.912 --> 00:15:14.937]  A lot of experts say the EU is doomed forever, this is accelerating it, and now the rebellion under the Yellow Vest name is spreading across Europe.
[00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:17.432]  It's spreading across Europe.
[00:15:17.432 --> 00:15:18.933]  It's spreading to Germany, Belgium, Holland.
[00:15:18.933 --> 00:15:21.175]  They're arresting protest leaders in Holland.
[00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:23.837]  People are asking, is this the European Spring?
[00:15:23.837 --> 00:15:28.460]  It's certainly the biggest uprising in 50 years since the 1968 riots.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.783]  So this weekend is going to tell us whether it's going to kick into high gear or subside.
[00:15:32.783 --> 00:15:34.805]  It will give us a very clear indication.
[00:15:35.325 --> 00:15:41.369]  And just like they said on the Titanic's maiden voyage that not even God can sink this ship, McRod said, I'm God.
[00:15:41.369 --> 00:15:44.612]  And a couple years later, we're learning he's actually toilet paper.
[00:15:44.612 --> 00:15:49.315]  Read Paul's incredible reports at newswars.com and infowars.com and spread them.
[00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:54.278]  Paul, we'll be watching your reportage on this very closely and Dan Lyman reporting from Paris.
[00:15:54.278 --> 00:15:55.319]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:55.319 --> 00:15:55.960]  Stay with us.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.361]  Roger Stone with Big Breaking News.
[00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:01.001]  Hear that?
[00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:06.383]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:09.284]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:16:09.284 --> 00:16:12.865]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:16:12.865 --> 00:16:20.427]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[00:16:29.537 --> 00:16:34.320]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:40.205]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:16:40.205 --> 00:16:46.709]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.

[00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:05.565]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.565 --> 00:18:16.829]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.609 --> 00:18:26.792]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.792 --> 00:18:37.336]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.836 --> 00:18:40.458]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.458 --> 00:18:42.180]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:52.188]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.188 --> 00:18:54.830]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.534]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:08.526]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:19:08.526 --> 00:19:10.007]  Believe me, I know.
[00:19:10.007 --> 00:19:14.690]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.772]  But thanks to Super Male Vitality at Infowarestore.com.
[00:19:18.252 --> 00:19:19.933]  I still have that energy.
[00:19:19.933 --> 00:19:40.084]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[00:19:40.584 --> 00:19:44.587]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[00:19:44.587 --> 00:19:48.270]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:53.274]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[00:19:53.274 --> 00:19:55.996]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[00:19:55.996 --> 00:20:03.362]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:20:03.362 --> 00:20:06.024]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.603]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:20:31.603 --> 00:20:32.244]  to 3 p.m.
[00:20:32.244 --> 00:20:33.125]  Central.
[00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:34.327]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:34.327 --> 00:20:40.217]  The most demonized, the most lied about, the most attacked, the most censored transmission in the world because we are dead on accurate.
[00:20:41.397 --> 00:20:46.439]  You heard Paul Watson for years predicting an uprising in France against the EU and it leading to his fall.
[00:20:46.439 --> 00:20:47.799]  You see it happening.
[00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:53.981]  He's seen us months ago talking about MKUltra programming mass shooters from declassified documents.
[00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:55.681]  Now it's on DrugsReport.com today.
[00:20:55.681 --> 00:20:57.862]  It's all over big newspapers.
[00:20:57.862 --> 00:21:00.383]  Yahoo News, Reuters, The Sun.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:12.187]  Truth about CIA's illegal MKUltra mind control experiments using drugs, hypnosis and electronic devices to create assassins revealed in sensational new documents officials hid for decades.
[00:21:12.187 --> 00:21:13.968]  Even more is coming out.
[00:21:13.968 --> 00:21:17.431]  Like Theodore Kaczynski being in MKUltra.
[00:21:17.431 --> 00:21:19.012]  He of course was the Unabomber.
[00:21:20.896 --> 00:21:24.179]  It's all coming up today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:24.179 --> 00:21:27.942]  We're joined right now by Roger Stone.
[00:21:27.942 --> 00:21:29.283]  He's in the plane.
[00:21:29.283 --> 00:21:32.745]  They're about to close the door in the next five minutes, but I had to get him on.
[00:21:32.745 --> 00:21:33.406]  He predicted it.
[00:21:34.788 --> 00:21:36.949]  General Kelly, imminent departure.
[00:21:36.949 --> 00:21:38.590]  Now he has resigned.
[00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.692]  What does that signify?
[00:21:40.692 --> 00:21:49.757]  What does the news signify that, oh, Mueller's going to file these big court documents today that they even admit now, even the left is saying are nothing burgers?
[00:21:49.757 --> 00:21:51.498]  Give us the latest.
[00:21:51.498 --> 00:21:58.162]  Former chief advisor to Donald John Trump, who Trump called on Monday, a man with incredible guts, Roger Stone.
[00:21:59.796 --> 00:22:02.298]  Alex, it's an incredible day here.
[00:22:02.298 --> 00:22:05.320]  Again, InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.443]  We predicted the departure of General John Kelly.
[00:22:08.443 --> 00:22:09.744]  Here it is.
[00:22:09.744 --> 00:22:14.868]  Incredible tweet by the President today signaling exactly when he's going to drop the bomb.
[00:22:15.783 --> 00:22:29.941]  The day that Mueller announces his final report, he will have a devastating counterattack that lays out the criminality of Mueller, Clinton, Obama, Brennan, Comey, and the rest.
[00:22:29.941 --> 00:22:34.287]  Very clear from his tweet today that the president is hunkered down and ready for battle.
[00:22:35.227 --> 00:22:39.008]  Yesterday, I went to Washington, D.C.
[00:22:39.008 --> 00:22:47.051]  to take on Congressman Adam Schiff because I'm tired of his lies and smears and shifty org games.
[00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:52.413]  Tremendous response from that and a really energized group of patriots at the American
[00:22:53.013 --> 00:22:53.753]  We're good to go.
[00:23:07.517 --> 00:23:07.857]  That's right.
[00:23:07.857 --> 00:23:22.393]  In case some listeners or viewers haven't seen the tweet, there's quite a few about the big Clinton Foundation documents coming out that was paper play as if we already knew, that Comey and Rosenstein helped cover it up with illegal warrants, the fact that they all worked together.
[00:23:22.393 --> 00:23:24.095]  There's a whole group of tweets coming out.
[00:23:26.179 --> 00:23:29.061]  It's very clear the president is ready for battle.
[00:23:29.061 --> 00:23:33.903]  I ran into Rudy Giuliani, one of the president's attorneys, last night.
[00:23:33.903 --> 00:23:36.965]  He was looking very happy, very confident.
[00:23:36.965 --> 00:23:50.792]  You know, I think with presidents on a war footing, and he understands that the state move to take him down is around the corner, and he's poised to counterattack, I think to devastating effect.
[00:23:50.792 --> 00:23:51.993]  I really think he is ready.
[00:23:51.993 --> 00:23:53.654]  And he's got the goods.
[00:23:53.654 --> 00:23:55.195]  He is finally, I think, woke.
[00:23:55.795 --> 00:24:02.999]  And figured out that this isn't about Paul Manafort or Roger Stone or Jerry Corsi or Alex Jones.
[00:24:02.999 --> 00:24:06.000]  It's about taking out the President of the United States.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.644]  It's about undoing what they could not do at the ballot box in 2016.
[00:24:12.644 --> 00:24:18.107]  Roger, Trump obviously knows he has to take the gloves off right now.
[00:24:20.433 --> 00:24:21.894]  What do you expect him to do next?
[00:24:21.894 --> 00:24:24.775]  Because we need major counter-offensives now.
[00:24:24.775 --> 00:24:31.679]  He said treason charges coming, but does he have anybody in the Justice Department that aren't complete cowards?
[00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:32.779]  You know, I think he does.
[00:24:32.779 --> 00:24:36.661]  I think he has got the detonator in his hands, in my opinion.
[00:24:36.661 --> 00:24:39.723]  I think he is ready to make his move.
[00:24:39.723 --> 00:24:48.087]  And really the turning point, in my view, was when Paul Manafort's attorneys and Jerry Corsi's attorneys told the President's attorneys
[00:24:48.857 --> 00:24:51.358]  All the questioning is about the President.
[00:24:51.358 --> 00:24:56.419]  All the questioning is about taking down the Chief Executive.
[00:24:56.419 --> 00:24:58.279]  This isn't about his underlings.
[00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:00.540]  This isn't about his minions.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:05.861]  This is a speeding bullet heading directly for the head of the President.
[00:25:05.861 --> 00:25:12.803]  And we're highly confident that he's ready for an honorable war fight.
[00:25:13.729 --> 00:25:19.975]  And this is an incredible moment because with Nixon, his main opposition, you didn't have total proof of criminal activity.
[00:25:19.975 --> 00:25:27.701]  But as Trump is tweeting today, he's saying, it's Comey, it's Mueller, they are criminals, not Jerome Corsi.
[00:25:27.701 --> 00:25:29.283]  And so he's telling it like it is.
[00:25:29.283 --> 00:25:32.025]  They are criminals who he legally spied on the campaign.
[00:25:32.025 --> 00:25:34.487]  They are criminals that sold us out to Russia.
[00:25:34.487 --> 00:25:37.730]  They are criminals that are trying to overturn the election of the president.
[00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.613]  They are, and I cannot believe their chutzpah.
[00:25:42.456 --> 00:25:45.839]  It really is incredible that they are pushing ahead.
[00:25:45.839 --> 00:26:06.617]  You'll notice today the President in his tweets specifically pointing out the long, close relationship between Robert Mueller and James Comey, and also pointing out that the woman heading the investigation into Roger Stone, heading the investigation for the Mueller Group, is the former attorney for Hillary Clinton in the email case.
[00:26:07.414 --> 00:26:14.454]  And for the Clinton Foundation in a racketeering case, if that's not a stunning conflict of interest, I don't know what is.
[00:26:16.448 --> 00:26:23.875]  And of course, we are the ones that ferreted it out and pointed it out to the world that the former head lawyer for the Clinton Foundation is now the head prosecutor.
[00:26:23.875 --> 00:26:25.896]  I mean, Trump isn't even given this intel.
[00:26:25.896 --> 00:26:28.398]  We are the intel for America.
[00:26:28.398 --> 00:26:29.800]  Drudge Report is as well.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.002]  So the Washington Post is attacking Drudge Report today.
[00:26:32.002 --> 00:26:33.043]  And I'm not bragging.
[00:26:33.043 --> 00:26:34.624]  I don't want to be in this elite club.
[00:26:34.624 --> 00:26:38.107]  I'm like a general walking around the front lines wearing my insignia.
[00:26:38.107 --> 00:26:39.388]  They're gunning for us.
[00:26:39.388 --> 00:26:41.390]  That's why we need your prayers and more.
[00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.314]  Well, big stuff obviously coming in the next week here, Roger.
[00:26:44.314 --> 00:26:45.696]  You're involved heavily in it.
[00:26:45.696 --> 00:26:46.317]  We salute you.
[00:26:46.317 --> 00:26:53.588]  Everybody should just be watching newswars.com and infowars.com and stonecoldtruth.com because big stuff's coming next week.
[00:26:53.588 --> 00:26:54.289]  God bless you, Roger.
[00:26:55.051 --> 00:27:07.780]  Well, and join us today on The War Room at 5 o'clock Eastern, 4 o'clock Central, where Tina Gertz is going to talk to us about the White House Christmas Party, incredible decorations put up by Melania, and a special report.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:11.643]  Okay, and that's a little secret code, everybody, but the show starts at 3 p.m.
[00:27:11.643 --> 00:27:14.185]  Central, but Roger's always hosting in the second hour.
[00:27:14.185 --> 00:27:16.007]  All right, thank you so much, Roger.
[00:27:16.007 --> 00:27:16.907]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:27:16.907 --> 00:27:21.751]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's just stop right there and let you know that
[00:27:24.491 --> 00:27:34.476]  I don't know if I want to talk about this on air at this time, and I'm not whining, but it's kind of like you're a ship out in the sea under attack, and you're like, we're under fire, we're under fire, it's serious fire.
[00:27:34.476 --> 00:27:37.757]  Okay, we got about six big torpedoes coming at us.
[00:27:37.757 --> 00:27:40.459]  Then we're going to report our last position to everybody.
[00:27:40.459 --> 00:27:44.681]  But let me just tell you, this country is in a total war right now for its survival.
[00:27:44.681 --> 00:27:47.542]  And we need your prayers, number one, and I mean that's number one.
[00:27:47.542 --> 00:27:50.984]  Please pray for me, pray for my family, pray for this whole crew, please pray for M4 Wars.
[00:27:52.056 --> 00:27:55.419]  Please pray for our providence, our provision, and our protection.
[00:27:55.419 --> 00:27:58.041]  If that's God's will, please pray for us.
[00:27:58.041 --> 00:28:00.744]  And please spread the articles, the videos, the news.
[00:28:00.744 --> 00:28:04.907]  Without you getting it out there, what's the point of doing this and risking our lives?
[00:28:04.907 --> 00:28:11.333]  The enemy wants us shut down because they know our trajectory of what we've been doing has already given America and the world huge victories.
[00:28:12.841 --> 00:28:14.983]  But we've got to push that much harder.
[00:28:14.983 --> 00:28:18.707]  And that's why we've got free shipping store-wide until Christmas.
[00:28:18.707 --> 00:28:24.193]  Double Patriot points on your next order instead of 5 points on every dollar, it's 10 cents on every dollar towards your next order.
[00:28:24.193 --> 00:28:26.876]  And the biggest deal is, free shipping, 50 to 75% off on every order!
[00:28:26.876 --> 00:28:27.837]  It'll be a $10 order!
[00:28:27.837 --> 00:28:28.317]  A $7 order!
[00:28:28.317 --> 00:28:29.599]  You gotta step as low as $7!
[00:28:33.484 --> 00:28:37.185]  You can get a free high-quality t-shirt that says we're all Alex Jones.
[00:28:37.185 --> 00:28:39.126]  Don't censor me with a Gadsden flag.
[00:28:39.126 --> 00:28:40.787]  Very handsome shirt.
[00:28:40.787 --> 00:28:41.747]  You can pick your size.
[00:28:41.747 --> 00:28:42.448]  That's free!
[00:28:42.448 --> 00:28:45.569]  So with the free shipping and that, most orders are a lost leader.
[00:28:45.569 --> 00:28:49.370]  But I want to get this all out to folks and give you a great place to shop online.
[00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.091]  It's way better than brick and mortar and way better than Amazon.
[00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:54.672]  And it also supports America and a future.

[00:29:58.283 --> 00:30:05.248]  Our grandparents, our great-grandparents, they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.561]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.

[00:31:05.228 --> 00:31:07.570]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:11.013]  Our team is constantly on the lookout for newer and better ways to improve our products.
[00:31:11.013 --> 00:31:17.378]  That's why we're bringing you a brand new version of one of the newest fan-favorite products, The Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:31:17.378 --> 00:31:22.882]  The Real Red Pill Plus is an all-new version of the powerhouse preglanone product.

[00:31:59.738 --> 00:32:09.041]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:11.902]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:32:11.902 --> 00:32:17.944]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:32:18.624 --> 00:32:24.887]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:32:24.887 --> 00:32:31.190]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:38.113]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:32:39.253 --> 00:32:52.282]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:32:52.282 --> 00:32:56.525]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:32:56.525 --> 00:33:02.829]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:02.829 --> 00:33:05.451]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.686 --> 00:33:41.730]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:46.771]  I got up this morning at 5.30 and I went to InfoWars.com
[00:33:49.372 --> 00:33:50.953]  And I noticed it hadn't been updated yet.
[00:33:50.953 --> 00:33:51.393]  No big deal.
[00:33:51.393 --> 00:33:52.614]  It was about to be updated.
[00:33:52.614 --> 00:33:54.936]  They updated over in England at about 6 a.m.
[00:33:54.936 --> 00:33:57.577]  I went to drudgereport.com.
[00:33:57.577 --> 00:34:00.519]  Of course, it had been updated.
[00:34:00.519 --> 00:34:06.143]  And I don't know how Drudge and one other guy were up 24-7, but they are.
[00:34:06.143 --> 00:34:07.784]  And it was this little gem.
[00:34:07.784 --> 00:34:15.069]  Tucker, Trump hasn't kept any of his promises.
[00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:17.931]  And then I went on to read the article with the German newspaper.
[00:34:23.697 --> 00:34:28.098]  And it gave me a kind of a frustration headache as I was drinking my coffee at 5.30.
[00:34:28.098 --> 00:34:32.119]  I read the whole article.
[00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:35.820]  And I know what Tucker Carlson's trying to do with this.
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:39.841]  And I think some of the points he makes are very, very valid.
[00:34:39.841 --> 00:34:42.742]  But some aren't.
[00:34:42.742 --> 00:34:49.203]  And I think this is a little bit of him hedging his bets in case Trump goes down.
[00:34:49.203 --> 00:34:51.344]  And let me tell you, Carlson's really smart.
[00:34:52.796 --> 00:34:55.999]  And I respect him, and I think he's the smartest person on television.
[00:34:55.999 --> 00:34:59.061]  I really like Sean Hannity, too.
[00:34:59.061 --> 00:35:00.322]  They're both very influential.
[00:35:00.322 --> 00:35:08.669]  You know, they had the big national poll of media, and they found Matt Drudge is the most influential, and then a few other people will talk about that later.
[00:35:08.669 --> 00:35:13.493]  And the Washington Post, everybody attacked Matt Drudge, all out of jealousy.
[00:35:13.493 --> 00:35:14.995]  Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.
[00:35:14.995 --> 00:35:15.515]  Good Lord.
[00:35:19.167 --> 00:35:22.429]  In fact, this article I could talk about for two hours.
[00:35:22.429 --> 00:35:24.150]  Not because it's about drudge.
[00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:27.471]  It's about the lies of corporate media.
[00:35:27.471 --> 00:35:38.177]  Because everything they say about drudge is what they're doing themselves.
[00:35:38.177 --> 00:35:42.319]  They call him fake news and this purveyor of evil.
[00:35:42.319 --> 00:35:47.202]  I guess that's kind of true in a way because he links more to mainstream media than independent media.
[00:35:48.291 --> 00:35:50.393]  In a weird backhanded way, that's true.
[00:35:50.393 --> 00:35:51.675]  I'm not saying Drudge is bad to do that.
[00:35:51.675 --> 00:35:53.517]  He's showing all the different angles.
[00:35:53.517 --> 00:36:05.089]  But Drudge is just this portal into what he thinks is interesting and people tend to resonate with that because Drudge is a smart guy, but you read this and it's just like it's a war on reality.
[00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:08.092]  It's a war on logic.
[00:36:08.092 --> 00:36:10.395]  Drudge links to the Washington Post almost every day.
[00:36:13.086 --> 00:36:19.531]  And they even admit in major studies, like half the New York Times and Washington Post, traffic is routinely from Drudge.
[00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:25.456]  I mean, ours is like 10% because he links to us every once in a while.
[00:36:25.456 --> 00:36:28.999]  These people are incredible.
[00:36:28.999 --> 00:36:29.960]  Again, Drudge is horrible.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.081]  He links to evil.
[00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:32.302]  He's a bad person.
[00:36:32.302 --> 00:36:36.185]  And by the way, he's the reason we exist.
[00:36:36.185 --> 00:36:37.086]  It's kind of like Trump.
[00:36:38.288 --> 00:36:45.731]  Corporate media had absolutely no views, it was totally going bankrupt, but when they cover him, suddenly they get a dead cat bounce and it keeps him alive.
[00:36:45.731 --> 00:36:47.412]  They, of course, want him destroyed.
[00:36:47.412 --> 00:36:52.434]  The article is, Drudge takes the Oscar for cluelessness.
[00:36:52.434 --> 00:37:00.157]  Oh yeah, that's why one guy's more successful than Jeff Bezos pumping $600 million a year into the Washington Post.
[00:37:00.157 --> 00:37:03.479]  That's why he's got, what, 20, 30 times, I don't know, the traffic of the Washington Post?
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.241]  Because he's smart and you're not?
[00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:10.443]  Or he's not a traitor and you are?
[00:37:10.443 --> 00:37:19.008]  But see, they want him to not have a platform, they want me to not have a platform, they don't want Tucker Carlson, they really hate him.
[00:37:19.008 --> 00:37:28.693]  They don't want him to have a platform because we're independent, we're smarter than them, and we're not traitors, and that reminds them of what unpopular, lying scum they are.
[00:37:30.452 --> 00:37:31.873]  But I digress.
[00:37:31.873 --> 00:37:40.662]  That's why then I see an article like this, this interview with Carlson.
[00:37:40.662 --> 00:37:46.268]  And it's frustrating because I know why Carlson did this.
[00:37:46.268 --> 00:37:48.010]  He didn't tell me.
[00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:48.611]  I know.
[00:37:48.611 --> 00:37:51.033]  It's frustration.
[00:37:51.033 --> 00:37:52.795]  And from his perspective, he's right.
[00:37:54.107 --> 00:38:11.072]  But if you pull back from the perspective of not wanting instant gratification and looking at what Trump's working with, it's like Trump's built a spaceship with some gravel and some tin cans in the backyard that just got off the ground.
[00:38:11.072 --> 00:38:17.234]  Now it's on fire at about 50,000 feet and about to blow up, but you're still like, boy, he sure tried, didn't he?
[00:38:17.234 --> 00:38:18.755]  And then it's a reflection on us!
[00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:33.328]  I mean, if you don't admire trailblazers and people that go against the grain and deliver, even partially, it'd be like one guy playing from the NFL, playing 11 others.
[00:38:33.328 --> 00:38:37.611]  10 to 1, 11 to 1.
[00:38:37.611 --> 00:38:40.894]  And Trump only gets the ball down the field 50 yards.
[00:38:40.894 --> 00:38:44.557]  And since he didn't get it across the line, he sucks.
[00:38:44.557 --> 00:38:47.479]  No, he's fighting an uphill battle.
[00:38:56.732 --> 00:39:00.435]  See, that's why it's hard to cover a story like this, because there's so many facets to it.
[00:39:00.435 --> 00:39:05.639]  I can take one line that Tucker says, look at both angles of it for an hour, just one line of the story.
[00:39:05.639 --> 00:39:08.101]  Like, Trump doesn't really know what he's doing!
[00:39:08.101 --> 00:39:11.343]  He doesn't know how to control Washington, and that's why he can't get anything done!
[00:39:11.343 --> 00:39:15.146]  Well, because he's not part of them, that's why he's gotten so much done!
[00:39:15.146 --> 00:39:19.849]  Because he's not part of the good old boy network, because he really is the President!
[00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:22.371]  He really is returning power to the Oval Office!
[00:39:22.371 --> 00:39:23.752]  It's revolutionary!
[00:39:23.752 --> 00:39:25.434]  That alone, the nationalism!
[00:39:26.657 --> 00:39:28.239]  Here's the problem.
[00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:34.084]  I don't have an hour to set aside for Trump's accomplishments, because there's different lists out there.
[00:39:34.084 --> 00:39:37.026]  Some are 1,000 long, some are 500 long.
[00:39:37.026 --> 00:39:41.010]  I've got one that's 280-something long here.
[00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:49.537]  And I was trying to look at it this morning at home, and by then my kids were up at 6.15 running around and we started getting breakfast going and things, and I had to stop looking at it.
[00:39:54.659 --> 00:40:02.000]  It made me sick to my stomach at the same time of giving me a headache because I realized we really are an instant gratification culture.
[00:40:03.786 --> 00:40:12.212]  And you look at everything Trump's been able to do, despite what he's working with, and the fact that more of us aren't involved in the field is why we may lose.
[00:40:12.212 --> 00:40:16.635]  You know, I've sent my reporters down, two different groups of them, to Mexico, U.S.
[00:40:16.635 --> 00:40:28.804]  border, Tijuana, San Diego, and every time they're there, they're outnumbered about 21 by leftist and antifa scumbags spitting in their face and cussing and yelling at them, where are the people
[00:40:31.769 --> 00:40:36.452]  Going down there as citizen journalist to show what's going on and to have the numbers.
[00:40:36.452 --> 00:40:41.715]  Oh, well, we're conservatives or we're Christians or we're business owners or we're parents, you know, we don't do that.
[00:40:41.715 --> 00:40:44.577]  We leave that to Alex Jones.
[00:40:44.577 --> 00:40:45.097]  Well, guess what?
[00:40:45.097 --> 00:40:46.998]  They just banned my ass.
[00:40:46.998 --> 00:40:48.719]  They can't stop all of you.
[00:40:48.719 --> 00:40:51.781]  So I'm not on your butt here.
[00:40:51.781 --> 00:40:53.202]  I'm just simply saying to everybody.
[00:40:54.707 --> 00:40:58.209]  We don't have any room to criticize what Trump's done.
[00:40:58.209 --> 00:41:03.172]  It's not about prostrating myself before Trump.
[00:41:03.172 --> 00:41:04.333]  It's the opposite.
[00:41:04.333 --> 00:41:12.278]  It's about looking at what we're doing, all of us, to fight these globalists and their scumbag minions who are such a clear and present danger.
[00:41:12.278 --> 00:41:20.663]  And it's about realizing that if we all just lift a finger collectively, these parasites will be off our back.
[00:41:21.527 --> 00:41:22.447]  Like that.
[00:41:22.447 --> 00:41:24.528]  It is our acquiescence.
[00:41:24.528 --> 00:41:26.428]  It is our going along with the system.
[00:41:26.428 --> 00:41:30.008]  It is our passiveness that has allowed this to happen.
[00:41:30.008 --> 00:41:32.529]  So here's what I'm going to do, because I've got such earth-shattering news.
[00:41:32.529 --> 00:41:38.850]  I mean, this is all just totally bombshell and totally positive in many ways.
[00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:41.330]  I'm going to start the next hour and do the Tucker Carlson thing.
[00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.431]  I just did some preludes, but I'm going to laser focus and do this.
[00:41:44.431 --> 00:41:45.711]  I'm going to do it in maybe two segments.
[00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:47.831]  Segment two and segment three.
[00:41:47.831 --> 00:41:50.952]  And then Mark Dice is coming up and Dr. Nick Baggage and a lot more.
[00:41:53.516 --> 00:41:57.819]  I'm at the big world news when we come back.
[00:41:57.819 --> 00:42:10.488]  But just this China thing alone, with what they did arresting the deputy head of one of the most powerful people in China, his daughter, who is a spy chief.
[00:42:10.488 --> 00:42:12.210]  She has three different names.
[00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:15.352]  They've caught the company putting spy chips on all the devices.
[00:42:15.352 --> 00:42:18.854]  The devices are illegal inside U.S.
[00:42:18.854 --> 00:42:19.435]  government buildings.
[00:42:21.513 --> 00:42:23.355]  And they're all asking, oh, why she got arrested?
[00:42:23.355 --> 00:42:27.341]  Well, we know damn well why she did.
[00:42:27.341 --> 00:42:30.264]  They're trying to put up 5G all over the U.S.
[00:42:31.633 --> 00:42:33.954]  That will break into every device in the country.
[00:42:33.954 --> 00:42:36.255]  We're under Chinese Communist attack.
[00:42:36.255 --> 00:42:41.998]  And Trump isn't a traitor, and he just said no to the whole double-cross, and that's why Hillary and all these traitors are crapping their drawers.
[00:42:41.998 --> 00:42:47.221]  Because they're so desperate to get this lion out of here before the world wakes up.
[00:42:47.221 --> 00:42:52.724]  Instead, most conservatives are talking about how the lion, surrounded by 500 hyenas, could do a better job!
[00:42:52.724 --> 00:42:55.706]  I say all of us get in a fight with the lion, because we're lions too!
[00:42:59.195 --> 00:43:05.603]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[00:43:05.603 --> 00:43:07.165]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[00:43:07.165 --> 00:43:12.072]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patreon points.
[00:43:12.072 --> 00:43:14.996]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[00:43:15.536 --> 00:43:18.279]  A free gift with every order.
[00:43:18.279 --> 00:43:27.146]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[00:43:27.146 --> 00:43:30.809]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[00:43:30.809 --> 00:43:36.174]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[00:43:36.174 --> 00:43:38.556]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[00:43:39.096 --> 00:43:43.961]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[00:43:43.961 --> 00:43:45.503]  So this is a loss leader.
[00:43:45.503 --> 00:43:47.085]  We are losing money on this.
[00:43:47.085 --> 00:43:48.506]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:43:48.506 --> 00:43:50.509]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[00:43:50.509 --> 00:43:51.850]  And don't fight the crowds.
[00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:53.272]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:43:53.272 --> 00:43:54.793]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[00:43:59.298 --> 00:44:01.999]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[00:44:01.999 --> 00:44:08.342]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[00:44:08.342 --> 00:44:10.103]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[00:44:10.103 --> 00:44:16.666]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[00:44:16.906 --> 00:44:17.226]  I think so.
[00:44:34.616 --> 00:44:35.096]  I think so.
[00:45:00.177 --> 00:45:06.661]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[00:45:06.661 --> 00:45:13.485]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[00:45:13.485 --> 00:45:29.034]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[00:45:30.174 --> 00:45:34.017]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[00:46:00.494 --> 00:46:08.377]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.
[00:46:08.377 --> 00:46:17.600]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before, as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:25.242]  So get great products and help fund the InfoWars right now with the 12 Days of Christmas that is special amongst a group of incredible sales.
[00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:25.342]  Yes.
[00:46:41.307 --> 00:46:43.469]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:29.293 --> 00:47:30.996]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:30.996 --> 00:47:32.638]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:32.638 --> 00:47:37.224]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:43.871 --> 00:47:52.814]  You know how effective Trump's been by how much they attack him, how much they demonize him, and how much they go after anybody who stands with him.
[00:47:52.814 --> 00:47:54.635]  So, it's not a pain for me.
[00:47:54.635 --> 00:47:57.156]  It's not a sacrifice.
[00:47:57.156 --> 00:48:00.937]  It's a real pleasure to be persecuted right alongside President Trump.
[00:48:02.245 --> 00:48:07.088]  That's the attitude we've all got to have if we're going to defeat this thing for our children.
[00:48:07.088 --> 00:48:09.449]  We want to be in the fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:09.449 --> 00:48:12.411]  If you don't want to be in the fight, you might as well get the hell out of the fight.
[00:48:12.411 --> 00:48:16.613]  And just roll over and let this globalist system totally dominate you.
[00:48:16.613 --> 00:48:19.014]  Okay.
[00:48:19.014 --> 00:48:21.656]  Just so you know what's coming up, and I'm going to start getting into it right now.
[00:48:21.656 --> 00:48:23.497]  I'm going to hit what's really going on with the economy.
[00:48:23.497 --> 00:48:27.399]  I'm going to hit the biggest news, what's happening in China.
[00:48:29.045 --> 00:48:36.691]  And how that ties into Iran and Pakistan and India and Afghanistan.
[00:48:36.691 --> 00:48:41.876]  I'm going to look more at what's happening in Europe in the fall.
[00:48:41.876 --> 00:48:42.956]  The EU, it's coming down.
[00:48:42.956 --> 00:48:50.403]  It turns out one of our listeners got the FOIA request to release more of the MKUltra documents.
[00:48:50.403 --> 00:48:51.403]  So that's in the news today.
[00:48:51.403 --> 00:48:52.945]  I've got some inside baseball for you.
[00:48:54.338 --> 00:48:56.598]  On that, talk about next week's news today.
[00:48:56.598 --> 00:49:00.159]  I'm going to give a little bit of tidbit on what's coming next on that front, and I'm going to stop right there.
[00:49:00.159 --> 00:49:10.541]  And then I'm going to look at the jealousy and hatred of the fake media against the real media.
[00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:15.322]  In this Washington Post sickening article, Drudge takes the Oscar for clueless.
[00:49:15.322 --> 00:49:20.203]  And also, the Clinton Foundation whistleblowers have come forward with hundreds of pages of evidence.
[00:49:21.428 --> 00:49:24.770]  And it is extremely damning of pay-to-play, comingling of funds.
[00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:26.390]  You ask, well, why wasn't anything done?
[00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:36.936]  Because Comey and Mueller and Rosenstein were there, not a switch, but actively involved.
[00:49:36.936 --> 00:49:41.518]  Actively involved in all of this.
[00:49:41.518 --> 00:49:51.043]  So, let's look at national security and how the nation's under attack and how corporate media and the universities openly say that the country existing itself
[00:49:52.941 --> 00:50:01.987]  Is a bad thing, because you're all treated to the governor of New York saying we were never a great nation, we'll never be a great nation.
[00:50:01.987 --> 00:50:07.550]  And you've all been treated to similar statements by Bill Maher.
[00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:10.632]  And you see all the news channels, we did a compilation a few weeks ago.
[00:50:10.632 --> 00:50:15.015]  The last few months, saying, did you hear the word he said?
[00:50:15.015 --> 00:50:18.417]  He said nationalist, how dirty, how evil, just the country existing is bad.
[00:50:19.943 --> 00:50:21.784]  So here comes the private Federal Reserve.
[00:50:21.784 --> 00:50:32.932]  According to estimates from 1913, they admitted in news reports then that about 80% of its stockholders are foreign EU holders today.
[00:50:32.932 --> 00:50:37.755]  It's the same people.
[00:50:37.755 --> 00:50:41.398]  And so the private Federal Reserve raises interest rates seven times on us.
[00:50:41.398 --> 00:50:43.279]  Never did under Obama.
[00:50:43.279 --> 00:50:44.780]  And then the economy starts going down some.
[00:50:45.836 --> 00:50:48.377]  And then, yesterday, they say, you know what?
[00:50:48.377 --> 00:50:50.398]  We may not do rate hikes for the next year.
[00:50:50.398 --> 00:50:56.441]  And the stock market gets back most of its losses for the year, making the year in the black.
[00:50:56.441 --> 00:51:02.363]  Oh, and then, magically, ladies and gentlemen, they come out today and say, oh, we had a good jobs number report come in.
[00:51:02.363 --> 00:51:03.744]  Actually, it wasn't.
[00:51:03.744 --> 00:51:05.545]  It was down from what they thought, about a third.
[00:51:05.545 --> 00:51:07.726]  And so we're going to go ahead and raise interest rates again.
[00:51:07.726 --> 00:51:09.086]  Why not just keep your mouth shut?
[00:51:09.086 --> 00:51:09.606]  No.
[00:51:09.606 --> 00:51:12.968]  They want to manipulate this economy now because they know no president
[00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:24.201]  Going into his re-election bid, other than Franklin Delano Roosevelt, has ever won in a recession or a depression.
[00:51:24.201 --> 00:51:26.962]  Jimmy Carter didn't, did he?
[00:51:26.962 --> 00:51:33.183]  And so they know that, and they've got op-eds out there saying, let's not help the economy.
[00:51:33.183 --> 00:51:37.744]  You've heard Bill Maher and others, let's hurt it so people don't give Trump credit.
[00:51:40.265 --> 00:51:44.289]  Foreign armies couldn't do that to us, but you see, we've got a rigged economy.
[00:51:44.289 --> 00:51:49.473]  The president tried to rig it a little for you, a little for me.
[00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:50.514]  It's command and control.
[00:51:50.514 --> 00:51:54.398]  He said, hey, China, you can get fat off of us, just give us something.
[00:51:54.398 --> 00:51:55.759]  They said, no, you get nothing.
[00:51:55.759 --> 00:51:56.940]  So he said, okay, I'll take it all away.
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.922]  They said, okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, we'll give you a third.
[00:51:59.922 --> 00:52:04.687]  He said, no, I want half, which is fair.
[00:52:04.687 --> 00:52:07.149]  You know, you and your brother go out for pizza.
[00:52:08.732 --> 00:52:14.774]  And you order a large pizza and you're going Dutch, you're going to split the money.
[00:52:14.774 --> 00:52:18.596]  And there's six pieces.
[00:52:18.596 --> 00:52:23.157]  You get three, he gets three.
[00:52:23.157 --> 00:52:28.679]  So, the Dow fell 400 points, breaking decline for the wild week to more than 3%.
[00:52:28.679 --> 00:52:28.759]  CNBC.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.300]  Jobs growth cools in November.
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.981]  Monthly wages gain the most.
[00:52:35.981 --> 00:52:38.222]  But you see that number, it cooled.
[00:52:38.222 --> 00:52:44.263]  But they say, the Federal Reserve came out today and said, oh no.
[00:52:44.263 --> 00:52:47.104]  Oh no.
[00:52:47.104 --> 00:52:48.124]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:52:48.124 --> 00:52:50.645]  This is good numbers, even though it's not.
[00:52:50.645 --> 00:52:57.687]  We're going to keep trying to push America under the water and drown this recovery.
[00:52:57.687 --> 00:52:58.647]  All in your face.
[00:52:59.787 --> 00:53:24.521]  Completely diabolical, because at the same time, China's had 0% interest for decades, 10% growth rates a year, state-run, and our own media is cheerleading that, how dare Trump say we had a month-long moratorium on the trade war, when he knew the Justice Department was about to arrest the number two person at the second largest telecom cell phone company in the world, and then why is he doing this?
[00:53:24.521 --> 00:53:26.782]  This is outrageous police state activity!
[00:53:29.753 --> 00:53:34.596]  You know, they catch a Russian spy stealing some stuff, they give them life in prison.
[00:53:34.596 --> 00:53:38.279]  They catch an Israeli spy like Jonathan Pollard, life in prison, good.
[00:53:38.279 --> 00:53:50.488]  But boy, you're a CHICOM, and your company's been caught from Australia to Japan to South Korea to Vietnam to England.
[00:53:52.776 --> 00:53:57.580]  To the UK wide, no one will take these phones into their country.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:01.464]  You can't sell them because they're government spy devices.
[00:54:01.464 --> 00:54:04.927]  And look, ours have already got the capability and it goes on.
[00:54:04.927 --> 00:54:08.730]  But this is state-run, baby, and it's known and they do it.
[00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:18.178]  They break in to your Wi-Fi system, they scan with a raw feed your passcodes, they have keyloggers, and it's all sent back with your IP address to the motherland.
[00:54:19.093 --> 00:54:22.057]  And the biggest cyber army the world has ever seen.
[00:54:22.057 --> 00:54:32.370]  They've got 10 million people full-time in the cyber army and another 100 million in auxiliary, this is in the news, that are given jobs in mass hack attacks.
[00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:37.596]  And you've got these phones proliferating, already the second biggest phone digital maker in the world.
[00:54:38.729 --> 00:54:43.672]  Apple's now moved there earlier this year, probably last year, in early 2018.
[00:54:43.672 --> 00:54:46.433]  They've given them the iCloud keys.
[00:54:46.433 --> 00:54:56.418]  That's why Tim Cook got so pissed when he knew I was hammering that to the President, because he got specifically asked about that by the President.
[00:54:56.418 --> 00:54:57.538]  Of course, it was in the news.
[00:54:57.538 --> 00:54:59.840]  It was in Bloomberg six months after I told you.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:03.942]  But see, they don't like the fact that so many times, where is it first?
[00:55:03.942 --> 00:55:04.302]  Right here.
[00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:09.351]  So, we'll cover this more next hour.
[00:55:09.351 --> 00:55:09.731]  U.S.
[00:55:09.731 --> 00:55:14.672]  accused of, quote, declaration of war.
[00:55:14.672 --> 00:55:15.532]  That's close quote.
[00:55:15.532 --> 00:55:16.652]  That's the Chinese.
[00:55:16.652 --> 00:55:20.693]  Against China as the stock market teeters on the precipice of disaster.
[00:55:20.693 --> 00:55:22.294]  Michael Stoddard, Economic Collapse blog.
[00:55:22.294 --> 00:55:23.554]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:55:23.554 --> 00:55:24.234]  Here's another one.
[00:55:24.234 --> 00:55:28.775]  Why are countries banning Huawei?
[00:55:28.775 --> 00:55:31.096]  That's Al Jazeera, because it's got spy chips in it.
[00:55:31.096 --> 00:55:31.936]  It's a security risk.
[00:55:33.288 --> 00:55:36.331]  Huawei's 5G ambitions suffer another big setback.
[00:55:36.331 --> 00:55:38.392]  They're going to be the biggest network in the U.S.
[00:55:38.392 --> 00:55:41.895]  Chinese government, run!
[00:55:41.895 --> 00:55:53.404]  Every American firm doing business in China now vulnerable after Huawei's number two arrested.
[00:55:53.404 --> 00:55:55.666]  China likened CFO arrest to declaration of war.
[00:55:55.666 --> 00:55:58.168]  Ben Warren, Infowars.com.
[00:55:58.168 --> 00:56:01.751]  Huawei's exec's arrest opens a new front in the U.S.-China trade war.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.021]  What have we been begging Trump to do?
[00:56:05.021 --> 00:56:06.521]  Go after the Chinese Commie agents?
[00:56:06.521 --> 00:56:08.862]  Well, why play games?
[00:56:08.862 --> 00:56:15.485]  Why not grab the Chief Operating Officer, number two of their daddy, who's in the top three or four of the Commie's party?
[00:56:15.485 --> 00:56:19.127]  Some say he may be more powerful than Xi.
[00:56:19.127 --> 00:56:20.948]  Well, we just grabbed his daughter!
[00:56:20.948 --> 00:56:21.448]  Good!
[00:56:21.448 --> 00:56:24.249]  You're shooting your mouth off about nuclear war this week?
[00:56:24.249 --> 00:56:29.091]  How you'll nuke us over the weekend while Trump was down there with you?
[00:56:29.091 --> 00:56:30.432]  And now your daughter's been grabbed!
[00:56:31.598 --> 00:56:33.299]  You want us to do what we did like we did in Japan?
[00:56:33.299 --> 00:56:34.760]  We'll do it to you, buddy.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:39.563]  Keep running your stupid mouth, you scumbag murderers.
[00:56:39.563 --> 00:56:41.024]  Keep feeding off your own people.
[00:56:41.024 --> 00:56:43.945]  Keep writing checks your ass can't cash.
[00:56:43.945 --> 00:56:48.068]  And I want to say that to all the cronies of the Democratic Party, all you traitors, all you scumbags.
[00:56:48.068 --> 00:56:50.329]  We have a very good chance of getting the country back.
[00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:57.073]  And I will assure you, not out of some vengeful thing, but out of necessity for our children, you're all going to get your asses prosecuted.
[00:56:57.073 --> 00:56:58.754]  I'd give it about 90% chance we win.
[00:57:00.035 --> 00:57:04.140]  May mean a nuclear war down the road, but we'll win in the end.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:07.404]  Now, doesn't mean I don't have much chance of making it, but that's okay.
[00:57:07.404 --> 00:57:09.086]  See, that's the commitment we gotta have here.
[00:57:09.086 --> 00:57:11.689]  You're done, Dianne Feinstein.
[00:57:11.689 --> 00:57:13.772]  All of you traders are done.
[00:57:13.772 --> 00:57:15.113]  D-O-N-E.
[00:57:15.113 --> 00:57:16.235]  Done.
[00:57:16.235 --> 00:57:17.857]  Your new old order is dead on arrival.

[00:59:53.274 --> 00:59:55.881]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:11.468 --> 01:00:16.311]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:18.012]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:18.012 --> 01:00:19.653]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:19.653 --> 01:00:25.397]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.397 --> 01:00:38.465]  Ladies and gentlemen, next segment, I'm getting into how Trump has delivered in royal flush spades.
[01:00:39.696 --> 01:00:42.839]  On the key priorities to save this country.
[01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:48.483]  He's had goals that are psychological for the public to reclaim their identity.
[01:00:48.483 --> 01:00:57.370]  He's had physical and financial goals for the strategic defense and offensive operations of this country.
[01:00:57.370 --> 01:01:01.414]  And he's getting very good advice on many fronts.
[01:01:02.452 --> 01:01:09.237]  He's having trouble getting his domestic agenda implemented because of cowardice and idiocy and people being a bunch of scum and losers.
[01:01:09.237 --> 01:01:12.099]  We're going to talk about the next segment, but it doesn't matter.
[01:01:12.099 --> 01:01:17.764]  What he's promoting in the iconography is total victory.
[01:01:17.764 --> 01:01:20.186]  And that is the rest of the story.
[01:01:20.186 --> 01:01:21.747]  That's coming up next segment.
[01:01:21.747 --> 01:01:22.968]  We'll open the phones up after that.
[01:01:22.968 --> 01:01:27.992]  Mark Dice is going to be popping in.
[01:01:27.992 --> 01:01:31.915]  This China situation is so big
[01:01:33.365 --> 01:01:43.850]  And so dangerous, and so incredible, that I really am having trouble coming up with words to describe it.
[01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:51.214]  I mean, if you look at the job the globalists did on us, selling the country out, to mainly the Chaikovs.
[01:01:51.214 --> 01:01:58.797]  They were the ones that were meant to break us in the end, and to take over Japan, and the Koreas, and Vietnam, and everything.
[01:01:58.797 --> 01:02:00.438]  But, they're running into a brick wall.
[01:02:03.134 --> 01:02:11.623]  And there were traders in our government, obviously the Clintons, chief amongst them the Bushes, a close second, who helped set this up.
[01:02:15.296 --> 01:02:20.002]  And now you read the Pentagon and you read the War College, this has nothing to do with Russia.
[01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:23.326]  Everyone knows they've cut their defense spending, they're in a defensive situation.
[01:02:23.326 --> 01:02:26.390]  There are certain elements trying to start a war from them, with them.
[01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:29.654]  A regional conflict to draw us off of China.
[01:02:29.654 --> 01:02:33.179]  And China's funding Iran, and Pakistan and others trying to do that.
[01:02:34.377 --> 01:02:36.618]  That's why we've got to move very, very quickly.
[01:02:36.618 --> 01:02:44.662]  But make no mistake, what Trump's doing is in the interest of humanity, the interest of America, and the interest of the poor people living in China and others.
[01:02:44.662 --> 01:02:54.186]  And everybody should be praying for President Trump instead of getting on the bandwagon to bash him and put him down and separate themselves from him because he's the man in the arena.
[01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:11.034]  China has ignored Trump's tweet on Iran, says business there will continue, even though they're in agreement with us that if we put sanctions in, they'll be part of it.
[01:03:11.034 --> 01:03:18.696]  So this is all heating up, and reportedly the head of this big telecom got arrested for deals in Iran, that they violated U.S.
[01:03:18.696 --> 01:03:21.517]  trade laws by using money out of the U.S.
[01:03:21.517 --> 01:03:23.918]  to go there.
[01:03:23.918 --> 01:03:26.559]  It's all just a message that the Chinese will grab you.
[01:03:32.079 --> 01:03:34.760]  And the Chinese are already shooting at our ships.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.560]  They're already running their mouths.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.681]  They're going to end up just like Hitler and just like the Japanese, you watch.
[01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:48.802]  If they want that, if they think that there were just traitors in our government, there weren't.
[01:03:48.802 --> 01:03:56.084]  There were traitors, but they were allowed to operate by other people so that we'd know exactly who all the traitors were when this went down.
[01:03:56.084 --> 01:04:00.805]  You think we're going to leave a bunch of traitors in the government when we literally garrot you commies?
[01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.851]  So you're about to get it, China.
[01:04:04.851 --> 01:04:07.113]  Everybody better decide which side they're on right now.
[01:04:07.113 --> 01:04:09.374]  That's why all these globalists are so scared of Trump.
[01:04:09.374 --> 01:04:14.076]  Probably have London Guardian reports saying if the world gets destroyed, blame Alex Jones.
[01:04:14.076 --> 01:04:14.957]  He got Trump elected.
[01:04:14.957 --> 01:04:16.258]  No, this audience did.
[01:04:16.258 --> 01:04:16.798]  And you know what?
[01:04:16.798 --> 01:04:18.779]  Trump's for real.
[01:04:18.779 --> 01:04:22.321]  So all you wimps, who wanted to run the white flag up to the chi-coms,
[01:04:23.547 --> 01:04:25.328]  And piss all over yourselves.
[01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:29.091]  We gave China and all these other groups a lot of chances.
[01:04:29.091 --> 01:04:33.955]  We gave the Clintons chances, and we gave the Democrats chances, and all the traders chances.
[01:04:33.955 --> 01:04:34.996]  Chances are over.
[01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:41.000]  And it doesn't matter what you do to Imphal Wars, it's going to go forward.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.143]  It's over.
[01:04:44.143 --> 01:04:46.084]  It's over.
[01:04:46.084 --> 01:04:49.006]  All Chinese agents are about to get arrested.
[01:04:49.006 --> 01:04:49.627]  Every one of you.
[01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:54.584]  Reportedly, that woman was carrying a database of their operatives.
[01:04:54.584 --> 01:04:55.485]  We already have the database.
[01:04:55.485 --> 01:04:58.107]  We want to have it from her.
[01:04:58.107 --> 01:05:05.833]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:05:05.833 --> 01:05:06.314]  It's you.
[01:05:07.406 --> 01:05:09.909]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:05:09.909 --> 01:05:11.230]  You are the InfoWar.
[01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:14.194]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:39.938]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:05:39.938 --> 01:05:47.923]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:05:47.923 --> 01:05:54.968]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:05:54.968 --> 01:05:57.710]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:06:01.087 --> 01:06:03.752]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:03.752 --> 01:06:08.900]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:13.797 --> 01:06:18.301]  Tonight, an unprecedented arrest escalating Trump's trade war to a whole new level.
[01:06:18.301 --> 01:06:22.264]  One of China's most important business leaders arrested in Canada.
[01:06:22.264 --> 01:06:27.328]  She is the CFO of tech giant Huawei, one of China's marquee companies.
[01:06:27.328 --> 01:06:29.110]  Huawei makes more cell phones than Apple.
[01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.332]  Revenues this year are set to top Boeing's.
[01:06:31.932 --> 01:06:41.780]  A source telling CNN the view among some officials is she could be used as leverage with China in trade talks and of course the expectation is she'll be extradited to the United States.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:46.603]  Out front now, Peter Navarro, assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy.
[01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:49.446]  Okay Peter, this threw everything into disarray today.
[01:06:49.446 --> 01:06:51.147]  It shocked everybody.
[01:06:51.147 --> 01:06:52.328]  What is going on here?
[01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:54.151]  It's pretty simple.
[01:06:54.151 --> 01:06:55.812]  The two issues are totally separate.
[01:06:55.812 --> 01:07:00.535]  The trade negotiations and this arrest.
[01:07:00.535 --> 01:07:05.860]  The Justice Department acts on an independent track.
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:11.124]  The coincidence of the arrest happening in the same time frame was just that.
[01:07:11.964 --> 01:07:30.313]  And what we need to do on the negotiation side is just proceed from the dinner that we had in Argentina over the next 90 days to see if China can come to an accommodation with the bad behavior they engage in across a wide range of things.
[01:07:30.313 --> 01:07:35.375]  And meanwhile, the Justice Department will do what it needs to do.
[01:07:35.375 --> 01:07:37.376]  But can I just ask you a question on this?
[01:07:38.957 --> 01:07:43.662]  If that's really what happened, the Justice Department did it, are you saying they didn't tell the President he had no idea?
[01:07:45.462 --> 01:07:51.205]  Yes, Aaron, I was at the dinner with President Xi and President Trump.
[01:07:51.205 --> 01:07:54.007]  This was an amazing thing, two presidents there.
[01:07:54.007 --> 01:08:00.550]  I was also an active participant in several meetings we had with the President leading up to that dinner.
[01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:09.554]  We had discussions with the team, Steve Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, John Bolton, Secretary Pompeo, of course Ambassador Lighthizer.
[01:08:09.554 --> 01:08:10.775]  This issue never came up.
[01:08:10.775 --> 01:08:11.995]  The President was unaware of it.
[01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:17.019]  Going into that dinner, as we're all members of the team.
[01:08:17.019 --> 01:08:27.686]  And look, I think what's interesting to observe here is that the fact of the matter is, the reason why we're having such trouble with China is they do stuff like this all the time.
[01:08:27.686 --> 01:08:30.608]  They lie, they cheat, they steal, they force technology transfer.
[01:08:30.608 --> 01:08:36.652]  So on any given day, there have been actions taken against China over the course of this administration.
[01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:42.418]  But let me just ask you, because... Okay, then she goes on to basically criticize the president inside of the Chai Coms as a traitor would.
[01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:44.420]  Well, let's explain.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:44.961]  There were...
[01:08:46.477 --> 01:08:53.739]  500 million plus people there when the leftist arm of the CIA in 1949 put Mao Zedong into power.
[01:08:53.739 --> 01:08:54.759]  This is all declassified now.
[01:08:54.759 --> 01:08:58.320]  I remember reading about it from the John Birch Society saying this in the 60s.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.861]  But now it's all declassified.
[01:08:59.861 --> 01:09:08.483]  The John Birch Society got founded because they were aware of all this going on from John Birch who was an army officer who got tortured to death over there because he wouldn't go along with it.
[01:09:08.483 --> 01:09:14.225]  And so they used China as this base to commit criminal activity to move US jobs overseas
[01:09:16.243 --> 01:09:23.427]  And then work with the Chinese Communist Party that basically the Carnegie Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and others set up.
[01:09:23.427 --> 01:09:26.969]  And David Rockefeller wrote New York Times op-eds admitting all this.
[01:09:26.969 --> 01:09:28.530]  He wrote books admitting it.
[01:09:28.530 --> 01:09:33.353]  You can just type in David Rockefeller praises Mao Zedong.
[01:09:33.353 --> 01:09:36.655]  And then click images on Google and you'll get the New York Times articles.
[01:09:36.655 --> 01:09:39.197]  So, what I'm telling you is a fact.
[01:09:40.666 --> 01:09:45.570]  And now, again, 50 years ago, 99% of the country didn't have running water and toilets.
[01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:50.553]  Now they've got more cities, more systems than we do.
[01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:56.598]  Because the power was all transferred to them.
[01:09:56.598 --> 01:09:58.659]  Not the people of China, but the authoritarians.
[01:09:58.659 --> 01:10:06.485]  And now, you've got the second biggest cell phone telecom in the world, who plan to put in a nationwide 5G program.
[01:10:06.485 --> 01:10:07.866]  Obama was bringing it in with him.
[01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.829]  They're going to use U.S.
[01:10:09.829 --> 01:10:11.170]  taxpayer money to pay for part of it.
[01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:12.851]  Trump just killed it.
[01:10:12.851 --> 01:10:16.292]  And you've got Huawei, the second biggest cell phone company in the world.
[01:10:16.292 --> 01:10:18.754]  Apple's the third largest.
[01:10:18.754 --> 01:10:23.156]  And they've moved to China and become state-run.
[01:10:23.156 --> 01:10:29.879]  And so now they are coming out and saying, this is an act of war.
[01:10:29.879 --> 01:10:31.219]  We'll come after you.
[01:10:31.219 --> 01:10:32.300]  We'll do all this to you.
[01:10:36.667 --> 01:10:41.574]  If you don't stop what you're doing, and the media is spinning it, oh, they busted her because she was using U.S.
[01:10:41.574 --> 01:10:43.716]  money, violating U.S.
[01:10:43.716 --> 01:10:53.048]  law that she's agreed to, to give money to Iran to get around the sanctions.
[01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:53.890]  And that is part of it.
[01:10:57.912 --> 01:10:59.532]  Got her on that front.
[01:10:59.532 --> 01:11:03.713]  She's the number two person, largest, most successful company in China.
[01:11:03.713 --> 01:11:07.514]  This is China's biggest, most successful state-controlled company.
[01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:10.655]  Her father is in the top three or four people in the Communist Party.
[01:11:10.655 --> 01:11:15.717]  Some say he's more powerful than the dictator that Trump just met with.
[01:11:15.717 --> 01:11:18.297]  And so, yeah, it's more than a shot across the bow.
[01:11:18.297 --> 01:11:21.158]  It's like, you keep having your ships in the South China Sea,
[01:11:22.619 --> 01:11:25.580]  In waters that have never been disputed in the last five years.
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.061]  Shooting at our ships.
[01:11:27.061 --> 01:11:29.882]  You've got drones crashing into our ships.
[01:11:29.882 --> 01:11:31.342]  You're disappearing people.
[01:11:31.342 --> 01:11:33.143]  You're attacking U.S.
[01:11:33.143 --> 01:11:35.744]  embassies with microwave guns.
[01:11:35.744 --> 01:11:38.345]  You've been killing our assets in your country.
[01:11:38.345 --> 01:11:40.005]  We haven't been killing yours.
[01:11:40.005 --> 01:11:42.186]  And so now the gloves are off.
[01:11:42.186 --> 01:11:45.847]  Trump's not gonna sit there and kill low-level people.
[01:11:45.847 --> 01:11:48.648]  He's not gonna arrest low-level people.
[01:11:48.648 --> 01:11:50.409]  He's telling China, we just grabbed
[01:11:51.328 --> 01:12:11.035]  Your corrupt daughter who heads up your biggest company and we've got her computers and we're downloading everything off of them because I guarantee you they've been so arrogant thinking this country is a bunch of wimps that she's got all the material on her computer.
[01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:13.296]  Believe me, they wouldn't have grabbed her if they didn't already know it.
[01:12:14.548 --> 01:12:16.029]  They already scanned her computer remotely.
[01:12:16.029 --> 01:12:17.909]  They already knew full well what she had.
[01:12:17.909 --> 01:12:19.370]  They want the custody of it.
[01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:20.950]  They want the proof.
[01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:23.971]  Because let me tell you what she's got.
[01:12:23.971 --> 01:12:29.794]  She's got the Office of Personnel Management hack that Obama gave her.
[01:12:29.794 --> 01:12:31.674]  And she's got everything else in there.
[01:12:31.674 --> 01:12:33.335]  She's got all those different codes.
[01:12:34.656 --> 01:12:40.398]  And she's over there with her other executives because they're not transferring that stuff over the internet.
[01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:43.279]  They are delivering it computer to computer.
[01:12:43.279 --> 01:12:48.101]  And she's there setting up their military operations against America.
[01:12:48.101 --> 01:12:53.222]  And their modern military operations are digital and they're financial.
[01:12:53.222 --> 01:12:59.625]  And they've got the chief of staff for Dianne Feinstein being a communist Chinese agent.
[01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:03.306]  And half the other Democrats, you'll notice, will have a former Chinese nationalist
[01:13:04.465 --> 01:13:09.287]  With intelligence ties as either their chief driver, assistant, or even chief of staff.
[01:13:09.287 --> 01:13:16.129]  Because that, the Chinese say, we own you, we will be in the Senate computers, you get our money through U.S.
[01:13:16.129 --> 01:13:22.531]  front companies, you and your husband, she's gotten over a billion from China, her husband has, on record.
[01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:23.351]  Over a billion of U.S.
[01:13:23.351 --> 01:13:25.732]  taxpayer money as well on biotech her husband's gotten.
[01:13:25.732 --> 01:13:27.473]  She is a monster.
[01:13:27.473 --> 01:13:28.393]  Total enemy of this country.
[01:13:31.147 --> 01:13:33.369]  Under the Clintons and everybody, this just became normal.
[01:13:33.369 --> 01:13:35.010]  Clinton would have Chinese generals.
[01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:37.152]  Bill Clinton, you can pull this up on C-SPAN.
[01:13:37.152 --> 01:13:44.658]  Type in, uh, C-SPAN, uh, Chinese, uh, generals visit the White House.
[01:13:44.658 --> 01:13:47.500]  And they're in there with bags of briefcases.
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.982]  Each one had to carry a big double briefcase.
[01:13:49.982 --> 01:13:53.085]  You know, the big ones.
[01:13:53.085 --> 01:13:54.746]  In with $100 bills from Bill Clinton.
[01:13:57.196 --> 01:13:59.097]  He's like, this is absolutely fantastic.
[01:13:59.097 --> 01:14:07.361]  You want to have the separation system to get an ICBM into orbit properly and you want the MRF re-entry device technology.
[01:14:07.361 --> 01:14:08.282]  And let me get that straight again.
[01:14:08.282 --> 01:14:14.405]  You want from Laura Allen Hughes, you want the re-entry guidance systems.
[01:14:14.405 --> 01:14:19.787]  Listen, I can't give you past the 1980s, but how about I give you the MX missile plans?
[01:14:19.787 --> 01:14:20.588]  That sound good for you?
[01:14:22.283 --> 01:14:25.184]  Oh, you only want five million?
[01:14:25.184 --> 01:14:26.145]  Of course I'm a traitor.
[01:14:26.145 --> 01:14:27.125]  I hate this country.
[01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:27.686]  I was green.
[01:14:27.686 --> 01:14:29.246]  Oh, listen, we helped set you guys up.
[01:14:29.246 --> 01:14:30.647]  We're giving everything to you.
[01:14:30.647 --> 01:14:31.827]  You think you're buying me off?
[01:14:31.827 --> 01:14:33.228]  It's part of the plan, brother.
[01:14:33.228 --> 01:14:36.569]  I'm going to be retiring over there.
[01:14:36.569 --> 01:14:39.331]  These are conversations in the room on record.
[01:14:39.331 --> 01:14:49.375]  They're like, oh, they cannot believe that they were actually given all the power and given all the industry and given all the jobs.
[01:14:49.375 --> 01:14:51.216]  But David Rockefeller and others set the deal up
[01:14:52.483 --> 01:15:00.450]  For the one-child policy, all of it, all China had to do was sell out America and sell out their own people and they would be given all the power and they have been.
[01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:09.217]  And now, think about it, Trump is coming in and just absolutely rolling it all up and that's why the Democrats are so scared.
[01:15:09.217 --> 01:15:11.019]  That's why they're all freaking out.
[01:15:11.019 --> 01:15:12.941]  That's why they don't know what to do.
[01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:15.042]  That's why they're crapping their britches.
[01:15:15.042 --> 01:15:19.086]  That's why it's getting so serious because they have committed such crimes.
[01:15:21.138 --> 01:15:21.879]  So they're all scared.
[01:15:21.879 --> 01:15:22.499]  Trump's coming in.
[01:15:22.499 --> 01:15:23.840]  He knows China.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.802]  It's totally, you know, taking us over.
[01:15:25.802 --> 01:15:26.323]  What do we do?
[01:15:26.323 --> 01:15:27.243]  Well, we're foreign traders.
[01:15:27.243 --> 01:15:27.744]  We're globals.
[01:15:27.744 --> 01:15:29.666]  We hate America.
[01:15:29.666 --> 01:15:33.369]  Let's just say he's a Russian agent.
[01:15:33.369 --> 01:15:34.230]  The public will buy that?
[01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:34.670]  Won't matter.
[01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:38.674]  We'll just say that over and over again.
[01:15:38.674 --> 01:15:40.615]  And that's now what's really happening.
[01:15:40.615 --> 01:15:43.318]  Okay, I said I'd give it to Tucker Carlson, because he's come out.
[01:15:44.844 --> 01:15:47.570]  And he's taking Trump to the woodshed here.
[01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:50.457]  He said Trump hasn't kept any of his promises.
[01:15:50.457 --> 01:15:55.067]  I don't know what planet Tucker's living on, but about to take him to the woodshed.
[01:15:57.771 --> 01:15:58.972]  Hear that?
[01:15:58.972 --> 01:16:04.356]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:04.356 --> 01:16:07.258]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.258 --> 01:16:10.840]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:16:23.029 --> 01:16:25.451]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[01:16:27.395 --> 01:16:33.736]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.736 --> 01:16:36.777]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.777 --> 01:16:42.698]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:46.479]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.479 --> 01:16:47.759]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.759 --> 01:16:49.099]  Who do we fight for?

[01:16:55.301 --> 01:16:56.741]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.481 --> 01:17:02.265]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:17:02.265 --> 01:17:08.149]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:14.653]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.

[01:17:33.987 --> 01:17:36.809]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[01:20:01.303 --> 01:20:10.050]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:13.993]  I won't be there anymore.
[01:20:13.993 --> 01:20:16.194]  Get out of my way.
[01:20:16.194 --> 01:20:18.176]  Let me by.
[01:20:18.176 --> 01:20:22.259]  I got better things to do with my time.
[01:20:22.259 --> 01:20:25.021]  I don't care anymore.
[01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:26.302]  I don't care anymore.
[01:20:26.302 --> 01:20:28.083]  I don't care anymore.
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:51.911]  So, it's been argued that things like the Vatican, things like Israel, get set up by religions or organizations or groups so that people can commit crimes in one country or one area and then run back to those areas.
[01:20:51.911 --> 01:21:00.857]  Well, with the case of Communist China, corrupt globalists in our country, the Rockefellers and others on record, helped set up modern Communist China, put Mao into power,
[01:21:03.217 --> 01:21:19.069]  So that they could have a place with no human rights, no industrial cleanliness, no regulations, to go in and take a group of smart, hardworking people, industrialize them, and then use them to take over the planet.
[01:21:19.069 --> 01:21:21.130]  And that's now been done.
[01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:23.973]  And it's been done by selling out our nation.
[01:21:23.973 --> 01:21:26.614]  And I've just spent most of the show on this because it's such a big deal.
[01:21:27.438 --> 01:21:43.266]  That Trump has arrested the number two executive at China's biggest company, this telecom giant with 5G, second biggest smartphone maker, who's been banned from Australia to India, from Japan to the United States on U.S.
[01:21:43.266 --> 01:21:45.968]  military bases, but many countries ban it, period!
[01:21:48.243 --> 01:21:50.664]  Because they've been caught putting spy chips on them.
[01:21:50.664 --> 01:21:53.386]  Remember the big Bloomberg investigative report a couple months ago?
[01:21:53.386 --> 01:21:56.808]  You heard about it years ago, but we're next year's news today.
[01:21:56.808 --> 01:22:06.774]  Little chips, then grab your wireless code, everything, and then back channel, dial in like a modem, back to Chai Com headquarters with all your personal data.
[01:22:06.774 --> 01:22:07.975]  But here's the big issue.
[01:22:07.975 --> 01:22:08.495]  I haven't hit yet.
[01:22:11.067 --> 01:22:24.438]  If Apple moved there earlier this year to be tax-exempt and gave their Apple code keys to the government and admitted, well, that's part of being state-run here to be tax-exempt, then they're a bigger threat than Huawei.
[01:22:24.438 --> 01:22:31.383]  And that's what scared Tim Cook so much four months ago when he called for me to be banned and all the other CEOs got in line.
[01:22:31.383 --> 01:22:40.110]  But see, Tim, we're still on hundreds of AM and FM stations and hundreds of TV stations and still have InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, but something even more important
[01:22:41.357 --> 01:22:50.659]  We have this great audience of men and women and young people, black, white, old, young, Asian, Christian, Falun Gong, Buddhists that are upset.
[01:22:50.659 --> 01:22:53.700]  They're huge supporters because they've been in prison and killed.
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:54.740]  Their families have.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:58.461]  Supporting Infowars by something called people power.
[01:22:58.461 --> 01:23:01.042]  Word of mouth.
[01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:02.122]  And they're taking action.
[01:23:02.122 --> 01:23:08.183]  So I wanted to just recap that because this is so epic and China's calling it an act of war and there could be huge repercussions.
[01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:10.684]  But at some point, we've got to stop letting them push.
[01:23:13.112 --> 01:23:15.615]  And push.
[01:23:15.615 --> 01:23:16.095]  And push.
[01:23:16.095 --> 01:23:21.100]  And push.
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:21.440]  And push.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.221]  That's what's happening now.
[01:23:22.221 --> 01:23:24.904]  It's called pushback.
[01:23:24.904 --> 01:23:26.265]  And I wanted to hit that first.
[01:23:26.265 --> 01:23:28.648]  It's one of Trump's biggest accomplishments.
[01:23:28.648 --> 01:23:34.373]  He said, I'll stand up to China doing one-sided trade deals where they have multi-hundred percent tariffs on us.
[01:23:35.339 --> 01:23:37.260]  And we have no tariff on them.
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:40.722]  They do it through taxes, they do it through currency, they do it through actual tariffs.
[01:23:40.722 --> 01:23:42.263]  He said, you know, Canada?
[01:23:42.263 --> 01:23:46.505]  It's got a 280% tariff on dairy, just to name one of many.
[01:23:46.505 --> 01:23:48.786]  We'll just do that to them.
[01:23:48.786 --> 01:23:51.967]  And Trump did it!
[01:23:51.967 --> 01:23:57.050]  And suddenly thousands of factories came back, because now we were open for business again.
[01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:59.591]  So the private Federal Reserve came in and tried to block all that.
[01:23:59.591 --> 01:24:02.453]  And then in comes Tucker Carlson, one of the smartest people out there.
[01:24:02.453 --> 01:24:04.554]  Definitely the smartest on cable news.
[01:24:05.762 --> 01:24:13.207]  And he does this big interview with the German newspaper Die Weltwoche, if I'm saying it right.
[01:24:13.207 --> 01:24:16.890]  Tucker, Trump hasn't kept any of his chief promises.
[01:24:16.890 --> 01:24:20.092]  This horrendous system wasn't created overnight and it can't be fixed overnight.
[01:24:20.092 --> 01:24:30.160]  So I think what he's saying is, in a backhanded support, as I read that article, you're not going to be able to defeat this overnight.
[01:24:31.311 --> 01:24:32.712]  But Trump's from the outsides.
[01:24:32.712 --> 01:24:34.193]  He doesn't even know how to deal with it.
[01:24:34.193 --> 01:24:35.054]  That's actually a good thing.
[01:24:35.054 --> 01:24:40.779]  But where Tucker's really wrong is he says Trump hasn't gotten anything done.
[01:24:40.779 --> 01:24:41.920]  He said he would.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:49.406]  And he lists defund Planned Parenthood, repeal Obamacare, and build a wall.
[01:24:49.406 --> 01:24:53.650]  Now those are things that Trump said that he would support.
[01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:55.091]  But the Republicans are wimps.
[01:24:55.091 --> 01:24:55.912]  They're sold out.
[01:24:55.912 --> 01:24:56.493]  They're cowards.
[01:24:57.389 --> 01:25:00.131]  So a bunch of them, 40 plus have stepped down.
[01:25:00.131 --> 01:25:02.172]  We're getting some Freedom Caucus folks in.
[01:25:02.172 --> 01:25:06.154]  They get attacked with guns and people try to kill them.
[01:25:06.154 --> 01:25:08.096]  But we're moving forward!
[01:25:08.096 --> 01:25:13.539]  But I get trying to put heat on the President to do more, but the President's already done so much.
[01:25:13.539 --> 01:25:16.261]  But let's talk about what the President's actually done.
[01:25:16.261 --> 01:25:22.404]  Where he has the executive power to do it, he said he'd pull out of the TPP that was written to totally sell out the U.S.
[01:25:22.404 --> 01:25:23.665]  and transfer our power.
[01:25:23.665 --> 01:25:24.586]  He did it.
[01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:26.107]  He said he would appoint conservative
[01:25:27.099 --> 01:25:35.102]  Judges, the Supreme Court, wow, two of them in the first two years and fought like hell to do it.
[01:25:35.102 --> 01:25:49.288]  He also made populism and nationalism good again and gave us faith in ourselves or at least said it was okay to like America and to love the flag and to believe in what our country stood for.
[01:25:49.288 --> 01:25:55.991]  And then he got trillions in the stock market and over a trillion dollars in new jobs and the fastest growing
[01:25:58.587 --> 01:26:05.313]  Blue collar and middle class paychecks.
[01:26:05.313 --> 01:26:09.517]  You know, there's an article by Washington Examiner, that's one of the shorter lists.
[01:26:09.517 --> 01:26:12.519]  It's only, let me read the headline here.
[01:26:12.519 --> 01:26:17.264]  It's only 289 accomplishments.
[01:26:17.264 --> 01:26:23.509]  Because when I'm reading this, which I've read the whole thing again today, it gives me a headache because my brain starts working overtime.
[01:26:23.509 --> 01:26:24.350]  It's way more than this.
[01:26:26.957 --> 01:26:38.261]  But you go through it, everything he had executive power over, he's done or tried to do, and then his own people brag, oh well we just ignore it when he says he's going to sign an executive order, we just throw it away.
[01:26:38.261 --> 01:26:42.683]  He's talking about treason.
[01:26:42.683 --> 01:26:45.204]  So economic growth, never said it would hit 3%, went way above 4.2.
[01:26:45.204 --> 01:26:48.425]  Federal Reserve came in to block it.
[01:26:48.425 --> 01:26:49.686]  And there's a huge list of those.
[01:26:51.328 --> 01:26:53.049]  VA waits got cut.
[01:26:53.049 --> 01:26:54.490]  Veteran unemployment got cut.
[01:26:54.490 --> 01:26:55.490]  Black unemployment lowest level.
[01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:56.711]  It just goes on and on.
[01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:58.072]  American optimism went way up.
[01:26:58.072 --> 01:26:59.933]  American income went way up.
[01:26:59.933 --> 01:27:02.034]  Deregulation, written by globalists.
[01:27:02.034 --> 01:27:03.995]  UN regulations all got cut.
[01:27:03.995 --> 01:27:06.156]  Small businesses, record growth.
[01:27:06.156 --> 01:27:06.797]  Tax cuts.
[01:27:07.597 --> 01:27:08.617]  For the poor and middle class.
[01:27:08.617 --> 01:27:10.978]  Let me tell you, they see me as wealthy, my taxes went up.
[01:27:10.978 --> 01:27:11.978]  I didn't mention about it.
[01:27:11.978 --> 01:27:16.860]  He got rid of the property tax write-off because the blue states all do that as a scam to not pay taxes.
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:18.060]  Trump blew it all away.
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:19.340]  That's why.
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:23.361]  He actually, like JFK, he raised taxes on rich people, cut it on poor people.
[01:27:23.361 --> 01:27:28.443]  So we're really dealing here with a JFK type.
[01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:32.804]  All these different worker development programs, all the giant infrastructure preparement, healthcare.
[01:27:32.804 --> 01:27:35.205]  He can't get rid of all of Obamacare, but he got rid of the mandate.
[01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:38.694]  Domestic infrastructure, 1.5 trillion.
[01:27:38.694 --> 01:27:40.657]  Combating opioids.
[01:27:40.657 --> 01:27:45.805]  Telling China, you execute people shipping opioids into your country, how about you execute yourself shipping in here?
[01:27:45.805 --> 01:27:47.868]  They're the biggest importer as a weapon.
[01:27:47.868 --> 01:27:49.049]  Law and order!
[01:27:49.049 --> 01:27:49.831]  All the things he's done there.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:56.243]  And he said decriminalize medical marijuana, which he said he would do.
[01:27:56.243 --> 01:27:58.365]  Border security, they'll never pass it.
[01:27:58.365 --> 01:27:59.726]  Republicans won't, Democrats won't.
[01:27:59.726 --> 01:28:06.051]  So he put the military down there, and it's the lowest level of illegal aliens in the last 30 years in the United States, in latest numbers.
[01:28:08.877 --> 01:28:11.558]  On trade, again, he's standing up for us getting better deals.
[01:28:11.558 --> 01:28:12.158]  Who can deny that?
[01:28:12.158 --> 01:28:14.818]  That's why the globalists are all pissed off.
[01:28:14.818 --> 01:28:19.520]  Oh, energy, turning the coal back on, which drives down our power prices.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:23.320]  Foreign policy, bringing back sovereignty to the U.S., doing what he said he'd do, moving the U.S.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.861]  Embassy to Jerusalem.
[01:28:24.861 --> 01:28:26.461]  Veterans Affairs, it goes on and on.
[01:28:26.461 --> 01:28:28.922]  So the idea, we're going to come back and talk about this, because I see Scott.
[01:28:29.702 --> 01:28:32.083]  Scott Bronson, let's show a shot of him for TV viewers.
[01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:34.343]  Scott Bronson, one of our Affiliate Relations guys, just popped up.
[01:28:34.343 --> 01:28:35.584]  He wants to talk.
[01:28:35.584 --> 01:28:37.124]  Can we cut to him for a minute?
[01:28:37.124 --> 01:28:38.805]  Scott Bronson wants to say something about this.
[01:28:38.805 --> 01:28:42.306]  I'm not sure what he wants to say, but this has got him hot under the collar.
[01:28:42.306 --> 01:28:43.886]  He's gonna pop in on this on the other side.
[01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:46.427]  So, is Tucker Carlson right?
[01:28:46.427 --> 01:28:54.149]  Well, we'll look at what Tucker Carlson said, and then we'll look at what's actually going on here in a moment and ask, why did Tucker not give in to BS say these things?
[01:28:58.812 --> 01:29:01.994]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[01:29:01.994 --> 01:29:06.217]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[01:29:06.217 --> 01:29:07.618]  The bug assault.
[01:29:07.618 --> 01:29:12.322]  A miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[01:29:13.277 --> 01:29:15.679]  Non-toxic and no batteries required.

[01:31:58.286 --> 01:32:06.697]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:32:06.697 --> 01:32:08.159]  Believe me, I know.
[01:32:08.159 --> 01:32:12.865]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:32:12.865 --> 01:32:15.929]  But thanks to Super Male Vitality at Infowarestore.com.
[01:32:16.409 --> 01:32:18.090]  I still have that energy.
[01:32:18.090 --> 01:32:38.246]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[01:33:01.290 --> 01:33:03.951]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.836 --> 01:33:19.038]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:44.662 --> 01:33:56.206]  So if you just joined us, Tucker Carlson has come out in a big German magazine interview, and the headline is, Trump hasn't kept any of his chief promises.
[01:33:56.206 --> 01:33:57.347]  Now, I'm not in a cult.
[01:33:57.347 --> 01:33:58.487]  I'm not in a Trump cult.
[01:33:58.487 --> 01:34:00.528]  So, Tucker Carlson's a smart guy, and I respect what he's doing.
[01:34:00.528 --> 01:34:02.409]  In fact, I know what he's doing.
[01:34:02.409 --> 01:34:04.910]  He's trying to point out that a lot of key things haven't been done.
[01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:06.750]  A lot of fire under the president.
[01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:08.571]  A lot of fire under the general public.
[01:34:08.571 --> 01:34:13.073]  And to point out that, as he says, this horrendous system wasn't created overnight.
[01:34:14.485 --> 01:34:16.737]  And it can't be fixed overnight.
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:27.025]  But then he goes on to say his chief promises were that he would build the wall, defund Planned Parenthood, and repeal Obamacare.
[01:34:27.025 --> 01:34:28.566]  And he hasn't done any of those things.
[01:34:28.566 --> 01:34:30.148]  And there's lots of reasons for that.
[01:34:30.148 --> 01:34:38.394]  But since I finished writing the book, I've come to believe that Trump's role is not as a conventional president who promises to get things achieved to Congress, and then does.
[01:34:38.394 --> 01:34:40.175]  I don't think that he's capable.
[01:34:40.175 --> 01:34:42.797]  I don't think he's capable of sustained focus.
[01:34:42.797 --> 01:34:44.979]  I don't think he understands the system.
[01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:46.520]  I don't think Congress is on his side.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.022]  I don't think he and his own agenda support him.
[01:34:49.807 --> 01:34:52.229]  He's not going to do that.
[01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:56.352]  Well, gosh almighty, we got a record economy turnaround.
[01:34:56.352 --> 01:34:57.612]  TPP killed.
[01:34:57.612 --> 01:35:01.855]  He's standing up to the Chi-Coms, getting way better trade deals.
[01:35:01.855 --> 01:35:05.718]  And all these other positive things are happening.
[01:35:05.718 --> 01:35:09.441]  It's because Trump is an outsider and never ran for office that he's so different.
[01:35:09.441 --> 01:35:11.522]  He said he did fire all the lobbyists.
[01:35:11.522 --> 01:35:13.544]  That's what threatens the system so much.
[01:35:16.001 --> 01:35:22.265]  I think if you look at two Supreme Court justices that are pretty conservative compared to what Hillary would do, light years better.
[01:35:22.265 --> 01:35:23.286]  That's a big victory.
[01:35:23.286 --> 01:35:24.407]  He said he would do that.
[01:35:24.407 --> 01:35:26.328]  He said that was a main pillar.
[01:35:26.328 --> 01:35:28.369]  He said a main pillar was securing our border.
[01:35:28.369 --> 01:35:31.131]  And he wanted a wall as an image.
[01:35:31.131 --> 01:35:36.775]  But we've got the military down there and it's record low number of illegal aliens in the country.
[01:35:36.775 --> 01:35:40.117]  That's a national study.
[01:35:40.117 --> 01:35:41.998]  He's got parts of Obamacare chopped up.
[01:35:41.998 --> 01:35:44.720]  He can do executively the mandate and things like that.
[01:35:45.933 --> 01:35:48.374]  But he's not a dictator.
[01:35:48.374 --> 01:35:50.295]  So I just don't think it's fair to do this.
[01:35:50.295 --> 01:35:59.099]  And it's kind of like Ann Coulter, you know, she's always got these flamboyant headlines about Trump's a traitor, he's the last Republican president.
[01:35:59.099 --> 01:36:03.901]  And sure, it gets people to read what you're writing, but I'm always getting accused of putting up flamboyant headlines to get readers.
[01:36:03.901 --> 01:36:09.003]  No, I put up a headline I think's accurate.
[01:36:09.003 --> 01:36:14.746]  Now, he goes on to admit that Trump does ask the right questions, that Democrats don't care about working people, in fact, they hate them.
[01:36:16.363 --> 01:36:18.764]  And that they are robbing people, that they're corrupt, they're bad.
[01:36:18.764 --> 01:36:21.065]  Well, yeah, Trump's fighting the carbon tax.
[01:36:21.065 --> 01:36:21.825]  He pulled out of that.
[01:36:21.825 --> 01:36:27.767]  I mean, there's so many things Trump has done that I just don't think it's fair to say that.
[01:36:27.767 --> 01:36:40.511]  What you should really say is Trump's got an incredible amount of things done despite the gridlock in Congress, despite the cowardice of the Republican Party, despite the fact the public is still generally asleep.
[01:36:40.511 --> 01:36:42.171]  I mean, how is he supposed to do everything?
[01:36:42.171 --> 01:36:43.532]  If you just blame Trump,
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:46.861]  It's like you don't have arms or legs or a brain or a mouth.
[01:36:46.861 --> 01:36:50.602]  You're just saying, he didn't do it.
[01:36:50.602 --> 01:36:53.383]  He didn't come from nowhere and go under all the attack and beat Hillary.
[01:36:53.383 --> 01:36:58.685]  He didn't lose $2 billion out of his fortune since he ran and since they boycotted him.
[01:36:58.685 --> 01:37:00.465]  He is under criminal investigation.
[01:37:00.465 --> 01:37:01.626]  He isn't being harassed.
[01:37:01.626 --> 01:37:02.946]  His family isn't harassed.
[01:37:02.946 --> 01:37:06.387]  It's like, what have you done for me lately?
[01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:11.749]  It's this hyper-decadent, instant gratification culture.
[01:37:13.755 --> 01:37:19.898]  I go to Congress to go see what's happening, and there's no constituents at House members' doorways.
[01:37:19.898 --> 01:37:21.959]  There's nobody talking to Senators.
[01:37:21.959 --> 01:37:23.799]  Oh, they're Senators like some God.
[01:37:23.799 --> 01:37:30.102]  Oh, there's... We send our reporters to the border to show tens of thousands of illegal aliens trying to come across U.N.-funded.
[01:37:30.102 --> 01:37:32.043]  It's our reporters and nobody else.
[01:37:32.043 --> 01:37:33.604]  Fox News is maybe a mile away.
[01:37:34.414 --> 01:37:38.137]  And I'm not bitching, but I'm saying take a family vacation.
[01:37:38.137 --> 01:37:40.098]  Let the kids go to San Diego.
[01:37:40.098 --> 01:37:42.220]  You go down and videotape what's happening on the border.
[01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:45.042]  You might catch something nobody else does.
[01:37:45.042 --> 01:37:48.164]  And just get in the act of putting it on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook.
[01:37:48.164 --> 01:37:51.646]  Get in the act of starting your own local news site.
[01:37:51.646 --> 01:37:53.488]  What does BuzzFeed and George Soros want?
[01:37:53.488 --> 01:37:56.229]  They want local news reporting itself shut down.
[01:37:56.229 --> 01:38:02.114]  They're blaming the yellow emergency jacket movement that's spread all over Europe on the fact that
[01:38:02.935 --> 01:38:04.576]  Locals can communicate, period.
[01:38:04.576 --> 01:38:13.042]  If you want to talk about where President Trump's failed in picking what he wants to focus on.
[01:38:13.042 --> 01:38:20.008]  He's done a great job trying to turn the economy on, thinking that people would see that they've been under bad management and that he was for them.
[01:38:20.008 --> 01:38:21.669]  Part of that they saw, part of it they didn't.
[01:38:23.288 --> 01:38:28.590]  He gets standing up to China, who's absolutely dominating and taking over because they bought off our government.
[01:38:28.590 --> 01:38:29.510]  He sees that as central.
[01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:30.230]  He's right.
[01:38:30.230 --> 01:38:37.432]  And boy, they just arrested the head of the biggest Chinese state-run company, basically for espionage against this nation.
[01:38:37.432 --> 01:38:40.293]  And our own corporate media is against him for that.
[01:38:40.293 --> 01:38:47.715]  But if you want to know where he's failed, he promised to appoint a commission to expose vaccines and all the damage they're causing, the autoimmune responses.
[01:38:47.715 --> 01:38:49.496]  He would do his own son, Barron.
[01:38:49.496 --> 01:38:50.016]  He didn't do it.
[01:38:51.554 --> 01:39:08.227]  And he has not, he's spoken about it, he's not done enough yet, on antitrust and lying to Congress about big tech, about censorship of nationalists, Christians, conservatives, and Patriot supporters.
[01:39:08.227 --> 01:39:14.351]  He said he'd get out of Afghanistan, and then now they understand it's about blocking China moving into Afghanistan, so we have him.
[01:39:14.351 --> 01:39:15.932]  He failed us on that.
[01:39:15.932 --> 01:39:17.914]  I follow all the real issues, but compared
[01:39:19.551 --> 01:39:21.051]  To a Hillary Clinton, it's night and day.
[01:39:21.051 --> 01:39:25.592]  And Trump's trying as hard as he can to deliver on what he said he would do.
[01:39:25.592 --> 01:39:31.034]  And so, this process of getting pissed off and thinking he's betrayed us, it's not accurate.
[01:39:31.034 --> 01:39:34.474]  He will gain you brownie points with the mainstream medium.
[01:39:34.474 --> 01:39:41.936]  And then they'll go read Tucker Carlson's full interview where he actually indicts the Democrats for hating America and hating the middle class and creating a crisis.
[01:39:41.936 --> 01:39:46.157]  I get why Carlson did it, was to make himself look non-biased.
[01:39:48.459 --> 01:39:54.622]  But I think overall it was probably quoted out of context as well and just goes too far over the other side.
[01:39:54.622 --> 01:39:56.563]  But that isn't really what matters.
[01:39:56.563 --> 01:39:58.684]  It's about us looking in the mirror and asking what we've done.
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:19.294]  To restore this republic, to restore our own futures, to stand up, to be involved, and it's about recognizing that the Democrats are totally gone, the Republicans are a bunch of blue-blood scum, and we've begun the process with the Freedom Caucus and others of getting real Republicans elected that will vote with the President, and that's happening!
[01:40:21.428 --> 01:40:23.730]  That's what the Democrats have had to resort to fraud.
[01:40:23.730 --> 01:40:30.375]  Now I know one of our Affiliate Relations guys who does a great job, Scott Bronson, wanted to pop in and give his take on this.
[01:40:30.375 --> 01:40:34.459]  I don't know what his take is yet exactly, but he's always making good points to me in the hallways.
[01:40:34.459 --> 01:40:36.460]  Scott, you wanted to come on here and talk about this.
[01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:37.021]  Give us your take.
[01:40:37.941 --> 01:40:45.063]  Yeah, I believe that Tucker has just put the blame on the wrong party.
[01:40:45.063 --> 01:40:46.444]  I think it's the Republicans.
[01:40:46.444 --> 01:40:48.244]  The Republicans are to blame for this.
[01:40:48.244 --> 01:40:49.025]  It's not Trump.
[01:40:49.025 --> 01:40:50.685]  The Republicans are losers.
[01:40:50.685 --> 01:40:52.286]  They are losers.
[01:40:52.286 --> 01:40:53.746]  And losers lose.
[01:40:53.746 --> 01:40:56.047]  They controlled the House, the Senate,
[01:40:56.687 --> 01:41:03.012]  And the executive branch, they could have did whatever they want, and they sat and they went for the tool of the loser.
[01:41:03.012 --> 01:41:04.353]  Compromise.
[01:41:04.353 --> 01:41:05.855]  I want to compromise.
[01:41:05.855 --> 01:41:07.616]  We need to come up with a deal.
[01:41:07.616 --> 01:41:11.539]  There is no deal that can be made if you think you are right.
[01:41:11.539 --> 01:41:17.864]  You either believe in the Second Amendment and people can own guns and all the stuff that comes with that, or you don't.
[01:41:17.864 --> 01:41:23.729]  You either believe in free speech and people are allowed to say everything that they want, or you don't.
[01:41:23.729 --> 01:41:25.771]  There's no compromise on those things.
[01:41:26.471 --> 01:41:33.035]  You either believe that you need to defund Planned Parenthood and you take the steps to do that, or you don't.
[01:41:33.035 --> 01:41:35.676]  And it's not Trump that hasn't done that.
[01:41:35.676 --> 01:41:37.617]  It's our elected Republicans.
[01:41:37.617 --> 01:41:37.897]  That's right.
[01:41:37.897 --> 01:41:43.920]  He went and marched repeatedly in Sudden Pants with the pro-life demonstrations, something Reagan wouldn't even do.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:44.360]  Exactly.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.283]  He's done, he has attempted everything he said he would do and gotten so much done.
[01:41:48.283 --> 01:41:50.524]  That's why I don't want to say it's obscene, because I respect her, Harrelson.
[01:41:51.164 --> 01:41:57.088]  But, I mean, it really is to sit back and say that he's done none of his main tenets.
[01:41:57.088 --> 01:41:58.249]  What about TPP?
[01:41:58.249 --> 01:41:59.850]  What about trying to defend the border?
[01:41:59.850 --> 01:42:02.171]  What about getting good Supreme Court justice put in?
[01:42:02.171 --> 01:42:03.572]  What about getting jobs to come back?
[01:42:03.572 --> 01:42:05.213]  What about turning the economy back on?
[01:42:05.213 --> 01:42:09.095]  He's done it all, and now he's being counter-offensed by the Federal Reserve.
[01:42:09.095 --> 01:42:11.257]  Why didn't Tucker Carlson talk about the Federal Reserve?
[01:42:11.257 --> 01:42:12.378]  And I'm not telling Tucker what to do.
[01:42:12.378 --> 01:42:13.518]  I'm not even mad at Tucker.
[01:42:13.518 --> 01:42:14.559]  It's good for debate.
[01:42:14.559 --> 01:42:16.000]  I think Tucker just wants to spur debate.
[01:42:17.915 --> 01:42:21.297]  I don't know what he wants to do, but I think he's putting the blame at the wrong people.
[01:42:21.297 --> 01:42:23.878]  There's two types of people out there now.
[01:42:23.878 --> 01:42:26.599]  You have the Republicans, and then the Republicans.
[01:42:26.599 --> 01:42:30.241]  The Republicans keep telling us, oh, we can't repeal Obamacare.
[01:42:30.241 --> 01:42:32.122]  So then Trump took the step that he could.
[01:42:32.122 --> 01:42:38.746]  He took away the single payer, the part where we have to pay if we don't have... The mandate.
[01:42:38.746 --> 01:42:40.767]  Yeah, the mandate.
[01:42:40.767 --> 01:42:41.747]  So he took that away.
[01:42:41.747 --> 01:42:42.488]  That's what he could do.
[01:42:43.308 --> 01:42:45.589]  It's on them to make the laws.
[01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:48.090]  It's not the president's job to make laws.
[01:42:48.090 --> 01:42:50.771]  Well, Tucker makes that point that, well, he isn't from the swamp, don't know how to deal with it.
[01:42:50.771 --> 01:42:52.612]  Well, that's as long as he's gotten anything done.
[01:42:52.612 --> 01:42:57.374]  Because you're right, the whole swamp is a bunch of glad-handing fake lawyers.

[01:43:56.997 --> 01:44:03.384]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[01:44:03.384 --> 01:44:04.946]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[01:44:04.946 --> 01:44:09.851]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patreon points.
[01:44:09.851 --> 01:44:12.795]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[01:44:13.315 --> 01:44:16.056]  A free gift with every order.
[01:44:16.056 --> 01:44:24.918]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[01:44:24.918 --> 01:44:28.578]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[01:44:28.578 --> 01:44:33.939]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[01:44:33.939 --> 01:44:36.320]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:41.741]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[01:44:41.741 --> 01:44:43.282]  So this is a loss leader.
[01:44:43.282 --> 01:44:44.862]  We are losing money on this.
[01:44:44.862 --> 01:44:46.282]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:44:46.282 --> 01:44:48.283]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.

[01:47:26.842 --> 01:47:28.823]  Mark Dice is coming up the third hour live.
[01:47:28.823 --> 01:47:33.207]  The only place you get Mark Dice live is InfoWars.
[01:47:33.207 --> 01:47:39.072]  That's a better job live than he does those viral videos.
[01:47:39.072 --> 01:47:39.873]  Look, here is the
[01:47:41.571 --> 01:47:51.520]  Bottom line, as they say, our country had half the world's wealth in 1955, with 4% of the world's population.
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:53.362]  We had more money than 96% of people.
[01:47:53.362 --> 01:47:54.723]  That means real assets.
[01:47:54.723 --> 01:47:57.666]  Because we had a middle class, that's what produces wealth.
[01:47:57.666 --> 01:48:00.929]  But the left teaches us having wealth made somebody else poor.
[01:48:00.929 --> 01:48:02.290]  No, that's not how it works.
[01:48:02.290 --> 01:48:04.812]  Real free market wealth creates more wealth like an engine.
[01:48:04.812 --> 01:48:06.754]  It's like alchemy.
[01:48:09.036 --> 01:48:17.126]  But Trump has come in trying to remind people what made us great, and he's under attack by the political establishment that sold us out.
[01:48:17.126 --> 01:48:20.911]  And Scott Bronson, he makes a lot of great points during the break, he's one of our float relations guys.
[01:48:20.911 --> 01:48:24.856]  I've known Scott for years, probably 10-12 years.
[01:48:24.856 --> 01:48:26.297]  He's worked for another network before I hired him away.
[01:48:29.895 --> 01:48:31.437]  You made another good point about the Republicans.
[01:48:31.437 --> 01:48:35.822]  They're just a bunch of lawyers acting like they're conservatives trying to make a deal.
[01:48:35.822 --> 01:48:37.624]  On the Democrats, they're ideologues.
[01:48:37.624 --> 01:48:38.706]  They're a cult.
[01:48:38.706 --> 01:48:42.550]  They're the anti-America, anti-God, anti-Christ club.
[01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:43.972]  Restate what you just said during the break.
[01:48:46.194 --> 01:48:52.179]  I think that the Republicans are the people that people are voting for right now because they don't know what they want to do.
[01:48:52.179 --> 01:48:53.961]  So they're not going to mess everything up.
[01:48:53.961 --> 01:48:59.565]  But if you vote for the Democrats, they want a world that has no guns, no borders and everything.
[01:48:59.565 --> 01:49:01.146]  You can't say what you want.
[01:49:01.146 --> 01:49:02.628]  So that's not a world I want to live in.
[01:49:03.345 --> 01:49:06.827]  But the Republicans, they rely on, again, the tool of the loser.
[01:49:06.827 --> 01:49:07.608]  Compromise.
[01:49:07.608 --> 01:49:19.736]  They have no idea what they want to do, and they think that the things that they run on, that they want to do, that if they follow through with what they say, that somehow that's going to punish them.
[01:49:19.736 --> 01:49:21.817]  And everybody likes people that tell the truth.
[01:49:21.817 --> 01:49:27.801]  So if you actually run on truth, and follow through with what you're saying, people will love you.
[01:49:27.801 --> 01:49:30.163]  And they hide, they coward, and they wait.
[01:49:34.246 --> 01:49:39.112]  Because you're absolutely right when you ask, why are they coming after us?
[01:49:39.112 --> 01:49:40.554]  Why are the Republicans cowards?
[01:49:40.554 --> 01:49:42.095]  Why are they scared?
[01:49:42.095 --> 01:49:44.859]  It's because look at how they come after us.
[01:49:44.859 --> 01:49:46.981]  Look at how they demonize Infowars.
[01:49:46.981 --> 01:49:48.122]  The truth is popular.
[01:49:48.122 --> 01:49:48.883]  The truth is great.
[01:49:48.883 --> 01:49:49.664]  So they censor it.
[01:49:49.664 --> 01:49:50.265]  They block it.
[01:49:50.265 --> 01:49:51.106]  They sue it.
[01:49:51.106 --> 01:49:53.469]  They try to shut it down because the globalists can't compete with it.
[01:49:55.294 --> 01:49:56.235]  A hundred percent.
[01:49:56.235 --> 01:50:00.680]  And look, Trump has put more money in my pocket.
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:01.941]  That's a good thing.
[01:50:01.941 --> 01:50:05.024]  I know how to spend my money better than the government knows how to spend my money.
[01:50:05.024 --> 01:50:10.450]  But beyond that, the media, the corporate media says saying America exists is evil.
[01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:12.690]  That American flags are bad.
[01:50:12.690 --> 01:50:15.571]  That's obviously an outside foreign group.
[01:50:15.571 --> 01:50:20.634]  Like, aliens show up, they say, lower your flags, submit, you're scum, admit you're bad.
[01:50:20.634 --> 01:50:22.555]  I mean, this is 101.
[01:50:22.555 --> 01:50:33.481]  We're being taken over by people that literally, like, Apple runs the worst slave factories, pays people the worst, and uses the Communist Party to kill people that try to organize.
[01:50:33.481 --> 01:50:36.683]  Even the Communist Party tells Apple, you're too brutal.
[01:50:36.683 --> 01:50:38.084]  But because Tim Cook literally goes,
[01:50:39.144 --> 01:50:42.126]  It's okay!
[01:50:42.126 --> 01:50:43.366]  It's sick!
[01:50:43.366 --> 01:50:43.806]  It's sick!
[01:50:43.806 --> 01:50:52.351]  It's like the left funding the Arab Spring, murdering over a million people, blowing up all these countries, and then the left's like, it's beautiful!
[01:50:52.351 --> 01:50:53.611]  No, it's not beautiful!
[01:50:53.611 --> 01:50:55.112]  You're sick, evil scum!
[01:50:57.612 --> 01:51:01.113]  Yeah, I don't get it.
[01:51:01.113 --> 01:51:03.894]  Me, myself, I'm more of a libertarian liberal.
[01:51:03.894 --> 01:51:06.695]  I'm a liberal person.
[01:51:06.695 --> 01:51:10.376]  But I cannot go to the left because they're against freedom.
[01:51:10.376 --> 01:51:13.717]  They're against everything that America used to be.
[01:51:14.822 --> 01:51:17.504]  Uh, they're terrifying.
[01:51:17.504 --> 01:51:20.985]  What they want is absolutely terrifying to me.
[01:51:20.985 --> 01:51:25.068]  So, because of that, I only have one side to go to.
[01:51:25.068 --> 01:51:32.352]  And now, because they've moved their line so far to the left, that I could believe in everything that used to be center.
[01:51:33.354 --> 01:51:34.795]  Now I'm far right.
[01:51:34.795 --> 01:51:36.677]  Now I'm an evil person.
[01:51:36.677 --> 01:51:41.861]  Now I have to explain to my 12-year-old kid that you're a white guy.
[01:51:41.861 --> 01:51:43.842]  It's okay to be a white guy.
[01:51:43.842 --> 01:51:46.845]  Nobody wants to get after you and hurt you.
[01:51:46.845 --> 01:51:48.806]  But that's not the stuff that he sees.
[01:51:48.806 --> 01:51:53.370]  He sees things on the news about how white people are bad.
[01:51:53.370 --> 01:51:54.691]  White men are the cause of all things wrong.
[01:51:54.691 --> 01:51:57.854]  And it's the corporate media that is injecting the opposite of Martin Luther King
[01:51:59.168 --> 01:52:03.950]  And then we have to deal with it if we tell our kids, because my kids hear this too, and I go, no, it's not true.
[01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:05.290]  And they say, Daddy, are you racist?
[01:52:05.290 --> 01:52:07.491]  Because whites are inherently evil.
[01:52:07.491 --> 01:52:13.193]  And I'm like, no, that's... I've got to play a Martin Luther King clip saying everybody's good.
[01:52:13.193 --> 01:52:14.553]  It's what you stand for.
[01:52:14.553 --> 01:52:16.133]  And that makes sense to them.
[01:52:16.133 --> 01:52:19.334]  But that's how whacked out this globalist ideology is.
[01:52:19.334 --> 01:52:20.535]  Scott, keep up the great work.
[01:52:20.535 --> 01:52:21.555]  God bless you.
[01:52:21.555 --> 01:52:22.636]  Thanks.
[01:52:22.636 --> 01:52:23.516]  Mark Dice is coming up.
[01:52:24.895 --> 01:52:26.977]  And, you know, I've covered a lot of the breaking news.
[01:52:26.977 --> 01:52:29.059]  There's a lot of new breaking news in the last few hours.
[01:52:29.059 --> 01:52:33.403]  Trump has obviously chosen a new Attorney General nominee, William Barr.
[01:52:33.403 --> 01:52:34.644]  We're looking at that.
[01:52:34.644 --> 01:52:39.088]  You got Mueller set to release a bunch of his BS in the next hour.
[01:52:39.088 --> 01:52:40.769]  We're going to be tracking it all.
[01:52:40.769 --> 01:52:43.492]  We're going to have special live broadcasts this weekend on Saturday.
[01:52:43.492 --> 01:52:48.036]  We're going to have reporters on the ground in Paris for the white
[01:52:49.252 --> 01:52:52.974]  Jacket demonstration that threatens to bring down the whole EU combine.
[01:52:52.974 --> 01:52:55.135]  So as bad as it is, a lot of good things are happening.
[01:52:55.135 --> 01:52:58.837]  That's all coming up.
[01:52:58.837 --> 01:53:01.198]  And then I've got these other articles I haven't hit yet, too.
[01:53:01.198 --> 01:53:03.279]  I mean, I've got an article here in the U.S.
[01:53:03.279 --> 01:53:05.620]  on newswars.com.
[01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:10.923]  Teacher fired for not using the transgender student's new pronouns.
[01:53:12.688 --> 01:53:13.588]  It's always a new language.
[01:53:13.588 --> 01:53:19.590]  He goes, I'll call them by a girl's name, but I'm not going to speak this Martian ji-wang-kwang-gong-gong.
[01:53:19.590 --> 01:53:23.191]  They said, you're fired!
[01:53:23.191 --> 01:53:26.232]  And it's always more, more, more, more, isn't it?
[01:53:26.232 --> 01:53:28.313]  Controlling language, telling you what to do.
[01:53:28.313 --> 01:53:29.453]  We are in such a cult.
[01:53:31.442 --> 01:53:35.565]  And then I've got some really sarcastic, sickening stuff dealing with Schwarzenegger and Bernie Sanders.
[01:53:35.565 --> 01:53:38.648]  I don't know which one has a stupider sounding voice.
[01:53:38.648 --> 01:53:43.011]  Ah yes, do not drive cars, but I own 20 N jets!
[01:53:43.011 --> 01:53:50.797]  Or you've got... I'm Bernie Sanders and you cannot have a carbon footprint or you should be arrested.
[01:53:50.797 --> 01:53:53.499]  But I have private jets as well.
[01:53:53.499 --> 01:53:57.322]  And I swindled universities for my money.
[01:53:57.322 --> 01:54:00.445]  Because I don't work, I steal your money.
[01:54:02.352 --> 01:54:06.034]  So that's all coming up as well here today.
[01:54:06.034 --> 01:54:08.415]  Listen, listeners, you're awesome.
[01:54:08.415 --> 01:54:09.636]  I salute you.
[01:54:09.636 --> 01:54:12.018]  I thank you over and over again.
[01:54:12.018 --> 01:54:17.381]  You are too amazing for me to even describe how cool you are.
[01:54:17.381 --> 01:54:25.645]  But this is a little bit beyond that, because InfoWars has now become a symbol in this fight.
[01:54:25.645 --> 01:54:28.187]  And if they can shut us down or keep us from transmitting,
[01:54:29.684 --> 01:54:31.386]  They think they won the whole game.
[01:54:31.386 --> 01:54:33.187]  They're going to move on to everyone else that you've now seen.
[01:54:33.187 --> 01:54:38.812]  Now, I've got a few tricks up my sleeve, and I haven't really played them yet.
[01:54:38.812 --> 01:54:42.796]  We're going to start playing some of those here in the next few months.
[01:54:42.796 --> 01:54:47.540]  Let's just say I'm a general that fights from the front, politically.
[01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:56.728]  And if you'll simply not have horrible traffic, and not fight horrible crowds, and not get gouged on prices, and just go to InfoWarsTore.com with our secure, high-quality shopping cart,
[01:54:57.987 --> 01:55:14.395]  And get non-GMO heirloom seeds for the spring, or water filtration, or air filtration, the very best systems, or great supplements, or books, or videos, or t-shirts, or optics, whatever the coolest, best-selling, highest-rated thing is, I go buy a bunch of them and sell them for a lower price.
[01:55:14.395 --> 01:55:16.516]  We have the 12 days of Christmas.
[01:55:16.516 --> 01:55:20.158]  We're now in, I think, day four of this.
[01:55:20.158 --> 01:55:22.039]  And we have free shipping store-wide.
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:28.203]  50 is the lowest discount, up to 75% off, so 50 or more store-wide.
[01:55:28.203 --> 01:55:33.726]  Double Patriot points, so every order you get, not 5 cents on the next dollar, but 10 cents on the next dollar for the next order.
[01:55:33.726 --> 01:55:39.069]  And it gets even more insane, which is truly insane.
[01:55:39.069 --> 01:55:48.234]  A free, we are all Alex Jones, don't censor me, don't tread on me, black and white t-shirt, a really nice fabric, really comfortable t-shirt.
[01:55:48.234 --> 01:55:49.374]  You can pick your size.
[01:55:49.374 --> 01:55:50.555]  That's free shipping and the t-shirt.
[01:55:51.533 --> 01:55:54.094]  That's 10 bucks right there on average.
[01:55:54.094 --> 01:56:00.297]  Well, if you're buying a tube of toothpaste that's already discounted, like Ploidal Silver, Iodine Fortified, Fluoride Free, Super Blue, it's for $7.
[01:56:00.297 --> 01:56:09.181]  You have to understand that I'm making like $3 on that, so I'm losing... I'm losing $10 on that.
[01:56:09.181 --> 01:56:11.842]  So that's how good these deals are.
[01:56:11.842 --> 01:56:14.543]  Everybody needs to get, we're on all Alex Jones.
[01:56:14.543 --> 01:56:18.425]  I said come up with a best-selling t-shirt, I don't have my name on it, but it is kind of triggering and good to wear.
[01:56:19.042 --> 01:56:20.843]  Those shirts are going to sell out very soon, though.
[01:56:20.843 --> 01:56:22.103]  Every order gets one.
[01:56:22.103 --> 01:56:27.486]  By Monday or even earlier, there'll be one of our other new shirts that you'll see up there when you get it.
[01:56:27.486 --> 01:56:28.686]  You pick the size, you'll be getting that shirt.
[01:56:28.686 --> 01:56:30.207]  But right now, it's still this shirt.
[01:56:30.207 --> 01:56:33.008]  It's one of the great shirts as well, so never fear.
[01:56:33.008 --> 01:56:35.009]  50 to 75% off.
[01:56:35.009 --> 01:56:36.690]  Storewide free shipping on top of that.
[01:56:36.690 --> 01:56:38.651]  Double Patriot points and a free t-shirt.
[01:56:40.131 --> 01:56:41.692]  You're insane.
[01:56:41.692 --> 01:56:45.854]  If you don't just go do some basic shopping, do all your shopping there.
[01:56:45.854 --> 01:56:47.455]  Give somebody a seed bank.
[01:56:47.455 --> 01:56:50.056]  Get them to plant in the spring.
[01:56:50.056 --> 01:56:52.338]  Give somebody a water filtration system.
[01:56:52.338 --> 01:56:57.981]  We sold out of the Alexa Pure Pro at that loss leader price, but now they have the Alexa Breeze.
[01:56:57.981 --> 01:57:01.983]  Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration, made by the same great company, five-stage HEPA filter,
[01:57:02.883 --> 01:57:03.264]  I think so.
[01:57:22.742 --> 01:57:23.182]  Awesome.
[01:57:23.182 --> 01:57:24.063]  90-something bucks.
[01:57:24.063 --> 01:57:25.444]  We make 30-something bucks.
[01:57:25.444 --> 01:57:26.525]  Built by the Infowar.
[01:57:26.525 --> 01:57:29.688]  You cannot beat this for your house, for your family.
[01:57:29.688 --> 01:57:31.729]  And you just clean off the filters and put them right back in.
[01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:37.074]  Alexa Pure Breeze is now at InfowarStore.com for $127.
[01:57:37.074 --> 01:57:38.995]  It's a steal at $249.
[01:57:38.995 --> 01:57:39.996]  It's at $127.
[01:57:39.996 --> 01:57:42.118]  You'll never see this deal again.
[01:57:42.118 --> 01:57:43.859]  We'll be right back with Mark Dice.
[01:57:43.859 --> 01:57:44.300]  Stay with us.
[01:57:48.502 --> 01:57:57.024]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalist and live in a free society.

[01:58:56.118 --> 01:59:05.327]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before, as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.

[01:59:25.281 --> 01:59:27.943]  You fund the very tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.

[02:00:08.911 --> 02:00:27.942]  On a long, lonesome highway east of Omaha You can listen to the engine moaning out his one-note song You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
[02:00:29.577 --> 02:00:35.840]  All right, Mark Dice, best-selling author, political analyst, news analyst, will be joining us.
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:41.442]  We are carrying his new book, Liberalism, Find a Cure.
[02:00:41.442 --> 02:00:48.045]  Everybody should get it at infowarsstore.com, have a piece of history on your shelf, or buy two copies and donate one to the library.
[02:00:48.045 --> 02:00:49.626]  That is an act of incredible resistance.
[02:00:49.626 --> 02:00:52.687]  You know, don't just love these great people out there, there's not many of them.
[02:00:54.457 --> 02:00:59.739]  Like a Matt Drudge, like a Mark Dice, like a Paul Joseph Watson trying to get Paul to write a book.
[02:00:59.739 --> 02:01:01.560]  Write a book!
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:04.642]  And then when they write a book, buy the book and support them.
[02:01:04.642 --> 02:01:07.043]  No reviews yet because we just got it at the store a few days ago.
[02:01:07.043 --> 02:01:09.204]  We now have it in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:01:09.204 --> 02:01:12.605]  Here's one of his latest reports where he breaks all this down.
[02:01:12.605 --> 02:01:13.426]  They just can't stop.
[02:01:14.517 --> 02:01:15.678]  President George H.W.
[02:01:15.678 --> 02:01:26.704]  Bush's funeral was yesterday, but the liberal media couldn't take a break from their non-stop Trump trashing and decided to use the occasion to continue to complain about the current president.
[02:01:26.704 --> 02:01:35.309]  But what becomes undeniably obvious with every bio run about Bush 41 is that stark contrast between these two men.
[02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:44.238]  Over the last two years, deviancy has continued being defined down by this current president, his cronies, his supporters.
[02:01:44.238 --> 02:01:49.403]  Look, Donald Trump is 180 from whom George H.W.
[02:01:49.403 --> 02:01:50.645]  Bush is.
[02:01:50.645 --> 02:01:54.589]  The world looked to George Bush because he was a leader respected.
[02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:56.310]  He had proven himself.
[02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:57.632]  This president has yet to do that.
[02:01:58.041 --> 02:02:03.029]  This president that we have now is trying to unravel everything that he did and Obama did.
[02:02:03.029 --> 02:02:06.314]  I think he's doing this because he feels he has to do it.
[02:02:06.314 --> 02:02:12.523]  I can't help but wonder if there was a thought bubble over Donald Trump's head just now.
[02:02:12.523 --> 02:02:13.625]  What he was thinking.
[02:02:13.965 --> 02:02:16.426]  I have to imagine he was thinking, how much longer do I have to stand here?
[02:02:16.426 --> 02:02:20.467]  We may not approve of this current president, but that doesn't diminish one's respect for the office.
[02:02:20.467 --> 02:02:22.368]  Because there are a lot of things about George H.W.
[02:02:22.368 --> 02:02:26.249]  Bush that maybe people now appreciate that they didn't appreciate at the time.
[02:02:26.249 --> 02:02:36.073]  It just gives you a sense of the big character of the man and the contrast with the small character we see.
[02:02:36.693 --> 02:02:37.094]  Oh yeah.
[02:02:37.094 --> 02:02:38.575]  And that is why we celebrate George H.W.
[02:02:38.575 --> 02:02:41.537]  Bush's legacy and fear the next two years of Mr. Trump's wild
[02:02:59.292 --> 02:03:00.233]  White House ride.
[02:03:24.348 --> 02:03:28.489]  He didn't reach all the way across to three other people to take her, to shake her hand.
[02:03:28.489 --> 02:03:29.469]  So it's his fault?
[02:03:29.469 --> 02:03:30.830]  Of course, it always is.
[02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:33.170]  But so what?
[02:03:33.170 --> 02:03:37.211]  Our president met the minimal standards of decency, and that's news.
[02:03:37.211 --> 02:03:43.152]  Well, that's certainly a very unique way to pay tribute to a former president by trashing the current one.
[02:03:43.152 --> 02:03:45.173]  Look what they even put on the lower third.
[02:03:45.173 --> 02:03:49.134]  Trump awkwardly greets ex-presidents at Bush 41 funeral.
[02:03:50.194 --> 02:03:54.058]  Actually, the only thing that looked awkward during the funeral was Hillary Clinton!
[02:03:54.058 --> 02:03:55.779]  The heck is she doing here?
[02:03:55.779 --> 02:03:59.623]  The poor woman can't even stand at a podium without breaking out into a coughing fit.
[02:03:59.623 --> 02:04:03.966]  She can't walk down a flight of stairs without slipping and spraining her wrist.
[02:04:03.966 --> 02:04:07.730]  And now she can't even sit in a chair without looking like she's about to pass out!
[02:04:07.950 --> 02:04:15.876]  You saw the President of the United States, President Trump, sitting there watching all of this, not given a role to speak for the unusual for an incumbent president.
[02:04:15.876 --> 02:04:17.878]  At times seemed to be a little defiant.
[02:04:17.878 --> 02:04:29.927]  He held his hands up, arms up like this, as if he wasn't quite happy with what he was hearing, but otherwise kept quiet, decided not to make any remarks to spoil the occasion.
[02:04:29.927 --> 02:04:33.310]  So, you know, it was a coming together for Washington, I think.
[02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:37.133]  You know, I don't like Donald Trump at all, but at least he didn't ruin George H.W.
[02:04:37.133 --> 02:04:39.435]  Bush's funeral like we all thought he would!
[02:04:39.435 --> 02:04:47.141]  Even little Ben Shapiro, Bill Kristol's neocon protege, revealed his true colors again, tweeting out a photo of the current and past president, saying,
[02:04:56.209 --> 02:05:02.619]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[02:05:02.619 --> 02:05:04.181]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[02:05:04.181 --> 02:05:09.088]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[02:05:09.088 --> 02:05:12.013]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[02:05:12.533 --> 02:05:15.295]  A free gift with every order.
[02:05:15.295 --> 02:05:24.143]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[02:05:24.143 --> 02:05:27.805]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[02:05:27.805 --> 02:05:31.789]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day.
[02:05:31.789 --> 02:05:35.572]  It's there until it sells out, then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[02:05:36.112 --> 02:05:40.974]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[02:05:40.974 --> 02:05:42.495]  So this is a loss leader.
[02:05:42.495 --> 02:05:44.075]  We are losing money on this.
[02:05:44.075 --> 02:05:45.516]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[02:05:45.516 --> 02:05:47.517]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[02:05:47.517 --> 02:05:48.837]  And don't fight the crowds.
[02:05:48.837 --> 02:05:50.278]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:05:50.278 --> 02:05:51.778]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[02:06:01.613 --> 02:06:05.636]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:05.636 --> 02:06:13.522]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:26.389 --> 02:06:28.131]  It's Friday, December 7, 2018.
[02:06:28.131 --> 02:06:31.554]  One of my favorite people, Mark Dice, is here with us.
[02:06:31.554 --> 02:06:38.821]  Dr. Nick Baggage is going to be hosting in studio here coming up the fourth hour today in the War Room with Owen Schroyer, Roger Shull, and others.
[02:06:38.821 --> 02:06:42.665]  Probably a critical day with the fake Mueller report, Mueller report set to come out.
[02:06:42.665 --> 02:06:47.369]  The new attorney general that's been nominated by Trump, William Barr, we'll be looking at it all.
[02:06:47.369 --> 02:06:51.013]  But Mark Dice, media analyst, best-selling author,
[02:06:52.185 --> 02:06:55.886]  Billions of views on YouTube alone is here with us for the balance of the hour.
[02:06:55.886 --> 02:06:57.026]  MarkDice.com.
[02:06:57.026 --> 02:06:59.307]  His new book, Liberalism Find a Cure by Mark Dice.
[02:06:59.307 --> 02:07:01.188]  Remember those things called books?
[02:07:01.188 --> 02:07:01.908]  Get it.
[02:07:01.908 --> 02:07:02.788]  Read it.
[02:07:02.788 --> 02:07:03.728]  Buy a second copy.
[02:07:03.728 --> 02:07:05.009]  Donate to the library.
[02:07:05.009 --> 02:07:06.449]  It will change the world.
[02:07:06.449 --> 02:07:07.490]  Every little bit counts.
[02:07:07.490 --> 02:07:08.930]  No reviews yet.
[02:07:08.930 --> 02:07:11.671]  It's gone to like number one in political on Amazon.
[02:07:11.671 --> 02:07:12.811]  We got it a few weeks after.
[02:07:12.811 --> 02:07:16.632]  We now have it at Infowarsstore.com, so no reviews there, but five-star reviews.
[02:07:16.632 --> 02:07:17.332]  I've read the book.
[02:07:17.332 --> 02:07:18.133]  It's amazing.
[02:07:18.133 --> 02:07:18.813]  Get the book today.
[02:07:19.133 --> 02:07:22.216]  I mean, I know one of your latest reports is on this fawning for George H.W.
[02:07:22.216 --> 02:07:22.396]  Bush
[02:07:45.256 --> 02:07:48.320]  This New World Order guy and then the attacks on Trump.
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:54.229]  One of the top Chi-Com operatives who built spy chips in the cell phones gets arrested by the U.S.
[02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:55.872]  I mean, where do you want to start?
[02:07:55.872 --> 02:07:57.795]  This is just a crazy time to be alive right now.
[02:07:59.025 --> 02:07:59.805]  Great to be with you.
[02:07:59.805 --> 02:08:05.148]  I do want to get into some of the madness in Hollywood, the Oscars debacle with Kevin Hart now having to step down.
[02:08:05.148 --> 02:08:06.248]  He was going to host them.
[02:08:06.248 --> 02:08:12.291]  But first of all, regarding liberalism and the mental disorder that it is, there is... I mean, it's not a joke.
[02:08:12.291 --> 02:08:13.332]  This isn't hyperbole.
[02:08:13.332 --> 02:08:18.114]  It really is some kind of a defect or a disease or a mental disorder.
[02:08:18.114 --> 02:08:24.697]  In fact, there was a documentary produced by PBS hosted by David Eagleman, which you can find on Netflix or Prime, maybe even on YouTube.
[02:08:25.198 --> 02:08:32.416]  Where he went to a neural imaging laboratory at Virginia Tech and one of the neurologists there discovered an interesting connection.
[02:08:33.132 --> 02:08:47.217]  By scanning people's brains, he has determined a test that with a 95% accuracy, he can tell from an MRI or an fMRI, a functional MRI, whether or not someone is a liberal or a conservative.
[02:08:47.217 --> 02:08:50.038]  And so that leads many people to wonder, well, what's the difference?
[02:08:50.038 --> 02:08:54.579]  How can you tell from a brain scan whether someone is a left-wing or right-wing person?
[02:08:54.579 --> 02:08:56.040]  And the answer makes perfect sense.
[02:08:56.798 --> 02:09:06.244]  What he did is, these people in the MRI, he showed them images of disgusting things like dead bodies and food being eaten by maggots.
[02:09:06.244 --> 02:09:15.611]  Anything that any normal person should be disgusted and repelled by, just from the normal protective mechanisms that have been built into the human brain.
[02:09:16.386 --> 02:09:21.272]  And liberals do not feel the levels of disgust that normal people do.
[02:09:21.272 --> 02:09:30.702]  And in fact, the less they feel disgusted towards seeing or experiencing what normal people see as disgusting things,
[02:09:31.403 --> 02:09:37.086]  The more liberal they are, which makes perfect sense because the liberals' brains are defective.
[02:09:37.086 --> 02:09:38.486]  They can't see right and wrong.
[02:09:38.486 --> 02:09:40.287]  Their consciences are seared.
[02:09:40.287 --> 02:09:45.249]  The Bible calls it the reprobate mind because they've turned themselves over to evil.
[02:09:45.249 --> 02:09:49.071]  And now this poor neurologist at Virginia Tech's imaging laboratory
[02:09:49.591 --> 02:09:53.834]  He's horrified really at his findings because think of the implications of this.
[02:09:53.834 --> 02:10:02.481]  He has proved that liberals have no conscience, that when they see something that should absolutely freak out a normal person, they feel nothing.
[02:10:02.481 --> 02:10:06.324]  They see nothing wrong with it because their minds are literally defective.
[02:10:07.076 --> 02:10:10.759]  You know, you just said one of the deepest things I've ever heard, and you're absolutely right.
[02:10:10.759 --> 02:10:11.600]  This is everything.
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:14.382]  Because it's not just this one MRI study.
[02:10:14.382 --> 02:10:24.751]  They found that, and we call it the modern term, just like gay used to mean, let's have a gay old time, yabba-dee-yabba-doo time on the Flintstones.
[02:10:25.231 --> 02:10:26.672]  Now that word's been taken away.
[02:10:26.672 --> 02:10:28.093]  You've made that point.
[02:10:28.093 --> 02:10:29.974]  So now, we call them liberal.
[02:10:29.974 --> 02:10:31.675]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.
[02:10:31.675 --> 02:10:42.541]  When Pompeo said, America wants to defend the liberal order again, that means more personal freedom, more of your taxes, more Second Amendment rights, more property rights.
[02:10:42.541 --> 02:10:46.144]  Liberal just means, you know, more, or more open.
[02:10:46.144 --> 02:10:47.384]  They're really leftist.
[02:10:47.384 --> 02:10:49.366]  So when they do the studies and say liberals,
[02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:53.051]  are mentally ill, they're sociopathic or psychotic.
[02:10:53.051 --> 02:10:54.352]  Every study shows it.
[02:10:54.352 --> 02:10:56.492]  Nine times more likely in British and U.S.
[02:10:56.492 --> 02:10:56.853]  studies.
[02:10:56.853 --> 02:10:57.613]  Showed the same thing.
[02:10:57.613 --> 02:10:58.553]  Major universities.
[02:10:58.553 --> 02:11:00.014]  Liberals did this.
[02:11:00.014 --> 02:11:05.756]  They found that, quote, liberals, really leftists, are more likely to virtue signal but not actually give to charity.
[02:11:05.756 --> 02:11:07.977]  Nine times less likely to give to charity.
[02:11:07.977 --> 02:11:09.798]  Six times more likely to steal.
[02:11:09.798 --> 02:11:13.359]  They found it in Russia, in Japan, in the United States.
[02:11:13.359 --> 02:11:15.220]  So what they are is they're sociopaths
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:23.703]  That have no moral compass, but they know we have them, so they project it out because that gets power over us.
[02:11:23.703 --> 02:11:28.546]  And so what you're saying is absolutely true, that they actually like disgusting things.
[02:11:28.546 --> 02:11:33.328]  They like two-year-olds being taught they're really a girl or a boy and being screwed up.
[02:11:33.328 --> 02:11:42.031]  They like child pornography as vice, and the New York Times, and all these other things promote.
[02:11:42.031 --> 02:11:43.492]  These really are evil people.
[02:11:44.269 --> 02:11:51.977]  Two years ago, maybe even longer, I'm losing track of time, I posted a video where I interviewed people in the San Diego boardwalk about incest.
[02:11:51.977 --> 02:11:59.425]  And whether or not they thought that incest was disgusting or wrong, as long as it was between two adults.
[02:11:59.425 --> 02:12:04.790]  Whether that be a brother and a sister, or a father and his daughter, as long as she was 18 years old.
[02:12:06.171 --> 02:12:10.254]  And many of the people here in San Diego said that that was totally fine.
[02:12:10.254 --> 02:12:20.983]  And they saw no difference between an incestuous relationship between an 18-year-old girl or woman and her father or a brother and a sister.
[02:12:20.983 --> 02:12:28.849]  And they said that that's totally no different than a consenting heterosexual couple or consenting LGBT couple.
[02:12:29.409 --> 02:12:33.392]  Because they, their minds are literally defective.
[02:12:33.392 --> 02:12:37.174]  You can watch it, it's on YouTube and people were stunned when it first came out.
[02:12:37.174 --> 02:12:45.060]  And now we're actually seeing the LGBT community embracing incest as part of their community.
[02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:50.303]  And some of them are calling it GSA, genetically sexually attracted couples.
[02:12:50.303 --> 02:12:57.208]  We're seeing stories in the news of couples that are fathers and daughters and sons and their mothers.
[02:12:58.048 --> 02:13:08.575]  And the leftists, the far left now, they see no difference between that and a normal heterosexual couple and LGBT couple.
[02:13:08.575 --> 02:13:10.957]  And years ago people would joke, well what's next?
[02:13:10.957 --> 02:13:12.137]  Is it incest?
[02:13:12.137 --> 02:13:14.719]  And unfortunately that's what is next.
[02:13:14.719 --> 02:13:15.940]  You can't make this up.
[02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:25.266]  It is horrifying and that's why in my book, Liberalism, Find a Care, I've been tracking this for so long and even for people that have been following the news pretty closely, it's far worse than you could possibly imagine.
[02:13:25.746 --> 02:13:35.793]  And what I've been seeing for years, and documenting and assessing and compiling and tracking the trends, now we're starting to see it bubble up over the surface.
[02:13:35.793 --> 02:13:44.138]  Because NBC News is now highlighting couples who are raising their children gender neutral to the they-bees.
[02:13:44.138 --> 02:13:45.099]  It's not a boy or a girl.
[02:13:45.259 --> 02:13:53.943]  In Texas, they're taking people's children away if the school convinces a six-year-old to start chemical castration, and the parents say, no, the kid's taken away.
[02:13:53.943 --> 02:13:56.204]  And as you said, we would always say, what's next?
[02:13:56.204 --> 02:13:58.244]  Incest, bestiality, pedophilia?
[02:13:58.244 --> 02:14:01.206]  It's all being promoted now.
[02:14:01.206 --> 02:14:03.246]  It's all being pushed.
[02:14:03.246 --> 02:14:04.287]  It's unbelievable.
[02:14:04.287 --> 02:14:06.508]  And you can't swing a stick.
[02:14:07.512 --> 02:14:14.355]  In a major city now, and not find where two-year-olds, three-year-olds, five-year-olds are being confused and jacked with.
[02:14:14.355 --> 02:14:20.877]  And the left saying, oh, they're allowed to be of age now to decide they want to be sterilized.
[02:14:20.877 --> 02:14:22.358]  No, that's called child abuse.
[02:14:22.358 --> 02:14:23.318]  This is so insane.
[02:14:24.787 --> 02:14:24.887]  Yes.
[02:14:39.707 --> 02:14:42.369]  Let's be clear, it was two year olds walking up
[02:14:58.658 --> 02:15:03.862]  Putting money in g-strings of obese men wearing wigs who are shaking their asses in children's faces.
[02:15:03.862 --> 02:15:05.344]  We've had TV station complaints.
[02:15:05.344 --> 02:15:07.305]  We will not even show the full footage here.
[02:15:07.305 --> 02:15:14.211]  Men, totally naked except for glitter on their large, large genitals, hugging small children.
[02:15:16.078 --> 02:15:38.222]  Parents would have been arrested for child abuse but now you can't even criticize it even mildly which is why I had to put it into the book because I gotta be careful if I just use the wrong word on a YouTube video or maybe even the wrong tone of voice then I'll get disappeared down the memory hole as Tim Cook now is saying that just people who are divisive aren't supposed to be allowed to have the internet now so it's not even just
[02:15:38.642 --> 02:15:42.286]  Hateful or violent people.
[02:15:42.286 --> 02:15:43.527]  It's divisive.
[02:15:43.527 --> 02:15:45.409]  If you're just a divisive person.
[02:15:45.409 --> 02:15:48.132]  Now, I'm sorry, Tim, but politics are divisive.
[02:15:48.132 --> 02:15:49.093]  Life is divisive.
[02:15:49.093 --> 02:15:49.834]  People have different ideas.
[02:15:49.834 --> 02:15:50.254]  Well, that's right.
[02:15:50.254 --> 02:15:54.399]  Bottom line, give us your children or we'll shut you off, mark you in the mace, and starve you to death.
[02:15:56.866 --> 02:16:00.029]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[02:16:00.029 --> 02:16:04.274]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[02:16:04.274 --> 02:16:05.675]  The bug assault.
[02:16:05.675 --> 02:16:10.360]  A miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[02:16:11.309 --> 02:16:11.909]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:11.909 --> 02:16:15.451]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:15.451 --> 02:16:16.491]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:16.491 --> 02:16:18.832]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:34.958 --> 02:16:40.523]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:19:06.769 --> 02:19:08.830]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:11.711]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.

[02:19:13.192 --> 02:19:20.015]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.

[02:19:48.637 --> 02:19:51.780]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:59.269]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:19:59.269 --> 02:20:05.636]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:05.636 --> 02:20:10.522]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[02:20:12.125 --> 02:20:18.887]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[02:20:18.887 --> 02:20:20.087]  Lord behold it to scum!
[02:20:20.087 --> 02:20:20.807]  Russian scum!
[02:20:20.807 --> 02:20:21.208]  Listen.
[02:20:21.208 --> 02:20:21.968]  Please listen.
[02:20:21.968 --> 02:20:24.488]  If you don't, if you won't,
[02:20:34.258 --> 02:20:40.059]  If you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[02:20:40.059 --> 02:20:44.180]  The function of all life is survival.
[02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:44.360]  Sleep.
[02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:46.181]  Sleep.
[02:20:46.181 --> 02:20:47.941]  Sleep.
[02:20:47.941 --> 02:20:49.862]  Oh my God!
[02:20:49.862 --> 02:20:50.582]  Oh my God!
[02:20:50.582 --> 02:20:51.042]  Oh my God!
[02:20:51.042 --> 02:20:51.842]  Lock the door!
[02:20:51.842 --> 02:20:52.302]  Lock the door!
[02:20:52.302 --> 02:20:53.222]  They're coming!
[02:20:53.222 --> 02:20:54.343]  They're coming!
[02:20:54.343 --> 02:20:55.063]  Help!
[02:20:55.063 --> 02:20:55.803]  Help!
[02:20:55.803 --> 02:20:56.743]  They're coming!
[02:20:56.743 --> 02:20:57.463]  They're coming!
[02:20:57.463 --> 02:20:57.964]  Listen to me!
[02:20:57.964 --> 02:20:58.284]  Listen!
[02:20:58.284 --> 02:20:58.704]  Oh my God!
[02:21:00.831 --> 02:21:01.431]  Please!
[02:21:01.431 --> 02:21:02.052]  Please!
[02:21:02.052 --> 02:21:03.612]  Your necks are in danger!
[02:21:03.612 --> 02:21:04.513]  Please listen to me!
[02:21:04.513 --> 02:21:05.833]  It's something terrible!
[02:21:05.833 --> 02:21:06.574]  Please!
[02:21:06.574 --> 02:21:08.394]  Your necks are in the air!
[02:21:08.394 --> 02:21:11.076]  They're already here!
[02:21:11.076 --> 02:21:11.256]  Help!
[02:21:11.256 --> 02:21:11.676]  Your necks!
[02:21:11.676 --> 02:21:12.276]  They're coming!
[02:21:12.276 --> 02:21:13.377]  They're coming!
[02:21:13.377 --> 02:21:14.197]  Sleep.
[02:21:14.197 --> 02:21:15.338]  The seed is planted.
[02:21:15.338 --> 02:21:17.278]  Sleep.
[02:21:17.278 --> 02:21:18.239]  Sleep.
[02:21:18.239 --> 02:21:19.599]  Terror grows.
[02:21:19.599 --> 02:21:19.840]  Sleep.
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:21.720]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:23.101]  I'll get you when you sleep!
[02:21:23.101 --> 02:21:24.822]  Sit up!
[02:21:24.822 --> 02:21:27.003]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[02:21:28.457 --> 02:21:30.678]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[02:21:30.678 --> 02:21:32.098]  Is it contagious?
[02:21:32.098 --> 02:21:32.858]  Mom!
[02:21:32.858 --> 02:21:34.058]  Brianna, hold me!
[02:21:34.058 --> 02:21:35.099]  It looked right at me.
[02:21:35.099 --> 02:21:36.219]  You need to get out!
[02:21:36.219 --> 02:21:37.659]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[02:21:37.659 --> 02:21:40.400]  We're not human.
[02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:43.601]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[02:21:43.601 --> 02:21:45.241]  We're being cornered!
[02:21:45.241 --> 02:21:49.042]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[02:21:49.042 --> 02:21:49.542]  Hey, Barry.
[02:22:15.794 --> 02:22:20.798]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:22:20.798 --> 02:22:22.660]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:24.501]  And Mark Dice is riding a shotgun with us.
[02:22:24.501 --> 02:22:25.422]  New book.
[02:22:25.422 --> 02:22:26.463]  He's a best-selling author.
[02:22:26.463 --> 02:22:27.344]  Liberalism, Find a Cure.
[02:22:27.344 --> 02:22:30.206]  Everybody should get it at InfoWarsTore.com or MarkDice.com.
[02:22:30.206 --> 02:22:31.807]  Get it at Amazon.
[02:22:31.807 --> 02:22:33.088]  He makes no money, I make no money.
[02:22:33.088 --> 02:22:34.570]  Doesn't help fund us, but whatever.
[02:22:34.570 --> 02:22:35.891]  The book gets out.
[02:22:35.891 --> 02:22:36.691]  Mark, just putting book in.
[02:22:36.691 --> 02:22:37.892]  He says, I want to get into the Oscars.
[02:22:37.892 --> 02:22:38.913]  I want to get into Trump.
[02:22:38.913 --> 02:22:42.716]  I want to get into China with you and have you really cover the waterfront here.
[02:22:42.716 --> 02:22:43.417]  But finishing up,
[02:22:44.795 --> 02:22:45.955]  It's all over.
[02:22:45.955 --> 02:22:51.016]  Like people all over Austin are telling their young boys they're a girl or girls they're a boy.
[02:22:51.016 --> 02:22:52.117]  It's a cult.
[02:22:52.117 --> 02:22:53.837]  They're sexualizing them.
[02:22:53.837 --> 02:22:56.338]  It's all over the news that pedophilia is good suddenly.
[02:22:56.338 --> 02:22:59.538]  I mean, this is really the final frontier.
[02:22:59.538 --> 02:23:08.120]  If we'll put up with that, teachers in the US are being fired and they refuse to use weird cult, you know, Xenu pronouns.
[02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:09.121]  Where does this end?
[02:23:09.121 --> 02:23:11.021]  I mean, obviously it's about depopulation.
[02:23:11.021 --> 02:23:12.061]  Where is it going?
[02:23:12.061 --> 02:23:14.402]  As they celebrate the total fall of culture.
[02:23:15.546 --> 02:23:22.151]  Yeah, the culture is cancerous and it's almost too late to even interact with certain segments of it or to have your kids in public schools.
[02:23:22.151 --> 02:23:25.573]  You're going to have to put them in private schools to avoid this madness.
[02:23:25.573 --> 02:23:31.377]  Planned Parenthood just tweeted out last night an article by someone who said, well, the future is not female.
[02:23:31.377 --> 02:23:32.558]  That's a big slogan of theirs.
[02:23:32.558 --> 02:23:33.678]  You know, the future is female.
[02:23:33.678 --> 02:23:35.440]  The future is female, not equality.
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:36.881]  It's they want to dominate, of course.
[02:23:36.881 --> 02:23:40.223]  But now that's still not good enough because that's offensive.
[02:23:40.803 --> 02:23:56.129]  Now the future they say is non-binary and they're upset about the TERFs, the transgender exclusionary feminists who are fighting for feminism but they don't go along with this transgender choose your own gender identity.
[02:23:56.129 --> 02:24:00.191]  Like the women all getting famous feminists are being banned off Twitter because they say no men are not women.
[02:24:00.791 --> 02:24:09.974]  The sky is blue, 2 plus 2 equals 4, they're banned too because they're making way for, you wrote about this in some of your books, this whole transhuman microchip everything.
[02:24:09.974 --> 02:24:13.535]  We're going to have to say clones are real, we're going to have to give rights to robots.
[02:24:13.535 --> 02:24:22.018]  They're getting us ready just saying a man doesn't have a uterus, but he doesn't have a cervix, but you'll go to jail, you'll be fired if he comes in and wants a pap smear.
[02:24:22.984 --> 02:24:45.761]  Four years ago now was when the Mozilla CEO, the creator of the Firefox browser software, was fired, pushed out of his job, the creator and CEO of the company, because it was discovered that six years earlier, he donated like a thousand dollars of his own personal money to Proposition 8 in California, which would have defined marriage as just between a man and a woman.
[02:24:46.301 --> 02:24:53.603]  And so, six years later, they discovered that he did that, pushed him out of his job for simply supporting marriage between a man and a woman.
[02:24:53.603 --> 02:24:59.485]  We're getting to the point where if you just simply say, marriage is between a man and a woman, I don't care what the Supreme Court says.
[02:24:59.485 --> 02:25:02.386]  They could say two plus two equals five, it doesn't make it so.
[02:25:02.386 --> 02:25:04.287]  I'm not going to use that term.
[02:25:05.107 --> 02:25:09.270]  Uh, then you're going to be seen as just as bad as someone who's a member of the KKK.
[02:25:09.270 --> 02:25:13.353]  So we're almost at the edge of the cliff of our culture.
[02:25:13.353 --> 02:25:18.796]  And if we don't stop this madness, the entire human race is going to be affected forever.
[02:25:18.796 --> 02:25:24.540]  There's going to be small remnants of the normal people, the Christians, those who won't go along with this.
[02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:25.680]  It's getting so insane.
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:26.241]  We saw
[02:25:27.021 --> 02:25:35.586]  They were eating their own yesterday, comedian Kevin Hart, who was chosen to host the Oscars because the Oscars were previously criticized for being too white.
[02:25:35.586 --> 02:25:37.907]  Remember the hashtag, OscarsSoWhite.
[02:25:37.907 --> 02:25:48.533]  So they found the social justice warrior, affirmative action hire, Kevin Hart, to host, but then somebody went and bugged through his previous tweets from almost a decade ago.
[02:25:49.193 --> 02:25:55.356]  And he was making some jokes about some gay people and how he didn't want to have a gay son and a whole bit about it.
[02:25:55.356 --> 02:25:57.498]  And so now they said that that's hateful.
[02:25:57.498 --> 02:26:01.059]  And to see the evolution of his downfall was quite fascinating.
[02:26:01.059 --> 02:26:02.420]  It happened very, very quick.
[02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:06.042]  First, he posted on his Instagram, you know, these people need to get a life.
[02:26:06.042 --> 02:26:16.728]  You know, if you're nitpicking tweets from 10 years ago and you can't understand that people grow and people change and don't feed the trolls and these people are finding things to get offensive about, it's like, yeah, whatever.
[02:26:17.328 --> 02:26:35.594]  And then, maybe an hour later, he got the call from the handlers and they said, hey, if you don't apologize and have a scripted, pre-planned, in-depth apology and probably go do some community service or invite some LGBT folks over for Christmas dinner, then you're out.
[02:26:35.594 --> 02:26:39.135]  And to his credit, at first, he said, I'm not going to apologize.
[02:26:39.235 --> 02:26:39.776]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:26:54.472 --> 02:27:00.260]  And then he got the talk from the rest of his team and then came the detailed, I'm terribly sorry.
[02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:03.284]  I will, you know, I make amends.
[02:27:03.284 --> 02:27:04.245]  I am evolving.
[02:27:04.245 --> 02:27:08.490]  And so at first, it looked like he was standing up to the bullies and saying, hey, you know what?
[02:27:08.490 --> 02:27:09.652]  You don't want to host the Oscars.
[02:27:10.499 --> 02:27:12.981]  That's fine, you know, I don't need to do that.
[02:27:12.981 --> 02:27:14.983]  And then came the apology.
[02:27:14.983 --> 02:27:16.484]  It's just incredible.
[02:27:16.484 --> 02:27:24.150]  So now, the Oscars and Grammys, all these award shows are just Hollywood propaganda, constantly pushing the far left agenda.
[02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:30.195]  So now, it's going to be interesting to see, because of this controversy, they're going to inject even more of that into the show.
[02:27:30.195 --> 02:27:31.136]  But let me ask this question.
[02:27:31.136 --> 02:27:33.118]  We're going to come back and get more into this.
[02:27:35.063 --> 02:27:37.724]  Record low viewers to all these horrible Hollywood shows.
[02:27:37.724 --> 02:27:38.625]  All of it's falling apart.
[02:27:38.625 --> 02:27:39.725]  They're killing themselves.
[02:27:39.725 --> 02:27:42.567]  The NFL, 40% less viewers than three years ago.
[02:27:42.567 --> 02:27:49.190]  So the good news is America and the world's turning against it, but they can't stop because it's their total agenda.
[02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:55.253]  And it'd be like if I turned into TV and they were trying to teach my five-year-old about heterosexual sex, I'd say, you're a pedophile.
[02:27:55.253 --> 02:27:58.695]  But because it's LBGTP, it's supposedly okay.
[02:27:58.695 --> 02:28:00.216]  So we're going to break all this down.
[02:28:00.216 --> 02:28:01.837]  The new book is at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:28:03.291 --> 02:28:04.272]  Needs to be a best-seller.
[02:28:04.272 --> 02:28:06.333]  In fact, I know it was number one political book.
[02:28:06.333 --> 02:28:07.454]  What did it go to on Amazon?
[02:28:07.454 --> 02:28:09.456]  Liberalism, find a cure, Mark.
[02:28:09.456 --> 02:28:16.822]  It was number 15 on Amazon.com out of all books, not just a specific category, the day that it came out.
[02:28:16.822 --> 02:28:23.467]  Interestingly, the same ceiling that my last book last year, The True Story of Fake News, hit as well.
[02:28:23.467 --> 02:28:25.769]  And that's with no reviews.
[02:28:25.769 --> 02:28:25.969]  I did
[02:28:26.149 --> 02:28:27.269]  Oh, it's like the stock market.
[02:28:27.269 --> 02:28:29.210]  It's got all these pre-placed computer deals.
[02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:30.610]  The point is, everybody should get the book.
[02:28:30.610 --> 02:28:32.070]  Great job, people that did.
[02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:33.370]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:28:33.370 --> 02:28:34.591]  Liberalism, find a cure.
[02:28:34.591 --> 02:28:38.591]  Give it to members of your family that are on the fence and say, listen, it may not be too late for you.
[02:28:38.591 --> 02:28:40.452]  Do you really want to be part of this?
[02:28:40.452 --> 02:28:41.932]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:28:41.932 --> 02:28:47.093]  We'll be right back with Mark Dice and a special message from Tim Cook on the other side.
[02:28:47.093 --> 02:28:48.253]  Newswars.com.
[02:28:48.253 --> 02:28:49.013]  Infowars.com.
[02:28:49.013 --> 02:28:51.254]  Without you spreading the links, they'll win.
[02:28:51.254 --> 02:28:52.314]  You spread them, we win.
[02:28:52.314 --> 02:28:52.674]  Stay with us.
[02:28:55.543 --> 02:28:56.743]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.743 --> 02:29:00.665]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.665 --> 02:29:02.206]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:02.206 --> 02:29:05.167]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:05.167 --> 02:29:10.729]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:10.729 --> 02:29:11.929]  I can help you, too.
[02:29:11.929 --> 02:29:14.870]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:17.091]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:29:17.091 --> 02:29:21.533]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:29:21.533 --> 02:29:23.814]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:29:25.174 --> 02:29:31.776]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the purest for you and your family.
[02:29:31.776 --> 02:29:35.618]  For over 14 years, thousands have depended on Berkey Clean Water.
[02:29:35.618 --> 02:29:42.440]  The Berkey guy has you covered at home, work, and on the go with water filtration systems of every size for every budget.

[02:29:56.309 --> 02:30:04.697]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:30:04.697 --> 02:30:06.158]  Believe me, I know.
[02:30:06.158 --> 02:30:10.863]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:10.863 --> 02:30:13.946]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:30:14.426 --> 02:30:16.088]  I still have that energy.
[02:30:16.088 --> 02:30:36.270]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:40.754]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:30:40.754 --> 02:30:44.418]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:30:44.418 --> 02:30:49.424]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:30:49.424 --> 02:30:52.147]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:30:52.147 --> 02:30:55.010]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:56.371 --> 02:31:00.614]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:31:00.614 --> 02:31:04.096]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:31:04.096 --> 02:31:05.858]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:31:05.858 --> 02:31:09.260]  They know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our products.
[02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:15.904]  They just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:31:15.904 --> 02:31:20.988]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[02:31:21.328 --> 02:31:27.433]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:31:27.433 --> 02:31:30.416]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:31:30.416 --> 02:31:31.517]  I want to keep going.
[02:31:31.517 --> 02:31:35.340]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:31:35.340 --> 02:31:37.361]  I want to push all the way.
[02:31:37.361 --> 02:31:38.662]  I've committed to do that.
[02:31:38.662 --> 02:31:39.723]  I've prayed for that.
[02:31:39.723 --> 02:31:41.385]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:31:41.385 --> 02:31:43.807]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:31:44.307 --> 02:31:45.428]  I will never falter.
[02:31:45.428 --> 02:31:47.949]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:31:47.949 --> 02:31:48.889]  I physically will.
[02:31:48.889 --> 02:31:57.593]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWars4.com, to give you my absolute, total commitment.
[02:31:57.593 --> 02:32:01.475]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:32:03.228 --> 02:32:06.350]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:32:06.350 --> 02:32:09.011]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:32:09.011 --> 02:32:13.313]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:32:13.313 --> 02:32:20.677]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:32:20.677 --> 02:32:23.238]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[02:32:26.667 --> 02:32:28.888]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:32:28.888 --> 02:32:31.930]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[02:32:31.930 --> 02:32:43.837]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:32:43.837 --> 02:32:45.397]  It's the David Knight Show!
[02:32:45.397 --> 02:32:49.099]  Never miss your show, any day.
[02:32:49.099 --> 02:32:50.040]  I mean, what?
[02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:52.221]  I mean, never!
[02:32:52.221 --> 02:32:55.223]  At infords.com forward slash show.
[02:32:59.304 --> 02:33:06.410]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:06.410 --> 02:33:09.313]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[02:33:09.313 --> 02:33:11.134]  I'm too weak.
[02:33:11.134 --> 02:33:12.415]  Oh, don't kill me.
[02:33:12.415 --> 02:33:17.680]  Please.
[02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:24.605]  At Apple, we believe that technology needs to have a clear point of view on the challenge.
[02:33:24.605 --> 02:33:27.368]  That's why we should only have one message.
[02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:34.782]  You have no place on our platform.
[02:33:34.782 --> 02:33:36.622]  We have no time here.
[02:33:36.622 --> 02:33:41.624]  And Apple, we are not afraid to say that our value drives our curation.
[02:33:41.624 --> 02:33:43.804]  The secret's on a universe!
[02:33:43.804 --> 02:33:45.165]  It's all there!
[02:33:45.165 --> 02:33:47.285]  You have no place on our platform.
[02:33:47.285 --> 02:33:50.666]  Life is fiery with its beauty!
[02:33:50.666 --> 02:33:54.807]  You have no place... Unlock your inner potential!
[02:33:54.807 --> 02:33:55.828]  You have no time here.
[02:33:55.828 --> 02:33:56.988]  Defeat the global threat!
[02:33:59.818 --> 02:34:04.204]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[02:34:29.858 --> 02:34:39.322]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[02:34:39.322 --> 02:34:49.967]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[02:34:49.967 --> 02:34:56.430]  I'm gonna say something here, reintroducing Mark Dice, wrestling author here on air.
[02:34:56.430 --> 02:34:57.011]  Leave all hurt.
[02:34:57.944 --> 02:35:02.886]  But we're not talking to the general listener that's smarter than I am in many cases on different topics.
[02:35:02.886 --> 02:35:08.069]  We're all smarter than each other on some topics about our own personal lives.
[02:35:08.069 --> 02:35:16.253]  But when it comes to different areas like being a diesel mechanic or being a brain surgeon or being a school teacher, you're probably smarter than I am.
[02:35:16.253 --> 02:35:20.255]  But when it comes to studying geopolitics, I'm pretty damn smart.
[02:35:20.255 --> 02:35:25.317]  Because I've done some real studying and then looked at history and seen what's accurate and what isn't.
[02:35:25.317 --> 02:35:26.378]  And here's the big announcement.
[02:35:28.834 --> 02:35:51.486]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, and different political systems, but because I've studied so much history, and I've studied so many white papers from the real establishment, that we really knew what their program was for world government, the attack on the family, and the transgender movement, and the open borders, and the radical Islam invasion, and the caliphate, and it sounded crazy!
[02:35:51.486 --> 02:35:53.227]  Because why would you wreck something good?
[02:35:55.202 --> 02:36:09.532]  They fundamentally want to control everything and women and men together with children and futures who are actually egalitarian and classically liberal and open, that creates so much wealth and power that you can't have an authoritarian system.
[02:36:09.532 --> 02:36:16.417]  So they use our classical liberalism with leftist evil, which means Luciferian, left hand path, against us.
[02:36:16.417 --> 02:36:20.400]  The only thing similar between leftist and liberal is the L, nothing else.
[02:36:22.125 --> 02:36:23.586]  World government's out in the open.
[02:36:23.586 --> 02:36:25.287]  Global carbon tax is out in the open.
[02:36:25.287 --> 02:36:27.869]  The attack on the family's out in the open.
[02:36:27.869 --> 02:36:29.030]  Mark Dice, what is it like?
[02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:32.132]  Because you've written, I don't know, 20-something books, I forget.
[02:36:32.132 --> 02:36:36.796]  You've republished famous books, written 200 years ago on the subject.
[02:36:36.796 --> 02:36:41.939]  When I saw Americana and free market and the Renaissance and everything, I knew that was reality.
[02:36:41.939 --> 02:36:43.881]  I knew the globalists were fighting that, so I thought,
[02:36:45.509 --> 02:37:01.977]  If we promote already the most powerful, successful, pro-human thing that ever existed, I believe once globalism fully emerges with all its tyranny and all its oppression and all of its forced austerity, that people will want the 1776, not the 1984.
[02:37:01.977 --> 02:37:03.817]  We've proven that's true all over the world.
[02:37:03.817 --> 02:37:04.898]  So here's the juxtapose.
[02:37:04.898 --> 02:37:11.081]  What is it like, because you've been involved politically and we've known each other like 16 years, you've been involved like 18 years, we're getting old here.
[02:37:12.222 --> 02:37:16.204]  You're going to college, you know, for your degree in media analysis then.
[02:37:16.204 --> 02:37:20.587]  What is it like to, A, be right, but then to be attacked more than ever?
[02:37:20.587 --> 02:37:28.551]  And then what do you think comes out of this with nationalists winning everywhere and populists winning, but the globalists still have the money and the media pressing the attack?
[02:37:28.551 --> 02:37:30.172]  It's so explosive.
[02:37:30.172 --> 02:37:31.253]  What would you call this time?
[02:37:32.774 --> 02:37:34.595]  It's the most exciting time of my life.
[02:37:34.595 --> 02:37:41.039]  It's one of the most critical points in world history for freedom because we've seen their plans, you've seen their plans.
[02:37:41.039 --> 02:37:51.864]  In 2010, I wrote a book titled The New World or Facts and Fiction and a lot of the stuff that we're talking about and we're experiencing now was sort of on the forefront or coming in the future.
[02:37:51.864 --> 02:37:54.626]  Things that the globalists were planning.
[02:37:54.626 --> 02:37:57.928]  It was on the horizon and now it's run us over.
[02:37:57.928 --> 02:37:59.869]  Now it's here and it's not just here.
[02:37:59.869 --> 02:38:01.970]  I mean we're in the middle of it and
[02:38:02.717 --> 02:38:09.179]  There's a lot more people who support us than our vocal online, because a lot of people just don't want to get involved with social media.
[02:38:09.179 --> 02:38:12.320]  They don't want to have their tweets from 10 years ago come back to haunt them.
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:14.241]  They don't want to be glued to their phone.
[02:38:14.241 --> 02:38:18.522]  They don't want to be stuck in that digital gulag.
[02:38:18.522 --> 02:38:24.544]  So they're talking at the dinner table, they're talking at the water cooler, they're supporting what it is that we're doing.
[02:38:24.544 --> 02:38:32.006]  But it's very scary to see Tim Cook, the CEO of the most powerful, wealthy corporation ever in the history of the planet,
[02:38:32.686 --> 02:38:41.269]  Saying that if somebody is just divisive now, that you have no place on their platform, a guy who... And you can divide... They're talking about me.
[02:38:41.269 --> 02:38:47.431]  They're saying anyone that divides us from the big mothership's orders is gone.
[02:38:48.399 --> 02:38:54.885]  Now he was accepting an award for, you know, fighting hatred from the ADL, which is what that clip was that you played.
[02:38:54.885 --> 02:39:01.831]  And the ADL also is calling for the elimination of celebration of Mother's Day and Father's Day.
[02:39:01.831 --> 02:39:08.317]  So it's sort of more from an organization that was fighting anti-Semitism to this social justice warrior.
[02:39:08.317 --> 02:39:08.477]  Mothers?
[02:39:08.477 --> 02:39:09.018]  Oh, I forgot!
[02:39:09.399 --> 02:39:11.323]  They're for drag time tots.
[02:39:11.323 --> 02:39:15.934]  If you don't want your two-year-old being taught they're really another sex, the ADL says you're a Nazi.
[02:39:15.934 --> 02:39:17.237]  Well then screw you, man!
[02:39:17.237 --> 02:39:18.900]  What a cult of evil!
[02:39:20.256 --> 02:39:35.106]  They have their guide, guide for schools on their website, where they say that they recommend public schools to not celebrate Mother's Day and Father's Day anymore because that's divisive, not using the terms to all of the... I mean, what a cult!
[02:39:35.106 --> 02:39:40.990]  Mother and Father, the flag's bad, schools everywhere banning Christmas, now they're banning red and green.
[02:39:40.990 --> 02:39:46.454]  This is just a cult saying we control all knowledge, you come to us to decide what language you can use.
[02:39:46.454 --> 02:39:48.555]  What an incredible group of authoritarians!
[02:39:48.555 --> 02:39:50.016]  What a group of monsters, Mark!
[02:39:50.897 --> 02:40:08.175]  And, you know, some of the great thinkers in the past have put these ideas and warnings into science fiction, like George Orwell in 1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, and these people like Tim Cook are actually worse than the party in Big Brother.
[02:40:08.175 --> 02:40:12.660]  And Orwell warned us in 1984, which was published, what, like 60 years ago?
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:16.542]  That the government wanted to break up the family.
[02:40:16.542 --> 02:40:19.163]  This is in the book, obviously, which is Paralleling Reality.
[02:40:19.163 --> 02:40:22.425]  He was a high-level socialist communist.
[02:40:22.425 --> 02:40:25.347]  The character, Winston Smith, he wrote the non-fiction book.
[02:40:25.347 --> 02:40:26.528]  He wrote the book a year later.
[02:40:26.528 --> 02:40:27.308]  He wrote it in 1947.
[02:40:27.308 --> 02:40:29.589]  It came out in 1948.
[02:40:29.589 --> 02:40:33.312]  He believed in the ideas of communism to empower people, and he was high-level.
[02:40:33.312 --> 02:40:37.374]  When they said, no, we're just going to destroy everything for evil's sake, he flipped out.
[02:40:38.527 --> 02:40:58.458]  Well, there's a line in 1984 where Winston is amusing a lot about how the government is breaking up the family so that nobody has allegiance to each other or to any centralized authority or any governing body or any group that's going to instill morality and to have a support structure.
[02:40:58.458 --> 02:40:59.779]  Well, there's a sense of being.
[02:40:59.779 --> 02:41:00.960]  They don't want any past.
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:02.461]  They're at war with history.
[02:41:02.461 --> 02:41:04.242]  They're at war with you having any roots.
[02:41:05.382 --> 02:41:08.383]  So that people, of course, will look to the government as God.
[02:41:08.383 --> 02:41:09.983]  The government replaces God.
[02:41:09.983 --> 02:41:27.806]  And the military-industrial complex is a police arm of that, but the Hollywood-industrial complex is an extension of that power, because they're the ones which shape the culture, which Andrew Breitbart so cleverly said, the politics is downstream from the culture.
[02:41:27.806 --> 02:41:30.667]  And so Hollywood propaganda-entertainment complex
[02:41:31.367 --> 02:41:35.910]  Is constantly poisoning the minds of the masses of the kids.
[02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:39.672]  Every award show, every major television series.
[02:41:39.672 --> 02:41:42.314]  No, I agree, but there's a major breaking from it.
[02:41:42.314 --> 02:41:43.554]  So they've intensified it.
[02:41:43.554 --> 02:41:44.475]  How do you see that going?
[02:41:46.238 --> 02:41:56.629]  They're losing their audience, but unfortunately, the audience is fragmenting, and so they're co-opting a lot of YouTube channels now, they're co-opting a lot of alternative, independent websites.
[02:41:56.629 --> 02:41:58.390]  We are seeing them fail.
[02:41:58.390 --> 02:42:06.298]  We're seeing a lot of the so-called new media sites on the internet, like... Oh, I've seen, like, top podcasters that I know have literally joined Darth Vader.
[02:42:06.298 --> 02:42:08.040]  They've just, they've literally joined it.
[02:42:08.911 --> 02:42:13.052]  BuzzFeed is literally asking for donations now, on the bottom of their article.
[02:42:13.052 --> 02:42:14.173]  That's my next question.
[02:42:14.173 --> 02:42:15.953]  My God, you're always on target.
[02:42:15.953 --> 02:42:17.654]  Mark Dice, we didn't pre-talk about this.
[02:42:17.654 --> 02:42:19.194]  I wanted to next hit.
[02:42:19.194 --> 02:42:30.558]  BuzzFeed, Weekly Standard, all the neocontinental scripts are far beyond bankrupt and now their big banker owners aren't financing them because we've all been censored off the web, they say.
[02:42:30.558 --> 02:42:32.359]  So why are you even needed?
[02:42:32.359 --> 02:42:33.159]  What idiots?
[02:42:33.599 --> 02:42:36.141]  We'll talk about that with Mark Dice and what's coming next.
[02:42:36.141 --> 02:42:38.223]  His book, already a bestseller.
[02:42:38.223 --> 02:42:39.885]  Number 15 on Amazon total.
[02:42:39.885 --> 02:42:41.306]  Get it at Infowarestore.com.

[02:43:12.490 --> 02:43:17.991]  The Real Red Pill Plus is an all-new version of the powerhouse preglanone product.
[02:43:17.991 --> 02:43:25.693]  It features the same great formula that supports your heart, brain, healthy aging process, with an all-new natural caffeine boost included.
[02:43:26.133 --> 02:43:32.578]  A powerful preglanone base, the Real Red Pill, has quickly become one of our fellow InfoWarriors' favorite products.

[02:43:42.946 --> 02:43:47.669]  It's got all the great stuff that Real Red Pill has, but it's also got the boost in it.

[02:43:54.875 --> 02:44:04.158]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:44:04.158 --> 02:44:07.039]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:44:07.039 --> 02:44:13.061]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:44:13.741 --> 02:44:20.008]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:44:20.008 --> 02:44:26.295]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:44:26.295 --> 02:44:33.343]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:44:33.343 --> 02:44:33.543]  But!
[02:44:34.364 --> 02:44:47.397]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:44:47.397 --> 02:44:51.661]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:44:51.661 --> 02:44:54.364]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[02:44:56.095 --> 02:45:03.982]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.
[02:45:03.982 --> 02:45:13.210]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before, as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[02:45:13.210 --> 02:45:20.856]  So get great products and help fund the InfoWars right now with the 12 Days of Christmas that is special amongst a group of incredible sales.
[02:45:20.996 --> 02:45:21.116]  Yes.
[02:45:37.184 --> 02:45:42.329]  24 hour only special at Infowarstore.com is the powerful silver bullet.
[02:45:42.329 --> 02:45:43.490]  Always a great deal.
[02:45:43.490 --> 02:45:45.792]  It's now 60% off.
[02:45:45.792 --> 02:45:47.934]  And knockout sleep support.
[02:45:47.934 --> 02:45:48.775]  Now 60% off.
[02:45:48.775 --> 02:45:53.319]  I want to thank you all again for making the entire Infowar possible.
[02:45:53.319 --> 02:45:55.260]  Again, you are the resistance.
[02:45:56.121 --> 02:46:00.245]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[02:46:00.245 --> 02:46:07.292]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[02:46:07.292 --> 02:46:12.136]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[02:46:12.136 --> 02:46:19.023]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced four-stage compact filtration system
[02:46:19.443 --> 02:46:25.467]  That will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[02:46:25.467 --> 02:46:34.593]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[02:46:35.033 --> 02:46:42.497]  With its broad-spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[02:46:42.497 --> 02:46:59.265]  Head to infowarsstore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today!
[02:46:59.265 --> 02:47:01.927]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:14.359 --> 02:47:29.605]  You know, it's not just in the BBC or Salon or the New York Times saying, stations are reviewing many Christmas songs and banning them like jingle bells.
[02:47:29.605 --> 02:47:32.386]  And, hey baby, it's cold outside.
[02:47:32.386 --> 02:47:34.946]  No, they're banning dozens of songs.
[02:47:34.946 --> 02:47:35.647]  They're evil.
[02:47:35.647 --> 02:47:39.028]  Everything must be projected on and made evil by the Thought Police.
[02:47:40.247 --> 02:47:48.588]  And if they can take good old-fashioned Christian Christmas music and get rid of it, well, that's another big victory for the Thought Police, because then, won't what you put up with.
[02:47:48.588 --> 02:47:51.009]  And oh, by the way, we're going to sexualize your five-year-old.
[02:47:51.009 --> 02:47:53.969]  We've got grown men dressed like women.
[02:47:53.969 --> 02:48:02.031]  Normally, they've got to get in ice cream trucks and offer candy and have a puppy to kidnap your kid, but now they're making grooming first contact, and it's no big deal.
[02:48:02.031 --> 02:48:04.691]  And they admit they are, so get used to it!
[02:48:04.691 --> 02:48:07.132]  Because you roll over, so you deserve it!
[02:48:07.132 --> 02:48:09.452]  Because big tech will come after your ass if you don't submit!
[02:48:10.563 --> 02:48:12.465]  Believe me, Tim Cook owns slave factories in China.
[02:48:12.465 --> 02:48:14.566]  He means business!
[02:48:14.566 --> 02:48:22.373]  So, I want to make this huge point, because Mark just alluded to it, Mark Dice, media commentator, best-selling author.
[02:48:22.373 --> 02:48:27.657]  I'm Alex Jones, you've just joined us here on RadioRTV.
[02:48:27.657 --> 02:48:28.638]  We know how this works.
[02:48:28.638 --> 02:48:40.007]  We know that with the Nazis or the Communists in Russia, or in the time of Rome, in every culture, the traitorous group that helps overthrow the good system,
[02:48:41.192 --> 02:48:44.973]  He's really looked down upon by those who are taking over.
[02:48:44.973 --> 02:48:56.695]  So the weird little traitors that were dishonorable, they're always long-knifed after the real establishment gets into power, like Enst, Rome, and the SA, or Hitler's brown shirts.
[02:48:56.695 --> 02:49:00.016]  And so the BuzzFeeds and the salons follow the orders, man.
[02:49:00.016 --> 02:49:00.596]  You'd see it.
[02:49:00.596 --> 02:49:02.877]  Pedophilia is good all the same day.
[02:49:02.877 --> 02:49:03.537]  Families are bad.
[02:49:06.499 --> 02:49:11.322]  And so they would come out and lie about us and put out outrageous lies, all in unison, hundreds of publications.
[02:49:11.322 --> 02:49:16.786]  And now that the big censorship happened and the deplatforming of InfoWars and NewsWars.
[02:49:16.786 --> 02:49:18.507]  But wait, we're still here though.
[02:49:18.507 --> 02:49:20.168]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:49:20.168 --> 02:49:22.909]  Our reach has been diminished, but our core audience is bigger than ever.
[02:49:22.909 --> 02:49:24.290]  But see, they didn't really have a core audience.
[02:49:24.290 --> 02:49:33.116]  They were just there to put up a talking point to create the illusion for corporations to think they had pressure on them to remove us to set the precedent to remove everybody.
[02:49:34.949 --> 02:49:36.930]  And so now it's all over the news.
[02:49:36.930 --> 02:49:37.190]  Why?
[02:49:37.190 --> 02:49:38.490]  The digital bubble's broken.
[02:49:38.490 --> 02:49:40.811]  We put these articles on screen.
[02:49:40.811 --> 02:49:42.592]  Everybody's for sale.
[02:49:42.592 --> 02:49:43.793]  They're all going bankrupt.
[02:49:43.793 --> 02:49:46.554]  The Weekly Standard, the neocon group shutting down.
[02:49:46.554 --> 02:49:56.458]  All of it because now George Soros doesn't need to spend two or three billion dollars like he did in the last cycle on that because he thinks he shut everybody down.
[02:49:56.458 --> 02:49:59.279]  Oh, and now you're not needed anymore.
[02:49:59.659 --> 02:50:10.789]  What fools, you know, even a sociopath that was long-term smart would think, you know, I exist as a leftist anti-American traitor because there's Alex Joneses out there fighting me for the Republic.
[02:50:10.789 --> 02:50:12.551]  You know, you think you're really Machiavelli, you're not.
[02:50:12.551 --> 02:50:14.452]  I don't do it from a Machiavellian perspective.
[02:50:14.452 --> 02:50:16.955]  You think I'm mentally ill, that I have a conscience, I tell the truth.
[02:50:16.955 --> 02:50:17.875]  No.
[02:50:17.875 --> 02:50:19.337]  We build civilization, you destroy it.
[02:50:19.337 --> 02:50:21.158]  But let me explain to you little sociopaths something.
[02:50:21.158 --> 02:50:24.481]  Though you're not inventive enough or smart enough to even get it.
[02:50:24.481 --> 02:50:25.963]  If you really want to be sociopathic,
[02:50:27.386 --> 02:50:28.366]  Really smart long-term.
[02:50:28.366 --> 02:50:33.268]  See, you wouldn't fight too hard and totally take out InfoWars because you'd want opposition.
[02:50:33.268 --> 02:50:37.709]  Once the opposition's gone with authoritarians, they have no respect for anybody, especially you.
[02:50:37.709 --> 02:50:39.810]  They remove you.
[02:50:39.810 --> 02:50:40.951]  Globalists respect me.
[02:50:40.951 --> 02:50:43.651]  They do not respect you.
[02:50:43.651 --> 02:50:45.392]  Because you don't have a soul, in their view.
[02:50:46.897 --> 02:50:53.061]  And so now thousands of digital sites that were front groups of the Democrats are all going bankrupt.
[02:50:53.061 --> 02:50:57.904]  They're doing monthly layoffs of 20% so within just a few months they're all, they're gone!
[02:50:57.904 --> 02:51:03.107]  But to save face they'll leave one person there to, you know, kind of put up a few articles because they don't need you now.
[02:51:03.107 --> 02:51:05.308]  They write one press release.
[02:51:05.308 --> 02:51:07.550]  It's been rewritten everywhere and republished.
[02:51:08.737 --> 02:51:16.554]  And so you've just extincted all of yourselves by blowing up the free society, you morons!
[02:51:16.554 --> 02:51:17.997]  Mark, that's really incredible, isn't it?
[02:51:17.997 --> 02:51:19.561]  You talk about sticking your foot in your mouth.
[02:51:23.170 --> 02:51:28.051]  A social networking site called Tumblr, which is sort of like Instagram for the insane.
[02:51:28.051 --> 02:51:32.192]  And thankfully, they have their own community so that they can just stay away from us.
[02:51:32.192 --> 02:51:37.533]  But they just changed their policy to prevent all, ban all adult content now.
[02:51:37.533 --> 02:51:44.994]  And so, they're screaming about censorship, and they're saying, oh, but the LGBT community, they need to be posting their adult content.
[02:51:44.994 --> 02:51:50.075]  And now you're oppressing them, so now it's, the pendulum is swinging the other way.
[02:51:50.075 --> 02:51:51.435]  And we've seen
[02:51:51.935 --> 02:52:04.446]  Mega corporations like Sears, which was once the largest retailer in America, now bankrupt, now virtually unknown, probably be completely shut down within the next 12 months, gone.
[02:52:04.446 --> 02:52:09.811]  When's the last time anybody used Netscape to log on to the Internet or America Online?
[02:52:09.811 --> 02:52:12.373]  So these once giants can fall.
[02:52:12.373 --> 02:52:14.015]  So Facebook, Apple,
[02:52:14.631 --> 02:52:22.474]  Twitter, all of these places can come crumbling down and we have to remain vigilant and keep pushing back on them because they're not going to stop.
[02:52:22.474 --> 02:52:26.836]  And it's hilarious, we have to keep pointing out their flaws because Jack Dorsey was just over in India.
[02:52:27.851 --> 02:52:36.153]  And he showed a photo of somebody that, or a painting that somebody made for him that perpetuated the caste system.
[02:52:36.153 --> 02:52:46.636]  And so the lower level people of society over there in the caste started criticizing Jack Dorsey for endorsing the social stratification separate system over there.
[02:52:46.636 --> 02:52:51.537]  So he can't even win by going over there and trying to suck up to the people in India.
[02:52:52.157 --> 02:52:53.058]  And we've got to push back.
[02:52:53.058 --> 02:52:58.263]  You know, every time Jack Dorsey tweets something on Twitter, go follow him and respond to everything that he says.
[02:52:58.263 --> 02:53:03.968]  Fill his timeline filled with a bunch of questions and comments about what it is that he's doing.
[02:53:03.968 --> 02:53:08.292]  Because they are worse than Big River in 1984.
[02:53:08.292 --> 02:53:11.015]  Because with the push of a button, they can make you disappear.
[02:53:11.015 --> 02:53:13.357]  But it's great to see so many people waking up.
[02:53:13.357 --> 02:53:15.238]  And I was relieved to see that Donald Trump Jr.
[02:53:16.079 --> 02:53:24.083]  Responded to the controversy about Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer last week by saying that quote, liberalism is a disease.
[02:53:24.083 --> 02:53:30.186]  And I know some people get into the weeds about, well, that liberalism doesn't mean what people say it is.
[02:53:30.186 --> 02:53:32.387]  I think at this point the word is almost tainted.
[02:53:32.387 --> 02:53:32.768]  No, you're right.
[02:53:32.768 --> 02:53:33.548]  They've taken it over.
[02:53:33.548 --> 02:53:34.969]  Liberalism is now leftism.
[02:53:34.969 --> 02:53:40.932]  It means an authoritarian control freak who's mentally ill and brain scans is a genetic psychopath.
[02:53:42.549 --> 02:53:47.670]  Yeah, and we're seeing major companies like BuzzFeed literally asking for donations.
[02:53:47.670 --> 02:53:50.851]  The London Guardian is asking for donations.
[02:53:50.851 --> 02:53:54.352]  The Weekly Standard is potentially going bankrupt.
[02:53:54.352 --> 02:53:59.014]  The Daily Beast, an extension of Newsweek magazine, they're for sale.
[02:53:59.014 --> 02:54:11.617]  And we've even seen the phony patriots on the right, like Glenn Beck, who in 2011 started his new independent media empire when he left Fox News, which should be rivaling Fox News by now, but he's a complete phony.
[02:54:12.512 --> 02:54:15.215]  Most of your audience knows this, but now he has merged.
[02:54:15.215 --> 02:54:25.884]  He's found a new host to suck the blood out of, as The Blaze has merged with CRTV, which was doing very well in the online environment.
[02:54:25.884 --> 02:54:29.367]  Got a good subscriber base, some great hosts, good content.
[02:54:29.367 --> 02:54:31.029]  Eric Bolling is over there.
[02:54:31.029 --> 02:54:32.891]  Michelle Malkin was over there.
[02:54:32.891 --> 02:54:37.675]  Now she quit as soon as they announced the merger, because Glenn Beck
[02:54:38.217 --> 02:54:40.840]  He's trying to suck the blood as the parrot that he is.
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:44.484]  I was about to say, Glenn Beck is a dyed-in-the-wool leftist.
[02:54:44.484 --> 02:54:47.087]  Glenn Beck told a lot of truth at Fox.
[02:54:47.087 --> 02:54:50.071]  He only did it to get the audience and tried to parlay it.
[02:54:50.071 --> 02:54:51.632]  And they tried to sell us Blaze TV.
[02:54:53.030 --> 02:54:54.610]  A blaze that was for sale.
[02:54:54.610 --> 02:54:56.031]  They didn't sell.
[02:54:56.031 --> 02:54:56.871]  They didn't merge.
[02:54:56.871 --> 02:54:59.952]  They collapsed into CRTV.
[02:54:59.952 --> 02:55:03.593]  And I guess because CRTV wants its hundreds of radio affiliates.
[02:55:03.593 --> 02:55:05.094]  But that is just a disaster.
[02:55:05.094 --> 02:55:06.774]  And I like CRTV.
[02:55:06.774 --> 02:55:11.815]  And let me tell you, Beck will always try to use his political power once he gets into a group.
[02:55:11.815 --> 02:55:13.956]  He's all about controlling things.
[02:55:13.956 --> 02:55:15.757]  He's all about dirty tricks.
[02:55:15.757 --> 02:55:18.237]  You know, he got threatened with what happened to us six, seven years ago.
[02:55:18.237 --> 02:55:19.178]  They said, we're going to come after you.
[02:55:19.178 --> 02:55:19.858]  We're going to sue you.
[02:55:20.458 --> 02:55:21.438]  We're going to de-platform him.
[02:55:21.438 --> 02:55:26.960]  He just rolled over and thought he was going to be a darling of the left, but then they rejected him as well.
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:35.302]  So now, even though most of the folks on CRTV were anti-Trump, which that's fine, like Levin and the rest of them, now they're all pro-Trump, which is fine.
[02:55:35.302 --> 02:55:36.023]  We were here.
[02:55:36.023 --> 02:55:36.863]  We took the heat.
[02:55:36.863 --> 02:55:39.003]  We've been targeted because we were steadfast.
[02:55:39.003 --> 02:55:39.704]  Mark, I know you got to go.
[02:55:39.704 --> 02:55:40.144]  We're going to break.
[02:55:40.144 --> 02:55:43.425]  We'll do five more minutes with you, and then we're going to have Nick Baggage come in and take over.
[02:55:43.425 --> 02:55:44.265]  But let me just say this briefly.
[02:55:45.638 --> 02:55:46.819]  Everyone needs to get the book.
[02:55:46.819 --> 02:55:47.700]  I don't care where you get it.
[02:55:47.700 --> 02:55:48.801]  Liberalism, find a cure.
[02:55:48.801 --> 02:55:49.542]  You need to read it.
[02:55:49.542 --> 02:55:55.927]  But most of you, as patriots, as conservatives, as libertarians, you already know all this.
[02:55:55.927 --> 02:55:59.691]  You really, really need to get the book and give it to everyone you know.
[02:55:59.691 --> 02:56:03.074]  Because Mark Geiss isn't funded by the globalists.
[02:56:03.074 --> 02:56:04.355]  I'm not funded by the globalists.
[02:56:04.355 --> 02:56:04.996]  And separately,
[02:56:06.408 --> 02:56:08.909]  George Soros, as we speak, has pulled out the stops.
[02:56:08.909 --> 02:56:22.417]  I learned more stuff the last week that I haven't gotten into on air about just as we defeat his last wave of stuff at great expense, they launch even more treacherous activity, and just financing really makes it easier for us to fight.
[02:56:22.417 --> 02:56:32.622]  It's all in God's hands, but InfoWarsTore.com has free shipping store-wide, double Patriot points, but with whatever order you get on the next order from 5% to 10% just until Christmas.
[02:56:32.622 --> 02:56:34.343]  Store-wide free shipping, and we have 70
[02:56:37.043 --> 02:56:38.384]  5% is the biggest discount.
[02:56:38.384 --> 02:56:44.146]  75% is the biggest discount, but everything is bare minimum 50% discount.
[02:56:44.146 --> 02:56:46.107]  And that means silver bullet, colloidal silver.
[02:56:46.107 --> 02:56:47.488]  That means super metal vitality.
[02:56:47.488 --> 02:56:49.769]  That means X2, X3.
[02:56:49.769 --> 02:56:52.170]  That means Rainforest Plus.
[02:56:52.170 --> 02:56:56.212]  And every order, this is our biggest deal ever with just those prices.
[02:56:56.212 --> 02:56:59.553]  This is total clearance for the year, so we don't pay inventory tax.
[02:56:59.553 --> 02:57:03.155]  Every order gets a, we're all Alex Jones, don't tread on me, Gadsden flag.
[02:57:04.298 --> 02:57:05.478]  Limited edition shirt.
[02:57:05.478 --> 02:57:07.919]  But by Monday, this shirt will be sold out.
[02:57:07.919 --> 02:57:11.380]  We have another shirt that's excellent as well that'll be the free gift.
[02:57:11.380 --> 02:57:12.480]  You get your orders in by the 19th.
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:15.962]  They're guaranteed delivery before Christmas in the continental U.S.
[02:57:15.962 --> 02:57:17.162]  But get your orders in now.
[02:57:17.162 --> 02:57:18.422]  Don't fight traffic.
[02:57:18.422 --> 02:57:19.283]  Don't fight the malls.
[02:57:19.283 --> 02:57:21.123]  And fund the info war.
[02:57:21.123 --> 02:57:24.504]  And I want to see liberalism find a cure.
[02:57:24.504 --> 02:57:26.185]  We've only got like 500 copies.
[02:57:26.185 --> 02:57:26.905]  Sell out today!
[02:57:27.745 --> 02:57:30.166]  Looks like I went to number 15 on Amazon total.
[02:57:30.166 --> 02:57:32.027]  And I'm gonna order 10,000 of this, man.
[02:57:32.027 --> 02:57:34.608]  Everyone needs to know we're in a war.
[02:57:34.608 --> 02:57:38.229]  And we can get around the enemy as long as you take action.
[02:57:38.229 --> 02:57:42.511]  Whatever you do, tell folks about that local radio station you're listening to right now.
[02:57:42.511 --> 02:57:42.911]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.194 --> 02:57:51.677]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:57:51.677 --> 02:57:58.501]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:57:58.501 --> 02:58:14.029]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[02:58:15.191 --> 02:58:19.033]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[02:58:19.033 --> 02:58:24.257]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.

[02:58:25.577 --> 02:58:27.398]  It is absolutely free.
[02:58:27.398 --> 02:58:32.622]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[02:58:32.622 --> 02:58:36.364]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:58:36.364 --> 02:58:40.686]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[02:58:40.686 --> 02:58:44.809]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:58:46.840 --> 02:58:52.866]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:58:52.866 --> 02:58:55.788]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[02:58:55.788 --> 02:58:59.852]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply.
[02:59:01.417 --> 02:59:10.564]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:59:10.564 --> 02:59:15.909]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[02:59:15.909 --> 02:59:18.190]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[02:59:18.190 --> 02:59:21.313]  MFORWARDSTORE.COM on MFORWARDS SELECT STORABLE FOODS.
[02:59:21.693 --> 02:59:23.174]  They've got special diet foods.
[02:59:23.174 --> 02:59:27.157]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[02:59:27.157 --> 02:59:29.159]  They've got so many great products there.
[02:59:29.159 --> 02:59:30.940]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[02:59:30.940 --> 02:59:32.922]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[02:59:32.922 --> 02:59:35.464]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[02:59:35.464 --> 02:59:40.448]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[02:59:40.448 --> 02:59:45.832]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[02:59:48.863 --> 02:59:51.473]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:07.366 --> 03:00:13.493]  Alright folks, Mark Dice here with us and we were talking and I said, we're going to do five more minutes, what do you want to hit?
[03:00:13.493 --> 03:00:18.338]  And he said, Section 230 of the Telecommunications Act, it's in the new NAFTA deal Trump signed.
[03:00:19.212 --> 03:00:21.573]  Cutlow, you know, told him, hey, sign it, and Trump signs it.
[03:00:21.573 --> 03:00:29.257]  It's got a better deal for trade, but it allows the companies to continue to censor the right and actually codifies it into international law.
[03:00:29.257 --> 03:00:34.919]  Yeah, scroll down and I'll show them the new subsection right there.
[03:00:34.919 --> 03:00:38.181]  Section 230 can be amended by the U.S.
[03:00:38.181 --> 03:00:38.861]  and Congress.
[03:00:40.814 --> 03:00:50.792]  Now they've got a new subsection in the piece of international NAFTA legislation that allows them to engage in the mass censorship.
[03:00:53.587 --> 03:01:05.237]  Mark, let's speak to this and the fact that, you know, we joke and say, oh look, the Huffington Post called for Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer to be banned, and then within one day of it, your defense of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer had been demonetized, and YouTube upheld that.
[03:01:05.237 --> 03:01:12.063]  That's how far we've gone that now Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, the ADL will probably give YouTube an award for fighting this Nazi.
[03:01:13.246 --> 03:01:16.909]  It's how poisoned the culture is and how infected it is with leftists.
[03:01:16.909 --> 03:01:19.511]  Most people are probably familiar with the controversy about Rudolph.
[03:01:19.511 --> 03:01:25.676]  The Huffington Post and a bunch of leftists said that it's sexist, homophobic, perpetuating gender norms.
[03:01:25.676 --> 03:01:32.822]  It shouldn't be bullying Rudolph even though the whole point is that you can overcome adversity and a perceived flaw can actually be a benefit.
[03:01:32.822 --> 03:01:35.103]  I mean, a five-year-old understands the story.
[03:01:35.103 --> 03:01:36.765]  So I did a video about the madness.
[03:01:37.285 --> 03:01:41.327]  It was automatically demonetized by YouTube for whatever reason.
[03:01:41.327 --> 03:01:44.508]  Something that was said in the video was offensive.
[03:01:44.508 --> 03:01:54.732]  And so the way YouTube works is, a lot of people may know this by now, you have to submit the videos for a manual review, and then it takes a couple days, and then everybody watches them, so it doesn't even really matter if it gets monetized later anyway.
[03:01:54.732 --> 03:01:59.874]  But a manual review from a moderator demonetized the video and confirmed
[03:02:00.314 --> 03:02:06.202]  That the video was non-advertiser friendly, defending Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
[03:02:06.202 --> 03:02:08.746]  That's how affected the culture is with leftism.
[03:02:08.746 --> 03:02:12.231]  And I just saw an article, I thought it was fake news, I thought it was satire.
[03:02:12.231 --> 03:02:15.235]  I've seen multiple reports in it from respectable outlets.
[03:02:15.595 --> 03:02:24.826]  The school principal banned all mentions of Christmas and Jesus and including, and he put a list of things that teachers can't have in their classroom, candy canes.
[03:02:24.826 --> 03:02:34.117]  Candy canes, because he said that the candy cane represents the J in Jesus, which I've never heard, I've never seen a candy cane upside down.
[03:02:34.897 --> 03:02:42.683]  This is the religion of the left where like they think clouds are racist because it looks like the Irish name Lynch means hang black people.
[03:02:42.683 --> 03:02:44.744]  It's a total attack on reality.
[03:02:44.744 --> 03:02:45.885]  It's a total mental illness.
[03:02:45.885 --> 03:02:47.946]  It's like having schizophrenics run things.
[03:02:47.946 --> 03:02:51.529]  USMCA entrenches tech companies right to censor.
[03:02:51.529 --> 03:02:59.975]  They say anything found objectionable will be banned and they're given liability protection to do it in article 19.17 which is exactly what
[03:03:01.929 --> 03:03:08.600]  Days later, he said at the ADL, when they bragged that I was banned, Tim Cook said, we will ban anything objectionable.
[03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:11.305]  That's whatever they want, whenever they want, always changing.
[03:03:11.305 --> 03:03:13.128]  My God, this is insane.
[03:03:13.826 --> 03:03:35.229]  And they knew we were pushing back, which is why they slipped it into that bill, because there's a lot of people who are educated now about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides these tech companies safe harbor, which means that they can't be sued for criminally or be held civilly or criminally liable for anything that any user posts on the platform.
[03:03:35.689 --> 03:04:04.672]  Because it's a platform, they're not responsible for moderating the content, so they can't have it both ways, or they shouldn't be able to have it both ways, whereas, well, if you're not going to be held liable for what's put on the platform, then you can't moderate what's on the platform, and that's why newspapers are liable for what they post, because they're making editorial decisions, and they post on their platform, and they make the decisions, so if it's a civil violation, or if it's a criminal content, they're liable.
[03:04:04.972 --> 03:04:12.800]  Whereas Apple and Twitter and all these Facebook social media platforms, they're not liable for what users post because of Section 230.
[03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:21.089]  So Section 230, they should either stop censoring unless it's a criminal content, or there's a civil judgment declares that something should be pulled.
[03:04:21.893 --> 03:04:26.177]  Or they should have their Section 230 Safe Harbor pulled.
[03:04:26.177 --> 03:04:27.918]  And we can't have it both ways.
[03:04:27.918 --> 03:04:28.498]  That's right, Mark.
[03:04:28.498 --> 03:04:30.260]  Incredibly good point.
[03:04:30.260 --> 03:04:32.822]  And that's why you're the genius out there with liberalism.
[03:04:32.822 --> 03:04:36.965]  Find a cure available at Infowarsstore.com and MarkDice.com.
[03:04:36.965 --> 03:04:40.167]  Bottom line, America, Trump, all of us must move against these companies.
[03:04:40.167 --> 03:04:43.130]  They're also trying to block Gab, Infowars, and shut us all down.
[03:04:43.130 --> 03:04:44.291]  So there's not competition.
[03:04:44.291 --> 03:04:46.312]  They're going after our credit card processing.
[03:04:46.312 --> 03:04:47.994]  These are clear and present dangers.
[03:04:47.994 --> 03:04:49.715]  Allied with Communist China, but the world's awake.
[03:04:50.075 --> 03:04:50.876]  Have a great weekend.
[03:04:50.876 --> 03:04:52.056]  Mark Dice, great job.
[03:04:52.056 --> 03:04:54.177]  Coming up, another big gift.
[03:04:54.177 --> 03:05:00.580]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:05:00.580 --> 03:05:02.141]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:05:02.141 --> 03:05:07.043]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off double-paid reappoints.
[03:05:07.043 --> 03:05:09.965]  Let's extend that sale but also add
[03:05:10.505 --> 03:05:13.247]  A free gift with every order.
[03:05:13.247 --> 03:05:22.114]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:05:22.114 --> 03:05:25.776]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[03:05:25.776 --> 03:05:31.140]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[03:05:31.140 --> 03:05:33.522]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[03:05:34.062 --> 03:05:38.948]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[03:05:38.948 --> 03:05:40.470]  So this is a lost leader.
[03:05:40.470 --> 03:05:42.052]  We are losing money on this.
[03:05:42.052 --> 03:05:43.473]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:05:43.473 --> 03:05:45.476]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[03:05:45.476 --> 03:05:46.817]  And don't fight the crowds.
[03:05:46.817 --> 03:05:48.239]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:05:48.239 --> 03:05:49.761]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[03:05:55.362 --> 03:05:59.607]  These conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[03:05:59.607 --> 03:06:04.553]  But to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[03:06:04.553 --> 03:06:07.176]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[03:06:33.214 --> 03:06:35.176]  There's a guy on the radio.
[03:06:35.176 --> 03:06:36.317]  His name is Alex Jones.
[03:06:36.317 --> 03:06:37.558]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:37.558 --> 03:06:41.221]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[03:06:41.221 --> 03:06:43.143]  Time to stop submitting to this parody!
[03:06:43.143 --> 03:06:45.405]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[03:06:45.405 --> 03:06:47.186]  I heard that on Alex Jones!
[03:06:47.186 --> 03:06:49.068]  InfoWars went even further.
[03:06:49.068 --> 03:06:52.331]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[03:06:52.331 --> 03:06:56.314]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[03:06:56.314 --> 03:06:57.896]  Nobody can dispute the fact
[03:06:58.556 --> 03:07:01.658]  At your own risk!
[03:07:01.658 --> 03:07:03.859]  InfoWars.com InfoWars comes to mind.
[03:07:03.859 --> 03:07:04.539]  InfoWars.
[03:07:04.539 --> 03:07:05.419]  InfoWars.
[03:07:05.419 --> 03:07:08.001]  Right now the war is the InfoWars.
[03:07:08.001 --> 03:07:12.683]  You watch InfoWars?

[03:07:19.986 --> 03:07:22.688]  InfoWars.com I want freedom!
[03:07:22.688 --> 03:07:23.768]  That's what I want!
[03:07:23.768 --> 03:07:24.969]  And that's what they should want!
[03:07:26.556 --> 03:07:35.200]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[03:07:35.200 --> 03:07:43.184]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:07:43.184 --> 03:07:51.689]  If you like to talk to racist tomatoes, if a bigoted squash can make you smile... That's racist!
[03:07:57.910 --> 03:08:07.857]  Cal State San Marcos held a whiteness forum in which they discussed topics relating to America's systemic racism.
[03:08:07.857 --> 03:08:14.502]  That was when they decided to bring up how VeggieTales is a racist cartoon.
[03:08:14.502 --> 03:08:20.446]  You know, the little series that teaches your children about the Bible and eating vegetables?
[03:08:20.446 --> 03:08:26.050]  Well, apparently VeggieTales is racist, according to liberals.
[03:08:26.770 --> 03:08:30.155]  The villains in VeggieTales have ethnic accents.
[03:08:30.155 --> 03:08:31.116]  Wait, wait, wait.
[03:08:31.116 --> 03:08:37.285]  They're saying the VeggieTales are racist because the villains are vegetables of color?
[03:08:37.285 --> 03:08:38.486]  What do you think?
[03:08:39.534 --> 03:08:41.994]  I think you look like Captain Crunch.
[03:08:41.994 --> 03:08:42.955]  Huh?
[03:08:42.955 --> 03:08:44.255]  No, I don't.
[03:08:44.255 --> 03:08:45.155]  Do it, though.
[03:08:45.155 --> 03:08:55.557]  When the kids see the good white character triumph over the bad colored vegetable character, they see white as right and minorities as evil.
[03:08:55.557 --> 03:08:58.078]  All vegetables are colorful.
[03:08:58.078 --> 03:09:01.318]  The heroes are vegetables of color.
[03:09:01.318 --> 03:09:04.039]  So the villains are going to be vegetables of color.
[03:09:04.039 --> 03:09:08.940]  All of the characters are going to be vegetables of color because they're all vegetables in VeggieTales.
[03:09:10.300 --> 03:09:11.841]  Crick, that is your cue!
[03:09:11.841 --> 03:09:12.501]  Just follow along.
[03:09:12.501 --> 03:09:12.921]  You with me?
[03:09:12.921 --> 03:09:13.541]  Crick!
[03:09:13.541 --> 03:09:16.723]  Watch the cucumber.
[03:09:16.723 --> 03:09:19.384]  See how he moves.
[03:09:19.384 --> 03:09:21.265]  I'm confused!
[03:09:21.265 --> 03:09:26.707]  Please, please, please show me these white vegetables on VeggieTales.
[03:09:26.707 --> 03:09:33.830]  My son has VeggieTales movies, and I've never seen a white tomato or a white squash.
[03:09:34.230 --> 03:09:37.432]  So please show me these white vegetable characters.
[03:09:37.432 --> 03:09:47.877]  And if you're talking about accents and how people speak, and you're regarding English as something that only white people can use, you're the racist one, aren't you?
[03:09:47.877 --> 03:09:48.237]  Right?
[03:09:48.237 --> 03:09:51.279]  Like, only white people use proper English?
[03:09:51.279 --> 03:09:52.219]  Seriously!
[03:09:52.219 --> 03:09:56.281]  That's racist to think that only white people use proper English!
[03:09:56.281 --> 03:09:58.942]  What's wrong with you, you freakin' racist?
[03:09:58.942 --> 03:10:00.463]  That's racist!
[03:10:00.463 --> 03:10:01.844]  I'll throw it right back at you!
[03:10:02.444 --> 03:10:16.058]  Well, maybe if they had an orange character in this VeggieTales classic that triumphed over everyone, I'm sure they would say that this is teaching children that Orange Man is good, and it's completely wrong!
[03:10:16.058 --> 03:10:17.039]  Yeah!
[03:10:18.721 --> 03:10:20.022]  Orange man bad!
[03:10:20.022 --> 03:10:27.569]  They're just trying to add character to vegetables, which is kind of hard to do when they're just vegetables.
[03:10:27.569 --> 03:10:30.673]  Where are these people getting these things?
[03:10:30.673 --> 03:10:33.275]  We're taking anti-racist stance.
[03:10:33.275 --> 03:10:35.878]  We sort of trace Christianity through time.
[03:10:35.878 --> 03:10:41.463]  We call it Christianity the white religion because it's embracing these white ideologies such as
[03:10:44.887 --> 03:10:48.170]  Yes, this is an attack on Christians and Christianity.
[03:10:48.170 --> 03:10:50.012]  Because it's all biblical.
[03:10:50.012 --> 03:10:53.716]  Remember what your parents teach you and what you've learned from the Bible.
[03:10:53.716 --> 03:10:58.221]  If someone wants you to do something that you know is wrong, stand firm and do what's right.
[03:10:59.742 --> 03:11:01.804]  We're doing white face and comedy.
[03:11:01.804 --> 03:11:12.572]  We felt like white face and comedy would be a good way to expose like white privilege and white domination because it's a good way, it's a light-hearted way to bring up race without it being too offensive.
[03:11:12.572 --> 03:11:27.584]  So in this class we look at how it is that white privilege and has been institutionalized and embedded in our public and social everyday lives and so that we can understand the system of racism that we currently live in.
[03:11:28.348 --> 03:11:29.469]  VeggieTales!
[03:11:29.469 --> 03:11:31.069]  Racist VeggieTales!
[03:11:31.069 --> 03:11:32.650]  Racist VeggieTales!
[03:11:32.650 --> 03:11:33.070]  Bigots!
[03:11:33.070 --> 03:11:33.610]  Bigots!
[03:11:33.610 --> 03:11:34.311]  Bigots!
[03:11:34.311 --> 03:11:35.711]  Bigotry!
[03:11:35.711 --> 03:11:37.792]  Misogyny!
[03:11:37.792 --> 03:11:41.474]  Racist VeggieTales!
[03:11:41.474 --> 03:11:43.795]  It's Veg Veg Veg Veg Veg VeggieTales!
[03:11:43.795 --> 03:11:46.116]  Time for Racist VeggieTales!
[03:11:46.116 --> 03:11:51.938]  There you go.
[03:11:51.938 --> 03:11:54.199]  I think I left out Sexist VeggieTales too.
[03:11:54.199 --> 03:11:55.580]  I'm sure that will be the next one.
[03:11:56.621 --> 03:12:00.044]  There's not enough female vegetable characters.
[03:12:00.044 --> 03:12:02.966]  Or they're enforcing gender roles on the vegetables.
[03:12:02.966 --> 03:12:03.947]  They're all phallic.
[03:12:03.947 --> 03:12:05.368]  Yeah.
[03:12:05.368 --> 03:12:10.371]  Those, most of those veggie tales are phallic shaped vegetables.
[03:12:10.371 --> 03:12:17.697]  Therefore, it's sexist and it's enforcing gender stereotyping roles.
[03:12:17.697 --> 03:12:19.018]  Okay, I just made that last one up.
[03:12:28.979 --> 03:12:30.280]  There's not even the same universe.
[03:12:30.280 --> 03:12:33.783]  I mean, she is an abject psychopathic demon from hell.
[03:12:33.783 --> 03:12:41.550]  People around her say she's so dark now, and so evil, and so possessed that they are having nightmares.
[03:12:41.550 --> 03:12:42.951]  They're freaking out.
[03:12:42.951 --> 03:12:45.013]  Folks, I say, listen.
[03:12:45.013 --> 03:12:48.216]  Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[03:12:48.216 --> 03:12:49.397]  Whiskey bottles!
[03:12:52.345 --> 03:12:56.187]  What difference at this point does it make?
[03:12:56.187 --> 03:12:59.128]  Can't you smell that smell?
[03:13:15.427 --> 03:13:19.870]  There's a guy on the radio.
[03:13:19.870 --> 03:13:22.472]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[03:13:22.472 --> 03:13:25.113]  He said we smell like something.
[03:13:25.113 --> 03:13:26.955]  Ain't that something?
[03:13:26.955 --> 03:13:29.676]  I'm not just being tacky.
[03:13:29.676 --> 03:13:33.239]  I'm a cloning martyr named Samoa.
[03:13:33.239 --> 03:13:38.222]  I had never seen or smelled anyone like that.
[03:13:51.617 --> 03:13:57.621]  Sorry, I'm gonna switch stuff.
[03:13:57.621 --> 03:14:01.324]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:14:01.324 --> 03:14:02.925]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:14:02.925 --> 03:14:19.257]  So Matt, there it is.
[03:14:21.257 --> 03:14:35.043]  There's a lot of flies in here and the center is going to do something about these flies.
[03:14:35.043 --> 03:14:38.065]  And welcome back to WimpleWars.com.
[03:14:38.065 --> 03:14:42.387]  This is Dr. Nick Begich standing in in this last hour.
[03:14:42.387 --> 03:14:45.168]  And I'm sorry about the confusion.
[03:14:45.168 --> 03:14:48.349]  You know, I'm in a little remote location.
[03:14:48.349 --> 03:14:49.190]  I'm headed down to
[03:14:50.663 --> 03:14:57.549]  Visit Alex here in a couple of days and do some work live in studio.
[03:14:57.549 --> 03:15:00.851]  So I want to get into a little different topic today.
[03:15:00.851 --> 03:15:14.703]  I want to go back to some of my traditional subject matter, which is really the issue of mind control manipulation of human behavior, which is what we're dealing with right now.
[03:15:14.703 --> 03:15:17.345]  When we look at the media, we look at what's happening.
[03:15:18.533 --> 03:15:25.355]  Around the world, this is the core of behavior modification on a grand scale.
[03:15:25.355 --> 03:15:26.635]  And so we're going to cover that today.
[03:15:26.635 --> 03:15:28.335]  We're going to get into some details.
[03:15:28.335 --> 03:15:40.538]  We've got a few segments left, and we want to get into this to really talk about the New World Order and where we're headed, where this is going, and what we can do.
[03:15:40.538 --> 03:15:41.798]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:15:41.798 --> 03:15:45.239]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and you'll be right back shortly.
[03:15:53.706 --> 03:15:54.926]  Hear that?
[03:15:54.926 --> 03:16:00.308]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:16:00.308 --> 03:16:03.209]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[03:16:03.209 --> 03:16:06.790]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:14.352]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[03:17:23.337 --> 03:17:24.578]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:24.578 --> 03:17:28.501]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:28.501 --> 03:17:30.042]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:30.042 --> 03:17:33.004]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:33.004 --> 03:17:38.569]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:38.569 --> 03:17:39.749]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:39.749 --> 03:17:42.692]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:42.692 --> 03:17:44.913]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:44.913 --> 03:17:49.357]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:17:49.357 --> 03:17:51.658]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:54.383 --> 03:17:58.348]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:17:58.348 --> 03:18:01.632]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:18:01.632 --> 03:18:07.921]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:18:07.921 --> 03:18:10.684]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:18:11.405 --> 03:18:15.228]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:18:15.228 --> 03:18:21.714]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:18:21.714 --> 03:18:26.659]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:27.406 --> 03:18:31.349]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:18:31.349 --> 03:18:38.534]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:18:38.534 --> 03:18:43.237]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:18:43.237 --> 03:18:49.462]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:49.462 --> 03:18:53.425]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:18:54.352 --> 03:19:02.738]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:19:02.738 --> 03:19:04.219]  Believe me, I know.
[03:19:04.219 --> 03:19:08.902]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:19:08.902 --> 03:19:11.984]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[03:19:12.464 --> 03:19:14.146]  I still have that energy.
[03:19:14.146 --> 03:19:34.308]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:19:34.808 --> 03:19:38.790]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[03:19:38.790 --> 03:19:42.472]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.

[03:19:57.759 --> 03:20:00.401]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.493 --> 03:20:32.680]  Hey, welcome back and I appreciate everyone being here and supporting this network.
[03:20:32.680 --> 03:20:38.884]  I am really proud to be a substitute host here with Alex and the team.
[03:20:38.884 --> 03:20:41.825]  What a great team it is to work with.
[03:20:41.825 --> 03:20:42.946]  Highly professional.
[03:20:43.718 --> 03:20:47.740]  Very skilled, great job they do, and I appreciate it.
[03:20:47.740 --> 03:21:09.973]  You know, talking about mind control issues, which is one of the areas where I've covered over the last 20 years, one of the first subjects that we talked about with Alex, you know, when we look at sort of what's happening, when you think of the media and how the media works, it generates a certain level of fear, anxiety,
[03:21:10.763 --> 03:21:11.604]  Tension?
[03:21:11.604 --> 03:21:19.508]  The things that actually disturb a person's ability to reach your higher states of awareness.
[03:21:19.508 --> 03:21:26.372]  The way to focus, look at things, is altered by the way media comes at us.
[03:21:26.372 --> 03:21:33.756]  On the screen right now is a reference to the CIA MK-ALTRA mind control experiments, which go back to the 1950s, 1960s.
[03:21:33.756 --> 03:21:34.737]  These projects were huge.
[03:21:39.736 --> 03:21:43.539]  And they were looking at a number of different ways to affect people.
[03:21:43.539 --> 03:21:49.203]  One was chemical, using chemical substances that would affect people's human behavior.
[03:21:49.203 --> 03:21:54.446]  Things like LSD, hallucinogenics of various types were tried.
[03:21:54.446 --> 03:22:05.474]  Other things that were utilized in these experiments were electromagnetic signals, signals that could manipulate human behavior in a very subtle
[03:22:06.613 --> 03:22:07.433]  Way.
[03:22:07.433 --> 03:22:20.578]  In fact, if you look at the work of Persinger at Laurentian University, what he did is a study on the effects of manipulating emotions, which is a relatively simple thing.
[03:22:20.578 --> 03:22:29.702]  And the way it's done is a signal is sent in, and the brain literally locks onto these external signals.
[03:22:29.702 --> 03:22:33.523]  And it's based on a pulse rate, a specific frequency,
[03:22:34.562 --> 03:22:39.324]  That overlays and connects with the human brain.
[03:22:39.324 --> 03:23:00.372]  And so what you can do, and what Persinger said we could do, is you could broadcast a signal across a large geographic area that created, say, a certain amount of anxiety, fear, and then just run the normal news feed through the media, and you'll see really clearly the ability to move a population.
[03:23:01.475 --> 03:23:14.380]  On the screen now is a great illustration, and what it's showing is some of the very deep states of brain activity, and up to the beta, the active state.
[03:23:14.380 --> 03:23:19.082]  And so what you have in the beginning, deep states of sleep, are Delta.
[03:23:19.082 --> 03:23:21.363]  That's below 4 Hertz.
[03:23:21.363 --> 03:23:23.904]  This is pulses per second.
[03:23:23.904 --> 03:23:28.686]  And so what happens below that level, this is where you are in that deep, deep state of dreaming.
[03:23:29.682 --> 03:23:34.744]  Now, artificially, it's very difficult to drive a person there.
[03:23:34.744 --> 03:23:39.326]  Now, the state above that, Theta, is very easy.
[03:23:39.326 --> 03:23:41.446]  It's 4 to 8 Hertz.
[03:23:41.446 --> 03:23:52.310]  Now, this is where you are in deep meditation, in dream states, altered states of awareness, and they can push you into this.
[03:23:52.310 --> 03:23:53.231]  And what happens with
[03:23:54.580 --> 03:24:07.207]  With this push, is the brain locks on in what's called a frequency following response, where you literally lock on, you begin to mirror the signal, and you fall into that emotional state.
[03:24:07.207 --> 03:24:20.394]  And then, you think about it, when you're getting a broadcast coming in, and it can come in through television, radio, any electromagnetic carrier, your cell phone device,
[03:24:22.249 --> 03:24:32.994]  Just think about anything that carries a signal, whether it's your power grid coming into your house or a broadcast signal as well.
[03:24:32.994 --> 03:24:45.161]  And what you can do is you can piggyback a signal and you can carry that and you receive it, but the brain will change and move into this other frame of reference.
[03:24:45.161 --> 03:24:46.742]  And so what happens then is
[03:24:48.050 --> 03:24:57.695]  You can literally program a population emotionally and then feed in the normal news feed through, say, a television.
[03:24:57.695 --> 03:25:02.197]  And that information is anchored fundamentally deeper.
[03:25:02.197 --> 03:25:09.321]  And you perceive the world also the way you interact with the world.
[03:25:09.321 --> 03:25:11.862]  It's very, very simple.
[03:25:11.862 --> 03:25:15.684]  And so it's a matter of generating fear, anxiety to shut down
[03:25:18.900 --> 03:25:26.626]  The high elitist human and then to add in a signal that distorts the way we are normally functioning.
[03:25:26.626 --> 03:25:35.073]  And so when you think about frequency following, we're supposed to think about anything that can carry that signal.
[03:25:35.073 --> 03:25:36.575]  And now let me give you another example.
[03:25:36.575 --> 03:25:41.559]  Um, from the standpoint of advertisers, this is very frequent method.
[03:25:41.559 --> 03:25:44.021]  That's supply.
[03:25:44.021 --> 03:25:47.704]  And what they what they essentially do is create that background signal.
[03:25:48.320 --> 03:25:56.984]  And then when that background signal comes in, you fall into that suggestive state, and then the advertising runs, and it just anchors in.
[03:25:56.984 --> 03:26:02.087]  So this is used commercially, politically, and otherwise.
[03:26:02.087 --> 03:26:10.811]  Now, when you think about controlling populations on a broader basis, think about some of the simpler things.
[03:26:10.811 --> 03:26:15.073]  Like the Googles, and the Apples, and these organizations, Facebook,
[03:26:16.369 --> 03:26:25.274]  All of them have developed systems for not so much manipulating as monitoring.
[03:26:25.274 --> 03:26:31.998]  And then when you monitor people's activity, then you can deduce tremendous amount of data about them.
[03:26:31.998 --> 03:26:38.642]  In fact, these organizations have incorporated with China to create their social scoring.
[03:26:38.642 --> 03:26:40.963]  Because the Chinese won't let them do business there,
[03:26:42.012 --> 03:26:47.795]  Unless they have access to their systems and those data feeds and everything everybody's doing.
[03:26:47.795 --> 03:26:53.778]  So they've created social profiling programming for the communists.
[03:26:53.778 --> 03:26:59.020]  And they're applying it commercially in the United States and the rest of the world.
[03:26:59.020 --> 03:27:07.244]  Only this is being run by the big CEOs of the shapers of opinion in the 21st century.
[03:27:07.244 --> 03:27:09.285]  And this is where the fundamental error is.
[03:27:10.760 --> 03:27:27.788]  Because when you consider the fact that they've developed these things for communists to control and manipulate their populations, and now they're using it to manipulate the speech of Americans by manipulating the feed of data.
[03:27:27.788 --> 03:27:35.112]  And this is through shadow banning, which Alex has talked about, through banning this network.
[03:27:35.112 --> 03:27:36.993]  And when you start to think about all of this,
[03:27:38.058 --> 03:27:41.601]  This is 1984 on steroids.
[03:27:41.601 --> 03:27:50.628]  Nobody expected this, but we predicted it 25 years ago and started talking about this 25 years ago.
[03:27:50.628 --> 03:27:56.233]  And when I look at where we've come, it's right on target.
[03:27:56.233 --> 03:27:57.374]  But here's the other part of this.
[03:27:57.374 --> 03:28:04.840]  Whenever you have these huge changes in politics, economics, our social platform,
[03:28:06.104 --> 03:28:11.787]  You end up creating a tension, a pushback, and that pushback has begun.
[03:28:11.787 --> 03:28:15.609]  And this is what I see.
[03:28:15.609 --> 03:28:20.992]  It's moving people into action, where we recognize we have no choice.
[03:28:20.992 --> 03:28:22.974]  We have to engage.
[03:28:22.974 --> 03:28:30.658]  And we can engage respectfully, we can engage consciously, and we can engage with an awareness that changes this world.
[03:28:30.658 --> 03:28:32.479]  This network is part of that change.
[03:28:33.118 --> 03:28:44.747]  The people who come on and speak on this network, we're here to inform, to elevate the consciousness of this population so we can take our governments back from around the world.
[03:28:44.747 --> 03:28:45.728]  We're going to be right back.
[03:28:45.728 --> 03:28:46.989]  This is Dr. Nick Vegich.

[03:31:53.616 --> 03:32:00.025]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:32:00.025 --> 03:32:01.588]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:32:01.588 --> 03:32:06.495]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patreon points.
[03:32:06.495 --> 03:32:09.419]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[03:32:09.939 --> 03:32:12.702]  A free gift with every order.
[03:32:12.702 --> 03:32:21.549]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:32:21.549 --> 03:32:25.212]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[03:32:25.212 --> 03:32:29.195]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day.
[03:32:29.195 --> 03:32:32.979]  It's there until it sells out, then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[03:32:33.499 --> 03:32:38.382]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[03:32:38.382 --> 03:32:39.922]  So this is a loss leader.
[03:32:39.922 --> 03:32:41.483]  We are losing money on this.
[03:32:41.483 --> 03:32:42.924]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:32:42.924 --> 03:32:46.246]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything, and don't fight the crowds.

[03:32:57.151 --> 03:32:59.812]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:09.776 --> 03:33:16.609]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:16.609 --> 03:33:20.236]  And now, your host, Nick Vagich.
[03:33:25.510 --> 03:33:27.972]  And welcome back to InfoWars.com.
[03:33:27.972 --> 03:33:33.596]  This is Dr. Nick Begich standing in in its fourth hour this Friday afternoon.
[03:33:33.596 --> 03:33:35.797]  And it's a pleasure to be with everyone again.
[03:33:35.797 --> 03:33:43.383]  We're getting into this mind control issue and area because it is fundamental to many of the things that are going on in the world right now.
[03:33:43.383 --> 03:33:49.367]  And during the last segment, I was talking about the frequency following response and how that works.
[03:33:49.367 --> 03:33:52.149]  And then I was also talking about the China social scoring.
[03:33:52.709 --> 03:33:53.229]  I'm good.
[03:34:09.437 --> 03:34:16.201]  The internet and the information age that we're in, where you can literally gather any perspective that you want.
[03:34:16.201 --> 03:34:17.641]  And here's what's happened.
[03:34:17.641 --> 03:34:20.843]  It's actually worked the opposite of what people expected.
[03:34:20.843 --> 03:34:30.107]  People expected a more informed, a more interactive, a more cohesive global community, which didn't happen.
[03:34:30.107 --> 03:34:34.189]  They expected a more cohesive community within the U.S.
[03:34:34.189 --> 03:34:35.530]  That didn't really happen.
[03:34:35.530 --> 03:34:38.071]  What they got instead was the narrowing
[03:34:38.471 --> 03:34:39.892]  Of people's perspective.
[03:34:39.892 --> 03:34:44.535]  In other words, people only get the data feeds that they're really interested in.
[03:34:44.535 --> 03:34:46.916]  So it kind of amplifies their own thinking.
[03:34:46.916 --> 03:34:49.077]  It doesn't really broaden the thinking.
[03:34:49.077 --> 03:34:54.720]  The way it used to be, we used to get, you know, three or four television stations, at least in my world.
[03:34:54.720 --> 03:34:57.882]  But what happened is you'd get sort of all of the news.
[03:34:57.882 --> 03:35:01.424]  The left, the right, the in the middle, all of it would come to us.
[03:35:01.424 --> 03:35:05.807]  And we would kind of discern and pick through and make our value judgments and decide
[03:35:06.227 --> 03:35:10.891]  You know, what we wanted to believe, but we always kind of got both sides of the big issues.
[03:35:10.891 --> 03:35:31.387]  Today we don't do that, because unless we purpose ourselves to look at our opposition, to look at those that oppose our ideas and ideals, so we understand the arguments, so we are better prepared, so we don't have what happened to the left when they were living in their bubble world and their bubble burst because they didn't have the full picture.
[03:35:31.387 --> 03:35:33.709]  They didn't even know there was a debate going on.
[03:35:33.709 --> 03:35:35.190]  We should not follow.
[03:35:35.690 --> 03:35:37.931]  The same direction as the liberals.
[03:35:37.931 --> 03:35:43.854]  We need to know what liberals are thinking, we need to know how they think, and we know how to construct our arguments based on that.
[03:35:43.854 --> 03:35:47.056]  I come from a very liberal background in terms of my family.
[03:35:47.056 --> 03:35:52.118]  I'm a conservative, a very strict conservative in fact, and a libertarian.
[03:35:52.739 --> 03:36:05.662]  But when I get into the debates with my brothers, which I do, and my sisters, which I do, and my mother, which I do, actually, they're pretty exciting debates if you're watching them from the outside because we differ so much.
[03:36:06.385 --> 03:36:08.305]  But there's some fundamental things that we do.
[03:36:08.305 --> 03:36:13.627]  We listen very carefully because we want to know how each other presents our arguments.
[03:36:13.627 --> 03:36:18.548]  And then we can listen to those arguments and decide, are they missing information?
[03:36:18.548 --> 03:36:21.449]  Is there something that they're missing that I need to inform them of?
[03:36:21.449 --> 03:36:26.990]  Am I missing information, which might change my opinion by listening actively and carefully?
[03:36:26.990 --> 03:36:30.691]  At the end of that listening, now I can feedback and we have an
[03:36:30.691 --> 03:36:31.431]  We're good to go.
[03:36:57.788 --> 03:37:09.494]  We need to engage this creative mind that God gave us and begin to apply it in the work that we do and the actions that we engage in and the interface we have with other people.
[03:37:09.494 --> 03:37:15.858]  You know, when you walk into a room and you carry the joy of the creation in you,
[03:37:16.494 --> 03:37:17.654]  People see it.
[03:37:17.654 --> 03:37:19.155]  People recognize it.
[03:37:19.155 --> 03:37:20.716]  And people want to talk about it.
[03:37:20.716 --> 03:37:22.516]  You know, we're in the Christmas season.
[03:37:22.516 --> 03:37:24.257]  We're in the holiday season.
[03:37:24.257 --> 03:37:31.580]  A time to reflect on values, what's important to us, and the direction in which our government and country is going.
[03:37:31.580 --> 03:37:38.483]  We have an opportunity in this generation, perhaps the last generation even, on this planet.
[03:37:38.483 --> 03:37:39.503]  Who knows?
[03:37:39.503 --> 03:37:43.184]  You know, when the next coming is coming.
[03:37:43.184 --> 03:37:44.285]  But I can tell you this.
[03:37:45.402 --> 03:37:48.425]  We have an opportunity to see change.
[03:37:48.425 --> 03:37:52.649]  When there's trauma and there's trauma coming, people begin to wake up.
[03:37:52.649 --> 03:38:02.279]  People begin to recognize each other again and recognize the need to support one another again in the work we do professionally and otherwise.
[03:38:02.279 --> 03:38:05.542]  This kind of community of action
[03:38:06.135 --> 03:38:09.996]  Coupled with values is what makes a country great.
[03:38:09.996 --> 03:38:14.456]  I was just on radio in Europe, on the biggest independent radio in Europe recently.
[03:38:14.456 --> 03:38:19.717]  And this is, you know, my surprise when we talk about Europe and what's happening in the U.S.
[03:38:19.717 --> 03:38:22.798]  and the nationalistic movements happening throughout Europe.
[03:38:22.798 --> 03:38:25.118]  They're all driven by the same overlays.
[03:38:25.118 --> 03:38:27.839]  They lay a very specific thing culturally.
[03:38:27.839 --> 03:38:35.340]  I mean, whether I'm in Latin America, whether I'm in the United States or Canada or Europe, there's a little bit of a twist that the globalists apply.
[03:38:35.960 --> 03:38:41.423]  In order to socially engineer the direction in which societies go.
[03:38:41.423 --> 03:38:45.525]  This is what we're seeing, but the pushback is coming from the right.
[03:38:45.525 --> 03:38:56.370]  It's coming from nationalists, not just in the United States, but nationalists in Great Britain, nationalists in Germany, nationalists who recognize that sovereign nations are still valid in the 21st century.
[03:38:57.430 --> 03:39:06.717]  One of my biggest surprises that I mentioned on radio here, the European Parliament, that nobody in the European Parliament is elected.
[03:39:06.717 --> 03:39:08.338]  No one elects any of these people.
[03:39:08.338 --> 03:39:12.661]  And they call themselves a democratic institution?
[03:39:12.661 --> 03:39:15.644]  Give me a break.
[03:39:15.644 --> 03:39:20.287]  Most Europeans don't even have this cognitively in their head.
[03:39:20.287 --> 03:39:22.909]  And we were discussing it in Europe earlier in the week.
[03:39:23.917 --> 03:39:39.570]  The idea that most Europeans don't even contemplate the fact that these unelected people are determining to a great extent how Europe runs and then their financial systems hand over to global bankers who control the euro across all of the countries within the European Union.
[03:39:40.282 --> 03:39:43.184]  With a few exceptions, I didn't opt for the Euro.
[03:39:43.184 --> 03:39:45.306]  Croatia won case in point.
[03:39:45.306 --> 03:39:46.948]  They kept the Kuna.
[03:39:46.948 --> 03:39:55.535]  The point is that when you start to look at sort of the configuration, the detachment, because in the United States, we understand one thing.
[03:39:55.535 --> 03:40:04.582]  Government comes, it gains its validity from us as individual human beings, as individual living souls.
[03:40:04.582 --> 03:40:05.583]  We are the government.
[03:40:06.152 --> 03:40:11.161]  We form our government and we need to take back that control of our government and assert our birthright.
[03:40:11.947 --> 03:40:18.812]  As created human beings with certain rights fundamental to our very creation.
[03:40:18.812 --> 03:40:20.113]  And this is part of it.
[03:40:20.113 --> 03:40:22.215]  Governance comes from the people.
[03:40:22.215 --> 03:40:27.799]  The European Union, the European Parliament has a governance that does not come from the population.
[03:40:27.799 --> 03:40:29.220]  They have no authority.
[03:40:29.220 --> 03:40:31.162]  They should have no authority.
[03:40:31.162 --> 03:40:40.329]  And what's going on with the movements in Europe is exactly the right course of action at a time when we need to begin and continue the pushback.
[03:40:40.849 --> 03:40:45.472]  We're all in this together as individual souls on this planet.
[03:40:45.472 --> 03:40:54.957]  We have different national interests that are clearly defined by our governments to some degree, by our citizens to a greater degree, and that's where we need to put our emphasis.
[03:40:54.957 --> 03:40:58.759]  Recognize our differences across political spectrums.
[03:40:58.759 --> 03:41:03.242]  Look for opportunities where there is correspondence of values where we can cooperate together.
[03:41:03.923 --> 03:41:07.427]  Otherwise, we need to stay out and get out.
[03:41:07.427 --> 03:41:16.417]  And we need to ask people to excuse themselves from our affairs as well when they don't have a vested interest and are not citizens of this country.
[03:41:16.417 --> 03:41:18.940]  You know, big changes are coming.
[03:41:18.940 --> 03:41:22.604]  We're going to see, as much as everything is rosy today,
[03:41:23.422 --> 03:41:25.304]  There is a wave building.
[03:41:25.304 --> 03:41:27.605]  The bubble will one day burst.
[03:41:27.605 --> 03:41:30.608]  And then we will really need to rely on one another.
[03:41:30.608 --> 03:41:32.209]  More so than we ever have before.
[03:41:32.209 --> 03:41:36.973]  You know, recently in the last week, last Friday, I was in Alaska in my home.
[03:41:36.973 --> 03:41:41.497]  We had one of the biggest earthquakes that we've had since 1964.
[03:41:41.497 --> 03:41:43.758]  What does it do when these things happen?
[03:41:43.758 --> 03:41:45.560]  People quickly recognize.
[03:41:46.830 --> 03:41:48.991]  The need to support one another.
[03:41:48.991 --> 03:41:49.751]  We were lucky.
[03:41:49.751 --> 03:41:51.332]  We had no serious injuries.
[03:41:51.332 --> 03:41:53.033]  We had no deaths.
[03:41:53.033 --> 03:41:57.995]  But we had people pulling together from the very moments of the beginning of that.
[03:41:57.995 --> 03:42:00.897]  Because that represents the character.
[03:42:00.897 --> 03:42:02.698]  The character of Americans.
[03:42:02.698 --> 03:42:09.621]  Where in the worst of situations, we stand together, we pull together, and we make our systems work.
[03:42:10.350 --> 03:42:13.034]  You know, disasters of all different kinds happen.
[03:42:13.034 --> 03:42:14.877]  We have fires in California.
[03:42:14.877 --> 03:42:16.159]  We have earthquakes in Alaska.
[03:42:16.159 --> 03:42:18.523]  We have hurricanes in the southeast.
[03:42:18.523 --> 03:42:25.153]  All of these things remind us of first, our vulnerability, and then secondly, our need.
[03:42:26.033 --> 03:42:33.400]  To come together as human beings, begin to support each other in a more vibrant way, a way that truly changes the world.
[03:42:33.400 --> 03:42:34.922]  We're headed into a break.
[03:42:34.922 --> 03:42:38.165]  I again want to ask you to support InfoWars.com.
[03:42:38.165 --> 03:42:43.229]  If you want information, our books and products, go to the InfoWars store and check it out.

[03:42:47.533 --> 03:42:53.515]  This is Nick Faggett standing in for Alex Jones on this Friday afternoon and we'll be right back after these important messages.
[03:42:53.515 --> 03:42:55.676]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[03:44:07.088 --> 03:44:12.472]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[03:44:54.266 --> 03:45:04.872]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:45:04.872 --> 03:45:09.815]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:45:09.815 --> 03:45:10.996]  It's made in the USA.
[03:45:11.596 --> 03:45:11.876]  I think?
[03:45:34.991 --> 03:45:37.673]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:45:59.341 --> 03:46:08.023]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:46:08.023 --> 03:46:10.024]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:46:10.024 --> 03:46:13.465]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:46:13.465 --> 03:46:16.085]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:46:16.085 --> 03:46:18.366]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:46:18.366 --> 03:46:25.328]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
[03:46:25.868 --> 03:46:35.676]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:46:35.676 --> 03:46:36.857]  We'll win.
[03:46:36.857 --> 03:46:39.760]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:46:39.760 --> 03:46:46.926]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:46:46.926 --> 03:46:50.609]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[03:46:50.609 --> 03:46:52.171]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:46:52.171 --> 03:46:53.031]  We need your support.
[03:46:53.031 --> 03:46:53.592]  I'm counting on you.
[03:46:57.088 --> 03:47:14.395]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.395 --> 03:47:16.516]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.516 --> 03:47:18.456]  Because there is a war on.
[03:47:18.456 --> 03:47:20.057]  For your mind.
[03:47:20.057 --> 03:47:21.978]  With Mick Begich.
[03:47:27.933 --> 03:47:30.554]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:30.554 --> 03:47:34.115]  This is Dr. Nick Vegas standing in in this fourth hour.
[03:47:34.115 --> 03:47:35.556]  I appreciate all of the listeners.
[03:47:35.556 --> 03:47:38.857]  I appreciate the guys in the booth keeping this thing moving along.
[03:47:38.857 --> 03:47:43.659]  And, you know, we've been covering a couple different concepts.
[03:47:43.659 --> 03:47:53.783]  You know, we were talking about mind control, talking a little bit about sort of what's been happening in Europe and how things are sort of being framed and pushed in a very specific direction.
[03:47:55.195 --> 03:48:00.760]  Let's get back into sort of what's, you know, what is coming in my view.
[03:48:00.760 --> 03:48:04.884]  You know, first of all, we're going to have a new Congress in January.
[03:48:04.884 --> 03:48:09.328]  Whatever can be done between now and then by this lame duck Congress ought to get done.
[03:48:09.328 --> 03:48:11.450]  Call your congressman, call your U.S.
[03:48:11.450 --> 03:48:20.138]  Senator, ask them to engage the conservative agenda now while we still have a few months, a few weeks even, to get maybe some things done.
[03:48:21.219 --> 03:48:23.721]  We're going to go back into gridlock, I'm afraid.
[03:48:23.721 --> 03:48:27.304]  This is going to be bad news.
[03:48:27.304 --> 03:48:29.046]  It's going to create a lot of tension.
[03:48:29.046 --> 03:48:32.288]  We'll see who blinks first.
[03:48:32.288 --> 03:48:36.612]  I'm confident that conservatives will prevail in this.
[03:48:36.612 --> 03:48:40.656]  But we need to hold steady and we need to support this network at this particular time.
[03:48:41.980 --> 03:48:43.641]  InfoWars.com.
[03:48:43.641 --> 03:48:46.222]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[03:48:46.222 --> 03:48:48.203]  My books and videos are all there.
[03:48:48.203 --> 03:48:49.884]  There's the Mind Control book.
[03:48:49.884 --> 03:48:58.769]  There's Earth Rising, which deals with all the platform of various technologies that we've been talking over the weeks and in the past on this program.
[03:48:58.769 --> 03:48:59.710]  They're all there.
[03:48:59.710 --> 03:49:04.893]  And these were things that were predicted much, much before things actually emerged.
[03:49:04.893 --> 03:49:07.234]  There's hundreds and hundreds of sources cited there.
[03:49:07.995 --> 03:49:14.862]  Very important in terms of documenting the facts, something that Alex does carefully, I do very carefully.
[03:49:14.862 --> 03:49:24.834]  Most of the hosts, as you know, those who watch the show, you see the exhibits, you see the information, you see those feeds that actually document
[03:49:25.415 --> 03:49:26.857]  The very things we're talking about.
[03:49:26.857 --> 03:49:39.297]  Now jumping back to this sort of illusion of a republic that is being shoved out hard throat these days, I want to get back in to sort of how does all of the data collection
[03:49:40.066 --> 03:49:42.467]  And the feedback that's now possible.
[03:49:42.467 --> 03:49:46.549]  The feedback is individually tailored for you.
[03:49:46.549 --> 03:49:48.169]  This is how Brexit worked.
[03:49:48.169 --> 03:49:50.851]  And this is how Trump actually won.
[03:49:50.851 --> 03:49:57.133]  Taking big data, they were able to deduce 36 profiles of personality.
[03:49:57.133 --> 03:50:02.775]  And within those profiles of personality, they were then able to target specific individuals.
[03:50:02.775 --> 03:50:03.896]  And let me give you some examples.
[03:50:04.376 --> 03:50:22.751]  If you could get 300 data points on an individual, you know, through the Internet, what do they look at, what do they research, that kind of interactive feed, 300 data points give you as much information as if you had lived with that person for five years, in terms of how those programs work.
[03:50:22.751 --> 03:50:29.396]  If you could get 3,000 bits of information, which is relatively easy in today's world of Facebook and social media,
[03:50:31.214 --> 03:50:38.116]  3,000 data points get you the same information as someone who lived with you for 20 years.
[03:50:38.116 --> 03:50:43.797]  In fact, it can predict what you'll do better than you can.
[03:50:43.797 --> 03:50:48.758]  And so what they did with this big data is they targeted very specific groups.
[03:50:48.758 --> 03:50:54.880]  As an example, in the Southeast, where black voters were expected to vote for Hillary.
[03:50:55.752 --> 03:50:58.653]  They knew, Trump people knew, they couldn't get those votes.
[03:50:58.653 --> 03:51:00.914]  But what they could do is neutralize those votes.
[03:51:00.914 --> 03:51:07.837]  And if those of you remember the ads that were running, there was police with black men on the ground and police dogs chewing on them.
[03:51:07.837 --> 03:51:12.299]  And in the background was Hillary's voice saying, we have to bring them to heel.
[03:51:12.299 --> 03:51:14.079]  We have to bring them to heel.
[03:51:14.079 --> 03:51:15.200]  And many will remember that.
[03:51:15.200 --> 03:51:18.521]  And she was commenting on inner city use in the big cities.
[03:51:18.521 --> 03:51:20.082]  But that ad neutralized
[03:51:20.822 --> 03:51:24.164]  Minority voters in the Southeast, they didn't go to the polls at all.
[03:51:24.164 --> 03:51:26.806]  They didn't vote for Trump, but they didn't vote for Hillary.
[03:51:26.806 --> 03:51:35.971]  This is the techniques that were used in the Trump run and also used in the Brexit exit because they were able to target specific people.
[03:51:35.971 --> 03:51:42.955]  Now this can be used for you or against you and this is the very important point in all of this is data.
[03:51:42.955 --> 03:51:46.537]  The data that we give so freely through social media and other means.
[03:51:47.037 --> 03:51:47.858]  We're good to go.
[03:52:09.813 --> 03:52:10.273]  That's great.
[03:52:26.417 --> 03:52:33.645]  And that is contrarian to who you are from time to time so that you can disturb the data fields.
[03:52:33.645 --> 03:52:40.313]  In fact, I'd recommend that routinely people do a search in the absolute opposite direction of your normal nature.
[03:52:40.313 --> 03:52:42.215]  Do 10 searches in the wrong direction.
[03:52:43.027 --> 03:52:47.449]  Just so you screw up the programs that are being run against you.
[03:52:47.449 --> 03:52:52.491]  If people routinely do this, it will screw up their ability to predict and program.
[03:52:52.491 --> 03:52:53.911]  The same with polling.
[03:52:53.911 --> 03:52:55.152]  Forget the polling.
[03:52:55.152 --> 03:53:10.857]  You know, either don't do it or give them screwed up information so that polls, which are totally unreliable today politically, they are not worth anything anymore because you can't get a clear profile because of the way data is collected and it's so broken up.
[03:53:10.857 --> 03:53:12.298]  But we can disrupt
[03:53:12.811 --> 03:53:15.472]  We can participate as disruptors.
[03:53:15.472 --> 03:53:17.073]  That's who we are.
[03:53:17.073 --> 03:53:20.654]  We are disrupting this social order that we don't believe in.
[03:53:20.654 --> 03:53:22.875]  We can look at data feeds and how we do this.
[03:53:22.875 --> 03:53:28.998]  Just do a couple of searches in weird directions and chase them down for a little while.
[03:53:28.998 --> 03:53:32.359]  Spend 20 minutes every once in a while doing it.
[03:53:32.359 --> 03:53:33.520]  And then you screw up.
[03:53:34.375 --> 03:53:38.318]  The people's ability to gather data and then use it against you.
[03:53:38.318 --> 03:53:44.623]  And then you'll get all kinds of stuff feeding back, but at least you've done a bit.
[03:53:44.623 --> 03:53:50.829]  To put a bicycle wrench in the bicycle spokes as a New World Order is riding down the hill.
[03:53:50.829 --> 03:53:52.490]  Those are simple things.
[03:53:52.490 --> 03:53:54.331]  The other is really even simpler.
[03:53:54.331 --> 03:53:56.373]  Turn off the TV.
[03:53:56.373 --> 03:53:57.594]  I mean it.
[03:53:57.594 --> 03:54:02.198]  Turn off the TV and then broaden your approach, but then be specific.
[03:54:02.973 --> 03:54:11.620]  Listen to the alternative medias, listen to those other ideas, and then engage in learning and educating yourself.
[03:54:11.620 --> 03:54:17.605]  Don't accept the data feed from the New World Order, which is the media of the 21st century.
[03:54:17.605 --> 03:54:21.768]  It is totally altered the way our society runs, the way our people function.
[03:54:21.768 --> 03:54:29.214]  This is working against our children and the successor generations that we, in this generation, have a responsibility to protect.
[03:54:29.714 --> 03:54:36.897]  And you know, when I think about this, liberal or conservative, one thing I know that we can all agree on, the children of the future we care about.
[03:54:36.897 --> 03:54:39.858]  We haven't met them yet, so we're not mad at them.
[03:54:39.858 --> 03:54:46.821]  Think about those unborn souls coming into this world, and what world will we leave them?
[03:54:48.303 --> 03:54:50.924]  We have the opportunity to continue to push.
[03:54:50.924 --> 03:54:55.105]  And I say to all of the listeners around the world, don't give up.
[03:54:55.105 --> 03:54:57.185]  Continue to push against your government.
[03:54:57.185 --> 03:55:10.509]  Continue to push against change that moves this, not backwards, but forward into a life that recognizes those base values that in this part of the world were created over 200 years ago.
[03:55:12.344 --> 03:55:35.232]  By our Founding Fathers who recognize the sovereignty of the individual and the rights of individuals as we project into the world around us and our obligation and responsibilities to one another both in terms of protecting our ability to speak freely, protecting our ability to practice our religions freely, to
[03:55:36.221 --> 03:55:40.562]  Our ability to influence and control the political outcomes of our governments.
[03:55:40.562 --> 03:55:42.643]  These are fundamental to who we are.
[03:55:42.643 --> 03:55:46.764]  Not just as Americans, but as living souls on this planet.
[03:55:46.764 --> 03:55:52.445]  Taking our governments back, whether in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, or around the world.
[03:55:52.445 --> 03:55:56.526]  What's happening now is the beginning of the pushback.
[03:55:56.526 --> 03:55:58.366]  And we're all in the in for war together.
[03:55:58.366 --> 03:56:00.847]  I want to remind people to support this network.
[03:56:01.627 --> 03:56:04.810]  Do the things that need to be done so we stay on the air.
[03:56:04.810 --> 03:56:10.215]  I keep forgetting, I never remember to mention my own website, but check out earthpulse.com.
[03:56:10.215 --> 03:56:14.418]  E-A-R-T-H-P-U-L-S-E, earthpulse.com.
[03:56:14.418 --> 03:56:18.081]  We have lots of things there that deal with the issues that we're talking about.
[03:56:18.081 --> 03:56:22.845]  A lot of free information there as well, and we encourage you to access that and pass it on to others.
[03:56:23.946 --> 03:56:29.650]  And again, all of our stuff is offered through the InfoStore, and I really recommend that you do that.
[03:56:29.650 --> 03:56:31.291]  That gets us two bites of the apple.
[03:56:31.291 --> 03:56:38.255]  You support Alex, you support InfoWars, and you support the work that I'm doing around the world, and I appreciate it.
[03:56:38.255 --> 03:56:44.019]  You know, wrapping up this section, I want to talk about where do we go from here?
[03:56:44.019 --> 03:56:50.062]  In the Christmas season, you know, we think about the values, the Christian values that most Americans share.
[03:56:51.781 --> 03:56:59.165]  These are values of consideration, of kindness, of courtesy, of courage.
[03:56:59.165 --> 03:57:03.948]  The ability to step in and stand up when others are falling down.
[03:57:03.948 --> 03:57:05.369]  This is who we are.
[03:57:05.369 --> 03:57:06.729]  This is who Americans are.
[03:57:06.729 --> 03:57:08.710]  This is who we have always been.
[03:57:08.710 --> 03:57:11.612]  And one day, we will see it come back.
[03:57:11.612 --> 03:57:13.333]  And the world is waiting for that day.
[03:57:14.102 --> 03:57:18.746]  Because the world recognizes that what comes out of this country has been good.
[03:57:18.746 --> 03:57:21.389]  It has changed the world and will continue to change the world.
[03:57:21.389 --> 03:57:27.775]  And together, on InfoWars, we are changing that world, and we'll continue to change that world together.
[03:57:27.775 --> 03:57:29.957]  You're listening to Dr. Nick Veggage.
[03:57:29.957 --> 03:57:32.859]  This is the last segment of this Friday afternoon.
[03:57:32.859 --> 03:57:39.846]  We all appreciate you out there making InfoWars strong, supporting us, and helping us change the world together.
[03:57:43.143 --> 03:57:51.028]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.
[03:57:51.028 --> 03:58:00.255]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before, as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[03:58:00.255 --> 03:58:07.920]  So get great products and help fund the InfoWars right now with the 12 Days of Christmas that is special amongst a group of incredible sales.
[03:58:08.080 --> 03:58:08.380]  Now more
[03:58:23.732 --> 03:58:28.255]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[03:58:28.255 --> 03:58:28.435]  It's you!
[03:58:53.462 --> 03:58:55.964]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:58:55.964 --> 03:58:57.285]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:58:57.285 --> 03:59:00.208]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[03:59:14.620 --> 03:59:26.003]  Let everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:59:26.003 --> 03:59:33.965]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[03:59:33.965 --> 03:59:41.007]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:59:41.007 --> 03:59:43.748]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[03:59:47.108 --> 03:59:49.741]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
