[00:00:00.848 --> 00:00:03.090]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:12.597]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:13.919]  Big Brother.
[00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.680]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.441]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:19.023]  You want answers?
[00:00:19.023 --> 00:00:20.584]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:20.584 --> 00:00:24.767]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:28.851]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.763 --> 00:00:34.850]  Yeah.
[00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:50.822]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:50.822 --> 00:01:06.766]  Obviously, there are a lot of big world events we're going to be breaking down and a lot of huge news stories that have been ignored because of the tragic bombing attacks in Boston and now the ensuing government power grab orgy.
[00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:08.889]  That is going on.
[00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:23.037]  The total wide-open border amnesty, 800-page-plus bill, CISPA passing the House, Russian or Chinese-style net censorship, in the words of tech analyst Declan McCullough at CNET News.
[00:01:23.037 --> 00:01:26.219]  I mean, even Google says it's draconian.
[00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.901]  That is rocketed through the House.
[00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:34.084]  Homeland Security will be given even more autonomous power from the more and more ceremonial Congress.
[00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:37.667]  Manipulations of gold downward.
[00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:48.716]  Definitely the big mega banks are using paper gold in naked shorts to drive down the physical gold to hide the inflationary thing going on with paper currencies.
[00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:49.757]  We've got that.
[00:01:49.757 --> 00:01:53.980]  We've got federal furloughs hitting nation's biggest airports.
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.562]  We've got all the latest on the bombing.
[00:01:57.788 --> 00:02:03.952]  It is all coming up today and former NSA analyst and before that submarine warfare expert.
[00:02:03.952 --> 00:02:11.836]  And of course he worked for a bunch of other big companies and has been reporting on congressional national security issues for over a decade.
[00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:17.319]  Wayne Madsen is going to be giving us his take on this situation.
[00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.621]  And we also have Joel Skousen on who was on a few days after this happened last week.
[00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:24.003]  Also a national security analyst.
[00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:28.132]  of substantive gravitas.
[00:02:28.132 --> 00:02:34.737]  Joel Skousen will be joining us the last 30 minutes of the transmission today to give us his take on all of this.
[00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:44.543]  But regardless of whether this is a staged event or not, you know this power structure is coming after your liberty, coming after your freedom.
[00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:47.162]  You know that.
[00:02:47.162 --> 00:02:51.066]  And you know they're going to sell tens of billions of dollars of robots.
[00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:54.869]  And you know they're going to sell more armored vehicles.
[00:02:54.869 --> 00:03:00.514]  And you know the military-industrial complex, most of it foreign, is going to use this to turn America upside down.
[00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:03.176]  Now, obviously, day one it happened.
[00:03:03.176 --> 00:03:05.138]  I said, let's look for drills.
[00:03:05.138 --> 00:03:06.259]  Let's look for stand-downs.
[00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:08.441]  Let's look for multiple Patsy-gribs.
[00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:09.481]  Let's look for set-ups.
[00:03:10.444 --> 00:03:12.905]  And let's follow who they say they believe it is.
[00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:15.005]  And the media said it's going to be a right-winger, Lone Wolf.
[00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:17.186]  And they said, OK, they've been in arrest.
[00:03:17.186 --> 00:03:18.967]  Our word is right-wing Lone Wolf.
[00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:20.967]  You gun owners are going to get the blame.
[00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.328]  We got you.
[00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:25.629]  But because of all the photos out there, I think the evidence is clear.
[00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.490]  They said, OK, we haven't been in arrest.
[00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.610]  We were letting the person go.
[00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.210]  We're shutting the courthouse down.
[00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.671]  Panic, you know, kicked the media out.
[00:03:33.274 --> 00:03:36.456]  And then they, the next day, bring out the Patsy photos.
[00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:39.379]  And people are like, oh, but they said they had a firefight with him.
[00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:46.424]  Now witnesses, and these articles are up at Infowars.com, say, no, the naked guy being put in the car was the older brother.
[00:03:46.424 --> 00:03:48.666]  No, they later saw him get run over.
[00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:50.926]  By the police.
[00:03:50.926 --> 00:03:58.148]  And then you notice the younger brother gets out of the boat, climbs out of the boat, and then minutes later is getting what looks like a tracheotomy.
[00:03:58.148 --> 00:04:00.248]  And now he can't talk too good.
[00:04:00.248 --> 00:04:04.069]  And I'm sure after enough electroshock therapy, he'll say whatever they want.
[00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.870]  These guys clearly, and this fits the exact MO we've seen, are double agents, triple agents.
[00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.151]  And the Israeli press, Deb Cofilo, is saying that.
[00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:15.532]  Now people will say, how dare you say it wasn't a totally staged deal?
[00:04:15.532 --> 00:04:16.452]  That is a staged deal.
[00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:25.856]  I mean, 7-7, they were young, secular-style Muslims, mainly, liberals, who it looked like were getting extra paychecks with MI5 and MI6.
[00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:34.040]  Well, that came out, and were being handled by a SWAT, a high-level Al-Qaeda operative, who was also MI6, and is still allowed to travel in and out of England.
[00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:37.312]  He reportedly was their handler.
[00:04:37.312 --> 00:04:39.193]  Now that's London Telegraph.
[00:04:39.193 --> 00:04:40.834]  Fox News.
[00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:43.336]  And again, that's just one case I'm giving you.
[00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:45.937]  It's the same story over and over again.
[00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:49.039]  Look at Benghazi arming the Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.861]  Look at what they're doing right now in Libya and Syria.
[00:04:51.861 --> 00:04:53.422]  And then, when they attack us...
[00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.255]  It's like, hey, you know, come out of your house with your hands up.
[00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:04.027]  We have video coming up of citizens coming out with their hands up in their homes with the cops aiming guns at them.
[00:05:04.027 --> 00:05:07.253]  That is totally illegal and a bunch of bull and a power grab.
[00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.354]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here it is.
[00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:15.016]  The Cal Bend Soap Company.
[00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:20.801]  Alex's staff have been using these all-natural, earth-friendly, pure soaps for years, and they are the best.
[00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:24.604]  See them on the web at www.5starsoap.com.
[00:05:24.964 --> 00:05:29.406]  Or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:32.427]  Then order the Sampler 1-2 month supply.
[00:05:32.427 --> 00:05:39.550]  You'll be getting soap products twice as good as what you're using now at a great price and supporting an American company in the process.
[00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.211]  Earth friendly and all American.
[00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:44.253]  Their soaps are made from vegetable and coconut oils.
[00:05:44.253 --> 00:05:51.259]  Call 1-800-340-7091 or visit www.5starsoap.com.
[00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:58.385]  Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated.
[00:05:58.385 --> 00:06:02.988]  See it on the web www.5starsoap.com or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:15.708]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:33.599]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:37.721]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:39.122]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[00:06:39.122 --> 00:06:41.684]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:07:07.841 --> 00:07:08.148]  We're good.
[00:07:08.712 --> 00:07:17.258]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[00:07:17.258 --> 00:07:20.940]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.383]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[00:07:25.383 --> 00:07:30.447]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[00:07:30.447 --> 00:07:37.952]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus,
[00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:39.072]  I think so.
[00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:24.543]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.543 --> 00:08:27.883]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:27.883 --> 00:08:29.704]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:29.704 --> 00:08:30.724]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:30.724 --> 00:08:34.005]  We're here live on the radio, simulcasting video.
[00:08:35.814 --> 00:08:46.703]  at InfoWarsNews.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and we return every weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern with InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:08:46.703 --> 00:09:01.916]  I want to try to be calm here and then open the phones up to take your phone calls until the bottom of the next hour when Wayne Madsen, journalist, award-winning researcher, former NSA analyst, joins us, National Security Agency analyst, and then Joel Skouzen of World Affairs Brief.
[00:09:03.738 --> 00:09:11.306]  Marine Corps aviator, researcher, nephew of Cleon Skousen, obviously, and the Naked Communist.
[00:09:11.306 --> 00:09:20.537]  He is going to be joining us as well to give us his latest breakdown on all of this.
[00:09:20.537 --> 00:09:23.280]  The big question is, where to begin today?
[00:09:24.457 --> 00:09:35.222]  I told you over the weekend what the big news would be that Glenn Beck was going to be putting out about the Saudi Arabian, and it's that the White House is involved in a cover-up.
[00:09:35.222 --> 00:09:49.750]  Now, they could be doing that cover-up to create a rabbit trail to Saudi Arabia, even though the foreign Saudi press is reporting this Saudi gentleman that was injured, the young man, is hooked into the royal family and did get visited by Michelle Obama.
[00:09:50.942 --> 00:09:59.609]  And there was an emergency meeting with a Saudi foreign minister and the files of this guy are being altered and changed.
[00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:04.854]  That's coming out and they are planning to deport him.
[00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.636]  They are planning to deport them.
[00:10:10.447 --> 00:10:18.933]  So, dead men tell no tales and people deported back to their own country obviously will tell no tales, at least where the media can pick it up here.
[00:10:18.933 --> 00:10:21.855]  Now, all that said, I'm going to address that later.
[00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:25.878]  Because I put a video out on it yesterday, predicted what would be released, because it was already released.
[00:10:25.878 --> 00:10:32.823]  It was already in the news last Friday that the White House is covering the shop and a bunch of other newspapers.
[00:10:32.823 --> 00:10:38.547]  And it's already in the news that the White House is acting very suspicious.
[00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:48.971]  Getting away from that report right now and getting into the big issues that we're looking at right now.
[00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:53.874]  We can punch this up for TV viewers.
[00:10:53.874 --> 00:11:03.859]  The aunt says that the older brother, she says the naked man in the video being seen put in the patrol car is him.
[00:11:05.575 --> 00:11:14.880]  The other brother was partying, and the night before all this happened, like he normally did, drinking and smoking pot and stuff, according to his friends.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.581]  Was not a practicing Muslim, by the way.
[00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:22.184]  But they were pretty full of themselves and had a lot of extra money.
[00:11:22.184 --> 00:11:25.766]  You also, again, now have witnesses in the local news.
[00:11:25.766 --> 00:11:28.447]  These articles and videos are up on Infowars.com.
[00:11:28.447 --> 00:11:32.169]  We're going to be breaking those down.
[00:11:32.169 --> 00:11:33.130]  Saying that
[00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:37.923]  Saying that.
[00:11:42.412 --> 00:11:45.335]  Again, they tend to throw news articles up on screen.
[00:11:45.335 --> 00:11:48.497]  I tend to look at those articles, start reading those articles and getting distracted.
[00:11:48.497 --> 00:11:51.460]  The article I'm going to put up, is my computer punched up right here?
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.101]  Because this is the one I want to put up here.
[00:11:53.101 --> 00:11:56.424]  Yeah, the aunt claims naked man in video is him.
[00:11:56.424 --> 00:12:03.390]  And then you look at the video and you see the face on the person going into the car.
[00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.051]  It looks just like them.
[00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:07.814]  And then you've got other local news.
[00:12:09.673 --> 00:12:18.801]  And witnesses reporting that the police ran him over in the car and sat there pumping rounds into him on the ground.
[00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:22.785]  And if you look at what happened to the other brother, he's reportedly in the boat.
[00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:28.831]  I was listening to the police scanner live five minutes before I went live Friday night at about 6.50.
[00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:32.834]  I went on early because I was listening to police scanner via
[00:12:33.735 --> 00:12:59.178]  Media Ustream, actually watching it, the guy had the Ustream set up there in Boston with the scanners with millions, two million people were listening to it when I was watching it with a camera on the scanner and the police were freaking out that media had gotten into a warehouse across a body of water nearby and were videotaping what was going on with live feeds.
[00:13:00.407 --> 00:13:10.889]  And obviously, you then started seeing that on the news, and then they pumped a bunch of bullets, looks like hundreds of bullets, if you look at the boat, into it, obviously trying to kill him.
[00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:19.511]  Then they get over there, and then the police are panicking, because now, media they tried to keep out had footage of what was happening.
[00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:25.172]  So, they pumped hundreds of rounds in, obviously trying to kill him.
[00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:27.393]  Then he stands up miraculously,
[00:13:29.014 --> 00:13:34.546]  Don't worry though, five minutes later he's being tricked and they're cutting into his throat to save him.
[00:13:36.428 --> 00:13:38.229]  And then they've sedated him.
[00:13:38.229 --> 00:13:43.313]  And then now he's reportedly... And again, all these articles I'm mentioning are up on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:43.313 --> 00:13:50.098]  Then they start interrogating him now, the special national security feds that are there.
[00:13:50.098 --> 00:13:56.103]  These are people on record that will torture children in front of their parents to get fake confessions.
[00:13:56.103 --> 00:14:02.168]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built until four years after he was already in jail.
[00:14:03.308 --> 00:14:06.469]  He might have confessed to killing Jesus 2,000 years ago.
[00:14:06.469 --> 00:14:12.551]  He might have confessed to killing Lincoln and blowing up the Lusitania and firebombing the Reichstag in Germany in 1933.
[00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:19.394]  He might have confessed to, you know, being mean to Santa Claus one Christmas morning.
[00:14:19.394 --> 00:14:24.575]  Again, fake confessions, fake news, fake WMDs, fake, fake, fake.
[00:14:24.575 --> 00:14:28.117]  Now, again, there's so many data points here.
[00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:31.318]  I'm going to try to go over all of these for you, but here's what we know.
[00:14:32.728 --> 00:14:46.145]  The FBI five years ago visited the families of these young men to cover their butts, as they normally do, to create a history and a ledger that they were indeed watching the older brother and then recently the younger brother.
[00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:54.461]  Two and a half years ago, in 2011, they visited them because the Russians blew their cover.
[00:14:54.461 --> 00:14:55.882]  That's what the Russians do.
[00:14:55.882 --> 00:15:03.684]  And said, we're putting in a national security Interpol complaint on these brothers going to Dagestan and going to Chechnya.
[00:15:03.684 --> 00:15:07.085]  And by the way, they're using aliases.
[00:15:07.085 --> 00:15:08.466]  And we know that through Interpol.
[00:15:11.095 --> 00:15:24.080]  Because the West has spent billions of dollars in Dagestan and in Chechnya and in surrounding areas funding what is known as the Jihadi Wahhabist Crescent.
[00:15:25.373 --> 00:15:28.735]  And they have a man known as the Chechen Bin Laden.
[00:15:28.735 --> 00:15:30.837]  Guys, type in Chechen Bin Laden.
[00:15:30.837 --> 00:15:36.621]  This is who, this is who the brothers went to try to make contact with.
[00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:38.943]  And so they could get in and out of the country.
[00:15:38.943 --> 00:15:43.806]  Magically, they were able to get on aircraft and things with fake names.
[00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:45.547]  And now there's a whitewash going on that.
[00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:51.071]  Now, I told you it would end up that they had intelligence connections, not just FBI visits.
[00:15:51.071 --> 00:15:52.012]  Now, you want to go further?
[00:15:52.472 --> 00:15:58.336]  Because this is the biggest piece of the puzzle of hundreds that no one is even talking about.
[00:15:58.336 --> 00:16:01.298]  The FBI had them under surveillance for five years.
[00:16:01.298 --> 00:16:07.763]  Probably CIA or maybe even foreign intelligence running these guys.
[00:16:07.763 --> 00:16:09.444]  Again, who's funding Al Qaeda publicly?
[00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:17.372]  Again, who just gave a hundred plus million dollars last week to the Syrian rebels?
[00:16:17.372 --> 00:16:18.532]  The State Department.
[00:16:18.532 --> 00:16:22.914]  It's over a billion dollars now total in the last two and a half years they've given them publicly.
[00:16:22.914 --> 00:16:26.175]  That's known al-Qaeda being funded to again take over countries.
[00:16:26.175 --> 00:16:27.895]  What is the West doing to Russia?
[00:16:27.895 --> 00:16:33.677]  Radicalizing Muslims but also sending in infiltrators to keep tabs on them and who do they use?
[00:16:33.677 --> 00:16:36.438]  Young men from England and the United States and Germany.
[00:16:37.967 --> 00:16:47.454]  Now, these guys suddenly had money, they suddenly, you know, they were flashy, always dressing like playboys, going through women like they were Cracker Jacks.
[00:16:47.454 --> 00:16:50.576]  These are not practicing Muslims.
[00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:55.540]  And that's why their father says it's a setup, and that they've been set up.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.001]  Do you understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:16:57.001 --> 00:17:03.426]  This is just like Mohammed Adda, you know, at the strip bar two nights before, who it turns out, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.956]  It turns out, ladies and gentlemen, that these guys were absolutely being protected.
[00:17:13.956 --> 00:17:17.540]  So let's go over, let's go over this for everybody here.
[00:17:18.753 --> 00:17:28.081]  The FBI is saying, did not know who they were, here are their photos, help us find them, we don't know who they are, here's video, here's photos.
[00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:29.262]  We don't know who they are.
[00:17:29.262 --> 00:17:41.713]  And I could watch the video and say, there is clearly a Fed putting his earpiece in and talking, because these guys all think they're James Bond, they act overly tough and cool into the role, you see the cops all posing.
[00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:46.539]  Sticking their jaws out as they order citizens out of their houses at gunpoint.
[00:17:46.539 --> 00:17:48.660]  This is all part of drama-queening.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:55.463]  And there's feds, in that video they released, clearly drama-queening, playing the part of secret agent.
[00:17:55.463 --> 00:18:06.007]  When they should have had their shirts hanging out, should have been picking their nose, should have been sitting there with a whiskey bottle, you know, in a bag, and then, like, picked up a phone and dialed it like they were mentally ill.
[00:18:06.007 --> 00:18:07.908]  Then you wouldn't have been spotted, feds.
[00:18:09.349 --> 00:18:14.693]  You should have been sitting there with trash all over the ground, up against that wall with a beer can.
[00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:17.156]  Instead, you're playing secret agent.
[00:18:17.156 --> 00:18:19.177]  I mean, you guys are a joke.
[00:18:19.177 --> 00:18:23.160]  Because it's all part of your template that you've arrived.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:29.205]  I mean, I go to 007 movies and stuff, and like half the theater is filled with cops.
[00:18:29.205 --> 00:18:33.289]  I went to Olympus as Fallen, and it was just full of cops.
[00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:34.050]  Full of cops.
[00:18:34.844 --> 00:18:38.065]  And walking out, I said, hey, you're cops.
[00:18:38.065 --> 00:18:39.686]  And they're like, how do you know that, Jones?
[00:18:39.686 --> 00:18:41.527]  And I'm like, come on.
[00:18:41.527 --> 00:18:42.988]  Look at your body language.
[00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:51.591]  You're in here for your brainwashing download of the imaginary terrorists that are everywhere, and you're Hercules fighting the seven-headed Hydra.
[00:18:53.683 --> 00:19:07.567]  I mean, you're there, in a brainwashing chamber, being brainwashed to be given ancestral programming, psychological programming, of simulated terror attacks that do not exist.
[00:19:07.567 --> 00:19:17.029]  And the cops have, like, tears in their eyes in these movies, and cops are listening, you know you go and do it, and they're all sitting back, watching in the theater, while the real war, by the way, is going on all around you.
[00:19:19.312 --> 00:19:21.714]  You go and you watch Batman fight the terrorist.
[00:19:21.714 --> 00:19:23.776]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:19:23.776 --> 00:19:24.577]  And that's all this is.
[00:19:24.577 --> 00:19:25.798]  So I'm going to try to regroup.
[00:19:25.798 --> 00:19:30.022]  I mean, I'm doing a pretty good job, I think, but it's just my mind is exploding in thousands of directions.
[00:19:30.022 --> 00:19:31.344]  And try to just give you the timeline.
[00:19:31.344 --> 00:19:32.305]  That's probably the best way.
[00:19:34.912 --> 00:19:37.113]  I did a great presentation right before I went live on air.
[00:19:37.113 --> 00:19:43.657]  I had Rob Dew recording me so we could get all the documents together to get me ready for a special report tonight on the nightly news.
[00:19:43.657 --> 00:19:47.280]  And I recorded it onto his iPhone audio of the whole timeline.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.501]  And I just gave dozens of points.
[00:19:49.501 --> 00:19:51.662]  And then once I get on air, I've only gone over basic ones.
[00:19:51.662 --> 00:19:55.665]  But I haven't gotten to the big enchilada yet, or I didn't point it out properly.
[00:19:56.405 --> 00:19:59.850]  They knew who these guys were when they released their photos to you.
[00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:00.971]  Oh, help us.
[00:20:00.971 --> 00:20:03.034]  Here's the only guys you have to look at.
[00:20:03.034 --> 00:20:04.156]  Who are they?
[00:20:04.156 --> 00:20:05.277]  You know who they are.
[00:20:05.277 --> 00:20:07.059]  They were at least double agents.
[00:20:08.595 --> 00:20:10.996]  You've heard about our MRE Smorgasbord.
[00:20:10.996 --> 00:20:19.201]  Now, Long Life Food Depot introduces the most unique, safe, and longest-lasting way to stash emergency food, the EatPod.
[00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:25.705]  Most survival food products recommend an ideal storage environment, including low temps, low moisture, and low oxygen.
[00:20:25.705 --> 00:20:28.106]  If you're storing in a basement, too humid.
[00:20:28.106 --> 00:20:30.147]  Garages and attics, too hot.
[00:20:30.147 --> 00:20:34.690]  But the waterproof, double-walled, high-density polyethylene patent-pending EatPod
[00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:48.353]  is a unique rollaway food bunker that creates the perfect conditions, can be buried up to 30 feet, and can keep your survival food supply safe, secure, dry, and virtually undetectable for 25 years or more.
[00:20:48.353 --> 00:20:54.955]  Get full details on the Eatpod at eatpod.com spelled E-A-T-P-O-D dot com or call 800-601-2833.
[00:20:54.955 --> 00:20:55.215]  That's 800-601-2833.
[00:20:55.215 --> 00:20:56.955]  The Eatpod from Long Life Food Depot.
[00:21:03.897 --> 00:21:07.900]  Since 1983, sending real food to your real future.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.862]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:21:10.862 --> 00:21:15.005]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:21:15.005 --> 00:21:17.286]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:17.286 --> 00:21:22.450]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.271]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:21:24.271 --> 00:21:25.812]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:21:25.812 --> 00:21:27.293]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:21:27.293 --> 00:21:30.335]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:21:30.655 --> 00:21:30.875]  Thank you!

[00:22:14.648 --> 00:22:21.397]  At Silverlungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:36.474]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[00:22:36.474 --> 00:22:43.421]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:22:43.421 --> 00:22:53.832]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera, to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the silver more effectively.

[00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:11.112]  Bills in front of Congress right now could take away your right to keep and bear arms.
[00:23:11.112 --> 00:23:17.314]  If Obama has his way, all guns will be either banned, restricted, or confiscated, possibly by executive order.
[00:23:17.314 --> 00:23:19.675]  The best way to keep your guns is to hide them.
[00:23:19.675 --> 00:23:22.315]  What Obama can't find, Obama can't take away.
[00:23:22.315 --> 00:23:24.716]  You can protect your guns from any threat.

[00:23:36.986 --> 00:23:40.789]  Sergeant Dave Scott, Army Search and Rescue Veteran, wants you to hear this urgent message.
[00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:49.056]  All emergencies have casualties, but in America, most casualties from storms like Katrina and Sandy only happen because good people were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[00:23:49.056 --> 00:23:50.477]  Don't let that happen to you.
[00:23:50.477 --> 00:23:52.999]  Visit YourBugOutPlan.com on the web.
[00:23:52.999 --> 00:23:58.323]  Watch a free video presentation of the skills you need to be long gone before any disaster can touch you.
[00:23:58.323 --> 00:24:01.385]  You owe it to yourself and to your family to watch this.
[00:24:01.385 --> 00:24:04.328]  Head to YourBugOutPlan.com on the web right now.
[00:24:04.328 --> 00:24:05.368]  YourBugOutPlan.com.
[00:24:13.612 --> 00:24:23.037]  This is the end of due process.
[00:24:23.037 --> 00:24:34.544]  The next time one reported gunman is on the street, I guess the police have to lock down an entire city and come door-to-door aiming guns at you and going in your house without a warrant.
[00:24:34.544 --> 00:24:37.286]  That's called public safety.
[00:24:37.286 --> 00:24:39.287]  Actually, it's called martial law.
[00:24:40.865 --> 00:24:41.765]  This is the end.
[00:24:41.765 --> 00:24:45.527]  They sure needed to hunt down both brothers and kill them.
[00:24:45.527 --> 00:24:49.488]  And they sure thought they'd killed him after they pumped hundreds of rounds into the boat.
[00:24:49.488 --> 00:24:55.970]  But unfortunately, I was listening to the police scanner live via Ustream from Boston.
[00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:00.152]  They were like, oh my gosh, the media's got a fix on the boat.
[00:25:00.152 --> 00:25:03.053]  Get in there and get that media out of there.
[00:25:03.053 --> 00:25:06.634]  But then the younger brother
[00:25:09.386 --> 00:25:21.371]  Climbed up out of it and climbed out and so they were unable to, I guess, burn him down or shoot him like they did Dorner to make sure we never find out what really happened.
[00:25:21.371 --> 00:25:26.014]  So then they had to get him down on the ground and do, I guess, a tracheotomy it looked like on him to make sure.
[00:25:26.014 --> 00:25:29.855]  They said he may never be able to talk but he's communicating with investigators.
[00:25:29.855 --> 00:25:32.196]  I'm sure he'll confess very quickly.
[00:25:33.857 --> 00:25:34.337]  They have to.
[00:25:34.337 --> 00:25:37.559]  They'll waterboard his mother in front of him.
[00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:41.442]  And again, I'm not saying they might not have actually been part of the drill, planted something.
[00:25:41.442 --> 00:25:47.146]  They could even be real double-triple agents, as Debka File in Israel is reporting.
[00:25:47.146 --> 00:25:50.208]  But what I told you is now confirmed.
[00:25:50.208 --> 00:25:58.673]  There was a big, fat drill with 400 military, just National Guard, a bunch of other military in plain clothes, FBI, 2,000 police,
[00:26:01.787 --> 00:26:05.830]  On that route, and hundreds of them at the end, and it didn't protect you.
[00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:10.034]  So, I don't want to lose my rights.
[00:26:10.034 --> 00:26:12.075]  And by the way, the martial law isn't what caught him.
[00:26:13.086 --> 00:26:26.133]  It was outside the search cordon area of much of the city, and it turned out finally after the people were allowed out of their lockdown, it's all prison planet training, you know, you're locked down when they stay in the city now.
[00:26:26.133 --> 00:26:29.555]  Don't come out of your homes for your security, terrorists are in the area.
[00:26:29.555 --> 00:26:33.817]  That's how they live in communist and fascist countries.
[00:26:33.817 --> 00:26:39.180]  They just announce when you can't come out of your home or when there's a daytime or nighttime curfew, but it's all for your safety, of course.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.401]  It's all for your safety, of course.
[00:26:41.288 --> 00:26:45.270]  It's all to stop the drug dealers, too, when the government ships the drugs in.
[00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.473]  They create the crisis to offer the solution to run our lives.
[00:26:49.473 --> 00:26:57.338]  And then the neighbor, you know, looks out and sees the boat and sees the blood on it.
[00:26:57.338 --> 00:27:02.001]  And, oh, because the lockdown had been lifted.
[00:27:02.001 --> 00:27:05.983]  He wouldn't dare go out while the lockdown was on.
[00:27:05.983 --> 00:27:08.865]  He sat there and looked at the blood on the boat and everything and waited.
[00:27:09.929 --> 00:27:15.170]  When the lockdown was over, he went out to look and thought he saw somebody in there, so he went and called the police.
[00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.611]  He followed his orders.
[00:27:16.611 --> 00:27:19.692]  Man, I'm telling you, the police announced, you're locked down in Austin.
[00:27:19.692 --> 00:27:21.392]  Do not leave your home.
[00:27:21.392 --> 00:27:21.732]  You know what?
[00:27:21.732 --> 00:27:22.993]  I'm going to go out.
[00:27:22.993 --> 00:27:25.533]  I've had enough of the stinking government.
[00:27:25.533 --> 00:27:27.674]  By the way, you're running Al-Qaeda and everybody knows it.
[00:27:27.674 --> 00:27:29.815]  130-something mil.
[00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:31.455]  You guys pull up this Associated Press.
[00:27:31.455 --> 00:27:33.336]  It's from my stack yesterday.
[00:27:33.336 --> 00:27:38.277]  130-plus mil given to the Syrian rebels last week.
[00:27:39.415 --> 00:27:41.776]  Al-Qaeda murdering Christians en masse.
[00:27:41.776 --> 00:27:44.578]  And then, here's the big smoking gun of a bunch of them.
[00:27:44.578 --> 00:27:45.558]  I'm going to try to walk through this.
[00:27:45.558 --> 00:27:47.219]  I'm going to do the timeline in the next segment.
[00:27:47.219 --> 00:27:51.421]  I'm so wound up today.
[00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:51.601]  U.S.
[00:27:51.601 --> 00:27:55.103]  providing, excuse me, $123 million more in aid.
[00:27:55.103 --> 00:27:57.804]  That's Politico.
[00:27:57.804 --> 00:28:00.686]  I guess the last funding was $130 million.
[00:28:00.686 --> 00:28:05.628]  To Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:05.628 --> 00:28:08.790]  You know, I wish somebody would lock Washington down and we could arrest all the criminals there.
[00:28:12.558 --> 00:28:18.104]  It's one thing the police say, we believe in bank robbers on this block, please don't come out of your home in this area.
[00:28:18.104 --> 00:28:24.452]  But when you lock down an entire, most of a city and then outside the city, it's a joke folks, it's a bunch of grandstanding.
[00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:31.820]  Military coming to your house, coming in, and I've got all these videos up on Infowars.com of pointing guns at people.
[00:28:34.468 --> 00:28:36.069]  And it's all part of their cult.
[00:28:36.069 --> 00:28:38.630]  Government always creates cults of doing what we say.
[00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:43.832]  And finally, every culture says, bring your firstborn up to the temple, we're going to cut their heart out tomorrow.
[00:28:43.832 --> 00:28:45.613]  And people say, government said so.
[00:28:45.613 --> 00:28:50.375]  So you bring your little kid, the Druids, you bring your little kid out to a bonfire.
[00:28:50.375 --> 00:28:52.295]  That's where the term bonfire comes from.
[00:28:52.295 --> 00:28:53.596]  They'd have it sizzling hot.
[00:28:54.582 --> 00:28:58.244]  And they'd grab the kid by the arms and legs, usually like 10-year-olds.
[00:28:58.244 --> 00:29:00.505]  That was one of the most popular with the Druids.
[00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:01.805]  You know, young boy.
[00:29:01.805 --> 00:29:06.928]  And one, two, three!
[00:29:06.928 --> 00:29:12.170]  Throw him into a big fire!
[00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.491]  Isn't that nice?
[00:29:13.491 --> 00:29:14.871]  And government said so.
[00:29:14.871 --> 00:29:16.572]  I mean, they're doing it for your safety.
[00:29:16.572 --> 00:29:18.693]  The crops won't grow if you don't do it.
[00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.352]  When we come back, I'm going to settle down and go through it all.
[00:29:23.352 --> 00:29:27.294]  I've got to just settle down here.
[00:29:27.294 --> 00:29:35.740]  By the way, thousands of nine-month-old babies reportedly butchered until the sewage lines always had to be pumped out with their little parts.
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.360]  And guess who?
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.421]  When I saw this, I didn't believe it.
[00:29:37.421 --> 00:29:38.702]  I went and looked it up, and it's true.
[00:29:38.702 --> 00:29:48.389]  Guess who owns the abortion clinic where they would put babies in the toilet to drown, and they would struggle and try to swim and fight for their lives?
[00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:49.269]  Oh, guess who?
[00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:50.050]  The Attorney General.
[00:29:51.841 --> 00:29:54.283]  Anything dirty and bad, they're involved in it.
[00:29:54.283 --> 00:29:57.365]  Fast and Furious, you know, but they wouldn't be involved in this.
[00:29:57.365 --> 00:29:58.767]  We're on the march.
[00:29:58.767 --> 00:30:01.289]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.289 --> 00:30:03.971]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:12.697 --> 00:30:13.958]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:13.958 --> 00:30:17.841]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:17.841 --> 00:30:20.303]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:20.303 --> 00:30:25.987]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:25.987 --> 00:30:32.672]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:32.672 --> 00:30:38.657]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:38.657 --> 00:30:42.340]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.104]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:47.104 --> 00:30:53.048]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:53.048 --> 00:30:56.611]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:56.611 --> 00:30:58.572]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:58.572 --> 00:30:59.693]  It's here.

[00:31:08.348 --> 00:31:10.229]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:31:10.229 --> 00:31:13.891]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:31:13.891 --> 00:31:18.414]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:31:18.414 --> 00:31:24.538]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:31:24.538 --> 00:31:35.324]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:31:35.524 --> 00:31:38.386]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates!
[00:31:38.386 --> 00:31:42.008]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:31:42.008 --> 00:31:56.737]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:31:57.437 --> 00:32:13.461]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here it is.
[00:32:13.461 --> 00:32:15.141]  The Cal Bend Soap Company.
[00:32:15.141 --> 00:32:20.902]  Alex's staff have been using these all-natural, earth-friendly, pure soaps for years, and they are the best.
[00:32:20.902 --> 00:32:23.243]  See them on the web at www.5starsoap.com.

[00:32:32.526 --> 00:32:39.669]  You'll be getting soap products twice as good as what you're using now at a great price and supporting an American company in the process.
[00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:41.330]  Earth friendly and all American.
[00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:42.150]  We're good to go.
[00:33:11.855 --> 00:33:13.738]  We are on the march.
[00:33:13.738 --> 00:33:16.902]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:16.902 --> 00:33:20.607]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:35.976 --> 00:33:39.759]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:42.921]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:55.209]  And we are showing video to TV viewers of what looks like about 20 police firing en masse with .223s and .308s over
[00:34:01.713 --> 00:34:05.584]  And over and over again into the boat.
[00:34:05.584 --> 00:34:08.934]  And then waiting about an hour and 45 minutes for him to bleed to death.
[00:34:10.785 --> 00:34:15.409]  By the way, there's even more of this footage, but it has cuss words over it, so we're only seeing about half of it.
[00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:23.015]  The sustained fire, where it appears they load and reload their clips three or four times.
[00:34:23.015 --> 00:34:25.577]  Let's be conservative, 15 officers or so.
[00:34:25.577 --> 00:34:28.499]  You can see a whole line of flashes.
[00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:30.481]  It looks about 50 yards.
[00:34:30.481 --> 00:34:34.044]  Firing into the boat, hopefully killing Patsy No. 2.
[00:34:35.665 --> 00:34:40.790]  While telling everyone that they sure wanted him to be alive.
[00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.953]  And then of course you've got the other brother.
[00:34:44.953 --> 00:34:46.955]  You've got the other brother.
[00:34:46.955 --> 00:34:57.164]  Reportedly now witnesses are saying, we have these videos up on Infowars.com, that they saw the police run over him and then fill his body full of holes.
[00:34:57.164 --> 00:35:01.588]  And the aunt and others are saying that it is video of the older brother.
[00:35:04.195 --> 00:35:09.377]  Tamerlan being brought naked into the police car.
[00:35:09.377 --> 00:35:17.401]  And then I guess you just stage a firefight and then say that you killed him.
[00:35:17.401 --> 00:35:22.283]  Again, we're seeing all the signs, just like with Dorner where they said, we're gonna burn this mother effer up.
[00:35:22.283 --> 00:35:24.264]  Yeah, burn down that cabin, burn it down.
[00:35:25.219 --> 00:35:30.200]  And then, okay, we've got the fire, placing the fire, it's on fire, good, mission completed, we burn him down.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.560]  And a big celebration.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.681]  And then we reported it, and the news said, Jones is a conspiracy theorist.
[00:35:35.681 --> 00:35:38.642]  There is no audio of them saying burn it down.
[00:35:38.642 --> 00:35:40.343]  That was that night.
[00:35:40.343 --> 00:35:47.664]  Then the next day they said, well, they said burn down the cabin, burn that mother effer down, but that doesn't mean burn it.
[00:35:47.664 --> 00:35:49.365]  Now, who's the conspiracy theorist?
[00:35:49.365 --> 00:35:50.665]  Who's the liar?
[00:35:50.665 --> 00:35:51.305]  And who isn't?
[00:35:51.305 --> 00:35:54.326]  You all heard them on six different feeds.
[00:35:55.532 --> 00:36:01.197]  Three different individuals talking about burning the mother effer down.
[00:36:01.197 --> 00:36:14.028]  And it is the same story here, here yet again, here yet again today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:14.028 --> 00:36:20.053]  We are seeing the same thing happen
[00:36:21.343 --> 00:36:23.345]  With continued rapidity.
[00:36:23.345 --> 00:36:27.629]  Now, again, here's the giant trillion pound enchilada.
[00:36:27.629 --> 00:36:36.619]  They told you, here's the photos, we've got to show you these photos, we've got to go over these photos, because we don't know who these people are.
[00:36:37.831 --> 00:36:44.154]  And we need your help finding them, but don't look at any of the other photos of the obvious drill and obvious other patsies.
[00:36:44.154 --> 00:36:48.716]  And they've come out now, the FBI, and said, we didn't want people looking at other stuff.
[00:36:48.716 --> 00:36:50.137]  It was going to cause a problem.
[00:36:50.137 --> 00:36:51.657]  Oh, yes, I know it was.
[00:36:51.657 --> 00:36:53.898]  Because you'd lied about there being a drill.
[00:36:53.898 --> 00:36:58.540]  And they're lying to people saying they didn't know who they were.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.721]  Here are the articles.
[00:37:00.721 --> 00:37:02.742]  Boston bomber.
[00:37:02.742 --> 00:37:06.324]  FBI dropped the ball over
[00:37:08.612 --> 00:37:20.655]  Tamerlan, the FBI was alerted by Russian security services to serious new concerns about one of the Boston bomb suspects as recently as November.
[00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:31.177]  It was claimed on Sunday night and since then the FBI has indeed admitted to all of that.
[00:37:31.177 --> 00:37:35.618]  And of course they were talking to their family about them for five years.
[00:37:35.618 --> 00:37:36.998]  The Russians blew their cover
[00:37:38.578 --> 00:37:44.083]  Two and a half years ago saying, why are you letting these guys go in and out of these terrorist-controlled areas?
[00:37:44.083 --> 00:37:46.485]  We think this guy's suspicious.
[00:37:46.485 --> 00:37:47.105]  They should.
[00:37:47.105 --> 00:38:00.317]  Kurt Nimmo wrote an article about it on Sunday, actually Saturday, about the State Department funding billions of dollars to the Bin Laden of Chechnya that this gentleman
[00:38:01.499 --> 00:38:06.948]  Brother number one, the older dead brother, dead men tell no tales, that he reportedly worked with.
[00:38:06.948 --> 00:38:09.352]  So, he reportedly was under the influence.
[00:38:10.816 --> 00:38:20.081]  And was inspired by Chechen warlord on State Department payroll, who the FBI had been following and talking to now for five years.
[00:38:20.081 --> 00:38:21.142]  Five years.
[00:38:21.142 --> 00:38:21.742]  Five years.
[00:38:21.742 --> 00:38:28.586]  By the way, the family said five years before they admitted two and a half years, and now five years is confirmed.
[00:38:28.586 --> 00:38:31.327]  So, they were on these guys forever.
[00:38:31.327 --> 00:38:39.532]  But they released photos and videos saying, gee, we don't know who they are, when you can see feds watching them in the doorway as they walk by.
[00:38:40.748 --> 00:38:43.650]  Was Boston Bomber Inspired by Russia's Bin Laden?
[00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:50.895]  Mother Claims FBI Tracked Older Brother for 5 Years After Told by Moscow of Links to Chechen Terrorist.
[00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:53.778]  Well, yeah, Moscow was blowing his cover.
[00:38:53.778 --> 00:39:02.164]  That's how agencies get rid of somebody without killing them and starting a new Cold War, is they simply say, hey, here's your agents, knock it off.
[00:39:02.164 --> 00:39:04.025]  Now, it gets worse.
[00:39:04.025 --> 00:39:06.207]  Here is the Huffington Post and here is Politico.
[00:39:07.279 --> 00:39:09.141]  But they hide this in plain view.
[00:39:09.141 --> 00:39:17.748]  Representative Mike Rogers, Tamerlan may have traveled to Russia under an alias.
[00:39:17.748 --> 00:39:21.311]  Under an alias.
[00:39:21.311 --> 00:39:26.995]  Mike Rogers, the older brother, may have traveled to Russia under an alias.
[00:39:26.995 --> 00:39:29.017]  And it's not really Russia.
[00:39:29.017 --> 00:39:29.557]  It's to...
[00:39:30.876 --> 00:39:41.866]  Uzbekistan and to Chechnya, and the Russians came and said, this guy, this guy looks like he's one of your people, get him out of here.
[00:39:41.866 --> 00:39:45.329]  Lindsey Graham says, wrong name, hid the Russia trip.
[00:39:45.329 --> 00:39:53.296]  Oh, the senator is helping us understand exactly, exactly why that happened.
[00:39:53.296 --> 00:39:54.737]  It is so frustrating.
[00:39:54.737 --> 00:39:56.719]  I mean, can't there ever be a bombing where
[00:39:58.494 --> 00:40:08.980]  Let me show TV viewers, and for radio listeners, I will simply give you the headline on this.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.862]  You can see it all for yourself.
[00:40:11.862 --> 00:40:17.505]  Chair Expert, London Bombings Mastermind is MI6 Asset.
[00:40:17.505 --> 00:40:18.825]  We have that article saved.
[00:40:18.825 --> 00:40:19.646]  It was from the London
[00:40:20.925 --> 00:40:24.407]  Daily Telegraph, and then there's Fox News under it.
[00:40:24.407 --> 00:40:27.650]  You just search MI6 agent, 7-7 bombings.
[00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:31.152]  7-7 London bomber, MI6 agent.
[00:40:31.152 --> 00:40:36.656]  That was, by the way, John Loftus, former head of counterterrorism for the FBI.
[00:40:36.656 --> 00:40:41.719]  Oh, so there's just some of the headlines.
[00:40:41.719 --> 00:40:44.802]  Democratic underground, London bombing mastermind, an MI6 agent.
[00:40:48.616 --> 00:40:53.862]  Daily Mail MI6 told agent it couldn't kill Al-Qaeda.
[00:40:53.862 --> 00:40:59.469]  London bombing ringleader Haroon Rashid Aswad, double agent.
[00:40:59.469 --> 00:41:01.491]  He wasn't a double agent.
[00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:06.116]  He was allowed to fly in and out of the country for years after the bombing and it turned out is an MI6
[00:41:08.354 --> 00:41:09.415]  Officer.
[00:41:09.415 --> 00:41:10.716]  Not an asset.
[00:41:10.716 --> 00:41:11.756]  Not an agent.
[00:41:11.756 --> 00:41:13.137]  An officer.
[00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:14.158]  Let me say it again.
[00:41:14.158 --> 00:41:23.143]  An officer of MI6 commanded, commanded, to quote Destro, all you cops think you're G.I.
[00:41:23.143 --> 00:41:26.445]  Joe, you actually work for COBRA.
[00:41:26.445 --> 00:41:29.067]  But look how simple that is.
[00:41:29.067 --> 00:41:31.908]  That you work for COBRA.
[00:41:31.908 --> 00:41:36.231]  And you don't even know it.
[00:41:36.231 --> 00:41:37.712]  The government is COBRA.
[00:41:40.728 --> 00:41:47.290]  We here at Cobra sew chaos to bring order and weapon sales.
[00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:49.891]  See, it's all a big joke, all in your face.
[00:41:49.891 --> 00:41:52.831]  Look how the police dress like Cobra.
[00:41:52.831 --> 00:41:55.692]  And all the children watching that, everybody thought Cobra was cooler.
[00:41:55.692 --> 00:41:57.633]  You were all being imprinted.
[00:41:57.633 --> 00:41:59.893]  All being imprinted with predictive programming.
[00:41:59.893 --> 00:42:01.394]  Cobra brings in a world government.
[00:42:01.394 --> 00:42:04.635]  Cobra gets rid of gold, brings in cashless systems.
[00:42:04.635 --> 00:42:06.835]  Cobra brainwashes kids through television.
[00:42:06.835 --> 00:42:08.556]  Have you watched those old 80s cartoons?
[00:42:09.363 --> 00:42:13.024]  Cobra currency.
[00:42:13.024 --> 00:42:14.785]  Hail Cobra!
[00:42:14.785 --> 00:42:16.746]  That's what the intelligence agencies are.
[00:42:16.746 --> 00:42:31.191]  They run the narcotics, they run the snuff films, they run the little kids, they run all of it, and they get caught running all of it, and it doesn't even matter, and they get caught running these guys, and I said, whoever these patsies are, they're gonna kill them.
[00:42:31.191 --> 00:42:31.952]  But they pumped.
[00:42:31.952 --> 00:42:33.432]  I don't know.
[00:42:33.432 --> 00:42:34.593]  If you blow that video up,
[00:42:35.543 --> 00:42:36.304]  Where they're shooting.
[00:42:36.304 --> 00:42:39.288]  It goes on for about 40 seconds.
[00:42:39.288 --> 00:42:45.838]  And there's a line of guns that looks like it's about 50 yards long.
[00:42:45.838 --> 00:42:46.659]  Back through the trees.
[00:42:46.659 --> 00:42:47.540]  You can see the flashes.
[00:42:48.749 --> 00:43:05.040]  And you can tell, they're firing from drums, they're firing from 30-round mags, and you can see some of the guns stopping for a second, two seconds as they reload, firing, firing, probably 60 rounds to 100 rounds per person into that boat.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.023]  And folks, show the bullet-ridden boat.
[00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:14.780]  Just type in bullet ridden boat or the terrorist boat.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:22.082]  And I mean there are bullet holes from 308 and 223 every half inch of the entire boat.
[00:43:22.082 --> 00:43:24.402]  Now what was the mission there?
[00:43:24.402 --> 00:43:29.463]  Did they go pump tear gas in and say come out with your hands up?
[00:43:29.463 --> 00:43:33.124]  By the way, the witnesses say he didn't shoot at them with his quote carbine.
[00:43:33.124 --> 00:43:37.485]  He was hiding in there and they pulled up and they unloaded.
[00:43:40.612 --> 00:43:43.113]  Because they were told, kill him.
[00:43:43.113 --> 00:43:46.034]  That's why they told the media, you cover this, we're gonna kill you.
[00:43:46.034 --> 00:43:49.696]  That's why they told citizens, you come out of your house, you're dead.
[00:43:49.696 --> 00:43:59.740]  Alright, you know, let me just do this, let me just take calls, and when I start the next hour, I'll do the timeline.
[00:44:01.618 --> 00:44:04.961]  I actually wrote some notes on this, and it's just so frustrating.
[00:44:04.961 --> 00:44:08.324]  But is anybody going to call the FBI on the big elephant in the room?
[00:44:08.324 --> 00:44:11.187]  They lied for five years, not two and a half.
[00:44:11.187 --> 00:44:12.608]  They knew who these guys were.
[00:44:12.608 --> 00:44:17.732]  And these guys clearly had fake identification and were allowed to travel in and out under aliases.
[00:44:17.732 --> 00:44:18.974]  I've interviewed the head of the U.S.
[00:44:18.974 --> 00:44:22.317]  Embassy visa section, Springman, look it up.
[00:44:22.317 --> 00:44:26.941]  Toronto Star was the first to break it in 2001, where they were ordered to let
[00:44:28.376 --> 00:44:42.703]  Mohammed Adda and the other 14 hijackers from Saudi Arabia back into the US, they were flagged as terrorists and they said we're not letting them in and the State Department had the CIA call them and say those are our agents, our assets, they're not terrorists, that's their cover.
[00:44:42.703 --> 00:44:57.091]  And then we've got Lieutenant Colonel Butler, the head of the Defense Language School at the time, going on the news, going to the newspaper and saying, five of the hijackers were in my school, Mohammed Adda and two others were in my class for a year.
[00:44:58.399 --> 00:45:02.960]  Two semesters at the Defense Language School, two years before 9-11.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.260]  He knew Mohammed Adda.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:10.662]  He drank coffee with Mohammed Adda at the commissary and had lunch with him.
[00:45:10.662 --> 00:45:18.083]  Mohammed Adda sat two rows back for two semesters.
[00:45:18.083 --> 00:45:22.204]  And all the colonel said is, folks, the government was involved in this.
[00:45:22.204 --> 00:45:23.964]  These guys are patsies.
[00:45:23.964 --> 00:45:25.605]  Those hijackers on the news,
[00:45:26.832 --> 00:45:28.173]  Are U.S.
[00:45:28.173 --> 00:45:31.795]  government trained?
[00:45:31.795 --> 00:45:34.817]  Now that's San Jose Mercury News.
[00:45:34.817 --> 00:45:36.438]  That's Associated Press.
[00:45:36.438 --> 00:45:45.844]  If the media is listening, before all the White House organs, because, look, I know you work for the White House Media Matters and all the rest of you, it's on record you do, but most of you aren't real terrorists.
[00:45:45.844 --> 00:45:47.845]  Most of you aren't real criminal globalists.
[00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:49.546]  You probably wouldn't, you know, hurt
[00:45:49.986 --> 00:45:53.087]  The neighbor's dog, if you were offered a million dollars.
[00:45:53.087 --> 00:45:56.309]  But see, just denying all this doesn't make you not guilty.
[00:45:56.309 --> 00:46:03.431]  When you sit here and go, Alex the Crazy says the government ran the 9-11 hijackers, I don't know what really happened once they got on those airplanes.
[00:46:03.431 --> 00:46:08.954]  All I know is there was a stand-down ordered at NORAD, and whether it's 7-7,
[00:46:10.677 --> 00:46:26.623]  The London bombings, whether it's the Madrid bombings on 333 in 2003, whether it is 9-11, whether it is this event, whether it is the bombings in Afghanistan where the President comes out and says, yeah, your government is staging these terror attacks and runs Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:26.623 --> 00:46:28.644]  Well, that all came out years ago.
[00:46:28.644 --> 00:46:31.425]  They took, here's the toll-free number, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:46:31.425 --> 00:46:32.325]  They took, they took,
[00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:52.144]  11 to 14 year olds and made them dig ditches around Kabul and the other two or three big cities in Afghanistan.
[00:46:53.228 --> 00:46:57.550]  And then they, under Al-Qaeda orders, put them out there and then the U.S.
[00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:02.412]  going in there with NATO did not attack any of the bases, any of the cities.
[00:47:02.412 --> 00:47:06.473]  And if you go back to the time that was in the news, why aren't they targeting the leadership?
[00:47:06.473 --> 00:47:10.875]  They went and put innocent conscripts in there for a simulated attack.
[00:47:10.875 --> 00:47:13.236]  Because Al-Qaeda and Taliban worked for the U.S.
[00:47:13.236 --> 00:47:14.136]  on record.
[00:47:14.136 --> 00:47:18.698]  This all came out, it's called the Airlift of Evil, and they killed tens of thousands of children.
[00:47:19.358 --> 00:47:29.908]  That they gave AK-47s to fight Puff the Magic Dragon C-130s and drones and the rest of it, and they blew them all up as a simulation.
[00:47:29.908 --> 00:47:31.350]  They were just part of a simulation.
[00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.552]  They were real, dying.
[00:47:33.552 --> 00:47:35.694]  Then, U.S.
[00:47:35.694 --> 00:47:36.335]  troops go in.
[00:47:36.335 --> 00:47:37.596]  They're not part of the cover story.
[00:47:37.596 --> 00:47:38.977]  They're just told what to do.
[00:47:38.977 --> 00:47:41.480]  And Taliban and Al-Qaeda turn themselves in.
[00:47:42.756 --> 00:47:48.400]  They're loaded on C-130s, given chests of gold and weapons, and U.S.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:58.747]  colonels, one colonel in special forces went public, the San Francisco Chronicle, said, we were ordered to fly 30,000 to 40,000 of them over the mountains into Pakistan and give them weapons and gold.
[00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:02.745]  They showed up, I give up!
[00:48:02.745 --> 00:48:05.406]  Now give me gold!
[00:48:05.406 --> 00:48:08.188]  Give me gold now, and rocket launcher!
[00:48:08.188 --> 00:48:14.031]  You want us to take out Pakistan, so you have excuse to... I'm giving a Russian accent, whatever.
[00:48:14.031 --> 00:48:16.552]  We'll do it for you!
[00:48:16.552 --> 00:48:18.514]  And we grow opium, yes!
[00:48:18.514 --> 00:48:20.535]  See, a faction of the Taliban was real.
[00:48:21.275 --> 00:48:30.637]  And had cut opium production from 90% of world production in 2000, or 1999, to about 2001, it was 9% of world opium production.
[00:48:30.637 --> 00:48:36.618]  Within a couple years, back to 93% of world opium production.
[00:48:36.618 --> 00:48:37.258]  800-259-9231.
[00:48:37.258 --> 00:48:40.698]  And let's launch the phone system for me, guys.
[00:48:40.698 --> 00:48:41.919]  Thank you.
[00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:44.779]  Now, that's a daily drill.
[00:48:44.779 --> 00:48:49.100]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:48:53.991 --> 00:49:16.770]  I see the same story like Groundhog Day, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, and then it comes out they've got aliases, it comes out they're being protected, it comes out they're bragging to people that they're hot shots, they're driving around with their buddies in cars that says terrorista on the license plate.
[00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:19.012]  I mean this is rock star party time.
[00:49:21.092 --> 00:49:30.254]  And their dad comes out and says they were being handled for five years by intelligence groups.
[00:49:30.254 --> 00:49:43.036]  And I said Monday, before all this happened, I said, if somebody asks you to be part of a drill, invites you out to be part of a drill, it doesn't matter if the drill is even announced, they may blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[00:49:43.036 --> 00:49:44.816]  Do not take a bag.
[00:49:44.816 --> 00:49:46.177]  Do not be part of a drill.
[00:49:46.177 --> 00:49:46.757]  That's what happened on 7-7.
[00:49:49.178 --> 00:49:52.701]  That's what happened on the first World Trade Center attack in 1993.
[00:49:52.701 --> 00:50:03.589]  It came out in the New York Times that the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, set up the guys, gave them the detonator, and some evidence shows they thought they were part of the drill.
[00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:09.954]  We know the guy the FBI hired to cook the bomb was told it was a drill, and he goes, well, I thought it was supposed to be a dummy bomb.
[00:50:09.954 --> 00:50:11.094]  No, it's a real bomb.
[00:50:11.094 --> 00:50:12.876]  Here's the materials.
[00:50:12.876 --> 00:50:14.117]  Now here's a real detonator.
[00:50:15.396 --> 00:50:16.676]  Okay, now tomorrow's the bombing.
[00:50:16.676 --> 00:50:17.657]  Bust them.
[00:50:17.657 --> 00:50:19.617]  No, we're going to pull you off the case now.
[00:50:19.617 --> 00:50:22.058]  You're going to let the bombing go forward?
[00:50:22.058 --> 00:50:26.399]  We're going to let them park it and then stop them.
[00:50:26.399 --> 00:50:33.042]  And the CIA asset went, Ahmad Salam said, I think you're trying to set me up.
[00:50:33.042 --> 00:50:35.642]  I don't want to be part of this evil.
[00:50:35.642 --> 00:50:37.163]  And they said, just do what you're told.
[00:50:39.363 --> 00:50:40.204]  Do what you're told.
[00:50:40.204 --> 00:50:41.405]  The transcripts came out in court.
[00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:44.147]  A bunch of it got declared national security.
[00:50:44.147 --> 00:50:45.708]  Do what you're told.
[00:50:45.708 --> 00:50:52.494]  And you can imagine them telling the patsies, do what you're told, drop off these bags.
[00:50:52.494 --> 00:50:56.317]  You want more money for your girlfriends, don't you?
[00:50:56.317 --> 00:51:00.700]  Mr. Hot Shot, Mr. Movie Star with your cool sunglasses.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:04.303]  And then once their cover got blown, the mission was kill them.
[00:51:04.303 --> 00:51:05.484]  Kill them.
[00:51:05.484 --> 00:51:06.505]  Execute them.
[00:51:06.505 --> 00:51:07.086]  Get rid of them.
[00:51:08.427 --> 00:51:10.388]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:51:10.388 --> 00:51:12.770]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:18.773]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:51:18.773 --> 00:51:22.236]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:51:22.236 --> 00:51:26.118]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:51:26.118 --> 00:51:27.499]  The fact is, you are.
[00:51:27.499 --> 00:51:28.519]  We all are.
[00:51:28.519 --> 00:51:30.841]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[00:54:40.375 --> 00:54:49.663]  While we're busy, distracted by the bombing and the martial law rollout that is happening, while all of that's going on, what else is unfolding?
[00:54:51.024 --> 00:54:59.950]  CISPA that openly censors and tracks the internet and gets rid of the Fourth Amendment for an electronic technotronic tyranny.
[00:54:59.950 --> 00:55:04.272]  That's been rammed through the House, ramming into the Senate, unprecedented evil.
[00:55:04.272 --> 00:55:10.797]  Open border promotion, total legalization, amnesty, you name it, 800 plus pages.
[00:55:10.797 --> 00:55:12.638]  A bunch of other draconian garbage.
[00:55:14.795 --> 00:55:17.136]  Is going on while we're all distracted by this.
[00:55:17.136 --> 00:55:22.258]  And again, babies are being aborted everywhere, including babies that can be adopted.
[00:55:22.258 --> 00:55:24.159]  But oh, the media doesn't cry for them.
[00:55:24.159 --> 00:55:26.300]  The media doesn't get sad for them.
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:33.284]  It's only these three people that are dead, which they use as psychological trauma to scare everyone.
[00:55:34.324 --> 00:55:36.605]  into going along with this tyranny.
[00:55:36.605 --> 00:55:39.905]  By the way, we're almost sold out of the March issue of Welcome to Planet Hoax.
[00:55:39.905 --> 00:55:48.908]  If you want to buy it in bulk, it exposes stage terror, the fraud that they don't want our guns, the fraud that they're not buying bullets, and so much more.
[00:55:48.908 --> 00:55:53.709]  If you want the issue of the magazine in bulk at cost, order it now at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:55:55.009 --> 00:55:57.750]  Or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:01.332]  And also we've got all the water filters discounted.
[00:56:01.332 --> 00:56:05.433]  The very best water filters out there like ProPure with promo code WATER.
[00:56:05.433 --> 00:56:09.735]  It's 10% off the already lowest price at infowarestore.com.
[00:56:09.735 --> 00:56:14.076]  We have all the pro second amendment t-shirts, you name it.
[00:56:14.076 --> 00:56:22.840]  By the way, something I haven't gotten to yet, California gun confiscation bill passes, approves 24 million to expedite gun confiscation.
[00:56:24.591 --> 00:56:28.992]  By the way, that's not my headline, that's the Huffington Post.
[00:56:28.992 --> 00:56:32.694]  They're very excited about the gun confiscation.
[00:56:32.694 --> 00:56:34.574]  But nobody's coming for your guns.
[00:56:34.574 --> 00:56:36.355]  So that's coming up.
[00:56:36.355 --> 00:56:43.677]  Also, again, the baby was swimming and fighting for its life in the toilet as they tried to basically cram it down the toilet.
[00:56:43.677 --> 00:56:48.118]  They got too lazy to even chop the babies up and people are like, you know, we don't want to hear this, it's so horrible.
[00:56:48.118 --> 00:56:49.939]  Well, hearing it, how about doing it?
[00:56:53.884 --> 00:56:56.386]  And then people on the YouTube video did about her like, so what?
[00:56:56.386 --> 00:56:58.427]  Get out of a woman's life!
[00:56:58.427 --> 00:57:00.489]  It's a nine-month-old baby.
[00:57:00.489 --> 00:57:07.333]  There's more people that want to adopt than actually there are abortions every year.
[00:57:07.333 --> 00:57:13.397]  It would be better for the woman just to have the baby medically.
[00:57:13.397 --> 00:57:17.060]  It increases women's chance of getting cancer.
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:18.781]  And I just sit there and I watch how
[00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:20.550]  Yeah.
[00:57:32.978 --> 00:57:37.961]  And they sit there and, you know, say, oh, the baby was exercising in the toilet.
[00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:44.864]  I saw comments on Infowars.com about get out of a woman's, you know, bedroom.
[00:57:44.864 --> 00:57:47.486]  Let the baby get exercise in the toilet.
[00:57:47.486 --> 00:57:58.252]  You know, I bet you wouldn't have the nerve to sit there and chop those babies up on that table like like hamburger or like barbecue.
[00:57:58.252 --> 00:58:02.334]  I bet you wouldn't have the nerve to throw that baby in the toilet and watch it struggle for its life and drowned.
[00:58:05.833 --> 00:58:09.336]  It's part of this disconnected decadence that's overtaken our country.
[00:58:09.336 --> 00:58:12.858]  Where the very same people say ban eating meat because it's bad to animals.
[00:58:12.858 --> 00:58:17.681]  And they call it cruel if someone butchers their own chicken.
[00:58:17.681 --> 00:58:18.762]  They're so disconnected.
[00:58:18.762 --> 00:58:25.107]  I see PETA all the time saying arrest people that butcher their own chickens or whatever for animal cruelty.
[00:58:25.107 --> 00:58:27.888]  See, they think you're butchering a chicken because you're cruel.
[00:58:27.888 --> 00:58:32.452]  Not because you've been raised to do it yourself.
[00:58:32.452 --> 00:58:34.373]  So they care about animals but not about humans.
[00:58:37.512 --> 00:58:41.415]  Then of course it's the environmentalists that have said kill babies up to age three for the earth.
[00:58:41.415 --> 00:58:50.883]  Oh, but they want us to turn our guns in and ban black powder now because of what happened at the Boston Marathon.
[00:58:50.883 --> 00:58:54.846]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:02.004]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:59:02.004 --> 00:59:08.048]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:59:08.048 --> 00:59:11.931]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[00:59:11.931 --> 00:59:13.532]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[00:59:13.532 --> 00:59:17.315]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[00:59:17.975 --> 00:59:20.697]  Go to GetSimplySafe.com.
[00:59:20.697 --> 00:59:23.419]  Simply Safe is independent and off the grid.
[00:59:23.419 --> 00:59:27.783]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.
[00:59:27.783 --> 00:59:34.448]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer, storage unit, or shed.
[00:59:34.448 --> 00:59:35.949]  GetSimplySafe.com.

[00:59:41.433 --> 00:59:44.155]  So there's no need to let a stranger into your home.
[00:59:44.155 --> 00:59:48.238]  If you move or need to relocate, you can take the system with you wherever you go.
[00:59:48.238 --> 00:59:55.262]  You aren't always at home, but SimplySafe will stand guard, protecting your property 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:59:55.262 --> 00:59:57.404]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com
[01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:03.582]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:03.582 --> 01:00:12.947]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.947 --> 01:00:14.248]  Big Brother.
[01:00:14.248 --> 01:00:16.029]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:17.770]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:19.371]  You want answers?
[01:00:19.371 --> 01:00:20.931]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:25.094]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:25.094 --> 01:00:29.176]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.199 --> 01:00:39.044]  One thing is certainly clear, there is a massive cover-up going on surrounding the bombings of last Monday.
[01:00:39.044 --> 01:00:45.789]  And another thing, sure, politically, they're going to use this to try to ban black powder or restrict its purchase.
[01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:48.171]  Again, somebody does something bad, so we all lose our rights.
[01:00:48.171 --> 01:00:50.012]  That's called authoritarianism.
[01:00:50.012 --> 01:00:52.314]  You don't punish the individual, you punish the group.
[01:00:54.426 --> 01:00:58.769]  And one thing's also for sure, they used this for a martial law takeover drill.
[01:00:58.769 --> 01:01:00.010]  Absolutely disgusting.
[01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:03.952]  And they first said they were shooting rubber bullets into the boat, but they were real bullets.
[01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:04.653]  That's now admitted.
[01:01:04.653 --> 01:01:08.455]  And so we're going to be breaking all of this down.
[01:01:08.455 --> 01:01:11.917]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:01:11.917 --> 01:01:17.041]  Too bad for the anti-gun people that tried to blame conservatives for this.
[01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:18.902]  That was what they were going to go with.
[01:01:18.902 --> 01:01:21.784]  Report suspects not licensed to own guns.
[01:01:23.485 --> 01:01:27.069]  Uh, so, uh, I guess in that area you gotta have a bunch of licenses to get them.
[01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:30.011]  Didn't stop them, never stops anybody who's bad.
[01:01:30.011 --> 01:01:32.454]  You could ban all the guns for citizens today.
[01:01:32.454 --> 01:01:37.458]  Anybody could walk up to a cop with a ball-peen hammer, beat their brains out.
[01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:42.123]  It's easy, just bam, ball-peen hammer, you're out, hit them twice more in the temple, they're dead, take the weapon.
[01:01:44.687 --> 01:01:49.589]  That's why they hate veterans, the globalist hate veterans, because veterans know how easy it is to kill and have the initiative.
[01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:55.052]  They don't have the chicken neck, you know, ideas about it.
[01:01:55.052 --> 01:01:58.934]  Man, I tell you, being a domesticated, servile country now is really painful.
[01:01:58.934 --> 01:01:59.994]  But see, there's a problem.
[01:01:59.994 --> 01:02:01.855]  A bunch of us aren't servile.
[01:02:01.855 --> 01:02:04.056]  A bunch of us aren't brainwashed and cattle.
[01:02:04.056 --> 01:02:06.237]  A bunch of us know what's going on.
[01:02:06.237 --> 01:02:10.279]  Does it matter if you can get 51% to vote to take our guns or make us slaves again?
[01:02:10.279 --> 01:02:11.480]  It isn't going to work.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.221]  Nick in Nevada, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:02:14.881 --> 01:02:15.601]  Yes, Alex.
[01:02:15.601 --> 01:02:21.322]  First of all, I just want to say that it is a truly honor and a privilege to finally get through and to talk to you on air.
[01:02:21.322 --> 01:02:25.923]  I've been waiting a long time to be able to get this opportunity, and I just want to say thank you.
[01:02:25.923 --> 01:02:27.243]  Please don't thank me.
[01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.003]  What's the info?
[01:02:29.003 --> 01:02:32.704]  Well, we are living in September 11, 2001 all over again.
[01:02:32.704 --> 01:02:37.065]  We're seeing senators and presidents being sent letters, placed with chemicals.
[01:02:37.065 --> 01:02:44.006]  We're seeing suspicious packages left everywhere, and all the mind control and all the fear-mongering that they put on the people.
[01:02:44.545 --> 01:02:49.487]  Is all for the purpose of having full control over everybody.
[01:02:49.487 --> 01:02:57.870]  And now we're seeing it on a larger scale with the takedown and the takeover of Boston and the complete, you know, martial law.
[01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:00.111]  And it's going to spread throughout the entire country.
[01:03:00.111 --> 01:03:03.092]  As they said, they will have more stage events coming up.
[01:03:03.092 --> 01:03:06.593]  And obviously they're going to, you know, they have gone this far.
[01:03:06.593 --> 01:03:07.914]  Who's to say that they can't go any further.
[01:03:07.914 --> 01:03:10.895]  And for anybody out there who thinks that the FBI does not set up
[01:03:11.334 --> 01:03:15.836]  These staged events is out of their minds as the proof and the evidence is everywhere.
[01:03:15.836 --> 01:03:19.398]  And as they've come out and told us flat out, you know, to our faces.
[01:03:19.398 --> 01:03:30.444]  And I remember also, too, a couple weeks ago, you mentioned how, you know, more people need to stand up and more people need to bring awareness and talk about the new world order and to shed the light on the people.
[01:03:30.444 --> 01:03:33.686]  And I just want to say that I started my own podcast as well.
[01:03:33.686 --> 01:03:35.867]  And if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to give that out on your show.
[01:03:36.554 --> 01:03:45.661]  Sure, listen, I think it's good that you're doing that, and I always let people plug their shows here, because my goal is to do that, but if we all just plug on my show, it only then
[01:04:02.503 --> 01:04:02.763]  Yeah.
[01:04:22.049 --> 01:04:28.151]  Informed about our number one enemy, the globalists, that are staging events and provocateuring events to take our liberties.
[01:04:28.151 --> 01:04:29.372]  You need to go to churches.
[01:04:29.372 --> 01:04:31.453]  You need to get on the radio locally.
[01:04:31.453 --> 01:04:43.297]  You need to start with an access TV show to point people at your alternative media system to grow that so that everybody's reaching people outside of who we've already woken up.
[01:04:43.297 --> 01:04:44.077]  But God bless you.
[01:04:44.077 --> 01:04:45.778]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:04:45.778 --> 01:04:48.459]  Yeah, this broadcast is reaching conservatively now.
[01:04:49.827 --> 01:04:52.488]  Fifteen million people a week, one way or another.
[01:04:52.488 --> 01:05:00.152]  And last week, it was more like, let's not exaggerate, fifty million people.
[01:05:00.152 --> 01:05:04.315]  We've had like ten million extra YouTube views just on our YouTube channel.
[01:05:04.315 --> 01:05:06.696]  InfoWars has probably gotten thirty million extra visitors.
[01:05:08.732 --> 01:05:09.793]  I had tried everything.
[01:05:09.793 --> 01:05:15.275]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:05:15.275 --> 01:05:20.097]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:05:20.097 --> 01:05:26.480]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:38.189]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:05:38.189 --> 01:05:42.653]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:05:42.653 --> 01:05:48.918]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:05:48.918 --> 01:05:50.059]  Now that's results!
[01:05:50.479 --> 01:06:02.982]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[01:06:02.982 --> 01:06:05.543]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[01:06:05.543 --> 01:06:08.803]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:06:08.803 --> 01:06:14.645]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:22.317]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[01:06:22.317 --> 01:06:33.284]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce NanoSilver solutions, our 2-ounce NanoSilver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[01:06:33.284 --> 01:06:35.246]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[01:06:37.387 --> 01:06:44.333]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:55.601]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:09.776]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:12.178]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:07:12.178 --> 01:07:17.642]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:21.685]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:07:21.685 --> 01:07:25.628]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:07:25.628 --> 01:07:27.009]  The fact is, you are.
[01:07:27.009 --> 01:07:28.030]  We all are.
[01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:30.372]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:07:30.672 --> 01:07:39.219]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.

[01:07:44.083 --> 01:07:46.485]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:21.092]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:21.092 --> 01:08:25.255]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:25.255 --> 01:08:33.221]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:33.221 --> 01:08:37.304]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[01:08:37.304 --> 01:08:39.206]  That's what the globalists want us to be.
[01:08:39.206 --> 01:08:41.628]  We are not land of the coward, home of the slave.
[01:08:42.967 --> 01:08:47.349]  Planet of the Trendies.
[01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:49.709]  Creation of the Stupids.
[01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:53.931]  But you've got Bomb Threat USA, as Drudge Report calls it.
[01:08:53.931 --> 01:08:56.012]  Alabama, three hospitals.
[01:08:56.012 --> 01:08:57.172]  Connecticut, courthouse.
[01:08:57.172 --> 01:08:58.693]  Pennsylvania, shopping village.
[01:08:58.693 --> 01:08:59.873]  Iowa, neighborhood.
[01:08:59.873 --> 01:09:01.654]  Florida, office building.
[01:09:01.654 --> 01:09:05.635]  Man wearing camo shirt shuts down Philly Visitor Center.
[01:09:05.635 --> 01:09:07.556]  Camo has completely been in for two years.
[01:09:09.076 --> 01:09:10.097]  It just goes on and on.
[01:09:10.097 --> 01:09:13.779]  Drone industry invokes Boston bombings in PR pitch.
[01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:21.563]  Oh yeah, billions in drones, billions in robots, billions in checkpoints, billions in armored vehicles.
[01:09:21.563 --> 01:09:29.748]  That's the type of stuff we have up at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and I'm also covering what's at DrugsReport.com.
[01:09:29.748 --> 01:09:34.310]  Meanwhile, World Daily reports Americans are snapping by the millions.
[01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:35.151]  I've been telling you this.
[01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:42.513]  Road raging, fighting, divorce is way up, suicide is way up.
[01:09:42.513 --> 01:09:54.420]  Yeah, you put 20% of the population on suicide pills, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and other antipsychotics, and other antidepressants, they cause you, statistically, to commit suicide and mass murder.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:57.141]  But the answer is, more people on drugs.
[01:09:57.141 --> 01:09:59.043]  Roughly 20%, again, of the U.S.
[01:09:59.043 --> 01:10:02.064]  military that's come out is on these drugs, while in combat.
[01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:02.965]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:10:06.906 --> 01:10:12.208]  Saudi national questioned after Boston bombing was on terror watch list.
[01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:12.988]  That's right.
[01:10:12.988 --> 01:10:16.390]  That's the big breaking news ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:23.993]  The Saudi was on a terror watch list and reportedly had six members of his family in Saudi Arabia on the Saudi Arabian
[01:10:24.873 --> 01:10:33.802]  Terror watch list and we broke that first here in the United States of America.
[01:10:33.802 --> 01:10:45.473]  I broke that Saturday on Infowars.com and I broke it Sunday with a video that I put up and now it is at townhall.com.
[01:10:46.516 --> 01:10:50.739]  That is the big Glenn Beck news, was that he was on a watch list.
[01:10:50.739 --> 01:10:52.941]  And again, that was in the foreign press Friday.
[01:10:52.941 --> 01:10:57.485]  I didn't find it till Saturday.
[01:10:57.485 --> 01:11:01.167]  Homeland Security was dragging its feet over Tamerlan's U.S.
[01:11:01.167 --> 01:11:04.470]  citizenship application.
[01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:06.392]  Yeah, I bet they were.
[01:11:06.392 --> 01:11:14.558]  And now the Cato Institute, the neocon-libertarian group, is spinning the bombing, saying it's the reason to legalize illegals, because they didn't come across illegally.
[01:11:19.005 --> 01:11:25.549]  But Americans are committing suicide and society is falling apart because we are in a deep depression.
[01:11:25.549 --> 01:11:31.493]  And people basically have television sickness because all the general public does is watch eight hours of TV a day.
[01:11:31.493 --> 01:11:33.774]  Young people, it's even more.
[01:11:33.774 --> 01:11:37.497]  The average adult's like five and a half, six hours, but that's what they put on surveys.
[01:11:37.497 --> 01:11:42.120]  Some surveys show young people watch as much as 14 hours of TV and video games a day.
[01:11:45.492 --> 01:11:48.914]  And so right now they're having the perception of terrorists everywhere.
[01:11:48.914 --> 01:11:50.135]  So I'm gonna tell you again.
[01:11:50.135 --> 01:11:53.257]  We called there'd be a big public terrorist event in this country.
[01:11:53.257 --> 01:11:54.398]  They try to blame on the Tea Party.
[01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:59.032]  Then they said they had someone arrested from the right wing.
[01:11:59.032 --> 01:12:00.632]  They were going to roll them out.
[01:12:00.632 --> 01:12:02.753]  MSNBC and CNN celebrated.
[01:12:02.753 --> 01:12:06.214]  Then the photos of all the other patsies in the drill freaked them out.
[01:12:06.214 --> 01:12:10.815]  So they shifted to these other patsies, I believe, who I predicted would end up being U.S.
[01:12:10.815 --> 01:12:11.975]  intelligence assets.
[01:12:11.975 --> 01:12:15.336]  And now it turns out they had fake identification traveling in and out.
[01:12:15.336 --> 01:12:16.917]  Representative Mike Rogers, Tamerlan,
[01:12:17.797 --> 01:12:21.502]  Uh, may have traveled to Russia under alias, that's Huffington Post.
[01:12:21.502 --> 01:12:24.705]  And now they're saying, well, yes, he was able to get on with a fake name.
[01:12:24.705 --> 01:12:26.227]  It must have been a mistake.
[01:12:26.227 --> 01:12:28.069]  Yeah.
[01:12:28.069 --> 01:12:29.190]  You try getting on a plane.
[01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:31.954]  The underwear bomber was put on the plane by a U.S.
[01:12:31.954 --> 01:12:32.314]  agent.
[01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:37.100]  We broke that because we had Kurt Haskell on first.
[01:12:38.427 --> 01:12:42.771]  And he said, yeah, no, I saw a sharp-dressed man get him on the plane without a passport.
[01:12:42.771 --> 01:12:45.053]  And later it came out in Congress, a U.S.
[01:12:45.053 --> 01:12:48.837]  intelligence agency's ordered the State Department to get them on the plane.
[01:12:48.837 --> 01:12:56.845]  And the State Department had so much power that the European airport
[01:12:58.174 --> 01:13:02.057]  In Amsterdam, the Dutch airport took the orders and put them on.
[01:13:02.057 --> 01:13:03.878]  Then a firecracker went off in his pants.
[01:13:03.878 --> 01:13:10.022]  So in land of the free, home of the brave, oh my gosh, the scanners ordered a year before that were going in the next week.
[01:13:10.022 --> 01:13:15.245]  They said, we just are going to put these scanners in because of this, which they already have been ordered for a year.
[01:13:15.245 --> 01:13:17.127]  The whole thing is scripted.
[01:13:17.127 --> 01:13:18.908]  The whole thing is rolled out.
[01:13:18.908 --> 01:13:24.492]  And now they said on Wednesday and Thursday, on Thursday, here's their photos.
[01:13:24.492 --> 01:13:25.352]  We don't know who they are.
[01:13:25.352 --> 01:13:26.513]  Here's the video.
[01:13:26.513 --> 01:13:27.754]  We don't know who they are.
[01:13:29.195 --> 01:13:31.636]  And it turns out five years ago they knew who they were.
[01:13:31.636 --> 01:13:33.277]  And it turns out they were following them.
[01:13:33.277 --> 01:13:37.819]  And it turns out they'd met with them two and a half years ago.
[01:13:37.819 --> 01:13:42.541]  And it turns out that the family said they were absolutely hooked in with the FBI.
[01:13:42.541 --> 01:13:47.704]  Well yeah, the FBI was just running a local investigation to cover up for their intelligence connection.
[01:13:47.704 --> 01:13:52.006]  Just like 7-7 was run by a SWAT, the MI6 officer.
[01:13:53.157 --> 01:13:56.238]  And they set the patsies up and said it was a drill.
[01:13:56.238 --> 01:13:59.399]  What did I tell you Monday before the bombs went off?
[01:13:59.399 --> 01:14:08.201]  I said if anybody wants to be part of a drill, carrying a simulated explosive, don't be part of it.
[01:14:08.201 --> 01:14:21.604]  I had family in counter-terrorism, and of course this was a big public event at Camp Mabry, and I was invited a few years ago to go see them practice taking out terrorists.
[01:14:22.475 --> 01:14:24.856]  In a simulated bombing.
[01:14:24.856 --> 01:14:26.197]  And I said, are you kidding?
[01:14:26.197 --> 01:14:29.758]  And they're like, come on, don't be paranoid, it's been announced, it's public.
[01:14:29.758 --> 01:14:32.379]  I'm not, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:14:34.156 --> 01:14:39.060]  I'm not getting anywhere near one of these drills.
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:45.445]  And this is with a general public with a guy with a beard acting like he had a bomb and the helicopters come in and stop him and all this stupid stuff.
[01:14:45.445 --> 01:14:47.467]  Oh yes, keeping us safe.
[01:14:47.467 --> 01:14:54.673]  Our government, just like Mohammed Karzai said, runs Taliban and Al Qaeda and they run them in Libya and Syria and they just gave them $123 million last Friday to Al Qaeda in Syria.
[01:14:58.576 --> 01:15:05.541]  To offensively attack that government and those people and make fathers suicide bomb or they kill their whole family.
[01:15:05.541 --> 01:15:12.686]  And there are videos of men, women and children being thrown off roofs and having their heads chopped off.
[01:15:12.686 --> 01:15:14.127]  God bless Rand Paul right now.
[01:15:14.127 --> 01:15:20.252]  You know, he's been speaking out against the drones and everything else.
[01:15:26.008 --> 01:15:35.573]  And Rand Paul is now urging Reed McConnell to stall immigration reform after Boston, which is amnesty.
[01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:36.773]  So Rand Paul's taking action.
[01:15:36.773 --> 01:15:38.154]  By the way, we're going to get Rand Paul back on.
[01:15:38.154 --> 01:15:40.615]  You guys, go after Rand Paul.
[01:15:40.615 --> 01:15:43.637]  Last time he just called us and said we want to have him on.
[01:15:43.637 --> 01:15:46.278]  I want to get him on about all this, and I want Rand Paul.
[01:15:46.278 --> 01:15:53.722]  So please, fire political torpedoes of love and get them both on the show.
[01:15:56.596 --> 01:15:58.776]  That's a pretty silly joke I just told, isn't it?
[01:15:58.776 --> 01:16:01.717]  All right, anyways.
[01:16:01.717 --> 01:16:04.677]  Man, I tell you, this is just so ridiculous.
[01:16:04.677 --> 01:16:16.259]  We got Wayne Madsen, award-winning journalist and formerly of the National Security Agency, joining us to give us his take at the bottom of the hour, and then Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief, who day one said it has all the signs of false flag.
[01:16:16.259 --> 01:16:18.460]  He's going to be on.
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:24.761]  Everyone I respect, like Joel Skousen and people like
[01:16:27.677 --> 01:16:36.643]  I mean, there's so many folks out there saying it has all the signs of false flag, but Steve Pachinik, you name it, are saying this thing stinks to high heaven.
[01:16:36.643 --> 01:16:40.546]  And again, why is it always people being intelligence handled?
[01:16:40.546 --> 01:16:43.868]  Lee Harvey Oswald, Tim McVeigh, it's the same formula.
[01:16:43.868 --> 01:16:49.571]  Have people that are part of your operation, even if they get caught, you just say they're double agents.
[01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:51.513]  And that's what the Israelis are saying.
[01:16:51.513 --> 01:16:54.315]  Oh, these guys were sent over under fake IDs.
[01:16:54.315 --> 01:16:55.816]  By the way, they said this before it was in the news.
[01:16:56.676 --> 01:17:08.223]  And there obviously were to infiltrate Muslim extremist groups in the Caucasus, Caucasus Mountain region, but the Israelis didn't point out the West is funding the leader of that group.
[01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:11.065]  The Chechnyan Bin Laden, as he's known.
[01:17:11.065 --> 01:17:16.989]  A billion bucks or more has been sent to these guys.
[01:17:16.989 --> 01:17:19.491]  Same old story like they created Al-Qaeda to fight the Russians.
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:28.345]  And so a group created by our government, as usual, is radicalized and somehow brainwashed.
[01:17:28.345 --> 01:17:35.469]  And now they're saying there's a group of 12 guys in a sleeper cell that they're hunting for, who help these guys.
[01:17:35.469 --> 01:17:37.910]  But the rest of the media is like, no, no, no, it's a lone guy.
[01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:40.152]  Because the 12 guys are the handlers.
[01:17:43.516 --> 01:17:48.960]  And again, they follow an exact paradigm, an exact program, an exact operation.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.662]  People say, Alex, couldn't there be some real terror?
[01:17:51.662 --> 01:17:54.123]  Absolutely.
[01:17:54.123 --> 01:17:57.265]  Absolutely, Easter bunnies may exist.
[01:17:57.265 --> 01:17:58.186]  I've never seen one.
[01:17:58.186 --> 01:18:05.571]  I don't think they exist, but I cannot definitively prove that there are not Easter bunnies living in America.
[01:18:12.702 --> 01:18:16.465]  I cannot prove that leprechauns aren't real.
[01:18:16.465 --> 01:18:20.048]  I cannot prove that Santa Claus is not real.
[01:18:20.048 --> 01:18:26.634]  Now look, are there in some cases in Israel real people that blow stuff up or real people that actually go on a bus and stab folks?
[01:18:26.634 --> 01:18:27.915]  Yes.
[01:18:27.915 --> 01:18:41.526]  But nine times out of ten, the Israeli intelligence services, Harots, Jerusalem Post have all reported, create fake Al Qaeda to then bomb themselves when they don't want to have a peace process or something.
[01:18:43.069 --> 01:18:44.969]  Type in Israel created fake Al Qaeda.
[01:18:44.969 --> 01:18:46.910]  You'll get mainstream news.
[01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:50.691]  Type in Israel created Hamas in 1973.
[01:18:50.691 --> 01:19:04.834]  Now again, I'm not saying that's how you control the opposition is you don't like Hezbollah, Iranian run, a real terror group that's really attacking you.
[01:19:04.834 --> 01:19:06.474]  You create Hezbollah
[01:19:07.506 --> 01:19:18.653]  That then fights for political control and acts like terrorists to then take up all the resistance that Iran is picking up on, to then mop up everybody and then spy on your resistance.
[01:19:18.653 --> 01:19:24.617]  And then if you politically need to get elected or something, just blow something up and blame it on your political enemy.
[01:19:24.617 --> 01:19:27.498]  There it is, Israel faked Al-Qaeda presence.
[01:19:27.498 --> 01:19:29.380]  That's a BBC.
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:30.700]  And that's a whitewash itself.
[01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:34.556]  Let me just show new viewers and radio listeners.
[01:19:34.556 --> 01:19:41.078]  Radio listeners can just search whatever I say, whatever I say, and then you can find it for yourself.
[01:19:41.078 --> 01:20:00.965]  Just type in MI6 agent 77 bombings and you'll get Fox News, Democratic Underground, Infowars.com, BBC, Daily Mail, where the head of the bombings is and was MI6 and is protected.
[01:20:00.965 --> 01:20:01.506]  And what did he do?
[01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:08.569]  He set up six guys with backpacks who thought they were part of a drill and blew them sky high.
[01:20:08.569 --> 01:20:10.490]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:12.891]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:18.334]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:20:18.334 --> 01:20:22.356]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:20:22.356 --> 01:20:26.238]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:27.639]  The fact is, you are.
[01:20:27.639 --> 01:20:28.640]  We all are.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.981]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:20:31.281 --> 01:20:39.767]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[01:20:39.767 --> 01:20:41.148]  Be prepared before you need it.
[01:20:41.148 --> 01:20:44.611]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.

[01:21:01.401 --> 01:21:10.383]  It's time for a home security quiz!
[01:21:10.383 --> 01:21:23.386]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:26.367]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:21:26.367 --> 01:21:28.568]  This year, about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[01:21:28.568 --> 01:21:34.992]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:21:34.992 --> 01:21:42.996]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:21:43.556 --> 01:21:49.259]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.

[01:22:38.509 --> 01:22:43.052]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:43.052 --> 01:22:48.876]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:48.876 --> 01:22:52.518]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:52.518 --> 01:22:55.240]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:23:07.488 --> 01:23:12.251]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:12.251 --> 01:23:15.292]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:15.292 --> 01:23:24.257]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:24.257 --> 01:23:29.180]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:23:56.754 --> 01:24:04.019]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:24:04.019 --> 01:24:05.280]  Protect your immune system.
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:06.321]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:13.868 --> 01:24:18.310]  We're going to go back to your calls, but we know these guys were handled by the government.
[01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:21.871]  They were clearly allowed to travel in and out of the country with aliases.
[01:24:21.871 --> 01:24:23.831]  This is not the FBI dropping the ball.
[01:24:23.831 --> 01:24:27.933]  This is the FBI covering up for the CIA and others.
[01:24:27.933 --> 01:24:33.835]  Here's some of the articles up at InfoWars.com that we're going to be talking about with Wayne Madsen.
[01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:37.596]  Mother of suspects says bomber.
[01:24:37.596 --> 01:24:39.657]  Again, mother of suspects says bombers.
[01:24:41.724 --> 01:24:52.447]  Mother of suspect bombers claims FBI called eldest son after bombing before fatal shootout.
[01:24:52.447 --> 01:24:54.928]  And come, you know, come in with us.
[01:24:54.928 --> 01:24:56.889]  We're going to get you a lawyer, bud.
[01:24:56.889 --> 01:24:59.330]  And then you see him putting him in the car naked.
[01:24:59.330 --> 01:25:03.551]  And the next you hear he dies in a shootout and then his brother runs him over.
[01:25:05.839 --> 01:25:15.305]  And then witnesses, we have the videos and news reports up, say no, they ran over him and then pumped him full of bullets.
[01:25:15.305 --> 01:25:22.249]  Mother of suspected bombers claims FBI called eldest son after bombing before fatal shootout.
[01:25:22.249 --> 01:25:26.531]  And then you've got them pumping hundreds of rounds, saying they were rubber bullets over the radio.
[01:25:26.531 --> 01:25:27.692]  They were not rubber bullets.
[01:25:27.692 --> 01:25:29.993]  They shot holes right through the boat.
[01:25:29.993 --> 01:25:34.576]  You've got cops lining up, like a firing squad, and trying to shoot up the vehicle.
[01:25:35.629 --> 01:26:02.095]  The boat and then they he climbs out and is okay or at least can climb out and then minutes later they're doing a tracheotomy it looks like and now he's sedated but talking to police so that's great kind of like the Aurora shooter supposedly it was on seven psychotropics and in a DARPA program and now they admit they drug him with sodium penethyl to admit he's guilty
[01:26:05.772 --> 01:26:11.495]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, that's what North Koreans do, is grab you and drug you, or North Vietnamese.
[01:26:11.495 --> 01:26:13.837]  I mean, that's mind control.
[01:26:13.837 --> 01:26:24.183]  But see how they just, hey, we got the bad guy, shut up, this is our city, this is Boston, everybody buys into the hype, when nothing you've been told is true, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:28.274 --> 01:26:32.040]  And you've got Saudi Arabians on watch list crawling all over this.
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.121]  Let's just ignore that.
[01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:35.905]  You've got the media saying we have somebody arrested.
[01:26:35.905 --> 01:26:37.608]  Looks like it's going to be a right winger.
[01:26:37.608 --> 01:26:42.755]  And then that all gets flushed as they evacuate.
[01:26:42.755 --> 01:26:43.777]  Evacuate.
[01:26:46.696 --> 01:26:49.037]  Evacuate the courthouse.
[01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:51.377]  And you've got all these operatives and a drill.
[01:26:51.377 --> 01:26:53.838]  Oh, and by the way, I forgot that article.
[01:26:53.838 --> 01:26:54.878]  It's somewhere in my stack.
[01:26:54.878 --> 01:27:00.879]  Will you guys reprint me the article from 2008 where they had a dry run drill?
[01:27:00.879 --> 01:27:04.940]  A dry run drill at the Boston Marathon.
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:07.120]  Boston Globe reported.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.121]  We haven't even covered that yet.
[01:27:08.121 --> 01:27:09.321]  I mentioned it yesterday.
[01:27:09.321 --> 01:27:12.242]  Congress exploits our fears to take our liberty.
[01:27:12.242 --> 01:27:14.162]  Ron Paul article up at Infowars.com.
[01:27:16.943 --> 01:27:22.247]  The brother's aunt claims naked man in video is Tamerlan.
[01:27:22.247 --> 01:27:24.349]  And man, it shows the video.
[01:27:24.349 --> 01:27:28.252]  If it isn't him, it's his, uh, naked.
[01:27:28.252 --> 01:27:29.092]  Oh, they call him up.
[01:27:29.092 --> 01:27:30.874]  Hey, how'd the operation go?
[01:27:30.874 --> 01:27:33.316]  Yeah, we're not sure who did it.
[01:27:33.316 --> 01:27:34.577]  And then boom, it's in the news.
[01:27:36.698 --> 01:27:41.522]  Shocking footage Americans ordered out of homes at gunpoint by SWAT teams.
[01:27:41.522 --> 01:27:42.463]  Who needs due process?
[01:27:42.463 --> 01:27:43.344]  Martial law is good.
[01:27:43.344 --> 01:27:47.047]  Everybody got a big dose of it at Katrina and here now.
[01:27:47.047 --> 01:27:52.091]  17 unanswered questions about the Boston bombing the media is afraid to ask.
[01:27:52.091 --> 01:27:54.513]  Video and audio of firefight captured.
[01:28:01.741 --> 01:28:06.504]  Claim Boston Bomber's last message on Facebook to his father.
[01:28:06.504 --> 01:28:07.705]  I have never done it.
[01:28:07.705 --> 01:28:08.705]  They set me up.
[01:28:08.705 --> 01:28:11.847]  The world of synthetic manufactured terrorism.
[01:28:11.847 --> 01:28:13.048]  That's all that's up on the site.
[01:28:13.048 --> 01:28:15.510]  Let's jam in a call right now.
[01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:17.091]  Let's go to Bob in Michigan.
[01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:17.991]  Bob, you're on the air.
[01:28:17.991 --> 01:28:20.253]  Welcome.
[01:28:20.253 --> 01:28:20.793]  Hello?
[01:28:20.793 --> 01:28:21.774]  Yeah.
[01:28:21.774 --> 01:28:23.935]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking the phone call.
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.681]  Um, you're right.
[01:28:25.681 --> 01:28:27.502]  I was kind of surprised.
[01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:30.004]  You know, I don't listen to you all the time.
[01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:38.109]  But when I see something, and to be honest with you, I really didn't watch the news that much either because I know it's just a bunch of propaganda.
[01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:44.253]  But I did hear them talk about shooting the rubber bullets when this guy was in the boat.
[01:28:44.253 --> 01:28:54.100]  And what kills me about this is for an average rational thinking person to sit and listen to that
[01:28:54.904 --> 01:29:04.447]  Where you have somebody in a boat, if anybody owns a boat, especially the size of that boat, what are rubber bullets going to do, and where are they getting the angle to hit this guy?
[01:29:04.447 --> 01:29:09.128]  No, no, they were saying it, and I heard it over the scanner, to confuse the media.
[01:29:09.128 --> 01:29:12.889]  And this was hours after, an hour and 45 minutes after they'd already shot him up.
[01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:16.350]  And they watched him crawl around, they watched his heat, you know, resonance there.
[01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.230]  Then they say, get out.
[01:29:19.435 --> 01:29:19.996]  You know, it's
[01:29:39.312 --> 01:29:56.315]  What I find happening, I have a mother-in-law that's like 75 years old, and what I find is what the news does, I was over at her house helping her out over the weekend, and she talks about all the stuff that's on the news, and I'm telling you, it's the old people that they really scare.
[01:29:56.315 --> 01:29:57.796]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:29:57.796 --> 01:30:00.796]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:00.796 --> 01:30:04.397]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.164 --> 01:30:17.728]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.

[01:32:11.465 --> 01:32:16.492]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:32:16.492 --> 01:32:23.683]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[01:33:53.103 --> 01:34:00.149]  We're going to be talking to Wayne Madsen of Wayne Madsen Report here in just a moment.
[01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:07.855]  As the news comes out, it turns out the FBI had been all over these two youth for five years, had sent them into the caucuses.
[01:34:08.937 --> 01:34:18.713]  It appears through the CIA to infiltrate gribs and that's the picture that is now emerging and that the FBI called them before and after.
[01:34:20.257 --> 01:34:44.718]  uh... the bombing the mother is now saying and when you've got parents immediately saying they were set up by security services the government was all over my kids uh... they either let them do this or they're handling them and they thought they were part of a drill and either or or didn't plant bombs and then you've got the government in damage control uh... with a bunch of saudi arabians uh... you've got all of this going on
[01:34:45.419 --> 01:34:53.104]  And so we're going to be getting Wayne Madsen's take on that right now, but this fits the exact same cutout we've seen over and over again.
[01:34:53.104 --> 01:35:11.236]  Before we go any further, don't forget that you can see InfoWars Nightly News every night at 7 o'clock Central Standard Time, as well as see the live video feed of the three-hour live radio show that you're listening to right now by subscribing to PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:35:13.138 --> 01:35:15.059]  Because by using these events,
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:19.764]  They are training us that when the government says everyone stay in your house, you have to.
[01:35:19.764 --> 01:35:25.251]  Or when the government says they're going to put checkpoints on the highway, you have to.
[01:35:25.251 --> 01:35:30.738]  The great threat is tyranny, not statistically terrorism, whether it's real or not.
[01:35:31.989 --> 01:35:36.352]  And again, 200-plus people die a year from honeybee stings, according to World Almanac.
[01:35:36.352 --> 01:35:38.813]  Less than 50 die a year from terrorism.
[01:35:38.813 --> 01:35:41.655]  But they hype it up like it's the end of the world.
[01:35:41.655 --> 01:35:43.516]  Same thing with mass shootings.
[01:35:43.516 --> 01:35:46.198]  Less than 100 people die a year from mass shootings.
[01:35:46.198 --> 01:35:48.339]  More than half of those are gang-related.
[01:35:48.339 --> 01:35:55.623]  Less than 40 people that are actually in mass shootings that are innocents and not groups killing each other.
[01:35:55.623 --> 01:35:59.886]  And they try to use that to then guilt all of us and make all of us suspects.
[01:35:59.886 --> 01:36:00.967]  And that's what this is.
[01:36:01.966 --> 01:36:05.587]  Getting us to cheer our own servitude.
[01:36:05.587 --> 01:36:08.867]  So now more than ever, it is essential to support InfoWars.com.
[01:36:08.867 --> 01:36:10.487]  Spread the word about the site.

[01:36:24.810 --> 01:36:30.831]  So create a unique username and passcode that you can share, an original username and passcode, and give it to friends and family.
[01:36:31.636 --> 01:36:33.057]  Way more than 11 can use it.
[01:36:33.057 --> 01:36:41.981]  That's simultaneously they can log in, see the films, read the books, see all the documentaries, the expanded extras, most of it in HD.
[01:36:41.981 --> 01:36:45.542]  And it can't be censored like YouTube and others are censoring us.
[01:36:45.542 --> 01:36:47.103]  At least it's harder for the system to do that.
[01:36:47.643 --> 01:36:51.267]  So again, you're supporting the very tip of the spear in real media.

[01:37:02.538 --> 01:37:02.999]  Here it is.
[01:37:04.389 --> 01:37:10.894]  And Kurt Nemo's got a big article coming out soon with a whole boil down with their intelligence connections.
[01:37:10.894 --> 01:37:13.575]  And that ties in with Steve Watson's article.
[01:37:13.575 --> 01:37:20.500]  Mother of suspected bomber claims FBI called eldest son after bombing before fatal shootout.
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:27.105]  British media report claims FBI spoke with Tamerlan and said they knew he'd carried out the bombing.
[01:37:27.825 --> 01:37:30.387]  And that is being reported by Channel 4 News in Britain.
[01:37:30.387 --> 01:37:35.010]  Yeah, when the mother instantly said, intelligence services, they would not leave my son alone!
[01:37:35.010 --> 01:37:44.656]  And these guys are playboying around and traveling in Dajikistan and all these places and hanging out with groups funded by the CIA.
[01:37:44.656 --> 01:37:47.638]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:37:47.638 --> 01:37:52.761]  This is absolutely incredible.
[01:37:56.156 --> 01:38:00.179]  And again, you can also find that article at PlanetInfoWars.com.
[01:38:00.179 --> 01:38:05.444]  If you guys punch up my screen, I'll actually show viewers right here.
[01:38:05.444 --> 01:38:12.891]  Get InfoWars.com and you click on the top link, mother of suspected bombers claims FBI called eldest sons after bombing before fatal shootout.
[01:38:12.891 --> 01:38:18.377]  Now remember, the whole family, everything the family said, the family said Thursday
[01:38:19.918 --> 01:38:26.046]  Early Thursday morning hours, I guess it was already Friday morning, they said that, you know, this, my son is set up.
[01:38:26.046 --> 01:38:30.473]  These are not our, you know, you know, they didn't do this.
[01:38:30.473 --> 01:38:34.037]  They've been harassed for five years by the FBI.
[01:38:34.037 --> 01:38:36.461]  This is intelligence services setting them up.
[01:38:38.717 --> 01:38:47.080]  And then it comes out for five years they've been doing this, and two and a half years ago they met with him again when the Russians wanted it on record that, hey, we know these guys work for you.
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:49.481]  So the FBI had to act like they were doing something.
[01:38:49.481 --> 01:38:53.322]  And now, here's the big issue.
[01:38:53.322 --> 01:38:59.904]  We have the FBI, when they knew full well who they were, and if we confirm they were talking to him on the phone, we've got him.
[01:38:59.904 --> 01:39:02.325]  In the middle of the drills and all the other suspects.
[01:39:02.325 --> 01:39:04.686]  We're getting Wayne Madsen's expert take on this in about one minute.
[01:39:06.519 --> 01:39:12.442]  They were on the news saying, we don't know who they are, help us learn who they are.
[01:39:12.442 --> 01:39:15.784]  When they knew full well who they were, it's been confirmed.
[01:39:16.963 --> 01:39:22.166]  They knew who they were and they had a press conference and said Thursday night, here they are.
[01:39:22.166 --> 01:39:32.633]  This is the only person you look at and they're now in the Washington Post and a bunch of other publications saying the alternative media almost screwed up our investigation.
[01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:38.477]  They shouldn't have access to photos and videos from surveillance cameras or the public's info in the future.
[01:39:38.737 --> 01:39:47.222]  Great, you're gonna put cameras up everywhere and still blow stuff up and blame patsies and then say we shouldn't have access to it because we're bad.
[01:39:47.222 --> 01:39:51.945]  It was citizens that found your patsy after your lockdown was lifted.
[01:39:51.945 --> 01:39:53.286]  You couldn't find him to kill him.
[01:39:54.881 --> 01:40:06.312]  And just like you did the brother and so you lifted it going okay let the slaves find it but then the media could then move the media you'd threatened to kill so they got a bird's-eye view so you couldn't finish the killing.
[01:40:06.312 --> 01:40:11.958]  Now you're drugging him up out of his mind to confess he did it just like the so-called Aurora shooter.
[01:40:11.958 --> 01:40:17.444]  Now Wayne Madsen has worked with the National Security Agency before that he was in submarine warfare.
[01:40:18.675 --> 01:40:24.137]  And if you watch C-SPAN, you always see him there in national security meetings in the press gallery.
[01:40:24.137 --> 01:40:26.518]  And he works there in D.C.
[01:40:26.518 --> 01:40:28.779]  He has a lot of intel at the National Press Club.
[01:40:28.779 --> 01:40:38.322]  I have found Wayne Madsen's intel to be so devastatingly accurate that I just don't think we blow trumpets when he comes on.
[01:40:38.322 --> 01:40:39.323]  He deserves a drumroll.
[01:40:40.454 --> 01:40:43.875]  He travels all over the place to cover these events.
[01:40:43.875 --> 01:40:51.617]  He has impeccable sources in a climate where they're arresting whistleblowers and media people left and right.
[01:40:51.617 --> 01:40:52.758]  And he has a lot of courage.
[01:40:52.758 --> 01:40:54.738]  And waynematsonreport.com is his website.
[01:40:54.738 --> 01:40:56.959]  Wayne, I don't know your take on this yet.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:09.968]  So all of us will now get your take on it here today, but am I wrong in saying there's a cover-up A and this has the classic signs of another provocateur Patsy event?
[01:41:09.968 --> 01:41:11.109]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:12.150]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[01:41:12.150 --> 01:41:17.814]  It actually gets deeper than just what's happened over the last week or so.
[01:41:18.474 --> 01:41:29.638]  You go back to 1994 when the Russians and Chechens fought this very big civil war, very deadly civil war.
[01:41:29.638 --> 01:41:30.579]  The U.S.
[01:41:30.579 --> 01:41:37.121]  began recruiting Chechens with the idea that we would support Chechnya's independence from Russia.
[01:41:37.821 --> 01:41:49.229]  And things didn't go too well because many of these Chechens eventually were Wahhabi-ized by the Saudis and became these jihadists.
[01:41:49.229 --> 01:42:00.737]  And eventually they wound up fighting us in Afghanistan and Iraq and they're fighting in Syria right now on behalf of the rebels who, of course, we're supporting.
[01:42:00.737 --> 01:42:03.699]  And historically this is one of the most war-like areas of the world.
[01:42:03.699 --> 01:42:05.240]  These people are tough as nails.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:18.544]  Yeah, well, when things got bad after some deadly terrorist attacks by Chechen terrorists in Russia, a movie theater in Moscow, a high-speed train between Moscow and St.
[01:42:18.544 --> 01:42:26.866]  Petersburg, the Moscow airport, and several others, metro stations in Moscow, the Russians really cracked down.
[01:42:27.626 --> 01:42:40.634]  Uh, what we started to see is the CIA started bringing over a whole bunch of, uh, refugees, political asylum, many of these people I call professional refugees, including the Sarnia family.
[01:42:40.634 --> 01:42:45.156]  The Sarnia family, uh, the young boy first came over here in 2002.
[01:42:46.877 --> 01:42:50.400]  Apparently got his residency, his asylum.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:53.181]  By the way, I'll just say it off a gut feeling.
[01:42:53.181 --> 01:42:55.843]  The dad looks like a classic intelligence operative.
[01:42:55.843 --> 01:42:57.964]  He just screams James Bond type.
[01:42:57.964 --> 01:42:58.865]  What do you say?
[01:42:58.865 --> 01:43:02.227]  Well, yeah, and I'll get to Uncle Ruslan later when it comes to that.
[01:43:02.227 --> 01:43:07.871]  But the Johar got this asylum in Arlington, Virginia.
[01:43:07.871 --> 01:43:11.033]  Well, we know what is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia.
[01:43:11.793 --> 01:43:14.714]  Defense and Intelligence Agency, you can imagine.
[01:43:14.714 --> 01:43:15.254]  That was in 01.
[01:43:15.254 --> 01:43:16.995]  Then the older brother comes over.
[01:43:16.995 --> 01:43:27.778]  But what I've discovered is that Boston and the Washington DC area are the two centers for Chechen refugees, many of whom who've got political asylum in the United States.
[01:43:28.318 --> 01:43:31.700]  In the case of Boston, that's a very tight-knit group.
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:41.345]  One of their unofficial leaders is the former, quote-unquote, foreign minister of independent Chechnya, Ilyas Akhmadov.
[01:43:41.345 --> 01:43:53.131]  Now, when he first applied for citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department said, no, we have information that links him to terrorist attacks in Russia.
[01:43:53.171 --> 01:43:55.732]  So we're not going to give asylum to a terrorist.
[01:43:55.732 --> 01:43:57.233]  Well who weighs in?
[01:43:57.233 --> 01:44:05.617]  Now you've heard over the last couple of days who has been arguing that this kid, Johar, should be tried in a military commission.
[01:44:05.617 --> 01:44:10.299]  He should have his citizenship taken away, which was granted last year on September 11th.
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:15.243]  Who's been arguing this but John McCain?
[01:44:15.243 --> 01:44:17.865]  John McCain and his good friend there, Ms.
[01:44:17.865 --> 01:44:19.467]  Lindsey from South Carolina.
[01:44:19.467 --> 01:44:20.888]  Yeah, Ms.
[01:44:20.888 --> 01:44:24.071]  Lindsey, because they don't want this info getting out.
[01:44:24.071 --> 01:44:26.213]  Exactly, so how do you suppress evidence?
[01:44:26.693 --> 01:44:28.553]  You do it through a military commission.
[01:44:28.553 --> 01:44:34.995]  You get these guys waylaid to get Moe, and then, you know, nobody's gonna hear all the details.
[01:44:34.995 --> 01:44:47.418]  Well, what about the fact that the mother says, and it looks like it is the older son, Tamerlan, on the video, and then now the witnesses are saying they ran him over with a car, and then shot him up full of holes, and then they tried to kill the other one.
[01:44:47.418 --> 01:44:48.718]  They want these guys dead.
[01:44:49.258 --> 01:45:03.012]  Well, when I saw him laying on a slab in the morgue, I could only think of Qusay and Uday Hussein, you know, Saddam Hussein's sons, who we laid out on a slab and we broadcast those photos, gruesome photos around the world.
[01:45:03.012 --> 01:45:05.875]  But John McCain was one of the people who argued for
[01:45:06.335 --> 01:45:12.158]  Just like the CIA ordered the Jeddah Saudi Arabian Embassy to let the 15 hijackers back in even though they were flagged as terrorists.
[01:45:12.158 --> 01:45:13.939]  They told them these guys are really CIA.
[01:45:30.046 --> 01:45:30.626]  Exactly.
[01:45:30.626 --> 01:45:36.090]  So we have all these Chechens coalescing around Boston and Washington.
[01:45:36.090 --> 01:45:38.752]  And who takes on the Chechen cause?
[01:45:38.752 --> 01:45:43.235]  Well, every neocon who you can think of.
[01:45:43.235 --> 01:45:46.157]  People like James Woolsey, the former CIA director.
[01:45:46.157 --> 01:45:47.218]  Madeleine Albright.
[01:45:48.098 --> 01:45:48.559]  I don't
[01:46:02.875 --> 01:46:04.275]  I mean, you're giving us all the connections.
[01:46:04.275 --> 01:46:06.556]  Bottom line, what do you think really happened here?
[01:46:06.556 --> 01:46:08.517]  Because they were getting ready to blame it on the Tea Party.
[01:46:08.517 --> 01:46:10.377]  They said, we have somebody arrested.
[01:46:10.377 --> 01:46:12.838]  They were going to be at the courthouse.
[01:46:12.838 --> 01:46:14.418]  Then they shut that down.
[01:46:14.418 --> 01:46:15.659]  They acted very panicked.
[01:46:15.659 --> 01:46:17.999]  Don't look at these other photos, the FBI said.
[01:46:17.999 --> 01:46:19.500]  That's word for word.
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:20.740]  Only look at these.
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:28.962]  Now, the mother says they were calling him before and after the bombing and then right before the fatal shootout.
[01:46:28.962 --> 01:46:31.063]  What is your inside intel on Capitol Hill?
[01:46:31.648 --> 01:46:39.851]  They needed another dramatic, uh, not as big as 9-11, but they needed something to spur on the passage of this CISPA Act.
[01:46:39.851 --> 01:46:42.592]  I call this the Patriot Act for the Internet.
[01:46:42.592 --> 01:46:50.314]  This is going to give the law enforcement intelligence carte blanche access to everybody's interaction with anything electronic.
[01:46:50.314 --> 01:46:51.874]  And to plant stuff on you.
[01:46:51.874 --> 01:46:53.475]  More important, to plant stuff on you.
[01:46:53.615 --> 01:46:57.058]  Yeah, and then we had the Ricin attack instead of Anthrax.
[01:46:57.058 --> 01:46:58.759]  That was the same playbook.
[01:46:58.759 --> 01:47:00.841]  Stuff sent to Congress, to the White House.
[01:47:00.841 --> 01:47:04.203]  So it's a CIA playbook, or who would you say is involved?
[01:47:04.203 --> 01:47:07.746]  I, you know, I can't even say it's a CIA's playbook anymore.
[01:47:07.746 --> 01:47:10.048]  I think it's the same people.
[01:47:10.048 --> 01:47:17.674]  If you look at the people that back these Chechen refugees in Boston and D.C., it's this project for the New American Century crowd.
[01:47:17.674 --> 01:47:19.035]  It's a neocon operation?
[01:47:19.395 --> 01:47:20.576]  Neocon operation.
[01:47:20.576 --> 01:47:21.477]  They never went away.
[01:47:21.477 --> 01:47:25.402]  As a matter of fact, they're still in the Obama administration.
[01:47:25.402 --> 01:47:27.324]  They were consulted by the Obama administration.
[01:47:27.324 --> 01:47:28.205]  Yeah, I was looking.
[01:47:28.205 --> 01:47:33.711]  One company is set to get $10 billion off this CISPA thing, spying on us.
[01:47:33.711 --> 01:47:37.796]  We're talking about $100 billion over the next five years spying on us.
[01:47:37.796 --> 01:47:40.399]  So they're also going to charge us to read our mail.
[01:47:41.092 --> 01:47:41.872]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:47:41.872 --> 01:47:52.736]  And then you got all these other little things at play, like charging people who enter the United States over land borders a fee, as they do with airports right now and seaports.
[01:47:52.736 --> 01:47:55.137]  So, you know, there's a lot of people who have their hands out.
[01:47:55.137 --> 01:47:57.278]  They're looking at making some money here.
[01:47:57.278 --> 01:48:00.700]  Contractors, DHS... What about the operation itself?
[01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:01.300]  I mean, clearly...
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:20.591]  I believe the operation, so you have these like security, private security contractors there, this Kraft International, that was headed up by this guy Kyle, who was shot back on Groundhog Day, February 2nd, by his colleague, who they said suffered from PTSD.
[01:48:20.591 --> 01:48:22.672]  And by the way, now they're trying to claim those are National Guard.
[01:48:22.672 --> 01:48:27.935]  There were some National Guard dressed the same, but there were people wearing Kraft hats there as well.
[01:48:27.935 --> 01:48:29.356]  You can tell the difference.
[01:48:29.356 --> 01:48:31.457]  National Guard were wearing the camouflage.
[01:48:32.157 --> 01:48:37.325]  Uh, uniforms and the and the craft guys were wearing these khaki pants and these vests.
[01:48:37.325 --> 01:48:40.249]  Were they just used as well as the smoke screen?
[01:48:40.249 --> 01:48:43.794]  So there's so many black backpacks, cops would never be able to stop the real guys.
[01:48:44.338 --> 01:48:54.087]  Well, either the backpacks were diversionary or their backpacks contained some of the explosive devices.
[01:48:54.087 --> 01:48:57.790]  You know, it's hard to say, but we do know that there was a bomb drill going on.
[01:48:57.790 --> 01:48:59.812]  Once again, here's a drill taking place.
[01:48:59.812 --> 01:49:01.754]  It's always a drill taking place.
[01:49:01.754 --> 01:49:04.176]  Why do they run the exact same playbook over and over again?
[01:49:04.176 --> 01:49:04.777]  Because it works?
[01:49:05.037 --> 01:49:05.857]  It works!
[01:49:05.857 --> 01:49:11.459]  It works, and they already know the media, the corporate media is in their pocket and they're not going to ask any questions.
[01:49:11.459 --> 01:49:26.964]  Well, a few British papers are, you know, and I guess in Russia, some media in Russia is taking a close look at that, not accepting everything that's coming out from the corporate wires and over the corporate networks, but they know they can get away with it.
[01:49:26.964 --> 01:49:29.305]  They've gotten away with it so many times in the past.
[01:49:31.166 --> 01:49:34.447]  Why fix something if it ain't broke?
[01:49:34.447 --> 01:49:35.688]  That's the way they're looking at it.
[01:49:35.688 --> 01:49:36.969]  So they're going to use the same thing.
[01:49:36.969 --> 01:49:37.889]  They'll change it.
[01:49:37.889 --> 01:49:39.030]  They have to change it.
[01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:42.151]  Anthrax to ricin.
[01:49:42.151 --> 01:49:49.455]  No more buildings being taken down by controlled demolitions and blaming it on airplanes.
[01:49:49.855 --> 01:49:51.696]  Sure, let me ask you this.
[01:49:51.696 --> 01:49:55.678]  Do you think it's accurate to say that this thing unraveled spectacularly?
[01:49:55.678 --> 01:50:01.981]  And they're now, you know, what is it the FBI doesn't want us to look at in all the other photos and videos that they're so scared of?
[01:50:02.557 --> 01:50:13.927]  Well, I think what they don't want anybody to know is that, as being reported, you just mentioned it, that the FBI had contacts with at least the older guy, Tamerlan Sarnieff.
[01:50:13.927 --> 01:50:16.309]  And the other thing, we've got to look at Uncle Ruslan.
[01:50:16.309 --> 01:50:28.259]  When I first saw the news crews out of Washington up in Montgomery Village, Maryland, we know that Sarnieff's father over in Dagestan apparently was an auto mechanic when he lived in Massachusetts.
[01:50:28.259 --> 01:50:30.221]  Well, you know, he obviously didn't make a lot of money.
[01:50:30.461 --> 01:50:34.482]  Look at that guy's house, Uncle Ruslan, in Montgomery Village.
[01:50:34.482 --> 01:50:35.442]  I know that area.
[01:50:35.442 --> 01:50:37.663]  That area, they're expensive homes.
[01:50:37.663 --> 01:50:39.963]  They're $600,000 homes up there.
[01:50:39.963 --> 01:50:44.124]  The uncle, the dad, all of them come off like extremely smooth operators.
[01:50:44.124 --> 01:50:51.926]  Like if I saw one of those guys walking down the street, and I've learned how to recognize him, I'd go, that's a real intelligence operative, not one of the fake ones.
[01:50:51.926 --> 01:50:53.286]  And let me tell you, the dad,
[01:50:53.926 --> 01:51:10.352]  immediately said it's intelligence services and looks mad and says my sons have been set up and he comes off very authoritative and they were saying this instantly because I guarantee you being connected to the Chechens and the State Department bringing them over here these people the whole family's probably operatives
[01:51:10.652 --> 01:51:14.535]  Well, they also said that the family may have lived in Kazakhstan for a while.
[01:51:14.535 --> 01:51:18.237]  Now, Uncle Ruslan, it turns out, he's a graduate of Duke Law School.
[01:51:18.237 --> 01:51:19.038]  He's a lawyer.
[01:51:19.038 --> 01:51:20.799]  He's worked for Arthur Anderson.
[01:51:20.799 --> 01:51:23.501]  And he also now works, he works in the big oil business.
[01:51:23.501 --> 01:51:29.085]  He works for Big Oil for Kazakhstan, a big producer and exporter of oil.
[01:51:29.085 --> 01:51:29.565]  And the company
[01:51:29.565 --> 01:51:29.885]  We're good.
[01:51:46.288 --> 01:51:47.149]  Wait a minute.
[01:51:47.149 --> 01:52:02.099]  What former president is in tight with the Kazakhstan government and has been accused of covering up all the illegal bribes being paid by Western companies to the dictator over there, Mr. Nazarbayev, but Bill Clinton?
[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:04.781]  Exactly, so they're helping out.
[01:52:23.226 --> 01:52:25.208]  Why does the FBI not want to go?
[01:52:25.208 --> 01:52:27.830]  They don't want to look any further, because you know what?
[01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:31.252]  The FBI is law enforcement for the wealthy in this country.
[01:52:31.252 --> 01:52:31.653]  That's right.
[01:52:31.653 --> 01:52:32.253]  They're there.
[01:52:32.253 --> 01:52:37.197]  I don't even think the FBI is involved in the attacks so much, because this looks more like an intelligence op.
[01:52:37.197 --> 01:52:42.581]  The FBI will just get patsies and then bust them before they do it, usually, unless it's the first World Trade Center attack.
[01:52:42.581 --> 01:52:47.185]  With these intelligence agencies, though, they'll have the multiple groups there as fallbacks.
[01:52:47.185 --> 01:52:49.987]  Now, what about the Saudi Arabian connection?
[01:52:50.387 --> 01:52:54.008]  Because it has been confirmed the White House is involved in a cover-up.
[01:52:54.008 --> 01:52:57.389]  It turns out this guy's got a bunch of family on terror watch list.
[01:52:57.389 --> 01:52:59.669]  Or is this just a rabbit trail?
[01:52:59.669 --> 01:53:00.089]  It could be.
[01:53:00.089 --> 01:53:08.211]  But look, we have to look at the Saudis because they have been very active in Chechnya and radicalizing the Chechen Muslim population.
[01:53:08.211 --> 01:53:15.353]  And so if anyone may have been involved in radicalizing old Tamerlan there, it may have been these Saudi groups.
[01:53:15.353 --> 01:53:16.973]  So we can't let them off the hook.
[01:53:18.194 --> 01:53:40.294]  But we also, the other thing I want to point out here is that this whole Chechen operation may be an attempt also to embarrass Vladimir Putin because we know that the Russians asked us for information on Tamerlan and the FBI said, well, we asked them why, give us more information.
[01:53:40.294 --> 01:53:41.635]  Well, Putin's not dumb enough.
[01:53:41.715 --> 01:53:50.909]  Well, they said we think he may be connected to these events, but I want you to finish your point, but isn't that how the Russians tend to blow somebody's cover, is open a public file on them?
[01:53:51.727 --> 01:53:52.047]  Right.
[01:53:52.047 --> 01:53:59.936]  And the Russians aren't dumb enough to, you know, when the FBI said, well, give us more information, give us more information, they're not going to give away their sources either.
[01:53:59.936 --> 01:54:04.761]  Because if we get their sources, the FBI, of course, is going to pursue them.
[01:54:04.761 --> 01:54:05.602]  Well, I looked it up.
[01:54:05.602 --> 01:54:12.869]  You've got a billion dollars in the last 15 years or so going into those stands to actually bring the Wahhabis in and train them.
[01:54:14.090 --> 01:54:17.653]  I mean, the problem is Saudi Arabia and the globalists, and now look at how the U.S.
[01:54:17.653 --> 01:54:28.040]  is using Saudi Arabia to put Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria, and I predict they're going to shoot down jet airliners with heat-seeking missiles, and then take our rights when our government gave it to them!
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:39.388]  And then we had the foreign affairs advisor, Netanyahu, stating, according to Harar, it's the Israeli newspapers, he said, this Boston Marathon bombing is good for Israel.
[01:54:39.608 --> 01:54:41.709]  Much just like what Netanyahu said after 9-11.
[01:54:41.709 --> 01:54:43.590]  He said it on Fox News.
[01:54:43.590 --> 01:54:44.930]  This is very good for it.
[01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:51.793]  You know, everybody's winning out with these terrorist attacks against the United States except the American people.
[01:54:51.793 --> 01:54:53.673]  We are being played for chumps.
[01:54:53.673 --> 01:55:04.437]  Everybody's making a killing from Saudi Arabia to Israel to these Mujahideen rebels that are fighting in Syria and fought Qaddafi.
[01:55:04.437 --> 01:55:08.759]  The only people who are getting messed over here is us because we're the ones... Sure.
[01:55:09.099 --> 01:55:14.504]  We're the people that are getting their legs blown off and having our kids killed in Boston and everywhere.
[01:55:14.504 --> 01:55:18.809]  And record suicide of the troops that nobody wants to humanize or personalize.
[01:55:18.809 --> 01:55:23.773]  What do you make of Ahmed Deneji and the things he's up to?
[01:55:23.773 --> 01:55:25.875]  How does Hezbollah tie into this?
[01:55:25.875 --> 01:55:28.498]  Because we know that's a real group actually run by Iran.
[01:55:28.498 --> 01:55:30.039]  What do you expect them to do?
[01:55:30.039 --> 01:55:31.901]  Will the media try to blame them somehow?
[01:55:31.901 --> 01:55:32.742]  Yeah, it'll try.
[01:55:33.803 --> 01:55:36.525]  Yeah, but look, Ahmadinejad condemned this.
[01:55:36.525 --> 01:55:39.108]  That did the Ayatollah Khamenei.
[01:55:39.108 --> 01:55:47.655]  They condemned this and they said, while we condemn this act of violence, you know, hey, how about looking at some of the other acts of violence the United States is involved in sponsoring around the world?
[01:55:47.655 --> 01:55:52.399]  Sure, so let's shift gears now to the president of Afghanistan, Mohammad Karzai.
[01:55:52.399 --> 01:55:59.285]  That's a big deal that he came out and said the West runs Al-Qaeda and Taliban and is staging bombings as a pretext for a police state.
[01:55:59.285 --> 01:56:00.246]  What does that signify?
[01:56:00.766 --> 01:56:04.349]  I wonder when he wakes up and starts smelling the Afghan coffee.
[01:56:04.349 --> 01:56:17.379]  He of all people should know about our links with the Al-Qaeda and the Taliban because when he was in exile he was sitting there in Pakistan and here in this country and witnessing those connections.
[01:56:17.379 --> 01:56:23.343]  I'm glad he's come out and said it, but let's see how long he remains in power.
[01:56:23.343 --> 01:56:25.485]  My feeling is that Karzai is
[01:56:26.486 --> 01:56:30.209]  You know, some people's patience is wearing thin with this guy.
[01:56:30.209 --> 01:56:42.018]  And, you know, we do know that when the Soviets controlled Afghanistan, you know, a lot of Afghan leaders would wind up with bullets in their head and, you know, being strung up in the central square of Kabul.
[01:56:42.018 --> 01:56:48.663]  Let's see how long it takes for our guys to get around to, you know, taking care of Mr. Karzai.
[01:56:48.663 --> 01:56:50.885]  Just like they did Pat Tillman, yeah.
[01:56:50.885 --> 01:56:51.706]  Exactly.
[01:56:51.706 --> 01:56:52.386]  Let me ask you this.
[01:56:53.487 --> 01:57:02.613]  Look, how long can the globalists openly run Al-Qaeda while, I mean, publicly running Al-Qaeda, like the war on drugs, publicly they run the drugs and that's public.
[01:57:02.613 --> 01:57:06.855]  Congressional hearings, studies, CIA Solicitor General in 96.
[01:57:06.855 --> 01:57:15.981]  How long can they do this where they run the terrorists publicly and then take our liberties using the terrorists to threaten us that they run?
[01:57:15.981 --> 01:57:17.501]  I mean, how long can this go on?
[01:57:17.501 --> 01:57:19.723]  Isn't it beginning to wear thin and people know about it?
[01:57:20.188 --> 01:57:28.476]  Well, look, we've got to have people back in Congress like we had back in the 70s that had the gumption to stand up and ask these questions.
[01:57:28.476 --> 01:57:32.100]  You know, we had the Senator Frank Church that went after the CIA.
[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:36.705]  We had Congresswoman Bella Abzug and Congressman Otis Pike from New York.
[01:57:36.705 --> 01:57:38.847]  Both of them were from New York.
[01:57:38.847 --> 01:57:41.990]  We had people in Congress that asked the tough questions.
[01:57:42.370 --> 01:57:57.479]  And look, even in the case of letting these Chechens into the country, back when there was this opposition to letting this Akhmadov and these Chechens in, two members of the Congress of the House voiced their objections.
[01:57:57.479 --> 01:57:58.420]  They got overruled.
[01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:06.865]  One was Jim Sensenbrenner, who was the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and one of his subcommittee chairs, John Hostetter from Indiana.
[01:58:06.865 --> 01:58:07.866]  Now, I think
[01:58:08.326 --> 01:58:17.337]  We should revisit both Sensenbrenner and Hostetter and say what possessed you to say no to giving these Chechens asylum?
[01:58:17.337 --> 01:58:19.560]  Why did you say we shouldn't?
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:23.404]  Why were you supporting initially the Justice Department's refusal to let them in?
[01:58:24.105 --> 01:58:27.427]  Uh, and I think, uh, I think Sensenbrenner's still around.
[01:58:27.427 --> 01:58:28.907]  I don't think the other guy is.
[01:58:28.907 --> 01:58:32.629]  Ostetter, but they must have had information that led them to believe.
[01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:35.110]  Both of them Republicans, by the way.
[01:58:35.110 --> 01:58:37.572]  And this was the Bush administration.
[01:58:37.572 --> 01:58:39.292]  They were, you know, they were fighting.
[01:58:39.292 --> 01:58:40.073]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:58:40.073 --> 01:58:40.833]  Do five more minutes.
[01:58:40.833 --> 01:58:43.895]  I want to ask you about the elephant in the room when we come back.
[01:58:43.895 --> 01:58:49.097]  The most important point in this whole cover-up.
[01:58:49.097 --> 01:58:50.878]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:00:01.488 --> 02:00:03.890]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:03.890 --> 02:00:13.257]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.257 --> 02:00:14.579]  Big Brother.
[02:00:14.579 --> 02:00:16.340]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:18.101]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:18.101 --> 02:00:19.663]  You want answers?
[02:00:19.663 --> 02:00:21.244]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:21.244 --> 02:00:25.407]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:25.407 --> 02:00:29.511]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.305 --> 02:00:37.631]  Well, we haven't really talked about what they're ramming through while the public is smokescreened with this bombing.
[02:00:37.631 --> 02:00:48.440]  We're going to do that in the next segment, and then I promise I'll get to Julio and DC and Dave and Bradley and Terry and everybody else that is patiently holding.
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:53.925]  Going back to Wayne Madsen, I've been throwing a lot of points here as we cover all the bases and all the angles.
[02:00:53.925 --> 02:00:55.286]  Here's the big elephant in the room.
[02:00:55.286 --> 02:00:57.668]  They said they didn't know him, put their photos out.
[02:00:58.228 --> 02:01:00.790]  And now it turns out they've been all around them for five years.
[02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:05.094]  The family's saying it's intelligence agencies setting them up.
[02:01:05.094 --> 02:01:13.361]  The family, again, looks pretty well-informed, to say the least, looking at these people and their body language and the things they say.
[02:01:13.361 --> 02:01:15.803]  They're smooth operators.
[02:01:15.803 --> 02:01:23.009]  And, you know, is there any probability that they could be double, triple agents, like the Israelis are saying, that turned against the West and did a real bombing?
[02:01:23.009 --> 02:01:23.970]  Yeah, maybe one in, what, 100?
[02:01:23.970 --> 02:01:24.210]  One in 200?
[02:01:26.517 --> 02:01:27.578]  Or do you disagree with that?
[02:01:27.578 --> 02:01:38.045]  But what about the fact that we know they knew him for five years, not just two and a half, and the mother says they were calling him right after the bombing and right before the shootout, and they're acting like there's a cover-up.
[02:01:38.045 --> 02:01:42.388]  Don't we have them when the FBI is saying, here are these photos, who is this?
[02:01:42.388 --> 02:01:44.610]  When it was well known to the FBI.
[02:01:44.610 --> 02:01:47.051]  Doesn't that prove right there?
[02:01:47.051 --> 02:01:50.394]  And if they were patsies, why didn't they go after him day one?
[02:01:50.394 --> 02:01:52.455]  I think they were fallback patsies.
[02:01:52.455 --> 02:01:54.016]  They were going to blame the Tea Party on this.
[02:01:54.016 --> 02:01:54.517]  Wayne Madsen.
[02:01:55.177 --> 02:02:00.903]  Well, I'll tell you, I'm reminded of Mohammed Atta.
[02:02:00.903 --> 02:02:07.050]  He was seen at Maxwell Air Force Base where they knew him as Lieutenant Colonel Atta of the Egyptian Air Force.
[02:02:07.050 --> 02:02:10.173]  He was involved in being a drug mule as well.
[02:02:10.173 --> 02:02:12.135]  He was involved with unsavory people.
[02:02:12.135 --> 02:02:15.479]  He was on Jack Abramoff's casino boats a couple days before
[02:02:16.059 --> 02:02:20.504]  9-11, and he was clearly working for our intelligence operations.
[02:02:20.504 --> 02:02:25.749]  So, you know, hey, Tamerlan Sarnaev, meet Mohammed Adda.
[02:02:25.749 --> 02:02:32.775]  It's just another one of these, I think you're right, Sarnaev, the older one, was a Patsy.
[02:02:32.775 --> 02:02:39.162]  You know, I'm beginning to think the younger one, Zohar, was just, you know, tagging along with Big Brother, and, you know, he had other
[02:02:39.802 --> 02:02:44.223]  Really, he had other interests, but, you know... Oh, he had BB guns with him.
[02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:50.865]  I mean, it was... Yeah, you know, I mean, this guy, this kid was just tagging along with Big Brother, who he obviously must have looked up to.
[02:02:50.865 --> 02:02:52.285]  Yeah, they wanted the Big Brother dead.
[02:02:52.285 --> 02:02:55.346]  That's who they ran over and shot in the street and lied about, yeah.
[02:02:55.346 --> 02:03:08.429]  Yeah, but the fact that the FBI, we know from the Russian government that, we at least know that they were contacted, the FBI was contacted by the Russian government about this guy, and they, you know, they just fluffed it off.
[02:03:08.949 --> 02:03:21.299]  Now, why did not President Obama call Bob Mueller, the FBI Director, into the Oval Office and said, you guys screwed up here, I want your letter of resignation on my desk by this afternoon?
[02:03:21.299 --> 02:03:23.921]  Because Obama holds no one accountable.
[02:03:23.921 --> 02:03:28.384]  He's never held one person in his administration accountable.
[02:03:28.384 --> 02:03:30.386]  That's a real flaw in his leadership.
[02:03:30.386 --> 02:03:30.806]  I agree.
[02:03:30.806 --> 02:03:35.910]  Bottom line, Benghazi giving the Al-Qaeda 10,000, he's taking missiles.
[02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:36.971]  What's the point of that?
[02:03:36.971 --> 02:03:38.352]  What's at the bottom of Benghazi?
[02:03:38.857 --> 02:03:41.380]  No, here we go again, the U.S.
[02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:44.082]  being found to support the Mujahideen.
[02:03:44.082 --> 02:03:50.949]  We had, you know, there were Chechens fighting in Libya as well, and now some of the Libyans are off fighting in Syria.
[02:03:50.949 --> 02:03:56.074]  We're keeping this conflict, it's called the... Strategy of tension.
[02:03:56.554 --> 02:04:00.877]  Strategy attention, clash of civilizations, these are all neocon terms.
[02:04:00.877 --> 02:04:04.820]  We got to keep that going because there's no more, you know, communist bloc.
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:09.064]  Now there's this terrorist axis of evil nonsense and they got to keep it alive.
[02:04:09.064 --> 02:04:17.570]  And I think why they pulled off the marathon bombing is, look, they started letting people go on airplanes now with some, you know, pocket knives.
[02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:24.615]  Yeah, they did this to sell a hundred billion dollars in robots and armored vehicles and train, and that was martial law in Boston.
[02:04:24.615 --> 02:04:25.736]  They're training us to accept that.
[02:04:26.216 --> 02:04:40.305]  Oh, by the way, the front page of the Lebanese English language newspaper, the Daily Star, I'm going to try to get this photo out, but the other day they ran a photo when they were going door to door and pulling people out of their homes in Watertown, Massachusetts.
[02:04:40.305 --> 02:04:47.949]  There is a picture of a police officer with a gun drawn on a lady who has her hands up as she's coming out of her home.
[02:04:47.949 --> 02:04:49.030]  I don't know if you've seen this photo.
[02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:50.011]  Oh, no, we have video.
[02:04:50.011 --> 02:04:52.352]  We have video up at InfoWars.com.
[02:04:52.352 --> 02:04:55.314]  Wayne Madsen, I want to get you on for a full hour in the next week.
[02:04:55.714 --> 02:04:56.655]  Thank you so much, Wayne Madsen.

[02:06:12.702 --> 02:06:13.962]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:13.962 --> 02:06:17.904]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:17.904 --> 02:06:20.125]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:20.125 --> 02:06:26.007]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:26.007 --> 02:06:32.249]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:32.669 --> 02:06:38.652]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[02:06:53.059 --> 02:06:56.621]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:56.621 --> 02:06:58.582]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:58.582 --> 02:06:59.022]  It's here.

[02:07:08.314 --> 02:07:10.255]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:07:10.255 --> 02:07:12.677]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:07:12.677 --> 02:07:18.720]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:22.182]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:07:22.182 --> 02:07:26.104]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:07:26.104 --> 02:07:27.505]  The fact is, you are.
[02:07:27.505 --> 02:07:28.526]  We all are.
[02:07:28.526 --> 02:07:30.867]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[02:08:25.526 --> 02:08:32.110]  Tamerlan Czarnev, FBI fumbles as it tries to cover up false flag asset Tamerlan Czarnev.
[02:08:32.110 --> 02:08:36.292]  Kurt Nemo's got an article that just breaks down the intelligence connections, all of it.
[02:08:36.292 --> 02:08:46.338]  The family's now saying the FBI called their son after the bombing and right before he was killed, that he was loaded in a car naked, that that is indeed him, and then run over and then shot.
[02:08:46.338 --> 02:08:47.919]  Eyewitnesses are saying they saw that.
[02:08:48.899 --> 02:08:55.405]  As well, ladies and gentlemen, this story is breaking up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:55.405 --> 02:09:00.690]  Mother of suspected bombers claims FBI called eldest son after bombing before fatal shootout.
[02:09:00.690 --> 02:09:02.732]  Congress exploits our fears to take our liberty.
[02:09:02.732 --> 02:09:03.953]  Ron Paul.
[02:09:03.953 --> 02:09:08.077]  Czarnev Ant claims naked man in video is Tamerlan.
[02:09:08.077 --> 02:09:08.857]  Shocking footage.
[02:09:08.857 --> 02:09:11.700]  Americans order out of homes at gunpoint by SWAT teams.
[02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:12.381]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:09:12.381 --> 02:09:13.422]  Imagine Austin.
[02:09:13.422 --> 02:09:14.723]  There's a lone shooter out.
[02:09:16.324 --> 02:09:18.626]  One thing they said, we're shutting this building down, we think he's in it.
[02:09:18.626 --> 02:09:21.107]  They come to your house, they come out with their hands up to everybody.
[02:09:21.107 --> 02:09:22.108]  I know, I'm done.
[02:09:22.108 --> 02:09:24.190]  This is totally unconstitutional.
[02:09:24.190 --> 02:09:29.353]  Now I'm going to go to your calls in the next segment, I promise, and then we're going to get Phil Skousen to pop in with his take.
[02:09:29.353 --> 02:09:33.176]  But all the experts I trust, not just me, are saying this is a staged event.
[02:09:33.176 --> 02:09:41.862]  One thing I want to plug here before we look at what they're trying to ram through while we're busy in the media circus that is this quasi-staged event, bare minimum.
[02:09:44.123 --> 02:09:47.565]  WA, WIWA in Jacksonville, St.
[02:09:47.565 --> 02:09:49.106]  Cloud, Florida.
[02:09:49.106 --> 02:09:53.048]  As of today, April 22nd, WIWA in Jacksonville, St.
[02:09:53.048 --> 02:10:01.653]  Cloud, Florida will air the Alex Jones Show 24-7 via high-quality satellite stream.
[02:10:01.653 --> 02:10:09.257]  And you can pick up 24 hours a day the internet stream that they're going to feed to XDS satellite receivers as well.
[02:10:10.376 --> 02:10:21.219]  The station manager is Jerry Smith, so they are, and of course there are some stations out there, there was one for a while in Seattle that does coast-to-coast AM 24-7, they got high ratings with that.
[02:10:21.219 --> 02:10:28.101]  And we've got a lot of stations that air us live and again at night, because it just gets more and more popular.
[02:10:28.101 --> 02:10:31.462]  But this is great, so you can find out more.
[02:10:31.462 --> 02:10:33.843]  Guys, give me their website, I'll plug that too.
[02:10:33.843 --> 02:10:36.523]  WIWA in Jacksonville, Florida.
[02:10:36.523 --> 02:10:37.944]  And it might be good on these plug sheets,
[02:10:38.524 --> 02:10:42.867]  If they give me the frequency.
[02:10:42.867 --> 02:10:45.489]  Hey, John, will you give me the frequency?
[02:10:45.489 --> 02:10:48.591]  I mean, I've given people the call letters.
[02:10:48.591 --> 02:10:49.191]  Hell, I can do it.
[02:10:49.191 --> 02:10:50.812]  I can go to Radio Locator and do it.
[02:10:50.812 --> 02:10:54.655]  It's like I'll get ad copy I'm going to write and say, here's your ad and it just says the name.
[02:10:54.655 --> 02:10:55.876]  It's like, you write it!
[02:10:55.876 --> 02:10:57.017]  You know, you do everything, Jones!
[02:10:58.485 --> 02:11:01.708]  People want me to come, I guess, into the bathroom and become groom of the stool or something, too.
[02:11:01.708 --> 02:11:04.511]  I can do all the butt wiping around here.
[02:11:04.511 --> 02:11:08.255]  1160 AM, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:08.255 --> 02:11:09.376]  Excuse me, David.
[02:11:09.376 --> 02:11:11.999]  That's a good way to introduce this hour.
[02:11:11.999 --> 02:11:12.700]  Family show.
[02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:13.701]  I apologize, folks.
[02:11:13.701 --> 02:11:14.342]  I'm not complaining.
[02:11:14.342 --> 02:11:14.842]  It's all the time.
[02:11:14.842 --> 02:11:16.985]  It's like, they're a plug-distance station.
[02:11:16.985 --> 02:11:18.947]  Oh, yes.
[02:11:18.947 --> 02:11:19.347]  Did you say 1630?
[02:11:22.423 --> 02:11:23.004]  Oh, 1160!
[02:11:23.004 --> 02:11:23.084]  1160!
[02:11:23.084 --> 02:11:28.990]  See, because I've got to get it live down my ear, you know.
[02:11:28.990 --> 02:11:29.010]  1160.
[02:11:29.010 --> 02:11:29.291]  1160.
[02:11:29.291 --> 02:11:30.332]  There you go.
[02:11:30.332 --> 02:11:31.333]  In Jacksonville, St.
[02:11:31.333 --> 02:11:31.974]  Cloud.
[02:11:31.974 --> 02:11:41.725]  Okay, shifting gears here with a quick update and report on what's being rammed through with our reporter David Knight while we're watching the martial law takeover conditioning.
[02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:46.533]  Well, what we're looking at is a threat of imposing the Patriot Act on the Internet.
[02:11:46.533 --> 02:11:56.860]  Now, the House passed, last Thursday, the CISPA Act, which has been around before, and it was killed once before, along with PIPA and SOPA and the Cybersecurity Act of 2012.
[02:11:56.860 --> 02:11:59.602]  All those things have been brought up, all those things were defeated.
[02:11:59.602 --> 02:12:03.564]  But then, as it was going through last Thursday, it was pretty amazing what happened in the House.
[02:12:03.564 --> 02:12:06.406]  There were a lot of amendments put in to try to protect privacy.
[02:12:06.406 --> 02:12:07.807]  They weren't even allowed to be debated.
[02:12:07.807 --> 02:12:11.650]  You had one amendment that said that they had to get a search warrant before they looked at people's
[02:12:12.330 --> 02:12:13.010]  We're good to go.
[02:12:27.677 --> 02:12:32.441]  But he said, we need to arm ourselves against digital bombs that are on their way.
[02:12:32.441 --> 02:12:35.483]  And so that's what they did to try to ram this through.
[02:12:35.483 --> 02:12:40.167]  Because the other bills, most of them were set up around copyright issues.
[02:12:40.167 --> 02:12:44.951]  But now when they say security, the Republicans are just falling in line left and right.
[02:12:44.951 --> 02:12:47.073]  It has not passed the Senate yet.
[02:12:47.073 --> 02:12:51.677]  And Obama says he's not going to sign it, but of course he said that about the NDAA, so we can't trust that.
[02:12:52.197 --> 02:12:53.817]  But it's been defeated in the past.
[02:12:53.817 --> 02:12:56.258]  And they're also saying because of WikiLeaks they won.
[02:12:56.258 --> 02:12:59.879]  And WikiLeaks was a good thing exposing their criminal activity.
[02:12:59.879 --> 02:13:00.719]  Right.
[02:13:00.719 --> 02:13:03.840]  So they're saying, hey, we want to keep covering up our criminal ops.
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:08.601]  You can't talk about these efforts to try to keep the Internet free without talking about Aaron Schwartz.
[02:13:08.601 --> 02:13:10.662]  Aaron Schwartz died in the middle of January.
[02:13:10.662 --> 02:13:12.042]  He was just 26.
[02:13:12.042 --> 02:13:15.683]  He was under indictment by this same U.S.
[02:13:15.683 --> 02:13:18.284]  attorney that's going to be trying these bombers in Boston.
[02:13:18.764 --> 02:13:20.005]  And she threw the book at him.
[02:13:20.005 --> 02:13:22.968]  Local prosecutors were just gonna let him go as a misdemeanor charge.
[02:13:22.968 --> 02:13:28.493]  She put 13 felony charges on him and had him looking at a 35-year sentence.
[02:13:28.493 --> 02:13:35.279]  She got a lot of criticism because a lot of people said that she drove him to suicide, but we're not so, I'm not so sure that he was, that he committed suicide.
[02:13:35.279 --> 02:13:37.481]  Yeah, folks, when you hang yourself in a jail cell...
[02:13:38.936 --> 02:13:40.698]  There's a good chance you were murdered.
[02:13:40.698 --> 02:13:40.958]  Right.
[02:13:40.958 --> 02:13:51.946]  Well, he basically, to defend Carmen Ortiz, her husband did a tweet that said that she had offered him a six-month deal.
[02:13:51.946 --> 02:13:53.467]  And he turned it down.
[02:13:53.467 --> 02:13:56.109]  Not that he was looking at a 35-year sentence.
[02:13:56.109 --> 02:14:01.774]  That Twitter account has subsequently been taken down, but that information got out and there were screenshots of it.
[02:14:01.774 --> 02:14:02.995]  People got that from the archives.
[02:14:03.755 --> 02:14:11.162]  Also, he was under indictment after, he was still fighting these SOPA, PIPA, CISPA acts even after he was under indictment.
[02:14:11.162 --> 02:14:12.123]  This guy was a fighter.
[02:14:12.123 --> 02:14:15.046]  He was not somebody that was just going to, you know, kill himself in despair.
[02:14:15.046 --> 02:14:15.567]  I don't believe.
[02:14:15.567 --> 02:14:17.168]  Of course they murdered him.
[02:14:17.168 --> 02:14:18.129]  That's what they did.
[02:14:18.129 --> 02:14:20.151]  Let's look at a couple of clips from him.
[02:14:20.151 --> 02:14:23.434]  The first one talks about some of the technical issues with cyber security.
[02:14:23.434 --> 02:14:24.455]  It's just about 30 seconds.
[02:14:24.455 --> 02:14:25.056]  Can we go to that clip?
[02:14:27.981 --> 02:14:30.962]  I think it's really important that we stop cyber attacks.
[02:14:30.962 --> 02:14:34.823]  And the way to do that is to make our cyber systems more secure.
[02:14:34.823 --> 02:14:39.084]  To close the vulnerabilities that allow attackers to get it.
[02:14:39.084 --> 02:14:41.244]  But the problem is the government's doing the opposite.
[02:14:41.244 --> 02:14:43.305]  They are funding the creation of vulnerabilities.
[02:14:43.305 --> 02:14:49.006]  They are offering rewards for people to find and build vulnerabilities in the system and give it to the U.S.
[02:14:49.006 --> 02:14:50.266]  government so then the U.S.
[02:14:50.266 --> 02:14:52.467]  government can launch cyber attacks on other countries.
[02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:54.271]  Now did you get that?
[02:14:54.271 --> 02:15:00.054]  He said the real problem with cyber security is that the government is creating and funding them.
[02:15:00.054 --> 02:15:01.575]  Our government is creating and funding them.
[02:15:23.530 --> 02:15:24.211]  Absolutely.
[02:15:24.211 --> 02:15:39.502]  And like you said before, they basically have to tell, in the same way they have to tell people when they're going to pull something off, they also seem to, even though they directly violate the Constitution, they are definitely trying to get this passed as a law, even though the law is unconstitutional.
[02:15:39.502 --> 02:15:48.909]  They feel that if they can get a law passed, if they can get the Supreme Court to sign off on it, just like Acevedo was saying about gun control, he says, then it doesn't matter what the Constitution says or what the constitutional sheriffs say.
[02:15:50.109 --> 02:15:55.652]  If the Congress passes a law and the Supreme Court says, we're fine with that, that trumps the Constitution.
[02:15:55.652 --> 02:15:58.013]  That essentially amends or nullifies the Constitution.
[02:15:58.013 --> 02:15:59.493]  So they're really pushing on this.
[02:15:59.493 --> 02:16:01.654]  But the question is, what does this bill do?
[02:16:01.654 --> 02:16:03.375]  How does it violate the Fourth Amendment?
[02:16:03.375 --> 02:16:09.497]  Well, even though it's our own government that is funding and creating these attacks, these vulnerabilities, as Aaron Schwartz pointed out,
[02:16:11.418 --> 02:16:17.900]  They're using this to come in and get information about you from, they're going to use it to get information about you from Facebook and Twitter.
[02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:19.740]  And they're going to do it in a devious way.
[02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:31.583]  Instead of the government coming in and saying, we want that information, they're going to provide liability protection to Facebook and Twitter and any corporation to voluntarily hand over that information to the FBI.
[02:16:31.583 --> 02:16:36.905]  And you know, I've been saying this since they told us in 2001, I was reading the minutes of the Internet2 meeting.
[02:16:37.905 --> 02:16:39.006]  I think it was in London that year.
[02:16:39.006 --> 02:16:41.188]  They've had it in Austin and Tokyo and other places.
[02:16:41.188 --> 02:16:48.874]  And they said, in the future, we're going to shut off the old web, but we're going to phase it into Internet 2, where it's only institutions and big corporations.
[02:16:48.874 --> 02:16:55.799]  You'll have to waive your rights to be on it, and then there'll be no freedom because you've got to waive it to be on it, but we're going to kill the old web.
[02:16:55.799 --> 02:16:57.361]  And that's the plan.
[02:16:57.361 --> 02:17:00.743]  They force you onto these pretty much government creations like Zuckerberg's
[02:17:01.964 --> 02:17:11.010]  You know, where he said they're dumb effers, he's at Bilderberg Group, Google, all this, and then you're on it, and then it says you have no rights, and so everything you're doing is spied on.
[02:17:11.010 --> 02:17:16.273]  Plus, when you sign a contract to be on the cloud, everything you're doing isn't yours now.
[02:17:16.273 --> 02:17:23.377]  Well, this will also negate any privacy agreements that have been out there between Facebook and users, or Twitter and users.
[02:17:23.377 --> 02:17:29.260]  Anything that's out there, any agreement to protect your privacy will be null and void if CISPA goes through.
[02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:30.401]  So it gives them liability protection?
[02:17:31.082 --> 02:17:31.682]  Exactly.
[02:17:31.682 --> 02:17:38.009]  And so, SISMA supporters are outspending people who are opposing it by 140 to 1.
[02:17:38.009 --> 02:17:39.451]  $605 million to push this thing through.
[02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:42.934]  $605 million versus only $4 million to try to stop it.
[02:17:42.934 --> 02:17:44.596]  And that's, it's big defense contractors.
[02:17:44.596 --> 02:17:45.257]  Tell them about that.
[02:17:45.257 --> 02:17:48.981]  Up to $10 billion per company just to spy on us.
[02:17:49.201 --> 02:17:49.441]  Right.
[02:17:49.441 --> 02:17:53.104]  Well, Mike Rogers, the $10 billion figure, comes from Mike Rogers' wife.
[02:17:53.104 --> 02:17:56.827]  Now, Mike Rogers is the congressman that's really spearheaded this.
[02:17:56.827 --> 02:18:01.411]  He introduced, he reintroduced CISPA one month after Aaron Schwartz died.
[02:18:01.411 --> 02:18:08.256]  And his wife is a former, recently, was the CEO and president of Aegis Incorporated.
[02:18:08.256 --> 02:18:12.299]  And they just got a $10 billion contract with the State Department.
[02:18:12.299 --> 02:18:14.581]  Now, Aegis... That's an offshore creep factory.
[02:18:14.781 --> 02:18:24.271]  Oh yeah, yeah, this is the organization that had more soldiers on the ground, private soldiers, mercenary soldiers on the ground than the British had troops in Iraq.
[02:18:24.271 --> 02:18:28.495]  Yeah, so it's a bunch of foreign merc companies are taking over the web right now.
[02:18:28.495 --> 02:18:33.841]  Right, and Roger's wife, who was the former CEO and President, she just recently left,
[02:18:34.961 --> 02:18:39.284]  She's around doing speeches on cyber security and that sort of thing.
[02:18:39.284 --> 02:18:41.305]  So she's jumping on that bandwagon.
[02:18:41.305 --> 02:18:45.567]  And again, like I said, this is a contract going to the State Department.
[02:18:45.567 --> 02:18:48.648]  But let's take a look at the second clip that we've got from Aaron Schwartz.
[02:18:48.648 --> 02:18:49.809]  Can we play that clip right now?
[02:18:49.809 --> 02:18:53.291]  It gives us kind of an insight into what Congress's mindset is on this.
[02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:53.631]  Go ahead.
[02:18:53.631 --> 02:18:56.372]  I was at an event and I got introduced to a U.S.
[02:18:56.372 --> 02:18:59.414]  Senator, one of the strong proponents of the original COICA bill.
[02:19:00.427 --> 02:19:08.765]  And I asked him why, despite being such a strong progressive, despite having just given a speech in favor of civil liberties, he was supporting a bill that would censor the internet.
[02:19:10.211 --> 02:19:13.852]  And that typical politician's smile faded from his face.
[02:19:13.852 --> 02:19:16.193]  And his eyes started burning this fiery red.
[02:19:16.193 --> 02:19:18.653]  And he started shouting.
[02:19:18.653 --> 02:19:20.794]  Those people on the internet, he yelled.
[02:19:20.794 --> 02:19:22.915]  They think they can get away with anything.
[02:19:22.915 --> 02:19:26.996]  They think they can just put anything up and there's nothing we can do to stop them.
[02:19:26.996 --> 02:19:28.356]  They put up everything.
[02:19:28.356 --> 02:19:32.337]  They put up the plans to our fighter jets and they just laugh at us.
[02:19:32.337 --> 02:19:34.258]  Well, we're going to show them.
[02:19:34.258 --> 02:19:35.718]  There's going to be laws on the internet.
[02:19:35.718 --> 02:19:37.299]  It's got to be under control.
[02:19:39.577 --> 02:19:43.400]  Now, as far as I know, no one has ever put up the plans to U.S.
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:46.063]  fighter jets on the Internet.
[02:19:46.063 --> 02:19:48.505]  I mean, that isn't something I've heard about.
[02:19:48.505 --> 02:19:51.627]  But that's sort of the point.
[02:19:51.627 --> 02:19:54.009]  I mean, it wasn't a rational concern.
[02:19:54.009 --> 02:19:57.232]  It was this irrational fear that things were out of control.
[02:19:57.232 --> 02:19:57.892]  Alright, hit pause.
[02:19:57.892 --> 02:20:00.575]  Here was this man, a United States Senator.
[02:20:00.575 --> 02:20:03.117]  We're going to come back and finish this clip.
[02:20:03.117 --> 02:20:06.400]  We're going to back it up and finish it, and you make the points.
[02:20:08.775 --> 02:20:09.555]  Gold.
[02:20:09.555 --> 02:20:11.096]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:20:11.096 --> 02:20:17.359]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:20:17.359 --> 02:20:21.541]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:20:21.541 --> 02:20:23.482]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:20:23.482 --> 02:20:25.924]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:20:25.924 --> 02:20:32.807]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and
[02:20:32.967 --> 02:20:33.567]  I don't know.

[02:23:07.206 --> 02:23:09.608]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:23:09.608 --> 02:23:12.891]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:23:12.891 --> 02:23:15.073]  Some people think the answer is gold.
[02:23:15.073 --> 02:23:16.674]  Others think it's a gun.
[02:23:16.674 --> 02:23:18.476]  But the correct answer will shock you.
[02:23:19.036 --> 02:23:28.639]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:23:28.639 --> 02:23:31.260]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:33.421]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[02:23:33.421 --> 02:23:40.903]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:23:40.903 --> 02:23:45.385]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[02:23:45.885 --> 02:23:52.111]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:23:52.111 --> 02:23:53.452]  You'll be shocked.
[02:23:53.452 --> 02:23:58.677]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[02:23:58.677 --> 02:24:04.162]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:24:04.162 --> 02:24:05.523]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[02:24:12.595 --> 02:24:15.878]  Ira Haysen Ira Haysen
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:37.271]  All right, going back to David Knight here with us in fullworks.com, Nightly News Reporter.
[02:24:37.271 --> 02:24:42.439]  The full clip, we're going to play on the Nightly News tonight when you do another piece on this, but there's a lot of these clips.
[02:24:42.439 --> 02:24:43.660]  Aaron Swartz was a leader
[02:24:44.261 --> 02:24:47.642]  And he was a real liberal, not one of these fake tyrants.
[02:24:47.642 --> 02:24:54.185]  And absolutely, the globalists are already stealing money left and right, $85 billion a month.
[02:24:54.185 --> 02:24:57.146]  All of this is happening, all of this is going on.
[02:24:57.146 --> 02:25:03.228]  They're getting away with everything, but they realize the public is finding out what liars they are, so they want to censor the web.
[02:25:03.228 --> 02:25:04.929]  But isn't the genie already out of the bottle?
[02:25:05.766 --> 02:25:10.650]  Well, people were waking up, and what I was going to show from that clip was that Aaron Schwartz kind of woke up.
[02:25:10.650 --> 02:25:15.293]  Here was a guy that he thought was on his side, because he kind of bought into this left-right paradigm.
[02:25:15.293 --> 02:25:19.457]  It's like, oh, this guy's a good liberal, and so therefore he cares about civil liberties.
[02:25:19.457 --> 02:25:27.223]  And he was surprised to see the anger and the hatred in that guy's attitude when he started talking about, oh, these people on the Internet, they're absolutely out of control.
[02:25:27.223 --> 02:25:32.567]  Exactly what we saw in these press conferences last week, where they said, don't look at anything except what we give you.
[02:25:32.947 --> 02:25:34.048]  Right, and we heard that again.
[02:25:34.048 --> 02:25:36.131]  They actually said, only look at what we give you.
[02:25:36.131 --> 02:25:36.791]  Right, and we heard that.
[02:25:36.791 --> 02:25:39.755]  And they're in the news saying it's bad that citizens can look at photos.
[02:25:39.755 --> 02:25:41.316]  And we heard that at Sandy Hook as well.
[02:25:41.316 --> 02:25:46.502]  They want absolute total control of the flow of information, as well as control over your time.
[02:25:46.502 --> 02:25:49.225]  Yeah, the internet's meant to surveil us, not allow us to surveil them.
[02:25:49.585 --> 02:25:50.426]  Absolutely.
[02:25:50.426 --> 02:25:59.213]  And so he woke up to this and he said, you know, this is not somebody weighing the pluses and minuses of what would be good policy as he would think from a liberal perspective.
[02:25:59.213 --> 02:26:02.135]  He said, this is the attitude of a tyrant.
[02:26:02.135 --> 02:26:03.316]  That's the way he ends that clip.
[02:26:03.316 --> 02:26:04.917]  This is the attitude of a tyrant.
[02:26:04.917 --> 02:26:09.381]  And so what we're hoping is, is that people on the left as well as people on the right
[02:26:09.801 --> 02:26:20.949]  Who would not typically care about this, because a lot of times when you mention security and you see a lot of the same people who are fighting so hard to stop the government from taking their Second Amendment rights, they're not really interested in CISPA.
[02:26:20.949 --> 02:26:22.790]  That's not really their issue, or civil liberties.
[02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:25.512]  Because they don't, they think, well I've done nothing wrong.
[02:26:26.352 --> 02:26:27.913]  So what if they surveil me?
[02:26:27.913 --> 02:26:31.694]  The government's run by foreign banks and mercenary groups.
[02:26:31.694 --> 02:26:35.275]  They want to use it to plant stuff on you, to control you.
[02:26:35.275 --> 02:26:38.776]  You're like, well, why is it wrong if they went door-to-door and made people come out with their hands up?
[02:26:38.776 --> 02:26:40.316]  What's wrong with that?
[02:26:40.316 --> 02:26:45.417]  If they can do that, they can condition people for the door-to-door gun confiscation.
[02:26:45.417 --> 02:26:47.338]  You know, you're like, what do I have to hide of the troops?
[02:26:47.978 --> 02:26:51.480]  Check my bag and look at my papers.
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:52.580]  I'm a good guy.
[02:26:52.580 --> 02:26:54.221]  What if they're on a bad mission?
[02:26:54.221 --> 02:26:57.903]  There's a reason we have a Bill of Rights and Constitution and checks and balances.
[02:26:57.903 --> 02:27:00.824]  Because it will always be used to abuse us.
[02:27:00.824 --> 02:27:03.705]  And it's not about things like fighter jet plans being put out there.
[02:27:03.705 --> 02:27:09.988]  It's about things like State Department memos being leaked by WikiLeaks that show their criminal actions of what they've been planning.
[02:27:10.168 --> 02:27:20.352]  Yeah, they don't want it out with, exactly, they don't want them going, we're criminals and murder these people and yeah, torture these people and torture their families and we do the criminal now, the unconstitutional later.
[02:27:20.352 --> 02:27:21.752]  That's right, exactly.
[02:27:21.752 --> 02:27:23.693]  That's the memo that came out from Henry Kissinger.
[02:27:23.693 --> 02:27:28.055]  We do the illegal, we do immediately, the unconstitutional takes a little while longer.
[02:27:28.055 --> 02:27:29.175]  That came out in WikiLeaks.
[02:27:29.175 --> 02:27:30.656]  They don't want you to see that kind of stuff.
[02:27:31.036 --> 02:27:33.818]  So that's why they want to get a gag around the internet.
[02:27:33.818 --> 02:27:37.380]  That's why they want to get their hands around the throat of the internet and stop this kind of stuff.
[02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:45.885]  Hey, people in the federal government, they had a colonel the week before 9-11 write an article in the Washington Post saying the government may stage a terror attack trying to warn people.
[02:27:45.885 --> 02:27:49.887]  A year before 9-11, they accidentally declassified the stacks northwards.
[02:27:50.487 --> 02:27:52.169]  They're trying to warn us.
[02:27:52.169 --> 02:27:53.731]  There's good people in there.
[02:27:53.731 --> 02:27:55.933]  And look at how they're going after all the whistleblowers.
[02:27:55.933 --> 02:27:56.314]  Right.
[02:27:56.314 --> 02:27:56.995]  Oh yeah.
[02:27:56.995 --> 02:28:05.364]  Back in North Carolina, Senator Richard Burr, before I came out here, he put in a bill specifically to go after whistleblowers.
[02:28:05.364 --> 02:28:06.886]  Very harsh penalties for whistleblowers.
[02:28:06.886 --> 02:28:07.546]  Whistleblowers.
[02:28:07.546 --> 02:28:09.168]  They're trying to shut this down.
[02:28:09.168 --> 02:28:12.510]  And even if you don't have anything to hide, they have something to hide.
[02:28:12.510 --> 02:28:13.331]  And we need to know.
[02:28:13.331 --> 02:28:15.552]  Hey, they're calling whistleblowing.
[02:28:15.552 --> 02:28:17.213]  They're wanting to put you in jail.
[02:28:17.213 --> 02:28:20.075]  It's basically making everything in government classified.
[02:28:20.075 --> 02:28:20.536]  Yes.
[02:28:20.536 --> 02:28:26.220]  And then, well, you've seen the cops trying to put people in jail for life if you film them in public.
[02:28:26.220 --> 02:28:27.941]  The government is out of control.
[02:28:27.941 --> 02:28:29.042]  It's the danger.
[02:28:29.042 --> 02:28:29.542]  Right.
[02:28:29.542 --> 02:28:31.043]  And it uses these stages.
[02:28:31.043 --> 02:28:34.486]  In one minute, what do you make now of the Boston stuff?
[02:28:35.646 --> 02:28:42.774]  Well, I just, it doesn't, the pattern of the younger brother just doesn't look like he's somebody that was involved in this, that he knew what was going on.
[02:28:42.774 --> 02:28:47.880]  I mean, he's tweeting after this happened, he's going to a party Thursday night.
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:53.546]  They went on the run after their pictures were put up, that they were being looked at.
[02:28:54.026 --> 02:28:56.288]  And now it looks like they arrested the brother and executed him.
[02:28:56.288 --> 02:28:57.109]  Right, right.
[02:28:57.109 --> 02:29:05.376]  And it didn't make any sense looking at the early pictures, his attitude with his cap flipped back, not trying to hide his face, his backpack the wrong color and everything.
[02:29:05.376 --> 02:29:11.300]  And now we see all this stuff about how they pumped the boat full of lead just like they did Bonnie and Clyde or something.
[02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:13.702]  I mean, you know, it's very suspicious.
[02:29:13.702 --> 02:29:17.165]  And then he gets out and is able to get out, but minutes later, oh, he's almost dead.
[02:29:18.188 --> 02:29:25.834]  Yeah, it looks like he's walking, and then, exactly, they've got pictures of it, looks like they walked him out of the boat, and then he's close to death the next time you see him.
[02:29:25.834 --> 02:29:35.561]  Just like the brother, it appears, might have been the one who was the naked man in the video, and then all of a sudden he's riddled with bullets and run over and that sort of thing, or, you know, turns up dead.
[02:29:36.232 --> 02:29:38.674]  Yeah, I mean, look at how they burned up Dorner and lied about it.
[02:29:38.674 --> 02:29:40.155]  I mean, there's no telling.
[02:29:40.155 --> 02:29:42.056]  And again, it's the classic cover-up.
[02:29:42.056 --> 02:29:45.978]  And again, folks, I've had police, when I was growing up, threaten to frame me for stuff.
[02:29:45.978 --> 02:29:48.120]  I mean, it's well known they do this.
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:49.861]  And boy, you look at the police in Boston.
[02:29:49.861 --> 02:29:54.364]  I mean, the way they're acting, their body language saying, press, we'll kill you if you don't shut up.
[02:29:54.364 --> 02:29:56.625]  This is all about a federal globalist power grab.
[02:29:56.625 --> 02:29:58.006]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:29:58.006 --> 02:29:59.407]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.407 --> 02:30:01.949]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.949 --> 02:30:04.611]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.477 --> 02:30:15.317]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

[02:31:09.167 --> 02:31:17.710]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[02:31:17.710 --> 02:31:21.392]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[02:31:21.392 --> 02:31:25.853]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?

[02:32:12.448 --> 02:32:18.492]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:32:18.492 --> 02:32:22.375]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:15.803]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:15.803 --> 02:33:21.786]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.786 --> 02:33:33.993]  Alright, I'm gonna jam in five or six of your calls right now, and then go to Joel Skousen to get his take on all this.
[02:33:33.993 --> 02:33:35.954]  We haven't had him on since the day after the event.
[02:33:37.302 --> 02:33:41.105]  He believes it had all the tell-tale signs of a false flag staged event.
[02:33:41.105 --> 02:33:43.768]  Self-inflicted wound.
[02:33:43.768 --> 02:33:45.549]  Now it's got more signs than ever.
[02:33:45.549 --> 02:33:47.311]  We know there was a drill.
[02:33:47.311 --> 02:33:49.413]  We know they lied about that.
[02:33:49.413 --> 02:33:52.055]  We know they had a bunch of patsies on scene.
[02:33:52.055 --> 02:33:56.319]  As of Wednesday, they were going to go with its right-wingers.
[02:33:56.319 --> 02:33:59.261]  And they had White House people out saying, yeah, that's who it's going to be.
[02:33:59.261 --> 02:34:00.462]  Wait until the next day.
[02:34:00.462 --> 02:34:02.564]  There's going to be something big happen.
[02:34:02.564 --> 02:34:03.565]  And they flipped the script.
[02:34:04.977 --> 02:34:09.438]  That looks like set up some of their patsies who they may have actually had plant the bombs.
[02:34:09.438 --> 02:34:11.739]  Which is a good lesson to you out there.
[02:34:11.739 --> 02:34:14.080]  Like Tim McVeigh and others.
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:15.400]  You do not want to be part of this.
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:16.980]  They will set you up in a minute.
[02:34:16.980 --> 02:34:22.962]  McVeigh was real mad about the mission and told Terry Nichols and others about it about a week before.
[02:34:22.962 --> 02:34:26.663]  But he still went ahead with it because he was under orders.
[02:34:26.663 --> 02:34:28.144]  And you know what they did to him?
[02:34:28.144 --> 02:34:29.424]  Same thing with Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:34:31.428 --> 02:34:36.969]  And now it's just hands down the FBI knew who they were when they put their picture up.
[02:34:36.969 --> 02:34:42.111]  And then called him up, if the mother's accurate, and said, we're gonna come on by and get you.
[02:34:42.111 --> 02:34:51.813]  And then they, for whatever reason, drugged him up, or had already shot him, laid him out, ran over him, and then shot him up a bunch more.
[02:34:53.100 --> 02:35:05.828]  And then they wanted that other brother bad, and they tried to kill him, but media had gotten their cameras on it so they were unable, after shooting hundreds of rounds into it, when he actually got up, oh my goodness, you know, he's unarmed with his hands up.
[02:35:05.828 --> 02:35:07.169]  Don't worry, we'll get him in the tent!
[02:35:08.430 --> 02:35:11.913]  Get medical personnel over here to help him out.
[02:35:11.913 --> 02:35:14.556]  But it was a little too obvious if he had died on the spot, they made the call.
[02:35:14.556 --> 02:35:17.199]  Hey, the kid doesn't know the whole story.
[02:35:17.199 --> 02:35:18.420]  Well, try him.
[02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:28.770]  Suspect charged in Boston bombing case, still in serious condition with gunshot wounds, was arraigned in the hospital Monday on federal charges in connection with Boston Marathon.
[02:35:28.770 --> 02:35:32.874]  And he wasn't given Miranda so far, and is, quote, drugged being asked questions.
[02:35:34.366 --> 02:35:37.309]  You can put somebody on Halcyon and say, hey, you committed murders, didn't you?
[02:35:37.309 --> 02:35:37.949]  Yeah, I did.
[02:35:37.949 --> 02:35:39.791]  And you're Superman, too, aren't you?
[02:35:39.791 --> 02:35:40.532]  Yeah, I am.
[02:35:40.532 --> 02:35:43.114]  And you're also a Cabler Elf, right?
[02:35:43.114 --> 02:35:43.714]  Yeah, I am.
[02:35:43.714 --> 02:35:46.037]  Living in that big green tree.
[02:35:46.037 --> 02:35:50.881]  I mean, they now drug up the Aurora shooter for trial.
[02:35:50.881 --> 02:35:52.743]  I mean, just give me a break.
[02:35:52.743 --> 02:35:57.467]  I guess North Vietnam drugging our pilots was good then.
[02:35:57.467 --> 02:35:58.728]  Let's go to Julio in Illinois.
[02:35:58.728 --> 02:35:59.989]  Then we got our guest coming on.
[02:35:59.989 --> 02:36:00.550]  Go ahead, Julio.
[02:36:02.466 --> 02:36:13.274]  Oh man, Alex, it's kind of comical and sad at the same time watching this continuous narrative being thrown at us by Big Brother and the corporate media.
[02:36:13.274 --> 02:36:20.240]  You know, if this were a movie, it would be kind of like a sick comedy because the public knows what's going on.
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:22.101]  Well, most of the public, I should say.
[02:36:22.101 --> 02:36:25.384]  And yet, Big Brother's throwing this narrative at us.
[02:36:25.384 --> 02:36:29.847]  They shut down a big metropolitan city like Boston for a 19-year-old kid.
[02:36:29.847 --> 02:36:32.189]  I mean, that's a joke.
[02:36:32.999 --> 02:36:36.201]  For them to throw this narrative at us.
[02:36:36.201 --> 02:36:44.787]  I remember I stood up all night, Thursday night into Friday morning, and they said the naked guy was suspect number one, initial report.
[02:36:44.787 --> 02:36:48.690]  And then within a half hour to an hour, oh wait, it's not him.
[02:36:48.690 --> 02:36:49.991]  It was just someone else.
[02:36:49.991 --> 02:36:53.293]  They wanted him naked because he had, he may have had bomb residue on him.
[02:37:03.099 --> 02:37:06.384]  Yeah, they said you cannot film them on the streets of Chicago.
[02:37:06.384 --> 02:37:07.245]  Yes.
[02:37:07.245 --> 02:37:08.506]  Right.
[02:37:08.506 --> 02:37:13.212]  I mentioned a document from Homeland Security and the FBI.
[02:37:13.212 --> 02:37:20.261]  They did a roll call after the Aurora shootings about how they were going to be bombing at large gatherings.
[02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:23.963]  And here we are, a year later, and then boom, it happens.
[02:37:23.963 --> 02:37:25.083]  This is a false flag.
[02:37:25.083 --> 02:37:30.568]  They tell us what happens years beforehand, just like Operation Amalgam Virgo, two months, ten days before 9-11.
[02:37:30.568 --> 02:37:34.110]  Bin Laden's picture on the document.
[02:37:34.110 --> 02:37:37.893]  Of an exercise that happened on 9-11, it's the same thing.
[02:37:37.893 --> 02:37:40.515]  They're telling us in advance what's going to happen.
[02:37:40.515 --> 02:37:48.481]  They tell the police, they get everything ready, it happens, and oh, now we have to give up more rights, as Peter King of New York tells us, or Miss Lindsey Graham.
[02:37:48.641 --> 02:38:13.243]  Well yeah, I mean that's what really tells you what's happening is the police think we're such animals they now do proctology exams on the side of the street in Austin, Texas and other areas or the state police do on the highway with the same glove multiple women for orifices just off the chart stuff and now in Boston the videos are emerging where they would just go door-to-door and say come out and have families
[02:38:13.843 --> 02:38:21.113]  You know, with their children, you name it, come out with their hands up and the cops would get in their face and grab on them.
[02:38:21.113 --> 02:38:23.956]  And I'm telling you, it's illegal, it's unlawful, it's martial law.
[02:38:24.799 --> 02:38:26.240]  And they call it security.
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:27.600]  They call it national security.
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:39.326]  And yes, you were on as a guest, reporting for We Are Change, with all the footage that made the news, where the TSA is on the streets now, saying you can't film them as they search people's bags and stuff, without warrants.
[02:38:39.326 --> 02:38:45.829]  And it's just all part of the new government takeover, where they're the new class, they're the new God, and it's all part of the conditioning.
[02:38:45.829 --> 02:38:50.171]  And this is what they train kids in public schools during drills, to come out with their hands up.
[02:38:51.714 --> 02:38:54.665]  And again, even if you look nothing like the people, just door-to-door.
[02:38:56.245 --> 02:38:58.206]  I mean, it's so pathetic.
[02:38:58.206 --> 02:38:59.546]  And hey, don't worry, cops.
[02:38:59.546 --> 02:39:01.807]  The globalists are doing this to take your pension funds.
[02:39:01.807 --> 02:39:04.888]  They're doing this getting us ready for the financial collapse.
[02:39:04.888 --> 02:39:08.529]  And through that, we're supposed to all become collectivized and go on food stamps and stuff.
[02:39:08.529 --> 02:39:11.870]  But, I mean, I'm here to tell you, it's illegal.
[02:39:11.870 --> 02:39:16.952]  And if anybody would have said no, they'd have blown your house up, burned it down like Dorner, and said you were a terrorist.
[02:39:16.952 --> 02:39:22.394]  Good, that's more people for them to show off with and act like they're heroes and go after your family.
[02:39:23.226 --> 02:39:25.948]  Well, again, a lot of police are listeners of this show.
[02:39:25.948 --> 02:39:34.794]  And a lot of departments wouldn't act like this, but Boston is a town that I wouldn't even want to enter because it's so creepy.
[02:39:34.794 --> 02:39:37.997]  And the police look like Fred Flintstone.
[02:39:37.997 --> 02:39:43.000]  And of course, after the lockdown ended, somebody found the guy in the boat because he could go outside now.
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:44.842]  And of course, it was outside the lockdown.
[02:39:44.842 --> 02:39:47.023]  Now, Joel Skousen writes for World Affairs Brief.
[02:39:47.023 --> 02:39:47.524]  He's the editor.
[02:39:48.084 --> 02:39:53.127]  Joel Skousen, of course, you can go to his website worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:39:53.127 --> 02:39:55.489]  JoelSkousen.com will also get you there.
[02:39:55.489 --> 02:40:02.614]  We sell his book and I produce the film with him, Strategic Relocation, depending on which region you're in, the safer areas to be in.
[02:40:02.614 --> 02:40:05.936]  Like I live in the Hill Country right outside Austin that he rates as the safest.
[02:40:05.936 --> 02:40:09.258]  Before I read his book, I did my own research and it shows you how accurate it is.
[02:40:09.258 --> 02:40:11.720]  I've been all over the country and it's like, how does he know all this?
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:19.005]  Well, he's worked all over the nation building secure homes for government and wealthy right down to regular folks.
[02:40:19.005 --> 02:40:25.150]  He's written the best-selling book, The Secure Home, all available at InfowarsStore.com, I should add.
[02:40:25.150 --> 02:40:30.774]  And Joel, you just heard Julio, we are Change Reporter, talking about what happened.
[02:40:30.774 --> 02:40:33.316]  But this is a great reason to get out of the city.
[02:40:33.316 --> 02:40:34.778]  What do you make of
[02:40:35.538 --> 02:40:52.046]  Of just the whole psy-op we're seeing, what we now know about Tamerlan, what we now know about the family, the Russians blowing his cover with the FBI and saying, who is this guy you're sending into terror camps that are State Department funded?
[02:40:52.046 --> 02:40:54.427]  Other aliases are coming out in the news.
[02:40:54.427 --> 02:40:56.588]  They were allowed to travel around with other aliases.
[02:40:56.588 --> 02:41:02.891]  Looks like more set-ups and, you know, you kill the spy, but then the little brother, he'll make for good fodder, he's now charged.
[02:41:03.251 --> 02:41:10.625]  Joel, I don't know your take since we talked six days ago, the day after the bombing, on Wednesday or on Tuesday.
[02:41:10.625 --> 02:41:14.052]  What is your take as an expert on false flags, Joel Skousen?
[02:41:15.382 --> 02:41:25.887]  I think Alex, it's very clear that the two brothers were involved in some type of false flag training and operation.
[02:41:25.887 --> 02:41:41.695]  But it was clear to them that when they showed up and when the bombs went off and they fled, and by the way we have video of the younger brother fleeing with his backpack on him, so we know that what the FBI said about him dropping his pack could not have been true.
[02:41:43.010 --> 02:42:11.457]  uh... but that they realized that all something else is going off and they fled uh... i think this is very very typical of what happens when you you set up a patsy you put him in charge or you put in the in with another group of people and you give them a certain assignment to be down at the area so that they can be arrested or that so that they can be filmed but you have other people do the actual explosions to make sure it comes off correctly not leaving it to amateurs
[02:42:12.611 --> 02:42:22.558]  And so I'm very worried that we had, we do have a larger group here, and that larger group has to involve an agent provocateur provided by the FBI.
[02:42:22.558 --> 02:42:35.207]  Almost every single terrorist prosecution of lone individuals planning to bomb something in the United States and Britain have involved what the government says an FBI informant.
[02:42:35.207 --> 02:42:38.309]  But we know that they're much more informants because they admit under oath
[02:42:39.270 --> 02:42:48.393]  In the trials, they in fact provided the hype, they provided the egging them on, they provided the explosives, they provided the plans.
[02:42:48.393 --> 02:42:49.554]  They provided the leadership!
[02:42:49.554 --> 02:42:56.116]  They normally, in some cases, take some two years giving them money, commanding them in the name of Allah to do this.
[02:42:57.315 --> 02:42:57.815]  That's right.
[02:42:57.815 --> 02:43:10.979]  And so I clearly think that these boys were involved in an operation, had gone, or at least Tamerland had been sent back to the Far East in order to get training or to move around.
[02:43:10.979 --> 02:43:14.741]  And that's when the Russians picked him up here and came back.
[02:43:14.741 --> 02:43:20.523]  But, you know, it was obvious from their statements when they came back, they didn't flee.
[02:43:20.523 --> 02:43:23.284]  They went to a party, at least the younger one went to a party.
[02:43:23.284 --> 02:43:24.044]  He seemed normal.
[02:43:25.069 --> 02:43:27.410]  He talked to people as if nothing had happened.
[02:43:27.410 --> 02:43:30.811]  He told his mother that they didn't do it, that he was going to be set up, though.
[02:43:30.811 --> 02:43:38.235]  But I think they knew that when the bomb went off, without whatever participation they'd been briefed for, that they were going to be set up.
[02:43:38.235 --> 02:43:50.019]  I think it was interesting, though, that the police or the FBI called a couple of days after that and talked to them, and yet they didn't arrest them immediately.
[02:43:52.302 --> 02:43:54.023]  I don't know if they wanted them to flee.
[02:43:54.023 --> 02:44:02.325]  I'm still unclear, Alex, what this MIT cop had to do or the carjacking had to do with this.
[02:44:02.325 --> 02:44:07.706]  But one thing I'm really concerned about is what new evidence appears to show.
[02:44:07.706 --> 02:44:20.070]  That Tamerlan, in fact, was captured and told to strip naked in order to check him for bombs and then put in a police car, recognized by the aunt, who said she's 100% sure that this was Tamerlan.
[02:44:20.410 --> 02:44:22.971]  Well, we've got the video, by the way, on InfoWars.com.
[02:44:22.971 --> 02:44:24.651]  In fact, I'll pull that up for viewers in a moment.
[02:44:24.651 --> 02:44:26.132]  Radio listeners can go see it.
[02:44:26.132 --> 02:44:27.572]  It looks like spitting image.
[02:44:27.572 --> 02:44:32.154]  He has a, you know, kind of unique bone structure to his face.
[02:44:32.154 --> 02:44:38.676]  And, again, he was like a boxer playboy type, not religious, reportedly did drugs and things.
[02:44:38.676 --> 02:44:40.697]  I mean, this really fits the M.O., absolutely.
[02:44:40.697 --> 02:44:46.359]  And then now you have witnesses saying they had his body out there and the cops ran over him and then filled him full of holes.
[02:44:46.359 --> 02:44:46.679]  Go ahead.
[02:44:47.259 --> 02:44:52.945]  Yeah, that's the important thing, is that if he was in police custody, then what was he doing out there in a shootout?
[02:44:52.945 --> 02:45:06.518]  Now, I believe this police chief, Mr. DeVoe, must have been making up a tremendous story when he talked to Wolf Blitzer on CNN, because everything that he talked about was false.
[02:45:06.518 --> 02:45:09.060]  You know, as a former military officer, I listened to his
[02:45:11.187 --> 02:45:20.311]  Scenario where he's talking about these two guys approaching this SUV, this roadblock they've got set up, and they get out of the car and they start to have a huge shootout.
[02:45:20.311 --> 02:45:23.372]  Hundreds of rounds being exchanged.
[02:45:23.372 --> 02:45:27.553]  Nobody apparently hit, or if they're wounded, they're back in the car.
[02:45:27.553 --> 02:45:34.376]  And then all of a sudden the older brother supposedly gets out and he starts walking towards them in a suicide manner, you know, shooting at them.
[02:45:34.376 --> 02:45:38.878]  And they wound him and then they say, well, our police guys went and tackled him.
[02:45:39.958 --> 02:45:45.546]  And handcuffed him, and then the younger kid, you know, got in the SUV and drove towards him.
[02:45:45.546 --> 02:45:52.355]  But instead, we have footage that, I mean, not just the face, the shoulders, the bone structure, you know, the boxer body.
[02:45:52.355 --> 02:45:54.858]  Reportedly, you know, they call, they go, we're coming to get you.
[02:45:55.399 --> 02:45:58.800]  They stripped him down, they walk him out, and then they have a fake firefight.
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:02.162]  And you listen to the supposed firefight, it sounds like one way.
[02:46:02.162 --> 02:46:05.944]  I mean, man, this is really bad.
[02:46:05.944 --> 02:46:06.704]  Here's my issue.
[02:46:06.704 --> 02:46:09.125]  It's so sloppy, Joel Skousen.
[02:46:09.125 --> 02:46:13.307]  Again, if you just joined us, editor-in-chief at WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[02:46:13.307 --> 02:46:17.869]  They were saying, White House officials, former White House officials, Axelrod and others,
[02:46:18.909 --> 02:46:23.352]  Tuesday night, they said, look, it's going to be Lone Wolf Domestics by themselves.
[02:46:23.352 --> 02:46:25.953]  By Wednesday, they said, we got them some big announcement.
[02:46:25.953 --> 02:46:27.274]  It's going to be the Tea Party.
[02:46:27.274 --> 02:46:29.435]  They had a celebration on MSNBC, CNN.
[02:46:29.435 --> 02:46:30.116]  I have the clips.
[02:46:30.116 --> 02:46:30.896]  I played them.
[02:46:30.896 --> 02:46:33.618]  They said, yeah, this is going to look like it's Lone Wolf, right, Wayne?
[02:46:33.618 --> 02:46:35.679]  Because they can't help but brag to themselves.
[02:46:35.679 --> 02:46:40.162]  And then something that we and others, that became the number one thing searched on the web that day,
[02:46:40.882 --> 02:46:41.383]  I don't know.
[02:47:04.585 --> 02:47:13.313]  Well, not knowing the complexities of this, I know that they're ad-libbing on the spot, and that's a lot of what they were dealing with right here.
[02:47:13.313 --> 02:47:17.256]  I'm convinced, first of all, there had to be something that the two brothers were involved in.
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:20.302]  And it had to be larger than them.
[02:47:20.302 --> 02:47:22.445]  They were given an assignment to be there.
[02:47:22.445 --> 02:47:29.053]  And they were watched by a federal agent, as you carefully pointed out on one of your videos, and they could have arrested them at the same time.
[02:47:29.053 --> 02:47:36.782]  You know, the FBI had been in contact with these people at least three years before, even though the FBI says only six months ago.
[02:47:37.884 --> 02:47:38.785]  And I think they're lying.
[02:47:38.785 --> 02:47:43.710]  The mother could not have been that far off in her timing when she said three to five years.
[02:47:43.710 --> 02:47:53.740]  Let's just say even if it's three years at the earliest, they said and at the time that they've been watching and tapping every one of their phones, they watch everything on the Internet.
[02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:55.582]  There's no way they could not have known.
[02:47:56.363 --> 02:47:58.104]  What they were planning.
[02:47:58.104 --> 02:48:08.490]  So this proves, Alex, that this is a false flag operation, meaning they're part of a group that they know is planning, they're monitoring all of their emails, they're monitoring all of their internet activity.
[02:48:08.490 --> 02:48:18.796]  That only can mean that they intended this operation to go forward, but they were looking for a couple of the members of this group that they're going to take down as a patsy.
[02:48:18.796 --> 02:48:21.978]  And I don't think we're going to find the so-called rest of the group.
[02:48:23.123 --> 02:48:26.334]  And I think that's one of the reasons why they wanted both these brothers dead.
[02:48:26.334 --> 02:48:28.562]  And we may find out that...
[02:48:30.380 --> 02:48:37.384]  And there's a problem, of course, with Jokhar, the younger, in the sense that he does not appear to be wounded when he comes out of the boat.
[02:48:37.384 --> 02:48:40.165]  And all of a sudden they say there's a self-inflicted gunshot.
[02:48:40.165 --> 02:48:42.707]  He doesn't even have a gun in his hand, Alex.
[02:48:42.707 --> 02:48:46.488]  How could he have done a self-inflicted wound to the throat?
[02:48:46.488 --> 02:48:52.392]  And then five minutes later from the video stills, we slowed him down one by one, it looks like they're doing a tracheotomy on him.
[02:48:52.392 --> 02:48:55.893]  So you're walking, you're walking, and now your throat's cut out.
[02:48:55.893 --> 02:48:57.474]  And then they say he may never talk again.
[02:48:57.474 --> 02:48:58.855]  I mean, this is so obvious.
[02:49:00.526 --> 02:49:13.991]  Well, we've seen a lot of history of false flag operations in this country and, you know, there's a lot of them, going clear back to the battleship Maine, the blowing up of the Maine, the Pearl Harbor is one of the best that we have evidence on.
[02:49:13.991 --> 02:49:21.994]  We have a tremendous amount of evidence on the Oklahoma City bombing, that it had to be larger than the McVeigh bomb, it had to involve multiple bombs.
[02:49:21.994 --> 02:49:25.035]  That's right, Pearl Harbor was a stand down, but still a false flag.
[02:49:25.035 --> 02:49:25.435]  That's right.
[02:49:27.356 --> 02:49:30.679]  And, of course, 9-11, we have tremendous information.
[02:49:30.679 --> 02:49:41.206]  I just reviewed the new video showcasing the life of Stephen Jones, who discovered the thermite and documented the evidence, as well as other scientists.
[02:49:41.206 --> 02:49:47.931]  And it is a foolproof case that the government used explosives in bringing down these towers.
[02:49:47.931 --> 02:49:49.673]  Nanothermite developed by NASA.
[02:49:50.413 --> 02:49:57.956]  That's right, and this was a brand of nanothermite that was even more powerful than the existing nanothermite that they were able to get samples of.
[02:49:57.956 --> 02:50:07.599]  So, we have a tremendous amount of information about these things, and frankly, after listening to Police Chief Durow and others, we simply can't trust anything.
[02:50:07.599 --> 02:50:09.100]  Well, I mean, I go off my gut, too.
[02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:12.621]  I mean, I think that Police Chief comes off like a big, fat gangster to me.
[02:50:13.660 --> 02:50:22.965]  Well, you know, Eric, what I was trying to say before I got interrupted when, you know, as a military officer listening, these guys apparently, according to the police chiefs, throw bombs at them.
[02:50:22.965 --> 02:50:27.648]  Had pipe bombs and had another similar big bomb that put out a big explosion.
[02:50:27.648 --> 02:50:32.731]  First of all, the tape recording don't show that any of those bombings are true.
[02:50:32.731 --> 02:50:34.312]  It's just the police word for it.
[02:50:34.312 --> 02:50:36.053]  And secondarily, are we to believe
[02:50:36.593 --> 02:50:44.599]  That they're going to come out from under the cover of their cars and tackle this guy after he runs out of ammunition, knowing that the brother is still there in the SUV.
[02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:50.803]  With bombs, with weapons, and they're going to come out of their cover and tackle this guy?
[02:50:50.803 --> 02:50:51.784]  It just doesn't make sense.
[02:50:51.784 --> 02:50:56.467]  In fact, we know that from another witness that in fact that never happened.
[02:50:56.467 --> 02:51:00.489]  That in fact it was a police SUV that ran down Tamerlan.
[02:51:00.489 --> 02:51:02.971]  Joel, Joel, I can tell you want to talk more.
[02:51:02.971 --> 02:51:04.532]  We're going to go into overdrive with you if you can do it.
[02:51:04.532 --> 02:51:07.433]  I want you to take your time to lay out all the inconsistencies.
[02:51:07.433 --> 02:51:08.254]  You're doing it very well.
[02:51:08.254 --> 02:51:12.817]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:51:13.576 --> 02:51:16.599]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:51:16.599 --> 02:51:25.569]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:51:25.569 --> 02:51:30.494]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:51:31.107 --> 02:51:42.480]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:49.489]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:51:50.149 --> 02:51:54.472]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:51:54.472 --> 02:51:58.054]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[02:52:05.318 --> 02:52:06.599]  Protect your immune system.
[02:52:06.599 --> 02:52:07.640]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:10.181]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:52:10.181 --> 02:52:12.583]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:52:12.583 --> 02:52:18.007]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:52:18.007 --> 02:52:22.030]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:52:22.030 --> 02:52:25.933]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:52:25.933 --> 02:52:27.314]  The fact is, you are.
[02:52:27.314 --> 02:52:28.334]  We all are.
[02:52:28.334 --> 02:52:30.656]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:52:30.956 --> 02:52:39.444]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[02:52:39.444 --> 02:52:40.825]  Be prepared before you need it.
[02:52:40.825 --> 02:52:44.288]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[02:52:44.288 --> 02:52:46.650]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[02:52:46.650 --> 02:52:51.194]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[02:52:51.194 --> 02:52:57.039]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:52:57.259 --> 02:52:57.880]  We're good to go!
[02:53:25.242 --> 02:53:30.027]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:53:30.027 --> 02:53:34.171]  One World Way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[02:53:34.171 --> 02:53:42.300]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids, and all whey protein powders we've investigated, and most proteins you consume, are heated.
[02:53:42.300 --> 02:53:45.804]  With our TrueCool process, you now have a choice with One World Way.
[02:53:46.184 --> 02:53:47.225]  My name is Daniel.
[02:53:47.225 --> 02:53:48.426]  I'm 34 years old.
[02:53:48.426 --> 02:53:52.389]  When I started using One World Way, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:53:52.389 --> 02:53:55.231]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[02:53:55.231 --> 02:53:57.393]  This is my ideal weight.
[02:53:57.393 --> 02:54:02.077]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[02:54:35.310 --> 02:54:36.852]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:54:36.852 --> 02:54:37.493]  to 2 p.m.
[02:54:37.493 --> 02:54:37.873]  Central.
[02:54:37.873 --> 02:54:42.799]  We're here, but we're going into an hour of overdrive or more to be able to get to all your patient phone calls.
[02:54:42.799 --> 02:54:45.142]  Michael, DC, Dave, everybody.
[02:54:45.142 --> 02:54:48.105]  And I will try through the week to really open the phones up.
[02:54:48.105 --> 02:54:49.467]  I know you guys want to talk.
[02:54:49.467 --> 02:54:52.770]  Will you guys go tell Jakari and David Knight to get suited up?
[02:54:53.351 --> 02:54:59.779]  And be ready to come in here at the bottom of the hour to do a hour of overdrive or more to get everybody's phone calls in.
[02:54:59.779 --> 02:55:00.740]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:55:00.740 --> 02:55:07.928]  I get on air and just get so many data points that it makes my brain burn because I'm frustrated to see the same thing repeating itself.
[02:55:08.749 --> 02:55:11.471]  And it's not my opinion that there's a false flag.
[02:55:11.471 --> 02:55:13.112]  All the signs are there.
[02:55:13.112 --> 02:55:18.255]  I wish this wasn't a false flag, because at least it would just be some little group of crazies.
[02:55:18.255 --> 02:55:20.997]  What's scary is that they're going forward with this.
[02:55:20.997 --> 02:55:28.462]  Joel, I want to, in the next hour with you, have you really lay out all the inconsistencies that you, with precision, are breaking down.
[02:55:28.462 --> 02:55:31.844]  Because I have the same inconsistencies here, but I start hyperventilating.
[02:55:31.844 --> 02:55:32.805]  It gets me so upset.
[02:55:33.505 --> 02:55:34.546]  Uh, to see this happening.
[02:55:34.546 --> 02:55:40.290]  But I wanted to just briefly, before this hour ends, ask you, what is the political reasoning of this?
[02:55:40.290 --> 02:55:41.611]  What is their goal?
[02:55:41.611 --> 02:55:43.052]  Obviously, it's a smoke screen.
[02:55:43.052 --> 02:55:48.155]  And, what do you make of what I call martial law being declared?
[02:55:48.155 --> 02:55:52.978]  And, I mean, let me tell you, the cops shut down a whole city and say, we're coming to your house to aim guns at you and your family.
[02:55:52.978 --> 02:55:54.179]  That's illegal.
[02:55:54.179 --> 02:55:55.800]  And that's a form of assault.
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:55:56.761]  And I've had enough of it.
[02:55:56.761 --> 02:55:59.102]  And I'm not looking for some type of physical deal.
[02:55:59.102 --> 02:55:59.923]  But I've had enough.
[02:55:59.923 --> 02:56:01.764]  Joel Skousen, you're a constitutionalist.
[02:56:01.764 --> 02:56:02.645]  What do you say on that front?
[02:56:03.445 --> 02:56:07.427]  It's interesting, they never used the word martial law in Boston.
[02:56:07.427 --> 02:56:08.488]  Public safety.
[02:56:08.488 --> 02:56:18.173]  And it was just public safety, national security, and they hyped up on everybody's patriotism about this to simply lay down and let the police do anything they want.
[02:56:18.173 --> 02:56:22.075]  Nobody was thinking about saying to the police, no, you can't come in, where's your warrant?
[02:56:22.075 --> 02:56:23.756]  Where's the probable cause?
[02:56:23.756 --> 02:56:28.698]  And that's what happens when you get, that shows the power of this conflict creation motive.
[02:56:28.698 --> 02:56:31.480]  Think what will happen someday when they have nuclear war in America.
[02:56:31.980 --> 02:56:33.922]  They won't have to declare martial law.
[02:56:33.922 --> 02:56:42.471]  They're simply going to start running through the streets and everyone will say, whatever you want to do, whatever it takes, save us from this situation.
[02:56:42.471 --> 02:56:51.882]  So I think it was a very powerful lesson of how far we've moved into, you know, exceeding to... America failed a big test Friday.
[02:56:53.021 --> 02:56:54.281]  It did indeed.
[02:56:54.281 --> 02:56:56.742]  It did indeed.
[02:56:56.742 --> 02:57:04.283]  Let me walk through, first of all, these big inconsistencies before I answer the general question on where I think they're taking us for this.
[02:57:04.283 --> 02:57:22.086]  In the first place, it's very important to understand that we have forensic evidence that shows that at least one of the explosions, the backpack that housed that explosive, was a black backpack that had a square label on it and it had white strips on the black straps that were on the pack.
[02:57:23.343 --> 02:57:32.891]  Neither the pack of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev or his brother Tamerlan match that description.
[02:57:32.891 --> 02:57:40.237]  Number two, we have the video of Dzhokhar fleeing the scene after the bombing with his pack on his back.
[02:57:40.237 --> 02:57:42.719]  So, he did not plant the bomb.
[02:57:43.601 --> 02:57:46.503]  His brother did not plant the bomb that went off.
[02:57:46.503 --> 02:57:48.544]  Now that means that someone else did it.
[02:57:48.544 --> 02:57:55.507]  And it's very, very suspicious the government would point to only these two people when obviously someone else planted the bomb.
[02:57:55.507 --> 02:57:58.028]  And say whatever you do, don't look at anybody else.
[02:57:58.028 --> 02:57:58.829]  Very suspicious.
[02:57:59.409 --> 02:57:59.869]  That's right.
[02:57:59.869 --> 02:58:00.830]  I mean, they knew.
[02:58:00.830 --> 02:58:11.937]  There's some tremendous independent research went on, and it was especially focusing on these other private security contractors, one of which did lose his pack.
[02:58:11.937 --> 02:58:17.160]  The packs did match, in fact, the explosive profile with the square patch on the back.
[02:58:17.160 --> 02:58:25.445]  And I'm not saying it's enough conclusive evidence to say that one of those... But they were clearly in the area expecting some type of activity.
[02:58:25.905 --> 02:58:34.667]  And they had moved away from where the bomb actually went off, were in another position, and they did not react as first responders when it went off.
[02:58:34.667 --> 02:58:39.869]  Not whatsoever, except to get on their radios and telephones immediately and start to communicate about them.
[02:58:39.869 --> 02:58:44.270]  But we are left begging the question, what are these big backpacks that they're all wearing, have on them?
[02:58:44.270 --> 02:58:47.411]  Stay there, back in 60 seconds with Joel Scales and I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:47.411 --> 02:58:51.652]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:58.830 --> 02:59:00.771]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.

[02:59:18.035 --> 02:59:19.035]  We all are.
[02:59:19.035 --> 02:59:21.376]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[02:59:48.157 --> 02:59:48.877]  We're good to go.
[03:00:13.598 --> 03:00:18.442]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:18.442 --> 03:00:20.023]  You want answers?
[03:00:20.023 --> 03:00:21.585]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:21.585 --> 03:00:25.768]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:25.768 --> 03:00:29.831]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:34.215 --> 03:00:35.295]  All right, we're into overdrive.
[03:00:35.295 --> 03:00:42.138]  Many stations continue to carry this broadcast, like the folks picking up the broadcast there in Jacksonville, Florida.
[03:00:42.138 --> 03:00:43.479]  They have to pick it up 24 hours a day.
[03:00:43.479 --> 03:00:45.080]  Very exciting.
[03:00:45.080 --> 03:00:46.040]  Joel Scousers, our guest.
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:52.983]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up, and I will get to your calls, folks that are holding.
[03:00:52.983 --> 03:00:55.684]  Okay, we're now getting to the point of the question.
[03:00:55.684 --> 03:00:56.965]  This is only a five-minute segment.
[03:00:58.053 --> 03:01:00.616]  Of what is the motive in all of this?
[03:01:00.616 --> 03:01:03.438]  I mean, it's the classic thing of letters being mailed out.
[03:01:03.438 --> 03:01:07.642]  They have a mentally ill Patsy on that, just like the anthrax is a continued cover.
[03:01:07.642 --> 03:01:09.364]  You've got CISPA.
[03:01:09.364 --> 03:01:10.965]  You've got the immigration bill.
[03:01:10.965 --> 03:01:14.128]  You've got giving Homeland Security more power.
[03:01:14.128 --> 03:01:16.170]  You've got America failing the test.
[03:01:16.170 --> 03:01:21.034]  You know, USA means being under martial law.
[03:01:21.034 --> 03:01:22.416]  What else do you see happening here, Joel?
[03:01:23.700 --> 03:01:26.461]  Well, I don't, once again, think that martial law is imminent.
[03:01:26.461 --> 03:01:29.002]  This is one of the acclimating type things.
[03:01:29.002 --> 03:01:30.343]  There will be many more.
[03:01:30.343 --> 03:01:33.444]  Even Obama said there's going to be more terrorist attacks.
[03:01:33.444 --> 03:01:41.167]  I think the number one motive for this is that it had been a long time since we'd had another one of these high-profile terror attacks.
[03:01:41.787 --> 03:01:44.652]  Remember, we don't have any normal terrorism in the United States.
[03:01:44.652 --> 03:01:55.889]  Normal terrorism would look like people coming across the border among the thousands of illegal aliens that come across daily, and they'd be blowing up electrical pylons, they'd be setting off suicide bombers in malls.
[03:01:56.994 --> 03:01:58.816]  Small, non-high-profile things.
[03:01:58.816 --> 03:02:03.602]  These high-profile things are always a sign that there is something to be gained.
[03:02:03.602 --> 03:02:03.942]  That's right.
[03:02:03.942 --> 03:02:06.024]  Real terrorists hit train tracks.
[03:02:06.024 --> 03:02:06.785]  That's right.
[03:02:06.785 --> 03:02:09.008]  This is a propaganda stunt.
[03:02:09.008 --> 03:02:15.014]  And, you know, you and I have discussed, and I know I've heard you say this before, and I've said it before in my World Affairs Brief,
[03:02:15.635 --> 03:02:22.142]  That they've got to have another major terrorist event in order to keep people believing in this war on terror.
[03:02:22.142 --> 03:02:23.984]  There was a great deal of fatigue about it.
[03:02:23.984 --> 03:02:24.966]  People are tired of it.
[03:02:24.966 --> 03:02:30.512]  Oh no, we've been saying attacks are imminent because every TV show, the dramas are all about this now.
[03:02:30.512 --> 03:02:31.413]  You can see the scripting.
[03:02:32.506 --> 03:02:38.830]  And so they eventually had to make a self-fulfilling prophecy come true, and I think that was the major role of this.
[03:02:38.830 --> 03:02:45.995]  The secondary role is that this is going to give a greater justification to build homeland security into the major domestic police force.
[03:02:45.995 --> 03:02:47.396]  They won't need UN troops.
[03:02:47.396 --> 03:02:49.338]  We're going to have hundreds of thousands of other
[03:02:49.998 --> 03:03:04.464]  You know, people brought in to Homeland Security and they're going to be militarized to the extent, I was shocked at how much top military, automatic weapons, armored personnel carrier that they brought out for this.
[03:03:04.464 --> 03:03:08.665]  If they don't have this stockpiled in Boston, then they brought it out from a long way away.
[03:03:08.665 --> 03:03:12.727]  No, no, no, that's what I, my military sources, not that they're even high level, they're there.
[03:03:12.727 --> 03:03:17.549]  They say there's caches of warrior fighting vehicles, all of it, everywhere for this.
[03:03:19.028 --> 03:03:28.354]  And so this is really disturbing, Alex, that there's this much firepower in one urban area of the United States that was brought to bear on this.
[03:03:28.354 --> 03:03:32.256]  And the surprising thing is they didn't even have to declare martial law.
[03:03:32.256 --> 03:03:35.098]  They just said, everybody stay in your homes, and everybody stayed in their homes.
[03:03:35.098 --> 03:03:37.739]  I mean, shut down everything, essentially.
[03:03:37.739 --> 03:03:40.141]  And some people disregarded it, but very, very few.
[03:03:41.281 --> 03:03:47.328]  Let me, before you continue, let me just finish my train of thought before this on these anomalies.
[03:03:47.328 --> 03:03:51.053]  It's very important to understand that the FBI knew where these two brothers were.
[03:03:51.053 --> 03:03:52.294]  They knew where they lived.
[03:03:52.294 --> 03:03:54.797]  They had been to their home before.
[03:03:54.797 --> 03:03:56.219]  That is, white side agents.
[03:03:56.219 --> 03:03:56.759]  I think when the
[03:03:57.848 --> 03:04:01.471]  Russians responded and put out an interrogative with the FBI.
[03:04:01.471 --> 03:04:07.174]  They don't send over the dark side operators who are running these domestic terrorist groups.
[03:04:07.174 --> 03:04:09.736]  They send over white side guys to do an interview.
[03:04:09.736 --> 03:04:11.938]  And that's why they were so open about warning them.
[03:04:11.938 --> 03:04:13.499]  Look, we've got information about terrorism.
[03:04:13.499 --> 03:04:14.499]  They're watching your internet.
[03:04:14.499 --> 03:04:16.341]  They admitted all of these things.
[03:04:16.341 --> 03:04:23.105]  So if they were truly the bombers involved, why would they go back to their house knowing that the FBI knew where they live?
[03:04:23.105 --> 03:04:25.127]  The FBI calls them at their house.
[03:04:25.127 --> 03:04:26.227]  They answer the phone.
[03:04:27.228 --> 03:04:29.650]  Why, do you see, would that happen?
[03:04:29.650 --> 03:04:33.393]  Why didn't they just go over and arrest them, rather than call them beforehand?
[03:04:33.393 --> 03:04:35.514]  I'll tell you what I think.
[03:04:35.514 --> 03:04:45.802]  I think they wanted to flush them out and make them run, so that they would have an excuse to kill them, so that they would be dead and dead men can't talk.
[03:04:45.802 --> 03:04:51.627]  I think that's what... Alright, recap that, because how is the controlled media, when we come back, gonna hide all this?
[03:04:52.327 --> 03:04:57.473]  When you've got what looks like him naked being put in a car, his aunt says no, that's him, they came and got him.
[03:04:57.473 --> 03:05:04.580]  You've got the brother partying the night before he's killed, you know, or shot, not killed, injured, running around.
[03:05:04.580 --> 03:05:07.043]  I mean, this is unbelievably sloppy.
[03:05:07.043 --> 03:05:07.484]  Stay with us.
[03:05:09.418 --> 03:05:10.658]  Start life over.

[03:05:12.739 --> 03:05:14.200]  Take more vacations.
[03:05:14.200 --> 03:05:15.500]  Own your own business.
[03:05:15.500 --> 03:05:19.221]  Be healthy and earn the kind of income you've always dreamed of.
[03:05:19.221 --> 03:05:20.321]  Is it possible?
[03:05:20.321 --> 03:05:20.882]  Yes!

[03:08:09.392 --> 03:08:14.916]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:26.172 --> 03:08:30.875]  It is incredibly transparent what's happening here.
[03:08:30.875 --> 03:08:33.576]  You've got the intelligence agency connections to the brothers.
[03:08:33.576 --> 03:08:36.218]  You've got him being reportedly brought to the car.
[03:08:36.218 --> 03:08:37.158]  It's him.
[03:08:37.158 --> 03:08:37.859]  And then dead.
[03:08:37.859 --> 03:08:40.840]  And witnesses saying, no, they put him in the street and ran over him.
[03:08:40.840 --> 03:08:43.942]  And then shot him full of holes.
[03:08:43.942 --> 03:08:45.263]  I mean, this is just outrageous.
[03:08:45.263 --> 03:08:46.543]  And they tried to kill the other brother.
[03:08:46.543 --> 03:08:48.445]  I was listening to the scanners live.
[03:08:48.445 --> 03:08:49.865]  They had him over Ustream.
[03:08:49.865 --> 03:08:52.167]  The Boston police are like, oh no, the media's got him.
[03:08:52.887 --> 03:08:59.889]  Pull him back, and they couldn't stop the media showing the boat they'd shot full of holes, hundreds of holes.
[03:08:59.889 --> 03:09:07.712]  Looks like 30, 40 yards of cops with, you know, full auto opening up on that boat trying to, quote, kill the suspect.
[03:09:07.712 --> 03:09:13.874]  Then they go over and he just stands up, and now they knew the media had a live feed, because this all happened in like five minutes.
[03:09:14.793 --> 03:09:19.239]  Because the media had gotten around and was filming from above from a building.
[03:09:19.239 --> 03:09:22.704]  And I was listening to the police going, the colonel says get him out of there.
[03:09:22.704 --> 03:09:24.526]  No, no, hold on.
[03:09:24.526 --> 03:09:26.910]  And you can hear them all trying to talk with code.
[03:09:26.910 --> 03:09:29.293]  The average cop, of course, is compartmentalized as well.
[03:09:30.114 --> 03:09:31.195]  And then he stands up.
[03:09:31.195 --> 03:09:31.815]  Okay, he's fine.
[03:09:31.815 --> 03:09:32.615]  He walks over.
[03:09:32.615 --> 03:09:33.756]  Minutes later, oh, he can't talk.
[03:09:33.756 --> 03:09:35.637]  He may die.
[03:09:35.637 --> 03:09:37.498]  They do not want him talking to people.
[03:09:37.498 --> 03:09:42.101]  And again, he's a 19-year-old kid, probably being tagging along with his brother.
[03:09:42.101 --> 03:09:46.283]  Joel Skousen, you were bringing up the point of why it's now coming out.
[03:09:46.283 --> 03:09:55.668]  The mother says that they called them after the bombing, and then they called him right before they came and arrested him, Tamerlan, the older one, and they ended up dead.
[03:09:57.977 --> 03:10:01.121]  And now the witness is coming out contradicting what the police said.
[03:10:01.121 --> 03:10:04.705]  Again, this is not going well for them.
[03:10:04.705 --> 03:10:07.428]  What are other points you think are important to make here?
[03:10:07.428 --> 03:10:12.073]  Well, the most important point is there is no reason to ever telephone someone
[03:10:12.794 --> 03:10:17.059]  That you've already announced to the world these are the people that we're looking for.
[03:10:17.059 --> 03:10:20.422]  Why telephone them unless you want to flush them out?
[03:10:20.422 --> 03:10:21.984]  I mean, they even knew where they lived!
[03:10:21.984 --> 03:10:24.786]  They were sitting in the residence where the FBI had been before.
[03:10:24.786 --> 03:10:29.972]  There's no way that they wouldn't just show up at the door and arrest them if that was their intent.
[03:10:29.972 --> 03:10:34.236]  The telephone call, in my opinion, was meant to flush them out so they would go on the run.
[03:10:35.297 --> 03:10:40.323]  And then on the run, they could run them into a police situation where they could kill them.
[03:10:40.323 --> 03:10:42.285]  And that's exactly what happened.
[03:10:42.285 --> 03:10:48.312]  Though I think it got a little bit complex with the fact that they end up trying to hijack a car in order to get some ATM money.
[03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:57.423]  Uh, and they have this other SUV, but clearly I think the police have them under surveillance for the time they leave their house.
[03:10:57.423 --> 03:11:08.126]  And so they're waiting for the proper time to get the non-conspirator police involved and set up and kind of funneled into this roadblock situation.
[03:11:08.126 --> 03:11:09.247]  Of course, they're tracking them.
[03:11:09.787 --> 03:11:17.250]  They claimed that they were tracking them by the cell phone that the hijacked SUV left behind in the car, but I don't believe that.
[03:11:17.250 --> 03:11:19.532]  I think that they had them tracked from the time they left their...
[03:11:21.071 --> 03:11:28.997]  The apartment building and intended to kill them both and that's why they've got I think they had to hurt the throat of the person.
[03:11:28.997 --> 03:11:30.037]  They saw them get out.
[03:11:30.037 --> 03:11:37.142]  They couldn't simply say that he was dead on arrival because people and the media saw him walk out of that boat.
[03:11:37.142 --> 03:11:39.904]  He wasn't dripping blood everywhere.
[03:11:39.904 --> 03:11:41.945]  So I think they had to invent something else.
[03:11:41.945 --> 03:11:44.427]  This is a really a sloppy operation.
[03:11:45.993 --> 03:11:52.538]  And they're almost always sloppy, but in the past there wasn't cameras everywhere to pick up every angle of this.
[03:11:52.538 --> 03:11:58.462]  And now they're calling to censor citizen video and media because it, quote, got in the way of the investigation.
[03:11:58.462 --> 03:12:01.384]  That's all over the news today when it's the opposite.
[03:12:01.384 --> 03:12:12.112]  But, you know, my dad said to me last night when I went over and visited him and my mom for a bite to eat, he said, he goes, you know, it's they're so obviously guilty when they're like, don't look at anything else.
[03:12:12.112 --> 03:12:13.914]  And our reporter takes over the press conference.
[03:12:14.754 --> 03:12:19.118]  And, you know, says we have the photos of the other people at Infowars.com.
[03:12:19.118 --> 03:12:23.541]  We got 16 million extra visitors that day alone.
[03:12:23.541 --> 03:12:27.444]  It's got to shake up the system to know that you're out there, I'm out there.
[03:12:27.444 --> 03:12:30.487]  The White House says don't listen to the Drudge Report.
[03:12:31.227 --> 03:12:33.429]  What do you make of the Saudi connections as well?
[03:12:33.429 --> 03:12:38.614]  Because, you know, okay, there's some Saudis there, but this guy does have family on the terror watch list.
[03:12:38.614 --> 03:12:40.275]  They did have the ambassador visit.
[03:12:40.275 --> 03:12:42.717]  They are acting very suspicious.
[03:12:42.717 --> 03:12:44.879]  They are ignoring all this other stuff.
[03:12:44.879 --> 03:12:51.825]  I mean, from studying past false flags, they'll usually have five or six groups there, like Oklahoma City, so they can blame whoever they want.
[03:12:53.018 --> 03:13:01.602]  Well, the Saudis are an interesting case because they were very much involved in providing most of the hijackers for the 9-11.
[03:13:01.602 --> 03:13:03.683]  And there were hijackers there.
[03:13:03.683 --> 03:13:07.944]  This was a government operation from beginning to end, but they hired hijackers.
[03:13:07.944 --> 03:13:09.005]  In fact, I'm convinced
[03:13:09.685 --> 03:13:18.553]  That these hijackers got training in large aircraft in Saudi Arabia or another Middle Eastern country where they could get their hand, where the governments themselves provided this training.
[03:13:18.553 --> 03:13:20.715]  You didn't get that from flying Cessnas.
[03:13:20.715 --> 03:13:22.657]  It's just too complex an airplane.
[03:13:22.657 --> 03:13:24.839]  And I say that as a pilot.
[03:13:24.839 --> 03:13:30.584]  It would be very difficult even a military... Who just famously survived an aircraft that say nobody else has recently.
[03:13:31.425 --> 03:13:37.491]  Well, even as a military fighter pilot myself, it would be very difficult for me to handle one of those large aircraft.
[03:13:37.491 --> 03:13:41.034]  The complexity, the switches, and... And you were a carrier pilot.
[03:13:41.034 --> 03:13:42.836]  They say that's the hardest thing out there.
[03:13:42.836 --> 03:13:43.877]  That's right.
[03:13:43.877 --> 03:13:51.104]  So, I'm not buying that the hijackers, you know... What about the maneuvers of Honey Honjour that 9 out of 10 pilots say they couldn't even do?
[03:13:52.301 --> 03:13:59.644]  Well, personally, I don't think that the hijackers were, in fact, actually flying the planes that ended up going into the World Trade Center.
[03:13:59.644 --> 03:14:00.525]  Oh, I agree, yeah.
[03:14:00.525 --> 03:14:11.150]  Because, for example, the second plane that went into the World Trade Center had a huge modification on the bottom of it, a bulging area, which was probably a fuel enhancement area in tank.
[03:14:11.770 --> 03:14:15.872]  I think that they were probably under remote control at that point.
[03:14:15.872 --> 03:14:20.754]  Clearly the Pentagon aircraft were very difficult to fly.
[03:14:20.754 --> 03:14:24.116]  I think that there were two aircraft involved in the Pentagon.
[03:14:24.116 --> 03:14:27.238]  The proof of that is that there was a large portion of the radome
[03:14:28.131 --> 03:14:28.451]  I don't know.
[03:14:49.602 --> 03:14:55.269]  And that it would explain the white flash at the Pentagon crash, which is high explosive.
[03:14:55.269 --> 03:14:56.090]  Yeah.
[03:14:56.090 --> 03:14:57.912]  And again, people say that's so confusing.
[03:14:57.912 --> 03:14:59.493]  That's how they do these ops.
[03:14:59.493 --> 03:15:03.918]  So no one knows what they saw because it's so confused on purpose.
[03:15:03.918 --> 03:15:05.380]  Yeah, I think there were two aircraft.
[03:15:05.380 --> 03:15:09.885]  There was a larger airline and there was a smaller commuter size, which other witnesses saw.
[03:15:10.686 --> 03:15:27.489]  The most important witness that I saw was the one who said that the actual airliner did not penetrate the building, and in fact it crumpled up against the wall, and he made the statement to himself, the wall held up like a champ, and then he said the airplane exploded into a thousand pieces.
[03:15:28.553 --> 03:15:40.625]  And that matches my scenario where I believe the airline size was loaded with explosives and that explains why there were just confetti-like sized pieces all around the parking lot.
[03:15:40.625 --> 03:15:43.668]  That's right, there were thousands of pieces of aluminum everywhere.
[03:15:44.289 --> 03:15:47.571]  So I think that one witness is the recording of what really happened.
[03:15:47.571 --> 03:15:58.039]  The smaller aircraft put a missile in, second aircraft hit almost simultaneously, maybe a little bit later, which most people saw, and then exploded to destroy the evidence.
[03:15:58.039 --> 03:15:58.219]  Sure.
[03:15:58.219 --> 03:16:00.441]  Joel Skalzin, what do you expect to come?
[03:16:01.261 --> 03:16:10.584]  Uh, out of all of this so far, I mean, if it hasn't gone well for them and I mean, I listen to local talk radio and they're talking like I am almost every caller's agreeing.
[03:16:10.584 --> 03:16:16.547]  I was swimming laps out of Martin Springs this weekend and a group of military guys and their wives and they were like special ops guys.
[03:16:16.547 --> 03:16:17.967]  You know, they were in great shape.
[03:16:17.967 --> 03:16:19.988]  We're talking about, and they couldn't even see me.
[03:16:19.988 --> 03:16:23.049]  You know, I was sitting there with a towel on my head and I just got there and, and,
[03:16:23.629 --> 03:16:31.136]  Yeah, I was laying out under a tree and they were all talking about Oklahoma City being an inside job and how they thought this was an inside job.
[03:16:31.136 --> 03:16:34.178]  And when I talked to them, they didn't even know who I was.
[03:16:34.178 --> 03:16:37.001]  So everywhere is the buzz that this was staged.
[03:16:38.916 --> 03:16:52.342]  Well, you know, it's interesting that the majority of information comes out later and when it continues to point towards only things that government could do is at 9-11, you know, only government could have loaded all those explosives in the World Trade Center.
[03:16:52.342 --> 03:16:54.903]  Even if you believe that only World Trade Center 7
[03:16:55.743 --> 03:17:12.973]  was loaded with explosives still you gotta explain that the terrorist could not have done that and so the more that the government covers up the more that the government silences information fails to explain things the more that alerts the more than one-third of the american people that i believe are suspicious
[03:17:13.653 --> 03:17:15.695]  About American involvement in 9-11.
[03:17:15.695 --> 03:17:21.580]  It alerts that third to the fact that we've got another false flag terrorist operation to deal with.
[03:17:21.580 --> 03:17:26.483]  Now, the government has said they're looking for an additional cell of some 12 people.
[03:17:26.483 --> 03:17:27.484]  They kind of give it away.
[03:17:27.484 --> 03:17:31.608]  There's no way you'd know that there's a cell of 12 unless maybe they were handling that cell.
[03:17:32.748 --> 03:17:40.013]  But I'm not so sure they're going to find much of a sell here.
[03:17:40.013 --> 03:17:42.575]  I think they're going to pin the blame on both of these.
[03:17:42.575 --> 03:17:52.302]  They'll have another terrorist attack under their belt, and Americans will be very much more convinced that we have a real war on terror that now includes Chechnya.
[03:17:52.302 --> 03:17:53.903]  Now I want to make one point very clear.
[03:17:53.903 --> 03:17:56.846]  The mainstream media continues to put out the propaganda.
[03:17:57.546 --> 03:18:04.689]  The yes, when they're talking about Russia assisting the FBI in this investigation, how Russia has been the victim of Chechen terrorism as well.
[03:18:04.689 --> 03:18:16.054]  This is absolutely untrue, is that almost all of the Chechen terrorism or terrorism in Russia, the apartment buildings, the Breslin bombings, of the schools... That was Putin to get re-elected!
[03:18:16.574 --> 03:18:17.995]  We're blamed on Chechens.
[03:18:17.995 --> 03:18:22.178]  We're in fact carried out by Russian speakers, not Chechens.
[03:18:22.178 --> 03:18:30.024]  The hotel bombings and the apartment bombings were all done... Well, it even came out on the Beslan shooting, which is an example of school shootings.
[03:18:30.024 --> 03:18:33.566]  The local witnesses all saw the military run out the back.
[03:18:33.566 --> 03:18:41.092]  Then they opened fire and blew the school up, killing even more kids to wipe out the two patsies they left inside.
[03:18:41.092 --> 03:18:44.054]  The theater siege is a model of false flag.
[03:18:45.143 --> 03:18:46.064]  It is indeed.
[03:18:46.064 --> 03:18:57.511]  And the Chechens and the Russians have been running the Chechens as their false flag operations, just like we've been running the Middle Eastern Muslims as our false flag operations in this country.
[03:18:57.511 --> 03:18:58.731]  Now they're kind of merging the two.
[03:18:58.731 --> 03:19:01.493]  They're making it a worldwide war on terror.
[03:19:01.493 --> 03:19:09.358]  This may have some other ramification in terms of bringing in more of this false propaganda that Russia is our ally in the world on terror.
[03:19:10.038 --> 03:19:19.943]  In the war on terror, they're still planning a disarmament treaty, another one yet again on Russia, even though they have yet to comply with the last New START treaty.
[03:19:19.943 --> 03:19:29.148]  It seems like our government is just insisting on proving to the American people, the Russians are our friends, that there's no threat there, that we're fighting a common terror enemy.
[03:19:29.148 --> 03:19:37.072]  And this downplays the real threat, which is Russia and China building weapons of mass destruction, fully intending to strike the West someday when they're ready.
[03:19:37.072 --> 03:19:37.212]  Sure.
[03:19:37.792 --> 03:19:43.577]  And I think still that we're... economic collapse is not our major issue.
[03:19:43.577 --> 03:19:46.359]  I think the powers that be can keep this going longer than we think.
[03:19:46.359 --> 03:19:57.748]  But I think it's this mother of all terrorism, a nuclear war on America that will someday be the biggest thing that will trigger not only martial law, but a new world order.
[03:19:57.748 --> 03:20:01.651]  All of the things that you've been predicting can be easily implemented.
[03:20:02.955 --> 03:20:04.736]  Under a nuclear attack scenario.
[03:20:04.736 --> 03:20:12.522]  Sure, and they're creating under it all the foundation to launch it all once they have the proper trigger.
[03:20:12.522 --> 03:20:14.704]  But I mean, this is unprecedented.
[03:20:14.704 --> 03:20:25.772]  We've had thousands of cases of lone gunmen that have shot or killed people before running around the loose and you don't shut down most of a whole city and then a surrounding another town by the city.
[03:20:25.772 --> 03:20:31.076]  And it's just outrageous the test America failed going along with this and the cops
[03:20:31.656 --> 03:20:38.825]  Having families come up with their hands up and then like grabbing women and shaking them and just, you know, like, just crazy.
[03:20:38.825 --> 03:20:41.929]  What is the mindset of these police?
[03:20:41.929 --> 03:20:45.754]  I mean, obviously the average cop does not know they're staging this stuff.
[03:20:45.754 --> 03:20:48.057]  How have they gotten the cops to behave like this?
[03:20:48.698 --> 03:20:51.579]  Well, you remember that they're training cops.
[03:20:51.579 --> 03:20:55.821]  First of all, there's a whole bunch of policemen involved in SWAT team operations.
[03:20:55.821 --> 03:20:58.363]  We're trained to have this militaristic response to everything.
[03:20:58.363 --> 03:20:59.763]  They use them regularly.
[03:20:59.763 --> 03:21:05.166]  A lot of the police around them are watching and looking and admiring, wondering when I can be a SWAT.
[03:21:05.166 --> 03:21:11.829]  And so there's this mindset within police now that we want to emulate what the top brand police are doing as a SWAT team.
[03:21:12.709 --> 03:21:21.756]  And when you had this kind of pseudo-patriotism involved with this Boston Marathon bomb, everybody got hyped up into acting this way.
[03:21:21.756 --> 03:21:23.257]  And we saw it play out.
[03:21:23.257 --> 03:21:36.966]  And so I'm really worried, Alex, that we've got a growing atmosphere which allows a thuggish mentality to come out of policemen and feel like it's justified when you have one of these super patriotic
[03:21:39.008 --> 03:21:39.768]  You know what I mean?
[03:21:59.281 --> 03:22:05.544]  is that there's not going to be this kind of stated martial law without a major excuse.
[03:22:05.544 --> 03:22:09.706]  It proves that with the proper excuse they don't even need to call martial law.
[03:22:09.706 --> 03:22:12.227]  People just lay down and give up their rights.
[03:22:12.227 --> 03:22:13.828]  Well, I've always said they're not going to call it martial law.
[03:22:13.828 --> 03:22:16.649]  They're going to call it civil emergency public safety.
[03:22:16.649 --> 03:22:22.272]  You know, when police come to your house and want to look at your guns and knock and talk, they go, it's just public safety.
[03:22:23.215 --> 03:22:26.979]  And you know, I think about what this country's turned into.
[03:22:26.979 --> 03:22:31.803]  Why do the powers that be want this power grid in place right now, this control grid?
[03:22:31.803 --> 03:22:37.848]  And it's because they are just going to incrementally dismantle this country and they're trying to make gun owners the enemy.
[03:22:37.848 --> 03:22:40.230]  They're trying to put their cyber security system in place.
[03:22:40.931 --> 03:22:45.195]  And of course they have that poll out saying 30% think 9-11 is an inside job or whatever.
[03:22:45.195 --> 03:22:51.581]  I think that was a push poll done to make it look stupid because it was next to do you believe reptiles drink people's blood?
[03:22:51.581 --> 03:22:54.023]  Do you believe this and that?
[03:22:54.023 --> 03:22:55.365]  When you talk to people privately,
[03:22:56.792 --> 03:23:04.314]  More than half the people I run into, and I've seen some polls showing over half, believe that they're being lied to about 9-11.
[03:23:04.314 --> 03:23:08.715]  Most polls are around 90% believe JFK was killed in a conspiracy.
[03:23:08.715 --> 03:23:15.477]  So I really think this whole police state response is a failing forward.
[03:23:15.477 --> 03:23:22.359]  An attempt to try to overcompensate because the criminal class, the kleptocratic class, knows there's an awakening to them.
[03:23:24.332 --> 03:23:42.942]  There really is, and that's why, as we've talked about on your previous shows, there is this concept that we need to always be aware of, of them baiting people on the right as well, to try to gain as much of a livid expression against government so that they can turn around and use that to justify coming after us.
[03:23:42.942 --> 03:23:51.107]  But still, I think it takes something, a major terrorist event like this, or false flag terrorist event like this, to justify
[03:23:51.727 --> 03:23:52.847]  What they want to do.
[03:23:52.847 --> 03:23:56.728]  I don't think they can pull that off without something like this.
[03:23:56.728 --> 03:24:11.531]  And again, they've now bound patriotism to getting rid of the Fourth Amendment and having an orgy of police running around in paramilitary gear, planting the flag of unconstitutional behavior on Boston.
[03:24:11.531 --> 03:24:17.033]  And then, oh, the FCC says you're allowed to cuss on TV if it's about Boston now.
[03:24:17.033 --> 03:24:18.313]  I mean, it is just so
[03:24:18.973 --> 03:24:23.335]  It's comically obvious what they're rolling out.
[03:24:23.335 --> 03:24:27.317]  You were on just like two weeks ago, I think, and I said, I think a false flag's imminent.
[03:24:27.317 --> 03:24:28.337]  You agreed.
[03:24:28.337 --> 03:24:38.122]  Because every cop show, every drama, every family guy, you name it, says the Tea Party will join Al-Qaeda and bomb America.
[03:24:38.122 --> 03:24:39.623]  I mean, every show.
[03:24:39.623 --> 03:24:40.123]  Every show.
[03:24:41.063 --> 03:24:44.624]  Uh, that's a drama or a cop show, uh, does this.
[03:24:44.624 --> 03:24:49.605]  You know, even shows about remaking houses somehow injected into it, because those aren't really real, folks.
[03:24:49.605 --> 03:24:50.585]  Those are scripted as well.
[03:24:50.585 --> 03:24:55.767]  They're quasi-fiction, uh, quasi, uh, non-fiction reality.
[03:24:55.767 --> 03:25:01.368]  So it's the bathing in this, and sure, it's over the top now to say the Founding Fathers are scum and...
[03:25:02.168 --> 03:25:08.149]  Veterans are evil, but when they're done with a bunch of bombings blaming it on us It will merge in the mind, but I agree with you.
[03:25:08.149 --> 03:25:26.793]  It looks like a five-year plan or something I think we may be a little bit closer than you think but I want people to understand this is life and death That's why I work so hard and broadcast you know 18 hours a day some days last week with two hours sleep Because you know the audience was there we had to talk to them is that this is so real I mean you're not
[03:25:27.153 --> 03:25:30.435]  You know, people ask me, Alex, are you serious about what you're saying?
[03:25:30.435 --> 03:25:31.376]  Look at history, folks.
[03:25:31.376 --> 03:25:32.096]  It's happening.
[03:25:32.096 --> 03:25:33.257]  Yes, I'm serious.
[03:25:33.257 --> 03:25:38.100]  Joel, talk to the enforcers, the cops, but then also people that might be patsies later.
[03:25:38.100 --> 03:25:40.281]  Talking directly to the enforcers out there.
[03:25:40.281 --> 03:25:44.844]  I know we think they have low IQs and stuff because they're chosen for that, but not all of them.
[03:25:44.844 --> 03:25:48.226]  Talk to them about the choice they have to make and what they can do.
[03:25:48.226 --> 03:25:51.568]  I think it's important to actually address the minions of this.
[03:25:53.490 --> 03:26:00.635]  Well, my first call would be to people who are not really enforcers, but people who are playing along with these.
[03:26:00.635 --> 03:26:11.943]  For example, there's probably 50 to 75 explosives demolition experts that helped load the World Trade Center the weekend before and previous to that.
[03:26:11.943 --> 03:26:14.165]  When they had the drill to shut it down, yeah.
[03:26:14.165 --> 03:26:14.645]  That's right.
[03:26:14.645 --> 03:26:18.908]  There are hundreds of these people who are potential whistleblowers.
[03:26:18.908 --> 03:26:21.210]  We need some of those people to come out and have the courage.
[03:26:21.210 --> 03:26:22.411]  I know that you've been threatened.
[03:26:22.872 --> 03:26:30.727]  To say you know what's going to happen to your family, but you can see that this nation is on the brink of actually being controlled by
[03:26:31.471 --> 03:26:56.312]  a major black operation and it's uh... it's much bigger than the two political parties it's it's above our governmental level and uh... for the sake of whatever patriotism that uh... you know you've grown up with uh... you've got to come forward and talk about these things i know there's a tremendous pressure alex against these people to do so and but you know uh... we've had some like the shooters on the grass and grassy know we have two of them
[03:26:57.032 --> 03:27:06.962]  Deathbed-type confessions, who were both in prison, said they worked for the mafia and the CIA, both interchangeably, on special operations like this.
[03:27:06.962 --> 03:27:10.386]  They did shoot the president from the grassy knoll.
[03:27:10.386 --> 03:27:12.147]  Did we hear anything from the media?
[03:27:12.147 --> 03:27:13.048]  That's the problem.
[03:27:13.048 --> 03:27:20.536]  E. Howard Hunt even went public, and even though he lost a lawsuit that claimed it by spotlight, and confirmed he was a benchwarmer on the whole deal.
[03:27:21.667 --> 03:27:27.170]  But with the kind of audience that you've got, Alex, the millions that listen to you, you're a force to be reckoned with.
[03:27:27.170 --> 03:27:31.813]  There is a way for whistleblowers to get this information out.
[03:27:31.813 --> 03:27:39.138]  For example, the aunt of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was threatened by the FBI that you will not talk to the media.
[03:27:39.938 --> 03:27:55.087]  And so when this reporter from Canada got to her and she told about the fact that the guy that they paraded around as naked was in fact Tamerlan, that he was in fact alive and well and in a police car, that's being suppressed.
[03:27:55.087 --> 03:27:56.028]  It's very important.
[03:27:56.348 --> 03:27:58.449]  Why would the FBI tell them to shut up?
[03:27:58.449 --> 03:28:00.109]  I mean, that's very guilty behavior.
[03:28:00.109 --> 03:28:10.193]  By the way, anybody who wants to get a hold of us, the Tamerlans, or the family of Tamerlan, you want to get a hold of us, tipsandinfowars.com, showtipsandinfowars.com.
[03:28:10.193 --> 03:28:11.113]  Go ahead and finish up, I'm sorry.
[03:28:11.613 --> 03:28:15.357]  There will be more coming out of that lady, I'll tell you, and from the parents.
[03:28:15.357 --> 03:28:17.079]  They're going to have trouble shutting this up.
[03:28:17.079 --> 03:28:18.060]  They're going to try.
[03:28:18.060 --> 03:28:20.742]  But believe me, these people are mad at the U.S.
[03:28:20.742 --> 03:28:23.305]  government, and they're going to tell more about the truth.
[03:28:23.305 --> 03:28:25.287]  And I think there's a lot more to find.
[03:28:25.287 --> 03:28:28.070]  We're going to be able to cover this story probably for the next six months.
[03:28:29.022 --> 03:28:40.894]  You know, I know you're putting together a big World Affairs Brief for Friday, but you're going to give us a boil down because I have to go to press in the next few days on the magazine, the next month's issue that's going to have a whole breakdown of false flags.
[03:28:42.062 --> 03:28:50.690]  I just want to let people know if they want to get a copy of that special synopsis of this briefing, they can email me at editor at worldaffairsbrief.com
[03:29:07.165 --> 03:29:08.887]  Alex, I want to applaud what you're doing.
[03:29:08.887 --> 03:29:18.958]  I know you're taking a lot of flack for what's going on, but that means you're effective with the O'Reillys, who are perennial conspiracy deniers, or even Glenn Beck, who's, you know...
[03:29:20.207 --> 03:29:25.448]  A good guy considers himself a patriot but he's a conspiracy denier and it's a real problem.
[03:29:25.448 --> 03:29:27.128]  You're at the forefront of this.
[03:29:27.128 --> 03:29:29.529]  I'm at the forefront of this.
[03:29:29.529 --> 03:29:30.609]  It's got to be said.
[03:29:30.609 --> 03:29:33.469]  It's not changing political parties.
[03:29:33.469 --> 03:29:37.770]  It's not electing Republicans or even getting rid of Obama that will solve this situation.
[03:29:37.770 --> 03:29:44.071]  It is exposing the fact that we have a secret combination of power that controls all the levels of power.
[03:29:44.071 --> 03:29:47.192]  At least they have effective control and we've got to kill that.
[03:29:47.192 --> 03:29:48.512]  We've got to fight against it.
[03:29:48.712 --> 03:29:52.494]  That's right, they're not in full control yet, and Katie, bar the door if they get it.
[03:29:52.494 --> 03:29:53.735]  We're in a real struggle.
[03:29:53.735 --> 03:29:55.016]  Thank you so much, Joel Skousen.
[03:29:55.016 --> 03:29:57.218]  Other reporters are coming in to take your phone calls.
[03:29:57.218 --> 03:29:58.378]  Straight ahead.
[03:29:58.378 --> 03:29:59.759]  We're on the march.
[03:29:59.759 --> 03:30:02.301]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.301 --> 03:30:04.963]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.315 --> 03:30:10.736]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:10.736 --> 03:30:21.402]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:30:21.402 --> 03:30:24.064]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight
[03:30:24.284 --> 03:30:24.724]  I don't know.
[03:30:39.870 --> 03:30:43.372]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:30:43.372 --> 03:30:49.516]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:30:49.516 --> 03:30:59.402]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:30:59.402 --> 03:31:00.903]  The war is here.
[03:31:00.903 --> 03:31:02.804]  It's an info war.
[03:31:02.804 --> 03:31:05.626]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:31:09.201 --> 03:31:13.667]  The It's Not My Fault My Computer Is Running Slow support group will come to order.
[03:31:13.667 --> 03:31:14.227]  Ready?
[03:31:14.227 --> 03:31:15.369]  It's not my fault.
[03:31:15.369 --> 03:31:16.590]  It's not my fault.
[03:31:16.590 --> 03:31:17.731]  It's not my fault.
[03:31:17.731 --> 03:31:18.392]  Excuse me?
[03:31:18.392 --> 03:31:19.413]  Yes, Barry?
[03:31:19.413 --> 03:31:22.437]  Isn't it somebody's fault when your computer slows down?
[03:31:22.437 --> 03:31:24.039]  I think it's Barry's fault.
[03:31:24.039 --> 03:31:26.202]  Thanks, Barry, for slowing down my computer.
[03:31:26.502 --> 03:31:29.424]  If your computer is running slow, it's not always your fault.

[03:32:15.675 --> 03:32:18.657]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?

[03:32:35.623 --> 03:32:36.043]  I think.
[03:32:36.043 --> 03:32:36.704]  I think.
[03:32:36.704 --> 03:32:37.144]  I think.
[03:32:37.144 --> 03:32:37.365]  I think.
[03:33:03.387 --> 03:33:05.313]  Free shipping on every order over $50.
[03:33:05.313 --> 03:33:07.842]  Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[03:33:28.510 --> 03:33:38.112]  Alright, I'm David Knight and I'm joined in the studio here with Jakari Jackson and we're giving Alex Jones a little bit of a break and we're going to take some of your calls and a lot of people have been waiting for a very long time.
[03:33:39.112 --> 03:33:40.492]  Jakari, how you doing?
[03:33:40.492 --> 03:33:41.973]  Any thoughts?
[03:33:41.973 --> 03:33:42.993]  Oh, I'm doing fine.
[03:33:42.993 --> 03:33:45.854]  My thoughts and prayers are still with the people of Boston.
[03:33:45.854 --> 03:33:53.616]  Not just, you know, for the bombing, but for the traumatic incident of, you know, having the SWAT teams come and throw you out of your own home.
[03:33:53.616 --> 03:33:53.996]  Absolutely.
[03:33:53.996 --> 03:33:56.017]  You had to shut down the city to catch one kid.
[03:33:56.017 --> 03:34:04.359]  I mean, how many drug dealers and car thieves, violent car thieves are out there every day doing that thing, but you had to shut down the city to catch one guy.
[03:34:04.739 --> 03:34:05.259]  Absolutely.
[03:34:05.259 --> 03:34:06.020]  That's just amazing.
[03:34:06.020 --> 03:34:07.000]  I've never seen anything like it.
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:09.182]  I don't think anybody's seen anything like that before in America.
[03:34:09.182 --> 03:34:13.844]  But unfortunately, it looks like they're going to use that as a template.
[03:34:13.844 --> 03:34:15.245]  And they're going to do that more and more.
[03:34:15.245 --> 03:34:17.066]  We're going to see that unless we stop it.
[03:34:17.066 --> 03:34:18.907]  You know, people just have to stand up and stop it.
[03:34:18.907 --> 03:34:23.830]  You know, we're talking about CISPA, that there's a campaign today.
[03:34:23.830 --> 03:34:29.633]  Anonymous, other people on Twitter are trying to raise awareness of this because it is very close to passing.
[03:34:29.633 --> 03:34:33.275]  And it is what the late Aaron Schwartz called the Patriot Act of the Internet.
[03:34:33.975 --> 03:34:36.297]  And he was really kind of a Paul Revere.
[03:34:36.297 --> 03:34:38.938]  He didn't want to take credit for this, but he woke a lot of people up.
[03:34:38.938 --> 03:34:45.001]  But he was right in the sense that it wasn't anything that one person could do, but he could get people upset about it.
[03:34:45.001 --> 03:34:53.606]  And they just, they hit Congress with so many, so much information, so many protests that Congress basically backed off.
[03:34:53.606 --> 03:34:58.149]  You know, if the public is like a sleeping giant, and if they stay asleep,
[03:34:58.911 --> 03:35:02.794]  The government's going to come by and they're going to slowly amputate, you know, it's like diabetes or something.
[03:35:02.794 --> 03:35:08.177]  You're going to lose a finger, you're going to lose an arm, you're going to lose a leg until you can't do anything anymore, until you're dead.
[03:35:08.177 --> 03:35:10.318]  But if we wake up, then back off.
[03:35:10.318 --> 03:35:11.419]  We've seen that over and over again.
[03:35:11.419 --> 03:35:12.500]  We saw it with the Second Amendment.
[03:35:12.500 --> 03:35:14.041]  And we've got to get people who are fired up.
[03:35:14.601 --> 03:35:19.845]  On the Second Amendment issue, just as fired up on this Patriot Act for the Internet, CISPA.
[03:35:19.845 --> 03:35:20.425]  That's going to be stopped.
[03:35:20.425 --> 03:35:22.666]  And you saw it with guys like Dan Badangi.
[03:35:22.666 --> 03:35:28.530]  I mean, just one guy shut down three press conferences because he dared to desire the truth.
[03:35:28.530 --> 03:35:28.930]  Absolutely.
[03:35:28.930 --> 03:35:36.235]  We had more people like that at Congress, at Senate, at the City Council meetings, at the whatever, who will go out there and just make their voices known.
[03:35:36.235 --> 03:35:38.877]  Because don't assume somebody's going to do this for you.
[03:35:38.877 --> 03:35:43.280]  Don't assume that your neighbor is going to write your congressman or email your senator.
[03:35:44.040 --> 03:35:45.602]  Make sure that you do these things yourself.
[03:35:45.602 --> 03:35:52.611]  Like I gave the example how I called Chuckie Schumer's office when he compared private gun sellers to child pornographers.
[03:35:52.611 --> 03:35:53.852]  I called Chuckie Schumer's office.
[03:35:53.852 --> 03:35:54.593]  I didn't get to talk to him.
[03:35:54.593 --> 03:35:55.594]  I had to talk to his intern.
[03:35:55.594 --> 03:35:59.439]  But I made my voice known and that's the same thing people have to do on these other issues like CISPA.
[03:35:59.799 --> 03:36:00.539]  Absolutely.
[03:36:00.539 --> 03:36:02.780]  And you know it wasn't just shutting down those press conferences.
[03:36:02.780 --> 03:36:06.761]  What Dan did was he made the term false flag part of the national dialogue on this.
[03:36:06.761 --> 03:36:12.822]  And that's real important because people have to see these things in the context of what's happened before.
[03:36:12.822 --> 03:36:19.604]  And if you go back and look on the internet at the comments that Aaron Schwartz made when he was talking to people about these internet
[03:36:20.464 --> 03:36:22.906]  attack these attacks on internet privacy.
[03:36:22.906 --> 03:36:28.690]  It was a real awakening for him to see the attitude and the power trips of these congressmen.
[03:36:28.690 --> 03:36:30.571]  But let's go to some of these calls that we've got right now.
[03:36:30.571 --> 03:36:34.474]  I think the first one that we got up is is that Dave in Arizona?
[03:36:34.474 --> 03:36:37.556]  Is that the first one we've got?
[03:36:37.556 --> 03:36:40.398]  Dave are you there?
[03:36:40.398 --> 03:36:42.939]  Hello Dave?
[03:36:42.939 --> 03:36:43.620]  Dave in Arizona.
[03:36:45.589 --> 03:36:48.630]  Okay, let's go to another one right here.
[03:36:48.630 --> 03:36:50.611]  We've got DC in West Virginia.
[03:36:50.611 --> 03:36:53.292]  Hey, what's going on, guys?
[03:36:53.292 --> 03:36:54.652]  Hey.
[03:36:54.652 --> 03:37:00.974]  Man, this is huge, especially for somebody that's awake now, that wasn't awake for 9-11.
[03:37:00.974 --> 03:37:07.776]  It's just a whole other level, seeing everything that's going on, being awake, as 9-11 happening and then waking up.
[03:37:07.776 --> 03:37:08.977]  You know what I mean?
[03:37:08.977 --> 03:37:12.758]  I think a big thing that's being missed, not by you all, but like,
[03:37:13.231 --> 03:37:15.516]  Other people is the NDAA.
[03:37:15.516 --> 03:37:23.034]  I feel like one of the big agendas of this false flag is to kind of legitimize NDAA, kind of the way 9-11 did the Patriot Act.
[03:37:23.843 --> 03:37:32.248]  Absolutely, and you saw the supporters, the big supporters of NDAA, Lindsey Graham out there saying that we've got to give this guy the full Gitmo treatment, call him an enemy combatant.
[03:37:32.248 --> 03:37:34.730]  Yeah, you don't get a lawyer, you're an enemy combatant.
[03:37:34.730 --> 03:37:46.997]  That's the thing that really bothered me with the way this thing has been handled since the guy's apprehension, is all you see on your big mainstream networks is, we don't have time to give this guy his Miranda rights, we don't need warrants to arrest anybody.
[03:37:47.577 --> 03:37:49.660]  You don't even have to show you this guy placing the bomb.
[03:37:49.660 --> 03:37:57.429]  I mean, you can see these guys walking around, you know, just, you know, fair and easy all day, but you can't see these guys ever placing any charges down.
[03:37:57.429 --> 03:38:02.996]  Now, Carney did have a press conference today and he did say that he's going to, that they are not, that they are going to give them
[03:38:03.756 --> 03:38:05.497]  Uh, regular judicial process.
[03:38:05.497 --> 03:38:06.677]  That remains to be seen.
[03:38:06.677 --> 03:38:11.098]  I guess the real question is the apprehension of these two suspects.
[03:38:11.098 --> 03:38:21.301]  Uh, the fact that the aunt is saying that, uh, this one guy was, uh, the older brother was in fact the video that we have of the naked suspect being taken.
[03:38:21.301 --> 03:38:22.982]  And then the next thing you see, he's dead.
[03:38:23.482 --> 03:38:30.607]  And then we see that the younger brother is hiding in the boat, and the boat is just riddled with bullets like Bonnie and Clyde.
[03:38:30.607 --> 03:38:31.108]  Right.
[03:38:31.108 --> 03:38:34.490]  And then he appears to be led away, walking, fine.
[03:38:34.490 --> 03:38:37.332]  And then the next thing we know, he's nearly dead.
[03:38:37.332 --> 03:38:38.633]  Bleeding from the throat.
[03:38:38.633 --> 03:38:39.293]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:38:39.293 --> 03:38:41.875]  So there's some real questions about that.
[03:38:41.875 --> 03:38:47.479]  And as Alex mentioned, there was chatter on the police radio saying that, oh no, the press is here.
[03:38:47.479 --> 03:38:49.601]  In other words, they did not want anybody covering these.
[03:38:49.601 --> 03:38:51.222]  But anything else you wanted to add?
[03:38:52.073 --> 03:39:04.824]  Yeah, speaking of that boat incident, I mean, for one, I couldn't write something better than this, this is crazy, but I don't know if you guys have seen the internet pictures right now that show him kind of crawling out of the boat when they apprehended him?
[03:39:04.824 --> 03:39:05.565]  Mm-hmm.
[03:39:05.565 --> 03:39:13.812]  I mean, I'm curious as well if we can get somebody to try to see if that's what's in there, because, I mean, that's just, how are you going to crawl out of the boat after they've literally hit bullets for one?
[03:39:13.812 --> 03:39:19.817]  And for two, have you guys noticed how, when it first happened, they kept asking, the media would ask about whether or not he had a gun.
[03:39:27.153 --> 03:39:39.140]  Well, if you remember, sir, the big lie, well I won't say the lie, but the thing they were trying to push is the fact that he was probably armed, likely armed, with a explosive vest, a suicide vest, is the thing they kept trying to push.
[03:39:39.140 --> 03:39:40.661]  So, we have to take this guy out.
[03:39:40.661 --> 03:39:41.662]  We can't take any chances.
[03:39:41.662 --> 03:39:45.905]  We don't need any warrants because he may be strapped with a suicide vest.
[03:39:45.905 --> 03:39:47.866]  Well, and as Joel Skousen pointed out,
[03:39:48.951 --> 03:39:52.492]  When we listen to the tapes, you hear a tremendous amount of gunfire.
[03:39:52.492 --> 03:39:55.213]  And I've listened to the tapes that neighbors made.
[03:39:55.213 --> 03:39:58.034]  I didn't see or hear any explosions.
[03:39:58.034 --> 03:40:05.756]  So the tapes really don't corroborate what the FBI is saying at this point as far as there being explosions and bombs being thrown.
[03:40:05.756 --> 03:40:06.996]  Well, thanks for talking to us.
[03:40:06.996 --> 03:40:09.317]  We've got Michael in Tennessee coming up next.
[03:40:09.317 --> 03:40:09.817]  Michael, are you there?
[03:40:12.679 --> 03:40:13.300]  Hello, Michael.
[03:40:13.300 --> 03:40:14.340]  Hello.
[03:40:14.340 --> 03:40:14.901]  Can you hear us?
[03:40:14.901 --> 03:40:15.842]  How are you today?
[03:40:15.842 --> 03:40:16.322]  Doing fine.
[03:40:16.322 --> 03:40:18.404]  What you got?
[03:40:18.404 --> 03:40:24.669]  I'm a Planet Prison, excuse me, Prison Planet member calling from FEMA Region 4.
[03:40:24.669 --> 03:40:28.852]  I've got y'all's free bumper stickers and passing them out like water.
[03:40:28.852 --> 03:40:29.653]  Thank you, sir.
[03:40:29.653 --> 03:40:31.274]  I use your Procure, all that stuff.
[03:40:31.274 --> 03:40:31.975]  Thank you.
[03:40:31.975 --> 03:40:34.136]  Anyway, I called Alex about a month ago.
[03:40:34.136 --> 03:40:39.281]  I'm the Constitution Bill of Rights new sticker idea guy.
[03:40:39.281 --> 03:40:41.963]  I think y'all should run the Bill of Rights as a new sticker.
[03:40:42.643 --> 03:40:45.204]  Uh, at the bottom of your screen.
[03:40:45.204 --> 03:40:47.925]  Uh, but I wanted to point out something about the Constitution.
[03:40:47.925 --> 03:40:49.546]  Everybody's trying to mess with it.
[03:40:49.546 --> 03:40:58.409]  And I'm going to tell you, the Bill of Rights itself says in the first four articles, the first letter of all of the first four articles spells out the words can't.
[03:40:58.409 --> 03:41:01.130]  I think it can't be any plainer than that.
[03:41:01.690 --> 03:41:16.041]  I'd also like to point out that the milestones to our road to freedom should include wonderful things like Badandi's awesome non-mainstream questioning and also Alex's Pierce Morgan takeover show.
[03:41:16.041 --> 03:41:23.426]  I'm going to say I think it's unusual that the Twin Towers, and originally we were calling this the Twin Bombings,
[03:41:24.292 --> 03:41:36.597]  And I'd just like to know if you think there were any videos that showed dogs, those mom-sniffing dogs, that were actually alerted and then kind of asked to turn down.
[03:41:36.597 --> 03:41:44.620]  And there are people all the time, I'm saying a lot of stuff here, but I want to get it out and then you can comment, but people say all the time, what can I do?
[03:41:44.620 --> 03:41:49.982]  Well, I, in about the last two months, have become extremely proactive and I've called on my phone
[03:41:51.663 --> 03:42:00.689]  93 calls to senators and state representatives against unlawful gun controls and for teachers to be trained, which by the way in Tennessee passed.
[03:42:00.689 --> 03:42:09.235]  And are there any websites that show any information about Dr. Votenik's reporting on the Obama-Bush-Clinton indictments?
[03:42:09.235 --> 03:42:11.336]  And now I'll leave it to you, and that's all I wanted to ask.
[03:42:11.664 --> 03:42:21.815]  It was pulled down, it's addressing the Pachinic question that was pulled down, but I do believe it is on Planet Info Wars, and you can probably just type in the search.
[03:42:21.815 --> 03:42:31.725]  And I don't remember the name of the website, but they did have a one hour video there, a press conference, and you can look at the full 600 page report, that organization, and I don't have that.
[03:42:32.458 --> 03:42:33.599]  Right with me right now.
[03:42:33.599 --> 03:42:35.320]  Maybe we get that later.
[03:42:35.320 --> 03:42:42.785]  But I tell you what, Michael, I really appreciate your activism and your support of us, but your activism with Congress and one thing to put on your list.
[03:42:42.785 --> 03:42:46.527]  You've been very active calling people call about CISPA.
[03:42:46.527 --> 03:42:50.209]  That is something there's a lot more Republican support for it than there is Democrat support.
[03:42:50.209 --> 03:42:52.451]  So we still have a chance at defeating it in the Senate.
[03:42:52.731 --> 03:42:53.392]  Right.
[03:42:53.392 --> 03:43:07.843]  And we've got to remember that SOPA and PIPA and even CISPA itself in its previous incarnation that wasn't as bad as it is right now, those were all defeated even though all of the people on the House committee were co-sponsors of it.
[03:43:07.843 --> 03:43:11.946]  It was pretty much a done deal when Aaron Schwartz started fighting it and they brought that thing back.
[03:43:11.946 --> 03:43:16.810]  They delayed it and they brought it, you know, kept publicizing it and resisting it until they stopped it.
[03:43:17.410 --> 03:43:21.173]  So, it can be stopped, but we have to get active, just like you've been active.
[03:43:21.173 --> 03:43:32.602]  And in terms of the number of videos and things that are going to show any bomb-sniffing dogs at the finish line, I think we're going to see a lot of stuff continue to surface over the next months and years.
[03:43:32.602 --> 03:43:41.529]  You've got to remember that we just talked to Mike McNulty, who did the Waco Rules of Engagement and then Waco, a New Revelation documentary.
[03:43:43.710 --> 03:43:47.872]  It took a long time for the information about exactly what happened at Waco.
[03:43:47.872 --> 03:43:58.797]  People knew that the official story was contrived, false, contradictory, but it took a very long time to find the exact information and it took him a while to discover it.
[03:43:58.797 --> 03:44:04.679]  And he actually was successful with Freedom of Information Act to uncover some information that the government had never had out there before.
[03:44:04.679 --> 03:44:07.121]  So, I think eventually the truth is going to come out.
[03:44:07.121 --> 03:44:10.182]  We know though from the get-go that there's a lot of suspicious stuff here.
[03:44:10.342 --> 03:44:16.023]  And keep in mind, a lot of people have their cameras and such confiscated by the authorities when it happened.
[03:44:16.023 --> 03:44:17.203]  They even admitted that on CNN.
[03:44:17.203 --> 03:44:19.944]  We have to take these cameras because there may be information on them.
[03:44:19.944 --> 03:44:30.326]  So that will make it somewhat more difficult, but I am confident there are people who have, even if it's just in the background, they have the bomb-sniffing dogs or whatever else going on.
[03:44:30.326 --> 03:44:31.386]  Absolutely.
[03:44:31.386 --> 03:44:33.067]  We've got Terry in Washington next.
[03:44:33.067 --> 03:44:33.647]  Terry, are you there?
[03:44:34.953 --> 03:44:35.433]  I'm here!
[03:44:35.433 --> 03:44:37.054]  Hey, how you guys doing?
[03:44:37.054 --> 03:44:38.535]  Doing fine, how are you?
[03:44:38.535 --> 03:44:39.195]  What you got?
[03:44:39.195 --> 03:44:39.736]  Good.
[03:44:39.736 --> 03:44:43.238]  Hey, I hope Alex is still in the building because I want him to hear this.
[03:44:43.238 --> 03:44:56.345]  I tell you what, it sucks that for anybody that doesn't belong to PrisonPlanet.tv because I watched this unfold the day that Alex had Richard Belzer on the show.
[03:44:56.345 --> 03:44:58.266]  That's right.
[03:44:58.266 --> 03:45:01.088]  And the first thing that came to my mind
[03:45:02.651 --> 03:45:11.155]  I've never seen a marathon where they didn't have a camera up high watching the runners come in.
[03:45:11.155 --> 03:45:12.596]  That's a very good point.
[03:45:12.596 --> 03:45:18.339]  That camera was covered up because it was in the spot where the bomb was to go off.
[03:45:18.339 --> 03:45:20.700]  And they knew that ahead of time.
[03:45:23.408 --> 03:45:28.510]  Also, I want to see the dash cam of these guys throwing bombs out the window.
[03:45:28.510 --> 03:45:29.891]  Yes, this is exactly what I said.
[03:45:29.891 --> 03:45:32.652]  I want to see the dash cam of the bombs being thrown out.
[03:45:32.652 --> 03:45:36.874]  I want to see the dash cam of the younger brother running over the other brother.
[03:45:36.874 --> 03:45:39.095]  I mean, they should have all this stuff on tape somewhere.
[03:45:39.095 --> 03:45:46.779]  Well, even going back further than that, you remember when they finally did get around to their press conference that they delayed and then delayed again as we're releasing photographs.
[03:45:47.677 --> 03:45:55.943]  They were telling people, don't look at any of the other photographs, but in their own, what they were telling us to look at, it really wasn't very credible.
[03:45:55.943 --> 03:46:05.651]  I mean, he had the wrong color backpack, the younger brother has a very casual attitude as he's walking along, and it just didn't make any sense, you know, when they had it.
[03:46:05.651 --> 03:46:11.756]  And at the press conference, you had a reporter ask the FBI representative,
[03:46:12.665 --> 03:46:15.328]  What time it was put down, and he was kind of vague on that.
[03:46:15.328 --> 03:46:18.491]  Well, it was sometime around, you know, close to when the explosion happened.
[03:46:18.491 --> 03:46:20.994]  Do you have a picture of the bag being put down?
[03:46:20.994 --> 03:46:21.514]  No.
[03:46:21.514 --> 03:46:21.995]  No.
[03:46:21.995 --> 03:46:24.077]  They didn't have, you know, or they weren't releasing it.
[03:46:24.077 --> 03:46:26.440]  So why haven't we seen a picture of the bag being put down?
[03:46:26.440 --> 03:46:33.707]  I mean, they keep showing this picture of the two brothers walking around the corner of a building and a couple of feet down a sidewalk, and that's it.
[03:46:34.568 --> 03:46:39.931]  And yet we're supposed to take it with the wrong color bag, and yet that's conclusive evidence that these guys did the bombing.
[03:46:39.931 --> 03:46:43.213]  And the press is reporting this as the guys who did the bombing.
[03:46:43.213 --> 03:46:45.355]  They're not even using the word alleged.
[03:46:45.355 --> 03:46:55.941]  Yeah, and as far as the evidence, let's find out who this naked man was, because there is speculation the aunt, I believe, has identified the naked man as one of her relatives.
[03:46:55.941 --> 03:46:57.062]  Yes, as the older brother.
[03:46:57.062 --> 03:46:58.623]  But nobody's talking about that anymore.
[03:46:58.623 --> 03:47:03.426]  It came out on, I believe it was CNN a few days ago, and it hasn't been talked about since as far as I know.
[03:47:03.686 --> 03:47:04.127]  That's right.
[03:47:04.127 --> 03:47:06.170]  Mike, did you have anything else?
[03:47:06.170 --> 03:47:10.338]  It's just like I was watching CNN this morning waiting for Alex to come on.
[03:47:10.338 --> 03:47:16.609]  And, you know, they were interviewing these guys, and everybody that they interviewed kept passing the buck.
[03:47:18.598 --> 03:47:27.667]  You know that wasn't my department and you know that was a different district and they had a long rifle and of course they had to bring the long rifle into the scene.
[03:47:27.667 --> 03:47:35.815]  There's a long rifle in the car you know it's just it's just so full of holes that this thing isn't going to float.
[03:47:35.815 --> 03:47:37.497]  The fact it's going to float about as good as that
[03:47:38.542 --> 03:47:44.389]  Absolutely, but you see that they've got their agenda coming out already.
[03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:55.002]  Last Thursday, when the House had the CISPA Act, you had the chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security saying, well, we had real bombs now, but the digital bombs are coming, so we've got to pass CISPA.
[03:47:55.522 --> 03:48:05.509]  Then you've got the guy who was a co-sponsor of CISPA coming on and talking yesterday about all these dangers and everything, how this has got to be put in.
[03:48:05.509 --> 03:48:06.289]  So they've got an agenda.
[03:48:06.289 --> 03:48:09.572]  They even tried to tie this into other firearms.
[03:48:09.572 --> 03:48:16.216]  You know, say these guys didn't have the proper licenses for their handguns, so therefore we've got to have, you know, more licenses.
[03:48:16.216 --> 03:48:18.998]  I guess we're going to have pressure cookers banned next.
[03:48:19.198 --> 03:48:19.518]  Yes.
[03:48:19.518 --> 03:48:19.698]  Yes.
[03:48:50.922 --> 03:49:06.826]  We are being able to bear arms for the reason that if in case one day the government gets too big and too controlling and tyrannical that we are obligated as our U.S.
[03:49:06.826 --> 03:49:12.968]  citizen right to form a militia to fight back to regain
[03:49:14.622 --> 03:49:23.252]  Well, the Declaration of Independence, you know, they always have you memorize in school the part that these rights are inalienable rights, okay?
[03:49:24.105 --> 03:49:37.049]  But they don't have you memorize the second half of that first paragraph, which says that when a government is destructive of these rights, it is the right and the duty of the people to alter or abolish that government.
[03:49:37.049 --> 03:49:39.770]  They don't want you to memorize that part of it.
[03:49:39.770 --> 03:49:44.331]  But when you talk about the Constitution, really the militia and the Second Amendment comes in in two places.
[03:49:44.331 --> 03:49:47.532]  It's not just the Second Amendment, but it was also in Article I, Section 8.
[03:49:48.292 --> 03:49:55.954]  And what it said there was that the federal government would not organize an army and fund it for more than two years at a time.
[03:49:55.954 --> 03:50:01.915]  They were allowed to organize and fund permanently a navy to protect our borders and protect us from invasion.
[03:50:01.915 --> 03:50:12.018]  But they understood that a standing army, and if you look at the Federalist Papers and the debates on the Constitution, you'll see that they understood that a standing army would eventually be used as an instrument of oppression.
[03:50:12.578 --> 03:50:24.723]  They had already experienced that from the British and they knew that would happen again and so they did not want a permanent standing army and you can see that in the farewell address of Eisenhower that he was very concerned about that.
[03:50:24.723 --> 03:50:29.504]  About a permanent military industrial complex and how that was going to be run for profit.
[03:50:29.504 --> 03:50:33.306]  So that's something that is really kind of came into play
[03:50:34.006 --> 03:50:40.452]  After World War II, we've had a constant standing army, and it's been involved in constant war ever since then.
[03:50:40.452 --> 03:50:42.354]  And now that war is coming home.
[03:50:42.354 --> 03:50:49.120]  Now that military-industrial complex is starting to fund itself with domestic operations.
[03:50:49.120 --> 03:50:50.181]  And we're going to see that happen.
[03:50:50.181 --> 03:50:52.223]  We'll be right back in just a few minutes.
[03:50:52.223 --> 03:50:53.224]  We're going to take some more calls.
[03:51:09.352 --> 03:51:11.293]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[03:51:11.293 --> 03:51:13.695]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[03:51:13.695 --> 03:51:19.118]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[03:51:19.118 --> 03:51:23.141]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[03:51:23.141 --> 03:51:27.043]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[03:51:27.043 --> 03:51:28.424]  The fact is, you are.
[03:51:28.424 --> 03:51:29.444]  We all are.
[03:51:29.444 --> 03:51:31.766]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[03:51:32.066 --> 03:51:40.551]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[03:51:40.551 --> 03:51:41.932]  Be prepared before you need it.

[03:53:19.937 --> 03:53:26.604]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[03:53:26.604 --> 03:53:29.126]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[03:54:19.162 --> 03:54:19.942]  Alright, we're back.
[03:54:19.942 --> 03:54:25.064]  I'm David Knight, joined in the studio here with Jakari Jackson, and we're taking your calls.
[03:54:25.064 --> 03:54:27.405]  And let's go right to Mike in California.
[03:54:27.405 --> 03:54:31.027]  Mike, had we talked to you before, or is this a different Mike in California?
[03:54:31.027 --> 03:54:32.447]  No, this is a different Mike.
[03:54:32.447 --> 03:54:34.288]  Okay, how are you doing?
[03:54:34.288 --> 03:54:34.708]  Oh, good.
[03:54:34.708 --> 03:54:38.030]  First of all, you guys are playing some great music for the intro.
[03:54:38.030 --> 03:54:38.470]  Thanks.
[03:54:38.470 --> 03:54:44.132]  But I just wanted to say, I caught something in the FBI press conference after they caught the suspect.
[03:54:44.935 --> 03:54:47.418]  Uh, reporter asked, how did the suspect get away?
[03:54:47.418 --> 03:54:49.400]  And they said he got away on foot.
[03:54:49.400 --> 03:54:54.506]  So if he got away on foot, then how is it possible that he also ran over his brother trying to get away?
[03:54:55.071 --> 03:55:01.713]  Yeah, that was real iffy to me because there's speculation that maybe he was driving and then hopped out the car and then proceeded on foot.
[03:55:01.713 --> 03:55:13.556]  But even if he did proceed on foot, I mean, with that many officers around, I mean, the dragnet of that, I'm just not sure how he could get away with that many officers around him, especially if they had any type of helicopter coverage.
[03:55:13.556 --> 03:55:18.978]  Yeah, and even with the house-to-house Gestapo tactics that they were doing, you know, pulling people out of their houses at gunpoint.
[03:55:19.756 --> 03:55:20.857]  They didn't find him.
[03:55:20.857 --> 03:55:21.117]  Yeah.
[03:55:21.117 --> 03:55:23.859]  It was the guy who said, hey, I think there's somebody in my boat.
[03:55:23.859 --> 03:55:25.060]  And he turned him in.
[03:55:25.060 --> 03:55:26.921]  I mean, it's citizens who found him.
[03:55:26.921 --> 03:55:27.581]  Right.
[03:55:27.581 --> 03:55:29.463]  Anything else you want to say, Mike?
[03:55:29.463 --> 03:55:29.763]  Yeah.
[03:55:29.763 --> 03:55:30.764]  Yeah.
[03:55:30.764 --> 03:55:33.345]  Well, first of all, they were also already engaged in a firefight.
[03:55:33.345 --> 03:55:36.307]  So I don't see the guy getting away without being shot.
[03:55:36.307 --> 03:55:41.631]  But also I'm wondering, Michelle Obama has no official capacity whatsoever.
[03:55:41.631 --> 03:55:43.092]  She's not elected.
[03:55:43.092 --> 03:55:44.493]  She has no authority whatsoever.
[03:55:44.938 --> 03:55:53.941]  What right did she have to go in there and see somebody that was a person of interest in a massive terrorist plot?
[03:55:53.941 --> 03:55:57.162]  How did she get in through the back door into this hospital like this?
[03:55:57.162 --> 03:55:58.422]  And why?
[03:55:58.422 --> 03:56:00.863]  It's just a photo op and something to talk about.
[03:56:00.863 --> 03:56:03.184]  Just like you said, she has no elected office.
[03:56:03.184 --> 03:56:05.525]  She's the wife of the president.
[03:56:05.525 --> 03:56:06.125]  Yeah.
[03:56:06.125 --> 03:56:06.845]  Yeah.
[03:56:06.845 --> 03:56:07.205]  Absolutely.
[03:56:07.205 --> 03:56:08.026]  Well, thank you, Mike.
[03:56:08.026 --> 03:56:08.546]  Appreciate it.
[03:56:08.546 --> 03:56:11.387]  Let's go to Josh in Georgia.
[03:56:11.387 --> 03:56:11.947]  Josh, are you there?
[03:56:14.133 --> 03:56:15.774]  Hey, how are you?
[03:56:15.774 --> 03:56:18.476]  What you got?
[03:56:18.476 --> 03:56:21.418]  I've been better.
[03:56:21.418 --> 03:56:25.682]  The events of the last week are just, it's horrible.
[03:56:25.682 --> 03:56:29.565]  So what I wanted to do is kind of plug here.
[03:56:29.565 --> 03:56:38.271]  I've got a page on Facebook that I started in a group and it's called, the name of it is The Constitution is Alive.
[03:56:38.271 --> 03:56:43.335]  Granted, I know it's not a living document, but if the Constitution dies, so does this country.
[03:56:44.580 --> 03:56:45.041]  I'm good.
[03:57:02.005 --> 03:57:02.485]  I don't know.
[03:57:02.485 --> 03:57:02.945]  I don't know.
[03:57:18.793 --> 03:57:21.974]  Uh, for us to march on our state capitals.
[03:57:21.974 --> 03:57:26.535]  I feel that if you can make it to Washington, that'll be great.
[03:57:26.535 --> 03:57:31.777]  But if you can't make the cross-country trek, the state capitals will work.
[03:57:31.777 --> 03:57:38.179]  For gun owners across America to finally stand up and have our voice be heard where we can
[03:57:39.600 --> 03:57:43.823]  Absolutely, and your voice is going to be heard better at the state level than it is at the federal level.
[03:57:43.823 --> 03:57:46.184]  I mean, we've seen that over and over again.
[03:57:46.184 --> 03:57:48.826]  There are some legislators at the state level.
[03:57:48.826 --> 03:57:58.452]  We have some people here in Texas who are trying to fight the TSA's overreaching violation of the Fourth Amendment and other things.
[03:57:58.452 --> 03:58:05.637]  And so you do have some people who are pushing back against federal usurpation of power and overreach, and they're at the state level.
[03:58:05.637 --> 03:58:08.639]  So you need to really get involved there and support those people.
[03:58:10.131 --> 03:58:11.351]  And I have been.
[03:58:11.351 --> 03:58:21.173]  I haven't really gotten any feedback from anybody politically wise yet.
[03:58:21.173 --> 03:58:26.054]  Well, keep trying and tell people on your Facebook page to work against CISPA.
[03:58:26.054 --> 03:58:27.954]  That's the thing that's in the targets right now.
[03:58:27.954 --> 03:58:28.314]  Right.
[03:58:28.314 --> 03:58:29.275]  Well, that's it for today.
[03:58:29.275 --> 03:58:32.975]  Thanks for joining us and stay tuned for more developments.
