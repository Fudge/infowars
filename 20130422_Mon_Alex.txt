[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:12.000 --> 00:17.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:17.000 --> 00:20.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  Obviously, there are a lot of big world events we're going to be breaking down on a lot of huge news stories
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.000]  that have been ignored because of the tragic bombing attacks in Boston
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  and now the ensuing government power grab orgy that is going on.
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  The total wide open border, amnesty, 800 page plus bill,
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  Syspa passing the house, Russian or Chinese style net censorship
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  in the words of tech analyst Declan McCullough at CNET News.
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  I mean, even Google says it's draconian.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  That is rocketed through the house.
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  Homeland security be given even more autonomous power from the more and more ceremonial Congress.
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  Manipulations of gold downward, definitely the big mega banks are using paper gold
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.000]  in naked shorts to drive down the physical gold to hide the inflationary thing going on with paper currencies.
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  We've got that we've got federal furloughs hitting nations biggest airports.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  And we've got all the latest on the bombing.
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  It is all coming up today and former NSA analyst and before that submarine warfare expert.
[02:03.000 --> 02:10.000]  And of course, he worked for a bunch of other big companies and has been reporting on congressional national security issues
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  for over a decade.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  Wayne Madsen is going to be giving us his take on this situation.
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  And we also have Joel Scousen on who was on a few days after this happened last week.
[02:21.000 --> 02:28.000]  Also a national security analyst of substantive gravitas.
[02:28.000 --> 02:35.000]  Joel Scousen will be joining us the last 30 minutes of the transmission today to give us his take on all of this.
[02:35.000 --> 02:45.000]  Regardless of whether this is a staged event or not, you know this power structure is coming after your liberty, coming after your freedom.
[02:45.000 --> 02:55.000]  You know that and you know they're going to sell tens of billions of dollars of robots and you know they're going to sell more armored vehicles.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  And you know the military industrial complex, most of it foreign, is going to use this to turn America upside down.
[03:01.000 --> 03:10.000]  Obviously day one had happened, I said let's look for drills, let's look for stand downs, let's look for multiple Patsy grips, let's look for setups.
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  And let's follow who they say they believe it is.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  And the media said it's going to be a right winger, lone wolf and they said okay, they've been in arrest.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  Our word is right wing, lone wolf, you got owners are going to get the blame, we got you.
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  But because of all the photos out there, I think the evidence is clear.
[03:25.000 --> 03:32.000]  They said okay, we haven't been in arrest, we're letting the person go, we're shredding the courthouse down, panic, you know, kick the media out.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  And then they, the next day bring out the Patsy photos.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  And people are like oh, but they said they had a firefight with them.
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  Now witnesses and these articles are up at infowars.com say no, the naked guy being put in the car was the older brother.
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  No, they later saw him get run over by the police.
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.000]  And then you notice the younger brother gets out of the boat, climbs out of the boat.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  And then minutes later is getting what looks like a tracheotomy.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  And now he can't talk too good.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  And I'm sure after enough electroshock therapy he'll say whatever they want.
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  These guys clearly, and this fits the exact demo we've seen are double agents, triple agents.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  And the Israeli press, Deb Kofail is saying that.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  Now people will say how dare you say it wasn't a totally stage deal.
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  That is a stage deal.
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  I mean, 7-7 they were young secular style Muslims mainly.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  Liberals who it looked like were getting extra paychecks with MI5 and MI6.
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.000]  Well that came out.
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  And were being handled by a SWAT, a high-level Al-Qaeda operative who was also MI6
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  and is still allowed to travel in and out of England.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  He reportedly was their handler.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  Now that's London Telegraph, Fox News.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  And again, that's just one case I'm giving you.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  It's the same story over and over again.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  Look at Benghazi arming the Al-Qaeda.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  Look at what they're doing right now in Libya and Syria.
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  And then when they attack us, it's like, hey, you know, come out of your house with your hands up.
[04:57.000 --> 05:02.000]  We have video coming up of citizens coming out with their hands up in their homes
[05:02.000 --> 05:04.000]  with the cops aiming guns at them.
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  That is totally illegal and a bunch of bull and a power grab.
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here it is.
[05:13.000 --> 05:19.000]  The Calben Soap Company. Alex's staff have been using these all-natural, earth-friendly, pure soaps for years.
[05:19.000 --> 05:20.000]  And they are the best.
[05:20.000 --> 05:29.000]  See them on the web at www.5starsoap.com or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  Then order the sampler, one to two months supply.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  You will be getting soap products twice as good as what you're using now at a great price
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  and supporting an American company in the process.
[05:39.000 --> 05:44.000]  Earth-friendly and all-American. Their soaps are made from vegetable and coconut oils.
[05:44.000 --> 05:51.000]  Call 1-800-340-7091 or visit www.5starsoap.com.
[05:51.000 --> 05:58.000]  Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated.
[05:58.000 --> 06:08.000]  See it on the web www.5starsoap.com or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[06:08.000 --> 06:15.000]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving.
[06:15.000 --> 06:21.000]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[06:21.000 --> 06:28.000]  and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[06:28.000 --> 06:33.000]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[06:33.000 --> 06:39.000]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[06:47.000 --> 06:54.000]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  Check it out for yourself. It's incredible.

[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  That's infowarseteam.com.
[07:08.000 --> 07:17.000]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?

[08:31.000 --> 08:41.000]  We're here live on the radio, simulcasting video at infowarsnews.com and prisonplanet.tv, and we return every weeknight.
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern with InfoWars Nightly News.
[08:46.000 --> 08:59.000]  I want to try to be calm here and then open the phones up to take your phone calls until the bottom of the next hour when Wayne Madsen, journalist, award-winning researcher, former NSA analyst, joins us, a National Security Agency analyst,
[08:59.000 --> 09:11.000]  and then Joel Scowson of World Affairs Brief, Marine Corps Aviator, researcher, nephew of Cleon Scowson, obviously, and the naked communist.
[09:11.000 --> 09:20.000]  He is going to be joining us as well to give us his latest breakdown on all of this.
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  The big question is, where to begin today?
[09:24.000 --> 09:35.000]  I told you over the weekend what the big news would be that Glenn Beck was going to be putting out about the Saudi Arabian, and it's that the White House is involved in a cover-up.
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  Now, they could be doing that cover-up to create a rabbit trail to Saudi Arabian.
[09:40.000 --> 09:50.000]  Even though the foreign Saudi press is reporting the Saudi gentleman that was injured, the young man, is hooked into the royal family and did get visited by Michelle Obama,
[09:50.000 --> 09:59.000]  and there was an emergency meeting with the Saudi foreign minister, and the files of this guy are being altered and changed.
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.000]  That's coming out, and they are planning to deport them.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  They are planning to deport them.
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.000]  So, dead men tell no tales, and people deport it back to their own country.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  Obviously, we'll tell no tales, at least where the media can pick it up here.
[10:19.000 --> 10:26.000]  Now, all that said, I'm going to address that later, because I put a video out on it yesterday, predicted what would be released, because it was already released.
[10:26.000 --> 10:38.000]  It was already in the news last Friday that the White House is covering the shop in a bunch of other newspapers, and it's already in the news that the White House is acting very suspicious.
[10:38.000 --> 10:53.000]  Now, getting away from that report right now, and getting into the big issues that we're looking at right now, we can punch this up for TV viewers.
[10:53.000 --> 11:05.000]  The aunt says that the older brother, she says the naked man in the video being seen put in the patrol car, is him.
[11:05.000 --> 11:17.000]  The other brother was partying, and the night before all this happened, like he normally did, drinking and smoking pot and stuff, according to his friends, was not a practicing Muslim, by the way.
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  But they were pretty full of themselves and had a lot of extra money.
[11:22.000 --> 11:29.000]  You also, again, now have witnesses in the local news, these articles and videos are up on infowars.com.
[11:29.000 --> 11:42.000]  We're going to be breaking those down.
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  Again, they tend to throw news articles up on screen.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  I tend to look at those articles, start reading those articles and getting distracted.
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  The article I'm going to put up is my computer punched up right here, because this is the one I want to put up here.
[11:53.000 --> 12:03.000]  Yeah, the aunt claims naked man in video is him, and then you look at the video and you see the face on the person going into the car.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  It looks just like them.
[12:05.000 --> 12:18.000]  And then you've got other local news and witnesses reporting that the police ran him over in the car and sat there pumping rounds into him on the ground.
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.000]  And if you look at what happened to the other brother, he's reportedly in the boat.
[12:23.000 --> 12:30.000]  I was listening to the police scanner live five minutes before I went live Friday night at about 6.50.
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.000]  I went on early because I was listening to police scanner via Ustream, actually watching it.
[12:36.000 --> 12:45.000]  The guy had the Ustream set up there in Boston with the scanners, with millions, two million people were listening to it when I was watching it with a camera on the scanner.
[12:45.000 --> 13:00.000]  And the police were freaking out that media had gotten into a warehouse across a body of water nearby and were videotaping what was going on with live feeds.
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  And obviously you then sort of seeing that on the news.
[13:03.000 --> 13:11.000]  And then they pumped a bunch of bullets, looks like hundreds of bullets if you look at the boat into it, obviously trying to kill him.
[13:11.000 --> 13:20.000]  And then they get over there and then the police are panicking because now media they tried to keep out had footage of what was happening.
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.000]  So they pumped hundreds of rounds in, obviously trying to kill him.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  Then he stands up miraculously.
[13:29.000 --> 13:37.000]  And don't worry though, five minutes later he's being tricked and they're cutting into his throat to saving.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  And he's been able to date him. And then now he's reportedly, and again all these articles I'm mentioning are up on infowars.com.
[13:43.000 --> 13:50.000]  Then they start interrogating him now. The special national security feds that are there.
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  These are people on record that will torture children in front of their parents to get fake confessions.
[13:56.000 --> 14:03.000]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built until four years after he was already in jail.
[14:03.000 --> 14:13.000]  He might have confessed to killing Jesus 2,000 years ago. He might have confessed to killing Lincoln and blowing up the Lusitania and firebombing the Reichstag in Germany in 1933.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  He might have confessed to, you know, being mean to Santa Claus one Christmas morning.
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  Again, fake confessions, fake news, fake WMDs, fake fake fake.
[14:24.000 --> 14:32.000]  Now, again, there's so many data points here. I'm going to try to go over all of these for you, but here's what we know.
[14:32.000 --> 14:47.000]  The FBI five years ago visited the families of these young men to cover their butts, as they normally do, to create a history and a ledger that they were indeed watching the older brother and then recently the younger brother.
[14:47.000 --> 14:55.000]  Two and a half years ago in 2011, they visited them because the Russians blew their cover. That's what the Russians do.
[14:55.000 --> 15:03.000]  And said, we're putting in a national security Interpol complaint on these brothers going to Dagestan and going to Chechnya.
[15:03.000 --> 15:24.000]  And by the way, they're using aliases. And we know that through Interpol because the West has spent billions of dollars in Dagestan and in Chechnya and in surrounding areas, funding what is known as the Jihadi Wahhabist Crescent.
[15:24.000 --> 15:36.000]  And they have a man known as the Chechnyan bin Laden. Guys, type in Chechnyan bin Laden. This is who the brothers went to try to make contact with.
[15:36.000 --> 15:43.000]  And so they could get in and out of the country. Magically, they were able to get on aircraft and things with fake names.
[15:43.000 --> 15:51.000]  And now there's a whitewash going on that. Now, I told you it would end up that they had intelligence connections, not just FBI visits.
[15:51.000 --> 15:58.000]  Now, you want to go further? Because this is the biggest piece of the puzzle of hundreds that no one is even talking about.
[15:58.000 --> 16:07.000]  The FBI had them under surveillance for five years, probably CIA or maybe even foreign intelligence running these guys.
[16:07.000 --> 16:17.000]  Again, who's funding Al Qaeda publicly? Again, who just gave a hundred plus million dollars last week to the Syrian rebels?
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.000]  The State Department. It's over a billion dollars now total in the last two and a half years they've given them publicly.
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.000]  That's known Al Qaeda being funded to, again, take over countries. What is the West doing to Russia?
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  Radicalizing Muslims, but also sending in infiltrators to keep tabs on them. And who do they use?
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  Young men from England and the United States and Germany.
[16:37.000 --> 16:47.000]  Now, these guys suddenly had money. They suddenly, you know, they were flashy, always dressing like playboys, going through women like they were cracker jacks.
[16:47.000 --> 16:55.000]  These are not practicing Muslims. And that's why their father says it's a setup and that they've been set up.
[16:55.000 --> 17:04.000]  Do you understand that, ladies and gentlemen? This is just like Mohammed Atta, you know, at the strip bar two nights before, who it turns out, ladies and gentlemen,
[17:04.000 --> 17:11.000]  that these guys were absolutely being protected. So let's go over. Let's go over this for everybody here.
[17:11.000 --> 17:19.000]  That the FBI is saying did not know who they were. Here are their photos. Help us find them. We don't know who they are.
[17:19.000 --> 17:27.000]  Here's video. Here's photos. We don't know who they are. And I could watch the video and say there is clearly a Fed putting his earpiece in.
[17:27.000 --> 17:34.000]  And talking and because these guys all think they're James Bond, they act overly, you know, tough and cool into the role.
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  You see the cops all posing and sticking their jaws out as they order citizens out of their houses at gunpoint.
[17:40.000 --> 17:49.000]  This is all part of drama queening. And there's feds in that video they released, clearly drama queening, playing the part of secret agent.
[17:49.000 --> 17:59.000]  When they should have had their shirts hanging out, should have been picking their nose, should have been sitting there with a whiskey bottle, you know, in a bag,
[17:59.000 --> 18:06.000]  and then like picked up a phone and dialed it like they were mentally ill. Then you wouldn't have been spotted feds.
[18:06.000 --> 18:14.000]  You should have been sitting there with trash all over the ground up against that wall with a beer can. Instead, you're playing secret agent.
[18:14.000 --> 18:26.000]  I mean, you guys are a joke because it's all part of your template that you're, you've arrived. I mean, I go to 007 movies and stuff.
[18:26.000 --> 18:35.000]  And like half the theater is filled with cops. I went to Olympus as fallen and it was just full of cops, full of cops.
[18:35.000 --> 18:43.000]  And walking out, I said, hey, you're cops. And they're like, how do you know that, Jones? And I'm like, come on, look at your body language.
[18:43.000 --> 18:53.000]  You're in here for your brainwashing download of the imaginary terrorists that are everywhere and you're Hercules fighting the seven headed Hydra.
[18:53.000 --> 19:07.000]  I mean, you're there in a brainwashing chamber being brainwashed to be given ancestral programming, psychological programming of simulated terror attacks that do not exist.
[19:07.000 --> 19:19.000]  And the cops have like tears in their eyes in these movies and in copter listing, you know, you go into it and they're all sitting back watching in the theater while the real war, by the way, is going on all around you.
[19:19.000 --> 19:25.000]  You go when you watch Batman fight the terrorist. I mean, it just goes on and on and on. And that's all this is. So I'm going to try to regroup.
[19:25.000 --> 19:31.000]  I mean, I'm doing a pretty good job, I think, but it's just my mind is exploding in thousands of directions and try to just give you the timeline.
[19:31.000 --> 19:39.000]  That's probably the best way. I did a great presentation right before I went live on air. I was had Rob do recording memes.
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  We can get all the documents together to get me ready for a special report tonight on the nightly news.
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.000]  And I recorded it onto his iPhone audio of the whole timeline. And it just I just gave dozens of points.
[19:49.000 --> 19:56.000]  And then once I get on air, I've only gone over basic ones, but I haven't. I haven't gotten to the big enchilada yet or I didn't point it out properly.
[19:56.000 --> 20:04.000]  They knew who these guys were when they released their photos to you. Oh, help us. Here's the only guys you have to look at. Who are they?
[20:04.000 --> 20:27.000]  You know who they are. They were at least double agents. You've heard about our MRE smorgasbord. Now Long Life Food Depot introduces the most unique, safe and longest lasting way to stash emergency food, the eat pod.

[21:07.000 --> 21:22.000]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors. Are we going to see economic growth? Slide into a recession or at worst, depression. Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources. We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[21:22.000 --> 21:36.000]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven. But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means? Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.

[24:24.000 --> 24:34.000]  Next time, one reported gunman is on the street. I guess the police have to lock down an entire city and come door to door aiming guns at you and going in your house without a warrant.
[24:34.000 --> 24:45.000]  That's called public safety. Actually, it's called martial law. This is the end. They sure needed to hunt down both brothers and kill them.
[24:45.000 --> 24:56.000]  And they sure thought they'd killed him after they pumped hundreds of rounds into the boat. But unfortunately, I was listening to a police scanner live via Ustream from Boston.
[24:56.000 --> 25:03.000]  They were like, oh my gosh, the media's got a fix on the boat. Get in there and get that media out of there.
[25:03.000 --> 25:21.000]  But then the younger brother climbed up out of it and climbed out. And so they were unable to, I guess, burn him down or shoot him like they did doerner to make sure we never find out what really happened.
[25:21.000 --> 25:30.000]  So then they had to get him down on the ground and do, I guess, a tracheotomy it looked like on him to make sure. They said he may never be able to talk, but he's communicating with investigators.
[25:30.000 --> 25:42.000]  I'm not sure he'll confess very quickly. They have to. The water board is a mother in front of him. And again, I'm not saying they might not have actually been part of the drill, planted something.
[25:42.000 --> 25:50.000]  They could even be real double triple agents as Debka file in Israel is reporting. But what I told you is now confirmed.
[25:50.000 --> 26:04.000]  There was a big fat drill with 400 military, just National Guard, a bunch of other military and playing clothes, FBI, 2000 police on that route and hundreds of them at the end.
[26:04.000 --> 26:13.000]  And it didn't protect you. So I don't want to lose my rights. And by the way, the martial law isn't what caught him.
[26:13.000 --> 26:23.000]  It was outside the search, cordon area of much of the city. And it turned out finally after the people were allowed out of their lock down, it's all prison planet training.
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.000]  You know, you're locked down when they stay in the city now. Don't come out of your homes for your security, terrorist are in the area.
[26:29.000 --> 26:37.000]  That's how they live in communist and fascist countries. They just announced when you can't come out of your home or when there's a daytime or nighttime curfew.
[26:37.000 --> 26:45.000]  But it's all for your safety, of course. It's all for your safety, of course. It's all to stop the drug dealers to when the government ships the drugs in.
[26:45.000 --> 26:57.000]  They create the crisis to offer the solution to run our lives. And then the neighbor, you know, looks out and sees the boat and sees the blood on it.
[26:57.000 --> 27:09.000]  And oh, because the lockdown had been lifted. He wouldn't dare go out while the lockdown was on. He sat there and looked at the blood on the boat and everything and waited.
[27:09.000 --> 27:15.000]  And when the lockdown was over, he went out to look and thought he saw somebody in there. So he went and called the police.
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.000]  He followed his orders. Man, I'm telling you, the police announced, you're locked down in Austin. Do not leave your home.
[27:21.000 --> 27:28.000]  You know what? I'm going to go out. I've had enough of the stinking government. By the way, you're running Al-Qaeda and everybody knows it.
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.000]  130-something mil. You guys pull up this Associated Press. It's from my stack yesterday.
[27:33.000 --> 27:41.000]  130-plus mil given to the Syrian rebels last week. Al-Qaeda murdering Christians en masse.
[27:41.000 --> 27:47.000]  And then here's the big smoking gun of a bunch of them. I'm going to try to walk through this. I'm going to do the timeline in the next segment.
[27:47.000 --> 27:57.000]  I'm so wound up today. U.S. providing, excuse me, 123 million more in aid. That's politico.
[27:57.000 --> 28:05.000]  I guess the last funding was 130 million. To Al-Qaeda.
[28:05.000 --> 28:12.000]  You know, I wish somebody locked Washington down and we could arrest all the criminals there.
[28:12.000 --> 28:18.000]  You know, it's one thing the police say. We believe a bank robber is on this block. Please don't come out of your home in this area.
[28:18.000 --> 28:24.000]  But when you lock down an entire, most of a city and then outside the city, it's a joke, folks. It's a bunch of grandstanding.
[28:24.000 --> 28:34.000]  Military coming to your house, coming in, and I've got all these videos up on infowars.com of pointing guns at people.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  And it's all part of their cult. Government always creates cults of doing what we say.
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.000]  And finally, every culture says, bring your firstborn up at the temple. We're going to cut their heart out tomorrow.
[28:43.000 --> 28:50.000]  And people say, government said so. So you bring your little kid, the druids, you bring your little kid out to a bonfire.
[28:50.000 --> 28:57.000]  That's where the term bonfire comes from. They'd have it sizzling hot and they'd grab the kid by the arms and legs.
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.000]  Usually like 10-year-olds. That was one of the most popular with the druids.
[29:01.000 --> 29:12.000]  You know, young boy. And one, two, three. Throw them into a big fire.
[29:12.000 --> 29:21.000]  Ah, and that nice. And government said so. I mean, they're doing it for your safety. The crops won't grow if you don't do it.
[29:21.000 --> 29:27.000]  We come back. I'm going to settle down and go through it all. I've got to just settle down here.
[29:27.000 --> 29:35.000]  By the way, thousands of nine-month-old babies reportedly butchered until the sewage lines always had to be pumped out with their little parts.
[29:35.000 --> 29:41.000]  And guess who? When I saw this, I didn't believe it. I went and looked it up and it's true. Guess who owns the abortion clinic?
[29:41.000 --> 29:48.000]  Where they would put babies in the toilet to drown. They would struggle and try to swim and fight with their lives.
[29:48.000 --> 29:54.000]  Oh, guess who? The Attorney General. Anything dirty and bad, they're involved in it.
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  Fast and furious, you know, but they wouldn't be involved in this.
[29:57.000 --> 30:08.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.000]  You may be arrested and or subjected to other police action.

[30:17.000 --> 30:20.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[30:25.000 --> 30:32.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[30:32.000 --> 30:38.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[30:42.000 --> 30:52.000]  Repair to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[30:52.000 --> 30:56.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.

[33:09.000 --> 33:16.000]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run.
[33:16.000 --> 33:21.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[33:21.000 --> 33:39.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[33:39.000 --> 34:05.000]  Thank you so much for joining us and we are showing video to TV viewers of what looks like about 20 police firing in mass with 223s and 308s over and over and over again into the boat.
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  And then waiting about an hour and 45 minutes for him to bleed to death.
[34:10.000 --> 34:23.000]  By the way, there is even more of this footage but it has cuss words over it so we are only seeing about half of it of the sustained fire where it appears they load and reload their clips three or four times.
[34:23.000 --> 34:41.000]  And let's be conservative, 15 officers or so, you can see a whole line of flashes where it looks about 50 yards firing into the boat, hopefully killing patch C number two while telling everyone that they sure wanted him to be alive.
[34:41.000 --> 35:09.000]  And of course you've got the other brother, reportedly now witnesses are saying that they saw the police run over him and fill his body full of holes and the aunt and others are saying that it is video of the older brother, Tamerlin, being brought naked into the police car.
[35:09.000 --> 35:17.000]  And then I guess you just stage a firefight and then say that you killed him.
[35:17.000 --> 35:25.000]  Again, we're seeing all the signs just like with Dorner where they said, we're going to burn this mother effer up, yeah, burn down that cabin, burn it down.
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.000]  And then, okay, we've got the fire placing the fire, it's on fire, good mission completed, we burn him down.
[35:30.000 --> 35:31.000]  And a big celebration.
[35:31.000 --> 35:40.000]  And then we reported it and the news said, Jones is a conspiracy theorist, there is no audio of them saying burn it down. That was that night.
[35:40.000 --> 35:47.000]  Then the next day they said, well, they said burn down the cabin, burn that mother effer down, but that doesn't mean burn it.
[35:47.000 --> 36:00.000]  Now, who's the conspiracy theorist, who's the liar, and who isn't, you all heard them on six different feeds, three different individuals talking about burning the mother effer down.
[36:00.000 --> 36:13.000]  And it is the same story here, here yet again, here yet again today, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:13.000 --> 36:23.000]  We are seeing the same thing happen with continued rapidity.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  Now, again, here's the giant trillion pound enchilada.
[36:27.000 --> 36:37.000]  They told you, here's the photos, we've got to show you these photos, we've got to go over these photos, because we don't know who these people are.
[36:37.000 --> 36:44.000]  And we need your help finding them, but don't look at any of the other photos of the obvious drill and obvious other patsies.
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  And they've come out now, the FBI said, we didn't want people looking at other stuff.
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  It was going to cause a problem.
[36:50.000 --> 36:58.000]  Oh, yes, I know it was because you'd lied about there being a drill and they're lying to people saying they didn't know who they were.
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  Here are the articles.
[37:00.000 --> 37:08.000]  Boston bomber FBI dropped the ball over.
[37:08.000 --> 37:20.000]  Tamerlin, the FBI was alerted by Russian security services to serious new concerns about one of the Boston bomb suspects as recently as November.
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  It was claimed on Sunday night.
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.000]  And since then, the FBI has indeed admitted to all of that.
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.000]  And of course, they were talking to their family about them for five years.
[37:35.000 --> 37:44.000]  The Russians blew their cover two and a half years ago saying, why are you letting these guys go in and out of these terrorist-controlled areas?
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  We think this guy is suspicious.
[37:46.000 --> 37:47.000]  They should.
[37:47.000 --> 38:01.000]  Kurt Nemo wrote an article about it on Sunday, actually Saturday, about the State Department funding billions of dollars to the bin Laden of Chechnya that this gentleman,
[38:01.000 --> 38:07.000]  brother number one, the older dead brother, dead men tell no tales that he reportedly worked with.
[38:07.000 --> 38:15.000]  So he reportedly was under the influence and was inspired by Chechen warlord on State Department payroll,
[38:15.000 --> 38:22.000]  who the FBI had been following and talking to now for five years, five years, five years.
[38:22.000 --> 38:28.000]  By the way, the family said five years before they admitted two and a half years and now five years is confirmed.
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  So they were on these guys forever.
[38:31.000 --> 38:40.000]  But they released photos and videos saying, gee, we don't know who they are when you can see feds watching them in the doorway as they walk by.
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  Was Boston bomber inspired by Russia's bin Laden?
[38:43.000 --> 38:50.000]  Mother claims FBI tracked older brother for five years after told by Moscow of links to Chechen terrorist.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  Well, yeah, Moscow was blowing his cover.
[38:53.000 --> 39:01.000]  That's how agencies get rid of somebody without killing them and starting a new Cold War is they simply say, hey, here's your agents, knock it off.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  Now, it gets worse.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  Here is the Huffington Post and here is Politico.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  But they hide this in plain view.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  Representative Mike Rogers.
[39:10.000 --> 39:23.000]  Tamerlan may have traveled to Russia under an alias under an alias. Mike Rogers.
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  The older brother may have traveled to Russia under an alias.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  And it's not really Russia.
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  It's to Uzbekistan and to Chechnya.
[39:34.000 --> 39:42.000]  And the Russians came and said, this guy, this guy looks like he's one of your people. Get him out of here.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  Lindsey Graham says wrong name hid the Russia trip.
[39:45.000 --> 39:53.000]  Oh, the senator is helping us understand exactly why that happened.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  It is so frustrating.
[39:55.000 --> 40:04.000]  Can't there ever be a bombing where let me show TV viewers and for radio listeners, I will.
[40:04.000 --> 40:09.000]  For radio listeners, I will simply give you the headline on this.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  You can see it all for yourself.
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.000]  Chair expert London bombings mastermind is MI6 asset.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  We have that article saved.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.000]  It was from the London Daily Telegraph.
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  And then there's Fox News under it.
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  You just search MI6 agent 777 bombings.
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  777 London bomber MI6 agent.
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.000]  That was by the way, John Loftus, former head of counterterrorism for the FBI.
[40:36.000 --> 40:48.000]  Oh, so there's just some of the headlines. Democratic underground London bombing mastermind on MI6 agent.
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  Daily Mail MI6 told agent it couldn't kill Al Qaeda.
[40:53.000 --> 40:59.000]  London bombing ringleader Haroun Rashid, a SWAT double agent.
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  He wasn't a double agent.
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.000]  He was allowed to fly in and out of the country for years after the bombing.
[41:04.000 --> 41:13.000]  And it turned out is an MI6 officer, not an asset, not an agent, an officer.
[41:13.000 --> 41:23.000]  Let me say it again, an officer of MI6 commanded the quote, Death's rule.
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  All you cops think you're G.I. and Joe, you actually work for Cobra.
[41:27.000 --> 41:36.000]  But look how simple that is that you work for Cobra and you don't even know it.
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.000]  The government is Cobra.
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  Here at Cobra, so chaos to bring order.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  And weapons sales. See, it's all a big joke, all in your face.
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  Look how the police dress like Cobra.
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  And all the children watching that, everybody thought Cobra was cooler.
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  You were all being imprinted. All being imprinted with predictive programming.
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.000]  Cobra brings in a world government. Cobra gets rid of gold, brings in cashless systems.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  Cobra brainwashes kids through television. Have you watched those old 80s cartoons?
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.000]  Cobra currency.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  Hail Cobra.
[42:15.000 --> 42:18.000]  That's what the intelligence agencies are. They run the narcotics.
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  They run the snuff films. They run the little kids. They run all of it.
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  And they get caught running all of it. And it doesn't even matter.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  And they get caught running these guys.
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  And I said, whoever these patsies are, they're going to kill them.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  But they pumped. I don't know.
[42:33.000 --> 42:39.000]  If you blow that video up where they're shooting, it goes on for about 40 seconds.
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.000]  And there's a line of guns that looks like it's about 50 yards long.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  Back through the trees. You can see the flashes.
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.000]  And you can tell they're firing from drums. They're firing from 30 round mags.
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.000]  And you can see some of the guns stopping for a second.
[42:57.000 --> 43:05.000]  Two seconds as they reload firing, firing probably 60 rounds to 100 rounds per person into that boat.
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  And folks show the bullet ridden boat.
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  Just type in bullet ridden boat or the terrorist boat.
[43:15.000 --> 43:22.000]  And I mean, there are bullet holes from 308 and 223 every half inch over the entire boat.
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  Now, what was the mission there?
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.000]  Did they go pump tear gas in and say come out with your hands up?
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.000]  By the way, the witnesses say he didn't shoot at him with his quote carbine.
[43:33.000 --> 43:40.000]  He was hiding in there and they pulled up and they unloaded.
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.000]  Because they were told kill him.
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  That's why they told the media, you cover this, we're going to kill you.
[43:46.000 --> 43:53.000]  That's why they told citizens, you come out of your house, you're dead.
[43:53.000 --> 43:58.000]  All right, you know, let me just do this. Let me just take calls.
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.000]  And when I start the next hour, I'll do the timeline.
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.000]  Because I actually wrote some notes on this and it's just so frustrating.
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  But is anybody going to call the FBI on the big elephant in the room?
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  They lied for five years, not two and a half.
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  They knew who these guys were.
[44:13.000 --> 44:18.000]  And these guys clearly had fake identification and were allowed to travel in and out under aliases.
[44:18.000 --> 44:25.000]  They interviewed the head of the U.S. Embassy Visa section, Springman, look it up, Toronto Star was the first to break it in 2001,
[44:25.000 --> 44:33.000]  where they were ordered to let Mohammed Atta and the other 14 hijackers from Saudi Arabia back into the U.S.
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.000]  They were flagged as terrorists and they said we're not letting them in
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.000]  and the State Department had the CIA column and say those are our agents, our assets.
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  They're not terrorists, that's their cover.
[44:43.000 --> 44:47.000]  And then we've got Lieutenant Colonel Butler, the head of the Defense Language School at the time.
[44:47.000 --> 44:53.000]  Going on the news, going to the newspaper and saying five of the hijackers were in my school,
[44:53.000 --> 44:58.000]  Mohammed Atta and two others were in my class for a year.
[44:58.000 --> 45:05.000]  Two semesters at the Defense Language School, two years before 9-11, he knew Mohammed Atta,
[45:05.000 --> 45:10.000]  he drank coffee with Mohammed Atta at the commissary and had lunch with him.
[45:10.000 --> 45:20.000]  Mohammed Atta sat two rows back for two semesters and all the colonel said is folks,
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.000]  the government was involved in this, these guys are patsies.
[45:23.000 --> 45:31.000]  Those hijackers on the news are U.S. government trained.
[45:31.000 --> 45:36.000]  Now that's San Jose Mercury News, that's Associated Press.
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.000]  The media is listening before all the White House organs because I know you work for the White House
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  media matters and all the rest of you, it's on record you do.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  But most of you aren't real terrorists, most of you aren't real criminal globalists.
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.000]  You probably wouldn't hurt the neighbor's dog if you were offered a million dollars.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  But see, just denying all this doesn't make you not guilty.
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  When you sit here and go, Alex the crazy says the government ran the 9-11 hijackers.
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  I don't know what really happened once they got on those airplanes.
[46:03.000 --> 46:11.000]  All I know is there was a stand down ordered at NORAD and whether it's 7-7, the London bombings,
[46:11.000 --> 46:18.000]  whether it's the Madrid bombings on 3-3-3 in 2003, whether it is 9-11, whether it is this event,
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  whether it is the bombings in Afghanistan where the president comes out and says,
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  yeah, your government is staging these terror attacks and runs Taliban and Al Qaeda.
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  Well, that all came out years ago.
[46:28.000 --> 46:37.000]  They took, here's the toll free number, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[46:37.000 --> 46:48.000]  They took, they took 11 to 14 year olds and made them dig ditches around Kabul
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.000]  and the other two or three big cities in Afghanistan.
[46:52.000 --> 46:59.000]  And then they, under Al Qaeda orders, put them out there and then the US going in there with NATO
[46:59.000 --> 47:02.000]  did not attack any of the bases, any of the cities.
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.000]  And if you go back to the time that was in the news, why aren't they targeting the leadership?
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.000]  They went and put innocent conscripts in there for a simulated attack
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.000]  because Al Qaeda and Taliban worked for the US on record.
[47:14.000 --> 47:19.000]  This all came out, it's called the Airlift of Evil, and they killed tens of thousands of children
[47:19.000 --> 47:27.000]  that they gave AK-47s to fight Huff the Magic Dragon C-130s and drones and the rest of it.
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.000]  And they blew them all up as a simulation.
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.000]  They were just part of a simulation. They were real dying.
[47:33.000 --> 47:39.000]  Then US troops go in, they're not part of the cover story, they're just told what to do.
[47:39.000 --> 47:47.000]  And Taliban and Al Qaeda turn themselves in, they're loaded on C-130s given chest of gold and weapons
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.000]  and US colonels, one colonel in Special Forces went public to the San Francisco Chronicle,
[47:52.000 --> 47:57.000]  said we were ordered to fly 30,000 to 40,000 of them over the mountains into Pakistan
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  and give them weapons and gold.
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.000]  They showed up, I give up, now give me gold.
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.000]  Give me gold now and rockets launch it.
[48:08.000 --> 48:14.000]  You want us to take out Pakistan so you have excuse to, I'm giving a Russian accent, whatever.
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  We'll do it for you. And we grow opium, yes.
[48:18.000 --> 48:26.000]  See a faction of the Taliban was real and had cut opium production from 90% of world production in 2000 or 1999
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  to about 2001, it was 9% of world opium production.
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.000]  Within a couple of years back to 93% of world opium production.
[48:35.000 --> 48:41.000]  800-259-9231 and let's launch the phone system for me guys, thank you.
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  Now, that's a daily drill.
[48:44.000 --> 48:53.000]  Now continuing here, ladies and gentlemen,
[48:53.000 --> 49:02.000]  I see the same story like Groundhog Day, day after day,
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.000]  week after week, month after month, year after year, and then it comes out, they've got aliases,
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.000]  it comes out they're being protected, it comes out they're bragging to people that they're hot shots,
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  they're driving around with their buddies and cars that says,
[49:15.000 --> 49:21.000]  on the license plate, I mean this is rock star party time.
[49:21.000 --> 49:30.000]  And their dad comes out and says they were being handled for five years by intelligence groups.
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.000]  And I said Monday before all this happened, I said if somebody asked you to be part of a drill,
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.000]  invite you out to be part of a drill, it doesn't matter if the drill is even announced,
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.000]  they may blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  Do not take a bag, do not be part of a drill.
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  That's what happened on 7-7.
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  That's what happened on the first World Trade Center attack in 1993.
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  It came out in the New York Times that the FBI cooked the bomb,
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  trained the driver, shut up the guys, gave them the detonator,
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  and some evidence shows they thought they were part of the drill.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  We know the guy, the FBI hired to cook the bomb, was told it was a drill,
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  and he goes, well I thought it was supposed to be a dummy bomb.
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  No, it's a real bomb. Here's the materials.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  Now here's the real detonator.
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  Okay, now tomorrow's the bombing, bust them.
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.000]  No, we're going to pull you off the case now.
[50:20.000 --> 50:26.000]  You're going to let the bombing go forward, we're going to let them park it and then stop them.
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  And the CIA asset went, Ahmad Salam said,
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  I think you're trying to set me up, I don't want to be part of this evil.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  And they said, just do what you're told.
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  Do what you're told. The transcripts came out in court.
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  Much of it got declared national security.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  Do what you're told.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  And you could imagine them telling the patsies.
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  Do what you're told, drop off these bags.
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  You want more money for your girlfriends, don't you?
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  Mr. Hot Shot, Mr. Movie Star with your cool sunglasses.
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.000]  And then once their cover got blown, the mission was kill them.
[51:04.000 --> 51:33.000]  Kill them, execute them, get rid of them.
[51:34.000 --> 51:35.000]  Street.
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  You can't kill them.
[51:36.000 --> 51:37.000]  I don't know if they saw that.
[51:37.000 --> 51:38.000]  You can't kill them.

[54:11.880 --> 54:22.880]  Today after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly
[54:22.880 --> 54:23.880]  still.
[54:23.880 --> 54:33.880]  But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool, and he never gives
[54:33.880 --> 54:34.880]  an answer.
[54:34.880 --> 54:36.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, back live.
[54:36.880 --> 54:40.520]  I'm going to open the phones up and take your phone calls on this whole thing.
[54:40.520 --> 54:46.320]  While we're busy distracted by the bombing and the martial law rollout that is happening,
[54:46.320 --> 54:51.360]  while all of that's going on, what else is unfolding?
[54:51.360 --> 54:56.280]  Shispa that openly censors and tracks the Internet and gets rid of the Fourth Amendment
[54:56.280 --> 55:00.120]  for an electronic, technotronic tyranny.
[55:00.120 --> 55:04.440]  That's been rammed through the house, ramming into the Senate, unprecedented evil.
[55:04.440 --> 55:10.720]  One border promotion, total legalization, amnesty, you name it, 800 plus pages.
[55:10.720 --> 55:17.240]  A bunch of other draconian garbage is going on while we're all distracted by this.
[55:17.240 --> 55:22.360]  And again, babies are being aborted everywhere, including babies that can be adopted.
[55:22.360 --> 55:24.200]  But oh, the media doesn't cry for them.
[55:24.200 --> 55:26.400]  The media doesn't get sad for them.
[55:26.400 --> 55:32.120]  It's only these three people that are dead, which they use as psychological trauma to
[55:32.120 --> 55:36.680]  scare everyone into going along with this tyranny.
[55:36.680 --> 55:40.040]  By the way, we're almost sold out of the March issue of Welcome to Planet Hoax.
[55:40.040 --> 55:45.040]  If you want to buy it in bulk, it exposes stage terror, the frauds that they don't want
[55:45.040 --> 55:48.960]  our guns, the frauds that they're not buying bullets, and so much more.
[55:48.960 --> 55:55.000]  If you want the issue of the magazine in bulk at cost, order it now at infowarstore.com
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.280]  or by calling 888-253-3139.
[55:59.280 --> 56:02.520]  And also, we've got all the water filters discounted, the very best water filters out
[56:02.520 --> 56:05.520]  there, like Propure, with promo code water.
[56:05.520 --> 56:06.520]  It's 10% off.
[56:06.520 --> 56:09.840]  They're already lowest price at infowarstore.com.
[56:09.840 --> 56:14.120]  We have all the pro second amendment t-shirts, you name it.
[56:14.120 --> 56:18.680]  By the way, something I haven't gotten to yet, California gun confiscation bill passes
[56:18.680 --> 56:24.640]  approves 24 million to expedite gun confiscation.
[56:24.640 --> 56:27.120]  By the way, that's not my headline.
[56:27.120 --> 56:29.120]  That's the Huffington Post.
[56:29.120 --> 56:34.680]  We're very excited about the gun confiscation, but nobody's coming for your guns.
[56:34.680 --> 56:39.480]  So that's coming up, also, again, the baby swimming and fighting for its life in the
[56:39.480 --> 56:43.720]  toilet as they tried to basically cram it down the toilet.
[56:43.720 --> 56:46.520]  They got too lazy to even chop the babies up, and people are like, you know, we don't
[56:46.520 --> 56:47.520]  want to hear this.
[56:47.520 --> 56:48.520]  It's so horrible.
[56:48.520 --> 56:53.960]  Well, hearing it, how about doing it?
[56:53.960 --> 56:56.480]  And then people in the YouTube video I did about it are like, so what?
[56:56.480 --> 56:58.560]  Get out of a woman's life.
[56:58.560 --> 57:00.640]  Just a nine month old baby.
[57:00.640 --> 57:07.480]  There's more people that want to adopt than actually there are abortions every year.
[57:07.480 --> 57:13.440]  It'd be better for the woman just to have the baby medically.
[57:13.440 --> 57:17.120]  It increases women's chance of getting cancer.
[57:17.120 --> 57:25.000]  And I just sit there and I watch how how callous the so-called leftist, they're not leftist.
[57:25.000 --> 57:33.120]  They're authoritarians and they sit there and they make jokes about the dead baby.
[57:33.120 --> 57:37.560]  And they sit there and, you know, see, oh, the baby was exercising in the toilet.
[57:37.560 --> 57:45.080]  I saw comments on info wars.com about get out of a woman's, you know, bedroom, let the
[57:45.080 --> 57:47.560]  baby get exercise in the toilet.
[57:47.560 --> 57:53.160]  You know, I bet you wouldn't have the nerve to sit there and chop those babies up on that
[57:53.160 --> 57:58.160]  table like like hamburger or like barbecue.
[57:58.160 --> 58:01.440]  I bet you wouldn't have the nerve to throw that baby in the toilet and watch it struggle
[58:01.440 --> 58:05.880]  for its life and drowned.
[58:05.880 --> 58:09.920]  It's part of this disconnected decadence that's overtaken our country where the very same
[58:09.920 --> 58:15.080]  people say ban eating meat because it's bad to animals and they call it cruel if someone
[58:15.080 --> 58:17.760]  butchers their own chicken.
[58:17.760 --> 58:18.760]  They're so disconnected.
[58:18.760 --> 58:23.320]  I see PETA all the time, you know, saying arrest people that watch their own chickens or whatever
[58:23.320 --> 58:24.680]  for animal cruelty.
[58:24.680 --> 58:28.480]  See, they think you're butchering a chicken because you're cruel not because you've been
[58:28.480 --> 58:32.520]  raised to do it yourself.
[58:32.520 --> 58:37.640]  So they care about animals but not about humans.
[58:37.640 --> 58:40.440]  And of course, it's the environmentalists that have said kill babies up to age three
[58:40.440 --> 58:41.440]  for the earth.
[58:41.440 --> 58:45.600]  Oh, but they want us to turn our guns in and ban black powder now because of what happened
[58:45.600 --> 58:50.880]  at the Boston Marathon.
[58:50.880 --> 58:58.680]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:58.680 --> 59:02.120]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms.
[59:02.120 --> 59:06.080]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your
[59:06.080 --> 59:08.160]  arsenal for home protection.
[59:08.160 --> 59:12.080]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[59:12.080 --> 59:13.600]  Check out Simply Safe.
[59:13.600 --> 59:18.040]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[59:18.040 --> 59:20.920]  Go to GetSimplySafe.com.
[59:20.920 --> 59:23.440]  Simply Safe is independent and off the grid.
[59:23.440 --> 59:27.880]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.
[59:27.880 --> 59:32.800]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer,
[59:32.800 --> 59:34.600]  storage unit or shed.
[59:34.600 --> 59:37.000]  GetSimplySafe.com.
[59:37.000 --> 59:41.160]  Simply Safe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes.
[59:41.160 --> 59:44.200]  So there's no need to let a stranger into your home.
[59:44.200 --> 59:48.320]  If you move or need to relocate, you can take the system with you wherever you go.
[59:48.320 --> 59:52.320]  You aren't always at home, but Simply Safe will stand guard protecting your property
[59:52.320 --> 59:55.080]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[59:55.080 --> 01:00:12.960]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.200]  Big Brother.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.000]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.800]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.320]  You want answers?
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.920]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:32.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.080]  One thing is certainly clear.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:40.720]  There is a massive cover-up going on surrounding the bombings of last Monday, and other things
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:41.720]  sure politically.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.280]  They're going to use this to try to ban black powder or restrict its purchase.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.320]  Again, somebody does something bad, so we all lose our rights.
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.080]  That's called authoritarianism.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.600]  You don't punish the individual.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.600]  You punish the group.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:59.280]  And one thing's also for sure, they use this for a martial law takeover drill.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.280]  Absolutely disgusting.
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.720]  And they first said they were shooting rubber bullets into the boat, but they were real
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.720]  bullets.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.220]  That's now admitted.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.520]  And so we're going to be breaking all of this down.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:13.800]  Toll Free Number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.160]  Too bad for the anti-gun people that tried to blame conservatives for this.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.320]  That was what they were going to go with.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.720]  But suspects not licensed to own guns.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.240]  So I guess in that area, you've got to have a bunch of licenses to get them.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.240]  Didn't stop them.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.080]  Never stops anybody who's bad.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.760]  You could ban all the guns for citizens today.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:37.560]  Anybody could walk up to a cop with a ball peen hammer, beat their brains out.
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.560]  It's easy.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.560]  Just ban.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.560]  Ball peen hammer, you're out.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.560]  Hit them twice more in the temple.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.560]  They're dead.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.560]  Take the weapon.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.880]  That's why they hate veterans.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.080]  The globalists hate veterans, because veterans know how easy it is to kill and have the
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.080]  initiative.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.920]  They don't have the chicken neck ideas about it.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:59.000]  Man, I tell you, being a domesticated, servile country now is really painful.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  But see, there's a problem.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.760]  A bunch of us aren't servile.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.960]  A bunch of us aren't brainwashed and cattle.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.760]  A bunch of us know what's going on.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.280]  Does it matter if you can get 51% to vote to take our guns or make us slaves again?
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.280]  It isn't going to work.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.560]  Nick and Nevada, you're on the air.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560]  Welcome.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.560]  Yes, Alex.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.360]  First of all, I just want to say that it is a truly honor and a privilege to finally
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.280]  get through and to talk to you on air.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.720]  I've been waiting a long time to be able to get this opportunity.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.040]  And I just want to say thank you.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.040]  Please don't take me out.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.160]  But what's the info?
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.800]  Well, we are living in September 11, 2001 all over again.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.280]  We're seeing senators and president being sent letters.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.280]  Plays with chemicals.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.720]  We're seeing suspicious packages left everywhere.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.800]  And all the mind control and all the fear mongering that they put onto people is all
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.560]  for the purpose of having the full control over everybody.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:55.280]  And now we're seeing it on a larger scale with the take down and the takeover of Boston
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.000]  and the complete, you know, martial law.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.160]  And it's going to spread throughout the entire country.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.120]  As they said, there will have more stage events coming up.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.480]  And obviously they're going to, you know, they have gone this far.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.960]  It was said that they can't go any further.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:12.480]  And for anybody out there who thinks that the FBI did not set up these stage events
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.560]  is out of their minds as the proof and the evidence is everywhere.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.520]  And as they've come out and told us flat out, you know, to our faces.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.320]  And I remember also, too, a couple of weeks ago, you mentioned how, you know, more people
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.960]  need to stand up and more people need to bring awareness and talk about the new world order
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.480]  and to shed the light on the people.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.760]  And I just want to say that I started my own podcast as well.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:38.200]  And if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to give that out on your show and have more people
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.200]  open their eyes.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:45.000]  It's DistortedReality.podbean.com, and I'm doing the very best that I can locally here
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.480]  in Las Vegas to spread out the word on the new world order, on the chair.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480]  Sure.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.240]  Listen, I think it's good that you're doing that and always let people plug their shows
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.440]  here because my goal is to do that.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:04:04.920]  But if we all just plug on my show, it only then basically communicates within the choir.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:11.040]  It is important to go out and proselytize critical thinking, historical research, being
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.440]  aware of how things really work.
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.640]  Really, it's not being a chump and being street smart.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.200]  People need to be street smart.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.720]  That's what this show is really about, not being chumps, understanding how the world
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:25.720]  really works, getting informed about our number one enemy, the globalist, that are staging
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:28.240]  events and provocaturing events to take our liberties.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.480]  You need to go to churches.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.520]  You need to get on the radio locally.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.480]  You need to start with an access TV show to point people at your alternative media system
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:42.680]  to grow that so that everybody's reaching people outside of who we've already woken
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.680]  up.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.680]  But God bless you.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.680]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:52.560]  Yeah, this broadcast is reaching conservatively now 15 million people a week, one way or another.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:58.640]  And last week, it was more like, let's not exaggerate, 50 million people.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:04.560]  We've had like 10 million extra YouTube views just on our YouTube channel.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.600]  Info Wars has probably gotten 30 million extra visitors.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.760]  I had tried everything.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.080]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.280]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:19.800]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:25.480]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.480]  and be satisfied.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:31.000]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at InfoWarsTeam.com, but I want to point out
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.600]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:43.440]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound, when I started taking the
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:48.960]  Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.400]  Now that's results.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:56.160]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.160]  their products.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:03.200]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:08.880]  Start your journey to health and wellness today, InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.560]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.600]  immunity and health.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:20.200]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.360]  silver-based products.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:28.040]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce nano-silver solutions, our 2-ounce
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:33.440]  nano-silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.440]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:42.080]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.400]  leave the silver at the surface.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.880]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:54.080]  of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.600]  effectively.

[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.960]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:17.080]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:21.760]  alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:25.640]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.040]  The fact is, you are.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.240]  We all are.
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.720]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:35.520]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:39.280]  the cost and availability of your food supply with e-foods direct.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.720]  Be prepared before you need it.

[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.520]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.680]  elix.

[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:18.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  You want answers?
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.240]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:33.720]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:37.440]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.240]  That's what the globalists want us to be.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:48.280]  We are not land of the cowards, home of the slaves, planet of the trendies, creation of
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.880]  the stupids.
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:54.000]  But you've got Bomb Threat USA, as Drudge Report calls it.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.920]  Alabama, three hospitals, Connecticut, courthouse, Pennsylvania shopping village, Iowa neighborhood,
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:05.920]  Florida office building, man-wearing camo shirt shuts down Philly Visitor Center.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.120]  Camo has completely been in for two years.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.440]  It just goes on and on.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.640]  Drone industry invokes Boston bombings in PR pitch.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.920]  Oh, yeah, billions in drones, billions in robots, billions in checkpoints, billions
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.760]  in armored vehicles.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.800]  That's the type of stuff we have up at infowars.com, prisonpana.com, and I'm also covering what's
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.840]  at drudgereport.com.
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:34.320]  Meanwhile, World Net Daily reports Americans are snapping by the millions.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:42.080]  I've been telling you this, road raging, fighting, divorce is way up, suicide is way up.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:47.840]  Yeah, you put 20% of the population on suicide pills, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.120]  anti-psychotics and other anti-depressants.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.520]  They cause you statistically to commit suicide and mass murder.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:59.960]  But the answer is more people on drugs, roughly 20% again of the U.S. military has come out
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:07.160]  as on these drugs while in combat, oh, that's a good idea.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:12.320]  Saudi national question after Boston bombing was on terror watch list.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.320]  That's right.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.440]  That's the big breaking news, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:22.800]  The Saudi was on a terror watch list and reportedly had six members of his family in Saudi Arabia
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.440]  on the Saudi Arabian terror watch list.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:33.720]  And we broke that first here in the United States of America.
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:42.720]  I broke that Saturday on infowars.com and I broke it Sunday with a video that I put up
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:46.640]  and now it is at townhall.com.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:51.440]  That is the big Glenn Beck news was that he was on a watch list and again, that was in
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:57.800]  the foreign press Friday, I didn't find it till Saturday.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.200]  Homeland security was dragging its feet over Tamerlan's U.S. citizenship application.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:06.480]  Yeah, I bet they were.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:11.320]  And now the Cato Institute, the neocon libertarian group, is spinning the bombing seeing it's
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:19.120]  the reason to legalize illegals because they didn't come across illegally.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:23.920]  The Americans are committing suicide and society is falling apart because we are in a deep
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.320]  depression and people basically have television sickness because all the general public does
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.640]  is watch eight hours of TV a day.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.840]  Young people, it's even more.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.640]  The average adult is like five and a half, six hours, but that's what they put on surveys.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:45.600]  Some surveys show young people watch as much as 14 hours of TV and video games a day.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.000]  And so right now they're having the perception of terrorist everywhere.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.600]  I'm going to tell you again, we called there to be a big public terrorist event in this
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.600]  country.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.840]  They tried to blame on the Tea Party.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:59.120]  Then they said they had someone arrested from the right wing.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.040]  They were going to roll them out, the MSNBC and CNN celebrated, then the photos of all
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.300]  the other patsies in the drill freaked them out.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:10.480]  So they shifted to these other patsies, I believe, who I predicted would end up being
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.080]  U.S. intelligence assets.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:15.680]  And now it turns out they had fake identification traveling in and out.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:21.600]  Mike Rogers, Tamerlin may have traveled to Russia under alias, that's Huffington Post.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.720]  And now they're saying, well, yes, he was able to get on with a fake name.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.120]  It must have been a mistake, yeah.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.240]  You try getting on a plane.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.360]  The underwear bomber was put on the plane by a U.S. agent.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:39.960]  We broke that because we had Kurt Haskell on first and he said, yeah, no, I saw a sharp
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.880]  breast man get him on the plane without a passport.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:47.720]  Later it came out in Congress, a U.S. intelligence agency's ordered the State Department to get
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:48.720]  them on the plane.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:59.400]  And the State Department had so much power that the European airport in Amsterdam, the
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.960]  Dutch airport, took the orders and put him on.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.960]  Then a firecracker went off in his pants.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.320]  So in land of the free home of the brave, oh my gosh, the scanners ordered a year before
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.080]  that we're going in the next week.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.840]  They said, we just are going to put these scanners in because of this, which they already have
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.280]  been ordered for a year.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.160]  The whole thing is scripted.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.000]  The whole thing is rolled out.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.520]  And now they said, on Wednesday and Thursday, on Thursday, here's their photos.
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.520]  We don't know who they are.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.520]  Here's the video.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.280]  We don't know who they are.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.880]  And it turns out five years ago they knew who they were, and it turns out they were following
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.880]  them.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.920]  And it turns out they'd met with them two and a half years ago.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.120]  And it turns out that the family said they were absolutely hooked in with the FBI.
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:47.040]  Well, yeah, the FBI was just running a local investigation to cover up for their intelligence
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.040]  connection.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:55.360]  Just like 777 was run by a SWAT, the MI-6 officer, and they set the patsies up and said it was
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.360]  a drill.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.960]  What did I tell you Monday before the bombs went off?
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:05.960]  I said, if anybody wants to be part of a drill, carrying a simulated explosive, don't be part
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.120]  of it.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:16.160]  I had family encounter terrorism, and of course this was a big public event at Camp Maverick.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:23.240]  And I was invited a few years ago to go see them practice taking out terrorists in a simulated
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.960]  bombing.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.280]  And I said, are you kidding?
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.200]  And they're like, come on, don't be paranoid.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.200]  It's been announced.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.200]  It's public.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:34.040]  I'm not, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:38.440]  I'm not getting anywhere near one of these drills.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.800]  And this was with a general public with a guy with a beard acting like he had a bomb
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.880]  and the helicopters come in and stop him and all this stupid stuff.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.520]  Oh, yes, keeping us safe.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.480]  Our government, just like Muhammad Karzai said, runs Taliban in al-Qaeda, and they run
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:57.280]  them in Libya and Syria, and they just gave them $123 million last Friday to al-Qaeda
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.520]  in Syria to offensively attack that government and those people and make father's suicide
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.600]  bomb or they kill their whole family.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.520]  And there are videos of men, women and children being thrown off roofs and having their heads
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.760]  chopped off.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:15.200]  God bless Rand Paul right now.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:26.120]  Yeah, he's been speaking out against the drones and everything else.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:31.480]  And Rand Paul is now urging Reed McConnell to stall immigration reform after Boston,
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:35.640]  which is amnesty.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.640]  So Rand Paul is taking action.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.360]  By the way, we're going to get Rand Paul back on.
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:42.960]  I want you guys to go after Rand Paul, because last time he just called us and said we want
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.960]  to have him on.
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.040]  I want to get him on about all this, and I want Rand Paul to please fire political
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:55.400]  torpedoes of love and get them both on the show.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:59.280]  That's a pretty silly joke I just told, isn't it?
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:04.720]  All right, anyways, man, I tell you, this is just so ridiculous.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.400]  We got Wayne Madsen, a word-winning journalist and formerly the National Security Agency
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.920]  joining us to give us his take at the bottom of the hour, and then Joel Scousen of World
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:16.400]  Affairs Brief, who day one said it has all the signs of false flag.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.840]  He's going to be on.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:28.360]  Everyone I respect, like Joel Scousen and people like, well, I mean, there's so many
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:34.040]  folks out there saying it has all the signs of false flag, but Steve Pacinic, you name
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:38.760]  it, they're saying this thing stinks to high heaven, and again, why is it always people
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.560]  being intelligence handled?
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:44.040]  Lee Harvey Oswald, Tim McVeigh, it's the same formula.
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:48.280]  Have people that are part of your operation, even if they get caught, you just say they're
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:51.480]  double agents, and that's what the Israelis are saying.
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:55.360]  Oh, these guys were sent over under fake IDs, and by the way, they said this before it was
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:00.320]  in the news, and they're obviously were to infiltrate Muslim extremist groups in the
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:05.760]  Caucasus, a Caucasus mountain region, but the Israelis didn't point out the West is
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.280]  funding the leader of that group.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:17.120]  The Chechnya bin Laden, as he's known, a billion bucks or more has been sent to these guys.
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:23.260]  Same old story like they created al-Qaeda to fight the Russians, and so a group created
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:29.160]  by our government as usual is radicalized and somehow brainwashed, and now they're saying
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:35.560]  there's a group of 12 guys in a sleeper cell that they're hunting for who help these guys,
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:39.400]  but the rest of the media is like, no, no, no, it's a lone guy, because the 12 guys are
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:43.600]  the handlers.
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:49.120]  And again, they follow an exact paradigm, an exact program, an exact operation.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:53.400]  They'll say, Alex, couldn't there be some real terror?
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.400]  Absolutely.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.240]  Absolutely, Easter bunnies may exist.
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.240]  I've never seen one.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:04.800]  I don't think they exist, but I cannot definitively prove that there are not Easter bunnies living
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:12.600]  in America.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.400]  I cannot prove that leprechauns aren't real.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.120]  I cannot prove that Santa Claus is not real.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.800]  Now look, are there in some cases in Israel real people that blow stuff up or real people
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.480]  that actually go on a bus and stab folks?
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:28.480]  Yes.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:36.160]  But nine times out of 10, the Israeli intelligence services, Haratz, Jerusalem Post have all reported,
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.960]  create fake al-Qaeda to then bomb themselves when they don't want to have a peace process
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.240]  or something.
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:47.080]  Type in Israel created fake al-Qaeda, you'll get mainstream news.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:52.560]  Type in Israel created Hamas in 1973.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:19:00.440]  Now again, I'm not saying that's how you control the opposition is you don't like Hezbollah,
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:04.960]  Iranian run, a real terror group that's really attacking you.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:11.200]  You create Hezbollah that then fights for political control and acts like terrorists
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:16.560]  to then take up all the resistance that Iran is picking up on, to then mop up everybody
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.760]  and then spy on your resistance.
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.800]  And then if you politically need to get elected or something, just blow something up and blame
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.760]  on your political enemy.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.680]  There it is, Israel faked al-Qaeda presence.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:31.040]  That's a BBC and that's a whitewash itself.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.040]  Here, here, here.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.760]  Let me just show new viewers and radio listeners.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:39.640]  Radio listeners can just search whatever I say, whatever I say, and then you can find
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.240]  it for yourself.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:52.080]  Just type in MI6 agent 77 bombings and you'll get Fox News, Democratic Underground, Infowars.com,
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:20:01.080]  BBC, Daily Mail, where the head of the bombings is and was MI6 and is protected.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.580]  And what did he do?
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:08.080]  He set up six guys with backpacks who thought they were part of a drill and blew them sky
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.080]  high.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:12.680]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:17.800]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800]  alone.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:22.400]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:26.240]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.640]  The fact is, you are.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.840]  We all are.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.320]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:36.080]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:39.800]  the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.

[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:10.520]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:15.000]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.680]  thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:24.280]  recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.480]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:30.760]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break-in with burglars usually
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:35.120]  picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:40.160]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:43.760]  TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:48.600]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.600]  ransacked.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:57.560]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5

[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.600]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:42.320]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.320]  IRAs?
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:47.400]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.080]  of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:52.560]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:57.520]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:11.200]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.200]  Box.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:15.160]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:19.960]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:24.360]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:29.880]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:34.960]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:40.080]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.240]  normal cell.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.920]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:49.000]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:56.880]  Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY or order from carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:04.280]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUS-FLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:13.960]  Protect your immune system, it's the only one you've got.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:18.360]  We're going to go back to your calls, but we know these guys were handled by the government.
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:21.960]  They were clearly allowed to travel in and out of the country with aliases.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:28.080]  This is not the FBI dropping the ball, this is the FBI covering up for the CIA and others.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:32.560]  Here's some of the articles up at infoawards.com that we're going to be talking about with
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.080]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:42.720]  Mother of Suspect says bombers, again, Mother of Suspect says bombers, Mother of Suspect
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:53.360]  bombers claims FBI called eldest son after bombing before fatal shootout.
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:57.760]  Come in with us, we're going to get you a lawyer bud, and then you see him putting
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:02.720]  him in the car naked, and the next you hear he dies in a shootout, and then his brother
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.000]  runs him over.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  Then witnesses, we have the videos and news reports up say no, they ran over him and then
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.560]  pumped him full of bullets.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:22.360]  Mother of Suspected Bombers claims FBI called eldest son after bombing before fatal shootout,
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:26.040]  and then you've got them pumping hundreds of rounds saying they were rubber bullets over
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040]  the radio.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.040]  They were not rubber bullets.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.080]  They shot holes right through the boat.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:35.680]  You've got cops lining up and then like a firing squad and trying to shoot up the vehicle,
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:43.560]  the boat, and then he climbs out and is okay, or at least can climb out, and then minutes
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:49.320]  later they're doing a tracheotomy, it looks like, and now he's sedated but talking to
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.320]  police.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.320]  Oh, that's great.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.640]  Kind of like the Aurora shooter supposedly, it was on seven psychotropics and in a DARPA
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:03.280]  program, and now they admit they drug him with sodium pentothal to admit he's guilty.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:09.640]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, that's what North Koreans do is grab you and drug you,
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:14.920]  and then, or North Vietnamese, I mean, that's mind control, but see how they just, hey,
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:21.600]  we got the bad guy, shut up, this is our city, this is Boston, everybody buys into the hype.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:29.960]  When nothing you've been told is true, ladies and gentlemen, and you've got Saudi Arabians
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:34.280]  on watch list crawling all over this, let's just ignore that, you've got the media saying
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.960]  we have somebody arrested, looks like it's going to be a right winger, and then that
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:49.720]  all gets flushed after they evacuate, evacuate, evacuate the courthouse, and you've got all
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:54.240]  these operatives and a drill, oh, and by the way, I forgot that article, it's somewhere
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:59.280]  in my stack, well you guys reprint me the article from 2008 where they had a dry run
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:07.760]  drill, a dry run drill at the Boston Marathon, Boston Globe reported, we haven't even covered
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.400]  that yet, I mentioned it yesterday, Congress exploits our fears to take our liberty, Ron
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:22.320]  Paul article up at infowars.com, the brother's aunt claims naked man in video is Tamerlin,
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:29.680]  man it shows the video, if it isn't him, it's his naked, how they call him up, hey, how
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:37.080]  the operation go, yeah, we're not sure who did it, and then boom, it's in the news, shocking
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.880]  footage Americans ordered out of homes at gunpoint by SWAT teams, well who needs due
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.600]  process, martial law's good, everybody got a big dose of it at Katrina and here now,
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:53.240]  17 unanswered questions about the Boston bombing, the media is afraid to ask, video and audio
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:28:06.560]  of firefight captured, claim Boston bombers last message on Facebook to his father, I
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:12.080]  have never done it, they set me up, the world of synthetic manufactured terrorism, that's
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:17.080]  all, what's up on the side, let's jam in a call right now, let's go to Bob in Michigan,
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:23.680]  Bob you're on the air, welcome, hello, yeah, hey Alex, thanks for the taking the phone
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:30.880]  call, you're right, I was kind of surprised, I don't listen to you all the time, but when
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:35.720]  I see something, and to be honest with you, I really didn't watch the news that much either
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:40.800]  because I know it's just a bunch of propaganda, but I did hear them talk about shooting the
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:47.880]  rubber bullets, and when this guy was in the boat, and what kills me about this is, for
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:55.840]  an average rational thinking person to sit and listen to that, where you have somebody
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:00.440]  in a boat, if anybody owns a boat, especially the size of that boat, what are rubber bullets
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:04.480]  going to do, and where are they getting the angle to hit this guy?
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.240]  No, no, they were saying it, and I heard it over the scanner to confuse the media, and
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:13.400]  this was hours after, hour and 45 minutes, if they'd already shot him up, and they watched
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:20.160]  Dean crawl around, they watched his residents there, then they say get out, and see their
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.160]  problem was the media ended up with telephoto lenses getting a shot, and you can hear the
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:28.440]  cops going, oh no, the media's got a shot, because again, they had a mission to kill
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:33.120]  him, that's why they said stay in your house, don't come out, because they had to, what
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.560]  do you think's going on here Bob?
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:44.520]  You know, what I find happening, I have a mother-in-law that's like 75 years old, and
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.640]  what I find is, what the news does, I was over at her house helping her out over the
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:54.280]  weekend, and she talks about all the stuff that's on the news, and I'm telling you, it's
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:57.880]  the old people that they really scare, but they don't hear it.
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:01.600]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:09.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:13.680]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.760]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:22.480]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons, but how will these items
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:26.160]  help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?

[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:16.520]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:22.600]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:23.600]  to the global takeover.
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:29.520]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:33.120]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:54.640]  event.

[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.520]  We're getting prepared.
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:10.800]  Are you at infowarshop.com?
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:16.920]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:43.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:48.360]  Hi, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:53.440]  We're now halfway into this Monday transmission on the 22nd day of April 2013.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:34:00.200]  We're going to be talking to Wayne Madsen of Wayne Madsen Report here in just a moment.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:05.960]  As the news comes out, it turns out the FBI had been all over these two youth for five
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:06.960]  years.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:14.080]  One of the caucuses, it appears through the CIA to infiltrate groups and that's the picture
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:20.480]  that is now emerging and that the FBI called them before and after.
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:24.960]  The bombing the mother is now saying and when you've got parents immediately saying they
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:29.640]  were set up by security services, the government was all over my kids.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:33.880]  They either let them do this or they're handling them and they thought they were part of a
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:39.160]  drill and either or or didn't plant bombs and then you've got the government in damage
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:43.400]  control with a bunch of Saudi Arabians.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:47.840]  You've got all of this going on and so we're going to be getting Wayne Madsen's take on
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:53.320]  that right now but this fits the exact same cut out we've seen over and over again.
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:57.920]  Before we go any further, don't forget that you can see infowars nightly news every night
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:04.480]  at seven o'clock central standard time as well as see the live video feed of the three-hour
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:11.280]  live radio show that you're listening to right now by subscribing to prisonplanet.tv.
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:13.480]  And why do we call it prisonplanet?
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:18.320]  Because by using these events, they are training us that when the government says everyone
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:23.380]  stay in your house, you have to or when the government says they're going to put checkpoints
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:25.240]  on the highway, you have to.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:32.080]  The great threat is tyranny, not statistically terrorism, whether it's real or not.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:36.480]  And again, 200-plus people die a year from honey bee stings, according to World Almanac,
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:38.880]  less than 50 die a year from terrorism.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:41.800]  But they hype it up like it's the end of the world.
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.240]  Same thing with mass shootings, less than 100 people die a year from mass shootings,
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:50.480]  more than half of those are gang related, less than 40 people that are actually in mass
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:55.720]  shootings that are innocents and not groups killing each other.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:00.040]  And they try to use that to then guilt all of us and make all of us suspects.
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:05.680]  And that's what this is, getting us to cheer our own servitude.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:09.560]  So now more than ever, it is essential to supportinfowars.com, spread the word about
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:10.560]  the site.

[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.200]  Way more than 11 can use it.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:38.640]  That's simultaneously that can log in, see the films, read the books, see all the documentaries,
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.200]  the expanded extras.
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:45.160]  Most of it in HD, and it can't be censored like YouTube and others are censoring us.
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.720]  At least it's harder for the system to do that.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:51.380]  So again, you're supporting the very tip of the spear in real media.

[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.640]  Here it is.
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:09.360]  And Kurt Nemo's got a big article coming out soon with a whole boil down with their
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:14.520]  intelligence connections, and that ties in with Steve Watson's article, mother of suspected
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:20.520]  bomber claims FBI called eldest son after bombing before fatal shootout.
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:26.560]  British media report claims FBI spoke with Tamerlin and said they knew he'd carried out
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:27.920]  the bombing.
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:30.440]  And that is being reported by Channel 4 News in Britain.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.440]  Yeah.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:35.320]  When the mother instantly said, intelligence services, they would not leave my son alone.
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:41.600]  And these guys are playboying around and traveling into Dijika stand and all these places and
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:44.560]  hanging out with groups funded by the CIA.
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:47.760]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:56.240]  This is absolutely incredible.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.040]  And again, you can also find that article at planetinfowars.com.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:06.880]  If you guys punch up my screen, I'll actually show viewers right here at infowars.com and
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:11.360]  you click on the top link, mother of suspected bombers claims FBI called eldest sons after
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:12.960]  bombing before fatal shootout.
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:20.120]  Now remember, the whole family, everything the family said, the family said Thursday,
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:23.280]  early Thursday morning hours, I guess it was already Friday morning.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.240]  They said that, you know, this, my son is set up.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:30.560]  Those are not arch, you know, you know, they didn't do this.
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.120]  They've been harassed for five years by the FBI.
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:38.800]  This is intelligence services setting them up.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.600]  And then it comes out for five years.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.120]  They've been doing this in two and a half years ago.
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:45.520]  They met with them again when the Russians wanted it on record that, hey, we know these
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.160]  guys work for you.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.600]  So the FBI had to act like they were doing something.
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:53.400]  And now here's the big issue.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.440]  We have the FBI when they knew full well who they were, and if we confirm they were talking
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:02.320]  to them on the phone, we've got them in the middle of the drills and all the other suspects
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:06.600]  were get Wayne Madsen's expert take on this in about one minute.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.880]  They were on the news saying we don't know who they are.
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:12.560]  Help us learn who they are.
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:17.040]  When they knew full well who they were, it's been confirmed.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:21.680]  They knew who they were and they had a press conference and said Thursday night, here they
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.000]  are.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.040]  This is the only person you look at.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.680]  And they're now in the Washington Post and a bunch of other publications saying the alternative
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:32.680]  media almost screwed up our investigation.
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:37.880]  They shouldn't have access to photos and videos from surveillance cameras or the public's info
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:38.880]  in the future.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:39.880]  Great.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:43.640]  You're going to put cameras up everywhere and still blow stuff up and blame Patsy's
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:47.280]  and then say we shouldn't have access to it because we're bad.
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:52.040]  It was citizens that found your Patsy after your lockdown was lifted.
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:56.440]  You couldn't find him to killing just like you did the brother.
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:01.640]  And so you lifted it going okay, let the slaves find it, but then the media could then move
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:05.480]  the media you'd threatened to kill so they got a bird's eye view so you couldn't finish
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.480]  the killing.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.840]  Now you're drugging him up out of his mind to confess he did it just like the so-called
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.000]  Aurora shooter.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.640]  Now Wayne Madsen has worked at the National Security Agency.
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:18.800]  Before that he was in submarine warfare.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:22.920]  And if you watch C-SPAN you always see him there in national security meetings in the
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:28.640]  press gallery and he works there in D.C. it's a lot of intel at the National Press Club.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:35.200]  I have found Wayne Madsen's intel to be so devastatingly accurate that I just don't think
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:38.360]  we blow trumpets when he comes on.
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.480]  He deserves a drum roll.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:44.640]  He travels all over the place to cover these events.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:49.760]  He has impeccable sources in a climate where they're arresting whistleblowers and media
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:54.760]  people left and right and he has a lot of courage and WayneMadsenreport.com is his website.
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:58.680]  Wayne, I don't know your take on this yet.
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:02.840]  So all of us will now get your take on it here today, but am I wrong in saying there's
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:10.080]  a cover up A and this has the classic signs of another provocateur Patsy event.
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:11.080]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:16.320]  Oh, you're absolutely right, it actually gets deeper than just what's happened over the
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.520]  last week or so.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:27.960]  You go back to 1994 when the Russians and Chechens fought this very big civil war, very
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.160]  deadly civil war.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:36.480]  The U.S. began recruiting Chechens with the idea that we would support Chechnya's independence
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:38.040]  from Russia.
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:44.160]  And things didn't go too well because many of these Chechens eventually were Wahhabi
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:52.600]  eyes by the Saudis and became these jihadists and eventually they wound up fighting us in
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:57.720]  Afghanistan and Iraq and they're fighting in Syria right now on behalf of the rebels
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.960]  who of course we're supporting.
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:03.720]  And historically, this is the one most warlock areas of the world.
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:05.720]  These people are tough as nails.
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:12.160]  Yeah, well, when things got bad after some deadly terrorist attacks by Chechen terrorists
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:21.040]  in Russia, a movie theater in Moscow, a high speed train between Moscow and St. Petersburg,
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:27.040]  Moscow airport and several others, metro stations in Moscow, the Russians really cracked down.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:33.920]  So what we started to see is the CIA started bringing over a whole bunch of refuge, political
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:40.680]  asylum to many of these people I call professional refugees, including the Sarniya family.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:49.200]  The Sarniya family, the young boy first came over here in 02, apparently got his residency
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.200]  as asylum.
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:55.400]  By the way, I'll just say it off a gut feeling, the dad looks like a classic intelligence
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:56.400]  operative.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.040]  He just screams James Bond type.
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:42:59.040]  What do you say?
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:06.520]  Yeah, and I'll get to Uncle Ruslan later when it comes to that, but the Johar got this asylum
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:07.640]  in Arlington, Virginia.
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:13.480]  Well, we know what is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, every defense and intelligence agency
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.840]  you can imagine.
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:15.840]  That was in 01.
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.120]  Then the older brother comes over.
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:23.080]  But what I've discovered is that Boston and the Washington DC area are the two centers
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:28.360]  for Chechen refugees, many of whom who got political asylum in the United States.
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:31.760]  In the case of Boston, that's a very tight knit group.
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:37.520]  One of their kind of unofficial leaders is the former quote unquote foreign minister
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:41.400]  of independent Chechnya, Ilyas Akhmedov.
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:47.560]  Now when he first applied for citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security and the
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:53.760]  Justice Department said, no, we have information that links him to terrorist attacks in Russia.
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:55.800]  So we're not going to give asylum to a terrorist.
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:57.280]  Well, who weighs in?
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:02.880]  Now you've heard over the last couple of days who's been arguing that this kid, Johar, should
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:05.640]  be tried in a military commission.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:12.360]  He should have his citizenship taken away, which was granted last year on September 11th.
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:13.800]  Who's been arguing this?
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:19.560]  But John McCain, John McCain and his good friend there, Ms. Lindsey from South Carolina.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:24.120]  Yeah, Ms. Lindsey, because they don't want this info getting out.
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.120]  Exactly.
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:28.600]  And the biggest of press evidence, you do it through a military commission.
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:34.520]  You get these guys waylaid to Gitmo, and then, you know, nobody's going to hear all
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:35.520]  the details.
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:38.680]  Well, what about the fact that the mother says, and it looks like that it is the older
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:43.240]  son, Tamron on the video, and then now the witnesses are saying they ran him over with
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:47.440]  a car and then shot him up full of holes, and then they tried to kill the other one.
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:48.920]  They want these guys dead.
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:54.480]  Well, when I saw him laying on a slab in the morgue, I could only think of Kusey and
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:45:00.280]  Uday Hussain, you know, Saddam Hussein's sons, who we laid out on a slab, and we broadcast
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:03.120]  those photos, gruesome photos around the world.
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:09.160]  But John McCain was one of the people who argued for giving political asylum to Ilias
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:13.920]  Ahmadov, this guy who had been, who the Justice Department Homeland Security said, no, they
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:16.480]  eventually overruled it.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.600]  He had a high price lawyer in New York arguing for-
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:25.340]  Just like the CIA ordered the Jetta Saudi Arabian Embassy to let the 15 hijackers back
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:29.840]  in, even though they were flagged as terrorists, they told them these guys are really CIA.
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:30.840]  Exactly.
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:36.720]  So, so we have all these Chetians coalescing around Boston and Washington, and who, who
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:38.560]  takes on the Chetchen cause?
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:46.280]  Well, every neocon who you can think of, people like James Woolsey, the former CIA director,
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:55.000]  Allen Albright, good ol' McCain, they even got Ted Kennedy because the law firm who represented
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:02.320]  this guy, Ahmadov, Sergeant Shriver, Kennedy's brother-in-law, was a partner, a senior partner.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:05.880]  Now, I understand you're giving us all the connections, bottom line, what do you think
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:06.880]  really happened here?
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:09.560]  Cause they were getting ready to blame it on the Tea Party, they said we have somebody
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:14.480]  arrested, they were going to be at the, at the courthouse, and they shut that down, they
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:15.880]  acted very panic.
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:20.800]  Don't look at these other photos the FBI said, that's word for word, only look at these.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:26.440]  Now the mother says they were calling them before and after the bombing, and then right
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:29.120]  before the fatal shootout.
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.720]  What is your inside intel on Capitol Hill?
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:37.520]  They needed another dramatic, not as big as 9-11, but they needed something to spur on
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:39.800]  the passage of this SISPA Act.
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.720]  I call this the Patriot Act for the Internet.
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:47.680]  This is going to give the law enforcement intelligence carte blanche access to everybody's
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:50.520]  interaction with anything electronic.
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:53.720]  And to plant stuff on you, more important to plant stuff on you.
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:58.680]  Yeah, and then we had the Rice and Attack instead of Anthrax, that was the same playbook
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:00.920]  stuff sent to Congress, to the White House.
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:04.040]  So it's a CIA playbook or who would you say is involved?
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:07.720]  I, you know, I can't even say it's a CIA's playbook anymore.
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:12.880]  I think it's the same people, if you look at the people that backed these Chechen refugees
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:17.720]  in Boston and D.C., it's this project for the New American Century crowd.
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:19.400]  It's a neocon operation?
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:22.480]  Neocon operation, they never went away.
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:26.240]  As a matter of fact, they're still in the Obama administration, they were consulted
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:27.240]  by the Obama administration.
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:33.400]  Yeah, I was looking, one company is set to get $10 billion off the SISPA thing spying
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:37.840]  on us, we're talking about $100 billion over the next five years spying on us.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:40.760]  So they're also going to charge us to read our mail.
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:41.760]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:45.920]  And then you got all these other little things that play like charging people who enter the
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:52.800]  United States on over land borders, a fee as they do with airports right now and seaports.
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:55.960]  So you know, there's a lot of people who have their hands out, they're looking at making
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:59.040]  some money here, contractors, DHS.
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.640]  What about the operation itself?
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:06.720]  I mean, clearly, I believe the operation, so you have these like security, private security
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:12.760]  contractors there, this Kraft International that was headed up by this guy, Kyle, who
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:19.760]  was shot back on Groundhog Day in February 2nd by his colleague, who they said suffered
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:20.760]  from PTSD.
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:23.080]  And by the way, now they're trying to claim those are National Guard, there were some
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:27.960]  National Guard dressed the same, but there are people wearing Kraft hats there as well.
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.960]  You can tell the difference between that National Guard were wearing the camouflage uniforms
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:36.800]  and the Kraft guys were wearing these khaki pants and these vests.
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:40.320]  And were they just used as well as the smoke screen?
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:44.480]  So there's so many black backpacks, cops would never be able to stop the real guys.
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:50.560]  Well, either they either the backpacks were diversionary or one of their backpacks contains
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.160]  some of the explosive devices.
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:57.880]  You know, it's hard to say, but we do know that there was a bomb drill going on.
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:59.840]  Once again, here's a drill taking place.
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:01.840]  There's always a, it's always a drill.
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:04.240]  Why do they run the exact same playbook over and over again?
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:05.240]  Cause it works.
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:06.240]  It works.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:07.240]  It works.
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:10.000]  And they already know the media, the corporate media is in their pocket and they're not going
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.600]  to ask any questions.
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:17.920]  Well, a few British papers are, you know, and I guess in Russia, some media in Russia has
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:22.520]  taken a close look at that, not accepting everything that's coming out from the corporate
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:27.040]  wires and over the corporate networks, but, but they know they can get away with it.
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:29.760]  They've gotten away with it so many times in the past.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:34.680]  Oh, you know, why, why, why fix something if it ain't broke, you know, and that's the
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:35.680]  way they're looking at it.
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.040]  So they're going to use the same thing.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.040]  They'll change it.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:43.520]  They have to change it, you know, antrax to ricin, you know, that no more build, buildings
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:49.680]  being taken down by a controlled demolitions and blaming it on airplanes.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:50.680]  Sure.
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:51.680]  Let me ask you this.
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:55.760]  Do you think it's accurate to say that this thing unraveled spectacularly?
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:00.000]  And they're now, you know, what is it the FBI doesn't want us to look at in all the
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.360]  other photos and videos that they're so scared of?
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:07.040]  Well, I think what they don't want anybody to know is that as, as being reported, you
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:14.000]  just mentioned it, that the FBI had contacts with at least the older guy, Tamerlan Sarniev.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.400]  And the other thing we got to look at Uncle Ruslan.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:21.760]  When I first saw the news crews out of Washington up in Montgomery Village, Maryland, we know
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:26.840]  that the Sarniev's father over in Dagestan apparently was an auto mechanic when he lived
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:27.840]  in Massachusetts.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:31.160]  Well, you know, he obviously didn't make a lot of money, but you look at that guy's
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:34.160]  house, Uncle Ruslan in Montgomery Village.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:37.760]  I know that area, that area, you, they're expensive homes.
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:40.000]  There's $600,000 homes up there.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.200]  The uncle, the dad, all of them come off like extremely smooth operators.
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:48.000]  Like if I saw one of those guys walking down the street, I've learned how to recognize
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  them.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.200]  They're a real intelligence operative, not one of the fake ones.
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:57.160]  And let me tell you, the dad immediately said it's intelligence services and looks mad
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:00.800]  and says, my sons have been set up and he comes off very authoritative.
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:06.280]  And they were saying this instantly because I guarantee you being connected to the Chechens
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:10.320]  and the State Department bringing them over here, these people, the whole family's probably
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:11.320]  operatives.
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:14.600]  Well, they also said that the family may have lived in Kazakhstan for a while.
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:18.360]  Now Uncle Ruslan, it turns out he's a graduate of Duke Law School.
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:22.640]  He's a lawyer, he's worked for Arthur Anderson, and he also now works, he works in the big
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:23.640]  oil business.
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:29.160]  He works for big oil, for Kazakhstan, a big producer and exporter of oil.
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:34.720]  And the company's with now is Big Sky, Big Sky Energy, and they're a holding company.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:40.280]  Oddly enough, Big Sky Corporation is out of Calgary in Canada, but the holding company
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:42.000]  is located where?
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.360]  Little Rock, Arkansas.
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:48.120]  Now that's, it rang a bell with me because I was like, wait a minute, who, who, what
[01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:53.680]  former president is in tight with the Kazakhstan government and has been accused of help covering
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:58.880]  up all the, you know, illegal bribes being paid by Western companies to the dictator
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:02.240]  over there, Mr. Nazarbayev, but, but Bill Clinton.
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:07.920]  And here we have this big energy company that does all its business in Kazakhstan, relocated
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:12.800]  its headquarters to Little Rock of all places where the Clinton Foundation is located.
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:18.360]  And the Clinton Foundation has been getting big donations from where, Kazakhstan.
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:19.360]  You know, you know.
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:20.360]  Exactly.
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.360]  So they're helping out.
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.360]  Yeah.
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:25.240]  Why does the FBI not want to go?
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:29.560]  They don't want to look any further because you know what, the FBI is law enforcement
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.240]  for the wealthy in this country.
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:32.240]  That's right.
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:33.240]  They're there.
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:36.240]  I don't even think the FBI's involved in the attack so much as, because this looks more
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:37.240]  like an intelligence op.
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:40.840]  The FBI will just get Patsies and then bust them before they do it usually unless it's
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:42.680]  the first World Trade Center attack.
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:46.480]  With these intelligence agencies, though, they'll have the multiple groups there as,
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.480]  as fallbacks.
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:52.160]  Now, what about the Saudi Arabian connection because it has been confirmed the White House
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:54.040]  is involved in a coverup.
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:58.400]  It turns out this guy's got a bunch of family on terror watch list or is this just a rabbit
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:52:59.400]  trail?
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:00.400]  Hey, it could be.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:04.520]  But look, we have to look at the Saudis because they have been very active in Chechny and
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:08.880]  radicalizing the Chechen Muslim population.
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:13.880]  And so if, if anyone may have been involved in radicalizing old Tamerlan there, it may
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:15.440]  have been these Saudi groups.
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:18.320]  So we can't let them off the hook.
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:27.120]  But we also, the other thing I want to point out here is, is that this whole Chechen operation
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:33.560]  may be an attempt also to embarrass Vladimir Putin because we know that the Russians asked
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:39.600]  us for information on Tamerlan and the FBI said, well, we asked them why, give us more
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:40.600]  information.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:41.600]  Well, Putin is not dumb enough.
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:45.320]  Well, they said, we think you may be connected to these events, but I want you to finish
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.320]  your point.
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:50.760]  But isn't that how the Russians tend to blow somebody's cover, is open a public file on
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:51.760]  them?
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:52.760]  Right.
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:55.720]  And the Russians aren't dumb enough to, you know, when, when the FBI said, well, give
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:59.280]  us more information, give us more information, they're not going to give away their sources
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:00.280]  either.
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:04.520]  So if we get their sources, the FBI, of course, is going to pursue them.
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:09.120]  Well, I looked it up, you've got a billion dollars in the last 15 years or so going into
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:13.480]  those stands to, to actually bring the Wahhabis in and train them.
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:16.560]  I mean, I mean, the problem is Saudi Arabia and the globalist.
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:21.360]  And now look at how the U.S. is using Saudi Arabia to put al-Qaeda and Libya and Syria.
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:24.720]  And I predict they're going to shoot down jet airliners with heat-sinking missiles.
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:28.120]  And then, and then take our rights when our government gave it to them.
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:33.520]  And then we had the National Secure, the Foreign Affairs Advisor to Netanyahu on stating, it's
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:38.440]  according to Harar, it's Israeli newspapers, that he said, this Boston Marathon bombing
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.440]  is good for Israel.
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:42.080]  Well, that's just like what Netanyahu said after 9-11.
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:47.040]  He said it on Fox News, this is very good for, you know, everybody, everybody's winning
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:51.840]  out with these terrorist attacks against the United States, except the American people.
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:54.080]  We are being played for chumps.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:55:01.600]  He's making a killing from Saudi Arabia to Israel to these Mujahideen rebels that are
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:04.440]  fighting in Syria and fought Qaddafi.
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:09.240]  The only people who are getting messed over here is us, because we're the ones, we're
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:14.040]  the people that are getting the legs blown off and having our kids killed in Boston and
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:15.040]  everywhere.
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:18.920]  And record suicide of the troops that nobody wants to humanize or personalize.
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:23.800]  What do you make, what do you make of Ahmed, you know, denigine the things he's up to?
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:27.280]  How does, how does Hezbollah tie into this, because we know that's a real group actually
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:28.280]  run by Iran.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:31.600]  What do you expect them to do, will the media try to blame them somehow?
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:33.080]  Yeah, they'll try.
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:34.080]  Yeah.
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:36.600]  But look, I'm a denigine, I condemn this.
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:41.560]  I did the Ayatollah, I'm an A. They condemned this, and they said, while we condemn this
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:45.000]  act of violence, you know, hey, how about looking at some of the other acts of violence
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.600]  the United States is involved in sponsoring around the world?
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:48.600]  Sure.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:52.560]  So let's shift gears now to the president of Afghanistan, Mohamed Karzai.
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.680]  It's a big deal that he came out and said the West runs al-Qaeda and Taliban and a staging
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:59.400]  bombings as a pretext for a police state.
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:00.400]  What does that signify?
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:05.040]  I wanted, he wake up and starts smelling the Afghan coffee, you know, I mean, he, he of
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:10.600]  all people should know about the art links with the al-Qaeda and the Taliban because
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:15.560]  he, when he was in exile, he was sitting there in Pakistan and here in this country and witnessing
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:16.560]  those connections.
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:21.640]  So, you know, I'm glad he's come out and said it, but you know, let's see how long
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:23.360]  he remains in power.
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:29.040]  My feeling is that Karzai is his, you know, some people's patience is wearing thin with
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:30.040]  this guy.
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:34.600]  And, you know, we do know that when the Soviets controlled Afghanistan, you know, a lot of
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:38.720]  Afghan leaders would wind up with bullets in their head and, you know, being strung
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:42.160]  up in the central square of Kabul.
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:47.600]  Let's see how long it takes for our, our guys to get around to, you know, taking care of
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.600]  Mr. Karzai.
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:50.200]  Just like I did that gentleman.
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:51.200]  Yeah.
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.200]  Exactly.
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:53.200]  Let me ask you this.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:54.200]  Yeah.
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:58.880]  Look, how long can, can the globalists openly run al-Qaeda while, I mean, publicly running
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:02.280]  al-Qaeda, like the war on drugs, publicly, they run, you know, run the drugs in, that's
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:06.880]  public, congressional hearings, studies, CIA solicitor general in 96.
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:13.680]  How long can they do this where they run the terrorists publicly and then take our liberties
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:15.920]  using the terrorists to threaten us that they run?
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:17.600]  I mean, how long can this go on?
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:19.920]  Isn't it beginning to wear thin and people know about it?
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:24.360]  Well, look, we've got to have people back in Congress like we had back in the, in the
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:27.760]  70s that had the gumption to stand up and ask these questions.
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:32.120]  You know, we had the Senator Frank Church that went after the CIA.
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:36.800]  We had Congresswoman Bella Abslogan, Congressman Otis Pike from New York.
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.880]  Both of them were from New York.
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:42.440]  We had people in Congress that asked the tough questions.
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:47.120]  And look, even, even in the case of letting these Chechens into the country, back, back
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:53.880]  when there was this opposition to letting this Okmadov and these Chechens in, two members
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:57.520]  of the Congress, of the House, voiced their objections.
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.520]  They got overruled.
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:03.040]  One was Jim Sensenbrenner, who was the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and one
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:06.600]  of his subcommittee chairs, John Hostetter, from Indiana.
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:13.440]  Now, I think we should revisit both Sensenbrenner and Hostetter and say, what possessed you
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:19.600]  to say no to giving these Chechens asylum and who, why did you say we shouldn't?
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:24.440]  Why were you supporting initially the Justice Department's refusal to let them in?
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:27.480]  And I think, I think Sensenbrenner is still around.
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:31.840]  I don't think the other guy is Hostetter, but they must have had information that led
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:35.160]  them to believe, both of them are Republicans, by the way.
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:37.600]  And this was the, this was the Bush administration.
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:39.120]  They were, you know, they were fighting.
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:40.120]  I tell you what, stay there.
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:41.120]  Do five more minutes.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:43.920]  I'm going to ask you about the elephant in the room when we come back.
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:54.440]  The most important point in this whole cover-up, you are listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com

[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:48.360]  Now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:01:13.440]  Going back to Wayne Madsen, I've been throwing a lot of points here as we cover all the bases
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:38.660]  for
[02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:43.460]  them when the FBI is saying, here are these photos, who is this, when it was well known
[02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:48.980]  to the FBI. Doesn't that prove right there? And they were Patsies. Why didn't they go
[02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:53.180]  after him day one? I think they were fallback Patsies. They were going to blame the Tea
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:54.580]  Party on this. Wayne Madsen.
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:02:02.060]  Well, I'll tell you, you know what, I'm reminded of Muhammad Atta. You know, he was seen at
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:06.180]  Maxwell Air Force Base where they knew him as Lieutenant Colonel Atta, the Egyptian Air
[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:12.140]  Force. He was involved in being a drug mule as well. He was involved with unsavory people.
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:18.220]  He was on Jack Abramoff's casino boats a couple of days before 9-11. And he was clearly working
[02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:25.820]  for our intelligence operations. So, you know, hey, Tamerlan Sarnayov meet Muhammad Atta.
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:32.820]  It's just another one of these. I think you're right. Sarnayov, the older one, was a Patsy.
[02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:37.340]  You know, I'm beginning to think the younger one, Johar, was just, you know, tagging along
[02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:41.700]  with big brother. And, you know, he had other, really he had other interests, but you know.
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:46.900]  Oh, the, he had BB guns with him. I mean, you know, I mean, this guy, this, this kid
[02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:50.820]  was just tagging along with big brother. We obviously must have looked up to.
[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:54.580]  Yeah. They wanted the big brother dead. That's who they ran over and shot the street and
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:55.580]  lied about. Yeah.
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:03:00.940]  Yeah. But the fact that the FBI, we know from the Russian government that we at least know
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:05.660]  that they were contacted. The FBI was contacted by the Russian government about this guy.
[02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:12.180]  And they, you know, they just fluffed it off. Now, why did not President Obama call Bob
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:17.900]  Mueller, the FBI director, into the Oval Office and said, you guys screwed up here. I want,
[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:22.860]  I want your letter of resignation on my desk by this afternoon, because Obama holds no
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:28.620]  one accountable. He's never held one person in his administration accountable. That's
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:30.260]  a real flaw in his leadership.
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:36.060]  I agree. Bottom line, Benghazi, uh, giving al-Qaeda 10,000 heat-taking missiles. What's
[02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:38.500]  the point of that? What's at the bottom of Benghazi?
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:44.900]  No, well, here we go again, the U S being found to support the Mujahideen. We had, you know,
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:49.220]  there were Chechens fighting in, in Libya as well. And, and now some of the Libyans are
[02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:55.620]  all fighting in Syria. We're keeping this conflict. This it's called the, um, uh, strategy
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:04:00.980]  of tension, strategy of tension, clash of civilizations. These are all neocon terms.
[02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:05.140]  We got to keep that going because there's no more, you know, communist bloc. Now there's
[02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:09.940]  this terrorist access of evil nonsense and they got to keep it alive. And I think why
[02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:14.260]  they pulled off the marathon bombing is look, they, they would start of letting people go
[02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:19.100]  on airplanes now with some, you know, pocket knives, yeah, they did this to sell a hundred
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:23.900]  billion dollars in robots and armored vehicles and, and, and train, and that was martial
[02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:28.060]  law in Boston. They're training us to accept that. Oh, by the way, the front page of the
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:33.820]  Lebanese English language newspaper, the daily start, I'm going to try to get this photo out.
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:37.660]  But there's the other day they ran a photo when they were going door to door and pulling
[02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:43.020]  people out of their homes in Watertown, Massachusetts. There is a picture of a police officer with
[02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:48.140]  a gun drawn on a lady who has her hands up as she's coming out of her home. I don't know
[02:04:48.140 --> 02:04:52.940]  if you've seen this photo. No, we have video. We have video up at info wars.com. Wayne Madsen,

[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:36.100]  Kurt Nemo's got an article that just breaks down the intelligence connections, all of it.
[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:40.900]  The family's now saying the FBI called their son after the bombing and right before he was killed
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:46.100]  that he was loaded in a car naked. That that is indeed him and then run over and then shot.
[02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:52.180]  Eyewitnesses are saying they saw that as well, ladies and gentlemen. This story is breaking
[02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:58.260]  up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Mother of suspected bombers claims FBI called eldest son
[02:08:58.260 --> 02:09:03.220]  after bombing before a fatal shootout. Congress exploits our fears to take our liberty. Ron Paul
[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:09.860]  Zarnev and claims naked man in video is Tamerlan. Shocking footage Americans order out of homes
[02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:14.420]  at gunpoint by SWAT teams. I mean, I don't know. I mean, I imagine Austin, there's a lone shooter
[02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:18.740]  out. I mean, one thing they said, we're shutting this building down. We think he's in it. They come
[02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:22.820]  to your house. They come out with your hands up to everybody. I know I'm done. This is totally
[02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:26.500]  unconstitutional. Now I'm going to go to your calls in the next segment. I promise. And then we're
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:31.540]  going to get Joel Scowles into pop in with his take. But all the experts I trust, not just me,
[02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:35.220]  are saying this is a staged event. One thing I want to plug here before we look at what they're
[02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:41.220]  trying to ram through while we're busy in the media circus that is this quasi staged event,
[02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:51.940]  bare minimum. WIWA, WIWA in Jacksonville, St. Cloud, Florida. As of today, April 22, WIWA
[02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:58.180]  in Jacksonville, St. Cloud, Florida. We'll air the Alex Jones show 24 seven via high quality
[02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:05.060]  satellite stream. And you can pick up 24 hours a day. The internet stream that they're going to
[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:14.340]  feed to XDS satellite receivers as well. The station manager is Jerry Smith. So they are and
[02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:18.340]  of course, there are some stations out there. There was one for a while in Seattle that does
[02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:22.100]  coast to coast AM 24 seven. They got high ratings with that. And we've got a lot of stations that
[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:29.140]  air us live than again at night because it just gets more and more popular. And but this is great.
[02:10:29.140 --> 02:10:36.020]  So you can find out more that guys give me their website. I'll plug that to WIWA in Jacksonville,
[02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:41.940]  Florida. And it might be good on these plug sheets. If they give me the the frequency.
[02:10:43.380 --> 02:10:48.420]  Hey, John, will you give me the frequency? I mean, I've given people the call letters, but I
[02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:52.660]  hell, I can do it. I can go to a radio locator and do it. It's like, it's like, I'll get ad copy.
[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:55.940]  I'm going to write to say, here's your ad. It just says the names like you write it. You know,
[02:10:55.940 --> 02:11:00.580]  you do everything, Jones. And people want me to come, I guess into the bathroom become groom of
[02:11:00.580 --> 02:11:08.420]  the stool or something to do all the butt wiping around here. 1160 AM. Ladies and gentlemen, excuse
[02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:13.620]  me, David, I'm a that's a good way to introduce this hour. Family show. I apologize, folks. I'm
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:19.060]  not complaining. It's all the time. It's like, they're a plug distance station. Oh, yes. Did you
[02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:29.300]  say 1630? Oh, 1160, 1160. See, because I got to get it live down my ear, you know, 1160, 1160.
[02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:35.300]  There you go. In Jacksonville, St. Cloud. Okay. Shifting gears here with a quick update and
[02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:40.020]  report on what's being rammed through with our reporter, David Knight, while we're watching
[02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:44.500]  the martial law takeover conditioning. Well, what we're looking at is a threat of imposing
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:50.580]  the Patriot Act on the internet. Now the house passed last Thursday, the SISPA Act, which has
[02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:55.380]  been around before and it was killed once before along with PIPA and SOPA and the cybersecurity
[02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:59.940]  act of 2012. All those things have been brought up. All those things were defeated. But then as it
[02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:03.860]  was going through last Thursday, it was pretty amazing what happened in the house. There were a
[02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:08.020]  lot of amendments put in to try to protect privacy. They weren't even allowed to be debated. You had
[02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:11.620]  one amendment that said that they had to get a search warrant before they looked at people's
[02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:16.500]  private papers and their internet communications, which of course would comply with the Fourth
[02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:21.460]  Amendment. That of course was not allowed to come in. But we also had the chair of the House
[02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:27.460]  Committee on Homeland Security, Mike McCall said, in the case of Boston, there were real bombs,
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:32.740]  but he said we need to arm ourselves against digital bombs that are on their way. And so
[02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:37.300]  that's what they did to try to ram this through because the other bills were, most of them were
[02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:43.540]  set up around copyright issues. But now when they say security, the Republicans are just falling
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:48.820]  in line left and right. It has not passed the Senate yet. And Obama says he's not going to sign it,
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:53.060]  but of course he said that about the NDAA, so we can't trust that. But it's been defeated in the
[02:12:53.060 --> 02:12:57.860]  past. And they're also saying because of WikiLeaks they wanted, WikiLeaks was a good thing,
[02:12:57.860 --> 02:13:02.820]  exposing their criminal activity. So they're saying, hey, we want to keep covering up our criminal
[02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:07.220]  ops. You can't talk about these efforts to try to keep the internet free without talking about
[02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:13.780]  Aaron Schwartz. Aaron Schwartz died in the middle of January. He was just 26. He was under indictment
[02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:19.140]  by this same U.S. attorney that's going to be trying these bombers in Boston. And she threw
[02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:23.220]  the book at him. Local prosecutors are just going to let him go as a misdemeanor charge. She put
[02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:29.300]  13 felony charges on him and had him looking at a 35-year sentence. She got a lot of criticism
[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:34.740]  because a lot of people said that she drove him to suicide. But I'm not so sure that he committed
[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:40.580]  suicide. Yeah, folks, when you hang yourself in a jail cell, there's a good chance you were murdered.
[02:13:40.580 --> 02:13:49.700]  Right. Well, he basically, to defend Carmen Ortiz, her husband did a tweet that said that she had
[02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:55.380]  offered him a six-month deal. And he turned it down, not that he was looking at a 35-year sentence.
[02:13:55.380 --> 02:14:00.100]  That Twitter account has subsequently been taken down, but that information got out and there were
[02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:05.300]  screenshots of it. People got that from the archives. Also, he was under indictment after
[02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:10.740]  he was still fighting these SOPA, PIPA, CISPA acts, even after he was under indictment. This guy
[02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:14.900]  was a fighter. He was not somebody that's just going to kill himself in despair. I don't believe.
[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:19.460]  Of course they murdered him. But that's what they do. Let's look at a couple of clips from him.
[02:14:19.460 --> 02:14:23.540]  The first one talks about some of the technical issues with cybersecurity. It's just about 30
[02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:30.900]  seconds. Can we go to that clip? I think it's really important that we stop cyber attacks. And
[02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:36.740]  the way to do that is to make our cyber systems more secure, to close the vulnerabilities that
[02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:41.860]  allow attackers to get it. But the problem is the government is doing the opposite. They are funding
[02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:47.060]  the creation of vulnerabilities. They are offering rewards for people to find and build vulnerabilities
[02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:51.620]  in the system and give it to the US government so then the US government can launch cyber attacks
[02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:56.900]  in other countries. Now, do you get that? He said the real problem with cybersecurity is that the
[02:14:56.900 --> 02:15:01.540]  government is creating and funding them. Our government is creating and funding them. Oh,
[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:06.260]  three years ago, Kurt Nemo wrote an article where the head of cybersecurity at the Pentagon,
[02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:10.500]  because it's already going. They're just trying to get statutory authority, said we're launching
[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:15.060]  cyber attacks. We're doing this. We're building backdoors. That's why they say the Chinese chips
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:19.460]  and our missiles and stuff is on our missiles. It's globalist missiles. Have these backdoors?
[02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:24.820]  Because that was ordered in the specs. Everything has backdoors. Absolutely. And like you said
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:28.420]  before, they basically have to tell in the same way they have to tell people when they're going
[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:33.940]  to pull something off. They also seem to, even though they directly violate the Constitution,
[02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:39.380]  they are definitely trying to get this passed as a law, even though the law is unconstitutional.
[02:15:39.380 --> 02:15:43.540]  They feel that if they can get a law passed and they can get the Supreme Court to sign off on it,
[02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:47.300]  just like Acevedo was saying about gun control, he says that it doesn't matter what the Constitution
[02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:53.540]  says or what the Constitutional Chair say. If the Congress passes a law and the Supreme Court says
[02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:57.860]  we're fine with that, that trumps the Constitution. That essentially amends or nullifies the Constitution.
[02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:01.780]  So they're really pushing on this. But the question is, what does this bill do? How does
[02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:05.860]  it violate the Fourth Amendment? Well, even though it's our own government that is funding and
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:12.580]  creating these attacks, these vulnerabilities, as Aaron Schwartz pointed out, they're using this
[02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:16.580]  to come in and get information about you from, they're going to use it to get information
[02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:19.620]  about you from Facebook and Twitter. And they're going to do it in a devious way.
[02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:24.580]  Instead of the government coming in and saying we want that information, they're going to provide
[02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:29.540]  liability protection to Facebook and Twitter and any corporation to voluntarily hand over
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:34.500]  that information to the FBI. And you know, I've been saying this since they told us in 2001,
[02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:38.900]  I was reading the minutes of the Internet 2 meeting, I think it was in London that year.
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:42.740]  They've had it in Austin and Tokyo and other places. And they said, in the future, we're
[02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:46.900]  going to shut off the old web, or we're going to phase it into Internet 2, where it's only
[02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:51.780]  institutions and big corporations, you'll have to waive your rights to be on it. And then there'll
[02:16:51.780 --> 02:16:55.700]  be no freedom because you've got to waive it to be on it, but we're going to kill the old web.
[02:16:55.700 --> 02:17:00.660]  And that's the plan. They force you onto these pretty much government creations like Zuckerberg's
[02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:05.620]  you know, where he said they're dumb efforts, he's at Bilderberg Group, Google, all this.
[02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:10.260]  And then you're on it. And then it says you have no rights. And so everything you're doing
[02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:15.780]  is spied on plus when you sign a contract to be on the cloud, everything you're doing isn't yours
[02:17:15.780 --> 02:17:20.900]  now. Well, this will also negate any privacy agreements that have been out there between
[02:17:20.900 --> 02:17:26.580]  Facebook and users or Twitter and users. Anything that's out there, any agreement to protect your
[02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:30.900]  privacy will be null and void if CISPA goes through. So it gives them liability protection.
[02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:37.140]  Exactly. And so CISPA supporters are outspending people who are opposing it by 140 to one,
[02:17:37.140 --> 02:17:42.820]  605 million to push this thing through 605 million versus only 4 million to try to stop it.
[02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:48.260]  And that's its big defense contractors coming about that up to $10 billion per company just
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:52.980]  to spy on us. Right. Well, Mike Rogers, the $10 billion figure comes from Mike Rogers' wife.
[02:17:52.980 --> 02:17:57.300]  Now, Mike Rogers is the congressman that's really spearheaded this. He introduced,
[02:17:57.300 --> 02:18:04.180]  he reintroduced CISPA one month after Aaron Schwartz died. And his wife is a former recently
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:11.140]  was the CEO and president of Aegis Incorporated. And they just got a $10 billion contract with
[02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:16.180]  the State Department. Now, Aegis... That's an offshore creep factory. Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is
[02:18:16.180 --> 02:18:21.220]  the organization that had more soldiers on the ground, private soldiers, mercenary soldiers on
[02:18:21.220 --> 02:18:25.780]  the ground than the British had troops in Iraq. Yeah. So it's a bunch of foreign
[02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:31.380]  Merck companies are taking over the web right now. Right. And Rogers' wife, who was the former
[02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:38.580]  CEO and president she just recently left, she's around doing speeches on cyber security and
[02:18:38.580 --> 02:18:43.060]  that sort of thing. So she's jumping on that bandwagon. And again, like I said, this is a
[02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:47.540]  contract going to the State Department. But let's take a look at the second clip that we've got
[02:18:47.540 --> 02:18:51.540]  from Aaron Schwartz. Can we play that clip right now? It gives us kind of an insight into what
[02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:57.060]  Congress' mindset is on this. Go ahead. I was at an event and I got introduced to a U.S. Senator,
[02:18:57.060 --> 02:19:01.700]  one of the strong proponents of the original Cueca bill. And I asked him why, despite being
[02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:05.860]  such a strong progressive, despite having just given a speech in favor of civil liberties,
[02:19:06.660 --> 02:19:12.100]  he was supporting a bill that would censor the Internet. And that typical politician's smile
[02:19:12.100 --> 02:19:17.860]  faded from his face and his eyes started burning, this fiery red. And he started shouting.
[02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:22.740]  Those people on the Internet, he yelled, they think they can get away with anything.
[02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:25.940]  They think they can just put anything up and there's nothing we can do to stop them.
[02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:31.380]  They put up everything. They put up the plans to our fighter jets and they just laugh at us.
[02:19:32.180 --> 02:19:36.740]  Well, we're going to show them. There's going to be laws on the Internet. It's got to be under
[02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:44.180]  control. Now, as far as I know, no one has ever put up the plans to U.S. fighter jets on the
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:51.700]  Internet. I mean, that's just something I've heard about. But that's sort of the point. I mean,
[02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:57.060]  it wasn't a rational concern. It was this irrational fear that things were out of control.
[02:19:57.060 --> 02:20:00.500]  All right, hit pause. Here was this man, a United States senator.
[02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:05.540]  We're going to come back and finish this clip. We're going to back it up and finish it and
[02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:12.820]  you make the points. Gold. It's like nothing else on Earth. From the Romans through the Renaissance,
[02:20:12.820 --> 02:20:18.980]  from the industrial age to the space age, gold has weathered the test of time. For 6,000 years,
[02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:23.380]  gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth. According to the World Gold Council in the U.S.
[02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:28.980]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high. The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the
[02:20:28.980 --> 02:20:35.060]  common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day. Midas Resources is

[02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:16.500]  most valuable item in a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun,
[02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:22.820]  but the correct answer will shock you. I just created a free video at crisis123.com that
[02:23:22.820 --> 02:23:29.620]  reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans don't have
[02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:34.980]  this one critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And the sad truth is that you
[02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:40.740]  may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:44.260]  But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life and death
[02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:50.820]  for you and your family. Watch my video at crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable
[02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:55.780]  item in a crisis. You'll be shocked. See the controversial video that thousands of other
[02:23:55.780 --> 02:24:01.860]  smart patrons have already seen in the last three months. Go watch my video now at crisis123.com
[02:24:01.860 --> 02:24:11.700]  before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's crisis123.com.
[02:24:11.700 --> 02:24:35.380]  All right. Going back to David Knight here with us in FullWars.com,
[02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:39.380]  Mountain News reporter. The full clip, we're going to play on the Nightly News tonight when
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:44.340]  you do another piece on this, but there's a lot of these clips. Aaron Swartz was a leader and he
[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:50.020]  was a real liberal, not one of these fake tyrants. And absolutely, the globalists are already stealing
[02:24:50.020 --> 02:24:56.980]  money left and right, $85 billion a month. All of this is happening. All of this is going on.
[02:24:56.980 --> 02:25:00.980]  They're getting away with everything, but they realize the public is finding out what liars
[02:25:00.980 --> 02:25:04.900]  they are, so they want to censor the web. But isn't the genie already out of the bottle?
[02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:09.380]  Well, people were waking up and what I was going to show from that clip was that Aaron
[02:25:09.380 --> 02:25:13.940]  Swartz kind of woke up. Here was a guy that he thought was on his side because he kind of bought
[02:25:13.940 --> 02:25:17.300]  into this left-right paradigm. It's like, oh, this guy's a good liberal, and so therefore he
[02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:22.900]  cares about civil liberties. And he was surprised to see the anger and the hatred in that guy's
[02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:26.420]  attitude when he started talking about, oh, these people on the internet, they're absolutely out
[02:25:26.420 --> 02:25:31.060]  of control. Exactly what we saw in these press conferences last week where they said, don't look
[02:25:31.060 --> 02:25:35.380]  at anything except what we give you. And we heard that again. They actually said, only look at what
[02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:39.940]  we give you. And they're in the news saying it's bad that citizens can look at photos. And we heard
[02:25:39.940 --> 02:25:45.300]  that at Sandy Hook as well. They want absolute total control of the flow of information as well
[02:25:45.300 --> 02:25:49.460]  as control over your life. The internet's meant to surveil us, not allow us to surveil them.
[02:25:49.460 --> 02:25:54.740]  Absolutely. And so he woke up to this and he said, this was not somebody weighing the
[02:25:54.740 --> 02:25:59.060]  pluses and minuses of what would be good policy as he would think from a liberal perspective.
[02:25:59.060 --> 02:26:03.940]  He said, this is the attitude of a tyrant. That's the way he ends that clip. This is the attitude
[02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:09.620]  of a tyrant. And so what we're hoping is, is that people on the left as well as people on the right
[02:26:09.620 --> 02:26:12.900]  who would not typically care about this, because a lot of times when you mention security and you
[02:26:12.900 --> 02:26:17.460]  see a lot of the same people who are fighting so hard to stop the government from taking their
[02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:21.620]  Second Amendment rights, they're not really interested in SISPA. That's not really their
[02:26:21.620 --> 02:26:25.380]  issue or civil liberties. Because they don't, they think, well, I've done nothing wrong.
[02:26:25.380 --> 02:26:30.900]  So what have they surveilled me? The governments run by foreign banks and mercenary groups.
[02:26:30.900 --> 02:26:36.180]  They want to use it to plant stuff on you, to control you. You're like, well, why is it wrong
[02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:39.620]  if they went door to door and maybe people come out with their hands up? What's wrong with that?
[02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:45.700]  If they can do that, they can condition people for the door to door gun confiscation. You know,
[02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:51.540]  you're like, well, what do I have to hide of the troops? Check my bag and look at my papers. I'm
[02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:55.700]  a good guy. What if they're on a bad mission? There's a reason we have a Bill of Rights in
[02:26:55.700 --> 02:27:00.660]  Constitution and checks and balances, because it will always be used to abuse us.
[02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:05.140]  And it's not about things like a fighter jet plan is being put out there. It's about things like
[02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:09.380]  State Department memos being leaked by WikiLeaks that show their criminal actions of what they've
[02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:13.620]  been planning. Yeah, they don't want it out with exactly. They don't want them going, we're criminals
[02:27:13.620 --> 02:27:18.500]  and murder these people and torture these people and torture their families. And we do the criminal
[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:22.900]  now, the unconstitutional later. That's right. Exactly. That's the memo that came out from
[02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:27.140]  Henry Kissinger. We do the illegal, we do immediately, the unconstitutional takes a little
[02:27:27.140 --> 02:27:31.060]  while longer. That came out in WikiLeaks. They don't want you to see that kind of stuff. So,
[02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:34.980]  that's why they want to get a gag around the internet. That's why they want to get their hands
[02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:38.740]  around the throat of the internet and stop this kind of stuff. Hey, people in the federal government,
[02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:43.780]  they had a kernel the week before 9-11, write an article in the Washington Post saying the government
[02:27:43.780 --> 02:27:49.220]  may stage a terror attack. A year before 9-11, they accidentally declassified the stacks,
[02:27:49.220 --> 02:27:54.340]  Northwoods. They're trying to warn us. There's good people in there. And look at how they're
[02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:59.540]  going after all the whistleblowers. Right. Oh, yeah. Back in North Carolina, Senator Richard Burr
[02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:06.420]  before I came out here, he put in a bill specifically to go after whistleblowers. Very harsh penalties
[02:28:06.420 --> 02:28:11.220]  for whistleblowers. They're trying to shut this down. And even if you don't have anything to hide,
[02:28:11.220 --> 02:28:15.780]  they have something to hide. And we need to know. Hey, they're calling whistleblowing. They're wanting
[02:28:15.780 --> 02:28:21.060]  to put you in jail. It's basically making everything in government classified. Yes. And then, well,
[02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:26.020]  you've seen them at cops trying to put people in jail for life if you film them in public. Right.
[02:28:26.020 --> 02:28:31.540]  The government is out of control. It's the danger. Right. And it uses these stages in one minute.
[02:28:31.540 --> 02:28:38.180]  What do you make now of the Boston stuff? Well, I just, it doesn't, the pattern of the younger
[02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:42.420]  brother just doesn't look like he's somebody that was involved in this, that he knew what was going
[02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:48.820]  on. I mean, he's tweeting as after this happened, he's going to a party Thursday night. Every,
[02:28:48.820 --> 02:28:54.340]  they went on the run after their pictures were put up, that they were being looked at. And now
[02:28:54.340 --> 02:28:58.660]  that looks like they arrested the brother and executing. Right. Right. And it didn't make
[02:28:58.660 --> 02:29:02.500]  any sense looking at the early pictures. His attitude with his cap flip back, not trying to
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:06.500]  hide his face is backpack the wrong color and everything. And now we see all this stuff about
[02:29:06.500 --> 02:29:11.460]  how they pumped the boat like full of lead, just like they did Bonnie and Clyde or something. I mean,
[02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:15.380]  you know, it's, it's, it's very suspicious. And then he gets out and is able to get out. But
[02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:20.820]  minutes later, oh, he's almost dead. He can't. Yeah, it looks like he's walking. And then exactly,
[02:29:20.820 --> 02:29:24.580]  they've got pictures of it. Looks like they walked him out of the boat. And then he's close to death.
[02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:29.460]  The next time you see him, just like the brother, it appears might have been the one who was the
[02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:33.700]  naked man in the video. And then all of a sudden he's riddled with bullets and run over and that
[02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:37.940]  sort of thing or, or, you know, turns up dead. Yeah. I mean, look at how they burned up Dorner
[02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:42.260]  and line about it. I mean, there's no telling. And again, it's the classic coverup. And again,
[02:29:42.260 --> 02:29:46.100]  folks, I've had police when I was growing up threatened to frame me for stuff. I mean,
[02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:50.420]  it's well known they do this. And boy, you look at the police in Boston. I mean, the way they're
[02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:55.140]  acting their body language saying press will kill you if you don't shut up. This is all about a
[02:29:55.140 --> 02:30:00.820]  federal globalist power grab. Your calls are coming up and we're on the March, the empires on the run.

[02:33:11.300 --> 02:33:19.460]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:19.460 --> 02:33:32.340]  All right, I'm going to jam in five or six year calls right now and then go to Joel Scowson to
[02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:35.860]  get his take on all this. We haven't had him on since the day after the event,
[02:33:36.980 --> 02:33:40.260]  but he believes it had all the telltale signs of a false flag staged event,
[02:33:40.900 --> 02:33:46.500]  self-inflicted wound. Now it's got more signs than ever. We know there was a drill.
[02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:51.140]  Well, we know they lied about that. We know they had a bunch of patsies on scene.
[02:33:51.860 --> 02:33:54.580]  As of Wednesday, they were going to go with its right-wingers,
[02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:59.460]  and they had White House people out saying, yeah, that's who it's going to be.
[02:33:59.460 --> 02:34:03.540]  Wait in the next day. There's going to be something big happen. And they flipped the script.
[02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:08.100]  It looks like set up some of their patsies who they may have actually had plant the bombs,
[02:34:09.220 --> 02:34:12.900]  which is a good lesson to you out there, like Tim McVeigh and others.
[02:34:12.900 --> 02:34:16.180]  You do not want to be part of this. They will set you up in a minute.
[02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:20.020]  McVeigh was real mad about the mission and told Terry Nichols and others about it about a week before.
[02:34:22.020 --> 02:34:24.020]  But he still went ahead with it because he was under orders.
[02:34:25.700 --> 02:34:28.820]  And you know what they did to him? Same thing with Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:34:30.420 --> 02:34:34.820]  And now it's just hands down the FBI knew who they were when they put their picture out.
[02:34:36.020 --> 02:34:39.540]  And then called him up if the mother's accurate and said, we're going to come on by and get you.
[02:34:39.540 --> 02:34:44.740]  And then they, for whatever reason,
[02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:51.780]  drugged him up or had already shot him, laid him out, ran over him and then shot him up much more.
[02:34:52.900 --> 02:34:56.740]  And then they wanted that other brother bad and they tried to kill him,
[02:34:56.740 --> 02:35:00.980]  but media had gotten their cameras on it. So they were unable after shooting hundreds of rounds into
[02:35:00.980 --> 02:35:05.700]  it when he actually got up. Oh my goodness. You know, he's unarmed with his hands up.
[02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:10.900]  Don't worry, we'll get him in the tent. Get medical personnel over here to help him out.
[02:35:11.700 --> 02:35:15.060]  But it was a little too obvious if he'd have died on the spot they made the call. Hey,
[02:35:15.060 --> 02:35:20.500]  the kid doesn't know the whole story. We'll try. Suspect charged in Boston bombing case,
[02:35:21.060 --> 02:35:25.940]  still in serious condition with gunshot wounds was arraigned in the hospital Monday on federal
[02:35:25.940 --> 02:35:31.380]  charges in connection with Boston Marathon. And he wasn't given Miranda so far and is quote,
[02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:36.420]  drugged being asked questions. You can put somebody on Halcyon and say, Hey, you committed
[02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:41.620]  murders, didn't you? Yeah, I did. And you're Superman too. Aren't you? Yeah, I am. And you're
[02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:48.980]  also a cable or else, right? Yeah, I am living that big green tree. I mean, they now drug up the
[02:35:48.980 --> 02:35:53.940]  the Aurora shooter for trial. I mean, just give me a break. I guess North Vietnam drug
[02:35:53.940 --> 02:35:59.860]  and our pilots was good then. Let's go to Julio in Illinois. Then we got our guests coming on.
[02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:07.620]  Go ahead, Julio. Oh, man, Alex, it's it's kind of comical and sad. At the same time, watching
[02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:12.820]  the narrative, this continuous narrative being thrown at us. But Big Brother and the corporate
[02:36:12.820 --> 02:36:19.220]  media, you know, if this were a movie, it would be kind of like a sick comedy because the public
[02:36:19.220 --> 02:36:24.020]  knows what's going on. Well, most of the public, I should say, and yet the big brothers throwing
[02:36:24.020 --> 02:36:29.460]  this narrative at us, they shut down a big metropolitan city like Boston for a 19 year old
[02:36:29.460 --> 02:36:37.460]  kid. I mean, it's that's a joke for them to throw this narrative at us. I remember I stood up all
[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:43.460]  night Thursday night in the Friday morning, and they said the naked guy was suspect number one,
[02:36:43.460 --> 02:36:49.620]  initial reports, and then within a half hour to an hour away. It's not him. It was just someone
[02:36:49.620 --> 02:36:54.660]  else. They wanted him naked because he had he may have had bomb residue on him. And Alex,
[02:36:54.660 --> 02:37:01.060]  quickly, I called your show you interviewed me last summer, last July after the TSA and Amtrak
[02:37:01.060 --> 02:37:05.300]  police followed me after I released the video. Yeah, they said you cannot tell them on the streets
[02:37:05.300 --> 02:37:13.060]  of Chicago. Yes, right. I mentioned a document from Homeland Security and D8 Homeland Security and
[02:37:13.060 --> 02:37:18.980]  the FBI that they did a roll call after the Aurora shootings about how they were going to be bombings
[02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:24.260]  at large gatherings. And here we are a year later. And then boom, it happens. This is
[02:37:24.260 --> 02:37:28.820]  a false flag. They tell us what happened years beforehand, just like operation of Malcolm
[02:37:28.820 --> 02:37:35.700]  Virgo two months, 10 days before 9 11, the modern picture on the document of the of an exercise
[02:37:35.700 --> 02:37:40.340]  that happened on 9 11. It's the same thing. They're telling us in advance what's going to happen.
[02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:44.900]  They tell the police to get everything ready. It happens. And oh, now we have to give up more
[02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:49.540]  right this Peter King of New York tells us or Miss Lindsay Graham. Well, yeah, I mean, that's what
[02:37:49.540 --> 02:37:54.900]  really tells you what's happening is the police think we're such animals. They now do proctology
[02:37:54.900 --> 02:38:02.020]  exams on the side of the street in Austin, Texas and other areas or the state police do on the
[02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:08.420]  highway with the same glove, multiple women for orifices just off the chart stuff. And now in
[02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:12.580]  Boston, the videos are emerging where they would just go door to door and say, come out and have
[02:38:12.580 --> 02:38:18.500]  families, you know, with their children, you name it, come out with their hands up and the cops
[02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:23.140]  would get in their face and grab on them. And I'm telling you, it's illegal. It's unlawful. It's
[02:38:23.140 --> 02:38:28.420]  martial law. And they call it security. They call it national security. And yes, you were on as a
[02:38:28.420 --> 02:38:33.460]  guest reporting for we are change with all the footage that made the news where the TSA is on
[02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:39.140]  the streets now saying you can't film them as they search people's bags and stuff without warrants.
[02:38:39.140 --> 02:38:43.140]  And it's just all part of the new government takeover where they're the new class, they're the new
[02:38:43.140 --> 02:38:47.780]  God. And it's all part of the conditioning. And this is what they train kids in public schools
[02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:53.380]  during drills to come out with their hands up. And again, even if you look, nothing like the
[02:38:53.380 --> 02:38:59.380]  people just door to door, just, just, I mean, it's so pathetic. And hey, don't worry cops.
[02:38:59.380 --> 02:39:02.420]  The globalists are doing this to take your pension funds. They're doing this goodness
[02:39:02.420 --> 02:39:07.060]  ready for the financial collapse. And through that, we're supposed to all become collectivized
[02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:10.820]  and go on food stamps and stuff. But I mean, I mean, I'm here to tell you, it's illegal.
[02:39:11.700 --> 02:39:14.980]  And if anybody would have said no, they'd have blown your house up, burned it down like
[02:39:14.980 --> 02:39:19.300]  Dorner and said, you were a terrorist. Good. That's more people for them to show off with and,
[02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:24.900]  and act like their heroes and go after your family. Now, again, a lot of police are listeners of this
[02:39:24.900 --> 02:39:30.020]  show. And a lot of departments wouldn't act like this. But Boston is a town that I don't even want
[02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:36.580]  to enter because it's so creepy. And, and, and I mean, the police look like Fred Flintstone.
[02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:41.700]  And, and, and of course, after the lockdown ended, somebody found the guy in the boat because he
[02:39:41.700 --> 02:39:46.020]  could go outside now. And of course, it was outside the lockdown. Now, Joel Scalzen writes
[02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:50.820]  for World Affairs Brief, he's the editor. Joel Scalzen, of course, you can go to his website,
[02:39:50.820 --> 02:39:56.900]  world affairs brief.com. Joel Scalzen.com will also get you there. We sell his book and I produce
[02:39:56.900 --> 02:40:02.340]  the film with him, strategic relocation, depending on which region you're in, the safer areas to be
[02:40:02.340 --> 02:40:06.100]  in. Like I live in the Hill Country right outside Austin, that he writes is the safest. Before I
[02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:09.620]  read his book, I did my own research and it shows you how accurate it is. I've been all over the
[02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:13.700]  country and it's like, how does he know all this? Well, he's worked all over the nation building
[02:40:13.700 --> 02:40:18.980]  secure homes for government and wealthy, right down to, to, to, you know, regular folks. He's
[02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:24.980]  written the best selling book, the secure home, all available at infowarstore.com. I should add.
[02:40:24.980 --> 02:40:30.980]  And Joel, you just heard Hulia, we are change reporter talking about what happened. But this
[02:40:30.980 --> 02:40:37.380]  is a great reason to get out of the city. What do you make of, of just the whole PSYOP we're seeing,
[02:40:37.380 --> 02:40:44.980]  what we now know about Tamerlan, what we now know about the family, the Russians blowing his cover
[02:40:44.980 --> 02:40:49.380]  with the FBI and saying, who is this guy? You're, you're sending into terror camps
[02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:54.740]  that are state department funded. Other aliases are coming out in the news. They were allowed to
[02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:59.860]  travel around with other aliases. Looks like more setups and you know, you kill the spy, but then
[02:40:59.860 --> 02:41:04.260]  the little brother, he'll make for good fodder. He's now charged. Joel, I don't know your take
[02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:11.460]  since we talked six days ago, the day after the bombing on Wednesday or on Tuesday. What is your
[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:18.580]  take as an expert on false flag, Joel Scousen? I think Alex, it's very clear that the two brothers
[02:41:18.580 --> 02:41:28.100]  were involved in some type of false flag training and operation. But it was clear to them that when
[02:41:28.100 --> 02:41:34.260]  they showed up and when the bombs went off and they fled, and by the way, we have video of the
[02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:40.100]  younger brother fleeing with his backpack on him. So we know that what the FBI said about him dropping
[02:41:40.100 --> 02:41:46.020]  his pack could not have been true, but that they realized that, oh, oh, something else has gone off
[02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:54.500]  and they fled. I think this is very, very typical of what happens when you, you set up a Patsy,
[02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:58.740]  you put him in charge or you put him in with another group of people and you give him a
[02:41:58.740 --> 02:42:04.340]  certain assignment to be down at the area so that they can be arrested or so that they can be filmed.
[02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:10.100]  But you have other people do the actual explosions to make sure it comes off correctly,
[02:42:10.100 --> 02:42:16.260]  not leaving it to amateurs. And so I'm very worried that we had, we do have a larger group here,
[02:42:16.260 --> 02:42:23.700]  and that larger group has to involve an agent provocateur provided by the FBI. Almost every
[02:42:23.700 --> 02:42:29.460]  single terrorist prosecution of lone individuals planning to bomb something in the United States
[02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:35.780]  and Britain have involved what the government says an FBI informant. But we know that they're
[02:42:35.780 --> 02:42:41.860]  much more informants because they admit under oath in the trials that they in fact provided the
[02:42:43.220 --> 02:42:48.260]  hype, they provided the egging them on, they provided the explosives, they provided the plans.
[02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:52.900]  They provided the leadership. They normally, in some cases, take some two years giving a money
[02:42:52.900 --> 02:42:59.780]  commanding them in the name of Allah to do this. That's right. And so I clearly think that these
[02:42:59.780 --> 02:43:05.140]  boys were involved in an operation, had gone and or at least Tamerlan had been sent back
[02:43:06.980 --> 02:43:11.780]  to the Far East in order to get training or to to move around. And that's when the Russians
[02:43:11.780 --> 02:43:18.100]  picked him up here and came back. But you know, it was obvious from their statements when they
[02:43:18.100 --> 02:43:23.620]  came back, they didn't flee. They went to a part, at least the young one went to a party. He seemed
[02:43:23.620 --> 02:43:28.580]  normal. He talked to people as if nothing had happened. He told his mother that they didn't
[02:43:28.580 --> 02:43:33.300]  do it, that he was going to be set up, though. But I think they knew that when the bomb went off
[02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:38.420]  without whatever participation they'd been briefed for, that they were going to be set up. I think
[02:43:38.420 --> 02:43:46.500]  it was interesting, though, that the police or the FBI called a couple of days after that and
[02:43:46.500 --> 02:43:53.140]  talked to them. And yet they didn't arrest them immediately. And I don't know if they wanted
[02:43:53.140 --> 02:44:01.540]  them to flee. I'm still unclear, Alex, what this MIT cop had to do or the carjacking had to do with
[02:44:01.540 --> 02:44:08.980]  this. But one thing I'm really concerned about is what new evidence appears to show that Tamerlan,
[02:44:08.980 --> 02:44:14.100]  in fact, was captured and told to strip naked motor to check in for bombs. And they put in a
[02:44:14.100 --> 02:44:20.180]  police car recognized by the aunt who said she's 100% sure that this was Tamerlan.
[02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:23.860]  Well, we've got the video, by the way, on infowars.com. In fact, I'll pull that up for
[02:44:23.860 --> 02:44:28.820]  viewers in a moment. Radio listeners can go see it. It looks like spitting image. He has a kind
[02:44:28.820 --> 02:44:35.860]  of unique bone structure to his face. And again, he was like a boxer, playboy type,
[02:44:35.860 --> 02:44:40.820]  not religious, reportedly did drugs and things. I mean, this really fits the MO, absolutely.
[02:44:40.820 --> 02:44:45.140]  And now you have witnesses saying they had his body out there and the cops ran over him and
[02:44:45.140 --> 02:44:49.300]  then filled him full of holes. Go ahead. Yeah, that's the important thing is that if he was in
[02:44:49.300 --> 02:44:56.500]  police custody, then what was he doing out there in a shootout? I believe this police chief, Mr.
[02:44:56.500 --> 02:45:03.780]  DeVoe, must have been making up a tremendous story when he talked to Wolf Blitzer on CNN,
[02:45:03.780 --> 02:45:08.100]  because everything that he talked about was false. You know, as a former military officer,
[02:45:08.100 --> 02:45:15.300]  I listened to his scenario where he's talking about these two guys approach in this SUV,
[02:45:15.300 --> 02:45:19.380]  this roadblock they've got set up, and they get out of the car and they start to have a huge
[02:45:19.380 --> 02:45:26.100]  shootout, hundreds of rounds being exchanged. Nobody apparently hit or if they're wounded,
[02:45:26.100 --> 02:45:30.180]  they're back in the car. And then all of a sudden, the older brother supposedly gets out and he
[02:45:30.180 --> 02:45:35.140]  starts walking toward them in a suicide manner, you know, shooting at them and they wound him.
[02:45:35.140 --> 02:45:41.540]  And then they say, well, our police guys went and tackled him and handcuffed him. And then the
[02:45:41.540 --> 02:45:47.140]  younger kid, you know, got in the SUV and drove towards them. But instead, we have footage that,
[02:45:47.140 --> 02:45:52.660]  I mean, not just the face, the shoulders, the bone structure, you know, the boxer body, reportedly
[02:45:52.660 --> 02:45:56.660]  that, you know, they call, they go, we're coming to get you. They strip him down, they walk him
[02:45:56.660 --> 02:46:00.740]  out, and then they have a fake firefight. And you listen to the supposed firefight,
[02:46:00.740 --> 02:46:07.700]  it sounds like one way. I mean, man, this is really bad. And here's my issue. It's so sloppy,
[02:46:07.700 --> 02:46:12.340]  Joel Scousen. They're going to be just joined as editor-in-chief at WorldofHarrisBrief.com.
[02:46:13.220 --> 02:46:17.860]  They were saying, White House officials, former White House officials, Axelrod and others,
[02:46:18.820 --> 02:46:23.220]  Tuesday night, they said, look, it's going to be lone wolf domestics by themselves.
[02:46:23.220 --> 02:46:27.140]  By Wednesday, they said, we got them some big announcement, it's going to be the Tea Party.
[02:46:27.140 --> 02:46:31.380]  They had a celebration on MSNBC, CNN, I have the clips, I've played them. They said, yeah,
[02:46:31.380 --> 02:46:35.540]  this is going to look like it's lone wolf, right wing, because they can't help but brag to themselves.
[02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:40.100]  And then something that we and others, that became the number one thing search on the web that day,
[02:46:40.900 --> 02:46:45.140]  put out, freak them out. They withdraw it. They say, okay, there hadn't been an arrest.
[02:46:45.140 --> 02:46:49.460]  They evacuate the courthouse where it's at. Army vehicles drive in, drive out. There's a panic.
[02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:55.380]  They throw all the media out. And then the next day, they release Thursday, the photos,
[02:46:55.380 --> 02:47:00.340]  and say, look at nothing else. Is this a false flag that completely blew up in their face?
[02:47:00.340 --> 02:47:02.100]  And they had to switch to a backup plan.
[02:47:04.420 --> 02:47:09.140]  Well, not knowing the complexities of this, I know that they're ad-libbing on the spot,
[02:47:09.140 --> 02:47:14.500]  and that's a lot of what they were dealing with right here. I'm convinced, first of all,
[02:47:14.500 --> 02:47:20.180]  there had to be something that the two brothers were involved in. And it had to be larger than them.
[02:47:20.180 --> 02:47:24.180]  They were given an assignment to be there. And they were watched by a federal agent,
[02:47:24.180 --> 02:47:28.500]  as you carefully pointed out on one of your videos. And they could have arrested them at
[02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:32.820]  the same time. You know, the FBI had been in contact with these people at least three years
[02:47:32.820 --> 02:47:39.300]  before, even though the FBI says only six months ago. And I think they're lying. The mother could
[02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:44.260]  not have been that far off on her timing when she said three to five years. Let's just say,
[02:47:44.260 --> 02:47:50.740]  even if it's three years at the earliest, they said, and at the time that they've been watching
[02:47:50.740 --> 02:47:54.500]  and tapping every one of their phones, they watch everything on the internet. There's no way they
[02:47:54.500 --> 02:48:00.900]  could not have known what they were planning. So this proves, Alex, that this is a false flag
[02:48:00.900 --> 02:48:04.820]  operation, meaning that they're part of a group that they know is planning. They're monitoring
[02:48:04.820 --> 02:48:10.020]  all of their emails, they're monitoring all of their internet activity. That only can mean
[02:48:10.020 --> 02:48:15.940]  that they intended this operation to go forward. But they were looking for a couple of the members
[02:48:15.940 --> 02:48:20.180]  of this group that they're going to take down as a patsy. And I don't think we're going to find
[02:48:20.180 --> 02:48:25.300]  the so-called rest of the group. And I think that's one of the reasons why they wanted both
[02:48:25.300 --> 02:48:32.260]  these brothers dead. And we may find out that, and there's a problem, of course, with Johar,
[02:48:32.260 --> 02:48:37.220]  the younger, in the sense that he does not appear to be wounded when he comes out of the boat.
[02:48:37.220 --> 02:48:41.780]  And all of a sudden they say there's a self-inflicted gun. He doesn't even have a gun in his hand,
[02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:47.540]  Alex. How could he have done a self-inflicted wound to the throat? And then five minutes later,
[02:48:47.540 --> 02:48:51.700]  from the video stills, we slowed him down one by one. It looks like they're doing a tracheotomy on
[02:48:51.700 --> 02:48:56.500]  him. So you're walking, you're walking, and now your throat's cut out. And then they said he may
[02:48:56.500 --> 02:49:02.820]  never talk again. I mean, this is so obvious. Well, we've seen a lot of history of false flag
[02:49:02.820 --> 02:49:09.220]  operations in this country. And, you know, there's a lot of them going clear back to the battleship
[02:49:09.220 --> 02:49:14.020]  main, the blowing up of the main, the Pearl Harbor is one of the best that we have evidence on. We
[02:49:14.020 --> 02:49:18.900]  have a tremendous amount of evidence on the Oklahoma City bombing that it had to be larger
[02:49:18.900 --> 02:49:23.380]  than the McVeigh bomb. It had to involve multiple bombs. That's right. Pearl Harbor was a stand-down,
[02:49:23.380 --> 02:49:30.500]  but still a false flag. That's right. And, of course, 9-11, we have tremendous information.
[02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:37.860]  I just reviewed the new video showcasing the life of Stephen Jones, who discovered the thermite and
[02:49:37.860 --> 02:49:44.340]  documented the evidence, as well as other scientists. And it is a foolproof case that the
[02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:49.620]  government used explosives in bringing down these towers. Nanothermite developed by NASA.
[02:49:50.260 --> 02:49:54.660]  That's right. And this was a brand of nanothermite. There's even more powerful than the existing
[02:49:54.660 --> 02:50:00.100]  nanothermite that they were able to get samples of. So we have a tremendous amount of information
[02:50:00.100 --> 02:50:06.260]  about these things. And frankly, after listening to police chief Darrow and others, we simply can't
[02:50:06.260 --> 02:50:11.220]  trust anything. Well, I mean, I go off my gut, too. I mean, I think that police chief comes off
[02:50:11.220 --> 02:50:16.900]  like a big fat gangster to me. Well, you know, what I was trying to say before I got interrupted
[02:50:16.900 --> 02:50:21.060]  when, you know, as a military officer listening, these guys apparently, according to police chiefs,
[02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:26.580]  throw bombs at them, had pipe bombs and had another similar big bomb that put out a big
[02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:32.500]  explosion. First of all, the tape recording don't show that any of those bombings are true.
[02:50:32.500 --> 02:50:37.380]  It's just the police word for it. And secondarily, are we to believe that they're going to come out
[02:50:37.380 --> 02:50:42.580]  of from under the cover of their cars and tackle this guy after he runs out of ammunition, knowing
[02:50:42.580 --> 02:50:49.140]  that the brother is still there in the SUV with bombs, with weapons. And they're going to come
[02:50:49.140 --> 02:50:53.300]  out of the cover and tackle this guy. It just doesn't make sense. In fact, we know that from
[02:50:53.300 --> 02:50:59.700]  another witness that in fact that never happened, that in fact it was a police SUV that ran down
[02:50:59.700 --> 02:51:04.020]  Pamela. Joel, Joel, I can tell you want to talk more. We're going to go into overdrive with you
[02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:07.700]  if you can do it. I want you to take your time to lay out all the inconsistencies. You're doing it
[02:51:07.700 --> 02:51:12.500]  very well. Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[02:51:12.500 --> 02:51:18.740]  Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[02:51:18.740 --> 02:51:23.380]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president
[02:51:23.380 --> 02:51:28.980]  could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivore capsules are used around
[02:51:28.980 --> 02:51:33.940]  the world to keep people healthy. Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age

[02:52:08.100 --> 02:52:13.700]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[02:52:13.700 --> 02:52:18.820]  and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[02:52:18.820 --> 02:52:23.220]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[02:52:23.220 --> 02:52:28.180]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is, you are. We all are.
[02:52:28.180 --> 02:52:32.980]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control Mother Nature,
[02:52:32.980 --> 02:52:38.180]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply

[02:53:11.620 --> 02:53:15.860]  your body in the shape that nature gave them if they are to be used to create new proteins in
[02:53:15.860 --> 02:53:20.580]  your body. Just like a brick layer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall,

[02:53:54.260 --> 02:53:58.980]  I weigh 182 pounds. This is my ideal weight. I've noticed an increase in stamina,
[02:53:58.980 --> 02:54:14.980]  rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency. Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[02:54:29.060 --> 02:54:39.380]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central. We're here, but we're going into an hour of
[02:54:39.380 --> 02:54:43.700]  overdrive or more to be able to get to all your patient phone calls. Michael, D.C. and Dave,
[02:54:43.700 --> 02:54:48.660]  everybody. And I will try through the week to really open the phones up. I know you guys want
[02:54:48.660 --> 02:54:53.860]  to talk. Will you guys go tell Jacari and Dave at night to get suited up and be ready to come in
[02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:58.660]  here at the bottom of the hour to do a hour of overdrive or more to get everybody's phone calls
[02:54:58.660 --> 02:55:04.100]  in? I'll be honest with you. I get on air and just get so many data points that it makes my brain
[02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:10.260]  burn because I'm frustrated to see the same thing repeating itself. And it's not my opinion that
[02:55:10.260 --> 02:55:15.940]  there's a false flag. All the signs are there. I wish this wasn't a false flag because at least
[02:55:15.940 --> 02:55:20.340]  it would just be some little group of crazies. What's scary is that they're going forward with
[02:55:20.340 --> 02:55:26.660]  this. Joel, I want to, in the next hour with you, have you really lay out all the inconsistencies that
[02:55:26.660 --> 02:55:30.740]  you with precision are breaking down? Because I have the same inconsistencies here, but I
[02:55:30.740 --> 02:55:35.460]  start hyperventilating. It gets me so upset to see this happening. But I wanted to just briefly,
[02:55:35.460 --> 02:55:41.460]  before this hour ends, ask you, what is the political reasoning of this? What is their goal?
[02:55:41.460 --> 02:55:47.300]  Obviously, it's a smoke screen. And what do you make of what I call martial law being declared?
[02:55:47.940 --> 02:55:51.300]  And I mean, let me tell you, the cops shut down a whole city and say, we're coming to your house to
[02:55:51.300 --> 02:55:56.420]  aim guns at you and your family. That's illegal. And that's a form of assault. And I've had enough
[02:55:56.420 --> 02:56:00.340]  of it. And I'm not looking for some type of physical deal. But I've had enough. Joel Scowles,
[02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:04.500]  and you're a constitutionalist. What do you say on that front? It's interesting. They never used
[02:56:04.500 --> 02:56:11.540]  the word martial law in Boston. Public safety. And it was just public safety, national security.
[02:56:11.540 --> 02:56:16.900]  And they hyped up on everybody's patriotism about this to simply lay down and let the police do
[02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:20.820]  anything that they want. Nobody was thinking about saying to the police, no, you can't come in,
[02:56:20.820 --> 02:56:25.140]  where's your warrant? Where's the probable cause? And that's what happens when you get,
[02:56:25.140 --> 02:56:29.940]  that shows the power of this conflict creation motive. Think what will happen someday when
[02:56:29.940 --> 02:56:34.660]  they have nuclear war in America. They won't have to declare martial law. They're simply going to
[02:56:35.220 --> 02:56:39.460]  start running through the streets and everyone will say, whatever you want to do, whatever it takes,
[02:56:40.020 --> 02:56:46.180]  save us from the situation. So I think it was very powerful lesson of how far we've moved
[02:56:46.180 --> 02:56:54.900]  into, you know, exceeding to America failed a big test Friday. It did indeed. It did indeed.
[02:56:56.580 --> 02:57:01.700]  Let me walk through. First of all, these big ins consist that before I answer the general
[02:57:01.700 --> 02:57:05.780]  question on where I think they're taking us for this. In the first place, it's very important
[02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:10.420]  to understand that we have forensic evidence that shows that at least one of the explosions,
[02:57:10.420 --> 02:57:17.060]  the backpack that housed that explosive was a black backpack that it had a square label on it
[02:57:17.060 --> 02:57:25.300]  and it had white strips or on the black straps that were on the pack. Neither the pack of
[02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:35.140]  Jaqar Sarnayev or his brother Tamerlan match that description. Number two, we have the video of
[02:57:35.140 --> 02:57:42.260]  Jaqar fleeing the scene after the bombing with his pack on his back. So he did not plant the
[02:57:42.260 --> 02:57:48.340]  bomb. His brother did not plant the bomb that went off. Now that means that someone else did it.
[02:57:48.340 --> 02:57:53.620]  And it's very, very suspicious. The government would point to only these two people when obviously
[02:57:53.620 --> 02:57:59.220]  someone else planted the bomb and say, whatever you do, don't look at anybody else. Very suspicious.
[02:57:59.220 --> 02:58:04.260]  That's right. I mean, they knew there's some tremendous independent research went on and it
[02:58:04.260 --> 02:58:10.820]  was especially focusing on these other private security contractors, one of which did lose
[02:58:10.820 --> 02:58:16.500]  his pack. The packs did match, in fact, the explosive profile with the square patch on the
[02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:21.300]  back. And I'm not saying it's enough conclusive evidence to say that one of those, but they were
[02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:27.940]  clearly in the area expecting some type of activity and they had moved away from where the bomb
[02:58:27.940 --> 02:58:33.540]  actually went off or in another position. And they did not react as first responders when it
[02:58:33.540 --> 02:58:38.260]  went off. Not whatsoever, except to get on their radios and telephones immediately and start to
[02:58:38.260 --> 02:58:43.060]  communicate about them. But we are left begging the question, what are these big backpacks that
[02:58:43.060 --> 02:59:04.660]  they're all wearing have on them? Stay there. Back in 60 Seconds with Joel Scalzen. I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:13.380 --> 02:59:18.500]  out of sight out of mind. And so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are we all
[02:59:18.500 --> 02:59:23.700]  are food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[02:59:23.700 --> 02:59:28.980]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply
[02:59:28.980 --> 02:59:33.620]  with e foods direct. Be prepared before you need it with nutrient dense food you can store for up
[02:59:33.620 --> 02:59:38.660]  to 25 years. You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you do what I've done and get your

[03:00:04.420 --> 03:00:17.700]  Alex Jones Broadcasting Network Network Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[03:00:18.260 --> 03:00:27.620]  you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[03:00:27.620 --> 03:00:37.300]  Texas. Alex Jones. All right we're into overdrive many stations continue to carry this broadcast
[03:00:38.340 --> 03:00:43.380]  like the folks picking up the broadcast there in Jacksonville Florida that picked up 24 hours a day
[03:00:43.380 --> 03:00:48.420]  very exciting. Joel Scousins our guest is a short segment long segment coming up and I will get to
[03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:56.020]  your calls folks that are holding. Okay we're now getting to the point of the question it's only a
[03:00:56.020 --> 03:01:02.580]  five-minute segment of what is the motive in all of this I mean it's the classic thing of letters
[03:01:02.580 --> 03:01:06.740]  being mailed out they have a mentally ill patching on that just like the anthrax as a continued cover
[03:01:07.540 --> 03:01:12.580]  you've got Syspa you've got the immigration bill you've got giving Homeland Security more power
[03:01:13.940 --> 03:01:19.300]  you've got America failing the test you know USA means being under martial law
[03:01:20.820 --> 03:01:25.300]  what else do you see happening here Joel. Joel Scousins. Well I don't once again think that
[03:01:25.300 --> 03:01:30.100]  martial law is imminent this is one of the acclimating type things there would be many more
[03:01:30.100 --> 03:01:34.820]  or even Obama said there's going to be more terrorist attacks I think the number one motive
[03:01:34.820 --> 03:01:40.740]  for this is that it had been a long time since we'd had another one of these high-profile terror
[03:01:40.740 --> 03:01:45.860]  attacks remember we don't have any normal terrorism in the United States normal terrorism would look
[03:01:45.860 --> 03:01:51.540]  like people coming across the border among the thousands of illegal aliens that come across daily
[03:01:51.540 --> 03:01:55.860]  and they'd be blowing up electrical pylons they'd be putting setting off suicide bombers in malls
[03:01:56.900 --> 03:02:02.820]  small non-high-profile things these high-profile things are always a sign that there is something
[03:02:02.820 --> 03:02:08.820]  to be gained that's why real terrorists hit train tracks that's right this is a propaganda stunt
[03:02:08.820 --> 03:02:13.540]  and you know you and I had discussed and I know I've heard you say this before and I've said it
[03:02:13.540 --> 03:02:20.100]  before my world affairs brief that they've got to have another major terrorist event in order to
[03:02:20.100 --> 03:02:24.260]  keep people believing in this war and terror there was a great deal of fatigue about it people are
[03:02:24.260 --> 03:02:29.860]  tired oh no we've been saying attacks are imminent because every TV show the dramas are all about
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:35.700]  this now you can see the scripting and so they eventually had to make a self-fulfilling prophecy
[03:02:35.700 --> 03:02:40.500]  come true and I think that was the major role of this the secondary role is that this is going to
[03:02:40.500 --> 03:02:45.780]  give a greater justification to build homeland security into the major domestic police force
[03:02:45.780 --> 03:02:50.580]  they won't need you in troops we're going to have hundreds of thousands of other you know people
[03:02:50.580 --> 03:02:56.740]  brought in to homeland security they're going to be militarized to the extent I was shocked
[03:02:56.740 --> 03:03:03.220]  at how much top military automatic weapons armored personnel carry that they brought out for this
[03:03:04.260 --> 03:03:08.820]  if they don't have this stockpiled in Boston then they brought it out from long way away no no
[03:03:08.820 --> 03:03:13.300]  no that's what I my military sources not to the even high level they're there they say there's
[03:03:13.300 --> 03:03:20.500]  caches of warrior fighting vehicles all of it everywhere for this and so this is really disturbing
[03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:26.100]  Alex that there's this much power firepower in an urban one urban area of the United States
[03:03:26.100 --> 03:03:30.900]  that was brought to bear on this so that and and the surprising thing is they didn't even have to
[03:03:30.900 --> 03:03:34.900]  declare martial law they just said everybody stay in your homes and everybody stayed in their homes
[03:03:34.900 --> 03:03:40.020]  I mean shut down everything essentially and some people disregarded it but very very few
[03:03:40.020 --> 03:03:45.540]  you let me before you continue let me just finish my train of thought before this on
[03:03:45.540 --> 03:03:51.220]  these anomalies it's very important to understand that the FBI knew where these two brothers were
[03:03:51.220 --> 03:03:56.580]  they knew where they lived they had been to their home before that is white side agents I think when
[03:03:56.580 --> 03:04:02.740]  the Russians responded and put out an interrogative with the FBI they they don't send over the dark
[03:04:02.740 --> 03:04:08.900]  side operators who were running these domestic terrorist groups they send over white side guys
[03:04:08.900 --> 03:04:12.740]  to do an interview and that's why they were so open about warning them look we've got information
[03:04:12.740 --> 03:04:17.780]  about terrorism they're watching your internet they admitted all of these things so if they were truly
[03:04:17.780 --> 03:04:22.260]  the bombers involved why would they go back to their house knowing that the FBI knew where they
[03:04:22.260 --> 03:04:29.540]  live the FBI calls them at their house they answer the phone why do you see would that happen
[03:04:29.540 --> 03:04:34.180]  why didn't they just go over and arrest them rather than call them beforehand I'll tell you what I
[03:04:34.180 --> 03:04:41.460]  think I think they wanted to flush them out and make them run so that they would have an excuse to
[03:04:41.460 --> 03:04:48.580]  kill them so that they would be dead and dead men can't talk I think that's what I recap that because
[03:04:48.580 --> 03:04:53.540]  how was the controlled media when we come back to hide all this when you've got what looks like
[03:04:53.540 --> 03:04:58.180]  him naked being put in the car his aunt says no that's him they came and got him you've got the
[03:04:58.180 --> 03:05:03.620]  brother party in the night before he's killed you know out or shot not not killed injured
[03:05:03.620 --> 03:05:11.540]  running around I mean this is unbelievably sloppy stay with us start life over spend more quality

[03:08:12.420 --> 03:08:31.060]  jones on the gcn radio network it is incredibly transparent what's happening here you've got
[03:08:31.060 --> 03:08:35.460]  the intelligence agency connections to the brothers you've got him being reportedly brought
[03:08:35.460 --> 03:08:40.020]  to the car it's him and then dad and witnesses say no they put him in the street and ran over him
[03:08:40.660 --> 03:08:46.180]  and then shot him full of holes uh i mean this is just outrageous and they tried to kill the other
[03:08:46.180 --> 03:08:50.500]  brother i was listening to the scanners live because they had him over eustream the boston police
[03:08:50.500 --> 03:08:56.180]  were like oh no the media's got him pull him back and and and they couldn't stop the media showing
[03:08:56.180 --> 03:09:02.820]  the boat they'd shot full of holes hundreds of holes looks like 30 40 yards of cops with you know
[03:09:02.820 --> 03:09:09.220]  full auto opening up on that boat trying to quote kill the suspect then they go over and he just stands
[03:09:09.220 --> 03:09:13.860]  up and now they knew the media had a live feed because this all happened like five minutes
[03:09:14.580 --> 03:09:19.460]  because the media had gotten around uh and was filming from above from a building and i was
[03:09:19.460 --> 03:09:25.060]  listening to police going the colonel says get him out of there no no hold on and you can hear
[03:09:25.060 --> 03:09:29.220]  him all trying to talk with code the average cop of course is compartmentalized as well
[03:09:29.940 --> 03:09:34.260]  and then he stands up okay he's fine he walks over minutes later oh he can't talk he may die
[03:09:35.460 --> 03:09:40.340]  they do not want him talking to people and again he's a 19-year-old kid probably being
[03:09:40.340 --> 03:09:45.940]  tagging along with his brother joel scalzen you were bringing up the point of why it's now coming
[03:09:45.940 --> 03:09:51.380]  out the mother says that they called them after the bombing and then they called him right before
[03:09:51.380 --> 03:09:58.340]  they came and arrested him uh tamerlin the older one and they ended up dead i mean uh and and now
[03:09:58.340 --> 03:10:04.100]  the witness is coming out contradicting what the police said again what this is not going well for
[03:10:04.100 --> 03:10:09.220]  them what are other points you think are important to make here well the most important point is
[03:10:09.220 --> 03:10:14.820]  there is no reason to ever telephone someone that you've already announced to the world these are
[03:10:14.820 --> 03:10:20.660]  the people that we're looking for why telephone them unless you want to flush them out i mean they
[03:10:20.660 --> 03:10:24.900]  even knew where they lived they were sitting in the residence where the FBI had been before there's
[03:10:24.900 --> 03:10:29.780]  no way that they wouldn't just show up at the door and arrest them if that was their intent
[03:10:29.780 --> 03:10:34.180]  the telephone call in my opinion was meant to flush them out so they would go on the run
[03:10:35.140 --> 03:10:40.340]  and then on the run they could run them into a police situation where they could kill them and
[03:10:40.340 --> 03:10:45.060]  that's exactly what happened though i think it got a little bit complex with the fact that they end
[03:10:45.060 --> 03:10:52.420]  up trying to hijack a car in order to get some atm money uh and they have this other suv but
[03:10:52.420 --> 03:10:56.340]  clearly i think the police have them under surveillance for the time they leave their
[03:10:56.340 --> 03:11:03.220]  house and so they're waiting for the proper time to get the the non-conspirator police
[03:11:03.220 --> 03:11:08.580]  involved and and set up and then kind of funneled into this roadblock situation of course they're
[03:11:08.580 --> 03:11:14.580]  tracking them they claim that they were tracking them by the cell phone that the hijacked uh suv
[03:11:14.580 --> 03:11:18.900]  left behind in the car but i don't believe that i think that they had them tracked from the time
[03:11:18.900 --> 03:11:24.980]  they left their uh the apartment building and intended to kill them both and that's why they've
[03:11:24.980 --> 03:11:30.820]  got i think they had to hurt the throat of the person they saw them get out they couldn't simply
[03:11:30.820 --> 03:11:36.180]  say that he was dead on arrival because people and and the media saw him walk out of that boat
[03:11:36.980 --> 03:11:43.060]  he wasn't dripping blood everywhere so i think they had to invent something else this is a really
[03:11:43.060 --> 03:11:49.140]  a sloppy operation and they're almost always sloppy but in the past there wasn't cameras
[03:11:49.140 --> 03:11:55.380]  everywhere uh to pick up every angle of this and now they're calling to censor citizen video and
[03:11:55.380 --> 03:12:00.260]  media because it quote got in the way of the investigation that's all over the news today
[03:12:00.260 --> 03:12:03.620]  when it's the opposite but you know my dad said to me last night when i went over and visited him
[03:12:03.620 --> 03:12:10.020]  and my mom for bite to eat he said he goes you know it's they're so obviously guilty when they're
[03:12:10.020 --> 03:12:14.980]  like don't look at anything else and our reporter takes over the press conference and and you know
[03:12:14.980 --> 03:12:20.740]  says we have the photos of the other people at info wars dot com we got 16 million extra visitors
[03:12:20.740 --> 03:12:28.340]  that day alone um it's got to shake up the system to know that you're out there i'm out there the
[03:12:28.340 --> 03:12:33.060]  white house says don't listen to the drudge report uh what do you make of the saudi connections as
[03:12:33.060 --> 03:12:37.700]  well because you know okay there's some saudi's there but this guy does have family on the terror
[03:12:37.700 --> 03:12:44.020]  watch list they did have the ambassador visit they are acting very suspicious uh they are ignoring all
[03:12:44.020 --> 03:12:49.460]  this other stuff i mean from studying past false flags they'll usually have five or six groups there
[03:12:49.460 --> 03:12:54.660]  like oklahoma city so they can blame whoever they want well the saudi's are an interesting case
[03:12:54.660 --> 03:13:00.900]  because you know they were very much involved in providing most of the hijackers for the uh the
[03:13:00.900 --> 03:13:06.500]  9 11 and there were hijackers there uh this was a government operation from beginning to end but
[03:13:06.500 --> 03:13:12.660]  they hired hijackers in fact i'm convinced that these hijackers got training in large aircraft
[03:13:12.660 --> 03:13:17.060]  in saudi arabia or another middle eastern country where they could get their hand where the governments
[03:13:17.060 --> 03:13:21.700]  themselves provided this training you didn't get that from flying cessnas it's just too complex
[03:13:21.700 --> 03:13:28.100]  an airplane and i say that as a pilot uh it'd be very difficult even if you just famously survived
[03:13:28.100 --> 03:13:34.260]  the aircraft to say nobody else has recently well even as a military fighter pilot myself it'd be
[03:13:34.260 --> 03:13:39.300]  very difficult for me to handle one of those large aircraft the complexity the switches and
[03:13:39.300 --> 03:13:44.500]  and you were a carrier pilot they said that's the hardest thing out there that's right so i'm not
[03:13:44.500 --> 03:13:49.620]  buying that the hijackers you know what about the maneuvers of honey honjour that nine out of ten
[03:13:49.620 --> 03:13:55.220]  pilots say they couldn't even do well personally i don't think that the hijackers were in fact
[03:13:55.220 --> 03:14:00.980]  actually flying uh the planes that ended up going into the world trade i agree um uh because
[03:14:00.980 --> 03:14:05.620]  for example the second plane that went into the world trade said how a huge modification on the
[03:14:05.620 --> 03:14:12.100]  bottom of it a bulging area which was probably fuel enhancement uh area uh in tank i think that
[03:14:12.100 --> 03:14:19.460]  they were probably under remote control at that point uh clearly the pentagon aircraft um were
[03:14:19.460 --> 03:14:24.420]  very difficult to fly and i think that there were two aircraft involved in the pentagon uh the proof
[03:14:24.420 --> 03:14:31.700]  of that is that there was a large portion of the radome of the 757 inside the pentagon and you can't
[03:14:31.700 --> 03:14:36.820]  do that if you crash at 500 miles an hour into a reinforced concrete wall there wouldn't be anything
[03:14:36.820 --> 03:14:42.580]  larger than a half inch of that radome the only reason a portion a major portion of the radome
[03:14:42.580 --> 03:14:47.700]  could get inside the building is if another smaller aircraft had launched a missile at the building
[03:14:47.700 --> 03:14:54.020]  created a hole and that it would explain the white flash at the pentagon crash which yeah
[03:14:54.020 --> 03:14:58.820]  that's as high explosive yeah and again people say that's so confusing that's how they do these
[03:14:58.820 --> 03:15:04.740]  ops so no one knows what they saw because it's so confused on purpose yeah i think there were two
[03:15:04.740 --> 03:15:09.780]  aircraft there was a larger airline and there was a smaller commuter size at which other witnesses saw
[03:15:10.500 --> 03:15:16.420]  the most important witness that i saw was the one who said that the actual airliner did not
[03:15:16.420 --> 03:15:20.820]  penetrate the building and in fact it crumpled up against the wall and he made the statement to
[03:15:20.820 --> 03:15:27.060]  himself the wall held up like a champ and then he said the the airplane exploded into a thousand
[03:15:27.060 --> 03:15:34.420]  pieces and that matches my scenario where i believe these the airline size was loaded with
[03:15:34.420 --> 03:15:40.580]  explosives and that explains why there were just confetti like size pieces all around the part
[03:15:40.580 --> 03:15:46.020]  there were thousands of pieces of aluminum everywhere so i think that one witness is the
[03:15:46.020 --> 03:15:51.140]  recording of what really happened the small aircraft put a missile in second aircraft hit
[03:15:51.140 --> 03:15:57.220]  almost simultaneously maybe a little bit later which most people saw and then exploded to destroy
[03:15:57.220 --> 03:16:03.380]  the evidence sure Joel Scalzen what do you expect to come out of all of this so far i mean if it
[03:16:03.380 --> 03:16:08.580]  hasn't gone well for them and i mean i listened to local talk radio and they're talking like i am
[03:16:08.580 --> 03:16:13.140]  almost every caller's agreeing i was swimming laps out at martin springs this weekend a group of
[03:16:13.140 --> 03:16:17.780]  military guys and their wives and they were like special ops guys you know they were in great shape
[03:16:17.780 --> 03:16:21.060]  we're talking about and they couldn't even see me you know i was sitting there with a towel in my
[03:16:21.060 --> 03:16:26.980]  head and i just got there and and i was laying out you know under a tree and they were all talking
[03:16:26.980 --> 03:16:31.940]  about oklahoma city being an inside job and how they thought this was an inside job and when i talked
[03:16:31.940 --> 03:16:36.980]  to them when they didn't even know who i was so everywhere is the buzz that this was staged
[03:16:36.980 --> 03:16:44.180]  well you know it's interesting that the majority of information comes out later and when it continues
[03:16:44.180 --> 03:16:49.220]  to point towards only things that government could do is at nine eleven you know only government
[03:16:49.220 --> 03:16:54.020]  could have loaded all those explosives in the world trade center and even if you believe that only
[03:16:54.020 --> 03:16:58.420]  world trade center seven was loaded with explosives still you've got to explain
[03:16:58.420 --> 03:17:02.820]  that the terrorists could not have done that and so the more that the government covers up the more
[03:17:02.820 --> 03:17:09.300]  that the government silences information fails to explain things the more that alerts the more
[03:17:09.300 --> 03:17:15.060]  than one third of the american people that i believe are suspicious about american involvement
[03:17:15.060 --> 03:17:20.500]  in nine eleven it alerts that third to the fact that we've got another false flag terrorist operation
[03:17:20.500 --> 03:17:26.340]  to deal with now the government has said they're looking for an additional cell of some 12 people
[03:17:26.340 --> 03:17:30.340]  that kind of give it away there's no way you'd know that there's a cell of 12 unless maybe they
[03:17:30.340 --> 03:17:38.020]  were handling that cell but uh or just throwing out a number but i'm not so sure they're going to
[03:17:38.020 --> 03:17:42.820]  find much of a cell here i think they're going to pin the blame on both of these they'll have
[03:17:42.820 --> 03:17:48.260]  another terrorist attack under their belt and americans will be very much more convinced that
[03:17:48.260 --> 03:17:53.780]  we have a real uh war on terror that now includes chechnya now i want to make one point very clear
[03:17:53.780 --> 03:17:58.820]  that mainstream media continues to put out the propaganda the yes when they're talking about
[03:17:58.820 --> 03:18:03.460]  russia assisting the fbi in this investigation how russia has been the victim of chechnya
[03:18:03.460 --> 03:18:10.500]  terrorism as well this is absolutely untrue is that almost all of the chechnya terrorism or
[03:18:10.500 --> 03:18:14.900]  terrorism in russia the apartment buildings the breslin bombings of the school that was
[03:18:14.900 --> 03:18:19.540]  put in to get reelected they were blamed on chechens were in fact carried out by russian
[03:18:19.540 --> 03:18:25.700]  speakers not chechens uh the hotel bombings in them the apartment bombings were all done
[03:18:25.700 --> 03:18:30.340]  well it even came out on the bslaan shooting which is an example of school shootings the local
[03:18:30.340 --> 03:18:35.860]  witnesses all saw the military run out the back then they opened fire and blew the school up
[03:18:35.860 --> 03:18:42.260]  killing even more kids to wipe out the two patsies they left inside the the uh the theater siege
[03:18:42.260 --> 03:18:49.780]  is a model of false flag it is indeed and the the the chechens and the the russians have been running
[03:18:49.780 --> 03:18:55.060]  the chechens is their false flag operations just like we've been running the middle eastern muslims
[03:18:55.060 --> 03:18:59.220]  as our false flag operations in this country now they're kind of merging the two they're making it
[03:18:59.220 --> 03:19:05.540]  a worldwide war on terror this may have some other ramification in terms of bringing in more of this
[03:19:05.540 --> 03:19:11.300]  false propaganda that russia is our ally in the world on terror in the war on terror they're still
[03:19:11.300 --> 03:19:17.300]  planning a disarmament uh treaty another one yet again on russia even though they have yet to comply
[03:19:17.300 --> 03:19:23.300]  with the last new start treaty it seems like our government is just insisting on proving to the
[03:19:23.300 --> 03:19:27.300]  american people the russians are our friends that there's no threat there that we're fighting a
[03:19:27.300 --> 03:19:33.060]  common terror enemy and this downplays the real threat which is russian china building weapons
[03:19:33.060 --> 03:19:38.580]  of mass destruction fully intending to strike the west someday when they're ready sure and i think
[03:19:38.580 --> 03:19:44.740]  still that we're the economic collapse is not our major issue i think the powers that he can
[03:19:44.740 --> 03:19:51.140]  keep this going longer than we think but i think it's this mother of all terrorism a nuclear war on
[03:19:51.140 --> 03:19:56.260]  America that will someday be the biggest thing that will trigger not only martial law but a new
[03:19:56.260 --> 03:20:02.500]  world order all of the things that you've been predicting can be easily implemented under a
[03:20:02.500 --> 03:20:08.420]  nuclear attack scenario sure and they're creating under it all the foundation to launch it all uh
[03:20:08.420 --> 03:20:15.060]  once they have the proper uh uh trigger but i mean this is unprecedented we've had thousands of
[03:20:15.060 --> 03:20:19.620]  cases of lone gunmen that have shot or killed people before running around the loose and you
[03:20:19.620 --> 03:20:25.380]  don't shut down most of the whole city and then a surrounding uh another town by the city and it's
[03:20:25.380 --> 03:20:31.780]  just outrageous the test america failed uh going along with this and the cops having families come
[03:20:31.780 --> 03:20:36.420]  up with their hands up and then like grabbing women and shaking them and just you know like just
[03:20:36.420 --> 03:20:43.140]  crazy uh what is the mindset of these police i mean obviously the average cop does not know
[03:20:43.140 --> 03:20:48.740]  they're staging this stuff uh how have they gotten the cops to to behave like this well you remember
[03:20:48.740 --> 03:20:53.140]  that they're they're training cops uh first of all there's a whole bunch of police been involved
[03:20:53.140 --> 03:20:57.860]  in SWAT team operations we're trained to have this militaristic response to everything they
[03:20:57.860 --> 03:21:03.140]  use them regularly a lot of the police around them are watching and looking and admiring wonder
[03:21:03.140 --> 03:21:08.340]  when i can be a SWAT and so there's this mindset within police now that we want to emulate what
[03:21:08.340 --> 03:21:14.980]  the top brand police are doing as a SWAT team and when you had this kind of pseudo patriotism
[03:21:14.980 --> 03:21:21.700]  involved with this boston marathon bomb everybody got hyped up and do acting this way and we saw
[03:21:21.700 --> 03:21:29.700]  it play out and so i'm really worried alex that we've got um a growing atmosphere which allows
[03:21:29.700 --> 03:21:34.820]  a thuggish mentality to come out of policemen and feel like it's justified when you have one of these
[03:21:34.820 --> 03:21:42.420]  super patriotic um um you know terrorist attacks and that's why i say if you've got a nuclear attack
[03:21:42.420 --> 03:21:48.260]  on america someday you're going to see no holds bar everybody can be thrown in prison everybody
[03:21:48.260 --> 03:21:53.140]  can be anybody can be grabbed out of the house at will and nobody's even going to question it
[03:21:53.140 --> 03:21:59.540]  that's why it's important to understand that mentality what boston proved is that there's
[03:21:59.540 --> 03:22:05.860]  not going to be this kind of stated martial law without a major excuse it proves that with the
[03:22:05.860 --> 03:22:11.140]  proper excuse they don't even need to call martial law people just lay down and give up their rights
[03:22:11.140 --> 03:22:14.740]  well i've always said they're not going to call it martial law they're going to call it civil
[03:22:14.740 --> 03:22:20.100]  emergency public safety uh you know when police come to your house now i want to look at your guns
[03:22:20.100 --> 03:22:25.700]  and knock and talk they go it's just public safety and you know i think about what this country's
[03:22:25.700 --> 03:22:31.060]  turned into why do the powers that we want this power grid in place right now this control grid
[03:22:31.620 --> 03:22:35.220]  and it's because they are just going to incrementally dismantle this country and
[03:22:35.220 --> 03:22:40.740]  they're trying to make gun owners the enemy they're trying to put their cyber security system in place
[03:22:40.740 --> 03:22:44.420]  and of course they have that pullout saying 30 percent think you know 9 11's an inside job or
[03:22:44.420 --> 03:22:49.620]  whatever i think that was a push poll uh you know done to make it look stupid because it was next to
[03:22:49.620 --> 03:22:54.180]  do you believe reptiles drink people's blood do you believe this and that from people when you
[03:22:54.180 --> 03:23:00.420]  talk to people privately more than half the people i run into uh and i've seen some polls
[03:23:00.420 --> 03:23:05.780]  showing over half believe that they're being lied to about 9 11 most polls are around 90 percent
[03:23:05.780 --> 03:23:11.380]  believe jfk was was killed in a conspiracy so i really think this this whole police state response
[03:23:12.660 --> 03:23:19.140]  is a is a failing forward an attempt to try to overcompensate because the criminal clash
[03:23:19.140 --> 03:23:25.540]  to the kleptocratic clash knows there's an awakening to them there really is and that's
[03:23:25.540 --> 03:23:30.260]  why as we've talked about on your previous shows there is this concept we need to always be aware
[03:23:30.260 --> 03:23:36.260]  of of them baiting uh people on the right as well to try to gain as much of a livid
[03:23:36.260 --> 03:23:42.660]  expression against government so that they can turn around and use that to justify coming after
[03:23:42.660 --> 03:23:49.060]  us but still i think it takes something a major terrorist event like this or false flag terrorist
[03:23:49.060 --> 03:23:54.660]  event like this to justify what they want to do i don't think they could pull that off without
[03:23:54.660 --> 03:24:02.020]  something like this and again they've now bound patriotism to getting rid of the fourth amendment
[03:24:02.020 --> 03:24:09.220]  and having an orgy of police running around in paramilitary gear planning the flag of unconstitutional
[03:24:09.220 --> 03:24:16.820]  behavior on boston and then oh the FCC says you're allowed to cuss on tv if it's about boston now
[03:24:16.820 --> 03:24:24.100]  i mean it is just so comically obvious what they're rolling out and and uh you know you were on
[03:24:24.100 --> 03:24:28.660]  just like two weeks ago i think and i said i think a false flag's eminent you agreed because
[03:24:28.660 --> 03:24:37.220]  every cop show every drama every uh family guy you name it says the tea party will join al-qaeda
[03:24:37.220 --> 03:24:44.980]  and bomb america i mean every show every show uh that's a drama or a cop show uh does this you
[03:24:44.980 --> 03:24:49.700]  even shows about remaking houses somehow injected into it because those aren't really real folks those
[03:24:49.700 --> 03:24:58.020]  are scripted as well they're quasi fiction quasi a non-fiction reality so it's the bathing in this
[03:24:58.020 --> 03:25:03.460]  and sure it's over the top now to say the founding fathers are scum and veterans are evil but when
[03:25:03.460 --> 03:25:07.940]  they're done with a bunch of bombings blaming it on us it will merge in the mind but i agree with
[03:25:07.940 --> 03:25:11.780]  you it looks like a five-year plan or something i think we may be a little bit closer than you think
[03:25:11.780 --> 03:25:17.460]  but uh i want people to understand this is life and death that's why i work so hard and broadcast
[03:25:17.460 --> 03:25:22.500]  you know 18 hours a day some days last week with two hour sleep uh is because you know the audience
[03:25:22.500 --> 03:25:28.100]  was there we had to talk to them is that this is so real i mean you're not you know people ask me
[03:25:28.100 --> 03:25:32.420]  alice are you serious about what you're saying look at history folks it's it's happening yes i'm
[03:25:32.420 --> 03:25:37.940]  serious joel talking to the enforcers the cops but then also people that might be patsies later
[03:25:37.940 --> 03:25:42.100]  talking directly to the enforcers out there i know we think they have low IQs and stuff because
[03:25:42.100 --> 03:25:47.380]  they're chosen for that but not all of them talk to them about about the choice they have to make
[03:25:47.380 --> 03:25:54.500]  and what they can do i think it's important to actually address the minions of this well my first
[03:25:54.500 --> 03:26:00.660]  call would be to people who are not really enforcers but people who are playing along with these for
[03:26:00.660 --> 03:26:08.580]  example there's probably 50 to 75 explosives demolitions experts that load help load the world
[03:26:08.580 --> 03:26:14.020]  trade center the weekend before and previous to that when they had the drill to shut it down yeah
[03:26:14.020 --> 03:26:18.740]  that's right there there are hundreds of these people who potential whistleblowers
[03:26:18.740 --> 03:26:22.740]  we need some of those people to come out and have the courage i know that you've been threatened
[03:26:22.740 --> 03:26:27.860]  to say you know what's going to happen to your family but you can see that this nation is on the
[03:26:27.860 --> 03:26:35.380]  brink of actually being controlled by a major black operation and it's it's much bigger than the
[03:26:35.380 --> 03:26:40.980]  two political parties it's it's above our governmental level and for the sake of whatever
[03:26:40.980 --> 03:26:46.900]  patriotism that you know you've grown up with you've got to come forward and talk about these
[03:26:46.900 --> 03:26:52.340]  things i know there's a tremendous pressure alex against these people to do so but you know we've
[03:26:52.340 --> 03:26:57.860]  had some like the shooters on the grass and grassy knoll we had two of them deathbed type
[03:26:57.860 --> 03:27:04.260]  confessions who were both in prison said they worked for the mafia and the cia both interchangeably
[03:27:05.140 --> 03:27:09.060]  on special operations like this they did shoot the president from the grassy knoll
[03:27:09.060 --> 03:27:14.980]  can we hear anything from the media that's the problem e howard hunt even went public and and
[03:27:14.980 --> 03:27:19.940]  even though he lost a lawsuit that claimed it by spotlight and confirmed he was a bench warmer on
[03:27:19.940 --> 03:27:25.220]  the whole deal but with the kind of audience that you've got alex the millions that listen to you're
[03:27:25.220 --> 03:27:31.780]  a force to be reckoned with there is a way for whistleblowers to get this information out for
[03:27:31.780 --> 03:27:39.140]  example the aunt of a jocard sonara was threatened by the fbi that you will not talk to the media
[03:27:39.700 --> 03:27:46.500]  and so when uh this reporter from canada got to her and she told about the fact that the guy that
[03:27:46.500 --> 03:27:52.580]  they rode around his naked was in fact tamer land that he was in fact alive and well and in a police
[03:27:52.580 --> 03:27:58.500]  car that's being suppressed it's very important and why would the fbi tell them to shut up i mean
[03:27:58.500 --> 03:28:04.580]  that's very guilty behavior by the way anybody wants to go to hold us the tamerlands uh or the
[03:28:04.580 --> 03:28:09.140]  family of tamerland you want to get a hold of his tips and info wars dot com show tips
[03:28:09.140 --> 03:28:13.780]  and info wars dot com go ahead and finish up i'm sorry there will be more coming out of that lady
[03:28:13.780 --> 03:28:17.620]  i'll tell you and from the parents they're going to have trouble shutting this up they're going to
[03:28:17.620 --> 03:28:22.340]  try but believe me these people are mad at the u.s government and they're going to tell more about
[03:28:22.340 --> 03:28:26.980]  the truth and i think there's a lot more to find we're going to be able to cover this story probably
[03:28:26.980 --> 03:28:31.220]  for the next six months you know i know you're putting together a big world affairs brief for
[03:28:31.220 --> 03:28:34.580]  friday but you're going to give us a boil down because i have to go to press uh the next few
[03:28:34.580 --> 03:28:40.420]  days uh on the magazine the next month's issue that's going to have a whole breakdown of false
[03:28:40.420 --> 03:28:48.100]  flags and a lot more so it's very important that this hard copy of um the next month's issue have
[03:28:48.100 --> 03:28:53.780]  your boil down in it as well so you're going to get us that today and uh joel scowzen thank you
[03:28:53.780 --> 03:28:57.780]  so much we got one minute left for anything else you'd like to add i just want to let people know
[03:28:57.780 --> 03:29:03.540]  if if they want to get a copy of that special synopsis of uh this briefing they can email me at
[03:29:03.540 --> 03:29:09.380]  editor at world affairs brief dot com alex i want to applaud what you're doing i know you're taking
[03:29:09.380 --> 03:29:15.380]  a lot of flak for what's going on but that means you're effective when the orilies who are perennial
[03:29:15.380 --> 03:29:22.260]  conspiracy deniers or even glenn beck who's you know good guy considers himself a patriot but he's
[03:29:22.260 --> 03:29:27.940]  a conspiracy denier and it's a real problem you're at the forefront of this i'm at the forefront of
[03:29:27.940 --> 03:29:34.020]  this um it's got to be said it won't it's not changing political parties it's not electing
[03:29:34.020 --> 03:29:38.740]  republicans are even getting rid of a bomb and that will solve the situation it is exposing the
[03:29:38.740 --> 03:29:44.420]  fact that we have a secret combination of power that controls all the levels of power at least
[03:29:44.420 --> 03:29:48.900]  they have effective control and we've got to kill that we've got to fight against it that's right
[03:29:48.900 --> 03:29:53.620]  they're not in full control yet and candy bar the door if they get it we're in a real struggle
[03:29:53.620 --> 03:29:57.460]  thank you so much old scowls and other reporters are coming in to take your phone calls straight

[03:33:37.540 --> 03:33:44.340]  long time uh jacari how you doing any thoughts oh i'm doing fine my uh thoughts and prayers are
[03:33:44.340 --> 03:33:49.460]  still with the people of boston uh not just you know for the bombing but for the traumatic uh
[03:33:49.460 --> 03:33:53.860]  incident of you know having the the swat team's come and throw you out of your own home absolutely
[03:33:53.860 --> 03:33:59.540]  you have to shut down the city to catch one kid i mean how many drug dealers and uh car thieves violent
[03:33:59.540 --> 03:34:03.700]  car thieves are out there every day doing that thing but you have to shut down a city to catch
[03:34:03.700 --> 03:34:07.620]  one guy absolutely that's just amazing i've never seen anything like it i don't think anybody's
[03:34:07.620 --> 03:34:11.460]  seen anything like that before in america but unfortunately it looks like they're going to use
[03:34:11.460 --> 03:34:16.260]  that as a template and they're going to do that more and more we're going to see that if unless
[03:34:16.260 --> 03:34:20.580]  we stop it you know people just have to stand up and stop it you know we're talking about syspa
[03:34:20.580 --> 03:34:26.100]  that uh there's a campaign today uh anonymous other people on the on twitter are trying to
[03:34:26.100 --> 03:34:31.060]  raise awareness of this because it is very close to passing and it is what the late erin schwarz
[03:34:31.060 --> 03:34:36.580]  called the patriot act of the internet and he was really kind of a paul revere he didn't want to
[03:34:36.580 --> 03:34:41.220]  take credit for this but he woke a lot of people up but he was right in the sense that it wasn't
[03:34:41.220 --> 03:34:46.820]  anything that one person could do but he could get people upset about it and they just uh they hit
[03:34:46.820 --> 03:34:53.460]  congress with so many so much information so many um protests that that congress basically backed off
[03:34:53.460 --> 03:34:59.300]  you know if if the public is like a sleeping giant and if they stay asleep the government's
[03:34:59.300 --> 03:35:02.580]  going to come by and they're going to slowly amputate you know it's like a like diabetes or
[03:35:02.580 --> 03:35:05.140]  something you're going to lose a finger you're going to lose an arm you're going to lose a leg
[03:35:05.140 --> 03:35:10.340]  until you can't do anything anymore until you're dead uh but if we wake up they're back off we've
[03:35:10.340 --> 03:35:13.380]  seen that over and over again we saw it with the second amendment and we've got to get people who
[03:35:13.380 --> 03:35:19.380]  were fired up on the second amendment issue just as fired up on this patriot act uh for the internet
[03:35:19.380 --> 03:35:24.500]  cyspo that's going to be stopped with guys like dan bedongi i mean just one guy shut down three
[03:35:24.500 --> 03:35:30.180]  press conferences because he dared to uh desire the truth absolutely had more people like that at
[03:35:30.180 --> 03:35:35.060]  congress at senate at the the city council meetings at the whatever who will go out there and just
[03:35:35.060 --> 03:35:39.300]  make their voices known because don't assume somebody's going to do this for you don't assume
[03:35:39.300 --> 03:35:44.740]  that your neighbor is going to write your congressman or email your senator make make sure that you do
[03:35:44.740 --> 03:35:49.540]  these things yourself like i gave the example how i uh i call chuckie schumer's office when
[03:35:49.540 --> 03:35:53.780]  he compared uh private gun sellers to child pornographers i call chuckie schumer's office i
[03:35:53.780 --> 03:35:57.140]  didn't get to talk to him i had to talk to his intern but i made my voice known and that's the
[03:35:57.140 --> 03:36:01.300]  same thing people have to do on these other issues like cyspo absolutely and you know it wasn't just
[03:36:01.300 --> 03:36:05.460]  shutting down those press conferences what dan did was he made the term false flag part of the
[03:36:05.460 --> 03:36:10.180]  national dialogue on this and that's real important because people have to see these things in the
[03:36:10.180 --> 03:36:15.620]  context of what's happened before and if you go back and look on the internet at the comments that
[03:36:15.620 --> 03:36:21.460]  erin shorts made when he was talking to people about these internet uh attack these attacks on
[03:36:21.460 --> 03:36:27.780]  internet privacy it was a real awakening for him to see the attitude and the power trips of these
[03:36:27.780 --> 03:36:31.140]  congressmen but let's go to some of these calls that we've got right now i think the first one
[03:36:31.140 --> 03:36:38.100]  that we got up is uh is that uh davin arizona is that the first one we've got davie are you there
[03:36:40.180 --> 03:36:43.620]  hello dav davin arizona
[03:36:45.380 --> 03:36:50.580]  okay let's go to another one right here um we've got uh dc in west virginia
[03:36:51.700 --> 03:36:58.900]  hey what's going on there hey man this is this issue especially for somebody that's awake now
[03:36:58.900 --> 03:37:04.100]  that wasn't awake for 9-11 it's just a whole on a whole another level seeing everything that's going
[03:37:04.100 --> 03:37:10.100]  on being awake as of 9-11 happening and then waking up you know what i mean but i think a big
[03:37:10.100 --> 03:37:16.660]  thing that's being missed um not by you all but like other people is the ndaa i feel like one of
[03:37:16.660 --> 03:37:22.340]  the big agendas of this false flag is to kind of legitimize ndaa kind of the way 9-11 did the
[03:37:22.340 --> 03:37:27.540]  patriots absolutely and you saw the supporters the big supporters of ndaa and lindsay graham out
[03:37:27.540 --> 03:37:32.100]  there saying that we've got to give this guy the full gitmo treatment call him an enemy combatant
[03:37:32.100 --> 03:37:36.260]  yeah you don't get a lawyer you're an enemy combatant that's the thing that really bothered me
[03:37:36.260 --> 03:37:40.820]  with the way this thing has been handled since uh the guy's apprehension is all you see on your
[03:37:40.820 --> 03:37:45.700]  big mainstream networks is oh we don't have time to give this guy his Miranda rights we don't need
[03:37:45.700 --> 03:37:49.780]  warrants to arrest and absolutely we don't even have to show you this guy placing the bomb i mean
[03:37:49.780 --> 03:37:55.140]  you can see these guys uh walking around you know just you know fair and easy all day but you can't
[03:37:55.140 --> 03:37:58.980]  see these guys ever placing any charges down now carney did have a press conference today and he
[03:37:58.980 --> 03:38:04.820]  did say that he's going to uh that they are not that they are going to give them a regular judicial
[03:38:04.820 --> 03:38:10.260]  process that remains to be seen i guess the real question is the apprehension of these two suspects
[03:38:11.220 --> 03:38:18.180]  the fact that the ant is saying that uh this one guy was the the older brother was in fact
[03:38:18.180 --> 03:38:23.300]  the video that we have of the naked suspect being taken and then the next thing you see he's dead
[03:38:23.300 --> 03:38:28.900]  and then we see that the younger brother is hiding in the boat and the boat is just riddled with
[03:38:28.900 --> 03:38:34.980]  bullets like Bonnie and Clyde right and then he appears to be led away walking fine and the next
[03:38:34.980 --> 03:38:41.700]  thing we know he's nearly dead bleeding from the yeah yeah so there's some real questions about that
[03:38:41.700 --> 03:38:47.140]  and as alex mentioned uh there was a chatter on the police radio saying that oh no the press is
[03:38:47.140 --> 03:38:51.140]  here in other words they did not want anybody covering these but anything else you wanted to add
[03:38:51.140 --> 03:38:56.660]  yeah speaking of that boat incident i mean for one in my channel i couldn't write something better
[03:38:56.660 --> 03:39:01.380]  than this this is crazy but i don't know if you guys have seen that the internet pictures right now
[03:39:01.380 --> 03:39:07.220]  that show him kind of crawling out of the boat when they apprehended him i mean i'm curious as well
[03:39:07.220 --> 03:39:10.420]  if we could get somebody to see if that's what you're doing because i mean that's just how how are
[03:39:10.420 --> 03:39:14.420]  you going to crawl out of the boat after they've riddled with bullets for one and for two and you
[03:39:14.420 --> 03:39:19.220]  guys noticed how when it first happened they kept asking the media would ask about whether or not he
[03:39:19.220 --> 03:39:23.380]  had a gun and it kind of soon as they brought that up he kind of stumbled over what he was going to
[03:39:23.380 --> 03:39:26.900]  say and kind of wanted to end it right there like he didn't know he didn't want to talk about that stuff
[03:39:26.900 --> 03:39:31.620]  well if you remember sir the uh the big lot well i won't say the lie but the thing they were trying
[03:39:31.620 --> 03:39:37.700]  to push is the fact that he was probably armed likely armed with a explosive vest a suicide vest
[03:39:37.700 --> 03:39:41.620]  it's the thing that kept trying to push so we have to take this guy out we can't take any chances we
[03:39:41.620 --> 03:39:47.620]  don't need any warrants because he may be strapped with a suicide vest well and as joel scousen pointed
[03:39:47.620 --> 03:39:52.900]  out when we listen to the tapes you hear a tremendous amount of gunfire i and i've listened
[03:39:52.900 --> 03:39:59.540]  to the tapes that neighbors made i didn't see or hear any explosions uh so the tapes really don't
[03:39:59.540 --> 03:40:04.580]  cooperate what the fbi is saying at this point as far as there being uh explosions and bombs being
[03:40:04.580 --> 03:40:09.780]  thrown well thanks for talking to us uh we've got michael in tennessee coming up next michael you there
[03:40:09.780 --> 03:40:18.580]  hello hello michael hello can you hear us how are you today doing fine what you got uh i'm a
[03:40:18.580 --> 03:40:24.980]  planet prison uh excuse me prison planet member calling from female region four uh i've got
[03:40:24.980 --> 03:40:30.660]  charles free bumper stickers and passing them out like water i like to say use your proprio
[03:40:30.660 --> 03:40:36.980]  all et cetera anyway i've called alex about a month ago i'm the constitution bill of rights
[03:40:36.980 --> 03:40:42.900]  news sticker idea guy i think y'all should run the bill of rights as a news sticker uh at the
[03:40:42.900 --> 03:40:48.260]  bottom of your screen uh but i wanted to point out something about the constitution everybody's
[03:40:48.260 --> 03:40:53.300]  trying to mess with it and i'm going to tell you the bill of rights itself says in the first four
[03:40:53.300 --> 03:40:58.660]  articles the first letter of all of the first four articles spells out the words can't i think it
[03:40:58.660 --> 03:41:05.380]  can't be any uh plainer than that i'd also like to point out that the milestone stones to our road
[03:41:05.380 --> 03:41:12.180]  to freedom should include wonderful things like badandi's awesome non-mainstream questioning
[03:41:12.180 --> 03:41:19.460]  and all of also alex's pierce morgan takeover show um i'm going to say i think it's unusual
[03:41:19.460 --> 03:41:24.740]  that the twin towers and they originally were calling this the twin bombings and i'd just like
[03:41:24.740 --> 03:41:31.780]  to know if you think there were any videos that showed video dogs uh those uh bomb sniffing dogs
[03:41:31.780 --> 03:41:38.100]  uh that were actually alerted and then kind of asked to turn down and there are people all the time
[03:41:38.100 --> 03:41:42.660]  i'm saying a lot of stuff here but i want to get it out and you can comment but uh people say all
[03:41:42.660 --> 03:41:47.780]  the time what can i do well i in about the last two months have become extremely proactive and i've
[03:41:47.780 --> 03:41:55.620]  called on my phone 93 calls to senators and state representatives against unlawful gun controls
[03:41:55.620 --> 03:42:02.100]  and for teachers to be trained which by the way in tennessee passed and are there any websites
[03:42:02.100 --> 03:42:09.060]  that show any information about dr patenek's reporting on the obama bush clinton uh environments
[03:42:09.060 --> 03:42:13.220]  and now i'll leave it to you and that's all i wanted to ask it was pulled down it's addressing
[03:42:13.220 --> 03:42:18.420]  the uh the patenek question that was pulled down but i do believe it is on planet info wars
[03:42:18.980 --> 03:42:24.020]  and uh you can probably just uh type in the search of and i don't remember the name of the website
[03:42:24.020 --> 03:42:28.660]  but uh they did have a one hour video there a press conference and you can look at the full
[03:42:28.660 --> 03:42:34.420]  600 page report that organization and i don't have that right with me right now maybe we get that
[03:42:34.420 --> 03:42:38.420]  later but i tell you what michael i really appreciate your activism and your support
[03:42:38.420 --> 03:42:43.460]  of us but your activism with congress and one thing to put on your list you've been very active
[03:42:43.460 --> 03:42:48.900]  calling people call about syspa that is something there's a lot more republican support for it than
[03:42:48.900 --> 03:42:53.300]  there is democrat support so we still have a chance at defeating it in the senate right and
[03:42:53.300 --> 03:42:58.900]  i would get to remember that sopa and pipa and even syspa itself and its previous incarnation
[03:42:58.900 --> 03:43:05.620]  that wasn't as bad as it is right now those were all defeated even though all of the people on the
[03:43:05.620 --> 03:43:09.940]  house committee were co-sponsors of it it was pretty much a done deal when erin schwarz started
[03:43:09.940 --> 03:43:14.260]  fighting it and they brought that thing back they delayed it and they brought it you know kept
[03:43:14.260 --> 03:43:19.700]  publicizing it and resisting it until they stopped it so it can be stopped but we have to get active
[03:43:19.700 --> 03:43:24.500]  just like you've been active and in terms of the number of videos and things that are going to show
[03:43:24.500 --> 03:43:29.140]  any bomb sniffing dogs at the finish line i think we're going to see a lot of stuff continue to
[03:43:29.140 --> 03:43:36.020]  surface over the next months and years you got to remember that we just talked to mike mcnulty who
[03:43:36.020 --> 03:43:44.580]  did the uh waco rules of engagement and then waco a new revelation documentary and it took a long
[03:43:44.580 --> 03:43:49.380]  time for the information about exactly what happened at waco people knew that the official
[03:43:49.380 --> 03:43:56.980]  story was contrived false contradictory but it took a very long time to find the exact information
[03:43:56.980 --> 03:44:00.740]  and it took him a while to discover it and he actually was successful with freedom of information
[03:44:00.740 --> 03:44:05.140]  act to uncover some information that the government had never had out there before so
[03:44:05.140 --> 03:44:09.140]  i think eventually the truth is going to come out we know though from the get go that there's a lot
[03:44:09.140 --> 03:44:14.180]  of suspicious stuff here and keep in mind a lot of people have their cameras and such confiscated
[03:44:14.180 --> 03:44:18.100]  by the authorities uh when it happened they even admitted that on cnn we have to take these
[03:44:18.100 --> 03:44:22.820]  cameras because there may be information on them so uh that will make it somewhat more
[03:44:22.820 --> 03:44:27.220]  difficult but i am confident there are people who have uh even if it's just in the background they
[03:44:27.220 --> 03:44:32.900]  have the bomb sniffing dogs or whatever else going on absolutely we've got terry in washington next
[03:44:32.900 --> 03:44:39.540]  terry are you there i'm here hey how you guys done doing fine how are you what you got good
[03:44:39.540 --> 03:44:44.500]  yeah i hope i like you're still in the building because i want to hear this i think what it it
[03:44:44.500 --> 03:44:51.300]  sucks that for anybody that doesn't belong to prison planet dot tv because i i watched this unfold
[03:44:51.860 --> 03:44:58.260]  the day that alex will have had that richard belzer on the on the on the show that's right and
[03:44:59.220 --> 03:45:07.460]  the first thing that came to my mind i've never seen a telethon or a marathon where they didn't
[03:45:07.460 --> 03:45:13.380]  have a camera up high watching the runners come in that's a very good point yeah that camera was
[03:45:13.380 --> 03:45:19.860]  covered up because it was in it was in the spot where the bomb was to go off yeah and they needed
[03:45:19.860 --> 03:45:27.780]  that ahead of time yeah it was either also i want to see the dash cam of these guys throwing bombs
[03:45:27.780 --> 03:45:32.180]  at the window yes this is exactly what i said i want to see the dash cam of the bombs being
[03:45:32.180 --> 03:45:36.900]  thrown out i want to see the dash cam of the younger brother running over the other brother
[03:45:36.900 --> 03:45:40.420]  i mean they should have all this stuff on tape somewhere well even going back further than that
[03:45:40.420 --> 03:45:44.100]  you remember when they finally did get around to their press conference that they delayed and
[03:45:44.100 --> 03:45:49.220]  then delayed again as we're releasing photographs they were telling people don't look at any of
[03:45:49.220 --> 03:45:55.060]  the other photographs but in their own uh what they were telling us to look at it really wasn't
[03:45:55.060 --> 03:45:59.620]  very credible i mean he had the wrong color backpack the younger brother has a very casual
[03:45:59.620 --> 03:46:05.140]  attitude as he's walking along and uh it just it just didn't make any sense that you know when
[03:46:05.140 --> 03:46:11.700]  they had it and at the press conference you had a reporter ask the uh fbi uh representative
[03:46:12.500 --> 03:46:16.740]  what time it was put down and he was kind of vague on that well it was sometime around you
[03:46:16.740 --> 03:46:20.820]  know close to when the explosion happened do you have a picture of the bag being put down
[03:46:20.820 --> 03:46:25.300]  no no they didn't have you know or they weren't releasing it so why haven't we seen a picture
[03:46:25.300 --> 03:46:30.500]  of the bag being put down i mean they keep showing this picture of the two brothers walking around
[03:46:30.500 --> 03:46:35.300]  the corner of a building and a couple of feet down a sidewalk and that's it and yet we're supposed
[03:46:35.300 --> 03:46:39.300]  to take wrong color with the wrong color bag and yet that's conclusive evidence that these guys did
[03:46:39.300 --> 03:46:43.620]  the bombing and and the press is reporting this as the guys who did the bombing they're not even
[03:46:43.620 --> 03:46:49.300]  using the word alleged yeah and as far as the evidence let's find out who this naked man was
[03:46:49.300 --> 03:46:54.260]  because there is speculation uh the aunt i believe has identified the naked man as one of her
[03:46:54.820 --> 03:46:59.780]  relatives and yes as the older brother caroline talking about that anymore it came out on uh
[03:46:59.780 --> 03:47:03.540]  i think believe it was cnn a few days ago and it hasn't been talked about since as far as i know
[03:47:03.540 --> 03:47:08.100]  that's right mike did you have anything else it's just like i was watching cnn this morning
[03:47:08.100 --> 03:47:14.340]  wait for alex come on and you know they were interviewing these guys and every everybody
[03:47:14.340 --> 03:47:20.980]  that they interviewed kept passing the buck you know that wasn't my department and you know that
[03:47:20.980 --> 03:47:25.700]  was a different district and uh they had a long rifle and you know of course they had to bring
[03:47:25.700 --> 03:47:31.940]  the long rifle into the scene there's a long rifle in the car you know it's just it's just so full
[03:47:31.940 --> 03:47:37.540]  of holes that this thing isn't going to float it the fact it's going to float about as good as that
[03:47:37.540 --> 03:47:43.620]  both absolutely but you you see that they've got their uh their their agenda coming out already
[03:47:44.260 --> 03:47:49.780]  last thursday when the house had the syspa act you had the uh chair of the house committee on
[03:47:49.780 --> 03:47:54.100]  homeland security saying well we had real bombs now but the digital bombs are coming so we've
[03:47:54.100 --> 03:48:01.140]  got to pass syspa then you've got the guy who was a co-sponsor of syspa coming on and talking yesterday
[03:48:02.020 --> 03:48:06.180]  about all these dangers and everything how this has got to be put in so they've got an agenda
[03:48:06.180 --> 03:48:11.860]  they even tried to tie this into other firearms you know say these guys didn't have the proper
[03:48:11.860 --> 03:48:16.740]  licenses for their handgun so therefore we've got to have uh you know more licenses i guess
[03:48:16.740 --> 03:48:22.260]  we're going to have a pressure cooker's band next and uh black powder for making ammunition
[03:48:22.260 --> 03:48:26.340]  is oh yeah that's a that's a real yeah that's a little thing too absolutely well thank you
[03:48:26.340 --> 03:48:31.140]  mike we have to move on to uh let's go to david in alaska david are you there
[03:48:32.500 --> 03:48:39.940]  yes yes uh yes i got a question uh maybe you could help quote either the in the constitution
[03:48:39.940 --> 03:48:45.220]  or in the declaration of independence now i could be wrong i don't know which one it's in
[03:48:45.220 --> 03:48:53.940]  but i know that it's been written in stone set in stone saying we are being able to bear arms
[03:48:55.220 --> 03:49:02.100]  for the reason that if in case one day the government gets too big and too controlling
[03:49:02.100 --> 03:49:11.700]  and tyrannical that we are obligated as our u.s citizen right to to form a militia to fight back
[03:49:11.700 --> 03:49:17.860]  to reach to regain the government well the declaration of independence you know they always
[03:49:17.860 --> 03:49:23.940]  have you memorize in school the part of that that these rights are inalienable rights okay and that
[03:49:23.940 --> 03:49:28.420]  but they don't have you memorize the second half of that first paragraph which says that when a
[03:49:28.420 --> 03:49:34.180]  government is destructive of these rights it is the right of the duty the right and the duty of
[03:49:34.180 --> 03:49:39.540]  the people to alter or abolish that government they don't want you to memorize that part of it
[03:49:39.540 --> 03:49:43.620]  but when we talk about the constitution really the militia and the second amendment comes in in
[03:49:43.620 --> 03:49:48.100]  two places it's not just the second amendment but it was also in article one section eight
[03:49:48.100 --> 03:49:54.020]  and what it said there was that the federal government would not organize an army and fund
[03:49:54.020 --> 03:49:59.220]  it for more than two years at a time they were allowed to organize and fund permanently a navy
[03:49:59.220 --> 03:50:03.860]  to protect our borders and protect us from invasion but they understood that a standing army and if
[03:50:03.860 --> 03:50:07.940]  you look at the federalist papers and the debates on the constitution you'll see that they understood
[03:50:07.940 --> 03:50:12.980]  that a standing army would eventually be used as an instrument of oppression they had already
[03:50:12.980 --> 03:50:17.220]  experienced that from the british and they knew that that would happen again and so they did not
[03:50:17.220 --> 03:50:23.060]  want a permanent standing army and you can see that in the farewell address of eisenhower that he
[03:50:23.060 --> 03:50:27.860]  was very concerned about that about a permanent military industrial complex and how that was
[03:50:27.860 --> 03:50:34.340]  going to be run for profit so that's something that is really kind of came into play after world
[03:50:34.340 --> 03:50:40.100]  war two we've had a constant standing army and uh it's been involved in constant war ever since
[03:50:40.100 --> 03:50:45.380]  then and and now that war is coming home now that military industrial complex is starting to
[03:50:46.100 --> 03:50:51.140]  fund itself with domestic operations and we're going to see that happen we'll be right back in
[03:50:51.140 --> 03:51:05.620]  just a few minutes we're going to take some more calls
[03:51:09.220 --> 03:51:15.460]  in the last two years alone the us has seen huge losses to our food supply in 2011 storms and floods
[03:51:15.460 --> 03:51:20.740]  raged across the us costing us 20 billion and lost crops alone in 2012 we saw the largest

[03:54:23.300 --> 03:54:28.980]  taking your calls and let's go right to uh mic in california mic had we talked to you before
[03:54:28.980 --> 03:54:33.300]  or is this a different mic in california this is a different mic okay how are you doing
[03:54:33.300 --> 03:54:38.900]  oh good hey first of all you guys are playing some great music for the intro thanks but i just
[03:54:38.900 --> 03:54:44.900]  want to say i i caught something in the fdi press conference uh after they caught the suspect uh
[03:54:44.900 --> 03:54:50.100]  reporter asked how did the suspect get away and they said he got away on foot so if he got away
[03:54:50.100 --> 03:54:55.780]  on foot then how is it possible that he also ran over his brother trying to get away yeah that that
[03:54:55.780 --> 03:55:00.100]  was real iffy to me because there's speculation that maybe he was driving and then hopped out the
[03:55:00.100 --> 03:55:05.940]  car then proceeded on foot but even if he did proceed on foot i mean with that many officers
[03:55:05.940 --> 03:55:10.420]  around i mean the dragnet of that i'm just not sure how he could get away with that many officers
[03:55:10.420 --> 03:55:14.580]  around him especially if they had any type of helicopter coverage yeah and even with the
[03:55:14.580 --> 03:55:18.420]  house to house gestapo tactics that they were doing you know pulling people out of their houses at
[03:55:18.420 --> 03:55:23.700]  gunpoint they didn't find him yeah it was the guy said hey i think there's somebody in my boat
[03:55:23.700 --> 03:55:28.500]  you know he turned a man i mean it's citizens who found him right anything else you want to say mic
[03:55:28.500 --> 03:55:33.780]  so yeah yeah uh well first of all they were also already engaged in a firefight so i don't see the
[03:55:33.780 --> 03:55:40.260]  guy getting away without being shot but also wondering oh michelle obama has no official
[03:55:40.260 --> 03:55:46.340]  capacity whatsoever she's not elected she has no authority whatsoever what right did she have to
[03:55:46.340 --> 03:55:52.980]  go in there and see somebody that was a person of interest in a massive terrorist plot without you
[03:55:52.980 --> 03:55:58.500]  know how does she get in through the back door into the hospital like this oh she you know it's
[03:55:58.500 --> 03:56:02.820]  just a photo op and you know something to talk about just like he says he has no elected office
[03:56:02.820 --> 03:56:08.820]  he's you know the wife of the president yeah yeah absolutely well thank you mic appreciate it let's go
[03:56:08.820 --> 03:56:19.220]  to josh and georgia josh are you there hey there hey how are you what you got um well uh i've been
[03:56:19.220 --> 03:56:28.500]  better than the last week or uh just it's horrible uh but so what i wanted to do is uh kind of uh
[03:56:28.500 --> 03:56:35.460]  plug here i've got a uh page on uh facebook that i started in a group and is uh it's called the name
[03:56:35.460 --> 03:56:41.620]  of it is uh the constitution is alive now granted i know it's not a living document but if the
[03:56:41.620 --> 03:56:48.180]  constitution dies so does this country is the uh the idea that i was going with um also email it
[03:56:48.180 --> 03:56:56.100]  at hotmail same name um and what it is uh i'm trying i've been getting in contact with uh various
[03:56:56.100 --> 03:57:04.980]  national and local groups as well as trying to contact um uh senators and legislators uh about
[03:57:04.980 --> 03:57:12.740]  uh having a national rally on july 4th uh i feel that that that date will send an even
[03:57:12.740 --> 03:57:19.140]  greater message than you know some any other day of the year especially for this nation uh
[03:57:19.140 --> 03:57:24.500]  for us to march on our state capitals i feel that uh if you can make it to washington
[03:57:24.500 --> 03:57:30.500]  and that that'll be great but uh if you can't can't make the cross country trek uh state capitals of
[03:57:30.500 --> 03:57:37.940]  work uh for gun owners across america to finally stand up and and have our voice be heard where we
[03:57:37.940 --> 03:57:43.060]  can absolutely and your voice is going to be heard better at the state level than it is at the
[03:57:43.060 --> 03:57:48.100]  federal level i mean we've seen that over and over again there are some legislators at the
[03:57:48.100 --> 03:57:55.060]  state level we have some people here in texas who are trying to fight uh the tsa's uh overreaching
[03:57:55.060 --> 03:57:59.940]  violation of the fourth amendment and uh other things and and so you do have some people who
[03:57:59.940 --> 03:58:05.460]  are pushing back against federal use of patience power and overreach and they're at the state level
[03:58:05.460 --> 03:58:11.940]  so you need to really get involved there and support those people and then i have been uh i
[03:58:11.940 --> 03:58:20.260]  haven't i haven't really gotten any uh any feedback uh from uh from anybody uh any politically wise uh
[03:58:20.260 --> 03:58:25.860]  yet but um we'll keep trying and and tell people on your facebook page to uh work against syspa
