[00:00.000 --> 00:07.640]  you walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future not a
[00:07.640 --> 00:13.760]  future that will be but one that might be this is not a new world it is simply
[00:13.760 --> 00:19.200]  an extension of what began in the old one it has patterned itself after every
[00:19.200 --> 00:23.040]  dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of
[00:23.040 --> 00:28.960]  history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances
[00:28.960 --> 00:34.360]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like
[00:34.360 --> 00:40.160]  every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic
[00:40.160 --> 00:44.080]  is an enemy and truth is a menace
[00:46.560 --> 00:53.560]  this is mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48 hours on earth he's a citizen of
[00:53.560 --> 00:57.840]  the state but will soon have to be eliminated because he's built out of
[00:57.840 --> 01:03.280]  flesh and because he has a mind mr. Romney Wordsworth who will draw his
[01:03.280 --> 01:12.160]  last breaths in the twilight zone as Americans turn the corner towards the
[01:12.160 --> 01:17.040]  final presidential debate on Wednesday the election circus has devolved into
[01:17.040 --> 01:21.640]  personal attacks and character assassination rather than any real focus
[01:21.640 --> 01:26.240]  on the issues plaguing the United States the media outlets did not even
[01:26.240 --> 01:31.480]  attempt to confirm the most basic facts because even a simple investigation
[01:31.480 --> 01:39.360]  would have shown that these were nothing more than false smears facing an
[01:39.360 --> 01:43.600]  avalanche of new accusations from women who are coming forward to claim he
[01:43.600 --> 01:48.760]  kissed and fondled them six women are going public today with stories that
[01:48.760 --> 01:54.000]  echo what Trump himself said in that notorious hot mic video he called this
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.680]  woman miss Piggy her name is Alicia Machado Trump spoke out about those
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.520]  claims on Fox News and she was the worst we ever had the worst the absolute worst
[02:04.520 --> 02:09.880]  and you know she gained a massive amount of weight and it was it was a real
[02:09.880 --> 02:14.040]  problem regardless of the fact that Obama's unconstitutional open border
[02:14.040 --> 02:19.520]  policy is quietly responsible for killing as many as 7500 Americans every
[02:19.520 --> 02:24.200]  year 20 on average per day due to the hordes of illegal drivers flooding the
[02:24.200 --> 02:29.480]  roads while Obama creates a pilot program to have Americans pay for Syrian
[02:29.480 --> 02:34.280]  refugees to come to the United States and move into our homes regardless of the
[02:34.280 --> 02:40.600]  fact that food stamp participation has increased by 78% over the past 10 years
[02:40.600 --> 02:44.800]  regardless of the fact that Obama and Hillary's new Cold War rhetoric
[02:44.800 --> 02:49.600]  amplified by a suicidal mainstream media has obliterated any shred of
[02:49.600 --> 02:55.320]  integrity 6% of Americans still think cable-fed propaganda media has after
[02:55.320 --> 02:59.320]  polls revealed America is almost completely done with the mainstream
[02:59.320 --> 03:04.240]  media mainstream media's stranglehold of propaganda desperation and damage was
[03:04.240 --> 03:09.280]  palpable on the campaign trail as if its demise was what truly concerns
[03:09.280 --> 03:14.480]  Americans but obviously has panicked the ruling elite he doesn't have the
[03:14.480 --> 03:17.640]  temperament he doesn't have the knowledge he doesn't seem to have the
[03:17.640 --> 03:25.120]  interest in acquiring the knowledge or the basic honesty that a president needs
[03:25.120 --> 03:31.920]  to have and that was true before we heard him talking about how he treats
[03:31.920 --> 03:37.640]  women this is not something that we can ignore it's not something we can just
[03:37.640 --> 03:42.480]  sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election
[03:42.480 --> 03:48.760]  season because this was not just a lewd conversation this wasn't just locker
[03:48.760 --> 03:55.320]  room banter this was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly
[03:55.320 --> 04:01.520]  about sexually predatory behavior and actually bragging about kissing and
[04:01.520 --> 04:06.080]  groping women using language so obscene that many of us were worried about our
[04:06.080 --> 04:10.760]  children hearing it when we turn on the TV you know she made a powerful speech
[04:10.760 --> 04:14.600]  they said it was the greatest speech of the decade I think speaking to everyone
[04:14.600 --> 04:18.200]  out there who respects women and saying put your politics aside for a second and
[04:18.200 --> 04:21.280]  be able to call something that's indefensible indefensible and that's
[04:21.280 --> 04:28.680]  what his behavior is online news is the future and Washington DC knows it
[04:28.680 --> 04:34.560]  six in 10 Americans are getting their news from social media alone while one
[04:34.560 --> 04:39.600]  in five households has dropped cable's buffet of news propaganda to research
[04:39.600 --> 04:43.840]  digital options and think for themselves mainstream media with its
[04:43.840 --> 04:47.680]  hubris as shallow and obvious as the corporate government criminals it
[04:47.680 --> 04:55.760]  represents appears to be breathing its last gasp John Bowne for infowars.com

[06:02.640 --> 06:11.600]  it's Sunday October 16th 2016 we are now only 22 short days from the November 8th
[06:11.600 --> 06:21.200]  election you're listening to the Alex Jones show broadcasting world-wide from Austin, Texas
[06:34.560 --> 06:41.200]  22 days ladies and gentlemen 22 days well Ricky Leeks is not disappointing
[06:41.200 --> 06:45.720]  we salute them every two days they're releasing giant data dumps of thousands
[06:45.720 --> 06:51.920]  of emails each revelation each data dump more over the top than the last today I
[06:51.920 --> 06:55.000]  was sitting there this morning reading some of the earlier leaks from the week
[06:55.000 --> 07:01.160]  and going over them myself deciding to kind of collate just a few dozen of the
[07:01.160 --> 07:04.320]  seven eight thousand that are out there that we're all desperately trying to go
[07:04.320 --> 07:07.960]  through that the White House and others haven't even denied or accurate they're
[07:07.960 --> 07:11.360]  saying though it's criminal to read these on air and no one should look at
[07:11.360 --> 07:18.480]  them and it's the top Democrats meeting thanking God the American people are so
[07:18.480 --> 07:22.280]  stupid and they talk about how to keep us in the dark and how to keep us dumb
[07:22.280 --> 07:33.920]  down and then that ties into this latest pedestrian email where you have the
[07:33.920 --> 07:40.680]  San Bernardino Islamic attack and he's there talking to his aid and they're
[07:40.680 --> 07:46.440]  going oh no it's not a white guy commence cover-up commence cover-up
[07:46.440 --> 07:51.320]  commence cover-up the level of racial politics is over the top they bring in
[07:51.320 --> 07:56.560]  these Muslims they go to Muslim training camps and come back the FBI's order to
[07:56.560 --> 08:02.160]  not investigate this very husband and wife pair they attack and for two days
[08:02.160 --> 08:06.600]  the FBI was told we knew this came out in the news to say it wasn't terror and
[08:06.600 --> 08:11.920]  wasn't Islamic State even though they pledged allegiance to it to Islamic
[08:11.920 --> 08:18.720]  State I mean this is how this is how crazy and out of control all of this has
[08:18.720 --> 08:25.840]  gotten but now we have the email where they're there basically manipulating and
[08:25.840 --> 08:30.120]  controlling the media there are thousands of emails where they're telling
[08:30.120 --> 08:33.280]  the media what to do and controlling the New York Times we already know this by
[08:33.280 --> 08:38.920]  watching the news by reading the New York Times but wow Clinton campaign email
[08:38.920 --> 08:42.480]  outline effort to quote produce an unaware and compliant citizenry and
[08:42.480 --> 08:49.520]  this is one email that has not gotten any mainstream MSN coverage and there's
[08:49.520 --> 08:53.120]  so many others like it coming out that are cold-blooded where these are not
[08:53.120 --> 08:58.200]  ideologues in my view this is criminal talk where you're even telling your
[08:58.200 --> 09:04.160]  aides in fact that's in the email we're horrible people we do horrible things and
[09:04.160 --> 09:13.160]  we all agree that's what we do so we've got to increase what we're doing and I
[09:13.160 --> 09:17.080]  could read to you what they say again here and as I've mentioned we've all
[09:17.080 --> 09:23.640]  been quite content to demean government drop civics and in general conspired
[09:23.640 --> 09:27.440]  produce an unaware and compliant citizenry he writes he goes on to say race
[09:27.440 --> 09:34.000]  war is what's needed can't make it up he says everything we're doing is not
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.320]  working anymore the think tank recommends we go to pure cultural warfare
[09:39.320 --> 09:46.040]  that's from a year ago you can see the cultural warfare they came out on Friday
[09:46.040 --> 09:50.560]  Hillary Clinton's spokeswoman and attack Donald Trump yours truly and Steve
[09:50.560 --> 09:56.800]  Bannon they said oh it's very dangerous to listen to Alex Jones it's very it's
[09:56.800 --> 10:01.400]  definite that Trump is reading right from Jones's playbook now he's actually
[10:01.400 --> 10:04.680]  doing his own research and has the former head of defense intelligence
[10:04.680 --> 10:09.800]  advising him which might as well be me because I know what I'm talking about I
[10:09.800 --> 10:15.280]  do research I don't put out what I want to put out I put out the good the bad
[10:15.280 --> 10:20.000]  and the ugly it's my credibility is all I got and I'll never give it up for
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.360]  anybody quote Tony Montana there's only two things you've gotten this world your
[10:24.360 --> 10:28.600]  word and your way of those and I ain't breaking them for nobody you've got my
[10:28.600 --> 10:35.560]  word that I will never deceive you never lie to you and I will always tell you the
[10:35.560 --> 10:39.200]  absolute truth that we can come up with and we all see through rose colored
[10:39.200 --> 10:43.000]  glasses as the Bible says we all have distortions we all have prejudices
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.680]  let's not lie about it but I am really trying to be honest with you as honest as
[10:46.680 --> 10:50.000]  I can although it's a lot easier to just be honest trying to keep track of
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.080]  stuff I just tell the truth move on you hear me say something five years ago it's
[10:54.080 --> 10:59.920]  the same thing now because it's just going with the facts now there is so much
[10:59.920 --> 11:02.720]  to hit today we've got a bunch of WikiLeaks we didn't get to on Friday we've
[11:02.720 --> 11:08.920]  got the new one that came out today we've got them conspiring to keep with
[11:08.920 --> 11:13.640]  the EU that's who runs immigration in England Michael Savage and thousands of
[11:13.640 --> 11:16.520]  others from being able to fly into the country because they wanted to set a
[11:16.520 --> 11:20.240]  model for if they don't like your politics you can't travel you can't have
[11:20.240 --> 11:24.080]  a job I mean that's what the Nazis did there it is topofdrudgereport.com
[11:24.080 --> 11:30.680]  world net daily Sharia law Clinton kept savage on hate list Clinton kept
[11:30.680 --> 11:36.280]  savage on hate list so he couldn't travel because it's a beta test a lot of
[11:36.280 --> 11:39.920]  fools out there go I don't care I don't care I mean I know a lot of talk show
[11:39.920 --> 11:43.960]  hosts are like oh good I hope I hope a blim blim ball has a heart attack I hope
[11:43.960 --> 11:48.160]  all these old guys go away that gives us a shot at the future that is mindless
[11:48.160 --> 11:51.920]  thinking folks like like when someone has something bad happened to him you
[11:51.920 --> 11:57.520]  somehow get ahead they get away with this we all lose our rights folks that's
[11:57.520 --> 12:03.640]  why they were persecuting Michael Moore for his speech I would stand up for him
[12:03.640 --> 12:06.640]  even if I disagree with the speech but notice they don't agree with our speech
[12:06.640 --> 12:10.240]  they want to shut our speech down that's in all the emails it's in the emails
[12:10.240 --> 12:14.600]  from a month ago over a month ago that Soros wants to use the UN takeover of
[12:14.600 --> 12:18.440]  the internet that was coming up this is a year ago came out a month ago the UN
[12:18.440 --> 12:22.880]  takeover happened 16 days ago and he said once the UN takes over we want to
[12:22.880 --> 12:27.160]  start restricting speech using these models and now they've got Khan the
[12:27.160 --> 12:31.200]  Islamic mayor of London saying you're not gonna have bathing suits on the sides
[12:31.200 --> 12:34.840]  of your advertising and we're gonna implement Sharia law and I don't
[12:34.840 --> 12:40.480]  apologize for it and then he comes here and lectures Americans we have to
[12:40.480 --> 12:47.840]  accept all this these people are naked flaming criminals in my view now before
[12:47.840 --> 12:52.320]  the big news of the day I want to break something down I was here working most
[12:52.320 --> 12:56.760]  the day yesterday and today because we got 22 days out of the election this is
[12:56.760 --> 13:00.040]  a world-changing election it's a referendum on nationalism versus
[13:00.040 --> 13:07.000]  globalism Americanism versus tyranny and the Liberty Movement has broken through
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  people are understanding just like they did in the UK they were under EU
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.320]  control the same globalist unelected system magic things are happening right
[13:15.320 --> 13:22.080]  now but I had a late lunch I went to a local sports bar that has decent food
[13:22.080 --> 13:27.840]  it's close to the office and I watched for about 45 minutes while I ate all
[13:27.840 --> 13:31.640]  these men not having conversations with their wives and children all watching
[13:31.640 --> 13:35.320]  different football screens and coming over to me and asking me what I thought
[13:35.320 --> 13:40.080]  of football and I realized talk about echo chamber they are in their own
[13:40.080 --> 13:43.920]  world our country's being robbed by offshore mega banks that admit they
[13:43.920 --> 13:47.200]  wanted to destroy our economy and consolidate control break up the family
[13:47.200 --> 13:51.360]  and make us total serfs they're starting a huge war with Russia I'm gonna get to
[13:51.360 --> 13:55.200]  after the break just over the top new developments that are so huge I can't
[13:55.200 --> 13:59.760]  even believe it the biggest ever and they're compartmentalized and then you
[13:59.760 --> 14:02.200]  got folks that are in their bike riding clubs that's all they care about or
[14:02.200 --> 14:05.000]  folks that are in their church club and that's all they care about or
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.840]  liberals that are kind of their own echo chamber of pseudo-intellectualism and
[14:10.840 --> 14:16.040]  and you know being traffic cops and language police then I thought about
[14:16.040 --> 14:20.560]  mainline libertarians patriots and conservatives we've got to get outside
[14:20.560 --> 14:25.280]  our echo chamber which is what I've done for 20-something years and reach out to
[14:25.280 --> 14:29.320]  everybody and really make a noise however we can to shake people out of
[14:29.320 --> 14:34.120]  their complacency and their trance we have a mixture of what I term mass
[14:34.120 --> 14:40.320]  Stockholm syndrome or victims defending their victimizers and learned
[14:40.320 --> 14:45.680]  helplessness but more than learned helplessness and more than mass Stockholm
[14:45.680 --> 14:52.160]  syndrome it is the normal C bias people in North Korea even though a third of
[14:52.160 --> 14:55.440]  their population has been starved to death the last 30 years even though the
[14:55.440 --> 14:58.720]  government is the most corrupt on earth totally insane with little fat clown
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.960]  running it despite all that disconnect the average person in North Korea was
[15:03.960 --> 15:06.960]  born into it and they don't know the difference and that's the real danger
[15:06.960 --> 15:11.960]  here is the normal C bias and also people think being lazy and not being
[15:11.960 --> 15:17.440]  involved is super cool well here's the good news those people that don't care
[15:17.440 --> 15:22.400]  and don't see themselves in the role of resisting tyranny they don't count either
[15:22.400 --> 15:27.640]  way they decided to not exist those of us that are awake in new care outnumber
[15:27.640 --> 15:33.720]  the parasites and their controllers many times over we have the ingenuity we
[15:33.720 --> 15:37.200]  have the skill we have the will and we have history and Providence on our side
[15:37.200 --> 15:41.520]  we will win now the huge news that's only been reported in foreign papers but I've

[20:22.640 --> 20:26.760]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:26.760 --> 20:32.360]  all right I shot a detailed report before airtime to do so that I could add
[20:32.360 --> 20:36.120]  all the research all the documents all the video clips in we're going to
[20:36.120 --> 20:40.320]  premiere that report it's 13 minutes long so it'll take one segment and part
[20:40.320 --> 20:44.720]  of another coming up at the start of the next segment and the video will be
[20:44.720 --> 20:49.040]  posted it's being uploaded right now by the next hour by the second hour at
[20:49.040 --> 20:56.640]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and it deals with the fact that the occupied
[20:56.640 --> 21:01.400]  United States this country run by Soros Goldman Sachs and a few mega banks
[21:01.400 --> 21:06.960]  openly is already prosecuting asymmetrical warfare in four different
[21:06.960 --> 21:12.560]  countries bordering Russia and in Syria they are also admittedly putting out
[21:12.560 --> 21:16.280]  white papers that they're trying to overthrow Russia internally they are
[21:16.280 --> 21:20.880]  also admitting in the latest WikiLeaks documents that they are trying to
[21:20.880 --> 21:25.120]  basically in the free press in this country and that they believe a war with
[21:25.120 --> 21:29.760]  Russia will be the political distraction they need now we've known this for a
[21:29.760 --> 21:34.880]  while this has now been confirmed in triplicate they don't really even try to
[21:34.880 --> 21:41.160]  hide it quite frankly and we noticed that a month ago over a month ago Hillary
[21:41.160 --> 21:44.240]  came out and said if there's a cyber attack by Russia we should militarily
[21:44.240 --> 21:49.960]  strike them then we noticed that North com and NATO and all of them came out
[21:49.960 --> 21:54.960]  and said that's our new policy which is saying anybody hacks us we just think
[21:54.960 --> 21:58.960]  it's you we're gonna militarily hit you not just cyber attack then Joe Biden came
[21:58.960 --> 22:03.000]  out last Wednesday from a clip that aired today on meet the press because
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.640]  they shot it back on Wednesday they but they are just a clip promoting the show
[22:08.640 --> 22:12.400]  this Sunday where he said we're gonna launch a massive cyber attack in the
[22:12.400 --> 22:16.400]  next few weeks against Russia and if they respond we're basically gonna
[22:16.400 --> 22:21.280]  militarily hit you so they're poking the bear right before the election 22 days
[22:21.280 --> 22:26.080]  out this is a giant October November surprise this is so classic to have a
[22:26.080 --> 22:32.400]  regime that's in trouble start a war that is the classic 101 move of a tyrant
[22:32.400 --> 22:38.120]  and it's all over the British German Russian Japanese news Brazilian
[22:38.120 --> 22:43.480]  everybody sees what it is we're acting worse than Fidel Castro the people that
[22:43.480 --> 22:47.640]  have hijacked our government have been caught in a criminal conspiracy against
[22:47.640 --> 22:53.480]  this nation and they came out the White House spokesman last week Obama last
[22:53.480 --> 23:00.160]  week and Hillary spokeswoman on Friday naming me by name and saying that my
[23:00.160 --> 23:07.360]  dangerous ideas have made it into Trump I'd love to take credit for that but
[23:07.360 --> 23:12.440]  quite frankly I'm telling you what's really going on Trump's being advised by
[23:12.440 --> 23:17.040]  Senator Sessions and General Flynn if you want to know who he mainly listens to
[23:17.040 --> 23:22.000]  and them both men basically sound just like me you know why we're not in an
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.320]  echo chamber folks we can all get up and see the sunrise the morning agree it's a
[23:25.320 --> 23:30.720]  sunrise we can all agree that we drink a glass of lemonade it's lemonade we can
[23:30.720 --> 23:34.120]  all agree when we see tyranny it's tyranny so Clinton spokeswoman Trump
[23:34.120 --> 23:39.120]  campaign overtaken by Breitbart inforce they act like his greatest strength is
[23:39.120 --> 23:42.040]  his greatest weakness he comes out and says there's a conspiracy against the
[23:42.040 --> 23:45.480]  American people in the media as part of it there's a global government being
[23:45.480 --> 23:50.200]  set up they're taking our liberties they're trying to start a war it's the
[23:50.200 --> 23:55.800]  truth this is such an incredible moment and they know their way behind the
[23:55.800 --> 23:59.600]  polls that's actually even coming out mainstream news they know Hillary and
[23:59.600 --> 24:07.440]  these emails are devastating there's new ones out that I'm gonna get to just
[24:07.440 --> 24:10.920]  analyzing five of these emails took us 30 minutes today where they know they're
[24:10.920 --> 24:14.320]  violating federal law and the emails they say they are and they laugh about
[24:14.320 --> 24:19.200]  it and say it doesn't matter we're in charge I mean we've got them saying we
[24:19.200 --> 24:24.160]  are committing crimes just what Tosh plumbing the CIA whistleblower said
[24:24.160 --> 24:28.480]  here four years ago using the State Department to ship illegal stuff out of
[24:28.480 --> 24:35.120]  the United States weapons you name it I mean just right here folks we have them
[24:35.120 --> 24:38.200]  this stack right here gives me I just got chills I don't say that on purpose I
[24:38.200 --> 24:41.000]  mean I just get chills I should get chills maybe once a month when I talked
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.040]  about some story little kids burn up at Waco the Hillary give them the order to
[24:45.040 --> 24:48.320]  go in and kill everybody that came out in Congress I got chills then now I get
[24:48.320 --> 24:51.920]  them every few minutes because this is just so incredible how many of these
[24:51.920 --> 24:57.160]  devastating bombshells do we need now they tend to launch big wars when the
[24:57.160 --> 25:00.320]  economy is about to implode notice Deutsche Bank they say is going down
[25:00.320 --> 25:04.880]  imminently it could be in I mean it's imminent it could happen any time any
[25:04.880 --> 25:10.880]  moment worse than Lehman Brothers 50 times bigger or more the Shane Clinton's
[25:10.880 --> 25:14.600]  Larry Summers folks created the derivatives set that whole scam up the
[25:14.600 --> 25:21.520]  time bomb is kicking down it's happening now and we've got Hillary Clinton
[25:21.520 --> 25:25.040]  remember this drumbeat that if you're against Hillary or for the Russians it's
[25:25.040 --> 25:29.280]  ridiculous and then we saw the head general this is coming up the head of
[25:29.280 --> 25:33.000]  the Army say Russian things they're gonna bring down the EU and have the
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.240]  Brexit and blow up I'll hit you harder to have been hit the idea that people went
[25:37.240 --> 25:41.200]  out of the EU that they never voted to be part of because Russia is doing it the
[25:41.200 --> 25:46.040]  idea that people went out of the EU and England because of the Russians you kept
[25:46.040 --> 25:49.240]  was found 25 years ago something to do with the Russians British people want to
[25:49.240 --> 25:52.520]  run their own country and the same thing here I want my own country I don't want
[25:52.520 --> 25:56.760]  to be run by George Soros and Goldman Sachs and so the answer is I'm anti
[25:56.760 --> 26:00.840]  Semitic well I mean I'm sorry George Soros claims he's Jewish the guy helped
[26:00.840 --> 26:04.440]  round up Jews he was a frickin Nazi collaborator it's not my fault he's
[26:04.440 --> 26:07.120]  Jewish I'm not I mean there's a lot of folks in it that aren't Jewish but the
[26:07.120 --> 26:10.360]  pay is you bring all this race garbage in kind of like when I was saying
[26:10.360 --> 26:16.080]  famously hey folks you know Obamacare's got death panels and doubles prices they
[26:16.080 --> 26:19.720]  had MSNBC say Alex Jones is against it because Obama's a black man and he's
[26:19.720 --> 26:23.280]  deeply racist and that's nothing to do with Obama a bunch of foreign insurance
[26:23.280 --> 26:26.600]  companies basically wrote this thing again we're being eluded because our
[26:26.600 --> 26:29.600]  regulators are controlled by foreign interest other countries don't let
[26:29.600 --> 26:33.040]  people come in and loot them like this only third-world countries do and we
[26:33.040 --> 26:38.280]  act like a third-world country that just bends the people over every foreign
[26:38.280 --> 26:42.120]  interest in a paycheck and the whole world sees it and the Russians after the
[26:42.120 --> 26:47.120]  fall Soviet Union for a decade were treated like a two-dollar whore as well
[26:47.120 --> 26:50.560]  and they're finally pulling away and that's what's happening and if you
[26:50.560 --> 26:53.520]  actually read the Financial Times of London or you read globalist publications
[26:53.520 --> 26:56.600]  they admit they go world government's in trouble our whole program's falling
[26:56.600 --> 27:00.200]  apart and we I guess we did rip everybody off we kind of deserve it we
[27:00.200 --> 27:03.800]  better reform ourselves people are really mad let's call ourselves liberal
[27:03.800 --> 27:07.000]  new world order now these are real headlines I've got the articles I'm
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.320]  gonna show them to TV viewers and give listeners the headlines I mean they
[27:11.320 --> 27:14.080]  admit they're setting up world government they admit it's unelected they
[27:14.080 --> 27:18.400]  admit it's horrible and then they say none of us are allowed to leave or the
[27:18.400 --> 27:26.840]  U.S. Army and sitcoms gonna kill us there's about to be a war bigger than World War 2 if
[27:26.840 --> 27:31.840]  you think you're gonna bring down the EU or NATO or get us out of Brexit will hit
[27:31.840 --> 27:35.680]  you harder do you ever been hit before oh guess go ahead and hit me then hell
[27:35.680 --> 27:39.680]  nuke Texas then because the governor here doesn't want to be under the feds and
[27:39.680 --> 27:44.600]  the globalist I mean hell nuke us all dig up John Wayne's body burn it he's a
[27:44.600 --> 27:49.840]  Russian agent George Washington's a Russian agent he didn't fight the
[27:49.840 --> 27:53.760]  British Redcoats because they were enslaving and had high taxes and were
[27:53.760 --> 27:58.220]  press getting people into forced naval service no George Washington was getting
[27:58.220 --> 28:01.880]  orders from Vladimir Putin who got the time machine and went back and did it
[28:01.880 --> 28:04.840]  and the British again they are not pulling out of the EU because they
[28:04.840 --> 28:07.880]  don't want the massive taxes and open borders and all the regulations and
[28:07.880 --> 28:13.000]  scams 90% of laws being made by the EU they're doing it because they're
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.440]  Russian agents but folks you say well nobody's buying that they're launching
[28:17.440 --> 28:21.460]  a cyber attack against Russia claiming they attacked here and then they say or
[28:21.460 --> 28:25.360]  we may launch a military attack in doctrine that's a declaration of war
[28:25.360 --> 28:31.080]  saying we're going to attack you clearly trying to trick the Russians into a
[28:31.080 --> 28:35.680]  response or they might even do that they may just fall flag and claim the
[28:35.680 --> 28:41.840]  Russians did it the next 22 days folks terror attacks economic crises cyber
[28:41.840 --> 28:45.480]  attacks will they knock out East Coast power during the election suspended
[28:45.480 --> 28:50.080]  claiming the Russians did it anything is on the table but clearly blame the
[28:50.080 --> 28:55.000]  Russian guard in their fist is the main ace card they've got and we're here to
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.520]  expose it and blow their operation because the globalist are the
[28:58.520 --> 29:03.840]  outlanders more than two years ago info wars first told you about our
[29:03.840 --> 29:07.680]  research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy I've told you about
[29:07.680 --> 29:11.160]  how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[29:11.160 --> 29:15.720]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of
[29:15.720 --> 29:19.560]  the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the
[29:19.560 --> 29:24.040]  water they took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the
[29:24.040 --> 29:28.560]  Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today I was there telling you

[33:39.600 --> 33:43.840]  today's out from the historic election a referendum against unelected global
[33:43.840 --> 33:48.240]  corporate government there are more articles today about confirmed leprosy
[33:48.240 --> 33:52.400]  bubonic plague in the United States on the fastest growing businesses in the
[33:52.400 --> 33:59.000]  U.S. is lice and bed bug removal the infant mortality rate is the worst of
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.760]  the industrialized world we were the best 50 years ago only throw that out

[34:06.920 --> 34:14.280]  prosperity now I'm gonna get to this special report but it folks you don't
[34:14.280 --> 34:17.400]  understand you've got to listen to the second hour today because we're gonna
[34:17.400 --> 34:21.880]  get into the rest of the amazing news suddenly I've seen the New York Times the
[34:21.880 --> 34:25.840]  Washington Post and others try to regain a little bit of credibility because they
[34:25.840 --> 34:29.360]  know they destroyed themselves so badly and trumpet internal polls is still 10
[34:29.360 --> 34:33.040]  15 points ahead they know there's a mega massive landslide coming so they're
[34:33.040 --> 34:37.240]  having their bets they're admitting that in Haiti Hillary and Bill I mean
[34:37.240 --> 34:40.920]  Chelsea even admitted robbed and basically killed people with their actions
[34:40.920 --> 34:48.080]  on purpose it's coming out that Hillary has been involved in massive criminal
[34:48.080 --> 34:50.680]  activity they know there's no way they're gonna be able to prop her up even
[34:50.680 --> 34:54.920]  if she gets into office they're figuring that out now the elites are they
[34:54.920 --> 34:58.560]  don't know what to do and that's why Axelrod has come out and I said this
[34:58.560 --> 35:06.280]  last week Trump annihilated her last week last Sunday if he does it again
[35:06.280 --> 35:09.720]  Wednesday from Vegas and our reporters are gonna be there we're gonna be
[35:09.720 --> 35:13.320]  interviewing Nigel Farage who's advising him and others notice how he turned
[35:13.320 --> 35:17.560]  around with Nigel Farage I mean that's like at the Alex Jones of the UK folks
[35:17.560 --> 35:23.600]  and beyond yeah he's gonna devastate her and they're thinking about her not
[35:23.600 --> 35:27.960]  showing now and notice she's not seen but every four or five days she's got
[35:27.960 --> 35:33.080]  proxies out she's super sick I've pointed out I believe she's getting blood
[35:33.080 --> 35:36.280]  transfusions to be able to even go from looking like she's dead to looking like
[35:36.280 --> 35:40.360]  she's okay she'll have to sit down last week most of the time clearly she's
[35:40.360 --> 35:43.640]  being given speed to type drugs and Trump wants her drug tested he's saying
[35:43.640 --> 35:46.360]  he'll get drug tested
[35:46.360 --> 35:53.440]  I mean Hillary's on Parkinson's medication so they're in free fall now what
[35:53.440 --> 35:59.240]  do they think's gonna save their bacon I shot this 13 minute report we're gonna
[35:59.240 --> 36:02.680]  air it in this segment the next it's going up on info wars calm the next
[36:02.680 --> 36:05.400]  hour you need to get out to everybody there's several other reports along the
[36:05.400 --> 36:09.880]  same line but this is the big that breaks it down from every angle the only
[36:09.880 --> 36:13.120]  part I didn't get into on this report is something I filed earlier this morning
[36:13.120 --> 36:18.560]  and that's their plan B after this one and that's the billion spent by the Ford
[36:18.560 --> 36:25.200]  Foundation Soros and White House funded groups the last six seven years to
[36:25.200 --> 36:29.440]  create racial division and prepare a destabilization technique with
[36:29.440 --> 36:33.760]  communist Islamic sleeper cells they've brought into Europe in the US and the
[36:33.760 --> 36:38.880]  Black Lives Matter crowd to kill police and local government folks in mass
[36:38.880 --> 36:44.560]  burned down major cities as a pretext to force capitulation to federal slash
[36:44.560 --> 36:48.800]  globalization and that of course is in the emails as well we use demographic
[36:48.800 --> 36:52.960]  warfare to control the people so we know they've done this in other areas of
[36:52.960 --> 36:56.640]  the Middle East they've done in Eastern Europe Ukraine they used anti-police
[36:56.640 --> 37:00.440]  sentiment to launch that civil war that overthrew the elected government this
[37:00.440 --> 37:03.760]  isn't a defense of the police whole hog it's a defense of we're not gonna have
[37:03.760 --> 37:08.160]  outside groups over the country and that's what they're doing so we're on a
[37:08.160 --> 37:13.240]  razor's edge here and notice of just happened today breaking Republican Party
[37:13.240 --> 37:17.240]  headquarters is fire bombed that's the Daily Mail and an adjacent building is
[37:17.240 --> 37:20.480]  dubbed with the Nazi graffiti in North Carolina see it's okay though because
[37:20.480 --> 37:26.440]  they're Republicans they're all Nazis see they've been dehumanized but Hillary's
[37:26.440 --> 37:30.760]  false flag is to blame Russia for all the different hacks most of its US
[37:30.760 --> 37:33.720]  government people we have that from mr. Benny former head of the NSA
[37:33.720 --> 37:37.720]  technical DNC people that see the corruption Bernie Sanders people they
[37:37.720 --> 37:42.160]  get shot in the back the Russians admitted they hacked six years ago the
[37:42.160 --> 37:45.720]  UN emails where they were hiding the decline and in line to get a carbon
[37:45.720 --> 37:52.040]  tax I mean we have them so the other facet of this is the the larger
[37:52.040 --> 37:56.560]  cultural destabilization and that's in the latest WikiLeaks Podesta today says
[37:56.560 --> 38:02.440]  oh no it's it's it's Arabs that shot up the school oh we've got a home no it's
[38:02.440 --> 38:08.800]  not a white guy too bad well make sure we don't call it terror so that's the
[38:08.800 --> 38:12.520]  narrative folks because they're getting their sleeper cells in place 80%
[38:12.520 --> 38:17.120]  military aged men as their backup that's their shock troops then they play the
[38:17.120 --> 38:21.200]  part of the saviors rounding the folks up they brought in keep telling you this
[38:21.200 --> 38:24.920]  but now we have the emails this is serious asymmetrical warfare we're
[38:24.920 --> 38:32.120]  facing his last email last one came out two days before Scalia found in they
[38:32.120 --> 38:35.040]  are about to have some wet work batten down the hatches and get ready this is
[38:35.040 --> 38:38.000]  gonna be rough you know a lot of wet work going on out there that means
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.480]  assassinations okay but let's start the report most of it will plan the next
[38:42.480 --> 38:47.800]  segment it's going up on info wars.com very very soon this deals with the
[38:47.800 --> 38:51.680]  build up the preparation all of it at the foreign globalist takeover America
[38:51.680 --> 38:55.880]  and when the nationalists say no well obviously everybody's gonna go with the
[38:55.880 --> 39:01.720]  nationalist so you you say their enemy agents while you start a war that gets
[39:01.720 --> 39:05.080]  the public all angry and a psychologically line up behind the
[39:05.080 --> 39:10.160]  central government itself a corporate takeover here it is the information that
[39:10.160 --> 39:16.360]  I'm about to relay to you is the most grave that I've ever reported in my 21
[39:16.360 --> 39:25.480]  years on air it is so Armageddon in nature that I find it hard to believe
[39:25.480 --> 39:32.600]  this is actually happening in the year 2016 the United States hijacked by
[39:32.600 --> 39:40.560]  globalist forces has openly in the last week declared de facto war against
[39:40.560 --> 39:52.280]  Russia. The United States military will stop you and we will beat you harder
[39:52.280 --> 39:56.120]  than you've ever been beaten before. Russia's hacked into a lot of things
[39:56.120 --> 39:59.760]  China's hacked into a lot of things Russia even hacked into the Democratic
[39:59.760 --> 40:04.280]  National Committee we will be ready with serious political economic and
[40:04.280 --> 40:14.040]  military responses. The message they said that he'll know it and it will be at the time of our choosing and under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.
[40:14.040 --> 40:19.520]  Right now Senator for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us
[40:19.520 --> 40:23.880]  to go to war against Syria and Russia. I think it would be great if we got along with
[40:23.880 --> 40:28.160]  Russia because we could fight ISIS together as an example. We could slide
[40:28.160 --> 40:34.520]  into nuclear war very quickly from her declared policy in Syria so I won't sleep
[40:34.520 --> 40:38.320]  well at night if Donald Trump is elected but I sure won't sleep well at night if
[40:38.320 --> 40:41.840]  Hillary Clinton is elected. Future high-end war between nations dates and
[40:41.840 --> 40:47.080]  rape hours very highly lethal unlike anything our army has experienced at
[40:47.080 --> 40:55.480]  least since World War two. So a message is going to be sent with public note? I hope not.
[40:59.280 --> 41:04.200]  We're going to get to the de facto declaration of war and the preparations
[41:04.200 --> 41:09.680]  for physical war and what the head of the army says will have as high a casualty
[41:09.680 --> 41:15.800]  level as World War two in a moment but first the background that's undisputed
[41:15.800 --> 41:20.120]  Russia only has two military bases outside of its country it's not
[41:20.120 --> 41:24.240]  expansionist it's fighting radical Islam around the world and should be an ally
[41:24.240 --> 41:28.280]  of the United States and many of our top generals and admirals and others have
[41:28.280 --> 41:33.080]  been on record saying that fact the threat is radical Islam and China not
[41:33.080 --> 41:36.920]  Russia. I think it would be great if we get along with Russia because we could
[41:36.920 --> 41:40.680]  fight ISIS together as an example. The reason the globalists are so upset at
[41:40.680 --> 41:44.120]  Trump is they know he's being advised by the former head of defense
[41:44.120 --> 41:48.720]  intelligence general Flynn who exposed the fact that Obama and Hillary were
[41:48.720 --> 41:53.360]  expanding ISIS and al-Qaeda worldwide three years ago. You're basically saying
[41:53.360 --> 41:56.920]  that even in government at the time you knew those groups were around you saw
[41:56.920 --> 41:59.920]  this analysis and you were arguing against it but who wasn't listening? I
[41:59.920 --> 42:05.280]  think the I think administration. The administration turned a blind eye to your
[42:05.280 --> 42:08.360]  analysis. I don't know if they turned a blind eye I think it was a decision I
[42:08.360 --> 42:11.360]  think it was a willful decision. A willful decision to go supported in
[42:11.360 --> 42:14.520]  the insurgency that had Salafist al-Qaeda and a willful decision to do what
[42:14.520 --> 42:18.280]  they're doing. The multinational corporations that brag at the Davos
[42:18.280 --> 42:21.680]  Forum that they've hijacked Europe and the United States and many other
[42:21.680 --> 42:27.360]  Western countries are a multinational outside force basically taking over our
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.600]  nations and colonizing us with their world. When we come back it gets to the
[42:31.600 --> 42:34.440]  real meat and potatoes where they are announcing that they're going to launch
[42:34.440 --> 42:38.240]  a cyber war against Russia and a physical one and are basically telling the
[42:38.240 --> 42:41.720]  generals to prepare to start striking they've gone to defense condition three
[42:41.720 --> 42:45.480]  and the word is secretly to defense condition two but defense condition
[42:45.480 --> 42:50.720]  three is a 15-minute scramble readiness with the pilots waiting with the loaded
[42:50.720 --> 42:55.200]  bombers with the cruise missiles and the rest of it ready to go but there's been
[42:55.200 --> 42:58.840]  a new WikiLeaks everybody's freaking out about it's it's Hillary admitting that
[42:58.840 --> 43:03.200]  they're in command of ISIS. We're red on election day perhaps the biggest election
[43:03.200 --> 43:06.920]  in American history is just days away we know that in past elections there have
[43:06.920 --> 43:10.440]  been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election fraud from dead people
[43:10.440 --> 43:14.000]  voting to people registering false identifications to government leaders
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.440]  providing fast-track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes this is
[43:17.440 --> 43:20.920]  happening right in front of us now we are seeing the establishment send all its
[43:20.920 --> 43:24.120]  hitmen after the Republican nominee Donald Trump government chills are
[43:24.120 --> 43:27.680]  campaigning for Clinton mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day like
[43:27.680 --> 43:31.200]  rabbit hounds rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake
[43:31.200 --> 43:34.800]  optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from
[43:34.800 --> 43:38.800]  voting Trump fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms so with all
[43:38.800 --> 43:42.240]  this what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen what can we
[43:42.240 --> 43:45.800]  do to prevent election fraud I propose that all Donald Trump supporters wear
[43:45.800 --> 43:49.400]  red on election day on November 8th when you head to the polls to vote Donald
[43:49.400 --> 43:53.560]  Trump be decked out in red this way just as we dominated in rally turnout we can
[43:53.560 --> 43:57.360]  prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout wear red
[43:57.360 --> 44:02.000]  on election day and make America great again we're selling a product DNA force
[44:02.000 --> 44:07.760]  that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce about a group you took
[44:07.760 --> 44:11.400]  years for you to develop DNA force for us it's been something that I've been
[44:11.400 --> 44:15.960]  working on for a long time Alex because I think it's very very important what the
[44:15.960 --> 44:20.680]  aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our
[44:20.680 --> 44:25.320]  telomeres telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when
[44:25.320 --> 44:29.080]  it runs out you start dying we chose the PQQ because it has over a hundred and
[44:29.080 --> 44:33.280]  seventy five different clinical trials it's one of the most effective substances
[44:33.280 --> 44:37.360]  in the world it works like an antioxidant it works to repair nerve
[44:37.360 --> 44:41.920]  growth factor so this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount it's in

[47:34.680 --> 47:39.640]  declaring war against Russia trying to trick war Russia into a larger war to
[47:39.640 --> 47:43.000]  distract during the election this is so obvious here's the rest of the report
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.600]  they need to have an outside threat to fool nationalists to give up their
[47:47.600 --> 47:52.840]  sovereignty to globalism in the name of protecting nationalism that's why when
[47:52.840 --> 47:57.560]  the UK pulls out of the unelected dictatorial EU mainstream media claims
[47:57.560 --> 48:01.520]  the Russians are behind it that's why when Donald Trump and myself and others
[48:01.520 --> 48:06.320]  call for restoring our borders and doing better trade deals and not ceding our
[48:06.320 --> 48:11.840]  authority to the TPP they claim we're Russian agents because Russia itself is
[48:11.840 --> 48:16.640]  pulling out of the new world order the UK is doing it and so are we so if you're
[48:16.640 --> 48:21.040]  a foreign group taking a country over what do you do you start pointing fingers
[48:21.040 --> 48:24.840]  at the patriots internally who are trying to save the country and claim
[48:24.840 --> 48:29.720]  their foreign risky agents by mid-summer we had seen wiki leaks DC leaks and
[48:29.720 --> 48:34.360]  other organizations dump hundreds of thousands of pages of hacked emails on
[48:34.360 --> 48:38.400]  the web showing the organized crime operation going on between the
[48:38.400 --> 48:42.080]  Democrats the mainstream media and the foreign banks that literally own and
[48:42.080 --> 48:46.040]  control them so to divert the public from the crimes they'd committed they
[48:46.040 --> 48:50.120]  doubled down and said see the Russians are involved in taking over our
[48:50.120 --> 48:54.920]  elections and manipulating things but they showed no evidence by late August
[48:54.920 --> 48:59.400]  Hillary Clinton was 10 to 15 points in national polls behind Donald Trump they
[48:59.400 --> 49:03.920]  were panicking I began to see rumblings from the UN and the EU that they were
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.520]  going to send 10 times the number of observers they normally would to oversee
[49:08.520 --> 49:13.880]  our elections that's why I went on air and said we need to look at the attempt
[49:13.880 --> 49:17.760]  by Hillary to steal this election she stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders
[49:17.760 --> 49:21.640]  the sky's the limit Obama came out two weeks later and basically said I was
[49:21.640 --> 49:27.600]  crazy election fraud didn't exist then two weeks after that they announced that
[49:27.600 --> 49:32.080]  they were going to federalize the elections to keep them safe from right
[49:32.080 --> 49:37.320]  wingers and the Russians then on September 1st Democratic Party nominee
[49:37.320 --> 49:42.520]  goes on national television and says that if we think Russia has launched any
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.280]  type of cyber attack on the US that we'll launch a cyber attack on them and
[49:46.280 --> 49:53.200]  maybe even use physical military force you've seen reports Russia's hacked into
[49:53.200 --> 49:56.720]  a lot of things China's hacked into a lot of things Russia even hacked into the
[49:56.720 --> 50:03.560]  Democratic National Committee maybe even some state election systems so we've
[50:03.560 --> 50:08.000]  got to step up our game make sure we are well defended and able to take the
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.920]  fight to those who go after us as president I will make it clear that the
[50:13.920 --> 50:19.360]  United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be
[50:19.360 --> 50:26.000]  ready with serious political economic and military responses on cue for the
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  next month the leading story every night is that Russia is taking over the
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.880]  elections that Russia has spies everywhere and that Donald Trump works
[50:33.880 --> 50:39.000]  for them then on October 7th the director of national intelligence getting
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.200]  his information from the CIA comes out and says we know it's the Russians they
[50:44.200 --> 50:49.040]  have cyber attacked us officially but gave no evidence then a week later vice
[50:49.040 --> 50:53.800]  president Joe Biden in Mafioso style goes on meet the press and tells Russia
[50:53.800 --> 50:57.680]  we're gonna send you a message with a massive cyber attack we've got
[50:57.680 --> 51:02.440]  incredible capabilities we're going to show you we sent a message out to
[51:02.440 --> 51:12.200]  Putin we're sending a message we have a capacity to do it and the message
[51:12.200 --> 51:16.360]  he'll know it he'll know it and will be at the time of our choosing and under
[51:16.360 --> 51:21.800]  the circumstances that have the greatest impact the capacity to do to
[51:21.800 --> 51:27.720]  fundamentally all their election is not what people think and I tell you what to
[51:27.720 --> 51:34.560]  the extent that they do we will be proportional in what we do and so a
[51:34.560 --> 51:40.400]  message is going to be sent will the public know it hope not and this is
[51:40.400 --> 51:44.520]  where the critical bureaucratic declaration of war outside of
[51:44.520 --> 51:48.400]  Congress's authority comes in because we have the director of national
[51:48.400 --> 51:54.200]  intelligence we have the intelligence agency heads we have mrs. Clinton we
[51:54.200 --> 51:57.920]  have Joe Biden we have Obama meeting with top generals just two days ago
[51:57.920 --> 52:01.840]  talking about war with Russia in preparation and saying their new
[52:01.840 --> 52:09.720]  doctrine is if you cyber attack us we will cyber attack you and or both hit
[52:09.720 --> 52:14.520]  you with a military response in Hillary Clinton's own words and guess what
[52:14.520 --> 52:19.440]  that's the new NATO doctrine they announced a month ago that they may hit
[52:19.440 --> 52:24.960]  Russia first or if any cyber attacks any hacking of any type come from the
[52:24.960 --> 52:30.720]  massive country of Russia that they will take that as an act of war from any
[52:30.720 --> 52:35.920]  angle you look at we are now officially at war with Russia and this is
[52:35.920 --> 52:39.680]  surpassing anything that ever happened in the Cold War according to even main
[52:39.680 --> 52:45.360]  line analyst and we have proxy wars on the border of Russia in Ukraine and in
[52:45.360 --> 52:49.200]  Russia's backyard in Syria and we have top generals in Congress like the
[52:49.200 --> 52:52.560]  chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dumford saying look you're asking me to put up a
[52:52.560 --> 52:56.040]  no-fly zone and shoot down Russian aircraft they're going to attack us
[52:56.040 --> 53:01.520]  back that is an act of war right now senator for us to control all of the
[53:01.520 --> 53:06.480]  airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia
[53:06.480 --> 53:11.160]  in summation why is all of this happening well about a week ago general
[53:11.160 --> 53:16.000]  Milley the head of the army explained why if you try to have the Brexit or if
[53:16.000 --> 53:20.440]  Russia tries to pull out of the new world order or if patriots worldwide
[53:20.440 --> 53:25.760]  support the collapse of the EU because it's unelected our military working for
[53:25.760 --> 53:29.800]  the globalist will hit you harder than you've ever been hit before that's the
[53:29.800 --> 53:34.320]  message and Russia is being scapegoated for the unraveling of the new world
[53:34.320 --> 53:39.480]  order and world government the United States military despite all our
[53:39.480 --> 53:45.720]  challenges despite our op-tempo despite everything we've been doing will
[53:45.720 --> 53:51.120]  stop you and we'll beat you harder than you've ever been beaten before make no
[53:51.120 --> 53:56.720]  mistake about that other countries Russia China Iran and North Korea went to
[53:56.720 --> 54:02.440]  school on us they closely watched how we fought in 91 and 03 they studied our
[54:02.440 --> 54:06.360]  doctrine our tactics our equipment our organization our training and our
[54:06.360 --> 54:11.360]  leadership and in turn they revised their own doctrines and they are
[54:11.360 --> 54:17.160]  rapidly modernizing the military today to avoid our strengths in hopes of
[54:17.160 --> 54:22.960]  defeating us at some point in the future first not surprisingly is that will be
[54:22.960 --> 54:29.720]  highly lethal very highly lethal unlike anything our army has experienced at
[54:29.720 --> 54:35.360]  least since World War two the world is in global turmoil major banks are going
[54:35.360 --> 54:38.680]  under on a routine basis the biggest bank in Germany
[54:38.680 --> 54:42.960]  Deutsche Bank is teetering on the edge of collapse and will make the Lehman
[54:42.960 --> 54:48.680]  brothers look tame in comparison and historically when major collapses begin
[54:48.680 --> 54:54.640]  to happen countries and empires tend to start wars as a political distraction so
[54:54.640 --> 55:00.200]  they can blame the international financial crises on the war itself and
[55:00.200 --> 55:04.840]  not on their own failed policies and of course they want to influence the
[55:04.840 --> 55:08.400]  election here every globalist publication from the Washington Post to the
[55:08.400 --> 55:12.400]  Financial Times of London to the Economist admits that with Briggs it
[55:12.400 --> 55:16.120]  pulling out of the euro and with Russia pulling out of globalism what's
[55:16.120 --> 55:19.280]  happening here with nationalism and Trump they're on their last legs and
[55:19.280 --> 55:25.320]  they've got to prop Hillary up she is their Stalingrad she is their Waterloo
[55:25.320 --> 55:29.200]  if she falls there they believe in their own words their whole system will
[55:29.200 --> 55:32.640]  completely unravel well I got news for them it's already unraveling but they
[55:32.640 --> 55:37.440]  believe that if they can trick Russia into a physical war or cyberattack Russia
[55:37.440 --> 55:42.600]  and get Russia to respond back they can then pull false flags during the
[55:42.600 --> 55:47.440]  election and use that as an excuse to blame Russia for any election problems
[55:47.440 --> 55:52.080]  then Homeland Security has to come in to federalize it further to protect the
[55:52.080 --> 55:57.680]  vote the good news is across the political spectrum the intelligentsia is
[55:57.680 --> 56:02.120]  really waking up to the fact that we have a very dangerous criminal group in
[56:02.120 --> 56:06.440]  control of our country that wants to stay in control and who might even start a
[56:06.440 --> 56:11.360]  nuclear war to do so and that's why the head of the Green Party and others have
[56:11.360 --> 56:14.920]  come out and said that Hillary Clinton is much more dangerous than Donald Trump
[56:14.920 --> 56:19.000]  because she says that she wants a war with Russia she wants a war with Iran
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.440]  and others under Hillary Clinton we could slide into nuclear war very quickly
[56:24.440 --> 56:29.760]  from her declared policy in Syria so I won't sleep well at night if Donald
[56:29.760 --> 56:33.480]  Trump is elected but I sure won't sleep well at night if Hillary Clinton is
[56:33.480 --> 56:37.960]  elected the ball is now in your court history is repeating itself in a very
[56:37.960 --> 56:41.960]  very dangerous fashion the criminal elements that have hijacked our country
[56:41.960 --> 56:47.040]  are trying to start physical wars with Russia and others they're opening our
[56:47.040 --> 56:51.120]  borders up bringing in jihadis here to destabilize things as well they're
[56:51.120 --> 56:55.800]  taking over our election processes to quote protect it from the Russians even
[56:55.800 --> 57:00.000]  as they announced they're gonna launch a massive cyber attack against Russia in
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.240]  retaliation for something they can't even prove Russia did ladies and gentlemen
[57:05.240 --> 57:09.880]  this is a critical time probably one of those critical times in all of human
[57:09.880 --> 57:15.360]  history and development it's now time to hit a knee and start asking God to
[57:15.360 --> 57:19.000]  basically open more people's eyes up and that we would have peace on this
[57:19.000 --> 57:24.240]  planet and not thermal nuclear war the people are ready to be awakened please
[57:24.240 --> 57:28.320]  take this special report email it to members of Congress to local talk show
[57:28.320 --> 57:33.600]  host and the mainstream media and say it's time to wake up and turn this
[57:33.600 --> 57:39.920]  country and the world around from the brink of Armageddon
[57:41.000 --> 57:46.720]  tell folks tune in this pivotal election is now only 22 days out more

[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.720]  network and who's on the march folks that want a new enlightenment people that
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:22.080]  want a renaissance folks that want to have a system based on free will and
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:28.480]  free association every race color and creed who want true global peace but
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.120]  through diversity through sovereignty through the basic ideas of everybody
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:39.040]  from george washington to Martin Luther King jr. and what you see being pushed
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:45.040]  by the democrats is pure evil and of course the republican establishment is
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.760]  almost as bad I say almost because they've never been for 30 40 years really
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:55.080]  even real republicans they're just the second string of the democrats and now
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.760]  that entire power structure is against Donald j trump I'm live on the sunday
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.720]  edition I have never since I was probably 25 I was working 18 hours a day six
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.600]  days a week when I was 25 trying to launch this whole operation I've been
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.040]  on there about three four years but I wanted to go next level so for a few
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:15.520]  years I worked like this but I am back to my old ways I am up here seven days a
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:20.720]  week I am shooting out of bed at 6 a.m. because my kids get up real early
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.800]  hanging out with them a few hours and then I can't wait till this is all over
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.200]  hopefully things get more stable and then I can just get back to spend time
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.720]  with my family taking them out you know on the lake fishing hiking I mean I don't
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:38.080]  want to just be here doing this 18 hours a day but I have been working since
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.360]  9 a.m. this morning and I'm not complaining I mean I should be working
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.280]  more the problem is I just get exhausted before I went on there today I was
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.680]  just totally exhausted and I just sort of looking at the news issues again all
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.200]  sudden I was awake again so I'd been up here working all day and then as soon as
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.720]  I went back to look at the news I was exhausted and I was just like energized
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.480]  because I had all these stacks of news ready I was gonna cover because this is
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:06.720]  so incredible I mean my frustration is Tom Danhizer super great guy
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.120]  producer for Coast to Coast A.M. he sent me a text of a news article and he says
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:16.080]  is this real is this is this really happening this is like 20 minutes ago and
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:21.400]  I looked at it I don't know who you know this particular news site is there's so
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.480]  many but I know this came out in WikiLeaks earlier in the week but they
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:31.800]  did have a better headline than we did when we put it out it was this is a USA
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:36.440]  supreme.com because all these great independent journals now you just go
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.880]  through the WikiLeaks you put them out we wrote about this earlier in the week
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:44.520]  when this is like three weeks ago and you know we're just like yes this
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:48.440]  confirms that Hillary and the globalist we're running you know Al Qaeda and it's
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.640]  proxy war and we had General Flynn tell us this year as I go we told everybody
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.040]  before Flynn did I mean I'm not bragging it's just we had all the sources from
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:58.640]  Colonel Shaffer to other unnamed sources I'll just leave it at that Tosh Plumlee you
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:04.640]  name it but this is the fact this went on and so it's like oh my gosh it's over
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:08.520]  Hillary's ISIS email just leaked and it's worse than anyone could imagine see
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:14.280]  I could never come up with a headline that good I just dig out the data and
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:19.240]  know how the system works I would just say confirmed Hillary running ISIS in
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:25.440]  emails but I should have say things like it's over Hillary's chief of staff
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.480]  calls Americans dumb says let's keep them in the dark and let's create race war
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:33.240]  you know it's stuff like that people actually care about and go read I said
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.400]  we're just so dry about it and I tell my writers listen we got to be more
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.240]  sensational because when they say they're ready for nuclear war the Russia
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.320]  they're gonna physically attack them and launch a cyber attack and then Russia's
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.920]  gonna respond and it's gonna mess up the election that is sensational there
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:53.040]  aren't words to come up with and so they accuse me of being dangerous they had
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.600]  the Hillary chief of staff come out and say that and you know all of them the
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:02.600]  last few days you people are dangerous listen if you were just boss hogging it
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.280]  and giving your family jobs and stuff and doing the regular things I would
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:10.920]  oppose it and I'd criticize you but I wouldn't be absolutely foaming at the
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:20.240]  mouth with my eyes bugging out coming up against you is that Hillary's website
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.200]  Hillary's Facebook has a video saying this is Alex Jones I'm like the main
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.360]  thing they're attacking now again because they know if you go with it it
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:33.040]  beats them so they have to pick me as the straw man demonize who I am act like
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:37.880]  I'm discredited in a con game oh look this is kooky ha ha I work for the
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:43.080]  Chinese government when the email say so ha ha I run ISIS ha ha see how they

[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.440]  going to be war with Russia but there's already a proxy war in Syria and in
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:00.200]  North Africa in Libya and in many other areas like Ukraine but regardless they
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.280]  are scapegoating Russia for this election and preparing to manipulate the
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:08.840]  election and are cyber attacking Russia and I think it's gonna be a false flag
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.520]  where Russia doesn't strike back because Russia has really been very very smart
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:17.120]  about this and then they basically say Russia disrupts things just look for that
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:22.040]  now by us exposing it they may be forced to back off this analysis all
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.640]  clicked for me the last few days and I did yesterday call some of my really
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:30.160]  smart sources and they said of course that's what's going on yes yes yes we
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:34.680]  know that I mean it's not that Trump follows what I say Trump gets it I want
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.040]  to play some clips of Trump in a moment but I want to point out Jill Stein the
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.440]  Green Party leader who's a real liberal remember those folks you disagree with
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.760]  them on some things but on most of you agreed with them like the Iraq war being
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.480]  about out here and stuff and you know Trump said that too didn't get credit
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.320]  even though we have six clips of him saying it before it happened well three
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.280]  before and three right after it started they just line up lester holt go no you
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:02.000]  didn't you were never used to a record such route see that's how dumb they
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.960]  think you are and that's in the emails they think you're dumb
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.640]  Trump doesn't think you're dumb she said don't waste your vote on corporate
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.280]  Democrats who betray you the Democrats are getting two to one corporate
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:15.960]  contributions according to the federal elections Commission just Google that then
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:19.640]  any Republican candidate on average just just double the big money wants
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:24.320]  Democrats divide and conquer race war dumb down idiots that's what they want
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:31.400]  big third-world slum now that's all the Roman Empire control people the
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.600]  Republican Party is horrible but they've proved themselves failures by letting
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.240]  Trump take over so they're really in the doghouse Trump has basically gotten zero
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:44.600]  corporate money he out collects 20 to 1 small donations or more that Hillary
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.720]  gets that's in the news today what an endorsement of Trump and Jill Stein to
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:53.840]  her credit after watching Bernie Sanders be robbed I mean I don't agree with a
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.240]  lot of stuff he says but you know a lot of the problems he talks about a real
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.840]  solutions are bad I mean she stole the nomination Stanford University certified
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:05.600]  that they admit it's winning by landslides California you name it she
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:11.720]  cannot said don't waste it absolutely how could Democrats go along with something
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.840]  that persecutes the press launches all these wars funds al-Qaeda is a horrible
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.280]  person and then tells big corporations behind closed doors of course I'm for
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.040]  TPP I helped write that that's all the new emails but the last data dump was
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.880]  big the new one is of course I'd going to ram through TPP and transfer a US
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:35.760]  sovereignty to multinationals I helped write it the question they go you're
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:40.640]  saying you're against it she's like what the hell's your problem so here is
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:45.560]  Jill Stein very powerful clip extremism grows out of the policies of the
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:50.360]  Clintons in particular NAFTA which sent our jobs overseas and Wall Street
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:55.400]  deregulation which blew nine million jobs up into smoke so that's what's
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:59.440]  creating this right-wing extremism a vote for Hillary Clinton isn't going to
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:05.320]  fix it and one last point which is this that it's now Hillary Clinton who wants
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:11.120]  to start an air war with Russia over Syria by calling for a no-fly zone we
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.720]  have 2,000 nuclear missiles on her trigger alert and Mikhail Gorbachev the
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:19.960]  former premier of the Soviet Union is saying we are closer to a nuclear war
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:25.160]  than we have ever been under Hillary Clinton we could slide into nuclear war
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:31.080]  very quickly from her declared policy in Syria so I won't sleep well at night if
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.720]  Donald Trump is elected but I sure won't sleep well at night if Hillary
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.880]  Clinton is elected fortunately we have another choice other than these two
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:43.360]  candidates who are both promoting lethal policies but on the issue of war and
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.720]  nuclear weapons and the potential for nuclear war it's actually Hillary's
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:52.760]  policies which are much scarier than Donald Trump who does not want to go to
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:57.440]  war with Russia he wants to seek modes of that's right when Russia is doing
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:01.320]  nothing China and others are the big issue and I find no fault what she said
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.720]  Trump's wrong on torture at least he's honest about he goes we're already doing
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.120]  it we're in torture ISIS he just doesn't get that once you do it on one bad
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:10.880]  group then it's everybody you just can't do it but at least he's honest
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:15.440]  he's wrong about because he's not a tech guy hey the iPhone they got a warrant
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.920]  they killed people in San Bernardino let him into the damn phone find out what
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:23.600]  the other terrorist are I agree crack that phone they weren't asking for that
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.520]  phone they're asking for the master key which they already have they just want
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.680]  capitulated so they'll get in trouble in court and then Obama blocked the FBI
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.600]  from stopping them two years before anyways so Trump is wrong on a few
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.080]  issues but he means well with Hillary it's a whole nother universe a whole

[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:45.760]  close to three decades Kathy O'Brien has said that Hillary Clinton raped her in a
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:52.520]  satanic ritual now when I first met Kathy O'Brien 20 years ago I hadn't yet
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:57.400]  snuck into bohemian grove I hadn't covered skull and bones I really wasn't
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:04.120]  aware of the fact that secret societies are still operating but what happens is
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:11.000]  just like let's say in the Mexican mafia or the white supremacists gangs that are
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:17.840]  out there you have to go out and say kill an old lady at a liquor store or go
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.560]  knock somebody over the head who's innocent to become a made member of
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:26.400]  the group you've got to commit crimes where you can be compromised and they
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:32.200]  declassified in the 70s that a doctor Ewing Cameron had more than 20,000
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:38.520]  children in Canada and the US kidnapped for the exact same type of sex abuse that
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:44.320]  Kathy O'Brien talks about now I've had dinner with her and her husband I have
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.680]  met them on several occasions and I believe only had him on the show one
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:53.480]  time and that's because because they can't totally prove it I didn't want to
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:58.880]  go there and I faced a lot of criticism over the years not going there but now
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:02.320]  they've got all these women coming out against Trump with oh he held my hand
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:05.600]  on this or did this on an airplane witnesses are all coming out saying
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:09.360]  it's not true they've got Carlos Slim the Mexican kingpin and this foreign
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:15.760]  chic financing all this so you guys are gonna play like that I mean we know who
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:21.000]  Hilary's girlfriends are it's only matter of time somebody breaks in their house
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:28.240]  and gets the porno movies you people think we can just hack stuff you think
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:33.600]  you're gonna play with America people too much longer here I'm not saying I'm
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:40.840]  gonna do that but the operators are we're not gonna let you destroy this
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:44.560]  country lady I saw her today in some brief events she attended she looked
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:49.240]  like she was dying and she's emblematic of this whole corrupt system and she's
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:52.360]  got me front and center on her website because they're more afraid of what we
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.200]  cover anything else because we understand their game plan there's a
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:59.280]  criminal global conspiracy against this country we have it very goldwater
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.720]  exposed it 50 years ago because he was in the Senate committee meetings when
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:08.280]  they admitted it with the Carnegie endowment so we'll get Kathy O'Brien on
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:16.760]  this week who mark Phillips will do that and we'll go back into Bohemian
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:20.200]  Grove and skull and bones and everything else for you because I've met with her
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:24.320]  repeatedly and I think she's credible and the whole story is exactly how they
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:29.080]  operate but regardless your fair game now Hilary you want to go there we'll go
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:32.840]  there Hillary Clinton's child rape bombshell we're gonna play that it's
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:39.840]  video coming up in the last segment tonight gloves are off lady gloves are
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.640]  off you start World War three gloves are off I gotta preserve my children's
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:48.680]  future and that means all children's future she don't have an Achilles heel
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.680]  where you could just threaten my children's I care about everybody's
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:57.920]  children now I also quite literally don't have my right Achilles heel it's now
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:03.200]  80% blown I'm gonna have surgery soon but that which doesn't kill you only
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:07.480]  makes you stronger everybody's freaking out because they're finally getting into
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.720]  the last week's emails and these new ones were they're admitting that ISIS and
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.520]  al-Qaeda are being run by the West and flooded by Saudi Arabia and it's a proxy
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:18.840]  army and they know all the rebels are ISIS and al-Qaeda I mean folks back
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:22.000]  before this was a campaign issue when we made an issue so they hate us because
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.960]  we break the bar bar first we we hit first so all the other cowards can come
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:28.880]  after us I'm not bragging it's just a fact that's our tactic not about me
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:34.760]  winning me surviving any of this it's about defeating you but I mean they had
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:38.160]  counsel and farm relations three years ago with the headline why we need al-Qaeda
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.680]  in Syria then the public freaked out so they flipped the name to ISIS but
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:46.080]  everybody's freaking out now it's over Hillary's ISIS email just leaked and
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.000]  it's worse than anyone can imagine where she admits it all and admits they're
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.720]  backing it of course they were I mean I had Colonel Schaefer on one week after
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:01.640]  Benghazi and he laid out the whole plan and then he got called in and chewed out
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.680]  and the next time I got him on with six months later we got to get Schaefer on
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.680]  kissed his ass whatever he's a great guy he gets reamed when he comes on
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:13.960]  but he's such a patriot and I had him on I go yeah I just heard Congress is
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:17.360]  admitting having closed hearings on the fact that most the rebels are al-Qaeda
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.760]  and he goes on air he goes well yes I was just there briefing him three hours
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.840]  ago that mean that was him giving the secret briefing this he was the former
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:27.760]  head of the al-Qaeda desk for the army we got sources even more high-level than
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:33.000]  Schaefer but it's just everybody's like Alex did you hear Hillary runs al-Qaeda
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.800]  she runs a really did you hear Donald Trump six months ago say she founded it I
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.320]  mean all I'm telling you is we don't want the credit but do you understand we
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:45.480]  don't just come up with like rhetoric like it'll sound bad to say she founded
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:51.920]  ISIS no she did so we say it it's all I've gots that I'm real people need to
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:56.720]  understand a world of liars this one ain't it okay I had a reporter in here
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:00.640]  love them to death earlier this week and I'd retracted that we read the email
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:04.360]  wrong you could see how we'd read it wrong Paul with the article out saying
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:09.240]  that you know Hillary hates to say you know real Americans and that's how it
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.480]  reads but they spun it back and said no we mean she hates to use that cliche
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.120]  term I said fair enough maybe we're wrong in our interpretation the
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.520]  reporter said I don't care they're lying about us I'm gonna use it I said no
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:25.480]  you're not we don't do that and that's the real danger here is folks you cannot
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:31.040]  look into the abyss and become it you've got to understand you dance with the
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.960]  devil he don't change you change and I'm not sitting up here on some high
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.440]  horse about credibility the real power isn't telling the truth now I'm gonna go
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.920]  to a few clips we go to break longer segment coming up because here's Donald
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:45.720]  Trump and this is why they're so scared this is why they're so upset I just had
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.520]  my video list here oh here it is talking about the New World Order top my global
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:52.920]  conspiracy some of the press is in it against us it's in the new emails that
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:56.600]  came out this week and more today her meeting with global corporations selling
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:02.720]  out our sovereignty that's what this is so let's go ahead and play Donald Trump
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:08.960]  here it is the Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure we've
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:13.880]  seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:20.600]  in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:26.360]  order to enrich these global financial powers her special interest friends and
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:37.160]  her donors directly out of general Flynn I think really hate us so true Russia

[01:27:49.160 --> 01:28:06.760]  is that it honestly she should be locked up and likewise the email show that the
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:11.640]  Clinton machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to the media
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:20.640]  organizations that she they have their own people in there that she listen to
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:28.680]  this is given the questions and answers in advance of her debate performance with
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:32.560]  Bernie Sanders and it's still ongoing it's all rigged the media is an
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:36.800]  conspiracy against the American people Hillary Clinton is also given approval

[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:56.960]  would actually appear that Obamacare is a disaster so why do Democrats praise it
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:01.120]  as a success because it was meant to implode

[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:13.680]  known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.640]  the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:21.880]  fluoride the bad member of the halogen family in the water they took the good
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:26.840]  halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as

[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:31.640]  white house talking point or Hillary talking point and I put it in and then if I see
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:35.720]  three four thousand articles on Google news I know it was a talking point they
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:40.400]  only do that when it's a talking point alex jones Matt drudge insane there's
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:45.200]  no domestic drone program in the US there never will be thousands of
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:49.120]  newspapers like three four years ago I searched it saw thousands TV stations you
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.080]  name it went on for weeks and then I had all the local news as they were
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:58.040]  launching drones surveilling farmers and ranchers you name it see it's a formula
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:03.120]  when they launch something they then come out and say people talking about
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:08.640]  her liars show that locals hear that they see it and then they go oh I'm supposed
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:12.120]  to shut up about this I better go along with the establishment what do you have
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:16.200]  to gain doing that now they have drones at football games watching everybody now
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:20.320]  they admit they're watching all the farmers everything but the border and I
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:24.000]  just use that as a case point because I saw this article Friday my phone starts
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.480]  ringing at night they go the white house spokesman just attacked you and so did
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:30.040]  the Hillary spokesperson in there they're saying you're dangerous so I go
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:33.880]  look at it up and it's just thousands of articles you know just oh my gosh
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:38.800]  Trump and Alex Jones and Steve Bannon are anti-Semitic and they're claiming
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:43.840]  there's foreign mega banks in control because that's in all the emails who said
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:48.920]  anything about Jews I mean Israel's super diverse like seven eight different
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:53.080]  political parties liberals conservatives just like us I mean yeah there's some
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.120]  Jews international banking the Rothschilds are famous for it it's like
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:00.560]  mafia but I mean because the Italians have some mafia or all Italians bad I
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:04.640]  mean you know because there's some redneck you know East Texas people that
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:07.480]  might be races does that mean I'm my dad's from East Texas he's bad no I mean
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:10.720]  you're the ones bringing all this stuff in but there's the Washington Post
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:16.880]  Donald Trump says there's a global conspiracy against him no we just played
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:21.960]  part of the speech I watched the whole speech in Florida he said there's a
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:26.640]  conspiracy against you by the press it's corporate it's multinational well of
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:31.360]  course it is it's in the WikiLeaks but you don't need to have WikiLeaks to know
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:36.240]  that I mean the one-sidedness the spinning the pulse let me give you a
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:43.480]  newsflash I've been involved in the news and researching things for 25 years 21
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:52.760]  years on air and change and I've never seen polling companies like Reuters and
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:59.360]  all the big ones Bloomberg do stuff like they'll have a list of phones they're
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:02.040]  calling and things where they know they're actually more Democrats to spend
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:05.320]  stuff and you can actually kind of pay for the polls you want I mean it's famous
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:09.640]  I've commissioned polls they wouldn't even let me do reasonable polls a lot of
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:12.520]  these companies they just wanted to manipulate it the way they wanted to an
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:16.000]  agenda where I was paying them 10 grand or 20 grand or whatever it was the case
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.480]  was and then they would get what they wanted you look those polls up on 9 11
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:26.400]  stuff like that who folks thought was behind it but when they put in the
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.080]  sampling and I know I got all this hundreds of articles I mean why am I
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:34.480]  going back to this because folks when Reuters and Bloomberg and Politico
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:40.360]  sample between 7 and 53 percent that's the highest number I've seen more
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:45.960]  Democrats than Republicans in an online poll in a phone poll or in a focus group
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:51.680]  poll do I have to explain to people how that's rigged if you got 7% more
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:55.320]  Democrats you're sampling you're gonna get higher percentages of Democrats
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:04.600]  saying they're voting for Hillary do you go up to 50 something percent and the
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:08.960]  average ones like 15 points they're adding it'd be like if you went to the
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:11.600]  old-fashioned grocery store those of you young enough to remember sometimes they
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:16.120]  weigh the vegetables or the meat right there at the counter some small town and
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:19.120]  a lot of you probably aren't old enough to remember that I was a little bitty when
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:21.920]  the last time I saw that little bitty place my grandma would stop sometimes
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:24.440]  you want to go all the way to town a little grosser had some meat and stuff
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:28.120]  on the counter and they'd you'd get what you wanted but you're giving to you and
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.840]  then they take the front and they'd weigh it right there and just look at a
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.040]  sheet and charge you that imagine if you walked up to waste say two pounds of
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:39.280]  hamburger meat and they put their thumb all the way on it and put it extra two
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.320]  pounds on you'd say hey I'm up paying for four pounds that's two pounds it's the
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:48.400]  same thing and they do it over and over and over again in front of her by I'm
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:53.120]  just like is this a joke I mean is the public really this dumb that they can't
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:58.680]  click on the methodology of a poll and find out that Hillary's really 30 40
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:01.960]  points behind according to this then I ask is it possible she's that far behind
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:05.840]  because if they're sampling that many more it would she has 200 people at her
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:11.720]  average crowd Trump has 40,000 the Google Analytics show he's got 25 times no
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:16.200]  excuse me 2,500 times more people searching his stuff the nurse I mean
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:21.800]  it's a joke people I don't know the full numbers I know Trump internal polls and
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:24.640]  other polls that are internal with these companies because other groups actually
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.760]  want real polls as well not just the fake ones they want to really know what's
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:30.720]  happening to have a site picture that Trump is 10 to 15 points ahead he's
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:34.960]  always been and it looks like it's worse it looks like this sex stuff backfired
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:39.280]  and the numbers I'm getting are they're completely panicking right now and I've
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:45.200]  got Axel Rod saying she shouldn't attend the debate Wednesday I've got the
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:49.960]  Washington Post that is the CIA I mean it is the worst element of the CIA it is
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:56.440]  the mouth of the New World Order saying Hillary really did rob people in Haiti
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:02.040]  or maybe everybody in the media is finally going my god who are we really
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:09.720]  putting all in for this woman is a complete demon so that's where we stand
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:13.720]  right now but I'm telling you I'm seeing a major and I don't do like they do
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:16.880]  announce everyone's fleeing Hillary like to do everyone's fleeing Trump to
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.640]  create a mass hysteria and then create like the secret I say it so it becomes
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:26.360]  no no I wouldn't tell you this if Hillary was ahead I would tell you she's
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:32.840]  way behind and they're panicking and the whole world hates her every real
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:37.320]  liberal from Assange to the head of the Green Party Jill Stein to you name it
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:45.080]  is like Hillary Clinton is a demon Bill says she works like a demon Assange
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:49.760]  says she's a demon I tell you she's a demon I talked to one of Bill Clinton's
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:56.560]  famous girlfriends the constant lawyer she was in here Dolly Kyle last week and
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:01.320]  she hadn't heard me say how bad ported according to Secret Service in military
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:05.680]  how bad Hillary stinks I mean that just comes up they go and my god I've never
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:08.960]  smelled somebody stinks about a sir and then Dolly Kyle brings up how she was
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:12.560]  the stinkiest woman she's ever been around smells like dead fish I mean I
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.480]  don't know what the hell's going on I'm just reporting this stuff people Alex
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:19.840]  shows vindicated Bill's former lover confirms Hillary smells awful I mean I
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:23.480]  don't they had a big national story out of that the president attacked me over
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:26.480]  it I like Bill reportedly doesn't smell bad
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:31.040]  Obama smells like you know what I said like sulfur that's not what I was told
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:36.160]  like like like a latrine I was told he smells like you know what and I tried to
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:40.200]  use a nice term for it so let me just correct you the full truth on them by
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:44.480]  the truth so help me God he smells like a pile of you know what and if they want
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:47.160]  to run with that they think that'll hold their constituents oh look at the
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:52.440]  enemy that's all they've got all I've got you people want say we like our
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.840]  doctor we can keep it and laugh at us and say thank God we're stupid I got
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.040]  plenty of meat potatoes to attack you on all day long you people are criminals
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:06.960]  but they've got a con game up there that they're so confident they're so
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:11.960]  confident uh-huh no they're attacking what scares them the most and every time
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:16.000]  Trump goes hard he went soft first debate lost like five points in real
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.200]  polls maybe more he went hard boosted blasted all-time high they're panicking
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:25.360]  don't go to other debate Hillary because it's the truth it's not attacking
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:28.920]  when it's true it's not attacking when she's a bully that turned al-qaeda loose
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:33.200]  all over the world to kill Christians it's the truth and I noticed the trolls
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.720]  on info wars the Soros people they admit she's spending hundreds of millions to
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:43.040]  go out and trolling all this but the other folks aren't trolls they're just
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:46.120]  people that it's a small minority folks but they want to believe I want to reach
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:48.880]  out to them because I care about you that you're a winner because you never
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:52.480]  choose a side I didn't choose a side with McCain and Obama because it was
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:55.800]  pretty obvious I held my nose with Romney but knew he was just basically
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:01.000]  taking a fall I didn't put any energy into that with Trump the entire enemy is
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.840]  against him I know his advisors are patriots I know he listens to people he
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:12.040]  understands what's going on and of course I've become Trump vision this is
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:15.560]  an I was all for the Brexit I'm all for Russia getting out from under the New
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:21.560]  World Order this is a critical battle for sovereignty and humanity worldwide this
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:25.240]  is history happening I want to come back and play another Trump clip and then
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:28.280]  again which clip about this who by the way I don't like interest be saying true
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:31.240]  stuff so I'll play it but I'll give the provides though I mean he was a Rockefeller

[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:56.200]  couple minutes from a Kathy O'Brien interview that she did 15 plus years
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:01.560]  ago she's been on this broadcast a long time ago you know she says that Hillary
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:06.320]  Clinton raped and abused her and I know that Hillary has a very shorted twisted
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:11.680]  past a lot of credible people have asked me to have her on so I'm looking to do
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.200]  that but that's coming up here in a few minutes you know they're having people
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.240]  with no proof absolutely no proof it's gonna make up all these wild things about
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:21.120]  Trump so I never really went there with O'Brien but you want us to you want to
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:26.320]  play by those rules we will but speaking of Trump talking about this
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:29.640]  conspiracy the media says it's one against him no no he's saying it's
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:32.360]  against the American people it is it's criminal interest over the country I've
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:36.680]  been selling off the greatest country the world ever saw and then telling us
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:40.280]  that it's the best time we've ever seen Obama says our economies the best has
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:43.960]  ever been well I guess it's for him living like a king while he tells other
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:47.920]  people they can't have air conditioning and cars here's a Trump again Friday
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:56.280]  powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media the press
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:08.240]  let's be clear on one thing the corporate media in our country is no
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:16.360]  longer involved in journalism they're a political special interest no different
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:22.480]  than any lobbyist or other financial entity with a total political agenda and
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:34.760]  the agenda is not for you it's for themselves notice and their agenda is to
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:42.440]  elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any cost at any price no matter how many
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:53.080]  lives they destroy and CNN come out and order and for them to not play any of
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:57.360]  the Trump speeches the order is don't let producers get clips they want but
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:00.800]  don't show any of what Trump's saying meanwhile you have to go to foreign press
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:04.720]  to actually find what's going on and what's unfolding the big weekday shows

[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:30.440]  just admitting they're breaking the law to whatever they want I mean it's just
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:39.440]  crazy folks these people are crazy but right now I want to get to this
[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:46.240]  Kathy O'Brien club this is a lady who for decades and says she was abused by
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:49.960]  government officials as part of a CIA program well the doctor Ewing Cameron
[01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:53.320]  program she talks about grabbed more than 20,000 children in the US and
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:57.080]  Canada he set up CIA substations all over the US and Canada where they grab
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:59.760]  kids out of their back yard you name it or kids will be brought in for a
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.960]  neurological problem they tell the parents we're taking them into state
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:06.840]  custody then they would be reprogrammed drug given new identities and then sit
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:10.600]  out of sex bots when they were young girls we're talking five six seven eight
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:14.520]  years old rape brutally you name it and she always said that Hillary Clinton
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:19.640]  you know attacked her and so I think you have a right to see this I know Kathy
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:23.160]  O'Brien she has a lot of what looks like damage in her eyes I think she's a very
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:26.400]  credible person I believe she believes what she's saying so she has a right to
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:32.200]  be heard so here is a Hillary Clinton a reported sexual attack victim Kathy
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:39.160]  O'Brien 1978 and it was determined that I had endured sufficient trauma to carry
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:45.400]  out my first trial run operation an enormous quantity of cocaine had been
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:49.160]  flown in on one of these operations that was to deliver it into the neighboring
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:55.040]  state of Arkansas by that time Bill Clinton's drug operation was in full
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:55:00.480]  swing he was governor of Arkansas and I delivered this cocaine to a remote
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:06.640]  airport in Washington Forest which I've since identified as Mina Airport I also
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:13.480]  delivered a little packet of information and a small quantity of cocaine a
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:18.920]  personal stash from J. Bennett Johnston to Bill Clinton I delivered it to Bill
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:24.920]  Clinton and he cut out two lines of the coke and he did inhale
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:33.360]  otherwise CIA bases confirmed it wasn't the only time I saw Bill Clinton using
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:39.880]  cocaine my sexual experience with Bill Clinton was extremely limited in spite
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:46.280]  of the fact that I was a sex slave was my experience the Bill Clinton is
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:51.200]  bisexual leaning far more towards a homosexual and all I've ever seen him
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:57.280]  involved in was the homosexual activity with very limited experience with him
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:02.840]  myself whereas my experience was much more prevalent with Hillary Clinton
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:07.840]  because Hillary is also bisexual leaning more towards a homosexual and it
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:19.160]  was she who accessed my sex programming to fulfill her perversions now they had
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:22.160]  these programs and this is when the programs were going on this is a
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:27.200]  congressional hearings were in the 70s all I'm telling you is you want to make
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.480]  up stuff about Donald Trump which has come out in the news has been fake we're
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:34.680]  going to go to more credible folks and bring this information out so there you
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:38.360]  go and there's more I'm going to post a full interview up on info wars calm
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:41.760]  there's a lot of other clips I wanted to get to a lot of the things to cover
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:44.840]  obviously the economy one big reason they want war with Russia isn't just the
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:48.520]  election Deutsche Bank as we told you six seven months ago it's on the verge of
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:51.760]  collapse now they say that's imminent that's mainstream news now again how
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:55.000]  many times we have to be right about Hillary running al Qaeda and ISIS
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  Deutsche Bank getting ready to go belly up the the military being trained to
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.480]  confiscate firearms that's kind of military's bad they're being given the
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:07.360]  illegal orders they're the reason we know about it they play these games they
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:10.480]  go you like the military know the military is more awake than public the
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:14.520]  point is this is all going on National Guard armories are being stocked armored
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:17.720]  vehicles are being rolled in this is in local news all over the country big
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:20.840]  things are happening we need to be involved more than ever to make sure
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:24.360]  there's an awakening and the globalists aren't able to carry this out we're
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:28.080]  trying to get our sovereignty back like the UK and Russia and others are trying
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:31.280]  that's why we're being demonized and attacked also important remember they
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:34.120]  want to shut this down spread the word about this broadcast the videos the
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:37.680]  audio of the show info wars.com and get the Hillary for prison shirt limited
