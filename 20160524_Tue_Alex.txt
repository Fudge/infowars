[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.000 --> 00:25.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25.000 --> 00:32.000]  I just got off the phone with Roger Stone, he has got huge news, the biggest ever, just gets bigger every time.
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.000]  He's down, he's gonna be down here by the way, next week in studio with us. Wargaming, a lot of stuff.
[00:37.000 --> 00:44.000]  It is, of course, Tuesday the 24th of May 2016. We'll be here for the next four hours.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  A lot of big guests today, including Roger Stone.
[00:47.000 --> 00:50.000]  Look at DrudgeReport.com if you're a TV viewer.
[00:50.000 --> 00:57.000]  Vince Foster lives, resurrected by Trump's incredible courage. Trump launches a new line of attack.
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  When I talked to Stone just a few minutes ago, he just got off the phone with Trump.
[01:01.000 --> 01:09.000]  In a long conversation, Stone was so energized. Absolutely energized, just saying, this guy has got so much courage.
[01:09.000 --> 01:16.000]  And wait till what he does next. He has the Clintons, well, you know what, they're in their pants.
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  I mean, this is beautiful to see somebody stand up against these bullies and go toe to toe.
[01:21.000 --> 01:27.000]  It's amazing. We're gonna talk VP for Trump and more today. It's huge.
[01:27.000 --> 01:35.000]  But first, a very important report to show how stupid Bernie Sanders supporters are out on the West Coast with Mark Dice.
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  Just getting people's comments on Bernie Madoff now being chosen by Bernie Sanders to be his VP.
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.000]  I got nothing for you.
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  I'm sticking your shirt. Yeah, I did your shirt though.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  Here, let me give you some stickers.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  I'm loving you.
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  Oh, can I get one of those? You want to switch? Yeah.
[01:56.000 --> 02:04.000]  Bernie Sanders bringing Bernie Madoff aboard as his vice presidential pick to, you know, sort of help clean up Wall Street.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  Good idea, you think? I think it's a good idea.
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  Madoff kind of knows Wall Street insider, former Wall Street insider himself, so now it looks like it'll be Bernie Bernie,
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  which is kind of unique as well. All the burns. You think that's a good idea? I'll say so, sure.
[02:18.000 --> 02:23.000]  Bernie Sanders just announced his vice presidential choice, Bernie Madoff, the Wall Street wizard.
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  So now it's Bernie Bernie, 2016, just getting people's comments.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  Good idea, choosing Bernie Madoff as his running mate.
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  I heard, I don't know Bernie Madoff, but one person told me about him and said, good thing.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  So if he's as good as the person says, then I'm all for it.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  You trusted Bernie's decision, right?
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  From what I heard, what I was told by this person about what Bernie's about, I'm all for it.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  Okay, Bernie Madoff, the Wall Street wizard. So now it's going to be Bernie Bernie, 2016.
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  Good choice picking Bernie Madoff as his VP, even though they have the same first name.
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  I think it's, yeah, it's pretty cool. It's pretty badass.
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.000]  Yeah.
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  Just getting people's opinions on whether that's going to help his candidacy.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  Do you think that'll give him a little boost in the polls?
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  I think financial advisor is probably a good thing. Everyone's worried about the economy.
[03:14.000 --> 03:15.000]  Hold on.
[03:15.000 --> 03:16.000]  So everyone's worried about the economy.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  So it's having someone with a strong background in finance would be good for his campaign.
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  Madoff has decades of knowledge of financial advising and insider knowledge.
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  So I think this was a good idea basically to bring him aboard as Bernie Sanders VP.
[03:30.000 --> 03:31.000]  I think so.
[03:31.000 --> 03:34.000]  Yeah. Having a strong finance background, that's what we're all looking for.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  So you're feeling the burn even more now?
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.000]  Feeling the burn.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  It's Bernie Bernie 2016 now, now that it's Bernie Sanders and Bernie Madoff.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  Oh, there you go. Yeah.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  Okay.
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  All right. Well, thanks for your thoughts.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.000]  No problem.
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  Bernie's coming to town tomorrow.
[03:46.000 --> 03:47.000]  Yeah.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  And he also has announced his VP pick Bernie Madoff.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  So the Wall Street wizard.
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  Madoff is no good.
[03:54.000 --> 03:55.000]  Oh.
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  Bernie, okay.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  We got to talk to the millennials.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  Anybody over the age of like 30, then their brain starts to function properly.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  Yeah.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  Bernie Sanders has enough faith in Bernie Madoff to bring him aboard and officially endorse
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  him as his VP.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  You think that's probably still a good idea.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  I mean, you still support Bernie, right?
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.000]  Yeah.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  I would assume from his other policies that he knows what he's talking about bringing
[04:19.000 --> 04:20.000]  Madoff aboard.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  Obviously, he's quite familiar with his, you know, financial history and everything he's
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.000]  done.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  So just checking to see if people think it's a good idea or if you were going to flip
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  over and support Hillary because of the Bernie Madoff issue.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  Still support Bernie.
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.000]  Oh, yeah.
[04:33.000 --> 04:34.000]  Okay.
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.000]  But Bernie has announced his VP.
[04:35.000 --> 04:36.000]  Right now.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  Full reports up on drudgereport.com and of course infowars.com.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  Mark Dice doing a great job of markdice.com.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  Of course, if you're a new viewer or maybe a fake intellectual liberal and you're tuning
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.000]  in for the first time and Bernie Madoff or the most famous swindlers and Ponzi scheme
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  operators in history and was probably murdered in prison and stole over $10 billion and these
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.000]  people just act like pseudo-intellectuals.
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.000]  During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, a Hillary Clinton supporter stood up and urged Hillary
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  to take on the NRA.
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  We need you to be able to use your executive powers, the legislate that you can't carry
[05:14.000 --> 05:15.000]  guns in cars.
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  In Hillary's response to using executive orders to take our guns, amen.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  Let the congregation say, amen.
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  Meanwhile, Chelsea Clinton says that gun control can finally be implemented.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  Now that Justice Scalia is dead.
[05:30.000 --> 05:36.000]  They believe the next time the court rules on gun control will make a definitive ruling.
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  Well, here's a news flash for the Clintons.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  America doesn't have a gun problem.
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  America has a gang problem.
[05:44.000 --> 05:50.000]  And in gun-free zones like Chicago, there's already been over a thousand shootings this year.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  And guess what?
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  Not one of the shooters was a member of the NRA.
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  Come and take it.

[07:59.240 --> 08:20.240]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[08:20.240 --> 08:28.240]  Whoa, I am just beside myself right now by all the incredibly good things that are happening.
[08:28.240 --> 08:32.240]  There's also a paradox, obviously, to that.
[08:32.240 --> 08:37.240]  Evil, corruption, is just running rampant.
[08:37.240 --> 08:44.240]  The more it gets exposed, and the more opposition it runs into, the faster it steals.
[08:44.240 --> 08:51.240]  And the faster it tries to corrupt, to hide money offshore, to protect themselves,
[08:51.240 --> 09:00.240]  but also to try to just overthrow common sense and reality in some desperate attempt to save themselves,
[09:00.240 --> 09:08.240]  which in history, the establishment knows corrupt systems always end up coming down and very, very catastrophically.
[09:08.240 --> 09:13.240]  Wow, I had an amazing conversation with Roger Stone today.
[09:13.240 --> 09:16.240]  Unbelievable.
[09:16.240 --> 09:19.240]  I just wish I could tell you all the stuff he told me.
[09:19.240 --> 09:21.240]  Unbelievable.
[09:21.240 --> 09:22.240]  He's coming down here.
[09:22.240 --> 09:25.240]  He was coming this weekend, but he's got family stuff.
[09:25.240 --> 09:31.240]  I've got family stuff coming next Thursday, Friday in studio, and then we're in a war game over the weekend.
[09:31.240 --> 09:37.240]  But Roger Stone, there's a big article in The New York Times where they basically hone in and go,
[09:37.240 --> 09:43.240]  yeah, this is the political brain of Trump.
[09:43.240 --> 09:46.240]  Trump makes his own decisions as a real smart, but it is Stone.
[09:46.240 --> 09:50.240]  And Stone is like to say that on air, because he quite frankly, he likes some of the attention,
[09:50.240 --> 10:00.240]  but he doesn't want the establishment to figure out exactly who the top general is here under the main leader.
[10:00.240 --> 10:05.240]  But The New York Times basically says it, so it can basically now be said.
[10:05.240 --> 10:11.240]  It's just Trump and Clinton's clash, two operatives duke it out in their shadows.
[10:11.240 --> 10:19.240]  And then it's David Brock, the pansy, who constantly attacks us every day with disinformation and garbage.
[10:19.240 --> 10:25.240]  So you've got this little wannabe unicorn hopping around, and then you've got Stone over there on the other side.
[10:25.240 --> 10:27.240]  But it's a very, very interesting article.
[10:27.240 --> 10:28.240]  But let's shift gears out of that.
[10:28.240 --> 10:31.240]  He's coming on in the third hour today.
[10:31.240 --> 10:35.240]  Paul Watson from London, England will be hosting the fourth hour.
[10:35.240 --> 10:39.240]  dredgerport.com has three of our stories up on it today.
[10:39.240 --> 10:41.240]  But we'll get to those later.
[10:41.240 --> 10:47.240]  Vince Foster lives, Trump launches a new line of attack.
[10:47.240 --> 10:53.240]  And there's a big Washington Post article where they are soiling their knickers here.
[10:53.240 --> 10:58.240]  They need some new Pampers immediately, and the system is panicking.
[10:58.240 --> 11:01.240]  We are in their heads to quote Stone.
[11:01.240 --> 11:04.240]  They are freaking out behind the scenes.
[11:04.240 --> 11:06.240]  I only wish I could tell you.
[11:06.240 --> 11:13.240]  But Trump is for real, folks, and he is absolutely a wild man.
[11:13.240 --> 11:18.240]  A wild man.
[11:18.240 --> 11:22.240]  I mean, can you imagine what the Clintons are doing behind the scenes right now?
[11:22.240 --> 11:26.240]  They are so scared.
[11:26.240 --> 11:32.240]  They are trying everything they can.
[11:32.240 --> 11:38.240]  I don't think Newt Gendrich is going to get the VP spot, no matter how many hundreds of millions get thrown around or offered.
[11:38.240 --> 11:42.240]  Oh, anyways, I'm just going to let Roger Stone come on.
[11:42.240 --> 11:45.240]  And he can tell you as much as he can tell you in the third hour.
[11:45.240 --> 11:47.240]  But I don't ever get butterflies.
[11:47.240 --> 11:52.240]  And I was driving over here in the car before I went on air because I got ready at home today.
[11:52.240 --> 11:56.240]  And he was telling me things, and it was just butterflies.
[11:56.240 --> 11:59.240]  Especially because I've known Stone for years.
[11:59.240 --> 12:05.240]  I met him at some JFK events and knew he was a big operative with Nixon right through Reagan and Bush and knew he counted the recount.
[12:05.240 --> 12:07.240]  So I was kind of like, eww.
[12:07.240 --> 12:11.240]  But then I know over the last decade, he's written a lot of books and exposed what's going on over the last 14 years.
[12:11.240 --> 12:13.240]  And he's the real deal.
[12:13.240 --> 12:17.240]  But man, everything he's told me has come out true right on target.
[12:17.240 --> 12:23.240]  I mean, it's most political operatives, it is a bunch of delusional baloney that comes out of him and not with Stone.
[12:23.240 --> 12:26.240]  So I'm just really excited about him joining us today.
[12:26.240 --> 12:31.240]  I'm going to press him on as much as he can get out as much as he can say.
[12:31.240 --> 12:37.240]  Now that said, I am just really happy for those that are a new generation and don't remember.
[12:37.240 --> 12:42.240]  There were dead bodies all over the place in Arkansas, dead bodies all over DC.
[12:42.240 --> 12:50.240]  Ben Foster was rolled up in a carpet and taken out of a cat house and taken and thrown in the park.
[12:50.240 --> 12:53.240]  His office was also totally expunged and cleaned up.
[12:53.240 --> 12:57.240]  They murdered him.
[12:57.240 --> 13:07.240]  And Larry Nichols told you last week that you would see this next week and the week after didn't he?
[13:07.240 --> 13:09.240]  Didn't the little birdie tell you?
[13:09.240 --> 13:15.240]  So I have lots of little birdies, not just Stone, not just Larry Nichols.
[13:15.240 --> 13:17.240]  I have other birdies.
[13:17.240 --> 13:22.240]  And it's amazing that folks know I'm honorable and I'm on the team that wants to defend the Republic.
[13:22.240 --> 13:34.240]  And it's just it's incredible to have the CIA, the FBI, federal marshals, Delta Force over the years, not even give me classified information.
[13:34.240 --> 13:38.240]  Just say this is what's coming next and then to hint at what's coming after that.
[13:38.240 --> 13:48.240]  And let me just say there are people in this government and in the corporations that love this country and have just been waiting for the American people to get up off their butts and help them take the Republic back.
[13:48.240 --> 13:54.240]  You think most people in the military and our government like the fact they've shut down half our power plants crippling the country?
[13:54.240 --> 14:02.240]  That right there is just you turn those back on, boom, our economy comes back right there and do decent trade deals, fair trade deals.
[14:02.240 --> 14:03.240]  Our economy roars back.
[14:03.240 --> 14:12.240]  They've been trying to hold the economy down as much as they can and make people quit working and make them go on welfare and make them deal drugs and make them give up.
[14:12.240 --> 14:14.240]  And we just won't do it.
[14:14.240 --> 14:25.240]  So they're just running around now going we're going to put tranny bathrooms in your kids don't belong to you or more fluoride in the water just trying to suppress us.
[14:25.240 --> 14:37.240]  We're going to bring in tens of thousands of people with TV and put them in school with your kids just trying to see how they break our will.
[14:37.240 --> 14:43.240]  And George Soros running around financing his operatives going in little white punk kids.
[14:43.240 --> 14:49.240]  I say kids a little scummy adults going deck the halls with dead cops.
[14:49.240 --> 14:51.240]  Time to shoot some pigs.
[14:51.240 --> 14:57.240]  It's obvious to everyone foreign operatives trying to start wars and race wars and kill the cops.
[14:57.240 --> 15:00.240]  That just woke the police up and pushed them over the edge.
[15:00.240 --> 15:02.240]  They now know what's happening.
[15:02.240 --> 15:04.240]  I mean, it's amazing.
[15:04.240 --> 15:11.240]  So it's not like we're poor Russians that were under the czars for 500 years and had been oppressed as serfs.
[15:11.240 --> 15:13.240]  They weren't perfect or better than communists.
[15:13.240 --> 15:20.240]  But yeah, okay, you took over there and killed tens of millions of innocent people because you got off on it because they were Christians.
[15:20.240 --> 15:27.240]  Okay, you run around in Arab Spring and killed millions of Muslims who didn't have any rights or any freedom ever.
[15:27.240 --> 15:36.240]  Just because you've dumbed everybody down and bankrupted a lot of Americans doesn't mean there's still a lot of people that know what's going on and are politically active and armed to the teeth.
[15:36.240 --> 15:44.240]  And it's not going to be like some candy land where little potbellied commasars run around with Glenn Beck and have their way with the American people.
[15:44.240 --> 15:53.240]  You guys may sit around up in your boardrooms all day and have delusions of grandeur, but you have screwed this country over.
[15:53.240 --> 15:59.240]  You even think that you're the reason this country has been successful while you try to strangle it in its bed.
[15:59.240 --> 16:01.240]  It's just not happening.
[16:01.240 --> 16:03.240]  Not happening.
[16:03.240 --> 16:09.240]  You want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[16:09.240 --> 16:12.240]  You got a will, we got a will.
[16:12.240 --> 16:14.240]  False flag all you want.
[16:14.240 --> 16:16.240]  Pull whatever garbage you want.
[16:16.240 --> 16:20.240]  The military and the police now know on average what's going on.
[16:20.240 --> 16:28.240]  Are there some globalists and operatives in all those groups that are going to sit there and try to work with the New World Order and do traitorous stuff?
[16:28.240 --> 16:31.240]  Absolutely.
[16:31.240 --> 16:35.240]  But there are just as many or more patriots who now realize they're backs against the wall.
[16:35.240 --> 16:42.240]  It's only going to get worse until we all do the right thing and you're starting to see that happen.
[16:42.240 --> 16:45.240]  And people just can't believe that we could fight back against tyranny.
[16:45.240 --> 16:47.240]  They can't believe we could have any success.
[16:47.240 --> 16:48.240]  We can.
[16:48.240 --> 16:49.240]  Biblically.
[16:49.240 --> 16:51.240]  Let's say it's the end times beginning.
[16:51.240 --> 16:58.240]  Well, if we all act like Jonas and go warn the people, then we get the 100 year reprieve, folks.
[16:58.240 --> 17:03.240]  God always gives us a chance to change our destinies.
[17:03.240 --> 17:10.240]  God always gave Israel over and over again, chances to repent and turn back.
[17:10.240 --> 17:11.240]  And sometimes Israel didn't.
[17:11.240 --> 17:14.240]  Sometimes Israel did.
[17:14.240 --> 17:17.240]  But that's how it works for every civilization and every culture.
[17:17.240 --> 17:23.240]  And we're in a magical, mystical time right now of great good and great evil.
[17:23.240 --> 17:30.240]  And this is the time that all men must come to the aid of their families and humanity and basic free speech.
[17:30.240 --> 17:40.240]  Even the Washington Post has come out and is horrified by Facebook and Internet censorship.
[17:40.240 --> 17:47.240]  And is saying we've got a serious problem with censorship because Chinese censorship worked.
[17:47.240 --> 17:49.240]  And we're starting to adopt that here.
[17:49.240 --> 17:50.240]  Yes.
[17:50.240 --> 17:54.240]  And Zuckerberg's working with them and Glenn Beck comes out and says, the public just does.
[17:54.240 --> 17:55.240]  Conservatives are just stupid.
[17:55.240 --> 17:57.240]  They don't know how to use social media.
[17:57.240 --> 17:59.240]  He actually said that.
[17:59.240 --> 18:01.240]  It's a fair algorithm.
[18:01.240 --> 18:03.240]  No one's censoring you.
[18:03.240 --> 18:06.240]  Facebook's own whitewash admits that rogue employees have been doing it.
[18:06.240 --> 18:08.240]  It's not rogue.
[18:08.240 --> 18:10.240]  I have the notices.
[18:10.240 --> 18:20.240]  We have a guest coming on next hour, who this week, late last week, was sent a notice and said, you're suspended for talking about Facebook censorship when it was in the news.
[18:20.240 --> 18:22.240]  We, this has happened to us many times.
[18:22.240 --> 18:23.240]  We've written articles.
[18:23.240 --> 18:25.240]  We have the screenshots.
[18:25.240 --> 18:29.240]  It's like denying the drone program exists when it exists.
[18:29.240 --> 18:31.240]  And he sits there and prays on his listeners.
[18:31.240 --> 18:33.240]  I mean, he is just a freaking liar.
[18:33.240 --> 18:36.240]  Excuse me.
[18:36.240 --> 18:39.240]  And says, it's not going on.
[18:39.240 --> 18:43.240]  I mean, I got the quotes right here.
[18:43.240 --> 18:47.240]  And he says, everything's fine.
[18:47.240 --> 18:52.240]  He says, you just don't know how to use Facebook.
[18:52.240 --> 19:01.240]  When Facebook admittedly censors their users, radio host, TV host, you name it, and then sits there and denies they're doing it when they send you a notice suspending you.
[19:01.240 --> 19:04.240]  And if you get three of them, they just terminate your account.
[19:04.240 --> 19:06.240]  And we're saying, don't do that to us.
[19:06.240 --> 19:13.240]  That's what Nazi Germany did from 35 or so to 1940 was first just not let people have commerce, not let different people.
[19:13.240 --> 19:15.240]  They didn't like advertising newspapers.
[19:15.240 --> 19:19.240]  And then it was knock their windows out and steal their cash registers.
[19:19.240 --> 19:24.240]  When they start shutting guns down, being able to be sold in stores, they're ending it.
[19:24.240 --> 19:28.240]  When they start shutting your speech down on so-called third party commons, they're ending it.
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.240]  I'm going to skip this network.
[19:29.240 --> 19:30.240]  Break this is so important.
[19:30.240 --> 19:31.240]  We're talking about free speech.
[19:31.240 --> 19:37.240]  It'll all be gone if we don't make sacrifices now and defend it.
[19:37.240 --> 19:42.240]  I mean, even the Washington Post sits there and goes, yeah, a lot of censorship is starting to happen.
[19:42.240 --> 19:43.240]  It really can happen.
[19:43.240 --> 19:44.240]  We shouldn't let it happen.
[19:44.240 --> 19:48.240]  Some members of the press are getting it.
[19:48.240 --> 19:54.240]  But not Glenn Beck because he's there to tell you it doesn't exist even when they admit it exists.
[19:54.240 --> 19:55.240]  Here it is.
[19:55.240 --> 19:56.240]  Right Bart.
[19:56.240 --> 19:59.240]  Glenn Beck blasts conservative critics as progressives on the right.
[19:59.240 --> 20:06.240]  Says Facebook leans left because conservatives don't know how to use social media.
[20:06.240 --> 20:07.240]  Forget the Facebook whistleblowers.
[20:07.240 --> 20:10.240]  Forget their own internal reports saying, well, we didn't do it at the top.
[20:10.240 --> 20:11.240]  But yeah, our employees did.
[20:11.240 --> 20:14.240]  No, no, no, it didn't happen.
[20:14.240 --> 20:22.240]  He just thinks his listeners are so stupid that they're not going to go look that up.
[20:22.240 --> 20:23.240]  It's incredible.
[20:23.240 --> 20:24.240]  Here it is.
[20:24.240 --> 20:28.240]  Facebook admits rogue employees may have shown bias against conservatives.
[20:28.240 --> 20:33.240]  Social media giant denies systematic discrimination.
[20:33.240 --> 20:43.240]  The online giant denied that it had shown systematic political bias but admitted employees played a bigger role than previously acknowledged in determining what news is highlighted.
[20:43.240 --> 20:45.240]  In the trending topic section.
[20:45.240 --> 20:55.240]  Yeah, what to feed everybody's pages to not let individuals share something with the vote of ideas and research and open market of ideas and free association.
[20:55.240 --> 21:03.240]  But to make you think that's happening and then choose the trends and choose the news you see.
[21:03.240 --> 21:09.240]  We should do Google bombs where we just have our millions of listeners go search the topic and we go to the top almost every time.
[21:09.240 --> 21:13.240]  They just change their algorithm to where they choose.
[21:13.240 --> 21:14.240]  And Facebook has adopted that.
[21:14.240 --> 21:28.240]  In fact, you can actually say we're part of going to that model because they cannot stand the will of the people and what you're really looking at and doing changing that and affecting that.
[21:28.240 --> 21:31.240]  So I'm going to be getting to all of this today because it's all about censorship.
[21:31.240 --> 21:33.240]  It's all about control.
[21:33.240 --> 21:42.240]  Drudge has flashbacked to a Kit Daniels transcript and article of Drudge when he was here with us in October of 2015.
[21:42.240 --> 21:45.240]  Well, I love another parachute in from Drudge.
[21:45.240 --> 21:54.240]  Everyone wants to Drudge Facebook Twitter Internet ghettos designed to demoralize individuals and I get Drudge only gives interview every four or five years.
[21:54.240 --> 21:58.240]  It's time to give it to us or give it with doing doing an interview with Trump.
[21:58.240 --> 22:01.240]  I know he's ready to talk to Drudge person to person ready to happen.
[22:01.240 --> 22:03.240]  Drudge, I've told you that.
[22:03.240 --> 22:05.240]  Give me Stone's number right now.
[22:05.240 --> 22:07.240]  I'm sure you already got it or Trump.
[22:07.240 --> 22:10.240]  Boom. Let's do it.
[22:10.240 --> 22:13.240]  And magnify what you're saying.
[22:13.240 --> 22:16.240]  Magnify what Trump's saying or come here.
[22:16.240 --> 22:18.240]  Let's do it.
[22:18.240 --> 22:19.240]  Because there's a quickening.
[22:19.240 --> 22:20.240]  There's an acceleration.
[22:20.240 --> 22:22.240]  I get it's good that you only talk every once in a while.
[22:22.240 --> 22:24.240]  So folks, listen, but now you've been proven right.
[22:24.240 --> 22:26.240]  You warned us last year.
[22:26.240 --> 22:29.240]  Now here we are nine months later and it's all come true.
[22:29.240 --> 22:30.240]  It's all coming true.
[22:30.240 --> 22:31.240]  The nightmare is happening.
[22:31.240 --> 22:32.240]  You were right.
[22:32.240 --> 22:35.240]  So the Supreme Court justice that told you it was coming was right.
[22:35.240 --> 22:37.240]  So things are compressing.
[22:37.240 --> 22:42.240]  I think every nine months, every year, whatever, give birth to some new ideas here.
[22:42.240 --> 22:44.240]  Tell us what other intel you've got.
[22:44.240 --> 22:46.240]  But regardless, I guess he is.
[22:46.240 --> 22:50.240]  He's re-trumpeting what he said nine months ago.
[22:50.240 --> 22:56.240]  Drudge Facebook Twitter Internet ghettos designed to demoralize individuals.
[22:56.240 --> 23:00.240]  Corporate controlled social media killing open range of ideas on Internet.
[23:00.240 --> 23:01.240]  Drudge says he went after Facebook.
[23:01.240 --> 23:02.240]  He went after them all.
[23:02.240 --> 23:05.240]  He said they make you think you've got a way to talk to folks, but you're being suppressed.
[23:05.240 --> 23:06.240]  You're being blocked.
[23:06.240 --> 23:09.240]  Totally proven right.
[23:09.240 --> 23:12.240]  And then it ties into this article out of the Washington Post.
[23:12.240 --> 23:14.240]  China, scary lesson to the world.
[23:14.240 --> 23:20.240]  Since when the Internet works, China is trumpeting its version of Internet quote sovereignty.
[23:20.240 --> 23:23.240]  And it's now the model they're trying to push all over the world.
[23:23.240 --> 23:25.240]  And the answer is they tried to pass this six, seven years ago in Australia.
[23:25.240 --> 23:27.240]  People said no.
[23:27.240 --> 23:32.240]  You got to say no to the censorship and no to people that come out and say conservatives are wrong.
[23:32.240 --> 23:34.240]  They're not being censured.
[23:34.240 --> 23:37.240]  But last week he came out and said, well, there is some radical stuff needs to be censored.
[23:37.240 --> 23:39.240]  So he's like, yeah, we need to censor Zuckerberg.
[23:39.240 --> 23:41.240]  Zuckerberg is an incredible guy.
[23:41.240 --> 23:45.240]  And as long as my stuff gets out there, I'd love, you know, I mean, this is sick.
[23:45.240 --> 23:52.240]  And I'm not just going after Beck here, but he is the example of someone who claims he's with us,
[23:52.240 --> 23:55.240]  but is openly against us.
[23:55.240 --> 24:01.240]  He is worse than Vayner, worse than Paul Ryan, because we've always known those guys are establishment people.
[24:01.240 --> 24:04.240]  But Beck is just a Trojan horse.
[24:04.240 --> 24:07.240]  And his colleagues don't like him in radio in his own network.
[24:07.240 --> 24:10.240]  I mean, he is an arrogant, horrible person.
[24:10.240 --> 24:14.240]  And I've called him a devil and all that because he wants to call people a devil.
[24:14.240 --> 24:18.240]  If they vote for Trump and you're going to go to hell, give me a break.
[24:18.240 --> 24:25.240]  Okay, you're the one out there accusing everybody, saying they're evil, claiming you speak for God,
[24:25.240 --> 24:29.240]  and you are a backstabbing person.
[24:29.240 --> 24:32.240]  And Breitbart, everybody else has picked up my rant.
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.240]  Drudge has picked up my breakdown from Sunday where I was, I tried to be calm,
[24:36.240 --> 24:40.240]  but they did pick up the more spicy terms where I said he's like a snake on his little pot belly,
[24:40.240 --> 24:43.240]  you know, dribbling before Zuckerberg.
[24:43.240 --> 24:45.240]  But it's true.
[24:45.240 --> 24:48.240]  It is so disgusting.
[24:48.240 --> 24:52.240]  And I just, he represents that whole culture of George Will going,
[24:52.240 --> 24:57.240]  we are the sovereigns in the Republican Party, the super delegate's word is he was going to be one.
[24:57.240 --> 25:05.240]  And we will decide who is suitable, not the plurality of a mere majority of voters.
[25:05.240 --> 25:08.240]  And the headlines, Glenn Beck has finally sold out to Facebook and Obama.
[25:08.240 --> 25:11.240]  I want to tweak that.
[25:11.240 --> 25:17.240]  The headline I want is Glenn Beck has openly, openly sold out to Facebook and Obama.
[25:17.240 --> 25:26.240]  He's always been a creepy, pro-abortion, nasty little creature.
[25:26.240 --> 25:28.240]  Ugh, I'm going to stop talking about him.
[25:28.240 --> 25:34.240]  It's just, he's there telling you that Facebook isn't doing this and it's admitted.
[25:34.240 --> 25:42.240]  Can we put up the article that was on inforwars.com over the weekend with Southern, the lovely and intelligent reporter,
[25:42.240 --> 25:45.240]  that is coming on from the rebel.media.
[25:45.240 --> 25:50.240]  She goes out and just shows how crazy the feminists are, how anti-woman they are, just how nuts they are now,
[25:50.240 --> 25:52.240]  and she's got all the screenshots.
[25:52.240 --> 25:56.240]  Facebook bans conservatives for complaining about censorship, social media giant,
[25:56.240 --> 26:00.240]  back to its old ways despite much heralded meaning with conservatives.
[26:00.240 --> 26:05.240]  The truth is it only stopped doing it. It looked like four or five days and all of a sudden all of our stuff surged
[26:05.240 --> 26:08.240]  and then it just went right back to it and everybody else has got censored even more.
[26:08.240 --> 26:13.240]  They like clamped down even more once they figured out, we'll take care of this Senate hearing, we'll handle it,
[26:13.240 --> 26:19.240]  get rid of the people in management positions that are blowing the whistle and go right back to it even worse than ever
[26:19.240 --> 26:21.240]  to shut these people up.
[26:21.240 --> 26:25.240]  Well sorry, we're on almost 200 radio stations, dozens of TV stations and cable systems,
[26:25.240 --> 26:29.240]  global shortwave, millions of people getting the free podcast,
[26:29.240 --> 26:34.240]  tens of millions every few days watching our videos on different platforms conservatively.
[26:34.240 --> 26:40.240]  Facebook is one of our biggest referrals. It is as big as Drudge.
[26:40.240 --> 26:45.240]  The two biggest referrals are basically month to month or neck and neck, Drudge and Facebook.
[26:45.240 --> 26:49.240]  Drudge and Facebook, but Drudge is more intelligent, informed people,
[26:49.240 --> 26:53.240]  and the Pentagon, the White House, the politicos all look at it.
[26:53.240 --> 26:59.240]  Facebook, it's a bunch of, I'm not knocking them, but it's a bunch of hairdressers and school teachers
[26:59.240 --> 27:01.240]  and folks that are smart, I'm sure, but are more into gossip.
[27:01.240 --> 27:08.240]  I mean we get trash traffic from Facebook, but it's okay because we want to wake people up.
[27:08.240 --> 27:12.240]  When I say trash traffic, I mean it's, we have algorithms on all of it.
[27:12.240 --> 27:15.240]  Everything's just built to surveil, we can't help it, that's the way it works.
[27:15.240 --> 27:19.240]  We can go right in and just go, these are a bunch of poor, dumb people that all have degrees
[27:19.240 --> 27:24.240]  under pseudo-intellectuals and bad groceries at the local grocery store.
[27:24.240 --> 27:27.240]  I mean, it's like the Mark Dice thing we played at the start of the show.
[27:27.240 --> 27:33.240]  Almost every person he talked to in LA, they're on the coast, it was 9 out of 10, as usual, that's the number,
[27:33.240 --> 27:36.240]  8 out of 10, 9 out of 10, sometimes 10 out of 10, it's about 9 out of 10.
[27:36.240 --> 27:41.240]  He said, yeah, we want Bernie Mannoff to be his VP, Bernie Sanders.
[27:41.240 --> 27:44.240]  And he would talk about everything, and because he'd say, oh yeah, absolutely, I did my research.
[27:44.240 --> 27:49.240]  You know, it's very smart to come back around, oh, of course, what we need, they just want to act like they're smart.
[27:49.240 --> 27:53.240]  They don't know what planet they're on, okay?
[27:53.240 --> 27:59.240]  And so, I'm sorry, they were able to teach Helen Keller how to write and how to talk and everything.
[27:59.240 --> 28:01.240]  She was a wonderful lady, but it's like Helen Keller.
[28:01.240 --> 28:03.240]  That's what we call trash traffic.
[28:03.240 --> 28:08.240]  These people do not know what planet they're on, and they stop me and go, you're the guy.
[28:08.240 --> 28:14.240]  And that dozens of them go, I saw you saying Michelle's a tranny.
[28:14.240 --> 28:19.240]  She kind of does look like one, and I go, look, it's kind of tongue-in-cheek, but she looks like a man,
[28:19.240 --> 28:24.240]  and they're trying to censor people that say it, and John Rivers said it was dead, and so I'm going to say it, okay?
[28:24.240 --> 28:30.240]  And it's taken out of context and fed to you so that you freak out over it, but that's the way I reach out to you.
[28:30.240 --> 28:35.240]  And they just go, ugh, ugh, and I'm afraid of them.
[28:35.240 --> 28:42.240]  They have dull eyes, black, white, Hispanic. You name it, they are, and that's why MSNBC is all about how smart they are.
[28:42.240 --> 28:48.240]  These people are the biggest chump morons the galaxy has ever seen.
[28:48.240 --> 28:52.240]  The known universe.
[28:52.240 --> 28:57.240]  I mean, they have this, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh.
[28:57.240 --> 28:59.240]  What's that word mean?
[28:59.240 --> 29:05.840]  I mean degrees you got oh, I'm sorry. I quit college because I was already so hugely successful and
[29:06.160 --> 29:10.720]  You know making almost as much money a year as the president does a year when I was 24
[29:12.600 --> 29:14.600]  That means your failure oh
[29:15.800 --> 29:19.160]  Yeah, I'm a failure. Haha. Haha. I
[29:19.720 --> 29:22.640]  Wanted to be an engineer. I'd go to school. I want to be a lawyer
[29:22.640 --> 29:27.720]  I'd want to go to enter the guild and kiss the rings. I didn't do that by the way
[29:27.720 --> 29:32.440]  You guys all say it's bad to make money, but you want money other people's money
[29:32.440 --> 29:35.600]  I took the money I made and put it all back in to build something
[29:36.240 --> 29:43.720]  Americana and original to take tyrants on head-on and you know what the American dream still lives as this rhinoceros

[30:15.280 --> 30:22.320]  The blasts from the volcano reached 10,000 feet high down in Indonesia Mount Sinabung also erupted with torrents of lava pouring out of the
[30:22.320 --> 30:28.680]  Volcano that's been dormant for over 400 years and another volcano in Iceland may also erupt which could drastically affect Europe
[30:28.680 --> 30:30.680]  But here in the US over the past month

[33:27.320 --> 33:30.400]  Sanders warns of messy summer
[33:31.440 --> 33:33.440]  That is he's really winning and they want to steal it from him

[33:40.840 --> 33:49.240]  War criminal crazy woman that brags about killing people that she didn't personally kill and then
[33:51.560 --> 33:53.880]  I mean even if you kill people you don't brag about it lady
[33:53.880 --> 33:58.760]  And I know you've your folks have killed a lot of people but you haven't personally done it you witch probably can't even mow the yard
[33:58.760 --> 34:00.760]  You're so weak. Excuse me
[34:01.520 --> 34:07.440]  And she says she's you know under attack and sniper fire. I mean she's a Brian Williams on steroids, but

[34:21.680 --> 34:28.400]  And they say it's because of the tidal wave of fascist vitriol you people promote pedophilia
[34:29.120 --> 34:32.360]  And you say our kids don't belong to us freaks. I
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.040]  mean you just kept poking and punching and
[34:36.040 --> 34:41.000]  You know globalist blowing up federal buildings and blaming it on us. We know about what you did
[34:41.840 --> 34:43.840]  And I was just handed another article
[34:45.360 --> 34:51.760]  During the break an incredible one. I'm just I'm just totally overwhelmed now where
[34:57.440 --> 35:00.680]  Where they're coming out in mainstream news saying reading to your kids
[35:00.680 --> 35:07.080]  We guys print me that again reading to your buckley gave it to me. I got 500 article ceremony exaggerating
[35:10.240 --> 35:12.240]  Reading to your children
[35:12.800 --> 35:18.960]  This is what colleges are now teaching and even teaching them how to speak is racist and elitist and
[35:19.880 --> 35:23.600]  That you should not tutor your kids or have private schools and actually make them dumb
[35:23.600 --> 35:29.960]  That's like, you know, they're trying to teach in schools a bonnix
[35:31.280 --> 35:37.960]  Well jive talk from city to city is different just like hillbilly talk from Kentucky is different than East, Texas
[35:38.200 --> 35:41.160]  There are people in East, Texas white people that talk like this
[35:44.600 --> 35:51.400]  You don't go then tearing that into a language set up a chair at a university and spend ten million dollars a year
[35:51.400 --> 35:54.320]  Teaching people how to understand the beautiful dialect
[35:57.400 --> 35:59.400]  That's the same thing with jive
[36:00.600 --> 36:01.920]  absolute
[36:01.920 --> 36:03.040]  garbage
[36:03.040 --> 36:06.280]  That they want us to adopt so no one can communicate with each other
[36:06.280 --> 36:12.320]  This is the end of language and now they've come out in major news. I had three articles. I'll find it here in a minute
[36:13.080 --> 36:16.640]  I was reading in the break. That's what my head is just spinning. I mean, this is official
[36:16.640 --> 36:22.200]  They're gonna say now it's evil if you can talk and I always said if you can tie your shoelaces or two plus two equals four
[36:22.200 --> 36:28.880]  Or you have language like idiocracy the genius the genius Mike judge this guy is so smart behind the scenes
[36:29.800 --> 36:33.240]  People say man, it's weird Mike. Just doesn't talk to anybody because he thinks he's not arrogant
[36:33.240 --> 36:36.840]  He just people can't really talk to me with 180 IQ. He helped design the f-18
[36:36.840 --> 36:39.520]  I mean he was like the main project manager on the f-18
[36:40.160 --> 36:44.560]  Before he dominated the world and made three billion dollars in animation. Excuse me
[36:44.560 --> 36:50.520]  A good friend of mine. I'm not a name-dropper. He's just amazing amazing. He talks to me. I'm proud that he talks to me
[36:51.760 --> 36:53.360]  And
[36:53.360 --> 36:56.640]  Idiocracy they bring him into the court and there's a guy is able to talk
[36:56.640 --> 37:02.200]  He was just a 75 80 90 IQ maybe got back, you know in the year 2000 and whatever
[37:02.360 --> 37:06.120]  But the future everybody's so dumb. Well, he talks like fag
[37:06.120 --> 37:13.000]  Ha ha ha and his own lawyers laugh at him. He's like, well, wait, don't I get to put on evidence? Yeah, and I'm just like shut up fag
[37:16.880 --> 37:20.920]  Everything he put out was a hit this they didn't even show that in one theater
[37:20.920 --> 37:26.240]  But LA and Austin to legally cover it and delisted it in the movie phone system
[37:26.320 --> 37:30.020]  So people couldn't even find it back with him you called in to find where a movie was playing nationwide
[37:31.640 --> 37:33.440]  He told me even more privately about it
[37:33.440 --> 37:39.040]  On record. He told about the censorship. They saw that film and got so scared of it because that's their actual plan
[37:42.200 --> 37:46.080]  People sometimes the walk-ups if you're reading a book ago, what you read and think you're real smart
[37:46.080 --> 37:48.680]  I have seen it happen and it's happened to me. I
[37:50.840 --> 37:53.840]  Was in Cancun once when I was 16 reading Order of the Deaths head
[37:57.200 --> 37:59.200]  And I
[37:59.200 --> 38:03.040]  Had these big muscle guys come over and go, what are you reading a Nazi book for?
[38:03.920 --> 38:08.120]  And I was not an oxy book. It's an award-winning book about the SS very interesting understand government. They go
[38:08.400 --> 38:12.800]  Wow, what are you? Who are you? Why do you know all this stuff? And I'm sitting there and I was really good shape
[38:12.800 --> 38:18.840]  You know, what are you college student? I'm like, no, I'm 16. They're like, well, we're Italians or Italian American guys are like
[38:18.840 --> 38:22.480]  We're Italians. We don't like Nazis and I went really Mussolini was was was a Nazi
[38:22.480 --> 38:27.680]  They actually started the whole fascist movement. The Nazi salute comes from a Rome. Whoa. How do you know all this stuff? You're weird
[38:27.680 --> 38:31.400]  They're like, well, actually, we're kind of like, you know mobbed up gangsters
[38:31.400 --> 38:33.960]  Here's our girlfriends in these hot girl was come party with us hang out
[38:33.960 --> 38:37.480]  But wow you read a book and it was like they're like buying me margaritas and stuff
[38:38.840 --> 38:43.920]  We had some more fun after that. But the point is that they were just blown away that I was reading a book. I
[38:45.600 --> 38:47.280]  Always thought about order the death sentence
[38:47.280 --> 38:52.760]  That's one of the books I rather just had so much about secret societies and how stuff really worked and British intelligence
[38:52.760 --> 38:57.440]  It already infiltrated Hitler when he was just a member of the Nazi party, but was already planning to maybe put him in power
[38:57.440 --> 38:59.200]  They had a bunch of other people they were pushing
[38:59.200 --> 39:05.680]  Can you guys Google order the death sentence like put that cover up that's got like Hitler and the SA marching and Munich on the cover of it
[39:07.240 --> 39:13.220]  But I mean, it's wild where I'm not even bragging saying I'm that smart, but it is bizarre that
[39:15.360 --> 39:21.100]  They now want to basically imply it's illegal to be able to talk or if your child knows how to read that's bad now
[39:21.100 --> 39:23.700]  See, they're gonna reduce everything to make us equal
[39:23.700 --> 39:28.860]  They're gonna make us all dumb as possible and they're now going to the next phase admitting it
[39:30.060 --> 39:32.060]  There it is
[39:32.460 --> 39:34.460]  The order of the death said
[39:35.220 --> 39:40.060]  The story of Hitler's SS that is a very important 800-page book
[39:41.300 --> 39:43.300]  Read it twice
[39:43.980 --> 39:45.900]  62 bucks Wow
[39:45.900 --> 39:48.300]  All right, let's just I'm gonna shut that down
[39:48.300 --> 39:53.300]  But I will get those articles where they're now calling for that and cover it coming up
[39:54.900 --> 40:00.260]  Let me just give you what else is is is is going on here. I am so excited
[40:02.300 --> 40:07.340]  About Trump coming out and going after
[40:09.940 --> 40:15.420]  The Clintons with Vince Foster's death because they killed him we got him and
[40:15.420 --> 40:22.180]  And the fact that Nichols has all the files that have been ignored until now and inquire is coming out next week with it
[40:25.660 --> 40:29.860]  This has got I'm scared because no one has ever taken them on like this and this is just such an epic
[40:30.660 --> 40:34.740]  Time to be alive. I can also feel the danger level of it
[40:37.380 --> 40:39.860]  And so that's another reason I'm so excited
[40:40.700 --> 40:45.100]  Plus the other information I've been told which is just hard even do a broadcast when you know stuff like this
[40:45.100 --> 40:48.940]  But I've just got to sit here as a real journalist and they're not talking about it. Hmm now until the time
[40:49.900 --> 40:52.820]  Trump escalates attack on Bill Clinton
[40:55.220 --> 40:57.340]  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is
[40:58.300 --> 41:00.940]  Revealing some of the ugliest political chapters in the 90s
[41:01.900 --> 41:08.660]  With escalating personal attacks on Bill Clinton's character by the way I was watching Fox News this morning three different reporters over an hour and a half
[41:08.660 --> 41:10.660]  of different shows that I was watching
[41:10.660 --> 41:16.340]  While I was getting ready and we're researching and then working out what they kept saying oh the stuff of the 1970s and 80s
[41:16.420 --> 41:18.940]  No, it was the 90s and they were covering it up
[41:18.940 --> 41:23.340]  And they're trying to make it sound old and then I kept hearing other hosts say it off teleprompter
[41:23.340 --> 41:25.940]  So that's the level of disinfo even on Fox
[41:28.340 --> 41:33.460]  Because the Clintons and others are like we made a deal with you and and news core
[41:34.140 --> 41:37.780]  We're not gonna come after you for your hacking scandals. We made a deal with you
[41:37.780 --> 41:41.140]  We didn't have a justice department at night. You leave us alone
[41:41.140 --> 41:47.620]  And so imagine they're trying to sit on all those reporters and have them engage in disinformation and Sean Hannity's not doing it
[41:48.220 --> 41:52.140]  Bill O'Reilly is he was attacking Trump last night like saying stop going there with Clinton
[41:52.140 --> 41:56.220]  Oh, you're supposed to say he's going after women Trump's hurting women and it's not true
[41:56.220 --> 42:01.540]  But then Trump's just supposed to sit there while Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton basically stand over him and
[42:03.020 --> 42:05.020]  Just shovel garbage on
[42:05.020 --> 42:11.180]  Oh, he's not doing it and Trump said listen, I'm being attacked. I'm not starting this. They hit me
[42:11.180 --> 42:15.780]  I'm gonna hit back. So we're going we're going to town and he came out this morning with the Vince Foster stuff
[42:17.660 --> 42:22.660]  In one recent interview Trump said another topic of potential concern is the suicide of former White House aid
[42:22.660 --> 42:26.580]  It was a serious death and cover-up which remains the focus of intense and far
[42:27.380 --> 42:29.580]  Fetch conspiracy theories on the internet
[42:29.580 --> 42:34.020]  You mean the police report the witnesses the fact that we don't believe known liars me stuff like that like Hillary said
[42:34.020 --> 42:36.860]  She didn't have a server or extra email, but she did like all the other lies
[42:39.020 --> 42:45.220]  It's the one thing with her whether it's white water or whether it's Vince Foster or whether it's Benghazi it's always a
[42:45.740 --> 42:50.540]  Mess with Hillary Trump said the interview. So he's letting them know you want to take the gloves off. We're gonna do it
[42:51.460 --> 42:53.740]  But again, everything's okay because Glenn Beck
[42:54.540 --> 42:58.740]  Came out and said we have progressives on the right. That's right. We're the commies now
[42:58.740 --> 43:04.140]  We're the globalist town not him meeting with Zuckerberg who's censoring and Zuckerberg's own report admits
[43:04.140 --> 43:05.940]  They have employees censoring people
[43:05.940 --> 43:09.060]  But he goes further and just says it isn't happening
[43:09.460 --> 43:11.460]  Well, you heard Glenn Beck
[43:11.940 --> 43:13.500]  You heard him
[43:13.500 --> 43:18.460]  Laura Southern everybody else where they send you a letter and shut your account off and let you know it's suspended
[43:18.820 --> 43:24.020]  Because you talked about censorship because you talked about censorship. We're gonna censor you because it doesn't exist
[43:24.020 --> 43:29.940]  That is 1984. We're gonna censor you because we're admittedly censoring and you linked to news articles
[43:29.940 --> 43:32.700]  Where we're censoring and you're a popular beautiful young lady
[43:32.700 --> 43:36.940]  And so we're just gonna suspend you and we're gonna cut you off next time you do it, but we're not censoring
[43:37.300 --> 43:41.940]  So don't talk about what happened to you like Bill Clinton you talk about the fact that I raped you
[43:41.940 --> 43:47.700]  I'll send state police to break your freaking legs lady. You understand or that of your of your brother or your son and
[43:50.340 --> 43:52.460]  Sometimes they send folks to break people's legs or kill them
[43:52.460 --> 43:56.540]  It's the same thing. Well, you said hey, listen, you talk about censorship
[43:56.540 --> 44:02.220]  We're gonna shut you down you self censor and you sit down and you shut your mouth or it's over
[44:05.780 --> 44:08.940]  My those are large canines you have there mr. Zuckerberg
[44:11.260 --> 44:14.800]  My what big eyes you have my what big teeth you have
[44:16.580 --> 44:19.420]  All the better to eat us with I know predator
[44:19.420 --> 44:28.180]  We put Zuckerberg the consummate let's put up America's psycho Christian Bale's photo next to Zuckerberg's
[44:28.180 --> 44:33.300]  We should start that meme and ask who looks more like a psychopath those two or Bill Hammer on Fox News
[44:33.860 --> 44:39.220]  And I go over this psycho look more and more that I see one more guys on Fox News reporters that look like psychopaths
[44:39.860 --> 44:44.660]  Just the perfect hair the perfect little face and the sociopathic look in their little loving eyes
[44:46.620 --> 44:48.620]  Now there's that
[44:48.620 --> 44:55.020]  But let's show the American psycho when he's being friendly when he's being nice not always killing and then let's let's let's let's then cut
[44:56.300 --> 45:01.240]  To Glenn Beck and Mark Zuckerberg, and you just see the look because the eyes are like shark eyes
[45:01.500 --> 45:04.180]  They're smiling trying to look friendly, but it's an adapted face
[45:05.220 --> 45:11.460]  Just like a angler fish. It looks like a pretty light looks like a tasty, you know glow-in-the-dark plankton
[45:12.220 --> 45:15.500]  And little fish things boy. I found a big old juicy plankton or a big old
[45:15.500 --> 45:18.860]  Oh, but you see you don't see in the dark
[45:19.820 --> 45:28.140]  Laying there stalking the big black fish with the big long teeth and the little shark eyes
[45:28.420 --> 45:34.420]  Because there's nothing behind them, but the gates of hell come into the darkness
[45:35.100 --> 45:39.340]  If you saw Zuckerberg right now, you'd understand what I'm talking about. Hello
[45:39.340 --> 45:46.140]  There's another little friend come to me come to me my child. I have ice cream
[45:47.140 --> 45:52.700]  In the van in the white van I have candy
[45:54.140 --> 45:56.140]  poppies
[45:56.140 --> 45:57.980]  poppies
[45:57.980 --> 46:00.600]  Puppies now. Let's see our American psycho
[46:02.180 --> 46:04.180]  Now
[46:04.180 --> 46:11.860]  There's only one thing they fear the wolves fear the sheepdog, and this is the return of the sheepdogs
[46:14.460 --> 46:17.180]  Forged in history ready to take you on
[46:25.940 --> 46:31.100]  You might be fast you might be good in the dark, but our teeth our jaws are twice the size of yours
[46:31.100 --> 46:37.060]  And when we get them into your flesh, we don't let go. You don't have your sleek coat either
[46:39.580 --> 46:41.580]  But your teeth can't get through ours
[46:42.060 --> 46:45.220]  Not as easy that is by the time you get your teeth into us
[46:45.500 --> 46:49.660]  You've already got our teeth around your neck, and they've already snapped five or six times
[46:50.460 --> 46:55.340]  That's why you fear us don't you and you know we're coming we hunt the hunters
[46:55.340 --> 47:02.220]  And we have emotion and love so much stronger than your evil and
[47:03.940 --> 47:05.940]  Much more terrible
[47:06.900 --> 47:08.900]  Much more fearsome
[47:09.180 --> 47:11.420]  Way way more strong, and you know it
[47:12.140 --> 47:15.660]  Your spirit of old knows your fall is here
[47:16.020 --> 47:23.980]  You could say what you want about Trump, but he is the archetype of the man standing against the evil going up against known killers
[47:23.980 --> 47:30.140]  And they are scared and that spirit is strong regardless what happens to Trump or myself or anybody else
[47:30.540 --> 47:32.540]  Matt drudge roger stone
[47:32.620 --> 47:36.540]  Let it be known the truth is out, and there's no putting it back in the bottle
[47:36.820 --> 47:41.340]  You're not gonna censor us and get away with it like communist China. It will be our undoing here
[47:41.740 --> 47:45.820]  We have been running around for decades like chickens with our heads cut off
[47:46.180 --> 47:49.900]  Preparing and warning the people and now they remember we warned them and
[47:49.900 --> 47:52.740]  And the truth is rising
[47:56.500 --> 48:00.220]  When evil comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it
[48:05.340 --> 48:12.220]  So have confidence patriots take action and know what you do and the links you spread the articles you email and the talk radio shows
[48:12.220 --> 48:16.180]  You call into and c-span and then when you run for office and when you take action
[48:16.180 --> 48:20.380]  And we when you give political donations if he doesn't matter if that even
[48:21.140 --> 48:26.820]  Contributes to the victory all of it thrown at the enemy will contribute in a tsunami of liberty and awakening and
[48:27.740 --> 48:35.140]  Your energy and your free will doing the right thing provenance will then align with that and God will step in
[48:35.780 --> 48:43.380]  That's not magic. That's energy. That's the universe. That's how it works and the enemy knows that and the enemy is scared
[48:43.380 --> 48:48.140]  That's what Obama's always saying. I need you to get behind me. I need you to believe
[48:49.020 --> 48:54.380]  Don't lose faith. We speak to the Democrat audience. Don't lose faith. Biden says don't lose faith
[48:54.700 --> 48:59.260]  Yeah, I know it looks bad, but we care about you. We are going to deliver you
[49:00.700 --> 49:04.580]  Believe in us are like the gods of Olympus. They will die
[49:04.580 --> 49:11.700]  It's metaphysical and they're dying stumbling around
[49:12.380 --> 49:18.900]  They're throwing everything they got at us and they're getting weaker and they're turning to sand like the vampires. They are they're turning to ash and
[49:20.140 --> 49:24.140]  The darker more twisted ones of them are getting back further into the shadows
[49:24.140 --> 49:33.580]  They're jumping on jets and running already just to be safe just to watch the carnage from afar
[49:35.660 --> 49:37.820]  By the way, we are listeners supported

[49:51.300 --> 49:56.060]  We're doing okay, but if I had a lot more money, I could do a lot more. I need more editors more camera people

[54:28.860 --> 54:34.860]  So see you doing well in sports or anything is is is not racist. It's disadvantage
[54:34.860 --> 54:42.860]  So LeBron James is you know better than say a 5 foot 10 Hispanic guy or white guy at basketball
[54:42.860 --> 54:44.860]  Because he's more athletic he's taller
[54:44.860 --> 54:50.860]  Well, you got to then disqualify LeBron James. That's where this is going
[54:50.860 --> 54:54.860]  This is so amazing. I'm going to cover that but I wanted to just let you know the sorts of that
[54:54.860 --> 54:58.860]  When I said it, I've been telling you it's going there because that's their plan
[54:58.860 --> 55:02.860]  They want totally mentally ill basket cases. There's another story up on drugsreport.com
[55:02.860 --> 55:05.860]  I think I've ever seen four or five articles on there at once
[55:05.860 --> 55:07.860]  Did we go to war?
[55:07.860 --> 55:11.860]  In Apple's residence stunned by Marshall Law Drill military drill
[55:11.860 --> 55:13.860]  We thought the world was ending I'll get to that coming up
[55:13.860 --> 55:17.860]  But before I go any further I wanted to just talk about just in the stack today
[55:17.860 --> 55:23.860]  I didn't even set out to find these articles. I've got like 30 articles. I'll just cover some of them
[55:23.860 --> 55:27.860]  Where the Clintons are involved in open corruption and just horrible stuff
[55:27.860 --> 55:34.860]  Here's an example their whole green carbon tax fund that she was raising money for was to push fracking
[55:34.860 --> 55:43.860]  And the lobby for fracking the oil companies the big ones are the ones Dutch roll shell BP and ExxonMobil
[55:43.860 --> 55:46.860]  ExxonMobil was one of the last about 12 years ago to go ahead and get on board but they did
[55:46.860 --> 55:50.860]  To push carbon taxes and shut down natural gas and coal
[55:50.860 --> 55:58.860]  And it's in her emails that she was trying to shut down other cleaner energy and frack
[55:58.860 --> 56:11.860]  Al Gore with Enron came up with in 1989 look it up it's admitted
[56:11.860 --> 56:17.860]  The carbon tax it's written by all companies to Jack you
[56:17.860 --> 56:21.860]  But I have pseudo-intellectuals get I bet you find it by the old companies. Oh, yeah
[56:21.860 --> 56:24.860]  Tell us about your oil Alex and I'm just sitting there going
[56:24.860 --> 56:29.860]  Oh, actually my family has natural gas and we make money of oil and a blah blah blah
[56:29.860 --> 56:33.860]  It's just it's just all bull folks. I don't get any money from any stuff
[56:33.860 --> 56:37.860]  I got family gets a little bit of it but that it's like they accuse you like you're getting money
[56:37.860 --> 56:42.860]  Here's Hillary openly doing it screwing everyone over for fracking
[56:42.860 --> 56:48.860]  And I've just it just goes on and on I mean look at this look at this stack of articles
[56:48.860 --> 56:52.860]  I mean all tied together. I mean I always knew this always knew Ken Starr went after rape
[56:52.860 --> 56:55.860]  And stuff like that because they couldn't go after Chinese communists inside the White House
[56:55.860 --> 57:00.860]  And missile secrets and reentry Merv technology so not one warhead but 20 warheads
[57:00.860 --> 57:04.860]  You know hit US cities when one ICBM comes back into orbit over
[57:04.860 --> 57:09.860]  North com total treason. I mean they should be well, you know, that's high treason
[57:09.860 --> 57:12.860]  I mean given our enemy that
[57:12.860 --> 57:17.860]  Systems like a nuke is it was all confirmed Ken Starr wouldn't go there
[57:17.860 --> 57:24.860]  Ken Starr who tried to bury Bill Clinton now only praises him
[57:24.860 --> 57:29.860]  No, his lobbying firm was basically funded by the Communist Chinese. It was all fake
[57:29.860 --> 57:33.860]  They took the good impeachment that got started by David Shippers and others and derailed it
[57:33.860 --> 57:39.860]  I had David Shippers on I had congressman at the time from Georgia on who helped get it going
[57:39.860 --> 57:42.860]  I mean they told me this is what it was and here it is all these years later
[57:42.860 --> 57:46.860]  The New York Times resurrecting Ken Starr
[57:46.860 --> 57:51.860]  20 years later we can just act like he's a great guy see the liberals can't
[57:51.860 --> 57:56.860]  He tried to bury him but now he loves him. No, he saved him
[57:56.860 --> 58:04.860]  First on CNN Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe under federal investigation for campaign contributions from a Communist Chinese billionaire
[58:08.860 --> 58:14.860]  There you go. That's what's going on here Hillary Clinton's energy initiative pressed
[58:14.860 --> 58:20.860]  Countries to embrace fracking new email show the intercept. Yeah, shut off our energy
[58:20.860 --> 58:23.860]  Make sure it all goes to the third world
[58:23.860 --> 58:30.860]  They don't want us to have any in it. Here it is. Obama rated 500 million from Zika Fund to finance UN's Green Climate Fund
[58:30.860 --> 58:33.860]  Which they just give to themselves by the way the UN pays money to him
[58:33.860 --> 58:36.860]  He's on the carbon fund out of the mercantile in Chicago
[58:36.860 --> 58:42.860]  They're just looting everything. I have dozens more of them looting foundations, robbing little kids, just running around in the left
[58:42.860 --> 58:48.860]  Just goes, yeah, yeah, we like it. We like a strong woman. Shut it, just run around the battle axe

[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.860]  Moon rising
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:42.860]  Jets coming in for a landing 30 miles away

[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.860]  Get your mozo rising
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:29.860]  Alright, let's get serious here, I got a loaded gust coming up
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.860]  I mean, we are loaded for bear today
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.860]  What happened is I came in here, I watched a lot of news, did a lot of research this morning
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.860]  And I came in and went back through the news
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:40.860]  And it was just such a companion of incredible stuff, I kind of overheated
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:44.860]  I mean, my head was actually spending a lot last hour
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:49.860]  It's just, each stack just totally shows you what's going on
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:56.860]  Just a whole stack of them robbing pension funds, robbing little kids, robbing hospitals, robbing foundations
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:01.860]  Just stealing and scamming and just fracking
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:05.860]  Or they run around trying to shut down all the clean energy
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:09.860]  And just bozo leftists everywhere that want Bernie Madoff
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:15.860]  9 out of 10 Californians want Bernie Madoff as the VP running mate of Bernie Sanders
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:18.860]  I mean, I don't get pleasure off how dumb they are
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.860]  But we've got to be able to defeat armies of drooling zombies
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:26.860]  Even if just 20% of us know how to tie our shoes or wipe our hind ends
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:32.860]  I mean, we're not on power trips, we just are, you know, we know we're alive, we're conscious
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:34.860]  We understand humanity's history, we know where we're going
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:42.860]  And we're not going to be ruled by a bunch of psychopaths and armies of drooling idiots
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:48.860]  I just know we're going to defeat you
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:53.860]  I know it, it's going to be a rough haul and it's not going to be, you know, water lost with Trump
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:03:01.860]  It's just a symbol, a gauge, an indices, an indicator
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:09.860]  A radar image
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:15.860]  I just think about the hundreds of millions of Chinese that live in total slave conditions
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:19.860]  And I think of the billions of people just living in the nightmare existence
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:29.860]  But so many of them are even happy compared to the richest trendy in the West
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:34.860]  With their distorted, twisted worldviews
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:40.860]  But I think about the well-meaning dumb-down liberal that really does want to help people and really does buy into all this guilt trip
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:44.860]  I mean, we could just get them to have a few original thoughts like fire
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:50.860]  It would spread in their minds and they would become awakened, illuminated
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:55.860]  I don't mean that in the Illuminati term, they're a counterfeit of that, but illuminated, enlightened
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:00.860]  Because once that happens, it's a chain reaction
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:08.860]  And all they need is someone reaching out to them and actually lovingly trying to wake them up
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:19.860]  And we won't get to all of them, and we won't save all of them, but you can get to some of these people
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:23.860]  And it's our job to try to see them as humans and not just laugh at them
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.860]  I don't know if I laugh at them, but it's like sad laugh
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:35.860]  Because they are so dangerous, and their controllers like Rachel Maddow that knows that, you know
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:41.860]  He is preying on those people is just so horrible
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:47.860]  They get off on lying to their audience, and that's what I can't stand
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:52.860]  And Len Beck uses the exact same tactics as the Left
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:57.860]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with a guess that got censored by Facebook
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:25.860]  Len Beck says it doesn't exist
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:33.860]  That is how dumb and clueless the average Bernie supporter is
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:38.860]  And now, out of the AP, Sanders is saying the Democratic Convention could be messy
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:43.860]  Sanders said the Democratic Party faces a choice of becoming more inclusive or maintaining the status quo
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:47.860]  I think if they make the right choice and open the doors to the working class people and young people
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:51.860]  And create the kind of dynamism that the Democratic Party needs, it's going to be messy
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:56.860]  Sanders said democracy is not always nice and quiet and gentle, but that is where the Democratic Party should go
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.860]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:32.860]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:37.860]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.860]  And optimizing your cellular energy at the same time
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:45.860]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:48.860]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:06.860]  Rob Dew joins us, you worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:07.860]  Tell us what brainforce did
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:11.860]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.860]  I get in here at 8.30, I was kind of run down
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.860]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:18.860]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.860]  I got my bottle of brainforce right there, I popped two of them
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:25.860]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.860]  It's got four and a half stars, people really love it
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:32.860]  Read about it, find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:38.860]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.860]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brainforce
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:46.860]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:48.860]  Took two more brainforce and came in
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:54.860]  You will find brainforce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:08:21.860]  Call 888-253-3139
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:27.860]  Former Clinton Handler and Insider will be joining us at the bottom of the hour
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:32.860]  Larry Nichols is battling lung cancer, he's so sick he can't even be on video Skype with us
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:36.860]  Somebody should pray for him, he's really fighting to stay alive at least through the campaign
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:40.860]  And this is serious, he's the big source for Inquirer next week
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:48.860]  On the newest Vince Foster police reports, documents and things that no one's had the courage to even publicly put out
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:53.860]  Last time he was on breaking down the Supreme Court justice and the fact that he was probably killed
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:59.860]  He actually had Homeland Security there coming into his parking lot, pulling out, the police came and they told the police go to hell
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:06.860]  And that's how serious this is, so this is very dangerous stuff, we're going to be breaking down coming up at the bottom of the hour
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:12.860]  He told us last week, watch, you'll see next week Vince Foster and Trump talking about it and of course that happened
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.860]  And he talks to the Supreme Court justice and others
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:21.860]  So this is very serious information, he's the original source on Whitewater, on Vince Foster, on the murder and the rest of it
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:27.860]  Then Roger Stone is on the cover of the New York Times today
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:34.860]  Dealing with the fact that they've sussed out the fact that he's the main political brain working with Trump
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:40.860]  Of course his business partner is quarterbacking, making sure that they don't steal the delegates, they've been successful so far on that front
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:46.860]  So a lot of big news with Stone joining us, I'll just stop there and let him tell you as much as he can
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:51.860]  But he was the most excited I've ever heard, he had a long conversation with him this morning, he just got off the phone with Trump
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:10:02.860]  Now what's front and center for us to understand is we're winning the information war as classical constitutionalist, classical liberals, patriots
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:12.860]  You can call us right wingers, whatever, but really we're for lower taxes, national sovereignty, family rights, tolerant of religion, tolerant of people's lifestyles, whatever
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:15.860]  Just don't try to run our lives
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:20.860]  And Zuckerberg in the last years met three times with the communist Chinese top censors, that's on record
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:26.860]  He told a few months ago on a panel in Germany, German Chancellor Merkel that he would censor people for her
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:30.860]  And was getting a handle on, we played that clip
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:35.860]  Facebook's hired former Stasi members, this is mainstream news to go after
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:39.860]  And then they call the police and they come arrest people that criticize open borders
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:49.860]  France is arresting the main presidential front runner and has indicted her, Marie Le Pen, for saying this radical Muslim invasion is as dangerous as the Nazi invasion
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:54.860]  So censorship is happening all over the world, they're reading from the same script, they're moving
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:59.860]  The collectivists are moving, the authoritarians are moving
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:04.860]  And a lady who I've seen Paul Watson interview many times, we featured her videos, Drudge is linked to him, but she's amazing
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:10.860]  I'd love to get her as a freelance reporter for us, I just got so busy, I've never reached out to her, but we're doing it now
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:20.860]  She was censored last week, and she has the screenshots, they're up on infowars.com, Facebook bans conservative for complaining about censorship
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:25.860]  And they said, we remove something you posted and basically suspended her and said, if you keep doing this, we're going to get rid of you
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:28.860]  This has happened to us, we've got screenshots over the years
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:32.860]  Memes about Benghazi and Navy Seals getting killed
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:37.860]  She showed their pictures, no blood, no nothing, and said, she lied, they died
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.860]  They should spend this for three days
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:46.860]  So, leaving the Washington Post is out today saying, Chinese style censorship is dangerous because it worked and it's here
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:52.860]  Now, Glenn Beck comes out and said, Glenn Beck blasts conservative critics as progressives on the right
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:56.860]  Right, Bart, and says it's not happening, and we just don't know how Facebook works
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:00.860]  Even as Facebook admits that their own employees did it, but claim they were rogue
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:05.860]  So, they're admitting they're doing it, but he says it's not happening
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:08.860]  Boy, what a friend, what a friend
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:14.860]  I mean, Zuckerberg admits it's going on, he says it's not, this is just an incredible betrayal
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:18.860]  Now, going to Lauren Southern of vrebel.media
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:26.860]  Lauren Southern is a contributor to the rebel.media from Vancouver, BC, she's a second year student studying political sciences at the University of Fraser Valley
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:30.860]  Who was well known for being very opinionated, and it just goes on from there
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:36.860]  Her videos have got millions of views, she just goes out and nicely talks to liberals and social justice lawyers, and they flip out
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:42.860]  They absolutely flip out, and now I guess she's going to be silenced, and the Canadian government is saying they're going to arrest you
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:47.860]  If you say transgenderism doesn't exist, whether you believe it or not, I should be able to say the moon's made of cheese if I want
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:52.860]  So, real tyranny's here, it's not coming, as Matt Dredge was warned last year
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:58.860]  By Supreme Court Justice at dinner, he came here to warn us, he's reposted that interview at dredgereport.com
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:06.860]  So, this is happening, nightfall is here on western liberty, unless we rise to the challenge and get more vocal and take action
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:13.860]  So, she's here to tell us what happened to her, her views on all this, and how she thinks we fight back against this
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:21.860]  I think we all speak out more, I think we produce more information, I think we file lawsuits, I think we get aggressive, because this is serious
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:24.860]  Warren Southern, thanks for joining us
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:26.860]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:31.860]  Wow, so, I mean, break this story down for us in your view on it
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:39.860]  Right, so I had a friend of mine post on Facebook that Donald Trump doesn't hate Muslims, he just wants to defend the country from ISIS
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:44.860]  There was no, nothing lewd about the comment, it was purely his political opinion
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.860]  And it was removed by Facebook, and he was issued a ban
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:56.860]  So, I took that post, he sent me a screenshot on Skype, and I shared it on my Facebook and said that it's absolutely disgusting
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:59.860]  What Facebook is doing to conservatives, and they need to stop
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:09.860]  And not only a couple minutes later, or maybe an hour later, I go check my Facebook and it does the whole, you've been logged out of your account
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:16.860]  That's always the note that you get when you're in crap with Zuckerberg, and then you log back in and it tells you what you did wrong
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:18.860]  I've been banned a few times now
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:20.860]  But now it's 30 days, I guess next is going to be forever
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:28.860]  I know, they will remove your account next time, which is kind of scary because I have 30,000 followers on there that I try to show my political opinions to
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:33.860]  But they removed my post for complaining about Facebook censoring conservatives
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:38.860]  Is this not total 1984, they admit they're doing, it's happening, there's a Senate investigation
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:44.860]  You talk about it, and then they remove it and say it doesn't exist, I mean that is incredible
[01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:51.860]  Yeah, oh, it's absolutely incredible, and you know what, I only, I've been banned before for posts that should not have been banned
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:56.860]  And I could not contact Facebook to get my account back and just had to wait a week
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:04.860]  If I had not been, if InfoWars had not reported on this, if Drudge Report had not reported on this, Facebook wouldn't have given a crap
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:08.860]  They would have left me banned and my account may have disappeared by now
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:18.860]  But they wanted to save face, they wanted to save face, so they contacted my personal email and said that this was caused by human error
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:27.860]  Now everyone knows the moderators, when you flag a post on Facebook, the moderator has to look at it and decide does this fit our community standards
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:34.860]  And that moderator looked at that post twice because he first banned the first one that was removed
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:40.860]  And then looked at the second one where I was complaining about it being removed and banned that one as well
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:47.860]  That wasn't just an accident, that was on purpose, and Facebook knows it, they've come out and finally admitted it
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:53.860]  And yet you still have establishment people like Glenn Beck coming out and saying this isn't happening
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:16:00.860]  I don't know why he's saying that, it's very strange, maybe it's because it's majority Trump supporters that are being banned
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:10.860]  I don't know, but it's definitely happening and it's very scary, you have 60% of millennials get the majority of their news from Facebook and that trending timeline
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:15.860]  How much damage is this doing that they're not getting both sides of the story?
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:21.860]  They're right and they're panicking, I'll tell you why, they're moving into authoritarianism, even the Washington Post says we're in danger now
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:24.860]  This is out of control and everybody's really got to have a gut check here
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:30.860]  Because you're so called liberals, you shouldn't be against other people's free speech
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:39.860]  This is outrageous, this is dangerous, if they can censor Laura Southern or Alex Jones or Matt Drudge who they admit they had orders to just block everything drudge
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:47.860]  The biggest news, they can block everybody next, I mean Obama has persecuted whistleblowers in the media more than all presidents combined
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:57.860]  We're in danger folks, Europe is arresting people for mild speech, come on let's not go down this rat hole, but Beck knows the censorship is coming
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:04.860]  And he wants to be the token conservative, the Judas Goat to lead people into the future and to say everything's okay
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:09.860]  Authoritarians always do this, in China they have an authorized church, they have authorized conservatives there
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:19.860]  Anybody else gets executed or imprisoned, I mean this is very dangerous, he wants the position of Judas Iscariot in this new system and that's why he's so dangerous
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:28.860]  Well yeah, you heard Tucker Carlson talk about it, he said it was the most disgusting thing he had ever seen the way that Glenn was sucking up to Zuckerberg
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:30.860]  And I mean I didn't think-
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:33.860]  He said he wants to be a manservant, a manservant
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:42.860]  Yeah, yeah, it's just, that's very scary to see and you know Beck and other establishment conservatives may think this isn't happening because at the moment
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:48.860]  Facebook can't really censor pages that have millions and millions of followers because people will notice, right?
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:59.860]  But what's happening is although this photo op apology tour occurred, at the base level, every day Facebook users just saw a photo op, they didn't see anything change in their day to day life
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:08.860]  My friends, I had my followers on Facebook send me things that they had been banned and censored for and almost all of them had something that they had been banned and censored for
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:15.860]  Absolutely, and there's the answer, let's talk about solutions, I think everybody should send you, Drudge, myself, everybody, we should make this a big news story which we've already done
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:22.860]  It's been Drudge and Info Wars and others that have forced this debate out there because we know the censorship was intensifying, we've been beating the drum for six months
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:31.860]  Everybody, send your screenshots, send what they told you to us, even it was six months ago, a year ago, we're going to create whole histories and do what the Senate probably isn't really doing
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:41.860]  And show the court of public opinion, no, this is organized censorship for good, wholesome, Americana ideas when the kill, last time I checked, I spent there for three months, the kill
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:52.860]  Donald Trump page organizing his assassination with tens of thousands of likes is still on Facebook, so we've got to all stand up against this, speak out against it and not let them normalize it
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:58.860]  What else, Lauren, do you think we should do to help resist this and respond to this?
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:08.860]  Well, yeah, first of all, exposing it, that was the solution to getting my account back was exposing it and embarrassing Facebook because they are embarrassed because restricting free speech is something embarrassing to do
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:20.860]  So they are being subversive about it and sneaky about it. And when you have, like you said, they've got a page that says Mary should have aborted Jesus up right now and they'll ban anti-Mohammed pages
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:34.860]  This is clear hypocrisy that needs to be exposed. The other thing that I've been doing is I just had Syrian girl talk to me recently and she's banned for 30 days for posting an anti-ISIS joke on Facebook
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:44.860]  and she lost her account for 30 days and I gave her the email of the woman who apologized to me and told her to email this woman and say give me my account back because I was wrongly banned
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:55.860]  I think I might just publicly publish this woman's email so that everyone who is banned can email her, we need to fight back, we need to not take this anymore because it is going to get worse if we don't
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:20:05.860]  Exactly, they're trying to create a normalcy bias so that we just think it's normal that there's mobile execution vans in China and every major city killing up to 20 people a day and selling their organs
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:17.860]  I mean that's been real news for 20 years, it's just no big deal now. Well they want to normalize that, oh yeah, you were against Benghazi, you sent a Washington Post link out
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:28.860]  We don't want that spreading, we're going to kill it, it's the credible stuff they don't like. When somebody does a good job at the New York Times and then drudge links to it, that's what they're killing
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:40.860]  We have lists of the stuff they've killed, they're really scared, not even so much of Alex Jones or Laura Southern, they're scared of journalists finally bucking the system, getting stuff out there and then the whole facade collapses
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:53.860]  They've now reached their Celsius Romanian moment when the dictator has no clothes, when the Associated Press does their biggest poll ever of educated readers and 6% trust the mainstream media
[01:20:53.860 --> 01:21:03.860]  So they know they've already collapsed, they just want to keep the facade up so the public doesn't figure that that's happened yet so we all still feel like we're alone
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:12.860]  Well if everything InfoWars puts out ends up being number one on Google, like it used to be for years, they changed their algorithm to block our Google bomb
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:21.860]  Where we would tell people go put this in a search engine, we'd make it the top, well that's people power, that's not rigging the system, it's a lot fairer than what they do just having orders come down
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:33.860]  Hey make this the top trend and then folks don't even know they got paid 20-30 million dollars for two days to make say a type of tennis shoe which I know happened from insiders, this is how they make their money, the trend
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:40.860]  They're creating a fake culture, they're making money out of it and screwing over the free market economy, not telling people it's advertising
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:53.860]  Now they're coming for our speech itself and our political ideas because we are the zeitgeist, we are the future, we are liberty, what's your view on that?
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:57.860]  I've lost her audio, do we have Lauren's audio?
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:14.860]  It died, well we had a lot of Skype issues lately, we have the most expensive fancy Skype system and regular Skype system as well, we go on backups and we were trying to go more and more to phone back up when folks are on with us via Skype but we will try to get her back on because this is such an exciting time to be alive
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:18.860]  This is such an amazing time, have her go to telephone, she can stay on video
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:19.860]  Hello
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:20.860]  Good, can you hear me now?
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:21.860]  Yeah, okay I'll hear you
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:23.860]  You heard my rant, sorry go ahead
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:35.860]  Yeah, no absolutely, the day I'll start trusting Facebook again is when we see Facebook censorship at the top of the trending section but we won't because these companies are only hiring young liberals
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:49.860]  They're so obsessed with diversity of gender, with diversity of race, what about diversity of thought, why not hire some conservatives to be moderators, why not hire some libertarians to work on what's trending
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:23:05.860]  But no, no, you've got only liberals and they've got a culture created there and yeah, no I agree with you that they want us to shut up and it's these young millennials that are working there, it's obviously the establishment that have influenced them and are continuing to influence them
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:18.860]  Sure, Facebook admitted that they made Black Lives Matter a horrible organization funded by George Soros to create destabilization, not to reform police, they made that the trend and what you said is so important
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:26.860]  The Nazis at Nuremberg, as you know, claimed, oh low level Nazis killed people in mass and had death camps and slave labor, we didn't know
[01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:34.860]  And then low level said we were just following orders, the truth is they hire these people, they have their bio, they have their algorithm, they have their posts from Facebook
[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:48.860]  They know that they want to censor people and are social justice warriors, they're teaching on colleges that censorship is good and ban costume parties, these are horrible foritarians and then they put them in there and claim, oh we didn't know they were doing this
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:53.860]  I mean, that is exactly what the Malish did with their youth brigades
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:24:11.860]  Well they're saying they're rogue and that this is human error, well the error is only happening to one side of the political spectrum, these errors are only happening to conservatives, well I would like Facebook to say or admit is have they fired a single person that has been rogue banning conservatives
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:27.860]  I bet the answer is no, they haven't, they are just going to go on their apology tour and continue doing what they are doing, well hoping that the press shuts up about it, but I know you won't, I know I'm hoping that other media stations won't, I won't shut up about it
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:30.860]  So they got a fight coming for them if they think that they can keep doing this
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:47.860]  Absolutely and Trump should start doing Facebook mentions himself every day, it'll be number one to see if they'll censor him and make it all about the censorship because here's the good news, I've always said resistance is victory, a military term they're not going
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:25:02.860]  And it's simple, if you just keep resisting it doesn't matter, the invader will finally fall, history shows that resistance is victory, you get stronger, you get smarter, you never give up, you never buy the propaganda, the more they censor, the more they show how desperate they are
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:12.860]  We just have to not get worn out by it and realize six months ago we knew this was going on, they said it isn't happening, we forced it out in the open, it's a victory, it's a victory
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:28.860]  So thank God you didn't just roll over and start self-censoring, hoping you could keep your Facebook and tone yourself down, which is pretty good reporting, the stuff you do is absolutely pro-freedom, very well done, just good reporting, very entertaining
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:32.860]  I mean how dare them try to censor you, but they leave up stuff about killing Donald Trump
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:46.860]  Yeah, thank you so much, I appreciate that, they started with trying to embarrass us, they started with trying to embarrass us by saying we were making conspiracies, they tried to embarrass us by saying we were faking
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:26:03.860]  And liberals tweeting me saying that I was tending to ban, and now we just keep coming out and finding that we are right about it, every single thing people were saying months ago that the trending section was being manipulated and Facebook wouldn't admit it, it took an employee, an ex-employee to come out and leak it
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:11.860]  People were saying the moderators were biased and Facebook wouldn't admit it, they were calling us conspiracy theorists saying we were crazy, and then we found out they've got rogue employees
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:31.860]  So they're going to try to embarrass us, they're going to try and wear us out, and I mean you're going to deal with a lot of that in life when you're speaking the truth is radical today where everything is lies, so you're going to have to deal with a lot of that today
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:46.860]  Laura, you're amazing, I would love it whenever you are, I mean I would love to have you if you want to come do some reporting for us at the DNC or RNC and work with Leanne McHugh and the rest of the crew, I know I'm serious, because we're about to hire more reporters and I'd like even if they're freelance or work four or five times a year for certain projects
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:27:01.860]  Go to Bilderberg, go to Davos, cover stuff for us because you're smart, you know what's going on, you're tenacious, but you're also a lady and so I hope you'll be working with InfoWars more in the future because I want to stand together, but what you just said is so paramount
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:25.860]  There's a 1984 system telling the truth is a revolutionary act and that's why they're coming after you, that's why they're trying to shut you up and we just have to understand that they call us conspiracy theorists, they would have urban warfare drills in the towns I lived in, it'd be in the local paper, I'd cover it on syndicated radio and they'd have major papers say it didn't happen, I was a conspiracy theorist when it was in the local paper and I had video
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:39.860]  So exactly now you're experiencing it, you're being censored and they say you're a conspiracy theorist, again folks I'm talking over because her Skype has been going out and we're going to get her back up to say bye, but it is just such an amazing time to be alive
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:51.860]  It's the animating contest of liberty, she didn't shut up, she didn't back off, most people do and I've had folks in Facebook say hey be nice, we'll let you be successful and I go go is that from Facebook, they're kind of like
[01:27:51.860 --> 01:28:00.860]  yeah would you like to be able to go meet with Facebook, see quite frankly it's kind of like you want to, there's a meeting in New York, you want to go, that happened this week
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:08.860]  But that's private, I'm not going to go there, the point is, if I say something's in confidence I don't go there, but believe me I could be right where Glenn Beck is and more
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:16.860]  Okay, they want to get me in the fold, I'm not doing it, okay, I'm not stupid, I don't want to preside over the death of the frickin first amendment, excuse me
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:25.860]  Lauren Southern, you are amazing, the final thing I want to say to the floor here is, thanks for letting me talk over, I get so excited, the rebel.media, the rebel.media
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:31.860]  The number one thing is what Matt Drudge says, he's probably saying this right now, and that he reposted his interview with us up there saying it
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:43.860]  Get away from Facebook, use it to point at yourself, use it to point out that we know we won't have it forever, use it to expose it but we need to promote our own media, our own outfits, our own system and folks need to value it or we're going to lose it
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.860]  Where else can people follow you?
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:55.860]  They can follow me at my Twitter at Lauren underscore Southern, my Facebook page, if you just look at my name, you'll find it, and of course the rebel.media, which we're trying to emulate
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:29:04.860]  Independent media in Canada, like there is in the States with yourself and Breitbart and other independent media sources. Thank you so much for having me on Alex
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:12.860]  You bet, I am just so excited by the victories we're having, I mean I think we're having major victories forcing this out in the open
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:16.860]  Do you think Facebook is going to back off or just continue this Lauren?
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:27.860]  I think they'll continue it as long as they are allowed to, I think they will continue it until they hope we give up, but like you said, we won't and it's all about resistance
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:31.860]  Alright, well great job Lauren Southern, we really appreciate your work, God bless you
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:38.860]  Alright, we're going to be back with the concept of Clinton Insider who predicted the Vince Foster stuff was coming out this week and more coming out next week, Larry Nichols
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:43.860]  And notice, I promote Breitbart, I promote World Net Daily, Daily Caller, everybody, we're all in this together for free speech
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:48.860]  I'd support Michael Moore if they were censoring him, I mean it's all about free speech folks, come on, it's America
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:30:11.860]  The only thing worse than an angry mob is a dumb angry mob, you've got Salon dumbing down their readers, calling Trump a neo-fascist reaction to the extreme disembedness of the economy from social relations
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:25.860]  And talking about how markets have become pure abstraction, WTF, and on Infowars you can read and watch the video from Mark Dice of Bernie Sanders supporters reacting favorably to the announcement that Bernie Madoff will be his vice president
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:33.860]  That's right, the man sentenced to 150 years for defrauding thousands of investors of billions of dollars, that is how dumb and clueless the average Bernie supporter is
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:43.860]  And now, out of the AP, Sanders is saying the Democratic convention could be messy, Sanders said the Democratic Party faces a choice of becoming more inclusive or maintaining the status quo
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:52.860]  I think if they make the right choice and open the doors to the working class people and young people and create the kind of dynamism that the Democratic Party needs, it's going to be messy, Sanders said
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:56.860]  Democracy is not always nice and quiet and gentle, but that is where the Democratic Party should go
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:06.860]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com
