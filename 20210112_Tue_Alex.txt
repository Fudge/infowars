[00:00.000 --> 00:08.480]  It was a year ago I began to play air raid sirens at the start of the broadcast.
[00:08.480 --> 00:13.880]  I told you the globalists tried to bring us into martial law during the contested election.
[00:13.880 --> 00:15.680]  They said they would.
[00:15.680 --> 00:16.680]  And now we're here.
[00:16.680 --> 00:21.800]  Trump has declared a national emergency, a particular martial law emergency in D.C.
[00:21.800 --> 00:27.640]  They have manipulated right wing forces being programmed through the Q Army to launch a
[00:27.640 --> 00:32.360]  tax this weekend across the United States, so Joe Biden can bring in martial law.
[00:32.360 --> 00:37.480]  Trump is calling for calm and peace and saying do not be part of this, but the CIAQ operatives
[00:37.480 --> 00:41.480]  are telling you that's not really Trump's plan, prepare to launch your attacks.
[00:41.480 --> 00:44.400]  We're going to break it all down coming up today.
[00:44.400 --> 00:47.720]  I'm not blaming most people involved in Q stuff, some people in the name of Q have done
[00:47.720 --> 00:48.720]  good research.
[00:48.720 --> 00:52.560]  I'm saying the people in control of it and what they're doing are setting us up.
[00:52.560 --> 00:55.560]  Here I am last night telling you about the civil emergency coming.
[00:55.560 --> 01:01.920]  I told you on Sunday exclusively this was already about to happen and now it's unfolded.
[01:01.920 --> 01:08.560]  Remember three months ago before the election, I watched the website 79days.news for the
[01:08.560 --> 01:16.640]  79 days of hell and a lot of people said, Joe, Trump's going to win in a landslide.
[01:16.640 --> 01:18.720]  You don't have a problem.
[01:18.720 --> 01:21.800]  Trust the plan and know that he's invincible.
[01:21.800 --> 01:27.040]  I said then, yeah, all the internal poll numbers show Trump's going to win a lot bigger in
[01:27.040 --> 01:28.040]  swing states.
[01:28.040 --> 01:32.960]  He won last time four years ago, but the enemy's body language and what they were saying and
[01:32.960 --> 01:40.240]  what they were doing told me they were going to steal it and at 47 years of age, I finally
[01:40.240 --> 01:48.680]  learned one thing, go with my gut on January 6th as we're sitting there waiting for Trump
[01:48.680 --> 01:49.680]  to speak.
[01:49.680 --> 01:56.160]  I turned to my crew there in the front row and I said, we got to get to the Capitol.
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.920]  What if somebody creates a disturbance there and my crew said to me, oh, there's police
[02:00.920 --> 02:06.840]  there will be handled and I had this burning desire to get my people and leave.
[02:06.840 --> 02:12.360]  They said, no, no, no, 20 minutes before Trump finishes, he will then let you out to go lead
[02:12.360 --> 02:17.800]  the crowd and that indeed happened.
[02:17.800 --> 02:21.400]  And as soon as I get out there, hundreds of thousands had already left and I had a bad
[02:21.400 --> 02:26.880]  feeling as soon as I got there, I saw tear gas and I saw what was unfolding and the hundred
[02:26.880 --> 02:32.760]  antifa thugs along with a bizarre paramilitary group that started the fight with the police
[02:32.760 --> 02:35.320]  and then breached the Capitol and the police then stood down.
[02:35.320 --> 02:41.280]  This was a false flag and this was used to finish up a 79 days of hell.
[02:41.280 --> 02:45.560]  And so now I want to tell this or something, what is about to happen in this country is
[02:45.560 --> 02:51.720]  going to be so hellish because my guts telling me not just my instincts, but my spirit is
[02:51.720 --> 02:55.280]  and not just my intellect, but my spirit.
[02:55.280 --> 02:59.640]  They're going to stage false flags in this country and they're going to attack state
[02:59.640 --> 03:05.760]  capitals around the United States and claim that Patriots did it.
[03:05.760 --> 03:09.080]  I had constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes on last night.
[03:09.080 --> 03:17.440]  He told me privately weeks ago that the globalists are manipulating through a chance the Q people,
[03:17.440 --> 03:20.920]  the more suggestible of them to go out and launch attacks.
[03:20.920 --> 03:24.440]  And indeed, we know that antifa started the fight, but Q people were the ones that then
[03:24.440 --> 03:31.360]  went into the Capitol and that gave the media what they needed to demonize the Trump supporters.
[03:31.360 --> 03:34.600]  And they were the ones with the zip ties and military members that really believe they
[03:34.600 --> 03:40.440]  were there to free the children under the Capitol and they were going to arrest Pelosi
[03:40.440 --> 03:46.160]  and all this kind of larping exercise that isn't virtual reality, but is augmented reality.
[03:46.160 --> 03:52.520]  So just like two years ago, I bought this armored vehicle because I knew that antifa
[03:52.520 --> 03:56.040]  would attack us in the streets and the civil unrest was coming.
[03:56.040 --> 04:00.120]  Just like I said, 79 days of hell was coming.
[04:00.120 --> 04:05.920]  We are now going to see the season of the false flag.
[04:05.920 --> 04:08.440]  Do not go to capitals armed.
[04:08.440 --> 04:11.560]  Do not be part of the demonstrations on January 20th.
[04:11.560 --> 04:13.360]  It's run by the globalist.
[04:13.360 --> 04:17.240]  There isn't some secret plan to overthrow things so Trump wins.
[04:17.240 --> 04:21.200]  All you're doing is cementing things as domestic terrorists so Biden can pass a new Patriot
[04:21.200 --> 04:22.960]  Act and come after you.
[04:22.960 --> 04:31.560]  So I decry all offensive violence and I'm asking everyone to understand that Q is an AI globalist
[04:31.560 --> 04:37.240]  chai com big tech system to manipulate you and that if you think you're on a secret
[04:37.240 --> 04:39.200]  mission for the president, you're wrong.
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.680]  Do not be part of it.
[04:40.680 --> 04:43.800]  Do not go out and attack governor's mansions.
[04:43.800 --> 04:46.040]  Already a bunch of governor's mansions have been attacked.
[04:46.040 --> 04:49.080]  It's been covered up because they want the main attack to happen.
[04:49.080 --> 04:50.560]  That was the simulation test.
[04:50.560 --> 04:52.080]  Now they're launching the main operation.
[04:52.080 --> 04:58.640]  I'll cover it all live on the show and then FullWars.com for a live show and band on video.
[04:58.640 --> 04:59.640]  Stay with us.
[04:59.640 --> 05:00.640]  Three, two, one.
[05:00.640 --> 05:01.640]  Here we go.
[05:01.640 --> 05:02.640]  It's back in stock.
[05:02.640 --> 05:04.640]  It's been sold out for over eight months.
[05:04.640 --> 05:08.240]  We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock.
[05:08.240 --> 05:09.240]  Let me tell you real quick about it.
[05:09.240 --> 05:12.280]  With the power of quail egg concentrate, pollen block acts differently.
[05:12.280 --> 05:15.360]  The traditional line of history means it was clinically studied to alleviate seasonal
[05:15.360 --> 05:19.640]  distress symptoms by helping to clear signage passages and aiding respiratory function.
[05:19.640 --> 05:20.640]  It's amazing.
[05:20.640 --> 05:22.040]  Folks absolutely love it.
[05:22.040 --> 05:25.160]  And again, France has been shut down so we couldn't get it.
[05:25.160 --> 05:30.160]  Now a limited supply is back in stock, 25% off at FullWars.com.
[05:30.160 --> 05:33.680]  Pollen block again is available in this one minute ad.
[05:33.680 --> 05:37.000]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.080]  in because it works naturally unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that
[05:41.080 --> 05:44.840]  makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[05:44.840 --> 05:46.360]  This is naturally occurring.
[05:46.360 --> 05:51.000]  It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress and it's passed on somehow
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.880]  through their eggs to us.
[05:52.880 --> 05:55.000]  You chew up the pills, they taste great.
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  It's available again.
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  infowarsstore.com, pollen block.
[05:58.000 --> 06:24.320]  infowarsstore.com where store leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[06:24.320 --> 06:31.560]  Well, you live to see world government and you live to see the attempt to take down the
[06:31.560 --> 06:32.560]  Republic.
[06:32.560 --> 06:33.560]  It's live.
[06:33.560 --> 06:34.560]  It's happening now.
[06:34.560 --> 06:35.560]  It's not a football game.
[06:35.560 --> 06:37.440]  It's not a basketball game.
[06:37.440 --> 06:38.440]  It's the real deal.
[06:38.440 --> 06:42.920]  And the globalist, what's their ideology?
[06:42.920 --> 06:43.920]  It is your death.
[06:43.920 --> 06:44.920]  It is your destruction.
[06:44.920 --> 06:54.920]  Oh, he's going to kill the pain because you won't be alive.
[06:54.920 --> 07:10.840]  It will stop war because there will be no more humans.
[07:10.840 --> 07:16.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Tuesday transmission, January 12th, 2021, and I was
[07:16.560 --> 07:17.560]  born for this.
[07:17.560 --> 07:19.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[07:19.000 --> 07:23.880]  So are you the pain killer?
[07:23.880 --> 07:27.320]  This is the pain killer.
[07:27.320 --> 07:36.120]  Yeah, I got to tell you, I'm not happy about what's going down, but I am on fire because
[07:36.120 --> 07:41.680]  you know the allegory and the Christian parable of Lord of the Rings, it is Christian, according
[07:41.680 --> 07:42.960]  to the author J.R.
[07:42.960 --> 07:49.720]  Tolkien, I agree with him that when the goblins are near, the sword sting glows bright blue
[07:49.720 --> 07:50.720]  and it's on fire.
[07:50.720 --> 07:57.400]  I've never seen sting glow so blue.
[07:57.400 --> 08:03.040]  And so I just can't help being as high as a kite because the evil is rising and you know
[08:03.040 --> 08:06.040]  Newtonian physics has been proven to be very accurate.
[08:06.040 --> 08:09.320]  More advanced the technology gets, the more they know it's absolutely true.
[08:09.320 --> 08:12.680]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[08:12.680 --> 08:20.640]  They've noticed with spectrometers and supercomputers that just looking at a star that could be
[08:20.640 --> 08:28.200]  trillions of miles away, thousands of trillions of miles away affects it.
[08:28.200 --> 08:29.200]  That's consciousness.
[08:29.200 --> 08:31.120]  That's God's will projected through us.
[08:31.120 --> 08:34.640]  Okay, let me give you the horrifying news, let's just get it out on the table because
[08:34.640 --> 08:36.200]  you'd want to know about something bad.
[08:36.200 --> 08:38.120]  Your house was getting robbed.
[08:38.120 --> 08:41.640]  If you worked down the street and somebody says, hey, there's guys breaking in your house,
[08:41.640 --> 08:48.680]  they're beating your wife up, they're tying her up, your neighbor's not being a bad person.
[08:48.680 --> 08:51.120]  Your neighbor's saying, hey, you better get home and I'm getting my shotgun and going
[08:51.120 --> 08:52.120]  over there.
[08:52.120 --> 08:54.520]  So I'm that guy.
[08:54.520 --> 09:02.680]  I'm telling you that they're not just putting your wife in handcuffs, they're skinning her
[09:02.680 --> 09:06.960]  mother earth and the ones killing the earth, the ones saying they're the protectors of
[09:06.960 --> 09:07.960]  it.
[09:07.960 --> 09:11.400]  And as things get worse and worse, they tell us it's human's fault, the earth's dying
[09:11.400 --> 09:15.200]  when they're the ones in their own literature saying they're overriding it.
[09:15.200 --> 09:18.240]  So let's understand that.
[09:18.240 --> 09:28.680]  We're in the midst of a global, new world-ordered revolution against humanity.
[09:28.680 --> 09:33.680]  And this has been foretold, whether you believe in God or whatever it is or our psychic vision
[09:33.680 --> 09:38.080]  of the future, because the future is the present, is the past, it's all a space-time continuum.
[09:38.080 --> 09:41.040]  You can move up and down.
[09:41.040 --> 09:43.000]  We saw this psychically coming.
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.480]  We were warned thousands of years ago.
[09:48.480 --> 09:53.880]  And you're not just by John on the Isle of Patmos, I mean, there are Indian teachings
[09:53.880 --> 09:55.560]  even older saying basically the same thing.
[09:55.560 --> 10:01.120]  So you have to understand, folks, this has been known for a long time and our will is
[10:01.120 --> 10:02.120]  great.
[10:02.120 --> 10:03.120]  Our spiritual power is great.
[10:03.120 --> 10:04.520]  Our consciousness is amazing.
[10:04.520 --> 10:07.280]  Our psychic power is unbelievable.
[10:07.280 --> 10:11.480]  We're all like super powerful beings.
[10:11.480 --> 10:14.040]  We're just babies.
[10:14.040 --> 10:19.480]  And the globalist and other species of twisted failure in the universe are ancient and hunchback,
[10:19.480 --> 10:23.200]  but they can kick us around when we're embryos and pretend they're God.
[10:23.200 --> 10:25.520]  But that's all they've got.
[10:25.520 --> 10:32.320]  Imagine a tadpole that becomes God or something damn close.
[10:32.320 --> 10:37.800]  And then there's this some hunchback demonic parent that knows what it becomes and envies
[10:37.800 --> 10:40.720]  it so it wants to go down and destroy it.
[10:40.720 --> 10:43.200]  But you didn't destroy the final product.
[10:43.200 --> 10:55.280]  You tried to kill in the womb the signature, but killing the signature is different than
[10:55.280 --> 11:00.040]  killing the thing itself.
[11:00.040 --> 11:02.200]  And I am that thing.
[11:02.200 --> 11:04.480]  The enemy fears.
[11:04.480 --> 11:05.480]  I am.
[11:05.480 --> 11:15.080]  And it doesn't want us to declare that and so are you the thing that should not be.
[11:15.080 --> 11:21.520]  Someday maybe even death would die to quote Lovecraft.
[11:21.520 --> 11:29.480]  So I will focus my mind and I will come back and I will tell you the horrifying news.
[11:29.480 --> 11:35.160]  Now I talked to an individual that's very well known and a household name who spoke
[11:35.160 --> 11:41.000]  with Giuliani late last night and Giuliani said the word is we've been indicted in D.C.
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.280]  Trump, Giuliani and Don Jr.
[11:45.280 --> 11:48.720]  And I said, but couldn't that be the whole pressure of them to resign and they're not
[11:48.720 --> 11:58.120]  going to release the indictment and the individuals like, yes, you're finishing my sentences.
[11:58.120 --> 11:59.560]  And so we work and it all out.
[11:59.560 --> 12:02.160]  We also found out what the plan was.
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.640]  They planned to swat team me in D.C. and blame me for what happened, but that didn't
[12:07.640 --> 12:09.960]  go the way they wanted because the police refused to do it.
[12:09.960 --> 12:10.960]  We confirmed that.
[12:10.960 --> 12:16.480]  Hell, I saw it happen, but I'll be honest, I was so exhausted and I just eaten a big
[12:16.480 --> 12:20.640]  meal on Thursday afternoon and under stress, drank a half bottle of vodka.
[12:20.640 --> 12:25.280]  So I didn't didn't even care when 100 police cars came for me.
[12:25.280 --> 12:29.240]  I mean, I haven't even told you this whole story yet, ladies and gentlemen, but I will
[12:29.240 --> 12:33.000]  tell you all of it.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.240]  You're like, Jones, my family goes, why do you tell these stories about yourself if you're
[12:36.240 --> 12:37.240]  so honest?
[12:37.240 --> 12:38.240]  Can't you still?
[12:38.240 --> 12:39.400]  Truth is my weapon.
[12:39.400 --> 12:42.760]  It's all I have.
[12:42.760 --> 12:45.560]  But I now see the entire picture more than ever.
[12:45.560 --> 12:49.840]  I mean, every damn piece of the puzzle, I can zoom in to almost the subatomic level.
[12:49.840 --> 12:54.360]  I can see the matrix and I know what their next moves are.
[12:54.360 --> 12:55.360]  I know how to stop them.
[12:55.360 --> 13:02.400]  I know what's unfolding and I understand how I underestimated Q. Q is 100 percent globalist
[13:02.400 --> 13:07.040]  intelligence, 100 percent what's left of the U.S. government and it hates Trump and it
[13:07.040 --> 13:10.560]  hates America and it's planning a giant violent uprising to bring down the country.
[13:10.560 --> 13:14.520]  That doesn't mean you're bad if you were part of it or use the movement to educate people.
[13:14.520 --> 13:18.400]  You're not Q. That's what makes you pledge allegiance to it so it can round you up.
[13:18.400 --> 13:22.160]  They're planning truck bombs, mass shootings, bombings of capitals all over.
[13:22.160 --> 13:26.080]  I told you that Sunday from D.C. police and the FBI.
[13:26.080 --> 13:32.880]  I mean, that was exclusively from them and Army Special Operations Command, who are totally
[13:32.880 --> 13:37.000]  freaked out and they go, finally, okay, yeah, no, this is Q. It's an A.I. op run by the
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.720]  globalist, probably the Chinese.
[13:38.720 --> 13:41.520]  It's going to activate the patriots who are pissed about what's happening to have a huge
[13:41.520 --> 13:42.520]  violent uprising.
[13:42.520 --> 13:45.560]  They've secretly declared a national emergency.
[13:45.560 --> 13:46.760]  Tell people I went on Sunday.
[13:46.760 --> 13:47.760]  I told you this.
[13:47.760 --> 13:48.760]  It's on record.
[13:48.760 --> 13:52.840]  Today, emergency announced, FBI says, look at Dredge report's headline.
[13:52.840 --> 13:53.840]  Pull up.
[13:53.840 --> 13:55.840]  I mean, it talks about huge explosion.
[13:55.840 --> 13:57.800]  You've got to dredge for me.
[13:57.800 --> 14:04.040]  Talks about national emergency, absolute meltdown.
[14:04.040 --> 14:07.280]  If Trump quote, indicted or if Trump removed.
[14:07.280 --> 14:08.280]  No, no, no.
[14:08.280 --> 14:12.200]  That's what they'll use to indict or remove Trump 25th Amendment.
[14:12.200 --> 14:14.920]  FBI warns of huge uprising.
[14:14.920 --> 14:19.880]  The Capitol was a dud because Trump supporters by the hundreds of thousands fought the couple
[14:19.880 --> 14:23.280]  hundred Antifa and other operatives and stopped them invading.
[14:23.280 --> 14:27.480]  That's why they had to finally order Capitol Police to open the doors and let them in.
[14:27.480 --> 14:32.160]  Then the officer that was given the order, we're not sure by who probably Charles Schumer
[14:32.160 --> 14:33.160]  committed suicide.
[14:33.160 --> 14:38.800]  If you believe that, I got a bridge in Arizona and some oceanfront property.
[14:38.800 --> 14:41.040]  I'm ready to sell you.
[14:41.040 --> 14:43.080]  So all the pieces is falling together.
[14:43.080 --> 14:44.680]  We can stop this now.
[14:44.680 --> 14:47.240]  This is bigger than putting Trump in for another administration.
[14:47.240 --> 14:50.520]  They want martial law and gun confiscation to begin.
[14:50.520 --> 14:55.280]  As Biden said, I will defeat the second amendment and the NRA he said it yesterday and it's
[14:55.280 --> 14:56.280]  on.
[14:56.280 --> 15:01.320]  They're saying all over their flooding Facebook, flooding Twitter, oh, you better be a man
[15:01.320 --> 15:07.160]  and get out there and blow up some Capitol buildings.
[15:07.160 --> 15:08.520]  They stole the election.
[15:08.520 --> 15:09.520]  They're discredited.
[15:09.520 --> 15:10.520]  They're a fraud.
[15:10.520 --> 15:11.960]  So they need violence.
[15:11.960 --> 15:15.560]  Don't be part of it.
[15:15.560 --> 15:17.320]  It's a lie.
[15:17.320 --> 15:21.880]  It's a setup and we now know the lie.
[15:21.880 --> 15:22.960]  We now know the setup.
[15:22.960 --> 15:31.360]  We know every angle of it and by the grace of God, we're still on air for this moment.
[15:31.360 --> 15:34.400]  Dug in hard when everybody else is being shut down because we'd already been persecuted
[15:34.400 --> 15:35.400]  first.
[15:35.400 --> 15:39.920]  We knew the mission and it's all the Holy Spirit, the divine transmission I am receiving
[15:39.920 --> 15:43.520]  and I just open myself up to receive the transmission and give it as clearly as I can to you.
[15:43.520 --> 15:44.520]  This is not me.
[15:44.520 --> 15:58.480]  I'm telling you, I'm going to give you the transmission straight ahead, stay with us.
[15:58.480 --> 16:05.040]  The post industrial world, that's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio
[16:05.040 --> 16:10.120]  de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[16:10.120 --> 16:15.280]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post industrial world plow-swap with the
[16:15.280 --> 16:16.280]  Davos Group.
[16:16.280 --> 16:21.360]  Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the great reset is Agenda
[16:21.360 --> 16:22.360]  2030.
[16:22.360 --> 16:26.360]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[16:26.360 --> 16:29.360]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[16:29.360 --> 16:35.640]  It is making the population war by design so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy
[16:35.640 --> 16:37.400]  over you and your family.
[16:37.400 --> 16:43.040]  They're destroying civilization, rebuilding in their dystopic image.
[16:43.040 --> 16:46.960]  We are fighting this at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[16:46.960 --> 16:51.760]  We are fighting for a pro-human future and we need you to get the facts, to research
[16:51.760 --> 16:54.080]  it and share it with others and join the fight.
[16:54.080 --> 16:55.080]  God bless you.
[16:55.080 --> 16:58.080]  Visit us, spread the word at infowars.com.
[16:58.080 --> 17:00.280]  Hey Alex, how you doing, man?
[17:00.280 --> 17:02.600]  Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[17:02.600 --> 17:03.600]  Yes, sir.
[17:03.600 --> 17:04.600]  Yes, sir.
[17:04.600 --> 17:09.120]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that first shipment
[17:09.120 --> 17:11.720]  of living defense in from Utah.
[17:11.720 --> 17:15.360]  I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update.
[17:15.360 --> 17:20.600]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones' show, I'm going to tell the world
[17:20.600 --> 17:23.800]  about living defense and what it did for me personally.
[17:23.800 --> 17:27.480]  Now look, I'm 64 years old, going on 20.
[17:27.480 --> 17:32.760]  I used to live at infowars store products and by the way, I bought $800 worth the other
[17:32.760 --> 17:35.880]  night, so I'm doing what I can, brother.
[17:35.880 --> 17:41.240]  So what my contention is, why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting
[17:41.240 --> 17:43.200]  a couple bottles of living defense?
[17:43.200 --> 17:46.280]  Now you got to follow that up with the micro-DS.
[17:46.280 --> 17:47.280]  I learned that.
[17:47.280 --> 17:50.040]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[17:50.040 --> 17:51.040]  We didn't know.
[17:51.040 --> 17:52.040]  We didn't screen your call.
[17:52.040 --> 17:55.840]  We had no idea and I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about living
[17:55.840 --> 18:01.240]  defense, living defense, living defense, living defense.
[18:01.240 --> 18:07.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:07.240 --> 18:22.080]  I'm going to explain how the AI targeting works.
[18:22.080 --> 18:45.160]  Using AI systems, you noticed years ago, Google would only put you in conservative areas of
[18:45.160 --> 18:49.520]  your conservative, liberal areas of your liberal, putting you in groups, that was testing the
[18:49.520 --> 18:53.200]  propaganda and stimulus on you on a psychological test.
[18:53.200 --> 18:59.080]  So through the Q movement, they would already target a great people, mainly veterans, law
[18:59.080 --> 19:04.000]  enforcement, others that understood the world was more complex, understood there was globalism,
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.880]  understood there was pedophile networks, understood all this real stuff.
[19:06.880 --> 19:11.160]  So it would load in your belief system exactly the way you thought it was.
[19:11.160 --> 19:16.960]  So you thought this is dead on and even give you subgroups of Q the way you wanted it.
[19:16.960 --> 19:24.080]  But then it would say now you're on a mission to find this clue online or decipher this.
[19:24.080 --> 19:29.400]  And then a Q leader, many of them operatives would then, oh, this is what the answer is
[19:29.400 --> 19:33.880]  and leads you down that road so that the system itself wasn't putting out the orders, but
[19:33.880 --> 19:39.640]  their subgroups, their sub priest class was sending out the directive.
[19:39.640 --> 19:41.120]  And then, oh, we're going to arrest them.
[19:41.120 --> 19:42.120]  The purge is coming.
[19:42.120 --> 19:43.120]  We're going to kill them.
[19:43.120 --> 19:47.800]  I mean, all this allowed on these message boards, all this prepared, and it was meant
[19:47.800 --> 19:53.920]  to be a giant insane rampage, handcuffing, killing members of Congress, you know, lockdowns
[19:53.920 --> 19:57.640]  led by antifogs, the shock force, all in unison.
[19:57.640 --> 20:00.840]  But the Patriots fought back and tackled them and helped the police.
[20:00.840 --> 20:03.600]  So finally they had to order police stand down to let them in.
[20:03.600 --> 20:07.760]  And the guy that gave the order commits suicide conveniently.
[20:07.760 --> 20:08.960]  I mean, this is serious.
[20:08.960 --> 20:10.160]  So this didn't work.
[20:10.160 --> 20:12.800]  So now they need 2.0.
[20:12.800 --> 20:14.560]  That's the Saturday and Sunday.
[20:14.560 --> 20:16.200]  They're now saying we're going to attack.
[20:16.200 --> 20:17.200]  It's the storm.
[20:17.200 --> 20:18.720]  We're going to hit the capitals.
[20:18.720 --> 20:21.000]  We're going to hit DC.
[20:21.000 --> 20:26.280]  And so Trump, knowing he's got to stop, small percentage of his own base being mind controlled
[20:26.280 --> 20:33.600]  using their love of America and Trump and fighting the globalist to then trigger a mass uprising
[20:33.600 --> 20:36.800]  that brings in the gun control and permanent martial law.
[20:36.800 --> 20:41.080]  Even for all you tough guys on m4wars.com and banned off video, that's the commenting
[20:41.080 --> 20:42.800]  who we know are operatives, most of you.
[20:42.800 --> 20:44.840]  Oh, Jones, you're a whip, you're a shill.
[20:44.840 --> 20:47.520]  You never beat tyranny, you know, without violence.
[20:47.520 --> 20:50.960]  Really, most of the revolutions of the last century were nonviolent.
[20:50.960 --> 20:53.240]  They were social.
[20:53.240 --> 20:54.240]  They were noncompliant.
[20:54.240 --> 21:03.000]  Really, Mahatma Gandhi defeated the British after thousands of uprisings over 300 years.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  And he did it with civil disobedience.
[21:05.000 --> 21:10.680]  Martin Luther King did black folks running around murdering and killing white people
[21:10.680 --> 21:11.680]  ever get them freed.
[21:11.680 --> 21:16.480]  No, because most whites didn't know slaves, 98% didn't.
[21:16.480 --> 21:21.480]  But when folks saying Christian hymns and they watched them get their heads beat in,
[21:21.480 --> 21:26.200]  white people like my grandparents and their parents said, this is BS, man.
[21:26.200 --> 21:27.200]  We're not bullies.
[21:27.200 --> 21:30.200]  We're not doing this anymore.
[21:30.200 --> 21:32.520]  We're Christians.
[21:32.520 --> 21:35.600]  So nothing ever got resolved without violence.
[21:35.600 --> 21:36.600]  Okay.
[21:36.600 --> 21:38.320]  Well, let's take that line and say it's true.
[21:38.320 --> 21:40.000]  Sometimes violence does resolve things.
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.560]  Once the enemy starts it, once you've educated the public about who the enemy is, once it's
[21:43.560 --> 21:44.560]  a clear cut.
[21:44.560 --> 21:48.800]  But the globalists are all about you not knowing who did it.
[21:48.800 --> 21:51.880]  They're going to set off truck bombs in major cities this weekend or next week.
[21:51.880 --> 21:52.880]  That's their plan.
[21:52.880 --> 21:53.880]  I told you it's coming.
[21:53.880 --> 21:56.880]  You already saw it.
[21:56.880 --> 21:59.520]  They're going to stage mass shootings and they're going to put it all over the news
[21:59.520 --> 22:04.520]  and say, you did it.
[22:04.520 --> 22:09.480]  So I will be out at the Capitol this weekend, but not with guns.
[22:09.480 --> 22:10.480]  I knew this was all coming.
[22:10.480 --> 22:13.840]  I'll be in an armored vehicle.
[22:13.840 --> 22:16.640]  And I'm going to be documenting who did what and what happened, but I can't be in all
[22:16.640 --> 22:17.640]  50 capitals.
[22:17.640 --> 22:23.880]  So go out there, pray to Jesus, have your video camera and document every person because
[22:23.880 --> 22:26.200]  you can't miss these Antifa.
[22:26.200 --> 22:27.320]  You can't miss.
[22:27.320 --> 22:31.360]  You'll see Chinese state party people like the guy that planned the pipe bombs they just
[22:31.360 --> 22:32.360]  showed.
[22:32.360 --> 22:33.360]  You'll see Chinese agents.
[22:33.360 --> 22:34.360]  They'll all be wearing masks.
[22:34.360 --> 22:38.280]  You'll see Antifa wearing black that were pink bandanas and signifiers.
[22:38.280 --> 22:41.440]  And then guys in camo covering their faces with the backpacks as well.
[22:41.440 --> 22:47.760]  They are deep state mercs, Dincor, Halliburton, you name it.
[22:47.760 --> 22:51.840]  They're making a full move on us.
[22:51.840 --> 22:54.720]  So Gateway Punnett gets it right.
[22:54.720 --> 22:58.480]  Do not attend arm protest at state capitals for an operation possible.
[22:58.480 --> 23:01.520]  No, there's no possible about it.
[23:01.520 --> 23:04.960]  Sinister plot hatched by radical left to take away gun rights.
[23:04.960 --> 23:05.960]  That's it.
[23:05.960 --> 23:06.960]  He wants to come in against guns.
[23:06.960 --> 23:10.200]  He wants to start a fight with America and have the moral authority of a bunch of dead
[23:10.200 --> 23:11.200]  people.
[23:11.200 --> 23:15.600]  You know, with the Georgia month and a half ago, we went on the state rep.
[23:15.600 --> 23:16.600]  We marched in peacefully.
[23:16.600 --> 23:17.600]  We gave a speech.
[23:17.600 --> 23:18.600]  We did a great job.
[23:18.600 --> 23:19.600]  We left.
[23:19.600 --> 23:20.600]  I thought it was the same thing.
[23:20.600 --> 23:21.600]  It was about to happen in DC.
[23:21.600 --> 23:26.720]  We were going to go in the capital and I showed up 30 minutes into it and there was no cops
[23:26.720 --> 23:27.720]  anywhere.
[23:27.720 --> 23:29.440]  They stood down by the time I got there.
[23:29.440 --> 23:32.640]  So this isn't my opinion.
[23:32.640 --> 23:33.940]  We know where this is going.
[23:33.940 --> 23:40.760]  We know why Q attacked me early on because Q figured out I would figure out what it was.
[23:40.760 --> 23:43.480]  And I know U.S. intelligence was involved in it.
[23:43.480 --> 23:48.400]  It was even started under orders by some campaign officials in the Trump out operation.
[23:48.400 --> 23:53.040]  They said, oh, let's do this so we can put out information like Jones puts out against
[23:53.040 --> 23:55.560]  Hillary and the rest of them, but so nobody gets sued.
[23:55.560 --> 24:00.440]  But it was instantly taken away in three weeks by the group that tricked the Trump campaign
[24:00.440 --> 24:02.440]  people to authorize it.
[24:02.440 --> 24:09.440]  And so to the average Q-tard, it's like there's no way not even God talks to Q like Q is God's
[24:09.440 --> 24:11.120]  daddy.
[24:11.120 --> 24:16.200]  But all it is is intelligence operas manipulating you to destroy the Republican Party, to destroy
[24:16.200 --> 24:17.200]  Trump.
[24:17.200 --> 24:19.080]  And you say, well, what's Q going to do when Trump's gone?
[24:19.080 --> 24:22.200]  Trump Q will be discredited.
[24:22.200 --> 24:24.720]  Q is one contingent, not the whole thing.
[24:24.720 --> 24:29.120]  Antifa is going to be involved in starting the civil war that destroys America.
[24:29.120 --> 24:34.320]  And it'll still be the behind the scenes group led off of the eight chans and the rest of
[24:34.320 --> 24:35.320]  it.
[24:35.320 --> 24:39.200]  When I'm in prison and Trump's in prison, they'll be still controlling the opposition
[24:39.200 --> 24:44.560]  so they can keep martial law in place by having badly coordinated idiotic terror attacks run
[24:44.560 --> 24:50.080]  by Q-tards or that Q-tards are going to take the blame for.
[24:50.080 --> 24:56.240]  This is augmented reality where they take like the Pokemon game where you Pokemon go
[24:56.240 --> 24:59.320]  where you go out and people would go in your garage or go in your house.
[24:59.320 --> 25:04.000]  They could put somebody's house as a psychological test and people would go to that house and
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.600]  then they'd say, as Robert Barnes said, oh, I see beams of the house look like an arrow.
[25:08.600 --> 25:10.480]  The treasure must be hidden up in the top of that.
[25:10.480 --> 25:12.600]  They tear people's houses apart.
[25:12.600 --> 25:16.400]  It's the same thing because it's not just virtual reality, it's virtual reality over
[25:16.400 --> 25:20.480]  reality and your brain gets tricked and thinks it's real.
[25:20.480 --> 25:23.920]  I told you so much about Q. I told you Trump was going to lose by fraud.
[25:23.920 --> 25:29.480]  I told you, do I have to be right again when the country's on fire next week because even
[25:29.480 --> 25:33.480]  if the Q people don't show up, Biden's going to probably detonate those pipe bombs, those
[25:33.480 --> 25:34.480]  car bombs.
[25:34.480 --> 25:36.480]  They did a dry run last week.
[25:36.480 --> 25:39.520]  The Capitol wasn't totally rushed, didn't go the way they wanted, so they didn't detonate
[25:39.520 --> 25:43.360]  the pipe bombs that were found.
[25:43.360 --> 25:44.760]  So that's what's happening.
[25:44.760 --> 25:47.080]  They're trying to use mob psychology to control you.
[25:47.080 --> 25:50.880]  We have Joel Skalsen joining us to talk about this.
[25:50.880 --> 25:52.880]  Ali Alexander, who they claim is in hiding.
[25:52.880 --> 25:54.520]  No, they've banned him everywhere.
[25:54.520 --> 25:57.640]  He's unpersoned, so he can't speak for himself.
[25:57.640 --> 25:59.600]  Patrick Byrne's going to be joining us.
[25:59.600 --> 26:02.960]  He's got a peaceful solution to all this and so much more, and we've got what President
[26:02.960 --> 26:06.800]  Trump says about all this in a little speech he gave before he flew to Texas and more.
[26:06.800 --> 26:11.920]  But the big news is, Giuliani believes and has been told that he, Don Jr. and the President,
[26:11.920 --> 26:18.280]  have been indicted for incitement by the District of Columbia last night, and that it'll be
[26:18.280 --> 26:22.600]  announced this afternoon.
[26:22.600 --> 26:28.760]  Because they are conveniently on their way to the great state of Texas, and just south
[26:28.760 --> 26:29.760]  of where I sit.
[26:29.760 --> 26:37.640]  We have reporters on the ground in Alamo City, a suburb of McAllen, right on the border with
[26:37.640 --> 26:38.640]  Brownsville.
[26:38.640 --> 26:43.320]  All right, folks, we'll be right back on the other side.
[26:43.320 --> 26:50.400]  Stay with us, tell everybody to tune in now, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today, infowars.com.
[26:50.400 --> 26:53.200]  It's true, always faithful.
[26:53.200 --> 27:01.720]  It's not a secret why in the leftist controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S.,
[27:01.720 --> 27:05.640]  they encourage people to live in tents, cities as homeless, and to use drugs and alcohol
[27:05.640 --> 27:07.120]  and engage in petty crime.
[27:07.120 --> 27:12.520]  It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course the Great Reset,
[27:12.520 --> 27:14.000]  they want to lower expectations.
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere, they don't want you to
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.560]  think of a civilization that gets better, they want you to think of a civilization
[27:21.560 --> 27:23.880]  that gets progressively worse.
[27:23.880 --> 27:28.320]  The globalists fly around in private jets, they have huge private mistakes, they are
[27:28.320 --> 27:32.880]  separate from us, their children go to private tutors, they admit this, and now they want
[27:32.880 --> 27:38.520]  us locked down, telecommunicating with each other, so that we are not actually out physically
[27:38.520 --> 27:41.000]  building a pro-human infrastructure.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.520]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G is meant to control robot and autonomous cars
[27:45.520 --> 27:46.520]  and trucks.
[27:46.520 --> 27:50.520]  This is all their admitted plan, the public is finally listening because the plan is no
[27:50.520 --> 27:54.760]  longer in beta, it's gone operational, it's a post-human future, you better find out about
[27:54.760 --> 27:57.640]  it right now.
[27:57.640 --> 28:02.400]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products and
[28:02.400 --> 28:06.600]  floors are no longer available, and I thought that pollen block might be gone forever, but
[28:06.600 --> 28:12.880]  after 8 months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us, the rest they hope
[28:12.880 --> 28:14.400]  in a few months comes in.

[29:40.680 --> 29:45.840]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.

[29:59.520 --> 30:25.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:25.080 --> 30:37.520]  That's what we're witnessing, welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host, and I want to
[30:37.520 --> 30:43.520]  be a thousand percent, a trillion percent clear, an infinity clear, just because people got
[30:43.520 --> 30:47.560]  into a cube movement and exposed government pedophile rings, the private Federal Reserve
[30:47.560 --> 30:52.840]  or GG ping, and the New World Order or animal and human hybrids, all that's real.
[30:52.840 --> 30:57.960]  That was a liberty movement that already existed, but as our movement to expose global government
[30:57.960 --> 31:04.240]  and expose the power structure hit phenomenal levels, they had to have something where there's
[31:04.240 --> 31:07.520]  a priest class again, because if you don't believe in mainstream media, you don't believe
[31:07.520 --> 31:11.320]  in government, you don't believe in the main church, which you shouldn't, well now there's
[31:11.320 --> 31:16.360]  a Q priest that has secret intelligence that tells you about the New World Order.
[31:16.360 --> 31:19.680]  People come up to me and they go, Q exposed Jeffrey Epstein, I'm like Q came around two
[31:19.680 --> 31:22.600]  and a half years ago, I exposed it 15 years ago.
[31:22.600 --> 31:27.680]  It's not about, oh I'm in competition with it, I see where you pledge allegiance to it,
[31:27.680 --> 31:33.160]  you do all this, and then I see the highly suggestible Q followers, who are the ones
[31:33.160 --> 31:37.160]  with the zip ties and going and thinking the mass arrests and the storm is here, and it's
[31:37.160 --> 31:41.560]  all about to happen, ruining our big, giant, beautiful event of a million people saying
[31:41.560 --> 31:46.080]  we don't buy election fraud, and Joe Biden can't fill the back of somebody's parking
[31:46.080 --> 31:49.760]  lot with 50 people, but we've got a million.
[31:49.760 --> 31:53.840]  And then Trump's declared an emergency, and Trump says don't be violent, and then I see
[31:53.840 --> 32:00.360]  the storm is here, we're all going to take over, we're going to get the globalist.
[32:00.360 --> 32:06.440]  And so it's a very complex issue, but we know Antifa's communists, we know they're globalists,
[32:06.440 --> 32:10.440]  we know they triggered the capital, and then manipulated not just Q people, but regular
[32:10.440 --> 32:15.880]  well-meaning red-blooded Trump supporters, only a few hundred maximum, and most of them
[32:15.880 --> 32:23.080]  came in and walked between the lines with the, there's your riot, with the velvet, purple,
[32:23.080 --> 32:28.000]  deep red, red carpet dividers.
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.000]  Can we pull that footage up of the supposed riot, the media doesn't want you to see what
[32:32.000 --> 32:37.160]  C-SPAN had a shot of, and it's just a hundred people or so, do-do-do, walking under the
[32:37.160 --> 32:46.080]  rotunda, and there you've got the red-purple ropes, we showed it on the earlier show today,
[32:46.080 --> 32:50.440]  we can find that'll be great, but I mean, that's what went on, and then four people
[32:50.440 --> 32:56.240]  get killed, and later a cop dies from a heart attack, and that's the end of the world, and
[32:56.240 --> 33:00.200]  no fly list for anybody that went to D.C., and Trump should be arrested, and Pence should
[33:00.200 --> 33:07.040]  be arrested, and Giuliani and Alex Jones and everybody else, it's crazy.
[33:07.040 --> 33:11.880]  And then they had, if you can't find it, ask Matt, he knows where it is, and then you
[33:11.880 --> 33:16.240]  are at it in post, because I know we're live right now, but I've got to have that shot.
[33:16.240 --> 33:19.680]  We should be looping that shot, those shots, there it is, but there's not just that one,
[33:19.680 --> 33:24.560]  there's shots from like up at the top of the rotunda that just shows them all orderly,
[33:24.560 --> 33:34.640]  not even leaving it, not even leaving the guide rails.
[33:34.640 --> 33:41.400]  So that's where we are, and that's what we're dealing with as a society and as a culture,
[33:41.400 --> 33:49.120]  and there have been, when I say hundreds, it's more than that, publications, including
[33:49.120 --> 33:53.080]  the Wall Street Journal that had to retract and others have saying, Jones led the attack,
[33:53.080 --> 33:57.600]  he said attack, storm it, get them, get them, meanwhile I was there saying stop, and got
[33:57.600 --> 34:02.360]  most people to turn back and not go in, who thought it was like an open tour or something,
[34:02.360 --> 34:05.880]  they didn't even know what was going on, the larger crowds that showed up later, I showed
[34:05.880 --> 34:09.360]  up 30 minutes into it, they didn't even know what was going on, until I saw flashbangs
[34:09.360 --> 34:11.600]  and tear gas.
[34:11.600 --> 34:15.480]  So imagine how deceptive this corporate media is, there it is, look at that footage, NBC
[34:15.480 --> 34:22.200]  News, this is the new Pearl Harbor, Chuck Schumer said this was as bad as the 3,100
[34:22.200 --> 34:30.200]  dead at Pearl Harbor, December 7th, 1941, a day of aluminum, this is thousands of Japanese
[34:30.200 --> 34:36.400]  zero attack aircraft with torpedoes and bombs sinking more than 20 battleships and other
[34:36.400 --> 34:43.440]  ships, look at it, that, if you're a TV viewer, of course a radio listener, I'm being sarcastic,
[34:43.440 --> 34:49.240]  back that up, it's literally the grand rotunda with like 30 people wandering around taking
[34:49.240 --> 34:54.760]  selfies and then one guy, he's a revolutionary, he kicks over one of the stands, one of the
[34:54.760 --> 34:57.760]  brass stands.
[34:57.760 --> 35:01.600]  I see more rowdy nights on a Friday night, back in the old days, we had an open free
[35:01.600 --> 35:11.320]  society when high school kids were screwing around at the movie theater, hell, one time
[35:11.320 --> 35:14.600]  they caught some of my friends sneaking in their friends to the back movie theater door,
[35:14.600 --> 35:19.080]  remember that, you didn't have money for movie, your buddies would let you in, I knew some
[35:19.080 --> 35:23.160]  guys tied their truck chains to one of the doors of the movie theater and pulled the
[35:23.160 --> 35:27.720]  door off, God, that was worse than Pearl Harbor too, I didn't do it.
[35:27.720 --> 35:35.120]  I was drinking a slits malt liquor at about 14 years old and watched them do it though,
[35:35.120 --> 35:39.960]  but that was Dallas, see that was worse than Pearl Harbor, that was worse than Alderaan
[35:39.960 --> 35:48.880]  being blown up by Darth Vader in episode four Star Wars, I mean, I saw people tie chains
[35:48.880 --> 35:53.320]  to a movie theater back door and pull it off its engines.
[35:53.320 --> 35:59.720]  So if walking off the Pelosi's lectern or sitting in her office is Pearl Harbor, well
[35:59.720 --> 36:08.360]  then pulling a door off a movie theater is all of World War II, all of World War I, all
[36:08.360 --> 36:14.200]  of Nazi Germany, all of Mao Zedong, all death that ever happened on earth from now back
[36:14.200 --> 36:22.040]  to the beginning of time, this was the ultimate assault in history, free speech must end,
[36:22.040 --> 36:25.080]  you must have no fly list for Christians, that's where this is all going, we must have
[36:25.080 --> 36:29.840]  force inoculations, all these folks are dying from it because the police opened the gates
[36:29.840 --> 36:35.440]  up and waved people into the Capitol, man I tell you on purpose they didn't coordinate,
[36:35.440 --> 36:38.400]  they knew Trump was going to call for this rally, they knew Trump was calling for a march
[36:38.400 --> 36:43.040]  days before, Trump just thought they'd have Capitol Police, instead hundreds of thousands
[36:43.040 --> 36:48.560]  march, I'm there, Antifa attacks, patriots kicked their ass so these weird paramilitary
[36:48.560 --> 36:54.720]  groups in Camo, these are big guys, it's military, they went in and attacked, opened the breach,
[36:54.720 --> 37:00.840]  the cops stand down and boom, it's over, so yeah all that cute military intelligence,
[37:00.840 --> 37:04.120]  like that one general, it's not Flynn, it's the other one, he's like 80 years old, he
[37:04.120 --> 37:07.920]  was in a video this weekend, I forget his name, he's like, army intelligence broke
[37:07.920 --> 37:12.720]  in to get the thing, they needed the attack as the cover to get the laptop, now you steal
[37:12.720 --> 37:17.880]  a laptop, you do it digitally, everybody's like, oh special forces did it, yeah and
[37:17.880 --> 37:25.880]  special forces says, raid all the other capitals this Saturday and Sunday, no don't do that
[37:25.880 --> 37:30.040]  because some 80 year old general who can't even find his ass when both hands tells you
[37:30.040 --> 37:36.240]  to, oh army intelligence, there's this intelligence group out of Arizona, it was defunded 15 years
[37:36.240 --> 37:40.360]  ago, it doesn't exist, I looked it up, any moron, this particular intelligence group
[37:40.360 --> 37:48.920]  is running around, it's called the Kraken, they said the Kraken's about to be released,
[37:48.920 --> 37:53.960]  meanwhile I'm on air like, well let me get army special operations commander on the liner,
[37:53.960 --> 37:57.360]  let me get Roger Stone on the liner, let me get Giuliani on the liner, and they're like
[37:57.360 --> 38:03.120]  oh we don't want them, they don't know anything, it's not about like, oh I'm interfering with
[38:03.120 --> 38:09.040]  your Q-Power, I've been around 27 years, I am who I am, my family's on the Mayflower,
[38:09.040 --> 38:12.880]  I raised, my family raised Colonel Travis' son, my family was in the most elite army
[38:12.880 --> 38:16.560]  special units there are, CIA, everything else, and they told me the government's corrupt
[38:16.560 --> 38:20.480]  and evil and I should fight it, I did all this myself as supporters, and I sit here
[38:20.480 --> 38:26.200]  and watch a bunch of delusional lunatics sit there and believe that you're fighting the
[38:26.200 --> 38:31.160]  new world order when you have rolled the gravy train in for martial law and national gun
[38:31.160 --> 38:36.200]  confiscation, and then you're gonna get the Civil War you're looking for, but it looked
[38:36.200 --> 38:40.680]  to me like the few Q-Tards and once you got into the capitol there was your zip ties, nobody
[38:40.680 --> 38:45.720]  was there because it was a set up, it was a larping, it was a drill, their speeches
[38:45.720 --> 38:53.040]  were already written, it was prepared, so news flash, next time you launch a violent
[38:53.040 --> 39:00.960]  revolution make sure it isn't run by your enemy, laughing at you, meanwhile all over
[39:00.960 --> 39:09.640]  the United States, antifuzz, marching to the streets, beating people, police running
[39:09.640 --> 39:17.120]  fear, and they announced they rule America, they rule, they rule, they rule, they rule,
[39:17.120 --> 39:22.800]  they rule, they rule, so let's not walk into their trap this weekend coming up, let's
[39:22.800 --> 39:26.720]  document it, let's expose it, and let's get the word out now, they want us off the
[39:26.720 --> 39:31.680]  air so the truth doesn't get out, when we come back, Trump's statement before he flew
[39:31.680 --> 39:35.320]  to Texas, the latest in Texas, reporters on the ground in Alamo, Texas, not the Alamo
[39:35.320 --> 39:38.800]  in San Antonio folks, told people it was already crowded Alamo in San Antonio, notice the Alamo
[39:38.800 --> 39:43.240]  is a little suburb of McAllen, on the Texas border in South Texas, and we've got so much
[39:43.240 --> 39:48.600]  more and PBS's director calling for Moloff cocktails at the White House, and more on
[39:48.600 --> 39:55.120]  the other side, this is The Resistance.
[39:55.120 --> 39:58.000]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm gonna tell you all now, if
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.120]  you haven't tried Turboforce, you need to try it, I've tried Turboforce with everything,
[40:03.120 --> 40:06.680]  sometimes you know I went a little bit crazy, I put Turboforce in my coffee, that was a
[40:06.680 --> 40:10.520]  crazy week, I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, Turboforce is my
[40:10.520 --> 40:14.200]  favorite and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking
[40:14.200 --> 40:19.960]  control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you, nobody wakes up in
[40:19.960 --> 40:24.440]  the morning and thinks I'm gonna give that person over there a better life, I'm gonna
[40:24.440 --> 40:28.280]  wake up today, you know what, I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over
[40:28.280 --> 40:32.040]  there healthier, happier, and richer, I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend,
[40:32.040 --> 40:35.040]  I don't think that happens very often, it's never happened to me, I've never had anyone
[40:35.040 --> 40:38.400]  knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy, how can I improve your life in
[40:38.400 --> 40:41.560]  every single way, there's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was
[40:41.560 --> 40:45.280]  me, I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I wanna take control of my life, I wanna take
[40:45.280 --> 40:48.080]  control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com, take control of your
[40:48.080 --> 40:51.480]  health right now and support The Resistance, don't buy into the group thing, don't drink
[40:51.480 --> 40:55.880]  the Kool-Aid, drink the Turbo Force, Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[40:55.880 --> 41:03.760]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden, and now that all the
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.240]  lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[41:08.240 --> 41:15.360]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing, they will do whatever they are told as if
[41:15.360 --> 41:23.080]  obedience is a virtue, it is the Patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[41:23.080 --> 41:29.800]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[41:29.800 --> 41:36.000]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance
[41:36.000 --> 41:42.440]  to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose
[41:42.440 --> 41:49.440]  of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can, so help
[41:49.440 --> 41:56.440]  me God.
[41:56.440 --> 42:01.720]  Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best seller overnight, because activated charcoal
[42:01.720 --> 42:05.240]  is already one of the top selling fastest growing toothpaste out there.
[42:05.240 --> 42:09.560]  The problem is a lot of the other over the counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring
[42:09.560 --> 42:13.960]  very very toxic, and also they have fluoride in it, this does not have a fluoride, it doesn't
[42:13.960 --> 42:18.240]  have the additives, this is a concentrated, it really is, high quality, it's been sold
[42:18.240 --> 42:22.960]  out for months, because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage,
[42:22.960 --> 42:29.120]  but now it's back in stock, Info Wars, Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal toothpaste,

[42:43.480 --> 42:48.920]  Activated charcoal from Dr. Jones Naturals, available again at infowarsstore.com, and a
[42:48.920 --> 42:52.480]  lot of other products that have been sold out have just now come back in as well, like
[42:52.480 --> 43:18.480]  a pollen block, so check that out when you're in the store.
[43:18.480 --> 43:27.800]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it, but Storops and Bill Gates
[43:27.800 --> 43:36.680]  and the globalists are on our tail, but the new website is theresistance.video, theresistance.video,
[43:36.680 --> 43:41.480]  they're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them, so the new
[43:41.480 --> 43:46.320]  URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[43:46.320 --> 43:51.320]  and all of our special reports and all of our special information is at theresistance.video,
[43:51.320 --> 43:58.960]  share the link, theresistance.video, theresistance.video.
[43:58.960 --> 44:23.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:23.920 --> 44:35.360]  The
[44:35.360 --> 44:44.280]  sun no longer sets the satanus free, those of us that love God, we love the night as
[44:44.280 --> 44:51.160]  well as the day because we don't fear, in fact, the light is even brighter in the dark.
[44:51.160 --> 44:52.800]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[44:52.800 --> 44:58.760]  We've got a lot of big guests coming up today, Patrick Byrne, inside baseball with the president,
[44:58.760 --> 45:03.360]  Ali Alexander, Per Skiu, they claim he's running ahead, know that he platformed him everywhere,
[45:03.360 --> 45:06.760]  no social media, no communication, no banking, no nothing.
[45:06.760 --> 45:10.920]  Girl Scousen, and then I'll continue with your calls in the fourth hour with Trump's
[45:10.920 --> 45:15.920]  speech, but he's always about 15, 20 minutes late from Alamo, Texas, South Texas.
[45:15.920 --> 45:22.800]  But I want to be clear here, there's a lot of people working in this office that got
[45:22.800 --> 45:27.840]  into Q because 99% of it's reasonable and real and it's covering things that are already
[45:27.840 --> 45:31.680]  well known.
[45:31.680 --> 45:36.040]  And so they're going to try to persecute two followers after this insurrection they're
[45:36.040 --> 45:41.720]  trying to stage, but they'll then blame on Q and the proud boys.
[45:41.720 --> 45:45.240]  And I'm very close to revealing information, I just want to be 100% accurate when I do
[45:45.240 --> 45:46.240]  it.
[45:46.240 --> 45:54.600]  I'm about 95% right now that a major patriot group was infiltrated ahead of this event.
[45:54.600 --> 46:01.640]  Their leader was arrested so that a globalist fed could be put in charge of it so they could
[46:01.640 --> 46:05.360]  also be part of it.
[46:05.360 --> 46:11.720]  I know the FBI knows it because they were in command of it, and no matter what happens
[46:11.720 --> 46:15.720]  to me that information is already ready to come out, it's in certain national talk show
[46:15.720 --> 46:20.280]  host and others hands.
[46:20.280 --> 46:25.080]  So they're taking over every group, they're commandeering it, and they tried to manipulate
[46:25.080 --> 46:26.080]  me.
[46:26.080 --> 46:34.760]  I have a question of the president, and it looks like he was set up and I was set up,
[46:34.760 --> 46:38.760]  he was approached, he's already answered one part of it, I have to get another question
[46:38.760 --> 46:44.680]  answered, where they said, hey, we want Alex Jones to lead the march from here to the capital.
[46:44.680 --> 46:46.680]  And Trump thought it would be like 50,000, he had no idea.
[46:46.680 --> 46:51.560]  He goes, yeah, we need somebody to do that, have a secret service helping, because at
[46:51.560 --> 46:55.360]  first once I saw that last Wednesday I thought that I could set up, did Trump really say
[46:55.360 --> 46:56.360]  that?
[46:56.360 --> 47:01.800]  And the word is Trump did say I want Jones and others to lead this.
[47:01.800 --> 47:04.520]  You saw Trump say on the stand, I was not going to lead it, I'm sitting there, I've
[47:04.520 --> 47:07.800]  had a bad feeling, and then Trump goes, and by the way, after this we're going to march
[47:07.800 --> 47:11.080]  down there peacefully, you know, they've edited all that out of what he said, but he said
[47:11.080 --> 47:14.320]  that, and we're going to show them peacefully the will of the people that we don't buy this
[47:14.320 --> 47:19.360]  fraud and our numbers, and as soon as a secret service came and waved us over and opened
[47:19.360 --> 47:25.200]  up the gate, I went out, told my wife, stay back here, I had a bad feeling, I said this
[47:25.200 --> 47:29.800]  may not be safe, I had a bad feeling, and of course the secret service guys that waved
[47:29.800 --> 47:34.040]  us over, they weren't part of this, they're compartmentalized, but the capital bleaches
[47:34.040 --> 47:39.200]  are down, but I finally got my cell to work once I'd gotten out of the crowd, because
[47:39.200 --> 47:42.320]  they had like some bubble, wasn't just everybody using cell phones, they had something to cut
[47:42.320 --> 47:48.120]  off cell phones, the Trump speech, they meant they had that, and I called Roger, he wouldn't
[47:48.120 --> 47:53.560]  answer, so I talked to one of his, they go, no, he's not going, he has a bad feeling,
[47:53.560 --> 47:57.160]  and he's told that whole story, and then he had a really bad feeling and let's it like
[47:57.160 --> 48:02.520]  four, at 430, they swat team his hotel room, and I learned they came to my hotel room too,
[48:02.520 --> 48:07.680]  and came in, I was over at the OEN studios, where they're at, I rented it from the building
[48:07.680 --> 48:12.120]  to be on top, so I didn't know, but the next day, like I said, a hundred police cars showed
[48:12.120 --> 48:17.600]  up for me, and they said, you're leaving now or you're arrested, and I'm with DC senior
[48:17.600 --> 48:21.360]  cops that are off duty that we hired, they're like, listen, I never seen anything like this,
[48:21.360 --> 48:26.600]  they're saying, they already, they did a 1033, I forget what they said, it's like a 10 something,
[48:26.600 --> 48:30.480]  means officer down, they said, Jones has shot an officer, they said, we never seen anything
[48:30.480 --> 48:33.320]  like this, the cops like, we know you didn't do it, we're being ordered to arrest you,
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.880]  you gotta go now, I mean, I had the cops like, to my cops, I was with like these cops are
[48:37.880 --> 48:41.480]  all around, and they're like, you gotta go, people go, where's the video, think I'm pulling
[48:41.480 --> 48:46.040]  cameras out when there's a hundred police cars around the building, and they're saying,
[48:46.040 --> 48:50.480]  we got a 10 whatever, officer down saying, you shot a cop, they go, we know Mr. Jones,
[48:50.480 --> 48:55.240]  you didn't do it, go now, go, go, so I go to the hotel a mile away, we got our bags,
[48:55.240 --> 49:04.320]  there's like 20 police cars around us. So they wanted, we're told, Trump wants you and
[49:04.320 --> 49:09.360]  Roger to lead the, the, the, the, and I'm like, God, that sounds crazy. I'm like, Roger,
[49:09.360 --> 49:12.240]  get a call, he goes, I'm not going to waste my time when I talk to Trump, ask about some
[49:12.240 --> 49:17.200]  March, blah, blah, blah, but I guess I'll, you know, so I'm telling you folks, this is
[49:17.200 --> 49:24.760]  a movie, man, just like they, they manipulated me to go lead a march. There was a setup,
[49:24.760 --> 49:34.080]  they're manipulating you through Q, so I'm not judging you, I fell for it as well. This
[49:34.080 --> 49:46.520]  is psychologist and psychiatrist doing Milgram level experiments, 2.0 Stanford prison experiments.
[49:46.520 --> 49:53.840]  Coming up in the 30 minutes before Patrick Byrne joins us, I'm going to play the bombing
[49:53.840 --> 49:57.160]  of the Capitol in 1983, the media said it was good by communist, the woman that found
[49:57.160 --> 50:03.280]  a black lives matter. She bombed it. She's a good person, the media says, I'm going to
[50:03.280 --> 50:11.280]  play you PBS principal counsel, Michael Beller incites pipe, a Molotov cocktails at the White
[50:11.280 --> 50:17.760]  House. That's all loving and good. That's all breaking. And I'm going to show you what
[50:17.760 --> 50:23.800]  the president had to say before he flew off to Texas is now here. In fact, speaking of
[50:23.800 --> 50:30.040]  that, let's just play what the president just had to say about the situation about censorship
[50:30.040 --> 50:46.880]  and about peace here at us. So again, this is the club I was given. Can we find a better
[50:46.880 --> 50:52.200]  club? Let's just stop. I'm sure we can find a better club of that. I knew, I read the
[50:52.200 --> 50:56.040]  transcript. He said, I hadn't seen that. I heard that audio. That is abysmal. Let's
[50:56.040 --> 51:03.200]  see me get a better copy of that. Thank you. So that's coming up. But he says the center
[51:03.200 --> 51:07.120]  ship's abysmal. Let's all be peaceful. It's not Trump's fault. What happened out there
[51:07.120 --> 51:12.480]  by any stress imagination under this yardstick? If there's a riot in an NFL football game
[51:12.480 --> 51:16.800]  where they've had dozens killed in stampede or hundreds of cars burned, is the Dallas
[51:16.800 --> 51:22.640]  Cowboys bad? The Lakers that won championships and six, seven people get killed and does
[51:22.640 --> 51:28.840]  as the cars get burned and shops get looted. Does the Lakers go to jail? It's unbelievable,
[51:28.840 --> 51:32.280]  ladies and gentlemen. It's absolutely unbelievable. We're going to go to break, come back and break
[51:32.280 --> 51:38.280]  all this down in the second, third and fourth hour today. And I cannot impress upon you
[51:38.280 --> 51:42.560]  that they're censoring everybody else. Nobody else built systems like ours be redundant.
[51:42.560 --> 51:46.880]  They still may be able to shut us down. So while you still can go to band on video, download
[51:46.880 --> 51:52.560]  every video you can and save it, share the articles, share the reports, pray for us and
[51:52.560 --> 51:57.480]  also financially support us because if they take our credit card merchant stuff away,
[51:57.480 --> 52:00.240]  they're not trying to take the merchant accounts. They're trying to take credit card service
[52:00.240 --> 52:03.360]  away. They've done to a bunch of people that have to Trump. Trump lost his bank accounts
[52:03.360 --> 52:09.840]  today. Private and public. His company and his private. This is total Nazi Germany.
[52:09.840 --> 52:14.320]  So I need as much capital as I can get an info store.com. Plus you need swarble foods
[52:14.320 --> 52:17.520]  with the highest quality relationship. You need the supplements, the pollen block, the
[52:17.520 --> 52:23.600]  X2, the X3, the DNA force plus the super male mortality back in stock, the living defense
[52:23.600 --> 52:27.080]  that's so good for your guts and so good for your body, flush everything out and make you
[52:27.080 --> 52:31.800]  so healthy next level beyond probiotic living defense and bodies, open tumor formula and
[52:31.800 --> 52:37.000]  our liquid tumor formula. It's just as good, maybe even better in ways. That's discounted
[52:37.000 --> 52:41.560]  info war store.com. But it's that capital. It's all up to God. I'm not worried about
[52:41.560 --> 52:45.600]  it. However much money comes in, no matter what happens, we'll stay on air till they
[52:45.600 --> 52:50.000]  cut the lights out and it's up to all of you after that. So we'll just stay faithful. It's
[52:50.000 --> 52:54.400]  kind of like in the 1980s movie, the thing and he thought he killed it. He knows one
[52:54.400 --> 52:58.800]  still alive and the whole camp's burning. It'll be 30 below zero, 50 below zero in
[52:58.800 --> 53:02.480]  an hour. He says, let's just sit here awhile and see what happens. I mean, I'm kind of
[53:02.480 --> 53:06.120]  in the camp. It's on fire. It's really warm right now actually, but it's going to get
[53:06.120 --> 53:09.640]  real cold and that's okay. They're going to be left alone with the contact tracers
[53:09.640 --> 53:13.160]  coming to your house, bagging your parents, bagging your kids, dragging you out. You're
[53:13.160 --> 53:16.360]  like, why do they do it? Because they want tyranny. They have a hunger to rape you, a
[53:16.360 --> 53:20.560]  hunger to put you in a camp, a hunger to inject you, a hunger to hurt you. That's what psychos
[53:20.560 --> 53:26.640]  are about. And tyranny is organized psychos taking control for mass feeding. Low level
[53:26.640 --> 53:30.720]  psychos kill a few women, a few children get caught. The high functioning ones, they do
[53:30.720 --> 53:35.400]  it on a mass scale. And so everything is setting the table, preparing the meal. They've got
[53:35.400 --> 53:41.280]  it all ready and they're just now ringing the dinner bell to kill 50, 100 million Americans
[53:41.280 --> 53:46.120]  like Larry Grathwald caught the weathermen that run this whole thing saying we're going
[53:46.120 --> 53:50.720]  to put 50 million in camps killed 25 million Americans. There were 200 million Americans
[53:50.720 --> 53:56.080]  when they planned to kill 25 million. So you understand the journey is the destination.
[53:56.080 --> 54:00.560]  They want to rape you in a death camp. They want to inoculate you and watch you have a
[54:00.560 --> 54:05.960]  convulsion. They want to kill you. They love hurting you. They're coming. They're coming.
[54:05.960 --> 54:10.120]  They're coming. There's nothing you can do except face reality. Facing reality is how
[54:10.120 --> 54:16.200]  we beat them. We have cancer. We have a satanic cancer. Hitler was just a beta test. You are
[54:16.200 --> 54:20.480]  under attack. They're never going to stop. They are driven by an energy. Look at them.
[54:20.480 --> 54:24.960]  They're race. Look at Schumer. Look at Pelosi. They're dead humans. They're globalist. These
[54:24.960 --> 54:30.760]  are race. These are not human. They're coming. They need your brains. They need your soul.
[54:30.760 --> 54:34.160]  They don't have it. They want to destroy you. They want to bring you down. They want to
[54:34.160 --> 54:38.800]  annihilate you. They love Chinese death camps. Apple loves it. They all love it. They're
[54:38.800 --> 54:45.720]  all turned over to evil. They're under Satan's control.
[54:45.720 --> 54:50.520]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado. Thank you for holding. How you doing Alex? Man, I'm just
[54:50.520 --> 54:53.680]  working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time. Brother, how are you? I love
[54:53.680 --> 54:59.080]  you, man. I want to make a quick plug. That DNA force. I love it. I've been using it
[54:59.080 --> 55:03.720]  quite a while and I just went, looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see that
[55:03.720 --> 55:11.280]  it contains Corsican, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkala has cited
[55:11.280 --> 55:17.960]  is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells.
[55:17.960 --> 55:23.920]  So people might want to take a look at that. All I know is with DNA force, we went out
[55:23.920 --> 55:28.560]  and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't
[55:28.560 --> 55:32.240]  prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive
[55:32.240 --> 55:36.160]  product in them. It's really only cost them like 50 bucks. And so we basically cloned
[55:36.160 --> 55:40.320]  two different top brands together and that's what produced this. So thanks. Thanks for the
[55:40.320 --> 55:50.320]  plug.
[55:50.320 --> 56:18.320]  Thanks for the plug.
[56:18.320 --> 56:45.360]  Thank you.
[56:49.320 --> 57:05.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:05.200 --> 57:09.280]  Dramatic images at the U.S. Capitol building were just today. It was the scene of one of
[57:09.280 --> 57:13.320]  the darkest days in American history, a failed insurrection.
[57:13.320 --> 57:19.560]  What happened here today was an insurrection. Let me be very clear. The scenes of chaos
[57:19.560 --> 57:28.000]  at the Capitol do not reflect a true America. It's not protest. It's insurrection.
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.920]  As everyone knows by now, today was a day filled with surreal and horrifying scenes of armed
[57:32.920 --> 57:33.920]  insurrection.
[57:33.920 --> 57:39.520]  They are selling the illusion of insurrection. The Democrats and their corporate overlords
[57:39.520 --> 57:45.440]  have already begun their blitzkrieg of tyranny, twisting the occupation of our nation's capital
[57:45.440 --> 57:50.120]  by frustrated citizens into a call for totalitarianism.
[57:50.120 --> 57:55.080]  Well, I'm glad to see that the political marketplace is working out there with organizations,
[57:55.080 --> 58:01.080]  companies, individuals saying we're simply not giving any more contributions to those
[58:01.080 --> 58:07.040]  who held up the election or tried to hold up or overturn the election. So that certainly
[58:07.040 --> 58:25.040]  has to happen.
[58:25.040 --> 58:31.560]  As D.C. Mayor Bowser lords over her potential future state with a 15-day emergency order
[58:31.560 --> 58:34.120]  following the Capitol building siege.
[58:34.120 --> 58:41.040]  Now of course, we are all focused on preparing for the upcoming presidential inauguration.
[58:41.040 --> 58:49.960]  Our goals right now are to encourage Americans to participate virtually and to protect the
[58:49.960 --> 58:55.920]  District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol
[58:55.920 --> 58:58.920]  and its grounds on January the 6th.
[58:58.920 --> 59:04.800]  I am requesting the Secretary of the Department of the Interior cancel any and all public
[59:04.800 --> 59:11.280]  gathering permits in the District of Columbia and deny any applications for public gathering
[59:11.280 --> 59:15.920]  during the period January 11 through January 24.
[59:15.920 --> 59:21.200]  The National Guard, including 1,000 soldiers from New York, are stationed in the nation's
[59:21.200 --> 59:27.640]  capital to protect the illegitimate inauguration of the Manchurian candidate, Joe Biden.
[59:27.640 --> 59:33.360]  1,000 Virginia National Guardsmen remain in D.C. tonight to help with security operations.
[59:33.360 --> 59:36.920]  About 1,000 more are expected to join them in the coming days.
[59:36.920 --> 59:40.360]  Personnel originally responded to the U.S. Capitol building Wednesday when pro-Trump
[59:40.360 --> 59:45.160]  rioters invaded. They will assist in protecting property and providing a safe environment for
[59:45.160 --> 59:49.960]  any peaceful protests. They'll be on duty through President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration
[59:49.960 --> 59:55.520]  on January 20. They joined a planned 6,200 National Guard soldiers and airmen from neighboring
[59:55.520 --> 59:58.520]  states, including Maryland, New York, and New Jersey.
[59:58.520 --> 1:00:03.160]  While the old establishment propaganda ratchets into full protection mode.
[1:00:03.160 --> 1:00:10.960]  I grew up in Austria and very aware of Kristallnacht, or the night of broken glass. It was a night
[1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:13.520]  of rampage against the Jews carried out in 1938.
[1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:15.120]  And my father was involved.
[1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:16.120]  The Nazi equivalent.
[1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:19.120]  And now I work for George Soros to kill you. I love Hitler.
[1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:22.920]  President Trump sold over the results of an election.
[1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:25.920]  And if you make a rotten heart, roll over and die.
[1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:26.920]  Burn him hell.
[1:00:26.920 --> 1:00:29.640]  You saw the people misleading people with lies.
[1:00:29.640 --> 1:00:32.440]  My father and our neighbors were misled also with lies.
[1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:33.920]  Oh, they were the only father.
[1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:36.800]  I know you're such a nice lead.
[1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:42.280]  President Trump is a failed leader. He will go down in history as the worst president ever.
[1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:47.320]  The time for debate and name-calling is over. Will the American people accept the voice
[1:00:47.320 --> 1:00:50.000]  of truth or that of lies?
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  John Bowne reporting.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:01:01.800]  Literal son of an SS officer, the product of an SS marriage telling us that Trump's Hitler,
[1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:10.560]  when Schwarzenegger is a known gay escort who's been compromised ever since, long lines
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:15.640]  of people at the Getty Center would have gangbanks on him.
[1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:19.720]  And so that's the only reason Schwarzenegger is so controlled is the Getty Center has all
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:27.280]  those 35 millimeter films of Schwarzenegger giving blowjobs.
[1:01:27.280 --> 1:01:30.160]  So there you are, Schwarzenegger.
[1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:36.320]  And nobody's saying you're a bad guy that you've, you know, been with more men than,
[1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:37.320]  you know, most women have.
[1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:39.800]  The whole point is that's how they compromise you.
[1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:43.720]  So Schwarzenegger could suck a golf ball through a garden hose.
[1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:45.960]  And that's why he's compromised.
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:57.960]  A gay porn operative of the Getty's three, two, one, it's back in stock, it's been sold
[1:01:57.960 --> 1:01:58.960]  out for over eight months.
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:02.120]  We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock.
[1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:05.600]  Let me tell you, we'll talk about it, but the power of quail egg concentrate pollen block
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:06.600]  acts differently.
[1:02:06.600 --> 1:02:10.280]  The traditional antihistamines that was clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:13.520]  by helping to clear signage passages and eating respiratory function.
[1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:16.120]  It's amazing folks absolutely love it.
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:19.040]  And again, France has been shut down so we couldn't get it.

[1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:30.920]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back
[1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:35.040]  in because it works naturally unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that
[1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:38.760]  you make sure you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:40.320]  This is naturally occurring.
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:44.120]  It's the secret of how the quail, uh, don't have the seasonal distress and it's passed
[1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:48.920]  on somehow through their eggs to us, you chew up the pills, they taste great.

[1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:53.920]  For being about 12 years old listen to this I told this 16 year old girl that was 16 and I was lying
[1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:57.840]  I wasn't sure this is a molly good dropping around her daddy's car
[1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:02.120]  All right, let's get serious
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:13.480]  Little nostalgia there. We're in a really bad situation, but we're in a really great situation Newtonian physics every action opposite and equal reaction
[1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:19.060]  And we're here and we're at the crossroads of all of this right now
[1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:27.080]  So here's the incredible news on this live January 12th Tuesday transmission eight days to the coronation
[1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:30.840]  The inauguration of the Lord and Savior
[1:04:32.280 --> 1:04:35.200]  The chai-kong king pedophile
[1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:38.760]  creepy
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:40.760]  Joe Biden
[1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:48.480]  And how are they gonna sell a stolen election
[1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:54.840]  How are they gonna sell this well by triggering a ride at the Capitol that dutted because almost no one took part
[1:04:54.840 --> 1:04:57.480]  I left this mob would burn that place down
[1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:01.480]  So what are they gonna do?
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:06.240]  Well the national emergency has been declared a total emergency martial law in DC
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:09.960]  Trump's like do not come out. Do not be violent. Do not do it
[1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:14.480]  But they're gonna have their provocateurs roll out you can bet your bottom dollar
[1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:16.800]  So we need patrons on the streets with cameras
[1:05:17.600 --> 1:05:19.920]  Documenting every satanic method you see
[1:05:19.920 --> 1:05:27.120]  But also groups of well-put-together paramilitary folks or anybody online telling you you're part of a secret mission. That's the globalist
[1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:29.800]  Do not
[1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:31.320]  Be part of it anyway
[1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:34.400]  Here's president Trump when he took off a few hours ago for Texas
[1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:39.320]  He's here in Texas now about to speak in Alamo, Texas not the Alamo in San Antonio
[1:05:39.640 --> 1:05:42.360]  Not the shrine not the seat of the
[1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:47.440]  Texas Revolution 1936, but the town of Alamo outside McCallan
[1:05:47.440 --> 1:05:52.600]  Texas we have crew down there will be covering it live in the fourth hour. Here's what president Trump had to say when he took off
[1:05:52.600 --> 1:05:55.160]  I think big tech has made a terrible mistake
[1:05:55.520 --> 1:06:03.440]  And very very bad for our country and that's leading others to do the same thing and it causes a lot of problems and a lot of danger
[1:06:04.480 --> 1:06:07.320]  big mistake they shouldn't be doing it, but
[1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:10.760]  There's always a counter move when they do that
[1:06:10.760 --> 1:06:15.080]  I've never seen such anger as I see right now and that's a terrible thing
[1:06:15.080 --> 1:06:17.440]  Terrible thing and you have to always
[1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:24.100]  Avoid violence and we have we have tremendous support. We have support
[1:06:24.680 --> 1:06:29.240]  Probably like nobody's ever seen before always have to avoid
[1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:42.320]  So if you read my speech and many people have done it and I've seen it both in the papers and in the media on
[1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:49.000]  On television, it's been analyzed and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:53.160]  And if you look at what other people have said politicians at a high level
[1:06:53.800 --> 1:07:00.640]  About the riots during the summer the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle and various other other places
[1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:09.720]  That was a real problem what they said, but they've analyzed my speech and my words and my final paragraph my final sentence and
[1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:15.120]  And everybody took the key thought it was totally appropriate. Okay, thank you. That's right
[1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:22.760]  Trump gave a moderate speech compared to Nancy Pelosi or Phil Mudd or Mad Maxine waters or
[1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:31.320]  Michael Moore, I mean we have hours of them saying mall off cocktail kill destroy hell. Let's play
[1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:33.920]  The latest project heritage video
[1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:41.440]  This is the principal counsel the head lawyer of the PBS Channel hundreds of millions of taxpayer money was a 600 million last time
[1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:43.440]  I checked look up what PBS can see here
[1:07:43.920 --> 1:07:45.240]  Just
[1:07:45.240 --> 1:07:48.200]  One of the places that still has a big audience. I mean there PBS is big
[1:07:48.920 --> 1:07:51.320]  There's just force fed on every TV screen in the country
[1:07:51.920 --> 1:07:56.320]  Go to the White House and throw mall off cocktails. You know what Trump said
[1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:02.480]  Go to Obama's house and throw mall off cocktails, I'd say arrest Trump
[1:08:02.480 --> 1:08:06.760]  Because I don't support that but he didn't say it this guy did here it is
[1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:19.360]  Imposed back that up because this is really bad audio project Veritas
[1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:21.080]  He goes even in Biden wins
[1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:27.040]  We go to their houses and burn them out all Republicans and take their children because obviously he wants their children
[1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:31.600]  That's the real goal here. Haha. It's like when Tim Dillon said what's the goal here? Yeah?
[1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:34.760]  I'm Joe Rogan. Well, it's the goal is not, you know, have a good time
[1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:39.840]  The goal is to screw your children or put them in a FEMA camp. So that's the real what they want those children
[1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:43.200]  God, they'll do anything to get them. Look, let's hear what this monster had to say again
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:56.960]  We go for all Republican voters burn down their house and take your children
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:03.260]  No, we put the pause we put their children in re-education camps. Will you guys pull up?
[1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:09.440]  Larry Grathwald green beret holly decorated confirmed in federal court weatherman confessed what he said
[1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:14.440]  He's in meetings with all these PhD saying 50 million in camps 25 million dead

[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:26.920]  Let's continue with project veritas
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:31.640]  Trump is close to Hitler
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:40.040]  Malof cocktails he wants your children

[1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:21.400]  Re-education camps Sesame Street, they name it. They watch PBS all day

[1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:47.960]  These people want one thing children

[1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:01.880]  Part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse if they're able to keep Trump from
[1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:07.640]  Rightfully taking office for second term Ontario 20th. The system is going to drop the hammer
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:13.520]  Harder than ever on this Republic. They are going to explode gas prices. They're going to shut down our coal power plants
[1:14:13.560 --> 1:14:20.600]  They're going to cut off the energy source to us. So it's impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic domination
[1:14:20.600 --> 1:14:26.960]  This is economic war. We are being consolidated. We're being taken over the Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states
[1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:31.560]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them
[1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:38.440]  Absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property. This is a monopolistic takeover
[1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:42.680]  That's what the great reset is cloud swab and these other criminals admit it
[1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:47.720]  That's what social distancing is so your business is only a 25% for several more years

[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:58.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:19.840]  Now the Democrat House of Majority Leader is calling for anyone that supports Trump to have their bank accounts and like to fly
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:21.840]  Take it away
[1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:30.120]  Welcome the Chinese credit score 2.0, but first the daughter of the Thunder of Al Qaeda

[1:15:55.120 --> 1:15:58.920]  Just think we need to treat your domestic terrorists the way we do actual terrorists
[1:15:58.920 --> 1:16:02.400]  I think we need to consider all all all the possibilities
[1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:07.920]  I'm not against sending these people to Gitmo and that may sound extreme. These are domestic terrorists who attacked our own republic
[1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:09.920]  They should be treated the same way we treat Al Qaeda. Oh
[1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:15.560]  Oh Al Qaeda that your father secretly funded on record and got caught funding and in the Syrian rebellion
[1:16:16.160 --> 1:16:20.920]  That is a prozac drug addict. Nobody. That's a demon that woman's already in hell
[1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:29.120]  So let's move on Democrat House Homeland Security Chair once GOP senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley on no fly list as
[1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:31.920]  Well, let's go to that
[1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:37.000]  About liability for inciting this insurrection
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:45.880]  Falling on the Navy in the laps of senator Holly and senator Cruz and a member of Congress
[1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:52.400]  They got the house Senate and presidency FaceTime or led people to Pelosi's
[1:16:55.720 --> 1:16:57.720]  Now here's a question
[1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:02.360]  All the anti was good. Oh, but now we go to jail
[1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:09.120]  Oh burning hells come back. They'd be on a no fly list. So they'd be no question about it
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:11.120]  You know, there's there's no
[1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:12.720]  exemption
[1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:14.200]  for being
[1:17:14.200 --> 1:17:19.640]  Put on the no fly list and there's no exemption if you're a baby getting a boarded in Georgia with your organs
[1:17:19.640 --> 1:17:21.760]  Oh, I remember a car or New York. It's a crime
[1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:28.040]  From the body
[1:17:28.040 --> 1:17:33.720]  There are ethics charges that can be brought against those individuals and people are looking at all this
[1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:36.600]  What what Holly did and what Cruz did?
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:43.280]  Yeah, you lay down your election fraud that's permanent like Venezuela, Colorado because we're told now you never question fraud
[1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:46.360]  It's a permanent one party state and everything was going on
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  Okay, I can't listen anymore of this crap
[1:17:49.400 --> 1:17:51.120]  shut it off
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:52.680]  So there you go
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:59.120]  I mean apples running death camps with three million people in it, but these guys are like Josh Holly deserves to be in jail
[1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:01.240]  He deserves not be able to fly
[1:18:01.280 --> 1:18:05.640]  Because you know, they were gonna have those hearings on election fraud. Don't do that
[1:18:07.080 --> 1:18:13.480]  And Megan McCain's like, oh, we're gonna make you eat dog food because then she'll have real power
[1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:15.640]  You're like a little fear filled Marshall outfit
[1:18:16.920 --> 1:18:20.760]  And we just keep putting up with it putting up with it. You're like, well, then let's get violent
[1:18:20.760 --> 1:18:26.400]  They are controlling the dumbest violent elements to make sure that it's all coordinated wrong
[1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:29.360]  You don't see Q saying
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:35.800]  Go to shut the Schumer's house or go to Obama's house or where they're at. Oh, no, no, no, no
[1:18:35.800 --> 1:18:37.800]  It's attacked the Capitol right on the right day. I
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:41.880]  Don't want to attack Schumer in those guys. My point is is that
[1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:46.360]  Santa Claus is not real and
[1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:52.920]  And their new world order and communism doesn't work either and people aren't gonna put up with it and their need to dominate
[1:18:53.400 --> 1:18:55.400]  Everyone is sick
[1:18:55.880 --> 1:19:00.780]  And I talked about this yesterday. I'll talk about it again right now. I hadn't watched there will be blood in a long time
[1:19:01.160 --> 1:19:05.200]  It's an Academy Award winning film. It's it's really well done with Daniel Day-Lewis big fan of him
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:09.320]  Last mohegan's all those movies of gangs in New York. He's an excellent actor
[1:19:09.320 --> 1:19:16.360]  It's a composite of real stuff that happened lots of petroleum and pipelines the ocean all the rest of it
[1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:20.560]  So it's not a true story, but it's a composite and he talks in the movie about I
[1:19:21.040 --> 1:19:25.640]  Have a competitive about me. I hate everyone. I don't want anyone else too. Well, see
[1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:31.760]  That's the globalists. That's how they operate. So they tell you we're liberal. We're nice
[1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:36.120]  We want to unify everybody to be good, but they're totally ruthless. I am
[1:19:36.120 --> 1:19:42.320]  I'm super alpha male dominant and I don't want to be a slave, but I want to empower everybody and
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:45.080]  so I see people doing well and
[1:19:45.840 --> 1:19:52.040]  I see people successful and I just look at all the technology and everything is a rising tide raises all the ships
[1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:58.400]  And so I see some guy with a gorgeous wife and great kids in a private jet and all this stuff if they made their money legally
[1:19:58.400 --> 1:20:00.400]  I love it. That's good for all of us
[1:20:00.840 --> 1:20:03.960]  But I've been around most men that are rich and powerful
[1:20:03.960 --> 1:20:12.560]  They're like super insecure like you'll be with some multi-billionaire person and they'll see their neighbor has a good-looking boat
[1:20:13.080 --> 1:20:16.800]  It's not even half as big as theirs, but they're like, oh, what is that?
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:23.680]  How'd you and they think they get really they're insecure. There's something along with them. It's a satanic energy
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:30.200]  Because see I can see some dude with this incredibly gorgeous wife, and I'm just like
[1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:33.880]  Admiring a horse or something and I'm not seeing a man like a horse to him
[1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:40.320]  I put the woman down and I'm just like that's an incredible thing. Wow. I'm just glad you're having sex with that and having kids
[1:20:40.680 --> 1:20:45.280]  This makes me feel good for humanity. I look at some, you know, but the average man I've learned
[1:20:46.400 --> 1:20:52.160]  Just is envious of everything and just absolutely can't stand other people's successes
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:56.840]  And so I realized when I saw there will be blood when it came out like ten years ago wherever it was
[1:20:56.840 --> 1:21:00.480]  I thought oh, that's not everybody is you know what that is how people are
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:03.520]  The average man whether he's a garbage
[1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:12.400]  Collector or whether he's a lawyer or whether he's a corporate leader whether he's worth ten billion dollars or he's worth ten thousand that's a
[1:21:14.880 --> 1:21:16.880]  That he doesn't want
[1:21:16.920 --> 1:21:21.360]  He doesn't take pleasure when his friend knocks the hole in one he feels small
[1:21:22.200 --> 1:21:24.200]  So see that's the thing. I'm an individualist
[1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:29.080]  Because I am the most collectivist person there is I
[1:21:29.600 --> 1:21:33.800]  Mean I but I understand that I can't let my collectivism make me give up my will
[1:21:33.800 --> 1:21:36.280]  I have individual power and I love humanity
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:43.600]  But I am a total collectivist. I just I love everyone's success. I love beauty
[1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:47.360]  I love people's art. I celebrate others and my whole life. I would think like
[1:21:49.080 --> 1:21:51.080]  See it's men
[1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:55.800]  That don't like me I mean men listen to me that are patriots and what's going on
[1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:58.720]  We weren't evil and get get that but I mean it women have always liked me
[1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:04.880]  But it's it's other men they see me and they go. What's this guy's angle? How's he trying to get it over you dude?
[1:22:04.880 --> 1:22:08.080]  I'm already over you. I don't need to beat you
[1:22:08.080 --> 1:22:10.840]  I've already spiritually and way above you and by the way
[1:22:10.840 --> 1:22:14.960]  I want to see you transcend with me and be above me because you're a ladder for me to climb up
[1:22:15.360 --> 1:22:17.040]  See you're a ladder
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:22.200]  That's how this works is I want to be a ladder to people to build up and have you destroyed in the process
[1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:27.560]  It's okay because out of that the crystal matrix grows and then other people can get on and we go up
[1:22:27.560 --> 1:22:32.480]  I always watch craps. You always heard this analogy even after I never heard this call was on talk radio
[1:22:32.880 --> 1:22:36.800]  27 years ago, but when I was a kid we go catch crabs with pieces of bacon pull them out
[1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:42.180]  You'll boil them. I just catch crabs all dead text speech like throw out the bacon the crab won't let go
[1:22:42.180 --> 1:22:46.400]  It's greedy get the bucket put it there. I'm gonna have like buckets of crabs and I
[1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:53.320]  Just remember like they never help each other and climb out when they all sit there like ten crabs in a bucket
[1:22:53.320 --> 1:22:57.960]  And then as soon as one crab tried to like go and get up like you're grabbing
[1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:05.800]  Another crab will try to get out they grab him like no you're not leaving me because that's pure dominance
[1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:09.440]  That's there will be blood like you're not climbing out of this thing
[1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:15.360]  You're staying down here with us and that's Satan Satan is in a crab bucket telling us. We're not getting out of here
[1:23:15.360 --> 1:23:18.800]  Well, guess what Satan we're getting out of here because we're not crabs
[1:23:18.800 --> 1:23:24.120]  And I'm gonna find enough souls that want to go to the next level that we're gonna blast out of this thing
[1:23:24.120 --> 1:23:26.620]  Okay, so just screw off the world order
[1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:29.280]  All right, I'm gonna shut up
[1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:31.680]  That special guest joining us
[1:23:31.960 --> 1:23:37.360]  Patrick burn on the other side about a peaceful way out of this still made because we are in the middle of total insanity

[1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:43.000]  All right Patrick burn CEO former CEO of overstock. He's been advised the president very closely been calling for nonviolence and warning of this
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  He joins us here in a moment
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:51.160]  Terrible things are happening, but also good things are happening. The president's had his corporate bank account taken twice bank
[1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:56.320]  This private bank account shut down. It's been done to me already this year last year now
[1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:01.160]  He is having all the shopping carts shut down all his businesses annihilated
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:06.360]  He has in the crucible for standing up for America against the chai comms grudge report now run by a
[1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:08.440]  CNN I was told
[1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:15.960]  Is it's celebrating gg ping is over America America's defeated talk radio is ordering their host do not question elections
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:18.200]  So they can still in the future. We are now becoming
[1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:20.360]  Venezuela and
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:26.080]  Then we're told the cube movement which again is some good people some bad, but the folks that have hijacked it regardless
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:32.720]  Our globalist intel. Yeah, they do know Trump was going to Texas two days ago because they're spying on him
[1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:39.120]  Hey, they're surrounding him and so it's on Trump doesn't want violence. He's declared emergency in DC
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:42.120]  The US is really under a secret martial law decree right now
[1:28:43.400 --> 1:28:47.880]  This is one hell of a time they want 25th Amendment against him. They want
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:52.720]  The impeachment and so Patrick Byrne is a really smart fellow
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:58.320]  He's written an article we'll put on screen and tell you about where there's a peaceful way out of this violent
[1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:03.840]  Steelmate we're in for all Americans old young black white gay straight brown

[1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:22.760]  Well, Alex, thank you for having me on again
[1:29:22.760 --> 1:29:30.040]  And as I've what did not what a good interview you did with Mike Flynn last week too. So you really you're providing a service to the nation
[1:29:30.920 --> 1:29:32.920]  To get this news out
[1:29:33.560 --> 1:29:39.440]  Yeah, I'm you know, it's it's etiquette one never so I wouldn't say I'm advising the president closely
[1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:41.440]  I went in
[1:29:41.440 --> 1:29:47.400]  Great job. The point is you give us your take on what's going on. What's what well first of all what's going on is
[1:29:48.840 --> 1:29:51.240]  There is a way through this which is that?
[1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:56.840]  What the president should done under the authority has under an executive order. He doesn't have to do anything
[1:29:58.840 --> 1:30:00.440]  Martial law
[1:30:00.440 --> 1:30:03.520]  Insurrection act he just has to say under this executive order
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:08.640]  13 848 signed a couple years ago and one that Obama signed five years ago
[1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:13.840]  It's in your article, but say that say the name of the executive order again will pull it up
[1:30:14.720 --> 1:30:17.220]  executive order 13 848
[1:30:17.220 --> 1:30:20.380]  13 848 13 848
[1:30:21.100 --> 1:30:22.700]  Yep
[1:30:22.700 --> 1:30:26.100]  Yeah, so they passed this tip while he signed this two years ago
[1:30:26.100 --> 1:30:32.580]  But it didn't really extend something Obama did if they decide that you know the president can you let only decide this election?
[1:30:32.580 --> 1:30:38.940]  Has been screwed up by foreign interference at which point all he has to do is a and it's a very
[1:30:39.300 --> 1:30:42.060]  Given that we're about to enter civil war. It's see
[1:30:42.860 --> 1:30:46.180]  It seems like a very tame solution to say I'm gonna send the
[1:30:46.180 --> 1:30:50.500]  National Guard the DHS into count those six states
[1:30:50.500 --> 1:30:53.300]  We're just gonna count even just the six problematic counties
[1:30:53.300 --> 1:30:59.340]  We're gonna count those and you know what if I'm wrong and these these votes all are fine
[1:30:59.340 --> 1:31:03.220]  Then I Donald Trump. I'm gonna get on the helicopter next Tuesday. No musto fuss
[1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:05.540]  He could have that answer by Friday
[1:31:05.540 --> 1:31:10.460]  He could have the answer in three days pull the National Guard in to recount six counties and well
[1:31:10.460 --> 1:31:16.860]  The next segment you've got the floor here, but let's talk about the crisis we're in and from your perspective what we're defining
[1:31:16.860 --> 1:31:22.840]  These shadowy groups saying they're gonna attack the 50 governors the the civil war the FBI warning that we're on them
[1:31:23.140 --> 1:31:26.680]  What's the head line at drudge? It's it's you know national uprising
[1:31:28.260 --> 1:31:34.820]  Well, let me tell you story. I was in Eastern Europe a few years ago when I was in Moldova somebody told me a
[1:31:35.580 --> 1:31:38.380]  about what had happened when they had had an election and
[1:31:38.380 --> 1:31:44.860]  And clearly the non pro-russian then the guy the candidate who was not in favor of Putin and Russia
[1:31:45.420 --> 1:31:49.940]  he got cheated and it was a clear case of cheating and
[1:31:50.660 --> 1:31:54.140]  The people took to the street and the the pro-russian guy
[1:31:54.700 --> 1:31:59.340]  One they people took to the streets to protest the cheating
[1:31:59.740 --> 1:32:01.420]  Putin sent people
[1:32:01.420 --> 1:32:04.980]  He sent what are called a zone provocateur is the French expression
[1:32:04.980 --> 1:32:11.620]  He sent Russian is spetsnaz types to go into Moldova and then they would infiltrate the crowds
[1:32:11.620 --> 1:32:16.460]  And then once they were inside the crowds they would try to get the crowds not just to demonstrate
[1:32:16.900 --> 1:32:23.100]  Their dissatisfaction, but to charge government buildings and break windows and things like that. Why did Putin do that?
[1:32:23.260 --> 1:32:27.100]  He knows that there the population was sitting on the sideline
[1:32:27.100 --> 1:32:34.580]  Do we buy this do we not buy it if you can get those people those protesters to charge government buildings and kill people and things
[1:32:34.580 --> 1:32:41.620]  Like that the middle class will abandon you the center of the people will abandon so because they don't want to destabilize country
[1:32:41.620 --> 1:32:43.780]  Exactly, and that's what they've done with the capital last week
[1:32:44.540 --> 1:32:50.100]  Wait exactly and and so I felt you know, I I felt very sorry
[1:32:50.100 --> 1:32:56.980]  I told people when you come be be civil a because we're better than the other side and be if you get violent
[1:32:56.980 --> 1:33:00.580]  They're gonna use it against you you said that on my show the week before Don Jr.
[1:33:00.580 --> 1:33:06.980]  Said in the speech, but they've edited it. He's like, we're not like them that are violent. We're peaceful Trump said that but they're not showing that
[1:33:07.580 --> 1:33:10.260]  Yeah, and then you look at what the tapes from that day
[1:33:11.500 --> 1:33:18.100]  Look does look really suspicious. It looks like cops were welcoming people in looks like looks like the one
[1:33:18.100 --> 1:33:21.420]  She loves some anti well, some people got escorted right to the
[1:33:21.420 --> 1:33:25.900]  What they did is they staged a few clashes and they ordered the cops to stand down and let them in
[1:33:25.900 --> 1:33:33.540]  Yes, and then so that did that did to our side to the pro election integrity side
[1:33:33.820 --> 1:33:38.140]  Exactly what Putin was trying to do now. Fortunately in Moldova
[1:33:38.140 --> 1:33:44.820]  They were too smart to fall for it and the people did not follow the ajan provocateur into government buildings and smash windows
[1:33:44.820 --> 1:33:50.540]  They turned on them and because of that the middle class of Moldova state in the middle of them of the
[1:33:50.540 --> 1:33:55.860]  Citizens are a state on their side and they got they got rid of the Russian guy and they got it
[1:33:55.860 --> 1:33:57.860]  They got their fair election recognized
[1:33:58.100 --> 1:34:03.380]  So when we go if our side goes out there and goes violent
[1:34:03.540 --> 1:34:07.060]  What you are doing is a you're losing middle America
[1:34:07.060 --> 1:34:09.060]  They will not support you and be you know
[1:34:09.340 --> 1:34:15.300]  20% of America will support and then the other thing is you're giving Nancy Pelosi all she needs to
[1:34:15.300 --> 1:34:23.260]  Basically, she wants to have a a law pass that makes it illegal to be Republican and they're gonna do that if you go out and get violent
[1:34:23.260 --> 1:34:25.940]  Oh, yeah, this is real persecution of her radio listeners
[1:34:25.980 --> 1:34:32.500]  We're rolling minute after minute from C-span of the so-called terrorist in between the velvet rubs doing what they were told
[1:34:32.500 --> 1:34:37.980]  There were very few riots inside, but the media focused in on let's say you have a city of five million people
[1:34:38.660 --> 1:34:42.220]  There may be a rape happening in one part and a murder happening every night
[1:34:42.220 --> 1:34:46.180]  Maybe typical get killed if you only focused on those 10 killings in a city
[1:34:46.420 --> 1:34:50.660]  It would look like the city's lawless, but if you pull back, it's not that's what they did
[1:34:51.380 --> 1:34:54.980]  Right, they said they're they're creating they're creating a narrative
[1:34:54.980 --> 1:35:01.220]  If so if we go out if your people go out and protest go out you go and protest keep
[1:35:01.540 --> 1:35:04.460]  Remember the great American tradition of civil disobedience
[1:35:04.620 --> 1:35:08.980]  We will win this if we become a thousand trillion percent agree
[1:35:08.980 --> 1:35:13.420]  But I'm saying is don't just go out and be peaceful speak out against violence and videotape everything
[1:35:14.300 --> 1:35:16.220]  videotape everything and
[1:35:16.220 --> 1:35:19.460]  But it's okay, and if this dirty election goes down
[1:35:19.660 --> 1:35:22.780]  It's perfectly okay to do what the other side did for four years
[1:35:22.780 --> 1:35:26.500]  Everyone should get buttons that say not my president just wear buttons
[1:35:27.340 --> 1:35:31.940]  Listen, I've said civil disobedience if they really steal this and do a free speech crackdown
[1:35:32.100 --> 1:35:36.420]  I'm gonna leave people to block highways. We're gonna go to the White House peacefully
[1:35:36.420 --> 1:35:40.860]  But I mean if they really push I'm gonna like Mahatma Gandhi march into Washington
[1:35:41.580 --> 1:35:48.140]  Well, yeah like like Gandhi not like not like Sherman if you do that if you bring guns
[1:35:48.380 --> 1:35:53.100]  This will not be Sherman's March to the state explain that explain Sherman versus Gandhi
[1:35:53.740 --> 1:35:56.900]  well Sherman was the guy who marched across Georgia and
[1:35:56.900 --> 1:36:05.980]  Gotta look up a Mike Flynn has had me go read Sherman's letter to the to the town burgers of Atlanta and Christmas Eve 1864
[1:36:06.260 --> 1:36:10.060]  Where they basically established the American war. Anyway
[1:36:10.620 --> 1:36:12.460]  Well, it's probably come back because that's true
[1:36:12.460 --> 1:36:17.860]  That's one way to do this and if Patriots did that we would defeat Pelosi. We would defeat my wife
[1:36:18.060 --> 1:36:23.300]  We would defeat you defeat the CFR and Haas because that's the thing if we're really gonna do war
[1:36:23.300 --> 1:36:30.340]  We show a real war is like burn everything in your path kill everything which I'm not calling for not go take selfies in the Capitol
[1:36:30.340 --> 1:36:31.380]  Act like a jackass

[1:38:03.760 --> 1:38:11.600]  They have organizations on message boards and other groups posing as patriot leaders and posing as president Trump

[1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:30.560]  Poses our people and set us up. Thank God the Patriots did not engage in the rioting
[1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:34.760]  So only a few people did it. So the thing was a misfire
[1:38:34.760 --> 1:38:39.600]  It was a dud but the left is hungry to declare all Trump supporters terrorist
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:44.480]  And they're planning terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20th to blame the American people
[1:38:44.480 --> 1:38:48.840]  Do not be part of it. We are peaceful. We are not violent
[1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:55.280]  Now is the time to get prepared you got to pray to God get your soul ready

[1:43:04.280 --> 1:43:08.280]  But the globalists know that we've had a political realignment. They know we've had a global awakening
[1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:13.280]  They're panicking and so now they want to outlaw our speech and to take action
[1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:18.280]  Now they want to outlaw our speech and teach us that we're dissidents under this whole lockdown
[1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:22.280]  So Patrick Byrne going back to you the former CEO of overstock.com
[1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:26.280]  You've been in DC the last few months fighting this you've had your nose the grindstone
[1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:34.280]  Continue with your plan from deep capture.com a peaceful way to resolve the crisis. Let's get into it
[1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:36.280]  Well, we have
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:43.280]  You know one week to do it. Trump could today President Trump could order those six counties be weak
[1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:51.280]  Recount on live stream TV by the National Guard. We see what happens if there is no aberration or irregularities
[1:43:51.280 --> 1:43:57.280]  He gets on his helicopter. No musto fast. He told me that if on the other hand there's big irregularities
[1:43:57.280 --> 1:44:02.280]  Then he should use his executive powers to say you know what this whole election
[1:44:02.280 --> 1:44:09.280]  Pursuant to that executive order I told you about if they show what I think that those may show is 500 to 800,000
[1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:15.280]  Irregular votes in those different counties. He then just says look we're gonna scrub this is obviously so compromised
[1:44:15.280 --> 1:44:22.280]  This election is an egg. We cannot unscramble. I'm gonna have the National Guard rerun an election nationally
[1:44:22.280 --> 1:44:27.280]  30 30 days 45 days they're gonna run it paper ballots only no machines
[1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:32.280]  If you want to vote absentee somebody comes to your door gives you the ballot you fill it out there
[1:44:32.280 --> 1:44:36.280]  So everything it'll be the most it'll be the most drum tight secure
[1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:43.280]  No nonsense election America's ever had and you know what I wouldn't be surprised with the guy won 120 million votes
[1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:47.280]  You know if they did that so that's what he should do but before taking that big step
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:53.280]  He should just send the National Guard into recount the ballots in those six states physical paper ballot counts
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:45:01.280]  When they sold us these machines a decade 15 years ago when they sold the public on these machines all the they always said
[1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:06.280]  There's always gonna be paper ballot as a failsafe you can always just open the box and count the paper ballots
[1:45:06.280 --> 1:45:10.280]  That's it was on that premise that they got our society to accept these machines
[1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:16.280]  Well, I say that the time has clearly arrived whatever that we have we have reached whatever threshold of uncertainty
[1:45:16.280 --> 1:45:20.280]  One needs to have reached to reach the point that we say let's open the boxes
[1:45:20.280 --> 1:45:27.280]  Let's physically count Patrick you're right and I mean now they're trying to announce major talk radio groups you never sang
[1:45:27.280 --> 1:45:36.280]  You don't question elections so you don't question vaccine dangers you don't question elections you don't question policies
[1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:43.280]  You this is super authoritarianism like Tucker Carlson said last night this makes the hair on his arms stand up
[1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:46.280]  This is real 1984 tyranny
[1:45:46.280 --> 1:45:52.280]  It is in fact Twitter outlawed the hashtag 1984 which should tells you tell you something
[1:45:52.280 --> 1:45:54.280]  Wow they just did that
[1:45:54.280 --> 1:45:56.280]  Yeah yesterday
[1:45:56.280 --> 1:46:01.280]  She's a memory hole 1984 Wow
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:09.280]  Yeah, so we have to we we lose if we lose the center of America which we do if we bring violence
[1:46:09.280 --> 1:46:14.280]  We have to be the peaceful ones and let the goons expose themselves for who they are
[1:46:14.280 --> 1:46:19.280]  So Patrick I mean I'll just be I'll just be brass tacks with you right down the wire here
[1:46:19.280 --> 1:46:24.280]  We know the election was stolen there's overwhelming evidence of it but I've moved past Trump trying to prove that now
[1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:31.280]  It's about him changing the subject that Joe Biden plans to screw you agenda 21 to 2030 great reset to lock you down
[1:46:31.280 --> 1:46:38.280]  This is about to happen we need to form a national movement to oppose this peacefully let's be peaceful I think that's where Trump needs to be right now
[1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:42.280]  Right let's and let's show them for what they are
[1:46:42.280 --> 1:46:47.280]  But there's still a way out of it he could have that answer by Friday if he pulled the trigger on it today
[1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:51.280]  The National Guard could have counted by Friday or Saturday
[1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:57.280]  So is there a way for him to turn the tide to the eleventh hour I agree what do you think his speech from Texas
[1:46:57.280 --> 1:47:00.280]  Heard about an hour and 30 minutes is gonna be
[1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:04.280]  Not a I heard that he flew to Texas but I don't know any details
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:07.280]  He's in Alamo Texas he's about to give a speech in an hour
[1:47:07.280 --> 1:47:10.280]  Well that may be symbolic that he's in Alamo
[1:47:10.280 --> 1:47:12.280]  You know you can't
[1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:14.280]  Oh wow that is symbolic isn't it
[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:18.280]  Yeah he should take and you're down there by not far from there as I recall
[1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:20.280]  Oh yeah my ancestor was there yeah
[1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:22.280]  Oh was he who was your ancestor
[1:47:22.280 --> 1:47:23.280]  Someone I know
[1:47:23.280 --> 1:47:24.280]  I just look it up it doesn't really matter
[1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:25.280]  Oh well
[1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:28.280]  It doesn't matter I don't live off the past laurels it's just an interesting story yeah
[1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:30.280]  David Crockett okay well
[1:47:30.280 --> 1:47:31.280]  No not David Crockett
[1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:34.280]  Yeah I could still resolve this there's a totally peaceful way through this
[1:47:34.280 --> 1:47:37.280]  Count the six counties if it comes up really irregular
[1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:41.280]  Rerun the national election in 30 days with a national guard
[1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:45.280]  That way there is no reason for anyone to fight
[1:47:45.280 --> 1:47:50.280]  But if you don't do that and we install this new guy next Tuesday
[1:47:50.280 --> 1:47:55.280]  This is something that will never 47% of America will never believe that this
[1:47:55.280 --> 1:48:00.280]  And then the things that they're doing are the exact things you would do in order to aggravate it
[1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:03.280]  Instead of saying there's going to be open discourse about it
[1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:06.280]  They're making it a thought crime to do anything
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:09.280]  Oh I mean here's the deal Patrick I knew Tierney was coming
[1:48:09.280 --> 1:48:14.280]  This is so fabulous and so flaming and so grandiose
[1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:19.280]  I mean it's so classical but then a 2.0 that I'm just like stunned
[1:48:19.280 --> 1:48:22.280]  Like Tucker Carlson is just stunned as well it's like what the heck
[1:48:22.280 --> 1:48:25.280]  It's like you think Godzilla is coming out of the ocean
[1:48:25.280 --> 1:48:27.280]  And something ten times bigger comes out
[1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:30.280]  I mean this is the bona fide
[1:48:30.280 --> 1:48:34.280]  Well it was it was beautifully beautifully managed
[1:48:34.280 --> 1:48:37.280]  All the stages they they pulled it off perfectly
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:41.280]  Slickly you know the demoralization from COVID
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:43.280]  The disorientation from Antifa
[1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:46.280]  This this crisis of a rigged election
[1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:50.280]  And now normalization normalization it's just so no matter what happens
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:54.280]  And so if Biden does God forbid actually gets sworn in
[1:48:54.280 --> 1:48:59.280]  For the future remember do not give them a we we want to be the guys
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:03.280]  Where just the same badges they did not my president things like that
[1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:06.280]  Make them be the goons make them be the goons in America
[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:08.280]  They will they will middle America
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:12.280]  One trillion percent agree with you who shoots first loses
[1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:15.280]  So they're gonna shoot in our name that's a classic false flag
[1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:18.280]  How do we fight that I think most people should not come with children
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:22.280]  People should not go to these capital events if you go be really safe
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:25.280]  And try to stop violence and videotape everything
[1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:31.280]  Videotape everything do not do not be show America that we are the good guys
[1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:34.280]  So look at how Martin Luther King did this in the 60s
[1:49:34.280 --> 1:49:39.280]  Show America that we are the good guys do not take part do not sanction
[1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:46.280]  People take it took a lot of will to get firehose and beat over the head and bit by dogs
[1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:50.280]  But they knew what Gandhi had done work they were doing it again
[1:49:50.280 --> 1:49:55.280]  Yeah, I'm not sure we have to go that far but for now at this point
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:49:58.280]  I wonder what's gonna happen in law enforcement in the military
[1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:02.280]  Because there's a lot of people in law enforcement from when I'm connected to some of those communities
[1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:07.280]  Oh, I'm gonna write myself in the story did you know they sent a SWAT team to get Roger
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:11.280]  He had a bad feeling already left by four to the hotel with the Willard
[1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:14.280]  They came with a SWAT team for me as well saying we did the attack
[1:50:14.280 --> 1:50:18.280]  Then cops learned that I said don't be violent they refused to arrest me
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:22.280]  That they came to arrest me did you know they were gonna blame Roger and I but Roger didn't go
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:27.280]  I tried to stop it the very cops had seen that and said we've been ordered to arrest you but we're not gonna do it
[1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:28.280]  That happened
[1:50:28.280 --> 1:50:31.280]  Good good good good
[1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:35.280]  We're just asking what are the cops gonna do there's an example right there
[1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:39.280]  I have COVID now by the way just to let you know that's why I'm coughing
[1:50:39.280 --> 1:50:41.280]  But I can't get we're practicing
[1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:44.280]  Well you look really healthy you know the PCR test told you that
[1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:48.280]  Yeah, you know 96% of those are false
[1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:52.280]  It's like a motto this is real I have a mild flu I feel it
[1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:58.280]  Well no people get colds people get flus but they're calling basically the PCR test if you have any viral background
[1:50:58.280 --> 1:51:00.280]  Says that you have COVID
[1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:01.280]  Oh really
[1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:03.280]  That's what the environment says
[1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:05.280]  Dude five more minutes stay there Patrick Byrne
[1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:11.280]  You've got the website deepcapture.com you've got a great plan to fix this peacefully I fully endorse it
[1:51:11.280 --> 1:51:13.280]  And I agree with him peace is the answer
[1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:19.280]  Well Biden is stealing this bigger Dallas they need a violent confrontation at the end to make him look like a victim to change the subject
[1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:25.280]  Do not let it happen we'll be right back in one minute with Patrick Byrne to finish up then
[1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:32.280]  Allie Alexander they claim he's in hiding no he's not as many person than Joel Scowles and Joyce's I'm Alex Jones
[1:51:32.280 --> 1:51:33.280]  That's all it's the exclusive
[1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:36.280]  Giuliani believes Trump has already been in hiding
[1:51:39.280 --> 1:51:42.280]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado thank you for holding
[1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:43.280]  How you doing Alex?
[1:51:43.280 --> 1:51:47.280]  Man I'm just working as hard as I can we're in such a critical time brother how are you?
[1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:55.280]  I love you man I want to make a quick plug that DNA force I love it I've been using it quite a while and I just went
[1:51:55.280 --> 1:51:59.280]  Looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see that it contains Corsican
[1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:09.280]  Which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkala has cited is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine
[1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:14.280]  And it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look at that
[1:52:14.280 --> 1:52:22.280]  All I know is with DNA force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics
[1:52:22.280 --> 1:52:26.280]  That aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive products
[1:52:26.280 --> 1:52:33.280]  And it was really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this
[1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:35.280]  So thanks thanks for the plug
[1:52:35.280 --> 1:52:46.280]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth
[1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:53.280]  Create a planetary universal income which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone
[1:52:53.280 --> 1:53:01.280]  And finally a chip under your skin it's all now completely official part of the UN great reset of the Davos group and Klaus Schwab
[1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:06.280]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation all the rest of them
[1:53:06.280 --> 1:53:15.280]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030 it's here and only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all
[1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:22.280]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, good versus evil and stopping abortion
[1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:31.280]  We must start valuing human life again, we must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential
[1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:53.280]  Until we do that we are all slaves, we must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now
[1:53:53.280 --> 1:54:06.280]  We're going where eagles dare, we're into DC to challenge the frogs in election, they staged the false flag, it doesn't matter to us
[1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:08.280]  We just keep fighting
[1:54:12.280 --> 1:54:16.280]  And remember I'm not your little globlous minion, I'm fighting back
[1:54:16.280 --> 1:54:23.280]  All right Patrick Byrne thank you so much, former Overstock CEO
[1:54:23.280 --> 1:54:29.280]  You got five minutes left to finish up your great points, I'm Sampatica with you, I totally agree with you
[1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:34.280]  But how do we manifest not having our people sucked into violence this weekend and next week?
[1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:43.280]  That's a great question, somebody's weird when I was just about to leave DC a militia, a man sought me out and found me
[1:54:43.280 --> 1:54:52.280]  And I had a very unsettling conversation with him, he said, you need to know Patrick, this sounds crazy to me and I hope this isn't true
[1:54:52.280 --> 1:55:01.280]  But he said, Patrick do you know there are tens of thousands or maybe more people around this country that we will do whatever you say
[1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:04.280]  When you say give the word for war we're ready to come
[1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:11.280]  And I said, holy Christ, if you want to do something for me do not go violent
[1:55:11.280 --> 1:55:14.280]  If you go violent they're going to, that will guarantee you
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:18.280]  Oh I know they asked me to, they're looking for someone to tell them to do it
[1:55:18.280 --> 1:55:20.280]  And no we're not doing that
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:30.280]  No, so, but I would, you know, I think that we, I want us to keep fighting this and maybe we can change the outcome by Tuesday
[1:55:30.280 --> 1:55:33.280]  If Trump would do just this one thing that he could do that
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:36.280]  Patrick he should show leadership instead of being on defense
[1:55:36.280 --> 1:55:45.280]  If God forbid this happens then what we do is we just adopt the exact same techniques they used except over the last four years
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:48.280]  But without burning buildings and police cars and stuff
[1:55:48.280 --> 1:55:53.280]  We wear pins, we're perfectly polite, but get pins that say not my president
[1:55:53.280 --> 1:55:59.280]  And, you know, and be, and we can practice civil disobedience too, non-violent civil disobedience
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:01.280]  And we let things out
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:05.280]  Don't wear the mask, don't go along with them, there's a thousand things we can do
[1:56:05.280 --> 1:56:11.280]  That express you have not bought in, do not let them under any circumstance
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:19.280]  Make you normalize, normalize that yes you believe Biden was the legitimate elected president
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:23.280]  Nancy Pelosi did it to our side for four years, we can do it to them
[1:56:23.280 --> 1:56:29.280]  We would just always maintain civil disobedience as far as we do not believe Joe Biden won fairly
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:34.280]  And, you know, two years, you know, if we hold that out for two years I think there's going to be
[1:56:34.280 --> 1:56:39.280]  Oh, the other thing is you have to, this is what everybody has to spend the next two years doing
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:44.280]  Election integrity, volunteer in your local precincts, learn how the system works
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:50.280]  Demand, you know, demand integrity, demand, you know, at the local level get this fixed
[1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:54.280]  In two years you will win in a landslide like you've never seen
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:57.280]  That's right, if we're not violent we win in a landslide
[1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:01.280]  And we expose the COVID exaggeration, we expose the COVID industrial complex
[1:57:01.280 --> 1:57:05.280]  We expose that fraud as well because that's a key control grid
[1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:09.280]  Yeah, and, you know, there's still some hope that the Supreme Court
[1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:12.280]  When this gets to the Supreme Court there have been such woossies
[1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:18.280]  You know, the Supreme Court betrayed us once terribly when they, when they, when Roosevelt FDR threatened to stack the Supreme Court
[1:57:18.280 --> 1:57:22.280]  And they bowed in 1937, but they have a chance
[1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:27.280]  When they have to, they have to come forward after this whole mess
[1:57:27.280 --> 1:57:32.280]  And to see this as a civil rights violation, when there's this much slop in the election, every fake vote
[1:57:32.280 --> 1:57:35.280]  Cancels the legitimate vote of one legitimate voter
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:39.280]  So you can't have this kind of voter suppression, this is mass voter suppression
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:41.280]  By allowing there to be much slop
[1:57:41.280 --> 1:57:45.280]  No, you're right, they want to discredit resistance to election fraud and say it's all terrorist and basically outlaw it
[1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:50.280]  As all these legislatures pick up, the task of saying what happened here was illegal, which it was
[1:57:50.280 --> 1:57:54.280]  Yes, and we do not, and so we go without being violent
[1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:57.280]  We would refuse to accept that, it will end up in courts
[1:57:57.280 --> 1:58:02.280]  And the courts, which remember Trump did a good thing here, the courts, the federal courts are going to say
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:05.280]  That's an insane infringement upon free speech
[1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:11.280]  To be trying to outlaw a political position like that we have to be careful about election fraud
[1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:13.280]  So these are the kind of tactics we're going to
[1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:17.280]  Yeah, exactly, one is more responsibility to disobey unjust laws
[1:58:17.280 --> 1:58:20.280]  Read a letter from a Birmingham jail from King
[1:58:20.280 --> 1:58:25.280]  I get all for clamp, so we have options, but those options do not include going violent
[1:58:25.280 --> 1:58:27.280]  If you do that, we lose
[1:58:27.280 --> 1:58:32.280]  And I agree, and you point out, it's on Drudge Report, China is celebrating they run this, they're celebrating a victory
[1:58:32.280 --> 1:58:36.280]  Say to Americans, when you're poor under Biden, remember Trump tried to give you prosperity
[1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:39.280]  The globalists did it, just talk about the Chi-Com takeover
[1:58:39.280 --> 1:58:42.280]  Now they suppress their own people and how big tech's involved
[1:58:42.280 --> 1:58:44.280]  Patrick Byrne, thank you so much
[1:58:44.280 --> 1:58:46.280]  Take care Alex, thank you
[1:58:46.280 --> 1:58:52.280]  Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best seller overnight
[1:58:52.280 --> 1:58:57.280]  Because activated charcoal is already one of the top selling fastest growing toothpaste out there
[1:58:57.280 --> 1:59:02.280]  The problem is, a lot of the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very, very toxic
[1:59:02.280 --> 1:59:04.280]  And also they have fluoride in it
[1:59:04.280 --> 1:59:07.280]  This does not have the fluoride, it doesn't have the additives
[1:59:07.280 --> 1:59:11.280]  This is a concentrated, it really is, high quality, it's been sold out for months
[1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:16.280]  Because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID, martial law garbage, but now it's back in stock
[1:59:16.280 --> 1:59:21.280]  Info Wars, Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal toothpaste
[1:59:21.280 --> 1:59:27.280]  Now back in stock at infowarstore.com or call toll free, triple A, 253-33139

[1:59:33.280 --> 1:59:35.280]  And it supports the Info War
[1:59:35.280 --> 1:59:40.280]  Activated charcoal from Dr. Jones Naturals, available again at infowarsstore.com
[1:59:40.280 --> 1:59:45.280]  And a lot of other products that have been sold out have just now come back in as well, like pollen block

[2:00:15.280 --> 2:00:20.280]  From a well-known individual I talked to this morning, who's never given me bad info, who talked to Giuliani
[2:00:20.280 --> 2:00:23.280]  Now however they're holding it over, Trump's head to make him resign
[2:00:23.280 --> 2:00:26.280]  You notice Trump has left DC
[2:00:26.280 --> 2:00:30.280]  This is a big deal, that's what I hosted, part of the new weekday morning show
[2:00:30.280 --> 2:00:35.280]  American Journal with Harrodson Smith, American Journal, 8am
[2:00:35.280 --> 2:00:42.280]  Weekday mornings, infowars.com and newswars.com
[2:00:42.280 --> 2:00:47.280]  Ali Alexander is getting on a Skype right now, we're getting him on in a minute or two
[2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:50.280]  I wanted to talk about him because you see these headlines
[2:00:50.280 --> 2:00:54.280]  Wall Street Journal retracts claim, the Epoch Times reports, thank you Epoch Times
[2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:57.280]  That Alex Jones encouraged capital storming
[2:00:57.280 --> 2:01:02.280]  Why the hell would I want to do that and destroy myself in America and Trump's
[2:01:02.280 --> 2:01:06.280]  It's like saying why would I shoot myself with a head
[2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:12.280]  I mean we're talking hundreds of thousands of tweets calling for my arrest, we're talking hundreds of articles
[2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:18.280]  Saying arrest Jones, he sent people to storm the capital
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:24.280]  I had a bunch of pro-Trump rallies, this was our greatest rally, almost a million people are more
[2:01:24.280 --> 2:01:32.280]  And I get there and a small group of people, Antifa and some other paramilitary group
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:36.280]  Bus through, the police stand down, it all happens
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:42.280]  So Wall Street Journal retracts claim that Alex Jones encouraged building storming
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:48.280]  And then Ali Alexander, love Ali, hate Ali, he's a hardworking guy that gets these rallies going
[2:01:48.280 --> 2:01:53.280]  And fought the steel around the country, stop the steel organizer Ali Alexander
[2:01:53.280 --> 2:02:01.280]  In hiding after denying blame for the capital, that's the daily beast
[2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:08.280]  Ali had all of his social media, Twitter, Facebook, his email, his websites all taken
[2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:14.280]  He has no voice, he was marching with us after Trump asked to lead the march
[2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:17.280]  We got there after a huge crowd was already there, violence already happened
[2:02:17.280 --> 2:02:22.280]  He tried to calm the crowd down, tried to stop it, most of the crowd was totally peaceful
[2:02:22.280 --> 2:02:29.280]  So when they say, oh Ali Alexander is in hiding
[2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:36.280]  Ali Alexander ran this, he's not, he's been de-platformed, and that's what they do
[2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:42.280]  If they could ever shut me down completely or have no voice anywhere, they would say, Jones is in hiding
[2:02:42.280 --> 2:02:47.280]  That's a lie, I could be dead at the bottom of the ocean, I could be in a supermax prison
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:53.280]  They would say that
[2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:59.280]  So that's where we are as a culture, that's where we are as a society, we're going to get him on the line
[2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:03.280]  And then we've got Joel Scowls and others joining us here today
[2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:09.280]  I don't want to air this report, it's already a few days old, but it's so powerful by Greg Reis
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:12.280]  And it really tells it all
[2:03:12.280 --> 2:03:18.280]  Proof, clip six, capital building riot was started by false flag
[2:03:18.280 --> 2:03:23.280]  And this is a band-up video and the system hopes all day and all night
[2:03:23.280 --> 2:03:30.280]  That you don't get this information and you don't get it out, but all I ask listeners now at this key crossroads
[2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:35.280]  Is that you understand we're under attack, we're fighting harder than ever to stay on air
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:39.280]  And we were built for this moment with the information we're covering, so please
[2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:45.280]  Your email list, your text message list, your Facebook, your Twitter, so what they're going to ban you anyways
[2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:50.280]  Your word of mouth, tell folks about band.video
[2:03:50.280 --> 2:03:55.280]  Tell folks about info wars.com, be proud of it and say it predicted it, that's why it was banned first
[2:03:55.280 --> 2:04:00.280]  Now the president's banned, now the president's losing his banking, now the president's lost his email
[2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:06.280]  Because if they can get Alex Jones, then they can get the president and then they can get everybody
[2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:11.280]  And that's the point we've reached in this civilization
[2:04:11.280 --> 2:04:17.280]  This is, as Tucker Carlson said last night, if he couldn't get any better, he hit it last night
[2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:22.280]  I watched it early this morning, I woke up at 5am, because I was with my children last night when Tucker was on
[2:04:22.280 --> 2:04:28.280]  I didn't watch TV last night, but I watched it this morning at 5am drinking coffee when it was still dark outside
[2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:33.280]  He said, if you're not getting chills and the hair on your arms isn't standing up, you're crazy
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:38.280]  If you read this in a history book, this would be Nazi Germany, I mean, our Soviet Union
[2:04:38.280 --> 2:04:42.280]  I mean, this is, this would win the Kentucky Derby
[2:04:42.280 --> 2:04:47.280]  If you had horses and the tyrant wins, imagine the top horses named Tyrant
[2:04:47.280 --> 2:04:53.280]  This is the triple crown winner, this isn't just one of the Kentucky Derby
[2:04:53.280 --> 2:05:00.280]  It won the other two big races, I mean, this is the big one, this is the Mac Daddy
[2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:03.280]  This is the big Kahuna
[2:05:03.280 --> 2:05:13.280]  I mean, this is from every stitch of its garment, every cell of its body, the most evil, focused, demonic force the planet's ever seen
[2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:19.280]  Here's Greg Reese's report, it's at Band-Aunt Video, proof DC Capital Riot was staged false-flight
[2:05:21.280 --> 2:05:32.280]  When the CCP, who openly runs death camps, slave labor factories, and earns billions of dollars each year harvesting their organs
[2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:39.280]  Attempts to overthrow your country, what exactly are you supposed to do?
[2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:50.280]  The grotesque vassals of the CCP occupying the highest levels of our government would have you believe that you should bleed out and die
[2:05:50.280 --> 2:05:58.280]  On January 6, 2021, millions of great Americans were betrayed by their government
[2:05:58.280 --> 2:06:07.280]  They came from all over the country to defend fair elections in America and rightfully demand justice under the laws of the Constitution
[2:06:07.280 --> 2:06:22.280]  It would be the most historical protest in American history, well over a million Americans gathered at the Capitol to demand that Congress not certify the election in light of overwhelming evidence of election fraud
[2:06:22.280 --> 2:06:28.280]  After all their betrayals, the average American still believed in the Democratic process
[2:06:28.280 --> 2:06:34.280]  They believed in the First Amendment, and they came to exercise that right
[2:06:34.280 --> 2:06:46.280]  At the end of President Trump's speech, he announced that we are going to the Capitol to give our elected officials the pride and boldness they need to do the right thing
[2:06:46.280 --> 2:07:00.280]  So we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, I love Pennsylvania Avenue, and we're going to the Capitol, and we're going to try and give
[2:07:00.280 --> 2:07:06.280]  The Democrats are hopeless, they're never voting for anything, not even one vote
[2:07:06.280 --> 2:07:14.280]  But we're going to try and give our Republicans the weak ones because the strong ones don't need any of our help
[2:07:14.280 --> 2:07:22.280]  We're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country
[2:07:22.280 --> 2:07:31.280]  So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, I want to thank you all, God bless you and God bless America
[2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:34.280]  Thank you all for being here, this is incredible, thank you very much
[2:07:34.280 --> 2:07:44.280]  But it was this righteousness that blinded us from the enemy's deceit, Capitol Police opened the gates and ushered in the crowd
[2:07:44.280 --> 2:07:56.280]  Photolops were directed inside, BLM activist John Sullivan, who was arrested for organizing a violent riot in Utah, was inside the state Capitol
[2:07:56.280 --> 2:08:05.280]  Agent provocateurs were seen instigating violence, and the crowd tried stopping them, many of us already knew that we'd been set up
[2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:16.280]  We're not Antifa, we're not the other, you're amazing, I love you, let's march around the other side, and let's not fight the police and give the system what they want
[2:08:16.280 --> 2:08:24.280]  The provocateurs have caused a problem, and the police are throwing flashbangs, we don't want to have a Kent State here
[2:08:24.280 --> 2:08:39.280]  But others gave in to mob mentality, and people died, a window leading into the House chamber was broken, and as Ashley Babbitt climbed through, she was shot without warning
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:48.280]  After 14 years of serving her country, 35-year-old war veteran Ashley Babbitt was disgracefully killed
[2:08:48.280 --> 2:09:00.280]  Vice President Pence praises Capitol Police, and after certifying the election, with Ashley Babbitt's blood still fresh on the floors, Pence receives a gold coin
[2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:04.280]  Like Judas Iscariot, the betrayal is complete
[2:09:04.280 --> 2:09:11.280]  The CCP and their global propaganda apparatus are trying to paint Ashley Babbitt as a terrorist
[2:09:11.280 --> 2:09:20.280]  They are trying to paint all patriots as terrorists, they are now coming for all of us
[2:09:20.280 --> 2:09:27.280]  Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable
[2:09:27.280 --> 2:09:35.280]  Our only options at this point is for Trump to act swiftly with the military, or a revolution by the people
[2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:42.280]  One way or the other, war is upon us
[2:10:05.280 --> 2:10:10.280]  Band.video and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned
[2:10:10.280 --> 2:10:16.280]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:20.280]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail
[2:10:20.280 --> 2:10:27.280]  But the new website is TheResistance.video
[2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:31.280]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them
[2:10:31.280 --> 2:10:39.280]  So the new URL that links right to Band.video, and all of our videos, and all of our documentaries, and all the special reports, and all the suppressed information
[2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:42.280]  Is that TheResistance.video? Share the link
[2:10:42.280 --> 2:11:04.280]  TheResistance.video
[2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:12.280]  If I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones' show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it did for me personally
[2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:18.280]  Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 20, thanks to this info store product
[2:11:18.280 --> 2:11:24.280]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night, so I'm doing what I can, brother
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:35.280]  My contention is, why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of Living Defense
[2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:36.280]  I learned that
[2:11:36.280 --> 2:11:38.280]  So it's like God working is so amazing
[2:11:38.280 --> 2:11:56.280]  We didn't know, we didn't screen your call, we had no idea, and I go to you a year later and you're telling people about Living Defense
[2:12:08.280 --> 2:12:19.280]  Megan McCain, daughter of the war criminal is on the view, saying arrest anyone that protested the election and put them in Gitmo
[2:12:19.280 --> 2:12:24.280]  Well, Allie Alexander is one of her main targets, is what she had to say
[2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:26.280]  Sorry, I can't, it's hard to
[2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:28.280]  That's alright
[2:12:28.280 --> 2:12:33.280]  I just think we need to treat the domestic terrorists the way we do actual terrorists
[2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:39.280]  I think we need to consider all possibilities, I'm not again sending these people to Gitmo, and that may sound extreme
[2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:44.280]  These are domestic terrorists who attacked our own republic, they should be treated the same way we treat Al-Qaeda
[2:12:44.280 --> 2:12:52.280]  It's her father that famously funded Al-Qaeda, who was photographed at the heads of them in Al-Nusra in Syria just five years ago
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:55.280]  Her father is now in hell
[2:12:55.280 --> 2:13:01.280]  But, Allie Alexander joins us, he's ready for Gitmo in his orange jumpsuit right now
[2:13:01.280 --> 2:13:05.280]  Mainstream media is saying he's hiding, but he's been de-platformed everywhere
[2:13:05.280 --> 2:13:09.280]  He's not hiding, he's got a few venues to speak out
[2:13:09.280 --> 2:13:12.280]  He was there with me, the thought criminal that led the violent assault
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:15.280]  He was there with me on the board saying, don't assault, stop, stop
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:18.280]  To the small minority of the hundreds of thousands, the few hundred that went in
[2:13:18.280 --> 2:13:26.280]  Allie, you're not hiding like the Daily Beast in Newsweek and CNN are saying, no, you're here on air
[2:13:26.280 --> 2:13:31.280]  This is incredible, it's how they ban you, they de-platform you, they steal your identity and then lie in your name
[2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:37.280]  You're not scared, though you are in your orange jumpsuit, ready to eat dog food at Gitmo
[2:13:37.280 --> 2:13:44.280]  Yeah, well, you know, Alex, I'm not in hiding, but, you know, for my own protection
[2:13:44.280 --> 2:13:52.280]  Because of the tens of thousands of people that the media has inspired to issue me death threat
[2:13:52.280 --> 2:13:59.280]  Then Patois and, you know, call for my public execution
[2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:06.280]  I am at an undisclosed location, I've had to travel by unconventional means
[2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:09.280]  You know, look, I've done well in my career, but I don't have-
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:12.280]  So you were put on a no fly list?
[2:14:12.280 --> 2:14:18.280]  No, I don't know, I just decided that I was not going to use my plane ticket outside of-
[2:14:18.280 --> 2:14:22.280]  So that's why they're mad, they're saying they're trying to arrest you right now
[2:14:22.280 --> 2:14:30.280]  I have no knowledge that they're trying to arrest me, I will make myself available to anyone who wants to talk to me in our government
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:38.280]  But look, I have nothing really to say, everything that I know is public, thankfully, it was reported by your crew
[2:14:38.280 --> 2:14:43.280]  And the timestamps are actually going to condemn a lot of our government
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:46.280]  When everything comes out that you and I know
[2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:50.280]  I remember you telling me, tell everybody to be peaceful, of course we're peaceful
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:52.280]  But you were the one telling me to say that
[2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:58.280]  Yeah, I mean, look, the fact is that you and I were escorted out by Secret Service
[2:14:58.280 --> 2:15:06.280]  In order to leave the overflow from our event with the president to the US Capitol peacefully
[2:15:06.280 --> 2:15:12.280]  What you and I did not know is that there were tens of thousands of people who did not attend a stop the seal rally
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:20.280]  They did not attend the Save America march rally, they attended none of our events, they had their own agenda
[2:15:20.280 --> 2:15:24.280]  Right, and so look, a lot of people got caught up in the moments
[2:15:24.280 --> 2:15:32.280]  You and I then started proceeding down Pennsylvania Avenue, we stopped at Freedom Plaza, we addressed a crowd for about 10 minutes
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:36.280]  And what we know now is that that was by the grace of God
[2:15:36.280 --> 2:15:41.280]  Because if you and I had just marched, we would have been in the front line on the US Capitol and we would have been blamed
[2:15:41.280 --> 2:15:47.280]  And we have the videos of Antifa and this other paramilitary group on their phones with watches going go, go, go
[2:15:47.280 --> 2:15:51.280]  To time it right when we got there, but thank God we stopped to give a speech
[2:15:51.280 --> 2:15:58.280]  Yeah, I believe that forces within our government coordinated with the paramilitary arm of the Democrat Party to have
[2:15:58.280 --> 2:16:05.280]  Disgusting events inside the US Capitol and not everybody was discussing who entered the US Capitol, I want to be very clear, okay?
[2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:09.280]  No, the vast majority stayed within the velvet ropes
[2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:16.280]  Right, and this is what I like to tell people is if the mob was coming to perform an insurrection
[2:16:16.280 --> 2:16:23.280]  Then they would have breached the US House floor, what we know is that only Jake, that weird Q shaman
[2:16:23.280 --> 2:16:33.280]  And by the way, a lot of people don't know this, here's an exclusive, Jake actually protested, counter protested the last stop the steal rally in Arizona
[2:16:33.280 --> 2:16:39.280]  So Jake actually has a packed stop the steal in Arizona
[2:16:39.280 --> 2:16:44.280]  He's attended our rallies before, and then when he wasn't allowed to speak, he protested us
[2:16:44.280 --> 2:16:47.280]  So a lot of people need to understand I've got all the proof
[2:16:47.280 --> 2:16:52.280]  And then we've got John Sullivan and admitted Antifa saying I dressed up and let a hundred Antifa to stage it
[2:16:52.280 --> 2:16:56.280]  And they're all wearing black, they won't wear our multicolors, like you're wearing orange
[2:16:56.280 --> 2:17:02.280]  Yeah, I'm fat so I wear black, but almost all Trump supporters wear bright colors for every reason
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:07.280]  Yeah, well look at me, you know, Orange Man good or Orange Man was good
[2:17:07.280 --> 2:17:19.280]  But look, the fact is that you and I jeopardized our own safety and we ushered about 15,000 people from the front of the US Capitol to the back of the US Capitol
[2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:25.280]  That's what Harrison Smith said yesterday, he said Pelosi ought to think of us if she was so scared, because we literally got them to stop going in
[2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:34.280]  Yeah, and you and I, we really risked our own safety and you and I have it on reporting that we approached three, the US Capitol police three different times
[2:17:34.280 --> 2:17:36.280]  Hold them who we were
[2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:39.280]  We went three levels up and got a commander's agreement that we should go up
[2:17:39.280 --> 2:17:43.280]  I wasn't dumb, I wasn't going up there without their permission in the middle of a riot
[2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:50.280]  Yeah, so what I want to tell the media is that you guys don't know what you're doing because Alex and I have all of the proof
[2:17:50.280 --> 2:18:01.280]  It's all on video, not only will we be vindicated, we are heroes of this event that we chilled a lot of people from going in
[2:18:01.280 --> 2:18:09.280]  I just want to revisit what I was saying is that if there was an insurrection happening, then thousands or hundreds would have poured onto the House floor
[2:18:09.280 --> 2:18:18.280]  What happened is a lot of patriots got caught up by the police escorting them in or the door already being opened and then they think, oh, we're going to yell in the rotunda
[2:18:18.280 --> 2:18:23.280]  And then we have video of patriots beating up Antifa trying to breach
[2:18:23.280 --> 2:18:28.280]  We have patriots fighting with the cops against Antifa with hours of video
[2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:37.280]  Yeah, so the good news is that, you know, you've got an entire team that is countering the narrative, but eventually we're going to put together your team and my team
[2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:46.280]  A great video that shows everything in chronological order with the timestamp with my text messages that I was getting from actual intelligence and I'm relaying that directly to you
[2:18:46.280 --> 2:18:53.280]  I mean, Alex, you are a great guy. As soon as you and I found out that people were beating the police, we started, we took off running, hoping to de-escalate
[2:18:53.280 --> 2:18:59.280]  The Trump campaign then texted me and says, you guys need to get there to de-escalate, and I said, we are going to de-escalate
[2:18:59.280 --> 2:19:02.280]  And if we can't de-escalate, we'll leave so that other people will leave
[2:19:02.280 --> 2:19:07.280]  And then you told me Trump's not coming once we got there, and I climbed up on top of that pile of chairs and tried to stop it
[2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:12.280]  Why would we not want Trump there? Why would we want this? And it's not worth trying not to get indicted
[2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:17.280]  It's a total fraud. The left did this. They are such dirty bastards, man
[2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:27.280]  They're dirty bastards, and there's crooked cops in this, and so I applaud the House Democrats who feel like their safety is in danger, and they're not in on this, on this hoax
[2:19:27.280 --> 2:19:33.280]  So they're calling for investigations into the U.S. Capitol Police, and I will make myself available to anybody
[2:19:33.280 --> 2:19:39.280]  I was about to say, I don't want to be demonized, these Senate and House hearings. I want to be called, I want to expose what happened
[2:19:39.280 --> 2:19:44.280]  I will not sit there and watch them claim I did this when I did the opposite
[2:19:44.280 --> 2:19:52.280]  Yeah, there's no text message that I received during that period that I don't intend to make public. None. There's nothing to hide
[2:19:52.280 --> 2:19:58.280]  There's no information to hide, and you know, unfortunately they can't get the president on this, so they want to get you and me
[2:19:58.280 --> 2:20:02.280]  And I'm going to tell you, they're not getting my stop on this. I'm not going to die on the spot
[2:20:02.280 --> 2:20:06.280]  Well, exactly. Here's the deal
[2:20:06.280 --> 2:20:13.280]  They staged this. They know they've been caught, and they're scared. It was meant to be much worse, but thank God the Patriots didn't go along with them
[2:20:13.280 --> 2:20:21.280]  Thank God. I mean, it's really by the grace of God, because our government was against us, our opponents were against us, and now
[2:20:21.280 --> 2:20:27.280]  parts of our own side are too powerfully to take a moment and consider, is the media lying about these events?
[2:20:27.280 --> 2:20:33.280]  But we have the time seams, Alex, and they're not all out there. What's out there already vindicate this, but we're going to put more out there
[2:20:33.280 --> 2:20:40.280]  Yeah, we're dumping all the raw footage tonight at Bandai Video. Ali, you're not hiding. You've been de-platformed everywhere. Come back tomorrow and join us
[2:20:40.280 --> 2:20:45.280]  Talk about what you've gone through at Bandai Everywhere. You're not hiding. We're trying to suppress you. Thank you so much

[2:20:53.280 --> 2:21:03.280]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects
[2:21:03.280 --> 2:21:13.280]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe
[2:21:13.280 --> 2:21:19.280]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little
[2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:24.280]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits

[2:22:45.280 --> 2:22:48.280]  The Post Industrial World
[2:22:48.280 --> 2:22:57.280]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992
[2:22:57.280 --> 2:23:03.280]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030 which is a Post Industrial World plows Schwab with the Davos Group
[2:23:03.280 --> 2:23:09.280]  Trudeau the Prime Minister of Canada they're all on record saying the great reset is Agenda 2030
[2:23:09.280 --> 2:23:13.280]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is
[2:23:13.280 --> 2:23:18.280]  It is the destruction of society as we know it, it is making the population poor
[2:23:18.280 --> 2:23:24.280]  By designs we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family
[2:23:24.280 --> 2:23:29.280]  They're destroying civilization, rebuild it and they're dystopic image
[2:23:29.280 --> 2:23:33.280]  We are fighting this at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com
[2:23:33.280 --> 2:23:40.280]  We are fighting for a pro-human future and we need you to get the facts, to research and share with others and join the fight
[2:23:40.280 --> 2:24:05.280]  God bless you, visit us, spread the word at InfoWars.com
[2:24:05.280 --> 2:24:11.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Alex Jones, I've been on air 27 years
[2:24:11.280 --> 2:24:14.280]  I don't usually use my full name but I'm Alexander Emmerich Jones
[2:24:14.280 --> 2:24:18.280]  This feels like an official day, something we ought to be putting on our tuxedos for
[2:24:18.280 --> 2:24:24.280]  I have never seen the republic in so much crisis, I have never seen the globalist moving like this
[2:24:24.280 --> 2:24:26.280]  I've never had more intel
[2:24:26.280 --> 2:24:32.280]  I talked to cabinet level people this morning, I made three phone calls called Trump Lawyers confirmed it
[2:24:32.280 --> 2:24:38.280]  Giuliani's telling Trump and Don Jr. that they have been indicted in the District of Columbia
[2:24:38.280 --> 2:24:45.280]  Now Giuliani thinks they're holding it to see if he resigns, but that is directly with household names that talk to Giuliani
[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:50.280]  Then I called Giuliani's, I'm gonna leave it at that, let's just say somebody very close to Giuliani
[2:24:50.280 --> 2:24:55.280]  And they confirmed it, I've been on air, I had a call from one of the individuals earlier, called him back, they didn't answer
[2:24:55.280 --> 2:24:57.280]  They talked to the president
[2:24:57.280 --> 2:25:01.280]  Trump is in Texas to tout his successes and the rest of it
[2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:06.280]  But ladies and gentlemen, look at these articles out of Yahoo News, this is the top of Yahoo
[2:25:06.280 --> 2:25:10.280]  Pence's chief of staff denied entry into White House, Trump blames me
[2:25:10.280 --> 2:25:18.280]  I was sent intel by Pentagon Patriots an hour ago, show the footage, they didn't tell me what to do with it
[2:25:18.280 --> 2:25:24.280]  They said, here's the footage of Pence arriving at the West Wing, go ahead and roll that footage guys, I sent it to you
[2:25:24.280 --> 2:25:32.280]  So, I told you, once they cut Trump off, they do a 25th Amendment because they're planning riots and Q-generated terrorism
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:40.280]  They claim Trump's running this weekend, that's why Trump's declared a civil emergency, secretly nationwide, publicly in DC, martial law
[2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:45.280]  Again, I was told, everybody always drops names, the highest level of the U.S. Army under Trump
[2:25:45.280 --> 2:25:52.280]  On Sunday, I'm on record that five governor's mansions have been attacked and that all sorts of violence has happened that's being covered up
[2:25:52.280 --> 2:25:58.280]  Because they want the governor to turn against Republicans and join Biden in martial law for gun confiscation
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:06.280]  Former Marine Corps Aviator and Officer, one of the top experts on the New World Order, led up the conservative coalition
[2:26:06.280 --> 2:26:09.280]  Is Joel Scousen of worldoffirstbrief.com, the internet chief
[2:26:09.280 --> 2:26:14.280]  Joel, you've heard my basic briefing to you and the world, this is beyond insane
[2:26:14.280 --> 2:26:19.280]  We've laid out the facts, what are we looking at right now in your expert view?
[2:26:19.280 --> 2:26:25.280]  Well, we are looking at an attempt to paint the Trump supporters as insurrectionists
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:32.280]  So that they can not only indict Trump for inciting insurrection, but to blackball the entire movement
[2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:40.280]  You know, they've done this for years in the deep state, the Oklahoma City bombing was a deep state false flag operation
[2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:46.280]  Using an Army guy who they claimed was a right wing, but he wasn't
[2:26:46.280 --> 2:27:00.280]  The only thing we have to be very careful of is that the movement is being swamped with disinformation experts now
[2:27:00.280 --> 2:27:11.280]  People telling them all kinds of things about military tribunals taking down the deep swamp and other things
[2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:16.280]  They'll just say, Q is telling everybody, which is US intelligence, the globalist side of the dark ads
[2:27:16.280 --> 2:27:22.280]  They're telling them the storm is here, the victory is here, now's the time to attack, that's the opposite, explain it to them
[2:27:22.280 --> 2:27:30.280]  Well, that's right, and it's, you know, we don't know who Q is, and he talks in cryptic sentences on the internet
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:38.280]  But I'm convinced that there's somebody else who perhaps General Flynn recognizes in former days in the military
[2:27:38.280 --> 2:27:45.280]  As well as General McNary who's talking to them and telling them that I'm a patriot, you know, there's a whole group in the White House
[2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:50.280]  Or in the intelligence and military services that are going to defend Donald Trump and put him back in the White House
[2:27:50.280 --> 2:27:57.280]  There's no other explanation for why General Flynn in the face of all that we know about the deep state would make a statement
[2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:03.280]  That there's 100% chance that Donald Trump's going to win this and he's not going to win it, and we know that already
[2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:09.280]  Well, I can tell you last Thursday when Trump made that speech, Flynn broke with him, and I'm going to leave it at that
[2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:12.280]  But Flynn is not buying that Q late now
[2:28:12.280 --> 2:28:18.280]  Yeah, I wish you'd ask him if you have contact with him, who was the contact, who told him, because it had to be somebody
[2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:21.280]  How about this, how about I just give you out of the show his number
[2:28:21.280 --> 2:28:29.280]  Yeah, I'd appreciate that, and I could talk to him, but in any case, what I'm worried about is that the movement is inflamed
[2:28:29.280 --> 2:28:33.280]  And when you're inflamed, you're subject to a lot of disinformation
[2:28:33.280 --> 2:28:39.280]  And these people, you know, are going to lead them to do some rash things that are going to get the movement black-balled
[2:28:39.280 --> 2:28:41.280]  It could be used to justify gun control
[2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:44.280]  Oh, this is Pied Piper leading the children to the river
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:49.280]  Yeah, indeed, and, you know, we have to be very careful
[2:28:49.280 --> 2:28:55.280]  I can't tell you how many emails I get now per day asking me people sending me a video and saying, is this true?
[2:28:55.280 --> 2:29:01.280]  And I look at it and it's just bogus, but what worries me is that people in a movement can't determine it for themselves
[2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:07.280]  Or are not trying to think about what's going on here and how they're being misled
[2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:12.280]  And so I think it's very, very crucial that people learn to think that, first of all, let me just lay out the evidence
[2:29:12.280 --> 2:29:20.280]  First of all, one of the videos says that clear back when JFK was assassinated that a group of military intel people decided
[2:29:20.280 --> 2:29:27.280]  That they were never going to let this happen again and that they're going to, you know, start to work undercover to drain the deep state
[2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:30.280]  It never happened, it never existed, this is a lie
[2:29:30.280 --> 2:29:37.280]  The deep state controlled military and US intelligence ever since the JFK assassination, they used it to cover up things
[2:29:37.280 --> 2:29:38.280]  The NSA supplies were useless
[2:29:38.280 --> 2:29:42.280]  A bunch of my family was in that, like, they all told me it was pure evil, just like you're saying
[2:29:42.280 --> 2:29:46.280]  They said the whole government's evil at the top, just what you're saying
[2:29:46.280 --> 2:29:53.280]  That's right, it is, that doesn't mean that there aren't guys on the white side within the FBI and the CIA and even the NSA
[2:29:53.280 --> 2:29:59.280]  Who do the actual gathering of evidence, but everyone at the authority level is compromised
[2:29:59.280 --> 2:30:02.280]  At the executive decision level they're sentenced
[2:30:02.280 --> 2:30:10.280]  Well, their deep state at least, now, I think only the very top level of people in the deep state know about the satanic connection
[2:30:10.280 --> 2:30:17.280]  And receive, you know, direct guidance as happens in all conspiracies throughout history, it's very real
[2:30:17.280 --> 2:30:22.280]  But there's a lot of yes men in there, there's a lot of people who fear for their lives, there's a lot of people who...
[2:30:22.280 --> 2:30:24.280]  Exactly, they do it through fear
[2:30:24.280 --> 2:30:28.280]  Yes, and they use it, remember there's this promise of immunity
[2:30:28.280 --> 2:30:33.280]  That's what drives the deep state, the promise that we will make all of your sins go away
[2:30:33.280 --> 2:30:38.280]  You won't be prosecuted unless you do something stupid that we can't cover up like Jeffrey Epstein
[2:30:38.280 --> 2:30:45.280]  But even then they may have, you know, exited him, there was this eyewitness sighting at the New Mexico Ranch
[2:30:45.280 --> 2:30:48.280]  Sure, exactly, that's probably a lot
[2:30:48.280 --> 2:30:55.280]  You know, you can't put anything past these deep state people, they have the power to control corners, to falsify death
[2:30:55.280 --> 2:31:00.280]  To say it's a suicide when it's a murderer, it just goes on and on
[2:31:00.280 --> 2:31:04.280]  Yeah, they're magicians of fraud, so we should expect that
[2:31:04.280 --> 2:31:08.280]  That's right, so this is a time to be very careful
[2:31:08.280 --> 2:31:15.280]  Now, I want to point out one thing about the Mal-Your federal takeover of the Mal-Your refugee area
[2:31:15.280 --> 2:31:20.280]  The mistake that those people made to allow anybody who claimed to be a patriot to come in there
[2:31:20.280 --> 2:31:27.280]  And they ended up allowing about eight FBI agent provocateurs to come in there to spy on them and other things
[2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:32.280]  And we're going to have to, I think, be very careful in future rallies for the movement
[2:31:32.280 --> 2:31:37.280]  That we just don't allow anyone to come in, especially people with backpacks who will come in there with weapons
[2:31:37.280 --> 2:31:41.280]  Well, anybody that starts to engage in violence has to be tackled
[2:31:41.280 --> 2:31:47.280]  That's right, but we're going to have to do our own disciplining, our own security at these rallies
[2:31:47.280 --> 2:31:54.280]  I know it's hard to do, but I think it only takes about two dozen security-minded people trained to search out and look for the signs
[2:31:54.280 --> 2:31:59.280]  And I totally agree, if I'd have got there 30 minutes later with my 20 security guys, we would have stopped that
[2:31:59.280 --> 2:32:06.280]  Yeah, and so, you know, we have video now of the big long sticks that they were usually to beat down police shields
[2:32:06.280 --> 2:32:08.280]  Those were being handed out from inside the Capitol
[2:32:08.280 --> 2:32:15.280]  It wasn't a policeman in there, but somebody from inside the Capitol was handing out these long rods for people to beat on the police with
[2:32:15.280 --> 2:32:26.280]  So there's a lot of investigation that has to be done here, but what I worry about in this congressional mania about trying to indict Trump for starting an insurrection
[2:32:26.280 --> 2:32:33.280]  Is that you can't have an honest investigation in Congress, or by the FBI, or the Department of Justice
[2:32:33.280 --> 2:32:41.280]  It's just all controlled, they've covered up the JFK assassination, they've covered up the 9-11 deep state, you know, loading of the building with explosives
[2:32:41.280 --> 2:32:45.280]  It just goes on and on, and that's why I'm-
[2:32:45.280 --> 2:32:50.280]  No, you're right, someone to come back in the next two segments with you and try to shut up, give me the floor, you're a smart guy
[2:32:50.280 --> 2:32:57.280]  What does Trump need to do? Because I can actually, I might even be able to talk to him, I have to try hard, I can call a hundred times, I might get through to him
[2:32:57.280 --> 2:33:03.280]  But I know some people that can talk to him, I know three people that are probably, one already talked to him today, with very limited messaging
[2:33:03.280 --> 2:33:06.280]  What would you say to Trump? What can he do?
[2:33:06.280 --> 2:33:13.280]  Joel Scowles of World of First Brief.com, entering chief there is our guest, really smart fellow, we respect his opinion
[2:33:13.280 --> 2:33:20.280]  infowars.com and newswars.com, and hey, I don't feel sorry for myself, I'm with God, I'm with justice, I feel very fulfilled right now
[2:33:20.280 --> 2:33:27.280]  World government's out in the open, everything we said's happening, I'm not happy it's happening, but I know Jesus is real, and I know my ancestors were real
[2:33:27.280 --> 2:33:33.280]  And they were good people, and I'm gonna stand with God, and that's what matters, I don't fear who can kill my body, but he who can kill my soul
[2:33:33.280 --> 2:33:38.280]  And so, but you better get yourself straight with God right now, folks, because this is pure evil versus good
[2:33:38.280 --> 2:33:43.280]  Alright, we'll be right back, just a few minutes with Joel Scowles, and stay with us
[2:34:08.280 --> 2:34:13.280]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life
[2:34:13.280 --> 2:34:19.280]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what, I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer
[2:34:19.280 --> 2:34:26.280]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend, I don't think that happens very often, it's never happened to me, I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy
[2:34:26.280 --> 2:34:31.280]  How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me
[2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:35.280]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I wanna take control of my life, I wanna take control of my health
[2:34:35.280 --> 2:34:39.280]  And that's why you need to go to Infowars.com, take control of your health right now and support the resistance
[2:34:39.280 --> 2:34:42.280]  Don't buy into the group, think, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the Turbo Force
[2:34:42.280 --> 2:35:05.280]  Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good
[2:35:12.280 --> 2:35:17.280]  You are being set up, I was there in DC with a million peaceful people
[2:35:17.280 --> 2:35:22.280]  And I watched Antifa and other leftist groups pose our people and set us up
[2:35:22.280 --> 2:35:29.280]  Thank God the Patriots did not engage in the rioting, so only a few people did it, so the thing was a misfire
[2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:34.280]  It was a dud, but the left is hungry to declare all Trump supporters terrorist
[2:35:34.280 --> 2:35:39.280]  And they're planning terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20th to blame the American people
[2:35:39.280 --> 2:35:44.280]  Do not be part of it, we are peaceful, we are not violent
[2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:14.280]  We couldn't get it, now a limited supply is back in stock, 25% off at Infowars.com
[2:36:14.280 --> 2:36:20.280]  Hollenblock again is available in this one minute ad, I don't have time to tell you all about it
[2:36:20.280 --> 2:36:26.280]  But believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally, unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter
[2:36:26.280 --> 2:36:30.280]  That makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache
[2:36:30.280 --> 2:36:35.280]  This is naturally occurring, it's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress
[2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:41.280]  It's passed on somehow through their eggs to us, you chew up the pills, they taste great, it's available again
[2:36:41.280 --> 2:37:07.280]  InfowarsStore.com, Hollenblock, InfowarsStore.com
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:15.280]  All of us we've launched have been banned, that's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it
[2:37:15.280 --> 2:37:22.280]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the Globlers are on our tail, but the new website is
[2:37:22.280 --> 2:37:26.280]  TheResistance.video, TheResistance.video
[2:37:26.280 --> 2:37:30.280]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:38.280]  So the new URL that links right to banned.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information
[2:37:38.280 --> 2:37:41.280]  Is that TheResistance.video? Share the link
[2:37:41.280 --> 2:38:03.280]  TheResistance.video, TheResistance.video
[2:38:03.280 --> 2:38:11.280]  Joe Scalzen is our guest, worldfirstbrief.com, he just asked me, he said listen
[2:38:11.280 --> 2:38:18.280]  That's right, he was just asking me, hey are you part of this, the new video or this is a deep fake of you
[2:38:18.280 --> 2:38:24.280]  It's modern stuff that just happened last week, you have no beard, it's you and I said no I haven't seen it, but it's bad folks
[2:38:24.280 --> 2:38:30.280]  They have sound boards where they call people and hit these buttons of what I've said together to make sentences
[2:38:30.280 --> 2:38:37.280]  That's been going on for 20 years, but now they've got, Adobe came out a few years with it where you can have a minute of somebody's voice
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:44.280]  And then you can program a computer to fool voice print and then Adobe pulled it off the market, but thousands were sold
[2:38:44.280 --> 2:38:51.280]  And so yeah, they've got me saying horrible things about black people, horrible things about Jews, horrible things about everybody
[2:38:51.280 --> 2:38:59.280]  It's not me, but Joel you were talking about now we're going to see all those secret weapons rolled out, we're going to, because you were bringing this up to me
[2:38:59.280 --> 2:39:04.280]  That's right, I was concerned, you know somebody sent me the video to attack me and saying why are you on this guy's show
[2:39:04.280 --> 2:39:11.280]  Because he's obviously, you know, doesn't have the moral values that you represent and I said well that's not Alex Jones, he doesn't have a beard on
[2:39:11.280 --> 2:39:19.280]  And I caught it immediately that this was a deep fake and, but it was disturbing and it's going to influence a lot of people
[2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:26.280]  I'll send it to you at some time when I find it during the break so that you can analyze it, but we have to be prepared for all kinds of dirty tricks
[2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:34.280]  It's, you know, when you look at what they did to Parley, you know, and taking it off them, not only the Google and Apple Store, but then Amazon take it
[2:39:34.280 --> 2:39:42.280]  You know, it's very difficult for a big organization running a Twitter-like feed to run, you know, it takes hundreds and hundreds of servers
[2:39:42.280 --> 2:39:50.280]  And there's only two or three or four companies that have the server capacity to run someone like that, so when you take them off the air, it becomes very difficult
[2:39:50.280 --> 2:39:56.280]  Exactly, Parler's taken off, Trump's losing his bank accounts, this is insanely dangerous
[2:39:56.280 --> 2:40:03.280]  And that's why they're moving to a digital currency too, once you get into everything is sold by credit cards and everything is done through a digital currency
[2:40:03.280 --> 2:40:11.280]  And there's no backup with cash, it's going to be very difficult to handle life when they shut down your account and say that you're an insurrectionist
[2:40:11.280 --> 2:40:17.280]  I totally agree, but in the interest of truth, because I'm trying to scan my mind, I want to get into Trump and the world and Marshall Law and all the rest of it
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:25.280]  I'm a sinner, I've been through a lot of stress, in 27 years on air, probably 10 times I flipped out late at night when I was drinking or I was angry
[2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:33.280]  One night my dog died, it had an aneurysm, blood was spraying out of his face, I came up after it died, I blew up on air and Custon yelled
[2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:39.280]  But there's nothing modern, I haven't done that in a long time, so if that's out there, I repent, nobody's perfect except Jesus Christ
[2:40:39.280 --> 2:40:46.280]  But no, I've not done anything in a long time like that, so that sounds like a deep fake or edits of something I've done together that are exaggerated
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:53.280]  But Joel, moving on from Alex Jones, I don't control the currency, I don't control the markets, they're celebrating G.G. Payne crushing America
[2:40:53.280 --> 2:41:03.280]  They're celebrating the takeover, they're celebrating what they're about to do, what would your advice be to President Trump in the, you know, less than 200 hours he's got left or whatever
[2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:06.280]  What would you do if you were President Trump?
[2:41:06.280 --> 2:41:23.280]  Well, that's hard to say, you know, I've always said as a few weeks ago, right after the election, he needed to sequester the Dominion machines, he needed to sequester the ballots, not take possession but make sure that they were guarded at the federal facilities so that they could be audited by independent non-state people
[2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:31.280]  Now, Rand Paul made a major mistake in the Senate when he said, you know, this is a matter of states' rights, the elections are totally under the control of the states
[2:41:31.280 --> 2:41:42.280]  But when there is fraud, and you're talking about a federal election, the federal government has the power, the president has the power to use emergency powers to intervene and at least sequester this
[2:41:42.280 --> 2:41:45.280]  Because the two sides under the federal system check each other
[2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:52.280]  That's right, that's right, the powers are there, the powers aren't illegitimate, if the public thinks they're right, then it's a political decision
[2:41:52.280 --> 2:42:09.280]  So there has to be a check and a balance against state fraud and the courts are not acting as a check and a balance and so the federal government has the power, I think, to go in not to take over but to sequester them so that they cannot be, you know, damaged
[2:42:09.280 --> 2:42:16.280]  For example, there's video of a truck moving into the Fulton warehouse where all the phony ballots are and hauling away ballot boxes
[2:42:16.280 --> 2:42:19.280]  And I think they're hauling away the ones that were in the fraud
[2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:28.280]  They have the USPS drivers that they opened it up and it's all perfectly crisp Scantron printed ballots out of from another state, totally proof
[2:42:28.280 --> 2:42:29.280]  That's right
[2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:40.280]  Now, I don't think there really is anything that Trump can do because he's been totally paralyzed by this false flag operation at the Capitol
[2:42:40.280 --> 2:42:50.280]  And as I've said on your show before, you know, unfortunately, there were a lot of Trump people that got caught up in the moment and started entering the Capitol floor and entering and doing things
[2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:54.280]  But they were led by agent provocateurs and those provocateurs got away
[2:42:54.280 --> 2:42:58.280]  If any of them were arrested, they will have been released by now, we'll never know
[2:42:58.280 --> 2:43:04.280]  And I totally agree, Trump, and we'll hold you over a little bit, Trump is paralyzed by the false flag unless he repudiates the false flag
[2:43:04.280 --> 2:43:12.280]  We're not going to lie to the audience. What about the augmented reality Q-Force that I've now talked to people in the White House are really worried about
[2:43:12.280 --> 2:43:17.280]  They're saying go out and attack the capitals. I had this from the FBI and Capitol Police on Sunday
[2:43:17.280 --> 2:43:25.280]  It's now confirmed today that their Q is telling people to attack all these capitals. That is so obviously a setup
[2:43:25.280 --> 2:43:37.280]  That's right. And I think that Trump has to cancel any rallies on January 20th or anyone else keep people away from the Capitol. They're just going to make things worse by infiltration
[2:43:37.280 --> 2:43:45.280]  And so he's really just got to go graciously out of office and while we regroup and try to fight this
[2:43:45.280 --> 2:43:52.280]  And as I say, the big thing is if we're ever going to regain any liberty in this country, we've got to have a larger majority than what we have
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:44:01.280]  We have a substantial, an 80 million minority and it's not enough to out vote with voting fraud unless we get a lot more votes through
[2:44:01.280 --> 2:44:07.280]  We have to explain that. That's what you write about. It's what you do, strategic relocation, the books we sell them for are store.com
[2:44:07.280 --> 2:44:15.280]  It's about culturally, historically, physically coming out of Babylon. We have to physically remove ourselves. That's the only power we have
[2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:25.280]  That's right. We have to prepare at the same time that we fight this battle, the same time we try to keep waking people up and the issue has to be conspiracy
[2:44:25.280 --> 2:44:33.280]  You have to talk about the conspiracy of election fraud, the conspiracy to date Donald Trump, the conspiracy of false leg operations
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:42.280]  You know, that's how I tell whether someone's been in deep state. Were they involved in the cover-up of the JFK assassination? Were they involved in the cover-up of TWA 800 or Oklahoma City Barney?
[2:44:42.280 --> 2:44:46.280]  Millenials. They just keep, were boarding themselves
[2:44:46.280 --> 2:44:54.280]  That's right. And they keep covering for themselves. I mean, you look at Brett Kavanaugh, who was part of the deep state and covering up for the Vince Foster murder
[2:44:54.280 --> 2:45:01.280]  And they feed his name to Donald Trump. He won't be a reliable conservative. You know, he's not going to be as obvious as John Roberts
[2:45:01.280 --> 2:45:08.280]  We've got to really wake up our people to the sophistication of what we're dealing with and how we have to be a lot smarter
[2:45:08.280 --> 2:45:13.280]  You know, you say nobody's perfect, but I'll tell you, Alex, we've got to be a lot more perfect than we are
[2:45:13.280 --> 2:45:20.280]  We've got to get healthy. We've got to get healthy so that we're not subject to these pandemics, which are going to continue
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:26.280]  And we've got to have strategy sessions for everybody to debate how we pull ourselves out of this and get our families involved
[2:45:26.280 --> 2:45:32.280]  Because I've looked at this from every angle on it. You told me 10 years ago, Jones, you can't fix this. It's biblical. You're going to have to have it
[2:45:32.280 --> 2:45:39.280]  And I agree with you now. I thought we could fix it. We have got to pull out. The only thing to do is build our own communities now
[2:45:39.280 --> 2:45:41.280]  It's got to happen now. We cannot wait
[2:45:41.280 --> 2:45:50.280]  That's right. And that's what strategic relocation is all about, getting to conservative based safe places because these places are going to grow during the next war
[2:45:50.280 --> 2:45:58.280]  When there's a nuclear attack on US military targets preceded by an EMP strike, there's going to be mass social unrest in all the major cities
[2:45:58.280 --> 2:46:06.280]  And the good people are going to flee. The good people are going to come to areas that I talk about as strategic relocation that are conservative based
[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:09.280]  Where we can have new majorities in order to build those majorities
[2:46:09.280 --> 2:46:14.280]  Tell me right now the best place for me to move that has telecommunications for us to move. Where should I move?
[2:46:14.280 --> 2:46:17.280]  Well, that's, there is no
[2:46:17.280 --> 2:46:23.280]  I'm ready to do it. I mean, I realize I can't wait anymore. Every cell tells me get out of Austin
[2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:33.280]  Yeah, you have to get out of Austin. There are safer places in Texas where you can still operate, but I really think the Intermountain West is the safest place long term
[2:46:33.280 --> 2:46:45.280]  So where's the sweet spot the Intermountain West? I think I almost don't want to say the name, but if you had to live anywhere for what I'm trying to do and run a telecommunications operation, where's the sweet spot the Intermountain West?
[2:46:45.280 --> 2:46:48.280]  Well, I'll have to think about that, Alex, because
[2:46:48.280 --> 2:46:52.280]  Give me the top five. Give me a few good ones
[2:46:52.280 --> 2:46:56.280]  Well, I would say they would be in
[2:46:56.280 --> 2:46:58.280]  In the Boise area
[2:46:58.280 --> 2:47:00.280]  Or in northern Idaho
[2:47:00.280 --> 2:47:03.280]  Or in Utah County
[2:47:03.280 --> 2:47:05.280]  Or in St. George, Utah
[2:47:05.280 --> 2:47:07.280]  The southernmost city, which is
[2:47:07.280 --> 2:47:11.280]  You know, kind of a warm climate area for the
[2:47:11.280 --> 2:47:20.280]  But those are the areas that have the technology, that they have the base, they have the people base, they're in safe areas that won't get shut down
[2:47:20.280 --> 2:47:24.280]  Pretty good legal systems
[2:47:24.280 --> 2:47:32.280]  You have to stay away from Arizona, Colorado, because they're going to be blue states, and even Texas, I believe is going to be a blue state within the next election or so
[2:47:32.280 --> 2:47:34.280]  I agree, I agree, all right
[2:47:34.280 --> 2:47:40.280]  A lot of Californians are moving into Texas, which is unfortunate, they're going to bring their liberal attitudes with them
[2:47:40.280 --> 2:47:46.280]  All right, Trump's set to speak, we'll do five more minutes with Joel Scalson on the other side, and then we'll have Trump take over
[2:47:46.280 --> 2:47:54.280]  And we'll talk about if Trump, customarily, is 10, 15 minutes late, we'll get Joel Scalson's take on what Biden's going to do
[2:47:54.280 --> 2:48:01.280]  I'm just so sick, but you know, we killed all those babies, folks, we joined Satan, I mean, not all of us did consciously, but we let it happen
[2:48:01.280 --> 2:48:08.280]  So we're about to be judged, ladies and gentlemen, no mistake, God gives us free will, Satan does not, by the way
[2:48:08.280 --> 2:48:14.280]  And so we have free will to join Satan, and we did it, and now we are about to get really screwed over
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:21.280]  I appreciate all your financial support, you got storeable foods, prices go up in just a few days, infowarstore.com, prayerwithalex.com
[2:48:21.280 --> 2:48:27.280]  Got a lot of great supplements at infowarstore.com, and get a t-shirt, get a book, I don't know if they'll be here next week, seriously
[2:48:27.280 --> 2:48:32.280]  I never lie to you, folks, I mean, it's bad, they're breathing down our neck, okay, we'll be right back
[2:48:34.280 --> 2:48:37.280]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado, thank you for holding
[2:48:37.280 --> 2:48:38.280]  How you doing, Alex?
[2:48:38.280 --> 2:48:42.280]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can, we're in such a critical time, brother, how are you?
[2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:52.280]  I love you, man, I want to make a quick plug, that DNA force, I love it, I've been using it quite a while, and I just went, looked at the ingredients again the other day
[2:48:52.280 --> 2:49:04.280]  And I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkala has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine
[2:49:04.280 --> 2:49:09.280]  And it helps channel the zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:20.280]  All I know is with DNA force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle
[2:49:20.280 --> 2:49:28.280]  Because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks, and so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this
[2:49:28.280 --> 2:49:30.280]  So thanks, thanks for the plug
[2:49:30.280 --> 2:49:38.280]  The Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism
[2:49:38.280 --> 2:49:41.280]  Other dictionaries have similar ones
[2:49:41.280 --> 2:49:48.280]  Terrorism is the threat of force, or actually carrying out force, for a political or financial reason
[2:49:48.280 --> 2:49:52.280]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them
[2:49:52.280 --> 2:49:56.280]  And that's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:50:01.280]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:03.280]  COVID more dumbest thing they could ever imagine
[2:50:03.280 --> 2:50:10.280]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months
[2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:15.280]  Okay, it's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:20.280]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity, these are real numbers, these are real facts
[2:50:20.280 --> 2:50:25.280]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out, and are taught we're not essential
[2:50:25.280 --> 2:50:28.280]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet
[2:50:28.280 --> 2:50:31.280]  You could stand up against it, this is slavery
[2:50:31.280 --> 2:50:34.280]  It is not something you could put up with and survive
[2:50:34.280 --> 2:50:55.280]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show
[2:51:04.280 --> 2:51:13.280]  Question the fraud, as the one-party state takes over, what can Trump do in the twilight of his 200 hours in power?
[2:51:13.280 --> 2:51:21.280]  Well, as we talked about before, I don't really think there's anything to do because anything he tries to do will be poison in terms of the media
[2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:27.280]  But he can cancel any rallies to make sure that they cannot continue to push this insurrection
[2:51:27.280 --> 2:51:33.280]  Because believe me, they will turn it to be violent if he ever has another rally again here
[2:51:33.280 --> 2:51:40.280]  Now, I'm not sure he should try pardoning himself, it probably wouldn't hurt, it's never been done before
[2:51:40.280 --> 2:51:46.280]  But clearly they're going to indict him for insurrection and try to put him in jail
[2:51:46.280 --> 2:51:53.280]  They want him impeached because they want to add to that impeachment a total ban on any running for federal office again
[2:51:53.280 --> 2:51:55.280]  That's what they're headed for
[2:51:55.280 --> 2:52:01.280]  And I don't think they're going to be able to do it unless Mitch McConnell, who is a globalist, he could betray Trump
[2:52:01.280 --> 2:52:07.280]  But he's got the power to stop that impeachment from coming to a vote within this time frame without hearings
[2:52:07.280 --> 2:52:11.280]  He can draw out the hearings and make it go away
[2:52:11.280 --> 2:52:19.280]  So it's all up to Mitch McConnell right now, after that, you know, in the Biden administration, they've got control of both houses of Congress and the presidency
[2:52:19.280 --> 2:52:27.280]  The only thing that can stop anything at all now will be the...
[2:52:27.280 --> 2:52:36.280]  Well, you'd have the two-thirds majority that has to vote for major things
[2:52:36.280 --> 2:52:39.280]  It just slipped my mind now
[2:52:39.280 --> 2:52:43.280]  There's parliamentary systems that could block this
[2:52:43.280 --> 2:52:44.280]  Well, that's right
[2:52:44.280 --> 2:52:48.280]  You're not supposed to know every rule that even the sergeant in arms doesn't know, so yeah
[2:52:48.280 --> 2:52:52.280]  Or the Senate leader, yeah, it's all Byzantine, it's all insane
[2:52:52.280 --> 2:52:59.280]  There are procedures to stop this, but do you think Trump realizes how much danger he's in?
[2:52:59.280 --> 2:53:02.280]  I think he does, I think he realizes that...
[2:53:02.280 --> 2:53:06.280]  But I think he's very discouraged, I think he's lost heart over this
[2:53:06.280 --> 2:53:15.280]  And, I mean, he made a mistake in talking to McCarthy who's not on his side by telling him he'd accept some responsibility for the violence in the Capitol
[2:53:15.280 --> 2:53:19.280]  He should never have said that because there really wasn't anything wrong with what he said
[2:53:19.280 --> 2:53:23.280]  It certainly wasn't any more volatile than anything else he'd ever said
[2:53:23.280 --> 2:53:28.280]  No, you're right, he made an admission of guilt, that's when they de-platformed him
[2:53:28.280 --> 2:53:29.280]  That's right
[2:53:29.280 --> 2:53:39.280]  And of course, you know, it's so totally hypocritical because all the BLM and Tifa riots, you know, which were provoked by the media and given full carte blanche
[2:53:39.280 --> 2:53:44.280]  Those have never been condemned and they haven't prosecuted any of them for insurrection
[2:53:44.280 --> 2:53:51.280]  And they never run an investigation on who's financing BLM and on Tifa, and it would lead right back to George Soros and other globalists
[2:53:51.280 --> 2:54:02.280]  So this is a very, very bad situation for the president, I really think there's nothing he can do except to be very moderate, very mild and go out of office to try to keep them from poisoning his supporters
[2:54:02.280 --> 2:54:04.280]  Because that's who they're after now, they're after us
[2:54:04.280 --> 2:54:12.280]  He's trying to stop people being manipulated into Q violence this weekend, but the word is there are a lot of people believing this Q stuff that are planning violence
[2:54:12.280 --> 2:54:14.280]  It's so dangerous
[2:54:14.280 --> 2:54:24.280]  Well, that's why it's very, very important for Sidney Pound, Linwood has been really the subject of a lot of disinformation, and General Flynn and General McHugh
[2:54:24.280 --> 2:54:27.280]  I agree, whether he's better or good, Linwood needs to knock it off
[2:54:27.280 --> 2:54:32.280]  I mean, he's put out the worst stuff I've ever seen and it's just, he oughta know better
[2:54:32.280 --> 2:54:36.280]  I'm worried because he was a Democratic contributor before that he might be applying
[2:54:36.280 --> 2:54:40.280]  By the way, he's still on Twitter, isn't he? What I'm saying is he's allowed to say all this?
[2:54:40.280 --> 2:54:45.280]  Yeah, and that's a bad, that's a sign that we may not be able to trust this going on
[2:54:45.280 --> 2:54:48.280]  I don't trust Jenna Ellis in his legal team
[2:54:48.280 --> 2:54:52.280]  I know you may be friends with Rudy Giuliani, but he was deep state in 9-11
[2:54:52.280 --> 2:54:58.280]  Oh no, not friends with Giuliani, I know, I mean, friends with him like I'm friends with a frickin' rattlesnake
[2:54:58.280 --> 2:55:00.280]  Yeah, yeah
[2:55:00.280 --> 2:55:11.280]  Well, he has sabotaged the Trump's legal case, and you know, Trump just doesn't have the judgment on who to pick, who to surround himself with
[2:55:11.280 --> 2:55:17.280]  to keep himself from being manipulated, and you know, he has a good heart, but we need a new champion
[2:55:17.280 --> 2:55:27.280]  and I don't know who that is right now, I don't necessarily trust Ted Cruz, he can certainly fight, but he's disappointed us before
[2:55:27.280 --> 2:55:30.280]  Yeah, he still has that knowledge of evil
[2:55:30.280 --> 2:55:32.280]  Alright, Joe Scowson, thank you so much
[2:55:32.280 --> 2:55:35.280]  We're all fallin' folks, we're all the knowledge of evil
[2:55:35.280 --> 2:55:58.280]  We act on that knowledge of the redback series
[2:56:05.280 --> 2:56:34.280]  Well, we've only got a few days left to get 20-20 prices before the prices go up on high quality storeable food with huge discounts as big as 850 dollars
[2:56:34.280 --> 2:56:38.280]  Discount on a year's supply of food at infoorstore.com
[2:56:38.280 --> 2:57:05.280]  So take advantage of these sales right now at infoorstore.com where you still can
[2:57:05.280 --> 2:57:19.280]  We're watching the control and implosion of the United States of America
[2:57:19.280 --> 2:57:23.280]  You can talk about, oh, Trump should have done this, Trump should have done that
[2:57:23.280 --> 2:57:27.280]  The globalists want him gone, the globalists want the destruction of the country
[2:57:27.280 --> 2:57:37.280]  So there's all these moralizing people out there like Ann Coulter and others that say, oh, Trump could have done a better job, but then they literally side with the globalists to take over the country
[2:57:37.280 --> 2:57:42.280]  These are opportunists, these are people that have sold out, who act holier than now
[2:57:42.280 --> 2:57:46.280]  Trump fought hard for our republic
[2:57:46.280 --> 2:57:54.280]  And as soon as he gets up to speak, we will show you what he has to say
[2:57:54.280 --> 2:57:58.280]  We thank God for Trump, we thank God for you, and we've only begun to fight
[2:57:58.280 --> 2:58:04.280]  You didn't think we'd elect a president and battle the globalists back to the edge of a cliff and not have them push back
[2:58:04.280 --> 2:58:10.280]  This is a sword fight, we are in the battle
[2:58:10.280 --> 2:58:13.280]  And so that's the crucible
[2:58:13.280 --> 2:58:19.280]  You don't think you get your arm cut off for a couple seconds, you don't get superpower to take the enemy out
[2:58:19.280 --> 2:58:22.280]  Enemy hacks your arm off, that's when you get them
[2:58:22.280 --> 2:58:32.280]  It's in that moment that you've already been stabbed to death, that you go, you want war, you get it spiritually
[2:58:32.280 --> 2:58:35.280]  That's where we are now, I've never felt closer to God
[2:58:35.280 --> 2:58:40.280]  People say, man, things are bad, America's falling, why are you so excited?
[2:58:40.280 --> 2:58:45.280]  Because the enemy is out in the open now, and I believe in you
[2:58:45.280 --> 2:58:48.280]  Go commercial free, as I said before the show
[2:58:48.280 --> 2:58:53.280]  Now some stations will cut away, we fire tones, computer programs on the satellites
[2:58:53.280 --> 2:58:57.280]  So they'll cut away, the stations aren't editing us, the stations aren't censoring us
[2:58:57.280 --> 2:59:00.280]  They've got to run those ads, those are paid, they have to run them, they're wonderful
[2:59:00.280 --> 2:59:03.280]  We love our affiliates, TV and radio
[2:59:03.280 --> 2:59:09.280]  Wouldn't be on here without them, but I'm saying commercial free on the infowars.com, the newswars.com, the band.video streams
[2:59:09.280 --> 2:59:12.280]  We are commercial free, now
[2:59:12.280 --> 2:59:14.280]  We are commercial free
[2:59:14.280 --> 2:59:19.280]  Everybody's getting ready for the president, he's not perfect, but he's our president, he's an American
[2:59:19.280 --> 2:59:24.280]  Probably the last president you'll see before the return of Christ
[2:59:24.280 --> 2:59:27.280]  Because God gives you an example of what to do right before the fall
[2:59:27.280 --> 2:59:30.280]  Like, this is what you could have had
[2:59:30.280 --> 2:59:34.280]  And if we'd have gone with this, we could have turned it all around, but we were too weak
[2:59:34.280 --> 2:59:39.280]  And now it's Mark of the Beast, forced inoculation, world government, pedophile rings coming to your house
[2:59:39.280 --> 2:59:44.280]  Social credit scores, you let a pedophile rape your child, get a year bonus in your bank account
[2:59:44.280 --> 2:59:48.280]  Next time it's like a week's bonus, next time it's a teesburger, next time it's one fry
[2:59:48.280 --> 2:59:51.280]  Like, let me rape your kid ten times, you get a box of fries
[2:59:51.280 --> 2:59:55.280]  First it's a million bucks, then it's a box of fries, then it's one fry
[2:59:55.280 --> 2:59:58.280]  Then it's, I'm not going to kill you unless you let me rape your child
[2:59:58.280 --> 3:00:05.280]  It's all about the children, because they are the potential of the universe with God's stamp on them
[3:00:05.280 --> 3:00:10.280]  So we're going to skip these breaks, I want to air this important report, we haven't aired yet
[3:00:10.280 --> 3:00:12.280]  And as soon as Trump comes on, we'll go to him
[3:00:16.280 --> 3:00:17.280]  Shall we, go ahead
[3:00:17.280 --> 3:00:20.280]  Oh, Trump's speaking, let's get ready, go ahead and go to President Trump
[3:00:20.280 --> 3:00:24.280]  Right now, commercial free, from Texas, here it is, Alamo, Texas
[3:00:27.280 --> 3:00:29.280]  There's a lot to still on that
[3:00:29.280 --> 3:00:33.280]  Thank you very much, thank you everybody, great honor to be here, we work long and hard
[3:00:33.280 --> 3:00:37.280]  Please sit down, we've worked long and hard to get this done
[3:00:37.280 --> 3:00:44.280]  They said it couldn't be done, and we got it done, one of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of our country
[3:00:44.280 --> 3:00:53.280]  I'm honored to be here in the Rio Grande Valley, with the courageous men and women of customs and border patrol
[3:00:53.280 --> 3:00:57.280]  These people are incredible, they're really incredible
[3:00:57.280 --> 3:01:00.280]  I've gotten to know you very well over the last four years
[3:01:00.280 --> 3:01:05.280]  Many of you are friends from all of the work we did in designing the wall
[3:01:05.280 --> 3:01:11.280]  We got it exactly as you wanted it, everything, including your protective plate on top
[3:01:11.280 --> 3:01:16.280]  I say, why did we put that, and they said we needed it for extra protection, climb plate
[3:01:16.280 --> 3:01:22.280]  And we have everything you want, it's steel, it's concrete inside the steel, and then it's rebar
[3:01:22.280 --> 3:01:28.280]  A lot of heavy rebar inside the concrete, and it's as strong as you're going to get and strong as you can have
[3:01:28.280 --> 3:01:32.280]  But we gave you 100% of what you wanted, so now you have no excuses
[3:01:32.280 --> 3:01:35.280]  I didn't want you to have any excuses
[3:01:35.280 --> 3:01:43.280]  And you set records, and we can't let the next administration even think about taking it down, if you can believe that
[3:01:43.280 --> 3:01:50.280]  I don't think that will happen, I think when you see what it does and how it's so important for our country
[3:01:50.280 --> 3:01:57.280]  Nobody's going to be touching it, and you are very proud of it, and you're proud of the work you did, because we really designed it together
[3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:06.280]  We're joined together to celebrate a great achievement, the extraordinarily successful building of the wall on the southern border
[3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:12.280]  Before we begin, I'd like to say that free speech is under assault, like never before
[3:02:12.280 --> 3:02:22.280]  The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me, but we'll come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration as the expression goes
[3:02:22.280 --> 3:02:32.280]  Be careful what you wish for, the impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country
[3:02:32.280 --> 3:02:39.280]  And it's causing tremendous anger and division and pain, far greater than most people will ever understand
[3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:45.280]  Which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time
[3:02:45.280 --> 3:02:55.280]  And now I'd like to briefly address the events of last week, millions of our citizens watched on Wednesday as a mob stormed the capital and trash
[3:02:55.280 --> 3:03:05.280]  The halls of government, as I have consistently said throughout my administration, we believe in respecting America's history and traditions
[3:03:05.280 --> 3:03:12.280]  Not tearing them down, we believe in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting
[3:03:12.280 --> 3:03:17.280]  Because of the pandemic, horrible, horrible, invisible enemy
[3:03:17.280 --> 3:03:26.280]  And despite our tremendous success, developing a vaccine years before, it was thought evenly, remotely possible
[3:03:26.280 --> 3:03:31.280]  Nobody thought it was going to be possible, they said it would take five years, sir, it will take seven years
[3:03:31.280 --> 3:03:38.280]  All of our scientists were saying, our advisors, it will take seven years, five years, ten years maybe
[3:03:38.280 --> 3:03:45.280]  Well, we did it just like I said we would, we had it out years and years before they thought it was possible
[3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:55.280]  And we're now delivering it to states, including your state, where your governor and government are doing a terrific job in getting it administered in Texas
[3:03:55.280 --> 3:04:01.280]  And Florida's doing great, some of them are doing great, some aren't doing as well, but they have all they can handle
[3:04:01.280 --> 3:04:05.280]  And we get it to them as fast as they need it, and even faster
[3:04:05.280 --> 3:04:12.280]  But they're calling it a medical miracle, and this has been a difficult year and a very difficult election
[3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:19.280]  The pandemic has made it a very, very difficult year for our country and virtually every country all over the world
[3:04:19.280 --> 3:04:26.280]  Now is the time for our nation to heal, and it's time for peace and for calm
[3:04:26.280 --> 3:04:33.280]  Now folks, here's the key, I've got Fox News, CNN on the control room, no coverage of the U.S. president's speech
[3:04:33.280 --> 3:04:40.280]  Show Fox News, it's the FBI on the riot that says the white supremacists and Christians are the big threat
[3:04:40.280 --> 3:04:50.280]  They're not showing, they're showing this dude not talking instead of the president calling for unity because they want to blow stuff up this weekend and blame Trump
[3:04:50.280 --> 3:04:57.280]  Wow, remember that, that's why Bandot videos here, that's why I'm FullWars.com is here, let's go back to the president
[3:04:57.280 --> 3:05:05.280]  You do, and you are, I want to thank Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgan
[3:05:05.280 --> 3:05:07.280]  Total cutoff, total marks a lot
[3:05:07.280 --> 3:05:11.280]  Incredible, where's Mark? Mark, stand up Mark, great job
[3:05:11.280 --> 3:05:13.280]  Wow, this is a total drill to take over
[3:05:13.280 --> 3:05:17.280]  Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings, Brian, thank you very much
[3:05:17.280 --> 3:05:21.280]  Guys, check all the channels, we're going to skip this network break, some stations may break the lines
[3:05:21.280 --> 3:05:28.280]  Guys, show people, every channel, no problem, the president's speaking, no coverage, total control
[3:05:28.280 --> 3:05:30.280]  Protect our families and our country
[3:05:30.280 --> 3:05:31.280]  Wow
[3:05:31.280 --> 3:05:35.280]  I also want to thank a tremendous gentleman, a friend of mine, Tom Holman
[3:05:35.280 --> 3:05:38.280]  They don't want him calling for peace, he's made American peace on H&M
[3:05:38.280 --> 3:05:41.280]  They're commanding you to attack
[3:05:41.280 --> 3:05:47.280]  He knew exactly, he said we need a wall, when they were saying no, no, we need drones, we need drones
[3:05:47.280 --> 3:05:51.280]  I said why, so you can watch the people pour into our country illegally
[3:05:51.280 --> 3:05:53.280]  And I want to thank you very much
[3:05:53.280 --> 3:05:56.280]  Unprecedented, his bank accounts taking him silent
[3:05:56.280 --> 3:05:58.280]  And MSN will not sell the president
[3:05:58.280 --> 3:06:02.280]  Wow, we're here at Band-Aid video, you can share it on email
[3:06:02.280 --> 3:06:06.280]  When I took office, we had a broken dysfunctional and open border
[3:06:06.280 --> 3:06:09.280]  See President Trump censored speech, back to him
[3:06:09.280 --> 3:06:12.280]  See President Trump censored border speech
[3:06:12.280 --> 3:06:18.280]  Great outdoor space, looking at our wall, we reformed our immigration system
[3:06:18.280 --> 3:06:22.280]  And achieved the most secure southern border in U.S. history
[3:06:22.280 --> 3:06:26.280]  It is at a level that it's never been before
[3:06:26.280 --> 3:06:31.280]  We took on the cartels, the coyotes, and the special interests
[3:06:31.280 --> 3:06:34.280]  And we restored the rule of law
[3:06:34.280 --> 3:06:40.280]  For years, politicians ran for office, promising to secure the border only to get elected
[3:06:40.280 --> 3:06:43.280]  And to do the absolute exact opposite
[3:06:43.280 --> 3:06:46.280]  They even promised a wall, if you remember
[3:06:46.280 --> 3:06:50.280]  About 10 years ago, they promised a wall, but they couldn't get it built
[3:06:50.280 --> 3:06:52.280]  It wasn't easy getting it built
[3:06:52.280 --> 3:06:56.280]  Getting it financed was tough, getting it built was even tougher
[3:06:56.280 --> 3:07:00.280]  All the different chains of title, all the different things we had to go through
[3:07:00.280 --> 3:07:03.280]  Very, very complex and very difficult, but we got it done
[3:07:03.280 --> 3:07:08.280]  But they had it years ago, you remember that better than anybody, right?
[3:07:08.280 --> 3:07:10.280]  And they never got it done
[3:07:10.280 --> 3:07:14.280]  They never, ever completed the task
[3:07:14.280 --> 3:07:18.280]  And then ultimately the money was sent back to the federal government
[3:07:18.280 --> 3:07:21.280]  Spent, but no wall was built
[3:07:21.280 --> 3:07:26.280]  But unlike those who came before me, I kept my promises
[3:07:26.280 --> 3:07:29.280]  And today we celebrate an extraordinary milestone
[3:07:29.280 --> 3:07:34.280]  The completion of the promised 450 miles of border wall
[3:07:34.280 --> 3:07:35.280]  450 miles
[3:07:35.280 --> 3:07:41.280]  This is blackout on all US TV, Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, CNN, ABC
[3:07:41.280 --> 3:07:45.280]  But on right side broadcasting, almost 700,000 viewers
[3:07:45.280 --> 3:07:48.280]  We have over 700,000 viewers, funny similar number
[3:07:48.280 --> 3:07:51.280]  Just on our streams right now, we have about 700,000 watching
[3:07:51.280 --> 3:07:53.280]  That's separate, that's another group
[3:07:53.280 --> 3:07:56.280]  So that's why we're so precious, and they want right side shut down
[3:07:56.280 --> 3:08:00.280]  So you can't even hear him, I mean this is incredible
[3:08:00.280 --> 3:08:04.280]  This is insane, I've got every cable channel on in that control room
[3:08:04.280 --> 3:08:06.280]  And nobody's carrying our president
[3:08:06.280 --> 3:08:10.280]  This is martial law by the media and by the corporations
[3:08:10.280 --> 3:08:13.280]  That Tucker Carlson warned us about, back to the president
[3:08:13.280 --> 3:08:18.280]  But where we needed them, because it's been so successful
[3:08:18.280 --> 3:08:22.280]  That we've added nearly 300 miles
[3:08:22.280 --> 3:08:24.280]  And that's currently under construction
[3:08:24.280 --> 3:08:26.280]  Attacking him is shame on you, shame on you
[3:08:26.280 --> 3:08:28.280]  They hate him, he's the real deal
[3:08:28.280 --> 3:08:30.280]  Is he perfect? No, nobody is
[3:08:30.280 --> 3:08:32.280]  But God, you pissed all over yourselves now
[3:08:32.280 --> 3:08:36.280]  For pre-construction and additional 300 miles
[3:08:36.280 --> 3:08:38.280]  In every region that we've built the wall
[3:08:38.280 --> 3:08:42.280]  Illegal crossings and drug smuggling have plummeted
[3:08:42.280 --> 3:08:44.280]  Absolutely plummeted
[3:08:44.280 --> 3:08:48.280]  In the Rio Grande Valley, crossings have dropped nearly 80%
[3:08:48.280 --> 3:08:52.280]  In Yuma, Arizona, illegal entries have been slashed by 90%
[3:08:52.280 --> 3:08:56.280]  Nationwide ice and border patrol have seized over 2 million pounds
[3:08:56.280 --> 3:09:00.280]  Of fentanyl, heroin, meth and other deadly narcotics
[3:09:00.280 --> 3:09:04.280]  Saving thousands and thousands of lives
[3:09:04.280 --> 3:09:07.280]  We've arrested nearly 500,000 illegal aliens
[3:09:07.280 --> 3:09:09.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went to the White House feed
[3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:11.280]  It is dead
[3:09:11.280 --> 3:09:14.280]  Another White House feed is showing Joe Biden
[3:09:14.280 --> 3:09:16.280]  We are under martial law
[3:09:16.280 --> 3:09:18.280]  We are under globalist attack
[3:09:18.280 --> 3:09:20.280]  Drudge report is owned by CNN, I'm told now
[3:09:20.280 --> 3:09:24.280]  They are celebrating ZZPing Rules America
[3:09:24.280 --> 3:09:28.280]  They say ZZPing Rules America
[3:09:28.280 --> 3:09:33.280]  God, I mean, wow, we will put up with anything
[3:09:33.280 --> 3:09:35.280]  Let's go back to this great president
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:38.280]  My God, only people say, oh, Trump's not perfect
[3:09:38.280 --> 3:09:40.280]  He ain't Joe Biden, bitch
[3:09:40.280 --> 3:09:42.280]  I've been persecuted for supporting Trump
[3:09:42.280 --> 3:09:44.280]  And I will continue to support the truth
[3:09:44.280 --> 3:09:46.280]  He's not perfect, but he's not a pedophile globalist
[3:09:46.280 --> 3:09:48.280]  Let's finish up with the president
[3:09:48.280 --> 3:09:50.280]  But even worse, it's catch and release them
[3:09:50.280 --> 3:09:54.280]  It means release into our country, not into another country
[3:09:54.280 --> 3:09:58.280]  This policy was exploited by vicious criminal organizations
[3:09:58.280 --> 3:10:00.280]  Who understood the laws better than our people
[3:10:00.280 --> 3:10:02.280]  Understood them for years
[3:10:02.280 --> 3:10:05.280]  To spread misery and suffering and drugs
[3:10:05.280 --> 3:10:08.280]  All across the hemisphere
[3:10:08.280 --> 3:10:10.280]  Now, instead of catch and release
[3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:12.280]  We have detain and remove
[3:10:12.280 --> 3:10:14.280]  It's called detain and remove
[3:10:14.280 --> 3:10:16.280]  Doesn't that sound better?
[3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:18.280]  One of the biggest loopholes we closed
[3:10:18.280 --> 3:10:20.280]  Was asylum fraud
[3:10:20.280 --> 3:10:22.280]  Under the old broken system
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:24.280]  If you merely requested asylum
[3:10:24.280 --> 3:10:27.280]  You were released into the country
[3:10:27.280 --> 3:10:30.280]  The most ridiculous thing anyone's ever seen
[3:10:30.280 --> 3:10:32.280]  And we were taking in some people
[3:10:32.280 --> 3:10:34.280]  That you didn't want to have in your country
[3:10:34.280 --> 3:10:38.280]  We instituted a series of historic policy changes
[3:10:38.280 --> 3:10:40.280]  To shut down asylum fraud
[3:10:40.280 --> 3:10:42.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are with this
[3:10:42.280 --> 3:10:44.280]  Includes the groundbreaking agreement
[3:10:44.280 --> 3:10:48.280]  We're checking Yahoo, Twitter, Facebook, Google
[3:10:48.280 --> 3:10:51.280]  He's nowhere
[3:10:51.280 --> 3:10:53.280]  He's not on the White House website
[3:10:53.280 --> 3:10:56.280]  If they can shut down the president of the U.S.
[3:10:56.280 --> 3:10:59.280]  They can shut anything down
[3:10:59.280 --> 3:11:02.280]  Whoa!
[3:11:02.280 --> 3:11:05.280]  I mean, this is incredible
[3:11:05.280 --> 3:11:07.280]  Then they force-feed Joe Biden as president-elect
[3:11:07.280 --> 3:11:10.280]  No one watches
[3:11:10.280 --> 3:11:13.280]  I mean, man, this is crazy
[3:11:13.280 --> 3:11:16.280]  The president of the U.S. is blocked
[3:11:16.280 --> 3:11:19.280]  So they can lie about him and say whatever they want
[3:11:19.280 --> 3:11:21.280]  This is big tech, man
[3:11:21.280 --> 3:11:24.280]  This is so dangerous, ladies and gentlemen
[3:11:24.280 --> 3:11:26.280]  Thank God we built InfoWars
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:29.280]  And I mean, how long will we be here?
[3:11:29.280 --> 3:11:32.280]  I mean, man, this is incredible
[3:11:32.280 --> 3:11:35.280]  They have shut the president of the U.S. down
[3:11:35.280 --> 3:11:37.280]  Where he's on no channels
[3:11:37.280 --> 3:11:40.280]  But right side broadcasting at infowars.com
[3:11:40.280 --> 3:11:41.280]  Let's go back to it
[3:11:41.280 --> 3:11:44.280]  We actually had 27,000 Mexican soldiers
[3:11:44.280 --> 3:11:46.280]  Guarding our borders over the last two years
[3:11:46.280 --> 3:11:48.280]  Nobody thought that was possible
[3:11:48.280 --> 3:11:49.280]  I can't believe it
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:11:50.280]  I mean, I knew it was coming
[3:11:50.280 --> 3:11:51.280]  But I never thought that
[3:11:51.280 --> 3:11:53.280]  That's why the numbers say
[3:11:53.280 --> 3:11:56.280]  Even during the construction of the wall
[3:11:56.280 --> 3:11:59.280]  And by the way, one of the big elements of the wall
[3:11:59.280 --> 3:12:00.280]  That make it so successful
[3:12:00.280 --> 3:12:03.280]  Is we can have far fewer people working now
[3:12:03.280 --> 3:12:06.280]  They can be working on other things
[3:12:06.280 --> 3:12:10.280]  Other things related to crime and drug prevention
[3:12:10.280 --> 3:12:12.280]  And a lot of other elements they're working on
[3:12:12.280 --> 3:12:15.280]  Because we save massive numbers of people
[3:12:15.280 --> 3:12:19.280]  And included here we have the most sophisticated camera systems
[3:12:19.280 --> 3:12:23.280]  And most sophisticated electronic systems
[3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:25.280]  Anywhere in the world
[3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:27.280]  We implemented three historic agreements
[3:12:27.280 --> 3:12:29.280]  With the northern triangle
[3:12:29.280 --> 3:12:33.280]  That's Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:37.280]  Under these critical asylum cooperation agreements
[3:12:37.280 --> 3:12:39.280]  The burden of illegal immigration is now shared
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:41.280]  All across the region
[3:12:41.280 --> 3:12:44.280]  Now when an illegal immigrant is arrested at our border
[3:12:44.280 --> 3:12:46.280]  They can be sent to a neighboring country
[3:12:46.280 --> 3:12:49.280]  Instead of into a U.S. community
[3:12:49.280 --> 3:12:51.280]  Prior to my getting here
[3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:53.280]  Countries wouldn't accept them
[3:12:53.280 --> 3:12:54.280]  They would say, no, no, no
[3:12:54.280 --> 3:12:57.280]  I said, well, you got to take them
[3:12:57.280 --> 3:12:59.280]  First month, I'll never forget
[3:12:59.280 --> 3:13:01.280]  These gentlemen right here came to me
[3:13:01.280 --> 3:13:03.280]  They said they won't take them back
[3:13:03.280 --> 3:13:05.280]  They came, they may be murderers
[3:13:05.280 --> 3:13:08.280]  They may be cartel heads
[3:13:08.280 --> 3:13:11.280]  They may be some really vicious people
[3:13:11.280 --> 3:13:13.280]  The countries didn't want them back
[3:13:13.280 --> 3:13:16.280]  And I stopped all payments to those countries
[3:13:16.280 --> 3:13:19.280]  I stopped everything going to those countries
[3:13:19.280 --> 3:13:22.280]  And after it was stopped for about a month
[3:13:22.280 --> 3:13:24.280]  You remember?
[3:13:24.280 --> 3:13:26.280]  After it was stopped for about a month they called
[3:13:26.280 --> 3:13:29.280]  They said, we'd love to have them back
[3:13:29.280 --> 3:13:32.280]  And they never gave them as much money as they were getting
[3:13:32.280 --> 3:13:34.280]  By the way, but they got some
[3:13:34.280 --> 3:13:36.280]  It was amazing
[3:13:36.280 --> 3:13:38.280]  And new people know better than anyone
[3:13:38.280 --> 3:13:39.280]  They wouldn't take them back
[3:13:39.280 --> 3:13:41.280]  Would have planes flying over
[3:13:41.280 --> 3:13:43.280]  With people that we didn't want here
[3:13:43.280 --> 3:13:45.280]  And they'd say, don't ever even think
[3:13:45.280 --> 3:13:47.280]  About landing that plane
[3:13:47.280 --> 3:13:49.280]  And they'd take them by boat and they'd take them by bus
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:51.280]  And they wouldn't let them into their countries
[3:13:51.280 --> 3:13:53.280]  And all of a sudden they say, welcome back
[3:13:53.280 --> 3:13:55.280]  We love having you
[3:13:55.280 --> 3:13:58.280]  So it was a great thing and now they do take them back
[3:13:58.280 --> 3:14:01.280]  And the relationship with those countries, the triangle
[3:14:01.280 --> 3:14:04.280]  The relationship is a much better one than it was before
[3:14:04.280 --> 3:14:06.280]  In addition to our agreements with Mexico
[3:14:06.280 --> 3:14:09.280]  Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:13.280]  We have systematically reformed the regulatory code
[3:14:13.280 --> 3:14:17.280]  To return asylum to its original legal meaning
[3:14:17.280 --> 3:14:20.280]  And purpose, not a free ticket for entry
[3:14:20.280 --> 3:14:23.280]  A recent comprehensive report by the Department
[3:14:23.280 --> 3:14:25.280]  Of Homeland Security and Justice
[3:14:25.280 --> 3:14:27.280]  Show how effective our reforms have been
[3:14:27.280 --> 3:14:30.280]  And how disastrous their removal would be
[3:14:30.280 --> 3:14:32.280]  It would be a disaster for our country
[3:14:32.280 --> 3:14:34.280]  I know they're thinking about removing them
[3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:36.280]  I hope they don't do that
[3:14:36.280 --> 3:14:40.280]  It'll be absolute travesty for our country
[3:14:40.280 --> 3:14:43.280]  The report conclusively proves once and for all
[3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:46.280]  That aliens released at the border remain at large
[3:14:46.280 --> 3:14:48.280]  In the country
[3:14:48.280 --> 3:14:50.280]  And do not return home
[3:14:50.280 --> 3:14:52.280]  They won't go home
[3:14:52.280 --> 3:14:54.280]  And you've rarely find them
[3:14:54.280 --> 3:14:56.280]  It's very tough to find them
[3:14:56.280 --> 3:14:59.280]  So we have aliens released in our country
[3:14:59.280 --> 3:15:02.280]  Many of whom are serious criminals
[3:15:02.280 --> 3:15:04.280]  And we've stopped that
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:06.280]  Don't ever stop that process again
[3:15:06.280 --> 3:15:08.280]  By contrast, under our policies
[3:15:08.280 --> 3:15:14.280]  98% of aliens that remain in DHS custody are removed
[3:15:14.280 --> 3:15:17.280]  Simply put, if you enter the United States illegally
[3:15:17.280 --> 3:15:19.280]  You are apprehended
[3:15:19.280 --> 3:15:24.280]  And immediately, safely removed from our country
[3:15:24.280 --> 3:15:26.280]  Without this core principle
[3:15:26.280 --> 3:15:28.280]  There is no border
[3:15:28.280 --> 3:15:29.280]  There is no law
[3:15:29.280 --> 3:15:31.280]  Which, by the way, the globalists admit
[3:15:31.280 --> 3:15:33.280]  Is their plan to flood the border
[3:15:33.280 --> 3:15:35.280]  Ladies and gentlemen
[3:15:35.280 --> 3:15:39.280]  We are witnessing, for the first time in modern history
[3:15:39.280 --> 3:15:42.280]  A president giving a major speech
[3:15:42.280 --> 3:15:46.280]  In the middle of this firestorm
[3:15:46.280 --> 3:15:54.280]  And it's not on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC
[3:15:54.280 --> 3:15:55.280]  I'm in there checking
[3:15:55.280 --> 3:15:57.280]  It's nowhere
[3:15:57.280 --> 3:16:01.280]  Instead, you've got the federal prosecutor in DC
[3:16:01.280 --> 3:16:03.280]  About how he's going to charge all the people
[3:16:03.280 --> 3:16:04.280]  That went to the Capitol
[3:16:04.280 --> 3:16:07.280]  When the feds opened the doors up and shot citizens
[3:16:07.280 --> 3:16:10.280]  God, man, we are screwed, man
[3:16:10.280 --> 3:16:12.280]  We've got big tech, big media
[3:16:12.280 --> 3:16:15.280]  Ganged up on America in a giant gang rape
[3:16:15.280 --> 3:16:17.280]  And our poor and battled president
[3:16:17.280 --> 3:16:19.280]  Will be gone in eight days
[3:16:19.280 --> 3:16:20.280]  Down on the border
[3:16:20.280 --> 3:16:23.280]  Saying we should have a border and fight the UN takeover
[3:16:23.280 --> 3:16:26.280]  Gosh, just thank God, info wars is here
[3:16:26.280 --> 3:16:28.280]  And right side broadcasting
[3:16:28.280 --> 3:16:30.280]  Let's go back to the president
[3:16:30.280 --> 3:16:32.280]  On the other side in Mexico
[3:16:32.280 --> 3:16:35.280]  They're suffering greatly with the virus
[3:16:35.280 --> 3:16:38.280]  It's been incredible what we've achieved
[3:16:38.280 --> 3:16:39.280]  That's show Fox again
[3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:41.280]  The wall because of COVID
[3:16:41.280 --> 3:16:43.280]  That's show Fox again just
[3:16:43.280 --> 3:16:45.280]  Weird, crazy lawyers
[3:16:45.280 --> 3:16:47.280]  He's trying to indict Trump
[3:16:47.280 --> 3:16:49.280]  We're told he's already indicted Trump
[3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:51.280]  Look at that maniac
[3:16:51.280 --> 3:16:52.280]  Did you elect him?
[3:16:52.280 --> 3:16:53.280]  He loves China
[3:16:53.280 --> 3:16:54.280]  He loves death camps
[3:16:54.280 --> 3:16:55.280]  He loves it all
[3:16:55.280 --> 3:16:56.280]  He's in power
[3:16:56.280 --> 3:16:57.280]  He's a big boy now
[3:16:57.280 --> 3:17:00.280]  His mommy raised him to run things
[3:17:00.280 --> 3:17:02.280]  Let's continue, go ahead
[3:17:02.280 --> 3:17:04.280]  They're tough, they're strong
[3:17:04.280 --> 3:17:07.280]  And they're great patriots, great Americans
[3:17:07.280 --> 3:17:09.280]  We fixed it and we secured it
[3:17:09.280 --> 3:17:12.280]  We empowered our wonderful ice and border patrol
[3:17:12.280 --> 3:17:16.280]  To fulfill their oaths and sworn officers
[3:17:16.280 --> 3:17:19.280]  They became sworn officers of the law
[3:17:19.280 --> 3:17:21.280]  And they love their job
[3:17:21.280 --> 3:17:22.280]  It's a tough job
[3:17:22.280 --> 3:17:25.280]  I think when Trump learns they blocked us out
[3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:30.280]  He's going to do resolute death speeches finally
[3:17:30.280 --> 3:17:32.280]  I mean speeches all day long
[3:17:32.280 --> 3:17:34.280]  Because this is going to get out
[3:17:34.280 --> 3:17:36.280]  But man, if he was Hitler
[3:17:36.280 --> 3:17:37.280]  I'd want to hear a speech
[3:17:37.280 --> 3:17:38.280]  Or if he was Mao Zedong
[3:17:38.280 --> 3:17:39.280]  Let us hear it
[3:17:39.280 --> 3:17:41.280]  No, you can't hear it
[3:17:41.280 --> 3:17:43.280]  It incited what happened
[3:17:43.280 --> 3:17:44.280]  You're protesting
[3:17:44.280 --> 3:17:45.280]  We installed Biden
[3:17:45.280 --> 3:17:47.280]  And no one could ever question an election again
[3:17:47.280 --> 3:17:49.280]  That's North Korea, Fox
[3:17:49.280 --> 3:17:52.280]  That's the cue to turn the president back up
[3:17:52.280 --> 3:17:54.280]  You also have, and we had
[3:17:54.280 --> 3:17:56.280]  But we have them all the time
[3:17:56.280 --> 3:17:58.280]  We have terrorists from the Middle East
[3:17:58.280 --> 3:18:01.280]  Coming into our country through the southern border
[3:18:01.280 --> 3:18:03.280]  That was before what you see right here
[3:18:03.280 --> 3:18:05.280]  Because it was easier to come into our country
[3:18:05.280 --> 3:18:07.280]  Through the southern border than it was
[3:18:07.280 --> 3:18:09.280]  Through airports or any other means
[3:18:09.280 --> 3:18:11.280]  So they'd land in South America
[3:18:11.280 --> 3:18:13.280]  And they'd work their way out
[3:18:13.280 --> 3:18:15.280]  So Trump ends with the image of a country
[3:18:15.280 --> 3:18:17.280]  A wall, a wall
[3:18:17.280 --> 3:18:20.280]  A country, a wall of sovereignty
[3:18:20.280 --> 3:18:22.280]  Which they're trying to end
[3:18:22.280 --> 3:18:25.280]  These are people from some very
[3:18:25.280 --> 3:18:28.280]  Seriously dangerous places in the Middle East
[3:18:28.280 --> 3:18:30.280]  And the numbers are far greater
[3:18:30.280 --> 3:18:32.280]  Than anybody would understand
[3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:34.280]  Really far greater
[3:18:34.280 --> 3:18:36.280]  Removing any of these measures
[3:18:36.280 --> 3:18:38.280]  Would hamstring our workers in danger
[3:18:38.280 --> 3:18:41.280]  Our country and cost taxpayers
[3:18:41.280 --> 3:18:44.280]  Hundreds of billions of dollars a year
[3:18:44.280 --> 3:18:46.280]  No matter our party
[3:18:46.280 --> 3:18:48.280]  We should all agree on the need
[3:18:48.280 --> 3:18:50.280]  To protect our workers, our families
[3:18:50.280 --> 3:18:52.280]  So when every job is shut down
[3:18:52.280 --> 3:18:54.280]  In America's wasteland, all the money you got
[3:18:54.280 --> 3:18:56.280]  Goes to business
[3:18:56.280 --> 3:18:58.280]  A big smiley face monster
[3:18:58.280 --> 3:19:00.280]  And he's laughing hard
[3:19:00.280 --> 3:19:02.280]  Trigger the wave of illegal immigration
[3:19:02.280 --> 3:19:04.280]  A wave like you've never seen before
[3:19:04.280 --> 3:19:06.280]  And I can tell you that already
[3:19:06.280 --> 3:19:09.280]  Waves are starting to
[3:19:09.280 --> 3:19:11.280]  Come up from
[3:19:11.280 --> 3:19:13.280]  2000 and 1000 and 500
[3:19:13.280 --> 3:19:15.280]  Up to 800,000 viewers almost
[3:19:15.280 --> 3:19:17.280]  We have that same number last time
[3:19:17.280 --> 3:19:19.280]  I checked at infowars.com for a live show
[3:19:19.280 --> 3:19:21.280]  But that's what's sad is this should be
[3:19:21.280 --> 3:19:23.280]  On every channel, but oh
[3:19:23.280 --> 3:19:25.280]  We can't let you hear the president
[3:19:25.280 --> 3:19:28.280]  He doesn't like the New World Order
[3:19:28.280 --> 3:19:30.280]  No channels are carrying this
[3:19:30.280 --> 3:19:32.280]  But right-side info wars continue
[3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:34.280]  Calamity for national security
[3:19:34.280 --> 3:19:36.280]  Public safety and public health
[3:19:36.280 --> 3:19:38.280]  It would destroy millions and millions
[3:19:38.280 --> 3:19:40.280]  Of jobs and claim thousands
[3:19:40.280 --> 3:19:42.280]  Of innocent lives
[3:19:42.280 --> 3:19:44.280]  The policies I put into place
[3:19:44.280 --> 3:19:46.280]  Are uniformly and strongly supported
[3:19:46.280 --> 3:19:48.280]  By the men and women
[3:19:48.280 --> 3:19:50.280]  And as soon as this reasonable speech
[3:19:50.280 --> 3:19:53.280]  Is over, we'll archive it at infowars.com
[3:19:53.280 --> 3:19:55.280]  And all of you hit your email list
[3:19:55.280 --> 3:19:57.280]  Your text message, call family
[3:19:57.280 --> 3:19:59.280]  And say, here's the forbidden speech
[3:19:59.280 --> 3:20:02.280]  You aren't supposed to hear
[3:20:02.280 --> 3:20:04.280]  It's knowingly
[3:20:04.280 --> 3:20:06.280]  To put America in really serious
[3:20:06.280 --> 3:20:08.280]  Danger and to override
[3:20:08.280 --> 3:20:10.280]  The great career experts
[3:20:10.280 --> 3:20:12.280]  That have worked so hard
[3:20:12.280 --> 3:20:14.280]  To get those from DHS
[3:20:14.280 --> 3:20:16.280]  At this very moment
[3:20:16.280 --> 3:20:18.280]  See, if you just
[3:20:18.280 --> 3:20:20.280]  Fight back, folks
[3:20:20.280 --> 3:20:22.280]  If you just spread the word, we'd beat them
[3:20:22.280 --> 3:20:24.280]  But it's all about you, without you or nothing
[3:20:24.280 --> 3:20:26.280]  When I tell you, you're everything
[3:20:26.280 --> 3:20:27.280]  It's not like I'm patting you on the head
[3:20:27.280 --> 3:20:28.280]  Oh, you're so important
[3:20:28.280 --> 3:20:30.280]  I'm like, I'm paralyzed, okay
[3:20:30.280 --> 3:20:32.280]  I know all this stuff, but I'm like
[3:20:32.280 --> 3:20:33.280]  Water, please help me
[3:20:33.280 --> 3:20:35.280]  The water's racing, you gotta pull the plug over there
[3:20:35.280 --> 3:20:37.280]  Yeah, the plug's down there, get it, get it
[3:20:37.280 --> 3:20:39.280]  Please, I love you, please help me
[3:20:39.280 --> 3:20:41.280]  Thank you, Alex, I love your show
[3:20:41.280 --> 3:20:42.280]  Pull the plug, pull the plug
[3:20:42.280 --> 3:20:44.280]  Pull the plug, folks
[3:20:44.280 --> 3:20:46.280]  Spread the word
[3:20:46.280 --> 3:20:49.280]  You are Paul Rothera, this is not a game
[3:20:49.280 --> 3:20:50.280]  Continue with the president
[3:20:50.280 --> 3:20:52.280]  Political interference
[3:20:52.280 --> 3:20:54.280]  Ice and Border Patrol agents
[3:20:54.280 --> 3:20:56.280]  Swore a sacred oath to uphold the law
[3:20:56.280 --> 3:20:59.280]  And no political appointee should ever
[3:20:59.280 --> 3:21:01.280]  Order them to violate that oath
[3:21:01.280 --> 3:21:03.280]  These are real experts, they really get it
[3:21:03.280 --> 3:21:05.280]  Yeah, they get it
[3:21:05.280 --> 3:21:07.280]  You gotta have a border around the country
[3:21:07.280 --> 3:21:10.280]  Hispanic population of our country gets it
[3:21:10.280 --> 3:21:12.280]  Because not only did I win
[3:21:12.280 --> 3:21:15.280]  Texas in historic numbers
[3:21:15.280 --> 3:21:17.280]  But I won border towns
[3:21:17.280 --> 3:21:19.280]  Which are largely Hispanic
[3:21:19.280 --> 3:21:22.280]  And people were amazed to see that
[3:21:22.280 --> 3:21:24.280]  And the numbers they say were
[3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:26.280]  Governor of Texas called
[3:21:26.280 --> 3:21:28.280]  Greg, great guy, great governor called
[3:21:28.280 --> 3:21:31.280]  He said, you had numbers
[3:21:31.280 --> 3:21:34.280]  That nobody's had since reconstruction
[3:21:34.280 --> 3:21:35.280]  People hear that
[3:21:35.280 --> 3:21:38.280]  Construction means civil war
[3:21:38.280 --> 3:21:41.280]  And largely Hispanic
[3:21:41.280 --> 3:21:43.280]  They understand it better than anybody
[3:21:43.280 --> 3:21:45.280]  And they want law enforcement
[3:21:45.280 --> 3:21:48.280]  To help them live safe lives
[3:21:48.280 --> 3:21:51.280]  The laws that Congress passed must be upheld
[3:21:51.280 --> 3:21:54.280]  To the men and women of ICE, customs and border
[3:21:54.280 --> 3:21:58.280]  Protection and all across DHS
[3:21:58.280 --> 3:22:00.280]  Law enforcement in general
[3:22:00.280 --> 3:22:02.280]  You have earned the everlasting
[3:22:02.280 --> 3:22:03.280]  Gratitude of our nation
[3:22:03.280 --> 3:22:05.280]  You have no idea how much...
[3:22:05.280 --> 3:22:07.280]  Yeah, the whole UN plan is to end our border
[3:22:07.280 --> 3:22:09.280]  UN folks, they're collapsing the third world
[3:22:09.280 --> 3:22:10.280]  Right now in the flesh
[3:22:10.280 --> 3:22:11.280]  We're not against the people
[3:22:11.280 --> 3:22:12.280]  We're against the globalists
[3:22:12.280 --> 3:22:13.280]  And we have just...
[3:22:13.280 --> 3:22:14.280]  This is it
[3:22:14.280 --> 3:22:15.280]  Go ahead
[3:22:15.280 --> 3:22:17.280]  Aspect it long into the future
[3:22:17.280 --> 3:22:18.280]  God bless you
[3:22:18.280 --> 3:22:20.280]  God bless law enforcement
[3:22:20.280 --> 3:22:22.280]  And God bless America
[3:22:22.280 --> 3:22:23.280]  Thank you very much
[3:22:23.280 --> 3:22:24.280]  Thank you
[3:22:24.280 --> 3:22:26.280]  The reasonable, truthful speech
[3:22:26.280 --> 3:22:28.280]  Was blacked out everywhere
[3:22:28.280 --> 3:22:29.280]  But right-sided and forced
[3:22:29.280 --> 3:22:31.280]  Not on Fox, not on CNN
[3:22:31.280 --> 3:22:32.280]  Not on MSNBC
[3:22:32.280 --> 3:22:35.280]  Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
[3:22:35.280 --> 3:22:37.280]  Total shutdown
[3:22:37.280 --> 3:22:39.280]  That's telecommunications control
[3:22:39.280 --> 3:22:41.280]  We are under globalist martial law
[3:22:41.280 --> 3:22:42.280]  God almighty
[3:22:42.280 --> 3:22:44.280]  Let's go back to the audio right side
[3:22:44.280 --> 3:22:45.280]  God bless right side
[3:22:45.280 --> 3:22:46.280]  Go back to it
[3:22:47.280 --> 3:22:49.280]  Let's hear the audio from right side
[3:22:49.280 --> 3:23:11.280]  No audio
[3:23:19.280 --> 3:23:26.280]  No audio
[3:23:26.280 --> 3:23:27.280]  So there you go
[3:23:27.280 --> 3:23:29.280]  A nation that turned on itself
[3:23:29.280 --> 3:23:30.280]  A nation that was taught to fight
[3:23:30.280 --> 3:23:32.280]  With itself with a race and all this stuff
[3:23:32.280 --> 3:23:33.280]  And now we're screwed
[3:23:33.280 --> 3:23:36.280]  We're going into Chai Con rule
[3:23:36.280 --> 3:23:38.280]  We're going into hell on earth
[3:23:38.280 --> 3:23:40.280]  And I tried hard
[3:23:40.280 --> 3:23:41.280]  And we'll turn around later
[3:23:41.280 --> 3:23:43.280]  But man, I tell you
[3:23:43.280 --> 3:23:45.280]  You're gonna get hurt bad now, folks
[3:23:45.280 --> 3:23:47.280]  The globalists are gonna barbecue you
[3:23:47.280 --> 3:23:50.280]  Up one side and down the other
[3:23:54.280 --> 3:23:56.280]  Some radio stations and TV stations
[3:23:56.280 --> 3:23:58.280]  Just rejoined us
[3:24:01.280 --> 3:24:05.280]  And I am flabbergasted by the reasonable
[3:24:05.280 --> 3:24:08.280]  Focused, incredibly presidential
[3:24:08.280 --> 3:24:10.280]  And most importantly truthful speech
[3:24:10.280 --> 3:24:13.280]  I just heard for 30 minutes
[3:24:14.280 --> 3:24:16.280]  Trump usually starts late
[3:24:16.280 --> 3:24:18.280]  He started early
[3:24:19.280 --> 3:24:21.280]  Speech was set for 215th century
[3:24:21.280 --> 3:24:23.280]  Started like 203
[3:24:24.280 --> 3:24:27.280]  And for 30 minutes he laid out Veritas
[3:24:27.280 --> 3:24:29.280]  That's proof in Latin
[3:24:33.280 --> 3:24:34.280]  And I was out there
[3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:36.280]  It wasn't on one US TV network
[3:24:39.280 --> 3:24:40.280]  I don't care if he was
[3:24:40.280 --> 3:24:43.280]  Moussey Tong or Adolf Hitler
[3:24:43.280 --> 3:24:44.280]  Or Jeffrey Dahmer
[3:24:44.280 --> 3:24:46.280]  If he's our president
[3:24:46.280 --> 3:24:47.280]  You want to hear what he has to say
[3:24:47.280 --> 3:24:49.280]  Because you get to make a decision
[3:24:49.280 --> 3:24:51.280]  But mainstream media decided
[3:24:51.280 --> 3:24:52.280]  And big tech decided
[3:24:52.280 --> 3:24:55.280]  You don't get to see that, you dirty American
[3:24:57.280 --> 3:24:59.280]  And that's what you got to wake up to
[3:24:59.280 --> 3:25:01.280]  That's how tourney works
[3:25:01.280 --> 3:25:03.280]  Put up with Alex Joseph's banding
[3:25:03.280 --> 3:25:05.280]  Now it's all your bandings
[3:25:05.280 --> 3:25:07.280]  And that's where we are
[3:25:08.280 --> 3:25:11.280]  The war room's coming up in 25 minutes
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:13.280]  I've got some other key articles
[3:25:13.280 --> 3:25:14.280]  To cover here
[3:25:14.280 --> 3:25:16.280]  But man, oh man
[3:25:16.280 --> 3:25:18.280]  They're planning a second revolution
[3:25:18.280 --> 3:25:21.280]  With the leftist stage of terror attacks this weekend
[3:25:21.280 --> 3:25:23.280]  To make Joe Biden look legitimate
[3:25:23.280 --> 3:25:25.280]  And like all these violent people are attacking
[3:25:25.280 --> 3:25:27.280]  They're not engaged in information war
[3:25:27.280 --> 3:25:28.280]  They're engaged in violence
[3:25:28.280 --> 3:25:30.280]  Because they work for Biden
[3:25:30.280 --> 3:25:32.280]  They know they're going to be protected
[3:25:32.280 --> 3:25:34.280]  Just like the young black man that came
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:36.280]  And led the attack on the Capitol
[3:25:36.280 --> 3:25:37.280]  Who was released
[3:25:37.280 --> 3:25:40.280]  After he tricked folks into trying to destroy the Capitol
[3:25:40.280 --> 3:25:42.280]  But they're young black men
[3:25:42.280 --> 3:25:44.280]  And they're all doing it
[3:25:44.280 --> 3:25:46.280]  That's part of their plan
[3:25:52.280 --> 3:25:54.280]  What's crazy is
[3:25:54.280 --> 3:25:56.280]  All these people
[3:25:56.280 --> 3:25:58.280]  That claim they're part of the power structure
[3:25:58.280 --> 3:26:00.280]  That are going along with this
[3:26:00.280 --> 3:26:02.280]  You're going to lose your future
[3:26:02.280 --> 3:26:04.280]  You're going to lose your investment
[3:26:04.280 --> 3:26:06.280]  You're going to lose your birthright
[3:26:06.280 --> 3:26:08.280]  And you think you're part of the establishment
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:10.280]  When you're blowing up the middle class
[3:26:10.280 --> 3:26:12.280]  Getting rid of this big dream they called America
[3:26:12.280 --> 3:26:14.280]  Where you had a shot
[3:26:14.280 --> 3:26:16.280]  A good shot at being successful
[3:26:16.280 --> 3:26:18.280]  I mean the New World Order
[3:26:18.280 --> 3:26:20.280]  Man, they got 97%
[3:26:20.280 --> 3:26:22.280]  Tax rates in France
[3:26:22.280 --> 3:26:24.280]  Yeah, do you hear what I just said?
[3:26:26.280 --> 3:26:28.280]  They're going to keep you down
[3:26:30.280 --> 3:26:32.280]  And you're going to learn to kiss ass up front
[3:26:32.280 --> 3:26:34.280]  You get a whole bunch up front
[3:26:34.280 --> 3:26:35.280]  When you kiss ass
[3:26:35.280 --> 3:26:36.280]  But a year later you're like
[3:26:36.280 --> 3:26:38.280]  Man, I got $100,000
[3:26:38.280 --> 3:26:39.280]  To sell out last year
[3:26:39.280 --> 3:26:41.280]  I got $5,000 this year
[3:26:41.280 --> 3:26:43.280]  Next year you get $1,000
[3:26:43.280 --> 3:26:45.280]  Year after that you get $100,000
[3:26:45.280 --> 3:26:47.280]  And year after that you got to get on your knees
[3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:49.280]  And beg
[3:26:49.280 --> 3:26:51.280]  Just to even be a slave
[3:26:53.280 --> 3:26:55.280]  You're going to be like, how did I get here?
[3:26:55.280 --> 3:26:57.280]  Well, you didn't study history
[3:26:59.280 --> 3:27:01.280]  You think these big banks
[3:27:01.280 --> 3:27:03.280]  And these mega corporations
[3:27:03.280 --> 3:27:05.280]  That run slave camps in China
[3:27:05.280 --> 3:27:07.280]  You think they've got robots taking over your job
[3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:09.280]  And telling you all this because they love you
[3:27:09.280 --> 3:27:11.280]  They think you're dumb
[3:27:11.280 --> 3:27:13.280]  They think you're a chump
[3:27:13.280 --> 3:27:15.280]  They told me in meetings off record
[3:27:17.280 --> 3:27:19.280]  Jones, we're ready to make you a kingmaker
[3:27:19.280 --> 3:27:21.280]  We'll let you lead this thing
[3:27:23.280 --> 3:27:25.280]  Before Glenn Beck even came around
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:27.280]  We'll have books published every three months
[3:27:27.280 --> 3:27:29.280]  We'll have a number one show on national TV
[3:27:29.280 --> 3:27:31.280]  Everything you do will be controlled by us
[3:27:31.280 --> 3:27:33.280]  And you'll be worth billions of dollars
[3:27:33.280 --> 3:27:35.280]  Within a few years
[3:27:35.280 --> 3:27:37.280]  Join us
[3:27:37.280 --> 3:27:39.280]  You've got what it takes
[3:27:39.280 --> 3:27:41.280]  But my soul felt cold
[3:27:41.280 --> 3:27:43.280]  I didn't feel strong anymore
[3:27:43.280 --> 3:27:45.280]  I feel strong right now
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:47.280]  I feel like
[3:27:47.280 --> 3:27:49.280]  I can kill 100 people
[3:27:49.280 --> 3:27:51.280]  I can have 100 wives
[3:27:51.280 --> 3:27:53.280]  I can even touch with God
[3:27:53.280 --> 3:27:55.280]  I'm a Titan right now
[3:27:55.280 --> 3:27:57.280]  Because I'm with my people
[3:27:57.280 --> 3:27:59.280]  And the minute I even started talking to those Satanists
[3:27:59.280 --> 3:28:01.280]  I felt like I was shriveling up
[3:28:01.280 --> 3:28:03.280]  I was getting weak
[3:28:03.280 --> 3:28:05.280]  I didn't even want
[3:28:07.280 --> 3:28:09.280]  To join them
[3:28:09.280 --> 3:28:11.280]  And my cells said
[3:28:11.280 --> 3:28:13.280]  Boy, you're not
[3:28:13.280 --> 3:28:15.280]  Joining Satan
[3:28:15.280 --> 3:28:17.280]  Ever
[3:28:17.280 --> 3:28:19.280]  And don't you know Trump's on the same power trip
[3:28:19.280 --> 3:28:21.280]  He's a billionaire, he's had all the women
[3:28:21.280 --> 3:28:23.280]  He's had everything, but he wasn't a Satanist
[3:28:23.280 --> 3:28:25.280]  He's not perfect, and he dialed in to helping people
[3:28:25.280 --> 3:28:27.280]  He got so high off that
[3:28:27.280 --> 3:28:29.280]  I thought, talk to Trump, he goes, I get so high
[3:28:29.280 --> 3:28:31.280]  Like, better than a rock concert
[3:28:31.280 --> 3:28:33.280]  You're the best woman, Jones
[3:28:33.280 --> 3:28:35.280]  When I do this, and he goes, I have these preachers
[3:28:35.280 --> 3:28:37.280]  In the office, and I feel this energy
[3:28:37.280 --> 3:28:39.280]  And I said, yes sir, that's the Holy Spirit
[3:28:39.280 --> 3:28:41.280]  He said, I know!
[3:28:41.280 --> 3:28:43.280]  I feel it!
[3:28:43.280 --> 3:28:45.280]  Yeah!
[3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:47.280]  See, that's where I'm at
[3:28:47.280 --> 3:28:49.280]  Because you're helicopters
[3:28:49.280 --> 3:28:51.280]  And you're private jets
[3:28:51.280 --> 3:28:53.280]  And all the whores
[3:28:53.280 --> 3:28:55.280]  What's a whore worth if I'm not alive
[3:28:55.280 --> 3:28:57.280]  While I'm having sex with her?
[3:28:57.280 --> 3:28:59.280]  It's not there, folks
[3:28:59.280 --> 3:29:01.280]  Jesus is power
[3:29:01.280 --> 3:29:03.280]  God is power. He gave us sex
[3:29:03.280 --> 3:29:05.280]  He gave us our families
[3:29:05.280 --> 3:29:07.280]  He gave us food, our children, our grand
[3:29:07.280 --> 3:29:09.280]  Everything that's good, the sun coming up
[3:29:09.280 --> 3:29:11.280]  The moon coming up, the clouds at night
[3:29:11.280 --> 3:29:13.280]  The fish in the ocean
[3:29:13.280 --> 3:29:15.280]  All this stuff, this energy, this power
[3:29:15.280 --> 3:29:17.280]  This power
[3:29:17.280 --> 3:29:19.280]  And everything the enemy attacks
[3:29:19.280 --> 3:29:21.280]  Is that power!
[3:29:25.280 --> 3:29:27.280]  The Satanists think they're getting power
[3:29:27.280 --> 3:29:29.280]  By going against God
[3:29:29.280 --> 3:29:31.280]  And the devil that controls this planet
[3:29:31.280 --> 3:29:33.280]  Gives them some power, but they're the most
[3:29:33.280 --> 3:29:35.280]  Unhappy
[3:29:37.280 --> 3:29:39.280]  Unhealthy
[3:29:39.280 --> 3:29:41.280]  Degenerate people the world's ever seen
[3:29:43.280 --> 3:29:45.280]  So there is no deal with Satan
[3:29:47.280 --> 3:29:49.280]  You're either with God
[3:29:51.280 --> 3:29:53.280]  Or you're against God, not only you out there
[3:29:53.280 --> 3:29:55.280]  Should thank Jesus Christ
[3:29:55.280 --> 3:29:57.280]  You're not in the middle of second that you're not
[3:29:57.280 --> 3:29:59.280]  Claw Schwab
[3:29:59.280 --> 3:30:01.280]  I can take one look at Claw Schwab
[3:30:01.280 --> 3:30:03.280]  Because I've been on the other side
[3:30:03.280 --> 3:30:05.280]  And I can tell you God
[3:30:05.280 --> 3:30:07.280]  Is going to wipe that son of a bitch out
[3:30:07.280 --> 3:30:09.280]  So hard you couldn't even imagine it
[3:30:09.280 --> 3:30:11.280]  Claw Schwab knows
[3:30:11.280 --> 3:30:13.280]  He's going to get run to the ground
[3:30:13.280 --> 3:30:15.280]  Claw Schwab knows
[3:30:15.280 --> 3:30:17.280]  He's going to get hammered in like a nail
[3:30:17.280 --> 3:30:19.280]  By Thor's hammer
[3:30:21.280 --> 3:30:23.280]  And Pelosi
[3:30:23.280 --> 3:30:25.280]  And Obama
[3:30:25.280 --> 3:30:27.280]  And that hunchback pedophile
[3:30:27.280 --> 3:30:29.280]  Chuck Schumer
[3:30:29.280 --> 3:30:31.280]  And all of
[3:30:31.280 --> 3:30:33.280]  My God
[3:30:37.280 --> 3:30:39.280]  You think they're the winners
[3:30:39.280 --> 3:30:41.280]  They're the losers
[3:30:43.280 --> 3:30:45.280]  So they can play their games
[3:30:45.280 --> 3:30:47.280]  And pretend they're in charge
[3:30:47.280 --> 3:30:49.280]  But there's one God in charge of the universe
[3:30:49.280 --> 3:30:51.280]  And all I know is
[3:30:53.280 --> 3:30:55.280]  I'm following that God
[3:30:59.280 --> 3:31:01.280]  And I have more knowledge in the Satanist
[3:31:01.280 --> 3:31:03.280]  More knowledge in Claw Schwab
[3:31:03.280 --> 3:31:05.280]  I know more about their own plan
[3:31:05.280 --> 3:31:07.280]  That's what they tune every day that they do
[3:31:07.280 --> 3:31:09.280]  That's not a power trip, but it's true
[3:31:09.280 --> 3:31:11.280]  I don't even want to look into their operations
[3:31:11.280 --> 3:31:13.280]  I know I could tell them how to run it
[3:31:13.280 --> 3:31:15.280]  Better than they do
[3:31:15.280 --> 3:31:17.280]  But I don't do that
[3:31:17.280 --> 3:31:19.280]  It's like a big fractal of God
[3:31:19.280 --> 3:31:21.280]  It's a sun
[3:31:21.280 --> 3:31:23.280]  And I'm just a little plant that God's razor hitting
[3:31:23.280 --> 3:31:25.280]  And God's razor hitting me
[3:31:25.280 --> 3:31:27.280]  And I'm like, oh God, I love you, thank you
[3:31:27.280 --> 3:31:29.280]  But I could become delusional
[3:31:29.280 --> 3:31:31.280]  When God's razor hit me, I could think that I'm God
[3:31:31.280 --> 3:31:33.280]  But I'm not, I'm a little plant
[3:31:33.280 --> 3:31:35.280]  That just opens up my petals
[3:31:35.280 --> 3:31:37.280]  And says, I love you
[3:31:37.280 --> 3:31:39.280]  I want to build other planets
[3:31:39.280 --> 3:31:41.280]  I want greenery in the universe
[3:31:41.280 --> 3:31:43.280]  I want consciousness, I want to worship you
[3:31:43.280 --> 3:31:45.280]  I love you
[3:31:45.280 --> 3:31:47.280]  Thank you, God
[3:31:47.280 --> 3:31:49.280]  Thank you for your power
[3:31:49.280 --> 3:31:51.280]  I recognize you, I don't want to be you
[3:31:51.280 --> 3:31:53.280]  Please, raise me up
[3:31:53.280 --> 3:31:55.280]  Instead of this, a dead tree
[3:31:55.280 --> 3:31:57.280]  We're a tree that's risen
[3:31:57.280 --> 3:31:59.280]  This is the sign of who we are
[3:31:59.280 --> 3:32:01.280]  Our arms are up to God, to the sun
[3:32:01.280 --> 3:32:03.280]  To our ancestors, to everyone that came before us
[3:32:03.280 --> 3:32:05.280]  And will come, we just say
[3:32:05.280 --> 3:32:07.280]  God, empower us
[3:32:07.280 --> 3:32:09.280]  Over, right, in Vietnam
[3:32:09.280 --> 3:32:11.280]  Help us break the will of Chuck Schumer
[3:32:11.280 --> 3:32:13.280]  Help us in your
[3:32:13.280 --> 3:32:15.280]  Holy work
[3:32:15.280 --> 3:32:17.280]  Deliver us
[3:32:17.280 --> 3:32:19.280]  From evil
[3:32:19.280 --> 3:32:21.280]  All right
[3:32:21.280 --> 3:32:23.280]  I've got more I want to say before the Sims
[3:32:23.280 --> 3:32:25.280]  That Owen Shroyer takes over the war room
[3:32:25.280 --> 3:32:27.280]  But since I mentioned it
[3:32:27.280 --> 3:32:29.280]  Let's air proof
[3:32:29.280 --> 3:32:31.280]  DC Capital Riot was started by false flag
[3:32:31.280 --> 3:32:33.280]  Or should I air
[3:32:33.280 --> 3:32:35.280]  Selling the illusion of insurrection
[3:32:35.280 --> 3:32:37.280]  Maybe we haven't aired that yet
[3:32:37.280 --> 3:32:39.280]  Or we should air that, let's air clip 3
[3:32:39.280 --> 3:32:41.280]  Right now
[3:32:41.280 --> 3:32:43.280]  Let's thank Jesus
[3:32:43.280 --> 3:32:45.280]  And I'm serious
[3:32:45.280 --> 3:32:47.280]  That whatever happened to our family
[3:32:47.280 --> 3:32:49.280]  Or our background, whoever we are
[3:32:49.280 --> 3:32:51.280]  That we love God
[3:32:51.280 --> 3:32:53.280]  Because the fact that you can see God
[3:32:53.280 --> 3:32:55.280]  The fact that you know God
[3:32:55.280 --> 3:32:57.280]  The fact that you recognize
[3:32:57.280 --> 3:32:59.280]  That Klaus Schwab
[3:32:59.280 --> 3:33:01.280]  And David Rockefeller
[3:33:01.280 --> 3:33:03.280]  And Brian Stelter
[3:33:03.280 --> 3:33:05.280]  And Joe Biden are falling in evil
[3:33:05.280 --> 3:33:07.280]  The fact that you see that
[3:33:07.280 --> 3:33:09.280]  Is your redemption
[3:33:09.280 --> 3:33:11.280]  God
[3:33:11.280 --> 3:33:13.280]  That is all you need
[3:33:13.280 --> 3:33:15.280]  Look at that creature
[3:33:15.280 --> 3:33:17.280]  Holy
[3:33:17.280 --> 3:33:19.280]  Hell
[3:33:19.280 --> 3:33:21.280]  Deliver the children from it
[3:33:21.280 --> 3:33:23.280]  That is the creature
[3:33:23.280 --> 3:33:25.280]  That is the frontline

[3:34:39.280 --> 3:35:07.280]  Just don't compare
[3:35:07.280 --> 3:35:09.280]  I just want to look into the guy that says they've watched
[3:35:09.280 --> 3:35:11.280]  The COVID-19 lockdowns to bankruptcy
[3:35:11.280 --> 3:35:13.280]  And make you poor. You might want to find out
[3:35:13.280 --> 3:35:15.280]  Who this super villain is
[3:35:15.280 --> 3:35:17.280]  But you see, he believes because
[3:35:17.280 --> 3:35:19.280]  He's hidden playing you
[3:35:19.280 --> 3:35:21.280]  And you're not speaking out against it
[3:35:21.280 --> 3:35:23.280]  That he has the right to do it to you
[3:35:23.280 --> 3:35:25.280]  You might want to find out who he works for
[3:35:25.280 --> 3:35:27.280]  He works directly for Prince Charles
[3:35:27.280 --> 3:35:29.280]  He developed, since the 80s
[3:35:29.280 --> 3:35:31.280]  The plan for global sustainability
[3:35:31.280 --> 3:35:33.280]  That means worldwide Neo feudalism
[3:35:33.280 --> 3:35:35.280]  In his own works
[3:35:35.280 --> 3:35:37.280]  But using vaccines to sterilize you
[3:35:37.280 --> 3:35:39.280]  Before you take those shots
[3:35:39.280 --> 3:35:41.280]  You might just want to find out who this villain is
[3:35:41.280 --> 3:35:43.280]  Alright
[3:35:43.280 --> 3:35:45.280]  Now is the time
[3:35:45.280 --> 3:35:47.280]  To get prepared
[3:35:47.280 --> 3:35:49.280]  You got to pray to God and get your soul ready
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:51.280]  You got to be prepared to physically defend yourself
[3:35:51.280 --> 3:35:53.280]  And your family
[3:35:53.280 --> 3:35:55.280]  You've also got to get things
[3:35:55.280 --> 3:35:57.280]  That allow you and your family to not be dependent
[3:35:57.280 --> 3:35:59.280]  On the system
[3:35:59.280 --> 3:36:01.280]  That's why they want to bankrupt the economy
[3:36:01.280 --> 3:36:03.280]  It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure
[3:36:03.280 --> 3:36:05.280]  Because they want all of us on our knees
[3:36:05.280 --> 3:36:07.280]  So they can dictate our surrender to them
[3:36:07.280 --> 3:36:09.280]  Info wars
[3:36:09.280 --> 3:36:11.280]  Is a critical organization
[3:36:11.280 --> 3:36:13.280]  In the fight against the globalist

[3:37:03.280 --> 3:37:07.280]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned
[3:37:07.280 --> 3:37:11.280]  That's why every month we launch a new URL
[3:37:11.280 --> 3:37:13.280]  Before they ban it
[3:37:13.280 --> 3:37:15.280]  But Soros and Bill Gates
[3:37:15.280 --> 3:37:17.280]  And the globalists are on our tail
[3:37:17.280 --> 3:37:19.280]  But the new website is
[3:37:19.280 --> 3:37:21.280]  The resistance.video
[3:37:21.280 --> 3:37:23.280]  The resistance.video
[3:37:23.280 --> 3:37:25.280]  They're trying to block us
[3:37:25.280 --> 3:37:27.280]  Because the truth is powerful
[3:37:27.280 --> 3:37:29.280]  And can defeat them
[3:37:29.280 --> 3:37:31.280]  So the new URL that links right to banned.video
[3:37:31.280 --> 3:37:33.280]  And all of our videos
[3:37:33.280 --> 3:37:35.280]  And all of our documentaries
[3:37:35.280 --> 3:37:37.280]  And all the special reports

[3:37:39.280 --> 3:37:41.280]  Share the link
[3:37:41.280 --> 3:37:43.280]  The resistance.video
[3:37:43.280 --> 3:38:11.280]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show
[3:38:11.280 --> 3:38:13.280]  The Info War
[3:38:13.280 --> 3:38:19.280]  Alright, here I stand on Tuesday, January 12, 2021
[3:38:19.280 --> 3:38:22.280]  Eight days left until Joe Biden takes over
[3:38:22.280 --> 3:38:25.280]  And man, everybody knows they are going to cut the economy off
[3:38:25.280 --> 3:38:27.280]  They're going to shut the power off
[3:38:27.280 --> 3:38:29.280]  The gas off
[3:38:29.280 --> 3:38:31.280]  It's going to be hell on earth
[3:38:31.280 --> 3:38:33.280]  But hey, we're not like those babies in that womb getting cut up
[3:38:33.280 --> 3:38:36.280]  That's why God's like, hey, you let babies get killed?
[3:38:36.280 --> 3:38:38.280]  I'm going to let you see how it's like
[3:38:38.280 --> 3:38:40.280]  So we deserve what's going to happen
[3:38:40.280 --> 3:38:42.280]  But I want to win through this
[3:38:42.280 --> 3:38:45.280]  I want to use this as God's going to give us an opportunity
[3:38:45.280 --> 3:38:48.280]  To wake up and stand up and be men again
[3:38:48.280 --> 3:38:50.280]  And be women again, okay?
[3:38:50.280 --> 3:38:52.280]  So that's it
[3:38:52.280 --> 3:38:55.280]  You're going to find that fantasy football doesn't matter anymore
[3:38:55.280 --> 3:38:57.280]  You're going to find none of that matters
[3:38:57.280 --> 3:38:59.280]  But there's no food at your house
[3:38:59.280 --> 3:39:01.280]  They're going, oh, get an extra vaccine
[3:39:01.280 --> 3:39:03.280]  You get $100, you're going to go do it
[3:39:03.280 --> 3:39:05.280]  You're going to have a convulsion, you're going to die
[3:39:05.280 --> 3:39:07.280]  I mean, the death is just everywhere
[3:39:07.280 --> 3:39:09.280]  They're killing us, they're rolling it out
[3:39:09.280 --> 3:39:11.280]  They're normalizing it
[3:39:11.280 --> 3:39:15.280]  This is a scientific takeover
[3:39:15.280 --> 3:39:17.280]  And I'm sad that this is the case
[3:39:17.280 --> 3:39:19.280]  But I mean, we knew who the globalists were
[3:39:19.280 --> 3:39:21.280]  We knew what they were going to do
[3:39:21.280 --> 3:39:25.280]  And we just saw a U.S. president 20 minutes ago
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:28.280]  Conclude a 30-minute speech
[3:39:28.280 --> 3:39:31.280]  That not one network covered
[3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:33.280]  I don't think even C-SPAN death
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:36.280]  That is disciplined control
[3:39:36.280 --> 3:39:39.280]  First it's Alex Jones three years ago
[3:39:39.280 --> 3:39:41.280]  Now it's President Trump
[3:39:41.280 --> 3:39:43.280]  Then it's you, his bank account
[3:39:43.280 --> 3:39:46.280]  And a lot of folks are like, well, I'll just go along with it
[3:39:46.280 --> 3:39:49.280]  Oh, you think you just are against America
[3:39:49.280 --> 3:39:51.280]  And shut up and you get your money?
[3:39:51.280 --> 3:39:53.280]  Oh, no!
[3:39:53.280 --> 3:39:55.280]  Now AI has your algorithm
[3:39:55.280 --> 3:39:58.280]  Now you've got to do everything it says
[3:40:01.280 --> 3:40:03.280]  That's what I'm explaining to you
[3:40:03.280 --> 3:40:08.280]  The season of all of you sitting on the fence is over
[3:40:08.280 --> 3:40:10.280]  People are like, Jones, are you scared?
[3:40:10.280 --> 3:40:12.280]  Uh, the opposite
[3:40:12.280 --> 3:40:16.280]  I've been in the bacon grease for a long time
[3:40:16.280 --> 3:40:18.280]  I've been lowered down in it
[3:40:18.280 --> 3:40:20.280]  My whole life
[3:40:20.280 --> 3:40:23.280]  For this moment
[3:40:23.280 --> 3:40:26.280]  I've been waiting for this moment all my life
[3:40:26.280 --> 3:40:29.280]  Because I believe when I warn you
[3:40:29.280 --> 3:40:31.280]  When you get lowered down into that grease
[3:40:31.280 --> 3:40:34.280]  And your toes hit that boiling pain
[3:40:34.280 --> 3:40:36.280]  And then it's up to your shins
[3:40:36.280 --> 3:40:38.280]  And up to your legs
[3:40:38.280 --> 3:40:39.280]  And up to your waist
[3:40:39.280 --> 3:40:40.280]  And up to your chest
[3:40:40.280 --> 3:40:42.280]  And up to your neck
[3:40:42.280 --> 3:40:44.280]  That you're going to fight back
[3:40:44.280 --> 3:40:47.280]  I'm betting on you
[3:40:47.280 --> 3:40:52.280]  I've lived in the grease for decades
[3:40:52.280 --> 3:40:54.280]  Psychically
[3:40:54.280 --> 3:40:57.280]  And I'm not a victim, it's made me powerful
[3:40:57.280 --> 3:41:00.280]  But I'm here to tell you right now
[3:41:00.280 --> 3:41:05.280]  You need to decide to declare your will
[3:41:05.280 --> 3:41:09.280]  Which you own your damn soul
[3:41:09.280 --> 3:41:11.280]  And the first rule is
[3:41:11.280 --> 3:41:13.280]  Declare, I'll tell you the rules
[3:41:13.280 --> 3:41:15.280]  I'll start telling you the rules starting tomorrow
[3:41:15.280 --> 3:41:16.280]  All of them
[3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:19.280]  Because now I'm authorized to tell you now
[3:41:19.280 --> 3:41:22.280]  Now the enemy has to launch
[3:41:22.280 --> 3:41:24.280]  We're now under enemy attack
[3:41:24.280 --> 3:41:25.280]  I'll tell you the rules
[3:41:25.280 --> 3:41:28.280]  You must declare your soul as your own
[3:41:28.280 --> 3:41:32.280]  Just declare your free will as your own
[3:41:32.280 --> 3:41:34.280]  And then you must direct your soul
[3:41:34.280 --> 3:41:36.280]  In the direction you want to go
[3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:38.280]  I suggest Jesus Christ
[3:41:38.280 --> 3:41:40.280]  You can set this however you want
[3:41:40.280 --> 3:41:41.280]  You want to join Satan?
[3:41:41.280 --> 3:41:42.280]  Many of you are in fear
[3:41:42.280 --> 3:41:45.280]  You will join Satan
[3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:48.280]  And you will be given a season of power
[3:41:48.280 --> 3:41:50.280]  To do whatever you want
[3:41:50.280 --> 3:41:53.280]  But you will burn for eternity
[3:41:53.280 --> 3:41:55.280]  In your own juices
[3:41:55.280 --> 3:41:57.280]  You will be cut off from good
[3:41:57.280 --> 3:41:58.280]  To resonate with that energy
[3:41:58.280 --> 3:42:00.280]  And that is like burning in a lake of fire
[3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:03.280]  The only human description is burning in fire
[3:42:03.280 --> 3:42:05.280]  Not your mother, not your father
[3:42:05.280 --> 3:42:09.280]  Not blue pastures, green hills, the sky, love
[3:42:09.280 --> 3:42:11.280]  Not all the goodness
[3:42:11.280 --> 3:42:14.280]  You deny that, you resonate with that
[3:42:14.280 --> 3:42:16.280]  You are in a lake of fire
[3:42:16.280 --> 3:42:17.280]  You are in hell
[3:42:17.280 --> 3:42:20.280]  Your cells will beg you to get out of it
[3:42:20.280 --> 3:42:23.280]  But you chose it
[3:42:23.280 --> 3:42:26.280]  So I tell you now
[3:42:26.280 --> 3:42:28.280]  You will choose God
[3:42:28.280 --> 3:42:29.280]  Or you will choose the devil
[3:42:29.280 --> 3:42:31.280]  They're going to hook wires in your brains
[3:42:31.280 --> 3:42:32.280]  And put microchips in you
[3:42:32.280 --> 3:42:34.280]  And I'll give you all these drugs
[3:42:34.280 --> 3:42:36.280]  To make you happy, but you won't be
[3:42:36.280 --> 3:42:39.280]  Nothing will fulfill you
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:41.280]  Like the moment with Christ
[3:42:41.280 --> 3:42:43.280]  Nothing will fulfill you like the Holy Ghost
[3:42:43.280 --> 3:42:45.280]  The Holy Ghost will fulfill you so much
[3:42:45.280 --> 3:42:50.280]  You can't even believe it
[3:42:50.280 --> 3:42:54.280]  But God demands that you take action against evil
[3:42:54.280 --> 3:42:56.280]  Which seems scary, which I don't know why
[3:42:56.280 --> 3:42:58.280]  I've been in this so long
[3:42:58.280 --> 3:43:01.280]  Fighting evil is a pleasure
[3:43:01.280 --> 3:43:03.280]  It is an enjoyment
[3:43:03.280 --> 3:43:06.280]  The question is, why do I do this more?
[3:43:06.280 --> 3:43:07.280]  Why was I not doing it before?
[3:43:07.280 --> 3:43:09.280]  There's actually a great feeling of guilt
[3:43:09.280 --> 3:43:11.280]  And patheticness in the face of God
[3:43:11.280 --> 3:43:14.280]  Once you join God, Satan is a rotting dead
[3:43:14.280 --> 3:43:16.280]  Carcass in the corner
[3:43:16.280 --> 3:43:18.280]  And with maggots covering it
[3:43:18.280 --> 3:43:20.280]  And you're like looking at celestial galaxies
[3:43:20.280 --> 3:43:21.280]  And unending power
[3:43:21.280 --> 3:43:23.280]  And you're like, how did this ever
[3:43:23.280 --> 3:43:24.280]  How is this?
[3:43:24.280 --> 3:43:27.280]  And then you watch civilization falling
[3:43:27.280 --> 3:43:29.280]  And your people falling
[3:43:36.280 --> 3:43:38.280]  That's the sick joke
[3:43:38.280 --> 3:43:42.280]  To replace Trump with Biden
[3:43:42.280 --> 3:43:45.280]  To replace your mother with Satan
[3:43:45.280 --> 3:43:47.280]  To replace everything that's strong
[3:43:47.280 --> 3:43:49.280]  And everything that's good with a lie
[3:43:49.280 --> 3:43:51.280]  Why would you do that?
[3:43:51.280 --> 3:43:52.280]  And Trump's not perfect
[3:43:52.280 --> 3:43:54.280]  He's a man like all of us
[3:43:54.280 --> 3:43:55.280]  The enemy hated him
[3:43:55.280 --> 3:43:57.280]  Because he wanted a pro-human future
[3:43:57.280 --> 3:43:59.280]  Because he believed in you
[3:43:59.280 --> 3:44:01.280]  And the spirit of Satan said
[3:44:01.280 --> 3:44:02.280]  I will attack you
[3:44:02.280 --> 3:44:04.280]  I will annihilate you
[3:44:04.280 --> 3:44:05.280]  I will defeat you
[3:44:05.280 --> 3:44:07.280]  Until you deny this
[3:44:07.280 --> 3:44:09.280]  Because this is a spirit
[3:44:09.280 --> 3:44:12.280]  That did not submit to me
[3:44:16.280 --> 3:44:18.280]  Well, I reject Satan
[3:44:18.280 --> 3:44:21.280]  And I reject all of Satan's servants
[3:44:21.280 --> 3:44:24.280]  And I commit myself to God
[3:44:24.280 --> 3:44:25.280]  I am fallen
[3:44:25.280 --> 3:44:26.280]  I am weak
[3:44:26.280 --> 3:44:28.280]  But I love Jesus
[3:44:28.280 --> 3:44:30.280]  And I commit myself to Christ
[3:44:30.280 --> 3:44:32.280]  And that's the only power I have
[3:44:32.280 --> 3:44:34.280]  But I don't just sit there
[3:44:34.280 --> 3:44:35.280]  Commit myself to Christ
[3:44:35.280 --> 3:44:36.280]  And shake in the corner
[3:44:36.280 --> 3:44:38.280]  Like some Nelly
[3:44:38.280 --> 3:44:40.280]  I then tell Christ
[3:44:40.280 --> 3:44:42.280]  I'm ready to die
[3:44:42.280 --> 3:44:43.280]  I'm ready to be crucified
[3:44:43.280 --> 3:44:45.280]  I'm ready to be like you
[3:44:45.280 --> 3:44:48.280]  I'm ready to be destroyed
[3:44:48.280 --> 3:44:50.280]  I'm ready to be attacked
[3:44:50.280 --> 3:44:52.280]  And I commit to you
[3:44:52.280 --> 3:44:54.280]  That my free willishers
[3:44:54.280 --> 3:44:56.280]  And I stand for humanity
[3:44:56.280 --> 3:44:58.280]  And I stand with your son
[3:44:58.280 --> 3:45:00.280]  And I am ready
[3:45:00.280 --> 3:45:02.280]  And that's what God's waiting for
[3:45:02.280 --> 3:45:05.280]  Is a few good men
[3:45:05.280 --> 3:45:08.280]  And women who are not
[3:45:08.280 --> 3:45:10.280]  Under Satan's bondage
[3:45:10.280 --> 3:45:12.280]  And who will not submit
[3:45:12.280 --> 3:45:15.280]  To this evil and this system
[3:45:15.280 --> 3:45:18.280]  The only thing as
[3:45:18.280 --> 3:45:20.280]  President Roosevelt said
[3:45:20.280 --> 3:45:25.280]  We have to fear is fear itself
[3:45:25.280 --> 3:45:28.280]  And so I salute our crew
[3:45:28.280 --> 3:45:30.280]  And I salute our audience
[3:45:30.280 --> 3:45:32.280]  And I salute you whether you're old
[3:45:32.280 --> 3:45:33.280]  Or whether you're young
[3:45:33.280 --> 3:45:34.280]  Or whether you're black
[3:45:34.280 --> 3:45:35.280]  Or whether you're white
[3:45:35.280 --> 3:45:36.280]  No matter who you are
[3:45:36.280 --> 3:45:37.280]  If you love justice
[3:45:37.280 --> 3:45:39.280]  And if you love God
[3:45:39.280 --> 3:45:42.280]  I commit to you eternally
[3:45:42.280 --> 3:45:43.280]  Love of God
[3:45:43.280 --> 3:45:45.280]  And resistance to Satan
[3:45:45.280 --> 3:45:55.280]  We're going to see hell on earth
[3:45:55.280 --> 3:45:57.280]  We're going to see everyone
[3:45:57.280 --> 3:45:59.280]  Of God's laws turned on top of its head
[3:45:59.280 --> 3:46:01.280]  We're going to see human animal clones
[3:46:01.280 --> 3:46:04.280]  We're going to see mass euthanasia
[3:46:04.280 --> 3:46:05.280]  Of our elderly
[3:46:05.280 --> 3:46:07.280]  We're going to see the ongoing
[3:46:07.280 --> 3:46:09.280]  Killing of our children, our babies
[3:46:09.280 --> 3:46:12.280]  But it's okay because they're in God's hands
[3:46:12.280 --> 3:46:14.280]  And those that commit
[3:46:14.280 --> 3:46:16.280]  These satanic crimes
[3:46:16.280 --> 3:46:18.280]  Are first in God's docket
[3:46:18.280 --> 3:46:20.280]  To be sealed
[3:46:20.280 --> 3:46:22.280]  And sent to be with themselves
[3:46:22.280 --> 3:46:24.280]  In their own hell
[3:46:24.280 --> 3:46:26.280]  Can you imagine being with David Rockefeller
[3:46:26.280 --> 3:46:28.280]  And Jeff Bezos
[3:46:28.280 --> 3:46:30.280]  And Hillary Clinton forever
[3:46:30.280 --> 3:46:34.280]  Can you imagine being cut off from God
[3:46:34.280 --> 3:46:36.280]  Can you imagine being cut off from beauty
[3:46:36.280 --> 3:46:38.280]  And everything that's good
[3:46:38.280 --> 3:46:39.280]  We've been given
[3:46:39.280 --> 3:46:40.280]  Well, that's who they are
[3:46:40.280 --> 3:46:42.280]  So they can defile creation
[3:46:42.280 --> 3:46:44.280]  They can defile God
[3:46:44.280 --> 3:46:46.280]  They can play God all day
[3:46:46.280 --> 3:46:50.280]  But they have lost in the final equation
[3:46:50.280 --> 3:46:52.280]  So I tell you now in closing
[3:46:52.280 --> 3:46:54.280]  Before the war room with Owen Schreuer
[3:46:54.280 --> 3:46:56.280]  Kicking over that this is the reality
[3:46:56.280 --> 3:46:58.280]  And this is the fight
[3:46:58.280 --> 3:46:59.280]  And there's good in the universe
[3:46:59.280 --> 3:47:00.280]  Not just evil
[3:47:00.280 --> 3:47:03.280]  And I am true as the North Star
[3:47:03.280 --> 3:47:04.280]  Pointed at God
[3:47:04.280 --> 3:47:05.280]  I am failed, I am weak
[3:47:05.280 --> 3:47:06.280]  But I love God
[3:47:06.280 --> 3:47:08.280]  And I am strong
[3:47:08.280 --> 3:47:09.280]  Strong in Christ
[3:47:09.280 --> 3:47:11.280]  Strong in you together as brethren
[3:47:11.280 --> 3:47:13.280]  Strong into the future
[3:47:13.280 --> 3:47:15.280]  Strong standing as the enemy
[3:47:15.280 --> 3:47:17.280]  And the great pain we're about to face
[3:47:17.280 --> 3:47:19.280]  Because the beginning of the end has only started
[3:47:19.280 --> 3:47:21.280]  But that ending is the beginning
[3:47:21.280 --> 3:47:23.280]  Of something much greater
[3:47:23.280 --> 3:47:25.280]  So I just tell you all
[3:47:25.280 --> 3:47:27.280]  Band.video
[3:47:27.280 --> 3:47:28.280]  Newswars.com
[3:47:28.280 --> 3:47:29.280]  Infowars.com
[3:47:29.280 --> 3:47:31.280]  We're seeing all the people we worked with
[3:47:31.280 --> 3:47:33.280]  Over the years that were under Satan's control
[3:47:33.280 --> 3:47:34.280]  Fall to the enemy
[3:47:34.280 --> 3:47:36.280]  We're seeing those that never joined us
[3:47:36.280 --> 3:47:38.280]  Joining us because this is
[3:47:38.280 --> 3:47:40.280]  The great harmonic convergence
[3:47:40.280 --> 3:47:43.280]  This is the great separation of the metal
[3:47:43.280 --> 3:47:45.280]  The gold from the shaft
[3:47:45.280 --> 3:47:47.280]  The wheat from the tares
[3:47:47.280 --> 3:47:48.280]  The goats from the sheep
[3:47:48.280 --> 3:47:49.280]  This is it
[3:47:49.280 --> 3:47:51.280]  This is the great test
[3:47:51.280 --> 3:47:53.280]  Let's go together with our souls into the future
[3:47:53.280 --> 3:47:55.280]  To build a better galaxy
[3:47:55.280 --> 3:47:56.280]  A better universe
[3:47:56.280 --> 3:47:58.280]  A better world
[3:47:58.280 --> 3:48:00.280]  We were given free will by our Father
[3:48:00.280 --> 3:48:01.280]  Because he loved us
[3:48:01.280 --> 3:48:02.280]  Because he believed in us
[3:48:02.280 --> 3:48:04.280]  And now we must complete the mission
[3:48:04.280 --> 3:48:06.280]  Don't hate God for your free will
[3:48:06.280 --> 3:48:09.280]  Thank God that he had the will to hurt
[3:48:09.280 --> 3:48:11.280]  And to make us pure
[3:48:11.280 --> 3:48:12.280]  And to make us big
[3:48:12.280 --> 3:48:13.280]  And to make us strong
[3:48:13.280 --> 3:48:14.280]  And to make us free
[3:48:14.280 --> 3:48:17.280]  Even though our Father had to pay
[3:48:17.280 --> 3:48:19.280]  The price of pain for doing it
[3:48:19.280 --> 3:48:22.280]  Because God was lonely and wanted to know you
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:24.280]  And God does know us
[3:48:24.280 --> 3:48:26.280]  And Satan is damned to hell
[3:48:26.280 --> 3:48:50.280]  The war room's coming up
[3:48:56.280 --> 3:48:58.280]  To make a day life with ease
[3:48:58.280 --> 3:49:00.280]  While encouraging hormonal balance
[3:49:00.280 --> 3:49:01.280]  Perfect by itself
[3:49:01.280 --> 3:49:03.280]  Or with super-male vitality
[3:49:03.280 --> 3:49:05.280]  In the true alpha-male path
[3:49:05.280 --> 3:49:07.280]  Alpha-power can help lose performance
[3:49:07.280 --> 3:49:10.280]  Help maintain normal testosterone levels
[3:49:10.280 --> 3:49:12.280]  Support healthy cholesterol and more
[3:49:12.280 --> 3:49:14.280]  Let alpha-power help bring you
[3:49:14.280 --> 3:49:16.280]  To the peak of your optimal health
[3:49:16.280 --> 3:49:18.280]  Don't fall short on energy
[3:49:18.280 --> 3:49:19.280]  In the fight against tyranny
[3:49:19.280 --> 3:49:21.280]  Show the world what a true alpha-male
[3:49:21.280 --> 3:49:23.280]  Looks like today with alpha-power
[3:49:23.280 --> 3:49:26.280]  Head to infowarstore.com today
[3:49:33.280 --> 3:49:35.280]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy
[3:49:35.280 --> 3:49:37.280]  Of psychological warfare
[3:49:37.280 --> 3:49:39.280]  The United Nations, the big corporations
[3:49:39.280 --> 3:49:41.280]  The globalists, big tech and big farmer
[3:49:41.280 --> 3:49:43.280]  All pushing the cub's most deadly thing
[3:49:43.280 --> 3:49:45.280]  In history, even though statistically
[3:49:45.280 --> 3:49:47.280]  It's a very weak flu or cold
[3:49:47.280 --> 3:49:49.280]  But if you are deficient
[3:49:49.280 --> 3:49:51.280]  Then you can actually die from it
[3:49:51.280 --> 3:49:53.280]  And so the nursing homes, meanwhile
[3:49:53.280 --> 3:49:56.280]  All these top scientists and researchers
[3:49:56.280 --> 3:49:58.280]  And former Pfizer head medical officers
[3:49:58.280 --> 3:50:01.280]  Have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine
[3:50:01.280 --> 3:50:03.280]  Especially the mRNA ones are basically
[3:50:03.280 --> 3:50:05.280]  Bioweapons that are super-deadly
[3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:07.280]  And now they're having to resuscitate people
[3:50:07.280 --> 3:50:09.280]  That die basically when they take it
[3:50:09.280 --> 3:50:11.280]  Just like newborn babies, they give vaccines
[3:50:11.280 --> 3:50:13.280]  They have to resuscitate them all the time
[3:50:13.280 --> 3:50:15.280]  Or a lot of times they just let them die
[3:50:15.280 --> 3:50:17.280]  And that's on the record, it does that
[3:50:17.280 --> 3:50:19.280]  Guillain-Barre's, narcolepsy, cancer
[3:50:19.280 --> 3:50:21.280]  But they tell you, save and effective
[3:50:21.280 --> 3:50:23.280]  No one's getting hurt, it's a conspiracy theory
[3:50:23.280 --> 3:50:25.280]  And then all the fine princess can kill you
[3:50:25.280 --> 3:50:27.280]  Absolutely deadly
[3:50:27.280 --> 3:50:29.280]  So they run from something that isn't dangerous
[3:50:29.280 --> 3:50:31.280]  Towards something that is incredibly dangerous
[3:50:31.280 --> 3:50:49.280]  And it's safe, they do it
